METHOD FOR ANNULAR SEALIN3<br>
The present invention relates to a method for sealing an annulus between tubulars or between a tubular and a borehole.<br>
Conventionally, in order to achieve a seal between a tubular and a borehole, the annulus (the gap between the casing and the rock/formation) is subjected to a cementing (or grouting) operation. This treatment is normally referred to a Primary Cementing. The main aspects of primvary cementing are to isolate flow between different reservoirs, to withstand the external and internal pressures acting upon the well by offering structural reinforcement and to prevent corrosion of the steel casing by chemically aggressive fluids.<br>
A poor cementing job can result in migration of reservoir fluids, even leading' to gas migration through micro-annuli in the well which not only reduces the cost-effectiveness of the well but may cause a 'blow out" resulting in considerable damage. Although repair j obs ("secondary cementing") are possible (in essence forcing more cement into the cracks and micro-annuli) they are costly and do not always lead to the desired results. One of the major drawbacks of the use of traditional cementing materials such as Class G cement (e.g. OPC : Ordinary Portland Cement) is that such materials cannot achieve a gas tight seal due to the inherent shrinkage of the materials. Shrinkage is typically in the order of 4-6% by volume which causes gas migration through the micro-annuli created because of the shrinkaae.<br>
It has been proposed in the art to use a mixture of a slurry of a hydraulic cement and a rubber component in order to improve on the ordinary sealing properties of<br><br>
the conventional cementing materials. However, the intrinsic properties of the conventional cementing material still play a oart in such sealinc rechniaues.<br>
Cementing can also be carried out between two tubulars, e.g. in order to fix a corroded cr damaged pipe or for upgrading the strength of a packed pipe.<br>
A technicue known in the oil industry as expansion of well tubulars, normally introduced to complete an uncased section of a borehole in an underground formation, has as one of its features that it narrows the gap between the outer surface of the tubular and the casing and/or rock/formation it faces. However, it is not envisaged and in practice impossible to provide even a small sealing effect during such expansion operation.<br>
In European patent specification 643,794 a method is disclosed for expanding a casing against the wall of an underground borehole wherein the casing is made of a malleable material which preferably is capable of plastic deformation of at least 25% uniaxial strain and the casing may be expanded by an expansion mandrel which is pumped or pushed through the casing. Again, it is not envisaged and in practice impossible to provide even a small sealing operation during such expansion operation.<br>
It is also known in the art that tubulars can be provided with coatings (also referred to as "claddings" ) which are normally applied in order to increase the resistance of the tubulars against the negative impact of drilling fluids and other circulating materials (e.g. fracturing agents or aggressive oil field brines). Again, such provisions are not designed to obtain any improvement with respecr to sealing.<br>
Recently, in International Patent Application WO95/02818 a downhole tubing systemt has been proposed which in essence  is based on a radially expandable slotted tubular body carrying deformable m.aterial on the<br><br>
extericr thereof and a seal member within rhe tubular body and for engaging an inner surface of said body. It is specifically stated that there should be, of course, no elastomer-to-rock contact at the positions of the slots  as the inflow of oil should not be interrupted.<br>
Therefore, the system as described in w095/C2Sie has to be regarded as a system which allows flow of fluid at certain places (envisaged because of the presence of the slots) and not in others which is achieved by the combination of three elements : the use of an expandable tube, the presence of a deformable material on the exterior of the tubular body and the use of a   seal member inside the expandable slotted tubular body.<br>
There is no reference in the description of WO99/02818 to expandable solid tubulars.<br>
In recently published International Patent Application WO99/06670 reference is made to a method for creating zonal isolation between the exterior and interior of an uncased section of an underaround well system which is located adjacent to a well section in which a casing is present. The zonal isolation is obtained by inserting an expandable tubular through the existing well casing into an uncased section, such as a lateral branch, of the underground well system and subsequently expanding the expandable tubular such that one end is pressed towards the wall cf the uncased section of the well system and the outer surface of the other end is pressed against the inner surface of the well thereby creating an interference fit capable of achieving a shear bond and an hydraulic seal between said surrounding surfaces. It is possible to insert a gasket material between the surrounding surfaces before expanding the tubular.<br>
It will be clear that the method proposed in International Patent Application WO99/06670 is aimed<br><br>
particularly at machined tubulars which are rather regular and the hydraulic seals formed are useful because of the concentric nature of the surrounding surfaces.<br>
It has now been realised that under more demanding conditions, in particular when the tubulars or a tubular and borehole are less concentric with respect to each other and may also vary in radial dimensions, providing adequate seals by straight forward expansion, even when using a gasket, is no longer possible. Even system.s which were initially well sealed because of the concentric, or substantially concentric nature of the tubulars or the tubular and the borehole, will deteriorate with time due to a variety of circumstances such as corrosion, displacement forces and the like. This means that there is a need to devise a sealing system which can operate under practical conditions and, preferably over rather long distances. Moreover, such sealing system should be capable of performing its sealing duty over a long period of time during which conditions may vary as discussed hereinabove.<br>
A method has now been found which allows the formtation of good quality seals when use is made of the expanding feature of an expandable tubular to provide a sealing based on thermoset or thermoplastic material.<br>
The present invention therefore relates to a m.ethod for sealing an annulus between two solid tubulars or between a solid tubular and a borehole which comprises the use of a thermoset or thermoplastic material in forming the seal between at least part of the outer surface cf a tubular and at least part of the inner<br><br>
this invention as amorphous polymeric materials which are in the glassy and/or rubbery state. The aggregation status of amorphous polymeric materials can be defined in general in relation to temperature with help of their rigidity since rigidity is the most important parameter with respect to differences in aggregation.<br>
Rigidity is the force required to effect a certain deformation. When taking the force per unit of surface of the cross-section (tension s) and expressing the deformiation (e) as a function of initial length (1) as e = Al/1, rigidity is the quotient of these two moieties, also indicated as the elasticity modulus and expressed as E = s/e. For each polymeric material a graph between log E (y-axis) and temperature (x-axis) can be construed showing the three areas and the respective transition points. The three areas are glass (lowest temperature, highest E), rubbery (lower E and higher temperature) and liquid (lowest E and highest temperature) . The transition points are normally referred to as glass transition point (Tg) and melt transition point (Tm),<br>
The materials envisaged for the formation of seals within the ambit of the present invention are of glassy and/or rubbery nature prior to expansion and oood performance will be obtained when they maintain completely or to a large extent that nature. It is possible that, because of the temperature regime, also influenced by the friotion forces released during expansion, part or all of a glassy-type material is converted to its rubbery stage. For certain materials this can even be an advantage  from a sealing point of view as the elasticity modulus for rubbery-type materials can be 100-1000 times lower than for the same material in its glassy-type status.<br><br>
To some extent, the amorphous polymeric materials may have some decree of crystallinity. The impact of crystalline material is small on glassy-type materials, in particular on the mechanical properties thereof and larger on rubbery-type materials as such materials delay transition into the rubbery status.<br>
It is also possible to use bitumen-containing polymeric materials to provide for the seals in accordance with the present invention. Commercially available bitumen-containing elastomers can be used advantageously as sealable materials.<br>
Examples of amorphous polymers which can be used in the m.ethod according to the present invention are butadiene and isoprene rubber which have a rubbery status at ambient temperature which will be even more so when they have been vulcanised. Materials like FVC and polystyrene are representative for glassy-type materials at ambient temperature. Copolymers of rubbery and glassy materials are also of interest; their properties will be determ.ined primarily by the relative contribution of the appropriate homo-polymers•<br>
Suitably, the materials to be used in the formation of the seals can be present already as claddings on the outer surface of the (inner) tubular to be expanded. The thickness of the coating may vary depending on the type of material envisaged, the annulus to be sealed and the exoansion strencth to be exerted. Coatinqs in the ranee of C. 02-10 cm can be suitably applied- Good results have been obtained on a small scale with coatings having a thickness in the ranee 0.05-2 cm..<br>
The claddings may be present over all or part of the cuter surface of the tubular to be expanded and they may also contain protrudings or recesses, in particular when an annulus is to be sealed of in various areas over the length of the tubular.<br><br>
Sealing is achieved when both axial and radial flow are substanrially or tot.ally prevented. An addirional advantage of the sealing method according zo   rhe present invenrion is that, in the event of a seal between a tubular and a casing, the initial collapse rare of the system is nearly or even completely restored. Known sealing gadgets (cf limited length) have only marginal ability to restore  the Collapse Rating of an initial complerion, irrespective of the fact that such gadgets can be applied properly when only marginal stresses are involved {such as in the shut off of watered out sections of horizontal well.s).<br>
The present invention comprises a number of alternative solutions which can be used depending on the type cf underground formation encountered and the amount of sealing actually required or preferred.<br>
In principle it is possible to construe a continuous seal between the outer surface of a tubular and the inner surface of the other tubular or the wellbore, as the case may be (i.e. the total outer surface of the tubular is involved in the seal) but often it is enough, or even preferred, to construe seals only at certain parts of the total (downhole) outer surface of the tubular which leads to zonal isolation. When, in the context of this descriprion the expression 'at least a part of the outer surface" is referred to it both includes total as well as zonal isolation (unless otherwise identified) .<br>
It has been found that the method according to the present invention allows for the formation cf seals over extended distances, for instance more than 15 meter, in particular more than 25 meter and suitable over much longer distances which can reach into hundreds of meters. Smaller distances are possible as well but the method is particularly suitable for sealing large distances. It should be noted that conventional packers have maximum<br><br>
lengths cf about 13 meters (about 40 feet) . It is also possible to provide zonal isolation for certain areas of the tubular involved or to produce seals which are alternated with non-sealed areas.<br>
In a first embodiment of the method according to the present invention, which is of particular advantage for providing seals in the context of boreholes having a substanrially circular cross-section (sometimes referred to as 'gun barrel shaped"), the seal is formed by bringing an expandable tubular cladded at least partly wirh a thermoset or thermoplastic material into the borehole followed by expansion of the tubular.<br>
Conventional elastomers can suitably be used for this type of application. For instance, nitrile rubbers  are eminently suitable for low to modest temperature applications. Low duty fluoro-elastomers (e.g. VITON (VITON is a Trademark) ) can be applied for more demanding conditions. 'Special Service" fluoro-elastomers would be applied in extremely ^hostile conditions. Examples of suitable fluoro-elastomers are for instance materials referred to as AFLAS or KALREZ (AFLAS and KALREZ are Trademarks). Silicones and fluorosilicones are further examples of materials which can be used suitably in the method for annular sealing in accordance with the present invention.<br>
The elastomeric materials can be coated to the rubulars to be used by methods known in the art which are not elucidated here in any detail such as conventional compounding techniques, e.g. such as applied in the manufacture of electrical cables.<br>
It is possible to enhance the compressibility of rhe elastomeric  materials envisaged by incorporating therein so-called closed cell structures, in particular when use is envisaged in shallow operations, or expanded, malleable miicrobubbles. Such, in essence hollow,<br><br>
microspheres act like minure balloons which provide additional compressibility of the elestomer during the expansion process and compensate for the vilume changes due to partial retraction of the tubing after the expansion process. Exam.ples of suitable materials include EXPANCELL and MICROSPHERE FE (EXPANCELL anc MICROSPHERE FE are Trademarks) . These applicatrons are particularly suitable when sealing an annulus between tubulars at low pressure.<br>
In a second embodiment of the method according to the present invention, which is of particular advantage for providing seals in the context of boreholes having a substantial elliptical shape but without having extensive wash-outs or other gross diameter changes, the elastomeric seal is formed by bringing an expandable tubular cladded at least partly with a thermoplastic elastomer into the borehole followed by expansion of the tubular.<br>
In such situations it appears that rather than a conventional thermoset elastomer (of which in essence the shape cannot be changed after vulcanisation by melting) a thermoplastic elastomer should be used. The process is preferably applied in such a way that heating is applied to the well when the expansion process is being performed. It is also possible to use glassy-tvpe materials in these situations.<br>
Thermoplastic elastomers which can be suitably applied in this particular embodiment include vulcanised EPDM/polypropylene blends such as SARLINK (SARLINK is a Trademiark) or polyether ethers and polyether esters such as, for instance, ARNITEL (ARNITEL is a Trademark) .<br>
Heating of the well before and/or during the expansion process can be carried out by any convenient heating technique. Examples of such techniques include the use of a hot liquid, preferably a circulating hot<br><br>
liquid which can be reheated by conventional rechniques, the use of heat produced by the appropriate chemical reaction(s) cr the use of electricity to generare heat in the underground formation. The result of applying heat will be chat -he thermoplastic elastomer, being in or being converged into rhe semi-solid state will have better opportunities to fill the more irregular cross-sections of rhe wellbore and also to a much larger extent.<br>
Again, it is possible to increase the compressibility of the thermoplastic elastomers envisaged by using expanded, malleable  microbubbles as fillers, provided that their hulls remain substantially intact during the melting stage of the thermoplastic elastomers applied during the expansion process. Micro-balloons having a hull of nylon can be applied advantageously.<br>
In a third embodiment of the method according to the present invention, which is of particular advantage for providing seals in the context of so-called 'open hole' sections, i.e. sections in which the tubular will be placed being highly irregular (sometimes referred to as large wash-out and/or caved-in sections), the elastomeric seal is formed by placing an in-situ vulcanising elastomer system into the wellbore, which elastomer is then subjected to the expansion of the tubular present in the borehole. It is also possible to use materials which are predominantly in the glassy state such as the partly saturated polyesters (such as the appropriate vinylesters), epoxy resins, diallylphthalate esters (suitable miaterials comiprise those referred to as DAP (the 'ortho" resin) and DAI? (the 'meta" resin), amino-type formaldehydes (such as  ureum.formaldehyde and melamineformaldehyde) , cyanate esters and thermoset polyimides (such as bismaleimides) and any other thermcsettinc esters .<br><br>
In £ preferred embodiment, use is made of an in-siru vulcanisable two component system to produce the appropriate seal. There are a number of ways to obtain "he envisaged seal.<br>
In a first mode, it is envisaged to fill the annular void with the (liquid) two component system and allowing the tubular (provided with a non-return valve) to dip into the two component system^ and allowing the system to set where after the expansion process of the tubular is carried out.<br>
In a second mode, it is envisaged to carry out the expansion process of the tubular prior to the setting of the two component system. The tubular expansion system is performed in this situation in the so-called 'bottom-up" mode, thereby forcing the not yet set elastomer solution into the micro-annuli  to create a 'rubber casket".<br>
Suitable materials for this mode of operation  in which an in-situ vulcanising elastomer system, is used are the so-called RTV (Room Temperature Vulcanisable) two comiponent silicone rubbers which can be suitably retarded for the elevated temperatures and pressures often encountered in oil and/or gas wells. Reference is made in this context to materials commercially available from. Dow Corning and identified as 3-4225, 3-4230, 3-4231, 3-4232 and 4-4234. It is believed that these materials can be used advantageously in view of their so-called "addition-curing properties". It is also possible to use elastomeric com^pounds based on epoxy-compounds such as the WELLSEAL range of products (WELLSEAL is a Trademtark) which is comim.ercially available from Shell.<br>
For specific definitions of the classes of compounds referred to hereinabove, reference is m^ade to Engineered Materials Handbook, Desk Edition, 2nd print (1598), ISBN 0-S7170-283-5, pages 251 -281.<br><br>
Once   again,   it  is   possible  to  pre-stress   the elastomeric   casket   to   be   produced  by   inflating   it   either by  a  built-in 'chexical   blowing   agent"   such   as   GEKITOR (GEKITOR   is   a  Trademark)    or  by   using   malleable microbubbles   containing   a   volatile   liquid  such   as EXPANCELL   DU    (EXPANCELL   is   a   Trademark) .   Also   fillers which  are  more  volum.inous   because   of   a   solid/solid  or solid/liquid   transformation   at   elevated  temperature   can be  suitably  applied.<br>
It  is   one  of  the  advantages  of  the process  according to  -he  present   invention   that   use   can  be made   of   reelable or  reeled  tubular  which  has  important   advantages  from, inter  alia,   a   logistics   point   of   view.   As  stated  herein before,   it  is  highly  useful  to  apply  expandable  tubulars in  reelable   or  reeled   form  which   has   been provided with cladding,   either  on  the   total   outer   surface  of  the tubular  to  be   applied   or   on   specific  parts  of   the  outer surface  when   the   tubular   is   to  be   used  in  zonal   isolation duty,   already  at  the manufacturing   stage.<br>
It  is   also possible,   and,   in   fact  preferred,   to  apply reelable  or  reeled  tubular  containing  in the   appropriate cladding  already electrical   cables   and/or hydraulic  lines which can  be  used  to  allow  remote   sensing and/or  control of processes   envisaged  to  be   carried  out when   the  tubular is  used  in  proper  production  mode.    In   the  in-situ vulcanising  mode,   it   is   possible   to   have   (armoured) cables  and/or  lines  present  attached  to  the  exterior  of the reelable   or  reeled  tubular  in   order to  allow telemetric   and/or  well   control   activities.<br>
The method  according   to  the   present   invention  can  be suitably  applied  in  repairing  or  upgrading damaged or worn  our   tubulars,   in  particular   pipes.   A  convenient method  comprises   providing  parr   or   all   of  rhe   pipe  to  be upgraded  with   in  inner  pipe  and  providing  a     seal  in accordance   with   the  method   according   to  the  present<br><br>
invention by expanding the inner pipe and thereby providing the seal using the rhermoser or thermpolastic material as defined hereinbefore as rhe material (s) which f orir. the seal because of the expansion of one inner pipe.<br>
The expansion of the tubular which is mandatory in obtaining rhe elastomeric seal as described herein above, can be carried ouo conveniently as described in the szaze of Che art. Reference is made, inter alia to patent application publication WO97/03489 in which the expansion of a tubular, in particular of a tubular rriade of a steel grade which is subject to strain hardening as a result of the expansion process, is described.<br>
The process of expansion is in essence directed to moving through a tubular (sometimes referred to as a 'liner") an expansion mandrel which is tapered in the direction in which the rriandrel is moved through the tubular, which mandrel has a largest diameter which is larger than the inner diameter of the tubular. By moving the mandrel through the tubular it will be appreciated that the diameter of the tubular is enlarged. This can be done by pushing an expansion mandrel downwardly through the tubular; or, more suitably, by pulling upwardly through the tubular an expansion mandrel which is tapered upwardly.<br>
Suitably, the expansion mandrel contains an expansion section that has a conical ceramic outer surface and a sealing section which is located at such distance from the expansion section that when the mandrel is pumped through the tubular the sealing section engages a plastically expanded part of the tubular. It is also possible to use a mandrel containing heating m.eans in order to facilitate the expansion process.<br>
The use of a ceramic conical surface reduces friction forces during the expansion process and by having a<br><br>
avoided that hydraulic forces would result in an excessive expansion of the tubular. In such cases it is preferred that the expansion mandrel contains a vent line for venting any fluids that are present in the borehole and tubing ahead of the expansion mandrel to the surface.<br>
In general it is advantageous to use mandrels having a semi-top angle between 15° and 30° in order to prevent either excessive friction forces (at smaller angles) or undue heat dissipation and disruptions in the forward movement of the device (at higher angles). For certain applications, in particular in the event of "end sealing", it may be useful to apply mandrels having a smaller cone angle. Suitable cone semi-top angles are between 10° and 15°. Small cone angles are beneficial for expanding internally-flush mechanical connections by mitigating the effect of plastic bending and, thereby, ensuring that the expanded connection is internally flush.<br>
An inherent feature of the expansion process by means of propelling a mandrel is that the inner diameter of the expanded tube is generally larger than the maximum outer diameter of the mandrel. This excess deformation is denoted as surplus expansion. Surplus expansion can be increased by designing the mandrel with a parabolic or elliptical shape, thereby increasing the initial opening angle of the cone to a maximum of 50° whilst keeping the average semi-top angle between 15 and 30°, The surplus expansion can be increased about 5 times. This in fact allows to increase the interfacial pressure between the expanded tube and the rubber sealing elem.ent and increases the annular sealing capacity.<br>
The tubular can be expanded such that the outer diameter of the expanded tubular is slightly smaller than the internal of the borehole or of any casing that is<br><br>
present in the borehole and any fluids the are present in rhe borehole and tubular ahead of the expansion mandrel are axially displaced upwardly via the annular space that is still available above the seal just created or being created by the expanding action cf the mandrel whilst pulled up through the tubular.<br>
The invention also relates to a well provided with a tubular which is sealed by the method according to the present invention. In such case the tubular may serve as a production tubular through which hydrocarbon fluid is transported to the surface and through which optionally a, preferably reelable, service and/or kill line is passed over at least a substantial part of the length of the tubular, allowing fluid to be pumped down towards the bottom of the borehole while hydrocarbon fluid is produced via the surrounding production tubular.<br>
As discussed hereinabove, the method according to the present invention is particularly useful for sealing an annulus between two solid tubulars or between a solid tubular and a borehole when at least one of the tubulars, or the tubular or the borehole as the case mav be, is less concentric and possibly also variable in radial dimensions so that a straight forward  sealing operation based on achieving a shear bond and a hydraulic seal is no longer adequate, even when use is made of a gasket material as described in International Patent Application W,O99/06670.<br>
The specifications of diameters cf pipes, tubulars and casings are normally given with their manufacturing tolerances. Reference is made to the oublications bv the American Petroleum Institute, 122C L Street, Kcrthwest Washington D.C., 2 00 05: Specification for line Pipe (API SPECIFICATION 5L, FORTY-FIRST EDITION, April 1, 1995) and Specification  for Casing and Tubing (API SPECIFICATION 5CT FITFH EDITION, April 1, 1995). In general, the<br><br>
roierances have been set at at most 1% of rhe appropriate diameter. The method according to the present invention can be applied suitably when materials (tubulars or tubulars and casings) are involved which deviate 50% or more from the normal tolerance as given by the manufacturer. It will be clear that larger deviations will frequently occur under field conditions and that the method according to the present invention becomes of greater economic importanee when the deviations become larger. Deviations of more than 200%, or more than 500%, or even at least 1000% of the initial tolerances given will frequently occur and call for providing seals in accordance with the method according to the present invention.<br>
The invention will now be illustrated by means of the following, non-lirndting examples. Example 1<br>
A test cell was used having a length of 30 cm and provided with a 1 inch (2.54 cm) diameter expandable tubular (prior to expansion) in a 1.5 inch (3,81 cm) annulus. The expandable tubular was cladded with a 2 mm thick coating of SARLINK (SARLINK is a Trademark). The expansion was carried out by pushing a mandrel through the expandable tubing at ambient temperature. The strength of the seal produced was tested by increasing pressure up to the point that leakage occurred. The annular seal produced could withstand a pressure of 30 bar at ambient temperature. This means that a specific ' pressure differential of up to about 100 bar/m could be achieved. Example 2<br>
The test as described in Example i was repeated but now using an expandable tubular which was coated with a coating of a thickness of 1.5 mm EVA/Polyolefin material, commercially available as Henkel, Hot Melt Adhesive. The<br><br>
expansion was carried out by pushing the mandrel through the expandable tubing at an expansion remperature of 150 °C. Afrer cooling down, the strength of the seal produced was tested by increasing pressure up to the point "Chat leakage occurred. The annular seal produced could withstand a pressure of 80 bar at 20 °C. This means<br>
that a specific pressure differential of up "co about 250 bar/m could be achieved. Example 3<br>
A larger scale experiment was performed using an 80 cm. 4 inch (9.16 cm) outer diameter seamless tubular havinc a 5.7 mm wall thickness and as a casino an SO cm 5.25 inch (13.33 cm) outer diameter seamless tubular having a 7.2 mm wall thickness. The ourer diameter of the cone of the mandrel was 10.60 cm. 4 areas of the outer . surface of the tubular were cladded with natural rubber having a thickness (not stretched) of 1 mm and a width (not stretched) of 10 mm. The force exerted to the cone was 29 tonnes. In the pressure test the seal held 7 bar net air pressure.<br>
As the presence of paint layers on the outer surface of the tubular could well have a negative impact on the sealing capabilities, the experiment was repeated using a sim:ilar tubular but subjecting it first to machine cleaning which caused removal of 0.5 mm of the initial wall thickness, giving a new outer diameter of 10.10 cm. After the same expansion procedure, no leakage was found at 7 bar net air pressure. When subjecting the seal to a nitrogen pressure test no pressure drop was measured during 15 minutes exposure to 100 bar nitroaen oressure.<br>
In a fourth embodiment of the method according to the present invention, which is cf particular advantage for providing seals in the context of so-called "open hole" sections, i.e. sections in which the tubular will be<br><br>
placed being highly irregular (sometimes referred to as large wash-out and/or caved-in sections), one can also use a special version of a thermoplastic or thermoset elastomer sealing element in which metal or glass containers are incorporated, which contain a chemical solution.<br>
Typical designs of said fourrh embodiment are given in the drawings in which:<br>
Fig. 1 schematically shows a partially expanded tubular around which a pair of thermoplastic or thermosetting sleeves are arranged in which a series of tangential burstable containers are embedded, and which burst as a result of the tubular expansion;<br>
Fig- 2 schemarically shows a partially expanded tubular around which a pair of thermoplastic or thermosetting sleeves are arranged in which a series of axially oriented burstable containers are embedded which burst as a result of the tubular expansion; and<br>
Fig. 3 is a top view of the tubular assembly of Fig. 2.<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates that during the expansion process of the metal base pipe 1, two simultaneous processes will occur : 1) the elastomer thermosetting or thermoplastic packing element 2 having ring-shaped fins 5 will be compressed against the borehole wall 3 and might provide a seal, provided the hole would be perfectly round and of a well defined diameter (as described in the first embodiment) and 2) concurrently, the burstable containers formed by a series of tangential tubes 4, embedded in the packing element and containing a chem.ical solution will burst as a result of the expansion process and emit their content into the stagnant completion or drilling fluid present in the annulus 6 between the borehole wall 3 and the expanded pipe 1,<br><br>
A special feature of this embodimenr is that the chemical solution is a special activatcr whicn reacts with the stagnant fluid (having latent hydraulic properries) into a solid.<br>
Examples of such systems are the mud to cement conversion processes (as e.g. described in International patent applications WO 94/09249, WO 94/09250, WO 94/05252, WO 94/19574, WO 99/23046 and WO 99/33763).<br>
Other (Portland, Aluminate or Blast Furnace Slag cemenr based) system.s which could be used as well, are chose described by e.g. BJ Services as ' storable cement system.s' , which are described in International patent applications WO 95/19942 and WO/27122, which typically are also activated (i.e. induced to set) by the addition of a chemical activator.<br>
Two component resin systems are also applicable such as the partly saturated polyesters (e.g. the appropriate vinylesters), diallylphthalate esters (suitable materials comprise those referred to as DAP (the ' ortho" resin) and DAIP (the "meta" resin), cyanate esters and any other thermosetting esters, amino-type formaldehydes (such as ureum.f ormaldehyde and melamineformaldehyde) , and thermoset polyimades (such as bismaleimiides) and epoxy resins. Typically, the tubes 4 would contain the activating agent (crosss-linker) whilst the 'completion fluid' that fills the annulus 6 between the metal pipe 1 and che borehole wall 3 would constitute the other reagent of the two component system;.<br>
Alternatively the annulus 6 between the metal pipe 1 and the borehole wall 3 comprises an in-situ vulcanisable two comiponent siloxane and fluorsiloxane syscems such as e.g. the product DC-4230, marketed by the Dow Corning Company, Midland, USA, which typically can be made to react by the addition of a (e.g. platinum vinylsiloxane)<br><br>
catalyst  to   induce  a   latent   elastomer  present   in  the   well to   set   into  a   solid  rubber  sealing mass.<br>
The   above- chemical   systems  have   only been   given   as examples  of   combining mechanical  gasketing  operations with   chemical   solidifying  processes.   As  such hydraulically  latent  drilling  fluids  or completion  fluids will   be   converted  into   solid,   gas   sealing barriers.   Those barriers  are   directly  resulting  from the mechanical tubular  expansion process,   which  induces  an   activator   to be   expelled  out   of  axial   or  radial   containers   embedded   in elastomer packing elements  and is  therefore  directly linked  to  the  mechanical   tubing  expansion process.<br>
Referring  now to  Fig.   2   there  is   shown  an  expandable tubular   10  of  which  the   upper  portion   lOA  is   unexpanded and   the  lower  portion   lOB  has  been  expanded.<br>
The  upper   tubular  portion   lOA  is   surrounded  by  an elastomer thermosetting  or  thermoplastic packing element   llA  in  which  a   series   of  axially  oriented burstable  containers   12A  are  embedded.   The  lower  tubular portion  lOB has  been  expanded  and  is  surrounded by another  thermosetting   or   thermoplastic  packing   element IIB  in  which  a   series   of  axially oriented burstable containers   12B  are  embedded  which  are   squeezed   flat   as   a result  of the   expansion  process  so that  a  chemical activator  14   is   released  into  the pipe-formation annulus   13.   The  annulus   13   is   filled  with  a   liquid  cement or   other  chemical   composition   15  which  solidifies   as   a result   of  the   reaction  with  the  activator  14.   If  the reaction  is  exothermic  and  the  packing element   IIB comprises  a  thermosetting material,   the packing  element IIB  will   also   solidify   so  that   a   robust  fluid  tight   seal is   created  in   the pipe-formation  annulus  13,   which   seal is   only established  after  expansion  of■the  tubular   10   and which   does  not   require   the   tubular  installation   and expansion process   to  take   place  within  a  predetermined<br><br>
I<br>
period of time as is the case when  procedures would be applied.<br><br><br><br><br>
