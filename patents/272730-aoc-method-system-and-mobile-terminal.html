				<td>FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
The embodiment of the present invention relates to the field of communication technology, and more particularly to an advice of charging (AoC) method, an AoC system, and a mobile terminal.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Advice of charging (AoC) functions to prompt a user by a server the account status and balance information when the user logs on for the first time, or when the user accesses a service that needs to be charged, inform the user about the cost of the service access in advance or prompt the user with the cost of the service afterwards.<br>
In the conventional art, an AoC method includes the following steps. A terminal initiates a service browsing request to a service gateway. The service gateway identifies the service type and terminal ID, modifies a uniform resource location (URL) of the service browsing request into a URL of a service charging server, and sends the URL to the service charging server. The service charging server requests corresponding charge information of a charging engine, then generates a prompt page according to the returned charge information, and returns the prompt page to the service gateway. The service gateway forwards the prompt page to the terminal. The terminal receives the prompt page, accepts this charge according to a user operation, for example, pressing an OK key, and meanwhile sends a service request to the service gateway. The service gateway receives the service request, identifies that this service browsing request has already been sent to the service charging server, and then forwards the service request to a service provider (SP)/content provider (CP). The SP/CP returns response information of the service request to the service gateway, and the service gateway forwards the response information to the terminal.<br>
The above method is mainly adapted to modify the URL of the service browsing request of the terminal on the service gateway side into the URL of the service charging server, and then display the URL to the user by a browser. As for non-Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)/Wireless Application Protocol (WAP) browsing data services, the browser is not activated in the use of the services, so the above method cannot be used. Therefore, this method is inapplicable to data services such as streaming media and mail. Further, this method is only applicable to fee advice before using the services, and cannot be employed to inform the actual cost<br>
 <br>
after the service is used.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to an advice of charging (AoC) method, system, and mobile terminal thereof, which are applicable to on-line AoC for all types of data services, and employ unified interface to receive messages, thereby facilitating the service deployment.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Technical solutions provided in the embodiments of the present invention are illustrated in detail below with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Figure 1 is a flow chart of an AoC method according to a first embodiment of the present invention. The method includes the following steps.<br>
Step 1: AoC information sent by a service charging server is received, and the entity that receives the AoC information may be a service charging agent located in a terminal.<br>
Step 2: The service charging agent displays the AoC information to the terminal.<br>
In this embodiment, the AoC information sent by the service charging server is received and displayed, so that the method is applicable to on-line AoC for all types of data services, and employs unified interface to receive the AoC information, thereby facilitating the service deployment.<br>
Figure 2 is a signaling flow chart of an AoC method according to a second embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, first, a user terminal initiates to a service gateway a service request, such as WAP/WEB page browsing, mail sending or receiving, and streaming media playback. The protocol adopted by the service request and the parameter thereof are related to the specific service. For example, HTTP/WAP* protocol is employed for browsing services, and the parameter thereof includes URL address information; and Real-Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) is employed for streaming media services, and the parameter thereof includes streaming media server address.<br>
In particular, the method of this embodiment includes the following steps.<br>
Step 101: The service gateway receives the service request initiated by the terminal.<br>
Step 102: The service gateway identifies the service type.<br>
 <br>
The service gateway may identify the service type via a simple quintuple mechanism, i.e., via protocol type, Internet Protocol (IP) source address and port, and IP destination address and port; or identify the service type by using a deep packet inspection (DPI) technique, for example, determining a forwarded mailbox server address by identifying the recipient address in a Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP).<br>
Step 103: The service gateway sends a charge prompt triggering message to the service charging server.<br>
A network generally includes more than one service charging server, and thus the service gateway may choose a specific service charging server according to the terminal information or the service information. Further, the protocol adopted by the triggering message includes, but not limited to, the HTTP protocol, and the triggering message may be a user ID, service ID, terminal capability information, service status, access network type, user location, charging engine location, or any combination thereof.<br>

The protocol adopted by the charge query request includes, but not limited to, the HTTP protocol, and the charge query request may be a user ID, service ID, access network type, user location, or any combination thereof. The address of the charging engine may be statically configured in the service charging server or acquired from the service gateway.<br>
Step 105: The charging engine queries the service fee information according to the charge query request, and returns the service fee information to the service charging server. The querying, by the charging engine, the service fee information is triggered by the service gateway to the charging engine through the service charging server according to the service request.<br>
Step 106: The service charging server receives the service fee information, and forwards the service fee information to the service charging agent on the terminal.<br>
The communication between the service charging server and the service charging agent may adopt various bearer modes, such as short messaging service (SMS), HTTP, or WAP.<br>
Step 107: The service charging agent displays the service fee information at the terminal.<br>
Step 108: After viewing the service fee information, if the user intends to continue using the service, the service charging agent sends an ACK message indicating the use of the service to the<br>
 <br>
service charging server.<br>
Step 109: The service charging server forwards the ACK message indicating the use of the service to the service gateway.<br>
Step 110: The service gateway requests service data of a service data source.<br>
Step 111: The service gateway acquires the service data from the service data source.<br>
Step 112: The service gateway sends a service response including the service data to the terminal.<br>
