				<td>Description of Invention<br>
This invention relates to a dust separating apparatus for a suction cleaner.<br>
There is also a co-pending Patent Application No. 2639/DELNP/2005 dated<br>
16.06.2005 titled as "Dust separating and collecting apparatus for a suction cleaner by<br>
the applicant. Suction cleaners ("vacuum cleaners") are very well known products, in<br>
which dust (which expression as used herein includes other debris and embraces a<br>
range of particle sizes from microns to millimetres or even centimetres) is picked up<br>
by suction and entrained in an airflow, the dust particles subsequently being separated<br>
from the airflow in at least one cyclonic separator. The dust laden air is caused to pass<br>
through the separator(s), in which it flows at high speed in a circular path so that the<br>
dust particles are dumped out of the airflow by centrifugal force. The separator may<br>
include a filter or filters which remove all or very nearly all of any remaining<br>
entrained dust particles from the airflow, which will usually be particles of very small<br>
size.<br>
In most suction cleaners using a cyclonic separator, the separated<br>
dust is retained in the vicinity of the separator, within a body of the separator<br>
at the bottom thereof having regard to its normal orientation in use. Disposal of<br>
this dust entails removal of all or part of the separator body from the cleaner, so<br>
that the dust can be emptied. Inherently this removal and the emptying<br>
procedure gives good access to the interior of the separator body which enables<br>
it to be cleaned if required. Cleaning of the inside of the separator body might<br>
be required if dust which is picked up by the cleaner is of a nature such<br>
that it sticks to any surface with which it makes contact and thus coats the<br>
inside of the separator body which eventually would detract from the effectiveness<br>
of operation of the separator: for example the picking up of damp dust such<br>
as plaster dust might have this effect. It also facilitates access to any filter,<br>
3<br>
whether coarse or fine, within the separator body for any necessary cleaning or<br>
replacement of the filter.<br>
It has been proposed that instead of collecting dust within the body of a<br>
separator the dust might be collected in a removable dust receptacle while the<br>
separator remains in position in the body of the cleaner. In this case the dust<br>
needs to pass from the separator by way of an outlet in the form of an aperture<br>
or opening hi an appropriate position on a body of the separator, to enter the<br>
dust receptacle. Such an outlet by which dust leaves the separator body to enter<br>
the dust receptacle is unlikely to be sufficiently large to enable easy access to be<br>
gained by way of it for cleaning the separator body interior. It is also a<br>
possibility that if a large piece of debris is sucked up by the cleaner (assuming it<br>
is able to travel along the airflow passageways leading to the separator), it<br>
might not be able to pass through the outlet from the separator to the dust<br>
receptacle and thus be trapped in the separator body. Removal of such a piece<br>
of debris would be inconvenient and time consuming.<br>
Accordingly it is an object of the present invention to overcome or<br>
reduce this disadvantage.<br>
According to one aspect of the invention, we provide a dust separating<br>
apparatus for a suction cleaner, comprising a cyclonic separating device having<br>
a body with an inlet and an outlet for a stream of air and an outlet for dust<br>
separated from the airstream to enter a receptacle for the separated dust,<br>
wherein said body comprises a part movable in relation to the rest of the body<br>
while the rest of the body remains in position in the cleaner, to provide access<br>
to tfie ulterior thereof.<br>
The movable part of the body may be completely removable therefrom,<br>
so that when the separating apparatus is installed in a suction cleaner the part<br>
can be removed from the cleaner leaving the rest of the body in position therein.<br>
The separating device may have the inlet and outlet for the stream of air<br>
at one end of the body and the outlet for dust at the other end of the body, the<br>
A<br>
removable part being that having the outlet for dust therein. The body may be<br>
of circular cross-sectional shape for the flow of the stream of air therein in a<br>
vortex between the ah- inlet and outlet, and may be of more or less constant<br>
cross-section or may taper, e.g. conically. With a tangential air inlet and a<br>
central air outlet at or towards one end of the body, the dust outlet may extend<br>
generally tangentially at or towards the other end of the body.<br>
The separating apparatus may comprise first and second cyclonic<br>
separating devices each comprising a body with an inlet and an outlet for the<br>
stream of air and an outlet for separated dust. The two separating devices may<br>
be arranged successively with the air outlet of the first communicating with the<br>
air inlet of the second so that dust is separated from the airstream in two stages,<br>
the first separating device removing large dust particles from the stream of air<br>
and the second separating device removing any remaining particles after the<br>
first separating device, and also finer particles. At least the first separating<br>
device may have a movable body part as aforesaid and preferably both the<br>
separating devices are so provided.<br>
The removable body part of the or each separating device may engage<br>
with the rest of the body thereof by a bayonet fitting, i.e. one requiring the<br>
removable part to be presented to the rest of the body in the direction of the<br>
longitudinal axis of the separator after which an angular movement thereof<br>
about the axis causes the engagement of at least one retaining formation to hold<br>
the parts together. Suitable sealing means such as a deformable gasket may be<br>
provided between the body parts to prevent air leakage at the connection<br>
therebetween.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, we provide a suction<br>
cleaner provided with a dust separating apparatus according to the first aspect<br>
of the invention as set forth hi one or more of the preceding paragraphs.<br>
The two separating devices may lie in a body or casing of the suction<br>
cleaner spaced from, e.g. hi generally parallel disposition to, one another with a<br>
6<br>
receptacle for separated dust having at least a part lying generally between<br>
them, the receptacle having respective inlets for separated dust communicating<br>
with the openings forming the dust outlets of the two separating devices.<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a dust separating apparatus for a<br>
suction cleaner, comprising a cyclonic separating device having a body comprising:<br>
(a) a first part with an inlet and an outlet for a stream of air;<br>
(b) an outlet for dust separated from the airstream to enter a receptacle for the<br>
separated dust; and<br>
(c) a second part movable in relation to the first part of the body while the first<br>
part of the body remains in position in the cleaner, to provide access to the<br>
interior of the body for cleaning.<br>
The invention will now be described by way of example with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings, of which:<br>
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic perspective view showing an embodiment of<br>
dust separating apparatus in accordance with the invention;<br>
Figure 2 is a perspective view as Figure 1 showing the apparatus with a<br>
dust receptacle therebetween;<br>
Figure 3 is a view as Figure 2 but from a different perspective<br>
viewpoint, illustrating the manner of removal of the dust receptacle;<br>
Figure 4 is a perspective view of one of the separating devices, showing<br>
removal of a part of the body thereof;<br>
Figure 5 is a section through the separating device of Figure 4;<br>
Figure 6 is a perspective view of the interior of one part of the separating<br>
device;<br>
Figure 7 is a perspective view showing removal of a part of the other<br>
separating device;<br>
Figure 8 is a perspective view of a suction cleaner and the separating<br>
apparatus therein.<br>
Referring firstly to Figures 1 to 3 of the drawings, these show a dust<br>
separating apparatus in accordance with the invention, for use hi a suction<br>
cleaner. Figures 2 and 3 show, in association with the separating apparatus, a<br>
receptacle for dust and other debris separated from the stream of air established<br>
by the cleaner when operating.<br>
The separating apparatus comprises a first cyclonic separator indicated<br>
generally at 10 and a second cyclonic separator indicated generally at 11. Each<br>
of the separators is a cyclonic separating device, in which air flows in a stream<br>
from an air inlet to an air outlet and is caused to flow in a helical vortex within<br>
the separator, which causes entrained dust particles to be separated from the<br>
airstream by centrifugal force. Cyclonic separators in suction cleaners are well<br>
known. The axis about which such flow in a vortex takes place is called herein<br>
the axis of the separator, and terms such as axially, tangentially and so on make<br>
reference to such axis.<br>
The first separator 10 comprises a body 12 with a first body part 13 and<br>
a second body part 14. The body 12 is generally cylindrical, of circular crosssectional<br>
shape and more or less constant cross-sectional area along its length.<br>
The body part 13 has a tangentially oriented air inlet 16 for a stream of air with<br>
dust entrained therein. This will have been picked up at a cleaning head of the<br>
cleaner, connected thereto, e.g. by a flexible hose and rigid wand. The nature<br>
of the connection to the cleaning head is irrelevant to the present invention.<br>
The body part 13 further has a centrally disposed axially extending outlet 18 for<br>
the stream of air. The body part 14 has, at its end remote from the body part 13,<br>
a tangentially oriented lateral outlet opening 20 for dust separated from the<br>
stream of air by centrifugal force in the course of its flowing in a vortex<br>
between the inlet 16 and outlet 18 of the separator 10.<br>
The second separator 11 is disposed with its axis generally parallel to the<br>
axis of separator 10, and comprises a body 22 with a first body part 23 and<br>
second body part 24. The body part 23 has a tangentially and slightly helically<br>
inclined inlet 26 for the stream of air which it receives from the outlet 18 of the<br>
first separator 10 by way of a connecting elbow 27a and duct 27. An outlet for<br>
the airstream extends axially through the centre of the body part 23 and is<br>
indicated at 28. This is arranged to be connected by suitable ducting to a<br>
suitable motor-driven fan hi a suction cleaner, with a filter arranged hi such<br>
w<br>
connection to trap any dust particles not separated from the airstream by the<br>
separators 10, 11. The body part 24 of the separator 11 is of tapering<br>
configuration so that its end 30 remote from the body part 23 is of much smaller<br>
diameter than the latter. Adjacent its end 30 there is a lateral outlet opening 32<br>
for dust separated from the airstream by centrifugal force within the body 22 of<br>
the separator 11.<br>
When installed in a suction cleaner a dust receptacle 34 is disposed<br>
generally in the region between the two separators 10, 11 for receiving dust<br>
separated from the airstream by the two separators. Figure 2 shows that the<br>
dust receptacle 34 comprises a base 35, side walls 36, 37 and end walls 38, 39<br>
defining an interior space for receiving dust from the separators and retaining it<br>
for disposal. Wall 36 has an inset part 40 (in which the separator 10 is partially<br>
accommodated) and in this inset part there is an inlet 42 for dust separated hi<br>
the first separator 10 and discharged at the outlet opening 20 thereof, the inlet<br>
42 to the dust receptacle including a short tube 42 reaching into the interior<br>
volume of the receptacle 34: this helps ensure that the dust is retained in the<br>
receptacle. The inlet tube 42 is shown in Figure 1 hi its operative disposition<br>
registering with the outlet opening 20 of the separator 10: also visible is a<br>
flexible seal, e.g. of bellows type, 44 preventing leakage of air and dust<br>
between the separator 10 and dust receptacle 34 when the dust receptacle is in<br>
position.<br>
On the opposite side of the receptacle 34 a partition wall 46 defines an<br>
internal compartment within the receptacle which is separated from the main<br>
internal volume thereof. This secondary compartment has an inlet opening<br>
which registers with the outlet 32 from the second separator 11 so that the<br>
secondary compartment can receive dust separated from the airstream by the<br>
second separator. A flexible seal operative between the separator 11 and the<br>
dust receptacle is shown in Figure 1 at 47, around the end of the dust outlet 32<br>
of the separator 11 and abutting the dust receptacle when the latter is in<br>
position, to prevent leakage of dust and air between the separator 11 and dust<br>
receptacle.<br>
Figure 3 is a perspective view from the opposite direction to that of<br>
Figures 1 and 2, showing the dust receptacle in position and also showing a<br>
cover 48 for the dust receptacle closing the top thereof which is shown open in<br>
Figure 2. The cover 48 is intended, in a suction cleaner, to form part of the<br>
visible exterior casing of the suction cleaner, and hence is styled for<br>
compatibility with the rest of the suction cleaner casing. For disposal of dust<br>
collected in the dust receptacle, the receptacle as a whole is lifted away from<br>
the separators in the direction indicated by arrow 50 so that it can be taken to a<br>
suitable place for emptying and disposal. For such emptying, the end wall 39 of<br>
the receptacle may open pivotally from its normal position in which it is held by<br>
a latching device.<br>
Also visible in Figure 3 is a latching formation 52 on the end wall 39 of<br>
the dust receptacle, which forms part of the mechanism for retaining the dust<br>
receptacle in position in the cleaner.<br>
Referring now to Figures 4, 5 and 6, these show the separator 10 in<br>
greater detail. Figures 5 and 6 show the interior of the body part 13 with the<br>
tangentially extending inlet 16 for dust-laden air, and, hi the centre of the body<br>
part, the outlet duct 18 of which a portion 56 extends into the body part along<br>
the central axis of the separator. The part 56 is provided at its free end within<br>
the separator with a domed wire gauze element 58 which acts as an extremely<br>
coarse filter to ensure that large pieces of debris remain within the separator 10<br>
and do not pass to the second separator 11 by way of the connecting elbow 27a<br>
and duct 27. Also clearly shown in Figures 4 and 5 is the body part 14 of the<br>
separator 10 with its tangential outlet opening 20.<br>
The body part 13 has at its free end an annular spigot 60 which fits<br>
closely within a complementary sleeve 62 at the facing end of the body part 14.<br>
A flexible seal 64 in the form of an O-ring is accommodated in an annular<br>
recess at the base of the sleeve 62, to provide an airtight seal between the body<br>
parts 13, 14. The body part 14 is provided with two hook-like latching<br>
formations 66 which are diametrically opposite one another relative to the body<br>
part, and these are engageable with lugs 68 similarly disposed on the body part<br>
13. Thus a "bayonet connection" is afforded between the two body parts: the<br>
body part 14 is removable from the body part 13 by firstly an angular<br>
movement of the former to disengage the formations 66, 68 followed by axial<br>
movement of the body part 14 until it is clear of the body part 13. This<br>
facilitates access to the interior of the separator for cleaning or removal of any<br>
large items of debris which, having been picked up by the vacuum cleaner, are<br>
trapped in the separator 10 being unable to leave it by way of the dust outlet 20<br>
or the airstream outlet 18. Refitting of the body part 14 to the part 13 is of<br>
course the reverse of the removal procedure.<br>
Figure 7 shows the second separator 11 with its body part 24 removed<br>
from its body part 23. This enables the air outlet duct 28 in the interior of the<br>
body part 23 to be seen: it extends within the body of the separator to<br>
approximately the end of the body part 23. The body parts 23, 24 may fit<br>
together by a bayonet connection as described above in relation to the body<br>
parts 13, 14 of the first separator, or there may simply be frictional engagement<br>
between a spigot 23a at the free end of the body part 23 and a sleeve portion<br>
24a at the facing end of the body part 24. A suitable seal is provided between<br>
the body parts 23, 24. It is envisaged that removal of the body part 24 of the<br>
second separator 11 is less likely to be required than is removal of the body part<br>
14 of the first separator 10, since no large items of debris sufficient to interfere<br>
with the operation of the separator 11 should be able to reach the latter from the<br>
first separator. However, cleaning of the interior of the separator 11 may be<br>
required if damp plaster dust for example has been picked up by the suction<br>
cleaner.<br>
Finally, Figure 8 of the drawings shows diagrammatically a suction<br>
cleaner having the above described separator and dust receptacle arrangement<br>
incorporated therein. It is a cleaner of the "cylinder" type, in which a flexible<br>
hose and optionally a rigid wand are used to connect a cleaning head to the<br>
cleaner, the cleaning head being able to be moved over a surface being cleaned<br>
to pick up dust. The cleaner comprises a body with an external casing 70,<br>
having at one end a pair of wheels 72 on which, together with a further wheel<br>
or castor (not shown) underneath the casing 70 towards the opposite end<br>
thereof from the wheels 72, it can be moved over a floor surface. The cover 48<br>
of the dust receptacle is shown and it will be noted that the. configuration<br>
thereof forms part of the styling of the cleaner. Also shown in Figure 8 is a<br>
handle 74 by which the dust receptacle may be carried when it has been<br>
removed from the cleaner for disposal of dust collected therein. Separator 10 is<br>
visible in Figure 8, and it will be appreciated that the separator 11 is<br>
correspondingly positioned at the opposite side of the dust receptacle. An<br>
electric motor, fan for causing the required airstream in the cleaner, and such<br>
further filters as may be required are provided in the part of the casing generally<br>
between the wheels 72. Also mere is a cable storage reel from which an<br>
electrical power cable having a plug 76 at its free end may be deployed for<br>
connection to a mains socket outlet, and to which the cable may be retracted<br>
after use.,<br>
Although in the above described embodiment the separators 10, 11 have<br>
their axes oriented generally parallel to one another, they may alternatively be<br>
in some other orientation. For example their axes may be generally<br>
perpendicular to one another and in this case the airstream outlet of the first<br>
separator may lead directly tangentially into the inlet of the second separator,<br>
tangentially thereof. A dust receptacle, with respective inlets oriented to<br>
register with the outlets of the separators, may then lie generally in a space<br>
partly bounded by the two separators.<br>
Although the suction cleaner described above is of the cylinder type, it is<br>
to be understood that the present invention is not limited to use in such a<br>
cleaner: it is also applicable to cleaners of the "upright" type.<br>
