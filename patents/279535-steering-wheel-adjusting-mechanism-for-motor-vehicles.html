STEERING WHEEL ADJUSTING MECHANISM FOR MOTOR VEHICLES<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a steering wheel adjusting<br>
mechanism for motor vehicles.<br>
Background<br>
Vehicles, e.g. cars, trucks and busses, generally have a<br>
steering wheel adjusting mechanism with which a driver may<br>
adjust the steering wheel in a for the present driver suitable<br>
position by partly displacing the steering wheel and that to<br>
the steering wheel attached steering column forwards and<br>
backwards relative to the direction of travel of the vehicle<br>
and partly, simultaneously or as an option, tilt the steering<br>
wheel and that to the steering wheel attached steering column<br>
in order to change the angular position of the steering wheel<br>
and the steering column relative to the vehicle. The steering<br>
wheel adjusting mechanism is lockable in such a way that the<br>
steering wheel and that to the steering wheel attached<br>
steering column after adjustment may be locked in a desired<br>
position relative to the vehicle at the same time as the<br>
steering wheel and that to the steering wheel attached<br>
steering column still may be turned around the axis of the<br>
steering column thereby enabling steering of the vehicle.<br>
One example of a steering wheel adjusting mechanism for motor<br>
vehicles is shown in SE 465 563 C which shows a steering wheel<br>
adjusting mechanism for motor vehicles comprising a supporting<br>
arm pivotally attached to a part fixed on the vehicle, and a<br>
pivotally to the supporting arm attached steering shaft<br>
housing unit. The supporting arm is further attached over a<br>
first locking plate package to the steering shaft housing unit<br>
and over a second locking plate package to the fixed part of<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/068588	PCT/SE2005/001950<br>
2<br>
the vehicle in order to with these locking plate packages to<br>
lock the steering shaft housing unit relative to the vehicle.<br>
A problem with the steering wheel adjusting mechanism above is<br>
that the supporting arm must be provided with means that<br>
couple and lock the two separate plate packages to the<br>
supporting arm in order to in this way to obtain locking of<br>
the steering shaft housing unit relative to the vehicle.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The problem with that the supporting arm must be provided with<br>
means that couple and lock the two separate plate packages to<br>
the supporting arm in order to in this way to obtain locking<br>
of the steering shaft housing unit relative to the vehicle, is<br>
solved according to the invention by providing a steering<br>
wheel adjusting mechanism for motor vehicles comprising a<br>
pivotally to the vehicle attached supporting arm, and a<br>
pivotally to the supporting arm attached steering shaft<br>
housing unit, where at least one locking plate package is<br>
attached to both the vehicle and the steering shaft housing<br>
unit which locking plate package is compressible with clamping<br>
means in order to lock the steering shaft housing unit<br>
relative to the vehicle.<br>
By that the steering wheel adjusting mechanism comprises the<br>
features in claim 1, the advantage is obtained that means for<br>
coupling and locking of plate packages to the supporting arm<br>
is not needed. Thus, the advantage of a simpler construction<br>
with fewer parts which facilitates the manufacture of the<br>
steering wheel adjusting mechanism, is obtained.<br>
By the features in the independent claim 8, the problem with<br>
to be able to manufacture a steering wheel adjusting mechanism<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/068588	PCT/SE2005/001950<br>
3<br>
which is simple to mount on a vehicle as only one part of the<br>
steering wheel adjusting mechanism must be fitted to<br>
attachment points in the vehicle, is further solved.<br>
