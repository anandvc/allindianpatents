				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION ;-<br>
This invention relates to a coin operated mechenism vending machine which enables the user to receive metered amount of fluid from a container with the help of a coin. This vending machine is a unique apparatus of its type. This will help in the installation of unmanned water point, milk point, juice point or any other liquid points at the roadside, in the markets and at the corner of the cities. This coin operated vending machine does not need any power, any man and any other electrical or electronic attachment. It is simple, cost effective, less voluminous and easy to use. It needs little care. It is totally mechanical. Coin operated milk vending machine which are presently being used are illustrated and described in IN Pat No. 135472 (milk vending machine of Mother Dairy Limited).<br>
PRIOR ART :-<br>
In the prior art coin operated milk vending machine, the outlet chamber remains in the discharge or rest position until the coin is inserted by customer OR Press button is pushed by the authorized person.<br>
Coin operated milk vending machine takes the time to charge the chamber and discharge the milk through the outlet. It is voluminous, costly and need electric and electronic attachment. It also need the power backup incase of power breakdown. There also need a authorized person to give the respective coin through the sale counter to operate the coin operated milk vending machine.<br>
In recent years efforts have been made for construction of coin operated vending machine to serve the purpose but as these machine comprises of electrical and electronic attachment. They need much care and they become inactive when there is a power break down. Examples of these electric and electronic based vending machine are disclosed in US pat no. 4,380,130 to Bachmann, US pat no 4,414,768 also to Bachmann, US pat no 4,454,670 to Bachmann and US pat no. 4,682,709.<br>
DESCRIPTION:-<br>
According to present invention, there is provided a coin operated vending machine wherein chamber is already charged in advance in rest position before the coin is inserted by the user hence it causes less consumption of time for discharge of fluid. It is easy to carry due to less weight and it does not need any electric or electronic attachment or any power backup. There also not need any man to give the respective coin through the sale counter to operate this vending machine because it is operated by customary coin. Therefore it helps in installation of unmanned water point, milk point, juice point or any other liquid points.<br>
Aim of the present invention:- To make a machine totally mechanical and operated manually to fulfil the work of vending by just inserting a coin and thus simplifying its operation without aid of power making it cost effective.<br>

The parts of coin operated vending machine as illustrated in point 1 to 30 is formed of described material, but other forms of material may be utilized if desired.<br>
FUNCTION OF THE COIN OPERATED VENDING MACHINE<br>
This vending machine operates by inserting a coin through the coin-slot (24) and by pressing the push button (2), extended to some extent outwardly of this vending machine. Push button having a compression spring (3) further pushes a stem (1). The stem pushes a flanged cap (4a) having a compression spring (5) with the help of a coin which in turns operate a lever (10) which closes the mouth of a check valve (17) and opens the discharge mouth (23), the liquid from the container collected in the metering pot (22) gets discharged and completion of dispensing of liquid give the normal position to the lever with the help of a torsion spring fixed at fulcrum which makes the return movement of adjustable pusher and said compression spring (3) &amp; (5) initiate the backward movement of the said push button, stem &amp; flanged cap with coin which makes the droppage of coin through the opening for Rs. 1 coin. The customer or the user will collect the liquid in a glass/bottle/any pot (Illustrated in diagram 1.)<br>
This vending machine is a close system having a coin slot (24) for inserting a coin and a discharge mouth (23) for dispensing a pre-determined volume of liquid.<br>
When one inserts the coin, it rests beside the flanged cap (4a) and in between the stem (1) as shown in the diagram. After that push button (2) is pushed and the coin moves along with the flanged cap (4a) as long as a slot (12) an opening for Rs. 1 coin comes and the coin drops (Illustrated in diagram 2).<br>
Before the coin drops, the adjustable pusher (14) on the flanged cap pushes a lever (10) which simultaneously operates the spool (16) having a check-valve (17) mounted at the outlet of reservoir and discharge valve (20) attached with chain at the bottom of the pot to stop the flow of liquid from the said spool into the metering pot and to discharge the metered liquid through the discharge mouth. The uplifting of the discharged valve and closing of the outlet of the reservoir with the help of check-valve (17) takes place simultaneously (Illustrated in diagram 3 (b)).<br>
Due to the action of the compression spring (5) and (3) at the flanged cap and the push button respectively, the flanged cap, stem and the push button return to its initial position. The torsion spring (21) brings the lever to come to its previous position, which normally open the mouth of the outlet of the reservoir and close the discharge mouth.<br>
A float valve (26) mounted along with the passage of the spool, which controls the flow of the liquid from the reservoir in to metering pot (22) &amp; ensure the storage of the predetermined volume of the liquid into the metering. (Illustrated in diagram 4).<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION:-<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a coin operated vending machine for dispensing a predetermined volume of a liquid from the reservoir comprising; (a)    a pushing means (2) extended outwardly;<br>
f (b)      a flanged cap (4a) being connected to said pushing means (2) on reception of a coin;<br>
(c)	an adjustable pusher (14) connected to said flanged cap (4a);<br>
(d)	a lever (10) being connected to said adjustable pusher (14) on movement of said flanged cap and having a chain connected to it for controlling the movement of said chain;<br>
(e)	a spool (16) connected to said lever (10) through a rod being pulled in a backward direction by said lever;<br>
(f)	a check-valve (17) connected to said spool for checking the flow of liquid from reservoir into metering pot;<br>
(g)	a discharge valve (20) connected to said metering pot for dispensing the liquid from said metering pot (22); and<br>
(h) a float valve (26) connected to said spool for controlling the flow of liquid in accordance with the volume of liquid into the metering pot (22);<br>
thereby dispensing liquid and returning said lever, said flanged cap, said pushing means and said adjustable pusher to normal position after the liquid is dispensed.<br>
ADVANTAGES:<br>
i). On the basis of above specification another vending machine may be constructed which may be operated only by 50 paisa or by Rs. 2 coin by doing some modification in case of water point or at less costly fluid point.<br>
ii). On the basis of above specification another vending machine may be constructed which may be operated only by Rs. 5 coin by doing some modification in case of cold drinks, juice, milk, coffee or other related cost fluid. But in this case of operation the opening for 50 paisa, Rs.l and for Rs. 2 coin will be just below the slot (24) (opening for inserting a coin) with less thickness of Rs.5 coin so that the customer or user may not get the explained fluid by inserting of 50 paisa, Rs.l or Rs. 2 coin because this type of fluid will be discharged only by inserting Rs.5 coin. The opening for Rs. 5 coin will be constructed according to his thickness and diameter for easy to drop just ahead the opening of Rs. 0.50 paisa, Rs. 1 and Rs. 2 coin. The diameter of the flanged cap (4a) and stem (1) will be adjusted according to the diameter of the Rs.5 coin. In this operation Rs.5 coin inserted through the slot (24) which do the same function and will dispense the metered fluid as done by Rs.l coin as explained in the complete specification. Thus in simple words there may be constructed another type of vending machine which will be operated by Rs.5 coin or by any higher value coin according to market value of the fluids.<br>
iii.) More then one vending machine of different coin base may be attached in the same reservoir for the financial choice of customer OR different reservoir of fluid may be attached with "coin operated vending machine" in the single system for the disposal of variety of fluids for the choice of customer.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
