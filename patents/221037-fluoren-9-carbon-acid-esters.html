The alkyl groups used, unless otherwise stated, are branched and unbranched alkyl groups having 1 to 5 carbon atoms. Examples include: methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl. The groups methyl, ethyl, propyl or butyl may optionally also be referred to by the abbreviations Me, Et, Prop or Bu. Unless otherwise stated, the definitions propyl and butyl also include all possible isomeric forms of the groups in question. Thus, for example, propyl includes n-propyl and iso-propyl, butyl includes iso-butyl, sec. butyl and tert.-butyl, etc.<br>
The alkylene groups used, unless otherwise stated, are branched and unbranched double-bonded alkyl bridges with 1 to 4 carbon atoms. Examples include: methylene, ethylene, propylene or butylene.<br>
The alkylene-halogen groups used, unless otherwise stated, are branched and unbranched double-bonded alkyl bridges with 1 to 4 carbon atoms which may be mono-, di- or trisubstituted, preferably disubstituted, by a halogen. Accordingly, unless otherwise stated, the term alkylene-OH groups denotes branched and unbranched double-bonded alkyl bridges with 1 to 4 carbon<br>
atoms which may be mono-, di- or trisubstituted, preferably monosubstituted, by a hydroxy.<br>
The alkyloxy groups used, unless otherwise stated, are branched and unbranched alkyl groups with 1 to 4 carbon atoms which are linked via an oxygen atom. The following may be mentioned, for example: methyloxy, ethyloxy, propyloxy or butyloxy. The groups methyloxy, ethyloxy, propyloxy or butyloxy may optionally also be referred to by the abbreviations MeO, EtO, PropO or BuO. Unless otherwise stated, the definitions propyloxy and butyloxy also include all possible isomeric forms of the groups in question. Thus, for example, propyloxy includes n-propyloxy and iso-propyloxy, butyloxy includes iso-butyloxy, sec. butyloxy and tert.-butyloxy, etc. The word alkoxy may also possibly be used within the scope of the present invention instead of the word alkyloxy. The groups methyloxy, ethyloxy, propyloxy or butyloxy may optionally also be referred to as methoxy, ethoxy, propoxy or butoxy.<br>

ester group. The term -0-CO-alkyl-halogen group should be understood analogously. The group -O-CO-CFs denotes trifluoroacetate.<br>
Within the scope of the present invention halogen denotes fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine. Unless otherwise stated, fluorine and bromine are the preferred halogens. The group CO denotes a carbonyl group.<br>
As explained hereinafter, the compounds according to the invention may be prepared partly analogously to the methods already known in the art (Diagram 1). The carboxylic acid derivatives of formula 3 are known in the art or may be obtained by methods of synthesis known in the art. If only suitably substituted carboxylic acids are known in the art, the compounds of formula 3 may also be obtained directly from them by acid- or base-catalysed<br>
esterification with the corresponding alcohols or by halogenation with the corresponding halogenation reagents.<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
Diagram 1:<br>
As can be seen from Diagram 1, the compounds of formula 2 may be used as starting products for preparing the compounds of formula 1. These compounds are known in the art.<br>
Starting from the compounds of formula 2 the esters of general formula 4 may be obtained by reaction with the carboxylic acid derivatives of formula 3, wherein R' denotes for example chlorine or a C^-C^alkyloxy group. When R' equals C-|-C4-alkyloxy this reaction may be carried out for example in a sodium melt at elevated temperature, preferably at about 50-150°C, more preferably at about 90-100°C at low pressure, preferably at below 500 mbar, most preferably at below 75 mbar. Alternatively, instead of the derivatives 3 wherein R' denotes C
The compounds of formula 4 thus obtained may be converted into the target compounds of formula 1 by reacting with the compounds R2-X, wherein R2 and X may have the abovementioned meanings. This synthesis step may also be carried out analogously to the examples of synthesis disclosed in WO 92/16528. In the case wherein R1 and R2 together form an alkylene bridge there is no need to add the reagent R2-X, as will be apparent to the skilled man. In this case the compounds of formula 4 contain a suitably substituted group R1 (for example -Cs-Cs-alkylene-halogen) according to the above definitions and the compounds of formula 1 are prepared by intramolecular quaternisation of the amine.<br>
Alternatively to the method of synthesising the compounds of formula 4 shown in Diagram 1 the derivatives 4, wherein the nitrogen bicyclic group denotes a scopine derivative may be obtained by oxidising (epoxidising) compounds of formula 4 wherein the nitrogen bicyclic group is a tropenyl group. According to the invention the following procedure may be used. The compound 4 wherein A denotes -CH=CH- is suspended in a polar organic solvent, preferably in a solvent selected from among N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP), dimethylacetamide and dimethylformamide, preferably dimethylformamide and then heated to a temperature of about 30-90°C, preferably 40-70°C. Then a suitable oxidising agent is added and the mixture<br>
is stirred at constant temperature for 2 to 8 hours, preferably 3 to 6 hours. The oxidising agent is preferably vanadium pentoxide mixed with H2O2, most<br>
preferably H2O2-urea complex combined with vanadium pentoxide. The<br>
mixture is worked up in the usual way. The products may be purified by crystallisation or chromatography depending on their tendency to crystallise.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of formula 4 wherein R denotes halogen may also be prepared by the method shown in Diagram 2.<br>
 (Figure Remove)<br><br>
For this, the compounds of formula 4 wherein R denotes hydroxy are converted into the compounds 4 wherein R denotes halogen using suitable halogenation reagents. The method used for the halogenation reactions to be carried out according to Diagram 2 is sufficiently well known in the art. As is apparent from Diagram 1, the intermediate products of general formula 4 have a central importance. Accordingly, in another aspect, the present invention relates to the intermediates of formula 4<br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
wherein the groups A, R, R1, R3, R3', R4 and R4' may be defined as above, optionally in the form of the acid addition salts thereof. By acid addition salts are meant salts selected from among the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, hydrosulphate, hydrophosphate, hydromethanesulphonate, hydronitrate, hydromaleate, hydroacetate, hydrocitrate, hydrofumarate, hydrotartrate, hydrooxalate, hydrosuccinate, hydrobenzoate and hydro-p-toluenesulphonate, preferably the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydrosulphate, hydrophosphate, hydrofumarate and hydromethanesulphonate.<br>
As in the compounds of general formula 1 the groups R3, R4, R3' and R4', if they do not represent hydrogen, may in each case be arranged in the ortho, meta or para position relative to the bond of the "-C- R" group in the compounds of general formula 4_ as well. If none of the groups R3, R4, R3' and R4' denotes hydrogen, R3 and R3' are preferably linked in the para position and R4 and R4' are preferably linked in the ortho or meta position, most preferably in the meta position. If one of the groups R3 and R4 and one of the groups R3' and R4' denotes hydrogen, the other group in each case is preferably linked in the meta or para position, most preferably in the para position. If none of the groups R3, R4, R3' and R4' denotes hydrogen the compounds of general formula 4 which are particularly preferred according to the invention are those wherein the groups R3, R4, R3' and R4' have the same meaning.<br>
According to the invention, the compounds of formula 4 in the a-configured form are preferably used as the starting materials. These a-configured compounds are therefore of particularly importance according to the invention and correspond to general formula <br>
(Figure Remove)<br>
In another aspect the present invention relates to the use of compounds of general formula 2 for preparing the compounds of general formula 4. Moreover the present invention relates to the use of the compounds of general formula 2 as starting materials for preparing the compounds of general formula 1. Moreover the present invention relates to the use of the compounds of general formula 4 as an intermediate product in the preparation of the compounds of general formula 1.<br>
The examples of synthesis described below serves to illustrate the present invention still further. However, they are to be regarded as only an example of the procedure, as further illustration of the invention, without restricting the invention to the object described below by way of example.<br>

The abovementioned preservatives are preferably present in concentrations of up to 50mg/100ml, most preferably between 5 and 20 mg/100ml. Preferred formulations contain only benzalkonium chloride and sodium edetate, in addition to the solvent water and the active substance 1. In another preferred embodiment, no sodium edetate is used.<br>
The dosage of the compounds according to the invention is naturally highly dependent on the method of administration and the complaint which is being treated. When administered by inhalation the compounds of formula 1_are characterised by a high potency even at doses in the ug range. The compounds of formula 1 may also be used effectively above the ug range. The dosage may then be in the gram range, for example. When administered by routes other than by inhalation the compounds according to the invention may be administered in higher doses (for example, but not restrictively, in the range from 1 to 1000 mg).<br>
The following examples of formulations illustrate the present invention without restricting its scope:<br>
The finely ground active substance, lactose and some of the corn starch are mixed together. The mixture is screened, then moistened with a solution of polyvinylpyrrolidone in water, kneaded, wet-granulated and dried. The granules, the remaining corn starch and the magnesium stearate are screened and mixed together. The mixture is compressed to produce tablets of suitable shape and size.<br>
The finely ground active substance, some of the corn starch, lactose, microcrystalline cellulose and polyvinylpyrrolidone are mixed together, the mixture is screened and worked with the remaining corn starch and water to form a granulate which is dried and screened. The sodium carboxymethyl<br>
starch and the magnesium stearate are added and mixed in and the mixture is compressed to form tablets of a suitable size.<br>
The active substance is dissolved in water at its own pH or optionally at pH 5.5 to 6.5 and sodium chloride is added to make the solution isotonic. The resulting solution is filtered to remove pyrogens and the filtrate is transferred under aseptic conditions into ampoules which are then sterilised and heat-sealed. The ampoules contain 5 mg, 25 mg and 50 mg of active substance.<br>
The suspension is transferred into a conventional aerosol container with metering valve.   Preferably 50 ul suspension are released on each actuation. The active substance may also be released in higher doses if desired (e.g. 0.02 wt-%).<br>
This solution may be prepared in the usual way.<br>
The inhalable powder is prepared in the usual way by mixing the individual ingredients.<br>
