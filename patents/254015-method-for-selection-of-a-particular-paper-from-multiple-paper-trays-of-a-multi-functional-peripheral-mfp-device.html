While performing operation on a MFP from a PC connected through any medium to MFP, main problem is selection of a particular document from a bunch of documents lying on the paper tray of MFP. In this invention a method is provided such that user can have the knowledge regarding content of the documents and can select the desired document from that bunch of documents for the required operation. In this method a particular part of each document will be scanned and this scanned data is sent to PC, so that user can identify the document by seeing that part of documents. Now user can select a document. Whenever user selects the document a code corresponding to that document is sent to MFP and MFP take that document for operation.<br>
These and the other objects, features and advantages of this invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
Accordingly this invention explains a method for selection of a particular document from a set of paper lying on paper tray of MFP located at remote place from a PC comprising the steps of:<br>
at the MFP:<br>
(a)	arranging all the papers needed for operation in the first paper tray;<br>
(b)	scanning a specific part of all papers lying on the first tray and sending scanned image and it's code to PC;<br>
(c)	assigning a sequence number for each paper which indicates the tray position and the said paper's position from bottom of the said tray;<br><br>
(d)	sending the scanned data and code of the document to the said PC;<br>
(e)	sending end of paper signal to PC with number of papers lying on first and second paper trays after scanning of all documents;<br>
at the PC:<br>
(f)	starting an application through which the user can select the papers;<br>
(g)	receiving the information's along with the scanned data from the MFP;<br>
(h) displaying all images received by PC using an interface;<br>

(j) sending the code corresponding to paper to MFP on the selection of a paper,<br>
wherein the corresponding pages are transferred on the top of the first tray on the reception of a code by the MFP and the number of papers and code of pages in the first and second tray on the MFP are adjusted accordingly.<br>
When start command is received from PC, two variables get initialized where the said variables indicate the number of papers in the first and the second tray. Whenever user send start signal from application to MFP, a specific part of each paper is scanned and a code &amp; scanned data corresponding to that paper is sent to the PC. When MFP receives a paper selection command from PC; it receives a paper code MN where M specifies the location of document which is the first or the second tray and N specifies the said paper position from bottom of the paper tray. When MFP receives a paper selection command all paper lying above selected paper gets transferred and the selected paper will be picked up for the desired operation. When user selects a particular paper its code MN is sent to MFP. After the completion of the page transfer MFP sends a page transferred command to PC. The PC application waits for page transfer signal, and on the reception of the said signal application rearrange the code of the papers according to their new position and sequence on paper trays in MFP after page transfer and the selected image gets deleted from application data base. The said transfer of pages is done using a roller. Transferring paper from one tray to other can be done using a stepper motor. Transferring paper from one tray to other can be done using printing engine<br><br>
of MFP. Also the said method is adapted to operate using said paper trays arranged outside the MFP.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The proposed method in invention will be understood on reading the description of the invention in connection with the given drawings.<br>
Structure of the Invention<br>
MFP specified in this invention is required to have 2 paper trays and some<br><br>
mechanical arrangement for transferring paper from one tray to another. This mechanical arrangement can be a roller. This MFP is connected to a PC through any medium by which MFP and PC can communicate with each other.<br>
Operation of the Invention<br>
First user is required to put the bunch of the papers on paper tray A, from which user can select a paper for any desired operation. Now user can start an application on PC through which it can select the papers. Whenever user send start signal from application to MFP, a specific part of each paper is scanned and a code &amp; scanned data corresponding to that paper is sent to PC. When all papers are scanned a end of document signal is sent to PC. Now all images received by PC are displayed on the PC by application.<br>
When user selects any paper from application on PC, the code corresponding to the paper is sent to MFP. On reception of any code from PC, MFP put the page corresponding to that code on the top of paper tray A. So while doing any operation MFP will pick the page from the top of paper tray A. Operation on PC side and MFP side is explained by flow chart in Figures 3and 4 respectively.<br>
Figure 1 displays the system comprising of a personal computer connected to MFP through a medium. The medium can be any existing standard communication medium. MFP has two paper trays (A&amp;B). There is a roller between two paper trays for transferring the paper between two paper trays.<br>
Figure 2 describes the sequence of paper in paper trays and their corresponding sequence number. These sequence number will be used by decision making logical flow to decide the number of papers to be transferred between paper trays.<br>
Figure 3 describes the logic on MFP side. This logic flow will work in tandem with the application residing on the host PC. This logic flow will wait for the command from PC. All the papers needed for operation will be lying on one paper tray (Paper<br><br>
Tray A). When ever start command is received from PC, two variables I and J will be initialized to 0.1 and J have the number of papers in tray B and A respectively. Now a part of each paper lying on tray A will be scanned, paper will be assigned a sequence number specifying its position (A or B for paper tray A or paper tray B) and its position from bottom of the tray. After scanning of each paper, scanned data and code of the document will be sent to PC. After scanning of all documents, end of paper signal will be sent to PC with number of papers lying on paper tray A and B. Whenever MFP receive paper selection command from PC; it will also receive paper code (MN) where M will specify the location of document (tray A or B) and N will specify its position from bottom of paper tray. Now all paper lying above selected paper will be transferred to other tray and selected paper will be picked up for the desired operation. After completion of this process MFP will send page transferred command to PC. Now MFP will go in wait mode for the PC command.<br>
The procedure steps followed in the said flow diagram is stared below.<br>
•	Put Documents in a Paper tray A.<br>
•	Wait for command from PC.<br>
•	On start command from the PC the variables II and J are initialized I = 0, J=0.<br>
•	Scan a particular part of document at the top in paper tray A.<br>
•	After scan transfer document to other tray.<br>
•	Increment the variable I as the page numbers in tray B increases I++, code for this document = Bl.<br>
•	Check if any document left in tray A and if any document is left in the tray then again scan a particular part of document at the top in paper tray A till the tray is empty.<br>
•	When the tray is empty send the end of document signal to the PC along with the variable values of I and J.<br>
•	If the paper select command is initiated by the PC then the code MN (Received code of selected paper from PC) is obtained by the MFP.<br>
•	If the code is for tray A then transfer (l-N+1) pages from B to A and the said variables are changed to I = N -1, J = J+ I - N.<br><br>
•	If the code is for tray B then transfer (J-N) pages from A to B and the said variables are changed to J = IM-1,1 = l+J-N.<br>
•	After the transfer is over the page transfer command is send to PC.<br>
Figure 4 describes the logic on the PC side. This logic will work in tandem with MFP logical flow. When application is started, start command will be sent to MFP. In response of this command MFP will scan a part of each document and will send scanned data with document code to PC. Application will display the scanned data for user's reference and selection of the document. After scanning of all papers, MFP will send end of document signal to PC, on reception of this signal application will wait for user action. Whenever user selects a particular paper its code (MN) will be sent to MFP. Application now wait for page transfer signal, on the reception of this signal application will rearrange the code of the papers according to their new position and sequence on paper trays in MFP after page transfer. Selected image will be deleted from application database.<br>
The procedure steps followed in the said flow diagram is stared below.<br>
•	Start application on PC.<br>
•	Send start command to MFP.<br>
•	Wait for response of MFP.<br>
•	Check is made for the end of document signal.<br>
•	If it is not the end of the document then the image data and corresponding code is received and the received image is displayed.<br>
•	If it is the end of the document then K= I, L = J where K &amp; L are number of papers in tray B &amp;A respectively.<br>
•	Then wait for the user action, and if Is any image is selected send the code (MN) of the selected image to MFP.<br>
•	Then wait for the page transfer signal wherein during the transfer the paper corresponding to selected image is put on the top of paper tray A.<br>
•	If (M=A) then Search through all codes and if in any code (m=A&amp;n&gt;N) then make m=B &amp; n=K+1+L-n and the value of L = N-1, K = K+L-N.<br><br>
•	If (M=B) then search through all codes and if in any code (m=B&amp;n&gt;N) then make m=A &amp; n= L+1+K-n and the value of K = N -1, L = L+ I - N.<br>
•	Once the transaction is over then selected image &amp; code gets deleted.<br>
Advantages of present system are as follows<br>
1)	It removes the requirement of placing documents in order according to operations.<br>
2)	If order of operation is not certain, then there should be a person on MFP to select documents according to operation. This invention removes this requirement.<br>
3)	This invention can be very helpful in designing of a virtual MFP on PC which will be connected to a real MFP. Now user can perform all operation from PC itself.<br>
Following are the list of modifications that can be made to the basic invention.<br>
1)	Roller used for transferring paper from one tray to other can be replaced by any<br>
mechanical arrangement like<br>
Stepper motor.<br>
2)	Instead of having a separate mechanism for transferring paper, printing engine of MFP also can be used for this.<br>
3)	Paper trays can be outside of MFP also, a proper mechanism should be provided to pick up the paper.<br>
