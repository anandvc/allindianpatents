				<td>DOUBLE-FIRED HORIZONTAL TUBE HEATER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to double-fired heaters having a radiant<br>
heat exchange tube supported in horizontal lengths by a tube support, and more<br>
particularly to such a heater having design features that simplify replacement of<br>
the tube and tube support.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In a double-fired heater, at least one heat exchange tube, which carries a<br>
process fluid (liquid or gas), is heated by combustion from two opposing sides of<br>
the tube in a radiant section of the heater. This invention relates to a subclass of<br>
such heaters, which will be referred to as "horizontal tube heaters," in which the<br>
tube (or tubes) winds back and forth in horizontal lengths to form a coil panel (or<br>
panels). The coil panel is supported within the radiant section by tube supports.<br>
Horizontal tube heaters are used in such processes as "cracking" ethylene<br>
dichloride (EDC) into vinyl chloride for use as fibers and plastics (such a heater is<br>
referred to as an EDC furnace), vaporizing sulfur in petrochemical applications,<br>
heating coking feedstock, and the like. One example of a horizontal tube heater,<br>
used for heating coking feedstock, is illustrated in U.S. Patent No. 5,078,857, to<br>
Melton.<br>
As a practical matter, most horizontal tube heaters will contain a<br>
convection section in addition to the radiant section. In the convection section,<br>
which is employed downstream and at a higher elevation than the radiant section,<br>
a convective tube coil (or coils) is exposed to a flow of hot exhaust from<br>
combustion in the radiant section.<br>
In many horizontal tube heater applications, such as those mentioned<br>
above, the tube and tube supports are subjected to harsh operating or<br>
environmental conditions. These conditions can lead to significant corrosion, and<br>
wear and tear on the tube and supports, requiring the tube and/or supports to be<br>
periodically replaced--typically after five to ten years of service. In a typical<br>
horizontal tube heater, the replacement of the tube and/or supports is an onerous<br>
task.<br>
For example, U.S. Patent No. 3,384,053, to Fleischer, teaches a double-<br>
fired heater with an offset chimney. A tube coil is top-supported by hinged<br>
supports, which are suspended from the heater structural framework and extend<br>
into the heater through small openings through the heater roof. The openings are<br>
preferably closed around the support with cement. The heater taught by Fleischer<br>
appears to suffer from the same tube-replacement drawbacks as most horizontal<br>
tube heaters. Traditionally, the horizontal lengths of tube have to be cut into<br>
sections and removed longitudinally, one section at a time, through a door in a<br>
furnace end wall. The sectioning, lowering and removal of tube lengths located at<br>
higher elevations in the heater can be difficult and somewhat hazardous. Also, the<br>
replacement tube has to be inserted into and assembled inside the furnace in a<br>
similar manner. Further, because it has not been practical to replace the tube<br>
supports without dismantling the tube or cutting apart the tube support, the task is<br>
still onerous even if only a tube support needs replacement.<br>
Attempts have been made to provide a removable end wall through<br>
which the entire tube coil panel can be removed on slides or rails. These attempts<br>
have generally proven to be costly and impractical. One such attempt is illustrated<br>
in U.S. Patent No. 2,456,787, to Kniel. This patent illustrates a heater, designed<br>
not to employ a convection section, in which one tube coil is double-fired and two<br>
peripheral coils are single-fired (i.e., exposed to flame on one side only) in a<br>
furnace chamber. A pair of exhaust ducts extend from the furnace chamber roof.<br>
The double-fired tube coil is supported in the chamber by coil supports, through<br>
which horizontal lengths of the tube coil extend. The coil supports suspend from a<br>
longitudinal track (located above the furnace chamber between the exhaust ducts)<br>
down through a slot (parallel to the track) in the furnace chamber roof and into the<br>
furnace chamber. The roof slot is normally closed around the supports by hinged<br>
closures, the inner surfaces of which are formed of refractory material. Another<br>
slot, which is also normally closed by a hinged closure with a refractory inner<br>
surface, is provided in the end wall. When the roof slot and end-wall slot closures<br>
are opened, the coil can be removed or inserted through the end-wall slot by<br>
moving the support along the track. This is a complex arrangement, requiring<br>
large openable closures in both the roof and end wall, as well as structure<br>
extending well past the furnace chamber end wall to support the track that carries<br>
the coil as it is removed through the end wall. Further, no provision is made for<br>
interchangeability of the tube supports independently of the tube coil.<br>
Mention should be made of another class of double-fired heaters,<br>
referred to herein as "vertical tube heaters," which utilize tubes arranged in<br>
vertical lengths instead of horizontal. The construction features, applications and<br>
maintenance needs of vertical tube heaters are quite different from horizontal tube<br>
heaters, and, therefore, much of the discussion herein will not apply to vertical<br>
tube heaters. For example, in most vertical tube heaters, the vertical tube lengths<br>
are supported individually from outside the radiant section by a system of linkages<br>
and counterweights. Generally, no support members are employed within the<br>
radiant section of the heater. As with horizontal tube heaters, however, the<br>
vertical lengths are typically longitudinally inserted and removed. Due to the<br>
orientation of the tube lengths, they are typically inserted and removed through<br>
small openings provided in the roof of the radiant section. Some examples are<br>
illustrated in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,230,052 and 3,265,043, both to Lee, et al.;<br>
3,348,923, to Demarest; and 4,955,323, to Ziemianek. No provision is made in<br>
any of these patents for insertion and removal of multiple tube lengths as a unit.<br>
Obviously, with no in-radiant-section tube support, there is also no provision for<br>
interchanging such a support independently of the tube.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need in the art for a horizontal tube heater in which<br>
provision is made for simplified removal and replacement of a worn tube coil<br>
panel.<br>
There is a further need in the art for a horizontal tube heater in which the<br>
coil panel can be removed as a unit, and a replacement canel can similarly<br>
be inserted as a unit.<br>
There is a still further need for a heater in which a tube<br>
support can be removed and replaced independently of the coil panel itself;<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention addresses the foregoing needs in the art by<br>
providing a horizontal tube heater in which the tube coil panel can be removed<br>
and replaced as a unit, and in which the tube supports preferably can be<br>
individually and independently removed and replaced.<br>
In one aspect, this invention provides a double-fired horizontal tube heater<br>
comprising: at least one radiant section having a wall and a roof, said roof<br>
having a longitudinal opening; a radiant heat exchange tube disposed in said at<br>
least one radiant section, said tube having an inlet and an outlet through which a<br>
process fluid can be carried respectively into and out of said at least one radiant<br>
section, said tube between the inlet and outlet being arranged in generally<br>
horizontal tube lengths; a plurality of burners, at least two of the burners being<br>
disposed on opposing sides of said tube; and a plurality of tube supports<br>
releasably positioned at longitudinal intervals along the tube lengths, the tube<br>
supports defining tube seats on which the tube lengths rest,<br>
the tube and tube supports being liftable as a unit through the longitudinal<br>
opening of the roof of said at least one radiant section.<br>
Preferably, the tube lengths are substantially parallel and substantially<br>
aligned vertically, and each tube supportr comprises generally vertical<br>
stanchion. The tube lengths are also preferably substantially aligned with the<br>
longitudinal opening of the roof of the radiant section .<br>
Each tube support can comprise a generally vertidcal stanchion and a<br>
plurality of support arms, the support arms defining the tube seats and betng<br>
releasably fastened to the stanchion.<br>
Preferably, the tube supports are releasably suspended within the radiant<br>
section from above the tube lengths. Each tube support can be laterally<br>
restrained below the tube lengths. In one embodiment, each tube support has an<br>
upper end which extends through the longitudinal opening of the roof. Each tube<br>
support can further have a shoulder affixed to the upper end of the stanchion so<br>
as to be located above the radiant section, wherein the tube support is<br>
suspended from the shoulder. A bridge support member can be removably<br>
secured across the longitudinal opening of the roof of the radiant section,<br>
wherein the shoulder seats on the bridge support member in order to suspend<br>
the tube support.<br>
The heaters can have a convection section containing a convective heat<br>
exchange tube. The convection section is typically above and offset horizontally<br>
from the tube.<br>
In one embodiment, the heater has a pair of the radiant sections; a pair of<br>
the tubes, one tube disposed in each radiant section; a pair of sets of the<br>
burners, one set of burners being disposed in each radiant section; a pair of sets<br>
of the tube supports, one set of tube supports being disposed in each radiant<br>
section; and a pair of convection sections, "each convection section being<br>
operatively connected to a different one of the radiant sections and located<br>
above and offset horizontally from the tube disposed in the connected radiant<br>
section, the pair of convection sections being disposed adjacent to one another.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a heater has at least one radiant<br>
section having a wall and a roof, the roof having a longitudinal opening. A<br>
radiant heat exchange tube is disposed in each radiant section. The tube<br>
has an inlet and outlet through which a process fluid can be carried respectively<br>
into and out of the radiant section. The tube between the inlet and outlet is<br>
arranged in generally horizontal tube lengths, and the tube lengths are<br>
substantially parallel and aligned vertically to form a coil panel that is<br>
generally aligned with the longitudinal opening of the roof of the radiant<br>
section. A plurality of burners, at least two of which are disposed on<br>
opposing sides of the coil panel, are provided. A plurality of tube supports are<br>
releasably positioned at longitudinal intervals along the tube lengths. The tube<br>
supports comprise generally vertical stanchions and support arms extending<br>
from the stanchions, wherein the tube lengths rest on the support arms so that<br>
the tube support supports the coil panel. The coil panel and tube supports<br>
are Iiftable as a unit through the longitudinal opening of the roof of the radiant<br>
section.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of my invention will be<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
My invention will be discussed in the context of an EDC cracking<br>
furnace. However, the principles of my invention are equally applicable to other<br>
horizontal tube heater configurations. FIG. 1 is a schematic sectional front<br>
elevation of such an EDC cracking furnace 1. The furnace 1 has a radiant section<br>
10 and, in a preferred embodiment, a convection section 20.<br>
At least one heat exchange tube 30 forms a coil panel 32 which winds in<br>
horizontal lengths back and forth through the radiant section 10. The coil panel<br>
32 is supported within the radiant section 10 by a plurality of tube supports 40,<br>
which are spaced along the horizontal lengths of the tube 30 and define tube seats<br>
on which the tube 30 rests. The radiant section tube 30 carries a process fluid<br>
(i.e., liquid or gas) from its inlet 34 to its outlet 36 through the radiant section 10.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the tube inlet 34 is located above the tube outlet 36.<br>
However, the principles of my invention apply equally to other arrangements, such<br>
as bottom-to-top process fluid flow.<br>
The radiant section 10 also includes a plurality of burners, some of<br>
which are preferably elevated on a burner platform. The burners, provided on<br>
either side of the coil panel 32, heat the coil panel 32 (and the process fluid<br>
flowing through the radiant section tube 30).<br>
The convection section 20 of the furnace 1 is employed downstream (in<br>
terms of combustion gases) of and at a higher elevation than the radiant section<br>
10. In the convection section 20, a set of convective tube coils 22 is exposed to a<br>
flow of hot exhaust from combustion in the radiant section 10. The exhaust flows<br>
out of the convection section 20 via stack 60.<br>
FIG. 2, a schematic sectional side elevation of the furnace 1 illustrated<br>
in FIG. 1, shows that the radiant section 10 includes a bottom 11, walls 12 and a<br>
roof 14, all of which are lined with suitable refractory material 16. It can be seen<br>
that this embodiment of the furnace 1 actually comprises two substantially identical<br>
furnaces 1a, 1b, arranged back-to-back. The benefits of this arrangement will be<br>
discussed later.<br>
As can be seen in FIG. 2, the horizontal radiant tube 30 lengths are<br>
"stacked" substantially vertically in the coil panel 32. If the furnace 1 employs a<br>
convection section 20, as in the illustrated embodiment, the convection section 20<br>
is offset horizontally from the coil panel 32. A longitudinal opening 18, through<br>
which the coil panel 32 can fit vertically as a unit, is provided in the roof 14 of<br>
the radiant section 10. This combination of features permits the coil panel 32 to<br>
be installed or removed as a prefabricated unit through the longitudinal opening 18<br>
in the roof 14 of the radiant section 10.<br>
In order to further facilitate coil removal/insertion, any structural<br>
bracing 70 that is located above the radiant section 10 is removably fastened (i.e.,<br>
bolted, pinned, or the like) in place. This permits the removal of the structural<br>
bracing 70 during coil panel 32 insertion/removal. Because the coil panel 32<br>
insertion/removal will not be carried out either during furnace 1 operation or<br>
during severe weather, the furnace 1 will not be compromised by the temporary<br>
removal of the bracing 70.<br>
Preferably, the tube supports 40 are suspended from above. Because the<br>
tube coil panel 32 is top-supported, it is a relatively straightforward operation to<br>
transfer the weight of the tube coil panel 32 to a crane or other lifting mechanism.<br>
Thus, this top-supported design is well suited for installation and removal of the<br>
tube coil panel 32 as a unit in a substantially vertical direction through the<br>
longitudinal opening 18. As a practical matter, because the tube supports 40 are<br>
top supported, the most efficient manner to lift and remove the coil panel 32 is by<br>
utilizing the tube supports 40. Thus, the tube supports 40 and coil panel 32 can be<br>
prefabricated and installed as a unit through the longitudinal opening 18 in the<br>
radiant section roof 14. Of course, the longitudinal opening 18 must be sized to<br>
accommodate such a coil panel assembly.<br>
In addition to the foregoing, the top-supported construction of the tube<br>
supports 40 provides additional advantages. One major advantage arises from the<br>
principle that the same weight can be supported by a column having a much<br>
smaller cross section if that column is in tension rather than compression. Thus,<br>
top-supported tube supports 40 can be reduced significantly in size, yet with<br>
increased durability, in comparison to comparable supports that are bottom-<br>
supported. Given the expense of the high alloy steels that must be used in the<br>
radiant section 10 of such a furnace 1, the reduced cross section and increased<br>
lifetime of the tube supports 40 can lead to significant cost savings. In addition,<br>
the reduced size and weight of the tube supports 40 further facilitates installation<br>
and removal of the coil panel 32 through the longitudinal opening 18.<br>
An additional preferable feature of my invention is that the tube supports<br>
40 should be constructed, as described below, so as to permit one of the tube<br>
supports 40 to be removed and replaced through the longitudinal opening 18 while<br>
leaving the coil panel 32 in place in the radiant section 10 of the furnace 1. This<br>
will greatly reduce the time and expense incurred in replacing a worn tube support<br>
40. Because the tube supports 40 are by design redundant (i.e., able to carry the<br>
load of the coil panel 32 in the event of failure of any one of the tube supports<br>
40), the coil panel 32 can temporarily be supported by the remaining tube supports<br>
40 while one tube support 40 is removed and replaced.<br>
Each tube support 40 preferably comprises at least one vertical stanchion<br>
42, from which extends a plurality of support arms 44 that define the tube seats on<br>
which the tube 30 lengths of the coil panel 32 are supported. The stanchion 42<br>
can take any suitable form, well known in the art, such as an I-beam, C-channel,<br>
or the like, but is preferably tubular in shape, and is most preferably centrifugally<br>
cast, so as to better maintain structural integrity and strength in the severe furnace<br>
conditions. The arms 44 are preferably removably attached to the stanchion 42.<br>
By detaching the arms 44 from the stanchions 42, the stanchions 42 can be lifted<br>
straight up through the longitudinal opening 18 in the roof 14 of the radiant section<br>
10 without disturbing the coil panel 32. This permits the stanchions 42 to be<br>
individually removed and replaced while leaving the coil panel 32 intact and in<br>
place in the furnace 1.<br>
One embodiment of the tube support 40 is shown in FIGS. 2 and 4. A<br>
pair of parallel, tubular stanchions 42 is disposed on either side of and supports a<br>
single coil panel 32. A plurality of rungs 44a, extending between the stanchions<br>
42, bears the weight of the coil panel 32. (FIG. 2 only illustrates the rungs 44a at<br>
the top and bottom of the stanchions 42, but in actuality the rungs 44a will be<br>
employed along the entire length of the stanchions 42.) The rungs 44a can take<br>
any suitable form, such as solid rectangular bars or hollow tubes, but are<br>
preferably solid round bars.<br>
Depending upon the type of furnace 1 and the temperatures that will be<br>
encountered, the stanchions 42 and rungs 44a are formed of suitable materials. In<br>
the case of an EDC cracking furnace 1, the stanchions 42 (and preferably the<br>
rungs 44a) should be formed of steel alloy containing chrome and/or nickel,<br>
preferably at least 25% chrome and/or 20% nickel. One suitable alloy is HK40,<br>
an austenitic stainless steel. Other materials, well known to those in the art,<br>
having like or superior thermal strength properties can be employed. In<br>
applications having more severe temperature or load conditions, higher alloys may<br>
be required. The thicknesses of the stanchions 42 and rungs 44a will depend upon<br>
such factors as the height and weight of the coil panel 32, and can be readily<br>
determined by those in the art.<br>
Preferably, the rungs 44a are removably attached to the stanchion 42.<br>
In the illustrated embodiment, each rung 44a extends through opposing holes in<br>
each stanchion 42. Cotter pins 46, for example, can be provided at each end of<br>
the rung 44a to maintain it in place. The rungs 44a can be fastened to the<br>
stanchions 42 in other ways, such as threaded nuts or welded washers. As noted,<br>
providing removably attached rungs 44a permits the stanchions 42 to be<br>
individually removed and replaced through the longitudinal opening 18 in the roof<br>
14 of the radiant section 10 without removing or dismantling the coil panel 32.<br>
As noted above, the stanchions 42 are preferably suspended from above.<br>
It is preferred that whatever structure is employed for primary load-bearing<br>
support be located outside the radiant section 10, because the high temperatures in<br>
the radiant section 10 can lower the yield strength of the materials used to bear the<br>
load. It is also preferred that the stanchions 42 be supported in a manner that<br>
permits withdrawal of the coil panel 32 and/or stanchions 42 when desired. Thus,<br>
I prefer that each stanchion 42 in operation extend out through the longitudinal<br>
opening 18 through which the coil panel 32 can be removed, and that the primary<br>
load-bearing support of the stanchion 42 be provided on the portion of the<br>
stanchion 42 that is above the longitudinal opening 18. FIGS. 3-5 illustrate a<br>
preferred arrangement for achieving this.<br>
A shoulder 80 is affixed to the stanchion 42 at or near its upper end.<br>
The shoulder 80 should extend transversely in at least two, opposing directions<br>
from the stanchion 42. The shoulder 80 can take many forms, such as a collar or<br>
pin at the end of the stanchion 42, but in the preferred embodiment the shoulder<br>
80 is a pair of opposing lug assemblies 82 that are welded to the stanchion 42. In<br>
the embodiment shown in FIGS. 3-5, each lug assembly 82 comprises a vertical<br>
stiffener 84 and a horizontal plate 86 at the base of the stiffener 84. The"<br>
illustrated vertical stiffener 84 is a triangular plate, two edges 84a, 84b of which<br>
are welded to the stanchion 42 and the horizontal plate 86,. respectively. The<br>
horizontal plate 86 has a radius edge 86a that is also welded to the stanchion 42.<br>
. A support surface, on which the stanchion shoulder 80 seats, is provided<br>
on the furnace 1. The support surface can be provided by rails 90 that define the<br>
edges of the longitudinal opening 18 through which the stanchion 42 extends.<br>
However, the rails 90 are far enough apart so that longitudinal opening 18 is wide<br>
enough to permit the entire coil panel assembly (i.e., the coil panel 32 and<br>
stanchions 42) to pass therethrough. Thus, if the rails 90 were to provide the<br>
support surface, the shoulder 80 would have to be able to support the stanchion 42<br>
(and coil panel 32 carried thereby) through a considerable moment arm.<br>
Therefore, it is preferred that the support surface be provided closer to and on<br>
each side of the stanchion 42. This can be accomplished by bridge support<br>
members 92 that traverse the longitudinal opening 18 on either side of the<br>
stanchion 42. In the preferred embodiment, each bridge support member 92 is a<br>
C-shaped channel, open away from the stanchion 42. One leg 92a of the channel<br>
rests on the rails 90 at either edge of the longitudinal opening 18, and the opposite<br>
leg 92b of the channel provides the support surface for the lug assemblies 82.<br>
During operation of furnace 1, the coil panel 32 will expand and<br>
contract as the temperature changes, causing local longitudinal movement of the<br>
tubes 30 relative to the stanchions 42. In order to stabilize the coil panel 32 and<br>
prevent sudden, damaging skipping or binding, the stanchions 42 are preferably<br>
laterally fixed at their top and bottom. At their top, this can be accomplished by<br>
bolting the lug assemblies 82 to the bridge support members 92, and bolting the<br>
bridge support members 92 to the rails 90. At their bottom, the stanchions 42 can<br>
be held steady by guide pins 48 that fit into tubular guide holes 49 at the bottom<br>
11 of the radiant section 10 of the furnace 1, as shown in FIG. 6. The guide pins<br>
48 are free to slide longitudinally in the guide holes 49, thereby permitting thermal<br>
expansion and contraction while restraining horizontal movement. This<br>
arrangement also readily permits the stanchions 42, either carrying or separated<br>
from the coil panel 32, to be lifted away from the bottom of the furnace 1.<br>
Because it is preferred that the stanchions 42 be restrained laterally as<br>
the tubes 30 expand and contract, the relative movement of the tubes 30 will<br>
impart frictional forces on the tube supports 40. The materials and thicknesses of<br>
the tube supports 40 should be selected so as to withstand these frictional forces,<br>
as will be readily apparent to those in the art.<br>
Although it is not necessary to provide an airtight seal of the<br>
longitudinal opening 18 during furnace operation, it is preferable to minimize<br>
airflow through the longitudinal opening 18 to maintain furnace efficiency. This<br>
can be accomplished by a series of closure plates 94 with insulated undersides. A<br>
pair of closure plates 94 are shaped to fit around each tube support 40, and can be<br>
spliced together by any suitable means, such as bolting flat bars across their<br>
interface 94a. The closure plates 94 can be bolted to the underside of the bridge<br>
support members 92.<br>
The lug assemblies 82, bridge support members 92, and closure plates<br>
94 can all be formed of suitable structural steel, such as ASTM A36 structural<br>
carbon steel. The lug assemblies 82, which carry the primary weight-bearing<br>
responsibility can be formed of stronger materials, such as 1 1/4 or 2 1/4 chrome<br>
steel, if weight or temperatures so dictate, as will be apparent to those in the art.<br>
In another embodiment, shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the tube support 40<br>
comprises a single stanchion 42, formed similarly to the previous embodiments,<br>
sandwiched between and supporting a pair of coil panels 32 (a so-called "double-<br>
pass" arrangement). In the tube supports 40 shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, two series<br>
of cast hooks 44b are mounted to opposing sides of the stanchion 42 to bear the<br>
weight of the coil panels 32. As with the rungs 44a of the previous embodiment,<br>
the hooks 44b should be removably attached to the stanchion 42. For example, a<br>
hook 44b can either fit around or into the stanchion 42, and be pinned in place by<br>
a pin 47 that passes completely through both the hook 44b and the stanchion 42.<br>
Cotter pins (not shown), for example, can be provided at one or both ends of the<br>
pin 47 to maintain it in place.<br>
The remaining features of the tube support 40, discussed above in<br>
connection with the embodiments illustrated in FIGS. 2-6, apply to this<br>
embodiment as well.<br>
As noted, the convection section 20 is offset from the radiant coil panel<br>
32. The convection section 20 should be offset at least far enough to permit the<br>
coil panel 32 and/or stanchions 42 to be inserted and removed through the<br>
longitudinal opening 18 without impinging upon the convection section 20. As a<br>
practical matter, it is preferred that the convection section 20 be offset totally from<br>
the radiant section 10, as shown in FIG. 2. In such an arrangement, the convection<br>
section 20 is connected to the radiant section 10 by crossover ducts 24. In addition<br>
to aiding the flow of exhaust into the convection section 20, this arrangement<br>
facilitates individual modular construction and assembly of the convection and<br>
radiant sections 20, 10.<br>
An optional, and independent, aspect of the invention that is particularly<br>
applicable to larger capacity operations is also illustrated in FIGS. 2 and 7. Two<br>
substantially identical furnaces 1a, 1b are arranged back-to-back and can be<br>
operated in parallel. This is particularly useful in constructing furnaces la, lb<br>
employing an offset convection section 20. By orienting the furnaces la, lb with<br>
respective convection sections 20 adjacent to one another, the furnaces la, lb can<br>
structurally stabilize one another. This permits less structural steel to be used in<br>
each furnace la or lb than if it were standing alone.<br>
This dual furnace arrangement has a major advantage in processes such<br>
as EDC cracking, in which the furnaces must be periodically taken off-line and<br>
decoked. By providing operationally independent units, as opposed to some<br>
conventional furnaces having separate radiant sections but a shared convection<br>
section, one furnace can be operated when the other is taken off-line for decoking<br>
or the like.<br>
It is also preferred that a Terrace Wall™ construction, evident in FIGS.<br>
2 and 7, be employed in the furnace 1. The details of this construction are set<br>
forth in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,230,052, 3,265,043, 3,302,621, 3,348,923 and<br>
4,955,323, each of which is incorporated by reference herein in its entirety. This<br>
construction provides several benefits. The burners mounted on the burner<br>
platform fire upward toward the sloped refractory radiant section wall 12,<br>
providing uniform and symmetrical heating to the radiant coil panel 32. This<br>
uniform heating decreases the formation of coke in the coil panel 32, which in turn<br>
increases the service life of the coil panel 32. The absence of flames directly<br>
impinging on the tube 30 also extends service life of coil panel 32. Additionally,<br>
fewer burners are required than in a flat wall furnace, resulting in easier startup<br>
and maintenance. This also reduces the cost of employing "zoned" firing, which<br>
is advantageous to EDC cracking, and combustion air ducts for forced draft<br>
operations, which also improves operating cycle lifetimes. This further results in<br>
fewer burner rows, which simplify the arrangement of burner platforms and,<br>
therefore, facilitate access for maintenance or the like.<br>
Referring again to the embodiment illustrated in FIGS. 2-6, I will<br>
describe an exemplary operation for removing the coil panel 32. Initially, the<br>
removable bracing 70 and the closure plates 94 are unbolted and removed. The<br>
lug assemblies 82 are unbolted from the bridge support members 92, so that the<br>
lug assemblies 82 still bear the weight of the tube supports 40 and coil panel 32<br>
but rest freely on the bridge support members 92. At this point, the stanchions 42<br>
and/or coil panel 32 are rigged to a crane or the like, and lifted slightly so as to<br>
remove the load from the bridge support members 92. The bridge support<br>
members 92 are then unbolted and removed, and the coil panel 32 and tube<br>
supports 40 can then be lifted out through the longitudinal opening 18.<br>
In order to remove a stanchion 42 but not the coil panel 32, the rungs<br>
44a are unpinned and removed from the stanchion 42. If necessary, the lug<br>
assemblies 82 can first be unbolted from the bridge support members 92, and<br>
some of the stanchions 42 (but not the one being removed) and/or the coil panel<br>
32 can be rigged to a crane or the like and lifted slightly so as to remove the load<br>
from the rungs 44a of the stanchion to be removed 42. Once the rungs 44a are<br>
unpinned and removed from the stanchion 42, the stanchion 42 can be lifted out<br>
through the longitudinal opening 18 with the closure plates 94 and bridge support<br>
members 92 still in place.<br>
While the present invention has been described with respect to what is at<br>
present considered to be the preferred embodiments, it should be understood that<br>
