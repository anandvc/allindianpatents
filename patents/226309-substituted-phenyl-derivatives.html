Substituted phenyl derivatives<br>
It is known that substituted phenyl derivatives can have herbicidal and plant-growth-regulating properties (cf., for example, DE 3602-379-A, JP 10007657, US 5698495, US 5786392, WO 9718196). However, on application, these compounds frequently have disadvantages, such as, for example, long persistency, insufficient selectivity in important crops of useful plants or lack of activity against harmful plants.<br>
This invention now provides phenyl derivatives substituted in a particular manner which can be used advantageously as herbicides and plant growth regulators.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides compounds of the formula (I) and/or salts thereof<br>

The reduction of nitriles to amines has been described extensively in the literature (see, for example, Eugen Muller, Methoden der organischen Chemie [Methods of Organic Chemistry] (Houben-Weyl) Volume XI/1, Nitrogen compounds II, p. 343 ff., Georg Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart 1957). Suitable are, inter alia, nobie-metal-catalyzed hydrogenations, palladium- and platinum-<br><br>
catalyzed reactions being of particular interest; however, reductions using Raney-nickel are also possible. Furthermore possible are reductions by complex hydride reagents, such as, for example, lithium aluminum hydride, borane-THF complex, superhydride or diborane. The reduction can be carried out at temperatures of 0 -250°C and at pressures of 1 -100 bar.<br>

General and special chemical methods of acylation are described, for example, in: Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistry (Reaction, Mechanisms and Structure) 4th Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992.<br>
If, for example, a compound of the formula (VI) is hydrolyzed and reacted with an amine NH2-R12, the course of the reaction giving compounds of the formula (I) where Y = CO and B = NHR12 in the process (e) according to the invention can be described by the formula scheme below:<br><br>
The formula (VI) provides a general definition of the benzonitrile derivatives used as starting materials in the process (e) according to the invention for preparing compounds of the formula (I). In the formula (VI), R1, R2, A and X have the meanings given above in formula (I), including the given preferred ranges. The<br><br>
compounds of the formula (VI) can be prepared by known processes (see, for example, Russ. J. Org. Chem. 32, 1996, pp. 1505 -1509). The hydrolysis of nitriles to carboxylic acids has been described extensively in the literature (see, for example, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 107 (1985) 7967ff., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 78 (1956) 450ff., J. Org. Chem. 51 (1986)4169ff., Org. Synth. Collect. Vol. 1 -4). The reaction of the compounds of the formulae (VIII) and (IX) is preferably carried out in an inert organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dichloromethane, 1,2-dichloroethane, chloroform or dimethylformamide, at temperatures between -10°C and the boiling point of the solvent, preferably of from 0°C to 60°C, where in the first reaction step the carboxylic acid of the formula (VIII) is converted into the corresponding acid halide. The acid halide is prepared in accordance with processes known from the literature, using, for example, oxalyl chloride, thionyl chloride, phosphorus pentachloride, phosphorus oxychloride or phosphorus tribromide in the presence of catalytic or equimolar amounts of dimethylformamide for the halogenation. Subsequently, the product is reacted with the amine of the formula (IX) where R12 is as defined in formula (I), preferably in the presence of bases or basic catalysts. Suitable bases or basic catalysts are alkali metal carbonates, alkali metal alkoxides, alkaline earth metal carbonates, alkaline earth metal alkoxides or organic bases, such as triethylamine, 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU) or 4-dimethylaminopyridine (DMAP). The base in question is, for example, employed in a range of from 0.1 to 3 molar equivalents, based on the compound of the formula (III). The compound of the formula (IX) can, based on the compound of the formula (VIII), be employed, for example, in equimolar amounts or in an excess of up to 2 molar equivalents. The corresponding processes are known in principle from the literature (compare: Organikum, VEB Deutscher Verlag der Wissenschaften, Berlin 1988, Jerry March, Advanced Organic Chemistry (Reaction, Mechanisms and Structure) 4th Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, 1992).<br>
If, for example, a compound of the formula (VI) is reacted with an organometallic compound (for example Grignard reagents, organozinc compounds or organolithium compounds), the course of the reaction giving compounds of the formula (I) where Y<br><br>
= CO in the process (f) according to the invention can be described by the formula scheme below<br><br>
The formula (VI) provides a general definition of the benzonitrile derivatives used as starting materials in the process (f) according to the invention for preparing compounds of the formula (I). In the formula (VI), R1, R2, A and X have the meanings given above in formula (I), including the given preferred ranges. The organometallic compounds used, for example of the formula B-Mg-Br, B-Li or B-Zn-Cl, are commercially available and/or obtainable by known processes (see, for example, M. Schlosser: Organometallics in Synthesis, John Wiley &amp; Sons 1994). The compounds of the formula (VI) can be prepared by known processes (see, for example, Russ. J. Org. Chem. 32, 1996, pp. 1505 -1509). The conversion of benzonitriles, for example into benzophenone derivatives, has been described extensively in the literature (see, for example, Tetrahedron Lett. 2000, 41 (6), 937-939; J. Org. Chem. 2000, 65 (12), 3861-3863; Synth. Commun. 1998, 28 (21), 4067-4075; J. Med. Chem. 1998, 41 (22), 4400-4407; Synth. Commun. 1996, 26 (4), 721-727; Synthesis (1991) 1, 56-58; Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. Engl. 1965, 4, 1077; J. Am. Chem. Soc.  1970, 92, 336). The reaction of compounds of the formula (VI) with the organometallic compounds is preferably carried out in an inert organic solvent, such as tetrahydrofuran (THF), dioxane, diethyl ether or diisopropyl ether, at temperatures between -78°C and the boiling point of the solvent, preferably at from 0°C to 120°C. The reaction can be carried out in the absence or presence of a catalyst, such as, for example, Lil, Cul or CuBr.<br>
Collections of compounds of the formula (I) and salts thereof which can be synthesized by the abovementioned schemes may also be prepared in a parallel manner and this may be effected manually or in a semiautomated or fully automated<br><br>
manner. In this case, it is possible, for example, to automate the procedure of the reaction, the work-up or the purification of the products or of the intermediates. In total, this is to be understood as meaning a procedure as is described, for example, by S.H. DeWitt in "Annual Reports in Combinatorial Chemistry and Molecular Diversity: Automated Synthesis", Volume 1, Verlag Escom 1997, pages 69 to 77.<br>
A number of commercially available apparatuses as they are offered by, for example, Stem Corporation, Woodrolfe Road, Tollesbury, Essex, UK, H+P Labortechnik GmbH, Bruckmannring 28, 85764 Oberschleiftheim, Germany or Radleys, Shirehill, Saffron Walden, Essex, CB11 3AZ, UK may be used for the parallel procedure of the reaction and work-up. For the parallel purification of compounds of the formula (I) and their salts, or of intermediates obtained during the preparation, use may be made, inter alia, of chromatography apparatuses, for example those from ISCO, Inc., 4700 Superior Street, Lincoln, NE 68504, USA.<br>
The apparatuses mentioned lead to a modular procedure in which the individual process steps are automated, but manual operations have to be performed between the process steps. This can be avoided by employing semi-integrated or fully integrated automation systems where the automation modules in question are operated by, for example, robots. Such automation systems can be obtained, for example, from Zymark Corporation, Zymark Center, Hopkinton, MA 01748, USA.<br>
In addition to what has been described here, compounds of the formula (I) and/or salts thereof may be prepared in part or fully by solid-phase-supported methods. For this purpose, individual intermediate steps or all intermediate steps of the synthesis or of a synthesis adapted to suit the procedure in question are bound to a synthetic resin. Solid-phase-supported synthesis methods are described extensively in the specialist literature, for example Barry A. Bunin in "The Combinatorial Index", Verlag \cademic Press, 1998. The use of solid-phase-supported synthesis methods Dermits a series of protocols which are known from the literature and which, in turn, :an be performed manually or in an automated manner. For example, the "tea-bag nethod" (Houghten, US 4,631,211; Houghten et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci, 1985, 82,<br><br>
5131-5135), in which products from IRORI, 11149 North Torrey Pines Road, La Jolla, CA 92037, USA, are employed, may be semiautomated. The automation of solid-phase-supported parallel syntheses is performed successfully, for example, by apparatuses from Argonaut Technologies, Inc., 887 Industrial Road, San Carlos, CA 94070, USA or MultiSynTech GmbH, Wullener Feld 4, 58454 Witten. Germany.<br>
The preparation methods described here give compounds of the formula (I) and/or their salts in the form of collections of substances known as libraries. The present invention also relates to libraries which contain at least two compounds of the formula (I) and/or their salts.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention and/or their salts, hereinbelow together referred to as compounds according to the invention, have excellent herbicidal activity against a broad spectrum of economically important monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous harmful plants. The compounds according to the invention also act efficiently on perennial weeds which produce shoots from rhizomes, root stocks or other perennial organs and which are difficult to control. In this context, it is possible for the compounds according to the invention to be applied, for example, pre-sowing, pre-emergence or post-emergence, for example to the plants, to plant seeds or to the area in which the plants grow. Specifically, examples may be mentioned of some representatives of the monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed flora which can be controlled by the compounds according to the invention, without these being a restriction to certain species.<br>
Examples of weed species on which the active compounds act efficiently are, from amongst the monocotyledons, Avena, Lolium, Alopecurus, Phalaris, Echinochloa, Digitaria, Setaria and also Bromus species and Cyperus species from the annual sector and from amongst the perennial species Agropyron, Cynodon, Imperata and Sorghum, and also perennial Cyperus species.<br>
In the case of the dicotyledonous weed species, the spectrum of action extends to species such as, for example, Galium, Viola, Veronica, Lamium, Stellaria, Amaranthus, Sinapis, Ipomoea, Matricaria, Abutilon and Sida from amongst the<br><br>
annuals, and Convolvulus, Cirsium, Rumex and Artemisia in the case of the perennial weeds.<br>
The active ingredients according to the invention also effect outstanding control of harmful plants which occur under the specific conditions of rice growing such as, for example, Echinochloa, Sagittaria, Alisma, Eleocharis, Scirpus and Cyperus.<br>
If the compounds according to the invention are applied to the soil surface prior to germination, then the weed seedlings are either prevented completely from emerging, or the weeds grow until they have reached the cotyledon stage but then their growth stops, and, eventually, after three to four weeks have elapsed, they die completely.<br>
If the active compounds are applied post-emergence to the green parts of the plants, growth also stops drastically a very short time after the treatment and the weed plants remain at the developmental stage of the point in time of application, or they die completely after a certain time, so that in this manner competition by the weeds, which is harmful to the crop plants, is eliminated at a very early point in time and in a sustained manner.<br>
Although the compounds according to the invention have an excellent herbicidal activity against monocotyiedonous and dicotyledonous weeds, crop plants of economically important crops, for example, dicotyledonous crops such as soybean, cotton, oilseed rape, sugar beet, in particular soybean or gramineous crops such as wheat, barley, oats, rye, rice or corn, are not damaged at all, or only to a negligible extent. For these reasons, the present compounds are highly suitable for selectively controlling undesired plant growth (e.g. weeds) in plantings for agricultural use or in plantings of ornamentals.<br>
In addition, the substances according to the invention have outstanding growth-regulating properties in crop plants. They engage in the plant metabolism in a regulating manner and can thus be employed for the targeted control of plant constituents and for facilitating harvesting, for example by provoking desiccation and<br><br>
stunted growth. Furthermore, they are also suitable for generally regulating and inhibiting undesirable vegetative growth, without destroying the plants in the process. Inhibition of vegetative growth plays an important role in many monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous crops because lodging can be reduced hereby, or prevented completely.<br>
Owing to their herbicidal and plant growth-regulatory properties, the active compounds according to the invention can also be employed for controlling harmful plants in crops of known or still to be developed genetically engineered plants. The transgenic plants generally have particularly advantageous properties, for example resistance to certain pesticides, in particular certain herbicides, resistance to plant diseases or causative organisms of plant diseases, such as certain insects or microorganisms such as fungi, bacteria or viruses. Other particular properties relate, for example, to the quantity, quality, storage-stability, composition and to specific ingredients of the harvested product. Thus, transgenic plants having an increased starch content or a modified quality of the starch or those having a different fatty acid composition of the harvested product are known.<br>
The use of the compounds according to the invention in economically important transgenic crops of useful and ornamental plants, for example of cereals, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, millet, rice, maniok and corn, or else in crops of sugar beet, cotton, soybean, oilseed rape, potato, tomato, pea and other vegetable species is preferred.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can preferably be used as herbicides in crops of useful plants which are resistant or which have been made resistant by genetic engineering toward the phytotoxic effects of the herbicides.<br>
Conventional ways of preparing novel plants which have modified properties compared to known plants comprise, for example, traditional breeding methods and the generation of mutants. Alternatively, novel plants having modified properties can be generated with the aid of genetic engineering methods (see, for example,<br><br>
EP-A 0 221 044, EP-A 0 131 624). For example, there have been described several<br>
cases of<br>
genetically engineered changes in crop plants in order to modify the starch<br>
synthesized in the plants (for example WO 92/11376, WO 92/14827 and<br>
WO 91/19806),<br>
transgenic crop plants which are resistant to certain herbicides of the<br>
glufosinate- (cf., for example, EP-A 0 242 236, EP-A 0 242 246) or<br>
glyphosate-type (WO 92/00377), or of the sulfonylurea-type<br>
(EP-A 0 257 993, US-A 5013659),<br>
transgenic crop plants, for example cotton, having the ability to produce<br>
Bacillus thuringiensis toxins (Bt toxins) which impart resistance to certain<br>
pests to the plants (EP-A 0 142 924, EP-A 0 193 259),<br>
transgenic crop plants having a modified fatty acid composition<br>
(WO 91/13972).<br>
Numerous molecular biological techniques which allow the preparation of novel transgenic plants having modified properties are known in principle; see, for example, Sambrook et al., 1989, Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed. Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, NY; or Winnacker "Gene und Klone" [Genes and Clones], VCH Weinheim, 2nd edition 1996, or Christou, "Trends in Plant Science" 1 (1996) 423-431).<br>
In order to carry out such genetic engineering manipulations, it is possible to introduce nucleic acid molecules into plasmids which allow a mutagenesis or a change in the sequence to occur by recombination of DNA sequences. Using the abovementioned standard processes it is possible, for example, to exchange bases, to remove partial sequences or to add natural or synthetic sequences. To link the DNA fragments with each other, it is possible to attach adaptors or linkers to the fragments.<br>
Plant cells having a reduced activity of a gene product can be prepared, for example, by expressing at least one appropriate antisense-RNA, a sense-RNA to<br><br>
achieve a cosuppression effect, or by expressing at least one appropriately constructed ribozyme which specifically cleaves transcripts of the abovementioned gene product.<br>
To this end, it is possible to employ both DNA molecules which comprise the entire coding sequence of a gene product including any flanking sequences that may be present, and DNA molecules which comprise only parts of the coding sequence, it being necessary for these parts to be long enough to cause an antisense effect in the cells. It is also possible to use DNA sequences which have a high degree of homology to the coding sequences of a gene product but which are not entirely identical. When expressing nucleic acid molecules in plants, the synthesized protein can be localized in any desired compartment of the plant cell. However, to achieve localization in a certain compartment, it is, for example, possible to link the coding region with DNA sequences which ensure localization in a certain compartment. Such sequences are known to the person skilled in the art (see, for example, Braun et al., EMBO J. H (1992), 3219-3227; Wolter et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 85 (1988), 846-850; Sonnewald et al., Plant J. 1(1991), 95-106). The transgenic plant cells can be regenerated to whole plants using known techniques. The transgenic plants can in principle be plants of any desired plant species, i.e. both monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.<br>
In this manner, it is possible to obtain transgenic plants which have modified properties by overexpression, suppression or inhibition of homologous (= natural) genes or gene sequences or by expression of heterologous (= foreign) genes or gene sequences.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can preferably be used in transgenic crops which are resistant to herbicides selected from the group consisting of the sulfonylureas, glufosinate-ammonium orglyphosate-isopropylammonium and analogous active compounds.<br><br>
When using the active compounds according to the invention in transgenic crops, in addition to the effects against harmful plants which can be observed in other crops, there are frequently effects which are specific for the application in the respective transgenic crop, for example a modified or specifically broadened spectrum of weeds which can be controlled, modified application rates which can be used for the application, preferably good combinability with the herbicides to which the transgenic crops are resistant, and an effect on the growth and the yield of the transgenic crop plants.<br>
The invention therefore also provides for the use of the compounds according to the invention as herbicides for controlling harmful plants in transgenic crop plants.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be applied in various customary formulations, for example in the form of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, sprayable solutions, dusts or granules. The invention therefore also provides herbicidal and plant-growth-regulating compositions comprising the compounds according to the invention.<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be formulated in various ways depending on the prevailing biological and/or chemico-physical parameters. Examples of suitable formulation options are: wettable powders (WP), water-soluble powders (SP), water-soluble concentrates, emulsifiable concentrates (EC), emulsions (EW).. such as oil-in-water and water-in-oil emulsions, sprayable solutions, suspension concentrates (SC), oil- or water-based dispersions, oil-miscible solutions, capsule suspensions (CS), dusts (DP), seed-dressing compositions, granules for broadcasting and soil application, granules (GR) in the form of microgranules, spray granules, coating granules and adsorption granules, water-dispersible granules (WG), water-soluble granules (SG), ULV formulations, microcapsules and waxes.<br>
These individual formulation types are known in principle and are described, for example, in Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th edition 1986; Wade van Valkenburg,<br><br>
"Pesticide Formulations", Marcel Dekker, N.Y., 1973; K. Martens, "Spray Drying" Handbook, 3rd ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London.<br>
The necessary formulation auxiliaries, such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives, are likewise known and are described, for example, in: Watkins, "Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers", 2nd ed., Darland Books, Caldwell N.J., H.v. Olphen, "Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry"; 2nd ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y.; C. Marsden, "Solvents Guide"; 2nd ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1963; McCutcheon's "Detergents and Emulsifiers Annual", MC Publ. Corp., Ridgewood N.J.; Sisley and Wood, "Encyclopedia of Surface Active Agents", Chem. Publ. Co. Inc., N.Y. 1964; Schonfeldt, "Grenzflachenaktive Athylenoxidaddukte" [Surface-active ethylene oxide adducts], Wiss. VerlagsgeselL, Stuttgart 1976; Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. Hauser Verlag Munich, 4th edition 1986.<br>
Based on these formulations it is also possible to produce combinations with other pesticidally active substances, for example insecticides, acaricides, herbicides and fungicides, and also with safeners, fertilizers and/or growth regulators, for example in the form of a ready-mix or tank mix.<br>
Wettable powders are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which contain, in addition to the active compound and as well as a diluent or inert substance, surfactants of ionic and/or nonionic type (wetting agents, dispersants), for example polyethoxylated alkyl phenols, polyethoxylated fatty alcohols, polyethoxylated fatty amines, fatty alcohol polyglycol ether sulfates, alkanesulfonates, alkylbenzenesulfonates, sodium lignosulfonate, sodium 2,2'-dinaphthylmethane-6,6'-disulfonate, sodium dibutylnaphthalenesulfonate or else sodium oleoylmethyltaurinate. To prepare the wettable powders, the herbicidally active compounds are finely ground, for example in customary apparatus such as hammer mills, fan mills and air-jet mills, and are mixed simultaneously or subsequently with the formulation auxiliaries.<br><br>
Emulsifiable concentrates are prepared by dissolving the active compound in an organic solvent, for example butanol, cyclohexanone, dimethylformamide, xylene or else relatively high-boiling aromatics or hydrocarbons or mixtures of the organic solvents, with the addition of one or more surfactants of ionic and/or nonionic type (emulsifiers). Examples of emulsifiers which can be used are calcium alkylarylsulfonates, such as Ca dodecylbenzenesulfonate, or nonionic emulsifiers, such as fatty acid polyglycol esters, alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, fatty alcohol polyglycol ethers, propylene oxide-ethylene oxide condensation products, alkyl polyethers, sorbitan esters, for example sorbitan fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters, for example polyoxyethylene sorbitan fatty acid esters.<br>
Dusts are obtained by grinding the active compound with finely divided solid substances, for example talc, natural clays, such as kaolin, bentonite and pyrophyllite, or diatomaceous earth.<br>
Suspension concentrates can be water- or oil-based. They can be prepared, for example, by wet milling using commercially customary bead mills, with or without the addition of surfactants as already mentioned above, for example, in the case of the other formulation types.<br>
Emulsions, for example oil-in-water emulsions (EW), can be prepared for example by means of stirrers, colloid mills and/or static mixers using aqueous organic solvents and, if desired, surfactants as already mentioned above, for example, in the case of the other formulation types.<br>
Granules can be prepared either by spraying the active compound onto adsorptive, granulated inert material or by applying active-compound concentrates to the surface of carriers such as sand, kaolinites or granulated inert material, by means of adhesive binders, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or else mineral oils. Suitable active compounds can also be granulated in the manner which is customary for the preparation of fertilizer granules, if desired as a mixture with fertilizers.<br><br>
Water-dispersible granules are generally prepared by the customary processes, such as spray-drying, fluidized-bed granulation, disk granulation, mixing using highspeed mixers, and extrusion without solid inert material.<br>
For the preparation of disk, fluidized-bed, extruder and spray granules, see for example processes in "Spray-Drying Handbook" 3rd ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd., London; J.E. Browning, "Agglomeration", Chemical and Engineering 1967, pages 147 ff; "Perry's Chemical Engineer's Handbook", 5th ed., McGraw-Hill, New York 1973, pp. 8-57.<br>
For further details on the formulation of crop protection products, see for example G.C. Klingman, "Weed Control as a Science", John Wiley and Sons., Inc., New York, 1961, pages 81-96 and J.D. Freyer, SA Evans, "Weed Control Handbook", 5th ed., Blackwell Scientific Publications, Oxford, 1968, pages 101-103. The agrochemical formulations generally contain from 0.1 to 99% by weight, in particular from 0.1 to 95% by weight, of active compound of the formula (I) and/or their salts.<br>
In wettable powders the concentration of active compound is, for example, from about 10 to 90% by weight, the remainder to 100% by weight consisting of customary formulation constituents. In emulsifiable concentrates the concentration of active compound can be from about 1 to 90%, preferably from 5 to 80%, by weight. Formulations in the form of dusts contain from 1 to 30% by weight of active compound, preferably most commonly from 5 to 20% by weight of active compound, while sprayable solutions contain from about 0.05 to 80%, preferably from 2 to 50%, by weight of active compound. In the case of water-dispersible granules, the content of active compound depends partly on whether the active compound is in liquid or solid form and on the granulation auxiliaries, fillers, etc. that are used. In water-dispersible granules the content of active compound, for example, is between 1 and 95% by weight, preferably between 10 and 80% by weight. In addition, said formulations of active compound may comprise the tackifiers, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, penetrants, preservatives, antifreeze<br><br>
agents, solvents, fillers, carriers, colorants, antifoams, evaporation inhibitors and pH and viscosity regulators which are customary in each case.<br>

The compounds according to the invention can also be used in combination with one or more compounds which act as safeners. For use, the formulations which are present in commercially available form are, if appropriate, diluted in the customary manner, for example using water in the case of wettable powders, emulsifiable concentrates, dispersions and water-dispersible granules. Preparations in the form of dusts, granules for soil application or broadcasting and sprayable solutions are usually not further diluted with other inert substances prior to use.<br>
The application rate of the compounds according to the invention required varies with the external conditions, such as temperature, humidity, the nature of the herbicide used. It can vary within wide limits, for example between 0.001 and 10.0 kg/ha or more of active substance, but it is preferably between 0.005 and 5 kg/ha.<br>

C.       Biological examples<br>
1.       Pre-e mergence effect on weeds<br>
Seeds or rhizome pieces of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weed plants were placed in sandy loam soil in cardboard pots and covered with soil. The compounds according to the invention which were formulated in the form of wettable powders or emulsion concentrates were then applied to the surface of the soil cover<br><br>
in the form of aqueous suspensions or emulsions at an application rate of 600 to 800 I of water/ha (converted), in various dosages.<br>
After the treatment, the pots were placed in a greenhouse and kept under good growth conditions for the weeds. After the test plants had emerged, the damage to the plants or the negative effect on the emergence was scored visually after a test period of 3 to 4 weeks by comparison with untreated controls. As shown by the test results, compounds according to the invention have good herbicidal pre-emergence activity against a broad spectrum of weed grasses and broad-leafed weeds. For example, the compounds of Example Nos. 62a, 62b, 73d, 74c, 75a, 76a, 77a, 397a, 1136a, 1136c, 1140a, 1140c, 1140d, 1156a, 1161a, 1169a, 1171a, 1177a, 1180a, 1182a and other compounds of Table 1 have very good herbicidal activity against harmful plants such as Sinapis alba, Chrysanthemum segetum, Avena sativa, Stellaria media, Echinochloa crus-galli, Lolium multiflorum, Setaria spp., Abutilon theophrasti, Amaranthus retroflexus and Panicum miliaceum pre-emergence at an application rate of 2 kg and less of active substance per hectare.<br>
2.        Post-emergence effect on weeds<br>
Seeds or rhizome pieces of monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous weeds were placed in sandy loam soil in plastic pots, covered with soil and grown in a greenhouse under good growth conditions. Three weeks after sowing, the test plants were treated at the three-leaf stage. The compounds according to the invention which were formulated as wettable powders or emulsion concentrates were sprayed, at various dosages, onto the green parts of the plants at an application rate of 600 to 800 I of water/ha (converted). After the test plants had remained in the greenhouse for about 3 to 4 weeks under ideal growth conditions, the effect of the preparations was scored visually by comparison with untreated controls. The agents according to the invention also have good herbicidal activity post-emergence against a broad spectrum of economically important weed grasses and broad-leafed weeds. For example, the compounds of Example Nos. 62a, 62b, 73d, 74c, 75a, 76a, 77a, 397a,<br><br>
1136a, 1136c, 1140a, 1140c, 1140d, 1156a, 1161a, 1169a, 1171a, 1177a, 1180a, 1182a and other compounds of Table 1 have very good herbicidal activity against harmful plants such as Sinapis alba, Echinochloa crus-galli, Lolium multiflorum, Chrysanthemum segetum, Avena sativa, Stellaria media, Setaria spp., Abutilon theophrasti, Amaranthus retroflexus and Panicum miliaceum post-emergence at an application rate of 2 kg and less of active substance per hectare.<br>
3. Tolerance by crop plants<br>
In further greenhouse experiments, seeds of a substantial number of crop plants and weeds were placed in sandy loam soil and covered with soil. Some of the pots were treated immediately as described under Section 1, and the remaining pots were placed in the greenhouse until the plants had developed two to three true leaves and then sprayed with various dosages of the compounds according to the invention, as described under Section 2. Visual scoring four to five weeks after the application and after the plants had been in the greenhouse revealed that compounds according to the invention left dicotyledonous crops such as soybean, cotton, oilseed rape, sugar beet or potatoes unharmed even when high dpsages of active ingredient were used by the pre- and post-emergence method. Moreover, some substances also spared Gramineae crops such as barley, wheat, rye, sorghum species, corn or rice. Some of the compounds according to the invention have high selectivity, and they are therefore suitable for controlling undesirable vegetation in agricultural crops.<br><br><br>
