COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
                                                         [See Section 10  RULE   13]<br><br><br><br>
E.I.DU PONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, a Delaware corporation, of 1007 Market Street, Wilmington, Delaware 19898, United Stages of America,<br><br>
The  following specification  particularly describes  and  ascertains  the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br><br>
QUGOMEIUZATION, POLYMERIZATION AND COPQLYMCRIZATION OF SUBSTITUTED AND UNSUD5TITUTED a-METHYLENE-y-BUTYROLACTOMES AND PRODUCTS THEREOF -FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the oligomerization, polymerization and copolymerization of substituted and unsubstituted cc-methylene-y-butyrolactones (MBLs) using cobalt chain transfer catalysts to control molecular weight.<br>
TECHNICAL BACKGROUND<br>
The free radical polymerization of a-methylene-y-butyrolactone, as well as its copolymerization, is described by M. K. Akkapeddi, Polymer, vol. 20, 1979, pp. 1215-1216, and Japanese Patent Application 9012646. However, no catalysts were used and no end-group analyses were disclosed in any of these references.<br>
It is known to use various cobalt complexes (e.g., cobaloximes) as chain transfer catalysts (CTC) to provide macromonomers which provide terminal double bonds for use in polymeric products. See commonly owned U.S. Patent Nos. 5,310,807, 5,362,813, 5,412,039, 5,502,113, and 5,587,431 and WO 9525765. However, no examples of aromatic group formation during catalysis is shown as in the present invention.<br>
The use of cobalt chain transfer catalysts to control the molecular weight of oligomers and polymers is known. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,602,220,5,770,665 and 5,684,101 as well as WO 9613527 disclose this control, but do not teach cc-methylene-y-butyrolactones or aromatic group formation during catalysis. Commonly owned US 5,726,263, and Application Nos. 08/818,860, 09/193,701 and 08/912,593 also disclose this control, but again, do not disclose this particular monomer or aromatic groups formed during catalysis.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for oligomerizing or polymerizing or copolymerizing a-methylene-y-butyrolactones to poly(a-methylene-y-butyrolactones) having controlled molecular weight and aromatic functionality, wherein the process comprises contacting an a-methylene-y-butyrolactone, optionally in the presence of a comonomer, with a free radical initiator and a cobalt chain transfer catalyst, said a-methylene-y-butyrolactone having a structure:<br><br><br>

where R1 and R2 are as defined above, and R3 and R4 are also independently selected from group (I) and group (II), as defined above.<br>
This invention further relates to the products of the processes described.<br>
30	DETAILS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The use of catalytic chain transfer catalysts in the free radical polymerization of vinylic monomers is widely known and well reflected in the art. See, for example, U.S. Patent No. 5,587,431,. U.S. Patent No. 5,362,813, U.S. Patent No. 5,324,879, U.S. Patent No. 5,028,677, and U.S. Patent No. 4,526,945,<br>
3<br><br>
all incorporated by reference herein. Conducted by cobalt complexes of a very-specific structure, the catalysis allows molecular weight (MW) to be effectively controlled. It is also important that .these reactions lead to formation of polymers and oligomers with a terminal double bond strictly one bond per polymer 5      molecule (more than 95% ) as found in T. P. Davis, D. M. Haddleton, S. N. Richards., J. M. S. - Rev. Macromol. Chem. Phys., C34 (1994) 243.<br>
A new monomer, a-methylene-y-butyrolactone, represented in an unsubstituted form is shown in I below,<br><br>
10<br>
Surprisingly it was found that this monomer behaves differently from acrylates or methacrylates, its structural analogues. In case of methacrylates cobalt-catalyzed chain transfer provides polymer with a double bond. Unexpectedly,<br>
15      polymerization of a-methylene-y-butyrolactone under the same conditions gave an oligomer which have aromatic functionality, as indicated by 7.1-7.4 ppm resonance in the proton NMR spectrum, but no isolated double bonds. The NMR data suggests that the cobalt catalyst causes isomerization of the oligomer and polymer in addition to regular hydrogen abstraction from the propagating radical.<br>
20     Therefore, the resulting oligomers have aromatic functionality but no isolated double bonds.<br>
Hence, cobalt chain transfer catalyst provides not only molecular weight control in a-methylene-y-butyrolactone polymerization as shown in the examples herein, but also, unusual functionalization, -- that is to say aromatic<br>
25      functionalization of the polymeric product.<br>
Until recently, wide usage of a-methylene-y-butyrolactone was restricted by its high cost. In recent years interest in polymers made using a-methylene-y-butyrolactone has increased as economically attractive synthetic routes to a-methyiene-y-butyrolactone have been developed. Alpha-methylene-y-<br>
30     butyrolactone is relatively easy to polymerize and copolymerize by free radical mechanism as described herein, to yield polymers with relatively higher glass transition temperatures, Tg. The homopolymer has a Tg of about 200°C.<br>
4<br><br><br>
Alpha-methylene-y-butyrolactones have the general formula<br>
5      wherein R1 and R2 are each independently selected from the group (I) consisting of H, -CH(O), -CN and halogen, and from the group (II) consisting of-C(O)OR5, -C(O)NR6R7, -CR8(O), -C(O)OC(O)R9, -C(O)NR10OCOR11, -OC(O)R12, -OR13, alkyl, substituted alkyl, aryl, and substituted aryl; wherein when R1 or R2 are selected from group (II), R1 and R2 may optionally form a cyclic structure;<br>
10	R5, R6, R7, R8, R9J R10, R11, and R12 are H, alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl<br>
or substituted aryl; R13 is alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl or substituted aryl;<br>
and wherein the alkyl and substituted alkyl are C1-C12, and the substituents on the substituted alkyl or aryl contain no functionality which would substantially<br>
15      interfere with free radical polymerization (e.g., groups known to be free-radical chain terminators such as thiols or nitroxides).<br>
It is preferred that R1 be methyl and R2 be H, and most preferred that both R1 and R2 be H. R1 and R2 may also form a cyclic structure when at least one of R1 and R2 are one of the substituents listed above in group II. This may be<br>
20     illustrated in the following structure:<br><br><br>
25	Alpha-methylene-y-butyrolactone may homooligomerize and<br>
homopolymerize. The product of its homooligomerization is a mixture which consists essentially of<br>

R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, R10, R11 , and R'2 are H, alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl or substituted aryl; R13 is alkyl, aryl, substituted alkyl or substituted aryl; and<br>
wherein the alkyl and substituted alkyl are C1-C12, and the substituents on the substituted alkyl or aryl contain no functionality which would substantially interfere widi free radical polymerization (e.g., groups known to be free-radical chain terminators such as thiols or nitroxides). The depiction of the structures is not meant to imply anything about the arrangement of the monomers along the oligomer backbone.<br>
Alpha-methylene-y-butyrolactone may also co-oligomerize and copolymerize with a variety of monomers and comonomers. These cooligomers would yield products containing &gt; 10% of the following structure:<br><br>

as not to destroy the metal chelate chain transfer catalyst, is typically also employed in preparing the polymers. Suitable initiators are azo compounds having the requisite solubility and appropriate half life, including azocumene; 2,2'-azobis(2-methyl)-butanenitrile;2,2'-azobis(isobutyronitrile)(AlBN);<br>
10     4,4'-azobis(4-cyanovaleric acid); 2-(t-butylazo)-2-cyanopropane; 1,1'-<br>
azobis(cyclohexane-l-carbonitrile) and other compounds known to those skilled in the art.<br>
The polymerization process, employing the above described metallic chain transfer catalysts, is carried out suitably at a temperature ranging from about room<br>
15     temperature to about 240°C or higher, preferably about 50°C to 150°C. The<br>
polymers made by the inventive process are typically prepared in a polymerization reaction by standard solution polymerization techniques, but may also be prepared by emulsion, suspension or bulk polymerization processes. The polymerization process can be carried out as either a batch, semi-batch, or continuous process<br>
20     (CSTR). When carried out in the batch process, the reactor is typically charged with metal chain transfer catalyst, a monomer, optionally with a solvent. To the mixture is then added the desired amount of initiator, typically such that the monomer-to-initiator ratio is 5 to 1000. The mixture is then heated for the requisite time, usually from about 30 minutes to about 12 hours. In a batch<br>
25     process, the reaction may be run under pressure to avoid monomer reflux.<br>
As indicated above, the polymerization can be carried out in the absence of, or in the presence of, any medium or solvent suitable for free-radical polymerization, including, but not limited to, ketones such as acetone, butanone, pentanone and hexanone; alcohols such as isopropanol; amides such as dimethyl<br>
30     formamide; aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene; ethers such as tetrahydrofuran and diethyl ether; ethylene glycol; dialkyl ethers such as CELLOSOLVES® solvent, alkyl esters or mixed ester ethers such as monoalkyl ether-monoalkanoates; and mixtures of two or more solvents.<br>
The oligomers, polymers and/or copolymers prepared according to the<br>
35     present invention can be employed, not only as non-metallic chain transfer agents, but as useful components or intermediates in the production of graft copolymers, non-aqueous dispersed polymers, block copolymers, microgels, star polymers, branched polymers, and ladder polymers.<br>
10<br><br>
Aromatic groups formed in poly(a-methylene-y-butyrolactone) and copolymers comprised of a-methylene-y-butyrolactone can be further transformed into amino, nitro, sulfo, and other groups applying well known synthetic methods. See generally J. March, "Advanced Organic Chemistry: Reactions, Mechanisms 5      and Structure", 4th ed., Wiley Interscience, New York, 1992, p. 641. Such<br>
polymers can be used as compatibilizers, surfactants, dispersants, emulsifiers and building blocks in the syntheses of liquid crystals, adhesives, block- and graft-copolymers.<br>
Oligomers, macromonomers and polymers made by the present process are<br>
10     useful in a wide variety of coating and molding resins. Polymers, such as those produced in this invention would find use in, for example, structured polymers for use as pigment dispersants. Other potential uses can include cast, blown, spun or sprayed applications in fiber, film, sheet, composite materials, multilayer coatings,, photopolymerizable materials, photoresists, surface active agents, dispersants,<br>
15      adhesives, adhesion promoters, coupling agents, and others. End products taking advantage of available characteristics can include, for example, automotive and architectural coatings or finishes, including high solids, aqueous, or solvent based finishes.<br>

20	The freeze-pump-thaw cycle as used in the examples below is described in<br>
D.F. Shriver, et al., "The Manipulation of Air Sensitive Compounds", 2nd ed., Wiley Interscience, 1986.<br>
JH-NMR spectra were taken on a QE300 NMR spectrometer (General Electric Co., Freemont, CA 94539) at 300 MHz frequency.<br>
25	K+IDS mass spectroscopy is an ionization method that produces<br>
pseudomolecular ions in the form of [MjK+ with little or no fragmentation. Intact organic molecules are desorbed by rapid heating. In the gas phase the organic molecules are ionized by potassium attachment. Potassium ions are generated from an aluminosilicate matrix that contains K2O. All of these experiments were<br>
30      performed on a Finnegan Model 4615 GC/MS quadrupole mass spectrometer<br>
(Finnegan MAT (USA), San Jose, CA). An electron impact source configuration operating at 200°C and a source pressure of <lxl0 torr was used.></lxl0>
MW and DP measurements were based on size exclusion chromatography (SEC) using styrene as a standard, and performed on a WISP 712 Chromatograph<br>

COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE A No Co CTC Used A degassed 50% solution of a-methylene-y-butyrolactone in 1,2-dichloro-ethane with 3.25 g/1 of AIBN as an initiator was kept for 2 hours at 60°C. During 15     polymerization white polymer precipitated from the solution. The polymer was collected and dried in high vacuum. Proton NMR spectroscopy of poly(a-methylene-Y-butyrolactone) detected some residual monomer (6.07 and 5.74 ppm) or no aromatic species. Size exclusion chromatography (SEC) showed that the number average molecular weight of the product, Mn=l 01,000 and 20     weight average molecular weight was Mn=210,000.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Co CTC Used<br>
A degassed 50% solution of a-methylene-y-butyrolactone in 1,2-dichloro-<br>
ethane with 3.25 g/1 of AIBN as an initiator and 0.05 g/1 of TAPCo as a chain<br>
25     transfer agent was kept for 8 hours at 60°C. The reaction mixture was evaporated<br>
under high vacuum and resulted in a viscous liquid. Proton NMR spectroscopy<br>
detected no residual monomer but did show a substantial amount of aromatic<br>
species, as indicated by 7.15, 7.38 and 7.4 ppm resonance. SEC showed that the<br>
number average molecular weight of the product was Mn 
30	EXAMPLE 2<br>
Higher Concentration of Co CTC Used A degassed 50% solution of a-methylene-y-butyrolactone in 1,2-dichloro-ethane with 3.25 g/1 of AIBN as an initiator and 0.01 g/1 of TAPCo as a chain transfer agent was kept at 60°C until polymerization was complete, i.e., when the 35     reaction no longer produced heat. The reaction mixture was evaporated under<br>
high vacuum and resulted in a viscous liquid. Proton NMR spectroscopy detected no residual monomer but indicated some aromatic species with proton signals at 7.3-7.7 ppm region. SEC indicated that the number average degree of<br>
12<br><br>
WO 00/35960	PCT/US99/28243<br>
polymerization, DPn=38. Comparison of the NMR signals gives 1:14 ratio between aromatic protons (&gt;7.1 ppm) and aliphatic -CH2O- protons (4.2-5.0 ppm) in the polymer. This ratio increases as DPn decreases, indicating that the number of aromatic protons is likely to be constant per polymer chain. Since the Co CTC 5     terminates the propagation of the radicals, but no vinylic protons are formed, it was concluded that the aromatic group is located at the end of the polymer.<br>

butyrolactone and 33% methyl acrylate with 3 g/1 of VAZO®-88 as an initiator and 0.02 g/1 of COBF as a chain transfer agent was kept at 90°C for 8 hours. The reaction mixture was evaporated in high vacuum to give transparent polymer. Proton NMR spectroscopy of the polymer detected no residual monomer or other 15      vinylic species but did detect some aromatic species with proton signals at 7.1 -7.4 ppm region. K*IDS analysis that about 70% of the polymer product contain one a-methylene-y-butyrolactone unit per chain.<br>

The reaction mixture was filtered and evaporated under high vacuum and resulted in a viscous liquid. Proton NMR spectroscopy detected no residual monomer or other vinylic species, but did detect some aromatic species with 35     proton signals at 7.1 -7.5 ppm region. K.TDS analysis showed that the product consisted mostly of vinyiidene chloride/a-methylene-y-butyrolactone dimer.<br>
