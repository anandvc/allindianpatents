COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"MACROCYCLIC PEPTIDES ACTIVE AGAINST THE HEPATITIS C VIRUS"<br>
BOEHRINGER INGELHEIM (CANADA) LTD., of 2100 Cunard Street, Laval, Quebec H7S 2G5, Canada<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :-<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to compounds, compositions, the preparation of such compounds and methods for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. In particular, the present invention provides novel peptide analogues, pharmaceutical compositions containing such analogues and methods for using these analogues in the treatment of HCV infection.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hepatitis C virus (HCV) is the major etiological agent of post-transfusion and community-acquired non-A non-B hepatitis worldwide. It is estfinated that over 170 million people worldwide are infected by the virus. A high percentage of earners become chronically infected and many progress to chronic liver disease, so-called chronic hepatitis C. This group is in turn at high risk for serious liver disease such as liver cirrhosis, hepatocellular carcinoma and terminal liver disease leading to death.<br>
The mechanism by which HCV establishes viral persistence and causes a high rate of chronic liver disease has not been thoroughly elucidated. It is not known how HCV interacts with and evades the host immune system. In addition, the roles of cellular and humoral immune responses in protection' against HCV infection and disease have yet to be established, Imunoglobulins have been reported for prophylaxis of transfusion-associated viral hepatitis, however, the Center for Disease Control does not presently recommend immunoglobulins treatment for this purpose. The lack of an effective protective immune response is hampering the development of a vaccine or adequate post-exposure prophylaxis measures, so in the near-term, hopes are firmly pinned on antiviral interventions.<br>
Various clinical studies have been conducted with the goal of identifying pharmaceutical agents capable of effectively treating HCV infection in patients afflicted with chronic hepatitis C. These studies have involved the use of interferon-alpha, alone and in combination with other antiviral agents. Such studies have shown that a substantial number of the participants do riot respond to these therapies, and of those that do respond favorably, a large proportion were found to<br><br>
relapse after termination of treatment.<br>
Until a few years ago, interferon (IFN) was the only available therapy of proven benefit approved in the clinic for patients with chronic hepatitis C. However the sustained response rate is low, and interferon treatment also induces severe side-effects (i.e. retinopathy, thyroiditis, acute pancreatitis, depression) that diminish the quality of life of treated patients. Interferon in combination with ribavirin was originally approved for patients non-responsive to IFN alone. It has now been approved for naive patients and presently constitutes the gold standard in HCV therapy. However, the side effects caused by IFN are not alleviated with this combination therapy.<br>
Therefore, a need exists for the development of effective antiviral agents for treatment of HCV infection that overcomes the limitations of existing pharmaceutical therapies.<br>
HCV is an enveloped positive strand RNA virus in the Flaviviridae family. The single strand HCV RNA genome is approximately 9500 nucleotides in length and has a single open reading frame (ORF) encoding a single large polyprotein of about 3000 amino acids. In infected cells, this polyprotein is cleaved at multiple sites by cellular and viral proteases to produce the structural and non-structural (NS) proteins. In the case of HCV, the generation of mature nonstructural proteins (NS2, NS3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B) is effected by two viral proteases. The first one, as yet poorly characterized, cleaves at the NS2-NS3 junction; the second one is a serine protease contained within the N-terminal region of NS3 (henceforth referred to as NS3 protease) and mediates all the subsequent cleavages downstream of NS3, both in cis, at the NS3-NS4A cleavage site, and in trans, for the remaining NS4A-NS4B, NS4B-NS5A, NS5A-NS5B sites. The NS4A protein appears to serve multiple functions, acting as a cofactor for the NS3 protease and possibly assisting in the membrane localization of NS3 and other viral replicase components. The complex formation of the NS3 protein with NS4A seems necessary to the processing events, enhancing the proteolytic efficiency at all of the sites. The NS3 protein also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase and RNA helicase activities. NS5B is a RNA-dependent RNA polymerase that is involved in the replication of HCV. Patent application WO 97/06804 describes the (-) enantiomer of the nucleoside<br><br>
analogue cytosine-l,3-oxathiolane (also known as 3TC) as active against HCV. This<br>
compound, although reported as safe in previous clinical trials against HIV and<br>
HBV, has yet to be clinically proven active against HCV and its mechanism of action<br>
against the virus has yet to be reported.<br>
A general strategy for the development of antiviral agents is to inactivate virally<br>
encoded enzymes that are essential for the replication of the virus<br>
In this vein, intense efforts to discover compounds which inhibit the NS3 protease or<br>
RNA helicase of HCV have led to the following disclosures:<br>
US patent 5,633,388 describes heterocyclic-substituted carboxamides and analogues<br>
as being active against HCV. These compounds are directed against the helicase<br>
activity of the NS3 protein of the virus but clinical tests have not yet been reported.<br>
A phenanfhrenequinone has been reported by Chu et al., (Tet Lett., (1996), 7229-<br>
7232) to have activity against the HCV NS3 protease in vitro. No further<br>
development on this compound has been reported.<br>
A paper presented at the Ninth International Conference on Antiviral Research,<br>
Urabandai, Fukyshima, Japan (1996) (Antiviral Research, (1996), 30,1, A23 (abstract<br>
19)) reports thiazolidine derivatives to be inhibitory to the HCV protease.<br>
Several studies have reported compounds inhibitory to other serine proteases, such<br>
as human leukocyte elastase. One family of these compounds is reported in WO<br>
95/33764 (Hoechst Marion Roussel, 1995). The peptides disclosed in that application<br>
are morpholinylcarbonyl-benzoyl-peptide analogues that are structurally different<br>
from the peptides of the present invention.<br>
WO 98/17679 from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc. discloses inhibitors of serine<br>
protease, particularly. Hepatitis C virus NS3 protease<br>
Hoffman LaRoche (WO 98/22496; US 5,866,684 &amp; US 6,018,020) has also reported<br>
hexapeptides that are proteinase inhibitors useful as antiviral agents for the<br>
treatment of HCV infection.<br>
Steinkuhler et al. and Ingallinella et al. have published on NS4A-4B product<br>
inhibition (Biochemistry (1998), 37,8899-8905 and 8906-8914).<br>
WO 97/43310 by Schering Corporation discloses 20 and 21 amino acid peptide<br>
sequences active against the HCV NS3 protease.<br>
WO 98/46597 by Emory University discloses peptides and peptidomimetics active<br><br>
in vitro against serine proteases.<br>
WO 98/46630 by Peptide Therapeutics Limited discloses depsipeptide substrate<br>
inhibiting the HCV NS3 protease.<br>
Finally, US 5,869,253 discloses enzymatic RNA molecules that inhibit the HCV NS3<br>
protease.<br>
None of the prior patent applications described above disclose suggest cyclic<br>
peptides active and selective against the Hepatitis C virus NS3 protease.<br>
WO 99/07733, WO 99/07734, WO 00/09543 and WOOO/09558 disclose hexa to tetra-<br>
peptides and tripeptide analogs that inhibit the NS3 protease. However, these<br>
disclosures do not suggest or lead to the design of macrocyclic analogs of the<br>
present invention.<br>
WO 99/38888 published August 5,1999 by the Institute de Richerche di Biologia<br>
Moleculare (ERBM) discloses small peptides inhibitors of the HCV NS3 protease.<br>
Nothing in this disclosure suggest or indicates the cyclic nature of the peptides of<br>
the present invention. In addition, this PCT application was published after the<br>
priority date of the present application.<br>
WO 99/64442 by IRBM, also published after the priority date of this application,<br>
discloses oligopeptides with ketoacids at PI.<br>
WO 99/50230 from Vertex Pharmaceuticals (published on October 7,1999) was also<br>
published after the priority date of the present application. Even then, the<br>
publication does not remotely suggest any cyclic peptides of the present invention.<br>
One advantage of the present invention is that it provides macrocyclic peptides that<br>
are inhibitory to the NS3 protease of the hepatitis C virus.<br>
A further advantage of one aspect of the present invention resides in the fact that<br>
these peptides specifically inhibit the NS3 protease and do not show significant<br>
inhibitory activity against other serine proteases such as human leukocyte elastase<br>
(HLE), porcine pancreatic elastase (PPE), or bovine pancreatic chymotrypsin, or<br>
cysteine proteases such as human liver cathepsin B (Cat B).<br>
A further advantage of the present invention is that it provides small peptides of<br>
low molecular weight that are capable of penetrating cell membranes and inhibit the<br>
NS3 protease activity in cell culture.<br><br>
Still, a further advantage of the compounds of the present invention resides in the fact that they are active in both major genotypes found in clinical isolates (la &amp; lb), strongly suggesting that these compound will be active against all presently known genotypes of HCV.<br>

The term parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intra-articular, intrasynovial, intrastemal, intrathecal, and intralesional injection or infusion techniques.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable preparation, for example, as a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents (such as, for example. Tween 80) and suspending agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention may be orally administered in any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not limited to, capsules, tablets, and aqueous suspensions and solutions. In the case of tablets for oral use, carriers<br><br>
which are commonly used include lactose and com starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, useful diluents include lactose and dried corn starch. When aqueous suspensions are administered orally, the active ingredient is combined with emulsifying and suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening and/or flavoring and/or coloring agents may be added.<br>
Other suitable vehicles or carriers for the above noted formulations and compositions can be found in standard pharmaceutical texts, e.g. in "Remington's<br>
Pharmaceutical Sciences", 19  ed.. Mack Publishing Company, Easton, Perm., 1995. Dosage levels of between about 0.01 and about 100 mg/kg body weight per day, preferably between about 0.5 and about 75 mg/kg body weight per day of the protease inhibitor compounds described herein are useful in a monotherapy for the prevention and treatment of HCV mediated disease. Typically, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention will be administered from about 1 to about 5 times per day or alternatively, as a continuous infusion. Such administration can be used as a chronic or acute therapy. The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. A typical preparation will contain from about 5% to about 95% active compound (w/w). Preferably, such preparations contain from about 20% to about 80% active compound.<br>
As the skilled artisan will appreciate, lower or higher doses than those recited above may be required. Specific dosage and treatment regimens for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors, including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health status, sex, diet, time of administration, rate of excretion, drug combination, the severity and course of the infection, the patient's disposition to the infection and the judgment of the treating physician. Generally, treatment is initiated with small dosages substantially less than the optimum dose of the peptide. Thereafter, the dosage is increased by small increments until the optimum effect under the circumstances is reached. In general, the compound is most desirably administered at a concentration level that will generally afford antivirally effective results without causing any harmful or<br><br>
deleterious side effects.<br>
When the compositions of this invention comprise a combination of a compound of formula I and one or more additional therapeutic or prophylactic agent, both the compound and the additional agent should be present at dosage levels of between about 10 to 100%, and more preferably between about 10 and 80% of the dosage normally administered in a monotherapy regimen.<br>
When these compounds or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts are formulated together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, the resulting composition may be administered in vivo to mammals, such as man, to inhibit HCV NS3 protease or to treat or prevent HCV virus infection. Such treatment may alsobe achieved using the compounds of this invention in combination with agents which include, but are not limited to: immunomodulatory agents, such as Î±-, Î²-, or Î³-interferons; other antiviral agents such as ribavirin, amantadine; other inhibitors of HCV NS3 protease; inhibitors of other targets in the HCV life cycle such as helicase, polymerase, metalloprotease, or internal ribosome entry site (IRES); or combinations thereof. The additional agents may be combined with the compounds of this invention to create a single dosage form. Alternatively these additional agents may be separately administered to a mammal as part of a multiple dosage form. Accordingly, another embodiment of this invention provides methods of inhibiting HVC NS3 protease activity in mammals by administering a compound of the formula I, wherein the substituents are as defined above. In a preferred embodiment, these methods are useful in decreasing HCV NS3 protease activity in a mammal. If the pharmaceutical composition comprises only a compound of this invention as the active component, such methods may additionally comprise the step of administering to said mammal an agent selected from an immunomodulatory agent, an antiviral agent, a HCV protease inhibitor, or an inhibitor of other targets in the HCV life cycle such as helicase, polymerase, or metalloprotease. Such additional agent may be administered to the mammal prior to, concurrently with, or following the administration of the compositions of this invention.<br>
In an alternate preferred embodiment, these methods are useful for inhibiting viral replication in a mammal. Such methods are useful in treating or preventing HCV<br><br>
disease. If the pharmaceutical composition comprises only a compound of this invention as the active component, such methods may additionally comprise the step of administering to said mammal an agent selected from an immunomodulatory agent, an antiviral agent, a HCV protease inhibitor, or an inhibitor of other targets in the HCV life cycle. Such additional agent may be administered to the mammal prior to, concurrently with, or following the administration of the composition according to this invention.

Methodology<br>
Several ways of carrying the synthesis of acyclic intermediates of compounds of<br>
formula I are disclosed in WO 00/09543 and WO 00/09558.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are synthesized according to the general<br>
process illustrated in Schemes I, II and III (wherein PG is an appropriate protecting<br>
groups. [In all schemes presented below, D' has the same definition as D but is 2 to 5<br>
atom shorter].<br>
When the invention covers compounds of formula I wherein A is a N-substituted<br>
amide, vinyl-ACCA or homo-allyl ACCA (R ) is coupled to an appropriate amine prior to the coupling to F2. Such coupling will be readily recognized by persons skilled in the art. As will be recognized by persons skilled in the art, such amide (A) is not protected but bears any relevant substituent R as defined above. The ring-dosing reaction (macrocydization) is carried out by either olefin metathesis<br><br>
(Scheme I) or when the linker contains a nitrogen atom, by reductive amination (Scheme II), or by peptide bond formation Scheme in. Details of these processes are presented below:<br>
A.       Macrocyclisation via olefin metathesis<br><br>
Scheme I:<br>
There are several ways in which the coupling sequence can be carried out which can be easily recognized by persons skilled in the art. Starting with 4-(S)-hydroxyproline, the substiruent at the 4-hydroxy can be incorporated via a Mitsuhobu reaction (as described in Mitsunobu Synthesis 1981, January, 1-28; Rano et BL Tet. Lett. 1994,36,3779-3792; Krchnak et ah Tet. Lett. 1995,36,6193-6196) before or after the macrocyclization. Alternatively the assembly can be done with the required 4-(R)-hydroxy-substituted proline as disclosed in the general processes of WO 00/09543 &amp; WO 00/09558 (see below for specific examples of these fragments).<br><br>
Steps A, B, C: Briefly, the PI, P2, and P3 moieties can be linked by well known peptide coupling techniques and generally disclosed in WO 00/09543 &amp; WO 00/09558.<br>
Step D: The formation of the macrocycle can be carried out via an olefin metathesis using a Ru-based catalyst such as the one reported by Miller, S.J.; Blackwell, H.E.; Grubbs, R.H. /. Am. Chem. Soc. 1996,118,9606-9614 (a); Kingsbury, J.S.; Harrity, J.P.A.; Bonitatebus, P.J.; Hoveyda, A.H. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999,121,791-799 (b) and Huang, J.; Stevens, E.D.; Nolan, S.P.; Petersen, J.L.; /. Am. Chem. Soc. 1999,121,2674-2678 (c). It will also be recognized that catalysts containing other transition metals such as Mo can be used for this reaction.<br><br>
Step E: Optionally, the double bond is reduced by standard hydrogenation methods<br>
well known in the art. When A' is a protected carboxylic acid, it is also deprotected<br>
appropriately.<br>
B.        Macrocyclization via reductive amination (for linkers containing N)<br>
When the linker contains a nitrogen atom, macrocyclization is achieved by reductive<br>
amination as shown in Scheme II to obtain inhibitors of general structure n.<br><br><br>
Step A: Hydroboration of the double bond following Brown's procedure (H.C.<br>
Brown and B.C. Subba Rao, /. Am. Che. Soc. 1959,81,6434rM37) followed by<br>
oxidation of the resulting alcohol (for example via Dess-Martin periodinate, /. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 1991,123,7277-7287) affords the corresponding aldehyde.<br>
Step B: Hydrogenation in the presence of add leads to the removal of the amino<br>
protecting group followed by macrocyclization via reductive amination.<br>
The P3 unit used in this synthesis is easily obtained from a variety of amino acids,<br>
such as lysine, ornithine, glutamine (after a Hofmann reaction: Ber. 1881,14,2725)<br>
and others; these synthetic modifications are methods well known in the art.<br>
Step O Optionally, the secondary amine in the linker D (formed after step D) is<br>
alkylated with alkyl halides or acetylated with alkyl or aryl acid chlorides using<br>
methodologies well known in the art to obtain inhibitors of general structure II.<br>
When A1 is a protected carboxylic acid, it is also deprotected appropriately.<br>
C.	Macrocyclization via lactam formation<br>
Alternatively, it is understood that these macrocyclic compounds with general<br>
structure I and II can be synthesized in other ways. For example PI and P3 can be<br>
first connected to the linker D, then coupled to P2 and the macrocyclization reaction<br>
can be a lactam formation in two possible ways as will be recognized by persons<br>
skilled in the art and as shown in Scheme ID.<br><br><br>
Synthesis of PI<br>
The synthesis of inhibitors with general structure I and II requires the same PI<br>
fragments:<br>
a)	vinyl ACCA, the synthesis and resolution of which is described in WO 00/09543 &amp; WO 00/09558 or<br>
b)	homoallyl ACCA (Example 1, compound If). Synthesis of P2<br>
Some of the P2 fragments used for the synthesis of compounds of formula I are described in WO 00/09543 &amp; WO 00/09558. Other P2 fragments are synthesized as follows:<br>
a.   Synthesis of 2-"Het*- 4-hydroxy-7-methoxyquinoline derivative<br>
(i)        Approach from the corresponding "Het" carboxylic acid IVb<br><br><br>
The synthesis is carried out according to a modified procedure in Li et al. J. Med.<br>
Chem. 1994,34,3400-3407. Intermediate IVa where R21 = OMe (Example 7,<br>
compound 7b) is prepared as described by Brown et al. J. Med. Chem. 1989,32,807-<br>
826.<br>
Step A: Intermediate IVa is coupled with heterocyclic carboxylic acids IVb under<br>
basic conditions with POCl3 to activate the carboxylate group. A variety of carboxylic acids with general structure IVb are used for the preparation of inhibitors; these are either commercially available, synthesized as shown in scheme V, VI and VH, or synthesized individually using methods described in the specific examples. Step B: Ring-closure, followed by dehydration is achieved under basic conditions to obtain quinolines of general structure IVd.<br>

bromopyruvic acid. This type of condensation reaction is well known in the art. Alternatively, the P2 fragment containing the 2-arnino-substituted-thiazole derivatives are synthesized from the corresponding 2-carboxyl derivative as shown in scheme VI according to the procedure of: Unangst, P.C.; Connor, D.T. /. Heterocyc. Chem. 29,5,1992,1097-1100.<br><br><br><br>
Examples of this process are disclosed in WO 00/09543 &amp; WO 00/09558.<br>

The procedure described by Janusz et al. J. Med. Chem. 1998,41,3515-3529 is used with modifications as described as follows: Ethyl thiooxamate (VIla) is reacted with different Î²-bromoketones of general structure VIIb (R = alkyl group) to form thiazolyl carboxylic acids of general structure VIId. This type of condensation reaction is well known in the art.<br><br>
Synthesis of 2-carboxv-f$ubstituted')-imidazole derivative<br>
(VIIIb) A variety of alkylimidazolyl-2-carboxylic acids, compounds of general structure Vlllb, are made using the general synthetic methodology outlined in Scheme VIIL<br>
Scheme VIII<br><br>
The procedure described by Baird et al. J. Amer. Chem. Soc 1996,118,6141-6146. was used: an alkyl imidazole is deprotonated with a strong base (e.g. nBuli) and then<br>
reacted with C02 to form the carboxylic acid Vinb. This type of condensation<br>
reaction is well known in the art.<br>
b.        Synthesis of 4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2- (imidazolyl or pyrazolyl)quinolines 4-Hydroxy-7-R25 quinolines having an imidazolyl or pyrazolyl moiety at C2 are generally prepared using the methodology outlined in Scheme DC.<br>

IXc The synthesis of the key intermediate, (wherein R21   = OMe) 4-benzyloxy-2-chloro-7-methoxyquinoline IXa is described in detail in Example 6 (compound 6e).<br><br>
Step A: At high temperatures, a variety of imidazoles, alkyl substituted imidazoles,<br>
pyrazoles or alkyl substituted pyrazoles can be used to displace the 2-chloro moiety<br>
of compound IXa giving compounds of general structure IXb.<br>
Step B: Upon removal of the benzyl protecting group from the 4-hydroxy moiety of<br>
the quinoline by standard hydrogenation methods, quinoline derivatives of general<br>
structure IXc are obtained.<br>
Synthesis of P3<br>
A variety of P3 fragments are synthesized containing the appropriate D linker<br>
extension for macrocyclization by olefin metathesis. In general P3 units containing a<br>
terminal olefin for metathesis are synthesized following the general schemes shown<br>
below (Schemes X, XI &amp; XII).<br>
Synthesis of Linkers in Class A<br>
This general synthesis is used to make linkers that are all carbon based (no<br>
heteroatom) (Scheme X).<br><br>
The synthesis is performed according to the procedure of Evans et al. J. Am. Chan. Soc. 1990,112,4011-4030.<br><br>
The starting carboxylic acids (Xa) is commercially available or is prepared by know<br>
literature procedures familiar to those skilled in the art.<br>
Step A: The carboxylic add Xa is activated with pivaloyl chloride and then reacted<br>
with the anion of Evans' chiral auxiliary 4(S)-4-(phenylmethyI)-2-oxazolidinone<br>
following well known chemistry (Review: D.J. Ager et al. Aldrkhimica Acta 1997,30,<br>
3-11, and references therein) to obtain compounds of general structure Xb.<br>
Step B: Stereoselective a-azidation with trizylazide, of a chiral imide enolate such as<br>
those which would form from compounds with general structure Xb in the presence<br>
of a base like KHMDS, is also well known in the art (Review: D.J. Ager et al.<br>
Aldrkhimica Acta 1997,30,3-11, and references therein).<br>
Step C: Reduction of the a-azide, catalyzed by SnCl2 is followed by protection of the<br>
amine formed as its t-butyl carbamate gives intermediates of general structure Xc.<br>
These reactions are also well known in the art.<br>
Step D: Finally, the chiral auxiliary is hydrolyzed under basic conditions, such as a<br>
mixture of H202 with LiOH, to produce the amino acid-type linkers of general<br>
structure Xe.<br>
Alternatively, P3 moieties having the same general structure Xe are synthesized following de procedure described by MJ. Burk et al. J. Am. Chern. Sac 1998,220,657-663 illustrated in Scheme XI. These compounds varied in the number of methylene<br>
units (-CH2-) along the linker (m=l to 5) and the substitution of alkyl groups at R4, but did not contain a heteroatom.<br><br><br>
Step A: The monoacid compound Xlb is prepared from commercially available diethyl 2-acetamidomalonate by standard ester hydrolysis under basic conditions. Step B: Knoevenagel-type condensation between an aldehyde of general structure XIc and compound Xlb in the presence of a base, such as pyridine, and acetic anhydride leads to the formation of enamide intermediate Xld having the 2. stereochemistry around the newly formed double bond as shown. Step C: Regioselective and enantioselective catalytic hydrogenation of the enamide intermediate Xld to the amino acid intermediate Xle is achieved using Burk's method.<br>
Step D: The nitrogen of the acetamido derivative Xle is then di-protected with the addition of a t-butyl carbamate substituent before the acetate group, as well as the ethyl ester, are hydrolyzed under standard basic condition to obtain P3 moieties of general structure Xlf.<br><br><br>
Step A: Suitably protected amino adds, such Boc-(L)-serine methyl ester, Boc-(L)-threonine methyl ester or Boc-(L)-allothreonine methyl ester, are alkylated with allyl<br>
iodide in the presence of AgzO to give the methyl ester XIIb.<br>
Step B: Hydrolysis of the methyl ester under standard basic conditions yields the<br>
ether-type linkers of general structure XHc (X=0).<br>
Step C: The sulfur analog is prepared from the same starting amino acid XIIa<br>
(appropriately protected as before) and its hydroxyl group is converted to a good<br>
leaving group (such as the tosylate intermediate XIId) using standard methodology<br>
well known in the art.<br>
Step D: The tosyl moiety is subsequently displaced with the anion of thioacetate<br>
leading to the formation of the thioester intermediate XIIe by inversion of the chiral<br>
center at the Î²-carbon.<br><br>
Step E: Hydrolysis of the thioester moiety under mild basic conditions yields the<br>
free thiol XIIf.<br>
Step F: Alkylation of the thiol moiety is easily achieved under basic conditions with<br>
allyl iodide.<br>
Step G: Finally, the sulfide analog XIIc (X=S) are obtained after hydrolysis of the<br>
methyl ester using standard procedures.<br>

Synthesis oi 4-hydroxy-7-methoxy-2[4(2-isopropylaminothia2o]yl)J quinoline (8f)<br>
Note: [ A variety of 2-alkylaminothiazolyl substituents were made using the same<br>
synthetic scheme where compound 8b was replaced by other alkyl thioureas.]<br><br><br><br>
A.	The protocol used for the conversion of m-anisidine to 8a was identical to<br>
that described in the literature: F.J. Brown et al J. Med. Chem. 1989,32,807-826.<br>
However, the purification procedure was modified to avoid purification by<br>
chromatography. The EtOAc phase containing the desired product was treated with<br>
a mixture of MgS04 charcoal and 5% w/w (based on expected mass) silica gel. After filtration on celite, the product was triturated with ether. Compound 8a was obtained as a pale brown solid in &gt;99% purity (as confirmed by HPLC).<br>
B.	A suspension of isopropyl thiourea (8b, 355 g, 30 mmol) and 3-<br>
bromopyruvic acid (8c, 5 g, 1 eq.) in dioxane (300 mL, 0.1 M) was heated to 80 Â°C Upon reaching 80 Â°C the solution became clear and soon after the product precipitated as a white solid. After 2 hours of heating, the solution was cooled to RT and the white precipitate was filtered to obtain compound 8d in high purity (&gt;98% purity as confirmed by NMR) and 94% yield (751 g).<br>
C       A mixture of the carboxylic acid 8d (4.85 g, 182 mmol) and the aniline derivative 8a (3 g, leq.) in pyridine (150 mL, 0.12 M) was cooled to -30 Â°C (upon cooling, the clear solution became partially a suspension). Phosphorus oxychloride (356 ml, 2.1 eq.) was then added slowly over a 5 min period. The reaction was stirred at -30 C for 1 h, the bath was removed and the reaction mixture was allowed to warm-up to RT. After 1.5 h the reaction mixture was poured into ice, the pH was<br><br>
adjusted to 11 with aqueous 3N NaOH, extracted with CH2Cl2, dried over<br>
anhydrous MgS04, filtered and concentrated under vacuum. The beige solid was then purified by flash chromatography (45% EtOAc in hexane) to give compound 8e as a pale yellow solid in 73% yield (6.07 g).<br>
D.       A solution of tBuOK (2.42 g, 21.6 mmol) in anhydrous tBuOH (40ml, 0.14 M, distilled from Mg metal) was heated to reflux. Compound 8e (1.8g, 5.4 mmol) was added portion-wise over 5 min and the dark red solution formed was stirred at reflux for an additional 20 min (completion of the reaction was monitored by HPLC). The mixture was cooled to RT and HC1 was added (4 N in dioxane, 1.5 eq.). The mixture was then concentrated under vacuum, in order to assure that all of the<br>
HC1 and dioxane were removed, the product was re-dissolved twice in CH2Cl2, and<br>
dried under vacuum to finally obtain the HC1 salt of compound 8f as a beige solid<br>
(1.62 g, 93% pure by HPLC). The product was then poured into a phosphate buffer<br>
(IN NaH2PO,,, pH=~4.5) and sonicated. The beige solid was filtered and dried under<br>
vacuum to give compound 8f (1.38 g, 81% yield) as a beige solid (91% pure by<br>
HPLC).<br>

MACROCYCLIC PEPTIDES EXAMPLE 22 General procedure for macrocydization via olefin metathesis<br>
In all cases, the tri-peptide diene was dissolved in CH2Cl2 at a concentration of<br>
0.01M and the solution was deoxygenated by the bubbling of argon (~1 h for a volume of 500 mL). A solution of catalyst (5-30 mol %, dissolved in a small amount<br>
of degassed CHjCL,) is added and the reaction mixture is refluxed until all starting<br>
material was converted to produces) as indicated by TLC and HPLC. The crude reaction mixtures were subsequently concentrated to near dryness and filtered<br>
through a short pad of silica gel, eluting first with CH2Cl2 to remove most of the catalyst and then with EtOAc in order to elute all of the macrocyclic produc(s) (most of the time as a single diastereomer). The crude product(s) from each reaction is analyzed by chiral HPLC on a CHIRALCEL OJ-R column (purchased from Chiral<br>

A.        The unsaturated macrocyclic intermediate 23b (3.50 g, 7.30 mmol) was dissolved in EtOAc (30 mL) and 700 mg (20% w/w) of 5% Rh on alumina was<br>
added. The mixture was stirred under H2 gas at atmospheric pressure and at RT for 1.5 h. After that period, HPLC analysis confirmed the complete conversion of starring material to two products, the desired product 27a and a minor product (8% of the total mass) which was later identified to be compound 27b, formed from opening of the cyclopropane ring. The reaction mixture was filtered and concentrated to give a light green color solid (3.47 g). The solid was co-evaporated twice with EtOH to remove all of the EtOAc (the presence of EtOAc interferes in the next step). Separation of compound 27a from 27b by chromatography proved to be<br><br>
very difficult, thus an alternative method was devised based on the relative rates of<br>
hydrolysis of their respective methyl ester moieties.<br>

mL), 4N HC1 in dioxane (12 mL) was added and the reaction mixture was stirred at<br>
RT for 1 h. [In the event that a thick gel would form half way through the reaction<br>
period, an additional 10 mL CH2C12 was added.] Upon completion of the<br>
deprotection the solvents were evaporate to dryness to obtain a yellow solid and a<br>
paste like material. The mixture was redissolved in approximately 5% MeOH in<br>
CH2Cl2 and re-evaporated to dryness under vacuum to obtain compound 34b as a yellow solid, which was used in the next step without any purification.<br>
C.	To a solution of cyclopentanol (614 ÂµL, 6.76 mmoL) in THF (15 mL), a<br>
solution of phosgene in toluene (1.93 M, 5.96 mL, 11.502 mmol) was added dropwise<br>
and the mixture was stirred at R.T. for 2 h to form the cyclopentyl chloroformate<br>
reagent (z). After that period, approximately half of the solvent was removed by<br>
evaporation under vacuum, the remaining light yellow solution was diluted by the<br>
addition of CHjCL, (5 mL) and concentrated to half of its original volume, in order to assure the removal of all excess phosgene. The above solution of the cyclopentyl chloroformate reagent was further diluted with THF (15 mL) and added to the amine-2HCl salt 34b. The mixture was cooled to 0Â°C in an ice bath, the pH was<br>
adjusted to ~8.5-9 with the addition of Et3N (added dropwise) and the reaction<br>
mixture was stirred at 0 C for 1 h. After that period, the mixture was diluted with<br>
EtOAc, washed with water (lx), saturated NaHC03 (2x), Hp (2x) and brine (lx).<br>
The organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgSO4 filtered and evaporated under vacuum to obtain a yellow-amber foam. Compound 34c was obtained as a white foam after purification by flash column chromatography (using a solvent gradient from 30% hexane to 20% hexane in EtOAc as the eluent) in 80% yield (1.27 g) and &gt;93% purity.<br>
D.       The dimethyl ester 34c (1.17g) was dissolved in a mixture of THF/MeOH/H2O (20 mL, 2:1:1 ratio), and an aqueous solution of NaOH (1.8 mL, IN, 1 eq.) was added. The reaction mixture was stirred at RT for 1 h before it was evaporated to dryness to obtain the sodium salt 34d as a white solid (-1.66 mmol).<br><br>
Compound 34d was used in the next step without purification. E.        The crude sodium salt 34d (1.66 mmoL) was dissolved in THF (17 mL), Et3N was added and the mixture was cooled to 0Â°C in an ice bath. Isobutylchloroformate (322 Âµl, 2.5 mmol) was added dropwise and the mixture was stirred at 0 C for 75 min. After that period, diazomethane (15 mL) was added and stirring was continued at 0Â°C for 30 min and then at RT for an additional 1 h. Most of the solvent was evaporated to dryness under vacuum, the remaining mixture was diluted with EtOAc, washed with saturated NaHC03 (2x), H2O (2x) and brine (lx), dried over<br>
anhydrous MgS04, filtered and evaporated to dryness to obtain compound 34e as a light yellow foam (1.2g, -1.66 mmol). The diazoketone intermediate 34e was used in the next step without purification.<br>
F.	The diazoketone 34e (1.2g, 1.66 mmoL) dissolved in THF (17 mL) was cooled<br>
to 0Â°C in an ice bath. A solution of aqueous HBr (48%, 1.24 mL) was added<br>
dropwise and the reaction mixture was stirred at 0Â°C for 1 h. The mixture was then<br>
diluted with EtOAc, wash with saturated NaHC03 (2x), Hp (2x) and brine (lx), the<br>
organic layer was dried over anhydrous MgS04, filtered and evaporated to dryness<br>
to obtain the Î²-bromoketone intermediate 34f as a light yellow foam (-1.657 mmol).<br>
G.	To a solution of the bromoketone 34f (600 mg,0.779 mmol) in isopropanol (5<br>
mL), thiourea (118 mg, 1.55 mmol) was added and the reaction mixture was placed<br>
in a pre-heated oil bath at 75 C where it was allowed to stir for 1 hr. The<br>
isopropanol was then removed under vacuum and the product dissolved in EtOAc<br>
(100 mL). The solution was washed with saturated NaHCO3 and brine, the organic<br>
layer was dried over anhydrous Na2SQ4 filtered and evaporated to afford the crude product 34g (522 mg) as a red-brown solid. This material was used in the final step without any further purification.<br>
H.       The crude methyl ester 34g (122 mg, 0.163 mmol) was dissolved in a solution of THF/MeOH/Hp (2:1:1 ratio, 4 mL) and saponified using LiOH-H2O (89 mg, 2.14 mmol). The hydrolysis reaction was carried out over a 12-15 h period at RT. The<br><br>
solvents were then removed under vacuum and the crude product purified by C18 reversed phase HPLC, using a solvent gradient from 10% CH3CN in H2O to 100%<br>
CH3CN, to afford the HCV protease inhibitor #812 as a yellow solid (24 mg, 20% overall yield for the conversion of intermediate 34f to inhibitor #812). 1H NMR (400 MHz, DMSO-d6) 5 8.63 (s, 1H), 8.26-8.15 (m, 2H), 7.79 (bs, 1H), 7.72 (bs, 1H), 7.50 (bs, 2H), 7.33-7.25 (m, 2H), 5.77 (bs, 1H), 5.52 (dd, J = 8.3 Hz, 1H), 5.27 {dd, J = 9.2 Hz, 1H), 4.64 (d, J = 10.8 Hz, 1H), 4.50 (dd, J = 8.3 Hz, 1H), 4.39-4.31 (m, 1H), 4.08-3.99 (m, 2H), 3.94 (s, 3H), 3.87 (d, J = 9.5 Hz, 2H), 2.65-2.53 (m, 2H), 2.46-2.36 (m, 2H), 2.20-2.12 (dd, J = 8.6 Hz, 1H), 1.80-1.64 (m, 2H), 1.63-1.06 (m, 14H).

Full-length NS3-NS4A heterodimer protein fluorogenic assay<br>
The NS2-NS5B-3'non coding region was cloned by RT-PCR into the pCRÂ®3 vector<br>
(Invitrogen) using RNA extracted from the serum of an HCV genotype lb infected<br>
individual (provided by Dr. Bernard Willems, Hopital St-Luc, Montreal, Quebec,<br>
Canada). The NS3-NS4A region (NS3-NS4AFL) was then subdoned by PCR into the<br>
pFastBacâ„¢ HTa baculovirus expression vector (Gibco/BRL). The vector sequence<br>
includes a region encoding a 28-residue N-termina] sequence which contains a<br>
hexahistidine tag. The Bac-to-Bacâ„¢ baculovirus expression system (Gibco/BRL) was<br>
used to produce the recombinant baculovirus. His-NS3-NS4AFL was expressed by<br>
infecting 10 SÂ£21 cells/mL with the recombinant baculovirus at a multiplicity of<br>
infection of 0.1-0.2 at 27Â°. Authentic auto-proteolysis occurs during expression to produce a non covalent and stable NS3-NS4A protein complex (referred to as full-length "FL"). The infected culture was harvested 48 to 64 h later by centrifugation at<br>
4Â°. The cell pellet was homogenized in 50mM NaP04, pH 7.5,40% glycerol (w/v),<br><br>
2mM p-mercaptoethanol, in presence of a cocktail of protease inhibitors. His-NS3-NS4AFL was then extracted from the cell Iysate with 1.5% NP-40,0.5% Triton X-100, 0.5M NaCl, and a DNase treatment. After ultracentrifugation, the soluble extract was diluted 4-fold and bound on a Pharmacia Hi-Trap Ni-chelating column. The His-NS3-NS4AFL was eluted in a &gt;90% pure form (as judged by SDS-PAGE), using a 50 to 400 mM imidazole gradient. The His-NS3-NS4AFL was stored at -80Â° in 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5,10% (w/v) glycerol, 0.5 M NaCl, 0.25 M imidazole, 0.1% NP-40. It was thawed on ice and diluted just prior to use. The protease activity of His-NS3-NS4AFL was assayed in 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.0, 0.25 M sodium citrate, 0.01% (w/v) n-dodecyl-p-D-maltoside, 1 mM TCEP. Five (5) HM of the internally quenched substrate anthranilyl-DDIVPAbu[C(O)-0]-AMY(3-N02)TW-OH in presence of various concentrations of inhibitor were incubated with<br>
1.5 nM of His-NS3-NS4AFL for 45 min at 23Â°. The final DMSO concentration did not exceed 5.25%. The reaction was terminated with the addition of 1M MES, pH 5.8. Fluorescence of the N-terminal product was monitored on a Perkin-Elmer LS-50B fluorometer equipped with a 96-well plate reader (excitation wavelength: 325 nm; emission wavelength: 423 nm). The % inhibition was calculated with the following equation:<br><br>
A non-linear curve fit with the Hill model was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (LCg) was calculated by the use of SAS software (Statistical Software System; SAS Institute, Inc. Cary, N.C). EXAMPLE 49<br>
Recombinant HCV NS3 protease radiometric assay<br>
The substrate used for the HCV NS3 protease radiometric assay, DDIVPC-SMSYTW, is cleaved between the cysteine and the serine residues by the enzyme. The sequence DDIVPC-SMSYTW corresponds to the NS5A/NS5B natural cleavage site in which the cysteine residue in P2 has been substituted for a proline. The peptide substrate DDIVPC-SMSYTW and the tracer biotin-DDIVPC-SMS[125I-Y]TW were incubated with the recombinant NS3 protease in the absence or in the presence of inhibitors. The separation of substrate from products was performed by adding avidin-coated<br><br>
agarose beads to the assay mixture followed by filtration. The amount of SMS[1SI-<br>
Y]TW product found in the filtrate (with or without inhibitor) allowed for the<br>
calculation of the percentage of substrate conversion and of the percentage of<br>
inhibition.<br>
A. Reagents<br>
Tris and Tris-HCl (UltraPure) were obtained from Life Technologies. Glycerol<br>
(UltraPure), MES and BSA were purchased from SigmaÂ®. TCEP was obtained from<br>
Pierce, DMSO from AldrichÂ® and NaOH from AnachemiaÂ®.<br>
Assay buffer: 50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.5,30% (w/v) glycerol 2% (w/v) CHAPS, 1<br>

in water).<br>
Substrate: DDIVPC-SMSYTW, 25 Î¼M final concentration (from a 2 mM stock<br>
solution in DMSO stored at -20Â°C to avoid oxidation).<br>
Tracer: reduced mono-iodinated substrate(biotin-DDIVPC-SMS[,125 I-Y]TW) (Â»1 nM<br>

HCV NS3 protease type lb, 25 nM final concentration (from a stock solution in 50<br>
mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.5,10% glycerol, 300 mM NaCl, 5 mM DTT, 0.01% NP-<br>

B. Protocol<br>
The assay was performed in a 96-well polypropylene plate. Each well contained:<br>
20 Î¼L substrate/tracer in assay buffer;<br>
10 Î¼L * inhibitor in 20% DMSO/assay buffer;<br>
10 Î¼L NS3 protease lb.<br>
Blank (no inhibitor and no enzyme) and control (no inhibitor) were also prepared on<br>
the same assay plate.<br>
The enzymatic reaction was initiated by the addition of the enzyme solution and the<br>
assay mixture was incubated for 60 min at 23Â°C under gentle agitation. Twenty (20)<br>
uL of 0.025 N NaOH were added to quench the enzymatic reaction.<br>
Twenty (20) uL of avidin-coated agarose beads (purchased from PierceÂ®) were<br>
added in a MilliporeÂ® MADP N65 filtration plate. The quenched assay mixture was<br>
transferred to the filtration plate, and incubated for 60 min at 23Â°C under gentle<br>
agitation.<br><br>
The plates were filtered using a MilliporeÂ® MultiScreen Vacuum Manifold Filtration<br>
apparatus, and 40 |xL of the filtrate was transferred to an opaque 96-well plate<br>
containing 60 Î¼L of scintillation fluid per well.<br>
The filtrates were counted on a PackardÂ® TopCount instrument using a 12SI-liquid<br>
protocol for 1 minute.<br>
The %inhibition was calculated with the following equation:<br><br>
A non-linear curve fit with the Hill model was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (IC50) was calculated by the use of SAS software (Statistical Software System; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.). EXAMPLE 50 Specificity assays<br>
The specificity of the compounds was determined against a variety of serine proteases: human leukocyte elastase, porcine pancreatic elastase and bovine pancreatic Î±-chymotrypsin and one cysteine protease: human liver cathepsin B. In all cases a 96-well plate format protocol using a chromogenic substrate specific for each enzyme was used. Each assay included a 1 h enzyme-inhibitor pre-incubation at RT followed by addition of substrate and hydrolysis to 30% conversion as measured on a UV ThennomaxÂ® microplate reader or a fluorescence Perkin-ElmerÂ® LS50B plate reader. Substrate concentrations were kept as low as possible compared to KM to reduce substrate competition. Compound concentrations varied from 300<br>
to 0.06 uM depending on their potency.<br>
The final conditions for each assay were as follows:<br>
50mM Tris-HCl pH 8,0.5 M Na SO4 50 mM Nad, 0.1 mM EDTA, 3% DMSO, 0.01%<br>
Tween-20 with;<br>
[100 uM Succ-AAPF-pNA and 250 pM a-chymotrypsin], [133 uM Succ-AAA-pNA<br>
and 8 nM porcine elastase], [133 uM Succ-AAV-pNA and 8 nM leukocyte elastase];<br>
or<br>

Î¼M Z-FR-AMC (7-amino-4-methylcouniarin) and 0.5 nM cathepsin B (the stock enzyme was activated in buffer containing 20 mM TCEP before use)].<br><br>
A representative example is summarized below for porcine pancreatic elastase:<br>
In a polystyrene flat-bottom 96-well plate (Cellwells, Coming) were added using a<br>
Biomek liquid handler (Beckman):<br>
40 uL of assay, buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8,1M Na2SO4 50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM<br>
EDTA);<br>
20 uL of enzyme solution (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8,50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 0.02%<br>
Tween-20,40 nM porcine pancreatic elastase); and<br>
20 uL of inhibitor solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8,50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA,<br>
0.02% Tween-20,1.5 mM-0.3 Î¼M inhibitor, 15% v/v DMSO).<br>
After 60 min pre-incubation at RT, 20 uL of substrate solution (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH<br>
8,0.5 M Na2S04,50 mM NaCl, 0.1 mM EDTA, 665 uM Succ-AAA-pNA) were added<br>
to each well and the reaction was further incubated at RT for 60 min after which<br>
time the absorbance was read on the UV ThermomaxÂ® plate reader. Rows of wells<br>
were allocated for controls (no inhibitor) and for blanks (no inhibitor and no<br>
enzyme).<br>
The sequential 2-fold dilutions of the inhibitor solution were performed on a<br>
separate plate by the liquid handler using 50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8,50 mM NaCl, 0.1<br>
mM EDTA, 0.02% Tween-20,15% (v/v) DMSO. AH other specificity assays were<br>
performed in a similar fashion.<br>
The percentage of inhibition was calculated using the formula:<br><br>
A non-linear curve fit with the Hill model was applied to the inhibition-concentration data, and the 50% effective concentration (IC50) was calculated by the use of SAS software (Statistical Software System; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.). EXAMPLE 51<br>
NS3 Protease Cell-based assay<br>
This assay is done with Huh-7 cells, a human cell line derived from a hepatoma, co-transfected with 2 DNA constructs:<br>
one (called NS3) expressing part of the HCV non-structural polyprotein fused to the tTA protein through an NS5A-NS5B cleavage site in the following order: NS3-NS4A-NS4B-NS5A-(NS5B)tTA where (NS5B) represents the 6 first amino acids of NS5B.<br><br>
This polyprotein is expressed under the control of the CMV promoter,<br>
the other (called SEAP) expressing the reporter protein, secreted alkaline<br>
phosphatase (SEAP), under the regulation of a tTA-responsive promoter.<br>
The first construct leads to the expression of a polyprotein from which the different<br>
mature proteins are released through cleavage by the NS3 protease. It is believed<br>
that the mature viral proteins forms a complex at the membrane of the endoplasmic<br>
reticulum. tTA is a fusion protein, described by Gossen and Bujard (Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA Â§9 (1992): 5547-5551), which contains a DNA-binding domain and a<br>
transcriptional activator. Release of the tTA protein requires an NS3-dependent<br>
cleavage at the NS5A-NS5B cleavage site between NS5A and itself. This last<br>
cleavage allows tTA to migrate to the nucleus and transactivate the SEAP gene.<br>
Therefore, reduction of NS3 proteolytic activity leads to confinement of tTA to the<br>
cytoplasm and concomitant decrease in SEAP activity.<br>
To control for cellular activities other than inhibition of NS3 protease which are due<br>
to the compound, a parallel co-transfection is done with a construct expressing tTA<br>
alone and the same reporter construct such that SEAP activity is independent of the<br>
NS3 protease.<br>
Protocol of the assay: Huh-7 cells, grown in CHO-SFMH (Life Technologies) + 10%<br>
FCS (fetal calf serum) were co-transfected with the two DNA constructs in the<br>
following proportions:<br>
7 ug NS3+ 500ng SEAP + 800ul FuGENE (Boehringer Mannheim) per 4 X10' Huh-7<br>
cells. After 5 hours at 37Â°C, the cells were washed, trypsinized and plated (at 80 000<br>
cells/well) in 96-well plates containing a range of concentrations of the compounds<br>
to be tested. After a 24-hour incubation period, the SEAP activity in the medium was<br>
measured with the Phospha-Light kit (Tropix).<br>
Analysis of the percent inhibition of SEAP activity with respect to compound<br>
concentration was performed with the SAS software to obtain the EC,,,.<br><br>
