2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Mobile communication terminals are widely used due to their convenient<br>
portability. Manufacturers are developing mobile communication terminals with<br>
advanced functions, in an effort to secure more users. For example, the mobile<br>
communication terminals provide various functions of a phone book, a game, a<br>
scheduler, a short message, an internet, an e-mail, a morning call, a MPEG<br>
Layer3, a digital camera and so on.<br>
As described above, along with developing the mobile communication<br>
terminal with advanced functions, the mobile terminal is often upgraded to add<br>
new functions. Every manufacturer has its own software to upgrade the mobile<br><br>
communication terminal. Each manufacturer uses hardware lock or software lock<br>
technology so as to prevent illegal software copying.<br>
Hardware lock checks if the binary code is illegally copied by checking<br>
the portion where hardware lock is positioned. Illegal copy check is performed<br>
also in download tool.<br>
As described above, hardware lock and software lock are used for<br>
preventing the download of illegal software in a mobile communication terminal,<br>
nowever, hardware lock is expensive not enough to be used in low end mobile<br>
phone. Also, software lock may be hacked. In this case, hackers may change<br>
download routines of the binary code through disassembling.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described herein<br>
below with reference to the accompanying drawings. In the following description,<br>
well-known functions or constructions are not described in detail because they<br>
would obscure the present invention in unnecessary detail.<br><br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described a technology for<br>
preventing illegal software download in a mobile communication terminal. In<br>
other words, a technology for preventing the illegal software download, which<br>
prevents the binary code hacking by encoding a part of code area of the binary to<br>
be downloaded in the mobile communication terminal, will be described.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a block diagram of a mobile communication terminal<br>
according to the present invention. The mobile terminal includes a cellular phone,<br>
a Personal Communication System (PCS), a Personal Data Assistant (PDA), and<br>
an international mobile communication-2000 (IMT2000), and the like. The<br>
following description will now be provided in view of general structures of the<br>
above terminals.<br>
Referring to FIG. 1, a Micro-Processor Unit (MPU) 100 controls an<br>
overall operation of the mobile communication terminal. For example, the MPU<br>
100 is responsible for processing and controlling voice and data communication.<br>
In addition, the MPU 100 determines the binary code downloading by comparing<br>
the next release information included in the binary code in the terminal with<br>
version information of the binary to be downloaded, according to the present<br>
invention. Thus, a detailed description of the typical processing and controlling<br>
operation of the MPU 100 will be omitted. Here, page unit means messages<br>
displayed in one screen.<br>
Read Only Memory (ROM) 102 stores a microcode of a program for<br>
processing and controlling the MPU and all reference data, in particular, for<br>
determining binary code downloading by comparing the next release information<br>
included in the binary code in the terminal with binary version information to be<br>
downloaded according to the present invention. A Random Access Memory<br>
(RAM) 104, which is a working memory of the MPU, stores temporary data<br>
being generated while performing all programs. A flash Rom 106 stores various<br><br>
updatable data to be kept, such as a phone book, an outgoing message, and an<br>
incoming message.<br>
Key pad 108 includes numeric keys of digits 0-9 and a plurality of<br>
function keys, such as a MUNU key, a CANCEL (REMOVE) key, an ENTER<br>
key, a TALK key, an END key, an internet connection key, navigation keys (or<br>
direction keys) (▲/▼/◄/►). The key pad provides a key input data to the MPU<br>
100. The key input data corresponds to a key that is pressed by the user. A display<br>
unit 110 displays status information, limited number of characters, large moving<br>
pictures and still pictures, and the like, which is generating while the mobile<br>
terminal operates. Liquid Crystal Display (LCD) is used as the display unit 100.<br>
A Coder-Decoder (CODEC) 112 connected to the MPU 100, a speaker<br>
116 and a microphone 114 connected to the CODEC are audio input/output<br>
blocks in call communication and voice record. The MPU 100 produces PCM<br>
data and the CODEC 112 converts the PCM data into analog audio signals. The<br>
analog audio signals are outputted through the speaker 116. Also, the CODEC<br>
112 converts analog audio signals received through the microphone 114 into<br>
PCM data and provides the MPU to the PCM data.<br>
Radio Frequency (RF) unit 120 drops a frequency of an RF signal<br>
received through an antenna 118 and provides the RF signal to a baseband<br>
processor 112. Also, the RF unit 120 increases a frequency of a baseband signal<br>
provided from the baseband processor 122, transmits the baseband signals<br>
through the antenna 118. The baseband processor 112 processes the baseband<br>
signals which are transmitted/received between the RF unit 120 and the MPU<br>
100. For example, in case of the data transmission, the baseband processor 112<br>
performs channel coding and spreading transmitting data. In case of the data<br>
reception, the baseband processor 112 performs de-spreading and channel<br>
decoding for received data.<br><br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a procedure for preventing the binary code hacking in a<br>
mobile communication terminal according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. Here, a Download Tool is an application program for transmitting a<br>
new binary code from a Personal Computer (PC) to the mobile terminal.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, in order to transmit a binary code from a Download<br>
Tool in the PC to the mobile communication terminal, a MPU 100 checks if a<br>
download starting signal is received (Step 201). If the download starting key in<br>
the PC is input for transmitting to software from the PC to the terminal, the PC<br>
transmits a download starting signal.<br>
If the binary code starting signal is not received, the MPU 100 performs<br>
a corresponding mode (e.g., waiting mode) in step 213. If the binary code<br>
download starting signal is received, the MPU 100 converts to the binary code<br>
download mode, and checks if the binary code version information to be<br>
downloaded is received in step 203.<br>
If the binary code version information is received, the MPU 100 decodes<br>
the encoded release information stored in the mobile communication terminal in<br>
step 205, and checks the next binary code version information included in the<br>
encoded release information which has been downloaded in previous binary code.<br>
That is, the release information includes the next binary code version information,<br>
the encoded block information of the next binary code, and System ID (SID) and<br>
Network ID (NID) related to an operator.<br>
After this, the MPU 100 proceeds to step 207 and compares the binary<br>
code version information to be downloaded with the next binary code version<br>
information included in the release information.<br><br>
If the two version information (i.e., the binary code version information<br>
to be downloaded and the next binary code version information) is different, the<br>
MPU 100 recognizes the binary code as illegal software by hacking and does not<br>
allow the binary code to be downloaded, and ends the algorithm. While not<br>
shown, if the number of times which the binary code download has not been<br>
allowed exceeds the designated number of times, the MPU 100 prevents the<br>
entering of binary code download mode.<br>
If the two version information is the same, the MPU 100 loads download<br>
module into the RAM 104 in order to download the binary code in step 209,<br>
downloads the binary code in step 211, and ends the algorithm. Here, a part of<br>
the binary code is encoded in order to prevent hacking, as illustrated FIG. 4. Also,<br>
the encoding is performed in units of physical block or logical module.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a general binary code has a boot area 401 and code<br>
areas 403. According to the present invention, in order to prevent the binary code<br>
hacking, a part of the code area is encoded, thereby selectively decoding them for<br>
comparing with the next downloading binary code. Here, some parts of the<br>
encoded code area are contained also in previous version binary code and the<br>
download module is included in the encoding area.<br>
FIG. 3 is a flowchart illustrating a procedure for preventing the binary<br>
code hacking according to an embodiment of the present invention. Hereinafter, a<br>
procedure for preventing the binary code hacking between a terminal and a<br>
download tool will be described. Also, the download tool is assumed that it is an<br>
application program for transmitting a new binary code from a PC (Personal<br>
Computer) to the terminal.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, if a download starting signal is transmitted from the<br>
download tool 303 to the terminal 301 (Step 311), the terminal 301 transmits an<br><br>
ACK which is acknowledging response to the download starting signal receipt to<br>
the download tool 303 (Step 313).<br>
After receiving the response to the download starting signal receipt, the<br>
download tool 303 transmits the version information of the binary code to be<br>
downloaded to the terminal 301 (Step 315). The terminal 301 decodes the pre-<br>
stored release information and compares the next binary code version<br>
information included in the release information with the binary code version<br>
information to be downloaded (Step 317). The encoded release information is<br>
downloaded in previous downloaded binary code and included the encoded block<br>
information of the next binary code, SID (System ID) and NID (Network ID)<br>
related to an operator.<br>
If the two version information (the binary code information to be<br>
downloaded and the next binary code version information) is the same, the<br>
terminal 301 transmits an ACK to the download tool 303, if not, transmits a<br>
NACK (Step 319).<br>
After that, the terminal 301 loads the download module into the RAM in<br>
order to download the binary code, and transmits to the download tool 303 the<br>
ACK which is a signal for notifying that the binary code has been prepared to<br>
download (Step 321). The binary code downloading is performed by deleting<br>
Flash area and writes the downloaded binary code in it. Since all the areas related<br>
to system are deleted, if the download module is not loaded into the RAM, it<br>
does not operate download mode. Thus, the binary code should be loaded into the<br>
RAM for downloading. If the download module loaded into the RAM may be<br>
hacked, thus the download module should be encoded, thereby preventing<br>
hacking. The encoded download module is decoded and loaded into the RAM.<br>
Upon receiving the download preparation completed signal, the binary<br><br>
code is transmitted to the terminal 301 (Step 323). The terminal 301 transmits the<br>
download completed signal to the download tool 303 when it is received all the<br>
binary code (Step 325). When the download of the binary code ends, the<br>
download tool 303 requests a Reset of the download module to the terminal 301<br>
(Step 327), the terminal receives the reset request signal, and then the terminal<br>
301 resets the download module (Step 329). The binary code to be downloaded is<br>
encoded some part of its code area for preventing hacking as illustrated FIG. 4.<br>
Also, the encoding generates in units of physical block or logical module.<br>
An embodiment of a technology for preventing downloading of illegal<br>
software by encoding some parts of the software has been described. As another<br>
embodiment, after decoding a specific information value overlapped in code<br>
areas, an encoded download module, and an EFS(Embedded File System) file<br>
encoded in another format, it can be confirmed if the software is illegally copied<br>
depending whether the values are the same or not.<br>
While the present invention has been shown and described with reference<br>
to certain preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood by those skilled in<br>
the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without<br>
departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention as defined by the<br>
appended claims.<br>
As described above, the present invention advantageously enables to<br>
prevent downloading of the illegal software by encoding some part of code areas<br>
of the binary code to be downloaded in a mobile communication terminal.<br><br>
