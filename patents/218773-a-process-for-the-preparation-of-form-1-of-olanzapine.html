				<td>CRYSTAL. FORMS OF OLANZAPINE AND PROCESSES FOR THEIR PREPARATION Technical field<br>
The present invention, belongs to the field of organic chemistry and relates to a new polymorphic form A of 2-methy]-4-(4-methyl-l-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno [2,3-b] [l,5) bertzodiazepine (hereinafter referred to by its generic name "olanzapine") and some pseudopolymorphic forms, namely solvates of olanzapine, a method for production thereof and a method for preparation of polymorphic form I of olanzapine.<br>
Olanzapine has shown to have activity with regard to the central nervous system and is also useful for the treatment of schizophrenia, schizophreniform disorders, acute mania, mild anxiety states and psychosis.<br>
Technical problem<br>
According to prior art processes, solvents, like methylene chloride and acetonitrile, are used for the crystallization of form I of olanzapine. However, these solvents are not recommended for use in the preparation of pharmaceutical products, as they are hamful. Moreover, haloge-nated solvents such as methylene chloride are not environmentally friendly and therefore their use should be limited. Finally, olanzapine is highly soluble in methylene chloride and there¬fore the yields are not satisfactory for large-scale industrial productioa<br>
Moreover, the prior art processes often do not lead to satisfactory yields of the form I of<br>
olanzapine.<br>
Consequently, there is a need for an improved process to prepare form I of olanzapine.<br>
Further, there is a need for precursors which allow the easy preparation of polymorphic forms of olanzapine or the conversion to other forms of olanzapine.<br>
These problems are solved by the present invention.<br><br>
The invention also relates to a new polymorphic form of olanzapine which is designated "form A of olanzapine", a process for its preparation as well as pharmaceutical compositions comprising it.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The British patent GB 1 533 235 discloses antipsychotically effective thienobenzodiazepines by a generic formula which also covers olanzapine.<br>
US patent 5,229,382 describes olanzapine explicitly. The described process for its production involves a crystallization from acetonitrile, determining the melting point of that crystallized compound at 195°C.<br>
EP-B-733 635 claims crystalline form n olanzapine and this polymorphic form is said to be more stable than the material obtained according to US 5,229,382 which is designated "form I olanzapine". Both the form I and the form II of olanzapine are characterized by e.g. x-ray data. The preparation of the more stable form 11 of olanzapine is effected by dissolving technical grade olanzapine in ethyl acetate and crystallization from the resulting solution by any conventional process such as seeding, cooling, scratching the glass of the reaction vessel or other common techniques.<br>
WO 02/18390 discloses the monohydrate form I and the dihydrate form I of olanzapine, a process for production thereof and a process for production of form I of olanzapine which comprises the steps of stirring olanzapine monohydrate form I or crude olanzapine or form II of olanzapine in methylene chloride at reflux, cooling, filtering and drying. It is also described that a repeating of the process described in US 5,229,382 Example 1, subexample 4 did not lead to formation of form I of olanzapine.<br>
EP-B-733 634 relates to three specific solvates of olanzapine namely the methanol, ethanol and 1-propanol solvates and a process for production technical grade olanzapine by drying the corresponding solvate.<br><br>
EP-B-831 098 relates to processes for preparation of form II of olanzapine by drying olanzapine dihydrate intermediates in a vacuum oven.<br>
EP-A-S31 097 relates to olanzapine dihydrate D.<br>
In WO 01/47933 three new polymorphic forms designated as form DI, IV and V and methods for preparing them are disclosed. The processes involve a dissolving of form I or form n of olanzapine in aqueous organic or anorganic acid and precipitating the desired material by neutralisation.<br>
US patent application 20020086993 discloses new polymorphic form designated as form X of olanzapine and a method for its preparation.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
It has unexpectedly been found that the preparation of form I of olanzapine can easily be accomplished if olanzapine is crystallized by using the non-harmful solvent mixture which comprises 2-propanol.<br>
The process according to the invention for the preparation of form I of olanzapine is characterized by crystallization of olanzapine from the solvent 2-propanol or from a solvent mixture which comprises 2-propanol.<br>
The solvent mixture also comprises at least one further solvent in which olanzapine is soluble and this further solvent is aprotic, in particular selected from the group consisting of tetrahy-drofliran, methylene chloride, acetone, toluene, N, N-dimethylformamide, dimethylsulfoxide, and chloroform.<br>
It is preferred that the solvent mixture comprises 2-propanol and the at least one further sol¬vent in a ratio of 1:0.1 to 5 parts, more preferably 1:0.3 to 3 and most preferably 1:0.5 to 1.5 by volume.<br>
The olanzapine used as a starting materia! can be in any form, e.g. it can be in reaction solution, crude or in anhydrous or solvated form. We have observed that in case a hydrate is used as olanzapine starting material or an aqueous solvent is employed, then formation of hy¬drates in the final product is very likely to occur. Since the product in form of hydrates is not desirable, it is preferred to avoid hydrates as starting material and aqueous solvents. The final form I of olanzapine obtained will therefore be preferably substantially free from hydrates. Form I of olanzapine obtained by the process of this invention contains preferably less than 0.5%, more preferably less than 0.2% and most preferably less than 0.1% by weight of associated water.<br><br>
The process for preparing form I of olanzapine usually involves dissolving of olanzapine starling material in a solvent mixture which comprises 2-propanol, and then crystallizing and recovering the product by conventional processes.<br>
In the following preferred embodiments of the process are described.<br>
The process preferably involves a heating of the mixture of the olanzapine starting material and the solvent until a clear solution is obtained, in particular a heating to temperatures from 30°C to the boiling point of the solvent, preferably from 50 to 55°C. After the clear solution is obtained, a part of the solvent is evaporated under vacuum at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 60°C, preferably at 30 to 35°C. It is preferred that the evaporated part of the solvent makes up 20 to 70%, based on the total volume of solvents. After evaporation, a seeding of the remaining solution with crystals of form I of olanzapine is conducted. Seeding with higher amounts of polymorph form I, such as for example 10 %, increases the speed of crystallization. The product can then be isolated by conventional processes including further vacuum evaporation at the same temperature so that the total volume of the solvent is reduced by 30 to 90% or by cooling the solution to about room temperature, i.e. about 20°C. At temperatures below room temperature, the formation of solvates is favoured.<br>
In a fiirther preferred embodiment, the process according to the invention is carried out by using the olanzapine starting material in form of a solvate of olanzapine. Preferably, the solvate is at least one of the group consisting of a methylene chloride solvate, a 2-propanol solvate and an acetonitrile mixed solvates of olanzapine. The mixed solvates have incorporated acetonitrile and water (acetonitrile/water mixed solvate) or acetonitrile, methylene chloride and water (acetonitrile/methylene chloride/water mixed solvate).<br>
When using a solvate of olanzapine as starting material, then it is preferred that the crystallisation of form I of olanzapine is performed at a temperature of 15 to 35°C, in particular at room temperature.<br>
Form I of olanzapine is rather difficult to be prepared in substantially pure form, because formation of the thermodynamically more stable form 11 is favoured. However, by using the above crystallization conditions, it was possible to prepare form I of olanzapine with yields<br><br>
higher than 70%. According to the process of the present invention substantially pure form I free from form 11 and solvates could be obtained.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention are specific solvates of olanzapine, a process for the preparation thereof and their use in the preparation of in particular anhydrous forms of form I of olanzapine.<br>
We have found out that the 2-propanol solvate, the acetonitrile solvate and the methylene chloride solvate could be formed. The latter solvate was found to exist in two forms with different molar ratio between the olanzapine and methylene chloride.<br>
Depending on the form, the solvates can be transformed to forms I, H , IE, IV, V, X, to the new form A of olanzapine or to the mixture thereof, described hereinafter.<br>
Powder x-ray diffraction patterns were measured on a Siemens D-5000 diffractometer with Cu Ka radiation, 2-theta range from 7 to 30 degree, step 0.034 degree 2-theta, divergent slit 20 mm and receiving slit 0.6 mm. The characteristic powder diffraction peaks are expressed in degrees 2-theta.<br>

The 2-propanol solvate of olanzapine according to the invention is prepared by suspending olanzapine in a mixture of 2-propanol and a further solvent in which olanzapine is soluble, such as tetrahydrofluran or methylene chloride, heating the mixture to obtain a clear solution, cooling the solution preferably to temperatures from 10°C to -30°C, or evaporating a part of the solvent, and isolating the product by conventional processes.<br>

characterised by the following spectra, the both forms can be in particular distinguished by IR<br>
spectra:<br>

Typical   X-ray   diffraction   pattern   is   represented   by   following   2-theta   degrees<br>
accompanied with intensities:<br><br>
possible solvents is preferably 1:0.1 to 5 parts, preferably 1:0.1 to 3.0 and most preferred 1:0.2 to 1.5.<br>
The mixture is usually heated to a temperature of from 30oC to the boiling point of the mixture, preferably 40-60"C, to obtain the clear solution. It is further preferred to evaporate solvent from the clear solution under vacuum at temperatures ranging from 0°C to 60°C, - preferably 30 to 40°C. The evaporated part of the solvent should make up from 10 to 70% based on the total volume of solvents. Usually, the desired form A of olanzapine can be reco¬vered by cooling or seeding of the solution with crystals of form A. The product can then be further dried in vacuum.<br>
If the solution is rapidly cooled to temperatures under 5°C, then an acetonitrile/methylene chloride/water mixed solvate is usually formed. This solvate can, however, be transformed to form A of olanzapine by drying.<br>
This new polymorphic form A is stable and therefore particularly suited for incorporation in phaimaceutical preparations. The invention therefore also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising form A of olanzapine.<br>
The polymorphic form A of olanzapine can be formulated in a pharmaceutical composition in combination with one or more pharmaceutical acceptable excipients which can be either solid, semisolid or liquid. Pharmaceutical formulation can be prepared by any conventional techniques such as direct compression, dry and wet granulation, with or without final coating of the dosage form.<br>
The final dosage form including form A of olanzapine can be in any conventional unit dosage forms such as granules, pellets, tablets, film coated tablets, fast dispersible tablets, capsules, suspensions and solutions for oral use, transdermal patches, suppositories, parenteral products, etc.<br>
