				<td>Thc present invention relates to a process for the preparation of chlorinated melnniine-formaldehyde heat resistant resin solution useful for providing thermal barrier coatings.<br>
Chlorinated melaniine-formaldehyde heat resistant resin solution may be used to produce thermal barrier materials in various forms required for applications in aluminium casting industries, electrical industries and   railways. This type of resin can replace other polymers and insulation materials with a product offering simpler application, better performance with thermal barrier against oxidative decomposition and fire retardant properties. This thermal barrier coatings may be applied on various substrates such as   glass fabric,   glass   wool,   glass mat, cellulosic   materials,   natural fibre materials which results in thermal barrier coated materials and are not easily affected by heat upto 800°C. In the previous methods of producing heat resistant thermal barrier materials, melamine-formaldehyde resin of various grades based on di, tri-, tetra-, penta-, or hexamethylolmclamines were used in many applications  such as   molding resins; adhesive* (mainly for plywood and furniture); laminating resins for table tops; textile resins to impart crease resistance, stiffness, shrinkage control, water repellancy, and in alkyd resin preparations to give baking enamels such as for automotive finishes - Reference may be made to (1) S.R.Sandler &amp; W. Karo, Polymer Synthesis, vol.11 P16 (1977) academic press, N.Y, (2) P.J. Flory, Chem . Rev. 39, 137 (1946); Principles of Polymer Chemistry, Cornell Univ. Press, Ithaca, New York, 1953, (3) T.R. Manley, J. Polym. Sci. Symp. No. 42,1377 (1973), (4) G.Pritchard, Appl. ScS. Publishers Ltd., London, 166 (1980,   (5) R.T. Conley, Proc. Battelle Mem. Inst. Symp., Thermal Stability of Polymers, Columbus, Ohio<br>
 (Dec. 1963) EJ-E63 - wherein the thermal oxidative deterioration occurred in three phases   as (1) break down   of  ether   links between   200° and   300°C, (2) methylene links between 370°- 380°C, and (3) the residual char decomposition at400°C, because of poor heat barrier properties. Main drawbacks of the above processes are :<br>
Mehunine-formaldehyde resin in general, liberates formaldehyde at 140°C due to decomposition of mcthylene groups. The ether links also break between 200°-300°C due to loss of formaldehyde and the methylene links of the resin break at 400°C due to decomposition of triazine ring present in the inelatnine-formaldehyde resin. Oxygen diffusion and heat and mass transfer occured between the gas and the condensed phases. This has resulted due to degradation of the material at 350°C - the reference for which may be made to "M. Lewin, S.M. Atlas and E.M. Pearce, Flame Retardant Polymeric Materials, Plenum Press, N.Y. (1975)".<br>
Hence similar to the application of halogen and phosphorous compound in the form of zinc chloride and phosphoric acid to the cellulosic fibre, attempts have been made by several investigators to produce heat resistant polymers by the application of different fire retardant chemicals but the surface functionality was not much improved - Reference may be made to (1) W.A. Rosser et al., Mechanism of name inhibition, Final Report, Contract No. DA-44-009-ENG-2863 (1958), (2) C.T. Pumpelly, in Bromine and its compounds (Z.E. Jolles, ed.) Ernest Benn. Ltd., London (1966).<br>
