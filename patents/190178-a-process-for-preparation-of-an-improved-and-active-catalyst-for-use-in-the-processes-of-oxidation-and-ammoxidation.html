				<td>This invention relates to a process for preparation of an improved and active catalyst, particularly it relates to a process for preparation of an improved and active catalyst of formula VvSbmAaDdOx for use in the processes of oxidation and ammoxidation. It also relates to the catalyst so made. In another aspect the invention relates to the oxidation and ammoxidation of paraffins, olefins and aromatic compounds.<br>
Catalysts containing vanadium and antimony in oxide form, and usually containing tin or titanium, or both, as part of the metal oxide catalyst are normally calcined before using to catalyze the ammoxidation of paraffins, olefins and various aromatics; such calcination is above 750°C and activates the composition to make effective ammoxidation catalysts.<br>
It has now been found that such catalysts can be even further activated to increase the activity of conversion of the feedstock and the selectivity of conversion to a nitrile by the heat treatment of the catalyst previously activated by calcining at a temperature above 750°C, wherein the heat treatment is at an effective temperature at least 50°C below the highest calcination temperature.<br>
In a broad aspect of the method of the invention we have found that heat treating a catalyst calcined at a calcining temperature above 750°C at a temperature which is at least 500°C and at least 50°C below the calcining temperature is improved in its activity for converting the feed, such as propane or propylene to acrylonitrile.<br>
In a now preferred embodiment of the method for making an even more active catalyst, the catalyst which has been calcined at a temperature above 750°C and thereafter heat treated at the lower temperature, is contacted with a liquidbelieved to be a solvent for some minute quantity of a deleterious (generally well less than 1% of the composition) compound containing V and Sb in oxide form, and the bulk of the "solvent" separated from the catalyst.<br>
In this aspect of the invention there can be used various "solvents" that have been used to so treat such V and Sb catalysts in oxide form following calcination above 750°C. These include water, aqueous solutions of acids or bases, such as phosphoric, sulfuric and acetic acids and NH3 and NaOH solutions; and the hydroxy compounds of U.S. patent 5,094,989: cyclohexanol; cyclopentanol; a monohydroxy, acyclic hydrocarbon having 1-8 C atoms; and a dihydroxy, acyclic hydrocarbon having 2-4 carbon atoms.<br>
The catalyst to which the improved method applies contains the elements and relative amounts indicated by the formula:<br>
VvSbmA.DdOx<br>
wherein	A when present is Sn and/or Ti;<br>
D when present is one or more of Li, Mg, Na, Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Fe, Cr, Ga, Ni, Zn, Ge, Nb, Zr, Mo, W, Cu, Te, Ta, Se, Bi, Ce, In, As, B, Al and Mn;<br>
and wherein<br>
all of the elements of said formula except oxygen are present as cations, and<br>
v is 1<br>
m is 0.5-10<br>
a is up to 10<br>
d is up to 10<br>
x is determined by the oxidation state of the cations present<br>
In a more specific aspect of the invention the catalyst to which the method applies has the relation<br>
v + m + a &gt; 0.5d.<br>
The process for improving the catalysts is most often applied to such foregoing catalysts wherein a is 
In the above formula the phrase "when present" means that A may be zero and that D may be zero. Thus, the catalysts can contain essentially only V and Sb.<br>
The highest calcination temperature of the catalysts above 7500C before the relatively low temperature heat treatment step of the process of the invention can be as high as 12000C, but is usually over 7500C and up to 10500C, most often up to 9500C.<br>
The present catalyst is useful for the oxidation and ammoxidation of paraffins, olefins and aromatic compounds in a reaction zone. In particular, in this aspect of the invention especially useful reactions include the ammoxidation of propane with NH3 and 02 to acrylonitrile, the ammoxidation of propylene with NH3 and 02 to acrylonitrile, the ammoxidation of a methyl pyridine with 02 and NH3 to the corresponding cyanopyridine, and the ammoxidation of m-xylene with 02 and NH3 to isophthalonitrile.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a process for preparation of an improved and active catalyst of formula VvSbmAaDdOx for use in the processes of oxidation and ammoxidation, wherein the process comprises following steps:<br>
a)	calcination of a catalyst of the kind such as hereindescribed at a calcining temperature above 750°C to form a calcined catalyst in the manner such as hereindescribed,<br>
b)	heat treating the calcined catalyst at an effective temperature, which is at least 50 C below the calcining temperature optionally contacting with a liquid of the kind such as hereindescribed to form an active catalyst in the manner such as hereindescribed,<br>
wherein the catalyst and the calcined catalyst of step-a) and the active catalyst of step-b) have the elements and relative amounts indicated by the formula:<br>
VvSbmAaDdOx<br>
wherein<br>
V represents vanadium;	<br>
Sb represents antimony;<br>
A represents Sn and/or Ti;<br>
D represents one or more of Li, Mg, Na, Ca, Sr, Ba, Co, Fe, Cr, Ga, Ni, Zn,<br>
Ge, Nb, Zr, Mo, W, Cu, Te, Ta, Se, Bi, Ce, In, As, B, Al and Mn;<br>
O represents oxygen;<br>
and wherein<br>
all of the elements of said formula except oxygen are present as cations, and<br>
v is 1,<br>
m is 0.5 to 10,<br>
a is upto 10,<br>
d is upto 10,<br>
x    is    determined    by    the    oxidation    state    of   the    cations    present.<br>
The following specific examples are illustrative only and are not to be considered in any way limiting.<br>
Catalyst Example 1<br>
27.42g of V205 powder was added to a solution consisting of 100 ml of 30% H202 in 900 ml of water in a 2 liter beaker.

Catalyst Example 4 27.44g V205 was added to a solution consisting of 100ml 30% H202 in 900ml of water in a 2 liter beaker.   The mixture was stirred without heating for about 6 hours to produce a deep red sol/gel.  It was then stirred overnight at room temperature.   61.26g Sb203 was then added and the resulting mixture was heated to boiling and allowed to boil with a watch glass covering the beaker for about 3 hours. Water was periodically added to the beaker to keep the mixture stirring and the volume of the mixture constant.   During the heating the mixture turned green then gray then gray-black. At this point 84.56g of a 10.7 weight percent tin oxide sol and 2.4g of Ti02 were added and the mixture was evaporated to near dryness on the hot plate with constant stirring.  The resulting paste was then dried at 120°C overnight. The dried material was heat treated at 650 °C for 8 hours then ground and screened and the 20-35 mesh particles were collected.   A portion of the 20-35 mesh particles was heat treated at 810°C for 3 hours. A portion of the 810°C calcined particles was washed three times with isobutanol by using about 50ml of isobutanol per 8 grams of catalyst.   The particles were placed in a coarse glass frit funnel, covered with<br>
isobutanol and the isobutanol was allowed to pass through the glass frit without suction. The resulting material was then placed in an oven at 120°C for several hours to remove residual isobutanol. The composition was then heat treated for 3 hours at 650°C*.  As will be seen by reference to Table 1, an improvement was<br>
effected in yield and selectivity by the later 650°C heat treatment, compared to<br>

Catalyst Example 5<br>
27.44g V2O5 was added to a solution consisting of 100ml 30% H202<br>
in 900ml of water in a 2 liter beaker.   The mixture was stirred without heating for<br>
about 6 hours to produce a deep red sol/gel.   It was then stirred overnight at room<br>

Comparative Catalyst Example C 27.44g V205 was added to a solution consisting of 100ml 30% H202 in 900ml of water in a 2 liter beaker. The mixture was stirred without heating for about 6 hours to produce a deep red sol/gel. It was then stirred overnight at room temperature. 61.26g Sb203 was then added and the resulting mixture was heated to boiling and allowed to boil with a watch glass covering the beaker for about 3 hours. Water was periodically added to the beaker to keep the mixture stirring and the volume of the mixture constant. During the heating the mixture turned green then gray then gray-black. At this point 84.56g of a 10.7 weight percent tin oxide sol and 2.4g of Ti02 were added and the mixture was evaporated to hear dryness on the hot plate with constant stirring. The resulting paste was then dried at 120°C overnight. The dried material was heat treated at 650°C for 8 hours then ground and screenedand the 20-35 mesh particles were collected. A portion of the 20-35 mesh particles was calcined at 810°C for 3 hours. This was designated Comparative Catalyst Example C. Results of testing this catalyst in the ammoxidation of propane are shown in Table 1.<br>
Catalyst Example 6 27.44g V2O5 was added to a solution consisting of 100ml 30% H202 in 900ml of water in a 2 liter beaker.   The mixture was stirred without heating for about 6 hours to produce a deep red sol/gel.   It was then stirred overnight at room temperature.   61.26g Sb203 was then added and the resulting mixture was heated to boiling and allowed to boil with a watch glass covering the beaker for about 3 hours. Water was periodically added to the beaker to keep the mixture stirring and the volume of the mixture constant.   During the heating the mixture turned green then gray then gray-black.  At this point 84.56g of a 10.7 weight percent tin oxide sol and 2.4g of Ti02 were added and the mixture was evaporated to near dryness on the hot plate with constant stirring.  The resulting paste was then dried at 120°C overnight. The dried material was heat treated at 650°C for 8 hours then ground and screened and the 20-35 mesh particles were collected.   A portion of the 20-35 mesh particles was calcined at 810°C for 3 hours and then heat treated according to the invention at 650°C for 3 hours.   As will be seen in Table 1, there is an improvement in the yield and selectivity in the ammoxidation of propane brought about by the final lower temperature heat treatment at 650°C.   Compare the results with the results when using Comparative Catalyst Example C.<br>
Catalyst Example 7 27.44g V205 powder was added to a solution consisting of 100ml 30% H202 in 900ml of water in a 2 liter beaker.
