CROSS REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br><br>
[0001] This application is related to and claims priority from pending U.S. Provisional Application Number 60/846,073 filed September 21 , 2006, and is further related to: U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006-0041680 (U.S. Application No. 10/530,546) to Proctor et al., which is entitled "REDUCING LOOP EFFECTS IN A WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORK REPEATER; and U.S. Patent Publication No. 2005- 0286448 to Proctor (U.S. Application No. 10/516,327 or International Application No. PCT/US03/16208) to Proctor et al., which is entitled "WIRELESS LOCAL AREA NETWORK REPEATER" the contents all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br><br>
[0002] The technical field relates generally to a repeater for a wireless communication network, and, more particularly, to a repeater configuration for reducing oscillations among two or more repeaters or repeater sections.<br><br>
BACKGROUND<br><br>
[0003] Conventionally, the coverage area of a wireless communication network such as, for example, a Time Division Duplex (TDD), Frequency Division Duplex (FDD) Wireless-Fidelity (Wi-Fi), Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access (Wi-max), Cellular, Global System for Mobile communications (GSM), Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA), or 3G based wireless network can be increased by a repeater. <br><br>
Exemplary repeaters include, for example, frequency translating repeaters or same frequency repeaters which operate in the physical layer or data link layer as defined by the Open Systems Interconnection Basic Reference Model (OSI Model).<br><br>
[0004] Repeaters are also used to satisfy the increasing need to extend the range of nodes such as access points associated with wireless networks, including but not limited to wireless local area networks (WLANs) and wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs) described and specified in the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) 802.11, 802.16 and 802.20 standards due to the increasing popularity of unrestrained access to broadband services by, for example, portable computing devices. The effective proliferation of wireless networks depends heavily on sustaining and increasing performance levels as user demands increase.<br><br>
[0005] However, when multiple repeaters occupy the same radio frequency environment, problems, such as, oscillation between repeaters can arise. Oscillations can lead to a host of problems such as distortion, saturation, loss of synchronization, and data or information loss.<br><br>
[0006] Further, the problem of "scalability" of many closely located repeaters must be addressed. For instance, when repeaters are deployed in close proximity in a multi- tenant dwelling, an effective coverage area may become so large as to cause a "flooding" of packets. While the coverage area has been greatly enhanced, there may be inefficiency due to limited capacity for a large number of users.<br><br>
[0007] Therefore, there is a need for low cost and low risk solutions to such oscillation problems. Preferably, the solution will be extendible to allow for more capability than simply preventing multi-repeater oscillation. <br><br>
SUMMARY<br><br>
[0008] In view of the above problems, a repeater operating in a wireless network according to various embodiments mitigates oscillation so that it will substantially not repeat a signal from another repeater in the wireless network in an oscillating state. The wireless network can include a second repeater capable of communicating with the first repeater, and first and second wireless station devices such as an access point and a wireless computing device capable of communicating with at least one of the first repeater and the second repeater.<br><br>
[0009] According to various embodiments, the repeater includes a reception device for receiving a wireless signal at a reception frequency; a detector for detecting if a predetermined portion of the received wireless signal includes a modified portion to thereby determine that the received signal is from the second repeater; and a transmission device for transmitting the wireless signal to one of the first and second wireless station devices at a transmission frequency to thereby repeat the wireless signal.<br><br>
[0010] If the predetermined portion of the received wireless signal includes the modified portion, the transmission device can be configured to not repeat a substantial portion of the wireless signal, to transmit the wireless signal at a frequency different from the transmission frequency, or transmit the wireless signal at a power level different from an original transmission power level.<br><br>
[0011] The repeater can further include a signal modification device for modifying the wireless signal. The signal modification device can be, for example, a notch processor configured to insert a notch pattern on the wireless signal to be transmitted and to detect a notch pattern inserted on a wireless signal as the modified portion. <br><br>
[0012] The signal modification device can also be, for example, a bi-phase modulation device configured to modulate a phase of the predetermined portion of the wireless signal. The bi-phase modulator can modulate the predetermined portion of the wireless signal to have a unique signature recognizable by the second repeater upon receiving the modified wireless signal. A surface acoustic wave (SAW) filter can be coupled to the output of the bi-phase modulator to remove spectral splattering from the modified wireless signal. A timing circuit can also be coupled to the bi-phase modulator for controlling an amount of time during which the bi-phase modulator modulates the phase of the predetermined portion of the wireless signal.<br><br>
[0013] The bi-phase modulator can includes a transfer switch coupled to an input of a linear oscillator (LO), the transfer switch switching positive and negative inputs of the LO at a predetermined frequency to modulate the phase of the predetermined portion of the wireless signal.<br><br>
[0014] The repeater can further include a de-modification device such as a demodulation device for removing the modified portion from the predetermined portion of the wireless signal.<br><br>
[0015] The transmission device is configured to transmit or not transmit the wireless signal if the predetermined portion of the received wireless signal includes the modified portion.<br><br>
[0016] The predetermined portion of the received wireless signal can be a preamble of the wireless signal and the modified portion can be a predetermined phase variation.<br><br>
[0017] The detector can further be configured to detect if the wireless signal was transmitted from one of the first and second wireless station devices by performing a <br><br>
qualifying detection process on the received wireless signal. The qualifying detection process can include correlating a preamble of the received wireless signal to a predetermined signal pattern or demodulating one of a predetermined information sequence, a pilot channel and a pilot carrier.<br><br>
[0018] The repeater can be one of a frequency translating repeater in which the reception frequency and transmission frequency are different, and a same frequency repeater in which the reception frequency and transmission frequency are same.<br><br>
[0019] The repeater can also include a processor and a memory coupled to the processor. A power adjustment routine for configuring the CPU can be stored in the memory. The processor can be configured to: generate probe packets to be transmitted to the second repeater at the transmission frequency; measure a received signal strength indication (RSSI) of a packet received in response to the probe packets; determine if a path loss defined by a difference between a power level at which the probe packets were transmitted and the measured RSSI is less than a predetermined value; and mark the transmission frequency as unavailable for use if the path loss is less than the predetermined value.<br><br>
[0020] The processor can further be configured to: generate a group of packets to be transmitted to the second repeater at the transmission frequency if the path loss is not less than approximately 80 dB; determine an average RSSI for the group of packets; and if the average RSSI is less than a predetermined level, mark a current transmission power as acceptable.<br><br>
[0021] The processor can further be configured to: adjust the current transmission power downward by a predetermined decibel level if the average RSSI is less not than the <br><br>
predetermined level; regenerate the group of packets to be transmitted to the second repeater at the transmission frequency; determine an average RSSI for the group of packets; and if the average RSSI is less than a predetermined level, mark a current transmission power as acceptable.<br><br>
[0022] Additional detection capability included in the repeaters can enable detection of the preamble with the phase modulated sequence and additional communications. For instance, it may be desired that packets from some repeaters may be re-repeated, while those from other repeaters are not repeated. Another example would be that only packets with a specific signature are allowed to be repeated and all others are filtered off. Other actions may include placing packets with a unique signature on a unique repeated frequency, and as such the signature may act as an addressing function, a quality of service code, or a priority code.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br><br>
[0049] In overview, the present disclosure concerns a repeater configuration for mitigating oscillation. The instant disclosure is provided to further explain in an enabling fashion the best modes of performing one or more embodiments of the present invention. The use of relational terms such as first and second, and the like, if any, are used solely to distinguish one from another entity, item, or action without necessarily requiring or implying any actual such relationship or order between such entities, items or actions. It is noted that some embodiments may include a plurality of processes or steps, which can be performed in any order, unless expressly and necessarily limited to a particular order; i.e., processes or steps that are not so limited may be performed in any order.<br><br>
[0050] Much of the inventive functionality and many of the inventive principles when implemented, are best supported with or in computer instructions (software) or integrated circuits (ICs), and/or application specific ICs. It is expected that one of ordinary skill, notwithstanding possibly significant effort and many design choices motivated by, for example, available time, current technology, and economic considerations, when guided by the concepts and principles disclosed herein will be readily capable of generating such software instructions or ICs with minimal experimentation. Therefore, in the interest of brevity and minimization of any risk of obscuring the principles and concepts according to the present invention, further discussion of such software and ICs, if any, will be limited to the essentials with respect to the principles and concepts used by the exemplary embodiments.<br><br>
[0051] Referring now to FIG. 16, a wide area connection 101, which could be, for example, an Ethernet connection, a Tl line, a wideband wireless connection or any other <br><br>
electrical connection providing a data communications path, may be connected to a wireless gateway, or access point (AP) 100. The wireless gateway 100 sends RF signals, such as, for example, IEEE 802.11 packets or signals based upon Bluetooth, Hyperlan, or other wireless communication protocols, to client units 104, 105, which may be personal computers, personal digital assistants, or any other devices capable of communicating with other like devices through one of the above mentioned wireless protocols. A wireless gateway, AP, or client device will be referred to here as a wireless station. Respective propagation, or RF, paths to each of the client units 104, 105 are shown as 102, 103.<br><br>
[0052] While the signal carried over RF path 102 is of sufficient strength to maintain high-speed data packet communications between the client unit 104 and the wireless gateway 100, the signals carried over the RF path 103 and intended for the client unit 105 would be attenuated when passing through a structural barrier such as walls 106 or 107 to a point where few, if any, data packets are received in either direction if not for wireless repeaters 200, 204.<br><br>
[0053] To enhance the coverage and/or communication data rate to the client unit 105, wireless repeaters 200, 204 receive packets transmitted on an initial frequency channel 201 from the wireless gateway 100, access point or another repeater. The wireless repeater 200 detects the presence of a packet on the first frequency channel 201 and receives the packet and re-transmits the packet with more power on a second frequency channel 202. Similarly, the wireless repeater 204 detects the presence of the packet on the second frequency channel 202, receives the packet and re-transmits the packet with more power on a third frequency channel 203. Unlike conventional WLAN <br><br>
operating protocols, the client unit 105 operates on the third frequency channel, even though the wireless gateway 100 operates on the first frequency channel 203. To perform the return packet operation, the wireless repeater 204 detects the presence of a transmitted packet on the third frequency channel 203 from the client unit 105, receives the packet on the third frequency channel 203, and re-transmits the packet on the second frequency channel 202. The wireless repeater 200 detects the presence of a transmitted packet on the second frequency channel 202 from wireless repeater 204, receives the packet on the second frequency channel 202, and re-transmits the packet on the first frequency channel 201. The wireless gateway 100 then receives the packet on the first frequency channel 201. In this way, the wireless repeaters 200, 204 are capable of simultaneously receiving and transmitting signals as well as extending the coverage and performance of the wireless gateway 100 to the client unit 105. When many units are isolated from one another, the repeaters 200, 204 can further act as a wireless bridge allowing two different groups of units to communicate where optimum RF propagation and coverage or, in many cases, any RF propagation and coverage was not previously possible.<br><br>
[0054] However, as described herein above, repeater systems using frequency translation may encounter problems, for example, when beacon signals are used. Accordingly, range extension may be realized in such systems using repeaters for wireless local area networks and may be particularly advantageous when specific protocols are used, such as, for example, the 802.11 series of protocols by modifying the beacon signal to reflect the frequency translation. As noted however problems arise when adjacent nodes using or re-using translated frequencies within range of each other may establish false connections which lead to problems from node to node in terms of <br><br>
data traffic integrity. False connections may also lead to repeater to repeater oscillations when both repeaters are using the same frequency pairs and may further lead to system problems causing a general failure in the WLAN environment. The problems also arise on same frequency repeaters.<br><br>
[0055] Wireless repeaters 200, 204 convert packets from an initial frequency channel to a different frequency channel, where it may be received by one or more clients, such as station devices (STA) or client units 104 or 105, or a different repeater. Client units 104 or 105 preferably receive a beacon identifying an 802.1 Ib channel as being the appropriate channel for communication, and would receive information packets translated by the repeater 200, 204 from a first channel to a second channel.<br><br>
[0056] A problematic repeater condition may arise however, in exemplary scenario 300, as illustrated FIG. 17, wherein two repeaters Rl 320 and R2 330 are configured to service one AP 310 which is within the transmit range of both repeaters via, for example, wireless connections 301 and 303. Repeaters Rl 320 and R2 330 may further be capable of listening to each other's respective transmissions via a connection established over, for example, link 302. In exemplary scenario 300, the only connection established to communication unit or station device or STA 340 is connection 304 which as will be appreciated is a wireless or RF link. Problems arise when repeaters Rl 320 and R2 330 are operating on the same pair of channels, such as AP and repeater channels. When AP 310 transmits, both Rl 320 and R2 330 detect the transmission on, for example, a first frequency Fl and retransmit on a second frequency F2, such as the repeater channel. The primary problems arise when an isolated client station STA 340 transmits on F2 which, as describe above, is the repeater channel. R2 330 then repeats the transmission on Fl to <br><br>
AP 310. Rl 320 detects the transmissions from R2 330 on Fl and tries to retransmit the detected transmissions. IfRl 320 happens to select F2 as the transmit frequency, a loop will be established between Rl 320 and R2 330. With sufficient gain, the RF loop may oscillate, via, for example, positive feedback causing any signals destined for STA 340 over connection 304 to be jammed. It should be noted that the above RF loop does not occur if both repeaters detect the signal on the Fl because once they detect a signal on Fl they disable their receivers on F2 and then start repeating on F2.<br><br>
[0057] Referring to FIG. 18A, a repeater 1800 for mitigating the above-described oscillation according to a first embodiment will be described. The repeater may be, for example, a frequency translating repeater as discussed above or a same-frequency repeater. The repeater 1800 includes first and second antennas (ANTA, ANT B) serving as reception and transmission devices for receiving and transmitting signals on first and second channels. A signal received via one of the first antenna ANTA or second antenna ANTB is processed by processing elements such as a low noise amplifier (LNA), image reject filter (IRF), field effect transistor (FET) mixer, surface acoustic wave (SAW) filters, amplifier, is split and propagated on two different signals paths by, for example, splitter 1816. One of the split signal paths from the splitter 1816 is preferably coupled to a logarithmic amplifier 1820 via an amplifier and the other split signal path is preferably coupled to an adjustable gain control (AGC) element 1822 for adjusting the gain of the signal. A first output of the logarithmic amplifier 1820, which is preferably a signal representative of the amplitude envelope of the received signal strength indication (RSSI), is fed to a control portion of the AGC element 1822 for adjusting the gain control, to a processor 1825 and to a comparator 1823 for comparing the RSSI level of <br><br>
the signal with a predetermined RSSI threshold received from the processor 1825. A second output of logarithmic amplifier 1820 is fed to a digital demodulator 1824 via various digital elements for performing direct-sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) or orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) detection and demodulation, and internal packet generation. The digital demodulator 1824 can perform such detection by, for example, analyzing preamble information specific to DSSS and OFDM WLAN packets generally located in the first few symbols of a packet, such as an 802.11 packet. The digital demodulator 1824 or the repeater entirely can be placed in a WLAN only configuration by, for example, the processor 1825.<br><br>
[0058] The output of the comparator 1823 is fed to a sequencer 1826 (CMP_A_EN terminal). The comparator 1823 can output a signal indicative of a detected signal when the RSSI is greater than the predetermined threshold, thus indicative of a signal to be repeated. In response to the signal from the comparator 1823, as well as other indications, the sequencer 1826 will output an enable signal (not shown) to the demodulator 1824 to begin demodulating the signal as well as various control outputs that will begin the physical repeating of the signal. Subsequently, the sequencer 1826 will also output a signal to an AND gate 1828. The AND gate 1828 also receives a microprocessor enable signal from the processor 1825, and outputs an enable signal to timing circuitry 1830 if the enable signals are received from both the sequencer 1826 and the processor 1825. The timing circuitry 1830 controls a bi-phase modulator (signal modification device) 1832, which receives the output signal from the AGC element 1822 via an amplifier 1834 and additional circuitry. An exemplary circuit for the timing circuitry 1830 is shown in FIG. 19. PA EN represents the enable signal from the <br><br>
sequencer 1826, and BPSK-EN represents the enable signal from the processor 1825. 11 MHz is the clock for the timing circuitry 1830.<br><br>
[0059] The bi-phase modulator 1832 modifies the signal by adding an amount of phase variation to modulate, for example, the first few symbols of a packet to be repeated. The bi-phase modulator 1832 can include, for example, transfer switches for switching the differential signal received from the amplifier 1834 to thereby add the phase variation. An exemplary circuit for the bi-phase modulator 1832 is shown in FIG. 20. The length of time for applying the phase modulation to the repeated signal can be adjusted by the timing circuitry 1830 connected to the comparator output (see signals MOD P and M0D_N which are from the timing circuitry 1830). The timing circuitry 1830 can be triggered by a hit on the comparator 1823. Once the timing circuitry 1830 stops, the switching of the positive and negative inputs can be stopped and normal operation can be commenced.<br><br>
[0060] The output of the bi-phase modulator 1832 is fed to a SAW filter 1836 for removing any spectral splattering created by the phase modulation performed by the biphase modulator 1832. The signal can then be transmitted by one of the first or second antennas ANTA, ANTB via the mixer 1838 and additional analog elements to an access point, wireless station or client device (wireless station).<br><br>
[0061] Referring to FIG. 18B, in a modification to the first embodiment, the bi-phase modulator 1832 can be coupled to, for example, a 1056 MHz linear oscillator 1840 and an active mixer 1842. The length of time for applying the phase modulation to the repeated signal is still adjusted by the timing circuitry 1830. The positive and negative inputs of the 1056 MHz linear oscillator 1840 going to the active mixer 1842 can be <br><br>
switched back and forth at, for example, a 5.5 MHz rate. Switching the positive and negative inputs will impart the phase modulation onto the repeated signal. Once the timing circuitry 1830 stops, the switching of the positive and negative inputs can be stopped and normal operation can be commenced.<br><br>
[0062] During repeater operation, when the repeater 1800 is placed in the standard operating mode of WLAN only, the digital demodulator 1824 (DSSS/OFDM detector) will not recognize packets having symbols phase modulated by another repeater as valid WLAN packets, thereby stopping the repeating process because the existing phase relationships are disrupted by the signal modification. Therefore, when the repeater 1800 receives a repeated signal from a similar repeater 1800, it will not re-repeat the signal. As a result, the problem related to oscillation as discussed above can be mitigated.<br><br>
[0063] Further, the phase variation added to the signal by the bi-phase modulator 1832 is transparent to wireless stations receiving the modified signal because carrier recovery is not performed until, for example, the fifth or sixth symbol of an incoming stream.<br><br>
[0064] In an alternative embodiment, an external phase modulator can advantageously be placed after the amplifier 1834. In addition, a simple timer to control the 5.5MHz clock can be generated by dividing down an existing clock such as an 11 MHz processor clock. Further, the signal modification can be performed at the output of the mixer 1838 rather than the amplifier. However, the output of amplifier 1834 is preferably used because of the difficulty accessing the data stream coming out of the modulator in order to add the phase at base-band for signals coming out of the modulator. Accordingly, the phase modulator 1832 is triggered by either a comparator hit or anytime <br><br>
a modulated signal is generated. It should be noted that the signal modified may be a self-generated signal or a received signal.<br><br>
[0065] Returning to the exemplary scenario 300 illustrated in FIG. 17, advantages achieved by the repeater implemented according to the various embodiments above will be discussed. Here, assuming that the repeaters Rl 320 and R2 330 both include the digital demodulator 1824 and phase modulator 1832, and are both placed in a WLAN only configuration, if the repeaters Rl 320 and R2 330 are operating on the same pair of channels, such as AP and repeater channels, when AP 310 transmits, both Rl 320 and R2 330 detect the transmission on, for example, the first frequency Fl and retransmit on the second frequency F2. However, before transmission, the phase modulator 1832 of the repeater modifies the first few symbols of packets in the transmitted signal. When an isolated client station STA 340 transmits on F2, R2 330 then repeats the transmission on Fl to AP 310. Rl 320 detects the transmissions from R2 330 on Fl ; however, Rl 320 cannot demodulate the repeated signal because the first few symbols include the phase variation. Thus, the repeater R2 330 does not retransmit the detected transmissions back onto F2 302. Even if Rl 320 happens to select F2 as the transmit frequency, a loop will not be established between Rl 320 and R2 330.<br><br>
[0066] A further advantage of the repeater according to the various embodiments is that limited or no additional analog, digital or I/O circuitry is needed for phase detection because such phase detection is performed by the existing circuitry for the OFDM/DSSS digital modulator. The circuitry for generating the phase modulation is extremely simple.<br><br>
[0067] Accordingly, if an amount of phase variation is deliberately modulated onto the first few symbols of a repeated packet and the standard operating mode of "WLAN <br><br>
only" is enabled, the existing DSSS and OFDM detector will not recognize the packets associated with the phase modulated symbols as valid WLAN packets and will stop the repeating process.<br><br>
[0068] The biphase modulator 1832 can be modified to perform the phase modulation of the preamble so that each packet has a unique signature. This signature may be a unique phase modulating "square wave" with a unique frequency of a set of frequencies or one of a set of orthogonal codes such as Walsh codes or the like. While it is not required that the code be orthogonal, orthogonal orientation between the codes is considered to allow for a higher performance of the detection of the one out of the set of codes with more certainty. Examples of non-orthogonal code would be ones with low cross correlations such as PN codes, Gold codes, or Barker sequences. Use of such codes as the modulation sequence by the repeater onto the preamble of the repeated packet will allow for (as previously mentioned) preventing the "wireless LAN only" detection of the signal to be prevented in a similar manner to the tests discussed below.<br><br>
[0069] Further, the unique signature can be configured so that operation of a repeater receiving the modified signal is adjusted in accordance with the unique signature. For example, rather than the repeater not repeating the signal when it includes the phase modulated preamble, the repeater can be configured to take alternative actions such as transmitting the wireless signal at a frequency different from an original transmission frequency, or transmitting the wireless signal at a power level different from the original transmission power level in order to avoid oscillation. Also, the repeater could be configured to remove the unique signature from the signal. The repeater can be <br><br>
configured to perform such actions in accordance with the processor 1825 executing instructions stored in an associated memory.<br><br>
[0070] Further, the repeater can use the phase modulation in the signal to perform a qualifying detection process to determine if the received wireless signal is from another repeater or one of the wireless stations. Particularly, the phase modulation can be correlated to predetermined signal pattern stored in the memory. If the correlation is determined to be high, then the repeater can determine that the wireless signal is from another repeater and take appropriate action to prevent oscillation. Alternatively, the qualifying detection process can include demodulating one of a predetermined information sequence, a pilot channel and a pilot carrier.<br><br>
[0071] Various tests were performed on an exemplary repeater which validated the conclusions discussed above. In the tests, the search time for WLAN detection in an exemplary repeater was programmable from 4µs to 16µs. A digital signal was generated using a Vector Signal Generator (VSG) having phase modulation on the first 4µs for both an OFDM signal and a DSSS signal. As discussed below, cessation of repeating was achieved 100% of the time for a programmed search time of 4µs.<br><br>
[0072] Next, the operating mode of the exemplary repeater was changed to "WLAN only" OFF. The signal successfully transited the repeater 100% of the time and a Vector Signal Analyzer (VSA) successfully demodulated the repeated signal including the phase modulation. As a control, the signal was input with the phase modulation imposed directly from the VSG and, when output to the VSA, the signal with the direct modulation was again successfully demodulated. <br><br>
[0073] TIME DOMAIN OPERATION: Referring to FIGS. 1 A - 4B, test conditions and associated results for DSSS signals will be discussed.<br><br>
[0074] In "Test #1_DSSS," a IMbps DSSS signal was injected without any phase modulation into the exemplary repeater while WLAN Only was enabled and the output was measured. As shown in FIGs. IA - IB, the exemplary repeater fully repeated the signal and the VSA demodulator detected the Start Frame Delimiter (SFD) and Header.<br><br>
[0075] In "Test #2_DSSS," a IMbps DSSS signal with Bi-Phase Modulation added to the first 4µs of the signal was injected into the exemplary repeater while WLAN Only was enabled and the output was measured. The repeater in WLAN Only mode is set to search 4µs for an 802.1 Ig DSSS or OFDM packet. As shown in FIGs. 2A - 2B, the exemplary repeater repeated only 4µs (partial packet) and then stopped the transmission.<br><br>
[0076] In "Test #3_DSSS," a IMbps DSSS signal with Bi-Phase Modulation added to the first 4µs of the signal was injected into the exemplary repeater while WLAN Only disabled and the output was measured. As shown in FIGs. 3A - 3B, since the WLAN Only mode is disabled, the exemplary repeater repeated the entire packet since it was not searching for DSSS or OFDM preambles, and the VSA detected and demodulated the packet.<br><br>
[0077] In "Test #3_DSSS Zoom" a zoomed version of Test #3_DSSS was performed in which the phase was added across the first 4µs. As shown in FIG. 4B, the time domain signal appeared differently for the first 4us compared to after 4µs.<br><br>
[0078] Referring to FIGs. 5A - 7B, test conditions and associated results for OFDM signals will be discussed. <br><br>
[0079] In "Test #1_OFDM," a 6Mbps OFDM signal without any phase modulation was injected into the exemplary repeater with WLAN Only enabled and the output was measured. As shown in FIGs. 5A - 5B, the exemplary repeater fully repeated the signal and the VSA demodulator detected and properly demodulated the signal.<br><br>
[0080] In "Test #2_OFDM," a 6Mbps OFDM signal with Bi-Phase Modulation added to the first 4us of the signal was injected into the exemplary repeater with WLAN Only enabled and the output was measured. Exemplary repeater WLAN Only was set to search 4µs for an 802.1 Ig DSSS or OFDM. As shown in FIGs. 6A - 6B, the exemplary repeater repeated only 4µs (partial packet) and then stopped the transmission.<br><br>
[0081] In "Test #3_OFDM," a 6Mbps OFDM signal with Bi-Phase Modulation added to the first 4µs of the signal was injected into the exemplary repeater with WLAN Only disabled and the output was measured. As shown in FIGs. 7A - 7B, since WLAN Only is disabled the exemplary repeater repeated the entire packet since it was not searching for DSSS or OFDM preambles, and the VSA detected and demodulated the packet.<br><br>
[0082] Frequency Domain Operation: Referring to FIGS. 8A - 15B, spectral implications of adding the phase modulation to the signal for OFDM and DSSS and the appearance of the spectrum after being transmitted through the IF SAWs will be discussed. The test was performed at 594MHz in order to determine if the signal could pass or be very close to the mask defined by the 802.11 standard.<br><br>
[0083] Referring to FIGs. 8A - 1 IB, test conditions and associated results for OFDM signals will be discussed. <br><br>
[0084] In "Test #1_OFDM" a 6Mbps OFDM signal was injected into the spectrum analyzer without any phase modulation. As shown in FIG. 8B, the signal generated passed the 802.1 Ig spectral masks.<br><br>
[0085] In "Test #2_OFDM" a 6Mbps OFDM signal was injected into the spectrum analyzer with phase modulation added to the first 4µs of the waveform. As shown in FIG. 9B, the signal generated did not pass the 802.1 Ig spectral masks due to the phase modulation.<br><br>
[0086] In "Test #3_OFDM" a 6Mbps OFDM signal was injected into the 594MHz SAW filter and then into the spectrum analyzer with phase modulation added to the first 4µs of the waveform. As shown in FIG. 1OB, although the signal was very close due to the phase modulation, it passed the 802.1 Ig spectral masks. It should be noted that when the bi-phase modulator is implemented externally, the signal will only go through the low loss SAW filter because the bi-phase modulator would have to be added after the amplifier so that the phase modulation could also be added to the internal modulator.<br><br>
[0087] In "Test #4_OFDM" a 6Mbps OFDM signal was injected into 594MHz low loss and high rejection SAWs and then into the spectrum analyzer with phase modulation added to the first 4µs of the waveform. As shown in FIG. 1 IB, although the signal was very close due to the phase modulation, the signal passed the 802.1 Ig spectral masks. It should be noted that when the bi-phase modulator is implemented internally to the repeater, the signal would go through both the low loss and high rejection SAWs because the bi-phase modulation would be added to the active inter-stage mixer.<br><br>
[0088] Referring to FIGs. 12A - 15B, test conditions and associated results for DSSS signals will be discussed. In "Test #1_DSSS," a IMbps DSSS signal was injected into <br><br>
the spectrum analyzer without any phase modulation. As shown in FIG. 12B, the signal generated passed the 802.1 Ib spectral masks.<br><br>
[0089] In "Test #2_DSSS," a IMbps DSSS signal was injected into the spectrum analyzer with phase modulation added to the first 4µs of the waveform. As shown in FIG. 13B, the signal no longer passed or was close to failing the 802.1 Ib spectral masks due to the phase modulation.<br><br>
[0090] In "Test #3_DSSS," a IMbps DSSS signal was injected into the 594MHz low loss SAW and then into the spectrum analyzer with phase modulation added to the first 4us of the waveform. As shown in FIG. 14B, although the signal was very close due to the phase modulation, the signal passed the 802.1 Ib spectral masks.<br><br>
[0091] In "Test #4_DSSS," a IMbps DSSS signal was injected into the 594MHz low loss and high rejection SAWs and then into the spectrum analyzer with phase modulation added to the first 4µs of the waveform. As shown in FIG. 15B, although the signal was very close due to the phase modulation, it passed the 802.1 Ib spectral masks. It should be noted that when the phase modulation is performed internally the signal would go through both the low loss and high rejection SAWs because the bi-phase modulation would be added to the active inter-stage mixer.<br><br>
[0092] Therefore, a repeater including the bi-phase modulation device 1832 can fully repeat a signal and not repeat a signal if a predetermined portion of the signal includes phase modulation and is in a WLAN only mode. Further, the modulated signal generated can pass through the 802.11 spectral masks when the modulated signal passes through one or more SAW filters. Here, the bi-phase modulator 1832 constitutes a signal modification device. <br><br>
[0093] Referring to FIG. 21, a repeater according to a second embodiment can include a notch processor 2100 configured to insert a notch pattern on a wireless signal to be repeated and detect if a notch pattern is present on a received wireless signal. The notch processor 2100 can be included in the repeater 1800 shown in FIGs. 18A - 18B as an additional signal modification device and detection device or in place of the bi-phase modulator 1832. As shown in FIG. 22, the notch pattern is generally one or more notches starting at a specific time TSTART and separated by a gap duration TQURATION- The start time, gap duration, and notch duration are programmable for both insertion and detection. The detection notch pattern is specified by setting the coefficients of the received notch matched filter. Further, the notch patterns can be different for transmission and reception.<br><br>
[0094] Returning to FIG. 21, the notch processor 2100 includes a notch insertion portion 2102 for sending a signal representative of the notch pattern (TX NOTCH) to the sequencer 2104, a notch detection portion 2106 for sending signals representative of an indication of a detected notch (RX NOTCH D ET) and the particular channel on which the notch was detected (RX NOTCH CHAN) to the sequencer 2104, a comparator portion 2108 that receives input signals (CMP OUT A, CMP OUT B) from the comparators via an internal RF interface 2110, and clock and reset signals, and control registers 2112 for sending signal representative of a notch insertion start time TX_NOTCH_START, notch insertion gap control TX NOTCH GAP, and duration TX NOTCH DUR to the notch insertion portion 2102. The comparator portion 2108 receives signals representative of the RSSI voltages for the two channels and a clock signal from an RSSI analog to digital converter (ADC) interface 2113, and outputs <br><br>
signals (RX_HYST_A, RX HYST B, and RX ADC SEL) to an optional debugging header portion 2114 for facilitating parameter adjustment.<br><br>
[0095] The notch processor 2100 further includes control and status registers 2116 for outputting various signals representative of: matched filter peak windows (RX_NOTCH_MFPW1, RX_NOTCH_MFPW2); notch detection hysteresis control (RX NOTCH HYST); notch detection parameter control (RX NOTCH P ARl, RX_NOTCH_PAR2, RX NOTCH PAR3); and notch detection matched filter coefficient control (RX NOTCH MFCO - MFC 19) to the notch detection section 2106. The notch detection section 2106 also outputs a signal representative of notch detection status (RX NOTCH STATUS) to the control and status registers 2116.<br><br>
[0096] Returning to FIG. 22, during operation, the notch processor 2100 can insert one or two short notches in the signal to be repeated after the rising edge of CMP_OUT_A or CMP_OUT_B. The sequencer 2104 applies the notch to the repeated signal whenever TX_NOTCH is 1. Exemplary notch processor operations for detecting a notch in a signal will be discussed with reference to the flow diagram shown in FIG. 23.<br><br>
[0097] At 2305, programmable hysteresis is performed to generate the hysteresis- filtered comparator outputs HYST_A, HYST_B, and the ADC channel selection signal ADC_SEL based upon the analog comparator outputs CMP OUT A, CMP_OUT_B. The signal RXND HYST CR is a signal from a control register indicative of the hysteresis span for CMP_OUT_A, CMP_OUT_B.<br><br>
[0098] At 2310, RSSI channel selection is performed based upon signals HYST_A, HYST_B, and a signal ADC SEL representative of the selective channel is generated. At 2315, HYST_A, HYST_B, and ADC_SEL are used to control the signals from the <br><br>
timer MFPW-TMR for controlling the detection window timing. The timer control is performed based upon the number of clock cycles elapsed since the packet's start. MFPWJTMR continues counting during temporary signal dropouts shorter than RXND_DROPOUT_CR clock cycles. Such dropouts frequently occur during the notch pattern at low received signal strengths.<br><br>
[0099] At 2320, ADC_SEL is used to convert the two-channel interleaved RSSI output ADC-OUT into a single-channel de-multiplexed signal ADC DAT A. At 2325, ADCJDATA is processed through a non-linear "maximum of 3" operation to generate ADCJvIAX. RXND_MAX_DISABLE_CR is for disabling the use of the 3-sample maximum.<br><br>
[00100] At 2330, ADC_MAX is processed through a linear first-order programmable lowpass filter, which yields a slowly-varying value RSSI A VG that closely tracks the received signal envelope peak excursions. At 2335, a slightly delayed copy of ADC DATA, referred to as RSSI_VAL is subtracted from RSSI A VG to yield the (signed) difference signal DIFF, which exhibits a strong positive excursion when a notch is encountered.<br><br>
[00101] At 2340, DIFF is the input to a 20-tap programmable matched filter, whose unsigned output MF SUM is clipped to the range 0 to 255. Signal RXNDJvIFC[O- 19]_ENA is representative of a match filter tap status, RXND_MFC[0-19]_SIGN is representative of a matched filter tap coefficient sign, and signal RXND MFC[O- 19]_SHIFT is representative of a matched filter tap coefficient magnitude. <br><br>
[00102] At 2345, RSSI_AVG is used to compute a variable matched filter threshold MF_THRESH based on the values of parameter control registers RXND_MFT_CONST_CR, RXND_MFT_SLOPE_CR, and RXND_MFT_MAX_CR.<br><br>
[00103] At 2350, the notch detection section sets RX_NOTCH_DET to 1 and sets RX_NOTCH_CHAN equal to ADC SEL, whenever MF_SUM equals or exceeds MF THRESH during a narrow time window specified by control registers RXND_NOM_MFPW_CR and RXND_HWIN_MFPW_CR. The signals RX NOTCH DET and RX NOTCH CHAN are sent to the sequencer 2104.<br><br>
[00104] Thus, a repeater including the notch processor 2100 according to the second embodiment can add a notch pattern to a repeated signal and detect a notch pattern in a received signal to mitigate the oscillation problem discussed above. Here, the notch processor 2100 constitutes a signal modification device.<br><br>
[00105] According to a third embodiment, a repeater such as the repeater 1800 shown in FIGs. 18A - 18B executes a power adjustment routine to stop or prevent oscillation with one or more other repeaters. The routine can begin when the repeater 1800 enters a discovery mode upon determining that another repeater within the wireless network is operating in the same frequency channel as disclosed in, for example, U.S. Patent Publication No. 2006-0041680. The repeater 1800 can be configured to execute the routine by the processor 1825 executing instructions stored in the memory 1827.<br><br>
[00106] Referring to the flow diagram of FIG. 24, the power adjustment routine will be discussed more fully. At 2405, the repeater transmits a predetermined number of XOS PROBE REQUEST packets, and at 2410 measures the XOS PROBE RESPONSE RSSI. The packets can be generated by, for example, the <br><br>
digital demodulator 1824 under the control of the processor 1825. The XOS_PROBE_REQUEST packet contains the power at which the repeater is transmitting. The difference between the transmit power and measured RSSI is the oneway path loss. At 2415, the repeater determines if this path loss is less than a predetermined value such as, for example, 8OdB. If the path loss is less than 80 dB (YES at 2415), then at 2420 the repeater will mark this channel and all channels within a 5 channel separation as unavailable for use, and the routine ends.<br><br>
[00107] If the path loss is less than 80 dB (NO at 2415), then at 2425 the repeater transmits a number of XOS packets of a maximum length (64 bytes). At 2430, the RSSI from each successfully received packet is measured and averaged across all packets. A packet which has not been successfully received will be considered to have an RSSI of - 8OdBm. At 2435, the repeater determines if the average RSSI is less than a predetermined dBm. If the average RSSI is less than the predetermined dBm (YES at 2435), then the routine ends. That is, the discovering repeater will assume that the current transmit power is acceptable and begin normal operation.<br><br>
[00108] If the average RSSI is not less than the predetermined dBm (NO at 2435), then at 2440 the repeater adjusts the transmission power down by 1 dB and at 2445 retransmits the number of XOS packets. At 2450, the repeater determines if the average RSSI is less than the predetermined dBm. If the average RSSI is less than the predetermined dBm (YES at 2450), then the repeater begins normal operation.<br><br>
[00109] If the average RSSI is not less than the predetermined dBm (NO at 2450), then at 2455 the repeater requests that the other repeater(s) on the same channel reduce the transmit power by 1 dB. At 2460 the repeater transmits the number of XOS packets. <br><br>
At 2465, the RSSI from each successfully received packet is measured and averaged across all packets. At 2470, the repeater determines if the average RSSI is less than the predetermined dBm. If the average RSSI is less than the predetermined dBm (YES at 2470), then the repeater begins normal operation.<br><br>
[00110] If the average RSSI is still not less than the predetermined dBm (NO at 2470), then the repeater once again request that the other repeater(s) on its same channel reduce the transmit power by another 1 dB. This will continue with each repeater's power being dropped by 1 dBm, in turn, until the XOS packet test passes. However, if the non- discovering repeater would have to reduce it's transmit power to less than a predetermined amount such as, for example, 9 dB, the discovering repeater will request that the other repeater return to its original transmit power and the discovering repeater can choose a different channel to repeat onto. The current channel and all channels within a 5 channel separation will be marked as unavailable.<br><br>
[00111 ] While the repeater is operating on the same channels as another repeater, the repeater which was enabled last will enable a monitor that checks for oscillations to occur. When an oscillation is detected, the repeater will perform the same power routine discussed above (2405 - 2420).<br><br>
[00112] In addition, for every predetermined time period (e.g., 20 seconds) the monitoring repeater will attempt to increase it's transmit power by IdB until it has reached it's normal maximum transmit power. Each time the power on either repeater is incremented, an XOS test (2405 - 2420) will be performed to see if the increase is warranted. It will ratchet each side up in the same manner as the powers were dropped. Once a repeater has been requested to change the transmit power by another repeater, it <br><br>
can monitor the channel for a XOS_OSCMIT_HEARTBEAT messages from the controlling repeater. If a predetermined time period such as, for example, 20 seconds passes without receiving a heartbeat message from the controlling repeater, the slave unit will assume that the controlling repeater is no longer operating and will revert the power to the normal maximum transmit power for channel spacing configuration.<br><br>
[00113] The above routine can also be applied when more than one other repeater is repeating to the same channels. However, in such as case a monitoring repeater may choose not to increase the power if it has determined within the certain time period (e.g., 10 seconds) that an oscillation would occur by doing so.<br><br>
[00114] Thus, the repeater 1800 according to the third embodiment can execute the power adjustment routine to mitigate oscillation with one or more other receivers on a same channel within a wireless network.<br><br>
[00115] This disclosure is intended to explain how to fashion and use various embodiments in accordance with the invention rather than to limit the true, intended, and fair scope and spirit thereof. The foregoing description is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise form disclosed. Modifications or variations are possible in light of the above teachings. For example, the repeater may be modified to identify packets previously repeated, and perform an action in response. The action may be to terminate transmission for oscillation mitigation, or to allow repeating depending on the specifics of the detection.<br><br>
[00116] Further, a repeater can incorporate any number of the three embodiments discussed above. That is, the repeater is not limited to only one of the above-discussed embodiments. Further, the circuits discussed above are only exemplary manner for <br><br>
implementing the above described signal modification device. That is, the bi-phase modulation device 1832 and the notch processor 2100 can be implemented in a different manner, as long as a predetermined portion of the signal is modified so that a repeater receiving the modified signal takes an action different from its normal repeating action.<br><br>
