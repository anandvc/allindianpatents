FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved stable pharmaceutical composition containing substituted benzimidazoles useful in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers and a process for its preparation. The present invention particularly relates to an improved pharmaceutical composition in the form of hard gelatin capsules containing substituted benzimidazoles such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention guarantees the integrity of the composition until it reaches the proximal part of the small intestine, where the composition will be disaggregated to facilitate the absorption of the substituted benzimidazole compound contained therein. This invention also involves a process of preparing the above mentioned pharmaceutical composition<br>
The present invention provides a stable pharmaceutical composition containing substituted benzimidazoles such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole, useful for treating gastro intestinal ulcers. The pharmaceutical composition of the present invention is in the form of hard gelatin capsules suitable for oral administration. The composition of the present invention would dissolve in the intestine to facilitate absorption in the neutral / alkali environment.<br>
PRIOR ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
Benzimidazolic compounds such as omeprazole (5-methoxy-2(((4-methoxy-3, 5-di met hyl -2-pyridinyl)-methyl-sulfinyl)lH-benzimidazole), lansoprazole (2-((3-methyl-4-(2,2,2-trifluoroetoxy)-2-piridyl)methyl(sulfinyl IH-benzimidazole) (U.S. Patent No. 4,628,098), pantoprazole (U.S. Pat. No. 4,758,579)), and rabeprazole, are anti-ulcerous substances known for decreasing gastric acid secretion (Gibe L., et al., Gastroenterol., 83:193-198 (1982); Saton H. et al., Jpn. J. Pharmacol. 40 (suppl.), 226 (1986); Saton H, et al., J.Pharmacol. Exp. Ther, 248 (2), 806-815 (1989), These compounds are used in the therapeutics of diseases related to gastric acidity in mammals<br><br>
and especially in humans, including gastric and duodenal ulcers, reflux oesophagitis, gastritis and duodenitis.<br>
It is also known that these substituted benzimidazoles possess a very low level of solubility in water. They solubilize easily in alkaline solutions. They degrade quickly in acidic and neutral media (Pilbrand and Cederberg, Scand. J. Gastroenterol, 20 (Suppl. 108), p. 113-120 (1985)) and they are stabilized in the presence of alkaline reacting compounds.<br>
The maximum stability of omeprazole solution is reached at pH 11 [Drug. Dev. Ind. Pharm., 21(8), 965 (1995)]. Degradation occurs very quickly below a pH of 7.0. On the other hand, it is necessary that the formulations dissolve quickly in the intestine, where the benzimidazolic compounds should be absorbed, i.e. when the pH becomes higher than 6.8. There are various prior art showing benzimidazoles such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, pantoprazole and rabeprazole with the above activity.<br>
US Pat No. 2540979 describes an enteric-coated oral dosage form of Omeprazole, where the enteric coating is combined with a second and or first coating of a water insoluble wax layer. This method of preparation may prove to be inadequate for omeprazole due to the water insoluble wax layer preventing the release and dissolution of the Omeprazole .<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,786,505 proposes the mixture of a mass of cellulose derivatives and disaggregants, with an appropriate amount of omeprazole and alkaline agents or alkaline salts of the drug, in order to obtain, by extrusion, a core which is spheronized and coated with gastroresistant agents dissolved in alcoholic solutions also containing considerable percentages of acetone. However, the pellets obtained may be extremely irregular in shape and dimensions, and this can have repercussions on a relative dispersion of the average weight of the capsules and of the respective dosage.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,385,739 and FR-A-2 692 146 describe pharmaceutical gastric protected dosage forms containing omeprazole wherein the active substance is diluted with<br><br>
mannitol and applied to an inert core, followed by an insulating layer and gastric protected coating. The process requires the use of organic solvent throughout the three stages, with its' continuous exposure to ethanol may in the long run impact the health of operating personnel.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,399,700 concerns with the stabilization of benzimidazolic derivative compounds as cyclodextrin inclusion complexes. As Cyclodextrins are quite expensive, the product may loose the cost advantage.<br>
WO 98/50019 relates to oral dosage forms containing omeprazole or lansoprazole, inside hard gelatine capsules, which are subsequently coated with gastroresistant or enteric polymers. During the coating with the polymers, the integrity of the gelatine capsules may suffer due to the action of the solvents.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,026,560 relates to spherical pellets consisting of a core coated with a binding agent which is coated with a mixture of powders containing lansoprazole, HPMC of low viscosity and magnesium or calcium carbonates as alkaline agents. The manufacturing process used was "powder coating", for drug layering which may lead to wastage of drug and also may not yield uniform pellets.<br>
The US Patent 6489346, titled Substituted benzimidazole dosage forms and method of using same, discloses solid pharmaceutical composition in a dosage form that is not enteric-coated, the dosage form includes a suspension tablet, a chewable tablet, an effervescent powder, or an effervescent tablet. Also provided is a method for treating an acid-related gastrointestinal disorder in a subject in need thereof by administering to the subject a solid pharmaceutical composition. Due to the absence of enteric coating, the stability of the drug may not be optimum.<br>
The US Patent 6248355, describes a composition of omeprazole without the use of alkaline- reacting compounds and in which the active ingredient is granulated together and compressed together along with inert  ingredients  followed by  a coating of<br><br>
intermediate coat containing one or several inert water soluble layer or layers which rapidly disintegrate in aqueous medium and contains non-acid inert pharma excipients. This layer comprises at least one polymer conventionally used in application where a film is provided by coating with such materials as sugars, polyethyleneglycol, polyvinylalcohol, hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose, an intermediate coat, and an enteric coating containing entero- soluble gastro resistants made of latex suspension of polymers such as cellulose acetate phthalate, methacrylic acid, methacrylic esters, methacrylic acid copolymers.<br>
This process involves multi-step processing such as preparation of core, intermediate layer and enteric coatings and may involve a number of controlling points like dry mixing of the drug with inert excipients, granulation of the mass, lubrication, compression, followed by a coating of intermediate layer and finally coating by an enteric layer, thereby making the process a multi-step process with each step subjected to the active ingredient analysis thereby not only making the process cumbersome but also increasing the cost of the product.<br>
OBJECTIVES OF THE PRESENT INVENTION.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is, therefore , to provide an improved stable pharmaceutical composition containing substituted benzimidazoles useful in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers .<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved stable pharmaceutical composition containing substituted benzimidazoles useful in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers without the necessity of using an alkali agent or alkali salt of the substituted benzimidazole for the stability of the formulation.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved stable pharmaceutical composition containing substituted benzimidazoles useful in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers by using most commonly available inert and non<br><br>
-acid / non-alkaline and safe pharmaceutical excipients to create an appropriate microenvironment for the active drug , namely the substituted benzimidazoles , since they are unstable in acidic / neutral environment and to release the active ingredient only in an alkaline environment.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved stable pharmaceutical composition useful in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers which does not release the drug in the stomach ( acidic environment) but releases the drug (substituted benzimidazoles) in the intestine (alkaline environment).<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved and stable pharmaceutical composition containing substituted benzimidazoles as hard gelatin capsules useful in the treatment of gastric and duodenal ulcers to facilitate to disaggregate quickly in the neutral to alkaline environment in the intestine with complete dissolution of the substituted benzimidazoles in the intestine.<br>
