PRIORITY OF INVENTION<br>
This application claims priority to United States Provisional Application Number 60/201,178, filed 02 May 2000; and to United States Provisional Applications Numbers 60/213,415; 60/213,410; 60/213,417; 60/213,146; 60/213,428, all filed 22 June 2000; and to United States Provisional Application Number 60/226,727, filed 18 August 2000, which applications are incorporated herein by reference in their entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention This invention is directed to novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising a cyclodextrin and a therapeutically effective amount of a glycopeptide antibiotic. This invention is also directed to methods for treating a bacterial disease in a mammal using such pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
State of the Art<br>
Glycopeptide antibiotics and lipidated derivatives thereof are well-known in the art {see Glycopeptide Antibiotics, edited by R. Nagarajan, Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York (1994)), These glycopeptide compounds are highly effective antibiotics for treating a wide variety of bacterial diseases in mammals. However, when administered to a mammal, some glycopeptide antibiotics exhibit undesirable properties, such as excessive tissue accumulation, nephrotoxicity, histamine release (Red Man Syndrome) and vascular irritation. Accordingly, a need exists for novel pharmaceutical compositions of glycopeptide antibiotics which reduce these undesired properties.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides novel pharmaceutical compositions comprising a cyclodextrin and a therapeutically effective amount of a glycopeptide antibiotic. Surprisingly, when administered to a mammal, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention exhibit one or more of the following properties (a) reduced tissue accumulation of the glycopeptide antibiotic, (b) reduced nephrotoxicity, (c) reduced histamine release (Red Man Syndrome) and (d) reduced vascular irritation, compared to a pharmaceutical composition which does not contain the cyclodextrin.<br>
By reducing the undesirable effects of the glycopeptide (e.g. nephrotoxicity), administration of the glycopeptide in combination with a cyclodextrin increases the therapeutic window for the glycopeptide, and allows a greater amount to be administered.<br>
Accordingly, in one of its composition aspects, this invention is directed to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a cyclodextrin and a therapeutically effective amount of a glycopeptide antibiotic, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. This preferred composition can be in the form of a lyophilized powder or a sterilized powder.<br>

In another preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition comprises:<br>
(a)	a therapeutically effective amount of a glycopeptide antibiotic, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;<br>
(b)	1 to 40 weight percent of a cyclodextrin; and<br>
(c)	60 to 99 weight percent of water, provided that the components of the composition total 100 weight percent.<br>
Preferably, the cyclodextrin employed in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention is hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin or sulfobutyl ether β-cyclodextrin. More preferably, the cyclodextrin is hydroxypropyl-β-<br><br>
cyclodextrin. Preferably, the cyclodextrin will comprise up to about 90 weight percent, and typically about 1 to 40 weight percent; preferably, about 5 to 35 weight percent; more preferable, about 10 to 30 weight percent, of the formulation.<br>

General Synthetic Procedures<br>
The glycopeptide antibiotics employed in this invention are commercially available or can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used imless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.<br>
Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group as well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups, and their introduction and removal, are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein.<br>
In the following reaction schemes, the glycopeptide compounds are depicted in a simplified form as a box "G" that shows the carboxy terminus labeled [C], the vancosamine amino terminus labeled [V], the "non-saccharide" amino terminus (leucine amine moiety) labeled [N], and optionally, the resorcinol moiety labeled [R] as follows:<br><br>
By way of illustration, a lipidated glycopeptide compound useful in the present invention can be prepared by reductive alkylated as shown in the following reaction:<br><br><br>
where A represents R^aminus one carbon atom and Ra, Rb, Y, Z and x are as defined herein. This reaction is typically conducted by first contacting one equivalent of the glycopeptide, i.e., vancomycin, with an excess, preferably from 1.1 to 1.3 eqmvalents, of the desired aldehyde in the presence of an excess, preferably about 2.0 equivalents, of a tertiary amine, such as diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and the like. This reaction is typically conducted in an inert diluent, such as DMF or acetonitrile/water, at ambient temperature for about 0.25 to 2 hours until formation of the corresponding imine and/or hemiaminal is substantially complete. The resulting imine and/or hemiaminal is typically not isolated, but is reacted in situ with a metal hydride reducing agent, such as sodium cyanoborohydride and the like, to afford the corresponding amine. This reaction is preferably conducted by contacting the imine and/or hemiaminal with an excess, preferably about 3 equivalents, of trifluoroacetic acid, followed by about 1 to 1.2 equivalents of the reducing agent at ambient temperature in methanol or acetonitrile/water. The resulting alkylated product is readily purified by conventional procedures, such as precipitation and/or reverse-phase HPLC. Surprisingly, by forming the imine and/or hemiaminal in the presence of a trialkyl amine, and then acidifying with trifluoroacetic acid before contact with the reducing agent, the selectivity for the reductive alkylation reaction is greatly improved, i.e., reductive alkylation at the amino group of the saccharide (e.g., vancosamine) is favored over reductive alkylation at the N-terminus (e.g., the leucinyl group) by at least 10:1, more preferably 20:1.<br>
The reductive alkylation process is typically carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent or combination of solvents, such as, for example, a<br><br>
halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g. methylene chloride), a linear or branched ether (e.g. diethyl ether, tetrahydrofiiran), an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. benzene or toluene), an alcohol (methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, water, l,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH)-pyrimidone, tetramethyl urea, N,N-dimethylacetamide, diethylformamide (DMF), l-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, tetramethylenesulfoxide, glycerol, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, N,N-dimethylpropylene urea (DMPU) or dioxane. Preferably tlie alkylation is carried out in acetonitrile/water, or DMF/methanol.<br>
Preferably the reduction (i.e. treatment with the reducing agent) is carried out in the presence of a protic solvent, such as, for example, an alcohol (e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, or butanol), water, or the like.<br>
The reductive alkylation process of the invention can be carried out at any suitable temperature from the freezing point to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. Preferably the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of about 0 °C to about 100 °C. More preferably at a temperature in a range of about 0 °C to about 50 °C, or in a range of about 20 °C to about 30 °C.<br>
Any suitable base can be employed in the reductive alkylation process of the invention. Suitable bases include tertiary amines (e.g. diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine or triethylamine) and the like.<br>
Any suitable acid can be used to acidify the reaction mixture. Suitable acids include carboxylic acids (e.g. acetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, citric acid, formic acid, or trifluoroacetic acid), mineral acids (e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid), and the like. A preferred acid is trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Suitable reducing agents for carrying out reductive alkylation process of the invention are known in the art. Any suitable reducing agent can be employed in the methods of the invention, provided it is compatible with the functionality present in the glycopeptide. For example, suitable reducing agents include sodium cyanoborohydride, triacetoxyborohydride, pyridine/borane, sodium borohydride, and zinc borohydride. The reduction can also be carried out in the<br><br>
presence of a transition metal catalyst (e.g. palladium or platinum) in the presence of a hydrogen source (e.g. hydrogen gas or cycloheadiene). See for example,, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Fourth Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1992), 899-900.<br>
Any glycopeptide having an amino group may be employed in these reductive alkylation reactions. Such glycopeptides are well-known in the art and are either commercially available or may be isolated using conventional<br><br>
The aldehydes and ketones employed in the above reactive alkylation reactions are also well-known in the art and are either commercially available or can be prepared by conventional procedures using commercially available starting materials and conventional reagents (for example see March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Fourth Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1992), and references cited therein). Aldehydes and ketones other than those shown above may be employed in this alkylation reaction, including by way of example, aldehydes of the formula HC(O)-Rf, where Rf is as defined herein.<br>
If desired, aminoalkyl sidechain can be introduced at the resorcinol moiety of a glycopeptide, such as vancomycin, via a Mannich reaction. In this reaction, an amine of formula NHRR' (wherein one or both of R and R' is a alkyl or substituted alkyl group or a group that comprises one or more phosphono groups), and an aldehyde (CH2O), such as formalin (a source of formaldehyde), are reacted with the glycopeptide under basic conditions to give the glycopeptide derivative, as shown below (in this scheme, the resorcinol moiety is shown for clarity).<br><br><br>
When employed, the phosphono substituted compounds (e.g. the phosphono substituted amines, alcohols, or thiols) are either commercially available or can be prepared by conventional procedures using commercially available starting materials and reagents. See for example. Advanced Organic Chemistry, Jerry March, 4th ed., 1992, John Wiley and Sons, New York, page 959; and Frank R. Hartley (ed.)

General Procedure A Reductive Alkylation of Vancomycin<br>
To a mixture of vancomycin (1 eq.) and the desired aldehyde (1.3 eq.) in<br>
DMF was added DIPEA (2 eq.). The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature<br><br>
for 1-2 hours and monitored by reverse-phase HPLC. Methanol and NaCNBHs (1 eq.) were added to the solution, followed by TFA (3 eq.)- Stirring was continued for an additional hour at ambient temperature. After the reaction was complete, the methanol was removed in vacuo. The residue was precipitated in acetonitrile. Filtration gave the crude product which was then purified by reverse-phase HPLC. If desired, other glycopeptides antibiotics may be used in this procedure.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of Compound A<br>
(Formula 11 wherein R3 is -OH; R5 N-(phosphonomethyl)-<br>
aminomethyl; R15 is hydrogen, and R20  is -CH2CH2-NH-(CH2)9CH3)<br>
(Aminomethyl)phosphonic acid (3,88g, 35 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (6.1 ml, 35 mmol) were combined in water (40 ml) and stirred until homogeneous, Acetonirile (50 ml) and formaldehyde (37% solution in H2O; 0.42 ml, 05.6 mmol) were then added to the reaction mixture. After approximately 15 minutes both Nvan- decylaminoethyl vancomycin tristrifluoroacetate (10.0g, 5.1 mmol) and diisopropylethylamine (6.1 ml, 35 mmol) were added to the reaction mixture. The reaction was stirred at room temperature for approximately 18 hrs, at which time the acetonitrile was removed in vacuo, and the residue was lyophylized. The resulting solid was triturated with water (100mL), collected by filtration, dried in vacuo and purified by reverse phase preparative HPLC to give the title compound. MS calculated (MH+) 1756.6; found (MH+) 1756.6.<br><br>
Example 2 Preparation of Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
Injectable pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared as follows:<br><br>
The above ingredients were blended and the pH was adjusted to 3.5 ± 0.5 using 0.5 N HCl or 0.5 N NaOH.<br>
Example 3 Preparation of a glycopeptide that can be incorporated into a composition of the invention (Formula II wherein R3 is -OH; R5 is H; R15 is hydrogen,<br>
and R20 is 4-(4-chlorophenyl)benzyl<br>
A three liter 3-necked flask was fitted with a condenser, nitrogen inlet and overhead mechanical stirring apparatus. The flask was charged with pulverized A82846B acetate salt (20.0 g, 1.21 x 10-5 mol) and methanol (1000 mL) under a nitrogen atmosphere, 4'-chlorobiphenylcarboxaldehyde (2.88 g, 1.33 X 10-2 mol, 1.1 eq.) was added to this stirred mixture, followed by methanol (500 mL). Finally, sodium cyanoborohydride (0.84 g, 1.33 x 10-2 mol, 1.1 eq.) was added followed by methanol (500 mL). The resulting mixture was heated to reflux (about 65 °C).<br>
After 1 hour at reflux, the reaction mixture attained homogeneity. After 25 hours at reflux, the heat source was removed and the clear reaction mixture was measured with a pH meter (6.97 at 58.0°C). IN NaOH (22.8 mL) was added dropwise to adjust the pH to 9.0 (at 54.7°C). The flask was equipped with<br><br>
a distillation head and the mixture was concentrated under partial vacuum to a weight of 322.3 grains while maintaining the pot temperature between 40°-45 °C.<br>
The distillation head was replaced with an addition funnel containing 500 mL of isopropanol (IPA). The IPA was added dropwise to the room temperature solution over 1 hour. After approximately 1/3 of the IPA was added, a granular precipitate formed. The remaining IPA was added at a faster rate after precipitation had commenced. The flask was weighed and found to hold 714.4 grams of the IPA/methanol slurry.<br>
The flask was re-equipped with a still-head and distilled under partial vacuum to remove the remaining methanol. The resulting slurry (377.8 g) was allowed to chill in the freezer overnight. The cmde product was filtered through a polypropylene pad and rinsed twice with 25 mL of cold IPA. After pulling dry on the fiinnel for 5 minutes, the material was placed in the vacuum oven to dry ta 40°C. A light pink solid (22.87 g (theory = 22.43 g)) was recovered. HPLC analysis versus a standard indicated 68.0% weight percent of the title compound (4-[4-Chlorophenyl]benzyl-A82846B] in the crude solid, which translated into a corrected crude yield of 69.3%.<br>
The products of the reaction were analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC utilizmg a Zorbax SB-Cu column with ultra-violet light (UV; 230 nm) detection. A 20 minute gradient solvent system consisting of 95% aqueous buffer/5% CH3CN at time = 0 minutes to 40% aqueous buffer/60% CH3CN at time = 30 minutes was used, where the aqueous buffer was TEAP (5 ml CH3CN, 3 ml phosphoric acid in 1000 ml water).<br>

Vancomycin resistant enterococci were phenotyped as Van A or Van B based on their sensitivity to teicoplanin. Some vancomycin resistant enterococci that had been genotyped as Van A, Van<br>
B,	Van CI or Van C2 were obtained from the Mayo Clinic,<br>
Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) were measxired in a microdilution broth procedure imder NCCLS guidelines.  Routinely, the compounds were serially diluted into Mueller-Hinton broth in 96-well microtiter plates. Overnight cultures of bacterial strains were diluted based on absorbance at 600 nm so that the final concentration in each well was 5x10^cfu/mL. Plates were returned to a 35 °C incubator. The following day (or 24 hours in the case of Enterococci strains), MICs were determined by visual inspection of the plates. Strains routinely tested in the initial screen included methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus^ methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus epidermidis (MSSE), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus epidermidis (MRSE), vancomycin sensitive Enterococcus faecium (VSE Fm), vancomycin sensitive Enterococcus faecalis (VSE Fs), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium also resistant to teicoplanin (VRE Fm Van A),  vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecium sensitive to teicoplanin (VRE Fm Van B), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis also resistant to teicoplanin (VRE Fs Van A), vancomycin resistant Enterococcus faecalis sensitive to teicoplanin (VRE Fs Van B), enterococcus gallinarium of the Van A genotype (VRE Gm Van A), enterococcus gallinarium of the Van C-1<br><br>
genotype (VRE Gm Van C-1), enterococcus casseliflavus of the Van C-2 genotype (VRE Cs Van C-2), enterococcus flavescens of the Van C-2 genotype (VRE Fv Van C-2), and penicillin-sensitive Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSSP) and penicillin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (PSRP). Because of the inability of PSSP and PSRP to grow well in Mueller-Hinton broth, MICs with those strains were determined using either TSA broth supplemented with defibrinated blood or blood agar plates. Compounds which had significant activity against the strains mentioned above were then tested for MIC values in a larger panel of clinical isolates including the species listed above as well as non-speciated coagulase negative Staphylococcus both sensitive and resistant to methicillin (MS-CNS and MR-CNS). In addition; they were tested for MICs against gram negative organisms, such as Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas aeruginosa.<br>
2.	Determination of Kill Time<br>
Experiments to determine the time required to kill the bacteria were conducted as described in Lorian, "Antibiotics in Laboratory Medicine", Fourth Edition, Williams and Wilkins (1991). These experiments were conducted normally with both staphylococcus and enterococcus strains.<br>
Briefly, several colonies were selected from an agar plate and grown at 35°C under constant agitation until it achieved a turbidity of approximately 1.5 and 10 CFU/mL. The sample was then diluted to about 6x10 CFU/mL and incubated at 35°C under constant agitation was continued. At various times aliquots were removed and five ten-fold serial dilutions were performed. The pour plate method was used to determine the number of colony forming units (CFUs).<br>
In general, glycopeptide antibiotics active in the above tests in vitro tests are suitable for use in the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention.<br><br>
B.       In Vivo Determination of Antibacterial Activity<br>
1.	Acute Tolerabilitv Studies in Mice<br>
In  these studies, a pharmaceutical composition of this invention was administered either intravenously or subcutaneously and observed for 5-15 minutes. If there were no adverse effects, the dose was increased in a second group of mice. This dose incrementation continued until mortality occurred, or the dose was maximized. Generally, dosing began at 20 mg/kg and increased by 20 mg/kg each time until the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) is achieved.<br>
2.	Bioavailability Studies in Mice<br>
Mice were administered a compound of this invention either intravenously or subcutaneously at a therapeutic dose (in general, approximately 50 mg/kg). Groups of animals were placed in metabolic cages so that urine and feces could be collected for analysis. Groups of animals (n = 3) were sacrificed at various times (10 min, 1 hour and 4 hours). Blood was collected by cardiac puncture and the following organs were harvested—lung, liver, heart, brain, kidney, and spleen.  Tissues were weighed arid prepared for HPLC analysis. HPLC analysis on the tissue homogenates and fluids was used to determine the concentration of the test compound or lil present. Metabolic products were also determined at this juncture,<br>
3.	Mouse Septicemia Model<br>
In this model, an appropriately virulent strain of bacteria (most commonly S. aureus, or E. Faecalis or E. Faecium) was administered to mice (N=5 to 10 mice per group) intraperitoneally. The bacteria was combined with hog gastric mucin to enhance virulence. The dose of bacteria (normally 10-10) was that sufficient to induce mortality in all of the mice over a three day period. One hour after the bacteria was administered, a pharmaceutical composition of this invention was administered in a single dose either IV or subcutaneously. Each dose was administered to groups of 5 to 10 mice, at doses that typically ranged from a maximum of about 20 mg/kg to a minimum of less than 1 mg/kg. A positive control (normally vancomycin with vancomycin sensitive strains) was<br><br>
administered in each experiment. The dose at which approximately 50% of the animals are saved was calculated from the results.<br>
4.	Neutropenic Thigh Model<br>
In this model, antibacterial activity of a pharmaceutical composition of this invention was evaluated against an appropriately virulent strain of bacteria (most commonly S. aureus, or E. Faecalis or E. Faecium, sensitive or resistant to vancomycin). Mice were initially rendered neutropenic by administration of cyclophosphamide at 200 mg/kg on day 0 and day 2. On day 4 they were infected in the left anterior thigh by an IM injection of a single dose of bacteria. The mice were then administered the test compound one hour after the bacteria and at various later times (normally 1, 2.5,4 and 24 hours) the mice were sacrificed (3 per time point) and the thigh excised, homogenized and the number of CPUs (colony forming units) were determined by plating. Blood was also plated to determine the CPUs in the blood.<br>
5.	Pharmacokinetic Studies<br>
The rate at which a compound of this invention is removed from the blood can be determined in either rats or mice. In rats, the test animals were cannulated in the jugular vein. The test compound was administered via tail vein injection, and at various time points (normally 5,15,30,60 minutes and 2,4,6 and 24 hours) blood was withdrawn from the cannula. In mice, the test compound was also administered via tail vein injection, and at various time points. Blood was normally obtained by cardiac puncture. The concentration of the remaining test compound was determined by HPLC.<br>
In general, the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention were active in the above test in vivo and demonstrated a broad spectrum of activity.<br><br>
Example 5 Determination of Tissue Accumulation<br>
A.	Tissue Distribution Using Radiolabeled Compound<br>
This procedure is used to examine the tissue distribution, excretion and metabolism of a radiolabeled test compound in both male and female rats following intravenous infusion at 10 mg/kg. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 2 per sex per compound) are dosed with 3H-labeled test compound at 10 (400 μ/kg) and 12.5 rag/kg (100 μCi/kg), respectively, via intravenous infusion (-2 min). The test compound is fonnulated in 5% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin as 2.5 mg/mL solution. Urine and feces are cage collected over 24 hours period. At 24 hours after dosing, animals are sacrificed and tissues are removed. Serum, urine and tissues are analyzed for total radioactivity by oxidation followed by liquid scintillation counting. Urine and selected tissues samples are extracted and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC with radioactive flow detector for the presence of potential metabolites.<br>
B.	Tissue Accumulation Following Single Dose<br>
This procedure is used to evaluate tissue distribution of a test compound in rats following single dose administration by infusion. Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 3 per dose groups) are dosed with 50 mg/kg of a test compound. Two fomiulations are used: 30% PEG 400 and 10% sulfobutylether-β-cyclodextrin. Urine samples are cage collected over 24 hours. Blood samples are collected for serum chemistry and concentration determination. Liver and kidneys are removed for histology evaluation. One kidney and part of the liver are homogenized for concentration analysis using reverse phase HPLC with UV detection. Dmg concentrations in urine and serum samples are determined by LC-MS analysis.<br><br>
C.        Tissue Distribution Following Multiple Doses This procedure is used too evaluate the potential tissue accumulation of a test compound in rats followmg multiple dose administration by intravenous infusion. Male and female Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 4 per sex per dose group) are dosed with a test compound at 12.5,25 and  50 mg/kg per day for seven days. Animals are sacrificed at day 1 (n = 3 per sex per dose group) following the last dose administered. One animal per sex per dose group is retained as recovery animal and sacrificed at day 7 following the last dose administered. The test compoimd is formulated in 5% hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin or 1% sucrose/4.5% dextrose. Urine samples are cage collected at days 1 and 7 post-dose. Blood samples are collected for serum chemistry and concentration determination. Liver and kidneys are removed for histology evaluation. One kidney and part of the liver are homogenized for concentration analysis using reverse phase HPLC with UV detection. Drug concentrations in urine and serum samples are determined by LC-MS analysis.<br>
Nephrotoxicity, histamine release and vascular irritation can be measured using procedures well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Example 5 Determination of Tissue Accumulation and Nephrotoxicity<br>
Female Sprague-Dawley rates (three per group) were dosed with Compound A (50 mg/kg) formulated in either hydroxypropyl-β-cyclodextrin or 5% dextrose/water or vehicle. The indicated doses were administered in a volume of 10 mL/kg via a 2-minute intravenous infusion. At 24 hours, the animals were sacrificed and serum and tissue samples collected. The results are shown in Tables 1 and 2.<br><br>
TABLE 1<br>
Tissue Distribution and Urinary Recovery for Compound A in Various<br>
Formulations Following Intravenous Infusion to Female Rats at a dose of 50 mg/kg.<br>
(Values are Mean (SD))<br><br>
As shown in Table 1, urinary recoveiy of Compound A was significantly higher in formulations contain a cyclodextrin; and liver and kidney accumulation were significantly lower in such formulations.<br><br>
TABLE 2 Effects of Compound A Formulation on Serum Renal Chemistry<br><br>
The results in Table 2 show that the formations containing cyclodextrin had significantly less nephrotoxicity compared to formulations without cyclodextrin.<br>
