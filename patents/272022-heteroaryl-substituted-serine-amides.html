and their agriculturally useful salts.<br>
Moreover, the invention relates to processes and intermediates for preparing<br>
compounds of the formula (I), to compositions comprising them and to the use of these<br>
compounds or of the compositions comprising them for controlling harmful plants.<br>
Fungicidally active thienyl-substituted amino acid derivatives which carry, in the<br>
α-position, an alkyl radical which may optionally be substituted by hydroxyl or alkoxy<br>
are described, inter alia, in EP 450 355.<br>
Also known from the literature, for example from US 5,346,907, WO 96/012499 and<br>
WO 02/069905, are serine derivatives having pharmaceutical activity which, in the<br>
α-position, may, inter alia, carry an alkyl radical which may optionally be substituted by<br>
hydroxyl or alkoxy.<br>
Herbicidally active serine derivatives are known, for example, from WO 03/45878,<br>
WO 03/66576, WO 05/061464, WO 05/061443, WO 06/29829 and WO 06/29828.<br>
However, in many cases the known compounds are not entirely satisfactory, for<br>
example with respect to application rate, activity spectrum, duration of activity,<br>
compatibility with crop plants, tendency to develop resistance or economic aspects of<br>
the preparation process.<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to provide novel, in particular<br>
herbicidally active, compounds having improved properties.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by the heteroaroyl-substituted serineamides<br>
of the formula (I) and their herbicidal action.<br>
Furthermore, we have found herbicidal compositions which comprise the compounds<br>
(I) and have very good herbicidal action. Moreover, we have found processes for<br>
preparing these compositions and methods for controlling unwanted vegetation using<br>
the compounds (I).<br>
Depending on the substitution pattern, the compounds of the formula (I) comprise two<br>
or more centers of chiralty, in which case they are present as enantiomers or<br>
diastereomer mixtures. The invention provides both the pure enantiomers or<br>
diastereomers and their mixtures.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) may also be present in the form of their agriculturally<br><br>
useful salts, the nature of the salt generally being immaterial. Suitable salts are, in<br>
general, the cations or the acid addition salts of those acids whose cation and anions,<br>
respectively, have no adverse effect on the herbicidal action of the compounds (I).<br>
Suitable cations are in particular the ions of the alkali metals, preferably lithium, sodium<br>
and potassium, of the alkaline earth metals, preferably calcium and magnesium, and of<br>
the transition metals, preferably manganese, copper, zinc and iron, and also<br>
ammonium, where, if desired, one to four hydrogen atoms may be replaced by C1-C4-<br>
alkyl, hydroxy-C1-C4-alkyl, C1-C4-alkoxy-C1-C4-alkyl, hydroxy-C1-C4-alkoxy-C1-C4-alkyl,<br>
phenyl or benzyl, preferably ammonium, dimethylammonium, diisopropylammonium,<br>
tetramethylammonium,	tetrabutylammonium,	2-(2-hydroxyeth-1 -oxy)eth-1 -yl-<br>
ammonium, di-(2-hydroxyeth-1-yl)ammonium, trimethylbenzylammonium, furthermore<br>
phosphonium ions, sulfonium ions, preferably tri(C1-C4-alkyl)sulfonium, and<br>
sulfoxonium ions, preferably tri(C1-C4-alkyl)sulfoxonium.<br>
Anions of useful acid addition salts are primarily chloride, bromide, fluoride,<br>
hydrogensulfate, sulfate, dihydrogenphosphate, hydrogenphosphate, nitrate,<br>
bicarbonate, carbonate, hexafluorosilicate, hexafluorophosphate, benzoate, and the<br>
anions of C1-C4-alkanoic acids, preferably formate, acetate, propionate and butyrate.<br>
"Fused" in the sense of the invention means that two rings share at least one atom.<br>
Thus, in addition to condensed systems, the definition also includes systems which are<br>
spirocyclically linked.<br>

routes, for example by the following processes:<br>
Process A<br>
Serine derivatives of the formula (V) are initially reacted with heteroaryl<br>
acids/heteroaryl acid derivatives of the formula (IV) to give the corresponding<br>
heteroaroyl derivatives of the formula (III) which are then reacted with amines of the<br>

usually at temperatures of from 0°C to the boiling point of the reaction mixture,<br>
preferably from 0°C to 110°C, particularly preferably at room temperature, in an inert<br>

emulsions, pastes or oil dispersions, the substrates, either as such or dissolved in an<br>
oil or solvent, can be homogenized in water by means of a wetting agent, tackifier,<br>
dispersant or emulsifier. Alternatively, it is also possible to prepare concentrates<br>
comprising active substance, wetting agent, tackifier, dispersant or emulsifier and, if<br>
desired, solvent or oil, which are suitable for dilution with water.<br>
The concentrations of the compounds of the formula (I) in the ready-to-use<br>
preparations can be varied within wide ranges. In general, the formulations comprise<br>
approximately from 0.001 to 98% by weight, preferably 0.01 to 95% by weight of at<br>
least one active ingredient. The active ingredients are employed in a purity of from 90%<br>
to 100%, preferably 95% to 100% (according to NMR spectrum).<br>
The following are examples of formulations:<br>
1. Products for dilution with water<br>
A Water-soluble concentrates<br>
10 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in 90 parts by weight of<br>
water or in a water-soluble solvent. As an alternative, wetting agents or other auxiliaries<br>
are added. The active compound dissolves upon dilution with water. In this way, a<br>
formulation having a content of 10% by weight of active compound is obtained.<br>
B Dispersible concentrates<br>
20 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in 70 parts by weight of<br>
cyclohexanone with addition of 10 parts by weight of a dispersant, for example<br>
polyvinylpyrrolidone. Dilution with water gives a dispersion. The active compound<br>
content is 20% by weight.<br>
C Emulsifiable concentrates<br>
15 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in 75 parts by weight of an<br>
organic solvent with addition of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil<br>
B06/1029PC<br><br>
ethoxylate (in each case 5 parts by weight). Dilution with water gives an emulsion. The<br>
formulation has an active compound content of 15% by weight.<br>

25 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in 35 parts by weight of an<br>
organic solvent with addition of calcium dodecylbenzenesulfonate and castor oil<br>
ethoxylate (in each case 5 parts by weight). This mixture is introduced into 30 parts by<br>
weight of water by means of an emulsifying machine (e.g. Ultraturrax) and made into a<br>
homogeneous emulsion. Dilution with water gives an emulsion. The formulation has an<br>
active compound content of 25% by weight.<br>

compound content in the formulation is 20% by weight.<br>
F Water-dispersible granules and water-soluble granules<br>
50 parts by weight of the active compounds are ground finely with addition of 50 parts<br>
by weight of dispersants and wetting agents and prepared as water-dispersible or<br>
water-soluble granules by means of technical appliances (for example extrusion, spray<br>
tower, fluidized bed). Dilution with water gives a stable dispersion or solution of the<br>
active compound. The formulation has an active compound content of 50% by weight.<br>
G Water-dispersible powders and water-soluble powders<br>

In a ball mill, 20 parts by weight of the active compounds, 10 parts by weight of<br>
dispersant, 1 part by weight of gelling agent and 70 parts by weight of water or an<br>
organic solvent are ground to give a fine suspension. On dilution with water, a stable<br>
suspension having an active compound content of 20% by weight is obtained.<br>
2. Products to be applied undiluted<br>
I Dustable powders<br>
5 parts by weight of the active compounds are ground finely and mixed intimately with<br>
95 parts by weight of finely divided kaolin. This gives a dustable product having an<br>
active compound content of 5% by weight.<br><br>
J Granules (GR, FG, GG, MG)<br>
0.5 part by weight of the active compounds is ground finely and associated with 99.5<br>
parts by weight of carriers. Current methods are extrusion, spray-drying or the fluidized<br>
bed. This gives granules to be applied undiluted having an active compound content of<br>
0.5% by weight.<br>
K ULV solutions (UL)<br>
10 parts by weight of the active compounds are dissolved in 90 parts by weight of an<br>
organic solvent, for example xylene. This gives a product to be applied undiluted<br>
having an active compound content of 10% by weight.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) or the herbicidal compositions can be applied pre- or<br>
post-emergence. If the active ingredients are less well tolerated by certain crop plants,<br>
application techniques may be used in which the herbicidal compositions are sprayed,<br>
with the aid of the spraying equipment, in such a way that as far as possible they do<br>
not come into contact with the leaves of the sensitive crop plants, while the active<br>
ingredients reach the leaves of undesirable plants growing underneath, or the bare soil<br>
surface (post-directed, lay-by).<br>
In a further embodiment, the compounds of the formula (I) or the herbicidal<br>
compositions can be applied by treating seed.<br>
The treatment of seed comprises essentially all procedures familiar to the person<br>
skilled in the art (seed dressing, seed coating, seed dusting, seed soaking, seed film<br>
coating, seed multilayer coating, seed encrusting, seed dripping and seed pelleting)<br>
based on the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention or the<br>
compositions prepared therefrom. Here, the herbicidal compositions can be applied<br>
diluted or undiluted.<br>
The term seed comprises seed of all types, such as, for example, corns, seeds, fruits,<br>
tubers, seedlings and similar forms. Here, preferably, the term seed describes corns<br>
and seeds.<br>
The seed used can be seed of the useful plants mentioned above, but also the seed of<br>
transgenic plants or plants obtained by customary breeding methods.<br>
The rates of application of the compound of the formula (I) are from 0.001 to 3.0,<br>
preferably 0.01 to 1.0, kg/ha of active substance (a.s.), depending on the control target,<br>
the season, the target plants and the growth stage.<br><br>
For seed treatment, amounts of from 0.001 to 10 kg per 100 kg of seed are usually<br>
employed.<br>
To widen the spectrum of action and to achieve synergistic effects, the 3-(hetero-<br>
cyclyl)-substituted benzoylpyrazole compounds of the formula (I) may be mixed with a<br>
large number of representatives of other herbicidal or growth-regulating active<br>
ingredient groups and then applied concomitantly. Suitable components for mixtures<br>
are, for example, 1,2,4-thiadiazoles, 1,3,4-thiadiazoles, amides, aminophosphoric acid<br>
and its derivatives, aminotriazoles, anilides, (het)aryloxyalkanoic acids and their<br>
derivatives, benzoic acid and its derivatives, benzothiadiazinones, 2-(het)aroyl-1,3-<br>
cyclohexanediones, hetaryl aryl ketones, benzylisoxazolidinones, meta-CF3-phenyl<br>
derivatives, carbamates, quinolinecarboxylic acid and its derivatives,<br>
chloroacetanilides, cyclohexenone oxime ether derivatives, diazines, dichloropropionic<br>
acid and its derivatives, dihydrobenzofurans, dihydrofuran-3-ones, dinitroanilines,<br>
dinitrophenols, diphenyl ethers, dipyridyls, halocarboxylic acids and their derivatives,<br>
ureas, 3-phenyluracils, imidazoles, imidazolinones, N-phenyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-<br>
phthalimides, oxadiazoles, oxiranes, phenols, aryloxy- and hetaryloxyphenoxypropionic<br>
esters, phenylacetic acid and its derivatives, 2-phenylpropionic acid and its derivatives,<br>
pyrazoles, phenylpyrazoles, pyridazines, pyridinecarboxylic acid and its derivatives,<br>
pyrimidyl ethers, sulfonamides, sulfonylureas, triazines, triazinones, triazolinones,<br>
triazolecarboxamides and uracils and phenylpyrazolines, isoxazolines and their<br>
derivatives.<br>
It may furthermore be beneficial to apply the compounds of the formula (I) alone or in<br>
combination with other herbicides, or in the form of a mixture with other crop protection<br>
agents, together, for example, with agents for controlling pests or phytopathogenic<br>
fungi or bacteria. Also of interest is the miscibility with mineral salt solutions, which are<br>
employed for treating nutritional and trace element deficiencies. Other additives such<br>
as non-phytotoxic oils and oil concentrates may also be added.<br>
Use examples<br>
The herbicidal activity of the heteroaroyl-substituted serineamides of the formula (I)<br>
was demonstrated by the following greenhouse experiments:<br>
The culture containers used were plastic flowerpots containing loamy sand with<br>
approximately 3.0% of humus as the substrate. The seeds of the test plants were sown<br>
separately for each species.<br>
For the pre-emergence treatment, the active ingredients, which had been suspended or<br>
emulsified in water, were applied directly after sowing by means of finely distributing<br>
nozzles. The containers were irrigated gently to promote germination and growth and<br><br>
subsequently covered with transparent plastic hoods until the plants had rooted. This<br>
cover causes uniform germination of the test plants, unless this has been impaired by<br>
the active ingredients.<br>
For the post-emergence treatment, the test plants were first grown to a height of 3 to<br>
15 cm, depending on the plant habit, and only then treated with the active ingredients<br>
which had been suspended or emulsified in water. For this purpose, the test plants<br>
were either sown directly and grown in the same containers, or they were first grown<br>
separately as seedlings and transplanted into the test containers a few days prior to<br>
treatment. The rate of application for the post-emergence treatment was 1.0 kg/ha of<br>
a.s. (active substance).<br>
Depending on the species, the plants were kept at 10 - 25°C or 20 - 35°C. The test<br>
period extended over 2 to 4 weeks. During this time, the plants were tended, and their<br>
response to the individual treatments was evaluated.<br>
Evaluation was carried out using a scale from 0 to 100. 100 means no emergence of<br>
the plants, or complete destruction of at least the aerial parts, and 0 means no<br>
damage, or normal course of growth.<br>
The plants used in the greenhouse experiments belonged to the following species:<br><br>
