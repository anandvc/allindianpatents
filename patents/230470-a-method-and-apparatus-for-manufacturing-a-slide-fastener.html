				<td>METHOD OF MANUFACTURING SLIDE FASTENER AND SLIDE FASTENER MANUFACTURING APPARATUS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method and an apparatus of manufacturing a slide fastener, specifically to a method and an apparatus of successively manufacturing slide fasteners of the same length by successively cutting a long fastener chain, which is alternately arranged with fastener element rows and interval portions lacking the element rows in a longitudinal direction, at centers of the respective interval portions. The invention particularly relates to a method of successively manufacturing a slide fastener and its apparatus preferable for successively manufacturing a slide fastener from a fastener chain previously attached with a fly for jeans.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
In a related art, a slide fastener is successively manufactured by cutting a long fastener chain at each interval portion lacking a fastener element row. An example of a specific manufacturing technology is disclosed in, for example, JP-B-1-19890. According to this publication, transfer of the fastener chain transferred by transfer means is stopped when the interval portion reaches a cutting position for cutting means. The transfer means includes a pair of upper and lower<br><br>
transfer rolls and is arranged at a middle of a horizontal transfer path of the fastener chain. The cutting means includes upper and lower cooperatively moved cutting blades arranged at a discharge end of the transfer path. When transfer of the fastener chain is stopped, the upper cutting blade is moved down to cut the interval portion of the fastener chain in a crossing direction to successively cut to separate the slide fastener having a constant length from the fastener chain. The cut and separated slide fastener is dropped downward and is collected in a containing portion arranged on a lower side.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Meanwhile, according to the apparatus of manufacturing a slide fastener of this related art, as disclosed in JP-B-1-198 90, it is general that the transfer path of the fastener chain is horizontal. Further, the transfer means is often arranged on an upstream side and a downstream side of the cutting means. In the case where, as in JP-B-1-19890, a transfer path for transferring the cut slide fastener cut by the cutting means is eliminated from the horizontal transfer path, a slide fastener portion of the fastener chain transferred frontward from the cutting means to be cut subsequently is folded to bend downward at a point of passing the cutting means. In this case, when cutting, there is a high possibility that a cut end of the slide fastener portion is cut in an inclined manner.<br><br>
On the other hand, in the case where horizontal transfer paths are arranged frontward and rearward relative to the cutting means and also transfer means are arranged frontward and rearward relative to the cutting means, in cutting, tension forces are obliged to be asserted on the fastener chain. Thus, a difference in a cut length is easily produced.<br>
Further, the cutting means is fixedly installed at an installing position on the horizontal transfer path. An upper end of the fly constituting a cloth piece in a short strip shape of, for example, jeans is frequently cut obliquely. Thus, a cutting apparatus exclusively used for obliquely cutting the fastener chain of jeans is fixedly disposed so as to obliquely cross the transfer path. At this occasion, a front end portion of the slide fastener portion to be cut next time is formed with a cut end portion inclined in a direction reverse to that of the preceding slide fastener. The slide fastener cut obliquely in the reverse direction does not constitute a product and therefore, the oblique cut end portion needs to be cut off again by another cutting apparatus.<br>
The invention has been carried out in order to resolve the problem and it is an object thereof to provide a method and an apparatus of successively manufacturing a slide fastener having a cutting apparatus capable of cutting without applying unnecessary tension to a chain cut portion and without bringing about a state of loosening a fastener chain in cutting the fastener<br><br>
chain, and capable of cutting a normal fastener chain, and a fastener chain for jeans attached with a plurality of flies<br>
in a short strip shape in a requested cut shape.<br>
According to the invention, the drawback of the background<br>
art is eliminated, an element lacking interval portion of a continuous long fastener chain can be cut at any position thereof (for example, even at a vicinity of front ends of a pair of meshed elements) , and a slide fastener can be manufactured firmly, uniformly and with proper quality without damaging or expanding to open frontmost meshed elements, or damaging a lower stop piece of a front end portion thereof-<br>
The above-described object is achieved by a method of manufacturing a slide fastener by cutting a long fastener chain alternately having in a longitudinal direction thereof a pair of element rows meshing with each other and an interval portion lacking the element row at apredetermined position of the interval portion, the method including the steps of: arranging a feed portion of the fastener chain on an upstream side of a chain cutting portion; positively transferring the fastener chain successively by the feed portion to the chain cutting portion along an inclined transfer path inclined downward; operating the chain cutting portion after awaiting for stopping to transfer the fastener chain and cutting the slide faster chain in a cross direction at the predetermined position of the interval portion; and making the slide fastener cut to be separated by the chain<br><br>
cutting portion slide down by a self weight thereof along the transfer path.<br>
When a fastener chain attached with a fly/ in which short cloth pieces contiguous end portions of which are arranged at a constant interval are successively attached to the slide fastener chain over a longitudinal direction thereof is cut on the interval portion of the fastener chain, the method includes the step of pivoting the cutting portion by a predetermined angle around an axis line orthogonal to the inclined transfer path by means of pivoting the cutting portion, thereafter, skewedly crossing to cut the fastener chain at the predetermined position of the interval portionby operating the cuttingportion.<br>
Further, it is preferable that the method further includes the steps of moving forward the fastener chain by a predetermined length by operating the feed portion, thereafter, pivoting the cutting portion in a direction of orthogonally crossing the transfer path, operating the cutting section and cutting off a front end inclined portion of the fastener chain.<br>
There may be constructed a constitution in which the slide fastener sliding down by the self weight on the transfer path and falling at an end of the transfer path is temporarily placed on a slide fastener receiving portion having a downward inclination angle smaller than an inclination angle of a downward inclination of the transfer path, thereafter, made to fall to be contained in a containing portion arranged on a lower side<br><br>
of the receiving portion.<br>
Such a manufacturing method is effectively realized by a slide fastener manufacturing apparatus for manufacturing a slide fastener by cutting a long fastener chain alternately having in a longitudinal direction thereof a pair of element rows meshing with each other and an interval portion lacking the element row at a predetermined position of the interval portion, the apparatus including: a chain transfer path inclined downward for transferring the fastener chain; a chain cutting portion disposed at a middle of the transfer path; a feed portion of the fastener chain disposed on an upstream side of the chain cutting portion of the chain transfer path; and a control portion for stopping to transfer the fastener chain by the feed portion and operating the chain cutting portion.<br>
Preferably, the apparatus further includes a pivoting section for pivoting the cutting portion by a predetermined angle on the transfer path of the fastener chain around an axis line orthogonal to the transfer path, and includes a slide fastener receiving portion arranged on a lower side of a slide fastener discharge end of the transfer path and having a bottom portion having an inclination angle smaller than an inclination angle of the transfer path. It is preferable that a bottom portion of the slide fastener receiving portion is made to be able to be opened and closed by opening and closing section for opening and closing the bottom portion and the apparatus may include<br><br>
a containing portion for containing the slide fastener fell by a self weight thereof in opening the bottom portions on a lower side of the bottom portions. At this occasion, it is preferable that the containing portion includes a plurality of containing chambers partitioned along an outer peripheral portion of a rotating table. The apparatus includes a control portion for automatically operating various operating members of the lengthmeasuring section, the cuttingportion, the pivoting section, the opening and closing section, the bottom portion of the slide fastener receiving portion, means for rotating the containing portion and the like successively in accordance with a previously determined procedure.<br>
The transferring section is arranged on the upstream side of the cutting portion, the front end portion of the fastener chain is transferred by exceeding the cutting port ion by a required length and the fastener chain is stopped to transfer. At this occasion, the fastener chain is transferred smoothly along the transfer path inclined downwardly by being assisted by the self weight. In order to stop the transfer by the transferring section, the front end or the rear end of the interval portion to be cut at a successive time of the fastener chain is detected by the detecting section arranged at the middle of the transfer path, and the detecting signal is transmitted to the length measuring section. At the lengthmeasuring section, the length is started to measure by receiving the detecting signal, and<br><br>
when the value of the measured length reaches a previously set value, the transferring section is stopped to be operated and the fastener chain is stopped to be transferred.<br>
At this occasion, the interval portion constituting an object of cutting the fastener chain is disposed at the cutting position of the cutting portion. When the transferring section is stopped to operate, the cutting portion is operated to cut the interval portion in the cross direction to cut to separate the fastener chain and the slide fastener. In the cutting operation, at an interval between a position at which the fastener chain is grabbed by the transferring section of the fastener chain and a position of a front free end thereof, the self weight along the inclined transfer path is worked, the fastener chain is brought into a state in which the faster chain is not under an extreme tension and is not slacked and therefore, the fastener chain can be cut always at a constant length. Here, the slide fastener cut to be separated slides down by its own weight along the inclined transfer path inclined downward. At this occasion, a particular power for transferring the slide fastener is not needed.<br>
According to the invention, it is preferable to provide<br>
pivoting section for arbitrarily pivoting the cutting portion<br>
by a required angle on the path of transferring the fastener<br>
chain and around an axis line orthogonal to the transfer path.<br>
In a case of a general fastener chain, fastener element rows<br><br>
of simply two pieces of fastener stringers opposed to each other are brought into a meshed state to constitute the fastener chain. Although in the case of the fastener chain having the normal structure, a center of the interval portion is cut orthogonally to the fastener chain in the cross direction, for example, in a case of a fastener chain attached with the fly one end of which is skewedly cut as in, for example, a fly of jeans, a cutting apparatus exclusive for jeans for skewedly cutting is needed.<br>
When there is provided the pivoting section for arbitrarily pivoting the cutting portion by the required angle on the path of transferring the fastener chain and around the axis line orthogonal to the transfer path, in cutting the normal fastener chain, the cutting portion can be set to cut the fastener chain by orthogonally crossing the transfer path, or when the fastener chain attached with the fly which is attached with the fly of jeans is skewedly cut, after pivoting the cutting portion to set a cutting blade thereof in a direction of skewedly crossing the transfer path, the fastener chain can skewedly be cut.<br>
Further, according to the invention, it is preferable to receive a slide fastener sliding down on the inclined transfer path by the self weight in this way temporarily by a slide fastener receiving portion. By receiving the slide fastener by a bottom portion of the slide fastener receivingportion, amode of falling of the slide fastener is not deteriorated. Particularly, by<br><br>
making an inclination angle of the bottom portion of the receiving portion smaller than the inclination angle of the inclined transfer path, the slide fastener can be received in a state of further maintaining the falling mode. Further, by making the bottom portion of the slide fastener receiving portion openable and closable and opening the bottom portion, the slide fastener received by the bottom portion is contained to the containing portion on the lower side by the self weight. At this occasion, the inclination angle of the bottom portion is set to the inclination angle proximate to horizontal and therefore, even when the slide fastener is made to fall to the containing portion by opening the receiving portion, a directionality of the slide fastener remains unchanged when contained in the containing portion and the slide fastener is contained in a<br>
regulated state.<br>
When the containing portion includes a plurality of<br>
containing chambers partitioned along an outer peripheral edge portion of a rotating table, the rotating table is automatically rotated when a number of sheets of the slide fasteners contained in the containing chamber becomes a predetermined number of sheets and the slide fastener is contained in the containing chamber at a next position.<br>

Proximate side end portions of the left and right operating rods 141c, 142c are projected with shaft portions 141d, 142d in a front and rear direction of the operating rods 141c, 142c,<br>
The shaft portions 141d, 142d are in parallel with the support shafts 132 projected from the gate shape frame 131.<br>
Meanwhile, a center portion of an upper end beam portion 131e of the gate shape frame 131 is projected with a shelf portion 131f for mounting and fixing a pivoting member operating cylinder 142 for pivoting the left and right pivoting members 141, 142 to direct to a front side. A piston rod 143a of the pivoting member operating cylinder 143 is projected downward by passing a rod inserting hole formed in the shelf portion 131f, and a roe end thereof is fixed to a connecting member 144 that pivotably supports the pivoting members 141, 142. As shown in Fig.5, the connecting member 144 has an inversely recessed shape member communicated in a left and right direction, and front end portions of the respective operating rods 141c, 142c of the pair of left and right pivoting members 141, 142 are inserted to be fitted thereto from left and right sides. Further, the connecting member 144 is formed with a pair of left and right shaft portions supporting long holes 144a for supporting the respective shaft portions 141d, 142d provided at the front ends of the left and right operating rods 141c, 142c and projected in the front and rear direction pivotably and slidably in a horizontal direction to penetrate in the front and rear direction.<br><br>
When the left and right pivoting members 141, 142 are brought into a closed state, fastener receiving faces of the bottom portions 141a, 142a are inclined by an inclination angle (3 proximate to be horizontal more than the inclination angle β of the chain cutting portion 110, the chain transfer portion 120 and the fastener slide down portion 130. This is because when the inclination angle β is constituted by an inclination angle the same as the inclination angle a of the chain cutting portion 110, the chain transfer portion 120 and the fastener slide down portion 130, in a case in which the left and right pivoting members 141, 142 are opened and the slide fastener SF falls freely, an attitude of falling down to the fastener containing portion 150 on the lower side is not determined. When the fastener receiving faces of the bottom portions 141a, 142a of the pivoting members 141, 142 are inclined by constituting the inclination angle βas described above, the slide fastener SF falls in the same attitude and is regulated to a predetermined position of the fastener containing portion 150 to be contained.<br>
According to the invention, the slide fastener SF temporarily received by the bottom portions 141a, 142a of the left and right pivoting members 141, 142 freely falls by a self weight thereof by opening the bottom portions 141a, 142a. In order to contain the falling slide fastener SF, the slide fastener containing portion 150 is arranged right below the left and right pivoting members 141, 142. According to the embodiment,<br><br>
as shown in Fig. 1 and Fig. 7, a containing portion mounting flange 101c expanded in a diameter direction is provided at a middle portion of the stay 101, and the slide fastener containing portion 150 in a ring-like shape is supported by an upper face of the &gt; containing portion mounting flange 101c to be able to be rotated intermittently centering on the stay 101 by a publicly-known intermittently rotating mechanism of a ratchet mechanism or the like, not illustrated. The slide fastener containingportion 150 in the ring-like shape is partitioned to a plurality of containing chambers 151 in a peripheral direction. Positions of arranging the respective containing chambers 151 are disposed right below the bottom portions 141a, 142a of the left and right pivoting members 141, 142.<br>
Now, a detailed explanation will be given of operations of cutting the fastener chain FC according to the embodiment by a unit of the slide fastener to be contained in the containing portion in the above-described constitution. Further, in explaining an operational procedure described below, as the slide fastener SF, an object of processing is constituted by a fastener chain attached with a fly for jeans attached with a plurality of flies applied to a front opening portion of jeans at predetermined interval in a longitudinal direction. As shown in Fig. 8, the fastener chain FC attached with the fly for jeans adopted in the embodiment is attached to a portion of a fastener tape T contiguous to one sides of the fastener element rows<br><br>
by sewing or the like. The fastener tape T extends over the fastener element rows ER. The flies F are provided with predetermined intervals OP therebetween. The intervals OP are positioned between end portions of contiguous flies F at a center of each interval portion S lacking the fastener element row ER of a normal fastener chain main body.<br>
The fly F may be attached deviatedly to one side in a width direction of the normal fastener chain main body and a front end corner portion in the transfer direction may be cut to be removed in a circular arc shape before being attached. In this kind of jeans, an upper end waist portion of the front opening portion is frequently formed to be inclined in a flat V-like shape in front view thereof. Therefore, when the fastener chain FC is cut at an end portion opposite to the inclined end of the fly F, it is necessary to cut the fastener chain FC to skewedly cross the chain transfer path 121. According to the successive manufacturing apparatus 100 of the slide fastener of the embodiment, the end portion inclined in this way can be formed. Naturally, regardless of whether the fly F is attached, the fastener chain FC can also be cut to orthogonally cross the chain transfer path 121.<br>
Now, when the fastener chain FC attached with the fly is going to be cut skewedly as described above, as shown in Fig. 4, when the cutting angle changing cylinder 113 is operated in the elongating direction, the whole of the chain cutting portion<br><br>
main body 112 is pivoted on the board 102 centering on the rotating shaft portion 111 along with the cutting blade 116 by way of the operating rod 112a pivotably attached to the rod end 113a. Although the rotating angle at this occasion is set to 10°, the rotating angle can be adjusted arbitrarily in a range of 0° through 15°. After adjusting the cutting angle of the cutting portion 110 in this way, the fastener chain FC attached with the fly is transferred to the chain cutting portion 110 by driving the feed roller pair 124.<br>
In the midst of the transfer, as shown in Fig. 8, the interval portion S to be cut passes through a position detected by the chain interval end portion detecting section 126. A front end portion of the interval portion S is fixedly attached with an upper stop piece 2 and a rear end thereof is fixedly attached with a lower stop piece 1. In the embodiment, although the upper stop piece 2 is fixedly attached only to one fastener stringer ST, the upper stop piece 2 may be fixedly attached to the left and right fastener stringers ST to be opposed to each other. Further, when the interval portion S passes through the position detected by the chain interval end portion detecting section 126 of a noncontact type or a photoelectric type and the chain interval end portion detecting section 126 detects the lower stop piece 1 or the element E, a detecting signal is transmitted to, for example, a timer or a length measuring section for counting a revolution number of the lower roller<br><br>
124b constituting the drive roller of the feed roller pair 124, not illustrated. Apreviously set transfer distance is measured by the measuring section and when the set transfer distance is reached, the measuring signal is transmitted to a control portion, not illustrated, a drive stop signal of a servo motor, not illustrated, constituting the drive source of the lower roller 124b is issued from the control portion to immediately stop rotation the lower roller 124 to stop transferring the fastener chain FC with a fly in a state shown in Fig.9.<br>
Incidentally, even when the fly F is not attached to the fastener chain FC, the lower stop piece or the element E fixedly attached to the rear end of the interval portion S is detected, and thereafter, a length is started to be measured and at a time point of reaching the set transfer distance, the fastener chain FC is stopped.<br>
The chain cutting cylinder 115 is operated simultaneously with stopping of the fastener chain FC attached with the fly-As shown in Fig.10, the chain cutting blade 116 is moved down and skewedly cut the fastener chain FC attached with the fly passing the chain inserting hole 112b along with the fly F between the chain cutting blade 116 and the cutting portion main body 112 to cut to separate the slide fastener SF attached with the fly. The slide fastener SF attached with the fly which has been cut to be separated slide down to the fastener receiving portion 140 by the self weight on the inclined face of the fastener<br><br>
slide down portion 130. During a time period of sliding down, the chain cutting cylinder 115 returns to the original standby position, and the cutting angle changing cylinder 113 is operated in the length contracting direction to make the pivoting angle of the chain cutting portion main body 112 0°.<br>
Here, in order to cut to remove an uncut portion SF-1 of the rear end portion of the slide fastener SF produced by cutting this time, as shown in Fig.11, the fastener chain FC attached with the fly is moved forward by a length of the uncut portion SF-1. When the forward moving is finished, the feed roller pair 124 is stopped to be driven. The chain cutting cylinder 115 is operated, and the interval portion S is cut to cross orthogonally the interval portion S of the fastener chain FC attached with the fly by the chain cutting blade 116. The cut chip produced by cutting to separate the uncut portion SF-1 is dropped to the cut chip discharge portion 112d provided at the lower portion of the chain inserting hole 112, and discharged from the opening to outside by passing the cut chip discharging path 112d-l by compressed air blown out from the air blow out port 112d-2.<br>
On the other hand, the slide fastener SF attached with the fly sliding down by the self weight on the fastener slide down portion 130 as described above is automatically introduced into the closed bottom portions 141a, 142a in the box-like shape of the left and right pivoting members 141, 142 at the fastener<br><br>
receiving portion 140 shown in Fig.5. Here, when the pivoting member operating cylinder 143 is operated in the length elongating direction, and the connector 144 fixed to the rod end is moved down, the shaft portions 141d, 142d projected from the left and right operating rods 141c, 142c inserted into the pair of left and right shaft portion supporting long holes 144a formed at the connector 144 are moved down and slidingly moved to the left and to the right in the shaft portion supporting long holes 144a. The left and right pivoting members 141, 142 are pivoted centering on the left and right support shafts 132 projected from the frame 131 in the gate shape forward, and the left and right pivoting members 141, 142 indicated by imaginary lines in Fig.6 are opened to positions indicated by bold lines in the drawing.<br>
When the left and right pivoting members 141, 142 are opened in this way, the slide fastener SF attached with the fly placed on the bottom portions 141a, 142a is dropped by the self weight from the opening and is contained in the fastener containing chamber 151 of the fastener containing portion 150 at standby on the lower side. At this occasion, by making the inclination angle β of the fastener receiving faces of the bottom portions 141a, 142a of the pivoting members 141, 142 more gradual than the inclination angle α of the fastener slide down portion 130, the slide fastener SF attached with the fly approaches the horizontal bottom face of the fastener containing chamber 151<br><br>
and therefore, an attitude of dropping the slide fastener attached with the fly dropped from the pivoting members 141, 142 is stabilized and is dropped regularly to the fastener containing chamber 151.<br>
Although not illustrated, a number of sheets of the slide fasteners attached with the fly dropped from the pivoting members 141, 142 is counted by a counter, when a number of sheets of containing the slide fasteners SF attached with the fly contained in the single fastener containing chamber 151 reaches a predetermined number, the fastener containing portion 150 is intermittently rotated centering on the stay 101 and the vacant fastener containing chamber 151 at a next position is moved to right below the pivoting members 141, 142.<br>
Fig. 13 and Fig. 14 show a second embodiment of the invention. In the first embodiment, the fastener containing portion 151 is intermittently rotated on the flange 101c formed integrally with the middle of the stay 101, and the slide fastener SF attached with the fly is contained in the respective fastener containing chambers 151. According to the second embodiment, the fastener containing portion 150 is not supported by the stay 101 but there is provided a frame 161 in a cylindrical shape extended from the stay 101 to a side of a portion of dropping the slide fastener SF attached with the fly. A rotating shaft 162 for rotatably supporting the fastener containing chamber 151 is rotatably erected at a center of a hollow portion of the frame<br><br>
161. A flange 162a is integrally formed with the rotating shaft 162 and the fastener containing portion 150 is mounted to be fixed on the flange 162a. Here, the stay 101 is disposed on an outer peripheral side of the fastener containing portion 150, and the fastener containing chamber 151 is disposed right below the left and right pivoting members 141, 142.<br>
The second embodiment is not changed from the first embodiment in that the board 102 is inclinedly supported, and other constitution is substantially the same as that of the first embodiment. However, as shown in Fig.14, the fastener containing chambers 151 according to the embodiment has six chambers partitioned by the partitions 152 at respective 60°.<br>
The fastener containing portion 150 is stopped after being rotated by 30°, a predetermined number of sheets of the slide fasteners attached with the fly are contained at a region of the single fastener containing chamber 151 contiguous to the partition 152 on a side in a rotational direction, thereafter, the fastener containingportion 150 is stopped after being rotated by 30°, and a predetermined number of sheets of the slide fasteners attached with the fly are contained at a region of the fastener containing chamber 151 contiguous to the partition 152 on a side opposed to the rotational direction. That is, two rows of the required numbers of sheets of the slide fasteners attached with the fly are contained at a single chamber of the fastener containing chamber 151. By repeating the procedure, the slide<br><br>
fasteners attached with the fly are contained successively in all of the fastener containing chambers 151. In order to intermittently rotating the fastener containing portion 151, a rotational driving portion, not illustrated, for driving the rotating shaft 162 is installed at the hollow portion of the frame 161.<br>
As can be understood from the above-described explanation, the successive manufacturing apparatus of the slide fastener according to the invention is applicable to all of the fastener chains from the fastener chain attached with the fly to a normal fastener chain which is not attached with the fly as described above. Also the cutting angle in cutting the interval portion can arbitrarily be adjusted from 0° to 15°. Naturally, when needed, a range of adjusting the cutting angle can further be changed.<br>
The invention is not limited to the above-described embodiments but various changes and modifications of its components may be made without departing from the scope of the present invention. For example, the fastener receiving portion 140 may be eliminated so that the fastener containing portion 150 is placed on the lower side of a fastener discharge end of the chain transfer path 121.</td>
