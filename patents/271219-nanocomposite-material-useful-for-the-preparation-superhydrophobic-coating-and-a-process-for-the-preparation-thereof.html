				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a nanocomposite material useful for the preparation of superhydrophobic coatings on the surface of a substrate. More particularly, the present invention relates to a nanocomposite material comprising Carbon Nanotube (CNT) and oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPV) of general formula Formula 1. The present invention also relates to a process for the preparation of nanocomposite material comprising Carbon Nanotube (CNT) and oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) (OPV) of general formula Formula 1.<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
Background of the invention<br>
Many of the plants in nature, such as lotus, taro, and haulm leaves, exhibit the unusual wetting characteristic of superhydrophobicity. A superhydrophobic surface is one that can cause water droplets to bead off completely. Such surfaces exhibit water droplet with advancing contact angle of 150° or higher. In addition the contact angle hysteresis can be very low (the receding contact angle is within 5° of the advancing contact angle), producing a surface on which water droplets simply roll off. A self-cleaning surface results since the rolling water droplets remove dirt and debris. The lotus leaf accomplishes this effect through the use of a surface topography that present two different length scales to the outside environment. The surface of the lotus leaf for example, is textured with 3-10 micron-sized hills and valleys that are decorated with nanometer-sized particles of a hydrophobic wax like material. The hills and valleys insure that the surface contact area available to water is very low while the hydrophobic nanoparticles prevent penetration of water into the valleys.<br><br>
The net result is that water cannot wet the surface and therefore forms nearly spherical water droplets, leading to superhydrophobic surfaces.<br>
Inspired by nature's self-cleaning superhydrophobic surfaces with contact angles (CA) larger than 150°and sliding angle 
Superhydrophobic materials have high surface roughness which can be created by following certain techniques, one such example is Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD). For example a technique for depositing thin layer of low surface energy materials is hot-filament chemical vapor deposition (HFCVD) which allows coating of objects with complex shape and nanoscale features. This technique can be used to deposit thin layers of a variety of polymers, including low surface energy polymers such as polytetrafluoroethylene. For further informations, see, e.g., United States Patent Application No. 2003/0138645 to Gleason et al.; K. K. S. Lau et al., "Hot-Wire Chemical Vapor Deposition (HECVD) of Fluorocarbon and Organosilicon Thin Films," Thin Solid Films, 2001,395, 288-291.<br>
Other methods for surface roughening are based on lithographic techniques in which a mask with desired feature is formed over the material to be modified and then the material is etched through the space in the mask. For example the use of photolithographic technique to prepare rough surface, see e.g., Jai Ou et al, " Laminar drag reduction in microchannels using ultraphobic surfaces," Physics of Fluids, Vol. 16, no. 12, December 2004.<br>
The creation of hydrophobic sol-gel with high contact angles have been reported by the use of various organosilane compounds see, e.g., A. V. Rao et al.,<br><br>
"Comparative studies on surface modifications of silica areogel based on various organosilane compounds of the type RnSiX4-n," Journal of Non-crystalline Solids, 2004, 350, 216-223.<br>
Synthetic superhydrophobic surfaces have been fabricated through various approches. A superhydrophobic surface is a surface that has a water droplet advancing contact angle of 150° or higher and the receding contact angle is with in 5° of the advancing contact angle and very low sliding angle. Some of the general strategies employed for the formation of CNT based superhydrophobic surfaces involve aligned CNT which were prepared through sophisticated techniques like plasma enhanced chemical vapor deposition and carbon nanofiber based superhydrophobic surfaces prepared by pyrolysis method. Reference may be made to Li, S., et al. J. Phys. Chem. B 2002, 106, 9274; Liu, H., et al. Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2004, 43, 1146; Lau, K. K. S., et al. Nano Lett. 2003, 3, 1701; Huang, L, etal. J. Phys. Chem. B. 2005, 709, 7746; Feng, L., ef al. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2003, 42, 4217; Zhu, Y., et al. Chem Phys Chem 2006, 7, 336.<br>
Surfaces which show superhydrophobic nature with corrosive liquids such as acidic and basic solutions are very important but rare, only few reports pertaining to this aspect is known in literature. Most of the superhydrophobic surface is demonstrated with pure water. It is essential to prepare superhydrophobic surfaces which have little or no effect due to the change in the pH environment. Reference may be made to Feng, L., et al. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2003, 42, 4217; Guo, Z., Zhou, F., Hao, J., Liu, W., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 727, 15670.<br>
One specific example for creating medical devices which have reduced resistance to movement of adjacent materials, including both fluid flow and solids can be seen in USPA: 2007/0005024. One specific example for micro fluidic device useful in industries for creating channels with predictable and optimal level of fluid flow resistance can be seen in US: 6923216. One specific example for creating superhydrophobic surfaces using silicon nanofibre constructed by gold colloid initiated chemical vapor deposition process, in that fluorinated nanowire surfaces have high contact angle, Reference may be made to US: 2005/0181195.<br><br>
Synthetic procedures to construct individual nanostructures on surfaces and in bulk are described for "Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes," Chem. Phys. Lett. 1998, 292, 567-574. Of course, the current invention is preferably done using different method of construction but the material used etc. may overlap.<br>
Superhydrophobic surfaces with CNT based composites are important because the field of CNT has created broad interest and numerous theoretical and experimental studies which reveal interesting chemical and physical properties for CNT based materials. They find application in organic light emitting diodes, optoelectronic and photovoltaic devices, sensors, field-emission device, logic gates, probes in chemistry and biology. It has been shown that the composite of n-conjugated molecules and CNT have promises for application in photovoltaic device, OLED, solar cells owing to the novel electronic interaction between these two elements. Reference may be made to Guldi, D. M., Rahman, G. M. A., Zerbetto, F., Prato, M., Ace. Chem. Res. 2005, 38, 871; Rahman G. M. A., et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2005, 727, 10051; Ago, H., Petritsch, K., Shaffer, M. S. P., Windle, A. H., Friend, R. H., Adv. Mater. 1999, 11, 1281.<br>
Accordingly this invention deals with Formula 1, which is an oligomer of poly(p-phenylenevinylene) polymer, the interaction of Formula 1 with carbon nanotubes are unknown and also invention deals with the creation of superhydrophobic coatings using nanocomposite material.<br>
Oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) derivatives are known to form self-assembled structures under different conditions, reference can be made to A. Ajayaghosh et al., J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 723, 5148-5149., and A. Ajayaghosh et al., Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2006, 45, 1141.Interaction of conjugated polymers with carbon nanotubes and their characterization can be seen through the following references, A. Star et al., Adv. Mater. 2001, 73, 899, and S. Curran et al., Syn. Met. 1999, 703, 2559.<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
In order to facilitate a better understanding of the invention a detailed description of the preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. Therefore the details disclosed herein are not to be interpreted as limiting but merely as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make or use the invention.<br>
The process and preparation of nanocomposite material for superhydrophobic coatings are as follows. Process for the development of superhydrophobic coatings<br>
Superhydrophobic carbon nanotube coatings can be achieved by following the procedure as outlined below. OPV/CNT composite solutions were prepared by dissolving OPV (4 - 6 mg) in common organic solvents like chloroform (10 ml) by heating around 40 °C. Then the OPV solution was added to a round bottom flask (25 ml) with CNT (4-6 mg) and sonicated for 30 minutes at 20-30 °C in a low power water bath sonicator. Then the OPV/CNT suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes at 20-30 °C and two-third of the supernatant liquid was decanted carefully from the settled solid and the resultant solution was stable for days; no subsequent settling of material has been observed during this period. Solid composite material was prepared by removing solvent at 20-30 °C by applying high vacuum; the resultant oligomers bounded nanotube composite was soluble in common organic solvents, including aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents including petrol, diesel and kerosene. Composite solution can be prepared by dissolving solid<br><br>
composite (1-10 mg) in common organic solvents (10 ml) like chloroform, toluene, hexane, decane etc.<br>
Initially substrates like metallic plates or glass plates were cleaned with solvents like chloroform or acetone by sonicating in a low power bath sonicator and then washed once again with fresh aliquots of solvents and dried in a vacuum oven for 1 hour at 80-90 °C. Freshly cleaved mica wafer or cleaned metallic or glass plates were mounted on a fixed platform or on a spin coating apparatus and then composite solution was drop casted or spin coated by allowing the solution to flow drop by drop on the substrate with a flow rate of 1-2 mL/min. Prior to the contact angle measurements composite coated substrates were placed in a vacuum chamber for 12 hours at 20-30 °C.<br>
The following examples are given by the way of illustration and therefore should not construed to limit the scope of the invention<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of nanocomposite material and characterization by spectroscopic<br>
studies:<br>
OPV/CNT composite solutions were prepared by dissolving OPV (4-6 mg) (40-60 wt %) in chloroform (10 ml) by heating around 40 °C. Then the OPV solution was added to a round bottom flask (25 ml) with CNT (4 - 6 mg) (40-60 wt %) and sonicated for 30 minutes at 20 °C in a low power water bath sonicator. Then the OPV/CNT suspension was centrifuged at 3000 rpm for 15 minutes at 20 °C and two-third of the supernatant liquid was decanted carefully from the settled solid and the resultant solution was stable for days; no subsequent settling of material has been observed during this period. Solid composite material was prepared by removing solvent at 20 °C by applying high vacuum; the resultant oligomers bounded nanotube composite was soluble in common organic solvents, including aliphatic hydrocarbon solvents including petrol, diesel and kerosene.<br><br>
In the present invention, oligo(p-phenylenevinylene) backbone will interact with the frame work of CNT and the six alkoxy side chains will interact with the solvent molecules that facilitate the stable dispersion of CNT in common organic and hydrocarbon solvents. The OPV solution in chloroform is yellow in color while it is changed to green in the presence of nanotubes. OPV/CNT solution in chloroform appeared to be quite clear, transparent and homogeneous (Figure 1a). Under UV illumination (Aex = 365 nm), composite solution shows a different emission color when compared with the blue emission of OPV in CHCIa, which is due to the absorption by CNT in the visible region (Figure 1b). The optical absorption spectra of OPV in CHCbwith X,max = 398 nm while the composite solution show absorption between 400 to 1000 nm which indicates the presence of OPV wrapped CNT in the solution (Figure 1c). Figure 1d shows the emission spectra of OPV before and after loading with CNTs, the marginal decrease in OPV emission intensity in the presence of CNT may be due to absorption, quenching and scattering by the nanotubes. The above mentioned observations reveal that the excited states of the OPV are not significantly affected by the presence of CNT.<br>
The 1H NMR (300 MHz / TMS standard / CDCI3) spectrum of the OPV (Formula 1, R = C16H33)/CNT composite reveals (Figure 2 bottom) significant broadening and very small shift in the resonance peak of the oligomer protons. This broadening arises most likely from the presence of the conducting CNT as well as from the catalytic impurities present along with CNT depending upon the preparation conditions of CNTs. However, this broadening is not completely regular, which indicates that some chemical information is retained in the spectra of the composite. For example, the signals for the aromatic and vinyl protons on the OPV as well as the protons of the side chain that are closest to the aromatic groups are the most broadened features. In addition, the peak intensities corresponding to the protons on the hexadecyloxy chains that are closest to the aromatic rings are greatly reduced relative to those of the protons that are toward those middle or terminus of those chains, similar phenomena have been observed previously. Such arrangement<br><br>
leaves the side chain attached to the oligomers able to wiggle around in solution. Reference may be made to Star, A., etal. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2001, 40, 1721.<br>
The distinct feature of FT-IR spectrum of CNT is the C-H stretching mode at 2921 cm'1 and 2852 cm'1 and C=C stretching vibration of the CNT back bone at 1580 cm"1 (Figure 3a). FT-IR spectrum of OPV (Formula 1, R = C16H33) shows peaks at 2918 and 2848 cm"1 corresponding to C-H stretching vibration, C=C stretching mode at 1601 cm"1, and bending modes at 1068, 840, 800, and 721 cm"1 (Figure 3b). The presence of CNT made significant change in the overall spectrum of OPV, the peaks at 2920, 2850, and 1465 cm"1 might arise from the overlapping of the features of MWCNT and OPV as the positions of these peaks are close to those of CNT and OPV. The C-H wagging band at 1258 cm"1 in OPV disappeared completely after the interaction with CNT, implying that this vibration has been seriously broadened by the strong interaction with the CNT surface (Figure 3c). These results suggest that the interaction between adsorbed OPV and CNT is strong and noncovalent. Reference may be made to Zhang, J., Lee, J. K., Wu, Y., and Murray, R. W., Nano Lett. 2003, 3, 403.<br>
Example 2<br>
Characterization by thermal studies:<br>
Differential Scanning Calorimetric (DSC) analysis shows strong interaction between OPV and CNT. Pristine OPV (Formula 1, R = C16H33) shows melting at 110 °C, while in the presence of CNT the melting occurs at higher temperature, 111 °C (Figure 4). The adsorption of OPV on the surface of CNT restricts the free movement of the OPV molecules and eventually it will result in higher energy for phase transition from solid to liquid. At the same time the phase transition from liquid to solid state arises at higher temperature (96 °C) for CNT/OPV composite, when compared with OPV (93 °C) and it may be due to CNT mediated crystallization of OPV. Transition in OPV around 63 °C is completely disappeared in the presence of CNT, these things shows that the strong interaction between CNT and OPV makes significant change in the DSC.

In order to obtain additional information on the it-it interaction and thermal stability of the composite, TGA was performed under air at a heating rate of 10 °C/min and DTA curves obtained from TGA studies. Figure 5a shows the pyrolysis temperature (565 °C) attains a plateau region for composite, which is lower than that of the OPV (685 °C). The onset decomposition temperature of OPV (Formula 1, R = C16H33) in composite is at lower temperature (210 °C) figure 5b and in the absence of CNT it is relatively at higher temperature (233 °C). These observations reveal that the stability of the OPV molecules anchored on the CNT is lower, which means, the internal energy of the adsorbed OPV molecules increased because of its it-it interaction with the CNT. We attribute the phenomenon to the twist of the molecular configuration of the OPV to a small extend, to match well with the cylindrical structure of the CNT and thus firmly immobilize OPV on the surface of CNT. It is only structural twist that results in the increase in the internal energy of the OPV molecules results in the decrease in the pyrolysis temperature.

Example 3<br>
Characterization by XRD and contact angle studies:<br>
Thin film of OPV, CNT and OPV/CNT composite were prepared by evaporating chloroform from their respective solutions at room temperature. X-ray diffraction patterns of thin film of OPV (Formula 1, R = C16H33) shows characteristic T-TT stacking features of OPV molecules at 4.56 A and 3.87 A (Figure 6ii), The XRD pattern of the composite exhibits Bragg reflection at 29 = 26.4° (Figure 6iii) corresponding to the intershell spacing (3.37 A) of the concentric cylinders of graphitic carbon which can be seen from CNT, XRD pattern in figure 6i. Reference may be made to Tang B. Z., and Xu, H., Macromolecules 1999, 32, 2569.<br>
Optical images of water drop on CNT, OPV (Formula 1, R = C16H33) and composite, were shown in Figure 7a, b and c. The water contact angle of CNT (128° ± 5°) and OPV (106° ± 3°) (Formula 1, R = C16H33), were shown in Figure 7(d) and (e) respectively. Figure 7(f), (h) and (j) shows advancing contact angle on composite surfaces OPV Formula 1, R = C16H33, C12H25, and C8H17 with 165° ± 2°, 164° ± 2° and<br><br>
163°± 2° respectively, and Figure 7(g), (i) and (k) shows and receding contact angle on composite surfaces OPV Formula 1, R = C16H33, C12H25, and C8H17 with 164°± 2°, 162° ± 2° and 162° ± 2° respectively.<br>
Composites with different weight percentage of CNT can be prepared by dispersing the required amount of CNT in the OPV chloroform solution by sonication and evaporating the solvent over glass or metallic surface to get the thin film surface. Although the films of CNT and OPV are hydrophobic, water droplets on these surfaces show low advancing and receding angles. In the case of the unmodified CNT, the water droplets slowly penetrate into the film eventually wetting the surface.<br>
Figure 8a shows the relationship between contact angle (CA) and pH on the CNT, OPV (Formula 1, R = Ci6H33) and composite surface. CA on these surfaces remains unchanged within the experimental error (± 2°) when the pH varied from 1 to 14 (Figure 7d), that is, the CAs are larger than 150° for not only water but also corrosive liquids, such as acidic and basic aqueous solutions. Figure 8b shows the relationship between the CNT content in the composite film and the CA for water on the corresponding composite film, which clearly demonstrates that the CA increases with increase in the content of CNT in the composite and reaches 165° for 50 wt % of CNT. Further increase in CNT content in the composite results in decrease in CA. The decrease in the content of the OPV results in the increase in the content of the naked CNT which is reflected in the decrease of hydrophobic nature of composite film.<br>
Figure 9 shows the time dependence of water contact angle for the OPV (Formula 1, R = C16H33), CNT and composite (1:1) coating. It is observed that the water CA of CNT coating decreases linearly with time, from an initial value of 128° to 0° within 20 min. However the CA of the composite film remains constant even after 24 hrs continuous treatments with water, showing a stable superhydrophobicity (CA &gt; 150°). Since the composite forms a well packed surface ensures water will not seep in to the CNTs.<br><br>
Example 4<br>
Characterization by Morphological studies:<br>
Adsorption of the OPV results in a "hairy" nanotube surface with a subnanoscopic hydrocarbon coating on the outer wall of the CNT (Figure 10c and d) resulting in a surface with micro rough overall morphology. Figure 10a and b are films of CNT and OPV respectively. To thoroughly understand the superhydrophobic surface, theoretical considerations are necessary. The CA on a composite surface (θr) can be expressed by modified Cassie's equation (1). Here θr and θ are the contact angles on the composite (rough) and OPV (smooth) surface, respectively; fi is the fraction of solid/water interface, while f2 is that of the air/water interface, (i.e., fi + f2 = 1) indicates that, when a rough surface comes in contact with water, air trapping in the trough area may occur, which would contribute greatly to the increase of hydrophobicity.<br>
(Equation Removed)                                                   (1)<br>
According to the equation (1), the fe value of the composite surface estimated to be 0.954 by using the contact angle values obtained which indicates that the fraction of the air in the surface is very high. Reference may be made from Feng, L, etal. Angew. Chem., Int. Ed. 2002, 41, 1221.<br>
Water droplets roll on composite surface much more readily when compared to CNT and OPV surfaces. This is explained by their difference in contact angle hysteresis; the force required to move the droplets is F ~ YLV (cosθR - cos ΘA), and the values of cosθR - cos GA for CNT, OPV, and composite are 0.44, 0.24 and 0.01, respectively. It thus takes about 44 times and 24 times as much force, 31.82 and 17.38 vs 0.69 dyn/cm, on CNT and OPV than on composite.<br>
Figure 11a shows the AFM image of superhydrophobic surface and Figure 11b shows the OPV (Formula 1, R = C16H33) modified individual CNT. These images shows the strong interaction between carbon nanotubes and OPV molecules, the height variation along CNT surface shows the adsorption of OPV molecules over the nanotube surface. The roughness from micrometer level to nanometer level results in the superhydrophobic nature of the composite surface.<br><br>

Basically whenever a superhydrophobic surface is desired, the current invention can optionally be utilized. It will be appreciated, therefore, that specific uses/method/etc, claimed or described here are<br>
illustrative, but not limiting. Thus, other non-described uses/methods comprising the current nanocomposite and/or their usage are also features of the invention.<br>
A number of valuable applications for the invention rely upon the ability of the substrate surfaces of the invention to easily shed or slide water off the surface. For example, when a surface is frequently or continuously flowed over by water, the substrate of the invention can be used to substantially reduce any viscous drag through such conduits thus dramatically reducing power requirements for transferring fluids from one level to another. Similarly marine vessels can be coated with the materials described in the invention at the point of interface with the water, to reduce the level of viscous grag on that interface, such a reduction in drag will decrease the reduction of cost of transport and increase the fuel efficiency and increased speed, the material described herein can be created over different surfaces e.g. the hull of a boat and many other applications.<br>
The material described herein can be used optionally as self-cleaning surfaces, since due to the movement of water beads over the composite surface can optionally pick up deposited dirt, etc. Thus the present material can be used over aircraft surfaces, especially the wings, satellite-warps, sidings, etc.<br>
Other application of the invention comprises, use to clear snow or ice or water build up on structures, for example plane bodies, antennas, telecommunication dishes, road signs, etc. to stay ice/ snow/water free.<br>
Application involving such constructs as barrier layers for transporting water through canals and water pipes, micro fluidic device, etc.<br>
Similar application can optionally provide anti-fouling surfaces that prevent mold/mildew formation in humid area. Thus, embodiments of the invention can be used to prevent/reduce intrusion of water into an area.<br>
The current invention can be optionally used in printing. For example superhydrophobic areas can optionally provide a method of printing or transferring ink in a desired pattern. The ink would tend to position itself on the hydrophobic and hydrophilic regions. Using superhydrophobic patterns provides the advantage that the superhydrophobic areas are likely to have very little contaminator from the ink and could be used with different compounds with less contamination.<br>
The above are illustrative of various uses/applications of the superhydrophobic carbon nanotube coatings of the invention. Again, the enumeration of the specific embodiments herein not to be taken as necessarily limiting on the other non-detailed uses/applications which comprise the superhydrophobic surface of the current invention.
