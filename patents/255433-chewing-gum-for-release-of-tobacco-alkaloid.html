				<td>Background of the invention<br>
Craving or addiction:<br>
Medical and scientific communities in the US agree that nicotine is addictive.<br>
Nicotine meets both the psychological and physiological measures of addiction:<br>
Psychological - people who are addicted to something will use it compulsively,<br>
without regard for its negative effects on their health or life. A good example would<br>
be someone who continues to smoke, even as they use an oxygen tank to breathe<br>
because of the damage smoking has done to their lungs.<br>
Physiological - neuroscientists call anything that turns on the reward pathway in the<br>
brain addictive. Because stimulating this neural circuitry makes you so good, you<br>
will continue to do it again and again to get those feelings back.<br>
When smokers abruptly stop smoking - the body cannot function the same way in<br>
the absence of the drug as it did before, the physiological effects for nicotine remain,<br>
at least in the short term. They will experience: Irritability, anxiety, depression and<br>
craving for nicotine.<br>
Over a period these symptoms and physiological changes subside. It is in this period<br>
alternative methods of nicotine delivery is essential in order to succeed quitting<br>
smoking.<br>
Nicotine:<br><br>
Nicotine normally makes up about 5% of a tobacco plant, by weight. Cigarettes<br>
contain 8 - 20 mg of nicotine depending on the brand, but only approximately 1 mg<br>
is actually absorbed by your body when you smoke a cigarette.<br>
Nicotine's effects are short-lived, lasting only 40 minutes to a couple of hours. This<br>
leads people to smoke tobacco periodically throughout the day to dose themselves<br>
with nicotine. Within 10-15 seconds of inhaling, most smokers are in the throes of<br>
nicotine's effects.<br>
Different approaches may be made in order to counteract craving related to absence<br>
of nicotine in the blood.<br>
Many pharmacotherapies have been developed or explored for aiding smokers to<br>
cease smoking. The predominant one is nicotine replacement therapies. Nicotine<br>
replacement therapies involve the administration of nicotine through suitable<br>
delivery systems. Nicotine replacement products available on the market include<br>
nicotine transdermal patches, inhalators, nicotine nasal spray or nicotine chewing<br>
gum. These types of products, like cigarettes, deliver nicotine to the blood via<br>
diffusion of nicotine through the skin or the mucous membrane.<br>
Nicotine transdermal patches release nicotine into the bloodstream through the skin.<br>
A patch is applied each day to a different area of dry, clean, non-hairy skin and left<br>
as long as recommended on the product labelling - typically the non-sleeping hours<br>
of a day. Using the product generates a constant low concentration of nicotine to the<br>
blood over the period applied.<br>
Nicotine nasal spray is inhaled into the person's nose from a pump bottle and<br>
absorbed through the nasal lining into the bloodstream. This form of nicotine<br>
delivery system generates a fast increase of nicotine concentration in the blood -<br>
almost as fast as the cigarette.<br><br>
Nicotine inhalator enters the user's mouth through a mouthpiece attached to a plastic<br>
cartridge. Although the product is called an "inhaler", it does not deliver nicotine to<br>
the lungs the way a cigarette does. Almost all of the nicotine travels only as far as the<br>
mouth and throat, where it is absorbed through the mucous membrane.<br>
Nicotine chewing gum releases nicotine into the bloodstream through the lining of<br>
the mouth, i.e. the mucous membrane. Unlike gum chewed for pleasure, nicotine<br>
gum requires a measured routine - it is chewed slowly until a slight tingling occurs<br>
or a peppery taste comes out, then it is placed between the check and gum until the<br>
taste or tingling is almost gone. The cycle is typically repeated for about 30 minutes<br>
per gum. Products available slowly build up the nicotine blood concentration over<br>
the first 10-15 minutes of chewing.<br>
The present invention relates to counteracting of craving by means of nicotine<br>
holding chewing gum.<br>
Counteracting of craving by means of nicotine holding chewing gum as such is well-<br>
known within the art.<br>
Basically two different paths have been followed in the prior art, alone or in<br>
combination.<br>
The original approach was to incorporate nicotine in chewing gum and then match<br>
the release of chewing gum with the overall total desired release of nicotine over the<br>
entire chewing period. Typically, such an approach involves considerations with<br>
respect to the release of nicotine over a day compared to one or several different<br>
smoking patterns.<br><br>
A further attempt to improve the counteracting of craving by means of chewing gum<br>
is to incorporate nicotine in e.g. the coat of a coated chewing gum. Such an approach<br>
may be referred to as biphasic within the art, i.e. the approach of providing an initial<br>
significant dose of nicotine immediately after chewing of a chewing gum has been<br>
initiated and then subsequently, providing a second long term dose subsequently.<br>
Such subsequent dose is also referred to as maintenance dose may e.g. last from<br>
about 10 minutes to 30 minutes of the chewing process.<br>
A problem related to the prior art is however that some users of the chewing gum<br>
may dislike especially the initial dose and mat the subsequent dose typically<br>
mismatches the expectations of the user with respect to relieving of nicotine related<br>
craving.<br>
It is the object of the invention to obtain a chewing gum, which may be applied for<br>
an effective and user-acceptable counteracting of craving not only after use but also<br>
during use.<br>
Summary<br>
The invention relates to a method of relieving nicotine craving comprising the steps<br>
of<br>
providing at least one chewing gum comprising tobacco alkaloid to a user,<br>
providing relief of nicotine craving to said user by transferring of tobacco alkaloid<br>
from the chewing gum to the human body of said user by chewing of said chewing<br>
gum,<br>
said chewing of said chewing gum comprising a chewing process involving a<br>
transfer of tobacco alkaloid from said chewing gum above a threshold transfer rate in<br><br>
the period of about 54 minute to about 2½ minutes from initiation of said chewing<br>
process.<br>
According to the invention a transfer of nicotine or generally a tobacco alkaloid is<br>
maintained at a threshold transfer rate in an intermediate phase of the chewing<br>
process thereby facilitating an advantageous and effective fast relief due to the fact<br>
that transfer in this particular period affects the perception of nicotine and the<br>
resulting relief significantly e.g. compared to transfer of nicotine late in the chewing<br>
process. It is especially noted that a desired "relief kick" according to the invention<br>
involves that a typically overlooked period of the chewing process, also referred to as<br>
the intermediate phase, provide a very significant part of the desirable nicotine dose<br>
to the human body as this particular period is within the typical time allocated to the<br>
smoking of a cigarette.	<br>
According to the invention threshold transfer rate is understood as a minimum rate of<br>
nicotine transfer in a given time interval. In other words, transfer rates above this<br>
minimum rate may be applied within the scope of the invention. 254 minutes<br>
corresponds to 150 seconds.<br>
According to the invention it has been realised that one of the problems related to the<br>
prior art is that a relief to the user of the chewing gum is hardly obtained or at least<br>
slowly when compared to the smoking of a cigarette. It has also been realised that the<br>
provisions of the prior art related to this problem is typically concerned with the<br>
amount of released nicotine from the chewing gum and basically not giving much<br>
thought of how the actual transfer of nicotine is performed. This is both the fact with<br>
respect to conventional long term release based on a chewing time over<br>
approximately 30 minutes and the fast release of nicotine in e.g. coating. Thus, it has<br>
been realised that a very fast release of nicotine, e.g. from the coating, over the first<br>
few seconds appears to have too little influence on the first five to ten minutes of<br><br>
chewing due to the fact that a large part of this nicotine is swallowed and transferred<br>
to the blood merely metabolically.<br>
According to the invention a transfer rate should be understood as a transfer rate of<br>
nicotine or tobacco alkaloid from the chewing gum to the exterior, i.e. a release rate<br>
although the basic desired performance of the chewing gum also includes a transfer<br>
from the chewing gum to the blood of the relevant human body. Such a release rate<br>
may e.g. be measured in sub-periods of 30 seconds.<br>
In the present invention the term "tobacco alkaloid" mean nicotine or nicotine-like<br>
alkaloid such as nor-nicotine, lobeline, and the like, in the free base or<br>
pharmacologically acceptable acid addition salt form. Plant alkaloids of this type are<br>
obtainable from species of Nicotiana which is a source for nicotine and nor-nicotine,<br>
as well as species of Lobelia and Lobeliaceae (Indian tobacco) which are a source for<br>
lobeline.<br>
Moreover, it is generally noted that specific examples and explanation specifically<br>
referring to nicotine as active agent against craving in no way restricts the scope of<br>
the invention with respect to use of other tobacco alkaloids for the same specific<br>
purpose. A specific mentioning of nicotine at any place in this application is only<br>
used for the purpose of exemplifying the invention in a tangible way and not for the<br>
purpose of excluding alternative functionally equivalents.<br>
It should generally be noted that nicotine is a preferred tobacco alkaloid.<br>
In the present invention, the term nicotine encompasses nicotine or a nicotine<br>
derivative in any form such as, e.g. physical forms like amorphous, crystalline,<br>
polymerphous etc. or chemical form like isomers and enantiomers etc. as well as any<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, complex or solvate thereof. Nicotine may be<br>
selected from nicotine base, nicotine hydrochloride, nicotine dihydrochloride,<br>
nicotine monotartrate, nicotine bitartrate, nicotine sulfate, nicotine zinc chloride such<br>
as zinc chloride monohydrate and nicotine salicylate.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention said tobacco alkaloid comprises nicotine.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said transfer rate refer to a transfer of nicotine<br>
from the chewing gum to the exterior of the chewing gum.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, the chewing time may<br>
be shortened significantly for at least two different reasons, first of all: a relief is<br>
obtained by the user relatively fast due to the provisions of the invention and<br>
secondly: a mere maintenance of nicotine in the blood appears to be a dynamic more<br>
than a stationary process thereby rendering a mere continuous maintenance of<br>
nicotine less desirable to a user compared to a fast relied of initiated craving. In other<br>
words, relief of craving appears to be a dynamic process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate is evaluated in sub<br>
periods of the period of about 54 minute to about 254 minutes from initiation of said<br>
chewing process.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, a sub period of 30 seconds may be<br>
advantageous for the purpose of establishing whether the transfer rate is maintained.<br>
A transfer rate measured in 30 seconds has thus proved sufficient for the purpose of<br>
obtaining a fast relief. Thus, when applying a sub period of 30 seconds, a transfer<br>
should comply with requirements defined in four sub periods, namely the sub periods<br>
½-1 minute, 1-1½ minute, 1½-2 minutes and 2-2½ minutes.<br>
Evidently even transfer rates may be measured in shorter sub periods of time, e.g. 15<br>
seconds may be applied. Longer sub periods may also be applied or sub periods of<br>
different length, although the period should be chosen carefully for the purpose of<br>
avoiding lowering or dropouts of the nicotine or tobacco alkaloid transfer during the<br>
intermediate release. In particular, according to the invention, a dropout should be<br>
avoided in the intermediate transfer, i.e. from about 54 to 254 minutes as such a<br><br>
dropout inevitably would result in a lowered transfer in spite of the fact that a<br>
complete release of nicotine is high.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said chewing of said chewing gum comprising a<br>
chewing process involving a transfer of tobacco alkaloid from said chewing gum<br>
above a further threshold transfer rate in the period of about 2½ minutes to about 10<br>
minutes from initiation of said chewing process, preferably in the period of about 2½<br>
minutes to about 5 minutes from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
According to a further embodiment of the invention a further threshold value may be<br>
applied for the chewing process after the initial 214 minutes of chewing. Thus,<br>
according to an advantageous embodiment of the invention such threshold value<br>
should preferably ensure that a relatively high tobacco alkaloid transfer is obtained in<br>
the period from 2½ minutes up to 10 or preferably at least 5 minutes.<br>
In this way, maintenance of the initially obtained relief may be obtained.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate results in a release of<br>
at least 2%, preferably at least 2.5% of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in said<br>
chewing gum prior to chewing, every 30 seconds in the period from ½ minutes to<br>
about 2½ minutes from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the tobacco alkaloid release of the<br>
chewing is at least 2%, preferably at least 2.5%, every thirty seconds thereby<br>
maintaining a high osmotic pressure on the mucosa membrane when chewing. This<br>
initial focussing on keeping tobacco alkaloid constantly available in the mouth is in<br>
particular important in the early phase of the chewing process due to the fact that a<br>
fast relief to a user should preferably be obtained quite fast compared to conventional<br>
tobacco alkaloid containing chewing gum and that such desired fast relief requires<br>
not only just sporadic or late release phases but a maintained constantly high<br><br>
availability of tobacco alkaloid in the mouth over at least a part of the period usually<br>
required for smoking a cigarette.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate results in a release of<br>
at least 3%, preferably at least about 4 % of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in said<br>
chewing gum prior to chewing, every 30 seconds in the period from about ½ minute<br>
to about 2½ minutes from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the tobacco alkaloid release of the<br>
chewing is at least 3%, preferably at least 4%, every thirty seconds thereby<br>
maintaining a high osmotic pressure on the mucosa membrane when chewing. This<br>
initial focussing on keeping tobacco alkaloid constantly available in the mouth is in<br>
particular important in the early phase of the chewing process due to the fact that a<br>
fast relief to a user should preferably be obtained quite fast compared to conventional<br>
tobacco alkaloid containing chewing gum and that such desired fast relief requires<br>
not only just sporadic or late release phases but a maintained constantly high<br>
availability of tobacco alkaloid in the mouth over at least a part of the period usually<br>
required for smoking a cigarette.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate results in a release of<br>
at least 5%, preferably at least about 6% of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in said<br>
chewing gum prior to chewing, every 30 seconds in the period from about ½ minute<br>
to about 2½ minutes from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the invention a transfer rate may<br>
be established and maintained at a high level thereby featuring an improved fast<br>
relief of the user.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate results in a release of<br>
at least 2%, preferably at least 3% of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in said chewing<br><br>
gum prior to chewing, every 30 seconds in the period of about 254 minutes to about 5<br>
minutes from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, tobacco alkaloid<br>
should also be kept available at high rate in the period of about 214 to 5 minutes after<br>
initiation of the chewing process. Again, it should be noted that such threshold rate<br>
should be complied with at virtually anytime within the interval of 2.5 to 5 minutes<br>
from initiation of the chewing process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate results in a release of<br>
at least 3%, preferably at least 3.5% of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in said<br>
chewing gum prior to chewing, every 30 seconds in the period of about 254 minutes<br>
to about 5 minutes from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the invention, tobacco alkaloid<br>
should also be kept available at high rate in the period of about 254 to 5 minutes after<br>
initiation of the chewing process. Again, it should be noted that such threshold rate<br>
should be complied with at virtually time within the interval of 2.5 to 5 minutes from<br>
initiation of the chewing process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention wherein said threshold transfer rate results in a<br>
release of at least 4%, preferably at least 5% of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in<br>
said chewing gum prior to chewing, every 30 seconds in the period of about 5<br>
minutes to about 10 minutes from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate results in a release of<br>
at least 2 to 10 %, preferably at least 5% of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in said<br>
chewing gum prior to chewing in the period of about 0 seconds to about 30 seconds<br>
from initiation of said chewing process.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate results in a release of<br>
less than 14 %, preferably less than 12% of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in said<br>
chewing gum prior to chewing in the period of about 0 seconds to about 2½ minutes<br>
from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the initial transfer of tobacco alkaloid<br>
from the chewing gum should be kept below 12 to 14 % of the tobacco alkaloid<br>
comprised in the chewing gum prior to chewing in order to avoid socalled burning or<br>
tingling. Moreover, too much releasing of e.g. nicotine would on the other hand<br>
result in that a part of the released nicotine is swallowed and therefore only effective<br>
by a metabolic transfer.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate results in a release of<br>
at most 18 %, preferably at most 15% of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in said<br>
chewing gum prior to chewing in the period of about 10 to about 30 minutes from<br>
initiation of said chewing process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate results in a release of<br>
at least 0.03 mg, preferably at least 0.04 mg of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in said<br>
chewing gum prior to chewing, every 30 seconds in the period from about 54 minute<br>
to about 2% minutes from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
According to the invention a build-up of nicotine or tobacco alkaloid in the blood<br>
should preferably be obtained by a maintained osmotic pressure on the mucous<br>
membrane of the mouth in the intermediate period of the chewing process, e.g. in the<br>
first ten minutes of the chewing process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate results in a release of<br>
at least 0.05 mg, preferably at least 0.06 mg of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in said<br><br>
chewing gum prior to chewing, every 30 seconds in the period from about ½ minute<br>
to about 2½ minutes from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate results in a release of<br>
at least 0.08 mg, preferably at least 0.1 mg of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in said<br>
chewing gum prior to chewing, every 30 seconds in the period from about ½ minute<br>
to about 2½ minutes from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate results in a release of<br>
at least 0.03 mg, preferably at least 0.04 mg of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in said<br>
chewing gum prior to chewing, every 30 seconds in the period of about 2½ to about<br>
5 minutes from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said threshold transfer rate results in a release of<br>
at least 0.05 mg, preferably at least 0.06 mg of the tobacco alkaloid comprised in said<br>
chewing gum prior to chewing, every 30 seconds in the period of about 2½ minutes<br>
to about 5 minutes from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention wherein said threshold transfer rate results in a<br>
release of at least 0.08 mg, preferably at least 0.1 mg of the tobacco alkaloid<br>
comprised in said chewing gum prior to chewing, every 30 seconds in the period of<br>
about 2½ minutes to about 5 minutes from initiation of said chewing process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention at least 0.5 mg of tobacco alkaloid is released<br>
within the initial 10 minutes of the chewing process or preferably within the initial 5<br>
to 8 minutes of the chewing process.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention even higher release should be obtained<br>
such as at least 0.8 mg of tobacco alkaloid is released within the initial 10 minutes of<br><br>
the chewing process or preferably within the initial 5 to 8 minutes of the chewing<br>
process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention wherein different parts of the chewing gum is<br>
targeted tobacco alkaloid transfer at different times or in different periods of the<br>
chewing process.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention different parts of the chewing gum<br>
may be targeted tobacco alkaloid transfer at different times or in different periods of<br>
the chewing process, thereby facilitating the obtaining of the desired constant<br>
transfers or at least the desired minimum transfer of the relevant period of the<br>
chewing process, i.e. typically during the first three to five minutes of the chewing<br>
process. Thus, e.g. the very initial transfer of tobacco alkaloid, i.e. the first seconds<br>
of the chewing process, may be increased by means of e.g. nicotine containing<br>
coating. Alternatively, nicotine may be comprised in beads or other release-delaying<br>
means. Again, further means may include mixture of different polymers having<br>
different release properties. Further means may include different types of buffering.<br>
Thus the threshold transfer rate is obtained by a combination of different parts of the<br>
chewing having different release profiles.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention wherein said chewing gum comprising a coating<br>
and wherein said coating comprises tobacco alkaloid.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, tobacco alkaloid is comprised in the<br>
coating and may therefore be released quite fast in the very early stage of the<br>
chewing process.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said chewing gum comprises substantially<br>
hydrophilic polymers.<br><br>
In an embodiment of the invention the variation of transfer rate is minimized.<br>
According to an embodiment of the invention, the significant variations of tobacco<br>
alkaloid over time should be avoided in order to obtain an advantageous taste<br>
masking. A sudden tobacco alkaloid peak would thus be difficult to taste mask,<br>
especially when dealing with peaks occurring subsequently to the very initial<br>
chewing process. I1 and I3 as described below are examples of such smoothed<br>
release.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention wherein said tobacco alkaloid is comprised in a<br>
ion exchange resin.<br>
According to an embodiment tobacco alkaloid is nicotine polacrilex.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention wherein said tobacco alkaloid comprises salts of<br>
nicotine.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention said tobacco alkaloid comprises nicotine in its<br>
free from.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the tobacco alkaloid is buffered.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention the chewing process is less than 30 minutes,<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
In general, a chewing gum composition typically comprises a water-soluble bulk<br>
portion, a water-insoluble chewable gum base portion and flavouring agents. The<br>
water-soluble portion dissipates with a portion of the flavouring agent over a period<br>
of time during chewing. The gum base portion is retained in the mouth throughout<br>
the chew. The term chewing gum refers to both a chewing and bubble type gum in its<br>
general	sense.<br>
The gum base is the masticatory substance of the chewing gum, which imparts the<br>
chew characteristics to the final product. The gum base typically defines the release<br>
profile of flavours and sweeteners and plays a significant role in the gum product.<br>
The insoluble portion of the gum typically may contain any combination of<br>
elastomers, vinyl polymers, elastomer plasticizers, waxes, softeners, fillers and other<br>
optional ingredients such as colourants and antioxidants.<br>
The composition of gum base formulations can vary substantially depending on the<br>
particular product to be prepared and on the desired masticatory and other sensory<br>
characteristics of the final product. However, typical ranges (% by weight) of the<br>
above gum base components are: 5 to 50% by weight elastomeric compounds, 5 to<br>
55% by weight elastomer plasticizers, 0 to 40% by weight of waxes, 5 to 35% by<br>
weight softener, 0 to 50% by weight filler, and 0 to 5% by weight of miscellaneous<br>
ingredients such as antioxidants, colourants, etc.<br>
Function	of	elastomers<br>
Elastomers provide the rubbery, cohesive nature to the gum, which varies depending<br>
on this ingredient's chemical structure and how it may be compounded with other<br><br>
ingredients. Elastomers suitable for use in the gum base and gum of the present<br>
invention may include natural or synthetic types.<br>
Elastomers<br>
The elastomer may be any water-insoluble polymer known in the art, and includes<br>
those gum polymers utilized for chewing gum and bubble gum listed in Food and<br>
Drug Administration, CFR, Title 21, Section 172,615, as "Masticatory Substances of<br>
Natural Vegetable Origin" and "Masticatory Substances, Synthetic"<br>
Useful natural elastomers include natural rubber such as smoked or liquid latex and<br>
guayule, natural gums such as jelutong, lechi caspi, perillo, sorva, massaranduba<br>
balata, massaranduba chocolate, nispero, rosidinha, chicle, gutta percha, gutta kataiu,<br>
niger gutta, tunu, chilte, chiquibul, gutta hang kang.<br>
Useful synthetic elastomers include high molecular weight elastomers such as<br>
butadiene-styrene copolymers, polyisobutadiene and isobutylene-isoprene<br>
copolymers, low molecular weight elastomers such as polybutene, polybutadiene and<br>
polyisobutylene, vinyl polymeric elastomers such as polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene,<br>
vinyl copolymeric elastomers such as vinyl acetate/vinyl laurate, vinyl acetate/vinyl<br>
stearate, ethylene/vinyl acetate, polyvinyl alcohol or mixtures thereof.<br>
Butadiene-styrene type elastomers, or SBR as they may be called, typically are<br>
copolymers of from about 20:80 to 60:40 styrenes:butadiene monomers. The ratio of<br>
these monomers affects the elasticity of the SBR as evaluated by mooney viscosity.<br>
As the styrene:butadiene ratio decreases, the mooney viscosity decreases.<br>
The structure of SBR typically consists of straight chain 1,3-butadiene<br>
copolymerized with phenylethylene (styrene) and provides the non-linear molecular<br>
nature of these elastomers. The average molecular weight of SBR is 
g/mole.<br><br>
Isobutylene-isoprene type elastomers, or butyl as they may be called, have molar<br>
percent levels of isoprene ranging from 0.2 to 4.0. Similar to SBR, as the<br>
isoprene:isobutylene ratio decreases, so does the elasticity, measured by mooney<br>
viscosity.<br>
The structure of butyl rubber typically consists of branched 2-methyl-l,3-butadiene<br>
(isoprene) copolymerized with branched 2-methylpropene (isobutylene), and, as with<br>
SBR, this type of structure is non-linear in nature. The average molecular weight of<br>
SBR is in the range from 150.000 g/mole to 1.000.000 g/mole.<br>
Polyisobutylene, or PIB as they may be called, type elastomers are polymers of 2-<br>
methylpropene and, as with SBR and butyl, are non-linear in nature. The low<br>
molecular weight elastomers provide soft chew characteristics to the gum base and<br>
still provide the elastic qualities as do the other elastomers. Average molecular<br>
weights may range from about 30,000 to 120,000 g/mole and the penetration may<br>
range from about 4 millimetres to 20 millimetres. The higher the penetration, the<br>
softer the PIB. Similar to the SBR and butyl, the high molecular weight elastomers<br>
provide elasticity the gum. Average molecular weight may range from 120.000 to<br>
1.000.000 g/mole.<br>
Polybutenes range in average molecular weight from about 5.000 g/mole to about<br>
30.000	g/mole.<br>
Function of vinyl polymers<br>
½nyl polymeric and copolymeric type elastomers provide tack resistance, vary the<br>
chew characteristics of gums made from these bases having vinyl polymers and offer<br>
hydrophilic properties beneficial to sensory perception of the final gums.<br>
½nyl polymers<br>
For vinyl copolymeric types, the amount of vinyl laurate, vinyl stearate, or ethylene<br>
present in the vinyl laurate/vinyl acetate (VL/VA), vinyl stearate/vinyl acetate<br><br>
(VS/VA), or ethylene/vinyl acetate (EVA) copolymers respectively typically ranges<br>
from about 10 to about 60% by weight of the copolymer. Average molecular weights<br>
of these polymers may range from about 2.000 g/mole to about 100.000 g/mole.<br>
The vinyl polymers such as polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate have an average<br>
molecular weight from about 8.000 g/mole to about 65.000 g/mole.<br>
Polymers of vinyl acetate (PVAc) are branched in nature. The degree of branching is<br>
increased when vinyl acetate monomers are copolymerized with vinyl laurate, vinyl<br>
stearate, ethylene and the like. The higher the degree of branching, the higher the<br>
compatibility when blended or compounded with normal-alkanic and iso-alkanic<br>
type waxes.<br>
It is e.g. common in the industry to combine in a gum base a synthetic elastomer<br>
having a high molecular weight and a low-molecular-weight elastomer. Presently<br>
preferred combinations of synthetic elastomers include, but are not limited to,<br>
polyisobutylene and styrene-butadiene, polyisobutylene and polyisoprene,<br>
polyisobutylene and isobutylene-iso<br>
prene copolymer (butyl rubber) and a combination of polyisobutylene, styrene-<br>
butadiene copolymer and isobutylene isoprene copolymer, and all of the above<br>
individual synthetic polymers in admixture with polyvinyl acetate, vinyl acetate-<br>
vinyl laurate copolymers, respectively and mixtures thereof.<br>
Function of elastomer plasticizers<br>
Elastomer plasticizers vary the firmness of the gum base. Their specificity on<br>
elastomer inter-molecular chain breaking (plasticizing) along with their varying<br>
softening points cause varying degrees of finished gum firmness and compatibility<br>
when used in base. This may be important when one wants to provide more<br>
elastomeric chain exposure to the alkanic chains of the waxes.<br>
Elastomer plasticizers<br><br>
Elastomer plasticizers suitable for use in the present invention include natural rosin<br>
esters often referred to as ester gums. Such elastomer plasticizers known in the art<br>
are methyl, glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of rosins and modified rosins, such as<br>
hydrogenated, dimerized and polymerized rosins. Examples are glycerol ester of<br>
wood and gum rosin, glycerol ester of partially hydrogenated wood and gum rosin,<br>
glycerol ester of polymerized wood and gum rosin, glycerol ester of partially<br>
dimerized wood and gum rosin, glycerol ester of tall oil rosin, pentaerythritol ester of<br>
wood and gum rosin, pentaerythritol esters of partially and fully hydrogenated wood<br>
and gum rosin, methyl esters of wood and gum rosins and partially and fully<br>
hydrogenated methyl esters of wood and gum rosin.<br>
The synthetic elastomer plasticizers include terpene resins derived from alpha-<br>
pinene, beta-pinene and/or d-limonene.<br>
The elastomer plasticizers used may be of one type or of combinations of more than<br>
one type. Typically, the ratios of one to the other are dependent on each respective<br>
softening point, the effect on flavour release, and the respective degree of tack they<br>
case to the gum. Ball and ring softening points of the rosin ester types described<br>
above may range from about 45.degree. C. to about 120.degree. C. Softening points<br>
of the terpene resins may range from about 60.degree. C. to about BO.degree. C.<br>
Function of waxes<br>
Petroleum waxes aid in the curing of the finished gum made from the gum base as<br>
well as improve shelf life and texture. Wax crystal size influences the release of<br>
flavour. Those waxes high in iso-alkanes have a smaller crystal size than those waxes<br>
high in normal-alkanes, especially those with normal-alkanes of carbon numbers less<br>
than 30. The smaller crystal size allows slower release of flavour since there is more<br>
hindrance of the flavour's escape from this wax versus a wax having larger crystal<br>
sizes. The compatibility of gum bases made using normal-alkanic waxes is less when<br>
compared to gum bases made with iso-alkanic waxes.<br><br>
Waxes<br>
Petroleum wax (refined paraffin and microcrystalline wax) and paraffin wax are<br>
composed of mainly straight-chained normal-alkanes and branched iso-alkanes. The<br>
ratio of normal-alkanes to iso-alkanes varies.<br>
The normal-alkanic waxes typically have carbon chain lengths &gt;C-18 but the lengths<br>
are not predominantly longer than C-30. The branched and ring structures are located<br>
near the end of the chain for those waxes that are predominantly normal-alkanic. The<br>
viscosity of normal-alkanic waxes is 
number average molecular weight is 
The iso-alkanic waxes typically have carbon lengths that are predominantly greater<br>
than C-30. The branched chains and ring structures are located randomly along the<br>
carbon chain in those waxes that are predominantly iso-alkanic. The viscosity of iso-<br>
alkanic waxes is greater than 10 mm2/s (at 100 °C) and the combined number<br>
average	molecular	weight	is	&gt;600	g/mole.<br>
Synthetic waxes are produced by means that are atypical for petroleum wax<br>
production and are thus not considered petroleum wax. The synthetic waxes may<br>
include waxes containing branched alkanes and copolymerized with monomers such<br>
as, but not limited to propylene, polyethylene, and Fischer Tropsch type waxes.<br>
Polyethylene wax is a synthetic wax containing alkane units of varying lengths<br>
having attached thereto ethylene monomers.<br>
The natural waxes may include rice bran wax, bees' wax, carnauba wax or candelilla<br>
wax.<br>
The waxes may be used alone or in any combination.<br><br>
Function of softeners<br>
The selection of softeners has an influence on the softness of the base. Softeners<br>
modify the texture, cause the hydrophobic and hydrophilic components of the base to<br>
be miscible, and may further plasticize the synthetic elastomers of the gum base. The<br>
emulsifiers, which belongs to the group of softeners, provide the gum base with<br>
water-binding properties, which confer to the gum base a pleasant smooth surface<br>
and reduce its adhesive properties.<br>
Softeners<br>
Softeners suitable for use in the gum base include triglycerides of non-hydrogenated,<br>
partially hydrogenated and fully hydrogenated vegetable oils and tallow, cocoa butter<br>
and degreased cocoa powder and in addition to these the emulsifiers.<br>
The group of triglycerides include cottonseed, palm, palm kernel, coconut, safflower,<br>
rapeseed, sunflower, tallow, soybean, cocoa butter, medium-chained triglycerides<br>
and	the	like.<br>
The caproic, caprylic, capric, myristic, lauric and palmitic fatty acids of the<br>
triglycerides tend to plasticize the synthetic elastomers more than triglycerides<br>
containing	predominantly	stearic	fatty	acid<br>
To the group of emulsifiers belong the monoglycerides, diglycerides, acetylated<br>
mono and diglycerides, distilled mono- and diglycerides, glycerol monostearate,<br>
propylene glycol monostearate, Na-, K-, Mg- and Ca-stearates, glycerol triacetate,<br>
fatty acid monoglycerides (e.g. stearic, palmitic, oleic and linoleic acids), lactic acid<br>
esters and acetic acid esters of mono- and diglycerides, sugar esters of edible fatty<br>
acids also referred to as sucrose polyesters including those disclosed in WO<br>
00/25598, lecithin and hydroxylated lecithin, most of these may contain triglyceride<br>
levels less than 2% by weight from their manufacturing processing,<br><br>
The softeners including the emulsifiers may be used alone or at least two or more in<br>
combination.<br>
Function	of	fillers<br>
Fillers used in gum base modify the texture of the gum base and aid in processing.<br>
Particle size has an effect on cohesiveness, density and processing characteristics of<br>
the gum base and its compounding. The smaller the particle size, the more dense and<br>
cohesive the final gum base. Also, by selecting fillers based on their particle size<br>
distribution, initial mass compounding may be varied, thus allowing alteration of the<br>
compounding characteristics of the initial mass during gum base processing and<br>
ultimately the final chew characteristics of gums made from these gum bases.<br>
Fillers<br>
Fillers suitable for use in the gum base include magnesium and calcium carbonate,<br>
ground limestone and silicate types such as magnesium and aluminum silicate, kaolin<br>
and clay, aluminium oxide, silicium oxide, talc, as well as titanium oxide, mono-, di-<br>
and tricalcium phosphate, sodium sulphate, cellulose polymers such as ethyl, methyl<br>
and	wood	or	mixtures	thereof.<br>
Talc filler may be used in the gum base and gum of the present invention that may<br>
come in contact with or employ acid flavours or provide an acidic environment<br>
needed to prevent degradation of an artificial sweetener by reacting with calcium<br>
carbonate type fillers. Mean particle size for calcium carbonate and talc fillers<br>
typically range from about 0.1 micron to about 15 microns.<br>
The fillers may also include natural organic fibres such as fruit vegetable fibres,<br>
grain, rice, cellulose and combinations thereof.<br>
Function and list of other optional ingredients such as antioxidants, colourants and<br>
flavourants:<br><br>
Antioxidants prolong shelf life and storage of gum base, finished gum or their<br>
respective components including fats and flavour oils.<br>
Antioxidants suitable for use in gum base include butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA),<br>
butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), betacarotenes, tocopherols, acidulants such as<br>
½tamin C, propyl gallate, other synthetic and natural types or mixtures thereof.<br>
Flavourants and colourants impart characteristics or remove or mask undesired<br>
characteristics. Colourants may typically include FD&amp;C type lakes, plant extracts,<br>
fruit and vegetable extracts and titanium dioxide flavourants may typically include<br>
cocoa powder, heat-modified amino acids and other vegetable extracts.<br>
Preparation of gum bases<br>
Gum bases are typically prepared by adding an amount of the elastomer, elastomer<br>
plasticizer and filler, and on occasion a vinyl polymer, to a heated (10°C - 120°C)<br>
sigma blade mixer with a front to rear speed ratio of from about 1.2:1 to about 2:1,<br>
the higher ratio typically being used for gum base which requires more rigorous<br>
compounding of its elastomers.<br>
The initial amounts of ingredients comprising the initial mass may be determined by<br>
the working capacity of the mixing kettle in order to attain a proper consistency and<br>
by the degree of compounding desired to break down the elastomer and increase<br>
chain branching. The higher the level of filler at the start or selection of a filler<br>
having a certain particle size distribution, the higher the degree of compounding and<br>
thus more of the elastomeric chain crosslinking are broken, causing more branching<br>
of the elastomer thus lower viscosity gum bases and thus softer final gum base and<br>
gum made from such a gum base. The longer the time of compounding, the use of<br>
lower molecular weight or softening point gum base ingredients, the lower the<br>
viscosity and firmness of the final gum base.<br>
Compounding typically begins to be effective once the ingredients have massed<br><br>
together. Anywhere from 15 minutes to 90 minutes may be the length of<br>
compounding time.<br>
Preferably, the time of compounding is from 20 minutes to about 60 minutes. The<br>
amount of added elastomer plasticizer depends on the level of elastomer and filler<br>
present. If too much elastomer plasticizer is added, the initial mass becomes over<br>
plasticized and not homogeneous.<br>
After the initial ingredients have massed homogeneously and compounded for the<br>
time desired, the balance of the gum base ingredients are added in a sequential<br>
manner until a completely homogeneous molten mass is attained. Typically, any<br>
remainder of elastomer, elastomer plasticizer, vinyl polymer and filler, are added<br>
within 60 minutes after the initial compounding time. The filler and the elastomer<br>
plasticizer would typically be individually weighed and added in portions during this<br>
time. The optional waxes and the softeners are typically added after the elastomer<br>
and elastomer plasticizers and during the next 60 minutes. Then the mass is allowed<br>
to become homogeneous before dumping.<br>
Typical gum base processing times may vary from about one to about three hours,<br>
preferably from about 1 1/2 to 2 1/2 hours, depending on the formulation. The final<br>
mass temperature when dumped may be between 70°C. and 130°C. and preferably<br>
between 100°C. and 120°C. The completed molten mass is emptied from the mixing<br>
kettle into coated or lined pans, extruded or cast into any desirable shape and allowed<br>
to cool and solidify. Those skilled in the art will recognize that many variations of<br>
the above described procedure may be followed.<br>
The water-soluble portion of chewing gum.<br>
The water-soluble portion of the chewing gum may comprise softeners, sweeteners,<br>
high intensity sweeteners, flavoring agents, acidulants, fillers, antioxidants, and other<br><br>
components that provide desired attributes. Softeners typically constitute from about<br>
0.5 percent to about 25.0 percent by weight of the chewing gum. The bulking agents<br>
generally comprise from about 5 percent to about 90 percent, preferably from about<br>
20 percent to about 80 percent of the chewing gum. High-intensity sweeteners in<br>
gum typically may range from about 0.01 to 0.50 weight percent. A flavoring agent<br>
may be present in the chewing gum in an amount within the range of from about 0.1<br>
to about 30.0 weight percent of the gum.<br>
Softeners<br>
Softeners are added to the chewing gum in order to optimize the chewability and<br>
mouth feel of the gum.<br>
Softeners contemplated for use in the gum include glycerin, modified lecithin and<br>
combinations thereof. Further aqueous sweetener solutions such as those containing<br>
sorbitol, hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, corn syrup and combinations thereof may<br>
be used as softeners.<br>
Sweeteners<br>
Bulk sweeteners include both sugar and sugarless components. Bulk sweeteners may<br>
typically constitute 5 to about 95% by weight of the chewing gum, more typically<br>
constitute 20 to about 80% by weight, and more commonly, 30 to 60% by weight of<br>
the gum.<br>
The sweeteners often fill the role of bulking agents in the gum. The sweeteners are<br>
improving juiciness of the gum and are supporting the flavourprofile of the gum.<br>
Sugar sweeteners generally include, but are not limited to saccharide-containing<br>
components commonly known in the chewing gum art, such as sucrose, dextrose,<br>
maltose, saccharose, lactose, sorbose, dextrin, trehalose, D-tagatose, dried invert<br>
sugar, fructose, levulose, galactose, corn syrup solids, glucose syrup, hydrogenated<br>
glucose syrup, and the like, alone or in combination.<br>
The sweetener can be used in combination with sugarless sweeteners.<br><br>
Generally, sugarless sweeteners include components with sweetening characteristics<br>
but which are devoid of the commonly known sugars and comprise, but are not<br>
limited to, sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol, hydrogenated starch<br>
hydrolyzates, maltitol, isomalt, erythritol, lactitol and the like, alone or in<br>
combination.<br>
Depending on the particular sweetness release profile and shelf-life stability needed,<br>
bulk sweeteners can also be used in combination high-intensity sweeteners.<br>
Preferred high intensity sweeteners include, but are not limited to sucralose, aspar-<br>
tame, salts of acesulfame, alitame, saccharin and its salts, cyclamic acid and its salts,<br>
cyclamate, glycyrrhizin, dihydrochalcones, thaumatin, monellin, sterioside and the<br>
like, alone or in combination. In order to provide longer lasting sweetness and<br>
flavour perception, it may be desirable to encapsulate or otherwise control the release<br>
of at least a portion of the artificial sweetener. Such techniques as wet granulation,<br>
wax granulation, spray drying, spray chilling, fluid bed coating, coascervation,<br>
encapsulation in yeast cells and fibre extrusion may be used to achieve the desired<br>
release characteristics. The encapsulation can also be performed in another material<br>
such as resin.<br>
Usage level of the artificial sweetener will vary greatly and will depend on such<br>
factors as potency of the sweetener, rate of release, desired sweetness of the product,<br>
level and type of flavour used and cost considerations. Thus, the active level of<br>
artificial sweetener may vary from 0.02 to about 8%. When carriers used for<br>
encapsulation are included, the usage level of the encapsulated sweetener will be<br>
proportionally higher.<br>
Combinations of sugar and/or sugarless sweeteners may be used in chewing gum.<br>
Additionally, the softener may also provide additional sweetness, if such softeners as<br>
aqueous sugar or alditol are used.<br><br>
If a low calorie gum is desired, a low caloric bulking agent can be used. Examples of<br>
low caloric bulking agents include polydextrose; Raftilose, Raftilin; Fructooligo-<br>
saccharides (NutraFlora@); Palatinose oligosaccharide; Guar Gum Hydrolysate<br>
(SunFiber@); or indigestible dextrin (Fibersol). However, other low calorie-bulking<br>
agents can be used.<br>
Flavour<br>
The chewing gum centres provided herein may contain aroma agents and flavouring<br>
agents including natural and synthetic flavourings e.g. in the form of natural<br>
vegetable components, essential oils, essences, extracts, powders, including acids<br>
and other substances capable of affecting the taste profile. Examples of liquid and<br>
powdered flavourings include coconut, coffee, chocolate, vanilla, grape fruit,<br>
orange, lime, menthol, liquorice, caramel aroma, honey aroma, peanut, walnut,<br>
cashew, hazelnut, almonds, pineapple, strawberry, raspberry, tropical fruits, cherries,<br>
cinnamon, peppermint, wintergreen, spearmint, eucalyptus, and mint, fruit essence<br>
such as from apple, pear, peach, strawberry, apricot, raspberry, cherry, pineapple,<br>
and plum essence. The essential oils include peppermint, spearmint, menthol,<br>
eucalyptus, clove oil, bay oil, anise, thyme, cedar leaf oil, nutmeg, and oils of the<br>
fruits (e.g. lemon, bergamot and orange) as mentioned above.<br>
The chewing gum flavour may be a natural flavouring agent, which is freeze-dried,<br>
preferably in the form of a powder, slices or pieces of combinations thereof. The<br>
particle size may be less than 3 mm, preferably less than 2 mm, more preferably less<br>
than 1 mm, calculated as the longest dimension of the particle. The natural flavouring<br>
agent may be in a form where the particle size is from about 3 µm to 2 mm, such as<br>
from 4 µm to 1 mm. Preferred natural flavouring agents include seeds from a fruit<br>
e.g. from strawberry, blackberry and raspberry.<br>
Various synthetic flavours, such as mixed fruit flavours may also be used in the<br>
present chewing gum centres. The aroma agent may be used in quantities smaller<br>
than those conventionally used. The aroma agents and/or flavours may be used in an<br><br>
amount of from 0.01 to about 30% by weight (preferably from 0.01 to about 15% by<br>
weight) of the final product depending on the desired intensity of the aroma and/or<br>
flavour used. Preferably, the content of aroma/flavour is in the range of from 0.2 to<br>
3% by weight of the total composition.<br>
Acidulants<br>
Also various acids are used typically in combination with fruit flavours, such as<br>
adipinic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, malic acid, acetic<br>
acid, lactic acid, phosphoric acid and glutaric acid or salts thereof. They are typically<br>
added in amounts of 0.01 to 10%.<br>
Fillers<br>
Fillers suitable for use in the chewing gum include magnesium and calcium<br>
carbonate, ground limestone and silicate types such as magnesium and aluminum<br>
silicate, kaolin and clay, aluminium oxide, silicium oxide, talc, as well as titanium<br>
oxide, mono-, di- and tricalcium phosphate, sodium sulphate, cellulose polymers<br>
such as ethyl, methyl and wood or mixtures thereof.<br>

Preparation of chewing gum<br>
In general, chewing gum may be manufactured by sequentially adding the various<br>
chewing gum ingredients to a commercially available mixer known in the art. After<br>
the initial ingredients have been thoroughly mixed, the gum mass is discharged from<br>
the mixer and shaped into the desired form such as by rolling into sheets and cutting<br>
into sticks, extruded into chunks or casting into pellets.<br>
Generally, the ingredients may be mixed by first melting the gum base and adding it<br>
to the running mixer. Colors, active agents and/or emulsifiers may also be added at<br>
this time. A softener such as glycerin may also be added at this time, along with<br>
syrup and a portion of the bulking agent/sweetener. Further portions of the bulking<br>
agent/sweetener may then be added to the mixer. A flavoring agent is typically added<br>
with the final portion of the bulking agent/sweetener. A high-intensity sweetener is<br>
preferably added after the final portion of bulking agent and flavor have been added.<br>
The entire mixing procedure typically takes from five to fifteen minutes, but longer<br>
mixing times may sometimes be required. Those skilled in the art will recognize that<br><br>
many variations of the above described procedure may be followed. Including the<br>
one-step method described in US patent application 2004/0115305 hereby<br>
incorporated as reference.<br>
Structure of the chewing gum<br>
According to the invention, the form and shape of the nicotine chewing gum may be<br>
any suitable and user friendly structure. Accordingly, the gum centre or gum may be<br>
e.g. in a form selected from a pellet, a cushion-shaped pellet, a stick, a tablet, a<br>
chunk, a pastille, a pill, a ball and a sphere. Chewing gums are formed by extrusion,<br>
compression, rolling and may be centre filled with liquids and/or solids in any form.<br>
Coating<br>
In accordance with the invention, the chewing gum element may comprise about 0.1<br>
to about 75% by weight of an outer coating applied onto the chewing gum centre.<br>
Thus, suitable coating types include hard coatings, film coatings and soft coatings of<br>
any composition including those currently used in coating of chewing gum,<br>
pharmaceutical products and confectioneries and any combination thereof.<br>
One presently preferred outer coating type is a hard coating, which term is used in<br>
the conventional meaning of that term including sugar coatings and sugar-free (or<br>
sugarless) coatings and combinations thereof. The object of hard coating is to obtain<br>
a sweet, crunchy layer, which is appreciated by the consumer and it may moreover<br>
protect the gum centres for various reasons. In a typical process of providing the<br>
chewing gum centres with a protective sugar coating, the gum centres are<br>
successively treated in suitable coating equipment with aqueous solutions of<br>
crystallisable sugar such as sucrose or dextrose, which, depending on the stage of<br>
coating reached, may contain other functional ingredients, e.g. fillers, binding agents,<br>
colours, etc. In the present context, the sugar coating may contain further functional<br><br>
or active compounds including flavour compounds and/or pharmaceutically active<br>
compounds.<br>
In the production of chewing gum it may, however, be preferred to replace the<br>
cariogenic sugar compounds in the coating by other, preferably crystallisable,<br>
sweetening compounds that do not have a cariogenic effect. In the art such coating<br>
are generally referred to as sugarless or sugar-free coatings. Presently preferred non-<br>
cariogenic hard coating substances include polyols, e.g. sorbitol, maltitol, mannitol,<br>
xylitol, erythritol, lactitol, isomalt and tagatose which are obtained by industrial<br>
methods by hydrogenation of D-glucose, maltose, fructose or levulose, xylose,<br>
erythrose, lactose, isomaltulose and D-galactose, respectively and trehalose, which is<br>
a non-cariogene mono- di-saccharide.<br>
In a typical hard coating process as it will be described in details in the following, a<br>
suspension containing crystallisable sugar and/or polyol is applied onto the gum<br>
centres and the water it contains is evaporated off by blowing with air. This cycle<br>
must be repeated several times, typically 3 to 80 times, in order to reach the swelling<br>
required. The term "swelling" refers to the increase in weight or thickness of the<br>
products, as considered at the end of the coating operation by comparison with the<br>
beginning, and in relation to the final weight or thickness of the coated products. In<br>
accordance with the present invention, the coating layer constitutes about 0,1 to<br>
about 75% by weight of the finished chewing gum element, such as about 10 to<br>
about 60% by weight, including about 15 to about 50% by weight.<br>
In further useful embodiments the outer coating of the chewing gum element of the<br>
invention is an element that is subjected to a film coating process and which<br>
therefore comprises one or more film-forming polymeric agents and optionally one<br>
or more auxiliary compounds, e.g. plasticizers, pigments and opacifiers. A film<br>
coating is a thin polymer-based coating applied to a chewing gum centre of any of<br>
the above forms. The thickness of such a coating is usually between 20 and 100 µm.<br><br>
Generally, the film coating is obtained by passing the chewing gum centres through a<br>
spray zone with atomised droplets of the coating materials in a suitable aqueous or<br>
organic solvent vehicle, after which the material adhering to the gum centres is dried<br>
before the next portion of coating is received. This cycle is repeated until the coating<br>
is complete.<br>
In the present context, suitable film-coating polymers include edible cellulose<br>
derivatives such as cellulose ethers including methylcellulose (MC), hydroxyethyl<br>
cellulose (HEC), hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose<br>
(HPMC). Other useful film-coating agents are acrylic polymers and copolymers, e.g.<br>
methylacrylate aminoester copolymer or mixtures of cellulose derivatives and acrylic<br>
polymers. A particular group of film-coating polymers, also referred to as functional<br>
polymers are polymers that, in addition to its film-forming characteristics, confer a<br>
modified release performance with respect to active components of the chewing gum<br>
formulation. Such release modifying polymers include methylacrylate ester<br>
copolymers, ethylcellulose (EC) and enteric polymers designed to resist the acidic<br>
stomach environment, yet dissolve readily in the duodenum. The latter group of<br>
polymers include: cellulose acetate phtalate (CAP), polyvinyl acetate phtalate<br>
(PVAP), shellac, metacrylic acid copolymers, cellulose acetate trimellitate (CAT)<br>
and HPMC. It will be appreciated that the outer film coating according to the present<br>
invention may comprise any combination of the above film-coating polymers.<br>
In other embodiments, the film coating layer of the chewing gum elements according<br>
to the invention comprises a plasticizing agent having the capacity to alter the<br>
physical properties of a polymer to render it more useful in performing its function as<br>
a film-forming material. In general, the effect of plasticizers will be to make the<br>
polymer softer and more pliable as the plasticizer molecules interpose themselves<br>
between the individual polymer strands thus breaking down polymer-polymer<br>
interactions. Most plasticizers used in film coating are either amorphous or have very<br>
little crystallinity. In the present context, suitable plasticizers include polyols such as<br><br>
glycerol, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, e.g. the 200-6000 grades hereof,<br>
organic esters such as phtalate esters, dibutyl sebacate, citrate esters and thiacetin,<br>
oils/glycerides including castor oil, acetylated monoglycerides and fractionated<br>
coconut oil.<br>
The choice of film-forming polymer(s) and plasticizing agent(s) for the outer coating<br>
of the present chewing gum element is made with due consideration for achieving the<br>
best possible barrier properties of the coating in respect of dissolution and diffusion<br>
across the film of moisture and gasses.<br>
The film coating of the chewing gum elements may also contain one or more colou-<br>
rants or opacifiers. In addition to providing a desired colour hue, such agents may re-<br>
flect light or form a barrier against moisture and gasses. Suitable colourants/pacifiers<br>
include organic dyes and their lakes, inorganic colouring agents, e.g. titanium oxide<br>
and natural colours such as e.g. P-carotene or chlorophyll.<br>
Additionally, film coatings may contain one or several auxiliary substances such as<br>
flavours and waxes or saccharide compounds such as polydextrose, dextrins<br>
including maltodextrin, lactose, modified starch, a protein such as gelatine or zein, a<br>
vegetable gum and any combination thereof.<br>
In one specific embodiment the chewing gum centre is in the form of a stick which is<br>
provided on at least one side with an edible film comprising layer of a coating of a<br>
film forming agent, e.g. a cellulose derivative, a modified starch, shallac, gum arabic,<br>
a dextrin, gelatine, zein, a vegetable gum, a synthetic polymer and any combination<br>
thereof, and a wax such as beeswax, carnauba wax, microcrystalline wax, paraffin<br>
wax and combinations thereof.<br>
The following examples are given for illustration, but not limitation of the invention.<br><br><br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of gum base.<br>
Gum bases are prepared, which comprises the following ingredients:<br>
Elastomers<br>
Elastomer plasticizers<br>
"Waxes<br>
Softeners<br><br>
Fillers<br>
Antioxidants<br>
The detailed formulations are given in table 1. It should be emphasized that several<br>
other gum base compositions may be applied within the scope of the invention.<br>
The elastomers and fillers are added to the mixing kettle provided with mixing means<br>
like e.g. horizontally placed Z-shaped arms. The kettle had been preheated for 15<br>
minutes to a temperature of about 120 deg. C. The rubber is broken into small pieces<br>
and softened with mechanical action in the kettle.<br>
The elastomer plasticizer is slowly added to the elastomer until the mixture becomes<br>
homogeneous. The remaining elastomer plasticizer is then added to the kettle and<br>
mixed for 10-20 minutes. The softening ingredients are added and mixed for 20-40<br>
minutes until the whole mixture becomes homogeneous.<br>
The mixture is then discharged into a pan and allowed to cool to room temperature<br>
from the discharge temperature of 120 deg. C.<br>

Example 5<br>
The release of the active agent in Example 2-4 and two commercial products are<br>
determined in vitro. The test in vitro is carried out on a chewing machine (European<br>
Pharmacopeia 4 th. ed. 2.9.25 Chewing gum medicated, drug release from) by<br>
chewing one piece of chewing gum at specified time intervals 0,1,2, 3,5,7.5,10,20<br>
and 30 minutes in a phosphate buffer with a pH of 7.4.<br>
The results are illustrated and explained below<br>
Fig. 1 illustrates a release profile of two prior art nicotine chewing gums as a<br>
function of time.<br><br>
It is noted that the very initial and the intermediate release, is relatively low over the<br>
period corresponding to a typical smoking time i.e. 5-8 minutes. The release rate<br>
from 0-1 minutes is even lower than the remaining intermediate release.<br>
The two prior art nicotine chewing gums PA1 and PA2 are both intended for use by<br>
means of a chew process over approximately thirty minutes. In other words, the<br>
intended build-up of nicotine in the blood of the user is a process running over quite<br>
a long while.<br>
It is noted that both nicotine chewing gums appear to be releasing relatively linear.<br>
Fig. 2 illustrates the release of fig. 1 in specific intervals of the above-mentioned<br>
chewing gums PA1 and PA2 over the initial chewing period of 0 to 5 minutes in<br>
intervals of 30 seconds. In other words a sort of differential illustration of the release<br>
focusing on the release in the individual sub-periods of the illustrated release time.<br>
As illustrated, the evaluated sub-periods are 0-½ minute, ½-1 minute, 1 minute -1½<br>
minute, 1½ minute -2 minute, 2minute - 2½minute, 2½minute - 3minute, 3 minute -<br>
3½ minute, 3½ -4 minutes, 4-4½ minutes and 4½ - 5 minutes.<br>
It is noted that the very initial release and intermediate release, is increasing<br>
relatively slow over a relatively long period compared to a typical smoking time in<br>
spite of the fact that the release showed in fig. 1 appeared to be relatively constant.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the initial and intermediate release of three chewing gums Il, 12 and<br>
I3 applicable according to the invention. The release, or transfer from the chewing<br>
gum to the exterior of the chewing gum, is illustrated in the same way as the prior art<br>
chewing gums of fig. 2.<br>
The illustrated chewing gums benefit of an initial advantageous release over the<br>
complete critical period of the first five to eight minutes of smoking. It is thus noted<br><br>
that the release is never below 2% per sub period, i.e. 30 seconds. In other words,<br>
when the chewing gum is applied according to the invention, a constant amount of<br>
nicotine may be available for transfer into the blood via the mucosa membrane.<br>
It is also noted that the chewing I3 features a very significant release in the first few<br>
minutes of the chewing process, thereby facilitating a fast relief due to the fact that a<br>
high osmotic pressure on the mucosa membrane may be maintained from the very<br>
beginning.<br>
It is further noted that the chewing gum I1 and 12 features a very constant release<br>
over the first 5 minutes of chewing. This may be regarded very advantageous when<br>
complying with e.g. the taste problem related to nicotine in the mouth.<br>
Fig. 3 illustrates the resulting release obtained when a nicotine chewing gum is<br>
chewed in a chewing machine.<br>
According to the invention, a nicotine chewing gum having the properties as<br>
illustrated in fig. 3 may be applied according to the following process steps.<br>
A nicotine chewing gum, e.g. I1, I2 or I3 is provided to a user having a human body.<br>
The human user may then chew the chosen nicotine chewing gum and a fast relief<br>
with respect to craving may be obtained by the transfer of nicotine from the nicotine<br>
chewing gum to the blood of the user via the mucosa membrane.<br>
As the applied nicotine chewing gum features a transfer of nicotine from the chewing<br>
gum above a chosen threshold transfer rate in the period of about ½ minute to about<br>
2½ minutes from initiation of said chewing process a constant osmotic pressure may<br>
be maintained on the mucosa membrane during a relatively long intermediate period<br>
of the chewing process. In this way, a fast relief has been according to an<br>
embodiment of the invention.<br><br>
It is noted that none of the chewing gums applied according to the invention features<br>
a transfers of nicotine from the chewing gum below 2mg of nicotine per 30 second. It<br>
is also noted that e.g. 12 features a maintained dose of never below 4mg per 30<br>
second.<br>
Fig. 4 illustrates the initial and intermediate release from the above discussed<br>
chewing gums PA1, PA2, I1, 12 and 13 over the initial approximately 8 minutes of<br>
the chewing process. It is noted that the quickest releaser tends to flatten out after<br>
about 4- 5 minutes of chewing.<br><br>
