FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This  invention  relates  to a  process  for producing rayon grade pulp from coir bit fibres.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
During  pulping,  cellulosic fibres  must  be<br>
liberated from their encasing lignin matrix so that they can associate with one another, yielding strength in the<br>
final   product.    This  polymer  separation   can   be accomplished by removal of lignin as in chemical  pulps,<br>
or by maintaining the lignin as in high yield mechanical pulps.  During the bleaching process, natural  colouring<br>
materials are removed along with a  part of  lignin resulting in brightening of the pulp.<br>
Paper grade pulp was hitherto produced  from wood  chips.  A disadvantage associated with  the  known<br>
process was that of shortage of wood chips.  Yet another disadvantage  is that of the high costs of  wood  chips,<br>
which substantially contributed to the end cost of pulp. Yet  another  disadvantage is that the wood  chips  were<br>
converted  into wood shavings and then subjected to  the step of  cooking  so as to cause an  exposure  of  the<br>
fibres.   The  cooked chips were then subjected  to  the step of digestion to produce pulp.<br><br>
During the processing of coir materials, the coir bit fibres are generated in huge quantities. These fibres having length between 1/4" to 1/2" do not find use in the coir processing units and are thus regarded as waste. Furthermore, it is considered that only 257. of coir is used in product application, the remainder constituting a waste. Stil1 further, when the fibre is extracted from the husk during the step of mechanical extraction, the fibres tend to break« and also thereby constituting a waste.<br>
As described wastes consisting of coir bit fibres did not have any useful application except as a fuel.<br>
OBJECTS OF THIS INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a process for producing rayon grade pulp from coir bit fibres-<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for producing rayon grade pulp from coir bit wastes but which has a quality as good as that prepared f rom wood chips.<br>
Stil1 another object of this invention is to propose a process for producing rayon grade pulp from coir bit wastes which avoids the step of cooking as known with respect to wood chips.<br><br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a process for producing rayon grade pulp from coir bit wastes and whereby substantial quantities of coir bit waste can be employed.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for producing rayon grade pulp from coir bit fibres which comprises in the steps of:<br>
a)	digestion of coir bit waste in the presence of a fungus and a nutrient.<br>
b)	Purifying the digested pulp by soaking it in sodium hydroxide to produce cellulose.<br>
A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the step of digestion is carried out in the presence of white rot fungus and a nutrient such as urea.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment of this invention, the coir bit waste is subjected to the step of digestion in the presence of sodium hydroxide having a concentration of 4 to 16%. Further, the ratio of the coir bit waste to liquor is 1:20, and preferably 1:14 to 1:17. The digestion is carried out for a period of 6 to 24 hours. The digested coir bit waste is neutralized with hydrochloric acid, as a neutral pH is required and again washed to flush out any residual acid or alkali. The step of digestion may be carried out in the presence of pressure of 2 to 4 kg/cm2.<br>
In accordance with another embodiment of this invention the coir bit waste is subjected to the step of digestion in the presence of sodium hydroxide solution under pressure and at a temperature of 100-150°C. The<br><br>
coir bit waste is subjected to the step of digestion in the presence of sodium hydroxide having a  concentration<br>
of  1 to 16%  Further, the ratio of the coir bit  waste<br>
to  liquor  is 1:20%, and preferably l:14  to  l:l7.  The<br>
digestion is carried out in the presence of pressure of<br>
2<br>
2	to 4 kg/cm .<br>
In accordance  with yet another embodiment  of<br>
this invention, the step of digestion is carried out in the presence of white rot fungus and a nutrient such as<br>
urea. The step of digestion is carried out in the presence of white rot fungus comprising  Pleurotus sozar<br>
caju or Phanerochaete chrysosporium used singularly or in combination.   The ratio of fungus culture to coir is<br>
1 to 5 kg of culture to every 1 metric ton of coir. The digestion  is carried out for a period of 7 to 35  days.<br>
3	to 6 kg of urea is present to every metric of coir.<br>
The  digested  pulp  is  soaked  in   sodium hydroxide solution having a concentration of 16 to  20%, which purifies the pulp to produce  cellulose.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
WE CLAIM;<br>
1.	A process for producing rayon grade pulp from coir bit fibres<br>
which comprises in the steps of:<br>
a)	digestion of coir bit waste in the presence of a fungus and a nutrient.<br>

5.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the digestion is carried out for a period 6 to 24 hours.<br>
6.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the step of digestion is carried out in the presence of sodium hydroxide solution under pressure and at a temperature of 100-150°C.<br>
7.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein the step of digestion is carried out in the presence of white rot fungus and a nutrient such as urea.<br><br>
8.	A process as claimed in claim 7 wherein the step of digestion is carried out in the presence of white rot fungus comprising Pleurotus sozar caju or phanerochaete chrysosporium used singularly or in combination.<br>
