COMPOSITION  FOR  LURING AND  CONTROLLING ANTHROPODS   COMPRISING  SYNTHETIC  SILICIC ACID  AND   PROTEIN AUTOLYSATE<br>
The invention relates to a composition, composed of protein autolysates in combination with silicates, for luring and controlling animal pests.<br>
The use of luring substances represents a possibility for controlling animal pests without, for example, the entire area having to be treated comprehensively with the substances which are suitable for achieving the control- These methods, which are termed bait methods, also avoid undesirable effects on useful, pest-destroying animals, while the entry into the environment of the substances which are suitable for achieving the control is less and, in many cases, bait methods are also more economical than the comprehensive treatment of a whole area.<br>
Suitable substances for luring animal pests, preferably arthropods, can be obtained from a wide variety of sources. In addition to substances having a specific effect, such as sexual pheromones, substances having a broad effect are also used for luring and controlling arthropods. These substances include chemical compounds, such as trimethylamine or ammonia (WO-A-95/14379), commercially available foodstuffs, such as fish, fishmeal and molasses, and also sugar, honey and milk powder (GB-A-1044663) and their degradation products, such as heat-fermented fruit juice (JP-A-52139728) or protein hydrolysate of plant and animal origin, for, example composed of fermented fruits, composed of hen egg white (DE-A-19749683), composed of skimmed milk and yeasts (CA-A-1185172) and vegetables (US-A-4160824).<br>
Silicates, such as naturally occurring kieselguhr, also termed diatomaceous earth or infusorial earth, or synthetically prepared silicic acids, are mainly used in bait methods as a carrier material for the luring substances and other active compounds or active substances. They are consequently only formulation aids and do not themselves, therefore, constitute any component which is active in controlling anima<br><br>
pests. However, it is also known that small quantities of mineral dusts of a particular granule size, such as diatomaceous earth, can themselves possess an effect on insects. The reason for this is, on the one hand, the sharp edges of the mineral particles, which lead to mechanical damage to the insect cuticular tissue, in particular to the heavily used joint parts (CA-A-1185172, US-A-5186935); and, on the other hand, silicic acids having a hygroscopic action, for example, such as, for example, colloidal silicon dioxides, are able to extract the life-sustaining water from the insects, thereby desiccating them (DE-A-19749683).<br>
US-A-3846557 (DE OS 2326799) refers to the problems associated with liquid<br>
compositions for luring insects: "In addition, the known liquid mixtures are not<br>
particularly effective since, after a short period of time after having been sprayed on<br>
surfaces, they no longer attract the insects. While some dry baits have been<br>
developed, these baits are not luring baits, i.e. they do not attract the insects but are,<br>
instead, contact baits. Contact baits clearly do have to come into contact with the<br>
insect. Following the contact, the insect remains and feeds. These baits are not<br>
suitable for midges, blowflies, fruitflies and the like because these types of fly are<br>
widely distributed over a given area and do not generally land and investigate the<br>
substrates". The cited patent publication therefore describes a method in which<br>
synanthropic flies are lured by proteins which are decomposing and fermenting. The<br>
"luring bait" which was used was obtained from a mixture of dried, pulverized whole	i<br>
eggs and water, which had been fermented by bacteria and microorganisms derived from the air. After the process of decomposition had come to an end, the resulting slurry was freeze-dried and then tested, after 1% of the insecticide dimethyl-2,2-dichlorophenyl phosphate (DDVP) had been added, on midges in the field. In this connection, it was found that the sought-after luring effect, due to the development of gases from the luring bait, is dependent on the moisture content of the given substrate or on the given moisture content of the environment, with a high moisture content leading to a correspondingly greater efficacy. In addition to referring to the freeze-drying described in the examples, the cited patent publication also refers to the use of adsorption materials, such as diatomaceous earth, for removing the excess water from the fermented egg/water slurry.<br><br>
The object of the present invention was to provide a composition for luring and controlling animal pests, which offers the advantages of liquid compositions, such as good metering ability and distribution properties, and, at the same time, avoids the above-described problems, such as the period of effective luring after application being too short. In addition, the efficacy of the luring and control should also, as far as possible, be independent of the moisture content of the substrate or of the moisture content of the environment.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that compositions comprising protein autolysates derived from yeast and synthetic silicia acids have a high efficacy for luring and controlling animal pests.<br>
In one aspect the invention provides a composition which comprises:<br>
a)	one or more protein autolysates derived from yeasts, and<br>
b)	one or more synthetic silicic acids.<br>
The ratio of the components a) and b) can vary within wide limits and is in general in range from 10 000:1 to 1:10 000, in particular from 1000:1 to 1:1000% by weight.<br>
Where appropriate, the composition according to the invention comprises active chemical compounds as a further component c). The active compounds include, for example, active compounds directed against animal pests (such as insecticides, acaricides and sterilizing agents), other luring substances and aromatic principles, and also preservatives, such as fungicides, which can either be used as a direct addition, for example as a final formulation (syn. coformulation), or as a subsequent addition, for example as something which is subsequently admixed at the site of use (syn. tank mix).<br><br>
Therefore, in a further aspect the invention provides a pesticidal composition which comprises:<br>
a)	one or more protein autolysates derived from yeasts,<br>
b)	one or more synthetic silicic acids,<br>
c)	one or more active compounds directed against animal pests.<br>
Due to the good flow characteristics of the pulverulent composition according to the invention, it is possible to achieve a uniform distribution and consequently superior metering ability, like for liquid compositions, while avoiding the above mentioned problems of such compositions. In particular, it is possible to reduce, to a very large extent, the dependence on the moisture content of the substrate or the environment, as the working examples demonstrate. In addition the efficacy of the protein autolysates in the composition according to the invention is increased, by way of a synergism, compared to protein autolysates being used on their own.<br>
The invention furthermore provides a method for luring and controlling animal pests, with the animal pests being brought into contact with a composition according to the invention, for example by the composition according to the invention being applied onto, or in the vicinity of, the plants which have been infested by the animal pests, or their seeds, and in the substrates, areas or spaces which they have colonized.<br>
The invention also provides the use of a composition according to the invention for luring and controlling animal pests, for example in agriculture, in horticulture, in forests, in animal husbandry, in animal breeding, in the protection of stored products, in the protection of materials, in the hygiene sector and in the domestic field.<br>
The composition according to the invention makes it possible to prepare a finished formulation in a simplified manner, which formulation can, for example after having been stirred into the appropriate quantity of water, be used immediately at the site of employment.<br><br>
The invention also provides to a method for preparing a composition according to the invention, with component a) and component b), and optionally component c), being mixed with each other. This takes place either directly or in a mixture with solvents and/or formulation aids.<br>
As used herein, the term "protein autolysate" encompasses all the products which are formed during the course of an autolysis (syn. self-decomposition process; as the totality of all the breakdown processes in dead organisms as a result of hydrolytic enzymes, such as proteases, which are still active).<br>
The term "synthetic silicic acids" encompasses all the silicic acids (syn. silicates) which are obtained synthetically.<br>
The term "control" encompasses both the direct effect on the animal pests, as ensues, for example, as a result of inactivation and/or destruction, within the sense of combating, and the indirect effect, as ensues, for example, as a result of the animal pest being lured away from the area colonized by it, and/or removed from this area by being caught.<br>
The term "animal pests" encompasses both the animal organisms which bring about damage, directly or indirectly, and all animal organisms which are generally described as being a nuisance due to their unwanted appearance.<br>
The term "active compounds directed against animal pests" encompasses all compounds whose effect on animal pests can be either direct, for example as a result of inactivation and/or destruction within the sense of combating, or indirect, for example as a result of disorientation and/or population-reducing effects.<br>
Protein autolysates according to the invention are preferably those included in the groups of protein autolysates derived from yeasts of the genera Saccharomyces and Schizosaccharomyces, particularly preferably protein autolysates derived from yeasts of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces bayanus,<br><br>
Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, Saccharomyces chevalieri, Saccharomyces chodati and Saccharomyces diastaticus, very particularly preferably protein autolysates derived from yeasts of the species Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces carlsbergensis, such as liquid ®Pinnacle protein autolysate (obtained from brewery yeast residues after fermenting with papain enzyme, EC 3.4.4.10; Mauri Yeast Australia Ltd., Toowoomba, Queensland, Australia) and/or pulverulent ®SPA400 protein autolysate (obtained from brewery yeast residues; Halcyon Proteins Pty Ltd., Melbourne, Australia).<br>
Synthetic silicic acids are preferably those included in the groups of pyrogenic silicic acids and precipitated silicic acids (definition and preparation: Rompp, Chemie Lexikon [Enclopedia of Chemistry], 9th Edition, Georg Thieme Verlag Stuttgart, New York, 1995, pp. 2236-2237 - Paperback edition),<br>
particularly preferably pyrogenic silicic acids, such as ®AreosiI 200 (CAS Reg. No. 69012-64-2; Degusa AG, Frankfurt/M., Germany) and precipitated silicic acids, such as ®Sipemat 50 S (CAS Reg. No. 7631-86-9; Degusa AG, Frankfurt/M., Germany), both included under No. 2315454 of the European Inventory of Existing Commercial Chemical Substances (EINECS, syn. European list of existing substances), very particularly preferably pyrogenic silicic acids, such as ®Areosil 200.<br>
The composition according to the invention is suitable, while being well tolerated by	,<br>
plants and having favorable homeotherm toxicity, for luring and controlling animal pests, in particular arthropods, such as insects and arachnids, but also helminths such as nematodes which are injurious to plants. The pests are found in agriculture, in horticulture, in forests, in animal husbandry and animal breeding, and in the protection of stored products and the protection of materials, in the hygiene sector and in the domestic field.

The active compounds directed against animal pests are preferably derived from the<br>
group of the phosphoric esters, carbamates, carboxylic esters (syn. pyrethroids),<br>
amidines, tin compounds, insecticidal phenylpyrazoles, neonicotinoids (syn.<br>
nitromethylenes), spinosyns (syn. macrocyclic lactones, syn. macrolides) and<br>

macrocyclic lactones, syn. macrolides);<br>
and are very particularly preferably the insecticides dimethoate, malathion, ethiprole,<br>
fipronil, imidacloprid, thiacloprid and spinosad.<br>
The abovementioned active compounds directed against animal pests are known active compounds and most of them are described in The e-Pesticide Manual', CD ROM Version 2.0, 2000-2001 (ISBN: 1-901396-23-1), based on "The Pesticide Manual", 12th Ed., The British Crop Protection Council, Farnham, UK, 2000.<br>
A pesticidal composition according to the invention generally comprises from 0.0001 to 95 % by weight of one or more active compounds.<br>
In order to produce the composition according to the invention, components a) and b), and optionally component c), either as a pure substance and/or already being present in a mixture for use, and, where appropriate, other additives, are added together and brought into a suitable usage form (formulation).<br>
The composition according to the invention can be formulated in a variety of ways depending on how the biological and/or physicochemical parameters predetermine it. Examples of formulation possibilities which come into consideration are:<br><br>
dusts (DP), granules in the form of microgranules, spray granules, coated granules and adsorption granules, water-dispersible granules (WG), wettable powders (WP), aqueous solutions (SL), emulsions, sprayable solutions, suspoemulsions (SE), seed-dressing products, ULV formulations, microcapsules, waxes, pastes or gels.<br>
The types of formulation for the composition according to the invention are preferably dusts, granules, paste formulations and gel formulations, particularly preferably paste formulations and gel formulations, very particularly preferably gel formulations.<br>
These individual formulation types are known in principle and are described, for example, in: Winnacker-Kuchler, "Chemische Technologie" [Chemical Technology], Volume 7, C. Hanser Verlag Munich, 4th EdM 1986; van Falkenberg, "Pesticides Formulations", Marcel Dekker N.Y., 2nd Ed. 1972-73; K. Martens, "Spray Drying Handbook", 3rd Ed. 1979, G. Goodwin Ltd. London.<br>
These sources, and the literature cited therein, are hereby expressly incorporated by reference; by being cited, they are to be regarded as being a constituent part of the description.<br>
Dusts are obtained, for example, by grinding the composition according to the invention with finely dispersed solid materials, for example talc or natural clays, such as kaolin, bentonite, pyrophyllite or diatomaceous earth. Granules of the composition according to the invention can be prepared either by applying it onto adsorptive, granulated inert material or by applying it, by means of adhesives, for example polyvinyl alcohol, sodium polyacrylate or else mineral oils, onto the surface of carrier materials such as sand or kaolinites, or of granulated inert material. The composition according to the invention can also be granulated in the manner which is customary for preparing fertilizer granules, if desired as a mixture with fertilizers.<br>
Paste formulations and gel formulations are obtained, for example, by mixing the composition according to the invention with structure-imparting substances, such as cellulose, heteropolysaccharides (e.g. ®Rhodigel Easy, Rhodia GmbH, Frankfurt/M.,<br><br>
Germany) or argillaceous earths, with wetting agents, such as naphthalene-suifonate condensate (e.g. ®Morwet D425, Witco, Geneva, Switzerland), and with liquids, such as water.<br>
Wettable powders are preparations which are uniformly dispersible in water and which also comprise, aside from the composition according to the invention, wetting agents, for example polyoxyethylated alkylphenols, polyoxyethylated fatty alcohols, alkylsulfonates or alkylphenoisulfonates and dispersants, for example sodium lignosulfonate or sodium 2,2,-dinaphthylmethane-6,6,-disuIfonate, in addition to a diluent or inert material. However, in addition to this use, wettable powders can also be used like the above-described dusts.<br>
Dusty formulations usually comprise from 0.5 to 95% by weight of the composition according to the invention, with the remainder up to 100% by weight being composed of customary formulation constituents. In the case of granules, the content of the composition according to the invention partially depends on the physical state in which this composition is present and on which granulation aids, fillers, etc., are used. In the case of pastes and gels, the content of the composition according to the invention can amount to from about 0.001 to 95% by weight. In wettable powders, the concentration of the composition according to the invention is, for example, from about 0.5 to 95% by weight; in the case of sprayable solutions it is from about 0.5 to 50% by weight.<br>
in addition, said formulations comprise, where appropriate, the adhesives, wetting agents, dispersants, emuls'rfiers, penetration agents, solvents, fillers or carrier substances which are in each case customary.<br>
The necessary formulation aids, such as inert materials, surfactants, solvents and other additives, are likewise known and described, for example, in: Watkins, "Handbook of Insecticide Dust Diluents and Carriers", 2nd Ed., Darland Books, Caldwell N.J.; H. v. Olphen, "Introduction to Clay Colloid Chemistry", 2nd Ed., J. Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y.; Marsden, "Solvents Guide", 2nd Ed., Interscience, N.Y. 1950;<br><br>

Customary defoamers are based, for example, on tributyl phosphate or silicone, such as dialkylpolysiloxanes; examples of customary antifreeze agents are propylene glycol and glycerol; hygroscopic compounds which are employed are, for example, ®Aqua-Sorb and ®Stock-0-Sorb (water-binding gels from horticultural practice for protecting roots from drying out).<br>
The content of one or more additional solvents and formulation aids is from 0.001 to 90% by weight, preferably from 0.01 to 75% by weight, particularly preferably from 0.1 to 60% by weight.<br>
For use, the concentrates which are present in commercially available form, predominantly as a formulation, are either employed undiluted or, where appropriate, employed after having been diluted in a customary manner, either with water and/or another inert material, as is used, for example, in the formulation, in each case in conformity with the intended use.<br>
On the basis of these formulations, it is also possible to produce combinations containing fertilizers and/or growth regulators, for example in the form of a finished formulation (syn. coformulation) or as a subsequent addition (syn. tank mix).<br>
The content of the above-described active compounds in the formulated form of the composition according to the invention can, for example, be in a range from<br><br>
0.00000001 up to 99% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.00001 and 90% by weight<br>

B       Biological examples<br>
Description of the method<br>
Preparation: Seven days prior to the experiments, in each case 200 ready-to-hatch pupae of the Mediterranean fruitfly Ceratitis capitata (syn. orangefly, syn. peachfly) were used, per experiment part, in a cage having a volume of 52.5 liters. The pupae, and the flies which subsequently hatched from them, were kept in a climatic chamber at 25°C, 16 hours of light/day and 65% rel. humidity and fed twice daily with a 5% by weight sugar solution, applied to filter paper, until the end of the experiment.<br><br>
Implementation of the experiment: per experiment part, in each case 3 ml of the ready-to-use gel (see preparation and formulation examples) were dabbed onto a plastic plate, directly in the middle of a 5 cm diameter circle. The plastic plate was subsequently placed in the spatial center of the cage.<br>
Assessment:<br>
a)	for attractivity - after the composition according to the invention, which was formulated as a gel, had been introduced, the number of flies in the 5 cm diameter circle was counted every 10 minutes over a period of 2 hours. The mean of this determination was subsequently calculated as a percentage of all the flies which had hatched and were still living at the beginning of the experiment (% attractivity).<br>
b)	for mortality - 24 or 48 hours after the composition according to the invention, which was formulated as a gel, had been introduced, the total number of dead flies was determined and calculated as a percentage of all the flies which had hatched and which were still living at the beginning of the experiment (% mortality).<br><br>

The two experiments depicted in examples 1 and 2 showed clearly that the composition according to the invention containing synthetic silicic acids, such as precipitated silicic acids (®Sipemat 50 S) and pyrogenic silicic acids (®Aerosil 200), exerts a higher degree of luring power (attractivity) than does the protein autolysate in which no synthetic silicic acid was used. By contrast, the use of natural silicates, in this case diatomaceous earth (®Diamol GM), reduced the attractivity. The mortality rate in the case of the compositions according to the invention to a large extent corresponded to those of the control. It was therefore possible to rule out any additional increase in mortality due to a direct effect of the synthetic silicic acids.<br><br>
Example 3: Comparison of the efficacy of the composition according to the invention when containing different protein autolysates in combination with an insecticide, in accordance with the above-described preparation and formulation examples.<br>

The two experiments depicted in examples 3 and 4 clearly showed that protein autolysates derived from yeasts from different origins give rise to good luring power (attractivity) in the composition according to the invention. In combination with an insecticidal substance, in this case Fipronil, the mortality of the composition according to the invention was greater than that in the case of the natural silicate (®Diamol GM), which was tested in example 4 for comparison. In addition, the experiment depicted in example 3 demonstrated that different methods for preparing and formulating the composition according to the invention lead to comparable results.<br><br><br><br><br>
