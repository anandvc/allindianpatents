				<td>[Technical Field of the Invention]<br>
This invention relates to a rear structure of a<br>
motorcycle or a tricycle.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
In the past, motorcycles and tricycles have been variably improved in their rear structures, particularly the position and fitting structure of a seat, a container box and fuel tank as shown in, for example, a "Scooter-Type Vehicle" disclosed in Japanese Utility Model Publication No. Hei 5-39038.  According to Figs. 1 and 3 of the above document, a scooter type motorcycle has at its rear section a seat 30 (the reference numeral quoted from the document as hereinafter applicable) and a container box 40 and a fuel tank 70 disposed under this seat 30. [0003]<br>
The container box 40 has a blind panel (equivalent<br>
to a tank cover) extending backward from its rear upper portion and this blind panel 60 covers the upper portion of a fuel tank 70 (equivalent to a liquid tank). A cross pipe 8 of a rear frame 5 has the front portion of a flange 71 of the fuel tank 70 and the lower portion of a stay 101 secured together thereto and the upper section of this stay 101 has a rear fitting member of the container box 40 secured together.<br>
The seat 30 is fitted to the front upper portion of the container box 40 and its rear portion locked to a seat catch unit (with such a means as a hook 103 fitted to the stay 101). [0004] [Problem to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
As a motorcycles or a tricycles is modified in style, its container box 40 and fuel tank 70 need to be modified in style, inevitably making it necessary to modify its stay 101 in style as well.<br>
Because the stay 101 and the seat catch unit are integrally structured according to the conventional technique as explained above, however, the stay 101 when modified at the time of a model change as such requires a new seat catch unit to be manufactured.  Replacing a seat<br>
catch unit complicated in structure every time a model<br>
change takes places is nothing but a source of low productivity and troublesome part management.<br>
The blind panel 60 to cover the upper portion of the fuel tank 70 requires its rear portion to be secured to a rear frame 5. When securing members are provided to it, the blind panel inevitably has a great number of fitting members which make its fitting troublesome. [0005]<br>
In view of the above described problem, the present invention has its objects to (1) facilitate the production of seat catch units and their management irrespective of a model change and (2) fit the rear portion of a tank cover and the rear portion of a liquid tank easily in a simple structure with less constituent members required. [0006] [Means for Solving the Problem]<br>
With the foregoing objects in view, the present invention provides a rear structure of a motorcycle or a tricycle comprising a container box provided under the front part of a seat, a liquid tank provided under the rear part of the seat, a vehicle frame extending under the above-described two constituent members, a seat catch unit set between the two constituent members and a support<br>
member having its lower end linked to the vehicle frame<br>
between the two constituent members, characterized in that the support member is extended upward, the lower part of the support member is secured with the front part of the liquid tank, and the upper part of the seat catch unit and the rear part of the container box are secured together with the upper portion of the support member.<br>
Because the seat catch unit is structured separately from the support member according to the present invention, only the support member needs to be modified at the time of a model change, allowing the seat catch unit to be used for both the existing and new models. [0007]<br>
A rear structure of a motorcycle or a tricycle as defined in Claim 2 is characterized in that there is provided at the rear part of the container box a tank cover covering the upper surface of the liquid tank, a portal bracket is set upright at the rear portion of the vehicle frame, the rear portion of the liquid tank and the lower portion of the portal bracket are secured together with the vehicle frame and the rear portion of the tank cover is fitted to the upper portion of the portal bracket.<br>
In this structure, the portal bracket standing astride the liquid tank to support the rear portion of the<br>
tank cover is secured together with the vehicle frame and<br>
the rear portion of the liquid, tank, so that a common<br>
fitting means can be used to fit both a securing member of<br>
the tank cover and the liquid tank.<br>
[00081<br>
A rear structure of a motorcycle or a tricycle as defined in Claim 3 is characterized in that the portal bracket is provided with a fitting member to hold a rear carrier.<br>
t<br>
Because of its particular shape, the portal<br>
bracket provided in this structure to support the*tank<br>
cover allows the rear carrier to be fixed in an adequate<br>
position. 	<br>
Accordingly, there is provided, a rear structure of a motorcycle or a tricycle comprising a container box provided under the front part of a seat, a liquid tank provided under the rear part of the seat, a vehicle frame extending under said two constituent members, a seat catch<br>
*<br>
unit set between said two constituent members and a support member having its lower end linked to the vehicle frame between said two constituent members, characterized in that said support member is extended upward, the lower part of the support member is secured together with the front part of the liquid tank, and the upper part of the seat catch unit and the rear part of the container box are secured together with the upper portion of the support member.<br>

At the rear portions of the side covers 17, there is provided a rear fender 31 covering the upper portion of the rear wheel 22. [0012]<br>
Fig. 2 is a side view of the scooter-type motorcycle according to the present invention, showing its rear portion. The power unit 41 is composed of a two-cycle forcedly air-cooled engine 42 and a non-step power transmission 43 to transmit an output of the engine 42 to the rear wheel 22.  This non-step power transmission 43 is linked with the rear wheel 22.  Reference numeral 44 is an air cleaner for the engine. [0013]<br>
A rear suspension of the motorcycle 1 is a swing arm system which suspends the power unit 41 at the rear portion of the rear frame 7 by means of a rear cushion (a damper) 47 with the power unit 41 serving as a swing arm.<br>
In other words, the rear suspension is structured to hold the front portion of the power unit 41 to the front portions of the intermediate frame members 7b through a linking mechanism 48 in a vertically movable manner and fit the rear portion of the power unit 41 to the rear portions of the intermediate frame members 7b through the rear cushion 47. [0014]<br>
The rear portion of the motorcycle 1 is structured with the container box 51 disposed under the front portion of the seat 23 and the fuel tank 52 (equivalent to a liquid tank) disposed under the rear portion of the seat 23 and the container box 51 and the fuel tank 52 secured to the intermediate frame members 7b. The container box 51 is a box with its upper section left open and with its flange 51a holding the seat 23 fitted to its upper front section with a hinge 53.  The container box can be used to accommodate, for instance, a helmet 54.<br>
Reference numerals 56 and 57 are a battery and a main stand, respectively. [0015]<br>
Fig. 3 is a partially enlarged view of the motorcycle according to the present invention, showing its primary section.  There are shown a support member 70 and a<br>
seat catch unit 80 disposed in a gap between the container box 51 and the fuel tank 52.<br>
In the neighborhood of the above-described gap, the rear frame 7 has a cross frame member 7d crossed over between the right and left intermediate frame members 7b and 7b (only one of them shown in this drawing). This cross frame member 7d has a bracket 61 welded to its upper section.<br>
From the rear upper portion of the container box 51, an almost flat tank cover 63 is extended backward. This tank cover 63 covers the upper portion of the fuel tank 52.  The tank cover 63 has a hole 63a allowing an fuel supply opening lid 52a of the fuel tank 52 to pass therethrough. [0016]<br>
The above support member 70 and the seat catch unit 80 are assembled with a front fitting member 52b of the fuel tank 52 and the lower portion (lower flange 72) of the support member 70 secured together to the upper portion of the bracket 61 with a bolt B and the upper portion of the seat catch unit 80 (an upper flange 81b) and a rear fitting member of the container box 51 (equivalent to the front fitting member 63b of the tank cover 63) secured together to the upper portion of the support member 70 (an upper<br>
flange 73).  The seat catch unit 80 serves to lock the seat 23.<br>
The support member 70 and the seat catch unit 80 establishing the above securing structure rise with a desired space S therebetween in which the primary section of the seat catch unit is disposed.  Therefore, the primary section of the seat catch unit 80 is protected by the support member 70 and the seat catch unit 80 itself surrounding its front and rear sides. [0017]<br>
Under the seat 23, there is provided a lock pin 91 hanging therefrom. This lock pin 91 is a round rod bent in the form of a letter "U".<br>
At its rear portion, the rear frame 7 has a rear fitting member 52c of the fuel tank 52 and a rear fitting member 63c of the tank cover 63 secured thereto.  This structure will be explained in detail along with Fig. 4. [0018]<br>
Fig. 4 is a cross-sectional view of the motorcycle according to the present invention, taken along Line 4-4 of Fig. 3.  The rear frame 7 has brackets 65 and 65 welded to the upper sections of the right and left intermediate frame members 7b and 7b. To these right and left brackets 65 and 65, the rear fitting member 52c of the fuel tank 52 and the<br>
right and left ends 66a and 66a of a portal bracket 66 are secured together with a bolt B. The portal bracket 66 has the rear fitting member 63c of the tank cover 63 fitted to the horizontally central position of its upper section 66b with a bolt B. [0019]<br>
The portal bracket 66 includes on its right and left sides stepped securing members 66c and 66c to have a rear carrier 26 fitted thereto.  The rear carrier 26 presents an approximately "U" shape in its plain.  It is a pipe passing over the two sides of the portal bracket 66 and fixed to the securing members 66c and 66c of the portal bracket 66 through support members 67 and 67 with bolts. Because of its particular shape, the portal bracket 66 to support the tank cover 63 allows the rear carrier 26 to be fixed in an adequate position. [0020]<br>
As explained above, the motorcycle 1 is composed of, as shown in Fig. 3, the container box 51 provided under the front part of the seat 23, the fuel tank 52 (liquid tank) provided under the rear part of the seat 23, the vehicle frame 2 extending under the above two constituent members 51 and 52, the seat catch unit 80 set between the two constituent members 51 and 52 and the support member 70<br>
having its lower flange (section) 72 linked to the vehicle frame between and extending upward to have the front fitting member (front portion) 52b of the fuel tank 52 secured together to the lower flange 72 of the support member 70 and the upper flange (upper portion) 81b of the seat catch unit 80 and the front fitting member 63b (rear portion of the container box 51) of the tank cover 63 secured together to the upper flange (upper portion) 73 of the support member 70.<br>
The motorcycle is also provided with the tank cover 63 covering the upper surface of the fuel tank at the rear portion of the container box 51 as shown in Fig. 3 and the portal bracket 66 set upright at the rear portion of the vehicle frame 2 as shown in Fig. 4 and has the rear fitting member (rear portion) 52c of the fuel tank 52 and the end (lower portion) 66a of the portal bracket 66 secured together to the vehicle frame 2 and the rear fitting section (rear portion) 63c of the tank cover 63 fitted to the upper section 66b of the portal bracket 66.<br>
Furthermore, the motorcycle 1 has the portal bracket 66 provided with the securing member 66c to have the rear carrier 26 fitted thereto. [0021]<br>
Fig. 5 is a front view of the seat catch unit<br>
according to the present invention, showing the position of the seat catch unit 80 disposed in front of the support member 70 (facing side of the drawing).<br>
The seat catch unit 80 is composed of a frame section 81 indicated with imaginary lines and its primary section set on the back of the frame section 81 (comprising a hook 82 and an engaging member 83 set on the back in a horizontally movable manner and a tension spring 84 suspended between the hook 82 and the engaging member 83). [0022]<br>
The hook 82 locks a lock pin 91.  The engaging member 83 engages with the hook 82 to keep the hook 82 and the lock pin 91 in their locked position.  The tension spring 84 energizes the hook 82 and the engaging member 83 to stay engaged with each other.<br>
The engaging member 83 and a lock 86 fitted to the intermediate frame member 7b are linked with a linking wire 87.  When the lock 86 is unlocked, this linking wire causes the engaging member 83 to rotate.<br>
CL indicates the center of the vehicle frame. [0023]<br>
Fig. 6 is a perspective view of the support member and the seat catch unit according to the present invention. The support member 70 and the seat catch unit 80 are<br>
separately structured.<br>
The support member 70 is a channel member presenting a U-shape cross section composed of a flat wall portion 71, a lower flange 72 and an upper flange 73 with its front opening. The support member 70 is provided with a V-shape recess 74 at the approximate vertical center of its top to allow the lock pin 91 to move unblocked in its vertical direction.<br>
The frame section 81 of the seat catch unit 80 is composed of a flat wall portion 81a, a backward-bent upper flange 81b and a securing member 81c to mount a cover tube 87a for the linking wire 87.  To allow the lock pin 91 to move unblocked in its vertical direction, the frame section 81 is provided with a U-shaped recess 81d at the approximate vertical center of its top. [0024]<br>
With the upper flange 81b of the seat catch unit 80 laid over the upper flange 73 of the support member 70 as explained above, there can be created a gap between the wall portion 71 and the wall portion 81a as desired. Disposed in this gap, the primary section of the seat catch unit 80 (namely, the hook 82, the engaging member 83 and the tension spring 84) is protected by the wall portions 71 and 81a on its front and rear sides.<br>
[0025]<br>
Next, it will be described along with Fig. 7 how the seat catch unit 80 structured as explained above works. Fig. 7 (a) and (b) show movements of the seat catch unit according to the present invention.<br>
When the lock pin 91 is pressed down in its unlocked position as shown in (a), the lock pin 91 presses down an arm portion 82a of the hook 82, causing the hook 82 to rotate in a clockwise direction in the drawing.  Thus, the lock pin 91 is locked in a locking bay 82b of the hook 82, entering its locked position as shown in (b). [0026]<br>
When the lock 86 shown in Fig. 5 is unlocked, the linking wire 87 is pulled (as shown by an arrow 1) in the locked position as shown in (b), causing the engaging member 83 to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction (as shown by an arrow 2).  Thus, the engaging member 83 releases itself from engagement with the arm portion 82a, pulls the extension spring 84 (as shown by an arrow 3) and causes the hook 82 to rotate in a counter-clockwise direction (as shown by an arrow 4). As a result, the lock pin 91 is freed from its locked position in the locking bay 82b. [0027]<br>
Now, it will be described how the seat catch unit 80 according to the present invention can be fitted to different types of a motorcycle.<br>
Fig. 8 (a) to (c) show how the seat catch unit 80 according to the present invention can be fitted.<br>
As explained above, a motorcycle when changed in shape needs the container box 51 and the fuel tank 52 to be modified in shape, inevitably with the support member 70 required to change in shape as shown in (a) to (c). More specifically, the supper member 70 in (a) is hie height, the support member 70 in (b) is mediur, _ neight and the support member 70 in (c) is low in he.<br>
Because the support member 70 and the s t catch unit 80 are structured separately from each other, the support member 70 can be used commonly in cases ^ ^" (a) to (c) when modified as requi change. [0028]<br>
In the above, the present invention has been described along with its embodiment in a motorcycle. However, it can be employed in a tricycle as well.<br>
A liquid tank is not limited to the fuel tank 52 but can be anything of that kind like an oil tank. [0029]<br><br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
With its structure as explained above, the present invention has the following effects.<br>
A rear structure of a motorcycle or a tricycle as defined in Claim 1 has a support member with its lower portion linked to a vehicle frame between a container box and a liquid tank and extended upward to have the front portion of the liquid tank secured together with the lower portion of the support member and the upper portion of a seat catch unit and the rear portion of the container box secured together with the upper portion of the support member, characterized in that the seat catch unit is structured separately from the support member, so that the seat catch unit can be commonly used for different models of a motorcycle only with its shape modified to match a model change.  Thus, the present invention can facilitate the production of seat catch units and their management with less components required. [0030]<br>
A rear structure of a motorcycle or a tricycle as defined in Claim 2 has a tank cover covering the upper surface of a liquid tank at the rear portion of a container box and a portal bracket set upright at the rear portion of a vehicle frame to have the rear portion of the liquid tank<br>
and the lower portion of the portal bracket secured together with the vehicle frame and the rear portion of the tank cover fitted to the upper portion of the portal bracket, with the portal bracket astride the liquid tank to support the rear portion of the tank cover secured together with the vehicle frame and the rear portion of the liquid tank, so that a common fitting means can be used to fit both a securing member of the tank cover and the fuel tank and the rear portion of the tank cover and the rear portion of the liquid tank can be secured easily in a simple structure with less constituent members required. [0031]<br>
A rear structure of a motorcycle or a tricycle as defined in Claim 3 has a portal bracket provided with a fitting member to hold a rear carrier.  Because of its particular shape, the portal bracket provided in this structure to support the tank cover allows the rear carrier to be fixed in an adequate position. This brings about designing flexibility.<br>
