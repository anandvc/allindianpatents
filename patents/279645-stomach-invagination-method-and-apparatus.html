DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0015]	The following description of certain examples of the invention should not be<br>
used to limit the scope of the present invention. Other examples, features, aspects, embodiments, and advantages of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from the following description, which is by way of<br>
 <br>
END5872USNP-0540932<br>
illustration, one of the best modes contemplated for carrying out the invention. As will be realized, the invention is capable of other different and obvious aspects, all without departing from the invention. Accordingly, the drawings and descriptions should be regarded as illustrative in nature and not restrictive.<br>
[0016]	As shown in FIG. 1, an exemplary invagination system (10) comprises a<br>
suction device (20) and an endoseopic adhesive applier (40). In the present example, suction device (20) is disposed within a stomach (100); while adhesive applier (40) is positioned outside stomach (100). As shown in FIGS. 1-3. and as will be described in greater detail below, invagination system (10) is operable to create several invaginated portions (102) of stomach (100). The creation of such invaginated portions (102) may ultimatel\ reduce the volume of stomach (100).<br>
[0017]	The suction device (20) comprises a head (22) coupled with a flexible lube<br>
(24). As shown head (22) has an annular, outwardly flared rim (26). and is in fluid communication with flexible tube (24). Rim (26) is configured to sealingly engage an inner stomach surface (104). As shown in FIG. 2. with rim (26) engaged with inner stomach surface (104). a vacuum ma\ be provided through flexible tube (24) to draw a portion ol' stomach (100) into head (22). thereby creating an invaginated portion (102) of stomach (100). It will be appreciated that the illustrated configuration for head (22) is merely exemplary, and that head (22) may alternatively comprise a varich of alternative features and configurations.<br>
[0018]	As shown in FIG. 1, adhesive applier (40) ol' the present example is<br>
configured to fit within a working channel of an endoscope (50). Adhesive applier (40) in this example is a conventional endoseopic adhesive applier. though any suitable alternative may be used. Adhesive applier (40) is operable to dispense an adhesive (60) on an outer surface (106) (e.g.. serosal surface) of stomach (100). Adhesive (60) may comprise a cyanoacrylaic, an isocyanate, or any other suitable substance.<br>
 <br>
END5872USNP-0540932 - 4-<br>
[0019]	As shown in FIG. 5, in one exemplary use, a matrix cloth (70) may be applied<br>
to outer surface (106) of stomach (100) before adhesive (60) is applied. Matrix cloth (70) may comprise a plurality of cells [72.). such is in honeycomb configuration by way of example only, f.ach cell (72) may comprise an activator substance that is configured to react with adhesive (60). In particular, adhesive (60) may be configured such that it is not operable to satisfactorily adhere tissue unless placed in contact with the activator substance. Alternatively, matrix cloth (70) may lack an activator substance. By way ol example only, to the extent a matrix cloth (70) (70) may comprise polyester or any other suitable material or materials.<br>
[0020]	In another embodiment, matrix cloth (70) contains adhesive (60). such that a<br>
separate applier (40) is not needed to apply adhesive (60). For instance, cells (72) may contain adhesive (60). Alternatively, matrix cloth (70) material may itself be adhesive, with no adhesive (60) being provided within cells (72). In this variation, portions of matrix cloth (70) may adhere to outer surface (106) and/or to other portions of matrix cloth (70). This may permit contact between adjacent outer surface (106) portions through voids provided by empty cells (72). which may result in fusion of such adjacent outer surface portions (106). Alternatively, matrix cloth (70) may be substituted with any suitable alternative, supplemented with other structures or substances. ov may K-omitted altogether. To the extent that a matrix cloth (70) is used, suitable methods for applying matrix cloth (70) will be apparent to those ol' ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0021]	In the present example, as shown in FIG. 2. head (22) is applied to stomach<br>
(100) opposite of applied adhesive (60) and matrix cloth (72). When suction is used via flexible tube (24) and head (22) to create invaginated portion (102) of stomach (100). adhesive (60) and matrix cloth (72) are also pulled in with invaginated portion (102). As shown in FIGS. 2 and 6. adhesive (60) is entrained in the interior portion of invaginated portion (102). It will be<br>
 <br>
END5872USNP-0540932<br>
- 5-<br>
apprcciatcd that adhesive (60) may provide sufficient adhesion to maintain the configuration of invaginatcd portion (102). In another embodiment, adhesive (60) is applied after invaginaticd portion (102) has been created, for instance, adhesive applier (40) may be pressed into the well provided in outer surface (106) by invaginatcd portion (102). Adhesive (60) may be applied until it begins excreting from within the well or until otherwise desired.<br>
[0022]	In one variation, and as shown in FIG. 3, one or more sutures (80) are applied<br>
at or near the base of each invaginatcd portion (102) to further assist the maintenance of invaginated portion (102) configurations (and/or for other purposes). Sutures (80) may also cut of blood circulation for each invaginated portion (102). resulting in the death of tissue forming each invaginatcd portion (102). Of course, any suitable alternative to sutures (80) ma\ be used. including but not limited to bands, clips, staples, etc. Alternatively, sutures (80) may be substituted, supplemented, or omitted altogether, as desired.<br>
[0023]	In one embodiment, as shown in FIG. 4 invaginated portions (102) maeventually separate from stomach (100) (e.g.. alter at least a portion of the tissue forming invaginated portions (102) necroses or dies). Such separated invaginated portions (102) may thereafter pass through the gastrointestinal tract. At sites (108) where each invaginated portion (102) was formerly located, a remaining amount of adhesive (60) may prevent an opening from forming through stomach (100). In addition, or in the alternative, scar tissue or other tissue fusion may prevent the formation of such openings. Ultimatel). in the present example, the structural integrity oi' stomach (100) will be preserved despite the separation ol' invaginaled portions (102) from their respective sites (108). It will also be appreciated that the separation oi' invaginated portions (102) may cause a reduction in acid producing surface. To the extent that imagination system (10) is used to treat obesity, such a reduction in acid producing surface may further provide a desirable malabsorbativc result. Such a malabsorbative result may compliment<br>
 <br>
END5872USNP-0540932 -6-<br>
reduction in stomach volume caused by invagination as a means lor addressing obesity.<br>
[0024]	FIGS. 7-9 depict a gripping instrument (120) that may be used as an<br>
alternative to suction device (20). As shown, gripping instrument (120) comprises a shaft (122) and a pair of gripping jaw members (124). Shaft (122) is generally llcxible, and is configured to be introduced to a patient's stomach (100) through the patient's esophagus (e.g., endoscopically. etc.). As will be described in greater detail below, shaft (122) further comprises a lumen (ik.t shown) through which a vacuum may be provided.<br>
[0025]	Gripping jaw members (124) are pivotally connected relative to shaft (122).<br>
such that jaw members (124) may be selectively provided in an open or closed positions. Each gripping jaw member (124) has a plurality oi' teeth (126). Teeth (126) are configured to grip tissue, such as inner stomach surface (104). Gripping jaw members (124) may be operable to open and close via cables (not shown). Cables in the present example extend through shaft (122) to a user input device (not shown). Of course, any suitable alternative to cables may be used to open and/or close gripping jaw members (124).<br>
[0026)	Gripping instrument (120) of the present example further comprises a vacuum<br>
port (140). Vacuum port (140) may have a configuration similar to tiiat oi head (22) on suction device (20). In the present example, vacuum port (140) has a diameter that is less than the diameter of head (22) on suction device (20). Vacuum port (140) is in fluid communication with vacuum lumen of shaft (122). Vacuum port (140) may be used to secure inner stomach surface (104) relative to gripping jaw members (124). such as before gripping jaw members (124) are used to grip inner stomach surface (104).<br>
[0027]	In use. matrix cloth (70) and adhesive (60) are applied to outer stomach<br>
surface (106). Gripping instrument (120) is positioned adjacent inner stomach surface (104). substantially opposite of matrix cloth (70) and adhesive (60).<br>
 <br>
END5872USNP-0540932 -7-<br>
With gripping jaw members (124) in an open position, vacuum is applied through vacuum port (140). securing inner stomach surface (104) relative to gripping jaw members (124). as shown in FIG. 7. Gripping jaw members (124) are then actuated to a substantially closed position while gripping inner stomach surface (104) with teeth (126). as shown in FIGS. H-9. An invaginatcd portion (202) is thereby created in stomach (100). In the present example, invaginatcd portion (202) is similar to invaginaled portion (102). except that invaginated portion (202) is generally wider in one dimension. It will therefore be appreciated that creation ol~ invaginated portion (202) ma\ result in greater reduction of stomach (100) volume than creation of invaginated portion (102). It will also be appreciated that the base oi' invaginated portion (202) may be further secured with one or more sutures, bands, clips, staples, etc.<br>
[0028]	An exemplary variation of gripping instrument (120) is shown in FIGS. 10-12.<br>
In this variation, gripping instrument (220) comprises a shaft (222) and a pair of gripping jaw members (224). Shaft (222) is generally flexible, and is configured to be introduced to a patient's stomach (100) through the patient's esophagus (e.g.. endoscopically. etc.). As will be described in greater detail below, shaft (222) further comprises a lumen (250) through which a vacuum may be provided.<br>
[0029]	Gripping jaw members (224) are pivotally connected relative to shaft (222).<br>
such that jaw members (224) may be selectively provided in an open or closed positions. Hach gripping jaw member (224) has a plurality oi' teeth (226). Teeth (226) are configured to grip tissue, such as inner stomach surface (104). Gripping jaw members (224) may be operable to open and close via cables (230). Gables (230) in the present example extend through shaft (222) to a user input device (not shown). Of course, any suitable alternative to cables (230) may be used to open and/or close gripping jaw members (224).<br>
 <br>
END5872USNP-0540932 -8-<br>
[0030]	liach gripping jaw member (224) comprises a generally spherically-shaped<br>
joint portion (228). Joint portions (228) are configured to (222) while gripping jaw members (224) are in an open position. 1-ach gripping jaw member (224) also has a cup-like configuration, which is configured to provide a vacuum chamber (240). Such vacuum chambers (240) are in fluid communication with lumen (250). such that a vacuum may be provided within vacuum chambers (240) via lumen (250). In another variation, a cover (not shown) having a plurality of apertures is provided over each vacuum chamber (240). Alternatively, any other structural variation ol' gripping jaw members (224) may be used.<br>
[0031]	While lumen (250) is depicted as generally being the interior of shaft (222). it<br>
will be appreciated that lumen (250) may alternatively be provided by a separate member (not shown) inserted through shall (^22). Other structural variations will be apparent to those of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0032]	In an exemplary use, gripping instrument (220) is used in a manner similar to<br>
the use of gripping instrument (120) described above. However, instead of suction being provided through vacuum port (140). suction is provided through vacuum chambers (240) ol' gripping jaw members (224). Such suction may be provided before and during the gripping of inner stomach surface (104) of teeth (226). and may assist teeth (226) in the gripping of inner stomach surface (104). Suction may continue to be provided as gripping jaw members (224) are brought to a closed position, whereupon an invaginated portion (202) is created.<br>
[0033]	As will be appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art. the creation oi<br>
invaginated portions (102. 202) may result in a reduction of stomach (100)<br>
volume. Such reduction in stomach (100) volume may (or may not) provide a<br>
method for treating morbid obesity in a patient, and/or may provide other<br>
results. Other suitable structural variations of suction device (20) and gripping<br>
