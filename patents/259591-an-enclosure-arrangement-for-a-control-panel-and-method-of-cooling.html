FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure relates to an enclosure arrangement for a control panel and more particularly to an enclosure arrangement having a box like structure for housing the control panel, resisting foreign bodies and substances from intruding upon components housed by the box like structure, and dissipating heat generated by the control panel disposed within the box like structure.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prior art enclosures help to protect components of electric and/or electronic systems from heat generated by such systems. Arrangements of structures such as fans, fins, and other heat sinks typically aid in cooling and provide such protection. However, these enclosures frequently allow foreign bodies and substances such as tools, dust, fingers, moisture, water jets, and splashing water to enter into the electronic systems.<br>
In most of the prior art enclosures, fluids, for example, water is used as a coolant to remove heat generated by the systems housed by the enclosures. For circulation of the fluid, separate systems are used, thereby increasing both the cost of manufacturing the entire product and the manufacturing time. In a few cases, external fans are used for cooling the systems housed by the enclosures. This design has the disadvantage of failing when the fans fail to function. Further, additional labor and time is necessary to replace the fans in case of breakdown. In addition, the design increases the cost and manufacturing time of the overall product.<br>
Another way of cooling an electronic control panel is to provide fins positioned vertically on a box. For example, U.S. Patent No.6, 948,950 (the '950 patent) describes an electrical cotuiector box which includes a case containing inner compartments. A side opening communicating with the inner compartments is provided on a side of the case. A power distribution imit is inserted into and covers the side opening of the case in a vertical orientation. A side frame is cormected to a perimeter of the power distribution unit and to the case for mounting the power distribution unit onto the case. The vertical orientation of the power distribution unit requires less horizontal space for the electrical connector<br><br>
box in a vehicle. In addition, illustration in FIGS. 1 and 2 shows PDU 12 (Power dissipation unit) is placed in a vertical position with cooling fins 22a extending outward away from the connector box to dissipate heat. Further the attachment of side frame 13 securely maintains PDU 12 within case 11 while forming a water tight seal at the contact surfaces between the two components.<br>
However, the '950 patent does not disclose the guard member; but does describe using PDU which in turn uses fins to dissipate power from internal circuit. Further, the heat sink and the casing are separate which increases the number of components, thus increasing manufacturing cost and time; In addition it also has a problem of difficulty in assembly.<br>

In one aspect of the present disclosure an enclosure arrangement for a control pane is provided. The enclosure arrangement has a box like structure with a plurality of side walls, an end wall, and a plurality of cooling fins cormected to at least a one of the side walls and the end wall. A mounting plate has an opening disposed therein. The box being disposed in the opening and connected to the mounting plate. A control panel is disposed in the box and cormected to an at least one of the box and mounting plate. A guard member having first and second spaced apart side walls, a top wall, and opposite ends, is cormected to the mounting plate and disposed about the box.<br><br>
In another aspect of the present disclosure the guard member provides for a method of coolling a control panel in an enclosure. Dissipating heat from the control panel by encasing the control panel in a box having a plurality of side walls, an end wall, and a plurality of cooling fins cormected to an at least one of the side walls and end wall, and passing cooling air flow between a guard member disposed about the box and the fins to cool the control panel.<br>
The control panel 6 is enclosed by a box 1 having plurality of side walls 3 and an end wall 2. A plurality of cooling fins 3a and 2a are cormected to the side walls 3 and the end wall 2 respectively for heat dissipation. The box 1 protects the control panel from foreign particle intrusion, such as by tools, dust, fingers, moisture, water jets and splashing water. The box 1 is of a unitary one piece construction. As shown in FIG. la, FIG. lb, and FIG. 1c, ports 5 disposed in the end wall 2 is provided for harnessing internal wires of the control panel 6 with connectors. The box 1 is being constructed by one of a forming, a casting, and a fabrication process. The side walls 3 and end wall 2 have a plurality of fins which extend in a predetermined direction to maximize heat dissipation. The fins are preferably pin-fins and are substantially parallel as shown in FIG 2a and FIG 2b. The heat generated by the control panel 6 is dissipated through the fins. The number of fins can be altered depending upon the size of the control panel 6 and the degree of cooling required. The box 1 with fins 3b, 3c, and 3d on various walls would become alternative structures.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagrammatic isometric view of the enclosure arrangement in assembled condition. The control panel 6 is sealingly cormected to the box 1 having a flange 4 using plurality of fasteners 12. A sealing member 11 is disposed between the flange 4 and the control panel 6. The box 1 the control panel 6 is mounted on to a mounting plate 8. A guard member 7 is disposed about the box 1. The guard member 7 is connected to the mounting plate 8 using fasteners.<br>
The box 1, is preferably made of a light weight aluminum, has high thermal conductivity, is easy to form, fairly easy to machine, and is corrosion resistant. However, other suitable materials can also be used as a substitute for aluminum.<br><br>
The length of the fins is preferably of about 10 mm. The width or thickness of a pin-fin is about 2 mm. A gap in-between two consecutive fins is about 5 mm. A width of the shortback is about 100 mm. A width of the longback is about 200 mm. A width of the top is about 260 mm.<br>
The alternative structures are primarily the permutations and combinations of fins on various walls of the box. Thus having fins on various walls of the box increases the heat dissipation from the control panel 6.<br>
However, the disclosure should not be considered to be limited to the aforementioned parameter values. A reasonable variation in the parameters is within the scope of instant disclosure.<br>
The environment conditions in which the entire enclosure arrangement is operational are Internal Heat Load is about 25W and maximum temperature in package of about +70'C. The enclosure arrangement is operated at high humid conditions. The box 1 seals against control panel 2 surface so as to provide water-tight environment.<br>
The method of cooling a control panel in an enclosure<br>
FIG. 2c and FIG. 3 illustrates cooling of the control panel 6. The cooling of the control panel 6 involves following steps, firstly, dissipating heat from the control panel 6 by encasing it in a box 1 having a plurality of side walls 3, an end wall 2, and a plurality of cooling fins 3a and 2a connected to an at least one of the side walls 3 and end wall 2 respectively; and secondly, passing cooling air flow between a guard member 7 disposed about the box 1 and the fins to cool the control panel 6. Here the cooling air passing through the fins 9 cools the box 1 and takes away the heat 10 from the box. This cooling of box in turn leads to dissipation of heat from the control panel 6.<br>
Therefore, according to the present disclosure, it is possible to provide the enclosure arrangement for cooling the box 1 with the heat generating control panel 6 disposed therein and the method for cooling the control panel 6, thus improving the cooling<br><br>
efficiency of the heat dissipating fin along with the protecting the control panel 6 from intrusion of foreign particles.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
Reduced costs, due to less number of components, ease of assembly, efficient cooling under harsh conditions; effective in preventing entry of foreign bodies.<br>
The disclosed enclosure arrangement finds potential application in any field where a control panel is to be protected and cooled. The disclosed enclosure arrangement finds particular applicability in generator systems, especially electric power generator system, wherein we find the EMCP control panel.<br>
The disclosed box has fins on its end wall and a side wall. The fins are preferably pin-fins. The number of fins and the faces having fins can be altered depending upon the size of control panel and the degree of cooling required. Such alterations fall within the scope of instant disclosure.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the box of the present disclosure. Other embodiments of the box will be apparent to those skilled in the art from consideration of the specification of the enclosure arrangement disclosed herein. It is intended that the specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope being indicated by the following claims and their equivalents.<br><br><br>
