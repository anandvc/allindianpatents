DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[21]     According to an embodiment of the invention, articles may be acquired, preprocessed, annotated, and then dispatched to one or more consumers. FIG. 1 depicts abstractly the flow 100 of information according to one possible embodiment of the invention. Articles may be gathered from one or more information sources 105 at one or more interfaces 108. Once acquired, an article is submitted to a preprocessing module 110, which may, e.g.* identify persons, places, things, organizations, symbols, and/or events, among other things; attach metadata to the article; and/or route the article for future processing. A preprocessed article is added to a module comprising a monitoring facility 112, and may from there be selected for use with a headlining module 114, which comprise one or more manual and/or automated tools for creating and/or editing headlines or other annotations associated with the document.<br><br>
[22]     Disposition 116 follows headlining, as the headline is dispatched to one or more consumers. The word "consumer" is used in a broad sense, and may comprise, e.g., a user, a data processing system and/or application, an information provider, an archive and/or a database, etc. Disposition may also comprise dispatching the article associated with the headline to one or more consumers, which may or may not be the same as those to which the headline is dispatched.<br>
[23]     As a consumer of a headline, an article, or both, a data processing system and/or application may itself process the received information and/or forward the information, processed or unprocessed, to one or more other consumers. One example of such processing may involve indexing one or more terms in an article and adding to results to one or more indexes of articles. In an embodiment of the invention, such processing may take place without impeding headline generation, e.g., by taking place after headlining is complete or by taking place on one or more systems in parallel with headline generation.<br>
[24]     The word "article" is used herein in a broad sense, and may comprise any document, comprising a substantial portion of text, regarding one or more specific topics. Articles may be, e.g., news stories and/or press releases, among many other kinds of documents. In connection with an embodiment of the invention, reference may be made to "releases" and/or "press releases," but it is to be understood that any and all such references are to be considered exemplary and not limiting, and that any article may be substituted for a release and/or a press release without affecting the principle of the invention.<br><br>
[25]     It will be appreciated that the modules depicted in FIG, 1 represent logical elements in an abstract description of a data processing system. In an embodiment, software implementing one or more logical elements may comprise one or more software modules and/or sub-modules. Moreover, without limiting the foregoing, functionality depicted in more than one logical element may in an embodiment be implemented in a single software module or sub-module.<br>
[26]     It will also be appreciated that additional modules may exist besides those depicted in FIG. 1, and that such modules provide functionality in addition to that provided by the depicted modules. For example, a categorization module (not pictured) may classify an article into one or more subject matter categories. Such classification may then, depending on the embodiment of the invention, be used to, e.g., direct an article to one or more specific editors to provide a headline and/or affect the selection of one or more consumers to which the headline and/or article may be dispatched.<br>
[27]     A computer network architecture 140 on which an embodiment of the invention may be implemented is depicted schematically in FIG. 2. The invention may be embodied in computer software, software components, or both, executing on one or more servers 145. A server may be connected by one or more interconnected local area networks 148 to one or more database servers 150, each of which provides access to one or more databases 152.<br>
[28]     In the architecture 140 represented by FIG. 2, communication with other sources and consumers of information is achieved using the Internet 155. Access to the Internet may optionally be through one or more firewalls, gateways, or other security arrangements 157. Other means of communication (not pictured) may also be used instead of or in addition to the Internet, such as dial-up lines, dedicated leased lines, and private wide area networks.<br><br>
[29]     In the architecture 140 represented by FIG. 2, articles are obtained through one or more information sources 160. An information source 160 may comprise, e.g., a news wire or other news service and/or a source of press releases. One or more servers 145 and/or software on one or more servers may comprise one or more interfaces that receive articles from the one or more information sources 160.<br>
[30]     The architecture 140 also comprises one or more headlining stations 160 from which an editor may interact with an embodiment of the invention. A headlining station may comprise one or more electronic display devices and/or one or more computer input devices. An embodiment may present, e.g., one or more user interface screens (not pictured) on one or more electronic display devices associated with a headlining station 160. Such a headlining station may comprise an operating environment based on a graphical windowing system, and in the presence of such a windowing system, one or more user interface screen may be displayed within a window. An embodiment may apply editor input from one or more headlining stations 160 to control a headlining module 114 (FIG. 1) as well.<br>
[31]     Preprocessing 160 an article according to an embodiment of the invention is depicted schematically in FIG. 3. Preprocessing may comprise attaching and/or otherwise associating data with an article. (Such additional data may be referred to as "metadata".) In the depicted embodiment, preprocessing begins with assigning a unique number or other identifier to the article in block 166. The time the embodiment received the article is recorded in block 168, and the source of the article is recorded in block 170.<br><br>
[32]     In block 172, a headline is extracted from the article. Article formats may vary between sources, and embodiments of the invention may therefore be configured with source- and/or format-dependent rules for extracting a headline from an article. Instead of or in addition to such configured rules, an embodiment of the invention may comprise algorithmic text analysis to extract headlines from articles.<br>
[331     An embodiment of the invention may in block 174 extract one or more symbols representing stock exchanges and/or tickers. A ticker, representing a security, may comprise and/or be associated with one or more codes indicating an exchange and/or a country. Extraction may thus comprise extracting such additional information as is available. Such an embodiment may translate any such extracted symbols to an internal or external standard for further processing and/or display.<br>
[34]     An embodiment of the invention may use some or all information extracted in block 174 to determine the market capitalization of the associated corporation in block 176. This determination may comprise retrieving the market capitalization from one or more databases and/or calculating the market capitalization from data provided by one or more exchanges. Depending on the embodiment, the market capitalization may be normalized to a selected and/or configured currency and/or may be assigned to one or more categories, e.g., small cap, mid cap, large cap, etc.<br><br>
[35]     In block 178, one or more indicators ("flags") may be set based on information extracted from and/or associated with the article. For example, a flag may be set if a specified number of analysts cover the corporation and/or if a specified number of estimates have been made for the corporation's earnings. Other examples of flags include, but are not limited to, a flag indicating that the security is included in an index, e.g. the Dow Jones Industrial Average and/or a flag indicating one or more relatively large changes in the market capitalization within a specified time. Once set, the values of such flags may affect processing of the article and/or may be presented to one or more editors.<br>
[36]     An embodiment of the invention may in block 180 classify the article based on its content and/or other data associated with the article. An article may be subjected to one or more specified queries, which may, for example, comprise boolean queries to search for terms in the article. Based on the results of query or queries, the article may classified into one or more categories, e.g., Earnings, Warnings, Permanent Watch List, etc.<br>
[37]     Preprocessing may comprise actions in addition to or instead of some or all of those described in connection with FIG. 2. For example, when one or more boolean queries have been executed on an article, one or more of any terms found may be preserved for possible future reference and/or processing. An embodiment may use a markup language such as XML and/or other means to preserve any such identified terms.<br><br>
[38]     The depiction of preprocessing in FIG. 3 and the accompanying description are purely exemplary and are not intended to be limiting in any way. It will be appreciated that the order of the elements of preprocessing may vary substantially without altering the principle of operation. It will also be appreciated that the data attached to, associated with, and/or extracted from an article through preprocessing may involve data different from and/or in addition to the data described herein, again, without altering the principle of operation.<br>
[39]     In an embodiment of the invention, the monitoring facility 112 (FIG. 1) may comprise a user interface, which itself may comprise a display such as the monitoring screen 200 depicted in FIG. 4. The monitoring screen 200 may appear in a window (not pictured) displayed on an electronic display device.<br>
[40]     The monitoring screen 200 comprises a status bar 206 that may contain information such as active news wires and/or tools specific to a given instance of a monitoring facility. In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 4, the status bar displays information that comprises: the news wires 208 that have been selected for display in the monitoring screen 200; the current mode of operation 210; the sort tool 212 currently in use; and the current system time 214. The news wires 208 may comprise one or more codes that each identify an information source 105 (FIG. 1). Pull-down menus provide access to system and/or editor settings 216 and tool sets 218.<br>
[41]     The mode of operation 210 may indicate whether the editor may access a headlining module 114 (FIG. 1) or is limited to viewing the row objects 220. The mode of operation 210 may indicate one or more other modes of operation of the monitoring facility 112 (FIG. 1). For example, in one such mode, the user interface may support one or more tools for selecting two or more row objects 220, and the mode of operation 210 may indicate which such tool is active.<br><br>
[42]     The sort tool 212 controls the order in which row objects 220 appear in the monitoring screen 200. Depending on the embodiment, a sort tool may order row objects 220 according to any one or more properties of each row object 220. For example, row objects 220 may be sorted according to their ages, either newest to oldest or oldest to newest<br>
[43]     A header bar 225 provides column headers that identify the information displayed in the row objects 220 displayed in the monitoring screen 200.<br>
[44]     The monitoring screen 200 may comprise one or more row objects 220. A row object 220 is a selectable field that collects for presentation information specific to an article.<br>
[45]     A single row object 220 is presented in FIG. 5 below a header bar 225. The row object 220 comprises one or more fields that contain information. According to the embodiment of the invention depicted in FIG. 5, such fields may for example comprise content alert flags 240, a press release and/or article number 242, a headline 244, a ticker 246, corporation data flags 248, team coverage 250, headline count 252, progress flags 254, and/or elapsed time ("Age") 256.<br>
[46]     In the depicted embodiment of the invention, the content alert flags 240 indicate the presence of user-specified terms within a given article: if a flag is set, a corresponding letter appears in this field. In the example depicted in FIG. 5, an "E" indicates the presence of terms related to corporate earnings. An "M" is associated with mergers and acquisitions, a "J" is associated with job cuts, an "F" is associated with the federal Food and Drug Administration, and a "W" is associated with warnings. The values of one or more flags may be determined in the preprocessing module 110 (FIG. 1).<br><br>
[47]     Fields in the row object may signify information created and/or extracted during preprocessing 160 (FIG. 3). For example, the press release and/or article number 242 uniquely identifies an article within a collection of articles and may be that assigned in block 166 (FIG. 3). The headline 244 may be the headline extracted in block 172 (FIG. 3), and the ticker 246 may be the standard ticker symbol assigned in block 174 (FIG. 3).<br>
[48]     Similarly, the corporation data flags 248 may indicate one or more of the flags set in block 178 (FIG. 3). As depicted in FIGS. 4 and 5, the "<fc symbol may indicate that the corporation market capitalization is below a preset level it had attained relatively recently.>" symbol may indicate that at least a preset number of analysts have provided guidance regarding the corporation's future earnings. Other symbols may indicate which stock market indexes, if any, comprise the corporation's stock; for example, in the embodiment of the invention depicted in FIG. 5, the symbol "SP" indicates that the stock is a component of the S&amp;P 500.<br>
[49]     The team coverage field 250 indicates which editors, if any, are currently processing the article with a headlining tool. As depicted in FIG. 5, a pair of initials serves to identify an editor, but other codes and/or symbols may serve the same purpose. The headline count field 252 may indicate the number of times that editors have sent headlines from a particular article.<br>
[50]      The progress flags 254 indicate the status of a given article within an established headlining workflow. Each flag 254 corresponds to an operation included in the workflow and, in the depicted embodiment of the invention, appears until that operation has been completed. The number, meaning, and/or operation of the flag or flags 254 may vary, depending on the embodiment and the relevant business needs.<br><br>
[51]     In the depicted embbdiment of the invention, the time field 256 expresses in minutes the amount of time a give press release has been in the monitoring facility.<br>
[52]     Other visual cues, e.g. color and/or highlighting, may indicate properties of a row item 220 and/or the associated corporation. For example, the color of one or more fields and/or the background behind the one or more fields may indicate the corporation's market capitalization. Similar kinds of color alteration may indicate that an alert is associated with the corporation and/or the row item. Other visual indicators may comprise, e.g., varying the font of one or more text fields and/or the presence, absence, coloration, thickness, brightness, and/or other characteristics of a border around the row object 220.<br>
[53]     When one or more row items 220 appear in the monitoring screen 200 (FIG. 4), the associated user interface may receive input from an editor indicating an action to be taken with regard to that row item 220. For example, the editor can select one or more row objects 220 and then send the selected object or objects to a headlining module 114 (FIG. 1). The editor can alternatively select one or more row objects and then accept the headline displayed in the headline field 244.<br>
[54]     In an embodiment of the invention, a row object 220 may remain in monitoring screen 200 for a finite amount of time or until deleted by an editor.<br><br>
(55)     A headlining module 114 (FIG. 1) according to an embodiment of the invention may comprise a user interface that comprises a display such as the headlining screen 270 that FIG. 6. depicts. The headlining screen 270 comprises four main regions. An upper region 272 comprises information related to an article and/or the corporation referred to in it, and controls for editing and/or editing a headline and other information associated with the article. A region 274 comprises the text of the article and line numbers. Another region comprises one or more sets of snippets that may be inserted automatically into a headline. Still another region 278 comprises one or more navigation tools.<br>
[56]     The upper region 272 comprises a dashboard object 290 that comprises information specific to an article. The dashboard object 290 may comprise some or all of the information that a row object 220 (FIGS. 4—5) comprises and may use the same codes and/or symbols to convey such information. As depicted in FIG. 6, the dashboard object 290 comprises a code 292, which may indicate the source of the article, and the corporation name 294 or a shortened version of it. As depicted in FIG. 6, the content alert flags comprise two flags not depicted in FIGS. 4-5: an "R" indicating a "red alert" associated with the content and/or a "Y" indicating a "yellow alert." Depending on the embodiment of the invention, an alert may appear according to one or more rules and/or criteria, which may set by an administrator, an editor, or both.<br>
[57]     The upper region 272 comprises one or more controls and/or display elements that may serve to access information that may relate to the article and/or the corporation; to add, remove, and/or edit information associated with the article and/or the corporation; and/or to access one or more functions comprised by the headlining tool.<br><br>
[58]     A combination drop-down list box control 300 may be used to select a ticker symbol from a list of one or more tickers that may be associated with the article and/or to enter a ticker symbol manually. In response to selection or entry of a ticker symbol, the corporation name 294 may change to reflect the ticker symbol, and, if manually entered, the ticker symbol may be added to the drop-down list associated with the ticker symbol control 300.<br>
[59]     The lookup tools menu 302 may comprise one or more menu options that provide access to information regarding corporations and/or people identified in an article. In the displayed embodiment of the invention, selection of a menu item may cause display of a dialog box (not pictured) that can accept input of one or more search criteria and/or one or more user interface elements supporting selection of one or more corporations and/or persons. Depending on the embodiment, selection of one or more corporations may cause one or more corresponding ticker symbols to be added to the ticker entry field 304; and selection of one or more persons may cause one or more corresponding identification codes to be added to the code entry field 306.<br>
[60]     Tickers associated with the article appear in the ticker display field 308. In an embodiment of the invention, an editor may manually add, modify, and/or remove one or more ticker symbols in the ticker entry field 304. In response to a command from the editor, the one or more ticker symbols in the ticker entry field 304 can be associated with the article, and such association may be in addition to the article's designated ticker, which is the ticker symbol displayed in the ticker symbol control 300.<br><br>
[611     Similarly, codes associated with the article appear in the code display field 310. A code may identify, e.g., a unique person or industry, among other things. In an embodiment of the invention, an editor may manually add, modify, and/or remove one or more codes in the code entry field 306. In response to a command from the editor, the one or more codes in the code entry field 306 can be associated with the article.<br>
[62]     While being composed, a headline may appear in the headline entry field 320. The headline entry field 320 may be implemented as a control supporting manual editing of a headline. In an embodiment of the invention, the headline entry field 320 may be blank when headlining of an article commences.
