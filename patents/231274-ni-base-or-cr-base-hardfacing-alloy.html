HARDFACING ELECTRODE<br>
This application is a continuation-in-part of United States Patent Application Serial No. 11/041,815 filed on January 24, 2005 entitled “Hardfacing Alloy”, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The invention relates generally to the field of metal alloys and more particularly directed 5      to an electrode for forming a metal alloy on a workpiece, and even more particularly directed to an electrode for forming a hardfacing metal alloy on the surface of a workpiece.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
“Hardfacing” is a technique which involves applying a layer of hard material to a<br>
substrate for the purpose of increasing the wear and corrosion resistance of the substrate.   The<br>
10     use of this technique has increased significantly over the years as industry has come to recognize<br>
that substrates of softer, lower, cost material can be hardfaced to have the same wear and<br>
corrosion resistance characteristics as more expensive substrates of a harder material.<br>
Hardfacing involves the deposition of a hard layer by welding or thermal spraying.<br>
Conventional weld hardfacing is accomplished by oxyfuel welding (OFW), gas tungsten arc<br>
15      welding (TIG),  gas metal  arc welding (GMAW),  shielded metal  arc welding (SMAW),<br>
submerged arc welding (SAW), and flux-cored arc welding (FCAW). Plasma transferred arc<br>
(PTA) hardfacing and laser beam hardfacing can also be used.<br>
Most prior hardfacing materials that are harder than silicious earth materials are brittle and have a tendency to crack. These hardfacing materials are alloys which belong to a well-10 known group of “high Cr-irons” and their high abrasive resistance is derived from the presence in the microstructure of the Cr-carbides of the eutectic and/or hypereutectic type. In the as-welded condition, whatever the precautions taken, these hardfacing overlays always show a more or less dense network of cracks.<br>
In view of the present state of hardfacing technology, it would be highly desirable and<br>
15      advantageous to provide an electrode to form a hardfacing alloy composition having a<br>
microstructure of high abrasive resistance capable of being weld deposited without cracks to<br>
withstand the conditions of use.   Furthermore, it is desirable to provide an electrode to form a<br>
high chromium welding metal alloy system for use as a hardfacing surfacing on metal<br><br>
components that are subjected to high thermal and mechanical stresses.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention pertains to electrodes that form an alloy on a workpiece, and more particularly to an electrode that forms a hardfacing alloy on the surface of a workpiece, and even 5 more particularly to an electrode that forms a high chromium hardfacing metal alloy system on the surface of a workpiece. The hardfacing alloy that is formed by the electrode of the present invention is particularly useful as a metal surfacing on materials subjected to high thermal and mechanical stresses such as, but not limited to, steel mill caster rolls. One such hardfacing alloy composition is disclosed in United States Patent Application Serial No. 11/041,815 filed January<br>
10 24, 2005, which is incorporated herein by reference. The high chromium hardfacing alloy generally includes a low ferrite content in the hardfacing alloy matrix. The low ferrite content reduces the tendency of “fire cracking” in the hardfacing alloy. “Fire cracking” limits the life of a metal component that is coated or surfaced. Typically the ferrite content of the hardfacing alloy is less than about 10%, and more typically less than about 5%, and even more typically less<br>
15 than about 3%, and still even more typically less than about 2%. The hardfacing alloy can be formed by various types of electrodes and/or various types of welding processes. For instance, the electrode of the present invention can be a self shielding electrode or can be a gas shielded electrode. When the electrode is a gas shielded electrode, the shielding gas is generally CO2, Argon, or a CO2-Argon mixture; however, other shielding gasses can be used.  The electrode of<br>
20 the present invention can be a solid wire electrode, a flux coated electrode, a flux cored electrode, a metal filled electrode, etc. As such, the electrode of the present invention can be used in several different types of welding processes such as, but not limited to, neutral SAW flux with alloyed cored/solid electrode, alloyed SAW flux with alloyed cored/solid electrode, alloyed SAW flux with unalloyed cored/solid electrode, cored electrode with an alloyed/unalloyed sheath<br>
25 and alloyed/unalloyed fill. As can be appreciated, other types of electrodes and/or other types of welding processes can be used. The hardfacing alloy formed by the electrode of the present invention has a hardness in the range of about 25-64 RC (welded or tempered), and an ASTM G-65 wear rating in the range of about l-3g.<br>
The hardfacing alloy formed by the electrode of the present invention has a unique<br><br>
combination of chromium; nitrogen; and niobium and/or vanadium. Generally, the hardfacing alloy formed from the electrode of the present invention includes at least about 7% chromium; at least about 0.02% nitrogen; and at least about 0.3% niobium and/or at least about 0.05% vanadium. The hardfacing alloy also generally includes a majority of iron.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the following description of the invention for purposes of describing preferred embodiments of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the invention, the electrode of the present invention is formulated to produce an alloy, such as a hardfacing alloy composition, on a metal surface. When the alloy is a hardfacing alloy, the hardfacing alloy has an average hardness of about 25-65 RC in the welded state and/or the tempered state. The formed hardfacing alloy is particularly formulated to form a high chromium welding metal alloy system for use as a surfacing on metals subjected to high thermal and mechanical stresses. One such application is to apply the hardfacing alloy to steel mill caster rolls; however, it will be appreciated that the hardfacing alloy can be used in other applications. The produced hardfacing alloy is also formulated to resist the tendency for “fire cracking”, thereby extending the life of metal materials that are surfaced with the hardfacing alloy. The formed hardfacing alloy is also formulated so as to reduce the amount of ferrite in the alloy matrix. Typically, the hardfacing alloy includes less than about 6%, more typically, less than about 4% ferrite, even more particularly less than about 2% ferrite, and still even more particularly less than about 1% ferrite.<br><br>
The formed hardfacing alloy is further formulated to reduce sensitization of the alloy which can occur during thermal cycling.<br>
The electrode of the present invention is designed and formulated so that the formed hardfacing alloy composition can be deposited by any suitable welding means and methods such as, but not limited to, open arc, gas or flux shielded. The electrode of the present invention can be a solid wire, cored electrode, coated electrode or coated cored electrode. When the electrode is a coated and/or cored electrode, the coating and/or fill material in the core can include alloying agents, fluxing agents, slag agents, gas generating agents, etc. The electrode can be a self shielding electrode and/or be used in the presence of a shielding gas. The formed hardfacing alloy can be applied by directly depositing the metal particles on the workpiece and/or can be spray coated on the workpiece. As such, the formed hardfacing alloy can be applied by a variety of processes such as, but not limited to, submerged arc welding (SAW), shielded metal arc welding (SMAW), flux-cored arc welding (FCAW), gas metal arc welding (GMAW), gas tungsten arc welding (TIG), metal spraying, etc.<br>

The fill composition in the electrode typically constitutes about 25-35 weight percent of the electrode. The fill composition includes a majority weight percent metal powder. Up to about 10 weight percent of the fill composition can include non-metal powder components. These non-metal powder components can include metal oxides (e.g., aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide, silicon dioxide, sodium oxide, etc.), carbonates (e.g., calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, etc.), metal fluorides (e.g., calcium fluoride, etc.) and other elements and compounds (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorous, sulfur, etc.). These non-metal powder components can be used as filler materials in the fill composition, and/or be used to improve arc stability, provide gas shielding, modify the slag characteristics, modify the composition of the hardfacing alloy, etc.<br>
One non-limiting example of a fill composition by weight percent total electrode that can be used in the electrode of the present invention is as follows:<br>
Aluminum	0.1-0.5%<br>
Carbon	0.02-0.25%<br>
Calcium	0-0.002%<br>
Cobalt	0-0.03%<br>
Chromium	10-15%<br>
Copper	0-0.005%<br>
Iron	3-7%<br>
Magnesium	0.05-0.3%<br>
Manganese	0.5-1.5%<br>
Molybdenum	0.4-1%<br>
Niobium	0.4-0.7%<br>
Nickel	3-7%<br>
Silicon	0.2-0.7%<br>
Tantalum	0-0.03%<br>
Titanium	0-0.05%<br>
Vanadium	0.1-0.3%<br>
Zinc	0-0.003%<br>
