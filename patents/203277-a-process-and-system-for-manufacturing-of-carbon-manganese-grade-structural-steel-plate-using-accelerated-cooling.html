				<td>The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing hot rolled carbon manganese grade structural steel plates using accelerated cooling and in particular, relates to the step of improving mechanical properties without normalising operations but using accelerated controlled cooling in manufacture of such grade of structured plates. The invention also relates to a system for use in achieving the controlled accelerated cooling and improving of mechanical properties of such steel plates.<br>
Usually, plates after being hot rolled in the finishing stand are generally cooled in air. These plates are subjected to surface and ultrasonic soundness testing on inspection beds and after trimming operation cut into sizes. The sized plates are then normalised in the continuous normalising furnace at around 900°C to improve the mechanical properties. Conventionally the temperature in the last finishing pass is in the range of 950-1050°C depending upon the thickness of plate. The required temperature range is brought by controlling the reheating temperature and by oscillating the plate between roughing and finishing stand. The normalising operation involves not only an additional process but also consumes a lot of thermal energy (440 Mcal / Tonne). Thus there is a need to develop a suitable process such that normalising process can be eliminated and the required mechanical properties are achieved by the developed process.<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide a process for manufacture of hot rolled carbon manganese grade structural steel plates with improved mechanical properties without use of the conventional complex and energy intensive normalising operations.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for manufacture of hot rolled carbon manganese grade structural steel plates with improved mechanical properties following a controlled accelerated cooling of the hot rolled plates.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is specifically directed to provide carbon manganese grade structural plates of 14-28 mm thickness with improved mechanical properties by controlled accelerated cooling of the hot rolled plates.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to provide for a system for use in controlled accelerated cooling of carbon manganese structural grade plates with improved mechanical properties which would be simple to operate and would be cost-effective.<br><br>
Yet further object is directed to provide for an auto mode operative system for accelerated cooling of hot rolled carbon manganese plates using a spray cooling device which would be automatically operative based upon the speed of flow of hot plates, the characteristics  of the hot plates to be cooled and related operating conditions.<br>
Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided in the process for manufacture of hot rolled carbon manganese grade structural plates the step of improving mechanical properties without normalising operations comprising :<br>
subjecting the plates after conventional hot rolling in the temperature range of 860 - 900 °C to a step of controlled accelerated cooling such that the stop cooling temperature of plates are achieved in the temperature range of 660 - 710°C. /<br>
Cold Slabs are heated in the reheating furnace to make these soft for processing in roughing and finishing stands. As the temperature of stock is increased the resistance to deformation is greatly decreased.    There are three zones in the reheating furnace, namely preheating zone, heating zone and finally soaking zone.    In the pushing type reheating furnace, slabs are continuously pushed in the furnace.   The temperature of soaking zone is in the range of 123020°C.   Slabs are kept for sufficient time here such)       that the temperature between the surface and centre of slabs become equal.  So far the relevance of reheating to the hot rolling controlled accelerated cooling is concerned, if the soaking temperature is not sufficiently high, it will not be possible to roll these slabs into final plate thickness as the mill has limitations with regard to load, torque etc.  Secondly, the finishing temperature achieved is lower than the transformation temperature of steel (Ar3), then the beneficial effect of accelerated cooling will not be realized.  The beneficial effect of accelerated cooling is grain refinement. Due to grain refinement, the mechanical properties are improved.<br>
In the above disclosed process manufacturing of hot rolled carbon manganese grade structural plates with high strength properties of the invention is achieved under accelerated cooling conditions. The finishing temperature is however, controlled within the narrow range. In controlled rolling the material should be deformed below the recrystallisation stop temperature at the finishing stand. The recrystallisation stop temperature for the above carbon manganese grade structural plates is around 800°C and the finishing temperature in process of this invention is in the range of 880 ± 20°C. The process of the invention provides for selective finishing temperature and controlled cooling regime. Controlled finishing temperature and cooling regime is based on the mathematical modelling and validation of the model by plant experiments.<br>
In accordance with a first aspect, the mathematical model based cooling regimes was established for production of plates of different thickness with desired<br><br>
mechanical properties without following the post rolling heat treatment (normalising) route after finish rolling. A mathematical model was developed to predict the temperature profile of the plate on the run out table and its dependence on the finishing temperature of the plates, the heat transfer coefficient and the speed and thickness of plate. The heat released as a result of phase change was also included while ascertaining the temperature profile.<br>
The implicit finite difference method was adopted to solve the heat transfer  equations taking into account the boundary conditions. The heat transfer coefficient between the plate surface and cooling water was estimated by comparing the plate surface temperature measured during plant experiments with those predicted by the model and retrofitting the values so arrived at.<br>
For achieving the desired cooling regime optimisation of water management (flow rate of water) and rate of material flow.is very important.<br>
Thus in accordance with another aspect the present invention provides a system for use in accelerated cooling of hot rolled carbon manganese grade structural plates comprising :<br>
spray cooling device having a top cooling means and a bottom cooling means ; means for monitoring the temperature of the plate exiting from the hot rolling finishing stand and entering the cooling zone and also means fcr monitoring the stop cooling temperature after the accelerated cooling ;<br>
said spray cooling system adapted to be operative based upon the plate characteristics and relevant operating parameters for the cooling regime such that the,temperature in the last finishing'pass'is in the range of 860-900oC<br>
The above system of the invention utilises a distributed control system (DCS) based automation scheme and the water delivery system was modified/changed to suit the automatic conditions. The main aim of the automated coolin system is to carry out the following functions<br><br><br>
(i)       Auto mode operation of the cooling system. (ii)       Process monitoring (iii)      Report generation.<br>
The spray cooling device (SCD) used in our invention was not the conventional SCD. The conventional SCD did not have any instrument for measuring and controlling the process parameters. For producing accelerated cooled plates of consistent and uniform properties a distributed control system (DCS) based automation scheme is developed and implemented.<br>
Water quantity is one of the main parameters of the process. Flow control system<br>
for each section is provided. For achieving steady pressure in the main line a<br>
pressure control loop with an autpmated bypass and pressure transmitter is<br>
provided. The bypass is adapted for a maximum discharge of 1200 m3/hr.<br><br>
For flow control system, orifice type flow meter is provided since the main purpose<br>
of the loop was to control the flow, not to stop and start the flow, a butterfly valve<br>
was used. Eleven such loops were designed and installed between the first gate<br>
valve and the branching point of the top and bottom collectors. The new-scheme<br>
was aimed at operating the SCD in flow control mode. Due to this, the pressors<br>
measurement in collectors is not found necessary. However, pressure switches<br>
were mounted on each collector for giving an alarm in case of pressure increase<br>
in the collectors. The flow control system was aimed at controlling the flow in auto<br>
mode not to start or step the flow through the collectors.<br>
The details of the invention, its objects and advantages are explained in greater detail in relation to non-limiting exemplary embodiments of the method and system of the invention discussed in relation to the accompanying figures wherein<br>
Fig. 1 is a schematic diagram of cooling arrangement of run out table. Fig. 2 illustrates the effect of roller table speed on temperature profile. Fig. 3 illustrates the automation scheme for the spray cooling  and Fig. 4 is an illustration of the upgraded spray cooling device.<br><br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic diagram of the cooling arrangement on the run out table in accordance with the invention. The total length of the run out table is about 83 m the distance between the exit from the finishing stand and the start of the first water bank is about 41.5 m. Each water bank is about 2.4 m long and consists of four top laminar water headers. The gap between two adjacent headers is about 0.8 m. the distance between the first bank and the pyrometer 1 is about 7.0 m whereas that between last bank and pyrometer 2 is about 7.1 m.<br>
Bottom cooling is carried out through spray jets. There are eleven water banks each having four headers. The maximum water flow rate for each header on the top cooling system is 70 m3h1 while that in the bottom is 50 m3 h1. The water pressure of the top headers is 0.02 - 0.03 MPa whereas that of the bottom headers is 0.01 - 0.015 Mpa.<br>
In the present case roll table speed indicates the speed of plate under cooling conditions. The effect of roller table speed on the temperature profile of the hot plate when other parameters like thickness, heat transfer coefficient and finishing   temperatures are kept constant is important in arriving at optimum cooling rate. The temperature profile of the hot rolled plate at different roller table speeds, when other parameters are constant has been shown in (Fig. 2) for 25 mm plate thickness as an example. It is observed that for speeds 1, 1.5 and 2 ms'1 the stop cooling temperature is about 652, 690 and 708°C respectively. Similar values for 16 and 20 mm plate thickness are 530, 650, 695°C and 613, 681 and 704°C respectively. To maintain uniformity in microstructure in the through thickness direction, the temperature difference between the surface and mid thickness should be as low as possible. To ensure the minimum difference, the proper selection of heat transfer coefficient,and roller table speed is important.,<br>
To achieve the desired stop cooling temperature at a particular cooling rate, an accurate estimation of heat transfer coefficient between the plate and the water banks from top and bottom is of paramount importance. This is primarily because a single value of heat transfer coefficient describes the cooling conditions of the hot,plate under the laminar water banks from top and bottom in the modelling  exercise The stop cooling temperature was chosen as the single parameter to<br><br>
test the accuracy of the model as this can be measured experimentally through plant experiments.<br>
Balancing of water from top and bottom is very important, as uneven cooling of plates leads to warpage of the plates.<br>
The distributed control system (DCS) used in the system was adapted to access the following signals for executing the control strategy :<br>

All together 73 l/O's were available in the field equipments and 12 PID loops were to be executed using 26 l/O's.<br>
For this job, a DCS (CIE-1000) from Toshiba was used. This DCS is configured around a PC which works as an operator interface station (OIS). This communication between OIS and MCS is executed through a thin ether-net. The DCS has two components.

The MCS panel of the DCS contains microprocessor based control station with its l/O's, all hardware required for inter facing l/O's with field equipments and power supplies for field equipments and OIS. The OIS desk houses the PC which supervises the total operation of the system. This PC is equipped with two key boards e.g. engineering key board and operator's key board. Engineering key board is used only for modifying the software and some base data and is not available to the operator. The total operation is carried out using operator's key board which is always connected to the PC. All auto manual stations are also mounted on the desk along with the processor of the entry side pyrometer.<br>
For executing the cooling regime for different thickness a look up table is incorporated in the software.<br>
As already mentioned, achievement of stop cooling temperature at a particular cooling rate is of paramount importance for the required microstructure and therefore, the mechanical properties in plates. Process variables such as heat transfer coefficient, finishing temperature, speed and thickness of plate have great influence on the stop cooling temperature of the plate on the run out table.<br>
Keeping finishing temperature, speed and stop cooling temperature constant, the accurate estimation of heat transfer coefficient becomes important for a particular thickness of plate. However, for fixed value of heat transfer coefficient, speed and finishing temperature, the required stop cooling temperature is controlled by varying the speed of the plate as the thickness of the plate varies.<br><br>
it is definitely possible to have a range for the operating parameters relative to the thickness which can cover all varieties of the process  Operating parameters for each   thickness   can   be   selected   and   the   accelerated   cooling   determined accordingly.<br>
Industrial trials were conducted at 3600 mm plate mill with plates of grade IS:2062 and thickness 14-28 mm. To obtain the desired microstructures in plates, a cooling regime was worked out and implemented at plate mill. The cooling regime followed consisting of thickness of plate finish rolling temperature, water flow between top and bottom cooling sections, total flow rate, material speed and stop cooling temperature are illustrated in Table-I hereunder:<br>
