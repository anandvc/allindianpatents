				<td>PLANT DISEASE AND INSECT DAMAGE CONTROL COMPOSITION AND PLANT DISEASE AND INSECT DAMAGE PREVENTION METHOD<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a plant disease and insect damage control composition and a plant disease and insect damage prevention method.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002]<br>
It is described in Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open (JP-A) No. 07-179448 that an effect is shown by dinotefuran as an insecticidal compound, with application methods such as foliar application and water application, against: Lepidopterous pests, such as the common cutworm, Chilo and the common cabbageworm; Hemiptera pests, such as the greenhouse white fly, the cotton aphid, the comstock mealybug, and the southern green stink bug; Coleoptera pests, such as the rice water weevil and the striped flea beetle; Diptera pests such as the house fly and the rice leaf miner; Thysanoptera pests such as onion thrips; Orthoptera pests, such as the smoky brown cockroach and rice grasshopper; and the like.    However, there are no indication that there is an effect shown for pest insect prevention by application procedures such as spray treatment, coating treatment, dip treatment, dressing treatment, fumigation and smoking treatment, and pressure injection to plant seeds.<br>
[0003]<br>
Moreover, it is described in JP-A No. 08-245322, JP-A No. 08-245323, JP-A No. 08-291009, and JP-A No. 11-005708 that a composition containing dinotefuran and a fungicidal compound shows, in the field of paddy rice cultivation, a synergistic effect against rice blast disease (Pyricularia oryzae) and sheath blight disease (Rhizoctonia solani) in application methods such as to seedling raising boxes.    However, there is no indication that an effect is shown in disease prevention and insect damage prevention by applications of spray treatment, coating treatment, dip treatment, or dressing treatment to plant seeds.    Furthermore, there is no indication of the use of mixtures of fulsulfamide and/or hymexazol, with dinotefuran, nor is there any indication of a synergistic effect due to mixed use.<br>
It is described in JP-A 61-197553 (Japanese Patent Announcement No. 06-027113) that flusulfamide, as a fungicidal compound, shows antimicrobial activity or growth inhibition activity to various plant pathogenic microbes across a wide range of plant diseases by spraying, soil surface application, soil incorporation application, seed<br>
dipping, and root dust coating, root immersion of seedlings and the like, and flusulfamide shows a prominent effect especially against soil diseases where the number of effective control chemicals are small.   Furthermore, the above document mentions the possibility of concomitant use of flusulfamide with a pesticide and the like. However, there is no indication of using flusulfamide with dinotefiiran or hymexazol, or a synergistic effect thereof.<br>
JP-ANo. 03-227904 (Japanese Patent No. 2,860,492) and JP-ANo. 08-198710 (Japanese Patent No. 3,608,830), and JP-ANo. 08-198713 (Japanese Patent No. 3,608,831) disclose a synergistic effect of the concomitant use of flusulfamide with a fungicidal compound, and the like.    However, there is no indication of using flusulfamide with dinotefuran.<br>
[0004]<br>
As chemicals which prevent plant disease by applying to plant seeds there are, conventionally, benomyl agents, thiophanate-methyl agents, prochloraz agents, pefurazoate agents, and the like, and it is known that these will demonstrate an effect, as single agents or mixtures thereof, by spray treatment, coating treatment, dip treatment, or dressing treatment to seeds.    However, among these agents, it is reported that the control effect against rice bakanae disease of benomyl and thiophanate-methyl agents is falling.    Moreover, while prochloraz agents are applied against rice blast disease, brown spot, bakanae disease, tulip bulb rot, and shallot dry rot disease, and pefurazoate agents are applied aginst rice blast disease, brown spot, bakanae disease, wheat pink snow mold, and tulip bulb rot, other applications of there agents are not known. Moreover, mixtures of benomyl and thiuram are applied for: rice diseases of rice blast disease, seedling blight, bakanae disease, brown spot, bacterial grain rot, bacterial brown stripe and discolorations of rice; wheat-like cereal diseases of barley stripe, loose smut, Cephalosporium stripe and scald; cucumber fusarium wilt; gummy stem blight; damping off; tomato fusarium wilt; watermelon fusarium wilt; soya bean purple seed stain; taros Alternaria leaf spot; sugarcane smut; Coix lacryma-jobi leaf blight; smut; corn seedling blight; Japanese pumpkin fusarium basal rot; shallots dry rot disease; garlic white rot; and yam root rot.    However, other applications thereof are not known. Moreover, since mixtures of benomyl and thiuram have a strong affect on aquatic animals, there are warnings against their use in places where there is a possibility of dispersal or flow into rivers, lakes, coastal areas, and culture ponds.<br>
Description of the Invention Problem to be Solved by the Invention [0005]<br>
An object of the invention is to provide a new prevention composition and control method against disease and pest damage to plant bodies, soil, plant seeds, stored cereals, stored legumes, stored fruits, stored vegetable, silage, stored flowering plants and export/import timber, wherein the prevention composition and control method show an effect against plural pathogens and pest insects, including emerging resistant pathogens and resistant pest insects, yet have a very low toxicity to mammals and fish, the composition being applied to the plant body, soil, plant seeds, stored cereals, stored legumes, stored fruits, stored vegetable, silage, stored flowering plants and export/ import timber. Means for Solving the Problem<br>
[0006]<br>

As required, silicone compounds may be used as antifoaming agents and propylene glycol, ethylene glycol, and the like may be used as antifreezing agents.<br>
[0034]<br>
When applying the composition of the invention to plant seeds, plant seeds may be immersed in a composition as it is. Alternatively, the composition may be diluted to a suitable concentration with a suitable carrier, and then used by immersion, dust coating, spraying, coating treatment, or the like, to plant seeds.<br>
[0035]<br>
There are no particular limitations to suitable carriers, and examples that may be given thereof include: liquid carriers, such as water or organic solvents such as ethanol; solid carriers, such as inorganic substances like bentonite, montmorillonite, kaolinite, diatomaceous earth, white clay, talc, clay, vermiculite, gypsum, calcium carbonate, amorphous silica, and ammonium sulfate; vegetable organic substances, such as soya bean flour, wood flour, saw dust, wheat flour, lactose, sucrose, and glucose; and urea.<br>
[0036]<br>
The dilution rate of formulation may be set appropriately, and the dilution rate is suitably chosen according to the candidate crop for application, type of disease damage, and type of insect damage, and the dilution rate is suitably 1 to 50,000 times, is preferably 1 to 20,000 times, and is still more preferably 1 to 10,000 times.<br>
[0037]<br>
For carrying out dust coating, spraying, and coating treatment, a suitable amount of the formulation used is usually about 0.05% to 50% of dry plant seed weight, more preferably 0.1 % to 40%, and still more preferably 0.1 % to 30%.    However, the amount used is not limited to these ranges, and may be varied according to the form of the formulation and to the kind of plant seed used as the candidate for treatment.<br>

Test Example 1    Control Effect Against Sugar Beet Seedling Damping Off<br>
A Rhizoctonia culture and a Pythium culture were separately cultivated at 25°C for seven days in a wheat bran medium, and after respectively grinding, the Rhizoctonia culture and/or the Pythium culture were added to and mixed in with sterilized soil, and the mixtures were filled in plastic pots to obtain infected soils each containing:<br>
