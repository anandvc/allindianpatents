				<td>This invention relates to an improved process for the treatment of spent wash using marine algae to produce potable water.<br>
This invention particularly relates to an improved method for separation of lignin and coloring matter from spent wash of alcohol industries using marine alga.<br>
The alcohol industry in India is based on molasses as the principal raw material. The alcohol recovery ranges from 7 to 9% from the molasses, fermentable sugars, the organic, inorganic chemicals in the molasses find their way into effluent which causes high BOD/COD. This effluent known as "spent wash" is also acidic in nature, forms hydrogen sulfide, creating bad odor having black color and hence cannot be disposed as such into the water stream. In the spent wash, origin of black color is due to plant pigment melanoidins, polyphenolic compounds, caramels, which are produced by thermal degradation and condensation reaction of sugar.<br>
In the prior art following methods are used for the separation of coloring bodies from spent wash in the alcohol industries. Several methods hitherto used are described in brief here in below:<br>
This is mainly useful to minimize industrial pollution due to the spent wash.<br>
Apparatus for the decolorizing molasses.<br>
Chida, T; Tsuboi, H. Jpn. Kokai. 77, 90, 639, 30 Jul. 1977,pp.3, CA 88 : 24490c.(1978)<br>
Molasses was decolorized with active carbon in an adsorption tower containing plate electrodes impressed with d. c. voltage. The pigments were dielec. Polarized by electrodes and adsorbed by active carbon. Thus<br><br>
molasses was decolorized 98% in an adsorption tower containing granular<br>
active carbon and vertical carbon electrodes at 10 cm intervals at 0.1 A/dm2<br>
and 8V with retention time 3 h.<br>
Purification of molasses<br>
Kaga T; Hiramoto, T; Hamanaka, K; Sato, M. &amp; Tokida Y. Jpn. Kokai 77, 108,<br>
035. 10 Sept. 1977, pp.7,. CA 88: 75566q., (1978)<br>
Granular active carbon was used to decolorize brown liquors of Brix 62 - 3<br>
and stammer color 5.2-5.4 was passed through a regenerated active column<br>
at 75-8C and solids carbon ratio 100 with 64% decolourization and molasses<br>
having Brix 35-6 pH 5.8 &amp; stammer color 70 was passed through the same<br>
column at 72-3.<br>
Removal of coloring substances from molasses solutions.<br>

Technol. 1977, (4) 31-5, 88 : 8827n.,(1978).<br>
The filtration of molasses diluted to 35% with water through a column filled<br>
with AV - 16GS. (12626-33-4) Anion exchanger in chloride form removal<br>
&gt;50% of colored substances and organic impurities. The effectiveness of<br>
removal of these substances decrease in order invert sugar &gt; melanoidins &gt;<br>
caramels. The decrease of molasses cone, improved its decolourization by<br>
exchanger. Colored substances in molasses could be coagulated by d. c. and<br>
removed  by filtration  but the procedure was effective only below 50%<br>
molasses cone, colored substances in molasses are not adsorbed by Soviet<br>
AGS - 4 activated carbon.<br>
Sorption of sugar coloring substances on ion exchangers.<br><br>

The decoloring power of ion exchange resin towards molasses (A) sugar from<br>
3rd crystal (B) , thick syrup (C) and clear syrup (D) is not the same. Thus<br>
centranol. W -291  (I) (51258-00-5) and Amberlite IRA -900 (9050-97-9)<br>
reduce best the color of A &amp; B or Amberlite IRA -68 II (9056-59-1) can be<br>
used for decolouring C &amp; D is best decolorized by II, although Amberlite IRA-<br>
4015 (9036-93-S) can also be used. A and C can be efficiently decolorized<br>
with carboraffina activated carbon.<br>

Prom-St 1978 (1) 65-6. CA 88 : 91344w.(1979)<br>
Colored substances present in the intermediate of sugar manufacture and<br>
molasses can be removed by combined treatment 1st with Pb (OAC) 4 (546-<br>
67-8) and then with activated carbon. The decolorized solns. are made up to<br>
known vols. and used for the polarimetric/ polometric? detn. of sucrose (I) (57-<br>
50-1). Activated carbon does not absorb (I) (87-50-1) and it does not require<br>
washing after it is filtered off.<br>
Waste water treatment.<br>
Sakurai, S. Jpn. Kokai Tokkyo Koho. 79 51,250. 21 April 1979. CA 91:<br>
78574p.(1979) Hydrogen peroxide soln. is added to waste water, then the pH<br>
is adjusted to 
sol. pollutants. Adjusting the pH 6.0-8.5 flocculates the insoluble pollutants.<br><br>
In hitherto known processes main drawbacks are the use of acidic media which involves corrosive problems, filtration problems due to colloidal particles and incomplete removal of organics as well as inorganic matter in the effluent water and colored effluent water due to organic mainly lignin and mellanoidin.<br>
The adsorbing material used is activated carbon or commercially available chemo absorbents.<br>
The following references will be useful to assess the growth pattern of red algae in general and porphyra &amp; liagora.<br>

The bioaccumulation of Fe, Cu, Zn, Cd, Pb, Na, K, Ca and Mg by seven<br>
species  of red  algae  (Rhodophyta) were  studied  after their  seasonal<br>
collections from 9 stations in Antikgra Gulf. This area is characterizes by its<br><br>
bauite substrate and discharge of wastes from an aluminum factory. No metal in Liagora showed a significant correlation with the concentration of the dissolved metals in seawater.<br>
Polysaccharide of algae 43 neutral xylan and sulfated xylomannan from red seaweed<br>
Usor, A. I.; Dobkina, I.M.; 1991 17(8) CA 115 : 275755p.(1992) A sulfated xylomannan and several fractions of neutral polysaccharides have been isolated from red alga Liagora. Water-soluble neutral xylan purified through copper complex was shown to be a linear polymer having B-1-4 and -3 linkages between D- xylopyranoseresidues at a ratio of 6:1. Ion sulfated polysaccharide was investigated using partial hydrolysis, methylation after and before desulfation as 13C NMR spectroscopy. Polysaccharide of algae<br>
Usov, A.I.; Dobkina, I.M. 1988 14(5), CA 109 :70387z.(1989) A sulfated xylomannan and several fractions of neutral polysaccharides were isolated from red seaweed Liagora. Xylomannan was shown to contain D-mannose and D-xylose of sulfate has a linear backbone built of alpha-1-3 linked d-mannopyranose residues. On the average there are two branching points and seven sulfate groups attached to position 6 &amp; 2at a ratio of about 2:1 at every 14 mannopyranose residues of the main chain. Chemical study of Cuban seaweed<br>
Estevez, M. L; Olivan, D. L; Velazquez, R. 1985 1(1), 87-93, CA 104 : 165402m, (1986)<br>
Polysaccharides were examined from 13 species of red algae collected on Cuban coast.<br><br>
Sol. sulfated polysaccharides were predominated. The polysaccharides were primarily composed of galactose. These alga form a firm carrageenan gel when polysaccharide yield of &gt;30% of dry weight were attained from alga.<br>
In the process of the present, lignin organic, sugars inorganic separated by treating the spent wash with seaweed's e.g. Porphyra, Liagora and calcarious material preferably lime powder.<br>
Seaweeds are the source of gel forming polysaccharides (phycocolloides) and widely used in the industries as emulsifying agents, gelling agents, stabilizers, thickeners and suspension agents. After carefully going through the literature search it is noticed that use of seaweed polysaccharide of Porphyra as a decolorizing agent is not mentioned. The combination Porphyra and lime powder found to remove organics, inorganics and the removal of the color of spent wash from black to pale yellow, which further treated with active carbon to get almost colorless liquid.<br>
Chemical structure of Liagora reveals the presence of a sulfated xylomannan; several fractions of neutral polysaccharides and other charged groups like mannans and xylans having phycocolloid properties and are anionic in nature. Polyelectrolytes with marked cation exchange properties must be of some significance in plants living in saline medium. The treated effluent was found to be passing BOD, COD and all the other parameters of effluent treated water required by the environmental agencies.<br>
All the operations in this process are done at room temperature, hence saves energy costs, the treated water can be recycled to the process. The resins used in the process can be generated with known methods.<br><br>
There is continued interest on development of new improved processes for separation of lignin organic matters; inorganic compounds from spent wash produces in the distillery wastes of sugar factories. It is the known fact that lignin-containing effluents are not degradable and hence has disposal problems in the environment.<br>
The invention is based on our finding that in the presence of Porphyra,<br>
p chemical structure 1,3 linked JMD-galactopyranose and 1,4 - linked 3,6 -<br>
anhydrous alpha - L -galactopyranose and other charged groups like mannans and xylans have better phycocolloid properties and are anionic polyelctrolytes with marked action exchange properties must be of some significance in plants living in saline medium.<br>
Further at pH &gt;3 sulfated polysaccharide Porphyran, xylomannan, several fractions of neutral polysaccharides like D-xylopyranose, D-mannose and D-mannopyranose are responsible for the selective absorption of coloring chromophores and potassium with the adsorption of the lignin polyphonic bodies, the obtained pale yellow effluent treated with calcarious material particularly lime powder CaO &gt; 98%, ion exchange system and activated carbon to remove organics, inorganics and trace of coloring matter to colorless water which can be recycled in the process in a period ranging upto 4-6 hours.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the treatment of spent wash from distillery wastes produced in the sugar industries to produce potable water using marine red alga.<br>
Another object is to treat the effluent in a manner to meet environmental standards.<br><br>
Yet another objective is to provide a process using red algae essentially having polysaccharide with sulfate or acetyl groups on cell wall and galactopyranose residue on cell membrane .<br>
Accordingly , the present invention provides an improved process for the treatment of spent wash using marine algae to produce potable water which comprises contacting spent wash being diluted with water in the proportion ranging 1:1 to 1:5 with a marine red algae for a period ranging 30-120 minutes preferably under stirring , treating the said reacted diluted spent wash with calcarious material for a period ranging 30-120 minutes preferably under stirring, separating the coagulated material so formed from supernatant by conventional methods , then optionally treating the said supernatant by conventional ion exchange resin such as herein described followed by activated charcoal to produce potable water<br>
In one of the embodiments of the present invention,   marine red alga used may be either Porphyra or Liagora sp.<br>
In still another embodiments , the calcarious material such as lime, bone powder, shell powder, diatomaceous earth and salts of calcium and natural source thereof may be used.<br>
In another embodiments the black liquor may be diluted 5 times using water such as tap water, mineral water, natural water, demineralized water, distilled water .<br><br>
The ratio of Porphyra/Liagora and calcareous material powder to effluent may ranges from 0.5 - 2.00'<br>
The said alga used may be in the form of dried powder or embeded in neutral matrix or in a natural form.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the ion exchange resin is selected from anion/ cation exchanger resins such as commercially available IR-120, IR-400 and IRC-50.<br>
In a feature of the present invention the conventional methods used to separate the coagulated impurities may be sedimentation or filtration or centrifugation.<br>
In the feature of the present invention the treated effluent was found to be meeting all standards of the pollution control Act such as COD/BOD total dissolved solids &amp; color. The final water produced is a colorless .<br>
In another feature of the present invention all operations of this process are done at room temperature without the use of mineral acid to make the effluent free from organic , inorganics and the treated water can be recycled to the process or let into the natural resource.<br>
The resin used in the process can be regenerated with known methods.<br>
