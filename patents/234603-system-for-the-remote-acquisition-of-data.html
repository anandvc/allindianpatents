				<td>"SYSTEM FOR THE REMOTE ACQUISITION OF DATA"<br>
The invention applies in particular to the field of<br>
electric energy distribution to a plurality of users<br>
spread over the territory; but, more generally, it can<br>
also be applied to other services, as for example the<br>
distribution of water and gas, or for district heating.<br>
The invention satisfies the requirement - which has<br>
arisen since a few years on a worldwide basis, especially<br>
in the technically more developed countries - to carry out<br>
the remote reading of the electric energy consumptions<br>
and, if desired, to apply different rates when invoicing<br>
the users, also of domestic type. A problem of this type<br>
has already been described, for example, in the Italian<br>
Patent No. 1.232.195, filed on 26 October 1988 by the same<br>
Applicant, or in the document US-A-4,803,632.<br>
This requirement has arisen, and has increasingly<br>
developed, not only due to economical reasons, but also<br>
due to the need to establish further transparency and<br>
efficiency in the contractual relationships with the<br>
customers, in a market which is progressively getting more<br>
and more liberalized.<br>
In this background, supported by the technological<br>
evolutions in the field of componentry technology, a<br>
certain number of technical solutions, systems or<br>
methodologies have been proposed, which intend to solve<br>
the problems connected with this situation.<br>
The approach which associates these different studies<br>
can be summed up in a network which makes use of varied<br>
forms of communication to put into contact the peripheral<br>
points of the system (electricity meters in the targets of<br>
the users) with a supervision unit designed to conduct the<br>
procedures deemed helpful, time after time, to reach the<br>
intended objects.<br>
Said contact is obtained through a direct<br>
communication between the supervision unit (generally a<br>
server with a high processing power) and the peripheral<br>
electricity meters, as described for example in W0-<br>
98/10299, or by interposing in this pyramid at least an<br>
intermediate hierarchic level, as proposed in WO-98/10394.<br>
Examples of these proposals can also be found in other<br>
patents, for example EP-A2-0.723.358 or WO-99/46564.<br>
Nevertheless, the greatest majority of these projects<br>
has very often remained at the stage of purely unrealistic<br>
attempts or laboratory achievements, while the few<br>
proposals which have evolved up to reaching the level of<br>
an industrial type achievement have reached no appreciable<br>
results in terms of diffusion and use. The reasons for<br>
which such proposals have found no application on a vast<br>
scale lie in the fact that the industrial products<br>
obtained are not apt to guarantee the required<br>
performances when applied to situations involving a very<br>
high number of targets of users, as it generally happens<br>
in the case of electric energy consumptions.<br>
The main object of the present invention is therefore<br>
to propose a system allowing, on one hand, the remote<br>
acquisition of data from the targets of users and, on the<br>
other hand, also the remote control of such targets, so as<br>
to be able to satisfy the present requirements of all<br>
those companies which - like the companies distributing<br>
electric energy, water, gas and the like - operate in the<br>
presence of a high number of targets of users spread over<br>
the territory. To give an indication as to what is meant<br>
by "a high number of targets of users" it can be recalled<br>
that the company ENEL (National Company for Electric<br>
Energy) deals at present with about thirty million targets<br>
of users.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to<br>
propose a system apt to guarantee both a regular and<br>
continuous working, and a capacity of survival also in the<br>
case of blackouts of any type.<br>
According to the present invention, said objects are<br>
reached with a system making use - in a manner known per<br>
se - of a single operating unit connected to the targets<br>
of users through a plurality of intermediate stations,<br>
said system having the characteristics pointed out in the<br>
characterizing part of claim 1.<br>
Further characteristics and advantages of the present<br>
invention will anyhow result more evident from the<br>
following detailed description of a preferred embodiment<br>
thereof, given by mere way of non-limiting example and<br>
partially illustrated on the accompanying drawing, the<br>
only figure of which shows a diagram of the structure of<br>
the system according to the invention. Said diagram<br>
substantially represents the set-up of the Italian<br>
territory at the filing date of the present patent<br>
application: it is meant to supervise and control about<br>
twenty-seven million electricity meters distributed over<br>
the whole territory. It is anyhow understood that this<br>
diagram merely represents an example and that it should in<br>
no way be considered as limiting the present invention.<br>
Thus, according to a first aspect of the present<br>
invention, such a vast set-up as that illustrated on the<br>
drawing, is obtained,<br>
- on the one hand, by distributing the electricity<br>
meters CE according to area units Al ... An and connecting<br>
the meters of each unit to a respective common<br>
concentrator C-BT1 ... C-BTn. Each of said units Al ... An<br>
comprises a limited number of electricity meters CE; by<br>
the term "limited" is meant a relatively small number of<br>
meters CE, preferably between 50 and 300, determined by<br>
the vastness of the territory or area served thereby, or<br>
by other factors, also commercial, connected with the<br>
territory taken into consideration;<br>
on the other hand, by distributing a plurality of<br>
said concentrators C-BT1 ...C-BTn over the whole territory<br>
being served, and by then connecting such concentrators to<br>
a single central server AMM. By the term "plurality" is<br>
here meant a number higher - by at least one, but also by<br>
two orders of magnitude - than the number of electricity<br>
meters CE of a unit, for example a number higher than<br>
100,000 concentrators, in the case being illustrated<br>
330.000 concentrators.<br>
According to a fundamental characteristic of the<br>
present invention, once a network of this type has been<br>
created, one provides not to concentrate the processing<br>
capacity, namely the intelligence of the system, merely in<br>
the central server AMM - as substantially done in prior<br>
art - but to distribute it between the three<br>
aforementioned components, namely the central server AMM,<br>
the concentrators C-BT1 ... C-BTn, and the electricity<br>
meters CE. The principle adopted for this distribution is<br>
what allows to find the way for the communication lines to<br>
no longer have to transmit a considerable amount of data<br>
to be processed, but only a reduced amount of data, which<br>
has already been at least partially processed.<br>
Substantially, to allow a system involving such high<br>
numbers and functional performances as those illustrated<br>
to work efficiently, with no delays and without any jams,<br>
the present invention proposes to adopt the principle of<br>
distributing the processing power<br>
- as far as it is reasonable from the economical<br>
point of view - as much as possible onto the peripheral<br>
units CE and on the concentrators C-BT1 ... C-BTn, to such<br>
an extent as to make such units as autonomous as possible<br>
(even acting in "stand-alone" conditions in case of<br>
interruption on the communication lines, or giving up part<br>
of the functional performances, if necessary). By acting<br>
in this way, it has been achieved to weigh as less as<br>
possible on the communication systems, by actually<br>
transferring merely the "processed data", rather than the<br>
entire amount of elementary data, and thereby obtaining<br>
some important results, such as:<br>
- a simplification of the processings required for<br>
the central server;<br>
- a reduced communication load;<br>
- the availability of considerable amounts of useful<br>
band for the purpose of supporting any eventual additional<br>
services.<br>
The principle that has lead to the achievement of the<br>
present invention may find its origin in the fact of<br>
having reproduced a virtual (but totally faithful) image<br>
of the electricity meter CE inside the concentrator C-BT.<br>
Virtually, it is as if in the concentrator there existed<br>
an "alias" of the electricity meter, which is continuously<br>
updated by the concentrator in a predetermined manner, by<br>
withdrawing data from the actual electricity meter (such<br>
data being processed autonomously or following controls<br>
being received). This image electricity meter is thus, in<br>
actual fact, constantly available on the concentrator for<br>
the transactions and the exchange of data, or for<br>
receiving controls and/or programs from the server.<br>
This set-up allows furthermore to use in "stand-<br>
alone" conditions both the single electricity meter CE and<br>
the area units Al ... An formed by the single concentrator<br>
C-BT and by the electricity meters CE of the area unit<br>
controlled thereby; thus, without the supervision of the<br>
server in real time but, for example, through a periodic<br>
reading of the data from the concentrator by means of a<br>
portable terminal.<br>
To obtain this result, a further structural feature<br>
of the system thus formed lies in the fact that each of<br>
the meters CE incorporates, as well as means to measure<br>
the power consumptions, substantially known per se, also<br>
- means to transduce the measured values into<br>
measuring data meant to be processed,<br>
- at least a first processor to process said<br>
measuring data,<br>
- at least a first data memory and a first programme<br>
memory, and<br>
- first means for the bi-directional transmission<br>
towards the associated concentrator,<br>
- the output of said first processor being connected<br>
to said first data memory and/or to said first bi-<br>
directional transmission means, so as to at least<br>
temporarily store and/or respectively transmit the<br>
data, which has already undergone a first<br>
processing.<br>
Likewise, each concentrator incorporates<br>
- at least a second programme memory,<br>
- at least a second microprocessor for further<br>
processing said data processed by the meters,<br>
- at least a second data memory to store the data<br>
issued by said meters and/or by said second<br>
microprocessor,<br>
- and second means for the bi-directional<br>
transmission towards the central server,<br>
the output of said second processor being connected<br>
to said second data memory and/or to said second bi-<br>
directional transmission means, so as to at least<br>
temporarily store and/or respectively transmit said<br>
further processed data.<br>
The connection, for the transmission of data, between<br>
the meters CE and the concentrators C-BT is preferably<br>
obtained through wave transmission systems, using the same<br>
power supply conductors that connect the meters CE to the<br>
low voltage power supply substations, e.g. the secondary<br>
substations, where the concentrators C-BT are positioned.<br>
Whereas, the connection between the concentrators C-BTl ...<br>
C-BTn and the central server AMM is obtained, by<br>
preference, through a telephone network, whether it is a<br>
specific or a general-purpose network. A very suitable<br>
telephone network for this purpose would be the GSM or any<br>
other public mobile telephone network or any other<br>
existing wireless public telephone network, e.g., a<br>
satellite based wireless telephone network. If such a<br>
network is employed, it is advantageous to establish dial<br>
up connections between the concentrator C-BT and the<br>
central server AMM on demand or according to a schedule<br>
which can be predefined or dependent on an operating<br>
condition of the concentrator C-BT or the central server<br>
AMM.<br>
If a predefined schedule is adopted, the AMM or the<br>
C-BT will try to establish a connection between the AMM<br>
and the C-BT at predetermined times during a day, week or<br>
month, at which times it can be assumed that a certain<br>
amount of data or commands which require to be<br>
transmitted, has been collected and buffered in the<br>
concentrator and/or in the AMM, respectively. If the<br>
schedule is dependent on an operating condition of the AMM<br>
and/or the C-BT, a dial up connection will be established<br>
as soon as a certain amount of data and/or commands which<br>
require transmission, have been collected or if certain<br>
alarm conditions have been detected which require to be<br>
reported without delay. In any case, after the data and/or<br>
commands have been transmitted, the connection is<br>
terminated.<br>
With a structure of the system thus conceived, the<br>
respective measuring - which also forms an important<br>
characteristic of the present invention - ends up by being<br>
strictly tied to the functions which each of the three<br><br>
components of the system should perform.<br>
In particular, each electricity me.ter of the system<br>
according to the invention is dimensioned so that said<br>
first processor incorporated therein is apt to perform at<br>
least the functions of: (1) acquisition of the electric<br>
energy consumptions, (5) distribution of the power<br>
consumptions into different scales of charges, (12)<br>
estimate of the tampering attempts and control of an<br>
antifraud device, (25) transfer and maintenance of the<br>
stored data at least during the voltage drop.<br>
Likewise, each concentrator of the system according<br>
to the invention is dimensioned so that said second<br>
processor incorporated therein is apt to perform, as well<br>
as the double function of master of the PLC (power line<br>
carrier) network, for what concerns the communications on<br>
the power supply line between the actual concentrator and<br>
the electricity meters and, respectively, of node of the<br>
TLC network, for what concerns the communications on the<br>
telephone line between the concentrator and the central<br>
server, at least the following additional functions: (11)<br>
execution of an energy balance for what concerns the<br>
single cabin of electric energy supply into which the<br>
concentrator is positioned, (14) constant monitoring of<br>
the working conditions of each electricity meter connected<br>
thereto and issue of an alarm signal in case the self-<br>
diagnostics of the meter should indicate a malfunction.<br>
Finally, the server or central unit of the system<br>
according to the invention is dimensioned so that its<br><br>
processor is apt to guarantee at least the following<br>
functions: (8) automatic control of the operations of<br>
disconnection, reconnection, suspension, delayed payments<br>
and contract variations, (10) selective cut-off of the<br>
power supply due to requirements of the electric system,<br>
and (2 6) downloading of the operating programs.<br>
A more complete list - to be however considered as a<br>
non-limiting example - of the functions which the system<br>
according to the present invention is apt to perform, can<br>
be summed up in the following points, wherein an initial<br>
brief definition is followed by a more detailed<br>
explanation of the function connected therewith:<br>
1. Measurement and acquisition of the electric energy<br>
consumptions. The known type electromechanical<br>
electricity meters, adopted in the present power<br>
consumption system, are apt to measure only one<br>
type of electric energy consumption, active or<br>
reactive; if both measurements are required, it is<br>
hence necessary to install two distinct electricity<br>
meters. The electronic electricity meter according<br>
to the present invention is instead apt to<br>
simultaneously measure both the active energy<br>
consumptions and the reactive energy consumptions.<br>
2. Accuracy rating. According to standards, the<br>
electricity meter measures in class 1 for the<br>
active energy and in class 2 for the reactive<br>
energy.<br>
3. Acquisition and registration of the consumptions<br>
profile. For each user it is possible to detect the<br>
charging curve, with a programmable integration<br>
period, particularly in the range from 1 minute to<br>
1 hour. Thanks to the processing capacity of the<br>
electricity meter it is possible to reckon the<br>
elapse of consecutive time intervals and, for each<br>
of them, to memorize the power consumption inside<br>
the same.<br>
4 . Measurement and recording of the average and peak<br>
power. The electromechanical electricity meters<br>
normally used in the power consumption system are<br>
apt to measure only one type of power, active or<br>
reactive; if both measurements are required, it is<br>
hence necessary to install two electricity meters,<br>
as already mentioned for the electric energy<br>
consumptions. The electronic electricity meter<br>
according to the present invention is instead apt<br>
to simultaneously measure both the active power and<br>
the reactive power.<br>
5. Distribution of the electric energy consumptions<br>
into different scales of charges. Thanks to its<br>
processing capacity, the electricity meter is apt<br>
to establish a table of different time scales in<br>
the space of a day, thereby making it possible to<br>
set out for each of them a respective cost value<br>
for the electric energy used up. The electricity<br>
meter is thus apt to integrate the consumptions<br>
with reference to the table of costs and to<br>
memorize, in the invoicing period, the total<br>
consumption of each time scale. In addition to<br>
this, said table of costs can be programmed not<br>
only on the basis of time profiles but also on the<br>
basis of power thresholds.<br>
6. Control of several invoicing periods. It is<br>
possible to control at least two invoicing periods<br>
(present and previous), also at variable intervals.<br>
7. Control of two electric energy supply contracts. In<br>
the power range up to 35 kw, it is possible to<br>
control two electric energy supply contracts,<br>
namely an existing contract and the one to be<br>
applied in future. The electricity meter can be<br>
programmed to automatically switch over the<br>
contract - from the present one to the future one -<br>
upon reaching of a given date.<br>
8. Control of the operations of disconnection and<br>
reconnection. These operations can be carried out<br>
automatically in relation to situations of<br>
discontinuance, suspension for delayed payments,<br>
contract variations. Thanks to its processing<br>
capacity, the electricity meter carries out these<br>
operations on the basis of remote controls (from<br>
the central server or from the respective<br>
concentrator) through the PLC network. It is hence<br>
not necessary for an operator to physically go on<br>
the site where the electricity meter is installed.<br>
9. Possibility to operate in conditions of prepayment.<br>
The electricity meter can be programmed so as to<br>
compare the amount of electric energy used up with<br>
a preset limit (eventually apt to be modified by an<br>
external control) corresponding to a payment<br>
carried out in advance; as soon as said limit has<br>
been exceeded, the electric energy supply is<br>
automatically disconnected and suspended.<br>
10. Selective cut-off for requirements of the<br>
electric system. The cut-off or suspension of the<br>
power supply can be necessary, generally on a local<br>
level, in case of blackout risks or of temporary<br>
overloads. This function is not implemented in a<br>
broadcast mode, but it is instead specifically<br>
addressed to each single electricity meter. From<br>
the centre (central server or concentrator) it is<br>
possible to send to the electricity meters, via<br>
PLC, a control for example to modify the highest<br>
power available in the actual meter, with a<br>
temporary effect, that is with no need to alter the<br>
power supply contract; this allows to obtain a<br>
lightening of the overall power required from the<br>
cabin.<br>
11. Execution of an energy balance. At the level of a<br>
single cabin, or of a single concentrator, it is<br>
possible to do the sum of the measurements of the<br>
power consumption drawn from the single electricity<br>
meters depending from said cabin. This sum -<br>
periodically compared to the value of the total<br>
electric current withdrawn, or with the mean<br>
electric current value - supplies a useful<br>
indication to detect any non-standard electric<br>
current withdrawals and, therefore, also any<br>
unauthorized withdrawals.<br>
12. Antifraud/tampering function. At the level of<br>
each electricity meter, a device is provided to<br>
perform this specific function, which is thus apt<br>
to eliminate the requirement to use seals and to<br>
periodically check the integrity of such seals. The<br>
change of power, available by contract, does not<br>
require - as said - to open the electricity meter<br>
in order to adjust the measuring equipment (shunt);<br>
it has thus been possible to realize the<br>
electricity meter as a sealed single block<br>
structure containing all the functions of<br>
measurement, control of the contracts, control of<br>
the opening/closing circuit of the power line. For<br>
the purpose of checking any possible attempts to<br>
open the sealed structure in the electricity meter,<br>
an electromechanical device has thus been<br>
incorporated which produces an alarm signal on the<br>
network of the system and said alarm signal can be<br>
removed only by adopting a procedure available to<br>
the operators.<br>
13. Measuring and recording quality parameters of the<br>
service. The microprocessor incorporated in each<br>
electricity meter is apt to verify and memorize<br>
interruptions of electric energy supply and voltage<br>
variations (deviation of the voltage from the<br>
nominal value foreseen in the electric energy<br>
supply contract). On the basis of this data, it is<br>
possible to determine the quality parameters of the<br>
service at the level of each delivery point of the<br>
electric energy being supplied.<br>
14. Constant monitoring of the working conditions.<br>
The microprocessor incorporated in each electricity<br>
meter is apt to periodically verify (self-<br>
diagnostics) the conditions of the various hardware<br>
components of said meter and the congruency of the<br>
data stored in the memory. In case there should be<br>
any malfunctions, it is possible both to signal the<br>
same with appropriate service words (which are then<br>
read by the central system), and to start immediate<br>
recovery procedures.<br>
15. Possibility of bi-directional transmission of<br>
information. The system according to the invention<br>
allows not only to carry out operations directly<br>
connected to the supply of the service for which<br>
the system has been conceived, but also to send to<br>
the electricity meter and receive from the same<br>
other types of information ("information provider"<br>
service). The electricity meter can display such<br>
information on its own visual display unit, or else<br>
transfer it onto other devices connected to the<br>
electric line of the user, downstream of the<br>
electricity meter, or even draw it therefrom; such<br>
devices are directly interfaced with the<br>
electricity meter via PLC, or else through a<br>
bridge-device acting as an intermediate bridge and<br>
communicating directly with the electricity meter<br>
via PLC. This gives the possibility to other<br>
subjects to use the system according to the<br>
invention as a remote control system allowing to<br>
connect oneself to ones own devices at the user's<br>
site.<br>
16. Management of a calendar clock. Having allocated<br>
to the meter the calculation of consumptions as a<br>
function of the scale of charges, said meter<br>
requires a precise time reference (± 30 sec/month);<br>
this is obtained by means of local electronic<br>
circuitry (RealTimeClock), the state of which may<br>
be remotely verified and synchronised (through<br>
external controls, via PLC or optical gate ZVEI )<br>
and corrected, if need be, in case of excessive<br>
variations.<br>
17. Set of displayable data. On the local display of<br>
the meter (for example of the 16x1 alphanumeric +<br>
icons type), a whole series of data may be<br>
programmed. The presence of electronic components<br>
allows to provide additional functions such as<br>
locally displaying to the user consumptions and<br>
costs data, generic messages or messages providing<br>
information about the service, or indicating the<br>
functional state of said meter to the service staff<br>
(diagnostics).<br>
18. Opening the power circuit. A modular element<br>
equipped with a suitable releasing element apt to<br>
be opened by remote control is integrated into the<br>
meter. A single box hosts both the electronic<br>
components apt to perform the meter functions<br>
described so far, and the electromechanical<br>
components apt to open/close the electrical power<br>
line. This way, the electromechanical components,<br>
besides operating autonomously at the highest<br>
power, may also be directed on request of the<br>
central unit or in the presence of local conditions<br>
detected by the electronic part (e.g. when the<br>
contract expires).<br>
19. Quick installation of the meter. Having to<br>
replace a high number of devices at users'<br>
locations in a short time, the invention provides a<br>
meter group in two parts, namely a wedge as a base<br>
and a controlling and managing body, the two parts<br>
being connectable through connecting pliers and a<br>
bayonet joint.<br>
20. Local interconnectability with external devices.<br>
The PLC communication system requires the<br>
availability of complex hardware and software<br>
means. In order to guarantee both the accessibility<br>
of the data contained in the concentrators and<br>
meters even by simple devices (e.g. handheld PCs)<br>
available to a user, and the availability of a<br>
second communication line substituting the network<br>
in case the latter is interrupted; an optical ZVEI<br>
gate is also associated to the meter. Said gate<br>
only requires the external device to have a simple<br>
RS-232 serial gate (available in almost every PC).<br>
21. Safety/protection of the PLC communication. The<br>
data transferred from the concentrator to the<br>
meters or from the latter to the central server<br>
have different privacy degrees. For those not<br>
considered highly reserved, the protection<br>
mechanisms implemented by the functions managing<br>
the PLC communication protocol, apt to guarantee<br>
the delivery of the messages, is sufficient. For<br>
critical data, an additional mechanism has been<br>
added - e.g. based on an authentication key - at<br>
the level of message interpreting and managing<br>
procedure, apt to guarantee the non-modifiability<br>
and/or readability of said messages by third<br>
parties outside the service.<br>
22. Automatic recognition of the installation of the<br>
meter. This function must be present for two<br>
reasons: one is technical, related to the PLC<br>
communication mechanisms, the other is fiscal, in<br>
order to detect potential fraud by users.<br>
23. Distant meters reachability. The PLC<br>
communication method uses a physical support<br>
(electric line) that does not guarantee homogeneous<br>
conduction of the signal in every point of the<br>
network, for which reason meters may not be<br>
reachable by the concentrator. Therefore, the<br>
concentrator may require one or more meters (which<br>
are able "see" the non-reachable meter) to act as<br>
bridges, forwarding the message, to the non-<br>
reachable meter. It is indeed a repetition<br>
mechanism, which allows to solve the problem of<br>
reachability via network.<br>
24. Automatic recognition of the repetition path.<br>
When informed of the presence of a new meter, the<br>
concentrator checks its reachability. If it is not<br>
reachable, it tries to detect one or more different<br>
meters that can "see" the non-directly reachable<br>
meter. These meters are detected, the detecting<br>
parameters stored, and then subsequently used as an<br>
intermediate bridge.<br>
25. Data maintenance in voltage drop conditions. The<br>
substitution of the mechanical devices recording<br>
the consumption (numbered knob) v/ith electronic<br>
components (volatile memories) would imply the loss<br>
of the consumption data if the power from the<br>
providing company were interrupted. In order to<br>
avoid this, a non-volatile memory, preferably a<br>
ferro electric RAM (FRAM), has been used in the<br>
system, apt to guarantee the maintenance of the<br>
data throughout the useful life of the electricity<br>
meter (15 years).<br>
26. Downloading the managing programmes. In order to<br>
guarantee the developing and/or corrective<br>
maintenance of the functions performed by the<br>
programs installed in the system devices, it is<br>
possible to modify said programs without<br>
interrupting the fundamental activities of said<br>
devices and without having to go where they are;<br>
the activity is performed using the PLC<br>
communication mechanisms used by the control centre<br>
to manage the devices.<br>
27. Detection of the line switch opening. When one of<br>
the output lines from the power supply cabin -<br>
where the concentrator is - is out of order due to<br>
the opening of the line protection switch, the<br>
concentrator, on the basis of the failure to<br>
communicate with all the meters supplied by that<br>
line, indicates to the central server an out-of-<br>
service line alarm condition.<br>
It is however understood that this list should not be<br>
intended as limiting the scope of the invention. This<br>
description intends to highlight by way of examples how<br>
the main functions are distributed between the three<br>
components (meters, concentrators and central unit) of the<br>
system according to the invention, considered the<br>
functional abilities of these three components, as better<br>
specified hereinafter and in the claims.<br>
In other words, in order to achieve the basic idea of<br>
the present invention, synthetically indicated as<br>
"intelligence allocation", it is preferable that:<br>
a) the meters be at least allocated at least one of<br>
the functions indicated at numbers 1), 5), 12) and 25);<br>
but also, preferably, the functions indicated at numbers<br>
2), 3), 4), 6), 7) 12), 13), 16), 17) 18, 19), 20) and 25)<br>
are performed in the meters;<br>
b) the meters be able to manage, together with the<br>
concentrators and the server, also at least one of the<br>
functions indicated at numbers 9), 14), 15), 21), 22), 23)<br>
and 26);<br>
c) the concentrators be at least allocated at least<br>
one of the functions indicated at numbers 11) and 14), as<br>
well as those of PLC network master and TLC network node,<br>
but also, preferably, the functions indicated at numbers<br>
20) and 24) are performed in concentrators;<br>
d) the central server be at least allocated one or<br>
more of the functions indicated at numbers 8), 10), 17)<br>
and 26), but the function indicated at numbers 9) and 21)<br>
is also preferably performed in the central server, as<br>
well as the function, of course, of TLC network master,<br>
and other potential invoicing and managing functions (not<br>
concerning this patent application).<br>
In other words, the intelligence of the system is<br>
distributed between the central unit, concentrators and<br>
meters so that each of these three elements of the system<br>
has its own processing ability, although limited as<br>
regards the meters, but sufficient in order to relevantly<br>
reduce the requirements of data transmission through bi-<br>
directional transmission; these requirements being<br>
limited, on the one hand, by the reduction of the quantity<br>
of transmitted data or, on the other hand, by the delay of<br>
their transmission to times when the transmission lines<br>
are less busy.<br>
It is however understood that the invention should<br>
not be intended as limited to the particular arrangement<br>
illustrated above, which only represents an exemplary<br>
embodiment thereof, but that also different alternatives<br>
are possible, all within the grasp of an expert in the<br>

thereof, as defined by the following claims.<br>
