The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
ORIGINAL<br>
659/MUMNP/04                          11 MAY 2007                    11-5-2007<br><br>
Simplified device for magnetically operating blinds within a glass-enclosed chamber<br>
The invention concerns devices for operating blinds placed inside a<br>
glass-enclosed chamber.	<br>
It is a well-known fact that much heat is lost from within residential.<br>
buildings through the glass panes of windows and french windows<br>
but that such dispersion can be greatly reduced by fitting double<br>
glazing with a hermetically sealed chamber between the panes.<br>
The presence of a blind, including the Venetian or pleated types,<br>
inside the glass-enclosed chamber leads to complications because of<br>
the need to work it from outside without interfering with the hermetic<br>
seal.<br>
Various   operating   systems   have   been   devised   and   applied<br>
connecting interrnal and external kinematic mechanisms by lines of<br>
magnetic forces acting through one of the panes.<br>
Such devices are however substantially complex and costly.<br>
The chief complications concern the need to ensure that, when<br>
moving, the various parts of the blind remain parallel one to another.<br>
Use of an interna) eiectric motor greatiy increases costs because of<br>
the need for reduction mechanisms.<br><br><br>
Purely mechanical controls from outside, such as cords, create<br>
problems due to the tendency to slippage between internal and<br>
external mechanisms connected by magnetic forces.<br>
The above invention avoids these drawbacks ensuring smooth<br>
internal   and   external   movements   of   the   blind   by   magnetic<br>
connections adopting an ingeneous solution consisting of simple and<br>
inexpensive means as will now be explained.<br>
Subject of the invention is a system for operating a blind inside a<br>
glass-enclosed chamber comprising two panes, a frame formed of<br>
four sections, one upper and one lower, and two side sections, ail<br>
held together by four pieces, one at each corner.<br>
One immovable end of the blind- is mounted onto afixed box, here<br>
called the upper box, fixed to the upper part of the frame, while the<br>
other end -of the blind is fixed to a movable box, moved by a device<br>
acting through one pane of glass and controlled by a device for<br>
guiding translation of said mobile box, paraflel to itself, in the<br>
operations of opening and closing the blind whatever the spatial<br>
position of the gjass chamber may..be.<br>
The device for moving the movable box comprises two means, acting<br>
as a pair, for creating magnetic attraction.<br>
The first means is. fixed.to the movable box, while the second<br>
consists of a free knob.<br>
By making said knob match with the means fixed to the movable box<br>
and moving it by hand, the blind can be opened and closed as<br>
desired.<br>
The   means   fixed   to  the   movable   box  consists   of  a   small<br>
parallelepiped box, inserted longitudinally at the centre of said<br>
movable box,  inside which  is a cage containing one or  more<br>
permanent magnets, placed side by side longitudinally between two<br>
sets of freely moving rollers with longitudinal pins.<br>
The rollers project slightly from the geometrical plane that passes<br>
through the external surface of said permanent magnets, and from<br><br>
the front of the movable box so that the first means can slide more<br>
easily over the glass.<br>
There are'preferably two rollers, parallel, in each set, their surface<br>
arching slightly to make brief contact with the glass.<br>
The knob forming the second means, is substantially parallepiped in<br>
shape   and   houses   one   or   more   permanent   magnets   placed<br>
longitudinally side by side, their pole being opposite to that of the<br>
permanent magnets in the first means, said magnets being covered<br>
by a thin coating of material such as teflon, velcro and the like so that<br>
they can slide more easily over the glass.<br>
Thin metal plates are applied to the bottom of the first means and of<br>
the knob for holding the magnets.<br>
. The guiding device consists of a pair of interacting cords. The first cord, fixed close to a first end of the fixed box, extends, even through the blind, as far as the movable box, passes below a first internal crosswise roller, turning close to the first end of said movable box, extends as far as the second end of this latter, passes over a second crosswise terminal roller and is then fixed, to the second end of a box, here called the lower box, mounted on the lower section of the frame.<br>
The second cord, fixed close to the second end of the fixed box, extends, even through the blind, as far as the movable box, passes under a third internal crosswise roller, turning close to the second end of said movable box, extends as far as the first end of said movable box, passes round a fourth terminal crosswise roller and is<br>
• fixed to the first end of the'lower box. In this way, movement of the movable box to open or close the blind, simultaneously produces a variation in length of the first sections of the two cords that connect said movable box to the fixed box, and variation in length, equal and different, of the second sections of said cords connecting said movable box to the fixed box. The mobile box therefore moves parallel to itself.<br><br>
If the blinds are wide, a second pair of cords is fitted to the fixed box.<br>
The lengths that connect said second pair of cords to the movable<br>
box are placed intermediately in relation to the lengths of the first pair<br>
of cords, and are guided by other intermediate rollers.<br>
The lengths that connect said second pair of cords to the lower fixed<br>
box are guided by the same rollers, at the ends of said movable box,<br>
that serve to guide the first pair of cords.<br>
The ends of the cords are fixed one to each end of the lower fixed<br>
box by elastic parts that automatically adjust variations in length<br>
caused by thermal and mechanical stresses.<br>
The elastic parts are advantageously helical springs mounted on<br>
heads fixed to the ends of the lower box and having grooves in which<br>
the cords can pass.<br>
One end of ead cord .passes.inside.said springs and is fixed to their<br>
end.<br>
The four parts of the frame are tubular, the tube having a constant<br>
cross section.<br>
The side of said tube facing-towards-the-inside-of the-frame, is flat.<br>
At each end of each corner piece are extensions with elastic teeth to<br>
press inside the ends of the tubular parts.<br>
Shape of the cross section of the upper and lower fixed boxes is that<br>
of a squared 'U', the flat side facing towards the tubular sections of<br>
the frame.<br>
The ends of the straight sides of said "U" are bent hookwise facing<br>
the opposite way, while at the two longitudinal ends of the flat side of<br>
tubular parts of the frame are hooks facing towards each other.<br>
Sizes and positions of these hooks are such as to permit the fixed<br>
upper and lower boxes to be mounted onto the tubular sections of<br>
the frame by pressing the hooks on the boxes into those on said<br>
tubular sections.<br>
Shape  of the constant  cross  section  of the  movable box  is<br>
substantially that of a squared "U" comprising a crosswise diaphragm<br><br><br>
forming an internal groove and also a squared "U'-shaped channel<br>
open towards the blind.<br>
Light-shading tabs are mounted on the internally-facing edges of the<br>
flat sides of the frame's side sections.<br>
Light-shading tabs are also mounted on the edge, corresponding to<br>
the outside of the glass-enclosed chamber, of the fixed boxes' flat<br>
side.<br>
The rollers inside the movable box, around which the guide cords<br>
pass, are preferably supported by internal heads fitted inside the<br>
channel open towards the upper fixed box.<br>
The-terminal rollers are supported by heads applied to the ends of<br>
said movable box by tongues in both the open channe) and   the<br>
internal channel.<br>
The cords pass inside grooves rnade-for -them- in all  the heads<br>
referred to above.<br>
In one type of execution the blind is pleated. Where this is so, on its<br>
flat back facing the blind, the upper fixed box presents a pair of ribs<br>
forming a pair of opposing channelsr<br>
Similarly, at the ends of the open channel, the movable box presents<br>
a pair of ribs forming a pair of opposing channels.<br>
In this way the two ends of the pleated blind can be fitted into said<br>
pairs of opposing channels of both the upper fixed box and of the<br>
movable box<br>
The blind can be a roller blind, a Venetian blind, or of any other kind.<br>
The invention offers evident advantages.<br>
By associating the pulling device with the guiding device the blind<br>
can be opened or closed through one pane of the glass-enclosed<br>
chamber, this being done by means that are at once inexpensive,<br>
safe and easy to operate.<br>
The guiding device solves a universal problem of translating a<br>
mechanical device parallel to itself.<br><br><br>
As translation is done using cords, these can be pulled at a distance<br>
so that there is no limit to the size of the object to translate, in this<br>
case a blind.<br>
The cords do not need straight guides and provide a valid substitute<br>
for present  mechanical  paralleiogramic systems that are  both<br>
complex and bulky.<br>
The parallel translation described makes possible adoption of an<br>
extremely simple and safe pulling device limited exclusively to its use<br>
at practically any point on the movable box to which the blind is fixed,<br>
avoiding all the complications created by presently used devices for<br>
pulling and guiding.<br>
By means of the magnetic connection, manual action can be applied<br>
directly to the blind while preserving the hermeticity of the glass-<br>
enclosed chamber.<br>
The invention described provides an inexpensive, simple and reliable<br>
glass-enclosed chamber certain to become popular with users. . Characteristics and purposes of the disclosure will be made still<br>
clearer by  the following..examples of its execution illustrated by<br>
diagrammatically drawn figures.<br>

The glass-enclosed chamber 10 comprises the structure 15 and the<br>
glass panes 17,18.<br>
The structure 15 consists of a frame 20 composed of tubular<br>
sections, upper 25, lower 26 and lateral sections 27; held together by<br>
comer pieces 30.<br>
The tubular sections 25-27 present a cross-cut formed of association<br>
of'a trapezoidal'topand-aTectahgalar-baser'<br>
Each corner piece 30 comprises terminal heads 32 with    lower<br>
elastically-toothed inwardly-inclined extensions 33, and the corner<br>
joint 31.<br>
The cross-cut of "said heads 32 xorrepondsto that ofthetrapezoidal<br>
top of the tubular section while the lower extension with inclined teeth<br>
corresponds to the rectangular base of said cross-cut of the tubular<br>
sections.<br>
The four sections 25-27 and the comer pieces 30 are put together by<br>
pressing the heads 32 of these latter into the ends of the sections.<br>
The stresses set up by the inclined teeth of the extension 33 are<br>
sufficient to hold the structure firm.<br>
The structure 15 of the glass-enclosed chamber 10 comprises the<br>
upper 40 and lower 50 fixed boxes having U-shaped cross-cuts, their<br>
ends being bent back to form outward-facing hooks, respectively 41<br>
and 51.<br>
At the ends of their fiat bases, the sections 25 and 26 present two<br>
ribs with inward-facing hooks 38.<br><br><br>
Said boxes 40 and 50 can therefore be snap-mounted respectively<br>
onto the sections 25 and 26, as illustrated in Figures 8 and 5.<br>
In Figure 8 the hooks 51 on box 50 are about to be fitted trogether<br>
with the hooks 38 on section 26.<br>
In Figure 5 the hooks 41 on box 40 have been fitted into the hooks<br>
38 on section 25.<br>
The above boxes 40 and 50 respectively present light-shading tabs<br>
43 and 53; similarly the sections 27 present light-shading tabs 36.<br>
The pleated blind 180 is fitted onto the upper fixed box 40 (Figure 5)<br>
by insertion of its upper end 182 into the opposing grooves 46<br>
formed by ribs 45, and onto the movable box 50 (Figure 6) by<br>
insertion of its lower end 183 into the opposing grooves 66 formed by<br>
ribs 65.<br>
ThejTiovaWe_box_60„(FjgureJ&gt;) is .hungjpnto the upper fixed box 40<br>
guided by the lower fixed blind-guiding box 50, by means of a guiding<br>
device consisting of cords 85 and 86 (Figures 1 ,*3 and 9).<br>
The upper ends of said cords 85 and 86 are fixed to the upper box 40<br>
by.-knots.80-or-other,equi.valent.means.<br>
The lower ends of said cords are fixed to helical springs 140 and 141<br>
supported by heads 130, 131 respectively inserted into the two ends<br>
of-the- lower fixed--blindeguidtag.- box 50, and can slide inside<br>
cornerwise channels 135, as seen in Figure 9, marked E and F.<br>
In Figure 9 the upper 40, lower 50 and moveable 60 boxes are<br>
shown disgrammatically by axis lines (40), (50), (60).<br>
The heads 130 and 131 are inserted at the end of the box 50 by<br>
extensions 133 shaped according to the upper part 58 of said box 50<br>
marked off by the ribs 59 (Figure 8).<br>
The cords 85 and 86 are guided inside the movable box 60 by rollers<br>
94 and 95 with pins 96 in the internal heads 90, 91, and by rollers<br>
119 and 120 with pins 121 in the terminal heads 110 and 111 ( see<br>
Figure 9, details A-D).<br><br><br>
The internal heads 90, 91 are inserted in the channel 70 (Figure 6)<br>
created in the movable box 60 by the diaphragm 68.<br>
the terminal heads 110 and 111 are mounted at the ends of said<br>
movable box 60 by insertion of the two pairs of tabs 116 and 117<br>
(Figure 9,  detail  D)  inside the ends of channels 70 and 71<br>
respectively, created by the above diaphragm 68 (Figure 6).<br>
The cords 85 and 86 slide inside their respective grooves 100 and<br>
101 in the internal heads 90 and 91. .<br>
The cords 85 and 86 slide inside the grooves 123 in the terminal<br>
heads 110 and 111.<br>
The springs 140 and 141 automatically compensate any variations in<br>
length of the cords 85, 86 caused by thermal.and mechanical<br>
stresses.<br>
The„smalLmagnetic.box J 50_(Eigure. 4).and.the-,knob-170. (Figures 1<br>
and 2) together create a device for moving the box 60 to open and<br>
close the blind 180.<br>
This magnetic box 150 comprises a cage 155 with blocks 157 at its<br>
ends, Jot,housicig-the-two-pecmanent-magnets ~152 and 153.placed<br>
side by side and held in position by an internal metal plate 154.<br>
Said blocks 157 hold the four rollers 160 with rounded surfaces that<br>
freely turn on pins 161 in their slots 158.<br>
Said rollers 160 project slightly outward from the permanent magnets<br>
152, 153 which in turn project from the front of the box 60.<br>
The knob 170 presents a concave body 171  for housing the<br>
permanent magnets 172, 173 set side by side and held in place by<br>
an internal metal plate and by the ring 175 (Figures 1 and 2).<br>
A thin layer 177 of teflon, or some other slippery material, is laid on<br>
the outer face of said permanent magnets.<br>
With the parts placed as described above, on moving the knob 170<br>
on the glass pane 18 to the position of the small magnetic box 150,<br>
the pole of the permanent magnets 172, 173 being the opposite to<br>
that of the permanent magnets 152, 153 in said magnetic box,<br><br>
magnetic connection will be determined between the blind 180 and<br>
the knob 170.<br>
The rollers 160 in the small magnetic box 150 rest on the glass pane<br>
18 faciliating movement of the box 60 at the lower end of the blind<br>
180 in order to open or close said blind.<br>
As will be clearly seen in Figure 9, the cord 85, fixed close to a first<br>
end of the fixed box 40,  extends orthogonally passing through the<br>
blind 180 as far as the movable box 60, from there it passes below<br>
the roller 94 on the internal head 90 placed close to the first end of<br>
said box 60, extends as far as the second end of this latter and,<br>
passing over the roller 120 on. the terminal head 111, extends<br>
orthogonally as far as the second end of the fixed box 50 till, crossing<br>
the channel 135 in the terminal head 131, it becomes attached to the<br>
spring 141.<br>
The cord 86, fixed close to the second end of the fixed box 40,<br>
extends orthogonally through the blind 180 as far as the movable box<br>
60, from there it passes under the roller 95 in the internal head 91<br>
placed close to„.the second.end.of .said..box-60,.extends_as.far,asthe<br>
first end of this latter and, passing over the roller 119 in the terminal<br>
head 110, extends orthogonally as far as the first end of the fixed box<br>
50 where it is-attached to the-spring-140 mounted on the terminal<br>
head 130.<br>
While determining, by means of the knob 170, movement of the box<br>
60 for opening or closing the blind 180, this at the same time causes<br>
a variation in the length of the initial sections of cords 85' and 86',<br>
and a variation, equal and contrary, in the length of the end sections<br>
85" and 86" of the cords 85 and 86.<br>
It follows that any movement of said movable box 60, in guiding the<br>
pair of said cords 85 and 86, is made parallel to itself.<br>
In the case of a very wide blind, four cords (Figure 10) are used to<br>
support and guide it, done by adding to those 85 and 86 already<br><br><br>
mentioned, cords 87and 88 respectively connected to springs 142<br>
and 143 as seen in Figure 10.<br>
To make cords 87, 88 slide, a second pair of internal heads with<br>
rollers 97 and 98 are used.<br>
As a consequence, in the terminal heads 110 and 11 on the movable<br>
