				<td>APPARATUS AND METHOD FOR DETERMINING<br>
THE STATE OF BANKNOTES<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for determining the<br>
state of bank notes.<br>
[0002] Determining the state of bank notes is of great importance, since bank notes<br>
are divided up on the basis of the determined state into bank notes whose state is so<br>
good that these bank notes are suitable for further circulation and bank notes whose<br>
state is so bad that these bank notes are no longer suitable for further circulation. In<br>
bank note processing machines, determination of the state of bank notes is normally<br>
carried out by means of sensors that detect data representing certain properties of bank<br>
notes to be checked. From the properties such as soiling, spots, tears, holes, limpness, <br>
etc., the state of the bank notes can be determined.<br>
[0003] In known methods and apparatuses, determination of the state of bank notes<br>
to be checked is done by threshold value comparisons of the data detected for the indi-<br>
vidual properties by the sensors. If the detected data are below the given threshold val-<br>
ues for the individual properties, the state of the particular bank note is classified as<br>
good. If the detected data are above one or more of the given threshold values, the<br>
state of the particular bank note is classified as bad. Determination of the state of the<br>
bank notes is thus based on an evaluation of the data of each sensor or each property to<br>
be checked in isolation, i.e. independently of the data of the other sensors or proper-<br>
ties.<br>
[0004] It has turned out, however, that determination of the state of bank notes to be<br>
checked on the basis of an isolated evaluation of the individual data of each sensor or<br>
property can lead to unsatisfactory results. If a bank note has for example a certain<br>
soiling that is altogether below the given threshold value for permissible soiling, and if<br>
moreover spots are present on the bank note that are for their part likewise below the<br>
given threshold value for permissible spots, the state of the bank note will be classified<br>
as good in the known method and apparatus. Due to the actual appearance of the bank<br>
note with soiling and spots, however, a viewer would classify the state of the bank<br>
note as altogether bad, so that determination of the state of the bank note by known<br>
apparatuses and methods is unsatisfactory.<br>
[0005] It is therefore the problem of the present invention to specify a method and<br>
apparatus for determining the state of bank notes that permit improved determination<br>
of the state of bank notes.<br>
[0006] This problem is solved according to the invention by the features of claims 1<br>
and 6.<br>
[0007] The invention starts out from a determination of the state of bank notes by<br>
which data of at least two different properties of the bank notes are evaluated, the data]<br>
of the at least two different properties of each bank note being linked with each othe<br>
and the state of the bank note derived from the linked data of the different properties<br>
[0008] The invention thus has in particular the advantage that the linkage of the<br>
properties characteristic of the state of the bank notes obtains an essential improve-<br>
ment in determination of state, since all properties important for the state of the bank<br>
notes are judged jointly, so that properties overlapping and/or influencing each other<br>
are no longer judged singly in isolation, but taken into account in the determination of<br>
the state of the bank notes in the way they influence the actual appearance of the bank<br>
notes.<br>
[0009] Further advantages of the present invention can be found in the dependent<br>
claims and the following description of an embodiment with reference to a figure.<br>
[0010] The single figure shows a schematic representation of a basic structure of an<br>
apparatus for determining the state of bank notes.<br>
[0011] Figure 1 shows a schematic representation of a basic structure of an appara-<br>
tus 10 for determining the state of bank notes.<br>
[0012] The apparatus 10 for determining the state of bank notes is formed as a bank<br>
note processing machine and has an input pocket 20 for inputting bank notes 21 to be<br>
processed, which is engaged by a singler 22. The singler 22 grasps one of the bank<br>
notes 21 to be processed at a time and transfers the single bank note to a transport sys-<br>
tem 23 which transports the single bank note through a sensor assembly 30.<br>
[0013] The sensor assembly 30 has sensors 31, 32, 33, for example a first optical<br>
sensor 31 which detects light remitted by the bank note, a second acoustic sensor 33<br>
which detects ultrasonic signals coming from, in particular transmitted by, the bank<br>
note, and a third optical sensor 32 which detects light transmitted by the bank note.<br>
The sensors 31, 32, 33 perform measurements for determining the state of the bank<br>
notes by which they detect properties of each individual bank note and produce corre-<br>
sponding data. For this purpose the sensors 31, 32, 33 detect the bank notes with a cer-<br>
tain resolution resulting in a pixel size with which the bank notes are scanned and de-<br>
tected.<br>
[0014] From the detected pixels of each of the bank notes, data representing each<br>
place on the surface of the particular bank note are formed by the sensors 31, 32, 33<br>
and/or a control device 35. Production of the data can be effected e.g. for one side of<br>
the bank notes, i.e. for one of the surfaces of the bank notes, or both surfaces can be<br>
detected and corresponding data provided. Preferably, the sides or surfaces of the bank<br>
notes are each detected completely and corresponding data produced for the complete<br>
side or surface.<br>
[0015] From the data of the sensors 31, 32, 33 the control device 35 derives proper-<br>
ties relevant for checking the bank notes. These properties characterize the state of the<br>
bank notes, such as soiling, spots, limpness, tears, adhesive tape, dog-ears, holes, miss-<br>
ing parts of the bank notes, etc. The particular properties can be derived for example<br>
from the data of one or more of the sensors 31, 32, 33.<br>
[0016] In the control device 35 the data of the sensors 31, 32, 33 are processed and<br>
compared with reference data stored in the control device 35, whereupon the control<br>
device 35 determines the state of the bank notes.<br>
[0017] On the basis of the check of the particular bank note carried out by the con-<br>
trol device 35, diverters 24, 26 disposed in the transport system 23 are driven, e.g. to<br>
deposit bank notes in good state in an output pocket 25, whereas bank notes in bad<br>
state can be deposited in an output pocket 27 or fed via the transport system 23 to fur-<br>
ther processing 28, e.g. destruction by means of a shredder.<br>
[0018] As mentioned above, properties characterizing the state of the bank notes are<br>
derived from the data of the sensors 31, 32, 33. The individual properties and their<br>
derivation from the data of the sensors 31, 32, 33 will be explained more closely here-<br>
inafter.<br>
[0019] Soiling of the bank notes is characterized by picking up the remission, pri-<br>
marily in unprinted areas of the bank notes. A measure of the soiling of the bank notes<br>
can thus be derived by the control device 35 from the data of the sensor 31 for exam-<br>
ple. The control device 35 can advantageously form an average for the remission val-<br>
ues and/or the variance of the remission values.<br>
[0020] Spots on the bank notes can be characterized by their surface area and/or the<br>
color contrast with the background. The surface area can be determined by the control<br>
device 35 for example by counting the above-described pixels of the sensor 31 that are<br>
covered by spots.<br>
[0021] Limpness of the bank notes is characterized by their flexural stiffness.<br>
Limpness can be determined e.g. by evaluation of the signals of the ultrasonic sensor<br>
33 by the control device 35, since ultrasound is scattered diffusely by limp bank notes.<br>
[0022] Tears in the bank notes can be recognized by means of the sensor 32 which<br>
detects light transmitted by the bank notes. For characterizing the state of the bank<br>
notes, the control device 35 can determine for example the number of tears or the total<br>
length of the tears from the data of the sensor 32, in particular by counting the pixels.<br>
[0023] Adhesive tape on the bank notes can be recognized by means of the sensor<br>
31 which detects light remitted by the bank notes, the acoustic sensor 33 also being<br>
suitable. For characterizing the state of the bank notes, the control device 35 can de-<br>
termine for example the number of pieces of adhesive tape or the total length or total<br>
area of the pieces of adhesive tape from the data of the sensor 31 or 33, in particular by<br>
counting the pixels.<br>
[0024] Dog-ears in the bank notes can be recognized by means of the sensor 32<br>
which detects light transmitted by the bank notes. For characterizing the state of the<br>
bank notes, the control device 35 can determine for example the number of dog-ears or<br>
the total area of the dog-ears from the data of the sensor 32, in particular by counting<br>
the pixels.<br>
[0025] Holes in the bank notes can be recognized by means of the sensor 32 which<br>
detects light transmitted by the bank notes. For characterizing the state of the bank<br>
notes, the control device 35 can determine for example the number of holes or the total<br>
area of the holes from the data of the sensor 32, in particular by counting the pixels.<br>
[0026] Missing parts, e.g. security thread, hologram, etc., can likewise be recog-<br>
nized by one or more of the sensors 31, 32, 33. For characterizing the state of the bank<br>
notes, the control device 35 can determine for example the number of missing parts or<br>
the total area of missing parts from the data of the one or more sensors 31, 32, 33.<br>
[0027] The above-described determination of the state of the bank notes by the con-<br>
trol device 35 is brought about by the linkage of two or more of the ascertained and<br>
above-specified different properties of the bank notes. For this purpose, the individual<br>
different properties are each assigned a certain value characterizing the state. For ex-<br>
ample, a certain soiling is assigned a certain value. However, the same certain value<br>
can also be assigned to one or all other properties, so that e.g. a certain number of<br>
spots, a certain limpness, a certain number of tears, pieces of adhesive tape, dog-ears,<br>
holes, missing parts of the bank note, etc., is also assigned the certain value. The indi-<br>
vidual values are linked, for example by means of a linear combination. For determin-<br>
ing the state of the bank notes, the control device 35 then compares the linear combi-<br>
nation of the properties characterizing the state of the bank notes with a given value<br>
and decides for example whether the state of the bank notes is good or bad, i.e.<br>
whether they are fit for circulation or not. This permits a bank note that already has<br>
considerable soiling but in isolation not enough to result in the state of the bank note<br>
being determined as bad, to be determined as bad if the bank note additionally has e.g.<br>
only a few spots and/or tears, etc.<br>
[0028] Obviously, a weighting can be carried out in the linear combination of the<br>
properties and/or the assignment of the values characterizing the state of the bank<br>
notes to the individual properties. Certain properties, e.g. tears or holes in the bank<br>
notes, may be weighted more strongly than other, less disturbing properties, e.g. dog-<br>
ears or spots. It is likewise obvious that other mathematical combinations can be used<br>
for evaluating the properties instead of a linear combination.<br>
[0029] Besides the hitherto described sorting of bank notes according to state, it is<br>
also possible to evaluate the overall state of a certain set of bank notes. To this end, an<br>
average is formed from the linear combinations determined for the different properties.<br>
Likewise, an average can be formed for each or certain of the different properties of<br>
the certain set of bank notes, which then describes the state of this property for the cer-<br>
tain set of bank notes. This can be of interest to a national bank, for example, since it<br>
permits it to get a general idea of the overall state or the state of certain qualities of the<br>
circulating bank notes.<br>
[0030] Besides the described properties characterizing the state of individual bank<br>
notes, it can also be provided to include further properties in the determination of state<br>
that relate to more than one bank note. For example, it can be determined whether<br>
bank notes are connected by staples or whether a bundle of bank notes has poor stack<br>
quality or a height greater than an expected height.<br>
[0031] For this purpose, it can be provided that sensors are disposed e.g. in the area<br>
of the input pocket 20 to determine e.g. the presence of staples or the height of the in-<br>
serted bundle of bank notes 21. In the case of the height of the bundle, after the bundle<br>
has been processed by the bank note processing machine 10, i.e. when the number of<br>
bank notes 21 in the bundle is established, the height of the bundle determined in the<br>
input pocket 20 is compared with a height expected for the number of bank notes 21<br>
forming the bundle. In the case that the number of bank notes 21 in the bundle is<br>
known, the height comparison can of course be done before the bank notes 21 are<br>
processed. The expected height can be determined by the control device 35 by multi-<br>
plying the number of bank notes 21 by the known thickness of bank notes fit for circu-<br>
lation. If the height measured in the input pocket 20 is e.g. greater than the height de-<br>
termined from the number of bank notes 21 it can be inferred that the state of the bank<br>
notes 21 is bad, e.g. that the bank notes 21 are limp.<br>
[0032] The invention has hitherto been described with reference to a bank note<br>
processing machine, but the invention can obviously be used wherever bank notes<br>
have to be judged with regard to state, e.g. also in cash deposit and dispensing ma-<br>
chines, so-called recyclers.<br>
[0033] Deviating from the description, it is also possible for the inventive apparatus<br>
to have a different structure. For example, instead of only one central control device<br>
35, a control device can be provided in each sensor. In this case, the linkage of the data<br>
of the individual sensors is effected in one of the control devices of the sensors or in a<br>
central control device.<br>
