Field of The Invention<br>
This invention relates to traveling spark ignition system, plasma ignitor therefor and method of producing moving plasma for an ignition system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Automobiles have undergone many changes since their initial development at the end of<br>
the last century. Many of these evolutionary changes can be seen as a maturing of technology, with the fundamental principles remaining the same. Such is the case with the ignition system. Some of its developments include the replacement of mechanical distributors by electronic ones, increasing reliability and allowing for easy adjustment of the spark timing under different engine operating conditions. The electronics responsible for creating the high voltage required for the discharge have changed, with transistorized coil ignition (TCI) and capacitive discharge ignition (CDI) systems common today. However, the basic spark plug structure has not changed. Spark plugs today differ from earlier ones mostly in the use of improved materials, but the basic point-to-point discharge remains the same.<br>
A spark driven by the force from the interaction of the magnetic field created by the spark current and the current itself is very attractive concept, for enlarging the ignition kernel for a given ignition system input energy.<br>
The need for an enhanced ignition source has long been recognized. Many inventions have been made which provide enlarged ignition kernels. The use of plasma jets and Lorentz force plasma accelerators have been the subject of much study and patents. None of these prior inventions have resulted in practical commercially acceptable solutions, though. The primary weakness of the prior inventions has been the requirement for excessive ignition energy, which eliminates any possible efficiency enhancement in the engine in which they are employed. These higher ignition energy requirements have resulted in high rates of ignition electrode erosion, which reduces ignition operating life to unacceptable levels.<br>
The concept of enlarging the volume and surface area of the spark initiated plasma ignition kernel is an attractive idea for extending the practical lean limit for combustible mixtures in a combustion engine. The objective is to reduce the variance in combustion delay which is<br><br>
-2-<br>
typical when engines are operated with lean mixtures. More specifically, there has been a long felt need to eliminate ignition delay, by increasing the spark volume. While it will be explained in more detail below, note that if a plasma is confined to the small volume between the discharge electrodes (as is the case with a conventional spark plug), its initial volume is quite small, typically about 1 mm3 of plasma having a temperature of 60,000°K is formed. This kernel expands and cools to a volume of about 25 mm3 and a temperature of 2,500 °K, which can ignite the combustible mixture. This volume represents about 0.04% of the mixture that is to be burned to complete combustion in a 0.5 liter cylinder at a compression ratio of 8:1. From the discussion below it will be seen that, if the ignition kernel could be increased 100 times, 4% of the combustible mixture would be ignited and the ignition delay would be significantly reduced. This attractive ignition goal has not heretofore been achieved in practical systems, though.<br>
The electrical energy required in these earlier systems, e.g., Fitzgerald et al., U.S. patent 4,122,816, is claimed to be more than 2 Joules per firing (col. 2, lines 55-63). This energy is about 40 times higher than that used in conventional spark plugs.<br>
Matthews et al., infra, reports the use of 5.5 Joules of electrical energy per ignition, or<br>
more than 100 times the energy used in conventional ignition systems.	<br>
Consider a six cylinder engine operating at 3600 RFM, which requires firing three cylinders every engine revolution or 180 firings per second. At 2 Joules per firing this is 360 Joules/second. This energy must be provided by the combustion engine al a typical efficiency of about 18% and converted to a suitable higher voltage by power conversion devices with a typical efficiency of about 40%, for a net use of the engine fuel at an efficiency of about 7.2%. Fitzgerald requires a fuel consumption of 360/0.072 Joules/second, or about 5000 Joules/second to run the ignition system.<br>
To move a 1250 kg vehicle on a level road at about 80 km/hr (about 50 mph) requires about 9000 Joules/second of fuel energy. At an engine fuel to motive force conversion efficiency of 18%, about 50,000 Joules/second of fuel will be consumed. Thus, the system employed by Fitzgerald et al, infra, will consume about 10% of the fuel energy consumed to run the vehicle to run the ignition system. This is greater than the efficiency gain to be expected by use of the Fitzgerald et al. ignition systems.<br>
By comparison, conventional ignition systems use about 0.25 percent of the fuel energy to run the ignition system. (Further the high energy employed in these systems causes high levels of erosion to occur in the electrodes of the spark plugs, thus reducing the useful operating<br><br>
-3-<br>
life considerably.This shortened life is demonstrated in the work by Matthews ct al., infra, where the need to reduce ignition energy is acknowledged although no solution is provided.<br>
As an additional attempt at solving this problem, consider the work by Tsao and Durbin (Tsao, L. and Durbin, E.J., "Evaluation of Cyclic Variation and Lean Operation in a Combustion Engine with a Multi-Electrode Spark Ignition System", Princeton Univ.. MAE Report. (January, 1984)), where a larger than regular ignition kernel was generated by a multiple electrode spark plug, demonstrating a reduction in cyclic variability of combustion, a reduction in spark advance. and an increase in output power. The increase in kernel size was only six times that of an ordinary spark plug.<br>
Bradley and Critchley (Bradley, D., Critchley, I.L., "Electromagnetically Induced Motion of Spark Ignition Kernels". Combust. Flame 22. pgs. 143-152 (1974)) were the first to consider the use of electromagnetic forces to induce a motion of the spark, with an ignition energy of 12 Joules. Fitzgerald (Fitzgerald, D.J., "Pulsed Plasma Ignitor for Internal Combustion Engines", SAE paper 760764 (1976); and Fitzgerald, D.J., Breshears, R.R., "Plasma Ignitor for Internal Combustion Engine", U.S. Patent No. 4,122,816 (1978)) proposed to use pulsed plasma thrusters for the ignition of automotive engines with much less but still substantial ignition energy (approximately 1.6J). Although he was able to extend the lean limit, the overall performance of such plasma thrusters used for ignition systems was not significantly better than that of regular spark plugs and the sparks they produce. In this system, much more ignition energy was used without a significant increase in plasma kernel size. (Clements, R.M., Smy, P.R., Dale, J.D., "An Experimental Study of the Ejection Mechanism for Typical Plasma Jet Ignilors", Combust. Flame 42. pages 287-295 (1981)). More recently Hall et al. (Hall. M.J., Tajima, H.. Matthews. R.D., Koeroghlian, M.M., Wcldon, W.F., Nichols, S.P., "Initial Studies of a New Type of Ignitor: The Railplug", SAE paper 912319 (1991)). and Matthews ct al. (Matthews, R.D., Hall. M.J., Faidley, R.W., Chiu, J.P., Zhao, X.W., Annezer, I., Koening. M.H., Harbcr. J.F., Dardcn, M.H., Weldon, W.F., Nichols, S.P., "Further Analysis of Railplugs as a New Type of Ignitor", SAE paper 922167 (1992)), have shown that a "rail plug" operated at an,energy of over 6J (2.4cm long) showed a very substantial improvement in combustion bomb experiments. They also observed improvements in the lean operation of an engine when they ran it with their spark plug at an ignition energy of 5.5J. They attributed the need of this excessive amount of energy to poor matching between the electrical circuit and the spark plug. This level of energy expended in the spark plug is about 25% of the energy consumed in propelling a 1250 kg vehicle at 80<br><br>
-4-<br>
km/hr on a level road. Any efficiency benefits in engine performance would be more than<br>
consumed by the increased energy in the ignition system.<br>
Summary Of The Invention<br>
 A first significant aspect of the invention is a plasma injector, or ignitor, for an internal combustion engine, including at least first and second electrodes; means for maintaining the electrodes in a predetermined, spaced-apart relationship; and means for mounting in an internal combustion engine with active portions of the electrodes installed in a combustion cylinder of the engine. The electrodes are dimensioned and configured, and their spacing is arranged, such that when a sufficiently high voltage is applied across the electrodes while the ignitor is installed in an internal combustion engine, in the midst of a gaseous mixture of air and fuel, a plasma is formed in the mixture between the electrodes and the plasma moves outwardly from between the electrodes into an expanding volume in the cylinder, under a Lorcnlz force. The spaced relationship between the electrodes may be maintained by surrounding a substantial portion of the electrodes with a dielectric material such that as the voltage is applied to the electrodes, the<br>
i1-<br>
plasma forms on or in the vicinity of the surface of the dielectric. The voltage may be reduced, and increased current supplied, to maintain the plasma after its initial formation.<br>
As more particularly explained herein, another aspect of the invention is a plasma injector, or ignitor, for an internal combustion engine, one embodiment of which comprises two electrodes which are spaced apart and have substantially parallel and circular facing surfaces between which a radially outwardly moving plasma is formed in the fuel-air mixture via a voltage applied across the electrodes.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, a plasma injector, or ignitor. for an internal combustion enginecomprises two spaced apart and substantially parallel longitudinal electrodes, between which a longitudinally outwardly-moving plasma is formed via a high voltage applied across the electrodes.<br>
Another aspect of the invention, usable with the two preceding aspects of the invention, is an ignition source which provides an ignition plasma kernel by providing a sufficiently high first voltage for creating a channel formed of plasma between the electrodes and a second voltage of lower potential than the first voltage for sustaining current through the plasma in the channel between the electrodes, such that an electric field from the potential difference between the electrodes and the magnetic field associated with said current interact to. create a force upon the<br><br>
-5-<br>
plasma to cause it to move away from its region of origin and to expand in volume.	<br>
According to yet another aspect, the invention comprises an ignitor which consists of<br>
substantially parallel and spaced apart electrodes including at least first second electrodes<br>
forming a discharge gap between them, wherein the ratio of the sum of the radii of the electrodes<br>
to the length of the electrodes is larger than or equal to about four, while the ratio of the<br>
difference of these two radii to the length of the electrodes is larger than about one-third; a<br>
dielectric material surrounds a substantial portion of the electrodes and the space between them;<br>
an uninsulated end of portion of each of the electrodes is free of said dielectric material and in<br>
oppositional relationship to one another; and wherein there are means for mounting the ignitor<br>
with the free ends of the first second electrodes installed in a combustion cylinder of a<br>
combustion engine.	<br>
According to still another aspect of the invention, an ignitor is provided which comprises at least two parallel and spaced apart electrodes adapted for forming discharge gaps between them, wherein the radius of the largest cylinder which can fit between the electrodes is greater than the length of the electrodes; a dielectric material surrounds a substantial portion of the electrodes and the space between them; an uninsulated end portion of each of the electrodes is free of the dielectric material and in oppositional relationship to one another, the uninsulated end portions being designated the lengths of the electrodes, and further including means for mounting the ignitor with free ends of the electrodes in a combustion cylinder of an engine.<br>
A still further aspect of the invention is a traveling spark ignition system for a combustion engine which includes an ignitor and together therewith or separately therefrom electrical means for providing a potential difference between electrodes of the ignitor. The ignitor includes substantially parallel and spaced apart electrodes which include a least first and second electrodes forming a discharge gap between them, wherein the ratio of the sum of the radii of the electrodes to their lengths is larger than or equal to about four, while the ratio of the difference of these two radii to the lengths of the electrodes is larger than about one-third. A dielectric material, such as a polarizable ceramic, surrounds a substantial portion of the electrodes and the space between them, with an uninsulated end portion of each of the electrodes being free of the dielectric material and in oppositional relationship to one another. Means are included for mounting the ignitor with the free ends of the first and second electrodes installed in a combustion cylinder of an engine. Such means may include threads on one of the electrodes.<br>
The electrical means for providing a potential difference between the electrodes initially provides<br><br>
-6-<br>
a sufficiently high first voltage for creating a channel formed of plasma in the fuel-air mixture<br>
between the electrodes, and thereafter provides a second voltage of lower potential than the first<br>
voltage for sustaining a current through the plasma in the channel between the electrodes. As a<br>
result, an electric field from the potential difference between the electrodes interacts with a<br>
magnetic field arising from said current, in a manner which creates a force upon the plasma for<br>
causing it to move away from its region of origin, which causes the volume of the plasma to<br>
increase.<br>
According to a further aspect of the invention, there is provided a traveling spark ignition<br>
system for a combustion engine which includes an ignitor and electrical means for sequentially<br>
providing two potential differences between electrodes of the ignitor. The ignitor includes at<br>
least parallel spaced apart electrodes adapted to form discharge gaps between them, wherein the<br>
radius of the largest cylinder which can fit between said electrodes is greater than the length of<br>
the electrodes; a dielectric material surrounds a substantial portion of the electrodes and a space<br>
between them, which dielectric material may, for example, be a polarizable ceramic material; an<br>
uninsulated end portion of each of the electrodes is free of the dielectric material and in<br>
oppositional relationship to one another, the uninsulated end portions being the aforesaid lengths<br>
of the electrodes; and means being provided for mounting the ignitor with the free ends of the<br>
electrodes in a combustion cylinder of an engine, such means being, for example, threads<br>
provided on one of the electrodes. The electrical means for sequentially providing potential<br>
differences between the electrodes provides a first potential difference which is sufficiently high<br>
to create a channel formed of plasma between the electrodes, after which the potential difference<br>
is reduced to a second voltage of lower potential than the first voltage for sustaining a current<br>
through the plasma in the channel between the electrodes. An electric field caused by the<br>
potential difference between the electrodes interacts with a magnetic field arising from the<br>
current in a manner which creates a force upon the plasma to cause, it to move away from its<br>
region of origin, to increase the swept volume of the plasma.<br><br>

Detailed Description Qf The Invention<br>
The invention is a traveling spark initiator or ignitor (TS1) in the form of a miniature Marshall gun (coaxial gun), with high efficiency of transfer of electric energy into plasma volume creation. In the embodiment of Fig. 2, a ratio.of a sum of the radii (r2) and (r1), of an external electrode and internal electrode, respectively, to the length (l) of the electrodes should be larger than or equal to 4, whereas the ratio of the difference of these two radii (r2-r1)=g1/2 to the length (l) of the electrodes should be larger than 1/3 (preferably larger than 1/2), as follows:<br><br>
-8-<br><br>
and g1 is the gap spacing between the electrodes.<br>
Similar relations are required for the embodiment of Fig. 3. where r2 and r1 from Fig. 2 are replaced by R2 and R1 as shown, the gap between the electrodes is g2, and the length of the electrodes is L. Hence<br><br>
The heat transfer to the combustible mixture occurs in the form of the diffusion of ions and radicals from the plasma. The very large increase in plasma volume dramatically increases the rate of heat transfer to the combustible mixture.<br>
The principle of the Marshall gun is discussed first. There follows a discussion of the environmental benefits provided by larger spark volumes. The construction details of such a system will then be discussed relative to various embodiments of the invention.<br>
The principle of the Marshall gun presents an effective way of creating a large volume of plasma. The schematic presentation in Fig. 1 shows the electric field 2 and magnetic field 4 in an illustrative coaxial plasma gun, where B1, is (he poloidal magnetic field directed along field line 4. The plasma 16 is moved in a direction 6 by the action of the Lorentz force vector F and thermal expansion, with new plasma being continually created by the breakdown of fresh gas as the discharge continues. Vz is the plasma kernel speed vector, also directed in the z-direction represented by arrow 6. Thus, the plasma 16 grows as it moves along and through the spaces between electrodes 10, 12 (which are maintained in a spaced relationship by isolator or dielectric 14). Once the plasma 16 leaves the electrodes 10, 12, it expands in volume, cooling in the process. It ignites the combustibles mixture alter it has cooled to the ignition temperature.<br>
Fortunately, increasing plasma volume is consistent with acknowledged strategies for reducing emissions and improving fuel economy. Two such strategies are to increase the dilution of the gas mixture inside the cylinder and to reduce the cycle-to-cycle variations.<br>
Dilution of the gas mixture, which is most commonly achieved by the use of either excess<br><br>
-9-<br>
air (running the engine lean) or exhaust gas recirculation (HGR), reduces the formation of oxides of nitrogen by lowering the combustion temperature. Oxides of nitrogen play a critical role in the formation of smog, and their reduction is one of the continuing challenges for the automotive industry Dilution of the gas mixture also increases the fuel efficiency by lowering temperature and thus reducing the heat loss, through the combustion chamber walls, improving the ratio of specific heats, and by lowering the pumping losses at a partial load.<br>
Zeilinger determined the nitrogen oxide formation per horsepower-hour of work done, as a function of the air to fuel ratio, for three different spark timings (Zeilinger, K... Ph.D. thesis, Technical University of Munich (1974)). He found that both the air-to-fuel ratio and the spark timing affect the combustion temperature, and thus the nitrogen oxide formation. As the combustible mixture or air/fuel ratio (A/F) is diluted with excess air (i.e., A/I" larger than stoichiometric), the temperature drops. At first, this effect is diminished by the increase in the amount of oxygen. The NOx formation increases. When the mixture is further diluted, the NOx formation decreases to values much below those at a stoichiometric mixture because the combustion temperature decline overwhelms the increase in O2.<br>
A more advanced spark timing (i.e., initiating ignition more degrees before top dead center) raises the peak temperature and decreases engine efficiency because a larger fraction of the combustible mixture burns before the piston reaches top dead center (TDC) and the mixture is compressed to a higher temperature, hence leading to much higher NOx levels and heat losses. As the mixture is made lean, the spark timing which gives the maximum brake torque (MBT timing) increases.<br>
Dilution of the mixture results in a reduction of the energy density and the flame propagation speed, which affect ignition and combustion. The lower energy density reduces the heat released from the chemical reaction within a given volume, and thus shifts the balance between the chemical heat release and the heat lost to the surrounding gas. If the heat release is less than that lost, the flame will not propagate. An increase in the ignition volume is required to assure that the flame propagation does not slow down as the energy density of the combustible mixture is reduced.<br>
Reducing the flame propagation speed increases the combustion duration. Ignition delay results from the fact that the flame front is very small in the beginning, which causes it to grow-very slowly, as the quantity of fuel-air mixture ignited is proportional to the surface area. The increase in the ignition delay and the combustion duration results in an increase of the spark<br><br>
- 10-<br>
advancc required for achieving the maximum torque, and reduecs the amount of output work available. A larger ignition kernel will reduce the advance in spark timing required, and thus lessen the adverse effects associated with such an advance. (These adverse effects are an increased difficulty to ignite the combustible mixture, due to the lower density and temperature at the time of the spark, and an increase in the variation of the ignition delay, which causes driveability to deteriorate).<br>
Cyclic variations are caused by unavoidable variations in the local air-to-fuel ratio, temperature, amount of residual gas, and turbulence. The effect of these variations on the cylinder pressure is due largely to their impact on the initial expansion velocity of the flame. This impact can be significantly reduced by providing a spark volume which is appreciably larger than the mean sizes of the inhomogeneities.<br>
A decrease in the cyclic variations of the engine conditions will reduce emissions and increase efficiency, by reducing the number of poor burn cycles, and by extending the operating air fuel ratio range of the engine.<br>
Quader determined the mass fraction of the combustible mixture which was burned as a function of the crank angle, for two different start timings (Quader, A., "What Limits Lean Operation in Spark Ignition Engines - Flame Initiation or Propagation?", SAE Paper 760760 (1976)). His engine was running very lean (i.e.. an equivalence ratio of about 0.7). at 1200 rpm and at 60% throttle. The mass fraction burned did not change in any noticeable way immediately after the spark occurred (there is an interval where hardly any burning can be detected, commonly known as the ignition delay). This is due to the very small volume of the spark, and the slow combustion duration due to the small surface area and relatively low temperature. Once a small percentage of the combustible mixture has burned, the combustion rate increases, slowly at first, and then more rapidly as the flame front grows. The performance of the engine at both of these spark timings is poor. In the case of 60° B.T.D.C. (before top dead center ignition timing), too much of the mixture has burned while the piston is compressing the mixture therefore, negative work is being done. The rise in pressure opposes the compression strokes of the engine. In the case of 40° B.T.D.C. timing, a considerable fraction of the mixture is burned after the expansion strokes have started, thus reducing the output work available.<br>
The intersection of a 4% burned line with the curves determined by Quader. Id., shows the potential advantage that a large spark volume, if it were available, would have in eliminating the ignition delay. For the 60° B.T.D.C. spark curve, if the spark timing is changed from 60° to<br><br>
-11 -<br>
22° B.T.D.C, a change of nearly 40 degrees, the rate of change of mass fraction burned will be higher because the combustible mixture density will be higher at the moment of ignition. For the 40° B.T.D.C. spark time curve, if the timing is changed from 40° to 14° B.T.D.C, a change of about 25 degrees, the combustible mixture will be completely burned at a point closer to TDC, thus increasing efficiency.<br>
The above arguments clearly illustrate the importance of an increase in spark volume for reduced emission and improved fuel economy. With the TSI system of the present invention, the required spark advance for maximum efficiency can be reduced by 20° to 30°, or more.<br>
While increasing spark volume, the TSI system also provides for moving the spark deeper into the combustible mixture, with the effect of reducing the combustion duration.<br>
The construction of a practical TSI system will now be discussed for various exemplary embodiments of the invention.<br>
There are provided, in accordance with the present invention, (a) a small plasma gun or traveling spark ignitor (also known as a TSI) that substitutes for a conventional spark plug and (b) specially matched electronic trigger (i.e., ignition) circuitry. Matching the electronic circuit to the parameters of the plasma gun (length of electrodes, diameters of coaxial cylinders, duration of the discharge) maximizes the volume of the plasma when it leaves the gun for a given store of electrical energy. By properly choosing the parameters of the electronic circuit it is possible to obtain current and voltage time profiles so that substantially maximum electrical energy is transferred to the plasma.<br>
Preferably, the TSI ignition system of the present invention uses no more than about 300 mJ per firing. By contrast, earlier plasma and Marshall gun ignitors have not achieved practical utility because they employed much larger ignition energies (e.g., 2-10 Joules per firing), which<br>
caused rapid erosion of the ignitor, and short life. Further efficiency gains in engine performance were surrendered by increased ignition system energy consumption.<br>
Heretofore, it had been thought that the proper design principle was to generate moving plasma with a very high speed, which would penetrate the combustible mixture to create a high level of turbulence and ignite a large volume of that mixture. This was accomplished by using a relatively long length of electrodes with a relatively small gap between them. For example, an aspect ratio of electrode length to discharge gap more than 3 and preferably 6-10 was proposed by Matthews et al., supra. By contrast, the present invention uses a relatively short length of electrodes with a relatively large gap between them.<br><br>

Consider that the kinetic energy of the plasma is proportional to the product of plasma mass, Mp, and its velocity, vp, squared, as follows:<br><br>
Doubling the velocity of the plasma multiplies the kinetic energy four-fold. The mass of plasma is ?p x Volp where ?p and Volp are the plasma density and plasma volume, respectively. Thus, if the volume of the plasma is doubled at the same velocity the required energy is only doubled<br>
The present invention increases the ratio of plasma volume to energy required to form the plasma. This is done by quickly achieving a modest plasma velocity.<br>
If one assumes a spherical shape for the ignition plasma volume, the surface area of the volume increases as the square of the radius of the volume. Ignition of the combustible mixture occurs at the surface of-the plasma volume after the plasma has expanded and cooled to the combustible mixture ignition temperature. Thus, the rate at which the combustible mixture burns initially depends primarily on the plasma temperature and not on its initial velocity. Consequently, maximizing the ratio of plasma volume and temperature to plasma input energy maximizes the effectiveness of the electrical input energy in speeding up the combustion of the combustible mixture.<br>
The drag, D, on the expanding volume of plasma is proportional to the density of the combustible mixture, pc, and the square of the speed of the expanding plasma, vp, as follows:<br>
D=- ?cvp2<br>
The magnitude of the electrical force, F, to expand the plasma is proportional to the discharge current, I, squared. Equating these two forces yields the following:<br>
F - I2 = D - ?cvp 2<br><br>
-13-<br>
The radius, r, of the plasma volume, Volp, is proportional to 0? tD vp(t)dt where tD is the duration of the discharge. The volume of the plasma is proportional to the cube of the radius r, while the radius of the plasma volume is proportional to 0? tD I(t)dt=Q, the electric charge inserted into the<br>
plasma. Thus, the volume of the plasma is proportional to Q3.<br>
If the source of electrical energy is that stored in a capacitor, then Q=VC, where V is the voltage at which the charge Q is stored and C is the capacitance; and the energy stored in the capacitor is E=l/2 CV2.<br>
To maximize the plasma volume for given energy, the ratio of plasma volume, Volp to electrical energy, E, has to be maximized. Volp/E is proportional to C3V3/CV2, which is C2V. For a given constant energy E=l/2 CV2, C will be proportional to V"2. Hence, Volp/E is proportional to V-3.<br>
Therefore, the optimum circuit design is one which stores the desired electric energy in a large capacitor at a low voltage.<br>
To enhance efficiency, therefore, the discharge should take place at the lowest possible voltage. To that end, according to the invention the initial discharge of electrical energy takes place on the surface of an insulator, and a power supply is used to raise the gap conductivity near the surface of that insulator, and the main source of discharge energy is stored and provided at the lowest possible voltage that will be effective to create the plasma reliably. A further objective, preferably, is to avoid recombination of the large amount of ions and electrons of the traveling spark (plasma) on the electrode walls. The energy losses due to the recombination of ions and electrons reduce the efficiency of the system. Since recombination processes increase with time, the ion formation should take place quickly to minimize the probability of interaction of ions with the walls. To reduce recombination, therefore, the discharge time should be short. This can be accomplished by achieving the desired velocity on a short travel distance.<br>
There is a second loss mechanism: the drag force on the plasma as it impacts the combustible mixture ahead of its path. These losses vary as the square of the velocity. Thus the exit velocity should be as low as possible to reduce or minimize such losses.<br>
The high volume that is desired, combined with the need to discharge quickly, leads to a structure characterized by a short length l for plasma travel with a relatively wide gap between<br><br>
- 14-<br>
electrodes. This requirement is specified geometrically by the two ratio pairs described with reference to Figs. 2 and 3, above.<br>
What does this mean with respect to physical dimensions? If the volume of the plasma in a point-to-point discharge of a conventional spark plug is about 1 mm3, it would be desirable, preferably, to create a plasma volume at least 100 times greater, i.e., Volp = 100 mm3. Thus, using the configuration of Fig. 2, an example satisfying such conditions could be: length l = 2.5 mm, the radius (inside) of the larger diameter cylindrical electrode being r2 = 5.8 mm (this would be a typical radius of the cylindrical electrode using the conventional spark p.ap with a thread diameter of 14 mm) and the radius of the smaller diameter cylindrical electrode being r1 = 4.6 mm.<br>
As shown in the embodiments of Figs. 2 and 3, TSI 17, 27, respectively, share many of the same physical attributes as a standard spark plug, such as standard mounting means or threads 19, a standard male spark plug connector 21, and an insulator 23. The tips or plasma forming portions of the TSI's 17 and 27, respectively, differ significantly from conventional spark plugs, though. In a Traveling Spark Ignitor (TSI) for one embodiment of the present invention as shown in Fig. 2, an internal electrode 18 is placed with a lower portion extending coaxially into the interior open volume of external electrode 20 distal boot connector 21. The space between the electrodes is filled with an insulating material 22 (e.g., ceramic) except for the last 2 to 3 mm, in this example, at the end of the ignitor 17. this distance being shown as t The space or discharge gap g, between the electrodes may have a radial distance of about 1.2 to about 1.5 mm, in this example. These distances for l and g1 are important in that the TSI preferably works as a system with the matching electronics (discussed below) in order to obtain maximum efficiency. A discharge between the electrodes 18-20 starts along the exposed interior surface of the insulator 23, since a lower voltage is required to initiate a discharge along the surface of an insulator than in the gas some distance away from the insulator surface. When a voltage is applied, the gas (air/fuel mixture) is ionized by the resulting electrical field, creating a plasma 24 which becomes a good conductor and su?ports a current between the electrodes at a lower voltage. This current ionizes more gas (air/fuel mixture) and gives rise to a Lorcnz force which increases the volume of the plasma 24. In the TSI of Fig. 2, the plasma accelerates out of the "ignitor plug" 17 in the axial direction.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a TSI 27 with an internal electrode 25 that is placed coaxially in the external electrode 28. The space between the electrodes 26 and 28 is filled with an insulating material 30<br><br>
- 15-<br>
(e.g., ceramic). The main distinguishing feature for the embodiment of Fig. 3 relative to Fig. 2, is that there is a flat, disk-shaped (circular) electrode surface 26 formed integrally with or attached to the free end of the center electrode 25, extending transversely to the longitudinal axis of electrode 25 and facing electrode 28. Note further that the horizontal plane of disk 26 is parallel to the associated piston head (not shown) When the plasma ignitor 27 is installed in a piston cylinder. The end surface of electrode 28 which faces electrode 26 also is a substantially flat circular shape extending parallel to the facing surface of electrode 26. As a result, an annular cavity 29 is formed between opposing surfaces of electrodes 26 and 28. More precisely, there are two substantially parallel surfaces of electrodes 26 and 28 spaced apart and oriented to be parallel to the top of an associated piston head, as opposed to the embodiment of Fig. 2 wherein the electrodes run perpendicularly to an associated piston head when in use. Consider that when the air/fuel mixture is ignited, the associated piston "rises" and is close to the spark plug or ignitor 27, so that it is preferably further from gap 29 of the ignitor 27 to the wall of the associated cylinder than to the piston head. Accordingly, the preferred direction of travel for the plasma to obtain maximum interaction with the mixture is from the gap ,29 to the cylinder wall. The essentially parallel electrodes 26 and 28 are substantially parallel to.the longest dimension of the volume of the combustible mixture at the moment of ignition, instead of being oriented perpendicularly to this dimension and toward the piston head as in the embodiment of Fig. 2. and the prior art. It was discovered that when the same electrical conditions are used for energizing ignitors 17 and 27, the plasma acceleration lengths l and L, respectively, are substantially equal for obtaining optimal plasma production. Also, for TSI 27, under these conditions the following dimensions work well: the radius of the disk electrode 26 is R2 = 6.8 mm, the radius of the isolating ceramic is R1 = 4.3 mm, the gap between the electrodes g: = 1.2 mm and the length L = 2.5 mm.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 3, the plasma 32 initiates in discharge gap 29 at the exposed surface of insulator 25, and grows and expands outwardly in the radial direction of arrow's 29A. This provides several additional advantages over the TSI embodiment of Fig. 2. First, the surface area of the disk electrode 26 exposed to the plasma 32 is substantially equal to that of the end portion of the outer electrode 28 exposed to the plasma 32. This means that the erosion of the inner portion of disk electrode 26 can be expected to be significantly less than that of the exposed portion of inner electrode 18 of TSI 17 of Fig. 2, the latter having a much smaller surface area exposed to the plasma. Secondly, the insulator material 30 in the TSI 27 of Fig. 3<br><br>
- 16-<br>
provides an additional heat conducting path for electrode 26. The added insulator material 30 will keep the inner electrode metal 25, 26 cooler than electrode 18 in Fig. 2, thereby enhancing the reliability of TS1 27 relative to TSI 17. Finally, in using TSI.27, the plasma will not be impinging on and perhaps eroding the associated piston head.<br>
Figs. 5 and 6 illustrate pictorially the differences in plasma trajectories between TSI 17 of<br>
Fig. 2, and TSI 27 of Fig. 3 when installed in an engine. In Fig. 5, a TSI 17 is mounted in a<br>
cylinder head 90, associated with a cylinder 92 and a piston 94 which is reciprocating - i.e.,<br>
moving up and down - in the cylinder 92. As in any conventional internal combustion engine, as<br>
the piston head 96 nears top dead center, the TSI 17 will be energized. This will produce the<br>
plasma 24, which will travel in the direction of arrow 98 only a short distance toward or to the<br>
piston head 96. During this travel, the plasma 24 will ignite the air/fuel mixture (not shown) in<br>
the cylinder 92. The ignition begins in the vicinity of the plasma 24. In contrast to such travel of<br>
plasma 24, the TSI 27, as shown in Fig. 6, provides for the plasma 32 to travel in the direction of<br>
arrows 100, resulting in the ignition of a greater amount of air/fuel mixture than provided by TSI<br>
17, as previously explained.'	<br>
The electrode materials may include any suitable conductor such as steel, clad metals, platinum-plated steel (for erosion resistance or "performance engines"), copper, and high-temperature electrode metals such as molybdenum or tungsten, for example. The metal may be of controlled thermal expansion like Kovar (a trademark and product of Carpenter Technology Corp.) and coated with a material such as cuprous oxide so as to give good subsequent seals to glass or ceramics. Electrode materials may also be' selected to reduce power consumption. For instance, thoriated tungsten could be used as its slight radioactivity may help to pre-ionize the air between the electrodes, possibly reducing the required ignition voltage. Also, the electrodes may be made out of high-Curie temperature permanent magnet materials, polarized to assist the Lorentz force in expelling the plasma.<br>
The electrodes, except for a few millimeters at the end, are separated by an isolator or insulator material which is a high temperature, polarizable electrical dielectric. This material can be porcelain, or a fired ceramic with a glaze, as is used in conventional spark plugs, for example. Alternatively, it can be formed of refractory cement, a machinable glass-ceramic such as Macor (a trademark and product of Corning Glass Company), or molded alumina, stabilized zirconia or the like fired and sealed to the metal electrodes with a solder glass frit, for example. As above, the ceramic could also comprise a permanent magnet material such as barium ferrite.<br><br>
-17-<br>
In terms of operation of the embodiments of Figs 2 and 3, when the electrodes 18. 20 and 25, 26, respectively, are connected to the rest of the TSI system, they become part of an electrical system which also comprises an electrical circuit for providing potential differences which are sufficiently high to create a spark in the gap between respective electrode pairs. The resulting magnetic field surrounding the current in the electrodes and in the spark channel, for each embodiment of the invention, interacts with the electrical field to create a Lorentz force_on the material in the spark channels; this effect causes the point of origin of the spark channel to move, and not to remain fixed in position, thus increasing the cross-sectional area of the spark channels, as previously described. This is in contrast to traditional spark ignition systems, wherein the point of origin of the spark remains fixed. Electronic circuits matched to the TSIs 17 and 27 complete the TSI system for each embodiment, and are discussed in the following examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
Fig. 4 shows TSI plug or ignitor 17 with a schematic of the basic elements of an electrical<br>
or electronic ignition circuit connected thereto, which supplies the voltage and current for the<br>
discharge (plasma). (The same circuitry and circuit elements may be used for drivinc TSI 27.)<br>
A discharge between the two electrodes 18 and 20 starts along the surfaceT56 of the insulator<br>
material 22. The gas air/fuel mixture) is ionized by the discharge, creating a plasma 24 which<br>
becomes a good conductor of current and permits current between the electrodes at, a lower<br>
voltage than that which initiated the plasma. This current ionizes more gas (air/fuel mixture) and<br>
increases the volume of the plasma 24.	<br>
The electrical circuit shown in Fig. 4 includes a conventional ignition system 42 (e.g..<br>
capacitive discharge ignition, CDI, or transistorized coil ignition, TCI), a low voltage (Vs) supply<br>
44, capacitors 46 and 48 diodes 50 and 52, and a resistor 54. The conventional ignition system<br>
42 provides the high voltage necessary to break down, or ionize, the air/fuel mixture in the gap<br>
along the surface 56 of the TSI 17. Once the conducting path has been established, the capacitor<br>
46 quickly discharges through diode 50, providing a high power input, or current, into the plasma<br>
24. The diodes 50 and 52 are necessary to isolate electrically the ignition coil (not shown) of the<br>
conventional ignition system 42 from the relatively large capacitor 46 (between 1 and 4 µF). If<br>
the diodes 50, 52 were not present, the coil would not be able to produce a high voltage, due to<br>
the low impedance provided by capacitor 46. The coil would instead charge the capacitor 46.<br>
The function of the resistor 54, the capacitor 48, and the voltage source 44 is to recharge the<br><br>
-18-<br>
capacitor 46 after a discharge cycle. The resistor 54 is one way to prevent a low resistance current path between the voltage source 44 and the spark gap of TS1 17.<br>
Note that the circuit of Fig. 4 is simplified, for purposes of illustration. In a commercial a?plication, the circuit of Fig. 7 described below under the heading "Example 2" is preferred for recharging capacitor 46 in a more energy-efficient manner, using a resonant circuit. Furthermore, the conventional ignition system 42, whose sole purpose is to create the initial breakdown, is modified so as to use less energy and to discharge more quickly than has been conventional. Almost all of the ignition energy is supplied by capacitor 46. The modification is primarily to reduce high voltage coil inductance By the use of fewer secondary turns. This is possible because the initiating discharge can be of a much lower voltage when the discharge occurs over an insulator surface. The voltage required can be about one-third that required to cause a gaseous breakdown in air.<br>
The current through the central electrode 18 and the plasma 24 to the external electrode 20 creates around the central electrode 18 a poloidal (angular) magnetic field BT(1. r). which depends on the current and distance (radius r°, see Fig. 1) from the axis of electrode 18. 'Hence, the current I flowing through the plasma 24 perpendicular to the poloidal magnetic field B generates a Lorentz force F on the charged particles in the plasma 24 along the axial direction z of the cylinders 18, 20. The force is computed as follows in equation (6):<br>
F~I x B?FZ~I.B0<br>
This force accelerates the charged particles,which due to collisions with non-charged particles accelerate all the plasma. Note that the plasma consists of charged particles (electrons and ions), and neutral atoms. The temperature is not sufficiently high in the discharge to fully ionize all atoms.<br>
The original Marshall guns as a source of plasma for fusion devices were operated in a vacuum with a short pulse of gas injection between the electrodcs. The plasma created between the electrodes by the discharge of a capacitor was accelerated in a distance of a dozen centimeters to a final velocity of about 107 cm/sec. The plasma gun used as an engine ignitor herein operates at relatively high gas (air/fuel mixture) pressure. The drag force Fv of such a gas is approximately proportional to the square of the plasma velocity, as shown below:<br><br>
- 19-<br>
The distance over which the plasma accelerates is short (2-3mm). Indeed, experimentation has shown that increasing the length of the plasma acceleration distance beyond 2 to 3 mm does not increase significantly the plasma exit velocity, although electrical energy stored in the capacitor 46 has to be increased significantly. At atmospheric pressures and for electrical input energy of about 300mJ, the average velocity is close to 5xl04 cm/sec and will be lower at high pressure in the engine. At a compression ratio of 8:1, this average velocity will be approximately 3xl04 cm/sec.<br>
By contrast, if more energy is put into a single discharge of a conventional spark, its intensity is increased somewhat, but the volume of the plasma created does not increase significantly. In a conventional spark, a much larger fraction of the energy input goes into heating the electrodes when the conductivity of the discharge path is increased.<br>
Example 2<br>
TSI ignitors 17 and 27 of Figs 2 and 3, respectively, can be combined with the ignition electronics shown in Fig. 7. The ignition electronics can be divided into four parts, as shown: the primary and secondary circuits 77, 79, respectively, and their associated charging circuits 75. 81, respectively. The secondary circuit 79, in turn, is divided into a high voltage section S3, and a low voltage section 85.<br>
The primary and secondary circuits 77, 79, respectively, correspond to primary 58 and secondary 60 windings of an ignition coil 62. When the SCR 64 is turned on via application of a trigger signal to its gate 65, the capacitor 66 discharges through the SCR 64. which causes a current in the coil primary winding 58. This in turn imparts a high voltage across the associated secondary winding 60, which causes the gas in the spark gap 68 to break down and form a conductive path, i.e. a plasma. - Once the plasma has been created, diodes 86 turn on and the secondary capacitor 70 discharges. The spark gap symbol 68 is representative of an ignitor. according to the invention, such as exemplary TSI devices 17 and 27 of Figs 2 and 3. respectively.<br>
After the primary and secondary capacitors 66 and 70 have discharged, they are recharged by their respective charging circuits 75 and 81. Both charging circuits 75, 81 incorporate an inductor 72, 74 (respectively) and a diode 76, 78 (respectively), together with a power supply 80.<br><br>
-20-<br>
82 (respectively). The function of the inductor 72, 74 is to prevent the power supplies from being short-circuited through the ignitor. The function of the diodes 76 and 78 is to avoid oscillations. The capacitor 84 prevents the power supply 82 voltage V2 from the going through large fluctuations.<br>
The power supplies 80 and 82 both supply on the order of 500 volts or less for voltages V1 and V2, respectively. They could be combined into one power supply. (In experiments conducted by the inventors these power supplies were kept separate to-make it easier to vary the two voltages independently.) Power supplies 80 and 82 may be DC-to-DC converters from a CDI (capacitive discharge ignition) system, which can be powered by a 12 volt car battery, for example.<br>
An essential part of the ignition circuit of Fig. 7 are one or more high current diodes 86, which have a high reverse breakdown voltage, larger than the maximum spark gap breakdown voltage of either TSI 17 or TSI 27, for all engine operating conditions. The function of the diodes 86 is to isolate the_secondary capacitor 70 from the ignition coil 62, by blocking current from secondary winding 60 to capacitor 70. If this isolation were not present, the secondary voltage of ignition coil 62 would charge the secondary, capacitor 70. and. given a large capacitance, the ignition coil 62 would never be able to develop a sufficiently high voltage to break down the air/fuel mixture in spark gap 68.<br>
Diode 88 prevents capacitor 70 from discharging through the secondary winding 60 when there is no spark or plasma. Finally, the optional resistor 90 may be used to reduce current through secondary winding 60, thereby reducing electromagnetic radiation (radio noise) emitted by the circuit.<br>
In the present TSI system, a trigger electrode can be added between the inner and outer electrodes of Figs. 2 through 4 to lower the voltage on capacitor 70 in Fig. 7. Such a three electrode ignitor is shown in Fig. 8, and is described in the following paragraph.<br>
In Fig. 8, a three electrode plasma ignitor 100 is shown schematically. An internal electrode 104 is placed coaxially within the external electrode 106, both having diameters on the order of several millimeters. Radially between the internal electrode 104 and the external 106 is a third electrode 108. This third electrode 108 is connected to a high voltage (HV) coil 110. The third electrode 108 initiates a-discharge between the two main electrodes 104 and 106 by charging the exposed surface 114rof the insulator 112. The space between all three electrodes 104, 106, 108 is filled with insulating material 112 (e.g., ceramic) except for the last 2-3 mm<br><br>
-21 -<br>
space between electrodes 104 and 106 at the combustion end of the igniter 100. A discharge between the two main electrodes 104 and 106, after initiation by the third electrode 108, starts along the surface 114 of the insulator 112. The gas (air-fuel mixture) is ionized by the discharge. This discharge creates a plasma, which becomes a good electrical conductor and permits an increase in the magnitude of the current. The increased current ionizes more gas (air-fuel mixture) and increases the volume of the plasma, as previously explained.<br>
The high voltage between the tip of the third electrode 108 and the external electrode 106 provides a very low current discharge, which is sufficient to create enough charged particles on the surface 114 of the insulator 112 for the main capacitor to discharge between electrodes 104 and 106 along surface 104 of dielectric or insulator 112.<br>
As shown in Figs. 9A, 9B and 9C, another embodiment of the invention includes a<br>
traveling spark ignitor 120 having parallel rod-shaped electrodes 122 and 124. as shown. The<br>
parallel electrodes 122, -124 have a substantial portion of their respective lengths encapsulated by<br>
dielectric insulator material 126, as shown. A top end of the dielectric 126 retains a spark plug<br>
boot connector 21 that is both mechanically and electrically secured to the top end of electrode<br>
122. The dielectric material 126 rigidly retains electrodes 122 and 124 in parallel, and a portion<br>
rigidly retains the outer metallic body 128 having mounting threads 19 about a lower portion, as<br>
shown. Electrode 124 is both mechanically and electrically secured to an inside wall of metallic<br>
body 128 via a rigid mount 130, as shown, in this example. As shown in Fig. 9A, each of the<br>
electrodes 122 and 124 extends a distance l outwardly from the surface of the bottom end of<br>
dielectric 126.	<br>
With reference to Figs. 9B and 9C, the electrodes 122,and 124 are spaced apart adistance 2r, where r is the radius of the largest cylinder that can fit between the electrodes 122. 124 (see Fig. 9C).<br>
Although various embodiments of the invention are shown and described herein, they are<br>
not meant to be limiting as they are shown by way of example only. For example, the electrodes<br>
18 and 20 of TSI 17, and 25 of TSI 27 can be other than cylindrical. Also, the disk shaped<br>
electrode 26 can be other than circular - a straight rod. for example. For TSI 17, the electrodes<br>
18 and 20 may also be other than coaxial, such as parallel rods or parallel elongated rectangular <br>
configurations. Although the electrodes are shown as presenting equal lengths, this too may be <br>
varied, in which event the term "length" herein shall refer to the dimension of electrode overlap along the direction of plasma ejection from the ignitor. Those of skill in the art<br><br>
-22-<br>
will recognize still further modifications to the embodiments, which modifications arc meant to be covered by the spirit and scope of the appended claims.<br><br>
