				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This patent application is filed as a "Patent of Addition" to our co-pending application number 808/MAS/2002, filed on November 01,2002.<br>
The present invention provides an improved process to produce the chloromethvlceohem deR1vatives of the formula (W.<br>
wherein R| represents a carboxyl-protecting group viz., substituted methyl group, which can be depredated easily, such as t-butyl group, diphenylmethyl, 4-methoxybenzyl, 2-methoxyben2yI, 2-chlorobenzyl or benzyl group; R2 represents hydrogen, (C1-C4)alkyl, substituted or unsubstantiated phenyl or substituted or unsubstantiated phoenix.<br>
The chloromethylcephem deR1vatives of the formula (I) prepared according to the process of the present invention are useful for the preparation of cephalospoR1n antibiotics of the formula (11)<br><br>
wherein R4 is carboxyl ate ion or COORd, where Rc represents hydrogen, esters or a counter ion which forms a salt; Rg represents H, CH3, CRaRbCO0Rc where R and Rb independently represent hydrogen or methyl and R" represents hydrogen or (C,-C6)alkyl; R5 represents CH3, CH2OCH3, CH2OCOCH3, CH-CH2, or<br><br><br>
The cephalospoR1n antibiotics of the formula (II) have wide range of biological activity. SpeC1fically the cephalospoR1n antibiotics of the formula (II) have very good antibiotic activity.<br>
Bacl^round of the Invention<br>
In view of the importance of the S-chlq^omethylcephems of the formula (I), as key intermediates for the synthesis of a wide vaR1ety of cephalospoR1n drugs, vaR1ous methods of preparation were reported (US Patent 4,853,468; US Patent 4,789,740). In most of the cases, sulfonyl azetidinone deR1vatives of the formula (III) were subjected to allylic/ene-type chloR1nation with vaR1ous chloR1nating agents like chloR1ne, chloR1ne oxide, etc., to obtain the chloro azetidinone of the formula (IV). The chloro azetidinone compounds of the formula (IV) were further cyclized at low temperature in the presence of a base to get chloromethylcephems of the formula (I),<br><br><br>
where R1 and R2 are as defined above; R3 represents phenyl, (C1-C4)alkylphenyi, (C|-C4)alkoxyphenyl or a heteroaryl group.<br>
The preparation of sulfonyl azetidinone intermediate, as per the reported process, is always accompanied by the formation of a major impuR1ty, leading to low puR1ty of sulfonyl azetidinone, which in turn end up with low yield of the chloromethyl cephem of the formula (I).<br>
In addition, the side product formed duR1ng the preparation of sulfonyl azetidinone intermediate could not be removed completely with the existing method of acetone/water system; and if this side product is not removed in this step, it leads to more impuR1ty formation duR1ng conversion to next step of chloR1nation &amp; cyclization. Thus, there is a need to generate a process, which could take care of the removal of side product from sulfonyl azetidinone intermediate.<br>
In addition, in the last step of cyclization with ammonia in DMF, we found that the impuR1ty formation is high duR1ng the addition of base. This necessitates the development of an alternative process, which would offer better conversion and consequently the yield.<br>
With out continued search and intense investigation, we finally achieved identifying a clean process, which can address all the limitations discussed above, and produce the chloromethyl cephem deR1vatives of the formula (I).<br>
Objectives of the Invention<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a simple and effiC1ent process for produC1ng chloromethyl cephem deR1vatives of the formula (I) through 3-chloromethyl azetidinone compounds of the formula (VII).<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for manufactuR1ng chloromethyl azetidinone compounds of the formula (Vll), without<br><br>
employing the hazardous reagents, which are difficult-to-handle in manufacturing scales.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to canny out the preparation of the sulfonyl azetidinone in a clean manner, by controlling the formation of the major impurity &amp; also provide a methodology to remove the side product.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for cyclization of chloromethyl azetidinone compounds of the formula (VII) while minimizing the formation of the impurities and achieve maximum conversion.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process to produce the chlororaethylcephem derivatives of the formula (I)<br><br>
wherein R1 represents a carboxy-protecting group viz., substituted methyl group,<br>
which can be depredated easily, such as t-butyl group, diphenylmethyl, 4-<br>
methoxybenzyl, 2-methoxybenzyl, 2-chlorobenzyl, or benzyl group; R2 represents<br>
hydrogen, (Ci-C4)alkyl, substituted or unsubstantiated phenyl or substituted or<br>
unsubstituted phenoxy, the said process comprising the steps of<br>
(i)       converting a compound of formula (V) to a compound of formula (VI)<br>
where Rg represents substituted or unsubstituted (Ci-C6)alkyl or aryl group<br>
using a metal salt of aryl sulfinic acid or (Ci-C6)alkyl sulfinic acid, a base<br>
and a solvent at a temperature in the range of 25 °C to 40 °C, wherein the<br>
improvement consists of adding the metal salt of aryl sulfinic acid in the pH<br>
range of4 to 8.0,<br>
(ii)      chlorinating the compound of formula (VI) using chlorinating agent in the<br>
presence of base and a solvent at a temperature in the range of 15 °C to 40<br><br>
°C  to produce  a  compound  of formula (VII),  where  R8  represents<br>
substituted or unsubstituted (C1-C6)alkyl  or aryl group and all other<br>
symbols are as defined above, and (vi).   stylizing the   compound of formula (VII) using a  base in a solvent at a<br>
temperature   in   the   range   of     -60   °C   to   +50      °C   to   produce<br>

To the filtrate, cold water (450 ml) was added, organic layer separated, and washed with a solution of sodium thiosulphate followed by water. The organic layer was treated with charcoal, concentrated and worked up as usual to get p-methoxybenzyl 2-(p-to!uenesulfonylthio)-a-( 1 -chloromethylethenyl)-4-oxo-3-phenacetamido-1 -azetidineacetate, which was taken to next step without purification.<br>
Step^<br>
Preparation of p-methoxybenzyl 7-phenacetamido-3-chloromethvl-3-cephem-<br>
4-carboxylate<br>
p-Methoxybenzyl 2-(2-toluenesulfonylthio)-a-(l-chloromethylethenyl)-4-oxo-3-phenacetaraido-1-azetidineacetate (obtained fi-om 25.0 gm of p-methoxybenzyl 6-phenacetamido pencillanate-1 -oxide), obtained according to step-3 of example-1 above, was added to DMF (125 ml) and cooled to -40 °C. A solution of ammonia (11.5 ml) in DMF was added and maintained at the same temperature until the reaction was completed. The reaction mixture was acidified with dil. HCl, filtered. The solid obtained was extracted with DMF: methanol (2:9) with charcoal, concentrated and treated with cold methanol to get p-methoxybenzyl 7-phenacetamido-3-chloromethyl-3-cephem-4-carboxylate. (11.4 gm)<br><br><br>
From the table it can be concluded,<br>
&gt;	pH    adjustment    during    step    (ii)    increases    the   purity    of   2-(p-<br>
toluenesulfonylthio)-a-( 1 -methylethenyl)-4-oxo-3-phenacetamido-1 -<br>
azetidineacetate.<br>
&gt;	The use of NMP at cyclization step gives more yields when compared to<br>
DMF.<br><br>
