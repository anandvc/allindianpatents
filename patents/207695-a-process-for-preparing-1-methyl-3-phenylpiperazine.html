BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Mirtazapine, also known as 2-methyI-1,2,3,4,10,14b-hexahydrobenzo[c]pyrazino-( 1,2-a) pyrido[3,2~f]azepine, is an antidepressant drug suitable for oral administration. Mirtazapine belongs to piperazinoazepine group of compounds and has the following chemical structure.<br><br>
l-Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine is the key intermediate in the preparation of Mirtazapine. US Patent 4,062,848 has described the synthesis of Mirtazapine using l-Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine as starting material. It is believed that the earliest synthesis of this key intermediate is that of Roderick et. al, J. Med. Chem. 1966, 181-185. This publication has reported the preparation of l-MethyI-3-phenyIpiperazine starting from ot-bromophenylacetic acid ester and ethylenediamine resulting in the formation of 2-oxo-3-phenylpiperazine which is then subjected to lithium aluminium hydride reduction and subsequently methylated with methyl iodide and triethylamine in acetone.<br>
The drawback of this method is the non-selective methylation at 1-position. A mixture of products like unreacted 2-phenylpiperazine, l-methyl-2-phenylpiperazine and 1,4-dimethyl-2-phenylpiperazine alongwith the desired 1 -Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine is obtained. Therefore, extensive purification is required to obtain pure l-Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine.<br><br><br>
US Patent 6,495,685 has described the preparation of l-Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine by reacting A^-(2«chIoroethyl)-N-methyl-p-chloro-p-phenylethyIamine (the dichloride) of Formula III with ammonia.<br><br>
This dichloride of Formula III has been prepared by chlorination of the corresponding diol, A/-(2-hydroxyethyl)-A^methyl-P-hydroxy-P-phenylethylamine of Formula IV.<br><br>
In US Patent 6,495,685, this diol has been obtained by reacting styrene oxide with A/-methylethanolamine. However, the described preparation of diol results in the formation of substantial amount of isomeric compound of Formula V due to non-selectivity in this reaction. <br>
The presence of isomeric diol of Formula V results in the formation of corresponding l-methyl-2-phenylpiperazine isomer which contaminates the product and results in lower productivity.<br>
Next, the same dichloride of Formula III has been treated with /Koluenesulfonamide in the US Patent 6,339,156 to obtain tosyl piperazine which is hydrolyzed to produce 1-Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine. However, preparation of dichloride and its isomeric purity has not been discussed in this US Patent.<br>
In view of the prior art described above, the present invention provides a new process for preparing highly pure l-Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine where the formation of 2-phenylpiperazine, 1 -methyl-2-phenylpiperazine isomer and 1,4-dimethyl-2-phenylpiperazine has been avoided.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a new process for preparing highly pure l-Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine suitable for use in the synthesis of Mirtazapine and other tetracyclic compounds. The present invention also relates to a novel intermediate used to carryout this process.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for preparing a novel compound, 4-Benzyl-l-methyl-2-oxo-3-phenylpiperazine, of Formula II<br><br>
with methyl iodide in A^Af-dimethylformamide in presence of sodium hydride. Typically, the methylation is carried out with 1.1 to 1.2 moles of methyl iodide and sodium hydride each per one mole of compound of Formula VI. It is preferred to carryout the methylation by adding compound of Formula VI to the sodium hydride slurry in A^Af-dimethylformamide followed by methyl iodide addition. The temperature during methylation is maintained at 10°C to 25°C and usually it takes 1 hour to complete the reaction.<br>
Reduction of the above mentioned novel piperazine compound is carried out with lithium aluminium hydride in tetrahydrofuran to obtain protected piperazine of Formula VII.<br><br>
This reduction is accomplished with 1.0-1.2 mole of lithium aluminium hydride per mole of the compound of Formula VI at a temperature 40°C to 70°C and preferably at the reflux temperature.<br>
Finally, l-Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine of Formula I is obtained by removing benzyl protecting group through catalytic hydrogenation.    The deprotection is performed by<br><br>
dissolving the compound of Formula VII in acetic acid and subjecting it to hydrogenation at 20°C to 30°C in the presence of 5% palladium-carbon catalyst. The hydrogen pressure is maintained at 80 psi to 100 psi. End point of the reaction is readily confirmed by high performance liquid chromatography and thereafter acetic acid is removed by distillation. An aqueous alkali such as sodium hydroxide is added to the reaction mass containing 1-Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine of Formula I thus obtained to make the solution alkaline, for instance, to pH 11.0 to 12.0. l-Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine can be isolated by extracting with toluene, methylene chloride, ethyl acetate, cyclohexane or the like, preferably with toluene and thereafter distilling the extract.<br>
Alternatively, compound of Formula II can be deprotected to produce compound of Formula VIII<br><br>
which subsequently subjected to lithium aluminium hydride reduction to obtain l-Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine.<br>
The major advantage of the present invention is that l-Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine thus obtained contains none of the impurities like 2-phenylpiperazine, l-methyl-2-phenylpiperazine isomer and l,4-dimethyl-2-phenylpiperazine.<br>
l-Methyl-3-phenylpiperazine as obtained by the method described in this invention can be used in the preparation of Mirtazapine.<br>
The invention is further illustrated by the following examples.<br>
