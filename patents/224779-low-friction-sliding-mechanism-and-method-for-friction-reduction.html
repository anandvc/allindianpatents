				<td>The present invention relates to; a low-friction sliding mechanism; a low-friction agent composition; a method of friction reduction; a manual transmission; and a final reduction gear unit. In more detail, the present invention relates to; a low-friction sliding mechanism that can improve the friction characteristics of various sliding surfaces in, for instance, internal combustion engines and drive system transmission units; a low-friction agent composition and a method of friction reduction; a manual transmission that is provided with a sliding section that is small in the friction coefficient and excellent in the seizure resistance and wear resistance and can exhibit excellent fuel cost over a long term; and a final reduction gear unit that can reduce the friction coefficient in a sliding section and improve the seizure resistance and the wear resistance and reduce the friction resistance to improve the fuel efficiency of an automobile. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Earth scale environment problems such as global warming and destruction of the ozone layer are largely highlighted. In particular, the C02 reduction that is said to largely affect on the warming of the earth as a whole is gathering attention on how to decide the regulation value in each country.<br>
As to the C02 reduction, the reduction of the energy loss due to the friction loss of machines and devices, in particular, the reduction of the fuel cost of automobiles is a large problem. Accordingly, the roles of sliding materials and lubricants are very important in this connection.<br>
A role of the sliding material is to be excellent in the wear resistance and develop excellent wear resistance to sections of which friction and wear environment are severe among the sliding sections of an engine. Recently, various kinds of hard thin film materials are being forwarded in applications. The friction coefficients of general DLC materials are lower in air and in the absence of lubricating oil than that of wear resistant hard coating materials such as TiN and CrN; accordingly, these are expected as low friction sliding materials.<br>
Furthermore, as an energy saving measure in the lubricating oil, for instance, as a fuel efficiency measure of an engine, 1) reduction, caused by lowering the viscosity, of the viscous resistance in a hydrodynamic lubrication region and the agitation resistance in an engine and 2) reduction, owing to blending of an optimum friction modifier and various kinds of additives, of the friction loss under mixed lubrication and boundary lubrication region are proposed. Many researches have been conducted mainly of organic Mo compounds such as MoDTC and MoDTP as the friction modifier. In a sliding surface made of an existing steel material, a lubricating oil composition in which an organic Mo compound that exhibits the excellent low friction coefficient at an early stage of use is advantageously applied.<br>
On the other hand, a general DLC material excellent in the low friction characteristics in air is reported to be, in the presence of the lubricating oil, low in the friction reduction effect (for instance, non-patent literature 1). Furthermore, it has been found that even when a lubricating oil composition containing an organic molybdenum compound is applied to the sliding material the friction reduction effect cannot be sufficiently exerted (for instance, non-patent literature 2).<br>
Non-patent literature 1: Kano et al. , Proceedings of Japanese Tribology Society, p.11 to 12, May, 1999 (Tokyo)<br>
Non-patent literature 2: Kano et al. , Proceeding of World<br>
Tribology Congress Sep., 2001, p. 342, (Vienna)<br>
Then, as to the fuel efficient technology of a manual transmission of an automobile, there is a proposal in which the agitation of lubricating oil by a power transfer is avoided or made very small to inhibit the power transmission efficiency from deteriorating owing to the agitation resistance (for instance, patent literature 1) .<br>
Patent literature 1: JP-A-10-166877<br>
On the other hand, as to the lubricating oil that is used in such a transmission, a lubricating oil composition in which, to lubrication base oil a boron-containing ash-less dispersant, an alkaline-earth metal base detergent and a sulfur base additive are blended is proposed (patent literature 2) . Furthermore, gear oil in which, to base oil that is low in a sulfur content and has predetermined viscosity, primary zinc dithiophosphate, an alkaline earth metal detergent, alkenyl succinic imide having a polybutenyl group having a predetermined molecular weight, a derivative thereof, phosphoric ester amine salt, and a sulfur compound are contained is proposed (patent literature 3).<br>
Patent literature 2: JP-A-2003-82377<br>
Patent literature 3: JP-A-11-181463<br>
Furthermore, as to the fuel efficient technology of the final reduction gear unit of an automobile, with an intention of improving the transmission efficiency at a differential gear, a lubricating oil composition for use in the final reduction gear unit, which contains a phosphorus base extreme pressure agent selected from a specific range, organic acids having a specific structure and a sulfur base extreme pressure agent selected from a specific range in a lubrication base oil, is proposed (patent literature 4).<br>
Patent literature 4: JP-A-6-200274<br>
Still furthermore, in order to reduce the sliding friction loss between a roller end surface and an inner wheel large guard,<br>
a conical roller bearing where a cone center of an outer diameter surface of a conical roller is displaced from a center axis of the inner wheel and the application of such conical roller bearing to an automobile differential are proposed (patent literature 5) .<br>
Patent literature 5: JP-A-2000-192951 DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
In the manual transmission described in patent literature 1, as described above, the reduction of the agitation resistance of the lubricating oil is studied. However, an improvement in the performance and fuel efficient due to the reduction of the friction of the sliding sections, in particular, the compatibility between a sliding member and the lubricating oil is not studied.<br>
Furthermore, as to one that concerns lubricating oil alone, the lubricating oil is formed into a constitution as shown in examples of the patent literatures 2 and 3 to improve the wear inhibition, the fatigue life and the friction characteristics between a synchronizer ring and a gear cone. However, in the study, the characteristics of the sliding member are not particularly considered to reduce the friction coefficient.<br>
Furthermore, in the lubricating oil composition for use in the final reduction gear unit, which is described in the patent literature 4, aprescription is studied to improve the transmission efficiency in the gear section. Still furthermore, in the patent literature 5, an improvement in a structure of the conical roller bearing is studied to reduce the friction loss. However, the reduction of the friction of the sliding surface itself and the compatibility between the sliding member and the lubricating oil are not studied.<br>
The invention is achieved considering such problems that existing technologies have; and intends to provide a low-friction sliding mechanism, a low-friction agent composition and a friction reduction method that can exert very excellent low friction<br>
characteristics to a sliding surface present under various applications, and, in particular, that have more excellent low friction characteristics than that of a combination of the existing steel material and the organic Mo compound.<br>
Furthermore, the invention intends to provide a manual transmission that can reduce the friction coefficient in various kinds of sliding sections in themanual transmission suchas bearing sections to improve the seizure resistance and the wear resistance and to reduce the sliding resistance of the respective sections to contribute in improving the fuel efficiency of an automobile.<br>
Still furthermore, the invention intends to provide a final reduction gear unit that can reduce the friction coefficient in various kinds of sliding sections in the final reduction gear unit such as a section between a back surface of a side gear that slidably comes into contact through a washer and an internal surface of a differential case to improve the seizure resistance and the wear resistance and to reduce the sliding resistance of the respective sections to contribute in improving the fuel efficiency of an automobile.<br>
The inventors, after studying hard to overcome the above problems, found that a combination of sliding members at least one of which is a DLC material and a specific compound shows the friction characteristics very excellent to an extent that cannot be realized from an existing lubrication theory, and thereby come to completion of the invention.<br>
Furthermore, the inventors found that, when one or both of sliding surfaces that slidingly contact each other are provided thereon with a hard carbon thin film less in hydrogen content, in the presence of a low-friction agent composition, the friction coefficient can be largely reduced. Furthermore, the inventors found that, in a sliding member covered with such a hard carbon thin film, in order to realize low friction coefficient and to improve the seizure resistance and the wear resistance, an additive<br>
used in the low-friction agent composition affects to no small extent. Thereby, the invention comes to completion.<br>
In the low-friction sliding mechanism according to the invention, when in a sliding surface made of a DLC coated sliding member an oxygen-containing organic compound or an aliphatic amine compound is included, the friction characteristics more excellent than that of an existing combination of a sliding member and a low-friction agent composition can be obtained.<br>
Furthermore, the manual transmission according to the invention reduces the friction coefficients in various kinds of sliding sections such as a bearing section, improves the seizure resistance and the wear resistance, and furthermore reduces the sliding resistance in various sections to contribute to improve the fuel efficiency of an automobile.<br>
Still furthermore, the final reduction gear unit according to the invention reduces the friction coefficient: between a back surface of a side gear and an inner surface of a differential case, improves the seizure resistance and the wear resistance, and furthermore reduces the sliding resistance in various sections to contribute to improve the fuel efficiency of an automobile.

In what follows, a low-friction sliding mechanism and a low-friction agent composition according to the invention will be more detailed. In the specification, "%" denotes a mass percentage unless otherwise stated.<br>
Such a low-friction sliding mechanism is formed by including a low-friction agent composition between sliding surfaces that the sliding members form when a DLC coated sliding member (A) and a sliding member (B) are slid. As the low-friction agent composition, one that contains at least one kind selected from a group consisting of an oxygen-containing organic compound (C) and an aliphatic amine compound (D) is used. Thereby, the DLC coated sliding member and the sliding member slide each other at the extremely lower friction than ever.<br>
Here, a DLC (Diamond-Like Carbon) material used in the DLC coated sliding member (A) is an amorphous mainly made of carbon element, and a bonding state between carbons is made of both of a diamond structure (SP3 bond) and a graphite bond (SP2 bond). Specifically, a-C (amorphous carbon) entirely made of carbon element, a-C: H (hydrogen amorphous carbon) containing hydrogen and MeC partially containing a metal element such as titanium (Ti) or molybdenum (Mo) can be cited. In the low-friction sliding mechanism according to the invention, from a viewpoint of expressing a large friction reduction effect, the DLC material is preferably made of an a-C material that does not contain hydrogen. Furthermore, in the DLC material, with an increase in the hydrogen content, the friction coefficient increases. Accordingly, the hydrogen content is preferably 20 atomic percent or less. Still<br>
furthermore, in order to sufficiently lower the friction coefficient during sliding in the low friction agent composition and to secure more stable sliding characteristics, the hydrogen content is desirably 10 atomic percent or less, more desirably 5 atomic percent or less and still more desirably 0 . 5 atomic percent or less. The DLC material with such a low hydrogen content can be obtained by depositing by use of a PVD method that substantially does not use hydrogen or a hydrogen-containing compound such as a sputtering method or an ion plating method.<br>
In this case, in order to reduce an amount of hydrogen in a film, it is desirable not only to use a gas that does not contain hydrogen during the deposition but also, as needs arise, to bake a reaction vessel and a base material holder and to thoroughly cleanse a surface of the base material before deposition.<br>
Furthermore, as a base material that is used in the DLC coated sliding member (A), for instance, carburized steel, hardened steel and non-ferrous metals such as aluminum can be used.<br>
As to the surface roughness of the base material before DLC coating, since a film thickness of a hard carbon thin film is rather thin and the surface roughness of a deposited film is largely affected, the surface roughness Ra (center line average roughness) is preferably 0 .1 µm or less . That is, when the surface roughness Ra of the base material is such coarse as to exceed 0.1 µm, since projections caused from the roughness of the film surface increase local contact pressure with a counterpart, the likelihood of inducing cracking of the film becomes higher.<br>
Furthermore, a constituent material of the sliding member (B) is not particularly restricted. Specifically, metal materials such as ferrous materials, aluminum base materials, magnesium base materials and titanium base materials can be cited. In particular, the ferrous materials, aluminum base materials and magnesium base materials, being readily applicable to sliding<br>
sections of existing machines and devices and able to widely contribute to an energy saving measure in various fields, are preferable.<br>
Still furthermore, as the constituent materials of the sliding member (B) , non-metal materials such as resins, plastics and carbon can be used as well.<br>
Furthermore, materials obtained by applying various kinds of thin film coating on the metal materials and non-metal materials are useful as well.<br>
The ferrous materials are not particularly restricted. Not only high purity iron, but also various kinds of ferrous alloys (nickel, copper, zinc, chromium, cobalt, molybdenum, lead, silicon or titanium, and ones obtained by arbitrarily combining these) can be used. Specifically, for instance, carburized steel SCM420 or SCr420 (JIS) can be cited.<br>
Furthermore, the aluminum base materials are not particularly restricted. Not only high purity aluminum but also various kinds of aluminum base alloys can be used. Specifically, for instance, a hypoeutectic aluminum alloy containing 4 to 20% silicon (Si) and 1.0 to 5.0% copper or a hypereutectic aluminum alloy can be desirably used. As preferable example of the aluminum alloy, for instance, AC2A, AC8A, ADC12 and ADC14 (JIS) can be cited.<br>
, Among the sliding members (B) , the metal materials provided with various kinds of coating are not particularly restricted. Specifically, various kinds of metal materials such as metal base materials obtained by applying a thin film of TiN, CrN or the DLC material on a surface of the ferrous materials, aluminum base materials, magnesium base materials or titanium base materials can be cited. Among these, the metal material coated with the DLC material is preferable. Furthermore, the DLC material is preferably the a-C diamond-like carbon that does not contain hydrogen.<br>
Furthermore, from the sliding stability, the surface roughness Ra of each of the DLC coated sliding member (A) and the sliding member (B) (for instance, metal materials or the metal materials coated with various kinds of thin film) is 0.1 urn or less and preferably 0 . 08 Jim or less . When it exceeds 0 .1 µm, local scaffing is caused to result in a large increase in the friction coefficient in some cases.<br>
Still furthermore, in the DLC coated sliding member (A), it is preferable that the surface hardness thereof is in the range of HvlOOO to 3500 in the micro-Vickers hardness (10 g load) and a DLC film thickness is in the range of 0.3 to 2.0 µm. When the surface hardness and the thickness of the DLC coated sliding member (A) are outside of the above-mentioned ranges to be less than HvlOOO in the surf ace hardness and less than 0 . 3 µm in the thickness, the DLC coated sliding member becomes easily worn, by contrast,<br>
when they exceed Hv3500 and 2 . 0 µm, respectively, it becomes easily peeled, and, when the surface hardness of the ferrous member is outside thereof to be less than HRC45, under high pressure, in some cases, it becomes easier to buckle and peel.<br>
In the case of a ferrous material being used in the sliding member (B), the surface hardness thereof is preferably in the range of HRC45 to 60 in Rockwell hardness C-scale. In this case, even under a high surface pressure sliding condition such as substantially 700 MPa like in a cam follower member, the durability of the film can be effectively maintained.<br>
Furthermore, in the case of an aluminum base material being used in the sliding member (B) , the surface hardness thereof is preferably in the range of HB80 to 130 in Brinell hardness. When the surface hardness of the aluminum base material is outside of the above range to be less than HB80, the aluminum base material becomes easily worn.<br>
Still furthermore, in the case of a thin film-coated metal material being used in the sliding member (B), in particular,<br>
in the case of the DLC-coated metal material being used, it is preferable that the surface hardness thereof is in the range of HvlOOO to 3500 in the micro-Vickers hardness (10 g load) and a DLC film thickness is in the range of 0.3 to 2.0 urn. When the surface hardness and the thickness thereof are outside of the above-mentioned ranges to be less than HvlOOO in the surface hardness and less than 0.3 urn in the thickness, the abrasion is easily caused, by contrast, when they exceed Hv3500 and 2.0 µm, in some cases, peeling is easily caused.<br>
Sliding surfaces made of the DLC coated sliding member (A) and the sliding member (B) , as long as these are sliding surfaces where two sliding surfaces come into contact through a low- friction agent composition, can be used without particular restrictions. For instance, sliding sections of internal combustion engines such as 4-cycle engines and 2-cycle engines (for instance, a valve operating system, a piston, a piston ring, a piston skirt, a cylinder liner, a con-rod, a crank shaft, a bearing, a roller bearing, metal, a gear, a chain, a belt, an oil pump and the like) , sliding sections of a driving system transmission mechanism (for instance, gear) and a hard disc drive, and other various sliding surfaces where the friction conditions are severe and the low friction properties are demanded are targeted. In the sliding surfaces, when only at least one of the sliding members is DLC-coated and at least one kind selected from the oxygen-containing organic compound and aliphatic amine compound is supplied, more than ever lubricant and extremely excellent low friction characteristics can be effectively obtained.<br>
For instance, as preferable embodiments in a valve operating system of an internal combustion engine, sliding surfaces made of a disc-like shim and a lifter crown surface where the DLC is coated on a substrate of a steel material and a cam lobe that uses a material involving low-alloy chilled iron, carburized steel or tempered carbon steel, and arbitrary<br>
combinations thereof can be cited.<br>
On the other hand, the aforementioned oxygen-containing organic compound (C) in the low-friction sliding mechanism of the invention is not particularly restricted and can be any organic compound containing oxygen in the molecule. For example, it may be an oxygen-containing organic compound constituted of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The oxygen-containing organic compound may contain another element such as nitrogen, sulfur, halogen (fluorine, chlorine etc.), phosphorus, boron, a metal, or the like. Particularly in view of further reducing the friction in the sliding surfaces of one sliding member (DLC coated sliding member) (A) and the other sliding member (B) , there is preferred an oxygen-containing organic compound constituted of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen and containing a hydroxyl group, or a derivative thereof, in which it is more preferred that two or more hydroxyl groups are contained. Also for the same reason, there is more preferred an oxygen-containing organic compound with a low sulfur content or free from sulfur.<br>
Also a "derivative" used herein is not particularly restricted and can be, for example, a compound obtained by reacting an oxygen-containing organic compound constituted of carbon, hydrogen and oxygen with a nitrogen-containing compound, a phosphorus-containing compound, sulfur or a sulfur-containing compound, a boron-containing compound, a halogen element or a halogen-containing compound, a metal element, a metal-containing compound (organic or inorganic), or the like.<br>
The aforementioned oxygen-containing organic compound (C) can specifically be a compound containing a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, a carbonyl group, an ester bond or an ether bond (two or more kinds of such group or bond may also be contained) , preferably contains one or more kinds of group or bond selected from a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, a carbonyl group, and an ester bond, more preferably is an oxygen-containing organic<br>
compound containing one or more kinds of group or bond selected from a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group and an ester group, further preferably is an oxygen-containing organic compound containing one or more kinds of group selected from a hydroxyl group and a carboxyl group, and particularly preferably an oxygen-containing organic compound containing one or more hydroxyl groups.<br>
More specific examples of the oxygen-containing organic compound include alcohols (I) , carboxylic acids (II) , esters (III) , ethers (IV), ketones (V) , aldehydes (VI), carbonates (these compounds may further contain one or more kinds of group or bond selected from a hydroxyl group, a carboxyl group, a carbonyl group, an ester bond and an ether bond) (VII), derivatives thereof and an arbitrary mixture thereof.<br>
The above-mentioned alcohols (I) are oxygen-containing organic compounds represented by the following general formula (1) :<br>

Further, Although the number of such hydroxyl groups in the compound is particularly not limited, it is preferable to have more hydroxyl groups because of being excellent in friction lowering effect. However, there is a case where the number of hydroxyl groups is limited from the viewpoint of solubility, in case of being used together with a medium such as lubricating oil discussed after.<br>

When the carbon number of the hydrocarbon chain is not within the range of 6 to 30, there arises a possibility that the lubricating oil may not produce a sufficient friction reducing effect as expected. It is a matter of course that other hydrocarbon groups are had if straight or branched aliphatic hydrocarbon groups within the above carbon number range.<br>
Specific examples of the C6-C30 straight or branched hydrocarbon chain include: alkyl groups, such as hexyl, heptyl, octyl, nonyl, decyl, undecyl, dodecyl, tridecyl, tetradecyl, pentadecyl, hexadecyl, heptadecyl, octadecyl, nonadecyl, icosyl, heneicosyl, docosyl, tricosyl, tetracosyl,pentacosyl,hexacosyl, heptacosyl, octacosyl, nonacosyl and triacontyl; and alkenyl groups, such as hexenyl, heptenyl, octenyl, nonenyl, decenyl, undecenyl, dodecenyl, tridecenyl, tetradecenyl, pentadecenyl, hexadecenyl, heptadecenyl, octadecenyl, nonadecenyl, icosenyl, heneicosenyl, docosenyl, tricosenyl, tetracosenyl, pentacosenyl, hexacosenyl, heptacosenyl, octacosenyl, nonacosenyl and triacontenyl.<br>

The above-mentioned oxygen-containing compound (C) and aliphatic amine compound (D) are used in a sliding surfaces of the DLC coated sliding member (A) and the sliding member (B), singly (or in an amount of 100 %) as the low-friction agent composition, thereby exhibiting an extremely excellent low friction characteristics. However, as the low-friction agent composition in the present invention one in which other components are blended to the oxygen-containing organic compound (C) and/or the aliphatic amine compound (D)may be used and supplied to the sliding surfaces so as to lubricate the sliding surfaces. As the other components, a medium such as lubricating oil base oil, various additives and the like are exemplified.<br>
The contained amount of the oxygen-containing organic compound (C) or the aliphatic amine compound (D) is not particularly restricted; however, the lower limit of the contained amount based on the total amount (total mass) of the low-friction agent composition is normally 0 . 001 %, pref erably 0 . 05 %, more preferably 0.1%, particularly pref erably 0.5% from the viewpoint of friction reduction effect. The upper limit of the contained amount is 100 % as mentioned above. In case that other components, particularly the medium is blended, the upper limit based on the total amount of the low-friction agent composition is normally 50 %, preferably 20 %m, more preferably 10 %, particularly preferably 5 % from the viewpoint of solubility to the medium and storage stability. In the present invention, even addition of the oxygen-containing organic compound (C) and/or the aliphatic amine compound (D) in a small amount of about 0.1 to 2 % can exhibit an excellent low friction characteristics. Additionally, if the solubility and storing stability of the aliphatic amine compound (D) to the medium is taken into serious consideration, it is preferable that the upper limit is preferably 3.0 %, more preferably 2.0 %, further preferably 1.4 %.<br>
As the above-mentioned medium, concrete examples are<br>
mineral oil, synthetic oil, natural fat and oil, diluted oil, grease, wax, hydrocarbons having the carbon number of 3 to 40, hydrocarbon solvents, organic solvents other than the hydrocarbon solvents, water and the like, and a mixture of these, and particularly these in the state of liquid, grease or wax under a sliding condition and at a normal temperature.<br>
As the above-mentioned medium there is particularly preferably employed a lubricating oil base oil (a base oil of the lubricating oil) . Such lubricating oil base oil is not particularly limited and any ordinary base oil, either mineral oil type or synthetic type, for lubricant composition can be employed.<br>
Examples of the lubricating oil base oil of mineral oil type include a product formed by subjecting a lubricant fraction, obtained as a result of atmospheric distillation or vacuum distillation of crude oil, to at least one of solvent deasphalting, solvent extraction, hydrocracking, solvent dewaxing, hydrorefining and wax isomerization, particularly a base oil subjected to hydrocracking, hydrorefining or wax isomerization. Among such products, there is preferred a mineral oil obtained by hydrorefining or hydrocracking, or an isoparaffinic mineral oil obtained by isomerization of GTL (gas-to-liquid) wax by a Fischer-Tropsche process or of normal paraffin-rich wax obtained in a dewaxing step of lubricant oil.<br>
Examples of the lubricating oil base oil of synthetic type include an alkylnaphthalene, an alkylbenzene, a polybutene and a hydrogena ted product thereof; a poly-a-olefin such as a 1-octene oligomer, a 1-decene oligomer, an ethylene propylene oligomer or a hydrogenated product thereof; an isobutene oligomer and a hydrogenated product of isobutene oligomer; isoparaffin, alkylbenzene, alkylnaphthalene, diester (for example, trimethylpropane ester such as trimethylpropane capryoate, trimethylpropane pelargonate, trimethylolpropane pelargonate,<br>
trimethylolpropane isostearinate and the like; and pentaerythritol ester such as penthaerythritol-2-ethyhexanoete, pentaerythritol pelargonate), polyoxyalkylene glycol, dialykyldiphenyl ether, polyphenyl ether and the like; and mixtures of these. Preferable examples of the synthetic<br>
lubricating oil base oil are poly-cc-olefin such as 1-octene oligomer, 1-decene oligomer and the like, and hydrogena ted product thereof.<br>
In addition to the use of the lubricating oil base oil of mineral oil type or the lubricating oil base oil of synthetic type either singly or as a mixture, it is also possible to use a mixture of two or more kinds of the base oil of mineral oil type or the base oil of synthetic type. Also in such mixture, a mixing ratio of two or more kinds of the base oils is not particularly restricted and can be selected arbitrarily.<br>
A total aromatic content of the lubricating oil base oil is not particularly restricted, but is preferably 15 % or less, more preferably 10 % or less and further preferably 8 %. A total aromatic content in the lubricating oil base oil exceeding 15 % results in an inferior stability to oxidation and is undesirable. A composition of a high friction reducing effect can be obtained even with a total aromatic content in the lubricating oil base oil of 2 % or less, or even 0 %, for example of lubricating oil base oil such as a highly hydrocracking mineral oil, a wax isomerized mineral oil, apoly-a-olef in or a hydrogena ted product, a hydrogenated product of 1-decene oligomer, polyole ester, or a mixture thereof. In case the content of the organic oxygen-containing organic compound (C) (excluding esters as the lubricating oil base oil) is higher (for example, at 2 % or higher, since the storage stability may be deteriorated, it is preferable, if necessary, to regulate the total aromatic content: (for example at 2% or higher) of the lubricating oil base oil by blending a solvent extracted mineral oil or an alkylbenzene, or to employ<br>
an ester as the lubricating oil base oil, thereby raising the solubility of the oxygen-containing compound (C). The "total aromatic content" means a content of an aromatic fraction measured according to ASTM D2549, and such aromatic fraction ordinarily contains alkylbenzenes, alkylnaphthalenes, anthracene, phenanthrene, alkylated substances thereof, a compound in which four or more benzene rings are condensed, and compounds containing heteroaromatic structure such as pyridines, quinolines, phenols and naphthols.<br>
Further, the sulfur content in the lubricating oil base oil is not particularly restricted. The sulfur content based on the total amount of the base oil is preferably not more than 0.2%, more preferably not more than 0.1, further preferably not more than 0.05 %. Particularly, hydrogenated purified mineral oil or synthetic base oil has a sulfur content of not more than 0.005 % or substantially does not contain sulfur (not more than 5 ppm) , and therefore these are preferably used as the base oil.<br>
Also the lubricating oil base oil is not particularly restricted in a kinematic viscosity thereof, but. in case of use as a lubricant composition for an internal combustion engine,<br>
a kinematic viscosity at 100°C is preferably 2 mm2/s or higher, and more preferably 3 mm2/s or higher. Also an upper limit is preferably 20 mm2/s or less, more preferably 10 mm2/s or less and particularly preferably 8 mm2/s or less. A lubricating oil base oil with a kinematic viscosity at 100°C of 2 mm2/s or higher allows to obtain a composition capable of sufficient oil film formation, an excellent lubricating property and a smaller evaporation loss of the base oil under a high temperature condition. On the other hand, a kinematic viscosity at 100°C of 20 mm2/s or less reduces a fluid resistance, thereby allowing to obtain a composition with a smaller frictipnal resistance in a lubricated site. If the kinematic viscosity is less than 2 mm2/s, there is the possibility that a sufficient frictional resistance can be obtained while<br>
a vaporizing characteristics is inferior, which is not preferable . If the kinematic viscosity exceeds 20 mm2/s, there is the possibility that a low friction characteristics is difficult to be exhibited while a low temperature characteristics are degraded, which are not preferable. In the present invention, a mixture which are prepared by freely mixing two or more base oils selected from the above-mentioned base oils can be used, in which the base oils having the kinematic viscosity (as a single base oil) other than the above-mentioned can be also used as far as the base oils have a kinematic viscosity at 100°C which viscosity is within the above-mentioned preferable range.<br>
Furthermore, a viscosity index of the lubricating oil base oil is not particularly restricted but is preferably 80 or higher, and, in case of use as a lubricant composition for an internal combustion engine, it is preferably 100 or higher, more preferably 120 or higher, andmaybe within a range of 140 to 250 . A lubricating oil base oil of ahigh viscosity index allows to obtain a composition excellent not only in a low-temperature viscosity characteristics but also in a less oil consumption, a fuel efficiency characteristics, and a friction reducing effect.<br>
The low-friction agent composition may further include an ashless dispersant, an abrasion preventing agent or an extreme pressure agent, a metal-based detergent, an antioxidant, a viscosity index improver, a friction modifier agent other than (C) and (D), an antirusting agent, a nonionic surfactant, an antiemulsifier agent, a metal deactivator, or a defoaming agent singly or in a combination of plural kinds, for improving required performances.<br>
As the ashless dispersant, various known ashless dispersants can be employed. For example polybutenylsuccinimide or a derivative thereof can be advantageously employed.<br>
The above-mentioned polybutenyl succinimide include compounds represented by the following chemical formulas (1) and<br>
PIB in these chemical formulae represents a polybutenyl group derived from polybutene. The polybutene can be prepared by polymerizing high-purity isobutene or a mixture of 1-butene and isobutene in the presence of a boron fluoride catalyst or an aluminum chloride catalyst in such a manner that the polybutene attains a number-average molecular weight of 900 to 3,500, preferably 1,000 to 2,000. When the number-average molecular weight of the polybutene is less than 900, there is a possibility of failing to attain a sufficient detergent effect. When the number-average molecular weight of the polybutene exceeds 3,500, the polybutene may undesirably deteriorate in low-temperature fluidity.<br>
In each of the chemical formulae, n represents an integer of 1 to 5, preferably 2 to 4, so as to attain a good detergent effect. In the production of the polybutenyl succinimide, the polybutene may be used after purified by removing trace amounts<br>
of fluorine and chlorine residues, which result from the above polybutene production catalyst, by any suitable treatment (such as adsorption process or washing process). The amount of the fluorine and chlorine residues is preferably controlled to 50 ppm or less, more preferably 10 ppm or less, most preferably 1 ppm or less.<br>
The production method of the polybutenyl succinimide is not particularly restricted. For example, the polybutenyl succinimide can be prepared by reacting an chloride of the above-mentioned polybutene, or the polybutene from which fluorine and chlorine residues are removed, with maleic anhydride at 100 to 200°C to form polybutenyl succinate, and then, reacting the thus-formed polybutenyl succinate with polyamine (such as diethylene triamine, triethylene tetramine, tetraethylene pentamine or pentaethylene hexamine).<br>
The polybutenyl succinimide derivative can be exemplified by boron- and acid-modified compounds obtained by reacting the polybutenyl succinimide of the formulas (1) and (2) with boron compounds or oxygen-containing organic compounds so as to neutralize or amidate the whole or part of the remaining amino and/or imide groups. Among these, boron-containing polybutenyl succinimide, especially boron-containing<br>
bis(polybutenyl)succinimide, is preferably used.<br>

dipropyl borate, tripropyl borate, monobutyl borate, dibutyl borate and tributyl borate. Herein, the content ratio of nitrogen to boron (B/N) by mass in the boron-containing polybutenyl succinimide is usually 0.1 to 3, preferably 0.2 to 1.<br>
The above oxygen-containing organic compound can be exemplified by: C1-C30 monocarboxylic acids, such as formic acid, acetic acid, glycolic acid, propionic acid, lactic acid, butyric acid, valeric acid, caproic acid, enanthic acid, caprylic acid, pelargonic acid, capric acid, undecylic acid, lauric acid, tridecanoic acid, myristic acid, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, oleic acid, nonadecanoic acid and eicosanoic acid; C2-C3o polycarboxylic acids, such as oxalic acid, phthalic acid, trimellitic acid and pyromellitic acid, and anhydrides and esters thereof; C2-C6 alkylene oxides; and hydroxy(poly)oxyalkylene carbonates.<br>
The amount of the polybutenyl succinimide and/or the derivative thereof added in the low-friction agent composition is not particularly restricted, and is preferably 0.1 to 15%, more preferably 1.0 to 12%, based on the total amount of the lubricating oil. When the amount of the polybutenyl succineimide and/or the derivative thereof is less than 0.1%, there arises a possibility of failing to attain a sufficient detergent effect. It becomes uneconomical when the amount of the polybutenyl succineimide and/or the derivative thereof exceeds 15%. In addition, such a large amount of the polybutenyl succineimide and/or the derivative thereof tends to cause a deterioration in demulsification ability.<br>
The ashless dispersant other than the above-mentioned can be exemplified by polybutenylbenzylamines and polybutenylamines each having polybutenyl groups of number-average molecular weight of 900 to 3,500, polybutenyl succinimides having polybutenyl groups of number-average molecular weight of less than 900 and derivatives thereof.<br>

The zinc dithiophosphate is preferably contained in an amount of 0.1% or less, more preferably in an amount of 0 . 06% or less, most preferably in a minimum effective amount, in terms of the phosphorus element based on the total amount of the lubricating oil in order to produce a higher friction reducing effect. When the amount of the zinc dithiophosphate exceeds 0.1%, there arises a possibility of inhibiting the excellent friction reduction effect of the oxygen-containing organic compound (C) at sliding surfaces of the DLC member and various metal materials, particularly iron-based material.<br>
The zinc dithiophosphate canbepreparedby any known method. For example, the zinc dithiophosphate may be prepared by reacting alcohols or phenols having the above R4, R5, R6 and R7 hydrocarbon groups with phosphorous pentasulfide to form dithiophosphoric acid, and then, neutralizing the thus-formed dithiophosphoric acid with zinc oxide. Herein, the molecular structure of zinc dithiophosphate differs according to the alcohols and the like used as a raw material for the zinc dithiophosphate production.<br>
The other anti-friction agent or extreme-pressure additive can be exemplified by disulfides, sulfurized fats and oils, olefin sulfides, phosphate esters having one to three C2-C20 hydrocarbon groups, thiophosphate esters, phosphite esters, thiophosphite esters and amine salts of these esters.<br>
The metallic detergent can be any metallic-detergent compound commonly used for a lubricating oil.

In connection with the present invention, sodium and calcium sulfonates, sodium and calcium phenates, and sodium and calcium salicylates are suitably used. The total base number and amount of the metallic detergent can be selected in accordance with the lubricating oil performance required. The total base number of the metallic detergent is usually 0 to 500 mgKOH/g, preferably 150 to 400 mgKOH/g, as measured by perchloric acid method according to ISO 3771 "Determination of base number - Perchloric acid potentiometric titration method". The amount of the metallic detergent is usually 0.1 to 10% based on the total amount of the lubricating oil.<br>
The antioxidant can be any antioxidant compound commonly used for a lubricating oil. Specific examples of the antioxidant usable in connection with the present invention include: phenolic antioxidants, such as<br>

The amount of the antioxidant is usually 0.01 to 5% based on the total amount of the lubricating oil.<br>
The viscosity index improver can be concretely exemplified by: non-dispersion type viscosity index improvers, such as copolymers of-one or two monomers selected from various methacrylic acids, and hydrides of the copolymers; and dispersion type viscosity index improvers, such as copolymers of methacrylates<br>
(including nitrogen compounds). There may be also used, as the viscosity index improver, copolymers of ethylene and a-olefins<br>
(such as propylene, 1-butene and 1-pentene) and hydrides thereof, polyisobutylenes and hydrides thereof, a hydrogenated copolymer of styrene and diene, a copolymer of styrene and maleic anhydride<br>
and polyalkylstyrenes.<br>
The molecular weight of the viscosity index improver needs to be selected in view of shear stability. For example, the number-average molecular weight of the viscosity index improver is desirably in a range of 5,000 to 1,000,000, more desirably 100,000 to 800,000, for dispersion or non-dispersion type polymethacrylates; in a range of 800 to 5, 000 f or polyisobutylenes and hydrides thereof; and in a range of 800 to 300,000, more desirably 10, 000 to 200, 000 for ethylene/aolef in copolymers and hydrides thereof. The above viscosity index improving compounds can be used alone or in the form of a mixture of two or more thereof . The amount of the viscosity index improver is preferably 0.1 to 40.0% based on the total amount of the lubricating oil.<br>

The metal deactivator can be exemplified by imidazoline, pyrimidine derivatives, thiadizol, benzotriazole, thiadiazole and the like.<br>

In case that these additives are contained in the low-friction agent composition used in the present invention, the contents of them are as follows: The friction modifier other than (C) and (D) , the content of the rust inhibitor and demulsif ier<br>
can be suitably selected from the range of 0.01 to 5% based on the total amount of the composition; and the content of the metal deactivator can be suitably selected from the range of 0.0005 to 1% based on the total amount of the composition.<br>
In the next place, a friction reduction method according to the invention will be detailed.<br>
In such a friction reduction method, between sliding surfaces made of a DLC coated sliding member (A) covered with diamond-like carbon and a sliding member (B) that uses a metal material, a non-metal material or a coated material obtained by coating a thin film on a surface thereof, and an arbitrary combination thereof, a low-friction agent composition is interposed, at least one kind selected from a group consisting of an oxygen-containing organic compound (C) and an aliphatic amine compound (D) being supplied between the sliding surfaces. Thereby, the low friction characteristics of various sliding surfaces can be improved.<br>
Then, a manual transmission according to the invention will be detailed.<br>
A manual transmission according to the invention uses the foregoing low-friction sliding mechanism and includes a sliding section formed by coating diamond-like carbon on at least one of sliding surfaces of sliding members that slide each other in the presence of the low-friction agent composition. Thereby, since the friction coefficient of the sliding section is reduced, the seizure resistance and the wear resistance are improved, and, because of low sliding resistance in the various sections, the fuel consumption of an automobile can be improved.<br>
Fig. 1 is a sectional view showing an example of a sliding section in an automobile manual transmission according to the invention. A manual transmission 1 according to the invention includes, in a clutch housing, an input shaft 3 supported freely rotatablyby two ball bearings 2a and 2b; and a main shaft 5 supported<br>
freely rotatably by a roller bearing 4a and a ball bearing 4b, to the input shaft a 3-speed input gear 3a and a 4-speed input gear 3b, respectively, being rotatably engaged through needle bearings 2c and 2d, a 5-speed input gear 3c being fixed.<br>
On the other hand, to the main shaft 5, a 1-speed main gear 5a engaging with a gear 3d formed to the input shaft 3 and a 2-speed main gear 5b engaging with a gear 3e of the input shaft 3, respectively, are rotatably engaged through a needle bearing 4c and a needle bearing 4d attached through a 2-speed bush 6a. Furthermore, to the main shaft 5, a 5-speed main gear 5c engaging with a 5-speed input gear 3c of the input shaft 3 is rotatably engaged through a needle bearing 4e attached through a 5-speed bush 6b.<br>
In the manual transmission 1 according to the invention, in a sliding section between an input shaft 3 and a needle bearing 2c of a 3-speed input gear 3a and on a surface on a side of the input shaft 3 in a sliding section between an input shaft 3 and a needle bearing 2d of a 4-speed input gear 3b, a hard carbon thin film can be coated. It goes without saying that a hard carbon thin film may be coated on surfaces of the needle bearings 2c and 2d, and hard carbon coat may be formed on both thereof.<br>
Furthermore, as to the main shaft 5, a hard carbon thin film can be coated on a surface of a main shaft 5 in a sliding section between the main shaft 5 and a needle bearing 4c of the 1-speed main gear 5a; and on surfaces of bushes 6a and 6b in a sliding section between a 2-speed bush 6a of the main shaft 5 and a needle bearing 4d and in a sliding section between a 5-speed bush 6b and a needle bearing 4e . In this case as well, on a surface of the needle bearing 4a, 4b or 4e, or on both of sliding surfaces that contact and slide each other, a hard carbon thin coat can be formed.<br>
On inner periphery surfaces of the 3-speed input gear 3a, 4-speed input gear 3b, 1-speed main gear 5a, 2-speed main gear<br>
5b and 5-speed main gear 5c that contact and slide each other with the respective needle bearings 2c, 2d, 4c, 4d and 4e, respectively, a hard carbon coat may be desirably formed as needs arise.<br>
In the above, an example is shown where on five sliding sections in total, that is, the 3-speed input gear 3a and 4-speed input gear 3b of the input shaft 3, the 1-speed main gear 5a of the main shaft 5, the 2-speed main gear 5b and the 5-speed main gear 5c, a hard carbon thin film is formed. The hard carbon thin film may be formed on other sliding sections such as the respective sliding sections of the ball bearings 2a, 2b, 4b and the roller bearing 4a that rotatably support the input shaft 3 and the main shaft 5.<br>
Furthermore, the low-friction agent composition used in the manual transmission, when used on a sliding surface with a hard carbon thin film such as DLC, expresses very excellent low friction characteristics. However, in particular, in order to improve performance necessary as a working oil of the transmission, a metal base cleaning agent, an oxidation inhibitor, a viscosity index improver, other ash-free friction regulator, other ash-free dispersing agent, an abrasion inhibiting agent or an extreme pressure agent, a rust preventive, a nonionic surfactant, an anti - emulsifying agent, a metal deac tivator and a def oaming agent, when added singularly or in a combination of several kinds thereof, can improve necessary performance.<br>
In the next place, a final reduction gear unit according to the invention will be detailed.<br>
The final reduction gear unit according to the invention uses the foregoing low-friction sliding mechanism and includes a sliding section formed by coating diamond-like carbon on at least one of sliding surfaces of sliding members that slide each other in the presence of the low-friction agent composition. Thereby, since the friction coefficient of the sliding section<br>
can be reduced, the seizure resistance and the wear resistance can be improved, and the sliding resistance of the various sections is low, the fuel consumption of an automobile can be improved.<br>
Fig. 2 is a sectional view showing an example of a sliding section in an automobile final reduction gear unit according to the invention. The final reduction gear unit 20 includes, in a differential carrier (reduction gear box) 22, a drive shaft 23 provided with a drive pinion 23a at a tip end thereof; a differential case 25 to which a ring gear 25a engaging with the drive pinion 23a is fixed and that is rotatably supported by the differential carrier 22 through a side bearing 24; two side gears 26 rotatably supported inside of the differential case 25; and two pinion mate gears 28 that are rotatably supported by a pinion mate shaft 27 inside of the differential case 25 and that engage with the side gears 26, respectively, the drive shaft 23 being rotatably supported by the differential carrier 22 through two roller bearings 29 and connected to a propeller shaft.<br>
In the final reduction gear unit 20, when the propeller shaft is rotated, the rotation is transmitted through the drive pinion 23a and the ring gear 25a to the differential case 25. When a vehicle goes straight ahead, the differential case 25 integrally rotates with the side gear 26 and the pinion mate gear 28, and thereby left and right driving wheel axles rotate at the same speed.<br>
On the other hand, when a vehicle approaches a curve, owing to an increase in the resistance of an inner axle, the side gear 26 and the pinion mate gear 28, respectively, rotate in the differential case 5, the rotation of the inner axle becomes slower, by just that much, the outer axle becomes larger in the rotation speed to enable to smoothly change a direction of the vehicle.<br>
Now, as the sliding members in the final reduction gear unit 20, for instance, a roller 24a and an inner race 24b of a side bearing 24, a differential case 25, a side gear 26, a pinion<br>
mate shaft 27 , a pinion mate gear 28 and a washer 3 0 that interposes between the differential case 25 and the side gear 26 to regulate a backlash can be cited. Sections between an end surface of a roller 24a and an inner race 24b of the side bearing 24, an inner surface and the side gear 26 of the differential case 25, an inner surface and a washer 30 of the differential case 25, a back surface and the washer 30 of the side gear 26, an outer periphery surface and the pinion mate gear 28 of the pinion mate shaft 27, and a back surface of the pinion mate gear 2 8 and an inner surface of the differential case 25 become sliding sections that slide each other in the presence of the low-friction agent composition for use in the final reduction gear unit. On one of the sliding surfaces of each of the sliding sections such as an end surface of the roller 24a in the side bearing 24, an inner surface of the differential case 25, an outer periphery surface of the pinion mate shaft 27 and a back surface of the pinion mate gear 28, and both surfaces of the washer 30, a hard carbon thin film can be coated. It goes without saying that a hard carbon thin film may be coated on a sliding surface of a counterpart of the sliding surface or on both of the sliding surfaces.<br>
A hard carbon thin film may be coated on other sliding surfaces than the above such as end surfaces of a roller 29a in the roller bearing 2 9 that supports the drive shaft 23 and one or both of outer periphery surfaces of the inner race 29b.<br>
Furthermore, the low-friction agent composition used in the manual transmission, when used on a sliding surface with a hard carbon thin film such as DLC, expresses very excellent low friction characteristics. However, in particular, in order to improve performance necessary as a working oil of the transmission, a metal base detergent, an oxidation inhibitor, a viscosity index improver, other ash-free modifier, other ash-less dispersant, an abrasion inhibitor or an extreme pressure agent, a rust preventive, a nonionic surfactant, an anti-emulsifying agent.<br>
a metal deactivator and a defoaming agent, when added singularly or in a combination of several kinds thereof, can improve necessary performance. EXAMPLES<br>

(Examples 1 through 13)<br>
As shown in Table 1, the respective sliding members were combined, further with the respective low-friction agent compositions (the sample oils 1 through 5 and 8 through 11) described together in Table 1, low-friction sliding mechanisms were prepared, followed by carrying out a pin-on-disc friction test described below. Results thereof are shown together in Table 1.<br>
[Pin-on-disc Friction Test] Pressure at maximum hertz: 80 MPa Disc rotation speed: 30 rpm Oil supply method: oil bath<br>
Temperature of supplied oil: 80°C Test time period: 60 min (Comparative Examples 1 through 4)<br>
Similarly to examples, the respective sliding members were combined, further with the respective low-friction agent compositions (the sample oils 1, 2, 6 and 7) described together in Table 1, low-friction sliding mechanisms were prepared, followed by carrying out a pin-on-disc friction test. Results thereof are shown together in Table 1.<br>
From Table 1, it is found that all combinations of the base materials and the sample oils obtained in Examples 1 through 13 show excellent low friction coefficients. For instance, these are, in comparison with Comparative Example 1 where a combination of a base material that is used in a general gasoline engine and sample oil 6 is used, could obtain the friction reduction effect of substantially 50 to 70%.<br>
Furthermore, from results of Examples 6 through 8, it is found that a hydroxyl group in the low-friction agent composition is excellent in the friction reduction effect.<br>
Still furthermore, from results of Examples 10 and 11, it is found that a compound having an alcoholic hydroxyl group is<br>
excellent in the friction reduction effect.<br>
Test pieces obtained in Examples 1 through 11 each did not have any problem in a surface shape after the test, were very excellent in the wear resistance as well, and showed stable low friction characteristics.<br>
A combination of a testpiecebasematerial anda low-friction agent composition according to Reference Example lisa combination where steel materials one of which is CrN-treated one and organic molybdenum that is said to be the most effective as the low- friction agent composition for sliding surfaces between steel materials are combined. As a result, the friction coefficient shows such a low value as substantially 0.06. This is inferred that similarly to a mechanism so far studied in various fields, a molybdenum disulfide film is formed on a sliding surface and thereby low friction is obtained. In the invention, the low friction is a target, and it is found that the low friction characteristics in the foregoing examples are very excellent.<br>
Furthermore, a combination of the test piece base material and the low-friction agent composition according to Comparative Example 1 is a combination of general bearing steel and engine oil. As a result, the friction coefficient exceeds 0.1 to be poor in the friction characteristics. This can be assumed that the mechanism showing a low friction behavior suggested in the invention did not sufficiently work.<br>
On the other hand. Comparative Example 2 is a combination where steel materials one of which is DLC-treated and sample oil blended with an organic molybdenum compound are combined. The friction coefficient was such high as substantially 0.1, that is, an advantage such as that of Example 2 was not obtained. This is inferred that the friction reduction mechanism is different from that of a sliding surface between existing steel materials.<br>
Furthermore, Comparative Examples 3 and 4 are a combination where steel material obtained by applying a CrN treatment on a<br>
base material and used in Comparative Example 2 and sample oil used in the examples, that is, sample oil that can obtain the low friction effect when applied to steel materials one of which is DLC-treated are combined. As a result, the friction coefficient showed such a large value as exceeding 0.1. It is assumed that since this is a different combination from that of a metal material and sample oil shown in the invention, the lower friction cannot be achieved.<br>
A combination of a test piece base material and a low-friction agent composition according to Reference Example 1 is a combination where steel materials one of which is CrN-treated and sample oil 7 where organic molybdenum that was most effective as the low-friction agent composition for sliding surfaces between existing steel materials was blended are combined. As a result, the friction coefficient shows such a low value as substantially 0.05. This is inferred that similarly to amechanism so far studied in various fields, a molybdenum disulfide film was formed on a sliding surface and thereby low friction was obtained. 2. Manual Transmission<br>

[3] Preparation of disc-like testpiece (sliding counterpart side)<br>
Similarly, with SUJ2 steel, a disc-like test piece 12 that is a counterpart side test piece was machined to the dimension, after an upper sliding surf ace was finished to the surface roughness Ra of 0.05 µm, by means of a PVD arc ion type ion plating process, on a surface thereof, a DLC thin film where an amount of hydrogen atoms is 0.5 atomic percent or less, the Knoop hardness Hk is 2170 kg/mm2, and the surface roughness Ry is 0. 03 µm was deposited at a film thickness of 0.5 µm. In the Reference Example, one that was not coated with the DLC thin film was used. [4] Preparation of low-frict ion agent composition for use in manual transmission<br>
As a low-friction agent composition for use in a manual transmission, ones where to mineral oil or synthetic oil (PAO: poly-a-olefin (1-octene oligomer) ) as base oil, SP (S and P-containing compound with 0.5% by mass of an amine salt of thiophosphoric acid) or ZnDTP (zinc dithiophosphate) extreme pressure agent (1.5% by mass as a compound), the wear resistance agent and an aliphatic ester or aliphatic amine friction modifier were respectively combined were prepared.
