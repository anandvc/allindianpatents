BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to wireless networks and computer<br>
communications across wireless networks. More particularly, the invention relates to<br>
the processing of an interactive screen by one or more servers for display on a wireless<br>
device when the wireless device attempts to access or download a software application<br>
or data from the one or more servers.		<br>
II.       Description of the Related Art<br>
[0002]	Wireless devices, such as cellular telephones, communicate packets including<br>
voice and data over a wireless network. Cellular telephones themselves are being manufactured with increased computing capabilities and are becoming tantamount to personal computers and hand-held personal digital assistants ("PDAs")- Some wireless devices, such as select cellular telephones, may have an installed application programming computer platform that allows software developers to create software application that operate on the wireless device.<br>
[0003]	On the Internet and other open networks, it is known to provide a user of a<br>
computer an interactive form when the user seeks to download or access software appllcations or data, such as an end-user license agreement (EULA), release, or verification form as to age, location or non-commercial status, prior to letting the user download the application. The user then must interact with the form, which sends a confirming signal back to the application download servo-, and then the user is given access to the application desired downloaded. However, the Internet and most LAN or WAN netwcnks are wire-based or otherwise have inexpensive data connectivity such that bandwidth is easily available to provide interactivity between the browsing computer and &amp;e application download server. Thus, the transmission of tiie end-user license agreement or other verification forms and return of the confirming data does not take up significant network resources. Conversely, in a wireless network environment such as cellular telecommunications, any network connection for data transfer is<br><br>
expensive and the use of a user-intraBctive fonn to traverse the networic prior to<br>
apphcation download has traditionally been prohibitive.<br>
[(KKW]	Consequently, it is desirable to provide an interactive mechanism to a wireless<br>
device by which the user of the wireless device must interact prior to accessing data over a network. Sudb a mechanism needs to account for the limited bandwidth and other characteristics associated with the wireless network.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]	In one embodiment of the present invention, a mefliod for processing interactive<br>
screens for a wireless device, comprises receiving a request sent across a wireless network to download data to the wireless device and transmitting an interactive screen and destined for the wireless device prior to transmitting data destined for the wireless device. The method may fiirther comprise receiving a signal indicating an interaction of the wireless device and the interactive screen and transmitting the downloaded data requKted by the wireless device. Also, receiving the request sent across a wireless network may be received by a first network server and trananitting the interactive screen may be performed by a second network server. This may also may iq)on receiving a signal indicating an interaction of the wireless device is received by the second network server, who^ein iqron the second network server sending a signal to the fii^ network server indicating the interaction and the first network server transmitting ftie downloaded data requested by the wireless device.<br>

interactive screen for a wireless device with a first network server and a second network server, coirqirises flie first network server Jn selective communication with a wireless network and in selective communication with the second network server and the second network server in selective communication with a wireless network and in selective communication with flie first network server, wherein the first network servCT receives a request for download data from the wireless device, communicates the request to the second network server and the second network server transmits an interactive screen to the wireless networic destined for the wireless device.<br>
[0007]	In yet anotiier embodiment of the present invention, a method for processing an<br>
interactive screen on the graphic display of a user-interactive wireless devices including<br><br>
a computer platform, the wireless device selectively communicating with a network<br>
server and downloading applications and data therefix)m, the method coinprises<br>
attempting to transmit data to the wireless device from the networic server across the<br>
wireless network, and transmitting a interactive screen to the computer platform of the<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Introduction<br>
0015]	Systems and mettiods are anticipated that provide for the downlo^ling of<br>
software qiplications to a wireless device. Software ^jplications can come pre-loaded at the time the wireless device is manufactured, or the user may later request ttiat additional programs be downloaded over cellular telecommunication carrier networks, where the programs are executable on the wireless device. As a result, users of wireless devices can customize their wireless devices with programs, such as games, printed media, stock updates, news, or any other type of information or program available for download from application download servers through the wireless network.<br>
;0016]	In one scenario, if fee user of the wireless device desires to download and use a<br>
software qipUcation using the wireless network, the user will typically either call a service provider or contact Ihe service provider through other means, such as throu^ an Internet access, and the service provider will either transmit the ^plication to the wireless device across fee wireless network or allow fee usa" access a network site whCTe the qvpUcation is downloadable or accessible. To connect to fee ^plication download server, fee wireless device bridges a commmiication connection to fee wireless netwoik, such as a cellular networic, and feen attempts to contact an application download servM where fee desired software application is resident Once fee wireless device contacts fee ^iplication download server, an initial connection is made and fee appUcation download server determines what ^jpUcation are available to fee wireless device and sends fee appropriate information, such as a menu, for display on fee wireless device so fee user can leam of fee available applications. Once access is provided to fee downloadable ^&gt;plications, fee user of fee wireless device can download any of fee available apphcations.<br>
[0017]	The present invention provides systems and mefeods for providing an interactive<br>
screen on the gr^hic di^lay of a wireless device when fee wireless device attempts to download or access data or applications on a network server, such as an jqjpUcation download server, across a wireless network. The interactive screen allows fee limited access of individual jqpplications and data on fee network server. The interactive screen can be transmitted to fee wireless device from first network server feat fee wireless device computer platform is attempting to navigate, or fee interactive screen can be<br><br>
transmitted to the wireless device from a second server on the wireless network. The intraactive screen can include graphics, text, multimedia components, data entry fields, or hyperlinks, all of which are displayable and interactive on the gr^hic display of the wireless device, and the system requires the end-user to property interact with ttte screen in order to download or access the requested applications or data,<br>
[O018]	Examples of the intexactive screen are EULAs which require the end-user to<br>
agree to certain terms before being allowed to download a software ^jplication, or a verification form tiiat requires flie end-user to iiqjiit data in ordra- to have the requested access to the ^jplications or data on the networic server. Once the user of the wireless device interacts witii file interactive screai displayed on the gr^hic display of the wireless device in the proper predefined manner, the wireless device sends a signal to the first or second network server indicating flie proper interaction, and the first network server will then allow the access or download of the requested ^plication or data to the computer platform of the wireless device. When a second network server has provided the interactive screen to the wireless device, (he second network server can also receive the interaction data fiom the wireless device and relay file interaction data to the first network servCT whereby the first network server then allows fiie download of the requested data to the computer platform of the wireless device.<br>
[0019]	It is therefore one object of the present inventive system and method to provide<br>
an interactive screen that can be displayed to the user of a wireless device seeking to download or acc^s a specific {^plication and data on a netwoilc server, such as an ^plication download server. The interactive screen the operator of the network server the abiUty to selectively control the access the user of the wireless device has to the network server resident ^plications, and force users to enter EULAs or input data before being allowed to access the :^)plications and data. With the use of a separate network server that can provide the interactive screen to the wireless device and store the interaction records, the system can conserve bandwidth and resources of the wireless network while controlling access to the apphcations and data of other network servers. The present invention thus provides an advantage in that it gives an operator of a network server the abihty to have vnreless device users execute agreements or verify facts prior to granting the user the ability to download or access apphcations and data<br><br>
resident on the application download or network server without significant use of the bandwidth and resources of the wireless network and network servere.<br>
Exemplary Embodiments of the Present Invention<br>
[0020]	With reference to the figures in which like numerals represent like elonents<br>
throu^out. Fig. 1 illustrates an embodiment of a system 10 for providing subsctibed software applications to one or more wireless devices, such as cellular telephone 12, in communication across a wireless network 14 with at least one network server, such as appUcation download server 16, that selectively downloads or provided access to software ^plications or other data to the wireless devices across a wireless communication portal or other data access to the wireless network 14. As shown here, the wireless device can be a cellular telephone 12, with a graphics display 13, a personal digital assistant 18 with PDA screen 19, a pager 20 with a graphics display 21, which is shown here as a two-way text pager, or even a separate computer platform 22 fliat has a wireless communication portal and a diqjlay 23, and may otherwise have a wired connection 24 to a network or the Internet The system 10 can thus be performed on any form of remote computer module including a wireless communicatiou portal, including without limitation, wireless modems, PCMCIA cards, access terminals, personal computers, access terrainals, telephones without a di^Iay or keypad, or any combination or sub-combination thereof<br>
[0021]	The application download server 16 is shown here on a local server-side network<br>
26 with other computer elements in commxmication with the wireless network 14, such as a database 28 with stored ^iplications and data that contains software ^iphcations and data that are accessible and downloadable to the wireless devices 12,18,20,22. There is also shown a second network server which is an interactive screen server 32 and with stored interaction database 30. In sudi embodiment, the interactive screen server 32 transmits the interactive screen to flie wireless device 12,18,20,22 as below described, and the stored interaction records database 30, which can be resident on the interactive screen server 32, stores the individual records for flie interactions wiQi the wireless devices that tiie interactive screen was provided to, the data input by the end-user, and any other intCTaction related data. Through the separate interactive screen server 32 and stored interaction records database 30, many other network servers, such<br><br>
as application download server 16, can have the system 10 provide the interactive screens to control access to network server resident f5)plicatioiis and data without significant use of the network server resources. However, interactive screen server 32 and stored interaction record database 30 are not necessary as server-side fimctioiK can be performed on one server, such as iqipUcation download server 16. Further, a computer server-side computer platform can provide separate services and processes to the wireless device 12,18,20,22 across the wireless networic 14.<br>
X)22]	Fig, 2 is a block diagram that more fiiUy illustrates the components of the<br>
wireless network 14 and interrelation of the elements of fiie system 10. The wireless network 14 is merely exemplary and can include any system whereby remote modules, such as wireless devices 12,18,20,22, communicate over-ttie-air between and among each other and/or between and among components of a wireless network 14, including, without limitation, wireless network carriers and/or servers, as well as including a non-wireless network alone or in wmibination with a wireless network. The application download SCTVCT 16 and the stored ^^phcations databa^ 28, mieiactive screai server 32, and stored interaction records database 30, will be present on the cellular data network with any other components that are needed to provide cellular telecommunication services. The apphcation download server 16, interactive screen servCT 32, and/or other screen servers communicate with a carrier networic 40, through a data hnk, such as the Internet, a secure LAN, WAN, or ottier network. The earner network 40 controls messages (generally being data packets) sent to a messaging service controller ("MSC") 42. The carrier network 40 communicates vnih the MSC 42 by a networic, the hitemet and/or POTS ("plain ordinary telephone system"). Typically, the network or Internet connection between fee carrio: networic 40 and the MSC 42 transfers data, and the POTS transfers voice information. The MSC 42 is connected to multiple base stations (*^TS") 44. In a similar manner to the carrier network, flie MSC 42 is typically connected to the BTS 44 by both the network and/or hitemet for data transfer and POTS for voice information. The BTS 44 ultimately broadcasts messages wirelessly to the wireless devices, such as cellular telephone 12, by short messaging service ("SMS"), or other over-the-air mettiods known in the art.<br>
[0023]	The wireless device, such as cellular telephone 12, has a computer platform 50<br>
that can receive and execute software applications azid display data transmitted &amp;om the<br><br>
^plication download server 16. The computer platform 50 also allows the wireless device to interact witti data and ^jpUcations resident on networic servers. The computer platform 50 may include, among other components, a display driver 52 that drives flie graphics display 13 and renders images on the gr^hics display 13 based upon gr^hics data received at the computer platform 50. The computer platform 50 also includes an ^)plication-specific integrated circuit ("ASIC") 54, or other processor, miraoprocessor, logic circuit, or other data processing device. The ASIC 52 or other processor executes the f^iplication programming interface ("APr*) layer 56 that interlaces with any resident programs in the memory 58 of the wireless device. The memory can be comprised of read-only or random-access memory (RAM and ROM), EPROM, EEPROM, flash cards, or any memory common to computer platforms. The computer platfonn 50 also includes a local database 60 that can hold the software applications not actively used in memory 58, such as the software ^iphcations downloaded from tite jqiphoation download server 16. The local database 60 is typically comprised of one or more flash memory cells, but can be any secondary or tertiary storage device as known in the art, such as magnetic media, EPROM, EEPROM, optical media, tape, or soft or hard disk.<br>
[0024]	The wireless device, such as cellular telephone 12, can access and download<br>
many types of applications, such as games and stock monitors, or simply data such as news and sports-related data. The downloaded data can be immediately di^lay^ oia the di^lay or stored in the local database 60 when not in use. The software appUcations can be treated as a regular software appHcation resident on the wireless device 12,18,20^22, and the user of the wireless device can selectively x:pload stored resident ^jplications from the local database 60 to memcay 58 for execution on tiie API 56. The end-tiser of the wireless device 12,18,20,22 can also selectively delete a software apphcation from the local database 60.<br>
[0025]	As shown in Figs. 3Aand 3B, the system 10 displays an interactive screen 15,17<br>
on the gr^hic display 13 of a wireless device, such as cellular telephone 12, upon fee wireless device atten^ting to access or download data from a network server, such as jqjphcation download server 16 across the wireless networic 14. The system 10 transmits an interactive screen to the computer platform 50 of the wireless device, eithCT from the server containing tiie request ^ipUcation or data or from a second server such as interactive screen server 32. The interactive screen 15,17 will appear to the user on<br><br>
the gr^hic display prior to the network server downloading or allowing access to the requested data or ^iplication. The operator of the network server can thus control the access of the wireless device 12,18,20^2 to individual s^lications and data throu^ using the interactive screen 15,17. As an example, in Fig. 3A, an end-user license agreement (EULA) interactive screen 15 is displayed to ttie end-user on the gr^hic display 13 when ttie user seeiks to download a software ^iplication from ^jplJcation download server 16. The user must indicate agreemrait with the EULA in ordCT to download the ^iplication, and can interact with the EULA 15 on the API 56 of flie computer platform. Typical APIs provide a movable cursor on the display that can activate icons as is well known in the art, and other gn^jhic-user interfaces can be used such as a touch screen and stylus that is common in PDA interfaces. Whatever the end-user inputs in response to the EULA is signaled back to the application download server 16, either directly from the cellular telephone 12 or indirectly from a signal sent by interactive screen server 32 indicating the user into^ction.<br>
[0026]	As another example of an interactive screen. Fig.  3B  illustrates  an age<br>
verification form 17 that requires the user to input their age prior to being granted access to age-restricted material on the network server. The user thus enters his/hra- age in response the screen and the cellular telephone transmits the input data to an appropriate netwoik server, such as application download server 16 or interactive screai server 32. Some processing can occur eiflier at the server where the data is requested or at the interactive screen server 32 to detennine if the input age meets the critraia. If the interactive screen server 32 processes the data, it can transmit an affirmative or negative signal to the requested-data server to authorize the access of the wireless device.<br>
[0027]	While the interactive screen 15,17 can be fransmitted to the wireless device<br>
12,18,20,22 from flie network server that the wireless device attempted to access or download data from, one embodiment includes the use of anoflier network server, such as interactive screen server 32 and an associated stored interaction records database 30, to conserve the resources on pure apphcation servers such as jqiplication download server 16. Thus, upon a wireless device 12,18,20,22 attempting to download or access data or an apphcation on a first network server across the wireless network 14, such as ^pUcation download server 16, the interactive screen is transmitted to the wireless device 12,18,20,22 from a second network server, such as interactive screen server 32,<br><br>
across tile wireless network 14. hi such eanbodiment, once flie user of the wireless<br>
device 12,18,20^2 interacts with the interactive screen displayed on the gr^hic display<br>
13,19,21^23 of the wireless device 12,18^0^2, tiie wireless device sends the signal<br>
indicating the interaction to the second networic server (intCTactive screrai server 32),<br>
and the second networic server saids a signal to the first networic server (application<br>
download server 16) indicating the interaction at ttie wirel^s device such tiiat the first<br>
networic server is now allowed to provide access or download the requested data or<br>
^jplication to the conq)uter platform 50 of the wireless device 12,18^0,22. If tiie<br>
interM;tive screen requires input of data, such as verification fonn 17 in Fig. 3B, once<br>
the end-user of the wireless device 12,18,20,22 wputs data on fee interactive screen, the<br>
wireless device 12,18^20,22 sends the ii^ut data to the second network server<br>
(interactive screen server 32), the second networic server again sends a signal to the first<br>
network serva- (aj^lication download srarer 32) indicting the input of data at the<br>
wireless device 12,18,20,22, and that the first networic srarer can provide access or<br>
downloading the requested data or application. The use of the interactive screen server<br>
32 as a second network servCT allow faster provision of the interactive screen and<br>
storage of interaction records, especially with a stored interaction records database 30,<br>
than would be possible with all functionality occurring on a single network server, such<br>
as application download SCTVCT 16. The increase in system 10 speed translates to<br>
decreased data transfa- time across die wireless networic 14, vhich conserves the<br>
expensive bandwidth of the wireless networic 14.<br>
[0028]	The interactive screen can be provided to the wireless device 12,18,20,22 at any<br>
interval during the wirelras device-network servM- interaction. The system 10 can transmit the intCTactive screen to the wireless device to block access to a specific appUcation, a dataset, or even a file level on the networic server (data may be held on a network server in a file structure such as in Windows, UNIX, and LINUX). Furthra-, the transmission of the interactive screen can occur at any time an ^jphcation or data is sought accessed or downloaded by a wireless device, or if a one-time EULA was necessary, a record of die wireless device 12,18,20,22 execution of the EULA can be stored, for exanq)le on stored interaction records database 30. A comparison can be made by a networic server, such as flie inta:active screen server 32, when a wireless device seeks to download an application or data and if the wireless device has a EULA<br><br>
stored, then flie interaction screen provision is unnecessary and the system 10 can let the download proceed.<br>
0029]	In one exemplary ranbodiment, the process executed on the computer platform<br>
50 offbs wireless device 12,18,20,22 is shown in the flowchart of Fig. 4. The wireless device, such as cellular telephone 12, bridges a connection to the wireless network 14, as shown at step 72, such as a cellular network, and then connects to a network server, such as application download server 16, as shown at step 72. At some point while connected to the ^iplication download server 16, the wireless device will request to download an application, as shown at step 74, or will seek to otherwise access data tiiat has limited access. Thus, after the request is made at step 74, a decision is made as to whether an interactive screen 15,17 has been received at the computer platform 50 of the wireless device, as shown by decision 50. If an interactive screen 15,17 has not been received, then the process proceeds to determine if &amp;e requested appUcation has been received at decision 84. Otherwise, if the interactive screen 15,17 has been received at decision 76, the interactive SCTeem 15,17 is displayed on the gr^hic display 13,19,21,23 of the wireless device 12,18,20,22 as shown at step 78.<br>
[0030]	After the interactive screen 15,17 is displayed, a decision is made as to whettier<br>
the user has interacted with the interactive screen 15,17, as shown at decision 80, or in other words, the wireless device waits until the USCT intwacts with ttie interactive screen 15,17 so it can send a signal and/or data back to the interactive screen transmitting network server, such as qjplication download server 16 or interactive screen server 32. If the user has not interacted with the interactive screen 15,17 at decision 80, the process reenters decision 80 in a wait-state until the user does interact with the interactive screen 15,17 or exits the download request If the user has interacted with the interactive screen 15,17 at decision 80, theo the interaction data or a signal is transmitted from the wireless device 12,18,20,22 to the appropriate network servra:, as shown at step 82.<br>
[0031]	A decision is then made as to whether the request application has been received<br>
at the computer platform 50 of the wireless device 12,18,20,22 (or that the requested access has been granted), as shown at decision 84. If die appUcation has not been received (or access has not been granted) at decision 84, ttien the process is terminated as the download (or access) was unsuccessful. If the application was successfiiUy received at decision 84, the application is installed at the wireless device 12,18,20,22 as<br><br>
shown at step 86. If the request was for access to data or applications on the network server, tiien ttie wireless device 12,18^0^2 will have access to the data or applications.<br>
[0032]	With reference to Fig. 5, an exemplary embodimesnt of the process executing on<br>
the qjpHcatitm download server 16 (or other type of netwrak server) is diown in a flowchart A connection with the wireless device 12,18^0,22 is altered, as shown at step 90. At some point, the ^iplication download server 16 will received a request frran the wirelras device 12,18,20^2 to download an ^plication or access resident data, as shown at step 92. Once the request is recdved at the ^jplication download server 16, it is determined if interaction with the wireless device user is required, as shown at decision 94. The determination can be made based tqxm any raiteria that the opraator of the network server chooses, such as the owner or the wireless device, tiie nature of the subject matter of the apphcation or data requested accessed or downloaded. If an interaction with the wireless device user is not required at decision 94, flien the requested qiplication is downloaded to the wireless device 12,18,20^, as shown at step 102. If interaction is required at decision 94, then an interactive sa^en 15,17 is transmitted to the wireless device 12,18,20,22, necessitating that the user interact with the interactive screen 15,17 before the requested download (or access) is pramitted.<br>
[0033]	A determination is then made as to whether Hhe wireless device user has properly<br>
intffacted with the intCTactive screen 15,17, such as afBrmatively entering a EULA (Fig. 3A) or entering a correct age (Fig. 3B), as shown at decision 98. The interaction signal or data can be sent either directly from the wireless device 12,18,20,22 requesting the application and displaying the interactive screen 15,17, or can be a signal or data sent from a second network seaver, such as interactive screen server 32 which originally received the interaction signal or data from the wireless device. If the wireless device iKer has not properly interacted with the interactive screen 15,17 at the wireless device 12,18,20,22, at decision 98, a notice of refiisal to download the application to the wireless device 12,18,20,22 (or denial of access) is returned to the requesting wireless device, as shown at step 100. If the wireless device user has properly interacted with the interactive screen 15,17 at the wireless device 12,18,20,22, at decision 98, then the requested application is downloaded to the wireless device (or access to the requested application granted), as shown at step 102.<br><br>
0034]	The system 10 thus provides a method for displaying an interactive screen 15,17<br>
on the graphic display 13,19,21,23 of a user-interactive wireless device 12,18,20,22 including attempting to download or access data on a network server, such application download server 16, across the wireless network 14, transmitting a interactive screen 15,17 to the computer platform 50 of the wireless device 12,18,20,22 across the wireless network 14 prior to downloading or accessing the requested data or aplication, and displaying the interactive screen 15,17 on the graphic display 13,19,21,23 of the wireless device 12,18,20,22. The method can also include interacting with the interactive screen 15,17 at the wireless device 12,18,20,22, sending a signal to the network server application download server 16 or interactive screen server 32) from the wireless device 12,18,20,22 indicating the interaction, and downloading or accessing the requested data or application at the network server with the computer platform 50 of the wireless device 12,18,20,22. If the interactive screen 15,17 allows wireless device user input of data, the method further comprises the steps of inputting data on the interactive screen 15,17 displayed on the graphic display 13,19,21,23 of Hie wireless device 12,183,22, sending the inputted data from the wireless device 12,18,20;22 to the network server, processing the input data at the network server, and selectively downloading or granting access to the requested data or apphcation at the network server.<br>
