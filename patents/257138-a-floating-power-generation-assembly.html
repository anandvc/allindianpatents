				<td>POWER GENERATION ASSEMBLIES<br>
This invention relates to power generation assemblies, and apparatus for use therewith. More specifically, this invention relates to (a) a floating power generation assembly; (b) a process for placing a floating unit on water, this process being especially, although not exclusively, intended for use in deploying certain components of the floating power generation assembly of the invention; and (c) a multiple wind turbine assembly.<br>
As concern over the environmental consequences of conventional power plants, including their carbon dioxide emissions, has increased in recent years, greater attention has been focused upon so-called "green" or environmentally advantageous power plants which use renewable sources of energy and do not cause substantial emissions of carbon dioxide or other pollutants. Potential green power plants include photovoltaic plants, which generate energy from sunlight, and plants which derive energy from tides, ocean currents and wave action.<br>
One type of green power plant which has already been shown to be commercially viable is the wind turbine or windmill. So-called "wind farms" having multiple wind turbines have been constructed in several parts of the world and have made significant contributions to electricity production. In 2002, total wind farm capacity in the European Union was about 23,000 MW, and in the United States about 5,000 MW.<br>
Unfortunately, although wind farms are environmentally advantageous in the sense of not emitting pollutants, they do pose esthetic problems. To be economically viable, wind farms need to be situated where high average wind velocities are expected. On land, such sites are often on mountain ridges or on flat plains, and in either location conventional wind farms, using individual rotors 30 meters or more in diameter mounted on masts about 30 meters high, are conspicuous for miles. Furthermore, such mountain ridges or plains are often in areas celebrated for their natural beauty and many people find the presence of conspicuous man-made objects in such areas offensive.<br>
Accordingly, interest has recently shifted to off-shore wind farms. The first such off-shore wind farms have been established in shallow water<br><br>
(typically 15 meters or less deep) close to shore, and the equipment used has been essentially the same as in land-based wind farms, with the masts supporting the rotors mounted on the seabed and lengthened as necessary to keep the rotors at the desired height above the water. However, such shallow water wind farms have attracted the same types of controversy as land-based wind farms. For example, a recent proposal to place a large wind farm of more than 100 units in Nantucket Sound off the coast of Massachusetts has led to objections that the wind farm will be visible from popular beaches and from people engaged in recreational boating, and that the masts and rotors may cause vibrations which will affect commercial fishing and lobster trapping. It has also been alleged that the rotors may kill or injure substantial numbers of birds.<br>
Public controversy relating to wind farms would be reduced by moving off-shore wind farms a greater distance off-shore, although the maximum distance off-shore where wind farms can be located is limited by the expense of the undersea high voltage cables required to bring the electricity generated on-shore; such cables can incur very significant costs. Moreover, the choice of suitable offshore locations for wind farms, even relatively close to shore, is limited by water depth. If wind farms are required to operate in deeper waters, say 100-200 meters, as the water depth increases, it becomes increasingly impracticable, from both engineering and economic view points, to continue with seabed mounted masts bearing single large rotors. Clearly at some point, it becomes necessaiy to base the wind farm upon one or more floating or tension leg platforms. However, to justify the high costs of deeper water wind farms, such farms will typically be required to have high power outputs, and the conventional type of single mast/single rotor wind turbine with very large rotors may not be well adapted for mounting upon a floating or tension leg platform. In one aspect, this invention seeks to provide a novel type of wind turbine assembly. The wind turbine assembly of the present invention may be useful in off-shore wind farms or other contexts, for example some land-based wind farms.<br>
The present invention also relates to improvements in off-shore power generation assemblies, especially wind farms, to enable such assemblies to be sited in deep water without mounting a rigid structure on the sea bed or other<br><br>
underwater solid surface. Finally, this invention relates to a process for placing floating units on water, this process being especially intended for use in the deployment of the off-shore power generation assemblies of the present invention.<br>
In one aspect, this invention provides a floating power generation assembly having as components at least three floating units floating on a body of water, and at least three anchors secured to a solid surface beneath the body of water, each of the floating units being provided with power generation means, each of the anchors being connected by cables to at least two of the floating units, and each of the floating units being connected by cables to at least two other components, the floating units being arranged substantially at the vertices of at least one equilateral triangle.<br>
This aspect of the present invention may hereinafter be referred to as the "anchored floating assembly" of the invention. In such an anchored floating assembly, each power generation means may comprises at least one of a wind turbine and a means for extracting power.from waves or marine currents. The three anchors may be arranged substantially at the vertices of an equilateral triangle with the floating units arranged within, or along the sides of, this equilateral triangle. In one form of the anchored floating assembly, intended for use where rough weather and/or strong currents may cause problems! each of the floating units is connected by cables to at least three other components of the assembly. The anchored floating assembly may comprise at least six floating units arranged substantially at the vertices of a regular hexagon, typically with a seventh floating unit disposed at the center of the hexagon.<br>
In a preferred form of the anchored floating assembly, at least one of the floating units comprises:<br>
a mast extending from above to below the water surface;<br>
a wind turbine comprising a plurality of blades and rotatably mounted at or adjacent the upper end of the mast such that the blades do not contact the water as they rotate;<br>
a buoyancy section provided on the mast adjacent the water surface and arranged to provide buoyancy to the assembly; and<br><br>
a base section provided on the mast below the water surface and having the cables attached thereto, the base section being weighted such that the center of gravity of the floating unit is substantially below the water surface.<br>
Desirably, in such an anchored floating assembly, the center of gravity of the floating unit is at least about 30 meters below the water surface, and the floating unit desirably has a metacentric height (the distance between its centers of gravity and buoyancy) of at least about 10 meters. Also, the anchored floating assembly may further comprise at least two auxiliary cables extending from the buoyancy section to the cables connecting the base section to other components of the assembly, or to other components of the assembly. The base section of the mast may be provided with a peripheral hoop arranged to increase the hydrodynamic mass of the floating unit and to lengthen the natural heave period thereof. The mast may have a portion of reduced cross-section at the water surface, and the portion of the mast lying below the water surface may be provided with at least one ballast tank.<br>
In another aspect, this invention provides a process for placing a floating unit in water, the floating unit comprising a mast which, when floating, extends from above to below the water surface, the process comprising:<br>
providing a vessel having a deck and a pivotable unit rotatably mounted on the deck for rotation about a horizontal axis adjacent an edge of the deck, the pivotable unit comprising a base member and two clamping members mounted on the base member and spaced apart from the each other;<br>
clamping the mast with the clamping members, thereby holding the mast in a substantially horizontal position above the deck;<br>
transporting the vessel and mast to a location where the floating unit is to be deployed;<br>
pivoting the pivotable unit and mast until the mast is in a substantially vertical position; and<br>
releasing the mast from the clamping members, thereby allowing the floating unit to float.<br>
In this "deployment process" of the present invention, the mast may comprise at least one ballast tank and the process may further comprise at least<br><br>
partially filling the ballast tank with water after pivoting the mast to a substantially vertical position but before releasing the mast from the clamping members. The deployment process may further comprise placing an external floatation device on the mast while the mast is in its substantially horizontal position above the deck, and releasing the external floatation device from the mast after the floating unit is floating. Also, at least one of the clamping members may be movable relative to the base member, thereby allowing the spacing between the clamping members to be varied. Finally, the vessel may be provided with means for varying the position of the axis of rotation of the pivotable unit relative to the deck.<br>
Finally, this invention provides a wind turbine assembly comprising a plurality of cells, each cell having substantially the form of a hexagonal prism with a horizontal axis, each cell having a turbine mounted for rotation about an axis substantially coincident with the axis of the cell, the cells being disposed adjacent each other with their axes substantially parallel, each cell having a wall defining a passage through the cell, the turbine of the cell being located with this passage, the cross-section of the passage varying from a substantially hexagonal inlet to a substantially circular portion of minimum cross-sectional area adjacent the turbine, such mat wind entering the inlet is accelerated before passing the turbine.<br>
In such a "cellular wind turbine assembly", the diameter of the substantially circular portion of minimum cross-sectional area adjacent the turbine is desirably not greater than about 95 per cent, preferably not greater than 80 per cent, of the diameter of the circumcircle of the substantially hexagonal inlet. The cellular wind turbine assembly may further comprise a base member on which the cells are rotatably mounted and control means for maintaining the cells pointed into the wind being experienced. The cellular wind turbine assembly may also comprise an outer casing enclosing all the cells.<br>

As already indicated, the present invention has three main aspects, namely a floating power generation assembly, a deployment process, and a cellular wind turbine assembly. These three aspects of the invention will mainly be described separately below, but it will be appreciated that a single assembly or process may make use of multiple aspects of the invention. For example, a floating power generation assembly may include cellular wind turbine assemblies of the invention, and the floating units of the floating power generation assembly may, and indeed are primarily intended to be, placed on site by the deployment process of the invention.<br><br>
One form of the wind turbine assembly of the present invention, which might be used in a land-based wind farm, will now be described in detail with reference to Figures 1 to 3 of the accompanying drawings, in which Figure 1 is a schematic front elevation of the preferred wind turbine assembly (generally designated 100), Figure 2 is a schematic side elevation of the assembly 100 and Figure 3 is a schematic section taken in a horizontal plane through two adjacent units of the assembly 100 and showing the air flow through these units.<br>
As shown in Figures 1 and 2, the wind turbine assembly 100 comprises a plurality of individual unit or cells 102, each of which contains a single turbine 104 mounted for rotation about a horizontal axis. The cells 102 have the form of hexagonal prisms with horizontal axes. The wind turbine assembly 100 further comprises support pillars 106 mounted upon a yaw control (rotatable) base 108, which is in turn supported upon a fixed base 110 supported by support members 112, which can be of any convenient type and are indicated in only the most schematic manner in Figures 1 and 2. The yaw control base 108 permits the wind turbine assembly 100 to rotate so as the face the wind being experienced.<br>
The size of the cells 102 and the turbines 104 can vary widely; the turbines 104 may be of substantially the same size as those used in conventional single mast/single rotor units (with a rotor say 30 to 47 meters in diameter) or they may be substantially smaller. For example, the diameter d of each turbine 104 might be about 8 meters, while the height D of each cell 102 (i.e., the diameter of the circumcircle of the hexagonal front elevation of the cell 102) might be about 10 meters.<br>
Each cell 102 comprises an airfoil member best seen in Figure 3. The airfoil member could be made, for example, from carbon-fiber reinforced polymer, in the case of smaller cells, or aluminum or stainless steel in the case of larger cells. The airfoil member has an intake section 114, a cylindrical section 116 within which the turbine 104 of the cell 102 is located, and an outlet section 118. The intake section 114 may have a complex, substantially fmstopyramidal/frustoconical form which transitions from a hexagonal intake (as seen in Figure 1) to a circular cross-section adjacent the cylindrical section 116. (The diameter of the cylindrical section 116 is of course essentially the same as that of the turbine 104, since to maximize<br><br>
power output from the turbine, there should be minimal clearance between the tips of the turbine blades and the inner surface of    the cylindrical section 116.) Alternatively, the intake section may have a form which is essentially of circular cross-section throughout, making a smooth transition from the circular cross-section adjacent the cylindrical section 116 to the circumcircle of the hexagonal intake, but with the circular cross-sections truncated by the sides of a hexagonal prism extending perpendicular to the edges of the hexagonal intake. Such a "truncated conical" intake section will have forward edges which are concave as viewed from the same position as Figure 1. In another alternative construction, the airfoil member could have an internal form which provides one continuous curve extending throughout the full length of the airfoil member, so that there would not be discrete intake, cylindrical and outlet sections. The intake section 114 serves an as air intalce for the turbine 104, collecting moving air provided by wind impinging upon the . assembly 100 and accelerating the velocity of this moving air before it reaches the turbine 104, thus providing the turbine 104 with an effective wind speed higher than that of the prevailing wind and increasing the output from the turbine 104 above the output which would be achieved simply by exposing the turbine 104 to the prevailing wind. The taper of the intake section 114 and the resultant acceleration of the moving air entering this intake section enable the turbines 104 to make use of all the wind impinging upon the front face of the assembly 100 even though the combined area of the circles traversed by the blades of the turbines 104 is only about one-half of the area of the front face of the assembly 100. (The ratio between the area of the circles traversed by the blades and the area of the front face of the assembly 100 can vary considerably; see the discussion of the ratio d/D below.) The exact form of the inner surface of each intake section 114 resembles the upper surface of an airplane wing, and is aerodynamically designed to maximize the wind velocity experienced by the associated turbine 104 and minimize drag on the air passing through the cell 102.<br>
The wind speed experienced by each turbine 104 depends upon the ratio d/D, where d and D are as already defined. The ratio d/D can be varied depending upon economic considerations and site conditions, including the maximum wind velocities which the assembly 100 may need to withstand.<br><br>
Increasing d/D reduces drag within the intake section 114 and thus enables the use of a lighter support structure (as described below), while lowering d/D increases the wind speed experienced by the turbine 104 and thus enables the same power output to be obtained from smaller, lighter turbines running more efficiently. Thus, in at least some cases, it may be desirable to vary the d/D ratio within a single assembly, the cells 102 near the base of the assembly having a low d/D ratio and the cells 102 near the top of the assembly having a higher d/D ratio. Typically d/D will not be greater than about 0.95. Preferably, d/D will not be greater than about 0.8.<br>
The acceleration of wind velocity provided by the intake section 114 is important in increasing the power provided by the turbines 114. For example, consider a hexagonal cell of the type shown in Figure 1 with a d/D ratio of 0.65. The area of the hexagonal intake will be 0.6495D2, while the area of the circular section in which the turbine rotates will be 0.7854d2, which is equal to 0.33 D2. The ratio of these two areas is 1.96, and thus (ignoring frictional and viscous losses) this will be the maximum factor by which the wind velocity can be accelerated. A reasonable estimate of losses would suggest an acceleration factor of about 1.72, and since the power available from a turbine is proportional to the cube of the wind velocity an acceleration factor of 1.72 would achieve a five-fold increase in power output. For example, there is a commercially available turbine with a 47 meter diameter rotor rated at 660 1<w. placing a slightly modified version of this commercially available turbine in airfoil accordance with the present invention and an acceleration factor would boost output single to mw so that an. assembly only ten such turbines could produce as illustrated figure discussed below.></w.>
The provision of the outlet section 118 of the airfoil member is optional, and in some cases it may be convenient to omit this section and simply allow air passing through the turbines 104 to pass unhindered out of the rear (downwind) surface of the assembly 100. thus avoiding the cost of the providing the outlet sections 118 and the increased weight of the assembly caused by these outlet sections. However, omitting the outlet sections 118 means that air leaving the turbines 104 does so over only a small fraction of the area of the rear surface of the assembly 100, which may lead to significant turbulence adjacent this rear surface,<br><br>
and varying stresses upon adjacent pails of the assembly 100. Hence, it is generally desirable each cell with an outlet section 118, in a form generally similar to the inlet section 114, namely a substantially frustoconical form linking the circular outlet end of the cylindrical section 116 to a hexagonal outlet on the rear surface of the assembly 100, and with an inner surface aerodynamically designed to minimize drag.<br>
As indicated in a highly schematic manner in Figure 2, an. outer casing or shell 120 may be provided to cover the outer surfaces of the assembly 100 and to prevent turbulence caused by wind passing over the external surfaces of the airfoils of the cells 102 with lie adjacent these external surfaces. Although the provision of the shell 120 is optional, and the shell may be omitted to reduce the overall cost and weight of the assembly 100, provision of the shell 120 is generally desirable to avoid turbulence around the edges of the assembly 120, and consequent stresses and drag upon parts of the assembly, especially when it is installed in a location which may be subjected to high winds.<br>
Figures 4 and 5 illustrate the support structure of the assembly 100, Figure 4 being a schematic front elevation similar to Figure 1 but with the airfoils removed to show the support structure, and Figure 5 being an enlarged view of part of one cell of the support structure and its associated turbine, with the airfoil of the cell being indicated by open circles. As shown in Figure 4, each cell 102 of the assembly is supported by a hexagonal framework 122 from the lower end of which extends a short mast 124 on which the turbine 104 of the cell 102 is mounted. As shown in more detail in Figure 5, the hexagonal framework 122 actually comprises two parallel frameworks 122A and 122B on the front and rear sides respectively of the turbine 104, these frameworks 122A and 122B being formed from rods 126 inserted into linking pieces 128, so that the frameworks 122A and 122B can be rapidly assembled on site from a small number of standard components. The frameworks 122A and 122B are interconnected at their lower ends by a cross-piece 130 on which the mast 124 is mounted. (Some parts of the framework shown in Figure 4 may be omitted in some cases; for example, depending upon the strength of the material used to form the airfoils, it may be possible to omit the two vertical members in the uppermost cell in Figure 4. Also, as indicated by broken lines in<br><br>
Figure 4 optionally additional support members 124Amay be provided extending at 120° angles to the mast 124, these additional support members may be used to provide support to the airfoil and/or to the turbines 104. The additional support members 124A are omitted from Figure 5 for clarity.)<br>
The yaw control base 108 (Figures 1 and 2) can be controlled in-various ways, the choice being governed at least in part by the size of the assembly 100. Especially in smaller assemblies, the yaw control base may be controlled by a weather vane, as illustrated in Figures 6A and 6B, which are, respectively, side elevation and top plan views of one cell 102 provided with such a vane 132. The vane 132 is provided on the rear surface of the cell 102 and will typically be provided on only some of the cells 102, preferably those in the center of the assembly 100. The vane 132 acts in the same manner as a conventional weathervane and keeps the assembly 100 facing into the prevailing wind. In view of the size and weight of the assembly 100 it may be desirable to provide some form of damping means (for example, frictional or hydraulic dampers) between the yaw control base 108 and the fixed base 110 (Figures 1 and 2) to prevent abrupt movements of the yaw control base 108, and especially abrupt reversals of its direction of movement.<br>
Any known systems for keeping the assembly 100 facing into the wind may be employed. For example, especially with large assemblies it may be desirable to provide a sensor for measuring wind speed and direction, and a motorized drive for controlling movement of the yaw control base 108 relative to the fixed base 110; such a motorized drive could, for example, have the form of an electric motor on the yaw control base 108 provided with a pinion engaged with a circular rack provided on the fixed base 110. Again, it may be desirable to damp the movement of the yaw control base 108 relative to the fixed base 110, but in this case damping can be effected in software used to control the motorized drive. Such a system has the advantage that measurements of wind speed could be used to raise an alarm or initiate safety measures if wind speeds reach a point at which damage to the assembly appears likely.<br>
From the foregoing description, it will be seen that the wind turbine assembly of the present invention differs radically from the typical prior art assembly using discrete single mast/single rotor units, in that the wind turbine<br><br>
assembly of the present invention uses a plurality of (typically) small sized wind turbine cells stacked to form the full assembly. Each unit can be identical (or a small number of units differing in, for example, d/D ratio, can be employed) and scalable, and thus easily replaceable for maintenance or upgrading. The relatively small size and weight of the individual cells is also advantageous during construction, repair and maintenance in that it limits the weight which has to be lifted or manipulated at any one time; this may reduce costs by removing the need for very heavy lifting equipment and may also have safety advantages, especially when units need to be lifted at off-shore sites exposed to severe weather conditions.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in wind turbine technology that the assembly of the invention previously described can be modified in a number of different ways. For example, the assembly 100 has been shown with hexagonal intakes to the airfoils. This enables the intakes to be stacked with no gaps therebetween, as illustrated in Figure 1, but does require a rather complex geometric form for the intake sections as they transition from hexagonal intakes to circular outlets, and the manufacture of airfoils having these complex geometric forms may increase manufacturing costs. Alternatively, the airfoil intakes may be made circular (so that the airfoils can maintain circular symmetry throughout their length, which eases manufacturing problems) and the tri-lobed gaps between the intakes of adjacent airfoils covered with "crevice caps" having substantially the form of squat triangular pyramids, but with the edges of the base of the pyramid curved to conform to the curved edges of the circular airfoil intakes. The use of such crevice caps ensures that all air incident upon the front face of the assembly enters into the airfoil intakes (this maximizing power output from the turbines) and that no moving air enters between the airfoil, where it might cause undesirable turbulence.<br>
' The assembly shown in Figure 1 is small, comprising only eight cells 102 and in practice substantial more cells would typically be employed in a commercial assembly. Figures 7 and 8A illustrate two types of assembly having larger numbers of cells. The assembly of Figure 7 is in effect produced by extending the assembly of Figure 1 horizontally without increasing its height, and might thus be useful in an off-shore location relatively close to shore where it is desired to limit the overall height of the assembly to prevent it being seen from shore. In contrast,<br><br>
the assembly of Figure 8 A is in effect produced by extending the assembly of Figure 1 vertically without increasing its width, and might thus be useful where economic considerations dictate provide a large assembly on a relatively small base. The assembly of Figure 8A is also well adapted to take advantage of the stronger wind which is often found at substantial distances above the ground or ocean' surface.<br>
Figure 8B illustrates an assembly generally similar to that of Figure 1 but using large commercially available turbines. Figure 8B illustrates with dimensions an assembly using ten of the aforementioned 47 meter turbines used with airfoils having a wind velocity acceleration factor of 1.72, so that each turbine generates 3.3 MW and the entire assembly generates 33 MW. Although large, the assembly shown in Figure 8B is entirely practicable for a land-based wind farm, and in many cases the single large structure may be less objectionable than the 50 scattered single mast/single rotor units which would otherwise be required to generate the same power output. It should be noted that in large turbine assemblies such as that shown in Figure 8B it is normally not necessary to increase the length of the airfoil is proportion to the diameter of the turbine, i.e., typically the airfoils in Figure 8B will be shorter relative to the turbine diameter as compared with those in Figure 1.<br>
As already mentioned, the present invention also provides floating power generation assemblies (typically off-shore wind farms, although the floating power generation assemblies of the invention may make use of other types of power generation means, for example means to derive power from wave motion or water currents), which can be sited in deep water without mounting a rigid structure on the sea bed, or other solid underwater surface. These floating power generation assemblies are described below primarily using conventional wind turbine units of the single mast/single rotor type, but it will readily be apparent to those skilled in wind farm technology that the single mast/single rotor type units could be replaced by cellular wind turbine assemblies of the present invention, as described above.<br>
Figure 9 of the accompanying drawings is a schematic side elevation of a single wind turbine unit (generally designated 900) which can serve one floating unit of a floating power generation assembly (hereinafter for convenience called "a wind farm") of the present invention. The unit 900 comprises a rotor 902 comprising<br><br>
a plurality of blades (typically three) and mounted on a hub 904 for rotation about a horizontal axis sufficiently far above the water that the rotor blades do not contact the water as they rotate; indeed, to ensure that the rotor blades receive the full velocity of the wind unhindered by surface drag, it is desirably that the rotor blades have, at their lowest point, at least 15 meters clearance above water level. The hub 904 houses a generator (not shown) and is supported on a tower or mast 906. Units comprising a rotor and a hub containing a generator are available commercially, and the commercial units can readily be employed in wind farms of the present invention. The commercial units are already provided with means (not shown) to keep the rotor facing the prevailing wind, and with a rotation joint (also not shown) located a short distance below the hub to enable the hub and rotor to turn on a fixed mast, thus minimizing the weight which has to rotate as the rotor turns to face the prevailing wind.<br>
Thus far, the construction of the unit 900 is conventional. However, instead of being secured to a rigid support, either land or sea bed, the unit 900 is designed for anchoring in deep water. As shown in Figure 9, the mast 906 passes through the ocean surface 908, being surrounded by a buoyancy section or belt 910 which lies at the ocean surface 908 and provides sufficient buoyancy to hold the upper end of the mast 906 at its intended distance above the ocean surface. The lower end of the mast 906 is fixed to a turbine base section 912, which is made heavy enough and located far enough below the ocean surface 908 to ensure that the center of gravity of the entire unit 900 lies a substantial distance below the ocean surface 908. The base 912 is connected to three cables 914, which are connected to other units 900 or to anchors, as described in detail below.<br>
The buoyancy belt 910 serves to ensure that the center of buoyancy of the unit 900 is sufficiently above the center of gravity of the unit to provide stability against wave action. The buoyancy belt 910 also serves to protect the mast 906 against impacts from floating objects.<br>
Figure 10A is a top plan view of a floating power generation assembly or wind farm comprising ten components, namely seven units 900 and three anchors 916 (one of which is omitted from Figure lOAto increase the scale of the drawing). As shown in Figure 10A, the units 900 are arranged at the vertices of a<br><br>
series of equilateral triangles. More specifically, six of the units 900 are arranged at the vertices of a regular hexagon, the sides of which are made long enough (typically at least five times the diameter of the rotor 902 in Figure 9) that there is substantial separation between the circles 900A which define the maximum area which may be traversed by each rotor 902. The seventh unit 900 is disposed at the center of the regular hexagon. The cables 914 run along all six sides of the hexagon, and also connect the central unit 900 to alternate ones of the units at the vertices of the hexagon.  The three anchors 916  are  arranged on the  sea bed beneath the perpendicular bisectors of alternate sides of the hexagon, and are connected by cables 914 to the units 900 at either end of the adjacent side of the hexagon. Thus, the three anchors 916 are arranged at the vertices of an equilateral triangle, within which are located the units 900, and each of the units 900 forming the hexagon is connected to its two neighboring units 900 and to one of the anchors 916, with alternate units 900 of the hexagon also being connected to the central units 900. Thus, each of the units 900 is connected by the cables 914 to at least three components of the assembly. The anchors 914 serve to hold the seven units 900 stationary against wind and ocean currents. Also, although not shown in Figures 9 and 10A, the cables 914 can carry electrical cables through which electricity generated in the hubs 904 can pass into underwater cables (not shown) provided on one or more of the anchors 916. However, it is generally preferred that electrical cables separate from the cables 914 be provided to cany electricity away from the wind farm.<br>
Numerous other arrangements of the units 900 and the anchors 916 may of course be used, and four examples are illustrated in Figures lOB-lOE.The wind farm shown in Figure 10B is formed by omitting the cables from alternate sides of the hexagon in Figure 10A, so that three of the units 900 are connected only to one other unit 900 and to an anchor 916. This type of "open" assembly may be useful in sheltered locations where strong currents and waves are not deemed likely; a mixture of open and closed assemblies may of course be used. Figure IOC shows a larger assembly, of the same "open" type as that of Figure 10B but having a fourth anchor disposed at the center of the equilateral triangle formed by the other three anchors; such central anchors are desirable in larger assemblies to prevent excessive<br><br>
drift of some floating units not directly connected to anchors. The 12-floating unit, 5-anchor assembly of Figure 10D is notionally produced by joining two of the assemblies of Figure 1 OB along one open (uncabled) edge and replacing the two anchors connected to the floating units along that edge with a single central anchor disposed midway along that edge. Finally, the assembly of Figure 10E may also be regarded as notionally produced by joining two of the assemblies of Figure 10B along one open edge, but using a different anchor arrangement.<br>
As will be apparent to those skilled in wind turbine technology, numerous variations can be made in the unit 900 shown in Figure 9. For example the unit may incorporate a variety of different types of wind turbine. The rotor 902 could be a conventional three-bladed propeller; such three-bladed propellers are commercially proven, but may give rise to blade resonance issues. Alternatively, the unit 900 could use a vertical axis turbine; such vertical axis turbines avoid the need for a yaw control system to keep the rotor facing the prevailing wind, but have not been commercially proven and may give rise to blade resonance issues. The unit 900 could use a WARP type turbine, as manufactured by ENECO Texas LLC, although full scale turbines of this type have not yet been tested. Finally, as already noted, the unit 900 could use a cellular wind turbine assembly of the present invention, as described above with reference to Figures 1-8.<br>
In order to reduce the costs of individual bases, the number of cable mountings thereon could be reduced. The unit shown in Figure 9 is designed to use a base with six cable mountings, which can accommodate the layouts shown in Figures 10A-10E using only one type of base. The number of cable mountings on the base could be reduced to three. However, since not all of the bases shown in Figure 10A-10E have the same cable layout, multiple types of bases might be needed if the number of cable mounting were reduced.<br>
A commercial wind farm would typically make use of larger numbers of units 900 than shown in Figure 10A. The arrangement shown in Figure 10A might be regarded as a pilot plant suitable for an extended commercial test; since the individual units 900 would typically be rated at 2.0 to 3.6 MW, the arrangement shown in Figure 10A might have an output of about 20 MW. Thus, a commercial wind farm might use 5 to 10 of the arrangements shown in Figure 10A (i.e., 35 to 70<br><br>
individual units 900) for a total output of 100 to 200 MW. Examples of larger wind farms are discussed with reference to Figures 20A to 20F below.<br>
One possible objection of floating wind farms, especially near shipping lanes, is the risk that a floating unit might break away from its anchors in severe weather and pose a hazard to navigation. To minimize this danger, at least some of the individual units 900 could be equipped with global positioning system (GPS) units arranged to provide position indications to an operator on shore, who could thus detect when any unit drifts too far from its expected position, and takes steps to retrieve the unit and issue an appropriate warning to shipping.<br>
Figure 11 is a schematic side elevation, similar to that of Figure 9, of a floating unit (generally designated 1100) which is a essentially a modified version of the unit 900 shown in Figure 9. Most parts of the unit 1100 are similar to those of Figure 9 and are labeled accordingly, but there are three major differences between the two units. Firstly, the base section 912 of unit 900 is replaced with a smaller base section 1112 which has substantially the form of a disc made of reinforced concrete. This base section 1112 may optionally be provided with a tension member tethered to the seabed. Secondly, the cylindrical buoyancy section 910 of unit 900 is replaced by a shorter buoyancy section (generally designated 1110) comprising a central cylindrical section 1110A capped at either end by frustoconical sections 1110B, 11 IOC which provide a smooth transition between the large diameter of the central section 1110A and the portions of the mast immediately above and below the buoyancy section 1110. The frustoconical sections 1110B, 1110C help reduce peak mechanical loads on the unit 1100 and minimize high frequency wave induced motions, especially heave.<br>
The most important difference, however, between the units 900 and 1100 is the provision in the latter of auxiliary cables 1114 which run from the upper end of section 1110A to cables 914, the junctions between cables 1114 and 914 being a substantial distance from the unit 1100. The auxiliary cables 1114 provide additional stability against wave and wind action to the unit 1100. (In some cases, the auxiliary cables 1114 could be connected to an anchor rather than to one of the cables 914.)<br><br>
The unit 1100 will typically be of substantial size and weight (all reference hereinafter to tons are to metric tons). The hub 904 may be 60 meters above the water surface 908, and this hub, together with the rotor 902 may weigh 100 tons. The remaining portion of the mast above the water may weigh 120 tons and the buoyancy section a further 120 tons. The subsurface section of the mast, equipped with ballast tanks, may have a weight varying from 160 (empty) to 1000 tons (ballasted), and the base section 1112, which is intended to rest 65 meters below the water surface 908 to avoid surface wave conditions, may weight 700 tons, for a total weight of 1000 to 2300 tons for the entire unit 1100. When the ballast tanks are full, the center of gravity of the unit, indicated by arrow G in Figure 11, is 40 meters below the water surface, while the center of buoyancy, indicated by arrow B, is 20 meters below the water surface, giving a metacentric height of 20 meters. These dimensions are designed so that 300 IcNewtons offeree of the hub 904 will be offset by only 4 degrees of inclination for the 20 meters inetacentric height. The size of the ballast tanks is designed to allow deep submersion for operation and shallower submersion for maintenance and construction.<br>
Figures 12A, 12B and 12C show one possible modification of the unit 1100, namely a change in the form of the base section 1112. Figure 12A is an enlarged view of the base section 1112 shown in Figure 11, this base section 1112 being about 12 meters in diameter and 1.5 meters thick. Figure 12B shows a view similar to that of Figure 12A of a modified base section having a disc 1112' around the periphery of which is formed a hoop or collar 1114, which increases the hydrodynamic mass of the base section to reduce heave motion from surface wave forces and lengthen the natural period of heave. Figure 12C is a section in a vertical plane including the axis of base section 1112' and shows the cross-section of collar 1114.<br>
Figures 13 A, 13B, 14A and 14B show a further modification of the unit 1100, namely a change in the form of the buoyancy section. Figure 13A is an enlarged view of the buoyancy section 1110 shown in Figure 11. Figure 13B shows a view similar to that of Figure 13A of a modified buoyancy section, which is notionally produced by moving buoyancy section 1110 below water surface 908 as indicated at 1110', placing a plate 1320 having essentially the form of a "three-<br><br>
pointed star" above the water surface and connecting buoyancy section 1110' to plate 1320 by four narrow vertical pillars 1322. Figures 14A and 14B are horizontal sections in the planes A-A and B-B respectively in Figure 13B, and show the arrangement of the pillars 1322. (Although four pillars 1322 are shown in Figures 13B, 14A and 14B, three pillars could alternatively be used, with the central pillar being omitted and the space thus cleared on the buoyancy section 1110' used to provide an access door to this section.)The modified buoyancy section is designed to produce a reduced cross-sectional area at the water surface, thereby reducing the effects of wave action on the unit 1100.<br>
Figure 15 illustrates the manner in which auxiliary cables 1112 may be used with the modified buoyancy section shown in Figures 13B, 14A and 14B. As indicated in Figure 15, the auxiliary cables 1112 may be attached either to buoyancy section 1110', preferably to the upper end thereof, or (as indicated by the broken line in Figure 15), to the plate 1320 above the water surface.<br>
The low center of gravity of the unit shown in Figure 15 provided by the heavy base 1114, and the substantial metacentric height (i.e., separation between this center of gravity and the center of buoyancy of the unit) render the unit very stable against wave action. Figures 16A-16E illustrate the stability of the unit against high waves, with Figure 16A showing the unit in a trough, Figure 16E showing the unit on a crest, and Figures 16B-16D showing the unit at intermediate positions. In each case, the ocean surface under the high wave conditions is denoted "H", while the same surface under calm conditions is denoted "C". It will be seen from Figures 16A-16E that there is no danger of the rotor being damaged by contact with the ocean surface even under these extreme high wave conditions.<br>
One advantage of off-shore wind farms, and especially deep water off-shore wind farms, over similar land-based wind farms is that the off-shore wind farms can make use of renewable energy sources in addition to wind; in particular, off-shore wind farms can make use of wave energy and/or the energy of marine currents. For example Figures 17 and 18 are respectively side elevation and top plan views of a unit (generally designated 1700) which is generally similar to the unit shown in Figure 15 described above except that it is equipped for wave energy power generation. As shown in Figures 17 and 18, the base 1712 of the unit 1700 is<br><br>
provided with three symmetrically spaced horizontally extending ribs 1720, which carry inner and outer circular members 1722 and 1724 respectively. The circular members 1722 and 1724 are connected to float members 1726 by cables 1728, these float members, when moved by wave action, move the cables 1728 relative to the circular members 1722 and 1724, thus serving to generate energy from waves in a known manner.<br>
Figure 19 is a side elevation of another unit (generally designated 1900) which is again generally similar to the unit shown in Figure 15 except that it is equipped for power generation from ocean currents. The mast of unit 1900 is provided with a collar section 1930, which is pivotable relative to the mast and which carries two arms 1932 extending horizontally in opposite directions from the section 1930. The free ends of the arms 1932 cany hubs 1936, on which are mounted rotors 1934 which can rotate under the influence of marine currents, thereby driving generators (not shown) located within the hubs 1936. Electricity from the generators is fed via cables (not shown) in the arms 1932 and the section 1930 to the mast, and thence via cables in the same way as previously described.<br>
The deep water off-shore wind farms described above with reference to Figures 9 to 19 have the advantage of being readily deployable in much deeper water than conventional shallow water off-shore wind farm; thus the deep water offshore wind farms greatly increase the number of potential sites for wind farms, are less likely to draw complaints concerning noise or esthetics, and can make use of the stronger and steadier winds of deep ocean waters. As shown with reference to Figures 16A-16E, wind farm units of the present invention can be made highly resistant to wave action, and interconnecting the units hi the manner already described further reduces the chances that units may be tipped, and thus damaged, by wave or storm action. The wind farm units of the present invention can readily be manufactured so that each component (for example, the turbine, the base and the buoyancy belt) can be made easily replaceable for maintenance, repair or upgrading.<br>
The present invention is not, of course, confined to direct supply of electricity from the wind farm; instead the wind farm may make use of the electricity generated in other ways. For example, a wind farm can be arranged so that the electricity generated is used to generate hydrogen, typically by electrolysis<br><br>
of water, and resultant hydrogen piped off-site. In the case of off-shore wind farms, it may be convenient for the wind farm to generate hydrogen which can then be piped ashore, rather than supplying the electricity to shore via an undersea cable. (The "decoupling" of the electricity generated at the wind farm from the on-shore electric power grid effected by the generation of hydrogen in this manner avoids the problems which wind farms may otherwise pose in terms of affecting the quality of the electric supply on-shore, and thus may avoid the limitations which some power companies place on the proportion of wind power which they deem acceptable.) Alternatively, the hydrogen could be accumulated at the wind farm, in either gaseous or liquid form and then removed by tanker. Since a wind farm operating in this manner requires no direct connection to shore, it can be positioned at greater distances off-shore.<br>
Figures 20A to 20J illustrate top plan views, similar to those of Figures 10A to 10E, of further wind farms of the present invention, and illustrate variations in the arrangements of anchors, and the way in which multiples of the smaller wind farms previously described may be used to form large, high output wind farms. The optimum arrangement of anchors, balancing the cost of additional anchors and their associated cables against the risk to the wind farm being disrupted or damaged by strong winds, waves or currents, varies greatly with local conditions such as depth, marine currents, tides, and anticipated wave situations, including for example  the  possibility of hurricanes  or  similar major storms.  The  anchor arrangements shown in Figures 20A, 20B and 20C are designed to provide stronger anchoring arrangements than that of Figure 10A. The arrangement of Figure 20A is essentially a modified form of the arrangement of Figure 10A, with each anchor 916 connected to three adjoining units 900 of the hexagon. The arrangement of Figure 20B is another modification of the arrangement of Figure 10A, with the provision of three additional anchors 916, each connected to two adjoining units 900 of the hexagon, so that each unit in the hexagon is connected to two spaced anchors, thus restraining the wind farm from overall rotation in azimuth. The arrangement of Figure 20C also uses six anchors arranged in a hexagon, but with each anchor only connected to one unit in the hexagon. The arrangement of Figure 20D is similar to<br><br>
that of Figure 20C, but with the cental floating unit connected to all six floating units of the hexagon to provide maximum stability in exposed locations.<br>
Figures 20E to 20J illustrate larger wind farms. Figure 20E illustrates a 25 floating unit, 27 cable, 3 anchor farm which is essentially an extended version of the farm of Figure IOC; in Figure 20E, the central floating unit may be replaced by an anchor (cf. Figure IOC) for greater stability. Figure 20F illustrates a 31 floating unit, 33 cable, 6 anchor farm designed for somewhat greater stability than the unit of Figure 20E; again, the central floating unit may be replaced by an additional anchor. Figure 20G illustrates a 19 floating unit, 30 cable, 6 anchor "expanded hexagon" farm which may be regarded as produced by superimposing six of the farms of Figure 20B and providing anchors only around the periphery of the farm, with each anchor connected to the three adjacent floating units. Figure 20H illustrates a similar expanded hexagon wind farm designed for somewhat greater stability than the farm of Figure 20G, and which may be regarded as produced by superimposing six of the farms of Figure 20C. Figures 201 and 20J illustrate large wind farms which would have outputs comparable to land-based non-wind farm power stations. The 57 floating unit, 90 cable, 13 anchor farm of Figure 201 may be regarded as formed using three of the farms of Figure 20G with sharing of anchors where possible, and similarly the 133 floating unit, 210 cable, 24 anchor farm of Figure 20J may be regarded as formed using seven of the farms of Figure 20H with sharing of anchors where possible. It should be noted that in the center of the wind farm of Figure 201 there is shown a central anchor connected to nine floating units in a symmetrical manner. If weather and current conditions do not require an anchor at this position, this central anchor may be eliminated and the nine cables simply connected to each other, either directly or via some buoy or other device provided with appropriate cable mountings. The wind farm of Figure 20J has six similar points where nine cables are connected to a single anchor in a symmetrical manner, and in some cases it may be possible to eliminate some or all of these six anchors and simply connect the cables to each other.<br>
The deployment process of the present invention will now be discussed. As indicated above, the floating units 900 and 1100 used in the floating power generation assemblies of the present invention can weigh up to 2000 tons<br><br>
even with empty ballast tanks and may be more than 120 meters in height. Outer ocean deployment of such large heavy units in conventional marine cranes is severely limited by weather conditions and hence a more stable and reliable deployment process is needed to achieve reliable deployment at lower cost. The deployment process of the present invention is designed to achieve these goals.<br>
A preferred deployment process will be described with reference to Figures 21 to 23. As shown in Figures 21A and 21B, the process uses an apparatus (generally designated 2100) mounted on an open deck 2102 of a vessel (only part of which is shown in Figure 21 A), the apparatus 2100 being pivotable relative to the deck 2102 about a horizontal axis indicated at 2104 adjacent the rear edge of the deck 2102. The apparatus 2100 comprises a base member 2106 having mounted thereof two spaced clamping members 2108, with two support beams 2110. As best seen in Figures 22B and 22C, the clamping members 2108 each have two jaws movable relative to each other between a closed position (Figure 22B) in which they can clamp a unit 900 or 1100, and an open position (Figure 22C) in which the unit is free to move relative to the clamping members.<br>
As may be seen from Figures 21 A, 22A, 23A and 23B, the entire apparatus 2100 can be pivoted above axis 2104 between a horizontal position (Figure 21 A) used for transport of a unit, and a vertical position (Figure 22A) used for loading or deploying a unit. Furthermore, when the clamping members 2108 are in their open position, the support beams 2110 can pivot relative to the base member 2106 between a position in which they lie flat against the base member 2106 (Figure 22A) to a position in which they extend perpendicular to the base member (Figures 23A and 23B) between the open jaws of the clamping members 2108, so that the support beams 2110 can be used to secure and handle the unit 900 or 1100.<br>
Figures 24Ato 24E illustrate the manner in which the apparatus 2100 is used to load a unit 1100 on to a vessel for transport to a deployment site. The unit 1100 will normally be constructed in a dry dock 2400 (Figure 24A). The dry dock is then flooded (Figure 24B) and the vessel 2402 equipped with the apparatus 2100 is guided into the flooded dock with the apparatus 2100 in its vertical position. The support beams 2110 are attached to, and the clamping members 2108 are clamped around, the unit 1100 (Figure 24C) and the apparatus 2100 is then lowered to its<br><br>
horizontal position, thereby placing the unit 1100 flat on the deck of the vessel ready for transport to a deployment site (Figure 24D). Figure 24E shows a top plan view of the vessel and unit 1100 in this position.<br>
Figures 25 A to 25D illustrate the deployment of the unit 1100 at the deployment site. Figure 25A, which is essentially identical to Figure 24D, shows the vessel and unit arriving on site. The apparatus 2100 and unit 1100 are then raised to a vertical position (Figure 25B). The ballast tanks within the unit 1100 are then partially filled to adjust the buoyancy of the unit, the support beams 2110 are unlocked and the clamping members 2108 opened, and the ballast tanks further filled to achieve the correct deployment depth for the unit 1100 (Figure 25C). The unit 1100 is now floating free of the vessel, which is moved away from the floating unit and the apparatus 2100 returned to its horizontal position on the deck (Figure 25D). Retrieval of the unit 1100 can be achieved by reversing this deployment process.<br>
The deployment process of the present invention has several advantages over conventional deployment processes using marine cranes. During the stage of the deployment process in which the floating unit is moved from a horizontal position on a deck to a floating position, the great weight of the unit is applied to a lifting pivot which is significantly lower than that of the top of a crane capable of effecting the same operation, and this lower pivot position renders the present deployment process more suitable to be carried out in rough and calm seas. The lower pivot position also constrains the effective center of gravity of the unit relative to the vessel during lifting, thus minimizing the reduction in vessel stability and vessel motion experienced during such lifting, as compared with crane-based deployment of such a heavy floating unit. The unit can be lowered to the desired floating position by gradual filling of its ballast tanks, thus continuously maintaining the buoyancy balance of the unit and ensuring a "soft landing". For similar reasons, the retrieval process is also simpler as compared to a process using a crane.<br>
Figures 26A, 26B and 26C illustrate a modification of the process shown in 25A to 25D using an external floatation device 2600, which may be used when the unit being deployed is not sufficiently buoyant in its raised (vertical) position. As shown in Figure 26A, the external floatation device is placed around,<br><br>
and clamped to, the subsurface section of the unit 1100 while the unit is still in its horizontal position on a deck; it may be convenient to place the external floating device on the unit before the unit is loaded on to the vessel. The unit is raised to its vertical position with the device 2600 still attached (Figure 26B), but when the buoy reaches buoyancy equilibrium after partial filling of its ballast tanks, the clamps holding the device 2600 open and the device floats free of the unit 1100 (Figure 26C). Although not shown in Figures 26A, 26B and 26C, the device 2600 is desirably connected to the vessel by a cable of similar device to enable it to be retrieved from the water once the unit 1100 is floating free.<br>
Numerous variations in the form of the apparatus 2100 are possible, and several are illustrated in Figures 27A to 27G. Figures 27A and 27B illustrate a modified apparatus 2700 in which one clamping member 2708A is movable relative to the base member and to the other clamping member 2708B, thus allowing the spacing between the two clamping members to be varied and the apparatus 2700 to handle floating units of differing lengths. Figures 27C and 27D illustrate a modified apparatus 2710 having a pivot 2714 which is adjustable vertically relative to the deck of the vessel, thereby allowing apparatus 2710 to handle floating units having differing buoyancy centers. Figure 27E shows a further modified apparatus in which the base member can be translated relative to the pivot axis so that the clamping members and the support beams can move vertically during deployment or retrieval . of a floating unit. Figure 27F illustrates a modified apparatus comprising three spaced clamping members, one of which is disposed a substantial distance below the water surface when the apparatus is raised to its vertical position; this submerged clamping member provides additional support for the subsurface section of the floating unit being deployed. Finally, Figure 27G illustrates a further modified apparatus in which a hydraulic support 2730 is provided between the deck and the base member to provide supplementary lifting force.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
