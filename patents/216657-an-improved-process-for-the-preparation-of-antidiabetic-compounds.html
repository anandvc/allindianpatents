				<td>This application is a divisional application of 585/MAS/Ol, filed on 18thJuly 2001.<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of ant diabetic compounds having the formula (1).<br><br>
where R" represents alkyl group such as methyl, ethyl, propels, isopropyl and the like.<br>
The compound of formula (I) is useful in lowering the plasma glucose, triglyceride, total cholesterol (TC); increase high density lipoprotein (HDL) and decrease low density lipoprotein (LDL).<br>
The compound of formula (I) is also useful in reducing body weight and for the treatment and / or prophylaxis of diseases such as hypertension, coronary heart disease, atherosclerosis, stroke, peripheral vascular diseases and related disorders. The compound of formula (I) is also useful for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of insulin resistance (type II diabetes).<br>
Background of invention<br>
In our WTO application No. 2416/MAS/97 we have described a process for the preparation of a novel ant diabetic compound having the formula (1). The process described therein comprises of converting aldehydes of formula (2) where X represents hydrogen or halogen atom to a compound of formula (3) where all symbols are as defined above and R^ represents lower alkyl group, reducing the compound of formula (3) to produce a compound of formula (4), hydrolyzing the compound of formula (4) to obtain an acid of formula (5), converting the acid of formula (5) to an amide of the formula (6) and hydrolyzing the amide to produce<br><br><br>
Scheme-1<br>
While developing the improved process we observed that the process for the preparation of the compounds of the formula (1) as disclosed in our above referred apphcation involves<br>
•	the use of exotic reactions like Wittig-Homer reaction, which is a moisture<br>
sensitive reaction, to prepare the compound of the formula (3). Moisture<br>
sensitive reactions are difficult to handle in large scale manufacturing<br>
process.<br>
•	tedious reaction steps employing expensive, tedious and time consuming<br>
column chromatographic methods<br>
•	the overall yield of the compounds of the formula (1) is only -2.5% and<br>
time cycle required for the completion of the reaction sequence resulting<br>
in the compounds of the formula (1) is very long which makes the process<br>
very expensive for commercial application .<br><br>
In our co pending application No. 2431/MAS/98 we have described process for preparing the compound of formula (1). The reaction schemes are shown below:<br><br>
