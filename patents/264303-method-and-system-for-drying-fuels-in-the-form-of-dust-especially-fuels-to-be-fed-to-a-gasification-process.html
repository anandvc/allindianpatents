				<td>"Method and system for drying fuels in the form of dust,<br>
especially fuels to be fed to a gasification process"<br>
This invention is directed at a method and a system for<br>
drying fuels in the form of dust, especially fuels to be<br>
fed to a gasification process, such as coal, petroleum<br>
coke, biological wastes, or the like, of the type indicated<br>
in the preamble of the first method claim and the first<br>
system claim, respectively.<br>
Such methods and systems are known in various embodiments<br>
and configurations. Thus, for example, US 4,750,434<br>
describes heating and drying of dust particles fed to a<br>
mill. EP-0 203" 059-A, DE-37 24 96Q-A, and DE-39 43 366-A,<br>
to mention only a few examples, describe how lignite is<br>
crushed and dried.<br>
It is known, in this connection, that the dried dust is<br>
separated from the waste gases by a dust filter, e.g. a<br>
cloth filter. In this connection, a portion of the waste<br>
gas is released into the atmosphere, whereby it is also<br>
known to mix a portion of the hot waste gases with air and<br>
inert gases and to return it to the grinding system. The<br>
amount of fresh gases to be fed in is usually chosen so<br><br>
that the proportion of oxygen, depending on the type of<br>
fuel, is below 6 to 10 vol.-%, and the dew point of the gas<br>
flowing out of the mill is below 65°C. The resulting<br>
amount of inert gas, for example, is 4000 m3 and that of the<br>
released moist waste gas is about 10000 m3 per unit ton of<br>
the vaporized water.<br>
The temperature of the gas flowing into the mill is in the<br>
range of 150 to 450°C, and a portion of the ground particles<br>
reaches almost the gas temperature. Coal degasification<br>
begins even below 200°C, whereby CH4, C2H6, and CO are given<br>
off first. During the grinding and heating of petroleum<br>
coke, and of roasted biological fuels, a number of toxins<br>
can be formed, for example cyclic hydrocarbons, so that<br>
emission limits for hydrocarbons and for some individual<br>
substances may be exceeded with these alternative fuels.<br>
Removal of such toxins from very large streams of waste<br>
gas, for example 200,000 m3/h for 100 tons/h of coal<br>
containing 20% moisture, would be costly and thus also<br>
inefficient. It is also a disadvantage here that for the<br>
drying of lignite, for example, which often contains more<br>
than 50% moisture, with hot gases at gas temperatures<br><br>
between 350 and 1000°C, volatile constituents are formed<br>
that can no longer be released into the atmosphere.<br>
In the literature references mentioned above, there are<br>
sometimes instructions to heat crushed coal in a fluidized<br>
bed, with a heat exchanger, whereby a portion of the gas<br>
leaving the fluidized bed consists of almost pure steam and<br>
is compressed to 3 to 5 bar, in order to raise the<br>
temperature at which the gas can then be fed back into the<br>
heat exchanger immersed in the fluidized bed. This steam<br>
condenses there and releases its heat of condensation to<br>
the fluidized bed, whereby the temperature of the heat<br>
exchanger surfaces is below 150°C, so that no degasification<br>
products are released. However, the coal has to be ground<br>
again before being transported to the entrained flow<br>
gasifier, so that a total of two mills is required, with<br>
complicated drying, so that such lignite grinding and<br>
drying systems are clearly more expensive than the<br>
corresponding systems for bituminous coal.<br>
Therefore, the present invention is intended not only to<br>
avoid the disadvantages described above, but its task in<br>
particular consists in proposing a cost-advantageous<br><br>
grinding and drying method and a corresponding system, with<br>
low emissions and low inert gas demand.<br>
This problem is solved, according to the invention, by a<br>
method of the type designated initially, by providing that<br>
a portion of the transport/drying gas stream is cooled and<br>
dried in a spray tower or the like, whereby a portion of<br>
the dried gas leaving the spray tower is passed back into<br>
the surroundings and/or to a furnace, and the other portion<br>
is passed back into the transport/drying gas stream.<br>
It can be seen that with the procedure according to the<br>
invention, a portion of the recycled gas is cooled in the<br>
spray tower, in order to lower the moisture content and<br>
thus to enable -the circulating gas to give up the coal<br>
moisture once again. In this connection, some of the gas<br>
leaving the spray tower can be cleaned, for example by way<br>
of an adsorbent, and released to the surroundings, or it<br>
can be fed to a,furnace and/or a catalytic reactor, in<br>
order to combust the hydrocarbons originating from the fuel<br>
and other degasification products, and to remove the<br>
nitrogen oxides formed during the combustion.<br><br>
Embodiments of the method according to the invention are<br>
found in the dependent claims relating to the method, and<br>
in the system claims.<br>
To overcome pressure losses of the gas<br>
purification/combustion upon leaving the system, for<br>
example, the circulation pressure can be raised, or<br>
alternatively, as the invention provides for in an<br>
embodiment, an appropriate blower can be used to raise the<br>
pressure. According to the invention, complete removal of<br>
the toxins from a small waste gas stream is possible at low<br>
effort and cost. A spent solid adsorbent, for example<br>
activated charcoal, can also be mixed into the fuel and<br>
gasified, at no cost. All toxins are completely destroyed<br>
at the high temperatures of the entrained flow gasifier.<br>
In another embodiment, the portion of recycled gas can be<br>
heated, for example in a first heat exchanger, whereby the<br>
temperature can be selected so that the temperature of the<br>
gas stream in the system circulation is above the dew point<br>
after mixing with the substream of gas from the spray<br>
tower, so that the droplets and wet dust particles<br>
entrained in the spray tower are vaporized or dried before<br>
entering a subsequent heat exchanger.<br><br>
In the case of a possible failure of the coal feed, the hot<br>
gas is barely cooled in the mill.. This would lead to the<br>
destruction of the filter bags in a very short time. This<br>
problem can be dealt with according to the invention by<br>
providing that the additional heat exchanger can be<br>
bypassed. Use is advantageously made here of the fact that<br>
the diversion of such gas streams occurs distinctly more<br>
quickly than cooling in a heat exchanger, so that the cloth<br>
filters are effectively protected against high<br>
temperatures.<br>
The circulated transport/drying gas can be further<br>
increased, according to the invention, by burning a fuel,<br>
since in the present case, clearly higher prevailing<br>
temperatures can be reached than with conventional grinding<br>
systems, because no degasification products are released<br>
into the atmosphere. The necessary gas circulation is<br>
reduced by this temperature increase, and with this the<br>
investment costs for the system elements of the gas<br>
circulation are lowered.<br><br>
It is advantageous, according to the invention, to use<br>
hydrogen-rich fuel gas and oxygen as the combustion medium,<br>
which in turn leads to a reduction of the waste gas stream.<br>
In another embodiment according to the invention, it can be<br>
provided that the oxygen content in circulation is lowered<br>
with inert gas before the grinding system is started up,<br>
with the burner turned off, whereby the term inert gas here<br>
comprises N2, noble gases, and/or CO2, but not steam. The<br>
inert gas demand according to the invention is extremely<br>
low, even if oxygen-free gas is aimed at during the<br>
grinding and drying of a highly reactive lignite, which can<br>
already ignite at temperatures above 40°C.<br>
Other characteristics, details, and advantages of the<br>
invention are evident from the following description and<br>
from the drawing. The drawing, in its single figure, shows<br>
a system schematic according to the invention.<br>
In the system shown in the figure, a fuel, for example<br>
lignite, is fed to the system according to the arrow 1, and<br>
is delivered to the mill 2 by means of an appropriate<br>
conveyor. The mill 2 simultaneously serves to crush, dry,<br>
and sift, whereby the fine dust that is formed, 
 <br>
is discharged pneumatically at 60 to 120°C, and fed to a<br>
filter 3 by way of the line 21, which filter separates the<br>
solids and delivers them to a container 4, so that the<br>
crushed and dried fuel can be delivered to further<br>
processes.<br>
A blower 5 is provided to transport the transport/drying<br>
gas in circulation, with which blower the purified gas is<br>
moved along, whereby a substream is fed, by way of a line<br>
labeled 12, to a spray tower 6 for cooling, and another<br>
substream is passed along, by way of a heat exchanger 11<br>
for heating, and by way of the line 12a. In this<br>
connection, at least 15% of the amounts leaving the blower<br>
5 are passed into the heat exchanger 11.<br>
The proportion of gas to the heat exchanger 11 depends<br>
primarily on the gas temperature ahead of the mill. If a<br>
high gas temperature is set with the burner 17, a small<br>
amount of gas is needed in the circulation, and the gas<br>
stream 12a is omitted (i.e. 100% to the spray tower 6). On<br>
the other hand, if no burner 17 is provided when drying<br>
alternative fuels, and only a low temperature (for example<br>
200°C) is reached in the heat exchanger 15, most of the gas<br>
is recirculated through the line 12a, and only a small<br><br>
portion, for example 15%, is dried in the spray tower 6.<br>
Advantage: No CO2 from combustion and little CO2 in 9, and<br>
therefore activated charcoal can be used, for example, to<br>
remove toxins such as chlorinated hydrocarbons.<br>
The condensate formed in the spray tower is likewise<br>
circulated, for the most part, specifically by way of a<br>
cooling heat exchanger 7; a substream of the condensate,<br>
formed from the excess, is removed from the system by way<br>
of a line 8.<br>
At this point it should be pointed out that the heat<br>
exchanger 7 can be configured as an integral component of<br>
the spray tower 6. A portion of the transport/drying gas<br>
stream cooled in the spray tower 6 can be removed from the<br>
system by way of the line 9 and, optionally, by way of a<br>
blower 21, and for example, as shown, purified by a gas<br>
purifier 10, for example an adsorbent, and discharged to<br>
the environment, or passed to a furnace in order to burn<br>
off the toxins it still contains. The significant portion<br>
is passed back into the circulation system by way of the<br>
line 13, for further drying.<br><br>
The substream circulated by way of a heating heat exchanger<br>
11 in the line 12a, and the substream 13 cooled by the<br>
spray tower, are combined and delivered, by way of the line<br>
14, to another heat exchanger 15 used for heating. The<br>
total gas stream is then fed, by way of the line 22, over a<br>
burner 17, in order to increase its temperature, and from<br>
there it is fed, in heated form, into the mill 2. The fuel<br>
and oxygen feeds assigned to the burner 17 are labeled 18<br>
and 19, while the arrow 20 indicates an inert gas feed to<br>
the mill 2.<br>
As can also be seen from the system circuit, the heat<br>
exchanger 15 can be circumvented by way of a bypass 16,<br>
particularly in order to regulate the temperature of' the<br>
total circulated gas volume, whereby this bypass 16 can<br>
also be an integral structural part of the heat exchanger<br>
15.<br>
The mode of operation of the present invention is described<br>
below, using an example.<br>
The supplied coal 1, for example 50 kg/s, is to be dried<br>
from 30 wt.-% to 3 wt.-%. 14 kg/s of moisture must be<br>
evaporated, for which 36 MW are needed. After considering<br><br>
other heat sinks and the supplied grinding energy, the heat<br>
demand is about 40 MW. The temperature of the circulated<br>
gas is 460°C before reaching the mill 2, and 105°C<br>
thereafter. At the specific heat capacity of the gas of 40<br>
kJ/kmol/K, 2.8 kmol/s are necessary at the input to the<br>
mill 2 to cover the heat demand. 36 kg/s of dried coal are<br>
deposited in the filter 3. 80% of the gas cleaned of dust<br>
in the filter 3 are passed to the spray tower 6.<br>
Upon cooling to 45°C, the moisture in the gas is reduced<br>
from 35 vol.-% to 10 vol.-%, and 14 kg/s of water condense<br>
out. To purify the gas 10 and release it into the<br>
atmosphere, 0.09 kmol/s (2.5 m3/s) of the demoisturized gas<br>
is split off. The gas flowing through the heat exchanger<br>
11 is heated to 180°C. The temperature of the mixture (line<br>
14) is 80°C, and the dew point is 60°C, so that the water<br>
droplets entrained from the spray tower 6 evaporate ahead<br>
of the heat exchanger 15. The gas is heated to 234°C in<br>
this heat exchanger 15. The burner 17 is provided with a<br>
gas mixture of CO : H2 = 1 : 1 and with oxygen (95% O2)<br>
(arrows 18, 19). To reach the waste gas temperature of<br>
460°C, 25 MW (Hu) are consumed.<br><br>
In addition to the system circuits described above,<br>
alternatives can also be provided according to the<br>
invention, including the following:<br>
as above, but without fuel burner 17, for practical<br>
purposes with little evaporation in the, mill and with<br>
purification 10 using activated charcoal, which is<br>
deactivated by CO2 from combustion,<br>
as above, but without heating 11 of the spray tower bypass<br>
stream, for practical purposes at 12 &gt; 13, i.e. with little<br>
evaporation in the mill,<br>
without 11, 15, 16 - lower investment costs, but more<br>
release into the atmosphere 9, 10; greater, higher fuel<br>
consumption 18, but no steam necessary,<br>
cooler 8 integrated into the spray tower 6,<br>
cooling tower in the form of a heat exchanger whose surface<br>
is sprayed/wetted with circulating condensate,<br>
a condensate separator with droplet separator follows the<br>
spray tower,<br><br>
blower 21 instead of increasing the pressure level of the<br>
gas circulation,<br>
water injection instead of bypass 16,<br>
water circulation by way of an external cooling tower, for<br>
example power plant cooling tower, instead of cooler 7,<br>
heat from the heat exchanger 7 is utilized, for example to<br>
heat the cold water,<br>
the wastewater treatment depends on the wastewater<br>
composition, for example biologically or by oxidation,<br>
directly in a cooling tower, or passed to a water treatment<br>
plant,<br>
multiple successive spray towers to better separate out<br>
particles contained in the gas 12 in low concentrations,<br>
and to avoid deposits in the heat exchanger 15.<br><br>

According to a method for drying fuels in the form of dust, particularly to be fed<br>
to a gasification process, such as coal, petroleum coke, biological waste, or the<br>
like, wherein the fuel (1) is crushed in a mill (2) and fed to a filter/separator (3)<br>
by means of a propellant and drying gas, and at least part of the<br>
propellant/drying gas in the circuit is returned to the mill (2) after heating, the<br>
known disadvantages are not only to be avoided, but particularly a cost-effective<br>
milling and drying method and a corresponding system are to be provided,<br>
having low emissions and a low inert gas requirement. This is achieved<br>
according to the method in that part of the propellant/ drying gas flow in cooled<br>
down and dehumidified in a spray tower (6), or the like, wherein part of the<br>
dried gas exiting the spray tower is fed to the environment and/or a firing<br>
process, and the other part is returned to the propellant/drying gas flow.</td>
