TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROCESSES FOR PREPARING 4-tert.-BUTYLCYCLOHEXANOL AND 4-tert.-BUTYLCYCLOHEXYL ACETATE BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing 4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol containing a  larger amount of a cis-isomer by hydrogenating 4-tert.-butylphenol.    The present invention also  relates to  a process for preparing 4-tert.-butylcyclohexyl acetate by acetylating 4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol  obtained  by the process described above. Description  of the Related Art<br>
4-tert.-Butylcyclohexyl  acetate  is widely used as a perfume for cosmetics including soaps, and fragrance of its cis-isomer is more favorable than that of its trans-isomer.    To prepare 4-tert.-butylcyclohexyl  acetate  having  a  high  cis-isomer content,   it is desired to provide a process for preparing 4-tert.-butylcyclo-hexanol containing its cis-isomer in a larger amount as a raw material   of   4-tert.-butylcyclohexyl   acetate.<br>
In general, 4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol  is prepared  by hydrogenating   4-tert.-butylphenol.<br>
JP-B-42-13938 discloses a process for preparing 4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol   comprising   catalytically   reducing   4-tert.-butylphenol in the presence of a rhodium base catalyst.<br>
MARUZEN OIL TECHNICAL REVIEW (MARUZEN SEKIYU GIHO) (1971) page 77 discloses a process for preparing 4-tert.-butylcyclo-hexanol comprising  hydrogenating 4-tert.-butylphenol  in the presence of various transition metals of the 8 to 10 Groups of the<br><br>
Periodic Table.<br>
JP-A-54-122253 discloses a process for preparing a cis alkylcyclohexanol comprising hydrogenating an alkylphenol in the presence of a ruthenium-alumina catalyst.<br>
US-A-2927127 discloses a process for preparing 4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol which has a high cis-isomer content comprising   hydrogenating   4-tert.-butylphenol.<br>
JP-A-3-173842 discloses a process for preparing 4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol   comprising   hydrogenating   4-tert.-butyl-phenol in the presence of a combined catalyst of Rh supported on a carrier and a boron fluoride type acid such as HBF4.<br>
However,  the  cis-isomer  content  in   4-tert.-butylcyclo-hexanol which is prepared by the processes disclosed in JP-B-42-13938, MARUZEN OIL TECHNICAL REVIEW and JP-A-54-122253 is still  insufficient.    The process of US-A-2927127 achieves a high cis-isomer content in ethanol in the presence of the rhodium catalyst, but the reaction should be performed under a high hydrogen pressure.   Then, an improvement has been sought as a preparation process of 4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol.    Further, since the process of JP-A-3-173842 uses the boron fluoride type acid, a workload is required to recover fluorine and boron, and the generated acids such as HF corrode a production equipment. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a process for preparing  4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol  which  can  be carried out under a mild condition and produce 4-tert.-butylcycloÂ¬hexanol having a high cis-isomer content.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a<br><br>
process for preparing 4-tert.-butylhexyl acetate having a high cis-isomer content.<br>
According to the first aspect, the present invention provides  a process for preparing  4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol comprising  hydrogenating 4-tert.-butylphenol  in  a solvent in the presence of a rhodium catalyst and a compound selected from the group consisting of hydrogen chloride and (anhydrous) sulfuric acid.<br>
According to the second aspect, the present invention provides a process for preparing 4-tert.-butylcyclohexyl acetate comprising acetylating 4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol which has been prepared by hydrogenating 4-tert.-butylphenol in a solvent in the presence of a rhodium catalyst and a compound selected from the group consisting of hydrogen chloride, perchloric acid and (anhydrous) sulfuric acid. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The rhodium catalyst to be used in the hydrogenation reaction according to the present invention includes metal rhodium (valency of zero) or a compound of rhodium having a valency of up to 6 such as rhodium chloride, rhodium oxide and so on.<br>
The metal rhodium or rhodium compound is preferably used in the form of a supported type catalyst, that is, the metal rhodium or rhodium compound supported on a carrier such as activated carbon, Si02, AI2O3, etc.   Among the supported type catalyst, metal rhodium supported on the carrier is more preferable. In the case of the supported type catalyst, a supported amount of metal rhodium is usually between 1 and 10 wt. %, preferably between 3 and 5 wt. % based on the weight of the carrier.<br>
After the reaction, the rhodium catalyst may be<br><br>
recovered from a reaction mixture by a conventional method such as filtration,   decantation,   centrifugation,   and   recycled.<br>
The amount of the rhodium catalyst to be used in the reaction is between about 0.01 and 1 wt. % (in terms of metal rhodium) based on the weight of the raw material, 4-tert.-butylphenol.    In the case of the supported type catalyst, while an amount of the catalyst (including the carrier) depends on the supported amount of the rhodium metal or compound, it is between about 0.1 and 50 wt. % (in a dry form) based on the weight of 4-tert.-butylphenol.    As the amount of the catalyst increases, the selectivity of the cis-isomer increases.    The amount of the catalyst is preferably between 0.5 and 10 wt. % in view of the cost and workability  in  the filtration  step for recovering the  catalyst.<br>
Any solvent may be used as long as it has no adverse effect on the reaction.    A solvent which is liquid at room temperaÂ¬ture (25Â°C) is preferable because of easy handling.    Examples of the solvent are alkanes having 5 to 10 carbon atoms, ethers having 4 to 10 carbon atoms, alcohols having 1 to 6 carbon atoms, and so on. Specific examples of the solvent are acyclic alkanes (e.g. pentane, hexane, heptane, etc.), cyclic alkanes (e.g. cyclohexane, etc.), acyclic ethers (e.g. diethyl ether, etc.), cyclic ethers (e.g. tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, etc.), and alcohols (e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, iso-propanol,  butanol,  isobutanol,  pentanol,  hexanol,  4-methyl-2-pentanol, cyclohexanol, etc.).   Among them, cyclohexane and isopropanol are preferable.    In particular, isopropanol is preferable.<br>
The amount of the solvent is usually between about 0.2 and o 20 times, preferably between 0.4 and 5 times the weight of 4-tert.-butylphenol.<br><br>
In the process of the present invention, the reaction is performed in the solvent in the presence of the rhodium catalyst and also hydrogen chloride, perchloric acid or (anhydrous) sulfuric acid.<br>
Hydrogen chloride may be supplied in the reaction system in any form, for example, by bubbling hydrogen chloride gas through the reaction system, or adding hydrochloric acid to the reaction system.    Alternatively, hydrochloric acid may be formed in the reaction system, for example, by charging water and AICI3 or TiCU to the reaction system.    In addition, a catalyst which generates hydrogen chloride in the reaction system such as rhodium chloride may be used.<br>
Also, (anhydrous) sulfuric acid may be supplied in the reaction system in any form, for example, by bubbling SO3 gas through the reaction system or adding an aqueous sulfuric acid solution to the reaction system.    Perchloric acid is added to the reaction system generally in the form of an aqueous solution.<br>
An order of the addition of the raw material, the rhodium catalyst, the solvent and hydrogen chloride, perchloric acid or (anhydrous) sulfuric acid  is arbitrary.<br>
The amount of hydrogen chloride, perchloric acid or (anhydrous) sulfuric acid is usually between about 0.01  and 100 moles, preferably between about 0.05 and 10 moles, more preferably between 0.1 and 10 moles per one mole of the rhodium atom in the rhodium   catalyst.<br>
The process of the present invention may be carried out in a stream of hydrogen gas or in a pressurized hydrogen atmosÂ¬phere.    Other reaction conditions may not be critical.    In view of a reaction rate, the reaction is preferably carried out in the pressu-<br><br>
rized hydrogen atmosphere.    In this case, a pressure reactor is used.<br>
When the reaction is carried out under the pressurized hydrogen atmosphere, a partial pressure of hydrogen is at least about 1.5 x 105 Pa.    In view of the reaction rate, the selectivity of the cis-isomer and the pressure resistance of the equipment, the partial pressure of hydrogen is preferably between 3 x 105 and 2 x 106 Pa, more preferably between 5 x 105 and 1.5 x 106 Pa.<br>
The reaction temperature is at least about 20Â°C in view of the reaction rate and the selectivity of the cis-isomer, and preferably 100Â°C or lower in view of the selectivity of the cis-isomer.    More preferably, the reaction temperature is between 40 and 80Â°C in view of the reaction rate and the selectivity of the cis-isomer.<br>
The process of the present invention may be carried out continuously or batchwise.<br>
The termination of the reaction can be confirmed by a conventional method.    For example, the reaction mixture is analyzed and a time when the conversion of 4-tert.-butylphenol is 100 % is used as the termination of the reaction, or a time when no further decrease of the hydrogen pressure is observed is used as the termination  of the  reaction.<br>
Furthermore,  4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol   obtained  by the above reaction can be acetylated to obtain 4-tert.-butylcyclohexyl<br>
acetate.<br>
The acetylation can be performed continuously from the above  hydrogenation   of  4-tert.-butylphenol.     Alternatively,   4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol obtained by the above reaction can be once isolated from the reaction mixture and then acetylated in a separate<br><br>
step.<br>
For acetylation, any conventional acetylation agent such as acetic anhydride, acetic acid, acetyl chloride, and the like may be used.<br>
The amount of the acetylation agent is usually between 1 mole and 5 moles, preferably between 1 mole and 1.5 moles, per one  mole  of 4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol.<br>
The reaction temperature in the acetylation is usually between room temperature (about 25Â°C) and 150Â°C, preferably between room temperature (about 25Â°C) and 130Â°C.<br>
The acetylation can be terminated when the conversion of 4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol is found to be 100 % through the analysis of the reaction  mixture.<br>
The presence of a solvent is not essential in the acetylation  process, while a solvent which  is less acetylated may be used.    Solvents which are in the liquid state at room temperature is preferable in view of easy handling.    Examples of such the solvent are acyclic alkanes (e.g. pentane, hexane, heptane, etc.), cyclic alkanes (e.g. cyclohexane, etc.), unsaturated hydrocarbons (e.g. toluene, etc.), acyclic ethers (e.g. diethyl ether, etc.), cyclic ethers (e.g. tetrahydrofuran, etc.), and the like.   Among them, toluene and cyclohexane are preferable.<br>
In addition to the acetylation agent, a catalyst may be used in the acetylation reaction.    The kind of the catalyst depends on the acetylation agent to be used.    For example, sulfuric acid, hydrochloric acid,  p-toluenesulfonic acid,  zinc chloride,  sodium acetate, pyridine, and the like can be used, when acetic anhydride is used as the acetylation agent.    Alternatively, sulfuric acid or BF3<br><br>
may be used, when acetic acid is used as the acetylation agent. Among these catalyst, sulfuric acid is preferably in view of a cost.<br>
The amount of the catalyst is usually between 0.01 and 5 mole %, preferably between 0.1 and 2 mole %, of the amount of 4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol.    When the amount of the catalyst is too small, the reaction rate is too low, while it is too larger 4-tert.-butylhexanol tends to be dehydrated.<br>
When acetic acid is used as the acetylation agent, the acetylation  is preferably carried out while removing by-produced water in view of the reaction rate.   Water may be removed by evaporating water azeotropically with a solvent which can be evaporated azeotropically with water under refluxing conditions,  or by adding a drying agent such as silica gel to the reaction system.<br>
When acetyl chloride is used as the acetylation agent, the acetylation  is preferably carried out while removing by-produced hydrogen chloride in view of safety.    Hydrogen chloride may be removed with a base such as inorganic bases (e.g. potassium carbonate, 10 % sodium hydroxide, etc.) or organic bases (e.g. pyridine, etc. ) potassium carbonate.<br>
Among the acetylating agents, acetic anhydride is preferable in view of the conversion of the raw material in the acetylation   reaction.<br>
It   is   difficult   to   separate   resulting   4-tert.-butylcyclo-hexyl   acetate  from  4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol   by   distillation  since they have the close boiling points.    Therefore, the conversion of 4-tert.-butylhexanol is preferably equal or close to 100 %.    To this end, for example, acetic acid or acetyl chloride is used as the acetylation agent and the acetylation reaction is carried out until<br><br>
the conversion reaches about 90 % or higher, and then the acetylation is completed with acetic anhydride in the same molar amount as the residual raw material so that the raw material is consumed completely. EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The process of the present invention can easily prepare 4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol  having the  high  content of the cis-isomer useful as a raw material of a perfume from 4-tert.-butylphenol. That is, 4-tert.-butylcyclohexanol can be obtained at a yield of about 90 % or higher, and the content of the cis-isomer in the product reaches about 80 % or more.<br>
4-tert.-Butylcyclohexyl  acetate  having  the  high  content of the cis-isomer can  obtained  by acetylating 4-tert.-butylhexanol which has been prepared by the process of the present invention. EXAMPLES<br>
