				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to yarn treatment jets, and in particular to intermingling jets for<br>
intermingling the filaments of a multifilament textile yarn.<br>
Many configurations of intermingling jets are known. Generally such jets have a body through<br>
which a yarn passage extends, with one or more fluid inlets communicating with the yarn<br>
passage in a transverse direction so as to direct a jet or jets of the fluid laterally of the yarn as<br>
it passes through the yam passage. Generally also, for intermingling purposes, the cross<br>
section of the yarn passage is symmetrical about a longitudinal axis and the axis or axes of<br>
the fluid inlet(s) intersect(s) the axis of the yarn passage so that there is no or little twisting<br>
effect on the yarn. The transverse flow of fluid causes the filaments of the running yarn to<br>
whirl about in the yarn passage and become intermingled. Such treatment jets intermingle<br>
multifilament yams with differing degrees of success. One of the major problems of such jets<br>
is that the filaments whirl about in an uncontrolled manner so that the degree of intermingling<br>
varies along the length of the yarn, creating dye shade and feel variations in a fabric knitted or<br>
woven from the resulting yarn.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a yarn treatment jet for intermingling the<br>
filaments of a multifilament yarn in which the whirling of the filaments is more controlled, and<br>
in consequence the degree of intermingling along the length of the yarn is more uniform and<br>
more consistent from jet to jet, than has been achieved with known jets.<br>
extending longitudinally<br>
The invention provides a yam treatment jet comprising a body having a yarn passage <br>
therethrough and an inlet for a fluid intersecting the yarn passage transversely thereof, wherein<br>
the yarn passage has in cross section a main part and a yarn controlling part of lesser width<br>
than the main part and wherein the fluid inlet has a width which is greater than that of the yarn<br>
controlling part.<br>
The fluid inlet may intersect the yarn controlling part and direct the fluid in the direction of the<br>
main part. The fluid inlet may have a width which is greater than that of the yarn controlling<br>
part, and which is equal to but preferably less than that of the main part. The yarn treatment<br>
jet may have yarn guides adjacent the inlet and outlet ends of the yarn passage, which yarn<br>
guides are disposed to guide a running yarn through the yarn controlling part of the yam<br>
passage. The yarn guides may be positionally adjustable towards and away from the jet<br>
body.<br>
The yarn treatment jet may have a threading slot extending longitudinally thereof, which<br>
threading slot communicates with the outside of the body and the yarn passage. The<br>
threading slot may communicate with the yarn passage in the yarn controlling part. The<br>
threading slot may be curved between the outside of the body and the yarn passage. The<br>
outer end of the threading slot may be enlarged relative to the remainder of the threading slot.<br>
The main part of the yarn passage may be circular in cross-section, or may be triangular in<br>
cross-section. The controlling part of the yarn passage may have sides that are substantially<br>
parallel.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is an end elevation of a yarn treatment jet,<br>
Fig. 2 is a longitudinal section on line 2-2 of the jet of Fig. 1,<br>
Fig. 3 is a longitudinal section of a second embodiment of treatment jet,<br>
Fig. 4 is a section on line 4-4 of Fig. 2 or Fig. 3,<br>
Fig. 5 is a section similar to Fig. 4 of a third embodiment of treatment jet, and<br>
Fig. 6 is a longitudinal section of the jet of Fig. 3 showing movable yam guides.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 1, 2 and 4, there is shown a yarn treatment jet 10 having a body 11 and<br>
a yarn passage 12 extending longitudinally therethrough. The yarn passage 12 has in cross<br>
section, as shown in Figs 1 and 4, a main part 13 and a yarn controlling part 14. A yarn inlet<br>
guide 15 and a yarn outlet guide 16 adjacent the inlet and outlet ends respectively of the yam<br>
passage 12 are disposed to guide a running yarn 17 through the yam controlling part 14. A<br>
fluid inlet 18 is formed in the body 11 so as to intersect the yarn passage 12, in this case<br>
perpendicularly. More particularly, the fluid inlet 18 intersects the yarn controlling part 14 and<br>
directs the fluid through the yarn controlling part 14, past the running yarn 17 and towards the<br>
main part 13. Preferably the fluid is air. A yarn threading slot 19 extends longitudinally of the<br>
body 11 and communicates with the outside of the body 11 and the yarn passage 12, more<br>
particularly with the bottom of the yam controlling part 14. For ease of threading, the outer<br>
end 20 of the threading slot 19 is enlarged relative to the remainder of the threading slot 19,<br>
which is curved between the outer end 20 and the yam controlling part 14 so as to lessen any<br>
tendency for the yam 17 to come out of the passage 12 under the influence of the fluid jet.<br>
Although the main part 13 of the passage 12 is shown in Figs. 1 and 4 as being circular in<br>
cross section, other shapes such as oval, square, rectangular or triangular may be used if<br>
desired, as exemplified in jet 22 in Fig. 5. Simlarly, although the controlling part 14 is shown<br>
in Figs. 1 and 4 as having substantially parallel sides, they may be non-parallel as shown in jet<br>
22 in Fig. 5. However for any chosen cross sectional shape of the main part 13, the width d of<br>
the yarn controlling part 14 is less than the width D of the main part 13, for example less than<br>
80% and preferably less than 50% of the width D. The width w of the fluid inlet 18 is greater<br>
than the width d of the yarn controlling part 14, and may be equal to the width D of the main<br>
part 13, i.e. D = w &gt; d. In the case of the controlling part 14 having non-parallel sides as<br>
shown in Fig. 5, the width w is the widest dimension of the controlling part 14 and satisfies the<br>
relationship D = w &gt; d.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 3 in conjunction with Figs. 1 and 4, there is shown a yarn treatment jet<br>
21 which is identical with the treatment jet 10 except in one respect. Corresponding parts of<br>
jets 10 and 21 are identified by the same numerals. Jet 21 differs from jet 10 only in that in<br>
the case of the jet 21 the fluid inlet 18 is inclined at an angle A in the direction of movement of<br>
the running yarn 17 so as to assist in forwarding the yarn 17 through the jet 21.<br>
With the arrangement herein described, the running multifilament yarn 17 is guided through<br>
the treatment jet 10, 21 within the yarn controlling part 14 of the yarn passage 12. This<br>
provides a certain amount of constraint on the movement of the filaments of the yarn 17,<br>
thereby leading to a more uniform and consistent intermingling of the filaments along the<br>
length of the yarn 17 and from jet to jet. Furthermore, with a fluid inlet 18 having a greater<br>
width W than the width d of the yarn controlling part 14, it is ensured that the yarn 17 is<br>
subjected to the more streamlined and full rate of flow of the fluid and not, as occurs with<br>
known jets, the turbulent and random flow at the edges of the fluid jet and adjacent the<br>
sidewalls of the main part 13 of the yarn passage 12. This also ensures that the degree of<br>
intermingling is more uniform along the length of the yarn 17 and more consistent from jet to<br>
jet.<br>
In operation, the force of the air jet on the yarn 17 within the controlling part 14 tends to push<br>
the yarn 17 upwardly towards the main part 13. The yarn 17 then tends to collapse back<br>
down until forced upwardly again. The rate of collapse, i.e. the rate of up and down oscillation<br>
of the yarn 17, governs the intensity and frequency of the nodes in the intermingled yarn 17.<br>
As shown in Fig. 6, the yarn inlet and outlet guides 15, 16 may be adjusted from the positions<br>
shown in full lines adjacent the jet body 11 to the positions shown in broken lines more remote<br>
from the jet body 11, the yarn 17 oscillating between the full and broken lines shown. Such<br>
movement of the guides 15, 16 alters restoring force and the degree of control exercised by<br>
the yarn guides 15, 16 on the yarn 17 as it travels through the yarn passage 12, thereby<br>
influencing the node frequency and intensity. The guides 15, 16 may be positioned as<br>
required in any particular case to provide optimum performance of the intermingling jet 10, 21.<br>
