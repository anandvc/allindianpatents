BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The present invention pertains to organic and inorganic light active devices, and hybrids thereof, and methods of making the same. More particularly, the present invention pertains to devices and methods for fabricating light active devices that can be' used for applications such as general lighting, display backlighting, video displays, Internet appliances, electronic books, digital newspapers and maps, stereoscopic vision aides, head mounted displays, advanced vehicle windshields, solar cells, cameras and photodetectors. A multi-color single layer light active device is disclosed. Also disclosed is a sequential burst driving scheme for a multi-color single layer display. Further disclosed are methods for making light active material particulate, as well as an organic light active fiber. Still further disclosed are methods for fabricating injection and other plastic molded organic light active devices. Further still there are disclosed compositions for light active material.<br>
A polymer is made up of organic molecules bonded together. For a polymer to be electrically conductive it must act like a metal with the electrons in the bonds mobile and not bound to the atoms making up the organic molecules. A conductive polymer must have alternate single and double bonds, termed conjugated double bonds. Polyacetylene is a simple conjugated polymer. It is made by the polymerization of acetylene. In the early 1970's, a researcher named Shirakawa was studying the polymerization of acetylene. When too much catalyst was added, the mixture seemed to have a metallic appearance. But unlike metals, the resulting polyacetylene film was not an electrical conductor. In the mid-1970's this material was reacted with iodine vapor. The result was an extreme<br><br><br><br>
