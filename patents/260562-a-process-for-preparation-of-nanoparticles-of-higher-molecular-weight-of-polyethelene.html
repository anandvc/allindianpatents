				<td>FBELD OF THE INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparation of nanoparticles of higher molecular<br>
weight of polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Generally polymers are high molecular weight material. Its number average molecular weight<br>
is greater than 1,00,000 and available in granular form. The particle size is ~2 mm<br>
(minimum). Due to its high molecular weight, it was not possible to prepare polymers at nano<br>
scale.<br>
Polymer particles of different shapes and sizes are critical in numerous applications,<br>
including polymer blends or alloys, polymer powder spray coating, polymer powder<br>
impregnations of inorganic fibers in composites, and in polymer-supported heterogeneous<br>
catalysis. Recently, significant commercial and scientific attention has been focused on the<br>
multicomponent polymer system as a means for producing new materials on the nanometer<br>
scale. Composites, polymer particles or polymer alloys with specifically tailored properties<br>
can find many novel uses in such field as electro-optic and luminescent devices,<br>
thermoplastics and conducting materials, hybrid inorganic-organic polymer alloys, and<br>
polymer supported heterogeneous catalysis. These are dimensionally larger than so called<br>
atoms and yet smaller than the conventional polymer powders with most of the comprising<br>
species lying on the surface itself.<br>
The commercial polyethylene (low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene,<br>
liner low density polyethylene, ultra high molecular weight polyethylene, etc) is synthesized<br>
by the Ziegler process using aluminium trialkyl-TiCU complex as catalyst, Phillips process<br>
using CrOs as catalyst and Standard oil process using molybdenum as catalyst. The size of<br>
this commercial polyethylene is ~ 2-5 mm in diameter.<br>
The synthesis of commercial polypropylene became possible through the<br>
commercial utilization of co-ordination polymerization during 1957-60. Propylene, the<br>
monomer, is obtained from the cracking of petroleum products. The size of this commercial<br>
polypropylene is ~ 2-5 mm in diameter.<br>
Similarly the commercial polystyrene is synthesized by the bulk and suspension<br>
polymerization (and the emulsion process to a lesser extent). Similarly the size of this<br>
commercial polystyrene is ~ 2-5 mm in diameter.<br>
Regarding the synthesis of micron sized polymer (polyethylene) has been reported<br>
by Otaigbe et al. [Otaigbe JU, Noid DW, Sumpter BG (1998) Advances in Polymer Technol.<br>
17:161] through the gas atomizing technique without mentioning its molecular weight. The<br>
yield is less than 0.01% and particle sizes ranging from 25-200 um. In this technique, the<br>
polymer is melted at a high temperature and passed through an orifice into a vacuum<br>
chamber. Spherical polymer particles (10-35 nm) are prepared by the chemical<br>
polymerization of aniline in an inverse water-in-oil micro emulsion process [Chan HSO,<br>
Ming L, ChewlStrMa L, Seow SH., (1993) J Mater Chem 3:1109; Xu, XJ., Chew, CH.,<br>
Siow, KS., Wong, MK, and Gan, L.M., (1999), Langmuir, 15:8067; Anderson, CD., Sudol,<br>
ED., and El-Aasser, MS., (2002), Macromolecules, 35:574; Ries, MM., Araujo, PHH.,<br>
Sayer, C., Giudici, R., (2003), Polymer, 44:6123, Ries, MM., Araujo, PHH., Sayer, C.,<br>
Giudici, R, (2003), Polymer, 44:6123; Klein, M., US Patent 4,207,378, June 1980 and Wang,<br>
X., Foltz, VJ, Sadhukhan, P. US patent 6,689,469, February 2004]. This micro emulsion<br>
method provides a denser, more uniform and compact film of higher condensation than that<br>
produced in an aqueous medium. But the molecular weight of polymer is less than 20,000.<br>
The conventional process can be briefly summarized as follows:-<br>
 (1) Microemulsion technique<br>
(2) Cryogenic grinding<br>
Commercial polymer is available in granular form and its diameter is<br>
generally greater than 2 mm.<br>
Materials developed till date: polyethylene glycol, polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene.<br>
Size of the particles: Generally the minimum size is -300 nm and in<br>
case of polystyrene it is 40 nm. However, the molecular weight is less<br>
than 10,000 in all cases.<br>
Economic: Both are costly processes.<br>
Design of Process: These processes are too much complicated.<br>
Yield: Very low, less than 0.1% for micron sized low molecular weight<br>
polymer. (Maximum)<br>
Cost of production: Costly process<br>

Reference may be made to Fig 1 which shows a reactor comprising Feeding of ingredients (1,<br>
3, 5), Outlet of gas (environmental gas) (2), Inlet of gas (environmental gas) (4), Jacket (6)<br>
for controlling the temperature from -30 to +250°C by circulating of liquid nitrogen (below<br>
sub ambient temperature) and hot oil (above room temperature) and Magnetic stirrer (7) for<br>
controlling the shear rate in the solution. The reactor is provided with the provision to control<br>
the reaction temperatures from -30 (sub ambient) to +250°C, reaction time, different<br>
atmospheres using purge gases (nitrogen, argon, helium, carbon dioxide, oxygen, etc) and<br>
shear rates (0.2 to 200 rad/s) by magnetic stirrer.<br>
1. A process for preparation of nano sized high molecular weight polyethylene<br>
comprising the steps of-<br>
Step-1: Drying of n-Hexane<br>
-n-hexane (75 to 90 wt%) is added to calcium chloride (25 to 10 wt%) to obtain a mixture<br>
-this mixture is heated at a temperature of 10 to 50°C for 1 to 24 hours<br>
-sodium wires are added into the above mixture until evolution of hydrogen bubbles is<br>
observed<br>
- a pinch of benzophenone (-0.1 to 1 wt%) is added to the above mixture (99.9 to 99<br>
wt%) after 1 to 6 hours<br>
-this mixture is refluxed at a temperature of 75 to 200°C in an inert atmosphere, until it<br>
sustains dark blue colour<br>
-after sustaining the dark blue colour the mixture is refluxed for another 1 to 3 hour and<br>
cooled to room temperature under inert atmosphere<br>
-the mixture is distilled under inert atmosphere for the collection of dry n-hexane.<br>
Step-2: Purification and drying of toluene<br>
5 to 15 wt% of 50 to 99% sulphuric acid is added into toluene (95 to 85 wt%)<br>
-this mixture is stirred using magnetic stirrer for 1 to 12 hours followed by separation of<br>
acid from the mixture using separating funnel and remaining toluene is washed with distilled<br>
water in the separating funnel<br>
-again it is washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (1 to 10%) in the distilled<br>
water for complete removal of sulphuric acid<br>
-same procedure is followed for drying the toluene as mentioned in the case of n-hexane<br>
Step-3: Preparation of catalyst (TiCU)<br>
-dry hexane (50 to 70 wt%) and titanium tetra chloride (50 to 30 wt%) are added under<br>
inert atmosphere at a temperature of 10 to 50°C<br>
-the mixture is kept under inert atmosphere for 60 to 9000 seconds<br>
-the flask is cooled to a temperature of 25 to 10°C with a septum<br>
Step-4: Drying of diethylether:<br>
-85 to 97 wt% of diethyl ether is taken in a clean dry bottle flask which is added with 15<br>
to 3 wt% of calcium chloride to obtain a mixture<br>
-this mixture is decanted after 1 to 12 hours for removal of large percentage of water.<br>
-sodium wires are pressed into the bottle until the stoppage of evolution of hydrogen<br>
bubbles<br>
-a pinch of benzophenon (0.01 to 0.05 wt%) is added to the above mixture (99.99 to 99.95<br>
wt%) and kept for 1 to 6 hours<br>
-the mixture is refluxed until it sustains dark blue colour in the inert atmosphere<br>
-after sustaining dark blue colour the mixture is refluxed for another 2 to 4 hours at 25 to<br>
75°C and cooled under inert atmosphere to the room temperature of 25°C to obtain dry<br>
diethylether which is distilled using a distillation condenser<br>
Step-5: Preparation of methyl magnesium iodide:<br>
-The magnesium metal (96 to 99 wt%) and a pinch of Iodine (4 to 1 wt%) are mixed<br>
together.<br>
-after flashing this system (70 to 80 wt%) by nitrogen to create inert atmosphere, diethyl<br>
ether (30 to 20 wt%) as obtained above is added to obtain a reaction mixture<br>
-the required amount of methyl iodide (75 to 90 wt% with respect to magnesium) highly<br>
diluted with ether is admitted in the dropping funnel with rapid magnetic stirring which<br>
causes vigorous reaction. As a result reddish colour of mixture becomes colourless<br>
-after being colourless, the diluted iodomethane (1 to 10 wt%) is added to the reaction<br>
mixture drop wise keeping reaction bottle flask in the ice bath<br>
-after complete addition the reaction mixture is refluxed for 2 hours at a temperature of 35<br>
to 40°C<br>
- It is stored in the inert atmosphere as it is moisture sensitive and pyrophoric in nature<br>
Step-6: Preparation of trimethyl aluminium:<br>
- 91 to 98 wt% of dried diethyl ether is added into the bottle flask with rapid magnetic<br>
stirring followed by addition of anhydrous aluminium chloride (9 to 2 wt%) into the ether<br>
slowly at 0°C for preparing solution<br>
-freshly prepared Grignard reagent (70 to 85 wt% with respect to the aluminium chloride)<br>
is added drop wise to the solution with the help of cannula<br>
-after complete addition of Grignard reagent the reaction mixture is refluxed in the<br>
temperature range of 20 to 60°C for 1 to 4 hours circulating the chilled water through the<br>
condenser for completion of the reaction<br>
-this mixture has a clear solution of trimethyl aluminium etherate complex and solid<br>
material of magnesium chloride iodide at the bottom of the round bottle flask<br>
Step-7: Isolation of trimethyl aluminium:<br>
-the reaction mixture is heated at 20 to 70°C for 1 to 4 hours for removal of excess ether<br>
- vacuum of 30 mm Hg is created into the system and trimethyl aluminium is distilled out<br>
in the temperature range of 30 to 90°C using two ice traps between vacuum pump and bottle<br>
flask for complete condensation of trimethyl aluminium<br>
-trimethyl aluminium complexes with ether as etherate and a little amount of compound is<br>
found in the traps and collected with the help of syringe and needle<br>
Step-8: Polymerization of ethylene using TiCLf/fCH^Al catalyst to get nano sized high<br>
molecular weight polyethylene<br>
- 95 to 99.8 wt% of dried n-hexane is introduced into the dry and clean reactor fully<br>
charged with nitrogen gas, which is maintained at a temperature of 30 to 65°C<br>
-at this temperature a calculated amount of TiCU (0.1 to 3 wt%) and trimethyl aluminium<br>
(0.1 to 2 wt%) are charged into the reactor with the help of syringe and needle under inert<br>
atmosphere<br>
-the temperature of the system is then raised to 75 to 150°C<br>
-after stirring for 10 to 60 minutes ethylene is introduced into the reactor at the required<br>
pressure<br>
-ethylene (5 to 150 ml/min) is added for 0.5 to 2 hour maintaining the temperature in<br>
between 70-150°C and pressure of 0.1 to 2 MPa followed by passing of water through<br>
cooling coils<br>
-after polymerization methanol (5 to 25 wt%) is added to deactivate the unreacted catalyst<br>
and heated to 250°C to remove the unreacted ethylene followed by cooling at 50°C<br>
- a trace of HCL (1 to 5 wt%) is added to decompose and dissolve the catalyst<br>
-another solvent (70 to 95 wt%) is added into the mixture of 30 to 5 wt% and heated to -<br>
30 °C to 150°C to form a clear solution and cooled slowly with continuous stirring over a<br>
shear rate of 0.2 to 200 rad/s for 0.1 to 12 hours.<br>

Theory behind the formation of nano sized polymer through thermodynamics:<br>
Partial molar free energy, AG* of a polymer during formation of nanoparticles is composed of<br>
following three forces AG" = &amp;Gsp + AG, + AGe/<br>
...(1)<br>
where AG AGf and AGe/ are the contributions of solvent-polymer mixing force, polymer<br>
network elastic-retractile force and particle-sol vent interfacial tension force respectively.<br>
Partial molar free energy change by the absorption of the solvent droplets is<br>
represented by the following equation<br>
In ...(2)<br>
where 0] is the volume fraction of the solvent, 02 is the volume fraction of the polymer, J is<br>
the ratio of molar volume of polymer and solvent, x is the solvent polymer interaction<br>
parameter, y is the interfacial energy, r is the radius of the particles, and Fy is the partial<br>
molar volume of the solvent.<br>
Form Equation (2), a thermodynamics equation for the formation of particles<br>
consisting of polymer, other chemicals (if any) and mixtures is given below:<br>
where 0t is the volume fraction of the solvent, 02 is the volume fraction of the other<br>
chemicals, 0s is the volume fraction of the polymer, Ji is the ratio of molar volume of other<br>
chemicals and solvent, J3 is the ratio of molar volume of polymer and solvent, xu and %i3 are<br>
the interaction parameter of the solvent with other chemicals and polymer, respectively, and<br>
X23 is the interaction parameter of the other chemicals with the polymer.<br>
For the polymer particles system, l/j3 can be set equal to zero in Equation (3),<br>
because a polymer has limitless js value. Therefore, Equation (3) can be simplified as<br>
follows:<br>
The elastic free energy change, AGei is an entropy term associated with the change in<br>
the configuration of the polymer network, and describe as follows:<br>
where N is the effective number of chains in the network per unit volume.<br>
Consequently, the partial molar free energy, AG of the solvent in the polymer<br>
particles during formation of nano particles gives<br>
At the equilibrium state, the following thermodynamic equation can be obtained<br>
Particle radius r can be represented as follows:<br>
where r0 is the initial particle radius. F}, ¥2 and V3 are the molar volume of solvent, other<br>
solvents if any and polymer respectively.<br>
The rate of transport of solvent molecules to the polymer particles for the formation<br>
of nano sized particles can be determined as<br>
where D is the diffusion constant of solvent molecules, C is the solubility of the polymer<br>
particles, rs is the radius of the polymer particles, and Ns is the number of the particles, In<br>
Equation (9), AG can be obtained form the Equation (6). It proves that the formation of<br>
nano sized polymers is feasible through the control of thermodynamic parameters. The size<br>
of nanoparticles is analyzed through atomic force microscopy, scanning electron<br>
microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, etc.<br>
Characterization of nano sized high molecular weight polymer through atomic force<br>
microscopy:<br>
The particle size and morphology of nano sized high molecular weight polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene and polystyrene were determined by Atomic Force Microscope (AFM),<br>
Molecular Imaging, USA using acoustic AC mode, force constant of 0.6 N/m and frequency<br>
of 150 KHz. The micro graph shows that the nano sized high molecular weight polyethylene<br>
(Fig 2), polypropylene (Figs 3 and 4) and polystyrene (Fig 5) are spherical in nature. The<br>
particle size for polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene is within the range of 10 to 130,<br>
25 to 100 and 20 to 40 nm respectively. The particle size distribution of high molecular<br>
weight polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene is shown in Figs 6, 7 and 8 respectively.<br>
Characterization of nano sized high molecular weight polymer through transmission<br>
electron microscopy:<br>
The nanopolymers were dispersed in a solvent and a drop of this solution was sprayed on the<br>
carbon-coated grid with the help of some suitable dropper or syringe. The TEM micrographs<br>
were taken with JEOL JEM 2000FX Transmission Electron Microscope, at a voltage of<br>
120 kVA and at different magnifications. The micro graph shows that the nano sized high<br>
molecular weight polyethylene (Fig 9) and polypropylene (Fig 10) are spherical in nature.<br>
Particle size varies within the range of 10 to 130, and 25 to 100 nm for polyethylene and<br>
polypropylene respectively.<br>
Characterization of nano sized high molecular weight polymer through scanning<br>
electron microscopy:<br>
The particle size and morphology of nano sized high molecular weight polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene and polystyrene were also determined by a JEOL JSM 840A Scanning<br>
Electron Microscope (SEM). The micro graph (Fig 11) shows that the nano sized high<br>
molecular weight polypropylene is spherical in nature. To avoid the thermal degradation of<br>
polymer the photograph is taken at an accelerating voltage of 15-20 kV. The particle size of<br>
high molecular weight polypropylene is within the range of 25 to 100 nm.<br>
Characterization of nano sized high molecular weight polymer through infrared<br>
spectrosc<br>
The infrared spectrum of commercial high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene<br>
and nano sized high molecular weight polyethylene was studied by "BRUKER VECTOR 22"<br>
infrared spectrometer to find out the difference in chemical structure between these polymers.<br>
Fig 12 shows the IR spectra of commercial high density polyethylene. The peak positions at<br>
2800-2950 cm"1 (broad peak), 1466 cm"1 (strong peak), 1365 cm"1 (strong peak) and 724 cm"1<br>
(strong peak) are assigned to the -C-H stretching, -C-H vibration, -C-H symmetric vibration<br>
and -C-H rocking respectively. The other two peaks 730 and 720 cm"1 (strong) is<br>
orthorhombic crystalline structure of commercial high density polyethylene. The 723 cm"1<br>
peak position is associated with the amorphous fraction of commercial high density<br>
polyethylene. But the 717 cm"1 is assigned to the monoclinic crystalline structure of<br>
commercial high density polyethylene. The JR. spectra of commercial low density<br>
polyethylene is also included in the same Fig 12 for the comparison purpose. The peak at<br>
1462 cm"1 is assigned to the bending vibration in all trans methylene chain sequence outside<br>
the crystal structure. The 723 cm"1 is assigned to the -Cfk rocking mode. The IR spectra of<br>
nano sized high molecular weight polyethylene is also included in the same Fig 12. There is<br>
no difference in chemical structure between the commercial high density polyethylene, low<br>
density polyethylene and nano sized high molecular weight polyethylene. From this<br>
observation it is found that both are same materials. But the size of the particle for high<br>
molecular polyethylene is in nano scale, i.e., within the range of 10 to 130 nm.<br>
Again the infrared spectra of crystalline polymers are complex due to the regular<br>
structure of the macromolecules. To simplify it, all spectra are classified into the four groups<br>
related to the various molecular structures: conformational band, stereoregularity band,<br>
regularity band and crystallinity band. Some absorption bands are very sensitive to the<br>
physical state of the samples. According to different origins, these sensitive bands are<br>
classified into two categories. One of these bands is related to the intramolecular forces in the<br>
crystal lattice, where the polymer molecules pack together on a regular three dimensional<br>
arrangement. This type of band is known as crystallinity band. The other type of band is<br>
related with the intramolecular vibration coupling with in a single chain and known as<br>
regularity band or helix band. The conformational band and regularity band are easily<br>
observed for crystallized polypropylene in the mid-infrared region. Fig 13 shows the IR<br>
spectra of high molecular weight nano sized polypropylene. The positions of all these bands<br>
i.e., 1370, 1301, 1254, 1219, 1161, 1103, 994, 975, 899, 840 and 810 cm"1 belong to the<br>
regularity bands. These bands are associated with the different helical length of repeat unit<br>
 (n). The minimum n values for appearance of these bands at 975, 994, 840 and 1219 cm"1 are<br>
5, 10, 12 and 14 monomer units in helical sequence respectively. The higher is the common<br>
unit, the more is the order degree of the corresponding regularity band. Concerning the 975<br>
cm"1 band, it is not only attributed to the polypropylene head to tail sequence of repeating<br>
units, but also associated with the presence of short helices. On the other hand the band at<br>
1453 cm"1 is assigned to the asymmetric deformation vibration of the methyl group. The IR<br>
spectrum of commercial polypropylene is also included in the same Fig 13. There is no<br>
difference in chemical structure between the commercial polypropylene and nano sized high<br>
molecular weight polypropylene.<br>
Fig 14 shows the IR spectra of commercial polystyrene. The peak positions at 3027,<br>
2885, 1492, 1370 and 757 cm"1 are assigned to the stretching of-C-H bond in phenyl ring,<br>
asymmetric stretching of -C-H bond, asymmetric stretching of -C-H bond, symmetric<br>
stretching of-C-H bond and rocking of-C-H bond in phenyl ring respectively. The other two<br>
peaks 901 and 851 cm"1 are associated to the a crystal form of commercial polystyrene.<br>
Another two peaks 911 and 855 cm"1 are assigned to the P crystal form of commercial<br>
polystyrene. The IR spectra of nano sized high molecular weight polystyrene is also included<br>
in the same Fig 14. There is no difference in chemical structure between the commercial<br>
polystyrene and nano sized high molecular weight polystyrene.<br>
Characterization of nano sized high molecular weight polymer through X-Ray<br>
Diffraction<br>
The XRD measurement was conducted in order to examine the crystallinity of commercial<br>
high density polyethylene, commercial low density polyethylene and nano sized high<br>
molecular weight polyethylene. It was evaluated by X- Ray Diffraction (XRD) using Rich<br>
Seifert Iso-Debyefle 202 Diffractometer with a CuKa (X,= 1.54184 A) radiation. Two major<br>
peaks i.e., 22 and 24° are identified in X-ray diffraction studies for both polymers and shown<br>
in Fig 15. The area under these peak decreases from the nano sized high molecular weight<br>
polyethylene to commercial high density polyethylene and low density polyethylene. This<br>
suggests that the nano sized high molecular weight polyethylene is more crystalline in nature.<br>
The XRD measurement was also conducted in order to examine the crystallinity of<br>
the commercial polypropylene and nano sized high molecular weight polypropylene. It is<br>
well known that the commercial polypropylene exhibits several different crystalline forms.<br>
These are monoclinic (a) form (including <xi and c trigonal triclinic form></xi>
mesomorphic (smectic) form. The formation and their mutual phase transitions consist of a<br>
number of intermediate stages based on the rotations and transitions of chains. It is again<br>
dependent on the crystallization conditions, molecular weight and tacticity of the polymer<br>
chain. Three main peaks for the commercial polypropylene (16.7, 18.5 and 21.1) and nano<br>
sized high molecular weight polypropylene (16.8, 18.6 and 21.8) are identified for<br>
comparison of crystallinity and shown in Fig 16. It shows that the nano sized high molecular<br>
weight polymer is more crystalline in nature.<br>
Similarly the XRD measurement was also conducted in order to examine the<br>
crystallinity of the commercial polystyrene (if any) and high molecular weight nano sized<br>
polystyrene. Commercial polystyrene has four types of crystal form (a, P, y and 8) and two<br>
mesomorfic forms. It has been reported that the a- and P- forms have trans planar zigzag<br>
(tttt)n backbone configuration, where as y- and 8- forms have a helical (trans, trans, gauche,<br>
gauche, (ttg+g\) backbone configuration. The a- form with a hexagonal unit cell and P- form<br>
with an orthorhombic unit cell have an identity of c equal to 5.1 A. The y- and 8- forms (both<br>
having an identity of c = 7.8 A) are monoclinic crystal structure. Among these four<br>
crystalline forms, the a- form (with a = 26.26 A) and P- form (with a = 8.81 A, b = 28.82 A)<br>
are crystalline polymorphs. Few peaks for the commercial polystyrene (14.0, 16.7, 17.9, 18.4<br>
and 19.7) and nano sized high molecular weight polystyrene (14.0, 16.7, 18.2, 18.5 and 19.5)<br>
are identified for comparison of crystallinity and shown in Fig 17. It also suggests that the<br>
nano sized high molecular weight polystyrene is more crystalline with respect to the<br>
commercial polystyrene.<br>
Characterization of nano sized high molecular weight polymer through molecular<br>
weight<br>
Viscosity at very low concentration is measured for commercial polystyrene (Fig 18) and<br>
nano polystyrene (Fig 19). Molecular weight is calculated using Mark-Howink equation,<br>
which is<br>
...(10)<br>
where k = 3.7x1 0"3 dL/gm and a = 0.62<br>
For commercial polystyrene its viscosity average molecular weight is -0.97 X106<br>
whereas for nano polystyrene it is ~ 0.98 X106. From the measurement of viscosity average<br>
molecular weight it is concluded that the nano sized polystyrene is a high molecular weight<br>
material which is equal to the commercial polystyrene. But the size of polymer is in nano<br>
scale.<br>
Examples<br>
(1) Preparation of nano sized high molecular weight polyethylene<br>
Drying of n-Hexane<br>
670 gm of HPLC grade n-hexane was introduced in a single necked, two liter round bottle<br>
flask. 100 gm of calcium chloride was added into it. This mixture was allowed to keep for 12<br>
hours followed by decantation. Large percentage of water was removed during this period.<br>
Sodium wires were pressed into the round bottle flask containing n-hexane, continuing the<br>
addition of the sodium wires until evolution of hydrogen bubbles was observed. After 3 hours<br>
a pinch of benzophenone (-0.1 gm) was added to the above round bottle flask (n-hexane and<br>
sodium wires). This was refluxed at a temperature of 110 to 120°C in an inert atmosphere,<br>
until it sustains dark blue colour. After sustaining the dark blue colour the mixture was<br>
refluxed for another 1 hour and was cooled to room temperature under inert atmosphere.<br>
Finally it was distilled under inert atmosphere and the dried n-hexane was collected in<br>
another round bottle flask.<br>
Purification and drying of toluene:<br>
The main impurity in HPLC grade toluene was sulfur. It was removed by treating toluene<br>
with sulphuric acid. 430 gm of HPLC grade toluene was taken in a clean, single necked, one<br>
liter round bottle flask. 37 gm of 99% sulphuric acid was added to it. This mixture was kept<br>
for 12 hours with rapid stirring using a magnetic stirrer. Neck of the round bottle flask was<br>
closed with guard tube containing calcium chloride. After stirring, acid was separated using<br>
separating funnel from the mixture. Remaining toluene was washed with distilled water in the<br>
separating funnel. Again it was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution (10%) in<br>
the distilled water for complete removal of sulphuric acid. Same procedure was followed for<br>
drying toluene as mentioned in the case of n-hexane.<br>
Preparation of catalyst (TiCl4):<br>
A 50 ml round bottle flask was purged with moisture and oxygen free nitrogen gas. A<br>
calculated amount of dry hexane (5 gm) and titanium tetra chloride (3 gm) were added under<br>
inert atmosphere at room temperature. The mixture was kept under inert atmosphere at room<br>
temperature of 25°C for few minutes. Then the flask was cooled with a septum. Catalyst<br>
activity usually changes with time and the maximum activity was often reached only after<br>
ageing periods of one to two hours.<br>
Drying of diethyl ether:<br>
357 gm of diethyl ether was taken in a clean dry single neck one liter round bottle flask and<br>
15 gm of calcium chloride was added into it. This mixture was allowed to keep for 12 hours<br>
followed by decantataion. Large percentage of water was removed during this process.<br>
Sodium wires were pressed into the round bottle until the evolution of hydrogen bubbled<br>
could be stopped. A pinch of benzophenon (0.1 gm) was added and kept for three hours. It<br>
was refluxed until it sustains dark blue colour in the inert atmosphere. After sustaining dark<br>
blue colour the mixture was refluxed for another two hours at 45°C and cooled under inert<br>
atmosphere to the room temperature of 25°C. And then finally dried diethyl ether was<br>
distilled in one liter round bottle flask using a condenser.<br>
Preparation of methyl magnesium iodide:<br>
The preparation of Grignard reagent was conducted in a clean dry one liter three necked<br>
round bottle flask assembled with condenser, dropping funnel and take off tube with stop<br>
cork. The theoretical amount of magnesium metal (-10 gm) and a pinch of Iodine were<br>
placed in the three necked round bottle flask. After flashing this system by nitrogen to create<br>
inert atmosphere diethyl ether was added through cannula. The required amount of methyl<br>
iodide (-58.4 gm) highly diluted with ether was placed in the dropping funnel with rapid<br>
magnetic stirring. Reaction started very vigorously, reddish colour of mixture changed very<br>
fast and became colourless. After being colourless, the diluted iodomethane was added to the<br>
reaction mixture drop wise keeping reaction round bottle flask in the ice bath. Because, the<br>
reaction is highly exothermic, after complete addition the reaction mixture was refluxed for 2<br>
hours at a temperature of 35 to 40°C. The Grignard reagent was prepared with almost 100<br>
f<br>
percent yield. Since it is moisture sensitive and pyrophoric in nature, it was stored in the inert<br>
atmosphere.<br>
Preparation of trimethyl aluminium:<br>
The reaction of trimethyl aluminium with a Grignard reagent was performed in a threenecked<br>
round bottle flask equipped with a condenser, dropping funnel and take off tube with<br>
stop cork, which supplies dry nitrogen continuously to the system. 285.6 gm of perfectly<br>
dried diethyl ether was added into the round bottle flask with rapid magnetic stirring and<br>
anhydrous aluminium chloride (10 gm) was added into the ether slowly at 0°C for making<br>
solution. Freshly prepared Grignard reagent was added drop wise to the solution with the help<br>
of cannula. After complete addition of Grignard reagent the reaction mixture was refluxed at<br>
a temperature of 30 to 40°C for 2 hours circulating the chilled water through the condenser<br>
for completion of the reaction. This mixture has a clear solution of trimethyl aluminium<br>
etherate complex and ^ solid material of magnesium chloride iodide at the bottom of round<br>
bottle flask.<br>
Isolation of trimethyl aluminium:<br>
A distillation condenser was fitted into the above round bottle flask carefully, ensuring that<br>
the whole system was in the nitrogen atmosphere. The reaction mixture was heated at 40 to<br>
50°C for three hours for removal of excess ether. Vacuum of 30 mm Hg was created into the<br>
system, Trimethyl aluminium was distilled out in a single necked 100 ml round bottle flask at<br>
a temperature of 60 to 70°C using two ice traps between vacuum pump and round bottle flask<br>
for complete condensation of trimethyl aluminium.<br>
Polymerization of ethylene using TiCU/CCHa^Al catalyst to get nano sized high<br>
molecular weight polyethylene<br>
670 gm of dried n-hexane was introduced into the completely dry and clean two liter reactor<br>
fully charged with nitrogen gas. The temperature was increased to 45°C. At this temperature a<br>
calculated amount of TiCl4 (~5 gm) and trimethyl aluminium (-1.6 gm) were charged into the<br>
reactor with the help of syringe and needle under inert atmosphere. The temperature of the<br>
system was then raised to 100°C. After stirring for 30 minutes ethylene was introduced into<br>
the reactor at the required pressure. Ethylene was added for one hour maintaining the<br>
temperature of 90-100°C and pressure of 0.1 to 2 MPa. Water was allowed to pass through<br>
the cooling coils. After polymerization methanol was added to deactivate the unreacted<br>
catalyst and heated to 170°C to remove the unreacted ethylene. Then it was cooled to 50°C.<br>
After that a trace of HCL was added to decompose and dissolve the catalyst. Xylene was<br>
added into the mixture and heated to 100°C to form a clear solution and cooled slowly with<br>
continuous stirring over a shear rate of 0.2 to 200 rad/s for 0.1 to 12 hours. Nano sized<br>
polyethylene was separated by filtration and dried under reduced pressure of 30 mm Hg.<br>
(2) Preparation of nano sized high molecular weight polypropylene<br>
The procedure for the step of (1) drying on n-hexane, (2) purification and drying of toluene,<br>
(3) preparation of catalyst, TiCU, (4) synthesis of trimethyl aluminium, (5) isolation of<br>
trimethyl aluminium, (6) drying of diethyl ether and (7) preparation of methyl magnesium<br>
chloride are already described in the section of "preparation of nano sized high molecular<br>
weight polyethylene". Same procedure is also adopted here. Next step is the preparation of<br>
nano sized high molecular weight polypropylene.<br>
Polymerization of propylene using TiCLi/CCH^Al catalyst to get nano sized high<br>
molecular weight polypropylene<br>
670 gm of dried n-hexane was introduced into the completely dry and clean two liter reactor<br>
fully charged with nitrogen gas. The temperature was increased to 45°C. At this temperature a<br>
calculated amount of TiCU (~5 gm) and trimethyl aluminium (-1.6 gm) were charged into the<br>
reactor with the help of syringe and needle under inert atmosphere. The temperature of the<br>
system was then raised to 70°C. After stirring for 30 minutes propylene and hydrogen (here<br>
hydrogen acts as a chain terminating agent) were introduced into the reactor at the required<br>
pressure. Propylene was added for 12 hours maintaining the temperature of 70-90°C and<br>
pressure of 0.1 to 2 MPa. Water was allowed to pass through the cooling coils. After<br>
polymerization methanol was added to deactivate the unreacted catalyst and heated to 170°C<br>
to remove the unreacted propylene. Then it was cooled to 50°C. After that a trace of HCL<br>
was added to decompose and dissolve the catalyst. Xylene was added into the mixture and<br>
heated to 100°C to form a clear solution and cooled slowly with continuous stirring over a<br>
shear rate of 0.2 to 200 rad/s for 0.1 to 12 hours. Nano sized polypropylene is separated by<br>
filtration and dried under reduced pressure of 30 mm Hg.<br>
(3) Preparation of nano sized high molecular weight polystyrene<br>
435 gm of benzene was introduced into the completely dry and clean two liter reactor fully<br>
charged with nitrogen gas. The temperature was increased to 45°C. At this temperature a<br>
calculated amount of Aids (~2 gm) was charged into the reactor under inert atmosphere. The<br>
temperature of the system was then raised to 90°C. After stirring for 30 minutes ethylene was<br>
introduced into the reactor at the required pressure. Ethylene was added for 3 hours<br>
maintaining the temperature of 90-100°C and pressure of 0.1 to 2 MPa. Water was allowed to<br>
pass through the cooling coils. After two hours a calculated amount of magnesium oxide (~1<br>
gm) was added and heated the mixture to a temperature of 600°C. After one hour the mixture<br>
was cooled to a temperature of 50°C. The styrene was separated by distillation. Pure styrene<br>
and a pinch of catalyst, ~0.5gm (hydrogen peroxide, 99.9% purity) were heated at a<br>
temperature of 120°C in a reactor. The reactor was fitted with heating and cooling jackets to<br>
control the temperature. The melt containing polystyrene and traces of styrene was heated at<br>
a temperature of 150°C to remove styrene monomer. The mixture was cooled to the<br>
temperature of 50°C. Dimethylsiloxane was added into the mixture and heated to 100°C to<br>
form a clear solution and cooled slowly with continuous stirring over a shear rate of 0.2 to<br>
200 rad/s for 0.1 to 12 hours. Nano sized polystyrene was separated by filtration and dried<br>
under reduced pressure of 30 mm Hg.<br>
