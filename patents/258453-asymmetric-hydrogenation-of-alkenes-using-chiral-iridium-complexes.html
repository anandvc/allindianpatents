				<td>ASYMMETRIC HYDROGENATION OF ALKENES USING CHIRAL IRIDIUM COMPLEXES<br>
The present invention relates to the (stereoselective) hydrogenation of a compound of the formula II with at least one carbon-carbon double bond, especially to the (stereoselective) hydrogenation of isoprenoids, non-cyclic sesquiterpenes, tocomonoenols, tocodienols, tocotrienols or any derivatives thereof, as well as to the (stereoselective) hydrogenation of parts/extracts of plant oils containing such tocotrienols or derivatives thereof, in the presence of a chiral Ir complex as the catalyst, whereby preferably one stereoisomer is manufactured in an excess.<br>
In the prior art there exists no general method for the asymmetric hydrogenation of trisubstituted olefins bearing no functional group in near proximity, that means olefins in which the carbon atoms of the olefinic double bond are spaced from the functional group(s) by two or more CH2-groups could not be stereoselective hydrogenated so far. A "functional group" is understood as a group consisting of an aromatic residue or groups containing heteroatoms like O, N, S, P or similar. Examples of corresponding compounds which are useful for the synthesis of optically active tocopherols (vitamin E) are tocotrienols, unsaturated isoprenoids like geranylacetone or farnesene acid alkyl esters. Therefore, there is a need to provide catalysts for such stereoselective hydrogenation.<br>
Surprisingly it was found that chiral Ir complexes, especially those containing P-N ligand systems, are suitable for that purpose. Such catalysts were until now only known for the stereoselective hydrogenation of aromatic compounds (see A. Pfaltz et al., Adv. Synth. Catal. 2003, 345 (1 + 2), 33-43; F. Menges, A. Pfaltz, Adv. Synth. Catal. 2002, 344 (1), 40-44; J. Blankenstein, A. Pfaltz, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. 2001,40 (23), 4445-4447; A. Pfaltz, Chimia2004, 58 (1 + 2), 49-50).<br>
Thus, one aspect of the invention refers to a process for the manufacture of at least one compound of the formula I<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein the position labelled with the asterisk is an asymmetry center and<br>
R1 is selected from the group consisting of linear C1-3~alkyl, C5-7-cycloalkyl, hydroxyl, hydroxyallcyl (alkyl = C1-4-alkyl), oxoalkyl (alkyl = C1-4-alkyl), alkylcarbonyl (alkyl = alkyl), alkoxycarbonyl (alkoxy = linear C1-4-alkoxy) and a group of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
with R2 being a hydroxyl group or a protected hydroxyl group, and R3 and R4 being independently from each other hydrogen or methyl, and n being an integer from 1 to 10, preferably from 1 to 3,<br>
comprising the step of<br>
hydrogenating a compound of the formula II<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein at least one carbon-carbon double bond is present, and wherein the dotted lines represent the possible positions of such (facultative) carbon-carbon double bonds; and R1 and n are as above,<br>
in the presence of a chiral Ir complex as the catalyst.<br>
Preferably in such process one stereoisomer of the compound I is manufactured in excess. If a compound of formula n with only one prochiral center is used preferably one enantiomer is manufactured in excess. The stereoselectivity of the hydrogenation can be controlled by appropriate choive of the catalyst.<br>
Starting material<br>
Examples of the compounds of the formula II are those presented in Fig. 4:<br>
Hal = (E)-Dihydrogeranylacetone, IIa2 = (Z)-dihydronerylacetone, IIa3 = (E)-geranylacetone, IIa4 - (Z)-nerylacetone, IIb = (all-E)-farnesol; IIc = (all-E)-farnesene acid ethyl ester, (S)-XII = (2S,3'E,7'E)-tocotrienol and derivatives thereof, (R)-XII = (2R,3'E,7'E)-tocotrienoi and derivatives thereof, (S)-XIII = (2S,3'E,7'E)-tocomono- and -dienols with the dotted lines indicating the possible positions of the one or two double bond(s), (R)-XIII = (2R,3'E,7'E)-tocomono- and -dienols with the dotted lines indicating the possible positions of the one or two double bond(s).<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Preferably the compound of the formula n is an isoprenoid, a non-cyclic sesquiterpene, a tocomonoenol, a tocodieno] or a tocotrienol.<br>
An isoprenoid is an oligo(isoprene) or a poly(isoprene) and derivatives thereof which contain at least one carbon-carbon double bond. Preferably the carbon-carbon double bond has the E configuration.<br>
The tocomonoenol, the tocodienol and/or the tocotrienol is of the formula XIII,<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
wherein the dotted bonds are optional and at least one of the dotted bonds is present,<br>
and wherein R2 is a hydroxyl group or a protected hydroxyl group and R3 and R4 are independently from each other hydrogen or methyl.<br>
Compound XBI thus encompasses (3'E)-tocomonoenols, (7'E)-tocomonoenols, (11 ')-tocomonoenols, (3'E,7'E)-tocodienols, (3'E,ll')-tocodienols, (7'E,ir&gt;tocodienols, as well as (3'E,7'E)-tocotrienols.<br>
Concerning the substituent R2 in formulae L II and XIII<br>
R2 is a hydroxyl group or a protected hydroxyl group. The hydroxyl group can be protected as ether, ester, or acetal.<br>
Examples of ethers and acetals are the methylether, the methoxyrnethylether, the<br>
methoxyethylether and the tetrahydropyranyl ether, as well as compounds where R is ethoxyethyl or methoxyethoxyethyl.<br>
Examples of esters are the acetic acid ester and esters with other carbonic acids such as formic acid ester, succinic acid monoester (or derivatives), propionic acid ester, benzoic acid ester and palmitic acid ester.<br>
Preferably R2 is a protected hydroxyl group, whereby the hydroxyl group is protected as ether or ester, more preferably as ester, especially preferably R2 is acetyloxy.<br>
In another aspect the present invention is also concerned with a process for the manufacture of a hydrogenated part or extract of a plant oil, preferably of palm oil, comprising the step of hydrogenating the part or extract of the plant oil comprising at least a tocotrienol or derivative thereof in the presence of a chiral IR complex as the catalyst. That means in the present invention such "a part or extract of the plant oil comprising at least a tocotrienol or derivative thereof is also encompassed by the term "compound of the formula n with at least one carbon-carbon double bond".<br>
The expression "part of a plant oil" encompasses any untreated or treated part of the plant oil, any concentrated part as well as the whole plant oil itself, "treated" means chemically treated such as distilled or extracted or thermally treated.<br>
Preferably the edible plant oil is treated in such a way that a part is obtained where the tocotrienols originally contained in the edible plant oil are enriched ("concentrate"). This part of the edible plant oil can be per se not edible.<br>
Examples of plant oils are any edible plant oils known to the person skilled in the art. Especially preferred is palm oil which contains beside small amounts of a- and γ-tocopherol large amounts of tocotrienols.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention the tocotrienol or the derivative thereof is hydrogenated to a tocopherol (derivative), preferably to a highly stereoisomerically enriched (all-R)-tocopherol (derivative).<br>

General remarks<br>
All starting materials were prepared by DSM Nutritional Products, Lalden/Sisseln, Switzerland: (E)-Geranylacetone, 99.2% (GC); (Z)-nerylacetone, 97.6% (GC); (E)-dihydrogeranylacetone, 99.2% (GC); (Z)-dihydronerylacetone, 98.9% (GC); (all-E)-farnesol, 97.7% (GC); (2E,6E)-farnesene acid ethyl ester, 99.0% (GC); (2E.6Z)- farnesene acid ethyl ester, 78.2% (GC), contains 1.4% of the (6E) isomer and 17.6% of another not known isomer (GC-MS); (R,E,E)-alpha-tocotrienol acetate, ca. 99%; (S,E,E)-alpha-tocotrienyl acetate, ca. 99%; (R,E,E)-gamma-tocotrienyl acetate (prepared by total synthesis) 99.7% (HPLC); (S,E,E)-gamma-tocotrienyl acetate (prepared by total synthesis), 99.8% (HPLC). Reference compounds: (all-rac)-alpha-Tocopherol, 99.6% (GC); (all-rac)-alpha-tocopheryl acetate, 97.7% (GC); (all-rac)-alpha-tocopheryl methyl ether, 97.8% (GC); (all-rac)-gamma-tocopherol, 96.8% (GC); (R,R,R)-gamma-tocopheryl acetate, ca. 99% (GC); (all-rac)-gamma-tocopheryl methyl ether, 97.9% (GC).<br>
If not stated otherwise, the GC analyses were performed with an Agilent 6890 GC FID on a CP-Sil-88 (Chrompack, Netherlands) 50m x 0.25mm column. The carrier gas was hydrogen with 90 kPa. The samples were injected as 0.3% solutions in dichloromethane<br>
with a split ratio of 1/30. The injector was held at 250°C whereas the oven temperature was programmed from 110-200°C at 0.5°C/min, the detector was at 250°C.<br>
In case of complete conversion a derivative of the hydrogenated product was prepared to determine the distribution of the stereoisomers.<br>
Hydrogenated ketones or aldehydes e.g. were reacted with L- or D -trimethylsilyl diisopropyltartrat (shortly "L-3", or "D-3") in the presence of trimethylsilyl triflate [Si(CH3)3(OSO2CF3)] to the diastereomeric ketals and acetals, respectively. With the aid of achiral gas chromatography the ratio of the diastereomers could be determined and thus the selectivity of the stereoselective hydrogenation determined indirectly. (See also A. Knierzinger, W, Walther, B. Weber, T. Netscher, Chimia 1989, 43,163-164; A. Knierzinger, W. Walther, B. Weber, R. K. Milller, T. Netscher, Helvetica Chimica Acta 1990,73,1087-1107)<br>
For the determination of the ratio of the diastereoisomers of the prepared tocopheryl acetates these were first reduced to the corresponding tocopherols with LiAlH4 and then reacted with dimethyl sulphate to the tocopheryl methyl ethers. There were obtained four diastereoisomers. Their ratio was determined via achiral gas chromatography. (See also W. Walther, T. Netscher, Chiraliry 1996, 8, 397-401.)<br>
The stereoisomeric composition of tocopherols (methyl ether derivatives) was also checked by chiral HPLC (Chiracel OD, 250 x 4.6 mm, solvent n-hexane, detection at 220 nm) in the case of the 2-(R)-isomers.<br>
If examples were carried out at "room temperature", this indicates that the reaction was carried out at a temperature of from about 20°C to about 30°C.<br>
Procedure 1<br>
In an autoclave 0.25 mmol of the substrate, 1 mol-% of the Ir complex and 1.25 ml of absolute dichloromethane were put. The autoclave was closed and a pressure of 50 bar of hydrogen was applied. Under stirring the reaction solution was kept at room temperature for two hours. Afterwards the pressure was released and the solvent removed. For determining the conversion the raw product was analysed by GC without any further purification. If the reaction was complete, the product was converted into a derivative which enabled the determination of the stereoisomeric composition as illustrated further below in more detail, e.g., by converting a ketone to the (+)-L-diisopropyltartrate acetal and the (-)-D-diisopropyltartrate acetal, respectively.<br>
