The following specification describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
ENDOXIFEN METHODS AND COMPOSITIONS<br>
This application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Applications Serial No. 60/860,420, filed November 21, 2006, and 60/860,788, filed November 22, 2006, both of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the use of endoxifen in the treatment of mammalian diseases. The invention also relates to liposomes and other formulations such as complexes, vesicles,<br>
         emulsions, micelles and mixed micelles of endoxifen, methods of preparation, and uses, e.g., in the treatment of human and animal breast diseases. The invention in particular relates to compositions comprising endoxifen-lipid complexes, methods of preparation, and their use for the treatment of breast diseases, in particular benign and malignant breast disease, enhancing disease regression and reducing risk of patients developing breast cancer. The invention further<br>
         relates to methods of preparing endoxifen and use of endoxifen prepared by inventive method in the treatment of human and animal diseases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
         Every year more than 210, 000 women in the United States develop breast cancer. One in eight women in the US will develop breast cancer during their lives. Approximately 70 percent of breast cancers are fueled by estrogen, and many are treated with Tamoxifen, a drug designed to block the effects of estrogen in breast tissue.<br>
          Tamoxifen is an anti-estrogenic drug prescribed for long-term, low dose therapy of breast<br>
cancer. It has been widely used for more than 30 years for the endocrine treatment of all stages of hormone receptor-positive breast cancer (1-2). Tamoxifen has also been approved for the prevention of breast cancer (3). In women, one of the adverse events associated with Tamoxifen is hot flashes. The risk of hot flashes is two to three-folds higher among women who take<br>
         Tamoxifen than it is for those who do not (4). Selective serotonin-reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) antidepressants are prescribed to treat hot flashes. However, some SSRIs, such as paroxetine and fluoxetine, are known to inhibit cytochrome P450 (CYP) 2D6 (5), an enzyme that is important for the metabolism of many drugs, including Tamoxifen. Our understanding of Tamoxifen metabolism and effect has changed clinical practice through the wide spread<br><br><br>
recognition that the co-prescription of drugs that inhibit CYP2D6 may compromise Tamoxifen efficacy. It is known that co-administration of paroxetine decreases the plasma concentration of an active metabolite of Tamoxifen, 4-hydroxy-N-desmethyl-Tamoxifen (endoxifen).<br>
      Endoxifen is generated via CYP3A4-mediated N-demethylation and CYP2D6 mediated<br>
hydroxylation of Tamoxifen (see, e.g., Figure 3). Any drug that can be substrate of CYP3A4 or CYP2D6, especially CYP2D6 e.g., SSRIs, can decrease the level of endoxifen (6) and thus reduce the therapeutic benefits of Tamoxifen. Therefore, to avoid such drug-drug interactions, one should not give them together.<br>
         Recently, endoxifen has been shown to be anti-estrogenic in breast cancer cells and to be more potent than Tamoxifen (7). In patients treated with Tamoxifen, endoxifen is present in higher concentration (12.4 ng/mL) than 4-OH-tamoxifen (1 ng/mL) in the human plasma. The majority of genes affected by endoxifen are estrogen-regulated genes (8 -9). Use of endoxifen e.g., in place of Tamoxifen, avoids several metabolic steps that rely on CYP2D6.<br><br>
A strong need exists for methods to treat and to prevent breast diseases without significant adverse systemic side effects, particularly in the premenoposal population. In particular, there is a need for breast cancer treatments and preventatives that having reduced interactive effect with other medications.<br><br>

The administration may be in one or more       administrations, applications or dosages and is not intended to be limited to a particular<br>
formulation or administration route. The term is not limited to any particular level of activity.<br>
The terms "agent" and "compound" are used herein interchangeably to refer to any atom, molecule, mixture, or more complex composition having an attributed feature. For example, an   "active agent" or "active compound" refers to any atom, molecule, preparation, mixture, etc., that, upon administration or application, causes a beneficial, desired, or expected result.<br><br><br>
As used herein, the term "treating" includes administering therapy to prevent, cure, or alleviate/prevent the symptoms associated with, a specific disorder, disease, injury or condition. As used herein, the term "treatment" or grammatical equivalents encompasses the improvement and/or reversal of the symptoms of disease (e.g., cancer), or reduction of risk of occurrence of       disease. A compound which causes an improvement in any parameter associated with disease when used in the screening methods of the instant invention may thereby be identified as a therapeutic compound. The term "treatment" refers to both therapeutic treatment and prophylactic or preventative measures. For example, those who may benefit from treatment with compositions and methods of the present invention include those already with a disease       and/or disorder (e.g., cancer, or symptoms or pathologies consistent with cancer) as well as those in which a disease and/or disorder is to be prevented (e.g., using a prophylactic treatment of the present invention).<br>
As used herein, the term "at risk for disease" refers to a subject (e.g., a human) that is       predisposed to experiencing a particular disease. This predisposition may be genetic (e.g., a particular genetic tendency to experience the disease, such as heritable disorders), or due to other factors (e.g., age, weight, environmental conditions, exposures to detrimental compounds present in the environment, etc.). Thus, it is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular risk, nor is it intended that the present invention be limited to any particular 20     disease.<br>
As used herein, the term "suffering from disease" refers to a subject (e.g., a human) that is experiencing a particular disease. It is not intended that the present invention be limited to any particular signs or symptoms, nor disease. Thus, it is intended that the present invention       encompasses subjects that are experiencing any range of disease (e.g., from sub-clinical<br>
manifestation to full-blown disease) wherein the subject exhibits at least some of the indicia (e.g., signs and symptoms) associated with the particular disease.<br>
As used herein, the terms "disease" and "pathological condition" are used interchangeably to       describe a state, signs, and/or symptoms that are associated with any impairment of the normal state of a living animal or of any of its organs or tissues that interrupts or modifies the performance of normal functions, and may be a response to environmental factors (such as emotional trauma, physical trauma, malnutrition, industrial hazards, or climate), to specific infective agents (such as worms, bacteria, or viruses), to inherent defect of the organism (such as   various genetic anomalies, or to combinations of these and other factors.<br><br><br>
As used herein, the term "administration" refers to the act of giving a drug, prodrug, or other active agent, or therapeutic treatment (e.g., compositions of the present invention) to a physiological system (e.g., a subject or in vivo, in vitro, or ex vivo cells, tissues, and organs). Exemplary routes of administration to the human body can be through the eyes (ophthalmic), 5     mouth (oral), skin (transdermal), nose (nasal), lungs (inhalant), rectal, vaginal, oral mucosa (buccal), ear, by injection (e.g., intravenously, subcutaneously, intratumorally, intraperitoneally, etc.) and the like. Administration may be in one or more administrations, applications or dosages, and is not intended to be limited to a particular administration route.<br>
         As used herein, the term "co-administration" refers to the administration of at least two agent(s) (e.g., two separate lipid compositions, containing different active compounds) or therapies to a subject. In some embodiments, the co-administration of two or more agents or therapies is concurrent. In other embodiments, a first agent/therapy is administered prior to a second agent/therapy. Those of skill in the art understand that the formulations and/or routes of<br>
         administration of the various agents or therapies used may vary. The appropriate dosage for coadministration can be readily determined by one skilled in the art. In some embodiments, when agents or therapies are co-administered, the respective agents or therapies are administered at lower dosages than appropriate for their administration alone. Thus, co-administration is especially desirable in embodiments where the co-administration of the agents or therapies<br>
          lowers the requisite dosage of a potentially harmful (e.g., toxic) agent(s).<br>
As used herein, the term "toxic" refers to any detrimental or harmful effects on a subject, a cell, or a tissue as compared to the same cell or tissue prior to the administration of the toxicant. As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically purified" refers to a composition of sufficient purity        or quality of preparation for pharmaceutical use.<br>
As used herein, the term "purified" refers to a treatment of a starting composition to remove at least one other component (e.g., another component from a starting composition (e.g., plant or animal tissue, an environmental sample etc.), a contaminant, a synthesis precursor, or a       byproduct, etc.), such that the ratio of the purified component to the removed component is greater than in the starting composition.<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutical composition" refers to the combination of an active agent (e.g., an active pharmaceutical compound) with a carrier, inert or active (e.g., a        phospholipid), making the composition especially suitable for diagnostic or therapeutic use in vitro, in vivo or ex vivo.<br><br><br>
The terms "pharmaceutically acceptable" or "pharmacologically acceptable," as used herein, refer to compositions that do not substantially produce adverse reactions, e.g., toxic, allergic, or immunological reactions, when administered to a subject.<br>
As used herein, the term "topically" refers to application of the compositions of the present       invention to the surface of the skin and mucosal cells and tissues (e.g., alveolar, buccal, lingual, masticatory, or nasal mucosa, and other tissues and cells which line hollow organs or body cavities).<br>
As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier" refers to any of the standard<br>
         pharmaceutical carriers including, but not limited to, phosphate buffered saline solution, water,<br>
emulsions (e.g., such as an oil/water or water/oil emulsions), and various types of wetting<br>
agents, any and all solvents, dispersion media, coatings, sodium lauryl sulfate, isotonic and<br>
absorption delaying agents, disintigrants (e.g., potato starch or sodium starch glycolate), and the<br>
like.. The compositions also can include stabilizers and preservatives. For examples of carriers,<br>
        stabilizers, and adjuvants. (See e.g., Martin, Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 15th Ed.,<br>
Mack Publ. Co., Easton, Pa. (1975), incorporated herein by reference). Moreover, in certain<br>
embodiments, the compositions of the present invention may be formulated for horticultural or<br>
agricultural use. Such formulations include dips, sprays, seed dressings, stem injections, sprays,<br>
and mists. 20<br>

         As used herein, the term "hydroalcoholic" as used in reference to a substance or composition indicates that said substance or composition comprises both water and alcohol. As used herein, the term "gelling agent" refers to a composition that, when dissolved, suspended or dispersed in a fluid (e.g., an aqueous fluid such as water or a buffer solution), forms a gelatinous semi-solid (e.g., a lubricant gel). Examples of gelling agents include but are not<br>
         limited to hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxymethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl guar, methyl<br>
cellulose, ethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, carbomer, alginate, gelatin, and poloxamer.<br>
As used herein, the term "dried" as used in reference to a composition refers to removing the 30     solvent component or components to levels that no longer support chemical reactions. The term is also used in reference to a composition that has been dried (e.g., a dried preparation or dried composition). Those of skill in the art will appreciate that a composition may be "dried" while still having residual solvent or moisture content after, e.g., lyophilization, or that a dried composition may, after the end of a drying process, absorb moisture hygroscopically, e.g., from 35     the atmosphere. The term "dried" encompasses a composition with increased moisture content due to hygroscopic absorption.<br><br><br>
As used herein, the term "protective agent" refers to a composition or compound that protects<br>
the activity or integrity of an active agent (e.g., an anticancer drug) when the active agent is<br>
exposed to certain conditions (e.g., drying, freezing). In some embodiments, a protective agent<br>
      protects an active agent during a freezing process (i.e., it is a "cryoprotectant"). Examples of<br>
protective agents include but are not limited to non-fat milk solids, trehalose, glycerol, betaine,<br>
sucrose, glucose, lactose, dextran, polyethylene glycol, sorbitol, mannitol, poly vinyl propylene,<br>
potassium glutamate, monosodium glutamate, Tween 20 detergent, Tween 80 detergent, and an<br>
amino acid hydrochloride.  <br>
As used herein, the term "excipient" refers to an inactive ingredient (i.e., not pharmaceutical^<br>
active) added to a preparation of an active ingredient. The gelling and protective agents<br>
described herein may be referred to generally as "excipients."<br>
        As used herein, the term "kit" refers to any delivery system for delivering materials. In the<br>
context of kinase activity or inhibition assays, such delivery systems include systems that allow for the storage, transport, or delivery of reaction reagents and/or supporting materials (e.g., buffers, written instructions for performing the assay etc.) from one location to another. For example, kits include one or more enclosures (e.g., boxes) containing the relevant reaction<br>
        reagents and/or supporting materials. As used herein, the term "fragmented kit" refers to<br>
delivery systems comprising two or more separate containers that each contains a subportion of the total kit components. The containers may be delivered to the intended recipient together or separately. For example, a first container may contain an agent for use in an assay, while a second container contains standards for comparison to test compounds. The term "fragmented<br>
          kit" is intended to encompass kits containing Analyte Specific Reagents (ASR's) regulated under section 520(e) of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, but are not limited thereto. Indeed, any delivery system comprising two or more separate containers that each contains a subportion of the total kit components are included in the term "fragmented kit." In contrast, a "combined kit" refers to a delivery system containing all of the components of a reaction assay<br>
         in a single container (e.g., in a single box housing each of the desired components). The term "kit" includes both fragmented and combined kits.<br><br><br><br>

Another aspect of the invention provides forming complexes of endoxifen with guggulipid and       any suitable phospholipids. Guggulipid, or guggul, is a natural substance derived from the mukul myrrh tree. The mukul myrrh gives off a sticky resin, which is processed to obtain guggulipid. This extract has been used for thousands of years in Aryuvedic medicine to treat arthritis and obesity. The guggulipid is a source of sterol compounds such as Z- and E-guggulsterones, generally present in an amount of at least 2.5% (10). Z and £-Guggulsterones       can be synthesized chemically and thus can be used in drug formulations where the need is to have pure forms of these sterones. See, e.g., U.S. Application Ser. No. 60/856,952, filed November 6, 2006, and PCT/US07/83832, filed November 6, 2007, both incorporated herein by reference.<br>

The technology outlined in the present invention may also be used for any other water-insoluble       drugs. The methods and compositions of the present invention find use in conjunction with the methods and compositions disclosed in U.S. Application Ser. No. 60/850,446, filed Oct. 10, 2006, PCT Application Ser. No. PCT/US07/80984, filed October 10, 2007, U.S. Application Ser. No. 60/856,952, filed November 6, 2006, PCT Application Ser. No. PCT/US07/83832, filed November 6, 2007, all of which are incorporated by reference herein in their entireties. 35     The compositions of the present invention can be employed to treat breast cancer and breast<br>
related diseases. For example, the compositions of the present invention may be administered to a patient diagnosed with benign breast disease. As used herein, the term" benign breast disease"<br><br><br>
refers to a constellation of non-malignant aberrations in breast tissue. The aberrations may be proliferative or non-proliferative in nature. The exemplary benign breast diseases treatable by the present inventive compositions include adenosis, cysts, duct ectasia, fibroadenoma, fibrosis, hyperplasia, metaplasia and other fibrocystic changes. Each of these diseases, referred as       "changes" or "conditions" due to their prevalence, have well-defined histological and clinical characteristics.<br>
"Adenosis" refers to generalized glandular disease of the breast. It typically involves an       enlargement of breast lobules, which contain more glands than usual. In "sclerosing adenosis,"<br>
or "fibrosing adenosis," the enlarged lobules are distorted by scar-like fibrous tissue.<br>
"Cysts" are abnormal sacs filled with fluid or semi-solid material. Cysts in the breast arelined<br>
by breast epithelial cells, developing from lobular structures. They begin as excess fluid inside<br>
breast glands, but may grow to proportions that stretch surrounding breast tissue, causing pain.      "Fibrocysts" are cystic lesions circumscribed by, or situated within, a conspicuous amount of<br>
fibrous connective tissue.<br>
"Duct ectasia" refers to a dilation of mammary ducts by lipid and cellular debris. Rupture of the<br>
ducts induces infiltration by granulocytes and plasma cells.<br>
"Fibroadenoma" refers to benign tumors that are derived from glandular epithelium and contain        a conspicuous stroma of proliferating fibroblasts and connective tissue.<br>
"Fibrosis" simply refers to a prominence of fibrous tissue in the breast.<br>
"Hyperplasia" refers to an overgrowth of cells, where several layers of cells line the basal<br>
membrane, without tumor formation. Hyperplasia increases the bulk of mammary tissue. In<br>
"epithelial hyperplasia," the cells lining breast ducts and lobules are involved, giving rise to the       terms "ductal hyperplasia" and "lobular hyperplasia." Based on a histological determination,<br>
hyperplasia may be characterized as "usual" or "atypical".<br>
"Metaplasia" refers to a phenomenon in which a differentiated tissue of one type transforms into<br>
a differentiated tissue of another type. Metaplasia often results from an environmental change,<br>
and enables cells better to withstand the change.  <br><br>
The compositions of the present invention may be administered in any dosage form and via any<br>
system that delivers the active compound endoxifen to breast estrogen receptors in vivo. In<br>
some embodiments, a composition of present invention is delivered by "percutaneous<br>
administration", e.g., delivering the drug from the surface of patient's skin, through the stratum<br>
         corneum, epidermis, and dermis layers, and into the microcirculations. This is generally<br>
accomplished by diffusion down a concentration gradient. The diffusion may occur via<br><br><br>
intracellular penetration (through the cells), intercellular penetration (between the cells), transappendageal penetration (through the hair follicles, sweat, and sebaceous glands), or any combination of the above.<br>
        Percutaneous administration of the endoxifen composition of the present invention may be advantageous because this may reduce systemic drug exposure and the risks from non-specifically activating estrogen receptors throughout the body. This is because in topical application of endoxifen will absorb primarily into local tissues. When the composition of invention containing endoxifen will be percutaneously applied to breasts, high concentration<br>
        will accumulate in the breast tissues presumably due to many estrogen receptors therein. The composition of endoxifen may be applied to any skin surface, preferably to one or both breasts. The daily doses to be administered can initially be estimated based upon the absorption coefficients of endoxifen, the breast tissue concentration that is desired, and the plasma concentration that should not be exceeded. The initial dose may be optimized in each patient,<br>
        depending on individual responses.<br>
 Percutaneous administration can be achieved in different ways, such as (i) by mixing the composition of endoxifen with suitable pharmaceutical carriers and, optionally, penetration enhancers to form ointments, emulsions, gel, lotion, creams or the like, where an amount of said       preparation is applied onto a certain area of the skin, (ii) by incorporating the composition of endoxifen into patches or transdermal delivery systems according to the technology known in the art.<br>
The effectiveness of percutaneous drug administration depends on many factors, such as drug       concentration, surface area of application, time and duration of application, skin temperature, skin hydration, previous irradiation, physicochemical properties of the drug, and partitioning of the drug between the formulation and the skin. In some embodiments, e.g., to enhance percutaneous effectiveness, the compositions or complexes comprise penetration enhancers that improve percutaneous absorption by reducing the resistance of stratum corneum by reversibly       altering its physicochemical properties, changing hydration in the stratum corneum, acting as co-solvent, or changing the organization of lipids or proteins in the intracellular spaces. Such enhancers include but are not limited to organic solvents such as alcohol, acetone, dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), polyethylene glycol, propoylene glycol, fatty acids and fatty alcohol and their derivatives, hydroxyl acids, pyrrolidones, urea, vegetable oils, essential oils, 35     and mixture thereof. In addition to chemical enhancers, physical methods can increase<br>
percutaneous absorption. For example, occlusive bandages induce hydration of the skin. Other physical methods include iontophoresis and sonophoresis, which use electrical fields and high-<br><br><br>
frequency ultrasound, respectively, to enhance absorption of drugs that are poorly absorbed due<br>
to their size and ionic characteristics (12-13). Those who are in the pharmaceutical field can<br>
easily manipulate the various factors and methods to achieve right efficacious dosage for<br>
percutaneous delivery.  <br>
For percutaneous administration, the formulation or composition of the invention containing<br>
endoxifen may be delivered in the form of ointment, emulsion (lotion), cream, gel, powder, oil<br>
or similar formulation. In some embodiments, the formulation comprises excipient additives,<br>
including but not limited to vegetable oils such as soybean oil, mustard oil, almond oil, olive oil,<br>
        groundnut oil, peanut oil, peach kernel oil, groundnut oil, castor oil, canola oil, and the like, animal fats, DMSO, lanolin lipoids, phosphatides, hydrocarbons such as paraffin's, petroleum jelly, waxes, lecithin, detergent emulsifying agents, carotin, alcohols, glycerol, glycerol ether, glycerine, glycol, glycol ethers, polyethylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, non-volatile fatty alcohols, acids, esters, volatile alcoholic compounds, talc, urea, cellulose derivatives, coloring<br>
       agents, antioxidants and preservatives.<br>
In some embodiments the formulation or composition of the invention containing endoxifen may be delivered as transdermal patch. The patch may comprise (i) a solution-impermeable backing foil, (ii) a layer like element having a cavity, (iii) a microporus or semipermeable 20     membrane, (iv) a self-adhesive layer, and (v) optionally a removable backing film. The layerlike element having a cavity may be formed by the backing foil and the membrane. Alternatively, the patch may comprise(i) a solution-impermeable backing foil.(ii) an open-pored foam, a closed pore foam, a tissue like layer or a fibrous web-like layer as reservoir.(iii) a self<br>
adhesive layer, and(iv) optionally a removable backing film.  <br><br>
In some preferred embodiments, the composition of the invention containing endoxifen is<br>
formulated in hydro alcoholic gel and the amount of endoxifen may vary from 0.001001 to 1.0<br>
gram per l00grams of gel, most preferably in the range of 0.01-0.20 grams per 100 grams of<br>
gel.  <br>
In other embodiments, the composition of present invention comprises one or more fatty acid esters as a penetration enhancer. One of the highly preferred examples of a fatty acid ester penetration enhancer is isopropyl myristate. When isopropyl myristate is used in gel, the       amount may range e.g., from 0.11 to 5.0 grams per 100 grams of gel, preferably from 0.5 to 2.0grams per 100 grams of gel.<br><br><br>
In another preferred embodiment the composition of invention containing endoxifen may also contain one or more nonaqueous vehicles, such as alcoholic vehicles. Examples of nonaqueous vehicles include ethyl acetate, ethanol, and isopropanol, preferably ethanol and isopropanol. These nonaqueous vehicles may be useful for dissolving both the active agent endoxifen and       any other penetration enhancer used. They also preferably have a low boiling point, preferably less than 100 C at atmospheric pressure, to permit rapid evaporation upon contact with skin. In particular, ethanol may effectively contribute to the percutaneous absorption of endoxifen by rapidly evaporating upon contact with skin. The amount of absolute nonaqueous vehicle in a gel formulation ranges from 35% to 99% by weight, preferably between 50% to 85% and more       preferably between 60% to 75%.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the composition or formulation of the invention comprises an aqueous vehicle that permits solubilization of hydrophilic molecules, and promotes moisturization of skin. An aqueous vehicle also can regulate pH. Aqueous vehicles include<br>
         alkalinizing and basic buffer solutions, including phosphate buffer solutions, including phosphate buffer solutions (e.g., dibasic or monobasic sodium phosphate); citrate buffered solutions (e.g., sodium citrate or potassium citrate) and purified water. The amount of an aqueous vehicle preferably ranges between 0.1% to 65% by weight of the pharmaceutical composition, preferably between 15% to 50%, and more preferably between 25% to 40%.<br><br>
In other embodiments, the composition of the invention comprises one or more gelling agents to increase the viscosity of the composition or formulation or to function as a solubilizing agent. It may constitute between 0.1% to 20% by weight of formulation depending on the nature of gelling agent, preferably between 0.5% to 10% and more preferably between 0.5% to 5%. The<br>
         gelling agents may be carbomers, cellulose derivatives, poloxamers and poloxamines. The<br>
preferred gelling agents are chitosan, dextran, pectins, natural gums and cellulose derivatives<br>
such as ethyl cellulose, hydroxyethyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl cellulose, hydroxypropyl methyl<br>
cellulose (HPMC), carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC) and the like. The most preferred gelling<br>
agent is hydroxypropyl cellulose.  <br><br>
The composition of invention may comprise a gelling agent as described above, in particular a<br>
non-preneutralized acrylic polymer and also comprise a neutralizing agent. The ratio of<br>
neutralizing agent/gelling agent varies in between 10:1 to 0.1:1, preferably between 7:1 to 0.5:1,<br>
and more preferably between 4:1 to 1:1 .A neutralizing agent in the presence of polymer should<br>
         form salts that are soluble in the vehicle. A neutralizing agent also should permit optimum<br><br><br>
swelling of polymer chains during neutralization of charges and formation of polymer salts. The neutralizing agents include ammonium hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, aminomethylpropanol, trolamine, and tromethamine. Those skilled in the art will select a neutralizing agent according to the type of geling agent used in the composition or formulation.       However, no neutralizing agent is required when a cellulose derivative will be used as geling agents.<br>
In some embodiments, the compositions of present invention are employed to treat other diseases, and the medication is selected from a lipophilic or a compound made lipophilic by       derivatization of the group consisting of antiasthama, antiarrhythmic, antifungals,<br>

EXAMPLE 9 Toxicity Testing<br>
          Endoxifen was formulated according to Example 6 and was tested for toxicity in male Balb/c mice. A single test dose at 100 mg/kg or 50 mg/kg was intravenously administered to mice. All the mice died at the 100 mg/kg dose level whereas all animals survived at the 50 mg/kg dose level with no significant loss of body weight. The mice also survived in the control group with a vehicle control that lacked endoxifen. Repeat dose toxicity study was conducted with a dose<br>
         of 25 mg/kg administered consecutively for 3 days with accumulated dose of 75 mg/kg. All the animals in this group survived. The results are reported in the table below as the number of mice surviving per total.<br><br><br>
Treatment	Dose (mg/kg)	Survival/Total<br>
Single dose	100	0/2<br>
	50	4/4<br>
Repeat dose	25	4/4<br>
EXAMPLE 10 <br>
Endoxifen exhibits anti-proliferative activity against different tumor cells<br>
Endoxifen was tested for antiproliferation activity against various cancer cell lines from Non       Small Lung Cancer, Breast Cancer, Prostate Cancer, Melanoma Cancer, Ovarian Cancer, CNS Cancer, Renal Cancer and Colon Cancers. The cells were incubated for multiple days (3 - 7) with Endoxifen (10 nM to 10 uM) and the inhibition of growth were measured by SRB or MTT staining method. The results indicated significant growth inhibition of cells in the presence of Endoxifen ranging from 10 to 100%. Endoxifen induce growth inhibition or cell killing in       different tumor cells indicates the usefulness of Endoxifen in the treatment of cancers in humans.<br>
EXAMPLE 11 <br>
Endoxifen Inhibits Estradiol Dependent Breast Tumor Growth<br>
        It is known that Tamoxifen antagonizes estradiol-dependent breast cancer xenograft growth<br>
(15). Endoxifen base and endoxifen-citrate in oral dosage form can be similarly be tested for<br>
inhibition of estradiol dependent MCF-7 xenograft growth. For the animal experiments, female<br>
nude mice (Bom: NMRI-HW/HW) per xenograft experiment, ages 4 to 6 weeks and weighing 20 to<br>
24 g, are used according to standard protocols. An example of such a procedure is as follows:  <br><br>
MCF-7 xenografts are developed by passage of transplantable tumor from a parent tumor<br>
established in oophorectomized athymic nude mice treated with estradiol (16-17).<br>
Randomly bred female athymic mice are bilaterally ovriectomized and allowed a 2-week       recovery period before the implantation of tumor material. The s.c. transplantation of the MCF-7 tumor fragments (size, lxlxl mm3) is done under anesthesia. The diameter of the tumors is measured regularly, e.g., once weekly, using a caliper-like mechanical instrument and the tumor volume {V) is calculated according to the empirical equation V= (length x width2)/2.  The median volumes of each group are normalized to the initial tumor volume resulting in the       relative tumor volume. In all the experiments, tumor-bearing mice receive estradiol<br><br><br>
supplementation [estradiol valeriate (E2D), 0.5 mg/kg once/wk i.m.]. This supplementation leads to physiologic levels of serum E2 (25-984 pg/mL) that are comparable to the human situation (25-600 pg/mL depending on the follicular phase).<br>
        Substances: The following substances are used: E2D, Tamoxifen and endoxifen.<br>
Treatment Modalities: All MCF-7 transplanted animals receive E2D (0.5 mg/kg) injections once<br>
a week. After 4 weeks, when hormone-supplemented tumors have grown to ~0.7-0.8 cm in<br>
diameter (180-250 mm ), the mice are randomized into 4 treatment groups of 5-10 mice each.<br>
The 5-10 mice are sacrificed as baseline controls for E2D alone.  <br>
The treatment groups are: (i) E2D support (0.5mg/kg once/wk i.m); (ii) E2D support<br>
(0.5mg/kg once/wk i.m) plus Tamoxifen (0.5mg-2mg)/mouse per day, 5 days/week by gavage ;<br>
(iii) E2D support (0.5mg/kg once/wk i.m) plus endoxifen (0.5mg-2mg)/mouse per day, 5 days<br>
/week by gavage; (iv) withdrawal of E2D support.<br>
          Suppression of tumor growth in this breast cancer tumor model is indicative of therapeutic effect<br>
in the treatment of breast cancer in humans (15).<br>
EXAMPLE 12<br>
Endoxifen Minimizes Uterotrophic Effect of Estrogen<br><br>
It is known that Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal agent with potent anti-estrogenic effect in animal<br>
and in vitro models. This pharmacologic property is related to the drug's ability to compete<br>
with estrogen for estrogen receptors in breast tissues, and to inhibit the stimulatory effect of<br>
estrogen on the uterus, vagina and ovaries (18).<br><br>
Endoxifen (0.1 mg-2 mg) is administered orally once daily for 28 days to determine the<br>
reduction in utertrophic effect of estradiol; Female BALB/c mice approximately 50 days old<br>
and weighing 19-20 g are obtained (e.g., from Charles-River, Inc.) and housed four to five per<br>
          cage at a temperature (23+_ 1 C) and light (12 h light/ day). The atrophic changes are observed<br>
in the mice. There will be three groups such as vehicle control, Tamoxifen and endoxifen. The<br>
animals (5-10 mice) are randomly assigned to each group. Daily treatments of intact mice with<br>
a dose (e.g., 0.1 mg-2mg) by gavage of Tamoxifen or endoxifen are expected to lead to<br>
progressive inhibition of uterine and vaginal weight. 35<br>
Such results will show that endoxifen has better minimizing uterotrophic effect of estrogen than<br>
Tamoxifen, and that endoxifen finds use as an effective anti-estrogen. Endoxifen blocking of<br>
uterine weight gain stimulated by estrogen can also be demonstrated in immature rats.<br>
Endoxifen preparations showing the effects described above find use in the treatment of breast<br><br><br>
cancer as well as other estrogen-sensitive conditions, such as endometriosis, leiomyomata, and benign breast disease, as well as other estrogen-responsive conditions in men and women.<br>
EXAMPLE 13<br>
 	Endoxifen-Caused Decrease of Ki-67 Antigen Expression in Proliferating Breast<br>
Cancer Cells<br>
Ki-67 is a nuclear non-histone protein. This antigen is absent in quiescent cells and is expressed in proliferating cells and is used as a biomarker (19-20). Endoxifen base or endoxifen-citrate in<br>
         oral or injectable form are given to xenograft breast cancer tumor models (e.g., as described<br>
above), as well as to breast cancer patients. Immunochemical determination of Ki-67 is done in tumor cells from breast cancer tissues from patients, as well as from mice bearing tumors as described in Example 11. The MIB-1 or similar antibody available from commercial sources such as DAKO, Carpenteria, CA is used for immunochemical localization of antigen. Decrease<br>
           in Ki-67 antigen expression in animals and/or breast cancer patients demonstrate the applicability of endoxifen in treating breast cancers.<br>
EXAMPLE 14 <br>
Endoxifen reduces IGF-1 levels in Breast Cancer<br><br>
It is known for humans that Tamoxifen reduces the levels of circulating insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-1). IGF-1 has been used as a surrogate biomarker and predicts the effectiveness of Tamoxifen in treatments of breast cancer patients (21). To test the effects of endoxifen preparations of the present invention, endoxifen base or endoxifen-citrate are given orally or<br>
         injected to experimental animals bearing breast cancer tumors. The concentration of IGF-1 levels in control and xenografted breast tumor is monitored by established assays (e.g., ELISA Kit from Diagnostics Systems Laboratories, London, UK or DAKO, Carpenteria, CA). Endoxifen is administered by gavages at 0.5mg-2mg per mouse per day, 5 days/week. Decrease of IGF-1 levels and tumor growth reduction indicates the usefulness of IGF-1 as a surrogate<br>
          marker for breast cancer.<br><br><br>
EXAMPLE 15<br>
Endoxifen Prevents Development of Bicalutamide -induced<br>
Gynecomastia and Breast Pain<br>
Bicalutamide (CasodexR) is used for treating prostate cancer in men. There is growing       evidence that IGF-1 may be involved in prostate cancer promotion and progression. It is also known that anti-estrogen agents such as Tamoxifen decrease IGF-1 levels and prevent biculatamide -induced gynecomastia in prostate cancer patients (22). Since, endoxifen is an active metabolite of the Tamoxifen anti-estrogen, the silastic slow-release capsules containing endoxifen for implant or oral doses of endoxifen (lmg-l0mg/day) with biculatamide are   expected to prevent development of biclutamide -induced gynecomastia and breast pain.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
