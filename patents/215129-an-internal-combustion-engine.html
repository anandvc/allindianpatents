				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved internal combustion engine comprising a carburetor connected to the combustion chamber, a piston assembly within the combustion chamber connected to the crank case and a lubrication device linked with the carburetor. The main embodiment of the present invention resides in the improved lubrication device which ensures that the lubricating oil delivered to the engine is rendered throttle specific and limited to the desired level with respect to the fuel consumption.<br>
The simple but inefficient mixture scavenged, spark ignition engines are used for a wide range of utility engines, mopeds, motorcycle, snowmobile and out board marine applications. The large, low speed, turbo charges, marine diesel engines have a brake thermal efficiency of over 50%. The two stroke engines are used extensively. The principal advantages of two stroke engines are higher specific power output, lower specific weight and volume, simpler construction, lower brake specific NOX emission and lower part load pumping losses. The major disadvantages in the mixture scavenged spark ignition mode include high brake specific hydrocarbon and CO emission, poor combustion due to high dilution. These emissions not only contribute to causing pollution hazard but also decreases fuel efficiency.<br>
The high specific hydrocarbon emission and the generally inferior fuel consumption of mixture scavenged two stroke engines are largely due to the direct loss of air fuel mixture to the exhaust during the open cycle. This is further accentuated by impaired combustion due to high dilution.<br>
The lowest displacement capacity in the single cylinder version in the current scenario of two stroke spark ignition engine is about 35CC for the present day two stroke spark ignition engines. These are crankcase mixture scavenged and are generally constant speed machines. In the 50-250cc capacity, in the single cylinder version they are used in the transport vehicle application and are generally crankcase mixture scavenged variable speed load machines. However, here direct loss of fuel air mixture during scavenging, high dilution of charge through out the range of engine<br><br>
operating conditions and in particular at low throttle operation, and petrol oil lubrication are principal factors responsible for high brake specific fuel consumption and emission.<br>
In the conventional crank case scavenged two stroke spark ignition engine, lubrication of the bearing domains and engine cylinder are achieved through petrol oil lubrication system. Along with petrol a predetermined quantity of lubricating oil is mixed. The petrol oil mixture is inducted into the crankcase along with air through a carburetor. During the process of induction, the petrol oil mixture is disintegrated and in the crank case as evaporation of a petrol occurs, the lubricating oil is left as a fine mist. Motion of the air fuel vapour and lube oil droplets in the crankcase and charge transfer into the engine cylinder results in the deposition of the lube oil at locations requiring lubrication.<br>
The 250CC and above capacity multicylinder engines are yet to be developed for automotive application. Here, however, the direct loss of fuel air mixture during scavenging is fully eliminated in systems employing in-cylinder injection in the closed part of the cycle and reduced substantially in those employing in-cylinder injection in the open part of the cycle. Independent lubrication system is employed to achieve more efficient lubrication system of the engine. However, these engines also suffer from the drawbacks of high dilution which has a negative impact on the engine performance.<br>
Petrol oil lubrication is a simple solution to the problem of lubrication of two stroke spark ignition engines. It entails however, loss of a substantial part of the lubricant due to the inefficiency of the impaction principle employed. Further under all lubricating conditions, a constant proportion of lubricating oil with respect to fuel consumption is supplied to the engine.<br>
The present invention relates to a lubrication system for two stroke engines with in-cylinder injection. In such engines, the crank case draws only air.<br><br>
The disintegration of a petrol oil mixture by air steam automisation is influenced strongly by the viscosity of the mixture. The viscosity of the mixture depends on the proportion of lube oil and petrol. The reduction in viscosity as the proportion of petrol is increased follows a law of diminishing returns. A mixture of petrol oil with one two part of oil and two or three parts of petrol leads to adequate reduction in the viscosity of the mixture to achieve the desired disintegration of the mixture during induction into the crank case. A fueling device similar to conventional carburetor is used to ensure that the lubricating oil delivered to the engine is rendered throttle specific and is limited to the desired level with respect to the fuel consumption.<br>
The novel lubrication device of the present invention retains the specific simplicity of petrol oil lubrication and absolute quantity of lube oil supplied to the engine is rendered throttle specific and is regulated to the desired level with respect to the operating condition.<br>
The metering section of the carburetor is redesigned to get a continuous supply and has small orifices which control the rate of flow of the fluid. Flow rate in the conventional carburetors is decreased by more than two orders of magnitude to achieve lube oil flow in the range 0.75 % to 1.5% over the range of throttle operation that is ideal to full throttle. This is achieved through a multiorifice/multimetering orifice regulation system.<br>

The conventionally known large sized orifice are here replaced by smaller sized orifice where the size of orifice is decreased substantially. The nozzles are controlled by throttle. The throttle has three orifices, at the bottom, top as well as middle, are in line. Conventionally only one orifice is provided at the bottom.<br><br><br><br><br>
