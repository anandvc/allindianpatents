				<td>Disclosed are preparations and formulations of high thermodynamic activity lipophilic associations (LA), in which there is pairing between an ionizable pharmaceutical agent and a lipophilic species having ionic characteristics opposite to that of the pharmaceutical agent Such lipophilic associations manifest high thermodynamic activity, as evidenced by their being predominantly in a liquid phase at room temperature or solvated in a lower-than-water thelectric solvent Farther the pharmaceutical agent being solubilized means that dissolution is not rate limiting to transmucosal absorption. This LA or LA-solvate is formulated into a low thelectric dosage form, from whence, upon the dosage form&#x27;s hydration, the pharmaceutical agent is driven through the mucosal tissue and into systemic circulation. The invention therefore provides an enhanced transmocosal drug delivery system for ionizable pharmaceutical agents at or near physiological pH.</td>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention provides a composition and a method for delivery of a pharmaceutical agent. In particular, the invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation for enhanced transmucosal delivery of an ionizable pharmaceutically active substance at or near physiological pH. Transmucosal delivery includes the oral mucosa, esophagus, gastrointestinal tract including the stomach and colon, lungs, rectum, sinuses, eyes, urinary tract and the linings of the female reproductive organs. The physiological pH of these various membranes varies considerably. The physiological pH of the gastrointestinal tract increases along its length from about pH 1 in the stomach to pH 8 in the colon. Saliva has a pH around 6.8. The pH of nasal fluids range from about pH 5.5 to 6.5. The pH of the vagina is around 4.5. The invention is designed to provide transmucosal delivery in the pH range specific to the target mucosal tissue to avoid local irritation. Transmucosal absorption, as embothed in this invention, is not dependent on pH. This is unlike the prior art that requires that the pH be adjusted, typically by the use of buffers, to insure that the ionizable pharmaceutical agent is predominately in its freebase or free acid form for optimal transmucosal delivery. Transmucosal delivery of the ionizable pharmaceutical, as embothed in this invention, only requires the development of a hydration and thelectric grathent. The present invention comprises a pharmaceutical formulation that is capable of rapidly delivering a pharmaceutical agent into the mucosal tissue or the through the mucosal tissue into the circulatory system. For example the pharmaceutical agent may be absorbed through the oral mucosal tissue for systemic delivery.<br>
The invention further provides a process for the production, and a method of use, of such a formulation. More specifically, the invention provides a high thermodynamic activity lipophilic association (LA) of an ionizable pharmaceutical agent paired with a lipophilic agent having ionic character opposite to that of the pharmaceutical agent, such<br><br>
that the association is a liquid or is solubilized in a lower-than-water thelectric solvent. As used herein, the term "high thermodynamic activity" means that the lipophilic association or lipophilic association solvate is in a liquid state at room temperature. The LA being a liquid state, or solubilized, is at high thermodynamic activity such that drug dissolution is no longer rate limiting to transmucosal absorption. Further, the invention provides for formulating the high thermodynamic activity LA into a lower-than-water thelectric dosage form, which upon hydration results in an increasingly higher thelectric grathent. This provides the driving force for enhanced delivery of the lipophilized ionizable pharmaceutical agent through the mucus and into systemic circulation at or near physiological pH.<br>
The invention provides, inter alia, a process for making a transmucosal drug delivery system for an ionizable pharmaceutical agent by use of a lipophilic species having a charge, when ionized, opposite that of the ionized pharmaceutical agent It is the applicants present understanding that a lipophilic association according to the invention may be, for example, prepared according to the outline below. That is, for a basic ionizable functional group on an ionizable pharmaceutical agent that is not ionized (deprotonated), the corresponding acidic lipophilic species is also not ionized (protonated). For a basic ionizable group on a ionizable pharmaceutical agent that is ionized (protonated), the corresponding acidic lipophilic species is also ionized (deprotonated). In like manner, for an acid ionizable functional group on an ionizable pharmaceutical agent that is not ionized (protonated), the corresponding basic lipophilic species is also not ionized (deprotonated). For a acid ionizable group on a ionizable pharmaceutical agent that is ionized (deprotonated), the corresponding basic lipophilic species is also ionized (protonated).<br>
For a basic drug, a lipophilic species according to the invention is, for example, fatty acid or another lipophilic species. For a basic drug, a lipophilic species according to the invention may, for example, be one or more of the following fatty acids, or long-chain alkyl sulfonic acids, or a long-chain alkyl sulfuric acids: caproic, caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, arachidic, behenic, lignoceric, myristoleic, palmitoleic, oleic, gadoleic, erucic, ricinoleic, linoleic, linolenic, licanic, arachidonic and/or clupanadonic.<br><br>
For an acidic drug, a lipophilic species according to the invention is, for example, a fatty amine or another lipophilic species. For an acidic drug, a lipophilic species according to the invention is cetrimide, oleamidopropyl dimethylamine, didecyldimethyl ammonium chloride, quaternary surfactants, cetylpyridinium chloride, hexetidine, benzalkonium chloride and the following fatty amines and acid amides: caproic, caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, arachidic, behenic, lignoceric, myristoleic, palmitoleic, oleic, gadoleic, erucic, ricinoleic, linoleic, linolenic, licanic, arachidonic and/or clupanadonic.<br>
A formulation according to the invention contains an ionizable drug and an oppositely charged lipophilic species, to form the lipophilic association. The LA may require, if not already at a high thermodynamic activity liquid state, the use of lower-than-water thelectric solvent in order to prepare a LA-solvate that has high thermodynamic activity. Examples of appropriate lower-than- water thelectric solvents include ethanol, ethyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, triacetin, triethyl citrate, tributyl citrate, polyethylene glycols, propylene glycol, bisabolol, glycerin, mineral oil, ethyl oleate, fatty acid esters, squalane, animal oils, vegetable oils, hydrogenated vegetable oils, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, glycofurol, terpenes, essential oils, alcohols, polyols, silicone fluids or glycerides.<br>
A formulation according to the invention contains an ionizable drug, an oppositely charged lipophilic species, and an excipient, for example, a water-soluble excipient, to lower the local delivery area's thelectric constant, which is more favorable for association between the pharmaceutical agent and the lipophilic species in this lipophilic association. Examples of appropriate water-soluble excipients include a sugar, a polyol, an alcohol, a saccharide, a polysaccharide, glycerin, propylene glycol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, triacetin, triethyl citrate, tributyl citrate, a dextrate, dextrin, dextrose, fructose, lactitol, lactose, erythritol, maltose, maltitol, maltodextrin, polydextrose, trehalose, mannitol, polyethylene glycol, sorbitol, sucrose and/or xylitol.<br>
While the invention is not to be limited by theory, it is the applicant's understanding that, as water from the local delivery environment hydrates the high thermodynamic activity, lipophilic association, lower-than-water thelectric formulation according to the invention, a hydration and thelectric grathent is formed that provides the<br><br>
driving force for delivery of the lipophilized ionizable pharmaceutical agent through the mucosa and into systemic circulation.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that, in one embodiment, i.e., a nicotine sublingual/buccal tablet, a tablet containing a LA prepared with nicotine and oleic acid at a 1:1 molar ratio is effective in providing a rapid, bolus dose of nicotine after sublingual administration. In the art, to enhance delivery, many formulations require a molar ratio of oppositely charged species to active pharmaceutical agent of 50:1 or greater (M.Trotta, E. Urazio, E. Peira and C. Pulitano, "Influence of ion pairing on topical delivery of retinoic acid from microemulsions", J. Control Release, 2003, Vol. 86, pp 315-321).<br>
Further, in a nicotine sublingual/buccal tablet embodiment of the invention prepared with nicotine and oleic acid, the LA is a liquid with a pH in water of about 5.5 to 7.5, depending on the amount of the oleic acid present. Delivery is as rapid, and possibly more rapid, at lower pHs, the acidity being determined by any excess oleic acid over that needed for formation of the LA. However, excessive acidity is not necessary. Lower-than-physiological pHs would result if excessive amounts of oleic acid were needed for transmucosal delivery of the ionizable pharmaceutical agent. This attests to the efficiency of the invention. Further, at the pH range of this delivery system, nicotine predominately in the ionized form. Such efficient delivery at a pH where nicotine is ionized is surprising, because ionized pharmaceutical agents typically have very poor transmucosal delivery (Beckett and Hossie: Buccal Absorption of Drugs, in Handbook of Experimental Pharmacology, ed. B. B. Brothe and J. R. Gillette; Springer-Verlag, Berlin (1971), Ch. 3, and H.R Leipold and E. Quadros: Nicotine Permeation Through Buccal Cultures, in Proceed. Intern. Symp. Control. Rel. Bioact. Mater., Controlled Release Society, 20 (1993), 242-243).<br>
When a nicotine formulation is prepared according to the present invention, a rapid, bolus delivery of nicotine results from sublingual administration of the formulation in the physiological pH range of saliva, where nicotine's predominant form is ionized. This is among the advantages that a formulation according to the invention possesses over other known formulations. In general, transmucosal and transdermal drug delivery systems for ionizable pharmaceutical agents resort to using the free-base or free-acid form of the drug to obtain the desired level of drug permeation. Delivery of the free-base or<br><br>
free-acid form can cause the local delivery area's pH to be far outside the normal range of the local delivery area's customary physiological pH. This pH perturbation can result in local tissue irritation and cell death. By virtue of the inherent capacity of a formulation according to the invention to deliver ionizable pharmaceutical agents at or near physiological pH, delivery of a ionizable pharmaceutical agent according to the invention significantly reduces local tissue irritation and cell death when compared with delivery of other formulations. For example, delivery of nicotine free-base could cause a transient increase in local delivery area pH to 10 or above, a pH known in the art to be caustic. Indeed, one of the side effects of the sublingual nicotine tablet MICROTAB™ is an oral ulcer in the delivery area.<br>
Transmucosal drug delivery according to the invention includes inter alia certain preparative steps. According to the invention, an ionizable pharmaceutical agent is prepared into a lipophilic association (LA) by pairing with a lipophilic species that bears, when ionized, an opposite charge to that of the ionized pharmaceutical agent. In selecting the lipophilic species, efforts are made to ensure that the LA is at high thermodynamic activity, i.e. produces a liquid at room temperature. If this is not possible the LA is solvated in a lower-than-water thelectric solvent to produce a high activity, liquid LA-solvate. Further, the LA or LA-solvate is formulated so that when placed in water results in a solution pH at or near physiological pH of the targeted mucosal tissue. The LA or LA-solvate is formulated into a dosage form that on contact with water results in an increasing hydration and thelectric grathent, providing a driving force for transmucosal delivery of the lipophilized ionizable pharmaceutical agent This can be accomplished by including a water-soluble excipient that has a lower thelectric constant than water or that, when solubilized in water, lowers the solution's thelectric constant from that of water.<br>
The invention possesses a number of advantages over known formulations. The invention's lipophilic, high thermodynamic activity LA formulations provide for improved transmucosal drug absorption. First, dissolution of the pharmaceutical agent is no longer rate limiting to transmucosal absorption, i.e. the ionizable pharmaceutical agent is already dissolved being a liquid or in solution as the LA or LA-solvate respectively. Second, being in a liquid state the LA is at high molecular thermodynamic activity. Third, due to the lipophilic species used in the formation of the LA, it has greater affinity<br><br>
to lower-than-water thelectric environments such as cell membranes. The combination of a high thermodynamic activity liquid state, with the drug being in solution so as dissolution is not rate limiting, and the lipophilicity of the LA, driven by development of an increasing hydration and thelectric grathent as water enters the lower-than-water thelectric dosage form, provides optimal conditions for delivery of an ionizable pharmaceutical agent through the mucosa and into systemic circulation. A further advantage that the invention provides is transmucosal drug delivery at or near physiological pH. Previously known transmucosal delivery systems for ionizable pharmaceutical agents resort to using the free-base or free-acid forms of the drug substance to provide transmucosal drug permeation. In such cases the local delivery area pH can be far outside the range of physiological pH, resulting in local tissue irritation and cell death.<br>
A formulation according to the invention is embothed in any of a wide variety of different dosage forms, such as buccal tablet, sublingual tablet, oral capsule, oral tablet, nasal spray, buccal or vaginal spray, liquid/semisolid, aerosol for nasal, buccal or pulmonary delivery, patch, lozenge, gum, lollypop, film, strip, paper, suppository, pessary or other dosage forms using manufacturing techniques familiar to one versed in the art of formulating and processing pharmaceutical dosage forms. A manufacturing technique according to the invention includes any of the processes of direct tablet compression, wet or dry granulation, co-melt, dry powder blends, molding, spray-congealing, powder layering, tableting, encapsulating, spray-drying, spheronization, triturates, lyophilization, freeze drying, microencapsulation, troching, pelleting, aerosolizing, liquid or semisolid preparation.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a process of direct powder blends is used to create a solid dosage form. The process of direct powder blends can be outlined as weighing and blending of several ingrethents and either encapsulating or compressing the blend into tablet. This is the process that is used in the examples given herein as embodiments.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, a process of wet granulation is used to create a solid dosage form. The process of wet granulation can be outlined as several<br><br>
steps: weighing and blending of several ingrethents in the presence of solvent(s), drying the mixture into a solid, and milling the solid to proper size.<br>
In the weighing and blending step of wet granulation, proper amounts of drug and lipophilic species and solvent are mixed thoroughly. Additional ingrethents may be added to facilitate the mixing of the ingrethents. The end result of this step is a finely blended mixture in which the drug and the lipophilic agent are mixed.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, a process of co-melting is used. In this process, the LA is heated with a low melting water-soluble excipient, e.g. polyethylene glycol 6000. In its melted state, the excipient can act as a solvent into which the LA is dissolved or dispersed. The mixture of LA and excipient is then cooled and solidified. The solid solution of LA and excipient will be further processed into compressible powder. Other ingrethents may also be added to the co-melted powder to complete the drug formulation.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a process of freeze-drying is used. In this process, the LA is dissolved or dispersed in water with a water-soluble powder, e.g. mannitol. The solution is quickly frozen. The frozen solid is then put into a vacuum chamber where the water is removed from the solid via sublimation. The resulting powder is a solid carrier of LA on a water-soluble excipient.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, a process of spray drying is used. In this process, the LA is dissolved or dispersed in a solvent with an excipient. The solution or dispersion is then sprayed into a chamber. The solvent is evaporated while the droplets are in the air. The result is a fine powder consisting of the LA on carrier excipient.<br>
There are many other processes for making the final dosage form. The selection of the process will mainly depend on the LA or LA-solvate and the final dosage form most suitable for treatment of the diseased state.<br>
One embodiment of the invention provides a rapid, bolus dose of an ionizable pharmaceutical agent transmucosally and is formulated as liquid/semisolid or as a rapidly dissolving dosage form. Further embodiments of the invention provides sustained, delayed and pulsatile drug delivery. In the case of rapid bolus administration, the dosage from dissolves and releases the ionizable pharmaceutical agent relatively quickly, such as<br><br>
within 30 minutes. A sustained release formulation provides a slower delivery of the ionizable pharmaceutical agent from the dosage form. A delayed release dosage form provides a period of time after administration in which no drug delivery occurs, e.g., enteric or colonic delivery systems. A pulsatile release formulation provides repeated bolus delivery of the ionizable pharmaceutical agent from the dosage form. Given the description of the invention contained in this application, it will be apparent to one skilled in the art how to prepare any such dosage form.<br>
To treat a subject, the formulation, is administered by oral, sublingual, buccal, vaginal, rectal, pulmonary, ophthalmic, or intranasal route. Formulations will contain an effective amount of the active ingrethent in a LA or LA-solvate. The effective amount is sufficient to treat a disease state in the target mammal. The effective amount is readily determined by one skilled in the art. The active ingrethent may typically range from about 1% to about 95% (w/w) of the composition, or even higher or lower if appropriate. The quantity to be administered depends upon factors such as the age, weight and physical condition of the animal or the human subject. The quantity also depends upon the degree of activity desired. Effective dosages can be readily established by one of ordinary skill in the art through routine trials establishing dose response curves. The subject is treated by administration of the formulation in one or more doses. Multiple doses may be administered as required.<br>
Intranasal formulations may include vehicles that neither cause irritation to the nasal mucosa nor significantly disturb ciliary function. Diluents such as propylene glycol or polyethylene glycol or other known substances can be employed with the subject invention. The nasal formulations may also contain preservatives such as, but not limited to, chlorobutanol and benzalkonium chloride.<br><br>
Ionizable Pharmaceutical Agent A pharmaceutical agent according to the invention is an ionizable drug substance used for diagnosis, prevention, control, or treatment of a physiological, pathological or psychological condition. It is understood that a considerable variety of drug classes and specific drugs are useful as a pharmaceutical agent according to the invention. A pharmaceutical agent according to the invention may be, for example, a member of any of the following classes of drugs: antihypertensive agents, analgesics, antidepressants, opioid agonist, anesthetics, antiarrhythmic, antiarthritics, antispasmodics, ACE inhibitors, decongestants, antibiotics, antihistamines, anti-anginal, diuretics, anti-hypotensive agents, anti-Parkinson agents, bronchodilators, oxytocic agents, anti-diuretics, anti-hyperglycemics, antineoplastics and immunosuppresents agents, antiemetics, antiinfectives, antifungals, antivirals, antimuscarinics, antidiabetic agents, antiallergy agents, anxiolytics, sedatives, antipsychotics, bone modulating agents, cardiovascular agents, cholesterol lowering drugs, antimalarials, antiepileptics, anthelmintics, agents for smoking cessation, cough suppressants, expectorants, mucolytics, nasal decongestants, dopaminergics, gastrointestinal agents, muscle relaxants, neuromuscular blockers, parasympathomimetics, prostaglandins, stimulants, anorectics, thyroid and antithyroid agents, hormones, antimigrane agents, antiobesity, and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents.

Lipophilic Species. A lipophilic species according to the invention possesses, when ionized, a charge opposite that of an ionizable pharmaceutical agent according to<br><br>
the invention. A lipophilic species according to the invention combines with the pharmaceutical agent to form a high thermodynamic activity, low thelectric constant, lipophilic association. In an embodiment, a pharmaceutical agent and a lipophilic species are mixed together in about a 1:1 molar ratio. In a farmer embodiment, an ionizable pharmaceutical agent having more man one ionizable group may require mixing with an equal molar ratio of oppositely charged lipophilic species for each ionizable group. In yet a further embodiment, a pharmaceutical agent itself bears oppositely charged ionizable groups, such as in the case of a peptide or a protein, and may be mixed with bom anionic and cationic lipophilic species. In a particular embodiment, a molar excess of a lipophilic species is mixed with the ionizable pharmaceutical agent, lowering the thelectric constant and improving solubility of the LA.<br>
For a drug having basic functional groups, a lipophilic species according to the invention is an anion (when ionized), for example, a fatty acid. For drugs with basic functional groups, a lipophilic species according to the invention is one or more of the following fatty acids, long-chain alkyl sulfonic acids, or long-chain alkyl sulfuric acids: caproic, caprylic, capric, lauric, mytistic, palmitic, stearic, arachidic, behenic, Iignoceric, myristoleic, palmitoleic, oleic, gadoleic, crucic, ricinoleic, linoleic, lmolemc, licanic, arachidonic and/or clupanadonic. For drugs with acidic functional groups, a lipophilic species according to the invention is a cation (when ionized), for example, fatty amines. For drugs with acidic functional groups, a lipophilic species according to the invention is one or more of the following: cetrimide, oleamidopropyl dimethylamine, didecyldimemyl ammonium chloride, quaternary surfactants, cetylpyridinium chloride, hexetidine, benzalxonium chloride, and/or one or more of the following fatty amines and acid amides: caproic, caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic, palmitic, stearic, arachidic, behenic, Iignoceric, myristoleic, palmitoleic, oleic, gadoleic, erucic, ricinoleic, linoleic, linolenic, licanic, arachidonic and/or clupanadonic. Drugs with multiple functional groups would require mixtures of these lipophilic species.<br>
LA Solvent A lipophilic species according to the invention is mixed with a pharmaceutical agent according to the invention to form a high thermodynamic activity, low thelectric, lipophilic association (LA). In an embodiment, the LA thus formed is a<br><br>
liquid and therefore is already at high activity. ID a further embodiment, the LA is solubilized in<br><br>
order to attain a high activity thermodynamic state, i.e., a liquid state at room temperature. In a particular embodiment, a formulation according to the invention contains a molar excess of one or more lipophilic species for solubilizing and providing a low thelectric liquid environment for the LA. In a farmer particular embodiment, a formulation according to the invention contains a lower-than-water thelectric solvent other than a lipophilic species. In an embodiment, a lower-than-water thelectric solvent other than a lipophilic species according to the invention is ethanol, ethyl acetate, isopropyl alcohol, triacetin, triethyl citrate, tributyl citrate, a polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, bisabolol, glycerin, mineral oil, ethyl oleate, a fatty acid ester, squalane, an animal oil, a vegetable oil, a hydrogenated vegetable oil, isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, glycofurol, a terepene, an essential oil, an alcohol, a polyol, a silicone fluid or a glyceride.<br>
Solid Carrier. In an embodiment, a formulation according to the invention contains a solid carrier. A liquid LA or LA-solvate according to the invention is adsorbed or absorbed onto a solid carrier to improve processing. When an ingrethent is a liquid it is typically necessary to convert it into a solid before blending it with other powders to prepare tablets, capsules or other solid dosage forms. The liquid is typically of an oily nature and can be adsorbed onto the surface of a solid. Adsorption, being a surface phenomenon, is influenced by the available surface area on the solid. Thus, the most efficient adsorbents are usually very small particles. In an embodiment, an adsorbent according the invention may be microcrystalline celluloses, cellulose powder, silicifled microcrystalline celluloses (PROSOLV 50, PROSOLV 90HD), silicas (ZEOPHARM 5170, AEROPERL 300, SYLOID 244FP, SYLOID 63FP, SYLOID 72 FP), clays, talc, starches, pregelatinized starches, calcium carbonate, and magnesium carbonate. In one embodiment, a solid carrier for a liquid LA according to the invention is a cyclodextrin or a substituted cyclodextrin. These materials form inclusion complexes with lipophilic molecules on a 1: 1 molar ratio. Cyclodextrins are "bucket like" molecules, with a ridged structure and a central cavity. The internal surface of the central cavity is lipophilic, while the outside surface is hydrophilic. This arrangement allows the cyclodextrin to harbor a guest molecule within the cavity, forming an inclusion complex that is water-soluble. Thus, this mechanism of solidification is by absorption.<br><br>
Water-Soluble Excipient In an embodiment, a formulation according to the invention contains a water-soluble excipient A variety of excipients are useful as the water-soluble component of the invention, the selection being based on the delivery system. In an embodiment, the water-soluble excipient can be a water-soluble LA solvent, e.g., propylene glycol for use in a liquid dosage form. In an embodiment, the water-soluble excipient can be a tablet diluent, e.g., mannitol for a solid dosage form. The development of a gradually increasing hydration and thelectric grathent in the dosage form is most favorable for transmucosal delivery of an ionizable pharmaceutical agent according to the invention. Hence, in an embodiment, a water-soluble excipient according to the invention is one or more of the following: a sugar, a polyol, a alcohol, a saccharide, a polysaccharide, glycerin, propylene glycol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl acetate, triacetin, triethyl citrate, tributyl citrate, a dextrate, a dextrin, dextrose, fructose (ADVANTOSE FS 95), lactitol (FINLAC DC), lactose, erythritol, maltose, maltitol, a maltodextrin, a polydextrose, trehalose, mannitol (PEARLITOL 300 DC, PEARLITOL 400 DC, PEARLITOL 500 DC, MANNOGEM 2080, MANNOGEMEZ, PARTEK M200, PARTEK M300), a polyethylene glycol, sorbitol, sucrose and xylitol (XYLITOL 200, XYLITOL 300).<br>
Other Excipients. In an embodiment, another excipient, chosen to enhance processability, form, function or appeal of the formulation is included in a formulation according to the invention. In such an embodiment, another excipient according to the invention is a buffering agent (such as phosphate, carbonate, tartrate, borate, citrate, acetate, and maleate buffers), colorant, flavoring, solvent and co-solvent, coating agent, binder, diluent, carrier, disintegrant, glident, lubricant, opacifying agent, humectant, granulating agent, gelling agent, polishing agent, suspending agent, sweetening agent, anti-adherent, preservative, emulsifying agent, antioxidant, levigating agent, plasticizer, surfactant, tonicity agent, viscosity agent, enteric agent and coating, controlled-release agent and coating, wax, wetting agent, thickening agent, suppository base, stiffing agent, stabilizing agent, solubilizing agent, sequestering agent, ointment base, oleaginous vehicle, film-forming agent, essential oil, emollient, dissolution enhancer, dispersing agent, and/or cryoprotectant or combinations thereof.<br><br>
Exemplary Embodiments: Sublingual/Buccal Tablets It will be readily understood that the components, formulations, processes, and methods of use of the present invention, as generally described herein, are arranged and designed in a wide variety of different dosage forms and formulations. Thus, the following more detailed description of the embodiments of the formulation and methods of use of the present invention is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, as claimed, but merely represents one of the dosage form embodiments of the invention, e.g. a sublingual/buccal tablet.<br>
EXAMPLE I: Nicotine In an embodiment, a buccal/sublingual tablet formulation according to the invention is useful in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). Certain commercially available products for NRT in smoking cessation, such as patches, gum, and lozenges, do not provide for the rapid rise or peak nicotine plasma levels obtained by smoking. Certain other products, such as nasal sprays, inhalers, and certain sublingual tablets, that attempt to provide nicotine plasma levels similar to smoking a cigarette, result in local irritation.<br>
Pomerleau (Ann. Behav. Med. 1998, Vol. 36,158-163) listed criteria for a successful NRT: 1) the method should be safe and easy to use; 2) specific doses should be accurately and reproducibly delivered; 3) the pharmacokinetics should resemble those of cigarette smoking. Judging from the very limited efficacy of the current commercial NRTs (typically less than 20%), current commercial NRTs are not meeting the Pomerleau criteria.<br>
However, an embodiment of the present invention did meet the Pomerleau criteria. One embodiment of the present invention provides a convenient, small, round sublingual/buccal tablet useful for NRT. Such a tablet rapidly dissolved under the tongue or dissolved more slowly in the buccal cavity between the gums and cheek. Further, it did not produce ulcers in the mouth, which is one of the undesired side effects of other formulations that use nicotine in its free base form. It was also convenient and easy to use and is a socially acceptable delivery system. It is much more like taking a breath mint, unlike nasal sprays or inhalers. Further, such a tablet reproducibly provided a rapid<br><br>
bolus of nicotine after sublingual administration. Hence a sublingual/buccal tablet according to the invention meets the Pomerleau criteria and should be more successful at helping smokers quit cigarettes than the currently marketed products.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provided a 2 mg strength nicotine sublingual/buccal tablet having a total tablet weight around SO mg and nominal dimensions of about 0.55 cm in diameter and a thickness of about 0.15 cm. In such an embodiment, the ionic pharmaceutical agent according to the invention contained nicotine and a lipophilic species. The lipophilic species was oleic acid. The molar ratio of lipophilic species to ionic pharmaceutical agent was not less than about 1:1. However, a molar excess of the lipophilic species, in this example oleic acid, may be used, e.g., 1.2:1, but is not limited to this ratio. This LA is a liquid at room temperature. In order to convert the LA into a flowable powder suitable for use in direct compression tableting required the use of an adsorbent/absorbent, such as silica. In order to manufacture a rapidly disintegrating, directly compressible tablet other excipients were needed. For example, the diluent may be the water-soluble, direct compression tableting excipient mannitol. A disintegrant is included to rapidly break the tablet apart upon administration. An exemplary disintegrant is sodium starch glycolate. An exemplary tablet lubricant is sodium stearyl fumarate. A quantitative formulation is given in Table I.<br><br><br>
A method of manufacture for a sublingual/buccal tablet according to the invention is a suitable method known in the art, such as the addition of the nicotine LA or LA-solvate to premanufactured tablets, cold compressions with inert fillers and binders, direct tablet compression blends, direct powder blends, wet or dry granulations, molding, lyophilizanon, microencapsulation, co-melt, freeze drying, spray-congealing, spray-drying, spheronization, triturates, troching, powder layering, pelleting, encapsulation. An exemplary method of manufacture is outlined below and schematically in Figure 1.<br>
STEP 1: Mix nicotine and oleic acid together until homogeneous, to form a nicotine LA.<br>
STEP 2: Blend the nicotine LA with silica until homogeneous to form a nicotine LA silica carrier blend.<br>
STEP 3: Add the nicotine LA silica carrier blend to mannitol and sodium starch glycolate and blend until homogeneous to form a further blend.<br>
STEP 4: Add sodium stearyl fumarate to the further blend and blend until well lubricated to form a lubricated blend.<br>
STEP 5: Compressing the lubricated blend into tablets using 7/32 inch round tooling.<br>
Method of packaging. The sublingual/buccal tablets may be packaged in such a manner as to aid in maintaining nicotine stability. Exemplary packaging methods and materials include, but are not limited to, blister packaging in a foil/foil, foil/Acrylonitrile, foil/ Polychlorotrifluoroethylene laminates.<br>
Comparative dissolution Drug dissolution it a prerequisite to drug absorption and clinical response for almost all drugs given orally. (G. L. Amidon, EL Lennemas, V. P. Shah, J.R. Crison," A Theoretical Basis for a Biopharmaceutical Drug Classification: The Correlation of in Vitro Drug Product Dissolution and in Vivo Bioavailability,' Pharm.<br><br>
Res. 1995, Vol. 12, No. 3, pp 413-420.) Dissolution is considered an in vitro technique that gives good correlation to a product's in vivo performance. A drug must first be released from the delivery system in order to be available for absorption. Therefore, tablets having a faster dissolution would be expected to have faster absorption in vivo. Figure 2 presents the dissolution results of the nicotine sublingual/buccal tablet, the embodiment of the invention as presented herein, and two nicotine commercial products, i.e., a lozenge (COMMIT™) and a sublingual tablet (MICROTAB™). Dissolution was conducted in 900ml of D.I. water at 50 RPM using USP Apparatus 2. Samples were pulled at 2, 5,10,20,30,40 and 60 minutes, and analysis was by HPLC.<br>
As can be seen from the dissolution profiles, the sublingual/buccal tablet released over 90% of the nicotine in the tablet within 10 minutes. This rapid release of nicotine corresponded to typical plasma nicotine levels obtained from smoking a cigarette, which peak in about 10 minutes (WO 03/055486 A1). The lozenge COMMIT™ shows a very slow profile releasing only 35% of the dosage at the end of 60 minutes. The other sublingual tablet, MICROTAB™, takes about 30 minutes to reach the same level that the embothed invention given herein reached within 10 minutes, i.e., 90% of the dosage dissolved.<br>
The other products fail to provide rapid nicotine release, and therefore cannot provide a nicotine plasma level comparable to what a person obtains from smoking a cigarette. The present invention as embothed herein did provide rapid nicotine release. Indeed, more than 90% of the nicotine in the tablet was dissolved and available for transmucosal absorption within 10 minutes. It should be noted that the pH of the dissolution media obtained after dissolution of the sublingual/buccal tablets as embothed in this invention was 6.2. This is very similar to the pH of saliva, which is general recognized as being around 6.8. At a pH of 6.8 only about 10% of the nicotine is in the free base form. Others have indicated that in order to promote absorption of nicotine through the oral mucosa, the pH of the saliva must be increased so that nicotine will be predominately in the free base form (WO 03/055486 Al). The present invention provides for nicotine transmucosal absorption in acidic conditions similar to the physiological pH of the saliva. Others indicated that such a low pH nicotine transmucosal delivery would not be efficacious.<br><br>
In Vivo Data: Two male volunteers and one female volunteer, all former smokers, placed the nicotine sublingual tablet, as embothed herein, under the tongue and left it undisturbed. Immediately upon administration a tingling sensation was very apparent in the area where the sublingual tablet was placed. Shortly thereafter, i.e., within a few minutes, the physiological effects of nicotine were very apparent to all three volunteers. This included being light-headed, dizzy, a warming sensation and an increase in heart rate. In all three volunteers, the symptoms peaked within 10 minutes and the tablets were totally dissolved in less than 5 minutes. Interestingly, the usually overwhelming acrid taste of nicotine was not apparent. Instead there was a slightly bitter taste that was complimented by the sweet taste of mannitol. Within 30 minutes all volunteers felt normal. All three volunteers stated mat the nicotine sublingual tablet, as embothed herein, provided a bolus of nicotine that was similar to that obtained from smoking a cigarette.<br>
Method of Use: In an exemplary embodiment, a buccal/sublingual tablet formulation according to the invention is useful in nicotine replacement therapy (NRT). This therapy is designed to allow smokers to quit smoking by providing nicotine in a non-carcinogenic delivery system, i.e., without tars. In a typical treatment regiment, the smoker starts by placing a 2 or 4 mg nicotine sublingual tablet under the tongue and leaving it undistributed until dissolved, typically within 5 minutes, whenever there is an urge to smoke. In one embodiment, about 10 to 30 sublingual tablets are used per day. After a period of several weeks, the dosage is lowered to 2 mg or 1 mg (depending on the starting strength) then to 0.5 mg. Eventually, a placebo is used, if required. This gradual reduction in nicotine content helps wean the smoker off the desire for nicotine. This is usually supplemented with counseling. The tablets of the present invention can also be used by smokers when it is not acceptable for them to smoke, e.g., when they are in an airplane. The dosage range for this embodiment may be from 0.5 mg to 5 mg of nicotine.<br>
Example II: Epinephrine Epinephrine (adrenaline) is commonly given by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection for anaphylactic shock, allergic reactions and acute asthmatic attacks. The usual dosage is 300 μg, given intramuscularly by use of an auto-injector. Patients with a history of severe allergic reactions to insect bites or stings, foods, drugs, and other<br><br>
allergens, as well as idiopathic and exercise induced anaphylaxis, are supplied with auto-injectors for intramuscular self-administration. This is the preferred treatment for serious allergic reactions. An embodiment according to the invention, an epinephrine sublingual/buccal tablet as described below, has several advantages over the current therapy. First, the invention as embothed herein is convenient, non-invasive and painless to administer. Further, epinephrine is also unstable in light and is readily oxidized; an embodiment according to the invention, as described below, being a solid-state product rather than liquid preparation, provides better stability.<br>
In such an embodiment, the invention provides a 300 μg strength epinephrine sublingual/buccal tablet having a total tablet weight around 50 mg and nominal dimensions of about 0.55 cm in diameter and a thickness of about 0.15 cm. In such an embodiment, the ionic pharmaceutical agent according to the invention contains epinephrine and the lipophilic species with which it is combined (such as oleic acid), the molar ratio of the lipophilic species to ionic pharmaceutical agent being not less than about 1:1. However, a molar excess of the lipophilic species, in this example oleic acid, may be used, e.g., 1.2:1. Embodiments are described herein. In certain embodiments, the LA may require the use of a solvent to stabilize or solubilize the LA, e.g., ethyl oleate and polyethylene glycol 400. Embodiments are described herein. In certain embodiments, the liquid LA or LA-solvate requires the use of an adsorbent/absorbent in order to convert it into a flowable powder suitable for use in direct compression tableting (such as silica). Other excipients are in some circumstances useful in order to manufacture a rapidly disintegrating, directly compressible tablet (such as the water-soluble, direct compression tableting excipient mannitol). In order to rapidly break the tablet apart upon administration, a disintegrant is used. In one embodiment the disintegrant is sodium starch glycolate. An exemplary tablet lubricant is sodium stearyl fumarate. Exemplary embodiments are provided in Table II.<br><br><br>
Method of manufacture. A method of manufacture for such sublingual/buccal tablet embodiments may be any suitable method known in the art including, but not limited to, the addition of the epinephrine LA or LA-solvate to premanufactured tablets, cold compressions with inert fillers and binders, direct tablet compression blends, direct powder blends, wet or dry granulations, molding, lyophilization, microencapsulation, freeze drying, spray-congealing, spray-drying, co-melt, spheronization, triturates, troching, powder layering, pelleting, encapsulation. An exemplary method of manufacture is outlined below and is schematically diagramed in Figure 3.<br>
STEP 1: Mix epinephrine, oleic acid and any other solvents together to form a solution.<br>
STEP 2: Blend the epinephrine LA or LA-solvate with silica until homogeneous to form a silica carrier blend.<br><br>
STEP 3: Add the silica carrier blend to mannitol and sodium starch glycolate and mix until homogeneous to form a further blend.<br>
STEP 4: Add sodium stearyl fumarate to the further blend and blend until well lubricated to form a lubricated blend.<br>
STEP 5: Compressing the lubricated blend into tablets using 7/32 inch round tooling.<br>
Method of packaging. The sublingual/buccal tablets may be packaged in such a manner as to aid in maintaining epinephrine stability. Packaging methods and materials may include, but are not limited to, blister packaging in a foil/foil, fouVAcrylonitrile, foil/Polychlorotrifluoroethylene laminates.<br>
Method of Use: In an embodiment, a buccal/sublingual tablet formulation according to the invention is useful in the treatment of severe allergic reactions to insect bites or stings, foods, drugs, and other allergens, as well as idiopathic and exercise induced anaphylaxis. This therapy is designed to allow allergic patient to abort a hyper immune response such as anaphylaxis. The typically treatment regiment starts by placing a 300 μg epinephrine sublingual tablet under the tongue and leaving it undistributed until dissolved, typically within 5 minutes, whenever there is an allergic reaction. This can be supplemented with additional sublingual tablets until the allergic response is ameliorated. . The dosage range for this embodiment may vary from 200 μg to 1000 μg.<br>
EXAMAPLE III. Fentanyl<br>
Fentanyl transmucosal delivery is first line therapy for management of breakthrough cancer pain in patients with malignancies who are already tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. The embodiments as given herein have several advantages over the current therapy. First, the current transmucosal therapy uses a lollipop as the delivery system. The inherent implication and dangers of placing a potent opiate in the form of a candy attractive to children cannot be trivialized. Further, the current therapy takes over 20 minutes to reach maximum plasma concentrations. Thus pain relief is delayed far longer than would be desired. Hence the invention<br><br>
provides, in an embodiment, a fentanyl sublingual/buccal tablet to rapidly dissolve under the tongue, providing fast onset of action and pain relief for a cancer patient Further, it is much safer for the family environment than a lollipop, which requires the disposal of potent, opioid-laden delivery systems.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a 200 μg strength fentanyl sublingual/buccal tablet having a total weight around 50 mg and nominal dimensions of about 0.55 cm in diameter and a thickness of about 0.15 cm. In one embodiment, the ionic pharmaceutical agent is fentanyl and the lipophilic species with which it is combined is oleic acid. The molar ratio of the lipophilic species to ionic pharmaceutical agent in this embodiment is not less than about 1:1. However, a molar excess of the lipophilic species, in this example oleic acid, may be used, e.g. 1.2:1. Embodiments are described herein. In certain embodiments, the LA may require the use of a solvent to stabilize or solubilize the LA, e.g. ethyl oleate and polyethylene glycol 400. In certain embodiments, the liquid LA or LA-solvate requires the use of an adsorbent/absorbent in order to convert it into a flowable powder suitable for use in direct compression tableting. An exemplary adsorbent is a silica. Other excipients may be used in order to manufacture a rapidly disintegrating, directly compressible tablet. An exemplary diluent is the water-soluble, direct compression tableting excipient mannitol. In order to rapidly break the tablet apart upon administration, a disintegrant is used. An exemplary disintegrant is sodium starch glycolate. An exemplary tablet lubricant is sodium stearyl fumarate. Exemplary embodiments are provided in Table III.<br><br><br>
Method of manufacture. A method of manufacture for such sublingual/buccal tablet embodiments may be any suitable method known in the art including, but not limited to, the addition of the fentanyl LA or LA-solvate to premanufactured tablets, cold compressions with inert fillers and binders, direct tablet compression blends, direct powder blends, wet or dry granulations, molding, lyophilization, microencapsulation, freeze drying, spray-congealing, spray-drying, co-melt, spheronization, triturates, troching, powder layering, pelleting, encapsulation. An exemplary method of manufacture is outlined below and is schematically represented in Figure 4.<br>
STEP 1: Mix fentanyl, oleic acid and any other solvents together to form a solution.<br>
STEP 2: Blend the fentanyl LA or LA- solvate with silica until homogeneous to form a silica carrier blend.<br><br>
STEP 3: Add the silica carrier blend to mannitol and sodium starch glycolate and mix until homogeneous to form a further blend.<br>
STEP A: Add sodium stearyl fumarate to the further blend and blend until well lubricated to form a lubricated blend.<br>
STEP 5: Compressing the lubricated blend into tablets using 7/32 inch round tooling.<br>
Method of packaging. The sublingual/buccal tablets may be packaged in such a manner as to aid in maintaining fentanyl stability. Exemplary packaging methods and materials include, but not limited to, blister packaging in a foil/foil, foil/Acrylonitrile, foil/Polychlorotrifluoroethylene laminates.<br>
Method of Use: In an embodiment, a buccal/sublingual tablet formulation according to the invention is useful in the treatment of severe breakthrough cancer pain in patients with malignancies who are already tolerant to opioid therapy for their underlying persistent cancer pain. This therapy is designed to allow the cancer patient to self-adrniniater the treatment The treatment regiment starts by placing a 200 μg fentanyl sublingual tablet under the tongue and leaving it undistributed until dissolved, typically within 5 minutes, whenever there is an occurrence of breakthrough pain. Depending on the level of opiate tolerance in each patient, other dosage strengths may be used in treatment of each individual patient The range of dosage strength can be from 50 μg to 5000 μg.<br>
EXAMPLE IV: Alendronic Acid Bisphosphonates are potent inhibitors of bone resorption and are used in osteoporosis and Paget's disease of the bone. These are also used in the treatment of bone metastases and hypercalcaemia of malignancies. The most commonly used bisphosphonates axe alendronic acid, clodronic acid and etidronic acid. The embodiments as given herein have several advantages over the current bisphosphonate therapies. First, the current therapy is a tablet given by mouth or by IV injection. Oral administration is associated with a number of severe side effects including oesophagitis, esophageal<br><br>
erosions and ulcerations, dyspepsia, diarrhea, abdominal pain, and peptic ulcers. Further, oral bioavailability is very poor, in the range of 0.4 to 0.7% for alendronic acid and from to 1 to 6% for clodronic and etidronic acids. When administrated with food, bioavailability can be significantly reduced even to the level of being negligible. For alendronic acid, the usual daily dosage is 5 to 10 mg for osteoporosis and the dosage for Paget's disease is about 40 mg per day. The present invention provides, in one embodiment, a sublingual/buccal tablet that is designed to rapidly dissolve under the tongue. This avoids me potentially serious side effects .and the poor and erratic bioavailability observed from oral delivery.<br>
In one embodiment, a 100 μg strength alendronic sublingual/buccal tablet has a total weight of about 50 mg, and nominal dimensions of about 0.SS cm in diameter and a thickness of about 0. IS cm. The ionic pharmaceutical agent in mis example is alendronic acid, which has amine in addition to acid functional groups. In one embodiment, alendronic acid is combined with the lipophilic species oleic acid. The molar ratio between these two species in this example is at least about 1:1. However, since alendronic acidcontains two phosphoric acid groups, a lipophilic amine or amide, in this example hexetidine, may be needed. The molar ratio is at least about 1:1 but may be increased to about 2:1. In certain embodiments, the LA may require me use of a solvent to stabilize or solubilize the LA, e.g., ethyl oleate and polyethylene glycol 400. Embodiments are described herein. The LA or LA-solvate may require the use of an adsorbent/absorbent in order to convert it into a flowable powder suitable for use in direct compression tableting. In one embodiment, the adsorbent is a silica. In order to manufacture a rapidly disintegrating, directly compressible tablet other excipients may be needed. In one embodiment, the diluent is the water-soluble, direct compression tableting excipient mannitol. In order to rapidly break the tablet apart upon administration, a disintegrant is used. In one embodiment, the disintegrant is sodium starch glycolate. In one embodiment, the tablet lubricant is sodium stearyl fumarate. Several embodiments are given in Table IV.<br><br><br>
METHOD OF MANUFACTURE<br>
The method of manufacture for this sublingual/buccal tablet embodiment may be any suitable method know in the art including, but not limited to, the addition of the alendronic acid LA or LA-solvate to premanufactured tablets, cold compressions with inert fillers and binders, direct tablet compression blends, direct powder blends, wet or dry granulations, molding, co-melt, lyophilization, microencapsulation, freeze drying, spray-congealing, spray-drying, spheronization, triturates, troching, powder layering, pelleting, encapsulation.

EXAMPLE V: Clorazepic Acid Clorazepic acid is a benzodiazepine used mainly for fee treatment of anxiety, adjunct therapy for epilepsy and alcohol withdrawal syndrome. It is administered orally, intravenously and intramuscularly. Orally it is typically given in divided doses. The embodiments as given herein have several advantages over the current therapies. A<br><br>
patient undergoing alcohol withdrawal will typically exhibit signs of nausea and vomiting. Any orally administrated therapy during times of alcohol withdrawal runs the risk of being not efficacious as vomiting can eliminate the dosage. Further, for children, geriatric and depilated patients, swallowing a tablet can be difficult Since clorazepic acid is used in the relief of anxiety for elderly and debilitated patients and also as an adjunct therapy for epilepsy in children, having a convenient dosage form that does not require swallowing a tablet for administration provides a better therapy. Another therapy for which benzodiazepines have been used is for panic attacks. Sublingual clorazepic may be useful in the treatment of panic attacks, particularly due to its rapid onset of action. Panic attacks and agoraphobia could be avoided by administered the sublingual tablet just prior to the patient encountering a situation known to induce such attacks. Further, it could be used at the first signs of an attack, due to its rapid absorption, and thereby abort the attack.<br>
EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENT<br>
In one embodiment, a 5.75 mg strength clorazepic acid sublingual/buccal tablet has a total weight around 100 mg, and nominal dimensions of about 0.64 cm in diameter and a thickness of about 0.20 cm. The ionic pharmaceutical agent is clorazepic acid combined with the lipophilic species hexetidine. The molar ratio between these two species being not less than about 1:1. This LA may also require the use of a solvent. The LA or LA-solvate may require the use of an adsorbent/absorbent in order to convert it into a fiowable powder suitable for use in direct compression tableting. One exemplary adsorbent for this embodiment is a silica. In order to manufacture a rapidly disintegrating, directly compressible tablet, other excipients may be needed. In one embodiment the diluent is the water-soluble, direct compression tableting excipient mannitol. In order to rapidly break the tablet apart upon administration a disintegrant is used. In one embodiment, the disintegrant is sodium starch glycolate. In one embodiment, the tablet lubricant is sodium stearyl fumarate. Several embodiments, are given in Table V below.<br><br><br>
Method of Manufacture: The method of manufacture for this sublingual/buccal tablet embodiment may be any suitable method know in the art including, but not limited to, the addition of the clorazepic acid LA or LA-solvate premanufactured tablets, cold compressions with inert tillers and binders, direct tablet compression blends, direct powder blends, wet or dry granulations, molding, spray-congealing, lyophilization, freeze-drying, microencapsulation, co-melt, spray-drying, spheronization, triturates, troching, powder layering, pelleting, encapsulation. One method of manufacture is outlined below and is schematically represented in Figure 6.<br>
STEP 1: Mix clorazepic acid, hexetidine and any other solvents together until a solution is prepared.<br>
STEP 2: Blend the clorazepic acid LA or LA-solvate with silica until homogeneous.<br><br>

8.	The composition as claimed in any of claims 1 to 7, wherein the pharmaceutical composition, when dissolved in water, has a pH of about physiological pH of a target mucosal membrane.<br>
9.	The composition as claimed in claim 1, comprising nicotine, oleic acid and silica, wherein the molar ratio of the oleic acid to the nicotine is at least about 1:1 and the nicotine is associated with the oleic acid in the absence of a solvent to form a lipophilic association (LA), wherein the LA is adsorbed or absorbed to the silica and formulated into a sublingual or buccal tablet dosage form, wherein at least about 90% of the nicotine is released within about ten minutes when dissolution of the dosage form is conducted in 900 ml of deionized water at 50 RPM using USP Apparatus 2.<br><br>
10.	A method of manufacturing a pharmaceutical composition as defined in any one of claims<br>
1 to 10, the method comprising:<br>
(a)	admixing an ionizable pharmaceutical agent with the one or more complementary lipophilic species to form a lipophilic association (LA);<br>
(b)	optionally solubilizing the LA with a solvent having a thelectric constant less than that of water to form a solubilized LA;<br>
(c)	optionally admixing the LA or solubilized LA with a carrier such that the LA or solubilized LA is adsorbed or absorbed to the carrier to form a sorbed material; and<br>
(d)	formulating the LA, solubilized LA, or sorbed material into a transmucosal dosage form.<br><br>
11.	A pharmaceutical composition as claimed in any of claims 1-10 in the manufacture of a medicament for use in therapy by delivering the pharmaceutical agent through a targeted mucosal membrane and into systemic circulation.<br>
12.	The pharmaceutical composition as claimed in claim 12, wherein the mucosal membrane is oral mucosal membrane.<br>
13.	The pharmaceutical composition as claimed in claim 12 or claim 13, wherein the ionizable pharmaceutical agent is nicotine, and wherein the therapy is nicotine replacement therapy.<br><br>
Disclosed are preparations and formulations of high thermodynamic activity lipophilic associations (LA), in which there is pairing between an ionizable pharmaceutical agent and a lipophilic species having ionic characteristics opposite to that of the pharmaceutical agent Such lipophilic associations manifest high thermodynamic activity, as evidenced by their being predominantly in a liquid phase at room temperature or solvated in a lower-than-water thelectric solvent Farther the pharmaceutical agent being solubilized means that dissolution is not rate limiting to transmucosal absorption. This LA or LA-solvate is formulated into a low thelectric dosage form, from whence, upon the dosage form's hydration, the pharmaceutical agent is driven through the mucosal tissue and into systemic circulation. The invention therefore provides an enhanced transmocosal drug delivery system for ionizable pharmaceutical agents at or near physiological pH.</td>
