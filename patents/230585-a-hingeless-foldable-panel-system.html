				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the hingeless foldable panel. In particularly, this invention relates to the hingeless device and its mechanism, required to be folded and unfolded, more particularly, it relates to the hingeless device and its mechanism, required to be folded to save the space occupied by the device during transportation and subsequently to be unfolded at the site of installation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THEINVENTION:<br>
The structural members, required to be designed for folding and subsequently deployment operations, are generally termed as collapsable structures, herein after referred as device. The most commonly known such device is the umbrella, which is folded and unfolded as and when required. Another example of such device is that of bridges, which are also folded during the transportation, mainly for the convenience<br>
and to save the space occupied during the transportation, and unfolded during deployment at the desired site. Still another example of such collapsable structures is that of the foldable and unfoldable doors of the lift, which are folded and unfolded to allow the passengers to enter in and come out. Still further an example of such device is that of the folding hand fan. Yet another an example of such a device is that of the door closure, which helps openning and closing of the doors. Still further an example of such a device is that of the ladders with trolley used by the fire fighting personnels and by the personnels of the public works departments.<br>
The examples stated above use one or the other means and the mechanism for the folding and unfolding the said device. Such means and mechanisms thereof are either too simple, like that of umbrella, hand fans, doors of lifts and spiral bound book or magzine etc, which are not suitable to be used for the heavy engineering structures; or complicated, like that of ladders with trolley and door closures etc, which are not reliable; or too complicated, like that of bridges etc, which are difficult and expensive to construct and are not reliable and convenient in operation. Such konwn means and mechanisms generally comprise of at least one hinge of the lower pair type.<br>
The major drawback of the hinge arrangement and mechanism thereof is that of the friction at the joining part of the two parts connected through the hinge, which adds in the maintainance cost and also results in wear and tear of the hinge, and the latter may finaHy result in the failure of the mechanism.<br>
This drawback can not be overcome fully. However, it can be overcome partially by lubrication of the hinges to avoid the wear and tear of the same. The lubrication further adds to the drawbacks of its own, particularly of making the system untidy.<br>
Another drawback of the hinge arrangement and mechanism thereof is that the two parts connected through the hinge are not prefectly packed, that is the gap is generally left over, which in-tum adds to the extra space and volume.<br>
Still another drawback of the hinge arrangement and mechanism thereof is that the auto-unfolding of the parts connected through the hinge is not possible. To overcome this drawback, the arrangement of the spring structure becomes essential, which has disadvantages of its own, like constructional complexity of device, failure over a period of time, adding to further weight and cost.<br>
To overcome the drawback of the arrangement of the spring structures the hydraulic mechanism has been used by many. But this arrangement also has more or less similar disadvantages as that of the spring and hinge arrangements.<br>
The means and mechanism of folding and unfolding of the devices, like bridges and ladders with trolley, although suitable for the light and heavy structures, but have various drawbacks, in-addition to the drawbacks stated herein above.<br>
The major drawback of such means and mechanism of folding and unfolding of the devices is that the reliability of the deployment is poor, which mainly is due to the reason that the means of folding and unfolding may jam. The jaming of such means is due to the snag in the mechanism and/or failure to receive or to provide the deployment command.<br>
Another drawback of such means and mechanism of folding and unfolding of the devices is that the system is complex and expensive, particularly In veiw of the attempt to improve the reliability. Such system generally comprises the hydraulic system and mechanism thereof, as stated herein above. In-addition, such systems may comprise the controller device and mechanism thereof, if the auto-folding and auto-unfolding operation is the requirement.<br>
Still another drawback of such known devices is that of the significant weight penalty due to the complexity of the deployment mechanism. Such addition of weight limits their use in the space applications.<br>
The process of launching and installation of the space structures demands an extremely efficient scheme of storage of the structures and their transportation to the stage of launching, wherein these structured are unfolded and installed. The reason for requirement of such an efficient system is that a launch vehicle has to pass through the atmosphere and therefore, its external surface must be designed with stringent constraints imposed by aerodynamics. This dictates that the space structure<br>
to be installed be kept in a folded state as part of the rocket payload. The problem is complicated further by the fact that many space structures possess a large area in their expanded form, that is in their operational conditions. Mostly such structures comprises of flat structures required to be folded during transportation and unfolded at the time of deployment. It is understood, that the simple means and mechanisms for folding and unfolding of such structures, as known in the prior art, are not suitable for such structures. Similarly, the complicated means and mechanisms adds to the weight of such structures, which is undesirable and are complex to construct and unreliable, as described herein above.<br>
The drawbacks and the disadvantages associated with the known means and mechanisms of the known folding and unfolding devices are not only limited to the space structures, but also to other such structures, like umbrella, door closures, bridges etc., as described herein above.<br>
The major drawback of such known means and mechanisms of such known devices is that the elimination of the hinge and/or spring and/or hydraulic arrangements results in the failure of the folding and unfolding mechanism of such devices, as described herein above.<br>
NEED OF THE INVENTION :<br>
Therefore, ther is a need to have a novel means and mechanism for the folding and unfolding of the device, which is required to be folded during the transportation to<br>
save the space and for convenience of transportation and unfolded at the time of deployment, and can overcome the drawbacks and disadvantages of the hinge, spring and hydraulic means and mechanisms of the prior art, as described herein above or can totally eliminate the use of the hinge and/or spring and/or hydraulic arrangements and still does not result in the failure of the folding and unfolding mechanism of such devices or structures, as referred herein above.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE PRESENT INVENTION :<br>
This is the main object of the present invention to provide an hingeless foldable and unfoldable device and mechanism thereof, in particularly, an hingeless device, required to be folded and unfolded, more particularly, the hingless device, required to be folded to save the space occupied by the device during transportation and subsequently to be unfolded at the site of installation, and its mechanism, which can overcome the drawbacks and disadvantages of the hinge, spring and hydraulic means and mechanisms of the prior art by totally eliminating the use of such arrangements.<br>
This is another an object of this invention to propose for a foldable and unfoldable device and mechanism thereof, as stated herein above, which does not comprise of any hinge means and mechanism thereof. Hence eliminates all the drawbacks and disadvantages of the hinge arrangement.<br>
This is yet another an object of the present invention to propose for an hingeless foldable and unfoldable device and mechanism thereof, as stated herein<br>
above, which does not comprise of any spring structure and hence overcome all the drawbacks and the disadvantages of the spring arrangement.<br>
Still another an object of the present invention is to propose for an hingeless foldable and unfoldable device and mechanism thereof, as stated herein above, which does not comprise of any hydraulic means and mechanism and hence overcome all the drawbacks and the disadvantages of such an arrangement.<br>
