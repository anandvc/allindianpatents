				<td>4,5-Dihvdro-1H-pvrazole derivatives having CB,-antaqonistic activity<br>
The  present invention relates  to a group of novel  4,5-dihydro~1 H-pyrazole<br>
derivatives,  to  methods  for the  preparation  of these  compounds,   and  to<br>
pharmaceutical compositions containing one or more of these compounds as an<br>
active component.<br>
The above mentioned 4,5-dihydro-1 H-pyrazoles are potent Cannabis-1  (CB,)<br>
receptor antagonists with utility for the treatment of psychiatric and neurological<br>
disorders.<br>
Cannabinoids are present in the Indian hemp Cannabis Sativa L. and have been used as medicinal agents for centuries (Mechoulam, R.; Feigenbaum, J.J. Prog. Med. Chem. 1987, 24, 159). However, only within the past ten years the research in the cannabinoid area has revealed pivotal information on cannabinoid receptors and their (endogenous) agonists and antagonists. The discovery and the subsequent cloning of two different subtypes of Cannabinoid receptors (CB, and CBZ) stimulated the search for novel cannabinoid receptor antagonists (Munro, S.; Thomas, K.L.; Abu-Shaar, M. Nature 1993, 365, 61. Matsuda, LA.; Bonner, T.I. Cannabinoid Receptors, Pertwee, R.G. Ed. 1995, 117, Academic Press, London). In addition, pharmaceutical companies became interested in the development of cannabinoid drugs for the treatment of diseases connected with disorders of the cannabinoid system. The wide distribution of CB, receptors in the brain, in combination with the strictly peripheral localisation of the CB2 receptor, makes the CB, receptor a very interesting molecular target for CNS-directed drug discovery in the areas of both psychiatric and neurological disorders (Consroe, P. Neurobiology of Disease 1998, 5, 534. Pop, E. Curr. Opin. in CPNS Investigational Drugs 1999, 1, 587. Greenberg, D.A. Drug News Perspect. 1999, 12, 458). Hitherto, three types of distinct CB, receptor antagonists are known. Sanofi disclosed their diarylpyrazoie congeners as selective CB, receptor antagonists. A representative example is SR-141716A, which is currently undergoing Phase ll clinical development for psychotic disorders (Dutta, A.K.; Sard, H.; Ryan, W.; Razdan, R.K.; Compton, D.R.; Martin, B.R. Med. Chem. Res.<br>
1994,	5, 54. Ian, R.; Liu, Q.; Fan, P.: Lin, S.; Fernando, S.R.; McCallion, D.;<br>
Pertwee, R.; Makriyannis, A. J. Med. Chem. 1999, 42, 769. Nakamura-Palacios,<br>
E.M.; Moerschbaecher, J.M.; Barker, L.A. CNS Drug Rev. 1999, 5, 43).<br>
Aminoalkylindoies have been disclosed as CB, receptor antagonists. A<br>
representative example is lodopravadoline (AM-630), which was introduced in<br>
1995.	AM-630 is a CB, receptor antagonist, but sometimes behaves as a weak<br><br>
partial agonist (Hosohata, K.; Quock, R.M.; Hosohata, Y. Burkey, T.H.; Makriyannis, A.; Consroe, p.; Roeske, W.R.; Yamamura, H.I. Lite Sc. 1997, 61, PL115). More recently, researchers from Eli Lilly described aryf-aroyl substituted benzofurans as selective CB, receptor antagonists (e.g. LY-320135) (Felder, C.C.; Joyce, K.E.; Briley, E.J.; Glass, M.; Mackie. K.P.; Fahey. K.J.; Cullinan, G.J.; Hunden, D.C.; Johnson, D.W.; Chaney, M.O.; Koppel, G.A.; Brownstein, M. J. Pharmacol. Exp. Thar. 1998, 284, 291). Recently, 3-alkyl-5,5'-diphenylimidazolidinediones were described as cannabinoid receptor ligands, which were indicated to be cannabinoid antagonists (Kanyonyo, M.; Govaerts, S.J.; Hermans, E.; Poupaert, J.H., Lambert, D.M. Biorg. Med.Chem. Left 1999, 9, 2233). Interestingly, many CB, receptor antagonists have been reported to behave as inverse agonists in vitro (Landsman, R.S.; Burkey, T.H.; Consroe, P.; Roeske, W.R.; Yamamura, H.I. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1997, 334, R1). Recent reviews provide a nice overview of the current status in the cannabinoid research area (Mechoulam, R.; Hanus, L.; Fride, E. Prog. Med. Chem. 1998, 35, 199. Lambert, D.M. Curt. Med. Chem. 1999, 6, 635. Mechoulam, R.; Fride, E.; Di Marzo, V. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 1998,359,1).<br>
It has now surprisingly been found that the novel 4,5-dihydro-1H-pyrazole derivatives of the formula (]),<br><br>
wherein<br>
-	R and R, are the same or different and represent phenyl," thtenyl or pyridyl which groups may be substituted with 1, 2 or 3 substituents Y, which can be the same or different, from the group C^-alkyi or alkoxy, hydroxy, halogen, trifluoromethyl, trifluoromethylthio, trifluoromethoxy, n'ttro, amino, mono- or dlalkyl (CjJ-amino, mono- or dialkyl (C,j)-amido, (C,J-alkyl sulfonyl, dimethylsuifamido, C1-alkoxycarbonyl, carboxyl, trifluoromethylsulfonyl, cyano. carbamoyl, sulfamoyl and acetyl, or R and/or R, represent naphtyi,<br>
-	Ra represents hydrogen, hydroxy, C3-alkoxy, acetyloxy or propionyloxy,<br>
-	Aa represent one of the groups 0), II). W, flv) or (v)<br><br><br>
wherein<br>
-	R« and R$ independently of each other represent hydrogen or C,^<br>
branched or unbranched alkyl or CM cycloaikyl or R« represents<br>
acetamido or dimethylamino or 2,2,2-trifluoroethyl or phenyl or pyridyl<br>
with the proviso that Rs represents hydrogen<br>
-	Re represents hydrogen or C,^ unbranched alkyl<br>
-	6b represents sutfonyl or carbonyl,<br>
-	R3 represents benzyt, phenyl, thienyl or pyridyl which may be substituted with<br>
1, 2 or 3 substituents Y, which can be the same or different, or R3 represents<br>
C,^ branched or unbranched alkyl or C^cycloaikyl, or R3 represents naphtyl<br>
are potent and selective antagonists of the cannabis CBrreceptor.<br>
Due to the potent CB, antagonistic activity the compounds according to the invention are suitable for use in the treatment of psychiatric disorders such as psychosis, anxiety, depression, attention deficits, memory disorders and appetite disorders, obesity, neurological disorders such as dementia, distonia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, epilepsy, Huntington's disease, Tourette's syndrome, cerebral iscbaemia, as well as for the treatment of pain disorders and other CNS-diseases involving cannabinoid neurotransmission, and in the treatment of gastrointestinal disorders and cardiovascular disorders.<br>
The affinity of the compounds of the invention for cannabinoid CB, receptors was determined using membrane preparations of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells in which the human cannabis CB, receptor is stably transfected in conjunction with [3H]CP-55,940 as radioligand. After incubation of a freshly prepared cell membrane preparation with the [3H]-ligand, with or without addition of compounds of the invention, separation of bound and free ligand was performed by filtration over glassfiber filters.   Radioactivity  on  the filter was  measured  by  liquid<br><br>
scintillation counting.<br>
The cannabinoid CB, antagonistic activity of compounds of the invention was determined by functional studies using CHO cells in which human cannabinoid CB, receptors are stably expressed. Adenylyl cyclase was stimulated using forskolin and measured by quantifying the amount of accumulated cyclic AMP. Concomitant activation of CB, receptors by CB, receptor agonists (e.g. CP-55,940 or (R)-WIN-55,212-2) can attenuate the forskolin-induced accumulation of cAMP in a concentration-dependent manner. This CB, receptor-mediated response can be antagonised by CB, receptor antagonists such as the compounds of the invention.<br>

Example I 3-(4-ChlorophenyI)-4,5-dfhydro-4-hydroxy-4-phenyl-1H-pyrazoie<br>
2-(4-Chiorobenzoyl)-2-phenyloxirane (112 gram, 0.43 mol) is dissolved in ethanol (650 ml) at 35 °C. To the resulting stirred solution is added N2H4.HzO (42 ml) and the formed 3-(4-chlorophenyl)4.5-diriydro-4-hydroxy-4-phenyl-1H-pyrazoie slowly precipitates. After standing for 16 hours the crystalline material is collected by filtration   and   successively  washed   with   ethanol,   water  and   ethanol   and<br><br>
subsequently dried to give 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4.5-dihydro-4-hydroxy-*-phenyl-1H-pyrazole (92 gram, 78 % yield). Melting point: 195-196 °C.<br>
Example II<br>
3-(4-Chlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-N-{{4-fluorophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-1 -carboxamidine<br>
Part A: A stirred mixture of 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-4-phenyl-1 H-pyrazole (5.13 gram, 20.0 mmol), 2-methyl-2-thiopseudourea hydroiodide (5.00 gram, 23.0 mmol) and pyridine (10 ml) is heated at 110 °C for 1 hour. After one night standing at room temperature diethyl ether is added and the precipitate is collected by filtration. This precipitate is washed three times with diethyl ether portions to afford a solid (9 gram). Melting point: -230 °C. This solid is dissolved in methanol (20 ml). To the resulting solution is successively added a 2N sodium hydroxide solution (12 ml) and water (200 ml). The formed precipitate is collected by filtration, washed two times with diethyl ether and successively with diisopropyl ether. The resulting solid is dried in vacuo to yield 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-4-phenyl-1 H-pyrazole-1 -carboxamidine (5.1 gram, 88 % yield). Melting point: 187-189°C.<br>
Part B: To a stirred mixture of 3-(4-chlorophenyl)-4,5-dihydro-4-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine (0.50 gram, 1.68 mmol) and 4-fluorophenylsulfonyl chloride (0.34 gram, 1.75 mmol) in acetonitrite (10 ml) is added N,N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine (0.020 gram, 0.175 mmol) and triethyiamine (1 ml). The resulting solution is stirred at room temperature for 30 minutes. After addition of a 2N sodium hydroxide solution and extraction with ethylacetate (400 ml), the ethylacetate layer is concentrated in vacuo. The resulting crude residue is further purified by means of flash chromatography (petroleum ether/diethyl ether = 1/1 (v/v), followed by ethylacetate). Subsequent concentration in vacuo affords solid 3-(4-dilorophenyt)-4,5-dihydro-N-((4-ftuorophenyl)sulfonyl)-4-phenyl-1H-pyrazole-1-carboxamidine (0.55 gram, 72 % yield). Melting point: 214-215 °C<br>
