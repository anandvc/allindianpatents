Description<br>
FREQUENCY SPECTRUM CONVERSION TO NATURAL<br>
HARMONIC FREQUENCIES PROCESS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[1]	Harmonic studies of frequency sets related to nature, natural events (phenomena),<br>
elements, astronomy, mathematics, and human form have been useful in identification<br>
of vibrations related to science, mechanics, medicine, psychology and human<br>
functions.<br>
[2]	Two common aspects of frequency sets are music and musical scales.<br>
[3]	The standard musical frequency for the fourth octave of 'A' in musical instruments<br>
such as the piano is presently 440Hz (Hz = cycles per standard second). Equal<br>
temperament into a l/12th interval is the way that all modern keyboard instruments are<br>
manufactured. This standard has been in use throughout the 20th century. However,<br>
this choice is not necessarily correct or harmonically tuned to nature.<br>
[4]	Scientific author, Isaac Asimov, has stated that music is made of musical intervals,<br>
(octaves, fourths, fifths, etc.) The exact frequency and exact harmonic sets are not the<br>
basis of music; it is the alternation of intervals that is perceived as a melody and<br>
harmonic chord structure. The choice of A=440Hz for the calibration of music is to a<br>
degree arbitrary.<br>
[5]	Composers and performers of the past had no such standards. A Mozart or Bach<br>
would simply listen to a note and intuitively decide that it sounded 'right' to them with<br>
the choice made; they would have all the players of the ensemble adjust to the chosen<br>
tuning. This method was satisfactory for most early instrumental families. The in-<br>
troduction of polyphonic keyboard instruments such as the harpsichord and later the<br>
piano presented a new problem with intuitive tunings. The numerous individual strings<br>
were too difficult to adjust quickly, and therefore the need for standard tuning arose.<br>
To facilitate the need for standards, we use A=440Hz today.<br>
[6]	But, what of tunings that seemed natural to these composers of centuries ago?<br>
Many other cultures do not use western methods of tuning. Was there something lost<br>
with the creation of modern standards? Remember, music is defined by intervals not<br>
necessarily frequency. Is there a 'right or correct' note?<br>
[7]	In 1975 researcher Wesley H. Bateman began studies of many ancient building<br>
sites world wide, particularly the Great Pyramid of Giza, Egypt. This work has<br>
spanned the last 25 years, from which he has rediscovered the mathematical system<br>
used by the original architects in defining the measurements of all aspects of the<br>
ancient structure. He has titled this system The Ra System (© 1987) and the units of<br>
measure derived from it the 'Rods of Amon Ra' (© 1987), named for the ancient<br>
Egyptian sun god 'Amon Ra.' In fact the Ra System of mathematics has proven to be<br>
the natural system of mathematics which nature uses to describe itself. Among the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/130867	PCT/US2006/021584<br>
2<br>
mathematical properties contained in the "Ra System' are formats of frequency and<br>
resonance that relate to nature and natural events. These are mathematically perfect<br>
sets that are used by nature. Presently, we know of nine Ra mathematical formats.<br>
. Each format has its own version for all of the known mathematical constants such as:<br>
Pi, Phi, Balmer constant for hydrogen, Rydberg constant for hydrogen, and the speed<br>
of light - to name just a few.<br>
[8]	In the fall of 1975, while engaged in e.e.g. biofeedback research Bateman came<br>
upon a scientific paper written by Drs. C. Polk and F. Fitchen of the University of<br>
Rhode Island. The paper was titled: 'The Schumann Resonances of the Earth-<br>
Ionosphere Cavity - Extremely Low Frequency Reception at Kingston Rhode Island.'<br>
The report can be found in the Journal of Research of the National Bureau of<br>
Standards - D Radio Propagation - Vol. 66D, No. 3, May - June, 1962.<br>
[9]	That paper described the instrumentation that was used at the time to receive and<br>
record extremely low frequency electromagnetic wave trains (elf waves) that are a by-<br>
product of lightning strikes occurring all over the Earth. The elf waves are contained<br>
within the natural resonance cavity (wave-guide) composed of the surface of the Earth<br>
and the 'D' layer of the ionosphere. The resonance cavity of the Earth is analogous to<br>
the resonance cavity of a guitar or violin.<br>
[10]	His interest in lightning generated elf waves was heightened when he realized that<br>
the waves had the same frequencies, frequency averages and wave shapes (envelopes)<br>
as do human brain waves. The frequency range of the elf waves is between 0.02 cycles<br>
per second (Hz) and 13.5 Hz. The most frequently occurring elf wave frequency is<br>
10.6 Hz. The frequency of 10.6 Hz is very important to the present invention.<br>
[11]	The human brain produces 4 distinct brain wave patterns that are named after letters<br>
from the Greek alphabet. These brain wave patterns along with their frequencies are<br>
described below:<br>
[12]	Delta: 0.02 Hz up to and including 3 Hz. A person who is either asleep or un-<br>
conscious produces delta brain waves.<br>
[13]	Theta: 3 Hz up to and including 7 Hz. A person who is either asleep or unconscious<br>
also generates Theta waves. Theta waves have been linked to the state of dreaming that<br>
is accompanied by 'rapid eye movement' (REM sleep). Hyperactive children have been<br>
known to produce Theta waves while awake.<br>
[14]	Alpha: 7 Hz up to and including 13.5 Hz. Alpha brain waves are generated when a<br>
person is relaxed or in a state of meditation.<br>
[15]	Beta : 13.5 Hz. to 27 Hz. A person produces Beta waves when awake and totally<br>
aware of the world around them. Brain waves above 27 Hz. are known to occur on<br>
occasion and are called 'High Beta.'<br>
[16]	The most frequently generated Alpha brain wave produced by a meditating person<br>
is 10.6 Hz. As stated above, 10.6 Hz is also the most frequently occurring lightning<br>
generated elf wave. In addition, the last frequency of Alpha brain waves and the first<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/130867	PCT/US2006/021584<br>
3<br>
ceiling frequency of the elf waves are in both cases 13.5 Hz. In October 1975, Wes<br>
Bateman discovered a relationship between these frequencies and the mathematical<br>
constant Pi (3.1415926). The ratio of 10.6 Hz to 13.5 Hz is 0.785185185, The ratio<br>
0.785185185 is almost directly proportional to Pi (3.1415926), i.e., 0.785185185 x 4 =<br>
3.1407407. This relationship demonstrates that brain wave frequencies are Pi-based.<br>
[17]	Similar to the relationship between alpha brain wave/elf wave frequencies and the<br>
mathematical constant Pi, Wes Bateman also discovered a proportional relationship<br>
between the last frequency of Alpha brain waves or the first ceiling frequency of the<br>
elf wave phenomenon (which is in both cases 13.5 cycles per n.s.t.) and the<br>
mathematical constant Phi. When 13.5 cycles per n.s.t. is multiplied by 12 the result is<br>
1.62. This result is very close in value to the number 1.61803389 (Phi). Phi and its<br>
associated Fibonacci ratios are found in the proportions and shapes of every living<br>
thing, including humans.<br>
[18]	The above proportional relationships led Mr. Bateman to the conclusion that our<br>
brains function on the order of Pi and our bodies are proportioned on the order of Phi.<br>
Knowing that both Pi and Phi are well known constants that relate to the geometry of<br>
the Great Pyramid of Giza, Mr. Bateman under took a full time 25-year study of the<br>
ancient structure. This long term study led to the discovery of the Ra System of<br>
mathematics.<br>
[19]	The Nine Known Ra formats<br>
[20]	While studying the geometry of the Great Pyramid of Egypt Wes Bateman en-<br>
countered several numbers that were close in value to the square root of 2. These<br>
numbers were: 1.41371666 - - - and 1.414710633. Note that 1.41371666 - - - x<br>
1.414710633 = 2. These numbers were arbitrarily named Red and Blue numbers. The<br>
actual value of the square root of 2 is 1.414213562. This value was then named a<br>
Green number; Red, Blue and Green being the basic constituents of the color white.<br>
[21]	After considerable research it was realized that the Ra System of Mathematics<br>
consists of at least 9 formats. The names of the nine known Ra formats and their<br>
related values of Pi are as follows: Omega Major; Alpha Major; Hydrogen Major;<br>
Blue; Green; Red; Hydrogen Minor; Alpha Minor; and Omega Minor. There is a re-<br>
lationship between each of the mirror image formats (Omega Major/Omega Minor -<br>
Alpha Major/Alpha Minor - Hydrogen Major/Hydrogen Minor - Blue/Red) and the<br>
central format (Green).<br>
[22]	For the sake of brevity 5 values for the square root of 2 and five values for Pi are<br>
seen in the chart below:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
WO 2006/130867	PCT/US2006/021584<br>
4<br>
 <br>
[23]	The names corresponding values of Pi for each of the nine Ra formats are as<br>
follows:<br>
[24]	Omega Major: 3.160493830<br>
[25]	Alpha Major: 3.156746446<br>
[26]	Hydrogen Major: 3.14928<br>
[27]	Blue: 3.143801409<br>
[28]	Green: 3.142696807<br>
[29]	Red: 3.141592592---<br>
[30]	Hydrogen Minor: 3.136127372<br>
[31]	Alpha Minor: 3.128709695<br>
[32]	Omega Minor: 3.125<br>
[33]	Note: Omega Minor Pi x Omega Major Pi = 9.87654321 (Green Pi squared) or Red<br>
Pi x Blue Pi = 9.87654321 (Green Pi squared). The Green format is the central format.<br>
[34]	From the list above, the ratios that relate one format to another can be easily<br>
calculated by multiplying the corresponding related values (i.e., Major/Minor or Blue/<br>
Red) and comparing the number to the square of Green Pi.<br>
[35]	In the Ra system of mathematics, the units of measurement are the Ram (which ap-<br>
proximates the meter in size), the Ra foot (1/3 of a Ram), and Ra inches (1/12 of a Ra<br>
foot and 1/40 of a Ram). As will be explained below, there are different Rams for each<br>
Ra format.<br>
[36]	When dealing with frequencies one is dealing with time (cycles per second). Mr.<br>
Bateman's studies led to the realization that nature uses a unit of time - or natural se<br>
cond of time (n.s.t.) - that is slightly longer in duration than the standard second we<br>
presently employ. In the Ra System of Mathematics, the speed of light is 300,000.00<br>
Omega Major kilorams per n.s.t. The speed of light in kilometers has been measured<br>
and found to be 299,792.456081 kilometers per standard second (+/- 1m). Therefore<br>
the duration of the n.s.t. is 1.000692286 standard seconds in length. This ratio is used<br>
to convert Ra musical frequencies from cycles per n.s.t. to cycles per standard second<br>
of time.<br>
[37]	Using this conversion from standard seconds to n.s.t., the average Alpha brain wave<br>
or average elf wave frequency is 10.602875 cycles per n.s.t. Employing the same re-<br>
lationship to Pi demonstrated above, the ratio of 10.602875 cycles per n.s.t. to 13.5 Hz<br>
■ =0.7853981481-and-0.7853981481 x 4 = 3.141592592.<br>
[38]	The numbers: 10.602875 and 3.141592592 - - - are Red numbers. In fact, as will be<br>
described more fully below, 106.02875 cycles per n.s.t. (about 10 times the average<br>
Alpha brain wave or average elf wave frequency) is the second octave of Red 'A'.<br>
[39]	The Ra formats apply not only to frequencies, but to electronic waves, broadcast<br>
frequency, computer systems, wave structures, biorhythms, brain waves, bio-electrical<br>
functions, botany, Earth and astronomical sciences. Other possible applications include<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/130867	PCT/US2006/021584<br>
artificial intelligence, computer sciences, broadcast, entertainment, space-time, human<br>
and veterinary medicine, chemistry, biology, botanical-agriculture (both land and sea),<br>
mining, manufacturing, aviation, air, sea and space navigation, communications -<br>
terrestrial / space, Earth and astronomical sciences. The relevance of each application<br>
is still to be determined. These discoveries are truly 'Universal'.<br>
[40]	Accordingly, it is an object of this invention to provide a unique process to convert<br>
frequencies of standard musical notes into frequencies having a greater appeal to a<br>
listener.<br>
[41]	It is a further object to provide a device incorporating this process.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[42]	This present invention comprises an electronic device - called the 'Pyramid<br>
Processor' - and a corresponding method that converts musical notes from standard<br>
frequencies to Ra format frequencies. The conversion of standard musical notes<br>
measured in cycles per standard seconds to Ra musical notes measured in cycles per<br>
standard seconds is based on two very important factors:<br>
[43]	1. The ratios that exist between the various Ra formats that raise the converted<br>
music to a higher level of mathematical harmony and listening pleasure (evident either<br>
as a single Ra format or when the same note of 2, 3 or more different Ra formats are<br>
layered and heard simultaneously). This is a unique change from standard tone music<br>
which has only 1 frequency for each note on the standard 'A - 440' scale.<br>
[44]	2. The unique electronic functions built into the Pyramid Processor that assure that<br>
the converted standard musical tones are a true representation of the Ra tones<br>
measured in cycles per standard seconds and thus identical to Ra tones that could<br>
otherwise be measured exactly in natural seconds.<br>
[45]	The apparatus for converting the frequency of standard musical notes to a cor-<br>
responding frequency of Ra format musical notes comprises a processor having a<br>
signal input port and a signal output port, means for converting the frequency of<br>
standard musical notes to a corresponding frequency of Ra musical notes, means for<br>
selecting a Ra format natural harmonic resonance, and a frequency analyzer. The<br>
means for converting may comprise a software program or a hardware configuration<br>
containing all Ra format natural harmonic resonances. The means for selecting a Ra<br>
format natural harmonic resonance may comprise means for selecting two or more Ra<br>
format natural harmonic resonances and may comprise a switch, a dial, or multiple<br>
buttons having positions corresponding to each of the nine Ra formats. The apparatus<br>
may be connected to an audio device, i.e., a tuner or a computer, for transmission of a<br>
signal of standard musical notes and receipt of a signal of converted Ra format musical<br>
notes. The apparatus may also comprise means for recording an output signal, i.e., tape<br>
recorder, CD burner, computer hard drive,<br>
[46]	The process for converting standard musical notes to Ra format musical notes<br>
comprises inputting a signal of standard musical notes, each note having a frequency,<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/130867	PCT/US2006/021584<br>
analyzing the frequency of each note in the signal of standard musical notes, selecting<br>
a Ra format natural harmonic resonance, converting the frequency of each note in the<br>
signal standard musical notes to a frequency of Ra format musical notes corresponding<br>
to the selected Ra format natural harmonic resonance, and outputting a signal of Ra<br>
format musical notes consisting of each of the converted notes. The process may<br>
further comprise a step of analyzing the frequency of each of the converted notes prior<br>
to the outputting step. The input signal may be either analog or digital, but an analog<br>
signal should be converted to a digital signal before converting the notes to a Ra<br>
format. The process may involve the conversion of signals of standard musical notes<br>
consisting of two or more audio channels which are each converted to a Ra format.<br>
The two or more audio channels of an output signal of Ra format musical notes may be<br>
layered as different audio channels are commonly layered, i.e., stereo, surround, etc.<br>
[47]	Where as the two factors are essential for the hardware of the Pyramid Processor to<br>
electronically convert standard note music frequencies to Ra standard note music<br>
frequencies - no other variation of these factors will permit the Pyramid Processor or<br>
another device to do so. These factors form the basis for either a hard wired program<br>
or a software program that provides the same data to any variation of the Pyramid<br>
Processor.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
[55]	In the case of Ra music there are 9 frequency values for the 'A' musical tone, 9<br>
values for the 'B' musical tone etc. That is: Red 'A', Green 'A', Blue 'A', Omega Major<br>
'A', Omega Minor 'A', Hydrogen Major 'A', Hydrogen Minor 'A', Alpha Major 'A', and<br>
Alpha Minor 'A'. The frequency of Red 'A' x the frequency of Blue 'A' equals the<br>
frequency of Green 'A' squared. This rule is true for any 2 mirror format values of 'A'<br>
or for any other Ra musical tones which are located in their respective mirrored<br>
formats.<br>
 <br>

[56]	When Johann Sebastian Bach laid out the even-tempered clavichord he intuitively<br>
separated the notes by Ra value ratios. Therefore Bach's ratios are perfectly valid for<br>
the 9 Ra musical scales. The Bach Ratios are:<br>
 <br>
[57]	The conversion of standard musical notes measured in cycles per standard seconds<br>
to Ra musical notes measured in cycles per standard seconds is based on two very<br>
important factors:<br>
[58]	1. The ratios that exist between the various Ra formats that raise the converted<br>
music to a higher level of mathematical harmony and listening pleasure (evident either<br>
as a single Ra format or when the same note of 2, 3 or more different Ra formats are<br>
layered and heard simultaneously). This is a unique change from standard tone music<br>
which has only 1 frequency for each note on the standard 'A - 440' scale.<br>
[59]	2. The unique electronic functions built into the Pyramid Processor that assure that<br>
the converted standard musical tones are a true representation of the Ra tones<br>
measured in cycles per standard seconds and thus identical to Ra tones that could<br>
otherwise be measured exactly in natural seconds.<br>
[60]	Using the Ra System of mathematics and the formulas described above, the<br>
conversion ratios presented in FIG. 3 and reproduced below, may be used to convert<br>
any octave of'A' in A440 to the corresponding Ra format:<br>
 <br>
[61 ]	Then, the Bach ratios described above may be used to convert the 'A' in Ra format<br>
to any other note, i.e., 'B', 'C, 'D', 'E', 'F', or 'G'.<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/130867	PCT/US2006/021584<br>
8<br>
[62]	The above conversion ratios are determined by calculating the frequency of a note<br>
as defined in the Ra system and generating the ratio for ease of repeatability.<br>
Calculating the frequency of a note as defined in the Ra system is accomplished in the<br>
following manner.<br>
[63]	To calculate the frequency for each note in a Ra format, one must roll out a Pi<br>
wheel having the corresponding Ra format unit diameter as depicted in FIG. 1. The<br>
distance laid out per degree of the circle is used in a calculation to determine a cor-<br>
responding note frequency in Ra format.<br>
[64]	For example, as shown in FIG. 1, the length of the circumference of a wheel with 1<br>
Red unit diameter is 3.141592592 - - - Red units (Red Pi). The distance traveled over a<br>
certain number of degrees corresponds to a specific octave of a particular note. The<br>
number of degrees for the 1st octave of each note are as follows:<br>
 <br>
[65]	The corresponding distances traveled for each of these degrees of rotation for each<br>
of the nine Ra formats are shown in FIGS. 2A through 21. Mathematically, the<br>
distances are calculated by dividing the number of degrees by 360 and multiplying that<br>
value by the value of Pi for the corresponding Ra format. In the case of FIG. 1 and<br>
referring to FIG. 2E, the distance traveled for note 'C' is 72.9° + 360° x Red<br>
Pi(3.141592	), which equals 0.6361725. One hundred times any of these distance<br>
values gives the corresponding Ra format frequency for that note in the first octave.<br>
For the 1st octave of Red 'C', this value is 63.61725 cycles per second.<br>
[66]	Each successive octave is obtained by multiplying the frequency of the previous<br>
octave by 2, i.e., 1st octave Red 'C' is 63.61725 Hz and the 2nd octave Red 'C' is<br>
127.2345 Hz. In addition, each successive octave may be calculated by multiplying the<br>
degrees to obtain the successive octave, i.e., the second octave of 'C' is 145.8° (72.9° x<br>
2) and the third octave of 'C' is 291.6° (145.8° x 2). However, due to the large number<br>
of decimal places, calculating successive octaves by the later method increases<br>
mathematical error.<br>
[67]	The 4th octave of D' is 656.1 (2^3 x 82.0125) degrees of rotation. There are 656.1<br>
Ra milli-microns in the Balmer m3 spectral line of hydrogen (visible).<br>
[68]	The 6th octave of 'D' is 2624.4 (2^5 x. 82.0125) degrees of rotation. There are<br>
2624.4 Ra milli-microns in the Brackett m3 spectral line for hydrogen (deep infra red).<br>
 <br>

9<br>
[69]	The 3rd octave of 'E' is 364.5 (2^2 x 91.125) degrees of rotation. The Balmer<br>
Constant is 91.125.<br>
[70]	The 1st octave of 'F' is 97.2 degrees of rotation. There are 97.2 Ra milli-microns in<br>
the Lyman m4 spectral line of hydrogen (visible).<br>
[71]	The 2nd octave of 'F' is 194.4 (2^1 x 97.2) degrees of rotation. There are 194.4 Ra<br>
milli-microns in the Brackett m8 spectral line of hydrogen (deep infra red).<br>
[72]	The 3rd octave of 'F' is 388.8 (2^2 x 97.2) degrees of rotation. There are 388.8 Ra<br>
milli-microns in the Balmer m8 spectral line of hydrogen (visible).<br>
[73]	The 1st octave of 'G' is 109.35 degrees of rotation. There are 109.35 Ra milli-<br>
microns in the Paschen m6 spectral line of hydrogen (near infra red).<br>
[74]	The 4th octave of A is 486 (2^3 x 60.75) degrees of rotation. There are 486 Ra<br>
milli-microns in the Balmer m.4 spectral line of hydrogen (visible).<br>
[75]	The 2nd octave of A is 121.5 (2^1 x 60.75) degrees of rotation. There are 121.5 Ra<br>
milli-microns in the Lyman m2 spectral line of hydrogen (ultra violet). The most<br>
intense spectral line of hydrogen is 121.5 Ra milli-microns. The related Red 'A'<br>
frequency of 106.02875 approximates the average alpha wave produced by a<br>
meditating human being and the most frequently occurring elf wave generated by<br>
lightning. This is the Ra base line frequency from which all other harmonious Ra<br>
musical tones are derived.<br>
[76]	The ratio of a n.s.t. to a standard second is used to convert Ra musical frequencies<br>
from cycles per n.s.t. to cycles per standard second of time. Musical instruments may<br>
be tuned to standard Ra tones in order to produce pleasing musical renditions. In<br>
addition, vintage musical recordings of any type may be processed (translated) to Ra<br>
tones per standard second seconds electronically by the Pyramid Processor and then re-<br>
recorded for repeated listening.<br>
[77]	The Green Ra Tone Scale - Natural and Standard<br>
[78]	The Ra formats relate to many aspects of nature and science. One relationship to be<br>
estimated is musical notes and their conversion to natural frequencies. In the Green Ra<br>
format, the following 1st octave frequencies have been calculated per natural second of<br>
time (n.s.t.):<br>
 <br>
[79]	In the Green Ra format, the following 1st octave frequencies have been calculated<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/130867	PCT/US2006/021584<br>
10<br>
per standard second of time (s.s.t.):<br>
 <br>
[80]	Another method to find the tonal frequencies for the other Ra formats is to use the<br>
ratios that are evident when the Pi values of each format are mathematically compared<br>
to the Pi value for the Green format. For example, standard Green 'A' is 52.9963197<br>
cycles per second. The ratio of Red Pi to Green Pi is 3.141592 - 3.142696805 and that<br>
value multiplied by 52.9963197 cycles per second equals 52.977699 cycles per second.<br>
The standard Red 'A' is 52.977699 cycles per second. Figures 2A through 21 show the<br>
calculated conversion for the 1st Octave of all nine Ra formats.<br>
[81]	Method for producing musical frequencies in all 9 Ra formats<br>
[82]	Having determined the natural values of the frequency of notes in standard seconds,<br>
the following will convert a composition or other series of musical notes into a Ra<br>
format based composition.<br>
 <br>
[83]	This conversion can be precisely demonstrated for all the values of the musical<br>
notes in the various Ra format scales. The table in FIG. 3 provides such a conversion<br>
for the note 'A' in the second and fourth octaves for all nine Ra formats.<br>
[84]	The Pyramid Processor itself consists of 2 main parts: 1) a uniquely designed<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/130867	PCT/US2006/021584<br>
11<br>
electronic device that recognizes standard forms of musical notes (frequencies) that<br>
were previously recorded on any type of existing recording medium; and 2) a hard<br>
wired or software program containing all Ra frequency scales.<br>
[85]	The Pyramid Processor allows a user to select a single or any combination of<br>
compatible Ra frequency scales i.e., Green, Red, Blue, Red-Blue, and Red-<br>
Blue-Green, etc. It has been found that the formats of Red, Blue, and Green, in any<br>
combination or individually produce, the most pleasing sounds to a human being,<br>
although any of the nine Ra formats will operate under the present invention.<br>
[86]	During processing under the present invention, the frequencies of notes in standard<br>
music are converted into Ra frequencies as illustrated in the flowchart of FIG. 4. The<br>
result of the music conversion process is then saved or re-recorded for playback. This<br>
process can be either a real-time event or a non real-time event. Also it can be<br>
configured as a stand-alone device precisely related to uniquely designed software that<br>
is running as a program on a computer.<br>
[87]	FIG. 6 illustrates a schematic block diagram of the apparatus 10, of the present<br>
invention. An apparatus for converting the frequency of standard musical notes to a<br>
corresponding frequency of Ra format musical notes, i.e., the Pyramid Processor 10,<br>
comprising a processor 12 having a signal input port 14 for receiving a signal of<br>
standard musical notes and a signal output port for outputting a signal of Ra format<br>
musical notes. The processor 12 includes means for converting 22 the frequency of<br>
standard musical notes to a corresponding frequency of Ra musical notes using one of<br>
the conversion methods described above. The processor 12 also includes a means for<br>
selecting 18 a Ra format natural harmonic resonance. The Ra format natural harmonic<br>
resonance corresponds to a specific Ra format, i.e., Red, Green, Blue, etc., to which<br>
the apparatus will convert the standard musical notes. The apparatus 10 may also<br>
include a frequency analyzer 26 to determine the frequency of notes in the signal of<br>
standard musical notes as well as confirm the frequency of notes in the signal of Ra<br>
format musical notes.<br>
[88]	The means for converting 22 may comprise either a software program containing<br>
conversions and/or frequencies for all Ra format natural harmonic resonances or<br>
hardware containing all Ra format natural harmonic resonances. The means for<br>
selecting 18 a Ra format natural harmonic resonance may comprise a switch, a dial, or<br>
multiple buttons having positions corresponding to a single Ra format or combinations<br>
of multiple Ra formats. As described above, the Pyramid Processor 10 may be<br>
configured to convert multiple audio channels into multiple corresponding Ra formats.<br>
[89]	The signal input port 14 may be connected to a microphone for receiving a real time<br>
audio signal or may be connected to an audio device, i.e., a stereo receiver, for<br>
converting an audio signal from a non-real time event, i.e., prerecorded tape, compact<br>
disc, computer fde, etc. The signal output port 16 may likewise be connected to<br>
another audio device, i.e., stereo receiver, for reproduction of the converted signal<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/130867	PCT/US2006/021584<br>
12<br>
through the stereo speakers or re-recording of the converted signal. The means for<br>
recording may comprise a tape deck, CD burner, or other known recording device.<br>
[90]	As shown in FIG. 4, the apparatus 10 that converts or shifts the frequencies of<br>
'Standard' tunings to 'Natural' tunings has a flow chart as follows:<br>
[91]	Original Signal =&gt; Conversion Module =&gt; Converted Signal<br>
[92]	With reference to FIG. 4, the process employed in a Pyramid Processor device<br>
having a single channel is illustrated. Either a digital signal/software file (420) or an<br>
input of an original analog signal (410) which is then converted to a digital signal by a<br>
converter (415) is input into the Pyramid Processor. Whichever signal is input is then<br>
analyzed by a digital frequency analyzer (425). A Ra format for a natural harmonic<br>
resonance is selected (430) and a digital frequency converter converts the digital<br>
frequency to the setting determined by the Ra format natural harmonic resonance<br>
(435). The Pyramid Processor then outputs the converted digital signal (440). A second<br>
digital frequency analyzer may be used to confirm that the digital signal has been<br>
properly converted (445). The digital signal file is then output (450), or converted to an<br>
analog signal (455) and then output (460).<br>
[93]	In modern audio production and reproduction, the signal path is anywhere from a<br>
single signal path to multiple signal paths or channels, i.e., right, left, center, surround,<br>
etc. This is to provide separate signal paths for each audio component. Therefore a<br>
conversion system would have multiple signal paths and processing as shown below:<br>
[94]	Original signal 1 =&gt; Conversion Module 1 =&gt; Converted Signal 1<br>
[95]	Original signal 2 =&gt; Conversion Module 2 =&gt; Converted Signal 2<br>
[96]	Original signal 3 =&gt; Conversion Module 3 =&gt; Converted Signal 3<br>
[97]	Original signal 4 =&gt; Conversion Module 4 =&gt; Converted Signal 4<br>
[98]	Original signal 5 =&gt; Conversion Module 5 =&gt; Converted Signal 5<br>
[99]	Original signal N =&gt; Conversion Module N =&gt; Converted Signal N<br>
[100] This would be true for 'N' numbers of channels that are necessary for any ap-<br>
plication.<br>
[101] FIG. 5 illustrates the process of converting a multi-channel, or multiple signal<br>
inputs. Essentially, the same process steps listed above are taken and repeated for each<br>
channel or signal input. These can then be simultaneously output and layered to create<br>
a stereo or multi-channel effect.<br>
[102] Although an embodiment has been described and illustrated, it should not be<br>
construed as limiting the scope of the invention as various modifications may be made<br>
without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br>
