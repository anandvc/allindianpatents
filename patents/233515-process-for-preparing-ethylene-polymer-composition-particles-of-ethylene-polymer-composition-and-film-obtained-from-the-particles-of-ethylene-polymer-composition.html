				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION <br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing an ethylene polymer composition, particles of ethylene polymer composition and a film obtained from the particles of ethylene polymer composition.  More particularly, the invention relates to a process for preparing an ethylene polymer composition of excellent particle morphology, which comprises polymerizing ethylene with high activity through two-step polymerization using a specific catalyst, particles of ethylene polymer composition which have excellent particle morphology, scarcely suffer sintering and are capable of efficiently undergoing subsequent processes, and a film obtained from the particles of ethylene polymer composition and having small gauge-variation and excellent tear strength.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
Ethylene polymers, such as homopolyethylene, a<br>
linear low-density ethylene polymer (LLDPE) and an<br>
ethylene a-olefin copolymer, are excellent in<br>
transparency, mechanical strength, etc., and hence they<br>
have been widely used for films and the like.<br>
For preparing such ethylene polymers, various<br>
processes have been heretofore known, and it is known<br>
that the ethylene polymers can be prepared with high<br>
polymerization activity by the use of, as a<br>
polymerization catalyst, a Ziegler catalyst containing a<br>
titanium catalyst component composed of titanium,<br>
magnesium, a halogen, and optionally, an electron donor.<br>
It is also known that especially when a solid titanium<br>
catalyst component obtained from a halogen-containing<br>
magnesium compound that is prepared as a liquid compound,<br>
a liquid titanium compound and an electron donor is used<br>
as the titanium catalyst component, the ethylene polymers<br>
can be prepared with high activity.<br>
By the way, if it becomes possible to polymerize<br>
ethylene and an a-olefin with much higher activity in the<br>
preparation of the ethylene polymers, not only the<br>
productivity is enhanced, but also the amount of a<br>
catalyst residue based on the polymer, particularly the<br>
amount of halogen, is decreased, and hence problems, such<br>
as mold rusting in the molding process, can be solved.<br>
On this account, a process for preparing an ethylene<br>
polymer, in which ethylene and an oc-olefin can be<br>
polymerized with much higher activity, has been desired.<br>
As a process for polymerizing ethylene with high<br>
activity, there has been recently proposed, for example,<br>
a process wherein an ethylene polymerization catalyst<br>
containing a solid titanium catalyst component obtained<br>
by contacting a liquid magnesium compound, a liquid<br>
titanium compound and an organosilicon compound having no<br>
active hydrogen (Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No,<br>
328514/1997) or a process wherein an olefin<br>
polymerization catalyst containing an aluminum compound<br>
selected from a reaction product of aluminosiloxane,<br>
aluminum alkyl and calixarene and a reaction product of<br>
aluminum alkyl and cyclodextrin, a halogen-containing<br>
magnesium compound and a titanium compound (Japanese<br>
Patent Laid-Open Publication No. 53612/1998), and<br>
preparation of polymers of excellent particle morphology<br>
using these catalysts has been proposed.<br>
Under such circumstances, establishment of a process<br>
for more efficiently preparing an ethylene polymer<br>
industrially has been strongly desired. Immediately<br>
after the polymerization, an ethylene polymer is usually<br>
obtained in the form of a powder irrespective of the<br>
polymerization type such as slurry polymerization or gas<br>
phase polymerization, and it is desirable to prepare an<br>
ethylene polymer having excellent fluidity, containing no<br>
finely powdered particles and having excellent particle<br>
morphology, namely, an ethylene polymer having a narrow<br>
particle size distribution. The ethylene polymer having<br>
excellent particle morphology has various advantages such<br>
as an advantage that it can be used as it is without<br>
pelletization, depending upon the purpose. In addition,<br>
development of an ethylene polymer scarcely having<br>
tackiness at high temperatures, that is, scarcely<br>
suffering sintering, has been strongly desired.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made under such<br>
circumstances as described above, and it is an object of<br>
the invention to provide a process for preparing an<br>
ethylene polymer composition in which ethylene and an aolefin<br>
can be polymerized with high activity and an<br>
ethylene polymer composition having excellent particle<br>
morphology, scarcely suffering sintering and having<br>
excellent moldability can be efficiently prepared. It is<br>
another object of the invention to provide particles of<br>
ethylene polymer composition which have excellent<br>
moldability, scarcely suffer sintering and have a small<br>
particle size distribution and to provide a film obtained<br>
from the particles of ethylene polymer composition and<br>
having small gauge-variation and excellent tear strength.<br>

resulting film has small gauge-variation and excellent<br>
tear strength.<br>
The film according to the invention is obtained from<br>
the particles of ethylene polymer composition and has<br>
small gauge-variation and excellent tear strength.<br>

comprehend "copolymerization". Also the meaning of the<br>
term "polymer" used herein is not limited to<br>
"homopolymer" but may comprehend "copolymer".<br>
Process for preparing ethylene polymer composition<br>
In the process for preparing an ethylene polymer<br>
composition according to the invention, an ethylene<br>
polymerization catalyst containing a specific solid<br>
titanium catalyst component is employed.<br>
(A) Solid titanium catalyst component<br>
The ethylene polymerization catalyst for use in the<br>
invention contains a solid titanium catalyst component<br>
obtained by contacting (a) a liquid magnesium compound<br>
with (b) a liquid titanium compound in the presence of<br>
(c) an organosilicon compound or an organosilicon<br>
aluminum compound.<br>
The ingredients used for preparing the solid<br>
titanium catalyst component are described below.<br>
(a) Liquid magnesium compound<br>
The magnesium compound used for preparing the solid<br>
titanium catalyst component for use in the invention is a<br>
liquid magnesium compound, and when the magnesium<br>
compound is solid, it is changed to liquid prior to use.<br>
As the magnesium compound, a magnesium compound having<br>
reducing ability (a-1) or a magnesium compound having no<br>
reducing ability (a-2) is employable.<br>
(a-1) Magnesium compound having reducing ability<br>
The magnesium compound having reducing ability is,<br>
for example, an organomagnesium compound represented by<br>
the following formula:<br>
XnMgR2-n<br>
wherein n is a number of 0^=n
group of 1 to 20 carbon atoms, an aryl group of 6 to 20<br>
carbon atoms or a cycloalkyl group or 3 to 20 carbon<br>
atoms, when n is 0, two of R may the same or different,<br>
and X is a halogen.<br>
Examples of the organomagnesium compounds having<br>
reducing ability include dialkylmagnesium compounds, such<br>
as dimethylmagnesium, diethylmagnesium, dipropylmagnesium,<br>
dibutylmagnesium, diamylmagnesium, dihexylmagnesium,<br>
didecylmagnesium, octylbutylmagnesium and<br>
ethylbutylmagnesium; alkylmagnesium halides, such as<br>
ethylmagnesium chloride, propylmagnesium chloride,<br>
butylmagnesium chloride, hexylmagnesium chloride and<br>
amylmagnesium chloride; alkylmagnesium alkoxides, such as<br>
butylethoxymagnesium, ethylbutoxymagnesium and<br>
octylbutoxymagnesium; and butylmagnesium hydride.<br>
(a-2) Magnesium compound having no reducing ability<br>
Examples of the magnesium compounds having no<br>
reducing ability include:<br>
magnesium halides, such as magnesium chloride,<br>
magnesium bromide, magnesium iodide and magnesium<br>
fluoride;<br>
alkoxymagnesium halides, such as methoxymagnesium<br>
chloride, ethoxymagnesium chloride, isopropoxymagnesium<br>
chloride, butoxymagnesium chloride and octoxymagnesium<br>
chloride;<br>
aryloxymagnesium halides, such as phenoxymagnesium<br>
chloride and methylphenoxymagnesium chloride;<br>
alkoxymagnesiums, such as ethoxymagnesium,<br>
isopropoxymagnesium, butoxymagnesium, n-octoxymagnesium<br>
and 2-ethylhexoxymagnesium;<br>
aryloxymagnesiums, such as phenoxymagnesium and<br>
dimethyIphenoxymagneslum;<br>
carboxylic acid salts of magnesium, such as<br>
magnesium laurate and magnesium stearate;<br>
magnesium metal; and<br>
magnesium hydrate.<br>
The magnesium compound having no reducing ability<br>
(a-2) may be a compound derived from the magnesium<br>
compound having reducing ability (a-1) or a compound<br>
derived during the preparation of the catalyst component.<br>
In order to derive the magnesium compound having no<br>
reducing ability (a-2) from the magnesium compound having<br>
reducing ability (a-1), the magnesium compound having<br>
reducing ability (a-1) has only to be contacted with, for<br>
example, a compound having an OH group or a reactive<br>
carbon-oxygen bond, such as an alcohol, a ketone, an<br>
ester, an ether or a siloxane compound, or a halogencontaining<br>
compound, such as a halogen-containing silane<br>
compound, a halogen-containing aluminum compound or an<br>
acid halide.<br>
In the present invention, the magnesium compound<br>
having no reducing ability (a-2) can be derived from the<br>
magnesium compound having reducing ability (a-1) using<br>
the later-described organosilicon compound or<br>
organosilicon aluminum compound (c). In this case, the<br>
magnesium compounds can be used in combination of two or<br>
more kinds.<br>
The magnesium compound may be a complex salt or a<br>
double salt with a compound of a metal other than<br>
magnesium, such as aluminum, zinc, boron, beryllium,<br>
sodium or potassium, e.g., the later-described<br>
organoaluminum compound, or can be used as a mixture with<br>
the compound of the above metal.<br>
As the liquid magnesium compound used for preparing<br>
the solid titanium catalyst component, a magnesium<br>
compound other than those described above is also<br>
12<br>
employable. In the resulting solid titanium catalyst<br>
component, however, the magnesium compound is preferably<br>
present in the form of a halogen-containing magnesium<br>
compound. Therefore, if a magnesium compound containing<br>
no halogen is used, it is preferable to contact the<br>
magnesium compound with a halogen-containing compound<br>
during the course of the preparation.<br>
Of the above compounds, magnesium compounds having<br>
no reducing ability (a-2) are preferable, and of these,<br>
halogen-containing magnesium compounds are particularly<br>
preferable. Above all, magnesium chloride,<br>
alkoxymagnesium chloride or aryloxymagnesium chloride is<br>
preferably employed.<br>
When the magnesium compound is solid, it can be<br>
changed to liquid by the use of an electron donor (d-1)<br>
in the invention. Examples of the electron donors (d-1)<br>
employable herein include alcohols, carboxylic acids,<br>
aldehydes, amines and metallic acid esters.<br>
Examples of the alcohols include aliphatic alcohols,<br>
such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropyl alcohol,<br>
butanol, pentanol, hexanol, 2-methylpentanol, 2-<br>
ethylbutanol, heptanol, 2-ethylhexanol, octanol, decanol,<br>
dodecanol, tetradecyl alcohol, octadecyl alcohol,<br>
undecenol, oleyl alcohol, stearyl alchol and ethylene<br>
glycol; alicyclic alcohols, such as cyclohexanol and<br>
methylcyclohexanol; aromatic alcohols, such as benzyl<br>
alcohol, methylbenzyl alcohol, isopropylbenzyl alcohol,<br>
a-methylbenzyl alcohol, a,a-dimethylbenzyl alcohol,<br>
phenylethyl alcohol, cumyl alcohol, phenol, cresol,<br>
xylenol, ethylphenol, propylphenol, nonylphenol and<br>
naphthol; alkoxy group-containing alcohols, such as nbutyl<br>
cellosolve, ethyl cellosolve and l-butoxy-2-<br>
propanol; and halogen-containing alcohols, such as<br>
trichloromethanol, trichloroethanol and trichlorohexanol.<br>
Examples of the carboxylic acids preferably used<br>
include those of 7 or more carbon atoms, such as caprylic<br>
acid, 2-ethylhexanoic acid, nonylic acid and undecylenic<br>
acid.<br>
Examples of the aldehydes preferably used include<br>
those of 7 or more carbon atoms, such as caprylaldehyde,<br>
2-ethylhexylaldehyde, undecylaldehyde, benzaldehyde,<br>
tolualdehyde and naphthaldehyde.<br>
Examples of the amines preferably used include those<br>
of 6 or more carbon atoms, such as heptylamine,<br>
octylamine, 2-ethylhexylamine, nonylamine, decylamine,<br>
undecylamine and laurylamine.<br>
Examples of the metallic acid esters include<br>
tetraethoxytitanium, tetra-n-propoxytitanium, tetra-i14<br>
propoxytitanium, tetrabutoxytitanium, tetrahexoxytitanium,<br>
tetrabutoxyzirconium and tetraethoxyzirconium. In the<br>
metallic acid esters, silicic acid esters described later<br>
as the organosilicon compounds having no active hydrogen<br>
(c-1) are not included.<br>
These electron donors (d-1) may be used in<br>
combination of two or more kinds, and may be used in<br>
combination with the later-described electron donor (d)<br>
other than those described above. Of these, alcohols and<br>
metallic acid esters are preferably employed, and<br>
alcohols of 6 or more carbon atoms are particularly<br>
preferably employed.<br>
When the magnesium compound is changed to liquid by<br>
the use of the electron donor (d-1), the electron donor<br>
of 6 or more carbon atoms as the electron donor (d-1) is<br>
used in an amount of usually not less than about 1 mol,<br>
preferably 1 to 40 mol, more preferably 1.5 to 12 mol,<br>
based on 1 mol of the magnesium compound. The electron<br>
donor of 5 or less carbon atoms as the electron donor (d-<br>
1) is used in an amount of usually not less than about 15<br>
mol based on 1 mol of the magnesium compound.<br>
In the contact of the solid magnesium compound with<br>
the electron donor (d-1), a hydrocarbon solvent can be<br>
employed. Examples of the hydrocarbon solvents include<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as pentane, hexane, heptane,<br>
octane, decane, dodecane, tetradecane and kerosine;<br>
alicyclic hydrocarbons, such as cyclopentane,<br>
methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane, methylcyclohexane,<br>
cyclooctane and cyclohexene; aromatic hydrocarbons, such<br>
as benzene, toluene, xylene, ethylbenzene, cumene and<br>
cymene; and halogenated hydrocarbons, such as carbon<br>
tetrachloride, dichloroethane, dichloropropane,<br>
trichloroethylene and chlorobenzene.<br>
When an aromatic hydrocarbon is used as the<br>
hydrocarbon solvent and an alcohol is used as the<br>
electron donor (d-1), the alcohol has only to be used in<br>
the amount previously described as the amount of the<br>
electron donor of 6 or more carbon atoms irrespective of<br>
the type (number of carbon atoms) of the alcohol, whereby<br>
the magnesium compound can be dissolved. When an<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon and/or an alicyclic hydrocarbon is<br>
used, the alcohol as the electron donor (d-1) is used in<br>
the above-mentioned amount according to the number of<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
In the present invention, it is preferable to use a<br>
liquid magnesium compound (a) prepared by contacting the<br>
solid magnesium compound with the electron donor (d-1) in<br>
the hydrocarbon solvent. In order to dissolve the solid<br>
16<br>
magnesium compound in the electron donor (d-1), a process<br>
comprising contacting the solid magnesium compound with<br>
the electron donor (d-1) preferably in the presence of a<br>
hydrocarbon solvent and then heating the contact product<br>
when needed is generally used. This contact is carried<br>
out at a temperature of usually 0 to 300°C, preferably 20<br>
to 180°C, more preferably 50 to 150°C, for a period of<br>
about 15 minutes to 15 hours, preferably about 30 minutes<br>
to 10 hours.<br>
(b) Liquid titanium compound<br>
As the liquid titanium compound, a tetravalent<br>
titanium compound is particularly preferably employed.<br>
The tetravalent titanium compound is, for example, a<br>
compound represented by the following formula:<br>
Ti (OR)gX4-g<br>
wherein R is a hydrocarbon group, X is a halogen atom,<br>
and 0^g^4.<br>
Examples of such compounds include:<br>
titanium tetrahalides, such as TiCl4, TiBr4 and Til4;<br>
alkoxytitanium trihalides, such as Ti(OCH3)Cl3,<br>
Ti (OC2H5)C13, Ti (0-n-C4H9)Cl3, Ti (OC2H5) Br3 and Ti (0-iso-<br>
C4Hg) Br3;<br>
dialkoxytitanium dihalides, such as Ti(OCH3) 2C12/<br>
Ti (OC2H5)2Cl2, Ti (0-n-C4H9) 2C12 and Ti (OC2H5) 2Br2;<br>
trialkoxytitanium monohalides, such as Ti(OCH3)3Cl,<br>
Ti (OC2H5)3C1, Ti (0-n-C4H9)3Cl and Ti (OC2H5) 3Br; and<br>
tetraalkoxytitaniums, such as Ti(OCH3)4, Ti(OC2H5)4,<br>
Ti (0-n-C4H9) 4, Ti (0-iso-C4H9) 4 and Ti (0-2-ethylhexyl) 4 <br>
Of these, titanium tetrahalides are preferable, and<br>
titanium tetrachloride is particularly preferable.<br>
These titanium compounds may be used in combination<br>
of two or more kinds. The titanium compound may be used<br>
after diluted with such a hydrocarbon solvent as<br>
previously described for making the magnesium compound<br>
liquid.<br>
(c) Organosilicon compound or organosilicon aluminum<br>
compound<br>
In the preparation of the solid titanium catalyst<br>
component, an organosilicon compound (c-1) or an<br>
organosilicon aluminum compound (c-2) is employed.<br>
(c-1) Organosilicon compound<br>

organosilicon compound having no active hydrogen is<br>
preferably employed, and such a compound is, for example,<br>

Preparation of solid titanium catalyst component (A)<br>
The solid titanium catalyst component (A) for use ;<br>
the invention can be prepared from the above components<br>
by, for example, the following process (1) or (2) .<br>
(1) The liquid magnesium compound (a) is contacted<br>
with the liquid titanium compound (b) in the presence of<br>
the organosilicon compound or the organosilicon aluminurfcompound (c) (sometimes referred to as "organosilicon<br>
compound (c)" simply hereinafter) in an amount of 0.25 to<br>
'<br>
0.35 mol based on 1 mol of the magnesium compound (a),<br>
and the resulting contact product is heated to a<br>
temperature of 90 to 115°C and maintained at this<br>
temperature.<br>
(2) The contact product prepared in the same manneif<br>
as in the process (1) is maintained at a temperature of<br>
90 to 115°C, and in this course, the organosilicon<br>
compound (c) is further added in an amount of not more<br>
than 0.5 mol based on 1 mol of the magnesium compound (;<br>
between the time of a temperature lower by 10°C than th«<br>
temperature maintained and the time of completion of th^<br>
temperature rise, or after completion of the temperature<br>
rise, and contacted with the contact product.<br>
Of the above processes, the process (1) is<br>
preferably used in the preparation of the solid titaniuiji<br>
catalyst component (A) from the viewpoint of catalytic<br>
activity of the resulting solid titanium catalyst<br>
component.<br>
For contacting the components in the above processe<br>
the organosilicon compound (c) is desirably used in the<br>
amount specified as above based on the liquid magnesium<br>
compound (a). The liquid titanium compound (b) is<br>
desirably used in such a sufficient amount that a solid<br>
i<br>
can be precipitated by the contact even if any special<br>
precipitating means is not used. Although the amount of|<br>
the liquid titanium compound (b) used varies depending<br>
i<br>
upon the type thereof, contact conditions, amount of the<br>
organosilicon compound (c) , etc., it is usually not less;<br>
than about 1 mol, preferably about 5 to about 200 mol,<br>
particularly preferably about 10 to about 100 mol, based<br>
on 1 mol of the liquid magnesium compound (a). The<br>
titanium compound (b) is used in an amount of preferably<br>
more than 1 mol, particularly preferably not less than lj<br>
mol, based on 1 mol of the organosilicon compound (c).<br>
The process for preparing the solid titanium<br>
catalyst component (A) is described below in more detail.<br>
The liquid magnesium compound (a) and/or the<br>
titanium compound (b) used for preparing the solid<br>
titanium catalyst component (A) may contain the<br>
organosilicon compound (c). In this case, it is<br>
unnecessary to newly add the organosilicon compound (c)<br>
in the contact of the magnesium compound (a) with the<br>
j<br>
titanium compound (b), however, the organosilicon<br>
compound (c) may be added if in either case the whole<br>
amount of the organosilicon compound (c) based on the<br>
magnesium compound (a) is in the above range.<br>
The liquid magnesium compound (a) containing the<br>
organosilicon compound (c) is obtained by, for example,<br>
contacting the organosilicon compound (c) with the liquid<br>
magnesium compound (a) for a given period of time. The<br>
contact time (t) is as follows. When the contact<br>
temperature (Temp) is not higher than55°C, the contact<br>
time is a time satisfying the condition of t&gt;(3-(Temp-<br>
50)/5) hour(s), preferably t&gt;(4-(Temp-50)/5) hour(s).<br>
When the contact temperature exceeds 55°C, the contact<br>
time is at least 1 hour, preferably not less than 2 hoijirs<br>
The contact temperature is in the range of usually 20 to<br>
100°C, preferably higher than 55°C and not higher than<br>
90°C.<br>
In the process (1) for preparing the solid titaniujnI<br>
catalyst component (A), the contact of the liquid<br>
magnesium compound (a) with the liquid titanium compound<br>
(b) is carried out in the presence of the organosilicon<br>
compound (c) at a low temperature at which a solid is nbt<br>
produced rapidly, and is desirably carried out at a<br>
temperature of specifically -70 to +50°C, preferably -5|0<br>
to +30°C, more preferably -40 to +20°C. The temperatures<br>
of the solutions used for the contact may be different<br>
from each other. If the contact temperature at the<br>
beginning of the contact is too low to precipitate a<br>
solid in the contact product, low-temperature contact mlay<br>
be conducted for a long period of time to precipitate aj<br>
solid.<br>
In the process (1), the contact product obtained<br>
above is then slowly heated to a temperature of 90 to<br>
115°C to slowly precipitate a solid and maintained at<br>
this temperature. The period of time for maintaining the<br>
temperature is in the range of usually 0.5 to 6 hours,<br>
preferably about 1 to 4 hours. The period of time<br>
necessary for the temperature rise greatly varies<br>
depending upon the scale of the reactor, etc.<br>
By the contact of the liquid magnesium compound (a)<br>
with the liquid titanium compound (b) in the presence of<br>
the organosilicon compound (c) under the above conditions,<br>
a granular or spherical solid titanium catalyst component<br>
having an excellent particle size distribution can be<br>
obtained. When ethylene is subjected to slurry<br>
polymerization using such a solid titanium catalyst<br>
component of excellent particle morphology, a granular or<br>
spherical ethylene polymer having an excellent particle<br>
size distribution, high bulk density and excellent<br>
fluidity can be obtained.<br>
In the process (2) for preparing the solid titaniuiji<br>
catalyst component (A), the contact product is heated to<br>
a temperature of 90 to 115°C and maintained at this<br>
temperature for usually 0.5 to 6 hours, preferably 1 to<br>
hours, similarly to the process (1). In this course,<br>
however, the organosilicon compound (c) in an amount of<br>
not more than 0.5 mol based on 1 mol of the magnesium<br>
compound (a) is further added to the contact product<br>
between the time when a temperature is lower by 10°C th^n<br>
the temperature maintained and the time when the<br>
temperature rise is completed, or after the temperature<br>
rise is completed (preferably immediately after the<br>
temperature rise).<br>
The solid titanium catalyst component (A) prepared<br>
as above contains magnesium, titanium, a halogen and the<br>
organosilicon compound (c). In the solid titanium<br>
catalyst component (A), the magnesium/titanium atomic<br>
ratio is in the range of about 2 to about 100, preferably<br>
about 4 to about 50, more preferably about 5 to about 30,<br>
and when the organosilicon compound (c-1) is used, the<br>
magnesium/titanium molar ratio is in the range of 3.0 to<br>
4.0, preferably 3.1 to 3.8, more preferably 3.2 to 3.7.<br>
The titanium atom is desirably contained in an amount of<br>
not less than 7.8 % by weight, preferably not less than<br>
8.0 % by weight. The halogen/titanium atomic ratio is<br>
desired to be in the range of about 4 to about 100,<br>
preferably about 5 to about 90, more preferably about 8<br>
to about 50, and the organosilicon compound (c)/titanium<br>
molar ratio is desired to be in the range of about 0.01<br>
to about 100, preferably about 0.1 to about 10, more<br>
preferably about 0.2 to about 6.<br>
The organosilicon compound (c)/magnesium molar ratio<br>
is desired to be in the range of about 0.001 to about 0 <br>
preferably about 0.002 to about 0.08, particularly<br>
preferably 0.005 to 0.05.<br>
The solid titanium catalyst component (A) for use in<br>
the invention may further contain other additives, such<br>
as a carrier, in addition to the above components. When<br>
the carrier is used, the carrier may be contained in an<br>
amount of not more than 500 % by weight, preferably not<br>
more than 400 % by weight, more preferably not more tha<br>
300 % by weight, still more preferably not more than<br>
200 % by weight, based on the catalyst component. The<br>
composition of the solid titanium catalyst component ca|i<br>
be measured by ICP (Inductively Coupled Plasma-Atomic<br>
Emission Spectroscopy), gas chromatography or the like,<br>
after the solid titanium catalyst component is<br>
sufficiently washed with a large amount of hexane and<br>
dried under the conditions of 0.1 to 1 Torr and room<br>
temperature for not less than 2 hours.<br>
The shape of the solid titanium catalyst component<br>
(A) for use in the invention is desired to be granular<br>
almost spherical, and the specific surface area thereof<br>
is not less than about 10 m2/g, preferably about 30 to<br>
500 m2/g. In the present invention, the solid titanium<br>
catalyst component is usually used after washed with a<br>
hydrocarbon solvent.<br>

not more than 50 times.<br>
The step (II) is a step to homopolymerize ethylene<br>
or copplymerize ethylene and another a-olefin/ and is<br>
a step to prepare an ethylene polymer (ii) having ^n<br>
a-olefin content of not more than 15 % by weight,<br>
preferably 0 to 1-0 % by weight, more preferably 0 to 5 I<br>
by weight, and an intrinsic viscosity [r\] of 0.3 to 3<br>
i<br>
dl/g, preferably 0.4 to 2.5 dl/g, preferably from 0.5 tcj)<br>
2 dl/g. I<br>
When the a-olefin content of the ethylene polymer<br>
(ii) is in the above range, a composition having<br>
excellent resistance to environmental stress crack is<br>
obtained, so that the above range is preferable. When<br>
the intrinsic viscosity [t|] of the ethylene polymer (II'<br>
is in the above range, a composition having excellent<br>
processability, impact strength and tensile strength is<br>
obtained, and a molded article having little surface<br>
roughening can be produced, so that the above range is<br>
preferable.<br>
In the present invention, the step (II) is carried<br>
out in the presence of the ethylene polymer (i) obtainecjl<br>
in the step (I), or the step (I) is carried out in the<br>
presence of the ethylene polymer (ii) obtained in the<br>
step (II) . In this process, in the step (latter step)<br>
that is carried out in the presence of the ethylene<br>
polymer obtained in the former step, the aforesaid<br>
ethylene polymerization catalyst may be newly added,<br>
it is preferable to continuously use the ethylene<br>
polymerization catalyst used in the former step. When<br>
the ethylene polymerization catalyst used in the former<br>
step is continuously used, the amount of the catalyst<br>
be decreased, and a composition having less fish-eye can<br>
be obtained, so that such use is preferable. !<br>
In the present invention, an ethylene polymer is<br>
produced in the latter step in the presence of the<br>
ethylene polymer obtained in the former step, whereby aji<br>
ethylene polymer composition is prepared. The intrinsic!;<br>
viscosity [r|]E of the ethylene polymer produced in the<br>
latter step can be determined by the following formula<br>
[r)]c = WA[T)]A+WB[T|]B<br>
wherein [r\]A is an intrinsic viscosity of the ethylene<br>
polymer obtained in the former step, [t|]B is an intrinsic<br>
I<br>
viscosity obtained in the latter step, [r|]C is an<br>
j<br>
intrinsic viscosity of the ethylene polymer compositionj<br>
WA is a weight ratio of the ethylene polymer obtained in<br>
the former step to the ethylene polymer composition, WB<br>
is a weight ratio of the ethylene polymer obtained in the<br>
latter step to the ethylene polymer composition, and<br>
WA+WB=1.<br>
Although the polymerization in the step (I) and the<br>
step (II) may be any of slurry polymerization and gas<br>
phase polymerization, the slurry polymerization is<br>
preferable. The polymerization in the step (I) and the<br>
step (II) may be carried out in the presence of an inert<br>
solvent. Examples of the inert solvents employable in<br>
the polymerization include aliphatic hydrocarbons, such<br>
as butane, pentane, hexane, heptane, octane, decane,<br>
dodecane and kerosine; alicyclic hydrocarbons, such as<br>
cyclopentane, methylcyclopentane, cyclohexane and<br>
methylcyclohexane; aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene,<br>
toluene, xylene and ethylbenzene; and halogenated<br>
hydrocarbons, such as ethylene chloride and chlorobenzehe.<br>
In the step (I) and the step (II) in the invention,<br>
the ethylene polymerization catalyst is desirably used in<br>
an amount of usually 0.0001 to 0 . 1 mmol, preferably O.OJ01<br>
to 0.05 mmol, in terms of Ti atom, based on 1 liter of<br>
the polymerization volume.<br>
Although the polymerization conditions in the step<br>
(I) and the step (II) are not specifically restricted,<br>
these steps are desirably carried out under the ;<br>
conditions of a temperature of usually about 20 to 120°C,<br>
preferably 50 to 100CC, and a pressure of atmospheric<br>
pressure to 9.8 MPa (atmospheric pressure to 100 kg/cm2 1 <br>
preferably about 0.2 to 4.9 MPa (about 2 to 50 kg/cm2).<br>
When the organometallic compound (B) is used in<br>
combination, this compound (B) is used in such an amounl<br>
that the amount of the metal atom in the organometallic<br>
compound (B) becomes usually 1 to 2000 mol based on 1 m<br>
of the titanium atom in the solid titanium catalyst<br>
component<br>
In the step (I) and the step (II) , the<br>
!<br>
polymerization can be carried out in the presence of ;<br>
hydrogen to control the molecular weight of the resulting<br>
polymer.<br>
The ethylene polymer composition obtained in the<br>
invention contains the ethylene polymer (i) obtained in<br>
the step (I) and the ethylene polymer (ii) obtained in<br>
the step (II) .<br>
In the present invention, the step (I) and the step<br>
(II) are desirably carried out in such a manner that th4<br>
amount of the ethylene polymer (i) obtained in the step<br>
(I) becomes 40 to 70 parts by weight, preferably 45 to $0<br>
parts by weight, and the amount of the ethylene polymer<br>
(ii) obtained in the step (II) becomes 60 to 30 parts by<br>
weight, preferably 55 to 40 parts by weight, each amount<br>
being based on 100 parts by weight of the resulting whole<br>
ethylene polymer composition.<br>
By the process for preparing an ethylene polymer<br>
composition having the step (I) and the step (II)<br>
according to the invention, an ethylene polymer<br>
composition having an intrinsic viscosity [t|] of 1 to 6<br>
dl/g, preferably 1.5 to 5 dl/g, and a density of not les|s<br>
than 0.94 g/cm3, preferably 0.94 to 0.97 g/cm3, more<br>
preferably 0.95 to 0.97 g/cm3, is obtained.<br>
The a-olefin content in the ethylene polymer<br>
composition obtained by the invention is desired to be<br>
not more than 20 % by weight, preferably 0 to 10 % by<br>
weight. The molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of thb<br>
ethylene polymer composition obtained by the invention i|s<br>
relatively wide owing to the multi-step polymerization<br>
and is desired to be in the range of usually 20 to 45,<br>
preferably about 25 to 40.<br>
The process for preparing an ethylene polymer<br>
composition according to the invention may further has,<br>
in addition to the step (I) and the step (II), a drying<br>
step for drying the resulting ethylene polymer<br>
composition at a temperature of about 50 to 110°C,<br>
preferably about 70 to 110°C. The ethylene polymer<br>
composition obtained by the invention has a high<br>
sintering temperature, and even if the composition is<br>
subjected to drying accompanied by heating, surface<br>
tackiness hardly occurs. Moreover, local overheating<br>
hardly takes place owing to the excellent particle size<br>
distribution. Hence, drying of the ethylene polymer<br>
composition can be efficiently carried out.<br>
If the homopolymerization of ethylene or<br>
copolymerization of ethylene and another a-olefin using a<br>
catalyst containing the solid titanium catalyst component<br>
(A) is carried out in one step without dividing it into<br>
two steps, the resulting polymer has a bulk specific<br>
gravity of usually 0.30 to 0.45 g/ml, preferably 0.33 to<br>
0.45 g/ml.<br>
The melt flow rate (in accordance with ASTM D 1238Ef,<br>
190°C) of the ethylene polymer obtained in the one-step<br>
polymerization is desired to be in the range of 0.01 to<br>
5000 g/10 min.<br>
In the process for preparing an ethylene polymer<br>
composition according to the invention, an ethylene<br>
polymer composition can be prepared with extremely high<br>
polymerization activity, and obtainable is an ethylene<br>
polymer composition having excellent particle morphology.<br>
On this account, the ethylene polymer composition has a<br>
low catalyst content per unit of the polymer composition,<br>
and mold rusting hardly occurs in the molding process.<br>
In addition, the ethylene polymer composition obtained by<br>
the invention has a narrow particle size distribution and<br>
a relatively wide molecular weight distribution, and<br>
hence the composition has excellent moldability and<br>
scarcely has tackiness even under such high-temperature<br>
conditions as in the molding process.<br>
Particles of ethylene polymer composition<br>
The particles of ethylene polymer composition<br>
according to the invention comprise an ethylene polymer<br>

copolymerizing ethylene and another a-olefin and having<br>

ASTM D 1238E, of 0.0001 to 0.5 g/10 min, preferably<br>
0.0005 to 0.3 g/10 min, and a molecular weight<br>
distribution (Mw/Mn) of 20 to 45, preferably 25 to 40.<br>
The ethylene polymer composition desirably has an<br>
intrinsic viscosity [r\] of 1 to 6 dl/g, preferably 1.5 jto<br>
l<br>
5 dl/g, a density of not less than 0.94 g/cm3, preferably<br>
j<br>
0.94 to 0.97 g/cm3, more preferably about 0.95 to 0.97<br>
g/cm3, and an ot-olefin content of not more than 20 % by<br>
weight, preferably 0 to 10 % by weight.<br>
The particles of ethylene polymer composition of the<br>
invention have:<br>
a particle size distribution index, as determined by<br>
the following formula, of 1.1 to 2.0, preferably 1.1 to<br>
1.8, more preferably 1.1 to 1.6,<br>
Particle size distribution index =<br>
/Polymer Ds/j/Polymer Die<br>
wherein Polymer Die is a particle diameter obtained whenj<br>
16 % by weight of the whole particles of ethylene polymer<br>
composition can be sieved, and Polymer Ds4 is a particle<br>
diameter obtained when 84 % by weight of the whole<br>
particles of ethylene polymer composition can be sieved,<br>

to 0.45 g/ml, and<br>
a fluidity index of 45 to 90, preferably 50 to 90.<br>
The molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of the<br>
ethylene polymer composition can be determined by<br>
measuring molecular weights by GPC (gel permeation<br>
chromatography) under the conditions of columns of Tosoh<br>
GMHHR-H(S)-HT 30cmx2 and GMH-HTL 30cmx2 , a solvent of<br>
orthodichlorobenzene, a flow rate of 1.0 ml/min and a<br>
temperature of 140°C.<br>
The particle size distribution index of the<br>
particles of ethylene polymer composition can be<br>
determined in accordance with the above formula using a<br>
particle size distribution obtained by sieve analysis.<br>
The bulk density can be determined by JIS K 6721, and tjie<br>
fluidity index can be determined by measuring<br>
compressibility (%), angle of repose (degrees), angle of<br>
spatula (degrees) and uniformity coefficient in<br>
accordance with the method of Carr (Chemical Engineering,<br>
Jan., 18/1965).<br>
The particles of ethylene polymer composition of tide<br>
invention can be preferably prepared by the aforesaid<br>
process for preparing an ethylene polymer composition<br>
according to the invention, and can be more preferably<br>
prepared by carrying out the polymerization of the step<br>
(I) and the step (II) as slurry polymerization in the<br>
aforesaid process for preparing an ethylene polymer<br>
composition according to the invention.<br>
The particles of ethylene polymer composition of the<br>
invention comprise an ethylene polymer composition having<br>
a specific MFR and a relatively wide molecular weight<br>
distribution and have a narrow particle size distribution,<br>
a specific bulk density and a specific fluidity index, is<br>
described above.<br>
Accordingly, the particles of ethylene polymer<br>
composition have a high sintering temperature, scarcely<br>
have tackiness even at such a high temperature as in the<br>
drying process and are almost free from adhesion to one<br>
another, so that they can be easily handled in various<br>
processes such as transportation, storage and<br>
introduction into a molding machine. Further, the<br>
particles of ethylene polymer composition scarcely<br>
contain a fine powder and have excellent particle<br>
morphology, so that they can be used as they are without!<br>
pelletization. Moreover, the particles of ethylene<br>
polymer composition of the invention have excellent<br>
moldability. Hence, a molded article obtained by molding<br>
j<br>
them exhibits excellent impact strength and tensile<br>
i<br>
strength, has little surface roughening and hardly causbs<br>
rusting of a mold.<br>
As described above, the particles of ethylene<br>
polymer composition of the invention can industrially,<br>
extremely efficiently undergo subsequent processes, such<br>
as transportation, storage, introduction into a molding<br>
machine and molding, and the molded product obtained from<br>
the particles has excellent properties.<br>
To the ethylene polymer composition and the<br>
particles of ethylene polymer composition obtained by the<br>
invention, additives, such as heat stabilizer, weathering<br>
stabilizer, antistatic agent, anti-blocking agent,<br>
lubricant, nucleating agent, pigment, die and inorganic<br>
or organic filler, can be added when needed.<br>

of ethylene polymer composition according to the<br>
invention have excellent moldability and can be molded k y<br>
calendering, extrusion molding, injection molding, blow<br>
molding, press molding, stamping and the like.<br>
In order to produce a sheet or a film from the<br>
ethylene polymer composition or the particles of ethylerie<br>
polymer composition, for example, extrusion molding of<br>
j<br>
the ethylene polymer composition (particles) is available.<br>
In the extrusion molding, hitherto known extrusion<br>
devices and molding conditions are adoptable. For<br>
example, using a single-screw extruder, a kneading<br>
extruder, a ram extruder or a gear extruder, a molten<br>
ethylene polymer composition is extruded from a T-die or|<br>
the like to produce a sheet or a film (unstretched).<br>
A stretched film is obtained by stretching the<br>
extruded sheet or film (unstretched) by, for example,<br>
tentering (lengthwise-widthwise stretching, widthwise<br>
lengthwise stretching), simultaneous biaxial orientation<br>
or monoaxial stretching. Also an inflation film can be<br>
produced. The inflation film is produced by a process<br>
comprising melting the particles of ethylene polymer<br>
composition, extruding the molten resin through a<br>
circular slit die and inflating the extrudate with a<br>
prescribed air stream. The resin temperature in the<br>
extrusion of the molten particles of ethylene polymer<br>
composition is preferably in the range of 180 to 250°C.<br>
The height of the frost line from the die surface is<br>
preferably in the range of 8 to 15 times the die diameter.<br>
The blow up ratio is preferably in the range of 1.5 to<br>
times.<br>
The film that is produced from the particles of<br>
|<br>
ethylene polymer composition of the invention as<br>
described above desirably has a thickness of 5 to 60 urn,<br>
preferably 6 to 50 urn.<br>
The film obtained as above has features of small<br>
gauge-variation and excellent tear strength.<br>
In the present invention, the expression "small<br>
gauge-variation" used herein means that a standard<br>
deviation value of film thickness at the space of 15 mm<br>
is not more than 1.5 jam measured by continuous filmthickness<br>
measuring apparatuses K-306A and K-310C<br>
(products of Anritsu Co.), and the expression "excellent]<br>
|<br>
tear strength" used herein means that Elmendorf tear<br>
strength measured in accordance with JIS K7128 is not<br>
less than 70 N/cm in the MD direction and not less than<br>
700 N/cm in the TD direction.<br>

EXAMPLE<br>
The present invention is further described with<br>
reference to the following examples, but it should be<br>
construed that the invention is in no way limited to<br>
those examples.<br>
In the following examples, the composition of the<br>
solid titanium catalyst component, particle size<br>
distribution of the particles of ethylene polymer<br>
composition and bulk specific gravity thereof were<br>
measured by the methods described below.<br>
Mg and Ti contents<br>
i<br>
The Mg and Ti contents were measured by ICP analyzejr<br>
(manufactured by Shimazu Seisakusho, ICPF 1000TR).<br>
Cl content<br>
The Cl content was measured by silver nitrate<br>
titration.<br>
Particle size distribution<br>
The particle size distribution was measured by the<br>
use of a vibrating machine (manufactured by lida<br>
Seisakusho, low-tap machine) and a sieve (Bunsei Furui,<br>
inner diameter: 200mm) .<br>
Bulk specific gravity<br>
The bulk specific gravity was measured by JIS K-672J1.<br>
Sintering temperature<br>
j<br>
In a 1-liter glass autoclave, 100 g of a polymer<br>
composition and 250 ml of hexane were placed. After th£<br>
autoclave was closed, the contents were stirred at a<br>
stirring rate of 300 rpm for 30 minutes. With heating ^t<br>
i<br>
a rate of l°C/min, the state of slurrying was observed |to<br>
measure a temperature at which the composition swelled,<br>
and the measured temperature was taken as a sintering<br>
temperature.<br>
Film properties<br>
Using continuous film-thickness measuring<br>
apparatuses K-306A and K-310C manufactured by Anntsu go. <br>
a film thickness was measured at intervals of 15 mm, and<br>
a gauge-variation was determined by calculation. That is,<br>
a mean thickness and a standard deviation value of the<br>
film were measured by the above devices, and the standard<br>
i<br>
deviation value was taken as a gauge-variation in film<br>
thickness. The Elmendorf tear strength was determined by<br>
carrying out a tear test in accordance with JIS K 7128.<br>
Preparation of solid titanium catalyst component (A)<br>
Synthesis Example 1<br>
5.0 Kilograms (52.5 mol) of anhydrous magnesium<br>
chloride, 21.5 kg of decane and 17.1 kg (131.3 mol) of 4-<br>
ethylhexyl alcohol were heated and reacted at 140°C forji<br>
hours to give a homogeneous solution. To the solution,<br>
3.28 kg (15.8 mol) of tetraethoxysilane was added, and<br>
they were stirred at 60°C for 2 hours to dissolve the<br>
tetraethoxysilane in the solution, whereby a homogeneous;<br>
solution was obtained.<br>
The whole amount of the homogeneous solution was<br>
cooled to 40°C, maintained at that temperature and<br>
dropwise added to 140 liters of titanium tetrachloride<br>
 (maintained at 2°C) over a period of 2 hours with<br>
stirring. After the dropwise addition was completed, the<br>
mixed solution was maintained at 2°C for I hour, then<br>
heated to 105°C over a period of 3 hours and maintained<br>
at that temperature for I hour with stirring to perform<br>
reaction.<br>
After the one-hour reaction was completed, the<br>
resulting solids were separated by hot filtration, and<br>
the solids were sufficiently washed with hexane at 90°C<br>
until no titanium compound liberated was detected in the<br>
washing liquid. Thus, a hexane suspension of a solid<br>
titanium catalyst component (A-l) was obtained. The<br>
composition of the solid titanium catalyst component (A-<br>
1) is set forth in Table 1.<br>
Synthesis Example 2<br>
In 50 liters of dehydrated and purified hexane, 1.90<br>
kg (20 mol) of anhydrous magnesium chloride was suspended.<br>
To the suspension was dropwise added 5.57 kg (121 mol) of<br>
ethanol with stirring, and the reaction was carried out<br>
at 30°C for 1 hour. To the reaction solution, 6.44 kg<br>
(53.4 mol) of diethylaluminum chloride was dropwise added<br>
at 30°C, and the mixture was stirred at that temperature<br>
for 2 hours. Then, 2.99 kg (157.6 mol) of titanium<br>
tetrachloride was added, and the system was heated to<br>
80°C and maintained at that temperature for 3 hours with<br>
stirring to perform reaction.<br>
After the reaction, the resulting solids were<br>
separated and sufficiently washed with hexane at room<br>
temperature until no titanium compound liberated was<br>
detected in the washing liquid. Thus, a hexane<br>
suspension of a solid titanium catalyst component (A-2)<br>
was obtained. The composition of the solid titanium<br>
catalyst component (A-2) is set forth in Table 1.<br>
Synthesis Example 3<br>
4.76 Grams (50 mmol) of anhydrous magnesium chloride,<br>
28.1 ml of decane and 16.3 g (125 mmol) of 2-ethylhexyl<br>
alcohol were heated and reacted at 130°C for 3 hours to<br>
give a homogeneous solution. To the solution, 3.1 g (15<br>
mmol) of tetraethoxysilane was added, and they were<br>
stirred at 60°C for 2 hours to dissolve the<br>
tetraethoxysilane in the solution.<br>
The whole amount of the resulting homogeneous<br>
solution was cooled to 40°C, maintained at that<br>
temperature and dropwise added to 200 ml (1.8 mol) of<br>
titanium tetrachloride (maintained at 2°C) over a period<br>
of 1 hour with stirring. After the dropwise addition was<br>
completed, the mixed solution was maintained at 2°C for 1<br>
hour, then heated to 105°C over a period of 3 hours and<br>
maintained at that temperature for 1 hour with stirring.<br>
After the one-hour reaction was completed, the<br>
resulting solids were separated by hot filtration and<br>
sufficiently washed with decane at 90°C and hexane until<br>
no titanium compound liberated was detected in the<br>
washing liquid. Thus, a hexane suspension of a solid<br>
titanium catalyst component (A-3) was obtained. The<br>
composition of the solid titanium catalyst component (A-<br>
3) is set forth in Table 1.<br>
Synthesis Example 4<br>
A catalyst component was prepared in the same manner<br>
as in Synthesis Example 3, except that the reaction<br>
temperature after the addition of tetraethoxysilane was<br>
changed to 65°C from 60°C in the preparation of the<br>
catalyst component. The composition of the resulting<br>
solid titanium catalyst component (A-4) is set forth in<br>
Table 1.<br>
Synthesis Example 5<br>

catalyst component. The composition of the resulting<br>
solid titanium catalyst component (A-5) is set forth in.<br>

of the resulting solid titanium catalyst component (A-6)<br>
is set forth in Table 1.<br>

as in Synthesis Example 3, except that the reaction<br>
temperature was changed to 120°C from 105°C and the<br>
reaction time was changed to 2 hours from 1 hour in the<br>
preparation of the catalyst component. The composition<br>
of the resulting solid titanium catalyst component (A-7)<br>
is set forth in Table 1.<br>
Synthesis Example 8<br>
A catalyst component was prepared in the same manner<br>
as in Synthesis Example 3, except that the amount of the<br>
tetraethoxysilane added was changed to 1.7 g (8 mmol)<br>
from 3.1 g (15 mmol) in the preparation of the catalyst<br>
component. The composition of the resulting solid<br>
titanium catalyst component (A-8) is set forth in Table 1<br>
Synthesis Example 9<br>
A catalyst component was prepared in the same manner<br>
as in Synthesis Example 3, except that the reaction<br>
temperature was changed to 125°C from 105°C in the<br>
preparation of the catalyst component. The composition<br>
of the resulting solid titanium catalyst component (A-9)<br>
is set forth in Table 1.<br>

of Synthesis Examples 3 to 9 set forth in Table 1, the<br>
amount of silicon is in the range of about 0.1 to 0.5 %<br>
by weight, and the residual component (other than Ti, Mg,<br>
OEt, OEM and Si) is a halogen.<br>
(Table Removed)  Using a continuous slurry polymerization apparatus,<br>
two-step polymerization was carried out in the following<br>
manner.<br>
First, to a polymerization reactor of the first step,<br>
the solid titanium catalyst component (A-l) prepared in<br>
Synthesis Example 1 and triethylaluminum were<br>
continuously fed at rates of 3.8 mmol/hr (in terms of<br>
titanium atom) and 20 mmol/hr, respectively. To the<br>
polymerization reactor were further continuously fed<br>
ethylene at a rate of 14.1 kg/hr and hexane at a rate of<br>
40 1/hr, and in order to maintain the gas composition<br>
constant, hydrogen and nitrogen were continuously fed<br>
together with ethylene under the conditions of a<br>
hydrogen/ethylene molar ratio of 10.3 and an ethylene<br>
concentration of 7 % by mol, whereby homopolymerization<br>
of ethylene was carried out under the conditions of a<br>
total pressure of 0.52 MPa and a polymerization<br>
temperature of 85°C. The ethylene polymer in the<br>
polymerization solution obtained by the polymerization of<br>
the first step had MFR of 797 g/10 min, a sintering<br>
temperature of 105°C and an intrinsic viscosity [r\] of<br>
0.52 dl/g.<br>
Then, after removal of hydrogen from the<br>
polymerization solution obtained by the polymerization pf<br>
the first step, the polymerization solution was<br>
