				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a method of dispersing soot produced by a lubricated diesel engine and a lubricant for use in diesel engines including passenger car and heavy duty cpmmercial diesel engines.<br>
Diesel engines produce soot as a by-product of the combustion process. The soot increases the viscosity of lubricants used in the diesel engines and eventually the lubricants become too thick to be workable. The soot therefore reduces the working life of the lubricants, and money and time are wasted in early replacement of the unworkable lubricant. The soot also causes wear of the diesel engines, which reduces their working life.<br>
Lubricants currently on the market for diesel engines typically comprise: 65-80% by weight of base oil; 5-15% by weight of viscosity index improver(s) (VII); and 10-22% by weight of a detergent inhibitor (Dl) package. The viscosity index improver(s) (VII) may be a non-dispersant viscosity index improver (NDVII) and/ or a dispersant viscosity index improver (DVII). One function of the detergent inhibitor (Dl) package is to provide a dispersant to disperse the soot and thereby prevent soot related viscosity increase of the lubricant and wear on the engine. The choice and amount of viscosity index improver(s) (VII) used in the lubricant, e.g. whether it is a NDVII or a DVII, will affect the choice and amount of dispersant, which is provided by the detergent inhibitor package (Dl), present in the lubricant. In conventional formulations, the choice and amount of Dl package is normally chosen to provide approximately at least:<br>
a)	6% dispersant(s) in the finished lubricant when using a non-dispersant viscosity index improving agent (NDVII); or<br>
b)	4% dispersant(s) in the finished lubricant when using a traditional dispersant viscosity index improving agent (DVII), such as those available prior to approximately 1994.<br><br>
Although it is possible to increase the amount of soot that is dispersed by a lubricant by increasing the amount of dispersant, which is provided by the detergent inhibitor (Dl) package, present in the lubricant, increasing the amount of dispersant can cause the following negative effects: it can increase the wear on the engine by interfering with the anti-wear additives in the formulation; it can cause damage to seals in contact with the lubricant; it negatively impacts low temperature viscometrics; and it can increase the cost of the lubricant.<br>
The inventors of the present invention are therefore concerned with the problem of   increasing the amount of soot that is dispersed by a lubricant without increasing the amount of dispersant, which is normally provided by the detergent inhibitor (Dl) package, present in the finished lubricant. The inventors are also concerned with the problem of controlling soot related viscosity increase with lower levels of dispersant, which is normally provided by the Dl package, than conventionally used by those skilled! in the art.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is provided use of a lubricant in a diesel " engine to disperse soot produced by the diesel engine, the soot being dispersed without adversely affecting the viscosity of the lubricant; the lubricant comprising a dispersant and a functionalised viscosity index improver; the functionalised viscosity index improver comprising a highly functionalised graft copolymer reaction product of an oxygen, a nitrogen, or an oxygen and a nitrogen containing, ethylenically unsaturated, aliphatic or aromatic monomer having from 2 to about 50carbon atoms grafted on to a polyolefin copolymer.<br>
In accordance with the present invention there is also provided a method of controlling    viscosity changes of a lubricant in a diesel engine that are caused by build-up of soot,    the method comprising using the lubricant defined above as the lubricant in the diesel    engine.<br>
â€¢4.<br><br>
The inventors have found a lubricant that allows an increased amount of soot to be dispersed without increasing the amount of dispersant, which is normally provided by the detergent inhibitor (Dl), present in the lubricant.<br>
The inventors have also found a highly functionalised graft copolymer, which, when incorporated into a lubricant, allows the lubricant to disperse soot produced as a by-product of a diesel engine without adversely affecting the viscosity of the lubricant.<br>
The inventors have also found that lower than conventional amounts (e.g. 4% or less) of dispersant, which is normally provided by the Dl package, may be used in combination with the highly functionalised graft copolymer defined above to control soot related viscosity increase.<br>
The inventors have also found that the lubricants of the present invention can comprise lower than conventional amounts (e.g. 4% or less) of dispersant, which is normally provided by the detergent inhibitor (Dl), and still meet the current industry soot handling tests for passenger car and heavy duty commercial diesel engines.<br>
By "adversely affecting the viscosity of the lubricant", we mean increasing the viscosity of the lubricant to an unacceptable level, for example, a level defined in a standard industry test such as the Mack T8 Test.<br>
Highly functionalised graft copolymers suitable for use in the present invention may be prepared using either a solution grafting process or a melt grafting process.<br>

The following tests were conducted to show that lubricants falling within the present invention are capable of dispersing soot produced by diesel engines without adversely affecting the viscosity of the lubricant. All treat rates are given as percent weight.<br>
Illustration of Passenger Car Diesel Soot Handling- BMW TDS<br>
Test Procedure- BMWTDS 80 HOUR TEST<br>
The BMW TDS test was carried out using a new type M51 engine for each series of tests. The engine was a 2.5 litre, 6 cylinder, turbocharged and intercooled indirect injection diesel engine. The engine was adapted for engine test bed operation. The modifications were made to the fuel system, the oil cooling system and the engine cooling system.<br>
After the engine was installed ready for the test, a 7 hour break-in procedure was run. The break-in procedure was followed by an 80 hour reference test using a high quality, commercially available, fully synthetic engine oil. The BMW TDS test involved a 15 hour period of increasing engine speeds and loads, which was then repeated twice for a total of 45 hours running time. This was followed by a 5 hour period of low/ medium speed with maximum load, followed by 5 hours of medium speed with maximum load. The test was completed by 25 hours at maximum engine speed and load. The test conditions are given below.<br>
Following the reference test on a new engine, 4 candidate runs were conducted. Prior to each candidate, a comprehensive engine flush was performed to remove all traces of the previous oil. The candidates were compared to the reference run because the<br><br>
engine used in the test was not built to laboratory standards. Evaluation of each test was by sludge measurement, oil consumption and used oil analysis.<br>
In the examples below, the detergent inhibitor (Dl) package was constant, with the exception of the type and amount of dispersant present.<br>
Example A1<br>
A 15W50 oil was blended in Exxon base stocks with a NDVII (an unfunctionalised olefin copolymer, Paratone 8002, available from Exxon Chemical Company). The level of dispersant (LZ6420, available from Lubrizol Corp.) present in the lubricant formulation was 6.5%.<br>
Example A2<br>
As for Example A1 except that the dispersant level was reduced to 1.5% in the finished lubricant and over half of the NDVII was replaced with a highly functionalised graft copolymer (0.88% weight by solids). The highly functionalised graft copolymer was the graft copolymer prepared in Example 10 of WO 96/12746.<br>
Results<br>
These are summarised in the tables below.<br>
The results from Examples A1 and A2 were very similar, despite the fact that the level of dispersant in the finished lubricant was 6.5% in Example A1 but only 1.5% in Example A2.<br>
Conclusion<br><br>
These results show that use of the highly functionalised graft copolymer defined in the present patent application at 0.88% weight by solids provides the same dispersancy as the use of 5% dispersant, which is provided by the Dl package, in the finished lubricant formulation. Therefore, the use of the highly functionalised graft copolymer makes it possible to control soot related viscosity increase in a lubricant in a diesel engine with a Dl package comprising a much lower amount of dispersant.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Test ends at 80 hours plus the power curve time (approx. 25 mins) plus the oil levelling times.<br>
Oil samples to be taken at 50, 60, 70, 80 WITH ENGINE RUNNING.<br>
OPERATING CONDITIONS<br>
Listed in the attached table are the operating conditions for the final 25 hour endurance period of the BMW TDS Oil Thickening Test.<br><br><br>
Further Illustration of Passenger Car Diesel Soot Handling- The "XUD11ATE" Engine Test<br>
The XUD11 ATE engine test (CEC L-56-T-95) is a recently established European test for determining the ability of a lubricant to control viscosity changes caused by soot that is produced as a by-product from the combustion process of modern passenger car diesel engines. The XUD11 ATE engine test is an integral part of the Association des Constructeurs Europeens D"Automobiles European Oil Sequences For Light Duty Diesel Engines. The test also evaluates sludge and piston cleanliness. A critical parameter is the viscosity increase in the lubricant at 3.0% soot in oil. The required level of soot must be achieved before the end of the test.<br>
EXAMPLE B1:<br>
A formulation similar to A2 was assessed in the XUD11ATE test as a 15W50 in BP<br>
stocks. The highly functionalised graft copolymer was PARATONE 8500 (available<br><br>
.   from Exxon Chemical Company) at 0.88% solids, with an additional 5% of NDVII (PARATONE 8002, an unfunctionalised olefin copolymer) to adjust the viscometrics. The Dl package treat rate was 7.07%, which gave a dispersant level in the finished lubricant of 1.75%. The dispersant used in this Example was TLA1605X, available from The Texaco Additive Company.<br>
The test results meet the European ACEA B2-96 requirements for this engine test. The viscosity increase at 3% soot was 182.8%, the piston merit 43.2 and the sludge rating was 9.50.<br>
EXAMPLE B2:<br>
The above test was repeated replacing the TLA 1605X with 7.07% of an alternative dispersant, OLOA 375C (available from The Chevron Chemical Company). The level of the dispersant in the lubricant was again at 1.75%.<br>
The test results meet the European ACEA B2-96 requirements for this engine test. The viscosity increase at 3% soot was 195.1%, the piston merit 51.8 and the sludge rating was 9.57.<br>
CONCLUSION:<br>
Use of the lubricant comprising the highly functionalised graft copolymer controls the soot related viscosity increase and allows the lubricant to meet the industry specification at unexpectedly low dispersant treat rates (1.75%).<br>
Illustration of Heavy Duty Commercial Diesel Soot Handling- Mack T8 Test<br>
The Mack T8 engine test is an established test for determining the ability of a lubricant to control viscosity changes caused by soot that is produced as a by-product from the<br><br>
combustion process of modern heavy duty truck diesel engines. The Mack T8 engine test is an integral part of the American Petroleum Institute"s CG4 lubricant specification for on-highway trucks. The test also evaluates sludge and oil consumption. The critical parameter is the viscosity increase in the lubricant at 3.8% soot in oil, measured by Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The required level of soot may be achieved before the end of the test (250 hours). At the end of the test, the soot and viscosity increase are measured. These measurements are used as a measure of oil performance.<br>
Details of Mack T8 Test (ASTM 4485)<br>
Equipment:   Mack E7-350, six cylinder turbocharged, intercooled diesel engine. 12.0 litres, 350 BHP.<br>
Purpose:       Evaluation of viscometric performance and soot loading of engine oils in turbocharged and intercooled diesel engines.<br>
Test Conditions:      Duration, hrs	250 at full load<br>
Speed, rpm	1800<br>
Torque, lb/ft	1010-1031<br>
Oil sump temp, Â°C	102-107<br>
Coolant out temp, Â°C	85<br>
Fuel	0.03-0.05% Sulphur<br>
Method of Rating:    Viscosity increases from used oil in analysis are measured. Test<br>
method also stipulates max. oil consumption of 0.0005 Ibs/BHP/hr.<br>
In the examples below, we followed the Mack T8 Test (excluding the 3.8% requirement) to compare relative performance of Examples C1 and C2.<br><br>
In the examples below, the detergent inhibitor package was constant and the amount of dispersant derived from the Dl package was varied.<br>
Example C1<br>
A 15w40 was blended in Sun HPO Group 2 base stocks with a NDVII (an unfunctionalised olefin copolymer, Paratone 8011, available from Exxon Chemical Company). The level of dispersant used in the lubricant formulation was 4%.<br>
Example C2<br>
A 15w40 was blended in Sun HPO Group 2 base stocks with the highly functionalised graft copolymer obtained by following Example 10 of WO 96/12746. The level of dispersant derived from the Dl package present in the lubricant formulation was 1%.<br>
Results<br>
These are summarised in the table below.<br>
The results from Examples C1 and C2 are significantly different. At equivalent soot contents there are marked differences in the viscosity increase and soot particle sizes. Example C2, with the highly functionalised graft copolymer falling within the present invention (Example 10 of WO 96/12746), shows good viscosity control throughout the test. The average soot particle size is maintained at a relatively low value, which accounts for the lower viscosity increase. Example C2 also shows better sludge control.<br>
Conclusion<br>
These results show the use of a lubricant comprising the highly functionalised graft copolymer defined in the present application gives superior performance when compared to a conventional formulation which uses 3% more dispersant derived from a Dl package in the finished lubricant formulation.<br><br><br><br><br>
