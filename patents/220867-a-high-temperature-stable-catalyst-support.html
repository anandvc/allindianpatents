				<td>The present invention relates to a high temperature stable catalyst support.<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to catalyst supports having high surface area and<br>
stability in ultra high temperature conditions - and also to the catalytic conversion of light<br>
hydrocarbons (e.g., natural gas) to produce synthesis gas.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is well known that the efficiency of supported catalyst systems is often related to the<br>
surface area on the support. This is especially true for systems using precious metal catalysts or<br>
other expensive catalysts. The greater the surface area, the more catalytic material is exposed to<br>
the reactants and the less time and catalytic material is needed to maintain a high rate of<br>
productivity.<br>
Alumina (A^Os) is a well-known support for many catalyst systems. It is also well<br>
known that alumina has a number of crystalline phases such as alpha-alumina (often noted as aalumina<br>
or a-AlaO3), gamma-alumina (often noted as y-alumina or y-Al2O3) as well as a myriad of<br>
alumina polymorphs. One of the properties of gamma-alumina is that it has a very high surface<br>
area. This is commonly believed to be because the aluminum and oxygen-molecules are in a<br>
crystalline structure or form that is not very densely packed. Gamma-AlaQa is a particularly<br>
important inorganic oxide refractory of widespread technological importance in the field of<br>
catalysis, often serving as a catalyst support. Gamma-A^Oa is an exceptionally good choice for<br>
catalytic applications because of a defect spinel crystal lattice that imparts to it a structure that is<br>
both open and capable of high surface area. Moreover, the defect spinel structure has vacant cation<br>
sites giving the gamma-alumina some unique properties. Gamma-alumina constitutes a part of the<br>
series known as the activated, transition aluminas, so-called because it is one of a series of aluminas<br>
that can undergo transition to different polymorphs. Santos et al. (Materials Research, 2000, vol. 3<br>
(4), pp. 104-114) disclosed the different standard transition aluminas using Electron Microscopy<br>
studies, whereas Zhou et al. (Acta Cryst, 1991, vol. B47, pp. 617-630) and Cai et al. (Phys. Rev.<br>
Lett., 2002, vol. 89, pp. 235501) described the mechanism of the transformation of gamma-alumina<br>
to theta-alumina.<br>
The oxides of aluminum and the corresponding hydrates, can be classified according to<br>
the arrangement of the crystal lattice; y-AkOa being part of the 7 series by virtue of a cubic close<br>
packed (ccp) arrangement of oxygen groups. Some transitions within a series are known; for<br>
example, low-temperature dehydration of an alumina trihydrate (gibbsite&gt; 7-Al(OH)3) at 100°C<br>
provides an alumina monohydrate (boehmite, y-A!O(OH)). Continued dehydration at temperatures<br>
below 450°C in the 7 series leads to the transformation from boehmite to the completely dehydrated<br>
y-AhO.!. Further heating may result in a slow and continuous loss of surface area and a slow<br>
conversion to other polymorphs of alumina having much lower surface areas. Higher temperature<br>
treatment ultimately provides a-A^O.i, a denser, harder oxide of aluminum often used in abrasives<br>
and refractories. Unfortunately, when gamma-alumina is heated to high temperatures, the structure<br>
of the atoms collapses such that the surface area decreases substantially. The most dense crystalline<br>
form of alumina is alpha-alumina. Thus, alpha-alumina has the lowest surface area, but is the most<br>
stable at high temperatures. The structure of alpha-alumina is less well suited to certain catalytic<br>
applications, such as in the Fischer-Tropsch process because of a closed crystal lattice, which<br>
imparts a relatively low surface area to the catalyst particles.<br>
Alumina is ubiquitous as supports and/or catalysts for many heterogeneous catalytic<br>
processes. Some of these catalytic processes occur under conditions of high temperature, high<br>
pressure and/or high water vapor pressure. The prolonged exposure to high temperature typically<br>
exceeding 1,000 "C, combined with a significant amount of oxygen and sometimes steam can result<br>
in catalyst deactivation by support sintering. The sintering of alumina has been widely reported in<br>
the literature (see for example Thevenin et al, Applied Catalysis A: General, 2001, vol. 212, pp.<br>
189-197) and the phase transformation due to an increase in operating temperature is usually<br>
accompanied by a sharp decrease in surface area. In order to prevent this deactivation<br>
phenomenon!, various attempts have been made to stabilize the alumina support against thermal<br>
deactivation (see Beguin et al., Journal of Catalysts, 1991, vol. 127, pp. 595-604; Chen et al.,<br>
Applied Catalysis A: General, 2001, vol. 205, pp. 159-172).<br>
The research focusing on the thermal stabilization of alumina led to the development of<br>
high temperature-resistant materials such as hexaaluminates (Matsuda et al., 8th International<br>
Congress on Catalysis Proceedings, Berlin, 1984, vol. 4, pp. 879-889; Machida et al., Chemistry<br>
Letters, 1987, vol. 5, pp. 767-770) and the investigation of other potential oxide materials such as<br>
perovskites, spinels, and garnets, which have been examined with respect to both the thermal<br>
stability and catalytic performance.<br>
Hexaaluminate structures have been shown to be effective structures for combustion<br>
catalysts because they provide excellent thermal stability and a higher surface area than alphaalumina.<br>
Of particular interest, Arai and coworkers in Japan have developed hexaaluminates and<br>
substituted hexaluminates as combustion catalysts (Arai &amp; Machida, Catalysis Today, 1991, vol.<br>
10, pp. 81-95), and showed that the most promising stabilizer for combustion catalysts was barium<br>
(Arai &amp; Machida, Applied Catalysis A: General, 1996, vol. 138, pp. 161-176). The investigation of<br>
the hexaaluminate material for the use of combustion has been described for example in Machida et<br>
al. (Journal of Catalysis, 1990, vol. 123, pp. 477-485) and in Groppi et al. (Applied Catalysis A:<br>
general, 1993, vol. 104, pp. 101-108). Machida et al. (Journal of American Ceramic Society, 1988,<br>
vol. 71, pp.1142-1147) discovered that the crystal growth of one type of hexaaluminates, betaalumina,<br>
also known as magnetoplumbite, was quite slow and anisotropic, and they proposed that<br>
its anisotropic growth may be the reason why the hexaaluminate can retain a large surface area at<br>
elevated temperatures. Arai and Machida (Catalysis Today, 1991, vol. 10, pp. 81-95) also disclosed<br>
that the thermal resistance of hexaaluminates seems to be quite dependent on the preparation<br>
procedures, primarily due to the difference of formation mechanism of hexaaluminates in various<br>
procedures. Kato et al. (Journal of American Ceramic Society, 1987, vol. 71(7), pp. C157-C159)<br>
disclosed a co-precipitation method to prepare mixtures of lanthanum and aluminum precursors,<br>
which resulted in formation of lanthanum beta-alumina structures with high surface area.<br>
Destabilization of the support is not the sole cause of catalyst deactivation at high<br>
temperature. Stabilizing the catalytically active species on a thermally stable support is also needed.<br>
When an active species is supported on an oxide support, solid state reactions between the active<br>
species and the oxide support can take place at high temperature, creating some instability. That is<br>
why Machida et al. (Journal of Catalysis, 1989, vol. 120, pp. 377-386) proposed the introduction of<br>
cations of active species through direct substitution in the lattice site of hexaaluminates in order to<br>
suppress the deterioration originating from the solid state reaction between the active species and<br>
the oxide support. These cation-substituted hexaaluminates showed excellent surface area retention<br>
and high catalytic activity (see the hexaaluminate examples with Sr, La, Mn combinations in<br>
Machida et al., Journal of Catalysis, 1990, vol. 123, pp. 477-485). Therefore the preparation<br>
procedure for high temperature catalysts is critical for thermal stability and acceptable surface area.<br>
It has long been a desire in the catalyst support arts to have a form of alumina that has<br>
high surface area like gamma-alumina and stability at high temperature like alpha-alumina. Such<br>
a catalyst support would have many uses.<br>
One such use is in the production of synthesis gas in a catalytic partial oxidation reactor.<br>
Synthesis gas is primarily a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide and can be made from the<br>
partial burning of light hydrocarbons with oxygen. The hydrocarbons, such as methane or ethane<br>
are mixed with oxygen or oxygen containing gas and heated. When the mixture comes in contact<br>
with an active catalyst material at a temperature above an initiation temperature, the reactants<br>
quickly react generating synthesis gas and a lot of heat. This very fast reaction requires only<br>
milliseconds of contact of the reactant gases with the catalyst. The combination of high<br>
exothermicity and very fast reaction time causes reactor temperatures to exceed 800 °C, often going<br>
above 1,000 °C and even sometimes going above 1,200 °C. Since catalysts used in the partial<br>
oxidation of hydrocarbons are typically supported, the support should be able to sustain this high<br>
thermal condition during long-term operation. In other words, a stable catalyst support which<br>
retains most of its surface area while enduring very high temperature, is desirable for long catalyst<br>
life.<br>
The reaction pathway for partial oxidation of methane to synthesis gas is still being<br>
debated. Two alternate pathways have been proposed (Dissanayake et al., J. Catal., 1991, vol. 132,<br>
pp. 117; Jin et al., Appl. Catal., 2000, vol. 201, pp. 71; Heitne et al., Catal. Today, 1995, vol. 24, pp.<br>
211).<br>
CH4 + 2 O2 -&gt; CO2 + 2 H2O<br>
CH4 + CO2 -&gt; 2 CO + 2 H2 Scheme 1<br>
CH4 + H2O -&gt; CO + 3 H2<br>
CH4 -&gt; CHX + H<br>
2 H -&gt; H2 Scheme 2<br>
O2 -&gt; 2 O<br>
CHX + O -&gt; CO + Hx<br>
These two pathways have come to be known as the combustion-reforming mechanism (Scheme 1),<br>
and the direct partial oxidation mechanism (Scheme 2). In Scheme 1, methane is completely<br>
oxidized to CO2 and water, and CO is a result of the reforming of water and CO2 with the residual<br>
methane. In Scheme 2, methane is pyrolyzed over the catalyst to produce CO directly without the<br>
pre-formation of CO2.<br>
Weng, et al. (The Chemical Record, 2002, vol. 2, pp. 102-113) reported in situ Fourier<br>
transform infrared (FTIR) studies of the catalytic partial oxidation (CPOX) mechanism of methane<br>
over rhodium and ruthenium based catalysts supported on silica and alumina. They specifically<br>
studied the influence of the catalyst pretreatment conditions, and their relationship with the<br>
concentration of oxygen species on the surface of the catalysts under reaction conditions. They<br>
concluded that a) the CPOX mechanism, whether based on Scheme 2 (i.e., -direct oxidation) or<br>
based on Scheme 1 (combustion/reforming), is determined by the amount of O3" on the catalyst<br>
surface; b) an oxidized catalyst, such as Rh2O.i, promotes the combustion/reforming mechanism<br>
(Scheme 1), whereas rhodium in the reduced state will promote the direct pathway (Scheme 2); c)<br>
rhodium on gamma-alumina under normal feed conditions of methane to molecular oxygen ratio in<br>
the feed will contain mostly oxidized Rh, even if rhodium was pre-reduced; d) the reducibility of<br>
rhodium is greatly affected by the support; and e) a lower reduction peak temperature, as measured<br>
by temperature-programmed reduction (TPR), indicates a weaker Rh-O bond.<br>
A weaker Rh-O bond would lead to easier removal of the surface oxygen, and therefore<br>
the lower TPR temperature peak. During normal operating conditions, a weaker Rh-O bond should<br>
promote reduced rhodium on the surface, which would favor a direct pathway. In turn, this would<br>
lead to lower catalyst surface temperatures, which should slow the alumina phase transformation to<br>
ultimately alpha-A^O^ (also slowing deactivation).<br>
Roh et al. (Chemistry Letters, 2001, vol. 7, pp. 666-667) reported that nickel based partial<br>
oxidation catalyst based on theta-alumina had high activity as well as high stability, and they<br>
ascribed the excellent performance of these catalyst to the combination of the strong interactions<br>
between nickel and theta-alumina and the coexistence of reduced and oxidized nickel species. Liu<br>
et al. (Korean J. Chem. Eng., 2002, vol. 19, pp. 742-748) have also shown that a protective layer<br>
between Ce-ZrO2 and theta-alumina is formed to suppress the formation of nickel-aluminate spinel<br>
structures, which would result in catalyst deactivation. Moreover Miao et al. (Appl. Catal. A, 1997,<br>
vol. 154, pp. 17-27) indicated that the modification with an alkali metal (Li, Na, K) oxide and a rare<br>
earth metal (La, Ce, Y, Sm) oxide improved the ability of a nickel catalyst on alumina to suppress<br>
carbon deposition over the catalyst during partial oxidation of methane. Therefore the type of<br>
support used and the catalytic metal-support interactions are major factors in the catalyst stability<br>
and can have an effect on the reaction mechanism.<br>
In addition to the selection and careful preparation of the support, catalyst composition<br>
also plays an important role in catalyst activity in catalytic partial oxidation of light hydrocarbons<br>
and selectivity towards to the desired products. Noble metals typically serve as the best catalysts<br>
for the partial oxidation of methane. Noble metals are however scarce and expensive, making their<br>
use economically challenging especially when the stability of the catalyst is questionable. One of<br>
the better known noble metal catalysts for catalytic partial oxidation comprises rhodium.<br>
Rhodium-based syngas catalysts deactivate very fast due to sintering of both catalyst support and/or<br>
metal particles. Prevention of any of these undesirable phenomena is well-sought after in the art of<br>
catalytic partial oxidation process, particularly for successful and economical operation at<br>
commercial scale.<br>
It would therefore be highly desirable to create a thermally-stable high surface area<br>
support with a metal from Groups 8, 9, or 10 of the Periodic Table of the Elements (based on the<br>
new IUPAC notation, which is used throughout the present specification), particularly with<br>
rhodium, loaded onto said support for highly productive long lifetime catalysts for the syngas<br>
production, specifically via partial oxidation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

support and more preferably less than 100 wt% down to as little as 1 wt% of the material weight in<br>
the catalyst support. In preferred embodiments, the thermally stable support comprises between<br>
about 1 wt% and about 50 wt% of said rare earth aluminate. In other embodiments, the thermally<br>
stable aluminum-based catalyst support could comprise between 40 wt% and 100 wt% of rare earth<br>
aluminate; and in some cases, the support is a rare earth aluminate or a mixture of rare earth<br>
aluminates with a molar ratio of aluminum to rare earth metal greater than 5:1. The thermally<br>

preferably between about 1 wt% and about 10 wt% of rare earth metal. The rare earth aluminate<br>
preferably comprises lanthanum, praseodymium, cerium, neodymium, samarium, or combinations<br>
thereof. In preferred embodiments, the rare earth aluminate comprises a hexaaluminate-like<br>
structure, a beta-alumina like structure, or combinations thereof. In these preferred embodiments,<br>
the thermally stable catalyst support comprises at least one rare earth aluminate with an aluminumto-<br>
rare earth molar ratio between 11:1 and 14:1; and at least one aluminum oxide phase selected<br>
from alpha-alumina, theta-alumina, or combinations thereof. The thermally stable aluminum-based<br>
material may further comprise a transition alumina, such as delta-alumina, eta-alumina, kappaalumina,<br>

The method for making a high surface area aluminum-based support includes applying at<br>

wherein the heat treatment conditions are selected such that a portion of the aluminum-containing<br>
precursor is transformed to a transition alumina and optionally to alpha-alumina, wherein the<br>

kappa-alumina, or any combinations thereof. The heat treatment can be also effective in<br>
transforming another portion of the aluminum-containing precursor to an aluminate comprising at<br>
least a portion of said stabilizing agent, and wherein the resulting support is preferably substantially<br>
free of gamma-alumina. The stabilizing agent preferably comprises a rare earth metal. The<br>

earth metal molar ratio greater than 5:1. The heat treatment is performed in a manner effective<br>
to obtain about 1 wt% and 100 wt% of said rare earth aluminate in the thermally stable catalyst<br>
support. In preferred embodiments, the heat treatment is performed in a manner effective to obtain<br>
between about 1 wt% and about 50 wt% of said rare earth aluminate in the thermally stable support.<br>
In other embodiments, the heat treatment is performed in a manner effective to obtain between 40<br>
wt% and 100 wt% of rare earth aluminate in the thermally stable catalyst support. In some alternate<br>
embodiment, the heat treatment is performed in a manner effective to transform all of the<br>
aluminum-containing precursor to at least one rare earth aluminate with an aluminum-to-rare earth<br>
metal molar ratio greater than 5:1. The application and heating steps preferably employ an<br>
impregnation technique and calcination in an oxidizing atmosphere, respectively. Additionally, the<br>
heat treatment step is effective to transform another portion of said aluminum-containing precursor<br>
to an aluminum oxide phase comprising alpha-alumina, a transition alumina, or combinations<br>
thereof, wherein the transition alumina comprises delta-alumina, eta-alumina, kappa-alumina, chialumina,<br>

phase selected from the group consisting of alpha-alumina, theta-alumina, or any combinations<br>
thereof; and between about 1 wt% and about 50 wt% of a rare earth aluminate with a molar ratio of<br>
aluminum to said rare earth metal greater than 5:1. In other embodiments, the thermally stable<br>
aluminum-based catalyst support could comprise more than 40 wt% of rare earth aluminate and less<br>
than 100 wt% of rare earth aluminate.<br>
The present invention can be more specifically seen as a support, process and catalyst for<br>
a partial oxidation reaction, wherein the support comprises a rare earth aluminate having a molar<br>
ratio of aluminum to rare earth metal greater than 5:7, and wherein the rare earth aluminate<br>
preferably comprises an element selected from the group consisting of lanthanum, cerium,<br>
praseodymium, samarium, and neodymium. The support may comprise between 1 wt% to 100 wt%<br>
of the rare earth aluminate. In preferred embodiments, the thermally stable support comprises<br>
between about 1 wt% and about 50 wt% of said rare earth aluminate. In other embodiments, the<br>
thermally stable aluminum-based catalyst support could comprise between 40 wt% and 100 wt% of<br>
the rare earth aluminate; and in some alternate embodiments, the support is a rare earth aluminate or<br>
a mixture of rare earth aluminates with an aluminum to rare earth metal molar ratio greater than 5:1.<br>
The supported catalyst comprises at least one catalytically active metal selected from the group<br>
consisting of rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, platinum, palladium, and rhenium, preferably selected<br>
from the group consisting of rhodium, iridium, and ruthenium, and optionally the catalyst can also<br>
comprise a promoter.<br>
More particularly, the invention relates to processes for the catalytic partial oxidation of<br>
light hydrocarbons (e.g., methane or natural gas) to produce primarily synthesis gas and the use of<br>
such supported catalysts to make carbon monoxide and hydrogen under conditions of high gas<br>
hourly space velocity, elevated pressure and high temperature.<br>
The process for making synthesis gas comprises converting a gaseous hydrocarbon stream<br>
and an oxygen-containing stream over a partial oxidation catalyst, to make a product stream<br>
comprising CO and H2, wherein said partial oxidation catalyst includes an active ingredient<br>
comprising rhodium, iridium, platinum, palladium, ruthenium, or combinations thereof; and a<br>
support comprising a rare earth aluminate, said rare earth aluminate having a molar ratio of<br>
aluminum to rare earth metal greater than 5:1. The support could comprise between about 1 wt%<br>
and 100 wt% of said rare earth aluminate, preferably between about 1 wt% and about 50 wt% of<br>
said rare earth aluminate. In other embodiments, the support could comprise between 40 wt% and<br>
100 wt% of the rare earth aluminate; and in some alternate embodiments, the support is a rare earth<br>
aluminate or a mixture of rare earth aluminates with an molar ratio of aluminum to rare earth metal<br>
greater than 5:1. The rare earth metal is selected from the group consisting of lanthanum,<br>
neodymium, praseodymium, cerium, and combinations thereof, and the support could comprise<br>
between about 1 wt% and about 20 wt% of the rare earth metal, but preferably between about 1<br>
wt% and about 10 wt% of the rare earth metal. The support may further comprise an aluminum<br>
oxide such as alpha-alumina, a transition alumina, or combinations thereof, wherein the transition<br>
alumina comprises delta-alumina, eta-alumina, kappa-alumina, chi-alumina, rho-alumina, kappaalumina,<br>
theta-alumina, or any combinations thereof. The transition alumina comprises preferably<br>
theta-alumina. The support may further comprise an oxide of said rare earth metal and/or an<br>
aluminate of said rare earth aluminate with a low aluminum to rare earth metal molar ratio, such as<br>
below 2:1.<br>
The present invention further relates to catalysts and processes for the conversion of<br>
gaseous light hydrocarbons for producing a hydrocarbon product, comprising primarily<br>
hydrocarbons with 5 carbons atoms or more (Cs+).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is based on the surprising discovery that a supported rhodium-based<br>
catalyst supported on an aluminum-based matrix modified with a lanthanum compound showed<br>
excellent performance with conversion and selectivities above 90%, and a sustainable activity over<br>
more than 300 hours on line while in contact with natural gas and molecular oxygen under suitable<br>
conditions for catalytic partial oxidation, namely at high temperatures and at high pressure. It was<br>
found that this catalyst i n i t i a l ly comprised about 65% theta-alumina phase, some small amount of<br>
alpha-alumina (10%), but was free of gamma-alumina. In addition the catalyst comprised a good<br>
portion of lanthanum aluminum mixed oxide compounds (La-Al-O) with a hexaaluminate-like<br>
structure (18%). This hexaaluminate-like structure comprised the majority of the lanthanum.<br>
Moreover this catalyst showed a low reduction peak temperature in a TPR analysis (shown in<br>
Figure 1), much lower than similar catalysts which comprised supports with less theta-alumina<br>
phase, more gamma-alumina, minimal amount of rare earth aluminates, and substantially almost no<br>
alpha-alumina, or for similar catalysts which comprised supports of mainly alpha-alumina.<br>
As described in Weng et al. (The Chemical Record, 2002, vol. 2, pp. 101-113), it is<br>
believed that a low TPR peak temperature is an indication of a loose Rh-O bond, thereby favoring<br>
the formation of reduced rhodium on the surface of the catalyst, which in turn favors the direct<br>
mechanism of partial oxidation (Scheme 2). The direct mechanism generates a lot less heat (the heat<br>
of CH4+ !/2 Oi reaction is -6.6 kcal/mol) whereas the combustion reaction in Scheme 1 generates<br>
much more heat (as the heat of CH4+ 2 O? is -191.3 kcal/mol). Therefore the direct mechanism<br>
should produce a cooler catalyst surface temperature. Without wishing to be bound to this theory,<br>
the Applicant believes that the presence of a theta-alumina phase might increase oxygen mobility,<br>
increases the fraction of rhodium in reduced state, increases the conversion of methane (and other<br>
light hydrocarbons) via the direct mechanism and thereby reduces the catalyst surface temperature.<br>
It is expected that a cooler catalyst surface temperature prevents or minimizes the formation of<br>
carbonaceous deposit on the catalyst surface, which is one of the source of catalyst deactivation.<br>
Another source of catalyst deactivation is the phase transformation of alumina to ultimately alphaalumina<br>
and concurring support disintegration, surface cracking and/or loss of surface area.<br>
Therefore a cooler catalyst surface temperature should also slow the rate the phase transformation<br>
of alumina, which is thermodynamically favored by increase in temperature.<br>
Modifying alumina (ANO?) with some rare earth metals has been proven to be effective in<br>
stabilizing the surface area of modified ANO}. Doping a gamma-alumina (y-AljO.-O with certain<br>
metal oxides such as for example lanthanum oxide (La2(&gt;0 inhibits or retards the phase<br>
transformation of gamma-alumina phase to theta-alumina (G-AbOj) phase and eventually to alphaalumina<br>
(a-ANO.-O phase and thus stabilizes the surface area and pore structure of the alumina<br>
material even at high calcination temperatures above 1,000 °C. Not only doping the surface of<br>
gamma-alumina (y-AliOj) can stabilize the surface structure of aluminum oxide (AliO.-O and thus<br>
delay the phase transformation to alpha alumina, but also it can slow down the sintering at high<br>
temperatures. The driving force for sintering is the minimization of surface free energy, and thus<br>
thermodynamically, sintering is an irreversible process in which a free energy decrease is brought<br>
about by a decrease in surface area. Sintering is usually initiated on the particle surface at elevated<br>
temperature, in a range where surface atoms become mobile and where diffusional mass transport is<br>
appreciable. The formation of Ln-Al-O mixed oxide compounds could inhibit the surface diffusion<br>
of species responsible for sintering, and thereby may be one of the key stabilization factors on an<br>
alumina surface at high temperatures.<br>
The formation of highly thermal stable La-Al-O mixed oxide compounds such as those of<br>
hexaaluminate-type structure should also ultimately help maintain a relatively high surface area.<br>
However, it is not clear from the literature that the formation of lanthanum aluminates with<br>
hexaaluminate-like or beta-alumina structures from an alumina precursor modified with lanthanum<br>
would explain an improved thermal stability of this catalyst. Beguin et al (1991) in fact disclosed<br>
that the formation of lanthanum beta-alumina structures was associated with the loss of the<br>
stabilizing effect of lanthanum on an alumina-based material; and therefore showed that the<br>
formation of lanthanum beta-alumina structures was detrimental to the stabilization effect<br>
associated with the modification of alumina by lanthanum. Oudet et al (Applied Catalysis, 1991,<br>
vol. 75, pp. 119-132) attributed the stabilization of alumina by lanthanum to the nucleation of a<br>
cubic lanthanum aluminum oxide structure (LaAlO.i) on the surface of the alumina support, which<br>
inhibits the surface diffusion of species responsible for sintering.<br>
As for the method of preparation, Schaper et al. (Applied Catalysis, 1983, vol. 7, pp. 211-<br>
220) who studied the influence of addition of lanthanum (0-5 mol% La^O^) on the thermal stability<br>
of gamma-alumina between 800 and 1,100 °C, did not observed the formation of lanthanum<br>
hexaaluminate even though they observed a retardation in the sintering of gamma-alumina by the<br>
presence of perovskite-type lanthanum aluminate (LaAlOi). The discrepancy between the formation<br>
of lanthanum hexaaluminate structures in Kato et al. (1987) and the absence of lanthanum<br>
hexaaluminate structures in Schaper et al (1983) is most likely attributed to the differences of the<br>
preparation method. Kato et al. mentioned that, with the impregnation technique, the higher<br>
concentration of lanthanum at the surface layer of the alumina phase probably tends to favor the<br>
formation of a lanthanum aluminate with a low aluminum-to-lanthanum ratio. However, according<br>
to this invention, lanthanum aluminates with a high aluminum-to-lanthanum ratio were being<br>
formed using an impregnation technique. It was quite unexpected, first to find that lanthanum<br>
hexaaluminate-like structures were formed in a catalyst support made by an impregnation technique<br>
on a lanthanum precursor on a gamma-alumina, and that, second, the presence of lanthanum<br>
hexaaluminate-like structures in a catalyst support did result in a more stable performance of the<br>
catalyst made therefrom. Therefore, this invention relates to a catalyst support, which comprises a<br>
rare earth aluminate with a high aluminum-to-rare earth molar ratio, and to catalysts made<br>
therefrom used in high temperature environments which show unexpected good thermal stability<br>
and have a greater surface area than those catalysts supported on alpha-alumina under similar<br>
operating conditions.<br>
Herein will be described in detail, specific embodiments of the present invention, with the<br>
understanding that the present disclosure is to be considered an exemplification of the principles of<br>
the invention, and is not intended to limit the invention to that illustrated and described herein. The<br>
present invention is susceptible to embodiments of different forms or order and should not be<br>
interpreted to be limited to the specifically expressed methods or compositions or applications<br>
contained herein. In particular, various embodiments of the present invention provide a number of<br>
different combinations of features to generate high surface area supports for high temperature<br>
applications, which also comprise very good thermal stability.<br>
SUPPORTS<br>
The thermally stable supports according to this invention can have different forms such as<br>
monolith or particulate or have discrete or distinct structures. The term "monolith" as used herein is<br>
any singular piece of material of continuous manufacture such as solid pieces of metal or metal<br>
oxide or foam materials or honeycomb structures. The terms "distinct" or "discrete" structures or<br>
units, as used herein, refer to supports in the form of divided materials such as granules, beads, pills,<br>
pastilles, pellets, cylinders, trilobes, extrudates, spheres or other rounded shapes, or another<br>
manufactured configuration. Alternatively, the divided material may be in the form of irregularly<br>
shaped particles. Preferably at least a majority (i.e., &gt;50%) of the particles or distinct structures<br>
have a maximum characteristic length (i.e., longest dimension) of less than six millimeters,<br>
preferably less than three millimeters. The support is preferably in discrete structures, and<br>
particulates are more preferred.<br>
Thermally stable catalyst support comprising a rare earth aluminate with Al:Ln &gt; 5:1<br>
This invention relates to a thermally stable aluminum-based support comprising a rare<br>
earth aluminate with a high aluminum-to-rare earth molar ratio. The aluminum-to-rare earth molar<br>
ratio (AI:Ln) is greater than 5:1; preferably greater than about 10; and more preferably between<br>
about 11:1 and about 14:1. Preferably the thermally stable aluminum-based contains at least one<br>
rare eaith aluminate selected from a rare earth hexaaluminate-like structure and/or a rare earth betaalumina-<br>
like structure.<br>
The thermally stable aluminum-based support may comprise between 1 wt% to 100 wt%<br>
of the rare earth aluminate with a high Al:Ln ratio. In preferred embodiments, the thermally stable<br>
support comprises between about 1 wt% and about 50 wt% of said rare earth aluminate; more<br>
preferably between about 5 wt% and about 45 wt% of the rare earth aluminate; and still more<br>
preferably between about 10 wt% and about 40 wt% of the rare earth aluminate. In other<br>
embodiments, the thermally stable aluminum-based catalyst support could comprise between 40<br>
wt% and 100 wt% of the rare earth aluminate; and in some alternate embodiments, one or more rare<br>
earth aluminates with high aluminum-to-rare earth molar ratios (greater than 5:1) comprises 100<br>
wt% of the support. The support in the catalyst could comprise between about 1 wt% and 100 wt%<br>
of said rare earth aluminate. In preferred embodiments, the support in the catalyst comprises<br>
between about 1 wt% and about 50 wt% of said rare earth aluminate. In other embodiments, the<br>
support in the catalyst could comprise more than 40 wt% of rare earth aluminate, i.e., between 40<br>
wt% and 100 wt% of rare earth aluminate; and in some cases, the support is a rare earth aluminate<br>
or a mixture of rare earth aluminates with a molar ratio of aluminum to rare earth metal greater than<br>
5:1. It should be readily appreciated that there are preferences within the 1 wt%-100 wt% range for<br>
the rare earth aluminate content of the support depending on the desired properties of the support.<br>
The support should contain between about 1 wt% and about 20 wt% of rare earth metal;<br>
preferably between about 1 wt% and about 10 wt% of rare earth metal. The rare earth aluminate<br>
preferably comprises a hexaaluminate-like structure, a beta-aluminate-like structure, or<br>
combinations thereof, such as a lanthanum hexaaluminate or a lanthanum beta-alumina. The rare<br>
earth aluminate comprises a rare earth metal selected from the group consisting of lanthanum,<br>
neodymium, praseodymium, and combinations thereof. In preferred embodiments, the rare earth<br>
aluminate comprises preferably La, and optionally Sm.<br>
It is envisioned that the rare earth aluminate with a high Al:Ln molar ratio could comprise<br>
different species of aluminates with varying AI:Ln molar ratios, as long as the different ratios are all<br>
greater than 5:1; or that the rare earth aluminate could comprise combinations of different rare earth<br>
aluminates of similar structure but comprising different rare earth metals. It should be appreciated<br>
that the rare earth aluminate could comprise any combinations of these features. For example, the<br>
support could comprise one rare earth aluminate with a Al:Ln ratio of 11:1 and an aluminate of the<br>
same rare earth metal with a higher Al:Ln ratio of 12:1. In another example, the support could<br>
comprise aluminates of two or more rare earth metals all with an AI:Ln ratio of 11:1.<br>
The thermally stable aluminum-based support could comprise between about 1 wt% and<br>
about 20 wt% of the rare earth metal; but preferably between about 1 wt% and about 10 wt%; more<br>
preferably between about 2 wt% and about 8 wt%; and still more preferably between about 4 wt%<br>
and about 8 wt%.<br>
This rare earth metal content corresponds to rare earth oxide loading between about 1.2<br>
wt% and about 23 wt% of the rare earth oxide; preferably between about 1.2 wt% and about 12<br>
wt%; more preferably between about 2.4 wt% and about 9.4 wt%; and still more preferably<br>
between about 4.7 wt% and about 9.4 wt%. This rare earth metal weight content also corresponds to<br>
rare earth oxide molar content between about 0.3 mol% and about 7 mol% of the rare earth oxide;<br>
preferably between about 0.3 mol% and about 3.5 mol% of the rare earth oxide; more preferably<br>
between about 0.6 mol% and about 2.6 mol%; and still more preferably between about 1.2 mol%<br>
and about 2.6 mol%. The rare earth oxide molar content is calculated as the ratio of the number of<br>
moles of rare earth oxide over the total number of moles of rare earth oxide and aluminum oxide.<br>
The selection of the rare earth loading on the support is dependent on the desirable range<br>
of the surface area of the support. There seems to be an optimum range of loadings for which the<br>
surface area is maximized as illustrated in Figures 3a and 3b. Beyond that range, thermal stability<br>
can still be achieved, but the support would have a lower surface area.<br>
The thermally stable aluminum-based support may also comprise an oxide of a rare earth<br>
metal. For example, the rare earth aluminate with a high Al:Ln ratio might comprise only a fraction<br>
of the loaded (or applied) rare earth metal, and the other fraction of the loaded rare earth metal may<br>
form a rare earth metal oxide.<br>
The thermally stable aluminum-based support may also comprise other rare earth<br>
aluminate structures with a low aluminum-to-rare earth metal molar ratio lower than 5:1, such as<br>
perovskite structures, monoclinic structures, or garnet structures with typically Al:Ln ratios less<br>
than 2:1.<br>
According to another embodiment of this invention, the thermally stable catalyst support<br>
further comprises an alumina phase selected from the group consisting of alpha-alumina, thetaalumina<br>
or any combinations thereof. The rare earth aluminate with a high Al:Ln molar ratio and<br>
the alumina phase could be intimately mixed, or the rare earth aluminate could coat the alumina<br>
phase partially or completely. A surface layer comprising said rare earth aluminate with a high<br>
AI:Ln molar ratio preferably covers either partially or completely the alumina phase surface; with a<br>
complete coverage being more preferred. Therefore a person skilled in the art could select a method<br>
of preparation to achieve a well-mixed rare earth aluminate and alumina combination, such as via a<br>
sol-gel method or a co-precipitation method, or to achieve a coating of rare earth aluminate over the<br>
alumina surface, such as via impregnation or chemical vapor deposition. For the later techniques,<br>
which result in a coating of rare earth aluminate over the alumina surface, the rare earth loading<br>
should be selected such that a desired coating is achieved. For example, one can estimate the<br>
necessary amount of rare earth aluminate to completely cover the surface of the support precursor<br>
by one monolayer of said rare earth aluminate.<br>
In preferred embodiments, the thermally stable catalyst support comprises a rare earth<br>
hexaaluminate structure, a rare earth beta-alumina structure, or combinations thereof.<br>
The rare earth aluminate could comprise a chemical formula of LnAlyOz, wherein Al and<br>
O represent aluminum atoms and oxygen atoms respectively; Ln comprises lanthanum,<br>
neodymium, praseodymium, cerium, or combinations thereof; y is between 11 and 14; and z is<br>
between 18 and 23.<br>
The rare earth aluminate could comprise a chemical formula of (LmO^.yCANOrO, where<br>
Ln comprises one rare earth metal chosen from lanthanum, neodymium, praseodymium, cerium, or<br>
combinations thereof; and y is between 11 and 14.<br>
In addition to comprising a rare earth metal, the rare earth aluminate may further comprise<br>
an element from Groups 1-L7 of the Periodic Table; particularly preferred, the rare earth aluminate<br>
may further comprise nickel, magnesium, barium, potassium, sodium, manganese, a second rare<br>
earth metal (such as samarium), or any combinations thereof.<br>
The rare earth aluminate preferably could comprise a chemical formula characterized by<br>
MAlyO,. wherein Al and O represent aluminum atoms and oxygen atoms respectively; y=ll-14;<br>
z=18-23; and wherein M preferably comprises at least one rare earth metal selected from lanthanum<br>
(La), cerium (Ce), praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), or combinations thereof. M could also<br>
comprise two or more elements from Groups 1-17 of the Periodic Table, with at least one of them<br>
being a rare earth metal. The other element is selected from Groups 1-14, and preferably comprises<br>
nickel, magnesium, barium, potassium, sodium, manganese, a second rare earth metal (such as<br>
samarium), or any combinations thereof. In preferred embodiments, M comprises preferably La,<br>
and optionally Sm. In some embodiments, M comprises both La and Sm.<br>
In more preferred embodiments, the rare earth aluminate comprises a lanthanum<br>
hexaaluminate. The lanthanum hexaaluminates have a chemical formula of (LaiOsXyXAUO.-O,<br>
where La represents lanthanum, and y is between 11 and 14.<br>
The thermally stable support may further comprise an oxide of said rare earth metal, said<br>
rare earth oxide consisting essentially of rare earth metal atoms and oxygen atoms. The oxide of<br>
said rare earth metal (Ln) preferably has a chemical formula of Ln^O.-?. It should be appreciated that<br>
in some cases, the combination of both rare earth aluminates and rare earth oxides in the catalyst<br>
support might be desirable to improve support stability.<br>
In addition, according to one embodiment, there is an expectation that a less acidic surface<br>
layer may encourage the formation of more uniform crystallites of a catalytically active metal<br>
resulting in smaller metal crystallite sizes. The catalysts made from these thermally stable catalyst<br>
supports of the present invention are expected to have excellent stability, high activity and extended<br>
catalyst lifetimes, while maintaining desirable selectivity, pore structure and particle size.<br>
This rare earth modified support with enhanced thermal stability which comprises a rare<br>
earth aluminate with a high Al:Ln molar ratio, has an initial minimum BET surface area of 2 nr/g,<br>
preferably greater than 5 m2/g, more preferably greater than about 7 m2/g, but no more than 30<br>
nr/g.<br>
High surface area catalyst support comprising at least theta-alurnina<br>
In another embodiment, a high surface area catalyst support is obtained by heat treatment<br>
of an alumina precursor with a stabilizing agent. The high surface area alumina support comprises a<br>
transition alumina comprising at least one alumina polymorph between gamma-alumina and alphaalumina,<br>
but excluding gamma-alumina and alpha-alumina. The transition alumina preferably<br>
comprises theta-alumina and is preferably substantially free of gamma-alumina. The high surface<br>
area alumina support may further comprise alpha-alumina and/or an aluminate of said stabilizing<br>
agent. The stabilizing agent comprises at least one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
boron, silicon, gallium, selenium, rare earth metals, transition metals, and alkali earth metals,<br>
preferably selected from the group consisting of boron (B), silicon (Si), gallium (Ga), selenium<br>
(Se), calcium (Ca), zirconium (Zr), iron, (Fe), cobalt (Co), manganese (Mn), magnesium (Mg), and<br>
the rare earth elements, i.e., scandium (Sc), ytrium (Y), lanthanum (La), cerium (Ce),<br>
praseodymium (Pr), neodymium (Nd), promethium (Pm), samarium (Sm), europium (Eu),<br>
gadolinium (Gd), terbium (Tb), dysprosium (Dy), holmium (Ho), erbium (Er), thulium (Tm),<br>
ytterbium (Yb), and lutetium (Lu). More preferably the stabilizing agent comprises La, Sm, Nd, Pr,<br>
Ce, Eu, Yb, Si, Ce, Mg, Ca, Mn, Co, Fe, Zr, or any combinations thereof. Most preferably, the<br>
stabilizing agent comprises La, Sm, Nd, Pr, Ce, Eu, Yb, Si, Mg, Co, or any combinations thereof.<br>
In addition, promoters may be applied to the stabilized support. Such deposited promoters may also<br>
maintain an improved dispersion on active species during catalyst preparation.<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, a high surface area alumina<br>
comprising mostly theta-alumina, which is modified with a rare earth metal and/or a rare earth<br>
metal oxide, serves as an improved support for synthesis gas production catalysts used in reactors<br>
operating at high-pressure and high-temperature. The catalyst support thus obtained tends to be<br>
more resistant to phase deterioration under highly thermal conditions than gamma-alumina, and yet<br>
provide greater surface area than alpha-alumina. This thermally stable catalyst support is porous<br>
and is suitable for use in high temperature environments. This surface area is typically higher that<br>
alpha-alumina, and its thermal stability greater than gamma-alumina. It has a surface area greater<br>
than 2 meter square per gram (m2/g), preferably between about 5 nr/g and 100 nr/g, more<br>
preferably between about 20 m2/g and 80 nr/g.<br>
One stabilized alumina support according to one embodiment of this invention preferably<br>
comprises, when fresh, at least 50% theta-alumina phase, preferably between about 60% and 75%<br>
theta-alumina; not more than about 20% alpha-alumina, and is preferably substantially free of<br>
gamma-alumina, i.e., less than about 5% gamma-alumina. In addition the support may comprise<br>
between about 1 wt% and about 50 wt% of a rare earth aluminate with a molar ratio of aluminum to<br>
rare earth metal greater than 5:1.<br>
CATALYSTS<br>
The present invention pertains to catalysts comprising one catalytically active metal on<br>
high surface area alumina supports or thermally stabilized aluminum-based supports, wherein the<br>
catalysts are active for the conversion of light hydrocarbons to synthesis gas. In particular, the<br>
current invention addresses the stability and durability of catalyst supports and catalysts made<br>
therefrom for use in catalytic partial oxidation reactors operating at high temperatures and<br>
pressures.<br>
Catalysts based on high surface area supports comprising at least theta-alumina<br>
According to one embodiment of the present invention, an alumina support comprising<br>
mostly theta-alumina, which is modified with one rare earth oxide, serves as an improved support<br>
for synthesis gas production catalysts used in reactors operating at high-pressure and hightemperature.<br>
The catalyst support thus obtained tends to be more resistant to phase deterioration<br>
under highly thermal conditions than gamma-alumina. The presence of mostly theta-alumina may<br>
result in a weaker R-O bond, where R is the catalytically active metal. The weaker R-O bond<br>
should lead to easier removal of the surface oxygen, and therefore a lower TPR temperature peak.<br>
During normal operating conditions, a weaker R-O bond would promote reduced active metal on<br>
the surface, which would favor a direct oxidation pathway (Scheme 2). In turn, this would lead to<br>
lower catalyst surface temperatures, which will slow the phase transformation of alumina to alphaalumina<br>
(also slows deactivation).<br>
Moreover, interactions between catalytically active metal and the alumina support are<br>
affected by the presence of the rare earth oxide. Without wishing to be bound to a particular theory,<br>
it is believed that the active metal-support interaction in catalysts supported on rare earth modified<br>
alumina, for example La^Orrnodified AhO^ is stronger than that in the similar catalysts supported<br>
on unmodified AbO^, and that this strong metal-support interaction in La2Ormodified A12O^<br>
supported catalysts might be another reason for the unusually high catalyst stability.<br>
The present invention also relates to improved catalyst compositions using a stabilized<br>
alumina support, as well as methods of making and using them, wherein the stabilized comprises a<br>
transition alumina phase (excluding gamma-alumina) between the low-temperature transition<br>
gamma-alumina and the high-temperature stable alpha-alumina, wherein the transition alumina is<br>
preferably theta-alumina, but could comprise low amounts of other transition alumina phases. In<br>
addition the stabilized alumina may comprise rare earth aluminates. The catalyst is supported on a<br>
stabilized alumina with an initial minimum BET surface area of 2 m2/g, preferably greater than 5<br>
m2/g, more preferably greater than 10 nr/g, but no more than 30 m2/g, after high temperature<br>
treatment or calcination. Preferably the stabilized alumina is modified with compounds of<br>
lanthanide metals, such as for example, compounds of lanthanum, samarium, praseodymium,<br>
cerium, or neodymium. Without wishing to be bound to a particular theory, it is believed that the<br>
metal-support interaction in catalysts supported on for example La^CVmodified AbO} is stronger<br>
than that in the catalyst supported on unmodified AbO}, and that this strong metal-support<br>

catalyst stability.<br>
Catalysts based on supports comprising a rare earth aluminate with a Al:Ln &gt;5:1<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, an alumina-containing support<br>
comprising a rare earth aluminate with an aluminum-to-rare earth metal molar ratio greater than 5:1,<br>
serves as an improved support for synthesis gas production catalysts used in reactors operating at<br>
high-pressure and high-temperature. The catalyst support thus obtained tends to be more resistant<br>
to phase deterioration under highly thermal conditions than gamma-alumina, and offers greater<br>
surface area than alpha-alumina. In addition to the presence of an alumina phase (either thetaalumina,<br>
alpha-alumina, or both), the presence of rare earth hexaaluminate structures is an<br>
indication that a distinct ordered aluminum structure comprising at least one rare earth metal is<br>
being formed during the preparation of the catalyst support. The formation of hexaaluminates<br>
comprising a rare earth metal during the preparation of the support described herein is believed to<br>
be another potential source of stabilization of the support, as the presence of rare earth aluminates<br>
most likely also affect the active metal-support interactions.<br>
Catalysts based on high surface area thermally stable supports<br>
This invention also relates to a partial oxidation catalyst comprising an active ingredient<br>
selected from the group consisting of rhodium, iridium, platinum, palladium, and ruthenium; an<br>
optional promoter; and a support comprising a rare earth aluminate with a molar ratio of aluminum<br>
to rare earth metal greater than 5:1. The support in the catalyst could comprise between about 1<br>
wt% and 100 wt% of said rare earth aluminate. In preferred embodiments, the support in the<br>
catalyst comprises between about 1 wt% and about 50 wt% of said rare earth aluminate. In other<br>
embodiments, the support in the catalyst could comprise more than 50 wt% of rare earth aluminate,<br>
i.e., between 40 wt% and 100 wt% of rare earth aluminate; and in some cases, the support is a rare<br>
earth aluminate or a mixture of rare earth aluminates with a molar ratio of aluminum to rare earth<br>
metal greater than 5:1, such as a lanthanum hexaaluminate or a lanthanum beta-alumina. The<br>
support should contain between about 1 wt% and about 20 wt% of rare earth metal; preferably<br>
between about 1 wt% and about 10 wt% of rare earth metal. The rare earth aluminate preferably<br>
comprises a hexaaluminate structure, a beta-aluminate structure, or combinations thereof. The rare<br>
earth aluminate comprises a rare earth metal selected from the group consisting of lanthanum,<br>
neodymium, praseodymium, and combinations thereof. In preferred embodiments, the rare earth<br>
aluminate comprises preferably La, and optionally Sin.<br>
A particularly preferred embodiment discloses a partial oxidation catalyst comprising an<br>
active ingredient selected from the group consisting of rhodium, iridium, platinum, palladium, and<br>
ruthenium; an optional promoter; and a support comprising an alumina phase selected from the<br>
group consisting of alpha-alumina, theta-alumina, or any combinations thereof; and a rare earth<br>
aluminate with a molar ratio of aluminum to rare earth metal greater than 5:1, and wherein the<br>
support comprises between about 1 wt% and about 50 wt% of said rare earth aluminate. The rare<br>
earth aluminate preferably comprises a hexaaluminate-like structure, a beta-aluminate-like<br>
structure, or any combinations thereof. The rare earth aluminate comprises a rare earth metal<br>
selected from the group consisting of lanthanum, neodymium, cerium, praseodymium, and<br>
combinations thereof. In preferred embodiments, the rare earth aluminate comprises preferably La,<br>
and optionally Sm.<br>
Another embodiment discloses a partial oxidation catalyst comprising an active ingredient<br>
selected from the group consisting of rhodium, iridium, and ruthenium; an optional promoter; and a<br>
rare earth aluminate, wherein the rare earth aluminate comprises an Al:Ln molar ratio between 11:1<br>
and 14:1. The rare earth aluminate preferably has a hexaaluminate like structure, a beta-aluminate<br>
like structure, or combinations thereof. The rare earth aluminate preferably comprises a rare earth<br>
metal selected from the group consisting of lanthanum, neodymium, cerium, praseodymium, and<br>
combinations thereof. In preferred embodiments, the rare earth aluminate comprises preferably La,<br>
and optionally Sm. The active ingredient and the optional promoter are preferably supported on said<br>
rare earth aluminate with a high Al:Ln molar ratio.<br>
All catalysts according to this invention can be used for producing synthesis gas, and<br>
therefore should comprise an active metal selected from the group consisting of metals from Groups<br>
8, 9, or 10 of the Periodic Table, rhenium, tungsten, molybdenum, and any mixtures thereof.<br>
Preferably the catalyst used for producing synthesis gas comprises rhodium, ruthenium, iridium,<br>
platinum, palladium, rhenium, or any combinations thereof. More preferably the catalyst used for<br>
producing synthesis gas comprises rhodium, ruthenium, iridium, or any combinations thereof.<br>
In some embodiments, the active metal may be comprised in an alloy form, preferably a<br>
rhodium alloy. Although not wishing the scope of this application to be limited to this particular<br>
theory, the Applicants believe that alloying rhodium with other metals appears to sustain the<br>
resistance of rhodium catalysts to sintering, and therefore to allow the Rh alloy catalysts to<br>
deactivate at a slower rate than syngas catalysts containing only rhodium. Suitable metals for the<br>
rhodium alloy generally include but are not limited to metals from Groups 8, 9, or 10 of the<br>
Periodic Table, as well as rhenium, tantalum, niobium, molybdenum, tungsten, zirconium and<br>
mixtures thereof. The preferred metals for alloying with rhodium are ruthenium, iridium, platinum,<br>
palladium, tantalum, niobium, molybdenum, rhenium, tungsten, cobalt, and zirconium, more<br>
preferably ruthenium, rhenium, and iridium. In accordance with the present invention, the loading<br>
of the active metal in the catalyst is preferably between 0.1 and 50 weight percent of the total<br>
catalyst weight (herein wt%).<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the catalyst comprises rhodium as the active<br>
metal. The rhodium content in the catalyst is between about 0.1 wt% to about 20 wt%, preferably<br>
from about 0.5 wt% to about 10 wt %, and more preferably from about 0.5 wt% to about 6 wt%.<br>
When a rhodium alloy is used, the other metal in the rhodium alloy preferably comprises from<br>
about 0.1 wt% to about 20 wt % of the catalyst, preferably from about 0.5 wt% to about 10 wt %,<br>
and more preferably from about 0.5 wt% to about 5 wt%. The other metal in the rhodium alloy<br>
could be iridium, ruthenium, or rhenium.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the catalyst comprises ruthenium as the active<br>
metal. The ruthenium content in the catalyst is between about 0.1 to 15 wt %, preferably from about<br>
1 to about 8 wt %, and more preferably from about 2 to about 5 wt %.<br>
The catalyst structure employed is characterized by having a metal surface area of at least<br>
0.5 square meters of metal per gram of catalyst structure, preferably at least 0.8 nr/g. Preferably<br>
the metal is rhodium and the rhodium surface area at least 0.5 square meters of rhodium per gram of<br>
supported catalyst, preferably at least 0.8 rrr/g.<br>
Catalyst compositions may also contain one or more promoters. In some embodiments<br>
when one active metal is rhodium, rhenium, ruthenium, palladium, platinum, or iridium, the<br>
promoter comprises an element selected from the group consisting of La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu,<br>
Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu, preferably Sm, Eu, Pr and Yb. The introduction of a<br>
lanthanide oxide, especially StrbO.i, on the stabilized alumina support surface before deposition of<br>
active metal is believed to further enhance the metal-support interaction, and that the active metal<br>
also disperses better on the surface of A12O3 modified with La^O} and/or SirbO;,. According to some<br>
embodiments with the use of a rhodium alloy, the presence of a promoter metal can be omitted<br>
without detriment to the catalyst activity and/or selectivity. It is foreseeable however that, in some<br>
alternate embodiments, a promoter could be added to a catalyst material comprising a rhodium<br>
alloy.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention is more preferably directed towards syngas<br>
catalysts used in partial oxidation reactions and even more preferably used in syngas catalysts that<br>
contain solely rhodium or rhodium alloys. However, it should be appreciated that the catalyst<br>
compositions according to the present invention are useful for other partial oxidation reactions,<br>
which are intended to be within the scope of the present invention.<br>
A preferred embodiment of this invention relates to a partial oxidation catalyst<br>
composition. The partial oxidation catalyst comprises an active ingredient selected from the group<br>
consisting of rhodium, iridium, platinum, palladium, and ruthenium; an optional promoter; and a<br>
support comprising an alumina phase selected from the group consisting of alpha-alumina, thetaalumina<br>
or any combinations thereof; and a rare earth aluminate comprising a rare earth metal,<br>
wherein the rare earth aluminate has a molar ratio of aluminum to rare earth metal greater than 5:1,<br>
and wherein the support comprises between about 1 wt% and about 50 wt% of said rare earth<br>
aluminate. The optional promoter comprises an element selected from the group consisting of La,<br>
Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu, preferably Sm, Eu, Pr and Yb. The<br>
preferred promoter comprises samarium.<br>
METHODS OF SUPPORT PREPARATION<br>
This invention covers several embodiments of means for making catalyst supports<br>
disclosed earlier. All method embodiments comprise an application step of at least one stabilizing<br>
agent followed by a high temperature treatment.<br>
Preferably the stabilizing agent comprises a rare earth metal. The rare earth metal is<br>
selected from lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, neodymium, samarium, or combinations. The<br>
aluminum-containing precursor may comprise at least one material selected from the group<br>
consisting of an oxide of aluminum, an aluminum salt, a salt of aluminum, an alkoxide of<br>
aluminum, a hydroxide of aluminum and any combination thereof. The aluminum-containing<br>
precursor comprises an aluminum structure selected from the group consisting of bayerite, gibbsite,<br>
boehmite, pseudo-boehmite, bauxite, gamma-alumina, delta-alumina, chi-alumina, rho-alumina,<br>
kappa-alumina, eta-alumina, theta-alumina, and any combinations thereof. The aluminumcontaining<br>
precursor preferably comprises a transition alumina selected from the group consisting<br>
of gamma-alumina, delta-alumina, chi-alumina, rho-alumina, kappa-alumina, eta-alumina, thetaalumina,<br>
and combinations thereof. In a preferred embodiment, the aluminum-containing precursor<br>
comprises mostly gamma-alumina.<br>
The gamma-alumina used as the aluminum-containing precursor in the present method of<br>
preparation of the catalyst support possesses a desired profile of physical characteristics with<br>
respect to, say, morphology and pore structure. Preferably, the gamma-alumina of the present<br>
method possesses a surface area between about 100 m2/g and about 300 m2/g; more preferably<br>
between about 120 m2/g and about 300 nr/g, but most preferably between about 120 nr/g and<br>
about 220 m2/g. The gamma-alumina as used in the present method further possesses a pore<br>
volume of at least about 0.2 ml/g. Any aluminum oxide, which meets these requirements in surface<br>
area and pore dimension, is called for the purpose of this patent gamma-alumina.<br>
It should be understood that the aluminum-containing precursor could be pre-treated prior<br>
to calcination or application of the stabilizing agent. The pre-treatment could be heating, spraydrying<br>
to for example adjust particle sizes, dehydrating, drying, steaming or calcining. When the<br>
aluminum-containing precursor comprises an aluminum oxide such as gamma-alumina, steaming<br>
can be done at conditions sufficient to transform the aluminum oxide into a hydrated form of said<br>
aluminum oxide, such as boehmite or pseudo-boehmite or gibbsite.<br>
The present process for preparing a stabilized alumina support may further comprise<br>
steaming the aluminum-containing precursor at conditions sufficient to at least partially transform<br>
the aluminum-containing precursor into a boehmite or pseudo-boehmite wherein steaming is<br>
defined as subjecting a given material, within the confines of an autoclave or other suitable device,<br>
to an atmosphere comprising a saturated or under-saturated water vapor at conditions of elevated<br>
temperature and elevated water partial pressure.<br>
In one aspect, the steaming of the modified alumina precursor is preferably performed at a<br>
temperature ranging from 150 °C to 500 °C, more preferably ranging from 180 °C to 300 °C, and<br>
most preferably ranging from 200 °C to 250 °C; a water vapor partial pressure preferably ranging<br>
from 1 bar to 40 bars, more preferably ranging from 4 bars to 20 bars, and most preferably from 10<br>
bars to 20 bars; and an interval of time preferably from 0.5 hour to 10 hours, and most preferably<br>
0.5 hour to 4 hours. Preferably, under these steaming conditions, the deposited aluminumcontaining<br>
precursor is at least partially transformed to at least one phase selected from the group<br>
boehmite, pseudo-boehmite and the combination thereof. A pseudo-boehmite refers to a<br>
monohydrate of alumina having a crystal structure corresponding to that of boehmite but having<br>
low crystallinity or ultrafine particle size. Alternatively, the optional steaming of the modified<br>
aluminum-containing precursor may comprise same conditions of temperature and time as above,<br>
but with a reduced water vapor partial pressure preferably ranging from 1 bar to 5 bar, and more<br>
preferably ranging from 2 bars to 4 bars.<br>
The compound or precursor of a stabilizing agent can be in the form of salt, acid, oxide,<br>
hydroxide, oxyhydroxide, carbide, and the like. Preferably the compound or precursor of a<br>
stabilizing agent is an oxide or a salt (such as carbonate, acetate, nitrate, chloride, or oxalate). The<br>
stabilizing agent comprises at least one element selected from the group consisting of aluminum,<br>
boron, silicon, gallium, selenium, rare earth metals, transition metals, alkali earth metals, their<br>
corresponding oxides or ions, preferably at least one element selected from the group consisting of<br>
B, Si, Ga, Se, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb, Lu, and their<br>
corresponding oxides or ions. More preferably, the stabilizing agent comprises La, Pr, Ce, Eu, Yb,<br>
Sm, their corresponding oxides, their corresponding ions, or any combinations thereof. Preferably<br>
the compound or precursor of the stabilizing agent comprises a nitrate salt or a chloride salt, as for<br>
example only La(NO.O?, or AI(NO3). It should be understood that more than one stabilizing agent or<br>
more than one compound or precursor of a stabilizing agent can be used.<br>
The stabilizing agent can be applied to the aluminum-containing precursor by means of<br>
different techniques. For example only, application methods can be spray-drying, impregnation,<br>
co-precipitation, chemical vapor deposition, and the like. It should also be understood that any<br>
combination of techniques or multiple steps of the same technique could be used to applying a<br>
stabilizing agent.<br>
One preferred technique for applying the stabilizing agent is impregnation, particularly<br>
incipient wetness impregnation. When the application is done via impregnation, a drying step at<br>
temperatures between 80 °C and 150 "C is performed on the modified aluminum-containing<br>
precursor prior to calcination.<br>
In another embodiment, the modified aluminum-containing precursor is derived from the<br>
aluminum-containing precursor by contacting the aluminum-containing precursor with the<br>
stabilizing agent so as to form a support material and treating the support material so as to form a<br>
hydrothermally stable support. Contacting the modified aluminum-containing precursor with the<br>
stabilizing agent preferably includes dispersing the aluminum-containing precursor in a solvent so as<br>
to form a sol, adding a compound of the stabilizing agent to the sol, and spraydrying the sol so as to<br>
form the support material. It should be understood that more than one stabilizing agents or more<br>
than one compound or precursors of a stabilizing agent can be added to the sol. Alternatively, one<br>
stabilizing agent can be incorporated into the support by means of the aforementioned techniques.<br>
Alternatively, two or more stabilizing agents can be incorporated into the support by means of the<br>
aforementioned techniques. The preferred stabilizing agent comprises at least one rare earth selected<br>
from the group consisting of lanthanum, cerium, praseodymium, and neodymium.<br>
In another embodiment, a method of making a stabilized alumina support further<br>
comprises applying at least one promoter to the stabilized alumina support. In some embodiments,<br>
the promoter comprises an element selected from the group consisting of La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm,<br>
Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tm, Yb and Lu, preferably Sm, ,Eu, Pr and Yb. It is believed that the<br>
introduction of a lanthanide oxide, especially SirbO.i, on the stabilized alumina support surface<br>
before deposition of active metal seems to further enhance the metal-support interaction, and that<br>
the active metal also disperses better on the surface of stabilized support comprising an aluminum<br>
oxide and a rare earth aluminate.<br>
Methods of preparation of high surface area catalyst support comprising theta-alumina<br>
Jn particular, the present invention discloses, in one aspect, a method of making a catalyst<br>
support comprising calcining an aluminum-comprising precursor in a manner effective for<br>
converting at least a portion of the aluminum-comprising precursor to an alumina support<br>
comprising a majority of theta-alumina, and substantially free of gamma-alumina. The calcination<br>
is preferably performed after an application of a stabilizing agent to the aluminum-comprising<br>
precursor, wherein the stabilizing agent preferably comprises a rare earth metal.<br>
The calcination is done at a high temperature greater than 800 °C, preferably not greater<br>
than 1,300 "C. The calcination temperature could be selected based on the highest temperature the<br>
catalyst would likely experience in operation, i.e. the catalytic reactor.<br>
When the aluminum-comprising precursor comprises mainly gamma-alumina, the<br>
calcination temperature is preferably selected such that it is above the minimum temperature<br>
necessary to start the phase transformation from gamma-alumina to another transition alumina<br>
phase between the low-temperature metastable transition gamma-alumina and the high-temperature<br>
thermodynamically stable alpha-alumina, but below about the minimum temperature necessary to<br>
start the phase transformation from said transition alumina to alpha-alumina. The other transition<br>
alumina (i.e., which excludes gamma-alumina) is preferably theta-alumina, but could comprise low<br>
amounts of other transition alumina phases. The calcination temperature is preferably selected such<br>
that substantially all of the gamma-alumina phase is transformed into other alumina phases,<br>
particularly to theta-alumina or a combination of theta-alumina and alpha-alumina. For example, if<br>
a good portion of theta-alumina is desired in the support, the calcination following the application<br>
step of a rare earth compound to a gamma-alumina, should be performed at a temperature<br>
preferably between 800 °C and 1,100 °C, more preferably between 900 °C and 1,000 °C. Under<br>
these conditions of calcination temperatures, it is most likely that the formation of rare earth<br>
hexaaluminates would be minimized. The heat treatment is preferably performed, for a time period<br>
between 3 to 24 hours.<br>
The calcination can be performed under an oxidizing atmosphere, either statically or<br>
under a flow of gas, preferably in static air or under a flow of a gas comprising diatomic oxygen.<br>
Steam, either by itself or in combination with air, can also be used.<br>
The calcination can be done at a pressure between 0 and 500 psia; preferably under<br>
atmospheric pressure (about 101 psia), or under a subatmospheric pressure such as in a vacuum, or<br>
at slightly above atmospheric pressure (J 01-200 psia).<br>
Preparation of thermally stable catalyst support comprising a rare earth aluminate with an AI:Ln&gt;5:<br>
An alternate preferred method comprises applying a compound of a stabilizing agent to an<br>
alumina support precursor; drying the modified alumina precursor; and treating the dried modified<br>
alumina precursor with heat in a manner effective for converting at least a portion of the aluminumcomprising<br>
material and a portion of said stabilizing agent to an aluminum-containing precursor to<br>
an aluminate of said stabilizing agent. The stabilizing agent comprises preferably a rare earth metal.<br>
When the stabilizing agent comprises preferably a rare earth metal, the heat treatment<br>
conditions such as temperature and time are preferably selected such that at least a portion of the<br>
aluminum-comprising material is transformed to the aluminate of said rare earth metal. This rare<br>
earth aluminate could comprise a hexaaluminate structure, a beta-alumina structure, a monoclinic<br>
structure, a perovskite-type structure, or combinations thereof, but preferably, the rare earth<br>
aluminate comprises a beta-alumina structure, an hexaaluminate structure, or any combinations<br>
thereof.<br>
In a specific example, when the aluminum-comprising precursor comprises mainly a<br>
gamma-alumina material, if the formation of rare earth aluminate with a high Al:Ln ratio (i.e.,<br>
greater than 5:1) is desired in the support, the heat treatment step following the application step of a<br>
rare earth compound to said gamma-alumina material and the drying step, should be performed at a<br>
temperature preferably between 1,000 °C and 1,600 °C, more preferably between 1,100 °C and<br>
1,400 °C. The heat treatment is preferably performed, for a time period between 3 to 24 hours.<br>
The heat treatment can be performed under an oxidizing atmosphere (and in this case is<br>
called calcination), either statically or under a flow of gas, preferably in static air or under a flow of<br>
a gas comprising diatomic oxygen. Steam, either by itself or in combination with air, can also be<br>
used, as Nair et al. (Journal of American Ceramic Society, 2000, vol. 83, pp. 1942-1946) indicated<br>
that no difference in surface area was observed when the lanthanum hexaaluminate,<br>
(LaiO.-O.l 1(A1:O;0, was calcined in air or steam.<br>
The holding time at high calcination temperatures is expected to be greater than a<br>
calcination time necessary for a typical phase transformation from gamma-alumina to theta-alumina<br>
to alpha-alumina, as the growth of rare earth hexaaluminates or beta-alumina structures is quite<br>
slow. Therefore one person skilled in the art should select a time period for heat treatment long<br>
enough to transform most of the rare earth compound to a rare earth hexaaluminate.<br>
Calcining conditions can be also selected such that calcination is effective to convert a<br>
portion of the rare earth metal solution into a second rare earth aluminate but which comprises a<br>
low aluminum to rare earth metal molar ratio, such as a perovskite structure. It is possible that if the<br>
rare earth metal is not completely transformed to hexaaluminate, it could be converted in the<br>
formation of rare earth oxides and/or other rare earth aluminates, such as a pervoskite type, which<br>
do not generate a higher surface area than the hexaaluminate structures are known to do. However it<br>
should be appreciated that in some cases, the combination of rare earth aluminates with high<br>
aluminum to rare earth molar ratio (i.e., between 11:1 and 14:1 for hexaaluminate-like structure or<br>
beta-alumina structures) and rare earth aluminates with low aluminum to rare earth molar ratios<br>
(i.e., 5:3 for garnet structure, 1:1 for perovskite structure, and 1:2 for monoclinic structure) might<br>
be desirable as the former species are known to increase the surface area and the later species are<br>
known to inhibit the surface diffusion of species responsible for sintering.<br>
Calcining can be also effective to convert a portion of the rare earth metal solution into an<br>
oxide of said rare earth metal, said rare earth oxide consisting essentially of rare earth metal atoms<br>
and oxygen atoms.<br>
The amount of a compound of a stabilizing agent applied to an aluminum-containing<br>
precursor is sufficient so as to obtain a stabilizing agent content in the support between about 1 wt%<br>
and about 20 wt%. When the stabilizing agent comprises a rare earth metal, the amount of a<br>
compound of a rare earth compound applied to the aluminum-containing precursor is sufficient so<br>
as to obtain a rare earth content in the support between about 1 wt% and about 20 wt%, preferably<br>
between about 1 wt% and about 10 wt%, more preferably between about 3 wt% and about 8 wt%,<br>
and still more preferably between about 4 wt% and about 8 wt%.<br>
More specifically, a method for making a thermally stable aluminum-based support with a<br>
high surface area comprises impregnating a solution of a rare earth metal onto an aluminumcontaining<br>
precursor; drying impregnated aluminum-containing precursor; and calcining in a<br>
manner effective to convert one portion of said aluminum-containing precursor to an aluminum<br>
oxide phase comprising alpha-alumina, theta-alumina, or combinations thereof; and to convert<br>
another portion of said aluminum-containing precursor with at least a fraction of said rare earth<br>
metal to a rare earth aluminate with a molar ratio of aluminum to rare earth metal greater than 5:1.<br>
After calcining, the material comprises between about 1 wt% and 100 wt% of said rare earth<br>
aluminate, preferably between about 1 wt% and about 50 wt% of said rare earth aluminate, more<br>
preferably between about 5 wt% and about 45 wt% of the rare earth aluminate, and still more<br>
preferably between about 10 wt% and about 40 wt% of the rare earth aluminate. The solution of<br>
rare earth metal comprises more than one rare earth metal. Drying is preferably performed at a<br>
temperature above 75 °C, preferably between 75 °C and 150 °C.<br>
The calcination temperature is preferably selected such that at least a portion of the<br>
aluminum-containing precursor is converted to another alumina phase, so as to obtain at least a<br>
theta-alumina phase and/or alpha-alumina phase, whereas another portion of the aluminumcontaining<br>
precursor is transformed with a stabilizing agent to an aluminate of said stabilizing<br>
agent.<br>
When the stabilizing agent comprises a rare earth metal, preferably the calcination<br>
temperature is chosen to favor the formation of a solid solution of aluminum comprising rare earth<br>
aluminates. For this particular embodiment, the temperature is greater than about 1,100°C. The<br>
calcination temperature is preferably between 1,100 °C and 1,400 °C; more preferably between<br>
about 1,200 °C and about 1,300 °C. The calcination time will depend greatly on the type of<br>
equipment used, whether commercial or lab-scale. It is preferred in the laboratory scale for 10-g to<br>
50-g samples to use a calcination time of at least about 3 hours to achieve at least a content of 5<br>
wt% by weight of rare earth hexaaluminates.<br>
Calcining can be also effective to convert a portion of the rare earth metal solution into an<br>
oxide of said rare earth metal, said rare earth oxide consisting essentially of rare earth metal atoms<br>
and oxygen atoms.<br>
Calcining can be also effective to convert a portion of the rare earth metal solution into a<br>
second rare earth aluminate but which comprises a low aluminum to rare earth metal molar ratio,<br>
such as a perovskite structure.<br>
METHOD OF CATALYST PREPARATION<br>
The present invention further presents a method of making a partial oxidation catalyst<br>
wherein said method comprises optionally applying a compound of one or more promoters to a<br>
stabilized support of this invention and calcining the applied stabilized support at temperatures<br>
greater than 600 °C, preferably between about 800 "C and about 1,400 °C, more preferably between<br>
about 900 °C and about 1,300 °C to form a catalyst precursor; depositing a compound of at least one<br>
active metals to the catalyst precursor; calcining the deposited catalyst precursor at temperatures<br>
between about 300 °C and about 1,200 °C, preferably between about 500 °C and about 1,100 °C.<br>
The stabilized support can be any of the supports disclosed earlier. A preferred support at least<br>
comprises a rare earth hexaaluminate with a Al:Ln ratio greater than 5:1. The stabilized support<br>
may further include an aluminum oxide phase such as comprising theta-alumina, alpha-alumina, or<br>
combinations thereof. The stabilized support preferably include between about 1 wt% and 50 wt%<br>
of said rare earth aluminate with a Al:Ln ratio greater than 5:1.<br>
The compound of the promoter can be in the form of salt, acid, oxide, hydroxide,<br>
oxyhydroxide, carbide, and the like. Preferably the compound of the promoter is a salt. The<br>
promoter comprises at least one element selected from the group consisting of La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm,<br>
Sm, Eu, Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er, Tin, Yb, Lu, and their corresponding oxides or ions. Preferably the<br>
promoter comprises either Pr, Yb, Eu, Sm, their corresponding oxides or ions, or any combinations<br>
thereof. Preferably the compound of the promoter comprises a nitrate salt, as for example only<br>
Sm(NO;0.i or La(NO;0. It should be understood that more than one promoter or more than one<br>
compound or precursor of a promoter can be used.<br>
The promoter can be deposited into the modified alumina by means of different<br>
techniques. For example only, deposition methods can be impregnation, co-precipitation, chemical<br>
vapor deposition, and the like. The preferred technique for depositing the promoter is impregnation.<br>
When the deposition of the promoter is done via impregnation, optionally a drying step at<br>
temperatures between 75 °C and 150 "C is performed on the deposited modified alumina prior to<br>
calcination.<br>
The compound of the active metal can be in the form of salt, acid, oxide, hydroxide,<br>
oxyhydroxide, carbide, and the like. Preferably the compound of the active metal is a salt. The<br>
active metal comprises one element selected from the group consisting of metals from Groups 8, 9,<br>
and 10 of the Periodic Table, rhenium, tungsten, and any combinations thereof. Preferably the<br>
active metal for syngas catalyst comprises rhodium, indium, ruthenium, rhenium, or any<br>
combinations thereof. Preferably the compound of the active metal is a nitrate or a chloride salt, as<br>
for example only Rh(NO.-03 or RhCl&gt; It should be understood that more than one active metal or<br>
more than one compound of an active metal can be used. When two active metals are used in the<br>
syngas catalyst, it is preferred that at least rhodium is selected as one metal, that the other metal is<br>
selected from the active metal list above for syngas catalyst, and that the loading of both metals is<br>
such so as to form a rhodium alloy.<br>
The active metal can be deposited on the catalyst precursor (on promoted or unpromoted<br>
stabilized alumina support) by means of different techniques. For example only, deposition methods<br>
can be impregnation, co-precipitation, chemical vapor deposition, and the like. The preferred<br>
technique for depositing the active metal is impregnation.<br>
When the deposition of the active metal is done via impregnation, optionally a drying step<br>
at temperatures between 75 °C and 150 °C is performed on the deposited catalyst precursor prior to<br>
calcination.<br>
Even though the applications of both promoter and active metal to the stabilized supports<br>
are descfibed as separate steps, the application of both promoter(s) and active metal can be done<br>
simultaneously.<br>
Finally, after the application, drying, calcination steps to incoiporate at least one active<br>
metal and an optional promoter into the support to make a catalyst, an activation step may be<br>
necessary. In some embodiments, the activation step is not required; therefore the activation step<br>
can be viewed as an optional step. The activation could comprise contacting the catalyst to a<br>
reducing atmosphere so as to convert at least a portion of the active metal to a zero-valent state. The<br>
reducing atmosphere preferably comprises hydrogen, but could also contain other gases (such as<br>
nitrogen, methane, carbon monoxide), which are preferably not poisons to the catalyst and/or do not<br>
chemically react with it.<br>
METHOD OF PRODUCTING SYNTHESIS GAS<br>
According to the present invention, a syngas reactor can comprise any of the synthesis gas<br>
technology and/or methods known in the art. The hydrocarbon-containing feed is almost<br>
exclusively obtained as natural gas. However, the most important component is generally methane.<br>
Natural gas comprise at least 50% methane and as much as 10% or more ethane. Methane or other<br>
suitable hydrocarbon feedstocks (hydrocarbons with four carbons or less) are also readily available<br>
from a variety of other sources such as higher chain hydrocarbon liquids, coal, coke, hydrocarbon<br>
gases, etc., all of which are clearly known in the art. Preferably, the feed comprises at least about<br>
50% by volume methane, more preferably at least 80% by volume, and most preferably at least<br>
90% by volume methane. The feed can also comprise as much as 10% ethane. Similarly, the<br>
oxygen-containing gas may come from a variety of sources and will be somewhat dependent upon<br>
the nature of the reaction being used. For example, a partial oxidation reaction requires diatomic<br>
oxygen as a feedstock, while steam reforming requires only steam. According to the preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, partial oxidation is assumed for at least part of the syngas<br>
production reaction.<br>
Regardless of the source, the hydrocarbon-containing feed and the oxygen-containing feed<br>
are reacted under catalytic conditions. Improved catalyst compositions in accordance with the<br>
present invention are described herein. They generally are comprised of a catalytic metal, some<br>
alloyed, that has been reduced to its active form and with one or more optional promoters on a<br>
stabilized aluminum-based support.<br>
It has been discovered that the stabilization of an aluminum-based support by the presence<br>
of at least one rare earth aluminate with a molar ratio of aluminum-to-rare earth metal greater than<br>
5:1 results in obtaining a catalytic support suitable for high-temperature reactions such as syngas<br>
production via partial oxidation.<br>
Thus this invention relates to a method for making synthesis gas comprising converting a<br>
gaseous hydrocarbon stream and an oxygen-containing stream over a partial oxidation catalyst, to<br>
make a product stream comprising CO and H2, wherein said partial oxidation catalyst includes an<br>
active ingredient comprising rhodium, iridium, platinum, palladium, ruthenium, or combinations<br>
thereof; and a support comprising a rare earth aluminate, said rare earth aluminate having a molar<br>
ratio of aluminum to rare earth metal greater than 5:1. The rare earth aluminate preferably has a<br>
molar ratio of aluminum to rare earth metal between 11:1 and 14:1. The rare earth aluminate<br>
preferably has a hexaaluminate-like structure, a beta-alumina like structure, or combinations<br>
thereof. The catalytic support can contain from about 1 wt% to 100 wt% of the rare earth aluminate.<br>
In some preferred embodiments, the catalytic support contains from about 1 wt% to about 50 wt%<br>
of the rare earth aluminate. In other embodiments, the thermally stable aluminum-based catalyst<br>
support could comprise between 40 wt% and 100 wt% of the rare earth aluminate. In some alternate<br>
embodiments, the support is a rare earth aluminate or a mixture of rare earth aluminates with an<br>
aluminum-to-rare earth metal molar ratio greater than 5:1, such as a lanthanum hexaaluminate-like<br>
material or a lanthanum beta-alumina-like material.<br>
In addition, it has been discovered that the stabilization of an aluminum-based support by<br>
the addition of at least one stabilizing agent to a transition alumina between gamma-alumina and<br>
alpha-alumina (but excluding gamma-alumina) results in a high-surface area catalytic support<br>
suitable for high-temperature reactions.<br>
This invention also relates to a method for making synthesis gas comprising converting a<br>
gaseous hydrocarbon stream and an oxygen-containing stream over a partial oxidation catalyst, to<br>
make a product stream comprising CO and H2, wherein said partial oxidation catalyst includes an<br>
active ingredient comprising rhodium, iridium, platinum, palladium, ruthenium, or combinations<br>
thereof; and a support comprising a transition alumina excluding gamma-alumina, and at least one<br>
stabilizing agent. The transition alumina in the support preferably comprises theta-alumina. The<br>
support may also comprise alpha-alumina. The stabilizing agent is preferably a rare earth metal.<br>
The stabilizing agent more preferably includes a lanthanide metal selected from the group<br>
consisting of lanthanum, cerium, neodymium, praseodymium, samarium, and combinations thereof,<br>
but may further include any element from Groups 1-14 of the Periodic Table (new IUPAC notation)<br>
such as an alkali metal, an alkali earth metal, an additional rare earth metal, or a transition metal.<br>
The syngas catalyst compositions according to the present invention comprise an active<br>
metal selected from the group consisting of metals from Group 8, 9, and 10 of the Periodic Table,<br>
rhenium, tungsten, and any combinations thereof, preferably a metal from Group 8, 9, and 10 of the<br>
Periodic Table and any combinations thereof, more preferably rhodium, iridium, ruthenium, or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
In some embodiments when the active metal is rhodium, rhodium is comprised in a high<br>
melting point alloy with another metal. It has been discovered that in addition to the enhanced<br>
thermal stability of the support, the high melting point rhodium alloys used in some of these syngas<br>
catalysts confer additional thermally stability than non-alloy rhodium catalysts, which leads to<br>
enhanced ability of the catalyst to resist various deactivation phenomena.<br>
It is well known that during syngas reactions, several undesired processes, such as coking<br>
(carbon deposition), metal migration, and sintering of metal and/or the support, can occur and<br>
severely deteriorate catalytic performance. The catalyst compositions of the present invention are<br>
better able to resist at least one of these phenomena over longer periods of time than prior art<br>
catalysts. As a consequence, these novel rhodium-containing catalysts on stabilized alumina<br>
comprising mainly theta alumina can maintain high methane conversion as well as high CO and t^<br>
selectivity over extended periods of time with little to no deactivation of the syngas catalyst.<br>
The support structure of these catalysts can be in the form of a monolith or can be in the<br>
form of divided or discrete structures or particulates. Particulates are preferred. Small support<br>
particles tend to be more useful in fluidized beds. Preferably at least a majority (i.e., &gt;50%) of the<br>
particles or distinct structures have a maximum characteristic length (i.e., longest dimension) of less<br>
than six millimeters, preferably less than three millimeters. According to some embodiments, the<br>
divided catalyst structures have a diameter or longest characteristic dimension of about 0.25 mm to<br>
about 6.4 mm (about 1/100" to about 1/4"), preferably between about 0.5 mm and about 4.0 mm. In<br>
other embodiments they are in the range of about 50 microns to 6 mm.<br>
The hydrocarbon feedstock and the oxygen-containing gas may be passed over the<br>
catalyst at any of a variety of space velocities. Space velocities for the process, stated as gas hourly<br>
space velocity (GHSV), are in the range of about 20,000 hr"1 to about 100,000,000 hr"1, more<br>
preferably of about 100,000 hr"1 to about 10,000,000 hr"1, most preferably of about 400,000 hr"1 to<br>
about 1,000,000 hr"1. Although for ease in comparison with prior art systems space velocities at<br>
standard conditions have been used to describe the present invention, it is well recognized in the art<br>
that residence time is the inverse of space velocity and that the disclosure of high space velocities<br>
corresponds to low residence times on the catalyst. "Space velocity," as that term is customarily<br>
used in chemical process descriptions, is typically expressed as volumetric gas hourly space<br>
velocity in units of hr"1. Under these operating conditions a flow rate of reactant gases is maintained<br>
sufficient to ensure a residence or dwell time of each portion of reactant gas mixture in contact with<br>
the catalyst of no more than 200 milliseconds, preferably less than 50 milliseconds, and still more<br>
preferably less than 20 milliseconds. A contact time less than 10 milliseconds is highly preferred.<br>
The duration or degree of contact is preferably regulated so as to produce a favorable balance<br>
between competing reactions and to produce sufficient heat to maintain the catalyst at the desired<br>
temperature.<br>
In order to obtain the desired high space velocities, the process is operated at atmospheric<br>
or superatmospheric pressures. The pressures may be in the range of about 100 kPa to about 4,000<br>
kPa (about 1-40 atm), preferably from about 200 kPa to about 3,200 kPa (about 2-32 atm).<br>
The process is preferably operated at a temperature in the range of about 350 °C to about<br>
2,000 °C. More preferably, the temperature is maintained in the range 400 °C - 1,600 °C, as<br>
measured at the reactor outlet.<br>
The catalysts of the present invention should maintain hydrocarbon conversion of equal to<br>
or greater than about 85%, preferably equal to or greater than about 90% after 100 hours of<br>
operation when operating at pressures of greater than 2 atmospheres. Likewise, the catalysts of the<br>
present invention should maintain CO and t^ selectivity of equal to or greater than about 85%,<br>
preferably equal to or greater than about 90% after 100 hours of operation when operating at<br>
pressures of greater than 2 atmospheres.<br>
The synthesis gas product contains primarily hydrogen and carbon monoxide, however,<br>
many other minor components may be present including steam, nitrogen, carbon dioxide, ammonia,<br>
hydrogen cyanide, etc., as well as unreacted feedstock, such as methane and/or oxygen. The<br>
synthesis gas product, i.e. syngas, is then ready to be used, treated, or directed to its intended<br>
purpose. The product gas mixture emerging from the syngas reactor may be routed directly into<br>
any of a variety of applications, preferably at pressure. For example, in the instant case some or all<br>
of the syngas can be used as a feedstock in subsequent synthesis processes, such as Fischer-Tropsch<br>
synthesis, alcohol (particularly methanol) synthesis, hydrogen production, hydroformylation, or any<br>
other use for syngas. One preferred such application for the CO and H: product stream is for<br>
producing via the Fischer-Tropsch reaction synthesis higher molecular weight hydrocarbons, such<br>
as Cj+hydrocarbons.<br>
Syngas is typically at a temperature of about 600 °C-l,500 °C when leaving a syngas<br>
reactor. The syngas must be transitioned to be useable in a Fischer-Tropsch or other synthesis<br>
reactors, which operate at lower temperatures of about 160 °C to 400 °C. The syngas is typically<br>
cooled, dehydrated (i.e., taken below 100 °C to knock out water) and compressed during the<br>
transition phase. Thus, in the transition of syngas from the syngas reactor to for example a Fischer-<br>
Tropsch reactor, the syngas stream may experience a temperature window of 50 °C to 1,500 °C.<br>
In addition, the present invention contemplates an improved method for converting<br>
hydrocarbon gas to liquid hydrocarbons using the novel catalyst compositions described herein for<br>
synthesis gas production from light hydrocarbons. Thus, the invention also relates to processes for<br>
converting hydrocarbon-containing gas to liquid products via an integrated syngas to Fischer-<br>
Tropsch, methanol or other process.<br>
HYDROCARBON SYNTHESIS FROM SYNTHESIS GAS<br>
The synthesis gas (a mixture of hydrogen and carbon monoxide) produced by the use of<br>
catalysts as described above is assumed to comprise at least a portion of the feed to a Fischer-<br>
Tropsch reactor. The Fischer-Tropsch reactor can comprise any of the Fischer-Tropsch technology<br>
and/or methods known in the art. The feed to the Fischer-Tropsch comprises a synthesis gas (or<br>
syngas) with a hydrogen to carbon monoxide molar ratio between 0.67:1 and 5:1 but is generally<br>
deliberately adjusted to a desired ratio of between about 1:4:1 to 2.3:1, preferably approximately<br>
1.7:1 to 2.2:1. The syngas is then contacted with a Fischer-Tropsch catalyst. Fischer-Tropsch<br>
catalysts are well known in the art and generally comprise a catalytically active metal and a<br>
promoter. The most common catalytic metals are metals from Groups 8, 9, 10 of the Periodic Table,<br>
such as cobalt, nickel, ruthenium, and iron or mixtures thereof. They may also comprise a support<br>
structure. The support is generally alumina, titania, zirconia, silica, or mixtures thereof. In some<br>
embodiments, it is envisioned that the Fischer-Tropsch catalyst may be supported on a stabilized<br>
alumina as described in this invention. Fischer-Tropsch reactors use fixed and fluid type<br>
conventional catalyst beds as well as slurry bubble columns. The literature is replete with particular<br>
embodiments of Fischer-Tropsch reactors and Fischer-Tropsch catalyst compositions. As the<br>
syngas feedstock contacts the catalyst, the hydrocarbon synthesis reaction takes place. The Fischer-<br>
Tropsch product contains a wide distribution of hydrocarbon products from C.
The Fischer-Tropsch process is typically run in a continuous mode. In this mode, the gas hourly<br>
space velocity through the reaction zone typically may range from about 50 hr"1 to about 10,000 hr"<br>
', preferably from about 300 hr"1 to about 2,000 hr"1. The gas hourly space velocity is defined as the<br>
volume of reactants per time per reaction zone volume (the volume of reactant gases is at standard<br>
pressure of 1 atm or 101 kPa and standard temperature of 0 °C; the reaction zone volume is defined<br>
by the portion of the reaction vessel volume where reaction takes place and which is occupied by a<br>
gaseous phase comprising reactants, products and/or inerts; a liquid phase comprising liquid/wax<br>
products and/or other liquids; and a solid phase comprising catalyst). The reaction zone temperature<br>
is typically in the range from about 160 °C to about 300 °C. Preferably, the reaction zone is<br>
operated at conversion promoting conditions at temperatures from about 190 °C to about 260 °C,<br>
more preferably between about 200 °C and about 230 °C. The reaction zone pressure is typically in<br>
the range of about 80 psia (552 kPa) to about 1,000 psia (6895 kPa), more preferably from 80 psia<br>
(552 kPa) to about 800 psia (5515 kPa), and still more preferably, from about 140 psia (965 kPa) to<br>
about 750 psia (5170 kPa). Most preferably, the reaction zone pressure is from about 140 psia (965<br>
kPa) to about 500 psia (3447 kPa).<br>
DEFINITIONS<br>
For purposes of the present disclosure, certain terms are intended to have the following<br>
meanings.<br>
"Active metal" refers to any metal that is present on a catalyst that is active for catalyzing<br>
a particular reaction. Active metals may also be referred to as catalytic metals.<br>
A "promoter" is one or more substances, such as a metal or a metal oxide or metal ion that<br>
enhances an active metal's catalytic activity in a particular process, such as a CPOX process (e.g.,<br>
increase conversion of the reactant and/or selectivity for the desired product). In some instances a<br>
particular promoter may additionally provide another function, such as aiding in dispersion of<br>
active metal or aiding in stabilizing a support structure or aiding in reduction of the active metal.<br>
A "stabilizing agent" is one or more substances, comprising an element from the Periodic<br>
Table of Elements, or an oxide or ion of such element, that modifies at least one physical property<br>
of the support material that it is deposited onto, such as for example structure of crystal lattice,<br>
mechanical strength, and/or morphology.<br>
A rare earth "aluminate" refers to a compounds or related materials in the system Ln-Al-<br>
O, where Ln, Al and O represent the rare earth metal, aluminum, oxygen, respectively.<br>
With respect to the catalytic reaction such as partial oxidation of light hydrocarbons such<br>
as methane or natural gas to produce synthesis gas or conversion of synthesis gas to hydrocarbons,<br>
references to "catalyst stability" refer to maintenance of at least one of the following criteria: level<br>
of conversion of the reactants, productivity, selectivity for the desired products, physical and<br>
chemical stability of the catalyst, lifetime of the catalyst on stream, and resistance of the catalyst to<br>
deactivation.<br>
A compound of an element is a chemical entity that contains the atoms of said element<br>
(whether the element is a catalytically active metal, a promoter, or a stabilizing agent).<br>
A transition alumina is typically defined as any crystalline aluminun oxide phase which is<br>
obtained by dehydration from an aluminum hydrate precursor such as boehmite or pseudoboehmite,<br>
gibbsite, or bayerite, to ultimately the thermodynamically stable phase of alumina, alphaalumina.<br>
Transition aluminas comprise gamma-alumina, theta-alumina, delta-alumina, eta-alumina,<br>
rho-alumina, chi-alumina, and kappa-alumina.<br>
Gamma-alumina and theta-alumina are two metastable phases of aluminum oxide<br>
observed along the dehydration sequence of boehmite upon thermal treatment before conversion to<br>
the final product alpha-alumina (see for example, Transformation of gamma-alumina to thetaalumina'<br>
by Cai, Physical Review Letters, 2002, vol. 89, pp. 235501).<br>
Theta-alumina is a metastable phase of alumina with aluminum atoms both octahedrally<br>
and tetrahedrally coordinated. The local cation coordinations in theta-alumina are close to those in<br>
gamma-alumina but different from alpha-alumina. Theta-alumina has an indirect energy band gap,<br>
which is 1.6 eV smaller than that of alumina. The linear optical properties of theta-alumina are very<br>
close to those of alpha-alumina. [Mo and Ching (1998), Session W19, 1998 March Meeting of The<br>
American Physical Society, March 16-20, 1998, Los Angeles, CAJ.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The invention having been generally described, the following examples are given as<br>
particular embodiments of the invention and to demonstrate the practice and advantages hereof. It<br>
is understood that the examples are given by way of illustration and are not intended to limit the<br>
specification or the claims to follow in any manner.<br>
An aluminum-containing precursor was obtained as gamma-ANO} spheres from Davison,<br>
with the following characteristics: a size in the range of 1.2 to 1.4 mm (average diameter of 1.3<br>
mm.), a bulk density of 0.44 g/ml, a surface area and pore volume measure with N2 adsorption of<br>
143 m2/g and 0.75 ml/g respectively. For a control, supports using Y-A^O^ spheres were formed<br>
using no modifier by calcination at different calcination temperatures between 600 and 1,300 °C for<br>
3 hours. For generating lanthanum-modified supports, A^Os spheres were impregnated with a<br>
lanthanum nitrate (La(NO.i)i) solution, dried in an oven at 120 °C overnight, and then calcined at<br>
different calcination temperatures between 600 and 1,300 °C for 3 hours. The y-AbOs spheres were<br>
impregnated with an aqueous solution containing desired amount of La(NO.-?)3 so that the lanthanum<br>
oxide (La2O.i) amount in the final material after drying and calcinations is approximately 3 wt% or<br>
10 wt% lanthanum oxide by weight of the total support (this corresponds to a weight content of<br>
about 2.56 wt% and 8.53 wt% La and a molar content of 0.94 mol% and 3.1 mol% of La2O3,<br>
respectively).<br>
Figures 2a, 2b and 2c represent the X-Ray Diffraction patterns of several support<br>
materials comprising respectively no lanthanum, 3 wt% La2O3 and 10 wt% La^O^, all obtained after<br>
an impregnation and a 3-hour calcination at different temperatures. When one compares the XRD<br>
traces of undoped alumina (Figure 2a) and the 3 wt% LaiO.i on alumina in (Figure 2b) that were<br>
calcined at 1,100 °C or 1,200 °C, it is noted that a-ANOj phase was present in higher percentage in<br>
undoped alumina (Al^Oi) than in 3 wt% La on alumina (3 wt% La^Oj/AliOj). The a-AhO.i phase<br>
was detected already in the undoped A^O^ calcined at 1,100 °C while a-Al^O.^ peaks in the 1,100<br>
°C calcined 3 wt% La2O.VA2O3 were negligible. The difference in AliO.i phase compositions of<br>
those two samples is more obvious for the 1,200 °C calcinated samples — a phase is the<br>
predominant phase in undoped A]2Oj while O-Al^O^ is the main phase in 3 wt% La2O?,/A2Qj<br>
sample, suggesting a lanthanum dopant with 3 wt% La^Oi loading is effective in preventing 9 phase<br>
from transforming into a phase at 1,200 °C. Nevertheless, the thermodynamically stable a phase<br>
becomes the dominant phase in both undoped and 3 wt% L^Oj/AiO? after calcination at 1,300 °C.<br>
In order to further retard the a-AbO} phase formation and to maintain a relatively high surface area<br>
after 1,300 °C calcination, the La2O3 doping level needs to be increased. The XRD results obtained<br>
with 10% La2O3/Al2O3 samples calcined at different temperatures indicate that La-Al-O mixed<br>
oxide compounds were formed upon calcination at high temperatures (Figure 2c). The presence of<br>
perovskite -structured LaAlO} compound was detected in the 1,100 °C calcined sample. A<br>
hexaluminate-type La-Al-O compound, LaAlnOig emerged after 1,200 °C calcination at the<br>
expense of LaAlO^, which completely disappeared in the 1,300 °C calcined 10% La^CVAbOs.<br>
Based on the XRD results in Figure 2c, we conclude that the sequences of La^O? + ANO^ reaction<br>
at high temperatures follow:<br>
~1100°C ~1200°C<br>
La2O3 + Al2O3 &gt; LaAlO3 &gt; LaAl,,O,8<br>
For the 1,200 °C-calcined 10% La2O3/Al2O3 sample, the intensities of XRD diffraction<br>
peaks from a-ANOj are much lower than those in the 1,200 °C-calcined 3% I^CVAbOj sample,<br>
suggesting the retardation of a-A^O.i formation is more effective at higher La^O.-? doping levels.<br>
Moreover, when comparing the XRD traces of 1,300 °C-calcined sample in Figure 2b and Figure<br>
2c, one may notice that the a-A!2O3 phase in the 10% La2O3/Al2O3 sample is not as predominant as<br>
in 3% La2O3/Al2O3 (Figure 2c). It seems that there is an absence of dominant a-AloO} phase and<br>
the present of more thermal stable LaAlnO|8 in the 1,300 °C calcined samples (Figure 2c) in the<br>
10% La2O3/Al2O3 support than those of unmodified AliOj and 3% La2O3/Al2O3.<br>
In order to find the optimum La^Oj doping level to stabilize the AhO^ structure, La2O3<br>
doping level was varied from 3 wt% to 10 wt%. The BET surface area and pore volume of<br>
La^CVAbO.i of different La2Os doping levels were shown in Figures 3a and 3b respectively.<br>
Doping A12O3 with 3 wt% La2O.-? dopant retards A12O.3 phase transition to a phase upon thermal<br>
treatment with limited success in retaining the surface area and pore volume after calcination at<br>
1,200 °C or higher. Thermal sintering, formation of a phase and the consequent dramatic decrease<br>
in surface area and pore structure, are inevitable under extremely severe condition (e.g., at 1,300 °C,<br>
Figure 2a and Figure 2b). Increasing the La2O3 dopant level above 3 wt% further helps to stabilize<br>
A12O3 structure. The results in Figures 3a and 3b indicate that the optimum La loadings to achieve<br>
the highest surface area and pore volume of La2O.3 modified A12O3 are dependent of calcination<br>
temperature. For 1,200 °C calcined samples, the largest surface area and pore volume was found to<br>
be that of 5 wt% La2O3/Al2O3 (Figure 3a). Optimum surface area/pore volume was achieved with 8<br>
wt% La2O3 loading with 1,300 °C calcined La2O3/Al2O3 samples (Figure 3b). With a La2O3 doping<br>
level higher than those optimum values, the surface area and pore volume decrease.<br>
Thus, support formulation comprising 6-8 wt% I^C^ (corresponding respectively to ca.<br>
5.1-6.8 wt% La and ca. 1.88-2.5 mol% La2O?) in the aluminum oxide matrix and calcined at 1,300<br>
°C seemed to provide higher surface area than the unmodified alumina structure or those modified<br>
with higher or lower La loadings.<br>
Catalyst Example<br>
The y-AhOj spheres described above were impregnated with an aqueous solution<br>
containing desired amount of lanthanum nitrate fLaCNOj)^] so that the lanthanum oxide [La2O3l<br>
amount in the final material after drying and calcinations is approximately 3% by weight. The<br>
ANOj spheres impregnated with the La(NO.-03 solution were dried in oven at 120 °C overnight and<br>
then calcined at 1,200 °C for 3 hours to form a La2O3-modified AKOj support material. The La^O^-<br>
AliOj spheres (Support Example S) were then subjected to samarium addition.<br>
The La^CVmodified AhO.-? support material obtained as EXAMPLE 1 was impregnated<br>
with a samarium nitrate [Sm(NO;0.i] solution. The material was dried in oven for overnight at 120<br>
°C and then calcined at 1,100 °C for 3 hours to form a samarium-promoted catalyst support<br>
(Promoted Support Example PS). The Sm content in the catalyst was 4 wt% SiTbOi in the final<br>
material after drying and calcinations.<br>
The promoted catalyst support calcined was then impregnated with a rhodium chloride<br>
[RhCl.i] solution and the catalyst precursor was dried in oven for overnight at 120 °C, calcined at<br>
900 °C for 3 hours, and then reduced in Hi at 600 °C for 3 hours to generate some metallic rhodium<br>
form before being charged into the reactor to as to form a catalyst (Catalyst Example C). The Rh<br>
metal content in the catalyst was 4% by weight again determined by mass balance.<br>
Table 1 lists the alumina phase content, the rare earth aluminate content, BET surface<br>
areas, pore volume, average pore diameter, average pore volume and average pore diameter both<br>
measured by the BJH desorption method using N2 as the adsorptive of the modified alumina<br>
catalyst support, the promoted modified support and the catalyst made therefrom.<br>
The characterization of the transition alumina support was done by Rietveld X-Ray<br>
Diffraction. Rietveld XRD uses a modeling tool which can extrapolate the percentage of different<br>
alumina phases based on crystalline raw data from XRD. The Rietveld neutron profile refinement<br>
method is disclosed by Rietveld (J. Appl. Cryst.. 1969, vol. 2, pp. 65-71) and the quantitative<br>
analysis of minerals using the full powder diffraction profile using the Rietveld modeling are<br>
described in Bish &amp; Howard (J. Appl. Cryst.. 1988, vol. 21, pp. 86-91). The Rietveld neutron<br>
profile of gamma-alumina and theta-alumina disclosed in Zhou et al. (Acta Cryst., 1991, vol. B47,<br>
pp. 617-630) were used as a reference for the determination of the alumina phase content in the<br>
samples.<br>
Surface area and pore size distribution are obtained on a Micromeritics TriStar 3000<br>
analyzer after degassing the sample at 190°C in flowing nitrogen for five hours. Surface area is<br>
determined from ten points in the nitrogen adsorption isotherm between 0.05 and 0.3 relative<br>
pressure and calculating the surface area by the standard BET procedure. Pore size distribution is<br>
determined from a minimum of 30 points in the nitrogen desorption isotherm and calculated using<br>
the BJH model for cylindrical pores. The instrument control and calculations are performed using<br>
the TriStar software and are consistent with ASTM D3663-99 "Surface Area of Catalysts and<br>
Catalyst Carriers", ASTM D4222-98 "Determination of Nitrogen Adsorption and Desorption<br>
Isotherms of Catalysts by Static Volumetric Measurements", and ASTM D4641-94 "Calculation of<br>
Pore Size Distributions of Catalysts from Nitrogen Desorption Isotherms". The initial surface area<br>
(A) of the catalyst is the surface area of the catalyst structure prior to contact of reactant gas. The<br>
pore volume (V) of the catalyst (N2 as adsorptive) is measured and calculated using the method<br>
described above. Average pore size (diameter) based on N2 adsorptive is calculated as 4V/A.<br>
For the alumina material modified with La (Example S), calcinations at 1,200 °C resulted<br>
in a mixture of gamma-ANO;, (24 wt%), theta-Al2O3 (66 wt %) and alpha-Al2O3 (10 wt %).<br>
Addition of samarium to Example S and calcination at 900 °C (Example PS) produced a mixture of<br>
theta-ANO.i (88wt %) and alpha-AljO.-? (12 wt %), as the gamma-alumina phase seemed to be no<br>
longer present. The addition of rhodium to Example PS and subsequent calcination at 600°C<br>
(Example C) consisted of theta- Al2Oi (87 wt %) and alpha-AI2(&gt;? (13 wt %). Therefore Examples<br>
PS and C had similar alumina phase composition.<br>
From Table 1, it is noted that calcination at 1,200 °C completely transformed gamm.a-<br>
A12O3 to theta-A!2Oi or alpha-ANO.v One also anticipates that a longer calcination time at a given<br>
temperature would also result in transforming more gamma-Al2O3 to theta-ANO.-).<br>

As the phase transformations of ANOi follow gamma —&gt; theta—* alpha with progressive<br>
heating, the calcination temperature also has a great impact on the porous structure and support<br>
characteristics. A significant difference in surface area (143 nr/g vs. 56 m2/g) and pore volume<br>
(0.75 ml/g vs. 0.44 ml/g) in unmodified untreated alumina material and Example S was observed,<br>
concurrently to the appearance of a good portion of theta-alumina phase and some alpha-alumina<br>
phase.<br>
It is worth mentioning that additional XRD data using Rietvel modeling (Rietveld, J.<br>
Appl. Cryst., 1969, vol. 2, pp. 65-71; Bish &amp; Howard, J. Appl. Cryst., 1988, vol. 21, pp. 86-91;<br>
Taylor, Powder Diffraction, 1991, vol. 6, pp. 2-9) indicated that there was no distinguished phase of<br>
LaiO.i found in any of the samples, instead, two forms of rare earth alumina solid solution were<br>
found matching the spectrum. One is a random form, alumina maintained gamma or theta structures<br>
with some of aluminum atoms in the lattices randomly replaced by rare earth metal atoms. All<br>
gamma-AloOj and theta-AliOj mentioned above actually existed as such a random solid solution<br>
form of alumina and LaiO^. Another one is an ordered form, a distinguished new crystallite phase<br>
formulated as LnAl^OiQ, which was found a significant amount in promoted support Example PS<br>
(20 wt % based on the sample weight) and catalyst Example C (18 wt % based on the sample<br>
weight), much more than support Example S (7 wt % based on the sample weight). This may<br>
suggest that addition of more rare earth element such as samarium might help form more solid<br>
solution of LnAlnOio.<br>
Catalyst composition, metal surface area, and metal dispersion are summarized in the<br>

The metal surface area of the catalyst is determined by measuring the dissociative<br>
chemical adsorption of Hi on the surface of the metal. A Micromeritics ASAP 2010 automatic<br>
analyzer system is used, employing H2 as a probe molecule. The ASAP 2010 system uses a<br>
flowing gas technique for sample preparation to ensure complete reduction of reducible oxides on<br>
the surface of the sample. A gas such as hydrogen flows through the heated sample bed, reducing<br>
the oxides on the sample (such as platinum oxide) to the active metal (pure platinum). Since only<br>
the active metal phase responds to the chemisorbate (hydrogen in the present case), it is possible to<br>
measure the active surface area and metal dispersion independently of the substrate or inactive<br>
components. The analyzer uses the static volumetric technique to attain precise dosing of the<br>
chemisorbate and rigorously equilibrates the sample. The first analysis measures both strong and<br>
weak sorption data in combination. A repeat analysis measures only the weak (reversible) uptake of<br>
the probe molecule by the sample supports and the active metal. As many as 1,000 data points can<br>
be collected with each point being fully equilibrated. Prior to the measurement of the metal surface<br>
area the sample is pre-treated. The first step is to pretreat the sample in He for 1 hr at 100 °C. The<br>
sample is then heated to 350 °C in He for 1 hr. These steps clean the surface prior to measurement.<br>
Next the sample is evacuated to sub-atmospheric pressure to remove all previously adsorbed or<br>
chemisorbed species. The sample is then oxidized in a 10% oxygen/helium gas at 350 °C for 30<br>
minutes to remove any possible organics that are on the surface. The sample is then reduced at 400<br>
°C for 3 hours in pure hydrogen gas. This reduces any reducible metal oxide to the active metal<br>
phase. The sample is then evacuated using a vacuum pump at 400 °C for 2 hours. The sample is<br>
then cooled to 35 °C prior to the measurement. The sample is then ready for measurement of the<br>
metal surface. From the measurement of the volume of H2 uptake during the measurement step, it is<br>
possible to determine the metal surface area per gram of catalyst structure by the following<br>
equation.<br>
MSA = (V)(A)(S)(a)/22400/m<br>
where MSA is the metal surface are in m2 /gram of catalyst structure;<br>
V is the volume of adsorbed gas at Standard Temperature and Pressure in ml.;<br>
A is the Avogadro constant;<br>
S is the stoichiometric factor (2 for H2 chemisorption on rhodium);<br>
m is the sample weight in grams; and<br>
a is the metal cross sectional area.<br>
A temperature-programmed reduction (TPR) was also performed for catalyst Example 3.<br>
TPR was used to analyze the metal oxide reducibility and metal-to-support interactions. A 0.05-g<br>
sample was pretreated with flowing Argon at temperature of 200 °C for 0.5 hour and cooled down<br>
to ambient, then heated up to 800 °C in flowing 20% of H2/Ar (50 cc/min) at the ramp rate of 10<br>
°C/min. The number of reduction peaks can be used to determine the number of environments<br>
where metals reside and the temperatures can be used as indicators for metal-to-support<br>
interactions, higher temperature stronger metal-to-support interaction. The TPR profile, its peak<br>
temperatures and total H2 consumption, of as-calcined Example C are shown in Figure 1. Example<br>
C had three reduction peaks at temperatures of 122 °C, 156 °C and 200 °C, respectively, with total<br>
H: consumption of 9.2 ml/g. The three peaks in the TPR of Example most likely indicated that the<br>
support calcined at 1,200 °C resulted in three different kinds of support environments for rhodium<br>
to exist, which probably mean that the metal-to-support interactions are non-uniform across the<br>
catalyst surface. The lower reduction peak temperature of Example 3 indicates a weaker Rh-O bond<br>
on the surface of the catalyst, thereby most likely increasing the amount of metallic rhodium on the<br>
surface of the reaction and favoring the direct oxidation mechanism (Scheme 2) as discussed earlier.<br>
FIXED BED REACTIVITY TESTING<br>
The catalyst Example C was tested with molecular oxygen and natural gas as the<br>
hydrocarbon feed. The natural gas had a typical composition of about 93.1% methane, 3.7 %<br>
ethane, 1.34% propane, 0.25 % butane, 0.007% pentane, 0.01% C,+, 0.31% carbon dioxide, 1.26%<br>
nitrogen (with % meaning volume percent). The hydrocarbon feed was pre-heated at 300 °C and<br>
then mixed with CK The reactants were fed into a fixed bed reactor at a carbon to O2 molar ratio of<br>
1.87 or a Oimatural gas mass ratio of 1.05 at gas weight hourly space velocities (GHSV) of about<br>
675,000 hr'. The gas hourly space velocity is defined by the volume of reactant feed per volume of<br>
catalyst per hour. The partial oxidation reaction was carried out in a conventional flow apparatus<br>
using a 12.7 mm I.D. quartz insert embedded inside a refractory-lined steel vessel. The quartz<br>
insert contained a catalyst bed (comprising of 2.0 g of catalyst particles) held between two inert 80-<br>
ppi alumina foams. The reaction took place for several days at a pressure of about 90 psig (722 kPa)<br>
and at temperatures at the exit of reactor between about 930 °C and about 1010 °C. All the flows<br>
were controlled by mass flow controllers. The reactor effluent as well as feedstock was analyzed<br>
using a gas chromatograph equipped with a thermal conductivity detector. Pressures at the inlet and<br>
outlet on the reactor were measured by a differential pressure transmitter, which gives the overall<br>
pressure drop across the catalytic bed by subtracting the pressure at the outlet from the pressure at<br>
the inlet.<br>
The data analyzed include catalyst performance as determined by conversion and<br>
selectivity, and deactivation rate measured for some over a period of over 300 hours. The catalyst<br>
performances (CH4 conversion, Hi and CO selectivity) at 2 hours after reaction ignition are listed in<br>
the following Table 3 and the observed deactivation rate are listed in Table 4.<br>

As shown in Table 3, Example C has very good overall catalytic performance, towards<br>
synthesis gas production. The oxygen conversion (not shown) was also measured for all tests, and<br>
was above 99%. As seen in Table 4, Example C appears to deactivate at a slow rate, showing<br>
remarkable stability in conversion and selectivity over time.<br>
Figure 4 shows the plots of the methane conversion and product (H? and CO) selectivity<br>
for the test run of catalyst Example C, demonstrating the great stability in partial oxidation of<br>
natural gas, with only 0.48_% loss per day in methane conversion and 0.48_% loss per day in<br>
hydrogen selectivity for the duration of the run (about 300 hours).<br>
The examples and testing data show that the catalyst compositions of the present<br>
invention represent an improvement over prior art partial oxidation catalysts in their ability to resist<br>
deactivation over sustained time periods while maintaining high methane conversion and hydrogen<br>
and carbon monoxide selectivity values. While the preferred embodiments of the invention have<br>
been shown and described, modifications thereof can be made by one skilled in the art without<br>
departing from the spirit and teachings of the invention. The embodiments described herein are<br>
exemplary only, and are not intended to be limiting. Many variations and modifications of the<br>
