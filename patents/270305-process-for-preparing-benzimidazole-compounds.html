				<td>PROCESS FOR PREPARING BENZIMIDAZOLE COMPOUNDS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	Related Application<br>
[0002]	The present application claims priority of U.S. Provisional Application Serial<br>
No. 60/693,270 filed June 23, 2005, which is incorporated herein in its entirety by this reference.<br>
[0003]	Field of the Invention<br>
[0004]	This   invention relates  to  processes  for  the  preparation  of heterocyclic<br>
compounds.  More specifically, this invention relates to the synthesis of compounds that can<br>
be used to prepare pharmaceutical agents such as benzimidazole derivatives.  This invention<br>
further includes intermediate compounds obtained during the synthesis of the heterocyclic<br>
compounds according to this invention and to the methods of preparation thereof.<br>
[0005]	Description of the state of the art<br>
[0006]	Benzimidazole derivatives have been investigated as therapeutics for treating<br>
cancers, viral infections, and diseases arid pathological conditions involving inflammation and have been disclosed in a number of. patents and publications in the last several years, including U.S. Patent Publication Nos. 2003/0232869, 2004/0116710, and 2003/0216460; U.S. Patent No. 5,525,625; WO 98/43960: WO 99/01421; WO 99/01426; WO 00/41505; WO 00/42002; WO 00/42003; WO 00/41994; WO 00/42022; WO 00/42029; WO 00/68201; WO 01/68619; WO 02/06213; WO 03/0779.14; and WO 03/077855.<br>
[0007]	In particular, WO 03/077914 describes the synthesis of the sodium salt of a<br>
benzimidazole derivative 11 from 2,3,4-trifluorobenzoic acid in 11 linear steps as illustrated in Scheme 1. This route is not only very long in terms of the number of steps, but also includes a number of chemical transformations that could be hazardous to carry out on a manufacturing scale, and/or produce levels of by-products that would not be acceptable in a final active pharmaceutical ingredient (API). It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that for a process to be suitable for industrial application it should be (i) amenable to being performed on large scale, (ii) have minimal environmental impact (for example in terms of amount of raw materials required and/or the amount of waste produced), (iii) safe (for example, use materials of low toxicity that do not produce toxic waste), and (iv) as low in cost as possible (for example, by being a higher yielding and more convergent synthesis).<br>
Since heterocyclic compounds such as benzimidazoles are potentially useful as therapeutics, there is an on-going need for a more efficient synthetic route for the production of benzimidazole derivatives that is more amenable to or suitable for large-scale manufacture. (Formula Removed)<br>

[00186]	The compound of Formula VI-11  or VI-12  is then reduced to provide<br>
compound of Formula VIIa-1<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00187]	wherein X5, R2, R2a and Z are as defined herein, wherein when A of said<br>
compound of Formula VI-11 or Formula VI-12 is -NH-benzyl, -NHOR1, -NHNHR1, or N3, then R2 and R2a of the compound of Formula VIIa-1 are hydrogen.<br>

using zinc powder and concentrated HC1 in a mixture of methanol and water, at temperatures<br>
between 0-100 °C, more typically at 50-70 °C. Catalytic hydrogenations can be performed<br>
with hydrogen in the presence of a metal catalyst in a suitable solvent system under hydrogen<br>

[00193]	When R2a is hydrogen, the compound of Formula VIIIa-1 can be directly<br>
converted to compound of Formula Ia-1 as shown in Figure 1. Several methods are known in the literature for the preparation of diarylamines by coupling an aromatic amine with a halobenzene (see, for Example, PCT Publication No. WO 02/083622). Nucleophilic aromatic substitutions and transition metal catalyzed processes are particularly common coupling methods. However, there are very few examples of efficient transition metal catalyzed coupling processes that provide diarylamines that are highly substituted in both rings, as is the case for compounds of Formula Ia-1. In addition, very few of the catalysts that have been reported in the literature for a coupling reaction between a trihalobenzene and an aromatic amine to provide the desired product in high yield. However, particular catalyst systems have been identified herein that can be employed to give high yields for the coupling of compounds of Formula VIIIa-1 with aryl halides.<br>
[00194]	More specifically, one embodiment for the preparation of compounds of<br>
Formula Ia-1, as shown in Figure 1, comprises a coupling reaction between a compound of Formula VIIIa-1, wherein R2a is hydrogen, and an aryl halide in the presence of a suitable metal-based catalyst and a base in an appropriate solvent. In one embodiment, the aryl halide has the Formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00195]	wherein X1 and X2 are as defined herein and X6 is F, Cl, Br, I, -OSO2CF3,<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00196]	In certain embodiments, X is F, Cl, Br, or I, X is C1-C10 alkyl, F, Cl, Br, or I,<br>
and X6 is F, Cl, Br, or I. In certain embodiments, X1 is Br. In certain embodiments, X2 is Cl.<br>
In another embodiment, X6 is iodo. In a particular embodiment, 4-bromo-2-<br>

reaction in the conversion of compounds of Formula VIIIa-1 to compounds of Formula Ia-1,<br>
wherein the iodo group of 4-bromo-2-chloroiodobenzene is selectively displaced. Suitable<br>

are not limited to, toluene, anisole, 2-methyltetrahydrofuran and dioxane.<br>
[00197]	Suitable metal-based catalysts for this coupling reaction include, but are not<br>
limited to, organometallic catalysts. The phrase "organometallic catalyst" means a catalyst<br>
comprising a metal and an organic ligand. Examples of metals include, but are not limited to,<br>
palladium, copper, nickel, and platinum. The preferred ligands for copper include those<br>
containing heteroatoms such as oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen or phosphorous. Ligands containing<br>
oxygen groups are generally inexpensive and readily available, and ethylene glycol is a<br>
particular example of a convenient ligand that is effective in the process. For palladium<br>
catalyzed coupling reactions, phosphine ligands have been shown to be effective, and in<br>
certain cases bidentate ligands containing either two phosphine groups or one phosphine<br>
group and a second heteroatom-containing group have been shown to be effective. Examples<br>
of such ligands include, but are not limited to, DPE-phos and Xantphos. Illustrative<br>
examples of suitable organopalladium catalysts include, but are not limited to, Pd(OAc)2 and<br>
Xantphos, Pd(OAc)2 and DPE-phos, Pd2(dba)3 and Xantphos, Pd2(dba)3 and DPE-phos,<br>

[bis(diphenylphosphino)ferrocene]. Other organopalladium catalysts are known, ana may be found in Comprehensive Organic Transformations, 2nd ed., by Richard C. Larock, VCH Publishers, Inc., New York, 1999. Preferred catalysts include, but are not limited to, Pd(OAc)2 and Pd2(dba)3 in combination with Xantphos or DPE-phos. A particular embodiment of the present invention comprises refluxing a compound of Formula VIIIa-1, wherein R2a is hydrogen, and a halo-substituted benzene in toluene in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2, Xantphos, and an excess amount of a suitable base such as CS2C03. Another embodiment of the present invention comprises refluxing a compound of Formula VIIIa-1, wherein R2a is hydrogen, and a halo-substituted benzene in toluene in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd(OAc)2 and DPE-phos in the presence of a suitable base. A particular embodiment of the present invention comprises heating a compound of Formula VIIIa-1 and a substituted halobenzene (e.g. 2-chloro-4-iodobromobenzne) at a temperature between 40 - 140 °C in anisole in the presence of a catalytic amount of Pd2(dba)3 and Xantphos and an excess amount of a. suitable base such as Cs2CO3.<br>

[00199]	In one embodiment a Pd scavenger, for example Silicycle Siliabond Si-<br>
Thiourea can be used to reduce the Pd content of the compounds produced by the process of<br>

[00200]	Alternatively, the metal-catalyzed coupling reaction can be earned out using a<br>
copper catalyst (see F.Y. Kwong, A. Klapars and S.L. Buchwald, Organic Letters 2002, 4,<br>
581-584).    Examples of suitable copper-based catalysts include, but are not limited to,<br>
Cul/ethylene glycol.  In one embodiment, the reaction is carried out in an alcoholic solvent,<br>
such as isopropanol or 2-butanol, with a simple chelating diol catalyst, such as ethylene<br>
glycol.<br>
[00201]	In an alternative embodiment, the coupling of a compound of Formula VIIIa-<br>
1 with an aryl halide to provide a compound of Formula Ia-1 can proceed by direct<br>
nucleophilic displacement, optionally in the presence of a base such as a lithium amide, at<br>
either ambient or elevated temperature.<br>
[00202]	Method 2:    In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>
method, referred to herein as Method 2, for preparing compounds of Formula Ia-2 and their<br>
synthetic intermediates<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00203]	and salts and solvates thereof, wherein R1, R2, R10, X1, X2 and Xs are as<br>
defined herein. Method 2, as illustrated in Figure 2, follows the diamination route of Method 1, with the exception that the Z group is converted to a -COOR1 group at some point during<br>
the synthesis of compounds of Formula Ia-2. For example, as shown in Figure 2, the Z group of a compound of Formula VI-11 or VI-12 (prepared as described in Method 1)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00204]	can be converted to the corresponding ester derivative represented by Formula<br>
Va-11 or Va-12<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00205]	wherein R1, R2, R2a and X5 are as defined herein, by reacting a compound of<br>
Formula VI-11 or VI-12 with a compound having the formula R1OH, optionally in the presence of an activating agent that activates said Z group towards reaction with the compound of formula R1OH, wherein R1 is as defined herein. Examples of activating agents suitable for purposes of this invention, include, but are not limited to, the activating agents listed above for Method 1, including (a) mineral and organic acids; (b) reagents capable of converting a carboxylic acid into an acid chloride including, but not limited to, halogenating agents; (c) carbodiimides; (d) trialkylsilyl halides; (e) chloroformates and (f) dialkylazodicarboxylates alone or together with a phosphine reagent.<br>

Formula Ia-2 in a manner similar to that described in Method 1. More specifically, as shown in Figure 2, one embodiment for the conversion of a compound of Formula Va-11 or Va-12 to a compound of Formula Ia-2 comprises:<br>
[00207]	(i) reducing said compound of Formula Va-11  or Va-12 to provide a<br>
compound of Formula VIIa-2<br>
wherein R1, R2, R2a and X5 are as defined herein, and wherein when A of said<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
compound of Formula Va-11 or Va-12 is -NH-benzyl, -NHOR1, -NHNHR1 or N3, then R2<br>
[00208]<br>
and R2a of Formula VIIa-2 are hydrogen;<br>
[00209]	(ii) when R2a is hydrogen, cyclizing said compound of Formula VIIa-2 using<br>
methods such as, but not limited to, any one of cyclization Methods A-E described herein, to provide a compound of Formula VIIIa-2<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00210]	wherein R1, R2, R2a, R10 and X5 are as defined herein; and<br>
[00211]	(iii)  when R2a  is  hydrogen,  coupling the  benzimidazole  represented  by<br>
Formula VIIIa-2 with a compound having the Formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00212]	wherein X1, X2 and X6 are as defined herein, optionally either (i) at elevated<br>
temperature and optionally in the presence of a base, or (ii) in the presence of a metal-based<br>
catalyst and a base, to provide said compound of Formula Ia-2. In certain embodiments, X1,<br>
X2 and X6 are independently F, Cl, Br, or I. In certain embodiments, X1 is Br. In certain<br>
embodiments, X2 is Cl. In another embodiment, X6 is iodo. In a particular embodiment, the<br>
compound of Formula VIIIa-2 is reacted with is 4-bromo-2-chloroiodobenzene.<br>
[00213]	In one embodiment, the synthesis of compounds of VIIIa-2 from compounds<br>
of Formula Va-11 or Va-12 is performed without isolation of the intermediate compound<br>
VIIa-2. In other embodiment, the intermediate compound of Formula VIIa-2 is isolated.<br>
[00214]	While Method 2 as illustrated in Figure 2 shows the conversion of the Z group<br>
to a COOR1 group during the preparation of a compound of Formula Va-11 or Va-12 from a compound of Formula VI-11 or VI-12, it is to be understood that Figure 2 shows only one of several embodiments of Method 2 for ease of explanation. That is, the Z group can be converted to COOR1 at any point during the process of Method 2.<br>
[00215]	Method 3:    In yet another embodiment, the present invention provides a<br>
stepwise animation method, referred to herein as Method 3 and shown generally in Figure 3, for the preparation of compounds of Formula Ib and their synthetic intermediates<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00216]	and salts and solvates thereof, wherein Z, X1, X2, X5, R2b and R10 are as<br>
defined herein. In general, according to one embodiment of the invention, a method for preparing a compound of Formula Ib-1 according to Method 3 comprises nitrating a compound having the Formula<br>
[00217] Formula II wherein X , X , X5 and Z are as defined herein, to provide a compound of<br><br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00218]	Nitration reaction conditions are well known to those skilled in the art.   For<br>
example, in one embodiment a trihalobenzoic acid can be treated with fuming nitric acid in H2SO4 to provide a 2,3,4-trihalo-5-nitrobenzoic acid.<br>
[00219]	Compounds of Formula II are then converted to compounds of Formula III-11<br>
or 111-12 by a stepwise animation process. A useful discovery was that the X3 and X4 groups<br>
of compounds represented by Formula II can be replaced independently. That is, the leaving group at the position ortho- to the nitro group in the compound of Formula II can be selectively replaced by a nitrogen nucleophile, in high yield, under carefully controlled conditions. The leaving group at the position para- to the nitro group can then be displaced by a second nucleophile at a convenient stage later in the synthetic route. Examples of selective stepwise mono-aminations are illustrated herein for Method 3 as well as in Method 4.<br>
[00220]	More specifically, in one embodiment a compound of Formula II is reacted<br>
with (i) a reagent that contains or generates ammonia, (ii) a primary or secondary amine other than an aromatic amine or (iii) a reagent that delivers a group that can subsequently be converted into an amine, under conditions that allow selective displacement of X4, to provide a compound of Formula III-ll, or said compound of Formula II is reacted with (iv) a metal azide under conditions that allow selective displacement of X4 to provide a compound of Formula 111-12<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00221]	wherein X3, X5, R2, R2a and Z are as defined herein.  In certain embodiments,<br>
R2a is a nitrogen protecting group such as substituted or unsubstituted benzyl, allyl or -C(O)OR6. In another embodiment, R2 and/or R2a is hydrogen.<br>
[00222]	Nucleophilic substitution of a halide or sulfonate ester ortho- or para- to a<br>
nitro group in an aromatic ring is a method well known in the art for the introduction of an amino group into an aromatic ring. The reaction conditions needed to achieve selective mono-amination at the position para- to the Z group depend on the type of nucleophile used in the mono-amination reaction. For example, if a strong nucleophile such as is used, the reaction may proceed easily at or below room temperature and at atmospheric pressure using one equivalent of the nucleophile to provide the desired mono-amination product. Examples of strong nucleophiles include, but are not limited to, aqueous ammonia (30% vol/vol) and metal amides such as sodium, potassium and lithium amide. Alternatively, if a weak nucleophile is used, more forcing conditions such as elevated temperatures and/or elevated<br>
pressure and/or an excess amount of the nucleophile may be required to achieve<br>
monoamination. Examples of weak nucleophiles include, but are not limited to, a primary or<br>
secondary amine substituted with a sterically bulky group such as t-butyl. The introduction<br>
of an amino group ortho- to the nitro groups causes the substitution product represented by<br>
Formula III-ll or 111-12 to be less reactive to further nucleophilic attack at the positionpara-<br>
to the nitro group, so the reaction can be carried out with a high level of selectivity.<br>
[00223]	For example, according to one embodiment a compound of Formula III-ll<br>
can be prepared by reacting a compound of Formula II with NH4OH at temperatures between 0 °C and room temperature in water (with or without an organic co-solvent) followed by acidification to pH between 0 and 7. Examples of suitable organic co-solvents include THF, 1,4-dioxane and N-methyl pyrrolidine. In certain embodiments, a compound of Formula III-ll is prepared by reacting a compound of Formula II with excess NH4OH in water at room temperature. The acidification can be accomplished by the addition of an acid such as, but not limited to, a dilute or concentrated mineral acid or a carboxylic acid such as acetic acid. In one embodiment, the above-described preparation of a compound of Formula III-ll or 111-12 is performed without isolation of the intermediate compound. In another embodiment, the intermediate compound represented by Formula II is isolated.<br>
[00224]	Examples of reagents that contain or generate ammonia for preparing a<br>
compound of Formula 111-11 or 111-12 include, but are not limited to, NH3 and NH4OH. Examples of primary and secondary amines suitable for purposes of this invention include amines having the formula HNR2R2a, wherein R2 and R2a are as defined herein. Specific examples of primary and secondary amines include, but are not limited to methylamine, benzylamine, dibenzylamine, allylamine, diallylamine and hexamethyldisilazane.

[00228]	According to  one  embodiment, the animation reaction is performed by<br>
reacting a compound of Formula III with a suitable nitrogen nucleophile using methods well known to those skilled in the art.

Typically the reaction is performed at elevated temperatures in the range of about 30 and 130 °C5 more preferably at temperatures between 50 and 95 °C.<br>
[00229]	For example, in one embodiment a compound of Formula Vb-11 wherein A =<br>

to a -COOR1 group during the preparation of a compound of Formula IV-21 or IV-22 from a<br>
compound of Formula III-ll or 111-12, it is to be understood that Figure 4 shows only one of<br>
several embodiments of Method 4 for ease of explanation.   That is, the Z group can be<br>
converted to -COOR1 at any point during the process of Method 4.<br>
[00255]	This invention further provides compounds of Formula VIIb-2 and VIIIb-2<br>
and salts and solvates thereof.<br>
[00256]	Yet another embodiment of the present invention provides a method, referred<br>
to herein as Method 5, for preparing N-l benzimidazole compounds represented by Formula<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00257] and salts and solvates thereof, wherein Z, R  , X , X  and X  are as defined<br>

[00263]	Methods 1-5 of the present invention provide a number of distinct advantages<br>
over conventional processes for preparing compounds of the general Formulas Ia-1, Ib-1 and Ic-1. For example, the processes of the present invention provide compounds of the general Formulas Ia-1, Ib-1 and Ic-1 in higher yields compared to conventional processes. Further, the invention provides methods for the regioselective and chemoselective cyclization of compounds of Formulas VIIa-1 and Vltb-1 to provide benzimidazoles of Formulas VIIIa-1 and VIIIb-1, respectively. In addition, the process of the present invention is more reliable and suitable for the large-scale synthesis of benzimidazoles than conventional processes. For example, the conversion of a compound of Formula VIIa-1 or VIIb-1 to a compound of Formula VIIIa-1 or VIIIb-1, respectively, according to the methods of the present invention<br>
produces far less toxic by-products than methods utilized in the prior art for the synthesis of<br>
benzimidazole ring systems, and is a more efficient process. The synthetic methods of the<br>
present invention are selective and the preparation of compounds of this invention can be<br>
earned out in high yield, thus providing industrial value. Furthermore, benzimidazole<br>
derivatives represented by Formulas VIIIa-1, VIIIb-1, Ia-1, Ib-1 and Ic-1 can be<br>
synthesized from trihalobenzoic acids in a relatively short number of steps.<br>
[00264]	Benzimidazole cyclizations<br>
[00265]	As stated, the cyclizatiou of compounds of Formulas VIIa-1, VIIa-2, VIIb-1<br>
and VIIb-2 in any of Methods 1 -5 of the present invention to provide benzimidazole core structures can be performed in several ways. Several methods, namely Methods A-E, are described below and are illustrated in Figures 6-10. While Methods A-E are described specifically with respect to the cyclization of a compound of Formula VIIb-1 for ease of explanation, it is to be understood that Methods A-E also apply equally to the cyclization of compounds of Formulas VIIa-1, VIIa-2 and VIIb-2. The cyclization methods will provide either N-3 benzimidazole derivatives or N-l benzimidazole derivatives, depending on the reagents used and the particular R2 and R2a substituents on the compounds of Formulas Vlla-1, VIIa-2, VIIb-1 and VIIb-2<br>
[00266]	Method A:    According to cyclization Method A as shown in Figure 6, a<br>
compound of Formula VIIb-1, where R2 and R2a are hydrogen, can be cyclized to the corresponding benzimidazole tautomer represented by Formula VIIIb-1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00267]	(i.e.,  wherein R10 is hydrogen) according to  a "one-pot"  process which<br>
comprises reacting a compound of Formula VIIb-1 with (i) formic acid optionally in the presence of an additional acid, or (ii) a formic acid derivative in the presence of an acid under appropriate conditions known to those skilled in the art. As used herein, the term "formic acid derivative" includes, but is not limited to, esters of formic acid such as, but not limited to, trimethylorthoformate, triethylorthoformate, and formamidine acetate. For example, in one embodiment, a compound of Formula VIIb-1 (wherein Z is CO2Me, and R2 and R2a are<br>
H) was converted into a compound of Formula VIIIb-1 (wherein Z is C02Me) in very high<br>
yield upon reaction with methyl orthoformate and sulfuric acid in THF solution.<br>
[00268]	Method B:   According to Method B, as illustrated in Figure 7, compound of<br>
Formula VIIb-1, wherein R2a is hydrogen and R2 is not hydrogen, can be cyclized to the corresponding N-3 benzimidazole represented by Formula VIHb-1 by a multi-step method upon treatment with (i) formic acid, optionally in the presence of an additional acid, (ii) a formic acid derivative (for example, a formic acid ester such as trimethylorthoformate, triethylorthoformate, or formamidine acetate) in the presence of an acid, or (iii) formaldehyde or a formaldehyde derivative in the presence of an acid, to provide an intermediate N-l benzimidazole compound represented by the Formula XIb-1. As used herein, the term "formaldehyde derivative" includes, but is not limited to, dialkoxymethanes such as diethoxymethane and dimethoxymethane.<br>
[00269]	Alkylation of the compound of Formula XIb-1 provides the benzimidazolium<br>
ion represented by the compound of Formula XIIb-1. Removal of the N-l substituent (i.e., the R2 substituent) from the compound of Formula XIIb-1 provides the N-3 benzimidazole compound represented by Formula VIIIb-1, which can undergo an arylation reaction such as described in Method 1 to provide the N-3 benzimidazole compound represented by Formula Ib-1.<br>
[00270]	Methods for removing N-l substituents benzimidazoles are well known to<br>
persons skilled in the art, and the reagents and reaction conditions required depend on the nature of the R2 group. For example, when the R2 group of a compound of Formula XIIb-1 is substituted or unsubstituted benzyl, allyl or COOR6 wherein R6 is benzyl, removal of the R2 group can be achieved by hydrogenation. An N-l allyl substituent can also be removed by heating a compound of Formula XIIb-1 in-the presence of an organometallic catalyst such as Rh(PPh3)3Cl (also known as Wilkinson's catalyst).<br>
[00271]	Method C: Cyclization Method C, as shown in Figure 8, provides a "one pot"<br>
method of selectively and directly converting a compound of Formula VIIb-1, where R2 and R2a are hydrogen, to an N-3 benzimidazole derivative represented by Formula VIIIb-1<br>
[00272]	wherein R10 is methyl. Method C comprises treating a compound of Formula<br>
VIIb-l with (i) two or more equivalents of formaldehyde or a formaldehyde derivative in the presence of an acid. Suitable formaldehyde derivatives include, but are not limited to, dialkoxymethanes such as diethoxymethane and dimethoxymethane. Suitable acids for purposes of this invention include mineral acids (e.g., sulfuric acid, HC1, HBr), sulfonic acids (methanesulfonic acid, toluenesulfonic acid, etc.) or carboxylic acids such as formic acid or acetic acid. In one non-limiting embodiment, the reaction is performed in acetonitrile containing some water and diethoxymethane or dimethoxymethane in the presence of an acid such as toluenesulfonic acid. This reaction advantageously proceeds with complete regioselectivity to provide N-3 methyl benzimidazoles represented by Formula VIIIb-1. Another advantageous feature of this process is that the formaldehyde does not appear to react with the amino group ortho to the Z group of compounds represented by Formula VIIIb-1. Furthermore, the reaction conditions avoid the production of bis-chloromethyl ether as a by-product. This by-product is a carcinogen, and its production on an industrial scale is highly undesirable.<br>
[00273]	Method D:     According to another embodiment,  an N-3  benzimidazole<br>
derivative represented by Formula VIIIb-1, wherein R10 is not hydrogen, can be prepared from a compound of Formula VIIb-1 in a stepwise manner as shown in Figure 9. More specifically, Method D comprises treating a compound of Formula VIIb-1, wherein R2 and R2a are hydrogen, with a suitable acylating agent such as, but not limited to, formic acid, an acid anhydride (for example acetic anhydride), an acid halide (for example acetyl chloride) or an ester (for example trifluoroethyl formate) to provide the intermediate compound represented by Formula IXb<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00274]	wherein Z, R2, R2a and X5 are as defined herein and R10a is H, C1-C10 alkyl,<br><br>
C3-C10 cycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl, heteroarylalkyl or heterocyclylalkyl, wherein said alkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl, heteroarylalkyl, and heterocyclylalkyl portions are optionally substituted with one or more groups independently selected from halogen, hydroxyl, cyano, nitro, azido, C1-C4 alkyl, C2-C4 alkenyl, C2-C4 alkynyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, C3-C6<br>
heterocycloalkyl, -NR6R7 and -OR8.<br>
[00275]	The amide group of the compound of Formula IXb is then reduced to provide<br>
an intermediate compound represented by Formula Xb<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00276]	Suitable reducing agents include, but are not limited to, borane-type reducing<br>
agents (e.g., BH3 THF) in an appropriate solvent such as THF. Alternatively, compounds of Formula Xb can be formed directly from a compound of Formula VIIb-1 by reaction with an alkylatmg agent of formula R10aCH2X, wherein X is a leaving group such as Cl, Br, I, OMs, OTs, OTf, etc. Examples of alkylating agents include alkyl halides such as ethyl iodide. Cyclization of the compound of Formula Xb to provide the benzimidazole represented by Formula VIIIb-1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00277]	wherein R    is not hydrogen, is accomplished by reacting the compound of<br><br>
Formula Xb with (i) formic acid optionally in the presence of an additional acid or (ii) a<br>
formic acid derivative (for example, esters of formic acid such as, but not limited to,<br>
trimethylorthoformate, triethylorthoformate and formamidine acetate) in the presence of an<br>
acid under appropriate conditions known to those skilled in the art to provide a compound of<br>
Formula VIIIb-1. The compound of Formula VIIIb-1 can be reacted with an aryl halide as<br>
described in Method 1 to provide an N-3-benzimidazole compound of Formula Ib-1.<br>
[00278]	Method E: In an alternative multi-step cyclization method, referred to herein<br>
as Method E as shown in Figure 10, a compound of Formula VIIb-1, wherein R2" is hydrogen and R2 is not hydrogen, can be cyclized to the corresponding benzimidazole compound of Formula VIIIb-1, wherein R10 is not hydrogen, by a step-wise method comprising:<br>
[00279](a) reacting a compound of Formula VIIb-1<br>
[00280]with a suitable acylating agent to provide a compound of Formula IXb<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00281]	wherein Z, R2, R2a and X5 are as defined herein and Rlua is H, C1-C10 alkyl,<br>
C3-C10 cycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl, heteroarylalkyl or heterocyclylalkyl, wherein said alkyl, cycloalkylalkyl, arylalkyl, heteroarylalkyl and heterocyclylalkyl portions are optionally substituted with one or more groups independently selected from halogen, hydroxyl, cyano, nitro, azido, C1-C4 alkyl, C2-C4 alkenyl, C2-C4 alkynyl, C3-C6 cycloalkyl, C3-C6 heterocycloalkyl, -NR6R7 and -OR8;<br>
[00282]	(b) reducing the amide group of said compound of Formula IXb to provide a<br>
compound of Formula Xb<br>

 [00283]	wherein Z, R2, R2a, R2b, R2c, R10a and X5 are as defined herein;<br>
[00284]	(c) reacting said compound of Formula Xb with (i) formic acid optionally in<br>
the presence of an additional acid or (ii) a formic acid derivative (for example, esters of formic acid such as, but not limited to, trimethylorthoformate, triethylorthoformate and formamidine acetate) in the presence of an acid to provide said compound of Formula XIIb-1<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
 [00285]	wherein Z, R2, R2b, R2c; R10 and X5 are as defined herein; and<br>
[00286]	removing the R2 group using methods such as those described in Method B to<br>
provide the N-3 benzimidazole compound of Formula VIIIb-1. The compound of Formula VIIIb-1 can be reacted with an aryl halide as described in Method 1 to provide an N-3 benzimidazole compound of Formula Ib-1. Alternatively, according to another embodiment of Method E, a compound of Formula Xb may be obtained by reaction of VIIb-1 with an alkylating agent of the formula R10aCH2L, wherein L is a leaving group, such as Cl, Br, I, OMs, OTs, OTf, etc.<br>
[00287]	The above-described cyclization Methods A-E of the present invention offer<br>
several advantages over conventional methods for the preparation of benzimidazole derivatives. First, there are only a few literature examples of the conversion of a diamino aryl compound to a benzimidazole (see, for example, G. P. Ellis, R.T. Jones, J. Chew. Soc., Perkin 1, 1974, 903; G.T. Morgan, W.A.P. Challenor, J. Chem. Soc. Trans., 1921, 1537; N.S. Zefirov, G.A. Sereda, V.P. Volkov, S.E. Tkachenko, N.V. Zyk, ECHET98: Electronic Conference on Heterocyclic Chemistry, (1988) 406-408; V. Milata, D. llavsky, Organic Proc. And Prep. Int., (1993), 25:703-704), however, none of the reported examples involved highly substituted substrates such as those involved in the process of the present invention. In addition, in many of the literature examples the regioselectivity is uncertain (G.T. Morgan, W.A.P. Challenor, J. Chem. Soc. Trans., 1921,1537), and none of the methods prior to the present invention utilize a substrate having a third amino substituent on the aromatic ring, which has the potential to react with the formaldehyde, leading to the formation of alternative products. Furthermore, the methods of this invention are more suitable for industrial applications, since it uses reagents that are less toxic than the HC1/HCHO reagent mixture used in conventional methods, and therefore do not generate toxic by-products such as dichloromethyl ether.<br>

The mixture was then stirred, purged with nitrogen, and heated to 55 °C. Stirring was then paused while the system was purged with hydrogen (4 bar), and stirring was then recommenced at 750 rpm. After 6.75 hours observable hydrogen uptake had ceased and 29.1 L of hydrogen had been taken up. The system was then purged with nitrogen and allowed to cool to 20 °C. HPLC analysis indicated that all starting material had been reacted and that the solution yield of the desired triamine product was approximately 96%. The mixture was then filtered using a Whatman 1 µ. in-line filter to remove the catalyst and the system was washed with tetrahydrofuran (400 mL). Solvent was then distilled off until a total of 1400 mL had been collected and the mixture was allowed to cool to ambient temperature.

solution of methyl 4-amino-2, 3-difluoro-5-nitrobenzoate (4) (33.0 g, 142.15 mmol) in 1,4-dioxane (165 mL , 1.93 moles), in a 250 mL glass pressure vessel, was added an aqueous solution of ammonia (39 g, 711 mmol, 42.9 mL, 16.5 M). The vessel was then heated in an immersion bath at a bath temperature between 79 and 105 °C, for 80 minutes, over which time the internal pressure ranged between 0.2 and 2.7 bar. The pressure was then released slowly and the mixture was treated with water (330 mL, 10 vol). The resultant suspension was stirred for 20 minutes and then filtered under vacuum, and the solid was washed with water (33 mL, 1 vol). The solid was sucked dry, then dried in a vacuum oven at 50 °C to provide methyl 2,4-diamino-3-fluoro-5-nitrobenzoate (5) (32.6 g, 92% yield) as a yellow solid.
