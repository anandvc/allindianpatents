				<td>The machine relates to a machine for winding lap	sheets into<br>
laps with lap rollers, each of which carry a lap	lined up with<br>
the calender rollers for calendering a lap sheet	which is fed<br>
in and with a driving motor for rotating the lap	rollers and<br>
the calender rollers.<br>
Machines of this type, also known as sliver lap machines, are already known. They serve for the production of laps which are then laid in the combers in which the lap sheets are combed. A lap sheet to be wound can be produced in such a machine for example, from fibre slivers from one or several drafting arrangements, perhaps from slivers which are pulled out of cans placed next to each other, drawn and then fed to the calender rollers.<br>
It is customary, in such machines, to end a winding operation after a predetermined lap sheet length has been wound. For this purpose, in the known machines, the driving motor, which drives the lap rollers, the calender rollers and at least one drafting arrangement, is stopped. Subsequently, a clutch, which is arranged between the lap rollers and the driving motor as well as the other driven parts, is disengaged and its own auxiliary motor, with a reduction gear, can be switched on, which slowly rotates the lap rollers alone, so that the lap between the calender rollers and the lap rollers is ruptured before the lap is ejected from the machine.<br>
The invention has accomplishment of the task of designing a machine described at the outset in such a way that the cost of the auxiliary motor with a reduction gearbox mentioned above can be saved, in such a way that a mechanized, preferably automatic rupture of the lap sheet between the calender rollers and the lap roller is possible.<br>
2568<br><br>
The machine according to the invention with which the task is achieved is characterized through a coupling between the driving motor and the calender roller for the interruption of the drive of the calender rollers with lap rollers which continue to turn.<br>
Through the release of this clutch, it is possible, in a simple way, to stop the calender rollers whilst the driving motor still continues to turn the lap rollers, in order to rupture the lap sheet between the calender rollers and the lap rollers.<br>
It is desirable to turn the lap rollers at a slow speed when rupturing the lap sheet, for example with a rotational speed which only amounts to about 20% of the rotational speed when winding on the lap sheet. The driving motor is preferably a frequency controlled electric motor which is fed from a controllable frequency converter. A control device can be so designed and arranged so that the clutch disengages each time after winding a predetermined lap sheet length, so that the frequency converter control operates in such a way that the driving motor of the lap rollers is turned slowly, until the end of the ruptured lap sheet lies on a predetermined and selectable position on the  circumference of the lap and then switches off the supply to the driving motor.<br>
	Accordingly, the present invention provides a machine for winding lap sheets to laps<br>
'	with lap rollers for carrying laps one at a time, with the lap rollers lined up with the<br>
,	calender rollers for calendering a lap sheet and with a driving motor for turning the lap<br>
	rollers and the calender rollers, characterized in that, through a clutch arranged<br>
	between the driving motor and the calender rollers, the drive to the calender rollers is<br>
	interrupted by a control unit for ending a winding operation at any given time when a<br>
	predetermined lap sheet length has been reached whilst the lap rollers continue to<br>
|	revolve.<br><br>
An embodiment example of the machine according to the invention is explained more<br>
closely in the following with the aid of the drawings. These slow:<br>
Fig. 1 Schematic parts of a lap machine.<br>
Fig. 2. A drive diagram for the parts shown in Fig. 1<br>
Fig. 1 shows a lap 1, which lies on two rotating lap rollers 2 and 3 rotating in the direction of the arrow on a sliver lap machine. A lap sheet 4 runs through a calender consisting of four rollers 5, 6, 7 and 8, before it runs to the lap 1 and is wound on to this. The lap sheet 4 is formed in a drafting arrangement 9 of the sliver lap machine out of one or more—■<br>
i<br><br><br>
frame. One or more further drafting arrangements (not shown) can be connected in series to the drafting arrangement 9.<br>
Fig.2 shows in a driving diagram a driving motor 11 of the lap sheet lap machine and the gear parts for driving the lap rollers 2 and 3 the calender rollers 5, 6, 7 and 8. A belt pulley 12 mounted on the shaft of the motor 11 is coupled through a belt 13 with a belt pulley 14, on the shaft of which three gears 15, 16 and 17 are mounted. The gear 15 is connected through a chain 18 (or a toothed belt) with a gear 19 supported on the shaft of the calender roller 8. The gear 19 is coupled with the shaft of the calender roller 8 via a disengageable clutch 20, for example an electro magnetic gear coupling. The shafts of the calender rollers 5, 6, 7 and 8 together carry combing gears 21, 22, 23 and 24.<br>
The gear 16 combs with a gear 25, which is coupled with a shaft via a disengageable coupling 26 with a gear part, which is not ■      represented, for the drive of transport rollers and shafts and „     the drafting arrangement 9 or the drafting arrangement of the £     sliver lap machine.<br>
)<br>
"J     The gear 17 combs with a gear 27 which is mounted on the shaft<br>
■I<br>
of a gear 28. The gears 27 and 28 can be exchanged, in order to<br>
     vary the rotational speed of the lap rollers 2 and 3 (related<br>
     to the rotational speed of the calender rollers 5,   6, 7, 8).<br>
    The gear 28 combs with a gear 29, which, in turn, has a gear 30<br>
    mounted on its shaft which combs with a gear 31. A gear 32 is<br>
	mounted on the shaft of the gear 31 which is coupled via a<br>
chain 33 to a gear on the shaft of the lap roller 2 and a gear<br>
	35. The gear 35 combs with a gear 36, on the shaft of which a<br>
    gear 37 is mounted. The gears 36 and 37 can be exchanged in<br>
order to vary the rotational speed of the lap roller 3 (related<br>
to the rotational speed of the lap roller 2.<br><br>
The gear 37 combs with a gear 38, on the shaft of which a gear 39 is mounted which is coupled with a chain 40 with the gear 41 on the shaft of the lap roller 3.<br>
On the shaft of the calender roller 8, a counter 42 is arranged which gives a signal to a control unit 43 as soon as a predeterminable length of lap sheet has been wound on to the lap 1.<br>
The driving motor 11 is a frequency controlled electrical asynchronous motor, which is fed from a controllable frequency converter 44. During the winding of the preselected length of the lap sheet, the frequency converter 44 feeds the driving motor 11 with a reference frequency, so that the driving motor 11 turns the lap rollers 2 and 3 with a first rotational speed. When the control unit 43 receives the signal from the counter 42, it then controls the frequency 44 in such a way, that the driving motor 11 is fed with a lower frequency, through which the driving motor 11 turns temporarily at a lower speed. At this lower speed, the rotational speed of the lap rollers 2 and 3 is 50%, preferably a maximum of 30% of the first rotational speed mentioned. When the selectable lap sheet length entered in the control unit 43 has been reached, the control unit 43 then disengages the clutches 20 and 26, so that the calendar rollers 5, 6, 7 and 8 and the parts driven over the gear 25, for example the drafting arrangement 9 (Fig.l) come to a standstill. Accordingly, the further revolution of the lap rollers 2 and 3 ruptures the lap sheet lap 4 between the calender rollers 5, 6, 7, 8. After the ruptured lap sheet end has been wrapped on the lap sheet lap, the control unit 43 shuts off the driving motor completely, for example, through the interruption of the supply to the frequency converter 44.<br><br>
The control unit 43 can then undertake the ejection and removal of the full lap and the placing of a new empty winding tube on the lap rollers through the operation of the devices which are not represented.<br>
The use of the frequency controlled driving motor 11 with the frequency converter 44 has the advantage that the control unit control 43, at the start of winding procedure, can arrange a gentle start to a winding operation and, if desired, in the course of the winding operation, the rotational speed of the lap rollers 2, 3 can be reduced gradually or in steps.<br><br><br>
