				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
N-Alkylaspartyl Dipeptide Ester Derivative and Sweetening<br>
Agent<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a novel N-alkylasparty1 dipeptide ester derivative, a sweetening agent or a sweetened food or the like product comprising the derivative as an effective component.<br>
Background Art<br>
In recent years, as eating habits have been improved to a high level, fatness caused by excessive sugar intake and diseases accompanied by fatness have been at issue. Accordingly, the development of a low-calory sweetener ( sweetening agent ) that replaces sugar has been in demand. As a sweetener that has been widely used at present, there is aspartame which is excellent in safety and quality of sweetness. However, this is somewhat problematic in stability. In the international Patent Publication WO 94/11391, it is stated that derivatives in which an alkyl group is introduced on a nitrogen atom of aspartic acid constituting the aspartame are markedly improved in the sweetening potency and are slightly improved in stability.<br><br>
Of the compounds stated in this Publication, N-[N-(3,3-<br>
dimethylbutyl)-L- a    -aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine  1-methyl<br>
ester, which has introduced 3,3 - dimethylbutyl group as an<br>
alkyl group is most excellent.   The sweetening potency of<br>
this compound is reported to be 10000 times that of sucrose,<br>
which is a value obtained on comparing the above compound to<br>
a 2%-, 5%- and 10%-sucrose solution. There are also stated<br>
aspartame  derivatives  having  introduced  20  types  of<br>
substituents  other  than  3, 3 -dimethylbutyl  group.    The<br>
sweetening  potency  of  these  aspartame  derivatives  is<br>
reported to be not higher than 2500 times that of sucrose.<br>
There  are  also  stated  aspartame  derivatives  having<br>
introduced a 3- (substituted phenyl) propyl group as an alkyl<br>
group.        Among  these,  N- [N- (3-phenylpropyl) - L - Oi    -<br>
aspartyl] -L- phenylalanine 1-methyl ester and N- [N- (3- (3-<br>
methoxy-4 - hydroxyphenylpropyl) - L -  β	-	aspartyl] -L-<br>
phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, as derivatives having relatively high sweetening potency, are reported to have the sweetening potency of 1500 and 2500 times that of sucrose, respectively. However, the sweetening potency of these derivatives is much lower than that of N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl) - L- a - aspartyl] -L-phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, which is 10000 times that of sucrose. Also, N- [N-[(RS)-3- phenylbutyl]-L- oc -aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methylester, having, as an alkyl group, a substituent corresponding to a 3-phenyl propyl group,  to the third<br><br>
position of which a methyl group is further introduced, that is a 3-phenyl butyl group, is reported to have a sweetening potency of 1200 times that of sucrose. It is slightly lowered in  sweetening  potency  in  comparison  with  N- [N- (3-<br>
phenylpropyl) -L - a     -aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine  1-methyl ester due to the methyl group introduced at the third position. On the other hand,  N - [N - [3 - ( 3 - methoxy - 4 - hydroxyphenyl) -(RS) -   1-methylpropyl] -L- a  -aspartyl] -L- phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, having a structure corresponding to N- [N-<br>
[3- (3- methoxy-4 -hydroxyphenyl) propyl]-L- a -aspartyl] -L- phenylalanine 1-methyl ester, to the fist position of the propyl group of which a methyl group is introduced, is reported to have a sweetening potency of 500 times that of sucrose. This derivative is lowered significantly in its sweetening potency due to the methyl group introduced at the first position of the propyl group. As an example of substituting the L-phenylalanine methyl ester moiety with another amino acid ester, there is stated N-[N-(3,3-dimethylbutyl) -L- a -aspartyl]-L- tyrosine 1-methyl ester. This derivative is reported to have a sweetening potency of 4000 times that of sucrose. In view of the above - described status of the art, a development of a low-calory sweetening agent having a superior sweetening potency has been requested.<br>
Problem to be solved bv Invention<br><br>
It is a problem to be solved by the present invention to provide a novel N-alkylaspartyl dipeptide ester derivative having a sweetening potency equivalent or superior  to  that  of  the  above - described  N- [N- [3,3-<br>
dimethylbutyl] - L - Oi -aspartyl]-L phenylalanine 1-methylester, and a low-calory sweetening agent comprising the derivative as an effective component (ingredient).<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
For resolving the above problem, the present inventors have synthesized a variety of compounds in which a variety of 3 - (substituted phenyl) propyl group, such as 3,3-dialkyl- 3 - ( substituted phenyl) propyl groups or (RS)-3-alkyl- 3 - (substituted phenyl) propyl groups, have been introduced on a nitrogen atom of an aspartic acid constituting an aspartame and an aspartame derivative, by reductive alkylation, using a 3 -phenylpropionaldehyde derivative, a cinnamaldehyde derivative, a (2 -phenylethyl) alkyl ketone derivative or the like having a variety of substituents on a phenyl group and also having 1 to 4 alkyl substituents on the main chain, and examined the sweetening potency of these derivatives. The aspartame derivative is a compound corresponding to the aspartame the L-phenylalanine methyl ester moiety of which is substituted by another amino acid ester therein. As a result of our investigations,  the sweetening potency of  some of  the<br><br>
aspartame derivatives is much higher in sweetening potency<br>
than     N- [N- (3 , 3-dimethylbutyl) -L-    a	-aspartyl]-L<br>
phenylalanine 1 -methylester reported to have the sweetening potency of 10000 times that of sucrose, to say nothing of<br>
N- [N- [ (RS) - 3-phenylbutyl] -L- a   -aspartyl]-L- phenylalanine 1 - methyles ter reported to have the sweetening potency of 1200<br>
times that of sucrose or N- [N- (3,3 - dimethylbutyl) -L - a -aspartyl]-L- tyrosine 1 -methylester reported to have a sweetening potency equal to 4000 times that of sucrose, as disclosed in the international Patent Publication WO 94/11391, and that, in particular, the compound represented by the general formula (1) below is superior as a sweetening agent.

These salts may be included in the derivatives of the present invention, as pointed out above. The N-alkylaspartyl dipeptide ester derivative of the present invention can be easily synthesized by reductive alkylation of aspartame or aspartame derivatives, that is compounds   obtained  on  replacing  an  L-phenylalanine methylester moity in the aspartame by another amino acid ester,  using  a  3-phenylpropionaldehyde  derivative,  a cinnamaldehyde derivative or a (2-phenylethyl) alkylketone derivative, which has different substituents on a phenyl group and also having one to four alkyl substituents on the main   chain,   and   a   reducing   agent,   such   as   a hydrogen/palladium carbon catalyst.     Alternatively, the N-alkylaspartyl dipeptide ester derivative of the present invention can be produced by a method consisting in reductive alkylation of an aspartame derivative, having a protecting group in a i3 -position in the carboxylic acid, such as i3 -0-benzyl- d-L-aspartyl-L-amino acid methyl ester, using the above - described  3-phenylpropionaldehyde  derivative,   a cinnamaldehyde derivative or a (2 -phenylethyl) alkylketone derivative, and a reducing agent, such as NaB(0Ac)3H, as<br><br>
disclosed in A. F. Abdel - Magid et al . , Tetrahedron letters, 31, 5595 (1990), followed by removal of protecting groups thereof, or by a method consisting in saturating unsaturated bonds with a reducing agent, as the occasion may demand.  The above aspartame derivative may be obtained by a usual peptide synthesis  method,  as  discussed  in  Izumiya  et  al . , Fundamentals and Experimentation in Peptide Synthesis. Published by MARUZEN on January 20, 1985. The method for synthesis of the compounds in the present invention is, however, not limited to these methods.    In place of the above-mentioned    3 -phenylpropionaldehyde    derivative, cinnamaldehyde derivative or the  (2-phenylethyl)  alkyl ketone derivative, acetal or ketal derivatives thereof may, of course, be used as the aldehyde or ketone components at the time of the reductive alkylation.<br>
As a result of sensory evaluation, the derivative, that .<br>
is the compound, and salt forms thereof, according to the<br>
present invention, have been found to have strong sweetening<br>
potency and sensory properties similar to that of sugar.  For<br>
example,    the    sweetness   of   N- [N- [3- (3 - hydroxy - 4-<br>
methoxyphenyl) - 3 -        methylbutyl] -L- a     -aspartyl] -L-<br>
phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 70000 times<br>
that of sugar,  the sweetness of   N - [N - [ 3 - (3-methyl - 4-<br>

phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 60000 times that of sugar,  andthe sweetness of   N-[N-[(RS)-3-(3-<br>
hydroxy-4-methoxyphenyl) butyl] -L- Oi -aspartyl] -L-<br>
phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was approximately 50000 times<br>
that of sugar. On the other hand, the half life in a buffer<br>
of pH = 3.0 at 72.0 °C of N - [N - [3 - (3 - me thoxy - 4-<br>
hydroxyphenyl) - 3-methylbutyl] -L-      a	-aspartyl] -L-<br>
phenylalanine 1-methyl ester was 34.4 hours,  which was substantially equivalent to the half life of N- [N- (3,3-dimethylbutyl)-L- a -aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine  1-methyl ester (31.4 hours under the same condition).     Also, the half life in a buffer with pH=3.0 at 70.0 t of aspartame, N-[N-(3,3-dimethyIbutyl)-L- Oi  -aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1 -methyl   ester,   N- [N- [3- (3 - hydroxy - 4-methoxyphenyl) -3-methyIbutyl] -L- OL -aspartyl] -L-phenylalanine 1 - methyl ester and     N- [N- [3- (4-hydroxyphenyl) - 3-methylbutyl] -L- a aspartyl]-L-phenylalanine 1-methylester, was measured, and found to be 23.5, 38.3, 44.5 and 43.6 hours, respectively. Table 1 shows the structures of several synthesized N-alkyl aspartyl dipeptide ester derivatives, shown by the general formula (6), indicated below, and results of the sensory evaluation tests.<br>
As may be seen from the results of Table 1, the novel derivatives of the present invention are particularly excellent in sweetness (sweetening potency).<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Meanwhile, in case that the derivatives of the present invention (compounds of the present invention inclusive of salt forms thereof) are used as a sweetening agent, it is of course possible to use other sweetening agents in combination.<br>
If the derivatives of the present invention are used as the sweetening agents, it is of course possible to use a carrier and/or a bulking agent, for example, a carrier or a bulking agent so far known and used.<br>
The derivatives of the present invention can be used as a sweetening agent or a component thereof. In addition, the derivatives of the present invention can be used for products, such as foods or the like products, in need of a sweet taste, such as confectionery, chewing gums, hygiene products, toiletries, cosmetics, pharmaceuticals and various veterinary products for animals other than those for humans. Moreover, the derivatives of the present invention can be used as form of a product to be given or endowed with a sweet taste and in a sweet taste imparting method for the products ( foods or the like products ) in need of a sweet taste.   As for the method of using the derivatives of the<br>
•<br>
present invention, any suitable conventional or well-known method can be followed.<br>
