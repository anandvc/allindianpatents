COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"AN ORAL PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION"<br>
AstraZeneca AB, a Swedish company of S-151 85 Sodertalje, Sweden,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
23-10-2007<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to an oral pharmaceutical formulation.<br>
The present invention concerns a new oral pharmaceutical formulation, comprising a basic pharmaceutically active ingredient having pH-dependent solubility, which inhibits s     the release of the basic pharmaceutical active ingredient from the fonnulation at acidic pH (preferably below pH 3) and preferably provides substantially pH-independent controlled-release of the pharmaceutically active ingredient over the broad pH range in the gastrointestinal tract; a process for the manufacture of said formulation; and to the use of said formulation in medicine.<br>
Effective controlled-release pharmaceutical formulations are desirable pharmaceutical products, as these allow: optimization of drug therapy; and an opportunity both to decrease frequency of dosage and to minimize undesirable side effects. However, the design of such controlled-release systems is not a simple matter, especially when the drag formulation is intended for oral administration and has to pass through the gastrointestinal tract, which exhibits, among other characteristics, a large variation in pH along its length.<br>
Many drugs showing basic properties ionize at low pH and become significantly ■ more soluble in this pH region compared to a more neutral environment. This manifestation of pH-dependent solubility in the gastrointestinal tract can result in variable drug release profiles, with parallel in-vivo bioavailability problems.<br>
Several- attempts to overcome the problem of pH-dependent solubility of basic drugs have been described. These strategies include the use of an enteric polymer, which is insoluble at low pH, to retard drug release in low pH environments [see, for example, US4968508, and A. Streubel et al. J. Controlled Release, 67,101-110 (2000)], or the incorporation of a low molecular weight organic acid to create an acidic micro-environmental pH inside the formulation matrix, thus keeping the solubility of the drug constant [see, for example, K.E. Gabr., Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm., 3$(6), 199-202 (1992), and V.K-Thoma and Th. Zimmer, Pharm. Ind. 51(1), 98-101 (1989)].

However, the design of such controlled-release systems is not a simple matter, especially when the drug formulation is intended for oral administration and has to pass through the is     gastrointestinal tract, which exhibits, among other characteristics, a large variation in pH along its length.<br>
Many drugs showing basic properties ionize at low pH and become significantly • more soluble in this pH region compared to a more neutral environment. This manifestation of pH-dependent solubility in the gastrointestinal tract can result in variable 20     drug release profiles, with parallel in-vivo bioavailability problems.<br>
Several" attempts to overcome the problem of pH-dependent solubility of basic drugs have been described. These strategies include the use of an enteric polymer, which is insoluble at low pH, to retard drug release in low pH environments [see, for example, US4968508, and A. Streubel et at I Controlled Release, 67,101-110 (2000)], or the 25     incorporation of a low molecular weight organic acid to create an acidic micro-environmental pH inside the formulation matrix, thus keeping die solubility of the drug constant [see, for example, K.E. Gabr., Eur. J. Pharm. Biopharm., 31(6), 199-202 (1992), and V.K.Thoma and Th. Zimmer, Pharm. Ind. 51(1), 98-101 (1989)]. The incorporation of an anionic polymer (for example sodium alginate) showing pH-dependent solubility in a 30     drug fonnulation which also comprises a neutral polymer, gave insoluble gelling properties at low pH, resulting in a strong diffusional barrier which was theorized to be the main<br><br>
mechanism retarding drug release at low pH. [US4792452; and P  Timmins et al. Pharmaceutical Development and Technology, 2(1), 25-31 (1997)]. Other methods have involved employing charged polymers to influence drug release by either ionically interacting with the drug [see C. Caramella et al Pharm. Res. 14(11), 531 (1997), H.Y. Park et al Drug Delivery, 5 13-18 (1998), N. Caram-Lelham, Ph.D. thesis, Uppsala University (1996)] or by influencing the gelling and swelling properties of these polymers [see KJVI. Picker, Drug Dev. and Ihd. Pharmacy, 25(3) 339-346 (1999)]. The formulations used here were generally based on one type of polymer.<br>
Baveja et al, Int J Pharmaceutics 39, 39-45 (1987) discloses that when a nonionic polymer (HPMC) is mixed with an anionic polymer (NaCMC) release is retarded. Ranga Rao et al, Drug Dev Ind Pharmacy, 14, 2299 (1988) disclose mixtures of methyl cellulose and NaCMC to give different release profiles. Mixtures of lambda-carrageenan and active ingredient are disclosed in WO 99/21586.<br>
Combinations of strategies to give a pH-independent release profile have been reported [see WO 96/26717, WO 99/29305 and WO 99/39698]. All-three of these disclose a three component matrix formulation comprising three polymers with typically different aqueous solubility and swelling properties, the composition of which may be varied, with adjustment of these properties, to give adjustable release rates. Two of the components involve a gelling polymer with significant pH-dependent solubility such as sodium alginate, and a gelling polymer with low or insignificant pH-dependent solubility, such as hydroxy propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC) or polyethylene oxide. The third component involves either an enteric coating polymer, such as fnethacrylic acid copolymer (WO 96/26717); EUDRAGIT® L or S, which are specific types of methacrylic acid polymers, (WO 99/29305); or a water insoluble polymer, such as ethyl cellulose (WO 99/39698). However, these strategies, have not, in general, specifically targeted basic drugs, and have depended on enteric coat-type or water insoluble polymers, such as a methaerylic acid polymer, or a pH-dependent gelling polymer, such as sodium alginate, to retard drug release at low pH environments, at least in some part.<br>
The present invention provides an oral pharmaceutical formulation comprising iota-carrageenan, one or more neutral gelling polymers and a basic pharmaceutically active ingredient; which formulation inhibits the release of the basic pharmaceutically active<br>
3<br><br>
ingredient from the formulation at acidic pH (preferably below pH 3; especially about pH<br>
1).<br>
Substantially pH independent release means that the release rate is significantly redarded at pH 1 and slightly increased or unaffected at pH 6.8 so that the amount of basic pharmaceutically active ingredient released at any one time becomes less p"H dependent.<br>
The present invention further provides an oral pharmaceutical formulation comprising iota-carrageenan, one or more neutral gelling polymers and a basic pharmaceutically active ingredient.<br>
Iota-carrageenan is, preferably, present in the formulation of the invention at a level of more that 15% by weight The iota-carrageenan is preferably of natural origin. One type of pharmaceutical grade iota-carrageenan (available from FMC Biopolymer) has a viscosity of not less than 5 centipoise (cps), preferably in the range 5-10 cps (for a 1.5% solution warmed to 82°C, after which the viscosity is measured at 75°C with aBrookfield LV viscometer fitted with a #1 spindle running at a speed of 30rpm). A type of technical grade iota-carrageenan (available from Fluka Biochemica) preferably has a viscosity of not less than 14 mPa.s, for a 0.3 % aqueous solution warmed to 20°C, after which the viscosity is measured using a fallingball viscometer, of type Haake, used together with a Lauda thermostat C3 and Hakke Mess-System HI, and using gold-coated stainless steel balls of density 7.8 g/cm3.<br>
The neutral gelling polymer is a single, or a mixture of more than one, neutral erodable polymer(s) having gelling properties and having substantially pH-independent solubility. The neutral gelling polymer is, preferably, present in the formulation at a level of more that 10% but preferably more than 20% by weight. {"Erodable" and "erosion" refer to dissolution or disintegration either alone or in combination. Dissolution can be enhanced by mixing and disintegration can be enhanced by mechanical interaction with solid matter.}<br>
Suitable neutral gelling polymers include polyethylene oxide (PEO), derivatives and members of the PEO family (for example, polyethylene glycol (PEG), preferably existing naturally in the solid state, of suitable molecular weight or viscosity). Thus the neutral gelling polymer is, for example, a polyethylene oxide or polyethylene glycol.<br>
If used as a single neutral gelling polymer, a PEO preferably has a MW of &gt; 4 million (4M) (for example aMW of 4 to 8 million), corresponding to an aqueous solution<br><br>
viscosity range of 1650-5500 mPa.s (or 1650-5500 cps; measured for a 1 % aqueous solution at 25°C, using a Brookfield RVF viscometer, with No. 2 spindle, at 2 rpm). Other examples of suitable PEOs include a PEO of MW around 5 million (5M), corresponding to an aqueous solution viscosity range of 5500 - 7500 mPa.s, or a PEO MW around 8 million (8M), corresponding to-an aqueous solution viscosity range of 10000-15000 mPa.s. This range covers the value for typical solution viscosity (in cps) measured at 25°C, quoted for this polymer, in the USP 24/NF 19, 2000 edition, pp. 2285-2286. Thus, PEO can have a MW of 4-8 million.<br>
If PEG is used as a single neutral gelling polymer it preferably has a high molecular weight, for example, a MW of around 20000, corresponding to a.viscosity range of 2700-3500 mPa.s (or 2700-3500 cps), measured using a 50% aqueous solution (w/w) at 20°C, using a capillary viscometer (Ubbelohde or equivalent). [Ref: European Pharmacopoeia 3rd Ed., 2000, Supplement, pp. 908-909.]<br>
Other suitable gelling polymers include cellulose derivatives such as hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose (HPMC) or hydroxyethylcelhilose (HEC) (but preferably HPMC) with suitably high viscosities (for example "HPMC 10000 cps", "HPMC 15000 , cps", "HEC type HH" or "HEC type H"). When used as a single neutral polymer, hydroxypropylmethyl cellulose polymers like "HPMC 10000 cps" and "HPMC 15000 cps" have, respectively, apparent viscosities of 7500-14000 mPa.s (or 7500 -14000 cps), and 11250-21000 mPa.s (or 11250-21000 cps), when measured at 20°C with a 2% (w/w) aqueous solution, calculated with reference to the dried substance, using a capillary viscometer (Ubbelohde or equivalent). One type of hydroxyethylcelhilose polymer, for example, "Natrosol 250 Pharma, type HH", from Hercules Incorporated (Aqualon), shows typically a Brookfield viscosity of about 20,000 mPa.s using a Brookfield Synchro-Lectric Model LVF instrument, at the conditions 1% solution concentration, spindle no. 4, spindle speed 30 rpm, factor 200, 25°C (See Natrosol Physical and Chemical Properties booklet, 33.007-E6(1993),p.21).<br>
When a mixture of neutral gelling polymers is used the mixture can, for example, comprise a mixture or blend of two or more PEOs, two or more HPMCs, a PEO and an " HPMC or a PEO and a PEG. For example, a PEO of MW 4, 5 or 8 million could be blended with a PEO of MW 1 million, a PEO of MW 400,000, a PEO of MW 100,000 or a PEG of MW 6000.<br>
5<br><br>
Alternatively, a neutral gelling polymer (for example a PEO) can be used in combination with a non-gelling neutral polymer (such as a low MW PEG, for example a PEG having a MW below 10000). Examples of low MW PEGs in such a combination include a PEG of MW 8000 (corresponding to a viscosity range of 260-510 mPa.s) or a PEG of MW 6000 (corresponding to a viscosity range of 200-270 mPa.s).<br>
A mixture or blend of two or more HPMC grades can include both lower viscosity (non-gelling) and higher viscosity (gelling) grades. For example, "HPMC 50 cps", "HPMC 15 cps" and "HPMC 6 cps", having, respectively, apparent viscosities of 40-60 mPa.s, 11.3-21.0 mPa_s and 4.8-7.2 mPa.s, according to the method earlier defined above, can be used as blends with "HPMC 10000 cps" or "HPMC 15000 cps".<br>
A blend of two or more polymers of the same kind but of different MWs gives better erosion control when the formulation of the invention is in tablet form. When used alone or in a mixture, the higher the MW of PEO used, the less of this polymer is required to make a formulation according to the invention.<br>
The exact formulation of the invention is dependent on the molecular weight and molecular weight distribution of the gelling polymer chosen, as well as the quality of each of the polymers employed.<br>
In one aspect of the invention the neutral gelling polymer is a PEO of MW of about 4 million or more, a PEG of MW of about 20000 or more, or a cellulose derivative having an apparent viscosity of about 7500 cps or more (measured as above).<br>
The ratio of neutral gelling polymer (for example PEO, PEG or HPMC; especially PEO or HPMC; or mixture there of with each other or of 2 or more PEO or HPMC) to iota-carrageenan is preferably in the range 20:80 to 80:20 (especially about 40:60 to 60:40, for example about 50:50).<br>
Basic pharmaceutically active ingredients have one or more basic groups having a pKa preferably from 1 to 12 (for example from 1 to 10 (especially from 1 to 7)), and optionally also having one or more basic groups having a pKa of more than 10. Thus, the basic pharmaceutically active ingredient may possess one or more pKa values but at least one is, preferably, from 1 to 12 (for example from 1 to 10 (especially from 1 to 7)). Examples of basic groups in these basic pharmaceutically active ingredients having pKa"s of from 1 to 12 (for example from 1 to 10) include hydroxyamidines, secondary or tertiary amines, or primary and secondary amides.<br><br>
Suitable basic pharmaceutically active ingredients preferably have low to medium aqueous solubility (for example an aqueous solubility of up to 50 mg/ml (especially 0.001 to 20mg/ml) at 25°C and at pH 7,0), and are positively charged with one or more positive charges (depending on the number and pKa of the basic groups in the pharmaceutically active ingredient) at low pH (for example pH 1 to 6 (especially pH 1 to 2)).<br>
A suitable basic pharmaceutically active ingredient is, for example, a compound having cardiovascular activity (such as a peptide, or peptide like, thrombin inhibitor). Peptide uirombin inhibitors have a molecular weight below 1000, have 1, 2,3 or 4 peptide linkages and show pH dependent solubility. They include the peptide thrombin inhibitors (and prodrugs therefore) described generically, and more specifically, in the review paper by Claesson in Blood Coagul. Fibrin. 5,411, (1994), as well as those disclosed in US Patent No. 4,346,078; International Patent Applications WO 97/23499, WO 97/02284, W097/46577, WO 98/01422, WO 93/05069, W093/11152, WO 95/23609, WO95/35309, WO 96/25426, WO 94/29336, WO 93/18060 and WO 95/01168; and European Patent Publication nos. 623 596, 648 780,468 231, 559 046, 641 779, 185 390, 526 877, 542 525, 195 212, 362 002, 364 344, 530 167, 293 881, 686 642, 669 317 and 601 459. Peptide thrombin inhibitors (or prodrugs therefore) especially include inogatran, melagatran {HOOC-CH2-RCgl-Aze-Pab-H; Glycine, N-[2-[2-[[[[4 (aminoimiiiornethyl)phenyl]-methyI]amino]carbonyl]-l-azetidinyl]-l-cyclohexyl-2-oxoethyl]-, [2R-[2S]]-)} and H376/95 {ximelagatran; Et02C-CH2-RCgl-Aze-Pab-OH; see Example 17 of WO 97/23499; Glycine, N-[l-cyclohexyl-2-[24[[[4-[(hydroxyirnino)aminomethyI]-phenyl]methyl]amino]carbonyl]-l-azetidinyl]-2-oxoethyl]-, ethyl ester, [S-(R*, S*)]~}. In another aspect peptide thrombin inhibitors (or prodrugs therefore) include<br><br><br><br>
Compound G can be prepared by methods similar to those described below for the preparation of Compounds F and H.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a pharmaceutical formulation wherein the basic, pharmaceutically active ingredient is:<br>
1.	4-({3-[7-(3,3-dimethyI"2-oxobutyI)-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]non-3-yl]propyI}amino)benzonitrile (which compound is referred to hereinafter as Compound 3);<br>
2.	tert-butyl 2-{7-[3-(4-cyanoanilino)propyl]-9-oxa-3J7-diazabicyclo-[3.3.l]non-3-yl} ethylcarbamate;<br>
3.	rerr-butyl2-{7-[4-(4~cyanophenyl)butyl]-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo-[3.3.13non-3-yljethylcarbamate; or<br>
4.	ferr-butyl2-{7-[(25)-3-(4-cyanophenoxy)-2-hydroxypropyl]-9-oxa-3,7-diazabicyclo[3.3.1]non~3-yl}ethylcarbamate (which compound is referred to hereinafter as Compound C);<br>
these compounds having been described in WO 01/28992.<br>
In a further aspect the basic pharmaceutically active ingredient is metoprolol or a salt thereof (such as a succinate or tartrate thereof).<br>
The formulation of the present invention can include: a processing additive, stabiliser, plasticiser, colourant, lubricant (such as sodium stearyl fumarate), binder, filler or surfactant, or other excipient normally used in a pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
In one particular aspect the formulation of the present invention includes a lubricant  (such as sodium stearyl fumarate).<br>
In another aspect of the present invention the molar ratio of iota-carrageenan to basic pharmaceutically active ingredient is in the range 3:1 to 1:3.<br>
In a further aspect the pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention comprises 15-80% iota-carrageenan.<br>
In another aspect the pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention comprises 15-80% of one or more neutral gelling polymers.<br>
In a further aspect the pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention comprises 1-50% of a. basic pharmaceutically active ingredient.<br><br>
In a still further aspect the pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention comprises 0-10% (especially 1-10%) of a processing additive, stabiliser, plasticiser, colourant, lubricant, binder or filler, or other excipient normally used in a pharmaceutical preparation.<br>
The mechanism behind the inhibition of the release of the basic pharmaceutical active ingredient from the formulation at acidic pH (especially the substantially pH-independent controlled release) is thought to be as follows. At low pH, the basic pharmaceutically active ingredient drug would be expected to have a relatively high solubility as it is in a strongly ionized state, and, therefore, would be expected to show a fast release profile from any neutral matrix. It is theorised that, at acidic pH and in the presence of iota-carrageenan, an ionic attraction exists between the negatively charged iota-carrageenan and the positively charged drug, which retards drug release and thus contributes towards a more constant release profile. At higher pH, when the pharmaceutical drug is less strongly ionized, or not ionised at all, and, therefore, would be expected to show a slow release profile from any neutral matrix, it is theorised that the ionic interaction proposed above is also less significant and the release profile is controlled predominantly by the combined swelling, gelling and erosion profiles of the neutral gelling polymer/s, and the anionic poymer, iota-carrageerjan, used in the formulation.<br>
The final swelling, gelling and erosion properties of the formulation of the invention are related to properties like the molecular weight, and molecular weight distribution of the gelling polymer/s, and the anionic polymer, and also related to the pH-dependent hydrolysis rate of the anionic polymer. Thus, different release rates for the basic pharmaceutically active ingredient may be obtained by adjusting the nature (for. example the molecular weight or molecular weight distribution) of the gelling polymer, the amount of iota-carrageenan present in the formulation and/or the ratio of gelling polymer to iota-carrageenan.<br>
The formulation of the present invention can be presented as a solid dosage form (such as a tablet, capsule, pellet or powder dispersed in a suitable container, or in the form of a multiple formulation (such as coated pellets administered in a tablet, capsule or sachet)).<br><br>
In one aspect the invention provides a tablet comprising 20-500mg (especially 40-60mg) of basic pharmaceutically active ingredient (such as H376/95; or Compound A, B or C).<br>
When the pharmaceutical formulation of the present invention is presented in a tablet the tablet is preferably made such that all the basic pharmaceutically active ingredient is released, in ionised or unionised form depending on the pH of each part of the gastrointestinal tract, over a period of about 20 hours, for example 18-22 hours (alternatively for 20 to 26 hours).<br>
In a still further aspect there is provided a process for preparing a formulation of the present invention comprising mixing iota-carrageenan, one or more neutral gelling polymers and a basic pharmaceutically active ingredient and, optionally compressing said mixture (preferably in the presence of a lubricant {such as sodium stearyl fumarate, sold under the trade name PRUV™}) to form a tablet.<br>
A tablet formulation can be prepared, for example, by a direct compression or a wet granulation technique.<br>
For the direct compression technique a basic pharmaceutically active ingredient is thoroughly mixed with a gelling polymer and iota-carrageenan and additional excipients as needed. A lubricant (such as sodium stearyl fumarate) is sieved and added to the iota-carageenan mixture followed by further mixing. The resulting mixture is then compressed into tablets.<br>

Tablets were manufactured by direct compression. The active ingredient, PEO 4M and iota-Carrageenan were mixed thoroughly and a lubricant, sodium stearyl fumarate, was added though a 0.7-mm sieve. Additional final mixing was done and the mixture was compressed with a 9 mm punch in a single-punch tablet press. The tablets were analysed in a dissolution bath, UPS H (50 rpm, 37°C, artificial media) containing 0.1 M HC1, pH 1, for two hours. Thereafter the tablets were moved to a dissolution bath with a 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8, and were further analysed. The results from the analysis are presented in Figure 1. The (50:50) formulation shows an essentially pH-independent release profile at a pH range between 1-6.8. It can additionally be concluded that when blending different ratios of the anionic polymer, iota-Carrageenan, and the neutral gelling polymer PEO 4 M, the release rate in media with different pH can be modified.<br>
Example 2 This Example shows die release of H376/95 from blends with composition ratio (20:80) of PEO with different molecular weight and iota-Carrageenan. Tablets were analysed for 2 hours at pH 1 and for the remaining time at pH 6.8.<br>

Tablets were manufactured and analysed according to Example 1. The results from the analysis are presented in Figure 2 and show that using higher molecular weight of the neutral gelling polymer gives a slower release rate in neutral pH. The release rate in the low pH region is not affected because there is a sufficient amount of anionic polymer included in the formulation.<br>

Tablets were prepared and analysed according to Example 1. Figure 3 shows how using a gelling polymer with higher molecular weight can decrease the release rate in neutral pH. At the same time the release-retarding effect in pH 1 is less distinct because a smaller amount of iota-Carrageenan is used, compared with the examples shown in Figure 2.<br>

Tablets were manufactured and analysed according to Example 1, The results from the analysis in different dissolution media are presented in Figure 4. The (50:50) formulation again shows an essentially pH-independent release profile at a pH range between 1-6,8. It can.be concluded that the release rate again can be modified by blending different ratios of various other neutral gelling polymers, in this case HPMC, 10 000 cps, with the anionic polymer, iota-Carrageenan.<br>

Tablets were manufactured through direct compression, according to Example 1. The analyses were made in dissolution baths (USP apparatus 2 with tablets positioned in a basket1 along the flow steam) where three tablets were analysed for 24 hours in each media, 0.1 M HQ and a 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 6.8 with 5% ethanol (EtOH), added to improve solubility of the drag.. The results, presented in Figure 5, clearly show that a tablet with a pH independent release profile can be made, when using a composition with equal parts of PEO, 4M and iota-Carrageenan.<br>

This Example shows the release of H376/95 from the neutral gelling polymer PEO 4M in the absence of iota-carrageenan and analysed in different artificial media.<br><br>
H376/95	50.5 mg<br>
Polyethylene oxide, 4 M	200.0 mg<br>
Sodium stearyl fumarate	2.5 mg<br>
Tablet weight	•253 mg<br>
Tablets were manufactured through direct compression, according to Example 1. Analyses were performed separately in different dissolution baths. The tablets in the vessels containing 0.1 M HC1 were analysed for 2 hours. When using 0.1 M phosphate buffer pH 6.8 as the dissolution media, the tablets were analysed for 20 hours. The results in Figure 6 show that the release rate in pH 1 is significantly greater than the release in pH 6.8, indicating that using the neutral polymer alone is not sufficient to give a pH independent release profile for a basic drag possessing a pH dependent solubility.<br>
Example 7<br>
This Example shows the release of H376/95 from the anionic polymer iota-Carrageenan in the absence of a neutral gelling polymer and analysed in different artificial media.<br>

Assessment of Cumulative Release of Compound A from Tablets of Examples 8 and 9 Two individual tablets were tested for drug release in 900ml media using a USP dissolution apparatus 2 (paddle+basketl) at 50 rpm and 37°C. The dissolution media used were 0.1M hydrochloric acid (pH 1) and 0.1M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 6.8) with 5% ethanol added to improve drug solubility. The addition of ethanol was verified to not significantly affect the rate of release of these compositions. In-line quantitation was performed using the C Technologies fibre optic system with with 235 nm as the analytical wavelength when 0.1 M HC1 was used as the dissolution media and with 250 nm as the analytical wavelength when modified phosphate buffer pH 6.8 was used as the dissolution media. 350 nm was used as the reference wavelength with both media.<br>
