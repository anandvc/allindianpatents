				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
IMAGE FORMING APPARATUS, IMAGE FORMING METHOD, RECORDING MEDIUM,<br>
AND PROGRAM<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an image forming apparatus,<br>
an image forming method, a recording medium, and a program.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Typically, an image forming apparatus<br>
(multi-function machine) , which has one or more of the functions<br>
of a printer, a facsimile machine, or a copier, forms images (image<br>
forming) by conveying a medium (hereinafter also referred to as<br>
"sheet" or "paper") and jetting a liquid (hereinafter also<br>
referred to as "recording liquid" or "i nk") onto the conveyed paper<br>
by using a liquid jetting apparatus having a recording head<br>
(including one or more liquid jet heads) from which liquid (ink)<br>
droplets are ejected (jetted) . It is to be noted that, although<br>
the medium is hereinafter referred to as "sheet" or "paper", the<br>
material of the medium is not to be limited only to those produced<br>
by manufacturing paper. The medium may include, for example, a<br>
paper material, a textile material, a fiber material, a fabric<br>
material, a leather material, a metal material, a plastic material,<br>
a glass material, a wood material, or a ceramic material. The<br>
medium may be, for example, a recording medium (recording paper)<br><br>
or a transfer material (transfer paper) . It is to be noted that<br>
"image forming" has substantially the same meaning as "recording"<br>
or "printing". For example, "image forming" includes forming<br>
images having meaning (e.g. characters, figures, symbols) and also<br>
image having no particular meaning (e.g. patterns) . Furthermore,<br>
the liquid used for an image forming apparatus is not limited to<br>
a recording liquid or ink and may be other kinds of liquid as long<br>
as images can be formed with the liquid. The image forming<br>
apparatus may include, for example, a serial type image forming<br>
apparatus which forms images by scanning a liquid jet head mounted<br>
on a carriage or a line type image forming apparatus having a line<br>
type liquid jet head.<br>
The serial type image forming apparatus has a printing<br>
speed which is determined according to conditions such as image<br>
resoluticn nozzle density , dot formation driving frequency and<br>
sub-scanning speed. Among such conditions, nozzle density is<br>
constrained by the precision in manufacturing the nozzles,- the<br>
liquid chamber, the flow path, and the actuator of the liquid jet<br>
head of the image forming apparatus. Particularly, in a case<br>
where a liquid jet head uses a piezoelectric element, the only<br>
ways to separately form channels corresponding to the nozzles of<br>
the liquid jet head are to use a mechanical method (e.g., dicing)<br>
or form a thin-film PZT by printing. Accordingly, the nozzle<br>
density is relatively low compared to a thermal type liquid jet<br>
head fabricated by a semiconductor process. The upper limit of<br><br>
nozzle density of the piezoelectric type liquid jet head is<br>
currently approximately 360 dpi.<br>
Meanwhile, in order to improve printing speed, it is<br>
preferable to form a printing area by scanning the liquid jet head<br>
in the main scanning direction in a single time. For example,<br>
in a case of forming an image with a resolution of 300 dpi in the<br>
sub-scanning direction by using a liquid jet head having a nozzle<br>
density of 300 dpi, it is possible to form the image by moving<br>
the liquid jet head in the main scanning direction in a single<br>
time. In a case of forming an image with a resolution of 600 dpi,<br>
the image is to be formed by using an interlace method (in this<br>
case, scanning two times in the main scanning direction and one<br>
time in the sub-scanning direction (sheet conveying direction) ) .<br>
Thus, it is apparent that the non-interlace method which forms<br>
an immage with a single scan has greater printing speed than the<br>
interlace method. Furthermore, as for methods of forming a single<br>
line in the main scanning direction, there are a single pass<br>
printing method that forms an image(s) by a single pass in the<br>
main scanning direction and a multi-pass printing method that<br>
forms an image (s) by plural passes in the main scanning direction.<br>
It is apparent that the single pass printing method has greater<br>
printing speed than the multi-pass printing method.<br>
However, in a case where an image is formed by using<br>
a single pass/non-interlace method, the resolution of the image<br>
is inevitably low. In order to improve image quality in a case<br><br>
where resolution of the image is low, it is effective to use<br>
multiple values (multi-values) for a single pixel. As for methods<br>
of using multi-values, there is, for example, a method of changing<br>
the size of a single dot, a method of forming a single pixel by<br>
jetting plural small dots, or a method of changing the density<br>
of ink.<br>
Although the method of acquiring high quality images<br>
by using multi-values is effective for images of pictures and<br>
photographs, no significant effects can be attained for images<br>
of graphics and characters (letters) . This is due to the graphics<br>
and characters requiring a dot size large enough to fill the<br>
background areas of an image, that is, characters or graphic images<br>
become low density when small size dots are used. Therefore,<br>
binary images such as character images/graphic images face<br>
inherent problems of low resolution Part icularly, in a case<br>
where characters (letters) are expressed with binary images, the<br>
quality of the characters deteriorates such that the characters<br>
become illegible.<br>
Besides a method of improving the nozzle density of<br>
a recording head for improving the resolution of the recording<br>
head, there is a method of assembling nozzles in a misaligned<br>
manner so that the apparent resolution will be improved. Both<br>
methods, however, cannot avoid the increase of manufacturing costs<br>
of the recording head. Furthermore, the improvement of<br>
resolution increases the workload for processing the image data<br><br>
and complicates the control system of the image forming apparatus,<br>
to thereby lead to an increase in the overall cost of the image<br>
forming apparatus. These problems become particularly<br>
noticeable for a recording head provided with an extended length<br>
for increasing printing speed. Furthermore, the problem of low<br>
resolution becomes more serious for a line printer since the line<br>
printer, unlike the serial printer, is unable to use the interlace<br>
method and the multi-pass method such that the printing resolution<br>
becomes fixed according to the nozzle resolution of the recording<br>
head.<br>
Accordingly, in order to obtain satisfactory images<br>
while maintaining low manufacturing costs and high speed printing,<br>
it is important to attain a satisfactory image quality within a<br>
limited recording head resolution.<br>
Next, the inherent low RESOLUTION problem is<br>
described in further detail. The images recorded by using a<br>
liquid jetting method are expressed by using dots formed in a<br>
matrix manner in a recording head scanning direction and in a sheet<br>
conveying direction that perpendicularly intersects the<br>
recording head scanning direction. In a case where a character<br>
(letter) is printed as a dot image, the quality of the character<br>
significantly differs depending on the resolution of the printed<br>
image. For example, in a case where a character of the same size<br>
is printed with 300 dpi and 600 dpi, the ratio in the number of<br>
dots comprising the character is approximately four times.<br><br>
Therefore, finer details can be expressed and character quality<br>
is higher by printing with 600 dpi. Particularly, in a case of<br>
expressing a diagonal part (slanted part) of a character, the<br>
number of dots increases/decreases in a stepwise manner according<br>
to resolution. Therefore, indentation (jaggy) becomes more<br>
noticeable when printing with 300 dpi.<br>
As a method of reducing the jaggy appearing at the<br>
outline upon low resolution printing, there is a smoothing method<br>
referred to as anti-aliasing. The anti-aliasing method can<br>
perform smoothing with high precision since an outline can be<br>
expressed by using dots of many tones (scales). However, the<br>
anti-aliasing method is very complicated and requires a large<br>
amount of processing time. Therefore, the anti-aliasing method<br>
is not suitable for recent image forming apparatuses (e.g., ink jet<br>
printer) that are expected to provide high throughput<br>
Accordingly, Japanese Registered Patent No. 2886192<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "Patent Document 1") discloses a<br>
method of comparing a bit pattern of a sample window in a character<br>
bitmap image and a predetermined bit pattern and correcting the<br>
main pixels in the sample window into small dots when the bit<br>
patterns match.<br>
Furthermore, Japanese Registered Patent No. 3029533<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "Patent Document 2") discloses a<br>
method of determining an outline part of an image from black dot<br>
data and reducing the size of printed dots other than edge dots<br><br>
and black dots.<br>
Furthermore, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application<br>
No. 2003-334938 (hereinafter referred to as "Patent Document 3")<br>
discloses a method of reducing jaggy at an outline part by changing<br>
the size of dots of the outline part according to the inclination<br>
of the outline and forming dots at a blank part surrounding the<br>
outline part.<br>
Furthermore, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application<br>
No. 2004-114303 (hereinafter referred to as "Patent Document 4")<br>
discloses a method of expressing a stepwise surrounding part of<br>
the dots forming an outline part of an image by using dots smaller<br>
than the dots forming the image.<br>
Furthermore, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application<br>
No. 2004-017552 (hereinafter referred to as "Patent Document 5")<br>
diauloses a method of performing a smoothing process using small<br>
dots when image data of a character or graphics is black and<br>
refraining from performing the smoothing process when the image<br>
data is not black.<br>
Furthermore, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application<br>
No. 2004-017546 (hereinafter referred to as "Patent Document 6")<br>
discloses a method of converting data so that dots of a stepwise<br>
surrounding part of the dots forming an outline part of a character<br>
or graphics are expressed as dots smaller than the dots other than<br>
those of the stepwise surrounding part and changing the data<br>
converting method according to the inclination of the outline<br><br>
part.<br>
.Furthermore, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application<br>
No. 2005-193384 (hereinafter referred to as "Patent Document 7")<br>
discloses a method including a step of detecting a stepwise<br>
changing part of dots forming an outline part of a character and/or<br>
graphics on which a half tone process is performed and a step of<br>
converting dot data of the dots surrounding the stepwise changing<br>
part detected in the detection step into dot data of dots having<br>
a size no greater than those of the stepwise changing part, wherein<br>
the converting method of the data conversion step is different<br>
depending on the inclination of the outline part.<br>
Furthermore, Japanese Laid-Open Patent Application<br>
No. 2002-166603 (hereinafter referred to as "Patent Document 8")<br>
discloses a method of obtaining the difference of density between<br>
designated pixels forming a target printing character and pixels<br>
surrounding the designated pixels, determining that the<br>
designated pixels are pixels of the outline part of the character<br>
when there are predetermined number of pixels having greater<br>
density with respect to the predetermined pixels, and coloring<br>
the determined designated pixels with a black color member<br>
comprising a mixture of a cyan, magenta, and yellow color members.<br>
Furthermore, Japanese Registered Patent No. 3244411<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "Patent Document 9" discloses a method<br>
including a binary character image-data generation step for<br>
generating binary character image data by setting the output<br><br>
concentration in a pixel used as the inside of a profile<br>
configuration as a 1st concentration when the profile<br>
configuration concerned is drawn based on the outline data<br>
corresponding to the profile configuration of the character which<br>
should be output on the pixel coordinates that specify the pixel<br>
of an output unit and setting the output concentration in the pixel<br>
used as the outside of the profile configuration as a 2nd<br>
concentration different from said 1st concentration, an auxiliary<br>
line data extraction step for extracting the partial borderline<br>
which fulfills predetermined conditions as auxiliary line data<br>
from one or more partial border lines which constitute the outline<br>
data; a gradation image-data generation step for generating<br>
gradation image data by setting the output concentration of the<br>
pixel having a positional relationship fulfilling a predetermined<br>
criteria with respect to the drawn partial borderline as the 3rd<br>
concentration existing in the middle of the 1st and 2nd<br>
concentration when the partial borderline corresponding to the<br>
auxiliary line data is drawn on the pixel coordinate, and a<br>
compositing step for generating a character image data by<br>
compositing binary character image data and gradation image data.<br>
The methods disclosed in Patent Documents 1 and 2 are<br>
effective for LED printers and laser printers . Since the particle<br>
diameter of the toner used by the LED printers and laser printers<br>
is no greater than 10 μm, the LED printers and laser printers<br>
hardly exhibit ink spreading on plain paper and are able to form<br><br>
small dots as designated. Furthermore, the LED printers and laser<br>
printers can form dots of designated sizes at optimum locations<br>
by slightly adjusting the laser irradiation position and the laser<br>
irradiation length.<br>
However, a liquid jet type image forming apparatus<br>
exhibits greater ink spreading compared to a laser printer.<br>
Furthermore, since the liquid jet type image forming apparatus,<br>
which changes dot size by modifying the number or length of the<br>
drive pulses in a drive period, requires more time to form dots<br>
compared to LED printers and laser printers, it is difficult for<br>
the liquid jet type image forming apparatus to change the dot size<br>
into many different types. That is, the liquid jet type image<br>
forming apparatus can change dots to only a few different sizes.<br>
Due to a similar reason, the dots of the liquid jet type image<br>
forming apparatus arc formed in a substantially fixed location<br>
(position) inside a single pixel. That is, unlike the LED printer<br>
or the laser printer, it is difficult for the liquid jet type image<br>
forming apparatus to freely change the dot formation location<br>
(position) inside a single pixel.<br>
As described above, although there are various<br>
methods for performing outline correction by using dots of<br>
different sizes, the sizes of the dots are limited to more or less<br>
than three types even for a multi-value printer capable of forming<br>
dots of different sizes'. Furthermore, the types of dot size that<br>
can be used for correction could be further limited depending on,<br><br>
for example, character correction, covered area of the medium<br>
(paper), or gradation property. Furthermore, since dots are<br>
formed at the center of (the address of) each pixel determined<br>
by printing resolution, correction might not be satisfactorily<br>
achieved. Moreover, in a case where small dots are used for<br>
reducing brightness, spaces are easily formed between the<br>
character framework and the correcting dot. Such space or<br>
deviation may degrade the quality of a character.<br>
Furthermore, although outline correction can be<br>
performed by changing density with use of composite black, the<br>
amount of ink adhered on a single pixel increases due to composite<br>
black being created by blending cyan (C) , magenta (M), and yellow<br>
(Y) ink. This causes bleeding of ink, particularly, when plain<br>
paper is used and results to degradation of image quality.<br>
Furthermore, the increase in the amount of ink also increases the<br>
time required for drying (reduction of productivity) and also<br>
raises ink cost. Furthermore, undesired color areas may be formed<br>
in a case where a target impact position for one color ink deviates<br>
from a target impact position of another color ink. This also<br>
becomes a cause for degrading the quality of a character. Since<br>
the kinds of ink that can be mounted in a typical inkjet recording<br>
apparatus are approximately four to eight colors, the color that<br>
can express black is generally limited to K (K pigment, K dye,<br>
or light black) and a CMY composite. Therefore, little variation<br>
can be made in the density of ink. In addition, correction of<br><br>
color characters is difficult (similar color ink of different<br>
density is required).<br>
From another aspect, although the above-described<br>
Patent Document 3 discloses an inkjet recording method capable<br>
of reducing jaggy by changing dot size, the changing of dot sizes<br>
may cause dots to be formed at undesired positions on a medium.<br>
This problem is described in detail below.<br>
A liquid jet head used in a liquid jet type image<br>
forming apparatus includes a pressure generating part for applying<br>
pressure to a liquid (ink) inside a liquid chamber. For example,<br>
the pressure generating part may be a thermal type head using a<br>
thermal type head which uses a heating resistor for generating<br>
bubbles or a piezoelectric type head which uses a piezoelectric<br>
element (electromechanical transducer) for changing the wall of<br>
the "liquid chamber. In oder to chage the dot diameter, it is<br>
common to use a method of changing the energy applied to the<br>
pressure generating part. For example, this method may be<br>
changing the driving voltage of the pressure generating part,<br>
changing the pulse width of the drive pulse, or changing the pulse<br>
number of the drive pulse.<br>
Among these methods, the method of changing the drive<br>
voltage requires different signals corresponding to different<br>
drive voltages and plural switching parts for selectively<br>
switching for each channel corresponding to different drive<br>
voltages. Thereby, the driving element (driver IC) becomes<br><br>
larger in correspondence with the increase in the types of drive<br>
voltages. In a case of controlling (changing) pulse width or<br>
number of pulses, the pulse width and number of pulses can be<br>
changed by controlling the switching part based on time. In this<br>
case, a single switching part for each channel would be needed.<br>
Such pulse width modulation method or pulse number modulation<br>
method are used particularly by an image forming apparatus using<br>
a piezoelectric head.<br>
However, the amount of ink differs depending on the<br>
pulse width modulation method or the pulse number modulation<br>
method. That is, in forming ink droplets having different dot<br>
diameter, since the length of the drive pulse is different, the<br>
timing for jetting ink droplets (jet upon end of drive pulse) in<br>
accordance with the drive pulse is different even if the timing<br>
of the start of the rise of the meniscus is the same upon input<br>
of the drive pulse. Accordingly, the time for the droplets to<br>
reach the medium surface is different- As a result, the dot<br>
formation area on the medium differs depending on the dot size.<br>
Thus, even in a case of attempting to improve image quality by<br>
replacing (correcting) the dots at the outline part with small<br>
dots, it is difficult to provide satisfactory images since the<br>
small dots cannot be formed at desired areas of the medium.<br>
Furthermore, the deviation of dot formation position is also<br>
caused by viscosity resistance of ink due to ambient conditions<br>
(e.g., temperature, humidity). Furthermore, the deviation of dot<br><br>
formation location differs depending on image formation<br>
conditions (e.g., type of paper, resolution).<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is described in detail based<br>
on the embodiments illustrated in the drawings.<br>
First, an exemplary image forming apparatus 1000 is<br>
below with reference to Figs. 1 and 2, where Fig. 1 is a side view<br>
and Fig. 2 is a plan view of the image forming apparatus 1000.<br>
The illustrated image forming apparatus 1000 has<br><br>
guide members including a guide rod 1 and a guide rail 2. The<br>
guide rod 1 and the guide rail 2 are mounted in traversed positions<br>
between left and right side boards (not shown) of the image forming<br>
apparatus. The guide rod 1 and the guide rail 2 hold a carriage<br>
3 so that the carriage 3 can slide in the main scanning direction.<br>
Amain scanning motor 4 drives the sliding movement of the carriage<br>
3 via a timing belt 5 stretched between a driving pulley 6A and<br>
a driven pulley 6B. Thereby, the carriage 3 is able to travel<br>
(scan) in the arrow directions shown in Fig.2 (main scanning<br>
direction).<br>
The carriage 3 has a recording head (liquid jetting<br>
head) 7 including, for example, four recording head parts 7y, 7c,<br>
7m, and 7k for jetting ink droplets of yellow (Y) , cyan (C) , magenta<br>
(M), and black (K) , respectively. The recording head 7 having<br>
plural ink jetting holes aligned in a direction perpendicular to<br>
the main scanning direction is attached to the carriage 3 so that<br>
ink droplets can be jetted downward therefrom.<br>
The recording head 7 may include a pressure generating<br>
part that generates pressure used for jetting ink droplets from<br>
the recording head 7 . For example, the pressure generating part<br>
may be a thermal actuator which utilizes the pressure changes of<br>
ink boiled by an electric heat converting element (e.g. heating<br>
resistor), a shape-memory alloy actuator which utilizes the<br>
changes of shape of an alloy in accordance with temperature, or<br>
an electrostatic actuator utilizing static electricity.<br><br>
Furthermore, the recording head 7 is not limited to<br>
having plural recording head parts corresponding to each color.<br>
For example, the recording head 7 may have plural ink jetting<br>
nozzles for jetting ink of plural colors.<br>
The carriage 3 also has a sub-tank 8 for supplying<br>
ink of each color to the recording head 7. The sub-tank 8 is<br>
supplied with ink from a main tank (i.e. ink cartridge, not shown)<br>
via an ink supplying tube(s) 9.<br>
The image forming apparatus also includes a sheet<br>
feeding portion for feeding sheets of paper 12 stacked on a sheet<br>
stacking part 11 of a sheet feed cassette 10. The sheet feeding<br>
portion includes a separating pad 14 having a friction coefficient<br>
sufficient for separating sheets of paper 12 from the sheet<br>
stacking part and a sheet feeding roller 13 (in this example, a<br>
half moon shaped roller) for conveying the sheets of paper 12 one<br>
at a time from the sheet stacking part 11. The separating pad<br>
14 is configured to urge the sheets in the direction toward the<br>
sheet feeding roller 13.<br>
The paper 12 conveyed from the sheet feeding part is<br>
conveyed to an area below the recording head 7. In order to convey<br>
the paper 12 to the area below the recording head 7, the image<br>
forming apparatus is provided with a conveyor belt 21 that conveys<br>
the paper 12 by attracting the paper 12 with electrostatic force;<br>
a counter roller 22 and the conveyor belt 21 having the paper 12<br>
delivered inbetween after receiving the paper 12 conveyed from<br><br>
the sheet feeding part via a guide 15; a conveyor belt guide 23<br>
for placing the paper 12 flat on the conveyor belt 21 by changing<br>
the orientation of the paper 12 conveyed in a substantially upright<br>
(perpendicular) position by an angle of approximately 90 degrees;<br>
and a pressing member 24 for pressing a pressing roller 25 against<br>
the conveyor belt 21. Furthermore, the image forming apparatus<br>
includes a charging roller (charging part) 26 for charging the<br>
surface of the conveyor belt 21.<br>
In this example, the conveyor belt 21 is an endless<br>
belt stretched between a conveyor roller 27 and a tension roller<br>
28. A sub-scanning motor 31 rotates the conveyor roller 27 via<br>
a timing belt 21 and a timing roller 33 so that the conveyor belt<br>
21 is rotated in the belt conveying direction shown in Fig.2<br>
(sub-scanning direction). It is to be noted that a guide member<br>
29 is positioned at the backside of the conveyor belt 21 in<br>
correspondence with a target image forming area of the recording<br>
head 7. Furthermore,- the charging roller 26 is positioned<br>
contacting the top surface of the conveyor belt 21 so that the<br>
charging roller 26 rotates in accordance with the rotation of the<br>
conveyor belt 21.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the image forming apparatus also<br>
includes a rotary encoder 36. The rotary encoder 36 includes a<br>
slit disk 34 attached to a rotary shaft of the conveyor roller<br>
27 and a sensor 35 for detecting a slit(s) formed in the slit disk<br>
34.<br><br>
The image forming apparatus also includes a sheet<br>
discharging portion for discharging the sheet of paper 12 onto<br>
which data are recorded by the recording head 7. The sheet<br>
discharging portion includes a separating claw 51 for separating<br>
the paper 12 from the conveyor belt 21, a first sheet discharging<br>
roller 53, a second sheet discharging roller 53, and a sheet<br>
discharge tray 54 for stacking the paper(s) 12 thereon.<br>
Furthermore, a double-side sheet feeding unit (not<br>
shown) may be detachably attached to a rear portion of the image<br>
forming apparatus. By rotating the conveyor belt in the reverse<br>
direction, the paper 12 is delivered to the double-side sheet<br>
feeding unit so as to have the paper 12 flipped upside down. Then,<br>
the flipped paper 12 is conveyed back to the part between the<br>
counter roller 22 and the conveyor belt 21.<br>
Furthermore, as shown in Fig.2, a nozzle recovery<br>
mechanism 56 for maintaining/restoring the operating status of<br>
the nozzle (s) may be provided at a non-printing area toward one<br>
side (in this example, toward the back side) of the main scanning<br>
direction of the carriage 3.<br>
The nozzle recovery mechanism 56 includes, for<br>
example, plural caps 57 for covering the surface of each of the<br>
nozzles of the recording head 7, a wiper blade 58 for wiping off<br>
residual ink from the surface of the nozzles, and an ink receptacle<br>
59 for receiving accumulated ink that is jetted in a process of<br>
disposing of undesired ink.<br><br>
Accordingly, with the image forming apparatus having<br>
the above-described configuration, sheets of paper 12 are<br>
separated and conveyed sheet by sheet from the sheet feeding part,<br>
then the separated conveyed paper 12 is guided to the part between<br>
the conveyor belt 21 and the counter roller 22 in an upright manner<br>
by the guide 15, and then the orientation of the conveyed paper<br>
is changed approximately 90 degrees by guiding the tip part of<br>
the paper with the conveyor guide 23 and pressing the paper 12<br>
against the conveyor belt 21 with the pressing roller 25.<br>
In this conveying operation, an AC bias supplying part<br>
of a control part (not shown) of the image forming apparatus<br>
alternately applies negative and positive alternate voltages to<br>
the charging roller 26 in accordance with an alternate charging<br>
pattern. Thereby, the conveyor belt 21 is alternately charged<br>
with negative and positive voltages at intervals of a<br>
predetermined width in accordance with the alternate charging<br>
pattern. When the paper 12 is conveyed onto the charged conveyor<br>
belt 21, the paper 12 is attracted to the conveyor belt 21 by<br>
electrostatic force. Thus held, the paper 12 is conveyed in the<br>
sub-scanning direction by the rotation of the conveyor belt 21.<br>
Then, the recording head 7 jets ink droplets onto the<br>
paper 12 while the paper 12 is being moved in correspondence with<br>
the forward and backward movement of the carriage 3. After the<br>
recording head 7 records (prints) a single row by jetting ink in<br>
accordance with image signals, the paper 12 is further conveyed<br><br>
a predetermined distance for recording the next row. The<br>
recording operation of the recording head 7 is completed when a<br>
signal is received indicative of the completion of the recording<br>
operation or indicative of the rear end of the paper 12 reaching<br>
the edge of the recording area. After the completion of the<br>
recording operation, the paper is discharged to the discharge tray<br>
54.<br>
In a case of conducting double side printing, the<br>
paper 12 is flipped upside down after the recording of the front<br>
side (the side which is printed first) of the paper 12 is completed.<br>
The paper 12 is flipped so that the back side of the paper is the<br>
printing surface by rotating the conveyor belt 21 in reverse and<br>
delivering the paper 12 to the double side sheet feeding unit (not<br>
shown) . Then, the flipped paper 12 is conveyed to the part between<br>
the counter roller 22 and the conveyor belt 21. After the paper<br>
12 is placed on the conveyor belt 21, the recording head 7 conducts<br>
the above-described recording operation on the back side of the<br>
paper 12. After the recording operation is completed, the paper<br>
12 is discharged to the discharge tray 54.<br>
In a case where the image forming apparatus is<br>
standing by to conduct a printing (recording) operation, the<br>
carriage 3 is moved toward the recovery mechanism 56. The cap<br>
57 covers the nozzle side of the recording head 7 to keep the<br>
nozzles moist. This prevents poor jetting performance caused by<br>
dried ink. Furthermore, where the cap covers the nozzle side of<br><br>
the recording head 7, a recovery operation may be performed by<br>
suctioning accumulated viscous ink (recording liquid) from the<br>
nozzles and ejecting the ink and bubbles. Then, the wiper blade<br>
58 wipes off the ink that has adhered to the nozzle side of the<br>
recording head 7 during the recovery operation. Furthermore, an<br>
empty jetting (idling) operation that is irrelevant to a printing<br>
operation may be performed in which ink is jetted, for example,<br>
prior to a recording operation or during the recording operation.<br>
Next, an example of a recording head part included<br>
in the recording head 7 is described with reference to Figs. 3 and<br>
4 . Fig. 3 is a cross-sectional view along a longitudinal direction<br>
of a liquid chamber of the recording head 7. Fig.4 is a<br>
cross-sectional view along a lateral direction of the liquid<br>
chamber of the recording head 7.<br>
The recording head 7 includes a layered structure<br>
formed by bonding together a flow plate 101 (for example, formed<br>
by performing anisotropic etching on a single crystal silicon<br>
substrate), a vibration plate 102 (for example, formed by<br>
performing electroforming on a nickel plate) provided on a lower<br>
surface of the flow plate 101, and a nozzle communication path<br>
103 provided on an upper surface of the flow plate 101. This<br>
layered structure is formed with, for example, a nozzle<br>
communication path 105 in flow communication with the nozzle (s)<br>
104 of the recording head 7, a liquid chamber 106 serving as a<br>
pressure generating chamber, a common liquid chamber 108 for<br><br>
supplying ink to the liquid chamber 106 via a fluid resistance<br>
part (supply path) 107, and an ink supply port 109 in flow<br>
communication with the common liquid chamber 108.<br>
Furthermore, the recording head 7 includes two rows<br>
(although only one row is illustrated in Fig.3) of layered<br>
structure type piezoelectric elements (also referred to as<br>
"pressure generating part" or "actuator part") 121 for applying<br>
pressure to the ink inside the liquid chamber 106 by deforming<br>
the vibration plate 102, and a base substrate 122 affixed to the<br>
piezoelectric elements 121. It is to be noted that plural pillar<br>
parts 123 are formed in-between the piezoelectric elements 121.<br>
Although the pillar parts 123 are formed at the same time of forming<br>
the piezoelectric elements 121 when cutting a base material of<br>
the piezoelectric element 121, the pillar parts 123 simply become<br>
normal pillars since no drive voltage is applied thereto.<br>
Furthermore, the piezoelectric element 121 is<br>
connected to an FPC cable 12 6 on which a driving circuit (driving<br>
IC, not shown) is mounted.<br>
The peripheral portions of the vibration plate 102A<br>
are bonded to a frame member 130. The frame member 130 is<br>
fabricated to form a void portion 131 for installing an actuator<br>
unit (including, for example, the piezoelectric element 121, the<br>
base substrate 122) therein, a concave part including the common<br>
liquid chamber 108, and an ink supply hole 132 for supplying ink<br>
from the outside to the common liquid chamber 108. The frame<br><br>
member 130 is fabricated by injection molding with use of, for<br>
example, a thermal setting resin (e.g. epoxy type resin) or<br>
polyphenylene sulfate.<br>
The flow plate 101 is fabricated to form various<br>
concave parts and hole parts including the nozzle communication<br>
path 105 and the liquid chamber 106. The flow plate 101 is<br>
fabricated, for example, by using an anisotropic etching method<br>
in which an alkali type etching liquid (e.g. potassium hydroxide,<br>
KOH) is applied to a single crystal silicon substrate having a<br>
crystal plane orientation of (110). It is however to be noted<br>
that other materials may be used for fabricating the flow substrate<br>
101 besides a single crystal silicon substrate. For example, a<br>
stainless steel substrate or a photosensitive resin may also be<br>
used.<br>
The vibration plate 102 is fabrication, from example<br>
by performing an electroforming method on a metal plate formed<br>
of nickel. It is however to be noted that other metal plates or<br>
a bonded member formed by bonding together a metal plate and a<br>
resin plate may also be used. The piezoelectric elements 121 and<br>
the pillar parts 123, and the frame member 130 are bonded to the<br>
vibration plate 102 by using an adhesive agent.<br>
The nozzle plate 103 is formed with nozzles 104 having<br>
diameters ranging from 10 urn - 30 μm in correspondence with the<br>
sizes of respective liquid chambers 106. The nozzle plate 103<br>
is bonded to the flow plate 101 by using an adhesive agent. The<br><br>
nozzle plate 103 includes, for example, a metal material member<br>
having a water repellent layer formed on its outermost surface.<br>
The piezoelectric element (in this example, PZT) 121<br>
has a layered structure in which piezoelectric material 151 and<br>
internal electrodes 152 are alternately layered on top of one<br>
another. The internal electrodes 152, which are alternately<br>
extended to the side edge planes of the piezoelectric element 121,<br>
are connected to an independent electrode 153 and a common<br>
electrode 154. In this example, the pressure is applied to the<br>
ink in the liquid chamber 106 by using a piezoelectric constant<br>
d33 material for the piezoelectric material 151. It is however<br>
to be noted that pressure may also be applied to the ink in the<br>
liquid chamber 106 by using a piezoelectric constant d31 material<br>
for the piezoelectric material 151. Furthermore, a single row<br>
of piezoelectric elements 121 may be provided in correspondence<br>
with a single base substrate 121.<br>
Accordingly, in a case of jetting ink (recording<br>
liquid) from the nozzles 104 of the above-described recording head<br>
7, the piezoelectric element 121 is contracted by lowering the<br>
voltage applied to the piezoelectric element 121 to a voltage below<br>
a reference electric potential. Thereby, the volume of the liquid<br>
chamber 106 increases as the vibration plate 102 is lowered in<br>
correspondence with the contraction of the piezoelectric element<br>
121. Then, ink flows into the liquid chamber 106. Then, the<br>
voltage applied to the piezoelectric element is raised so that<br><br>
the piezoelectric element 121 expands in the layered direction<br>
of the piezoelectric element 121. Thereby, the volume of the<br>
liquid chamber 106 decreases as the vibration plate 102 deforms<br>
in a manner protruding toward the nozzle 104 in correspondence<br>
with the expansion of the piezoelectric element 121. As a result,<br>
pressure is applied to the ink inside the liquid chamber 106,<br>
thereby jetting ink out from the nozzle 104.<br>
Then, the position of the vibration plate 102 returns<br>
to its original position by lowering the voltage applied to the<br>
piezoelectric element 121 to the reference electric potential.<br>
As the vibration plate 102 returns to the original position, the<br>
liquid chamber 106 expands to create a negative pressure in the<br>
liquid chamber 106. The negative pressure in the liquid chamber<br>
106 allows ink to be supplied into the liquid chamber 106 from<br>
the common liquid chamber 108. The recording operation of the<br>
recording head 7 moves on to the next ink jetting process after<br>
the vibration of the meniscus face of the nozzle 104 attenuates<br>
and becomes stable.<br>
It is to be noted that the method of driving the<br>
recording head 7 is not limited to the above-described example<br>
(pull/push method) . For example, a pull method or a push method<br>
may be employed by controlling the drive waveform applied to the<br>
recording head 7.<br>
Next, an example of a control part 200 of the image<br>
forming apparatus is described with reference to Fig.5.<br><br>
The control part 200 of FIG. 5 includes, for example,<br>
a CPU 201 for overall control (including control of correction<br>
of contour parts (jaggy correction)) of the image forming<br>
apparatus, a ROM 202 for storing programs and data installed via<br>
a computer-readable recording medium 500 for execution by the CPU<br>
201, a RAM for temporarily storing image data and the like, a<br>
rewritable non-volatile memory 204 for maintaining data when the<br>
power of the image forming apparatus is turned off, and an ASIC<br>
205 for processing various signals corresponding to image data,<br>
input/output signals for performing image processing (e.g., image<br>
sorting), and controlling various parts of the image forming<br>
apparatus.<br>
The control part 200 further includes, for example,<br>
an I/F 206 for exchanging data and signals with the host, a printing<br>
control part 207 including a data transfer part and a drive<br>
waveform generating part for controlling the recording head 7,<br>
a head driver (driver IC) 208 for driving the recording head 7<br>
provided on the carriage 3, a motor driving part 210 for driving<br>
the main scanning motor 4 and the sub-scanning motor 31, an AC<br>
bias supply part 212 for supplying AC bias to the charge roller<br>
34, and an I/O 213 for receiving various detection signals from<br>
the encoder sensors 43, 35, the temperature sensor 215, and other<br>
sensors.<br>
The control part 200 is connected to a control panel<br>
214 for inputting data to the image forming apparatus and<br><br>
displaying data.<br>
The control part 200 receives data such as image data<br>
from the host side at the I/F 206 via a cable or a network (e.g.,<br>
the Internet) . The host side is connected to, for example, an<br>
information processing apparatus (e.g., a personal computer (PC))<br>
600, an image reading apparatus (e.g., an image scanner) and/or<br>
a photographing apparatus (e.g., a digital camera).<br>
The CPU 201 of the control part 200 reads out and<br>
analyzes the image data (printing data) stored in a reception<br>
buffer of the I/F 206. Then, the ASIC 205 performs various<br>
processes on the image data such as image processing and data<br>
rearrangement. Then, the processed image data are transferred<br>
from the printing control part (head drive control part) 207 to<br>
the head driver 208. It is to be noted that the generation of<br>
dot patterns for outputting images is conducted in the printer<br>
driver of the host side (described below).<br>
The printing control part 207 transfers image data<br>
in the form of serial data to the head driver 208. In addition,<br>
the printing control part 207 outputs transfer clocks (required<br>
for transferring the image data), latch signals, and droplet<br>
control signals (mask signals) to the head driver 208. The<br>
printing control part 207 has a drive waveform generating part<br>
including a D/A converter for performing D/A conversion on pattern<br>
data of drive signals stored in the ROM 202 and a drive waveform<br>
selecting part for selecting the waveform to be output to the head<br><br>
driver 208. Accordingly, the printing control part 207 generates<br>
drive waveforms including one or more drive pulses (drive signals)<br>
and outputs the drive waveforms to the head driver 208.<br>
The head driver 208 applies drive signals included<br>
in the waveforms output from the printing control part 207 to a<br>
driving element (e.g. the above-described piezoelectric element<br>
121) . The driving element generates energy for enabling ink<br>
droplets to be selectively jetted from the recording head 7. The<br>
head driver 208 applies the drive signals based on serially input<br>
image data corresponding to a single line of the recording head<br>
7. By selecting the drive pulse included in the drive waveform,<br>
ink droplets of different sizes including large droplets (large<br>
dots), medium droplets (medium dots), and small droplets (small<br>
dots) can be jetted from the recording head 7.<br>
The CPU 201 calculates the drive output value (control<br>
value) for controlling the main scanning motor 4 and drives the<br>
main scanning motor 4 via the motor driving part 210 in accordance<br>
with the calculated value. The calculation of the CPU 201 is based<br>
on the detected speed value and the detected position value<br>
obtained by sampling the detection pulses of the encoder sensor<br>
43 (i.e. linear encoder) and the target speed value and the target<br>
position value stored beforehand in a speed/position profile.<br>
In the same manner, the CPU 201 calculates the drive<br>
output value (control value) for controlling the sub-scanning<br>
motor 31 and drives the sub-scanning motor 31 via the motor driving<br><br>
part 210 in accordance with the calculated value. The calculation<br>
of the CPU 201 is based on the detected speed value and the detected<br>
position value obtained by sampling the detection pulses of the<br>
encoder sensor 35 (i.e. rotary encoder) and the target speed value<br>
and the target position value stored beforehand in a<br>
speed/position profile.<br>
Next, examples of the printing control part 207 and<br>
the head driver 208 are described with reference to Fig.6.<br>
As described above, the printing control part 207 has<br>
a drive waveform generating part 301 for generating a drive<br>
waveform including plural drive pulses (drive signals) and<br>
outputting the drive waveform in a single printing cycle and a<br>
data transfer part for outputting two bit image data corresponding<br>
to the output (print) image (gradation signal 0, 1) , latch signals<br>
(LAT), and droplet control signals M0-M3.<br>
The droplet control signal is a two bit signal for<br>
instructing opening and closing of an analog switch (switching<br>
part) of the head driver 208 with respect to each droplet. In<br>
correspondence with the printing period of a common drive waveform,<br>
the droplet control signal makes a state-transition to an H level<br>
(ON) with respect to a selected waveform and makes a<br>
state-transition to a L level (OFF) with respect to a non-selected<br>
waveform.<br>
The head driver 208 includes a shift register 311 for<br>
inputting transfer clocks (shift clocks) and serial image data<br><br>
(gradation data: two bit/CH) from the data transfer part 302, a<br>
latch circuit 312 for latching each resistance value of the shift<br>
register 311 with latch signals, a decoder 313 for decoding the<br>
gradation data and the droplet control signals M0-M3 and<br>
outputting the decoding results, a level shifter 314 for<br>
converting the level of the logic level voltage signal of the<br>
decoder 313 into a level operable for an analog switch 315, and<br>
the analog switch 315 for switching on and off (open/close)<br>
according to the output of the decoder 313 via the level shifter<br>
314.<br>
The analog switch 315 is connected to a selection<br>
electrode (independent electrode) 153 of each piezoelectric<br>
element 121 for receiving a common drive waveform from the drive<br>
waveform generating part 301. Therefore, in accordance with the<br>
results of decoding the serially transferred image data (gradation<br>
data) and the droplet control signals MN0-MN3 by the decoder 313,<br>
the analog switch 315 is switched on, to thereby allow a<br>
predetermined drive signal of the common drive waveform to pass<br>
through (to be selected) and applied to the piezoelectric element<br>
121.<br>
Next, examples of a drive waveform are described with<br>
reference to Figs.7 and 8.<br>
As shown in Fig. 7, the drive waveform generating part<br>
301 generates a drive signal (drive waveform) including eight<br>
drive pulses P1-P8 in a single printing period (one drive period) .<br><br>
The drive pulses P1-P8 include, for example, a waveform element<br>
dropping from a reference electric potential Ve and a waveform<br>
element rising from the dropped state. The drive pulse to be used<br>
is selected according to the droplet control signals M0-M3 from<br>
the data transfer part 302.<br>
The waveform element of a drive pulse having a<br>
potential V dropping from the reference electric potential Ve<br>
corresponds to a pulling waveform element for causing the<br>
piezoelectric element 121 to contract and increase the volume of<br>
the liquid chamber 106. The waveform element of a drive pulse<br>
rising from a dropped state corresponds to a pushing waveform<br>
element for causing the piezoelectric element 121 to expand and<br>
reduce the volume of the liquid chamber 106.<br>
Furthermore, in accordance with the droplet control<br>
signals M0-M3 from the data transfer part 302, the drive pulse<br>
P1 is selected in a case of forming a small-sized droplet (small<br>
dot) (See (a) of Fig.8), the drive pulses P4-P6 are selected in<br>
a case of forming medium-sized droplets (medium dots) (See (b)<br>
of Fig. 8) , the drive pulses P2-P8 are selected in a case of forming<br>
large-sized droplets (large dots) (See (c) of Fig.8), and drive<br>
pulse P2 is selected in a case of performing fine driving<br>
(vibration of meniscus with no jetting of droplets) . Accordingly,<br>
the selected drive pulses are applied to the piezoelectric element<br>
121 of the recording head 7.<br>
In a case of forming a medium droplet (medium dot) ,<br><br>
a first droplet is jetted at the drive pulse P4, a second droplet<br>
is jetted at the drive pulse P5, and a third droplet is jetted<br>
at the drive pulse P6. The jetted first, second, and third<br>
droplets are combined during flight and make impact on the medium<br>
as a single droplet. In this case, when the inherent vibration<br>
period of the pressure chamber (liquid chamber 106) is represented<br>
as "Tc", the interval of the jetting timing between the drive pulse<br>
P4 and P5 is preferably " 2Tc ± 0.5 μs. Since the drive pulses<br>
P4 and P5 have a simple pulling waveform element, the ink droplet<br>
speed of the third droplet will become too fast if the drive pulse<br>
P6 is also provided with a simple pulling waveform element. This<br>
could cause the impact location of the droplet to deviate from<br>
the impact location of the other droplets. Therefore, by reducing<br>
the pulling voltage (reducing drop of electric potential) for the<br>
drive pulse P6. the pulling of meniscus can be reduced, to thereby<br>
restrain the ink droplet speed of third droplet. However, the<br>
rise voltage is not to be reduced for saving necessary ink droplet<br>
volume.<br>
In other words, by relatively reducing the pull<br>
voltage for the last drive pulse in a set of drive pulses, the<br>
jetting speed corresponding to the last drive pulse can be<br>
relatively reduced. Accordingly, the impact location of the last<br>
droplet can be matched with the impact locations of the other<br>
droplets.<br>
The fine drive pulse P2 has a drive waveform for<br><br>
vibrating the meniscus of a nozzle without jetting ink droplets<br>
so that the meniscus of the nozzle can be prevented from drying.<br>
The fine drive pulse P2 is applied to the recording head 7 for<br>
a non-printing area of a medium. By using the drive pulse P2 having<br>
a fine waveform as one of the drive pulses for forming a large<br>
droplet, the drive period can be shortened (accelerated).<br>
By setting the interval of the jetting timing between<br>
the fine drive pulse P2 and the drive pulse P3 within a range of<br>
± 0.5 μs with respect to the inherent vibration period "Tc", the<br>
volume of ink droplet jetted by the drive pulse P3 can be gained<br>
(increased). That is, by overlapping (supplementing) the<br>
expansion of the pressure chamber 6 from the drive pulse P3 with<br>
the pressure vibration of the vibration period in the pressure<br>
chamber from the drive pulse P2, the volume of the liquid droplet<br>
jetted at the drive pulse P3 is greater compared to the volume<br>
of the liquid droplet jetted by the drive pulse P3 alone.<br>
Next., an exemplary operation of performing outline<br>
correction of an image with the above-described image forming<br>
apparatus is described.<br>
[First Example]<br>
A liquid jet type image forming apparatus 10 00<br>
exhibits jagged areas at a diagonal part of an outline of an image<br>
since the dots formed in the diagonal part by the image forming<br>
apparatus 1000 are arranged in a stepwise manner. As shown in<br>
(a) of Fig. 9, jagged areas are hardly recognizable in a case where<br><br>
characters are printed in high resolution. However, as shown in<br>
(b) of Fig. 9, significant jagged areas (jaggy) clearly appear and<br>
character quality is poor in a case where characters are printed<br>
in an insufficiently low resolution. As described above,<br>
exemplary methods for reducing (correcting) the jagged areas<br>
include using dots smaller than other dots to form the outline<br>
part or adding new dots to empty spaces in the outline part.<br>
However, the method of using dots smaller than other dots at the<br>
outline part cannot be used as the correcting method in a case<br>
of forming an image with binary values, in other words, forming<br>
an image by printing or not printing a dot(s) (one type of dot<br>
size).<br>
Meanwhile, in a case of using recording liquid (ink)<br>
of four colors (black (K), cyan (C), magenta (M), yellow (Y)),<br>
a composite black dot of C, M, Y can be formed by jetting ink<br>
droplets of C, M, and Y onto the same impact location. It is known<br>
that a dot printed with the composite black ink has a greater<br>
brightness than a dot printed with black (K) ink alone.<br>
Furthermore, another composite black dot of C, M, Y, and K having<br>
lesser brightness can be printed by jetting ink droplets of C,<br>
M, Y, and K onto the same impact location.<br>
Accordingly, by compositing (combining) ink of<br>
different colors, black dots having different brightnesses can<br>
be used to reduce jagged areas at an outline part of, for example,<br>
a black character.<br><br>
Furthermore, in a case where a color ink besides those<br>
of the aforementioned four colors (K, C, M, Y) is used (e.g. , black<br>
ink with greater brightness such as light black, gray), a dot<br>
itself can have different brightness by compositing the colors<br>
such as black, light black, cyan, magenta, and yellow.<br>
In a case of forming an image by using dots of<br>
different sizes, an outline part of an image can also be corrected<br>
by changing the sizes of dots at the outline part into sizes smaller<br>
than other dots or by adding dots smaller than other dots to a<br>
part surrounding the outline part. From a broad (macro)<br>
perspective, the part printed with smaller dots will appear to<br>
have greater brightness since the area covered by ink is smaller<br>
compared to other parts printed with larger dots. Accordingly,<br>
an outline correcting effect can be attained. It is also regarded<br>
that the different dot sizes also serve to physically reduce the<br>
jagged areas.<br>
Furthermore, with a configuration capable of forming<br>
more dot sizes, a more suitable outline correction can be achieved<br>
owing to more choices of dot sizes and more variations of dot<br>
correction patterns. In addition, such configuration can be used<br>
in forming character other than black.<br>
Therefore, an image forming apparatus capable of<br>
forming dots of various sizes can use both the above-described<br>
outline correcting method using different dot sizes (e.g., using<br>
dots smaller than other dots as the dots of an outline part or<br><br>
adding dots no larger than the other dots to a part surrounding<br>
an outline part) and the above-described outline correcting method<br>
using different dot brightnesses (e.g., in a case of black dots,<br>
using different kinds of ink to form different dot brightnesses) .<br>
Accordingly, in a case of forming black characters<br>
or thin lines, a combination of the outline correcting method using<br>
different dot sizes and the outline correcting method using<br>
different dot brightnesses can be used whereas in a case of forming<br>
characters or thin lines of a color besides black, the outline<br>
correcting method using different dot sizes can be used.<br>
In other words, in an image forming apparatus capable<br>
of forming dots of different sizes, either one or both of the<br>
following method (part) can be used according to the image to be<br>
corrected (target image), in which one method (part) is for<br>
changing the brightness of at least a single dot situated in an<br>
outline part (e.g., outline part of a character or a thin line)<br>
or the brightness of at least a single dot added to a part<br>
surrounding the outline part to a brightness relatively greater<br>
than the brightness of other dots situated in the outline part<br>
and the other method (part) is for changing the dot size of at<br>
least a single dot situated in an outline part (e.g. , outline part<br>
of a character or a thin line) or the dot size of at least a single<br>
dot added to a part surrounding the outline part. As described<br>
below, it is to be noted that the two methods (parts) can be<br>
combined as a single method (part) for performing a brightness<br><br>
changing process and a dot size changing process at the same time<br>
by using a correction pattern.<br>
Accordingly, by changing dot size and dot brightness,<br>
correction can be performed at a higher level and with more<br>
variations. In addition, improving character quality by changing<br>
dot size and changing dot brightness can reduce the tradeoffs<br>
between preventing drying of the nozzle and preventing increase<br>
of ink cost. For example, in a case of printing a document mainly<br>
of black, although jetting failure due to drying of a color nozzle<br>
tends to occur, a process of cleaning the nozzle would reduce<br>
printing speed. Meanwhile, in a case of compositing black, ink<br>
costs tend to increase (particularly, cost increase unrelated to<br>
improvement of image quality). Thus, performing outline<br>
correction only by changing dot brightness causes increase of ink<br>
cost and ink bleeding. Therefore, by enabling both dot size<br>
change and dot brightness change, nozzle drying and ink cost<br>
increase can both be prevented.<br>
Next, exemplary cases in performing the<br>
above-described outline correction are described with reference<br>
to Fig.10.<br>
Fig.10(a) shows a case where no outline correction<br>
is performed. In Fig. 10 (a), stepwise jagged parts are noticeable<br>
at the outline part. Meanwhile, Fig.10(b) shows a case where<br>
outline correction is performed by having empty (blank) dots of<br>
the dots surrounding the outline part changed into image (printed)<br><br>
dots Ds, that is, changing the empty (blank) dots into dots having<br>
a size smaller (or equal) than that of the dots of the outline<br>
part. In addition to or as an alternative of the outline<br>
correction of Fig.10(b), the dots of the outline part can be<br>
changed into dots having a relatively small size. Accordingly,<br>
by adding small dots to the outline part, the jagged parts at the<br>
outline part become smooth. In a case of an image forming<br>
apparatus capable of using dots size, outline correction can be<br>
performed in a greater variety of ways. Thus, the image forming<br>
apparatus can perform more suitable outline correction. It is<br>
to be noted that the number of multi-value or dot formation<br>
location, number of dots, sizes of dots are not limited to those<br>
described in the embodiments of the present invention, such as<br>
in Fig.10(b). Furthermore, this outline correction can be<br>
performed not only for black characters but also for color<br>
characters.<br>
Fig.10(c) shows a case where outline correction is<br>
performed by changing the dots of the outline part into dots Dp<br>
having relatively greater brightness than that of the dots of the<br>
outline part. The changing of brightness may be performed on the<br>
dots to be added to a part surrounding the outline part or on the<br>
dots which originally form, in this example, a black character.<br>
By using a different brightness for the dots forming a character,<br>
the jagged parts at the outline part become less noticeable.<br>
Thereby, an outline correction effect can be attained.<br><br>
Furthermore, by the use of dots with different<br>
brightnesses, outline correction can be performed not only with<br>
an image forming apparatus capable of forming dots of different<br>
sizes but even with an image forming apparatus capable of forming<br>
dots of a single dot size. It is to be noted that the number of<br>
multi-value or dot formation location, number of dots, sizes of<br>
dots, brightness of dots, or the kind of ink used for forming the<br>
dots are not limited to those described in the embodiments of the<br>
present invention, such as in Fig.lO(c).<br>
Fig.10(d) shows a case where outline correction is<br>
performed by changing the dots of the outline part into dots Dp<br>
having relatively greater brightness than that of the dots of the<br>
outline part and also changing (adding) the dots surrounding the<br>
outline parts into dots Dps having relatively greater brightness<br>
as well as smaller dot size than the other dots of the outline<br>
part. In other words, Fig.10(d) shows a case of combining the<br>
dot size changing process and dot brightness changing process.<br>
Thereby, a more efficient outline correction effect can be<br>
attained. The dot brightness changing process may be performed<br>
on the dots originally forming, in this example, a black character,<br>
the dots to be added to the outline part, or the dots changed into<br>
a smaller size. It is to be noted that the number of multi-value<br>
or dot formation location, number of dots, sizes of dots,<br>
brightness of dots, or the kind of ink used for forming the dots<br>
are not limited to those described in the embodiments of the<br><br>
present invention, such as in Fig.10(d).<br>
It is to be noted that the liquid jet head capable<br>
of jetting dots of different sizes is not limited to a<br>
piezoelectric type head and an electrostatic type head. For<br>
example, the liquid jet head may be a thermal type head including<br>
nozzles of different diameters or a heater having a non-linear<br>
characteristic for controlling heater resistance. The<br>
above-described outline correction effect can be attained with<br>
an image forming apparatus having any one of the heads.<br>
Accordingly, jagged areas (jaggy) can be hardly<br>
noticeable and image quality can be improved by changing the<br>
brightness of at least one dot in the dots forming an outline part<br>
(for example, an outline part of a character or a linear image)<br>
or one dot to be added to a part surrounding the outline part to<br>
a bri ghtness relatively greater than that of the other dots forming<br>
the outline part.<br>
From another aspect, black characters, in general,<br>
are preferred to be formed darkly and clearly for better visibility.<br>
However, in a case where there is a significant contrast between<br>
the paper and the image (character), the edges at the outline part<br>
of the image become emphasized and jagged areas become noticeable.<br>
Therefore, in a case of performing outline correction by using<br>
dots having different brightnesses, the jagged areas can be<br>
reduced without deterioration of visibility by using dots of low<br>
brightness for the framework of the character while using dots<br><br>
of higher brightness for the outline part of the character.<br>
For example, in a case of forming a black character<br>
with recording liquids of four colors (K, C, M, Y) , the density<br>
of the black character can be increased by using a composite black<br>
ink including the four colors (four color composite black ink) .<br>
However, in this case, jagged areas can be reduced without<br>
deterioration of visibility by using the four color composite<br>
black ink for the framework of the black character while using<br>
a single black color (K) ink or a three color composite black ink<br>
for the outline part of the black character. Furthermore, the<br>
amount of ink consumed can be less compared to using the four color<br>
composite black ink.<br>
Furthermore, by detecting the angle of an outline part<br>
and changing the dot size changing process and/or the dot<br>
brightness changing process (e.g., switching a correction pattern<br>
(described in detail below) ) according to the detected angle, an<br>
optimum outline correction can be realized according to the angle<br>
of the outline part. For example, in detecting the angle of the<br>
outline part, first, the dots forming the outline part are detected.<br>
Then, an outline formed by connecting the detected dots is obtained.<br>
Then, the angle of the outline part is calculated by comparing<br>
the outline and a predetermined direction (e.g., main scanning<br>
direction or sub-scanning direction) . Accordingly, a correction<br>
pattern corresponding to the calculated angle of the outline part<br>
is selected.<br><br>
Exemplary cases of performing outline correction<br>
using correction patterns according to various conditions and<br>
factors (e.g., angle of the outline part, etc.) are described below.<br>
In the case of performing outline correction according to the angle<br>
of the outline part, a correction pattern includes one or more<br>
outline pattern data and correction process data corresponding<br>
to the outline pattern data. Thus, the outline correction is<br>
performed by matching a detected outline pattern and a correction<br>
pattern.<br>
Whether jagged areas (jaggy) in the outline part are<br>
noticeable may also depend on printing conditions (e.g.,<br>
resolution, type of paper). Since dot formation location can be<br>
specified in detail in a case of high resolution printing, jaggy<br>
in the outline part is less noticeable. Therefore, in a case where<br>
sufficient resolution can be obtained., outline correction miaht<br>
not be required.<br>
Furthermore, with respect to types of paper, dots tend<br>
to blur when plain paper is used. Meanwhile, when glossy paper<br>
is used, the shapes of dots clearly appear and the density of the<br>
paper surface is uniform. Therefore, the edges tend to appear<br>
and jaggy is noticeable.<br>
Therefore, it is determined whether it is necessary<br>
to perform the outline detection and outline correction depends<br>
on printing conditions (e.g., resolution, type of paper) and<br>
performing outline correction; when it is determined to be<br><br>
necessary, with a correction pattern based on the printing<br>
conditions, an optimum outline correction can be performed without<br>
unnecessary data processing.<br>
Since the outline correction method according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention is applicable to characters<br>
and thin line images, the calculation workload performed for the<br>
outline correction method can be reduced by obtaining object data<br>
of the image to be printed (e.g., text data, photograph data,<br>
graphic data, thin line data) and performing the outline detection<br>
process and the outline correction process on character data and<br>
thin line data only.<br>
Furthermore, as for other printing conditions<br>
(factors) of an liquid jet type image forming apparatus, jetting<br>
failure (e.g., broken (missing) line patterns, or bent line<br>
patterns) tend to occur as ink becomes dry and the viscosity of<br>
the ink increases. Particularly, in a case where the image<br>
forming apparatus is used under a low temperature and/or low<br>
humidity environment or a case where the image forming apparatus<br>
has not been used for a long period, such problems are liable to<br>
occur.<br>
Furthermore, as for other printing conditions, when<br>
printing image data (e.g., printing an image consisting of mostly<br>
black characters but with a part expressed with color characters)<br>
in a case where a certain ink (e.g., black) is frequently used<br>
while other color inks are not often used, the low usage rate of<br><br>
the other color inks may cause jetting failure and may skip (miss)<br>
printing the color character part.<br>
In order to prevent the above-described jetting<br>
failures, the nozzle face is cleaned and blank (empty) ink jetting<br>
is performed. However, these processes reduce printing<br>
throughput and unnecessarily consume ink. Furthermore, although<br>
color inks may be used by printing a black character part with<br>
composite black ink for preventing the jetting failure, this leads<br>
to an increase in the amount of ink consumption and the appearance<br>
of jagged areas due to an increase of density of the characters.<br>
More specifically, in a case where a composite black of four colors<br>
(K, C, M, Y) is used, jagged areas will clearly appear due to<br>
increased density of the characters. In a case where a composite<br>
black of three colors (C, M, Y) is used, visibility of the<br>
characters is reduced due to reduced density of the characters.<br>
By referring to object data of image data to be printed<br>
(target image data) or color component data calculated from the<br>
target image data, an optimum outline correction can be performed<br>
from the aspect of steady nozzle jetting performance and suitable<br>
ink consumption based on the object data and the color component<br>
data. That is, a correction pattern can be selected from the<br>
aspect of attaining a balanced usage of ink, for example, by<br>
selecting a correction pattern using a large amount of color ink<br>
in a case of printing an image consisting mostly of characters/thin<br>
lines where the color ink usage rate is low or by switching to<br><br>
a correction pattern that controls the consumption of each ink<br>
to a predetermined amount based on color component data.<br>
In a case of performing an outline correction using<br>
the dot size changing process where the target image data includes<br>
characters of a color other than black, suitable outline<br>
correction can be performed by changing the correction patterns<br>
based on color component data. For example, since jagged areas<br>
are more noticeable when using colors as black, cyan, and magenta<br>
at an outline part compared to using a color such as yellow, the<br>
correction pattern can be changed based on color component data<br>
so that optimum outline correction can be achieved.<br>
Furthermore, correction patterns may also be<br>
switched according to status data of the image forming apparatus<br>
(e.g., ambient temperature or humidity of the image forming<br>
apparatus, lapsed time from previous use of the image forming<br>
apparatus) . For example, under conditions where jetting failure<br>
tends to occur (e.g., low temperature, low humidity, long unused<br>
period), it is preferable to select a correction pattern that can<br>
use various inks in a balanced manner for attaining steady jetting<br>
performance. For example, under conditions where it is difficult<br>
for ink to dry (e.g., high temperature, high humidity) it is<br>
preferable to select a correction pattern that can reduce ink<br>
consumption for preventing problems such as cockling and bleeding.<br>
Furthermore, in a case where the image forming<br>
apparatus is capable of forming dots of multiple sizes<br><br>
(multi-value dot size), ambient conditions may cause jetting<br>
failure to occur for a particular size droplet (e.g., small<br>
droplet), to thereby degrade image quality. Therefore, by<br>
switching the correction pattern and changing the combination of<br>
dot sizes, degrading of image quality due to jetting failure can<br>
be prevented.<br>
Next, an exemplary outline correction operation<br>
(method) is described with reference to Fig.11. This outline<br>
correction operation is executed by having a CPU 201 execute a<br>
program stored in a ROM 202.<br>
In the outline correction operation, first, printing<br>
data are obtained. For example, the printing data include<br>
printing mode (resolution, type of paper) , image data (e.g., color<br>
component data, object data) , and status data of the image forming<br>
apparatus (e.g., ambient data). Then, the CPU 201 determines<br>
whether outline correction is necessary based on the obtained<br>
printing data.<br>
In a case where outline correction is determined<br>
unnecessary (e.g., sufficient high resolution, no character/thin<br>
line to be printed), outline correction is not performed.<br>
In a case where outline correction is determined<br>
necessary, the CPU 201 selects a correction pattern to be used<br>
based on a table as shown in Fig. 12. It is to be noted that the<br>
table shown in Fig.12 is merely an example. Thus, the choices<br>
of patterns or the number of patterns is not limited to those shown<br><br>
in Fig.12.<br>
Since the optimum correction process differs<br>
depending on, for example, resolution and type of paper, the<br>
correction pattern is different according to resolution and type<br>
of paper. Furthermore, even if the resolution or the type of paper<br>
is the same, it may be desirable to switch the correction pattern<br>
according to the ambient conditions of the image forming apparatus<br>
or data configuration of the image data. For example, a<br>
correction pattern that increases the usage rate of C, M, Y may<br>
be selected for preventing nozzle failure. In another example,<br>
a correction pattern that controls ink consumption may be selected<br>
for reducing ink cost. Furthermore, in a case where the image<br>
forming apparatus is capable of forming dots of multiple sizes,<br>
a combination of the dot size changing process and the dot<br>
brightness changing process may be used when correcting black<br>
characters and the dot size changing process may be used when<br>
correcting color characters. Thus, different correction<br>
patterns are assigned to various correction levels which are<br>
determined (defined) by calculating various printing data.<br>
As shown in Fig. 13, each correction pattern includes<br>
plural outline patterns and dot arrangement data (e.g., dot<br>
formation location, number of dots, dot size, type of ink)<br>
corresponding to the outline patterns. The CPU 201 performs a<br>
pattern matching process on the shape (pattern) of a detected<br>
outline part and the outline patterns included in the correction<br><br>
pattern. The CPU 201 performs outline correction on the detected<br>
outline part by using a matching outline pattern in the correction<br>
pattern.<br>
More specifically, in performing the outline<br>
correction process based on the printing data according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the CPU 201 selects a<br>
correction pattern from the table shown in Fig.12 and performs<br>
outline correction on the detected outline part by using a<br>
corresponding outline pattern of the selected correction pattern.<br>
For example, an outline pattern having an angle corresponding to<br>
that of the detected outline part may be used in the outline<br>
correction process.<br>
In an exemplary table shown in Fig. 12, the correction<br>
levels (correction rank) α, β, γ are defined (categorized)<br>
according to ambient conditions of the image forming apparatus<br>
and/or configuration (constitution) of the image data. Each<br>
correction level is assigned with correction patterns A through<br>
G according to printing mode. For example, in a case where the<br>
correction levels α, β, γ are categorized according to ambient<br>
temperature (α indicating low temperature, β indicating medium<br>
temperature, γ indicating high temperature), a correction<br>
pattern A that can use various inks in a balanced manner can be<br>
assigned for correction level α (i.e. using C, M, and Y inks for<br>
increasing brightness rather than using K ink only in a low<br>
temperature condition). Meanwhile, a correction pattern C that<br><br>
that can reduce ink consumption can be assigned for correction<br>
level γ (i. e. using one type of ink rather than using C, M, Y inks) .<br>
For example, in a case where the correction levels<br>
α, β, γ are categorized according to the data configuration of<br>
the image data (α indicating small proportion of black color<br>
data, β indicating medium proportion of black color data, γ<br>
indicating large proportion of black color data), a correction<br>
pattern A having high C, M, Y usage rates can be assigned for<br>
correction level α (i.e. using C, M, and Y inks for increasing<br>
brightness instead of using K ink only when the proportion of black<br>
color data in the image data is small) . Meanwhile, a correction<br>
pattern C having low C, M, Y usage rates can be assigned for<br>
correction level γ . It is to be noted that the categorization<br>
of the correction level or the number of correction levels is not<br>
to be limited to those described above.<br>
Furthermore, in a case of forming black characters<br>
or black thin lines, the timing for jetting liquid droplets of<br>
one or more colors can be different with respect to those of other<br>
colors. For example, in a case of performing outline correction<br>
with a configuration capable of jetting four colors of K, C, M,<br>
Y, the timing for jetting K color ink can be different from the<br>
timing for jetting C, M, Y color inks. This allows outline<br>
correcting dots to be formed at areas where a satisfactory outline<br>
correction effect can be attained. It is to be noted that various<br>
head configurations can be used (e.g., a configuration having a<br><br>
head corresponding to each color, a configuration having one head<br>
for K ink and another head for C, M, Y ink, and a configuration<br>
having a head with plural nozzle arrays).<br>
Fig.14 shows exemplary cases where droplets are<br>
jetted at different timings. Fig.14(a) shows a case where no<br>
outline correction is performed. In Fig. 14 (a) , jagged areas are<br>
noticeable at the outline part. Fig.14(b) shows a case where<br>
outline correction is performed by adding small dots Ds to the<br>
outline part. However, since the kinds of dot sizes are limited<br>
and dot formation locations are defined by resolution, the outline<br>
correction effect is still insufficient. In Fig.14 (c) , the dot<br>
formation locations of a portion of the dots D are shifted<br>
(deviated) a half pitch of the resolution with respect to the dot<br>
formation locations of the other dots (in this example, the dots<br>
are shifted in a main scanning direction which perpendicularly<br>
intersects the nozzle array direction) . Accordingly, the outline<br>
correcting dots can be formed in areas where greater outline<br>
correction effect can be attained. In addition to the outline<br>
correction effect (smoothing effect) using a different brightness<br>
at the outline part, the dots also serve to physically cover the<br>
jagged areas. The example shown in Fig. 14 (c) can be executed not<br>
only by an image forming apparatus capable of forming multi-value<br>
dot patterns but also by an image forming apparatus capable of<br>
forming binary dot patterns. Thus, depending on the selected<br>
recording head, the correction process of using different dot<br><br>
brightnesses can be used in combination.<br>
As shown in Fig.l4(d), an image forming apparatus<br>
capable of forming multi-value dot patterns can perform a<br>
combination of changing dot size and changing dot formation<br>
location. Thus, depending on the selected recording head, the<br>
correction process of using different dot brightnesses can be used<br>
in combination.<br>
It is to be noted that the outline correction<br>
processes described with Fig. 14 may be performed with a recording<br>
head, dot formation location, number of dots, dot size, and ink<br>
other than those described above. In changing the timing for<br>
jetting the ink, a recording head having drive waveforms of<br>
different rise timings may be used for selectively applying the<br>
drive waveform to the recording head.<br>
Although the above-described embodiments of the<br>
present invention are described with a serial type image forming<br>
apparatus, the present invention may also be effectively applied<br>
to a line type image forming apparatus.<br>
In the line type image forming apparatus, nozzle are<br>
arranged substantially across the entire paper in the paper width<br>
direction. Furthermore, the line type image forming apparatus<br>
performs recording (printing) by conveying the paper instead of<br>
scanning in the width direction. Therefore, the line type image<br>
forming apparatus is only capable of using the interlace method<br>
and the multi-pass method. This makes it difficult for the line<br><br>
type image forming apparatus to increase image forming (printing)<br>
resolution. Accordingly, the problem of jaggy may be more serious<br>
for the line type image forming apparatus compared to the serial<br>
type image forming apparatus.<br>
Furthermore, since the line type image forming<br>
apparatus performs recording by conveying paper with respect to<br>
an affixed recording head, it is difficult to perform a head<br>
cleaning process and a blank jetting process with the line type<br>
image forming apparatus. Furthermore, since the line type image<br>
forming apparatus has a longer recording head than that of the<br>
serial image forming apparatus, a greater amount of ink is used<br>
in the cleaning process and the blank jetting process.<br>
Therefore, the difficulties of outline correction,<br>
steady jetting performance, and ink consumption also apply to the<br>
line type image forming apparatus. Therefore, the present<br>
invention is also effective for the line type image forming<br>
apparatus.<br>
The above-described program according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention may be installed in a<br>
computer-readable recording medium 500 for enabling an image<br>
forming apparatus including a CPU (computer) 201 to perform the<br>
outline correction operation (method) , to thereby eliminate jaggy<br>
and improve image quality.<br>
Although the above-described image forming apparatus<br>
is explained having a configuration of a printer, the present<br><br>
invention may also be applied to an image forming apparatus having<br>
a configuration of a facsimile machine, a plotting apparatus, a<br>
copier, or a multifunction machine having the functions of a<br>
printer, a facsimile, and a copier, for example.<br>
[Second Example]<br>
Next, another exemplary operation of performing<br>
outline correction of an image with the above-described image<br>
forming apparatus is described.<br>
As described above, in a case of jetting liquid<br>
droplets of different dot diameters by applying drive pulses of<br>
different widths or different numbers of drive pulses to the<br>
recording head 7, even if the timing of the start of the rise of<br>
the meniscus is the same upon input of the drive pulse, the timing<br>
for jetting liquid droplets upon the end of the drive pulse is<br>
different. Therefore, the time for the droplets to reach the<br>
medium surface is different. As a result, the dot formation<br>
position on the paper is different depending on dot size.<br>
Furthermore, since the viscosity resistance of ink<br>
changes according to ambient temperature and ambient humidity,<br>
the meniscus may not be appropriately controlled even if a drive<br>
pulse is applied to the recording head 7. This results in<br>
deviation of dot impact position. The ambient conditions also<br>
make it difficult to maintain suitable dot size and dot shape.<br>
This is also results to deviation of dot impact position.<br>
Furthermore, in a case where the image forming apparatus 1000 is<br><br>
not used for a long period of time, dried ink may accumulate<br>
surrounding of the nozzle. Moreover, in a case where the image<br>
forming apparatus 1000 has been used for a long period of time<br>
since the manufacture of the image forming apparatus 1000, changes<br>
in the characteristics of its recording head 7 may affect liquid<br>
jet precision and lead to deviation of dot formation position.<br>
Although an example of a piezoelectric type recording<br>
head is used for describing the problem of dot formation position,<br>
this problem may also occur in a case of using a thermal type<br>
recording head or an electrostatic type recording head (a head<br>
using electrostatic force between a vibration plate and an<br>
electrode facing the vibration plate for applying pressure to a<br>
liquid chamber via the vibration plate) as the recording head 7.<br>
For example, the present invention may be applied to a case of<br>
using a thermal type recording head which forms multi-value dot<br>
patterns by controlling the resistance value of its thermoelectric<br>
transducer.<br>
Next, exemplary cases in performing the<br>
above-described outline correction are described with reference<br>
to Fig.15.<br>
Fig.15(a) shows a case where no outline correction<br>
is performed. As shown in Fig.15 (a), satisfactory image quality<br>
cannot be attained and stepwise jagged parts are noticeable at<br>
the outline part in a case where resolution is not high enough.<br>
Accordingly, by replacing the dots at the parts surrounding the<br><br>
outline part with other dots, the jagged areas can be reduced.<br>
For example, Fig. 15 (b) shows a case where one blank<br>
dot situated in the stepwise part of the outline part is replaced<br>
with a small size image dot (addition of dots) . Fig. 15 (c) shows<br>
a case where two blank dots situated in the stepwise part of the<br>
outline part are replaced with one small size image dot and another<br>
medium size image dot (addition of dots) . Fig. 15 (d) shows a case<br>
where two more dots situated in the stepwise part of the outline<br>
part are replaced with another small size image dot and another<br>
medium size image dot in addition to those of Fig.15 (c).<br>
However, as described above, in a case where there<br>
is a deviation of dot formation position, the above-described<br>
outline correction process may adversely affect image quality.<br>
For example, in a case of performing the outline correction by<br>
adding dot Dh (see Fig. 16 (b) ) for reducing jaggy in the outline<br>
part shown in Fig.16 (a) , deviation of dot formation position (see<br>
Fig.16 (c) ) may cause undesired overlapped or blurred areas, to<br>
thereby degrade image quality. More specifically, as shown in<br>
Figs. 17 (a) and 17 (b) , the roughness at the outline part of the<br>
character in Fig.17(b) is significantly noticeable compared to<br>
that of Fig.17(a).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention selectively<br>
changes the method (pattern) for replacing a target dot with<br>
another dot having, for example, different dot size and/or<br>
brightness with respect to the target dot by referring to factors<br><br>
(e.g., ambient temperature, ambient humidity, lapsed time from<br>
manufacture, lapsed time from previous image forming process) that<br>
cause deviation of dot formation position (dot impact position)<br>
or by referring to the actual amount (degree) by which the dots<br>
deviate from a desired dot formation position on the paper (medium) ,<br>
so as not to use a deviated dot(s) that would adversely affect<br>
image quality. For example, the method (pattern) of replacing<br>
dots can be changed by selectively changing a correction pattern<br>
for maintaining image quality of an output image (described in<br>
detail below).<br>
The same as Fig. 15 (a), Fig. 18 (a) shows a case where<br>
no outline correction is performed. Likewise, jagged areas are<br>
noticeable at the outline part. Accordingly, as shown in<br>
Fig.18 (b), an outline correction process using different size<br>
droplets (medium droplet and small droplet : medium dot and small<br>
dot) is performed. In this case, when deviation of a droplet<br>
impact position occurs (e.g., deviation of small droplet impact<br>
position) , the dot corresponding to the deviated droplet deviates<br>
from its target dot formation position (small dot Ds deviating<br>
one dot from target dot formation position in Fig. 18 (c) ) . Thus,<br>
in addition to not being able to attain a satisfactory outline<br>
correction effect, such deviation causes degrading of image<br>
quality such as creation of overlapped lines, mist, and blurring.<br>
In a case where there is a significant deviation of<br>
a small droplet impact location, a correction pattern which uses<br><br>
only medium droplets (no small droplets) can be selected as the<br>
correction pattern for performing the outline correction process<br>
(See Fig. 18 (d) ) . Likewise, in a case where there is a significant<br>
deviation of a medium droplet impact location, a correction<br>
pattern which uses only small droplets (no medium droplets) can<br>
be selected as the correction pattern for performing the outline<br>
correction process (See Fig. 18 (e) ) . Thus, an optimum correction<br>
pattern can be used in the outline correction process (dot<br>
replacement process) according to the deviation status (or the<br>
cause of deviation) . It is to be noted that the types of droplets,<br>
droplet sizes (large, medium, small), or correction pattern are<br>
not limited to those described with Fig.18.<br>
Next, factors causing deviation of dot formation<br>
position, how the factors are detected, and how the factors are<br>
input are described.<br>
As described above, the factors causing deviation of<br>
dot formation position may be, for example, ambient temperature,<br>
ambient humidity, elapsed time from the time of manufacture of<br>
the image forming apparatus, and elapsed time from the previous<br>
time of performing an image forming process. Accordingly, the<br>
factors can be detected by providing the image forming apparatus<br>
1000 with a part for detecting the ambient temperature, ambient<br>
humidity (e.g., temperature sensor 215) and a part for counting<br>
the time elapsed from the time of manufacturing the image forming<br>
apparatus or the previous time of performing an image forming<br><br>
process and updating the factors by storing them in a non-volatile<br>
memory (RAM) 204 of the control part 200.<br>
Furthermore, the actual amount (degree) of a dot<br>
deviating from a target dot formation position on a medium may<br>
also be detected. For example, in detecting the actual amount<br>
of dot formation position deviation, first, a dot pattern enabling<br>
detection of the amount of deviation from the dot formation<br>
position during an actual image forming process (e.g., a ruled<br>
pattern formed with different size dots) is printed (output) on<br>
a medium. Then, dot formation data (impact precision data),<br>
density data, and brightness data are obtained by reading the<br>
printed dot pattern with, for example, a photo-sensor or a scanning<br>
unit. Then, the CPU 201 calculates how much a dot (s) is deviated<br>
from a target dot formation position (deviation amount) based on<br>
the obtained data.<br>
Alternatively, in a case where the configuration for<br>
detecting the actual deviation amount becomes too complicated,<br>
the user may input data related to the deviation amount. Likewise,<br>
a dot pattern enabling detection of the amount of deviation from<br>
the dot formation position during an actual image forming process<br>
is printed (output) on a medium. Then, the user determines the<br>
deviation amount by examining the output dot pattern and inputs<br>
data related to the determined deviation amount. For example,<br>
the user has the deviation amount divided into multiple levels<br>
(first level to n level) beforehand. Then, the user determines<br><br>
the level to which the output dot pattern belongs. Then, the user<br>
inputs data (e.g., numeral) corresponding to the determined level<br>
via the control panel 214.<br>
Next, a relationship between dot formation position<br>
deviation and resolution and a relationship between medium type<br>
(paper type) and image quality are described.<br>
As described above, in general, correction of the<br>
outline part (particularly, the stepwise part of the outline part)<br>
of an image is required in a case where resolution is low.<br>
Meanwhile, in a case of high resolution, correction of the outline<br>
part of an image may not be required since a substantially<br>
satisfactory image quality can be attained. Furthermore, jagged<br>
areas become more noticeable at the stepwise part as resolution<br>
becomes lower. Therefore, it is preferable to change the method<br>
of correcting the outline part (method of dot replacement)<br>
according to the resolution of the image to be formed.<br>
Furthermore, deviation of dot formation position<br>
becomes more noticeable (thereby, regarded as having poor image<br>
quality) in a case of a type of medium having less liquid bleeding<br>
(blurring) characteristics. For example, even if the deviation<br>
amount of the dot formation position is the same, impact deviation<br>
has a direct influence on image quality in a case of using glossy<br>
paper. This is because glossy paper has high contrast and<br>
exhibits little blurring of impact droplets. Therefore, it is<br>
preferable to change the method of correcting the outline part<br><br>
(method of dot replacement) according to the type to medium.<br>
Next, in view of the above, an exemplary outline<br>
correction operation (method) is described with reference to the<br>
flowchart of Fig.19. This outline correction operation is<br>
executed by having a CPU 201 execute a program stored in a ROM<br>
202.<br>
In this outline correction operation (method), a<br>
correction pattern is prepared beforehand for performing pattern<br>
matching with respect to an outline part of an image. Then, in<br>
a case where there is a match between the outline part of an image<br>
and the correction pattern as a result of the pattern matching<br>
process, outline correction is performed by replacing a dot(s)<br>
surrounding a stepwise part of the outline with a dot(s) having<br>
a size designated by the matching correction pattern. It is to<br>
be noted that the outline correction process performed by dot<br>
replacement includes replacing a blank dot with an image dot and<br>
modifying the size of the image dot.<br>
More specifically, in the outline correction process,<br>
first, the CPU 201 determines whether the resolution of the<br>
printing mode is no greater than a predetermined resolution for<br>
determining whether correction of the outline part is necessary.<br>
As described above, in a case where printing resolution is high<br>
enough that jagged areas are hardly noticeable, the CPU 201 does<br>
not need to execute the outline correction process. As an<br>
alternative of or in addition to the step of determining the<br><br>
resolution, a step of determining the type of medium can be<br>
performed for determining whether the outline correction process<br>
is necessary.<br>
In a case where the outline correction process is<br>
determined necessary, the factors that cause dot formation<br>
position deviation (hereinafter also referred to as "dot deviation<br>
data") are obtained. As described above, the dot deviation data<br>
may include ambient temperature, ambient humidity, elapsed time<br>
from time of manufacturing the image forming apparatus, elapsed<br>
time from previous time of executing an image forming process,<br>
actual deviation amount based on an output dot pattern, or data<br>
related to the deviation amount input by the user.<br>
Then, the obtained dot deviation data are compared<br>
with a selection condition (s) for selecting a correction pattern<br>
including predetermined resolution data (or medium type data) .<br>
Then, a correction pattern is selected based on the comparison<br>
result. Then, an outline correction process is executed by using<br>
the selected correction pattern. It is to be noted that, the<br>
outline correction process (dot replacement process) may not be<br>
executed in a case where there is no correction pattern that<br>
satisfies the selection condition.<br>
For example, as exemplarily shown in the table of<br>
Fig. 20, a correction pattern can be selected based on a combination<br>
of resolution and ambient temperature. More specifically, in<br>
this example, outline correction is not performed regardless of<br><br>
the ambient temperature when the resolution is equal to or greater<br>
than 600 dpi X 600 dpi. Furthermore, pattern A or B is selected<br>
according to resolution when the temperature T is less than a<br>
predetermined temperature Tl. Furthermore, pattern C or D is<br>
selected according to resolution when the temperature T is no less<br>
than the predetermined temperature Tl but less than a<br>
predetermined temperature 12. Furthermore, pattern E or F is<br>
selected according to resolution when the temperature T is no less<br>
than the predetermined temperature T2.<br>
Generally, in terms of ambient temperature, ink<br>
viscosity tends to increase and jetting failure of small droplets<br>
tends to occur when the ambient temperature of the image forming<br>
apparatus 1000 is low. Therefore, it is preferable to select a<br>
correction pattern that does not use small droplets or a correction<br>
pattern having a reduced small droplet usage rate (Pattern A, B) .<br>
In a case of normal temperature, jetting failure hardly occurs.<br>
Therefore, a correction pattern using every type (size) of dot<br>
can be selected (Pattern C, D) . In a case of high temperature,<br>
problems such as decrease of ink viscosity, increase of ink<br>
consumption, increase of jetting speed, scattering of ink in a<br>
mist-like manner upon impact, or trailing dots upon impact tend<br>
to occur. Therefore, a correction pattern using droplets which<br>
do not cause such problems or a correction pattern using less ink<br>
can be selected Pattern E, F) . In addition, a further preferable<br>
correction pattern can be selected according to printing<br><br>
conditions (e.g., resolution, type of medium).<br>
It is to be noted that a correction pattern can be<br>
selected based on the deviation amount of dot formation position<br>
and/or factors that cause deviation of dot formation position.<br>
Initially, correction patterns that cause little deviation<br>
according to various printing conditions (e.g., resolution, type<br>
of paper) are prepared first hand. However, in a case where a<br>
dot of a certain size may cause unsatisfactory correction results,<br>
a correction pattern using dots of the certain size is avoided<br>
and an alternative correction pattern is selected (a correction<br>
pattern having the most effective correction performance without<br>
using dots of the certain size) . In a case where an effective<br>
correction effect is unlikely to be attained by selecting any one<br>
of the correction patterns, a correction pattern which performs<br>
no out line correction may be selected.<br>
Although one example of changing the method of<br>
correction is described as changing the correction pattern by<br>
preparing multiple correction patterns corresponding to. factors<br>
that cause dot formation position deviation and selecting a<br>
correction pattern based on the detection results of the factors,<br>
other examples of changing the correction method may be used. For<br>
example, instead of changing the correction pattern, the size of<br>
the dots for performing dot replacement can be changed by comparing<br>
the factors with a predetermined condition(s) according to a<br>
pattern matching result.<br><br>
Hence, by providing a part for changing the method<br>
of replacing the dots forming an outline part of an image based<br>
on factors that affect dot formation position or the amount of<br>
deviation from a dot formation position on a medium (detection<br>
data or data input from outside) , the method of the dot replacement<br>
(correction method) can be changed when dot formation position<br>
deviation occurs so that outline correction can be performed<br>
without being adversely affected by the dot formation position<br>
deviation. Thereby, image quality can be prevented from<br>
degrading.<br>
Furthermore, by providing a program enabling a<br>
computer to execute a process for changing the method of replacing<br>
the dots forming an outline part of an image based on factors that<br>
affect dot formation position or the amount of deviation from a<br>
dot formation position on a medium (detection data or data input<br>
from outside), the method of the dot replacement (correction<br>
method) can be changed when dot formation position deviation<br>
occurs so that outline correction can be performed without being<br>
adversely affected by the dot formation position deviation.<br>
Thereby, image quality can be prevented from degrading.<br>
Furthermore, by installing the program on a<br>
computer-readable recording medium 500, a program enabling the<br>
method of the dot replacement (correction method) to be changed<br>
when dot formation position deviation occurs can be provided so<br>
that outline correction can be performed without being adversely<br><br>
affected by the dot formation position deviation. Thereby, image<br>
quality can be prevented from degrading.<br>
Furthermore, by providing an image forming method for<br>
changing the method of replacing the dots forming an outline part<br>
of an image based on factors that affect dot formation position<br>
or the amount of deviation from a dot formation position on a medium<br>
(detection data or data input from outside), the method of the<br>
dot replacement (correction method) can be changed when dot<br>
formation position deviation occurs so that outline correction<br>
can be performed without being adversely affected by the dot<br>
formation position deviation. Thereby, image quality can be<br>
prevented from degrading.<br>
It is to be noted that the image forming apparatus<br>
1000 according to an embodiment of the present invention may<br>
include a function to display the status of the image formina<br>
apparatus 1000 or a method of improving the image forming apparatus<br>
1000 to the user or administrator of the image forming apparatus<br>
1000 via an apparatus (e.g., display apparatus, host computer<br>
(data processing apparatus)) connected to the image forming<br>
apparatus 1000 based on various data such as temperature, humidity,<br>
and dot impact data (data related to deviation of dot formation<br>
position).<br>
For example, in a case where an effective outline<br>
correction performance (e.g., jaggy reduction effect) cannot be<br>
realized even by applying the correction patterns stored<br><br>
beforehand in the image forming apparatus 1000 due to temperature,<br>
humidity, dot impact data (data related to deviation of dot<br>
formation position) , or other factors that cause deviation of dot<br>
formation position, the image forming apparatus 1000 may be<br>
informed with data related to the inability to realize an effective<br>
correction performance via the control panel 214 of the image<br>
forming apparatus 1000 or a printer driver of a data processing<br>
apparatus on the host side.<br>
For example, the data related to the inability to<br>
realize an effective correction performance may include data<br>
notifying that the image forming apparatus 1000 is in such state,<br>
data indicating ambient/printing conditions (ambient temperature,<br>
ambient humidity, resolution, deviation amount) , data indicating<br>
the status of the image forming apparatus 1000, data including<br>
information for improving the performance of the image forming<br>
apparatus 1000 such as messages advising change of<br>
ambient/printing conditions, maintenance information (e.g., head<br>
cleaning, head adjustment), and help/support service<br>
information.<br>
With the above-described display function, the user<br>
can be informed (persuaded) to adjust various settings and ambient<br>
conditions and perform other adjustment (e.g., calibration) for<br>
improving the performance of the image forming apparatus 1000<br>
including elimination of dot formation position deviation<br>
according to various conditions.<br><br>
The image forming apparatus 1000 may also include a<br>
function to report the above-described data related to the<br>
inability to realize an effective correction performance to a<br>
support service of the image forming apparatus 1000.<br>
With the reporting function, the support service can<br>
promptly and automatically detect failure of the image forming<br>
apparatus 1000.<br>
Thus, owing to the above-described functions, not<br>
only can the image forming apparatus 1000 achieve optimum outline<br>
correction according to various conditions but can also receive<br>
various support for maintaining satisfactory performance.<br>
Although the above-described image forming apparatus<br>
is explained having a configuration of a printer, the present<br>
invention may also be applied to an image forming apparatus having<br>
a configuration of a facsimile machine, a plottina apparatus, a<br>
copier, or a multifunction machine having the functions of a<br>
printer,- a facsimile, and a copier, for example.<br>
In the above-described embodiments of the present<br>
invention, a dot (pixel) of an image is not limited to a dot (pixel)<br>
that is formed by a single type of recording liquid (ink) . That<br>
is, a dot of an image may be formed by forming plural types of<br>
recording liquid (ink) to a single position. Therefore, a dot<br>
(pixel) can be formed by jetting one or more droplets to a single<br>
position on a medium. Furthermore, in the above-described<br>
embodiments of the present invention, unless described as<br><br>
otherwise, brightness (dot brightness) refers to the brightness<br>
that is defined by a dot itself. That'is, brightness does not<br>
include brightness of a covered area when viewed from a broad<br>
(macro) perspective unless described as otherwise. Furthermore,<br>
in the above-described embodiments of the present invention, a<br>
character may be a letter, a symbol, or a thin line. For example,<br>
a black character may include a thin black line. Furthermore,<br>
in the above-described embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
term "change" may include not only the meaning "change" but also<br>
a meaning "replace", "correct", or "correct". Furthermore, in<br>
the above-described embodiments of the present invention, among<br>
the dots that form an outline part, the dots which are not corrected<br>
