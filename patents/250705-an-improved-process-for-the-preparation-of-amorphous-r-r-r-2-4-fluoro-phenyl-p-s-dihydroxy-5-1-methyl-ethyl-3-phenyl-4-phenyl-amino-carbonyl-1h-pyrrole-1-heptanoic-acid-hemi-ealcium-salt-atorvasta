AN IMPROVED PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF AMORPHOUS [R-(R*,R*)-2-(4.FLUOROPHENYL)-p,5 DIHYDROXY-5-(l-METHYL ETHYL)-3-PHENYL-4"[(PHENYL AMINO)CARBONYL)-lH-PYRROI.F-l-HEPTANOir ACID HEMI CALCIUM SALT (AMORPHOUS ATORVASTATIN CALCIUM)<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of amoiphous<br>
[R-(R*, R*)]-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-p, 5-dihydroxy-5-(l-methylethyl)-3- phenyl-4- [(phenyl amino)carbonyl]-lH-pyrrole-l-heptanoic acid hemi calcium salt (Amorphous Atorvastatin calcium salt), which is represented by the following Figurel.<br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to pro'cess for the preparation amoiphous Atorvastatin calcium salt which is known by the chemical name [R-(R*, R*)]-2-(4-fluorophenyl)-p, 5-<br>
dihydroxy-5-(l-methylethyl)-3- phenyl-4- [(phenyl amino)carbonyl]-lH-pyn'ole-l-heptanoic acid hemi calcium salt.<br>
United States Patent 5, 273, 995, describes that R-form of Ihc ring opened acid Ibnn inhibits  the  biosynthesis  of cholesterol.   Atorvastatin   in   its  calcium   saU   form,   i.e.<br><br>
amorphous[R- (R*, R*) ]- 2-(4-fluorophenyl)-ss, 6-dihydroxy-5-(I-melhylethyl)-3-phenyl-4-[(phenylamino) carbonyl3-l H-pyn-ole-t-heptanoic acid hemi calcium sail (2:1) is discussed in literature.<br>
PCT application, WO 97/03960, describes a procedure for converting crystalline form of Atorvastatin to amorphous foirn. Process disclosed therein describes dissolving crystalline Atorvastatin in non-hydroxylic solvent like tetrahydrofuran or mixtures of tetrahydrofuran and toluene. The process involves complete removal of solvent under high temperature (about 90^^C) and high vacuum (about 5 mm) using capital-intensive equipment. Exposure of the material for several days leads to the degradation of the product. This renders the process inconvenient to operate at a large scale. Slow removal of the solvents at a manufacturing scale makes the process less cost effective and productive. Furthermore the amorphous form disclosed in this patent has drawback, as it contains high Residual Solvent content like toluene and tetrahydrofuran even after 4 days drying, use or distillation of tetrahydrofuran at commercial scale may result in hazardous as explosion.<br>
PCT application, WO 00/71116 Al discloses a process for the preparation of amorphous form of Atorvastatin calcium. The process involves dissolving crystalline Atoi-vastatin calcium in tetrahydrofuran at ambient temperature and regeneration of the compound by adding an anti-solvent such as n-hexane, n-heptane and cyclohexane. The disadvantage of the above process is primarily the use of environmentally unsound solvents. Furthermore, it involves the usage of mixture of solvents which is not effective process at scale-up, as the column distillation is required to recycle the solvent thus rendering the process high manufacturing cost apart from being dangerous.<br><br>
PCT application, WO 01/28999 Al discloses a process for the preparation oi' amorphous form of Atorvastatin calcium. The patent describes the process for the preparation of amorphous foim of Atorvastatin calcium by recryslaili/alioii of crude Atorvastatin, which comprises dissolving the crude Atorvastatin in isopropanol or ethanol or a mixture of both at boiling point of the solvent and isolation by filtering the precipitated amorphous form of Atoi-vastatin at low temperature. The process involves the usage of mixture of solvents, high volume of solvents and hence the process is not cost effective at commercial scale.<br>
PCT application, WO 01/42209 discloses a process for the preparation of amorphous form of Atoi*vastatin starting from Atorvastatin, which comprises dissolving the compound in Type-I solvent (i.e, freely soluble solvent) and regenerating the amoi-phous form of Atorvastatin by adding Type-II solvent (i.e, sparingly soluble or insoluble solvent). The disadvantage of the process is the conversion of crystalline Atorvastatin to amorphous form of Atorvastatin, that indicates firstly the generation of crystalline Atorvastatin, which in turn is converted to amorphous form of Atorvastatin. PCT application, WO 02/059087 Al discloses a process for preparation of noncrystalline form of Atorvastatin calcium salt, which comprises dissolving the intermediate of atorvastatin in non-hydroxylic solvent and the protected groups were hydrolyzed using HCl followed by NaOH, and after completion of the reaction the solution was concentrated under vaccume, and made the calcium salt, and after stirring for 1 hour placed in the refrigerator for 2 hours, formed precipitate was filtered and dried to get the amorphous atorvastatin calcium salt, the disadvantage of this invention is slow conversion to the noncrystalline form, that is conversion of dihydroxy protected<br><br>
and carboxylic acid protected compound to atorvastatin is slow, and drying involves more time.<br>
PCT application, WO 03078379 Al discloses a process for preparation of Atorvaslatin calcium which involves, heterogeneous mixture of atorvastatin added to methanol and resulting mixture was freeze dried or spray dried to get the amorphous form, the disadvantage of this process is freeze drying is very difficult to perform on large scale. PCT application, WO 03/018547 A2 discloses a process for the preparation of amoiphous form of Atorvastatin calcium salt which involves, dissolution of crystalline atorvastatin calciuni in solvent like methylene chloride and after concentrating the reaction mass filtered and added to precooled diisopropylether and after completing the addition, filtered product and dried under vaccume to get the amorphous form. The disadvantage of this process is the usage of chloro solvent which are not ecofriendly and the   conversion of crystalline foiTn into amorphous foim, indicates firstly the generation<br>
of crystalline Atorvastatin calcium salt which in turn converted to amorphous atorvastatin calcium salt.<br>
PCT application, WO 03/068739 Al discloses a process for the preparation of amorphous form of atorvastatin calcium salt, which involves hydrolysis of dihydroxy protected and carboxylic acid protected atorvastatin in acidic hydrolysis followed by alkaline hydrolysis and after optional acidification and extracted with solvent and made calcium salt and later precipitated and obtained compound dried under vaccume to get the amorphous atorvastatin calcium salt, the disadvantage of this process is multistcps arc involved in the synthesis of amoiphous atorvastatin calcium salt, and this process is not suitable for pharma application.<br><br>
wo 02083637 Al  discloses a process  for the preparation o( amorphous alorvastaiin<br>
calcium salt, which comprises suspension of diol protected tert butyl ester in methanol<br>
and hydrolysed the both protecting groups using acidic and basic conditions and after<br>
completion of the reaction the P" adjusted to 8.5 and concentrated the reaction mixlurc<br>
and added specified volumes of methanol and water, washed with diisopropyl ether and<br>
made Calcium salt using calcium chloride solution, and filtered and dried to get the<br>
amorphous atorvastatin calcium salt, the disadvantage of this invention is specific ratio of<br>
methanol and water are to be maintained which is difficult in industrial scale up.<br>
Nevertheless, the process for the production of amorphous atorvastatin calcium salt is desirable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

preparation of amorphous atorvastatin calcium salt, which eliminates the problems oi^ prior art and is convenient to operate on a commercial scale, and also involves ecofriendly process over the prior art.<br>
