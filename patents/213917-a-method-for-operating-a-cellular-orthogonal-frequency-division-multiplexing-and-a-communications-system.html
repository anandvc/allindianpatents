ORTHOGONAL FREQUENCY DIVISION MULTIPLEXING BASED SPREAD<br>
SPECTRUM MULTIPLE ACCESS<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based spread spectrum multiple access such as may be used in wireless, and other, communication systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
It is desired that wireless communication systems be as efficient as possible to maximize a) the number of users that can be served and b) the data rates, if data service is provided. Wireless systems are shared media systems, i.e., there is a fixed available bandwidth that must be shared among all the users of the system. These systems are often implemented as so-called 'cellular" systems, where the covered territory is divided into separate cells, and each cell is served by a base station.<br>
It is well known in the art that the two particularly desirable features of a cellular wireless system are 1) that the intracell interference, i.e., interference experienced by one user that is caused by other users that are within the same cell as that user, be as small as possible, and 2) that the intercell interference, i.e., interference experienced by one user that is caused by other users that are in cells other than the one in which the user is located, is averaged across all users in neighboring cells; Most prior art digital cellular systems are time division multiple access (TDMA) systems, such as group special mobile (GSM)-, intermediate standard (IS)-136-, or IS-54-based systems, or they are code division multiple access (CDMA) systems, e.g., IS-95 based systems.<br>
In prior art narrow band TDMA systems neighboring base stations use different, e.g., non-overlapping, parts of the available spectrum. However, bases stations that are sufficiently far away from each other to avoid substantial interference between them, i.e., non-neighboring base stations, may use the same parts of the available spectrum. Notwithstanding such spectrum reuse, the spectrum available for use in each cell is a small part of the total available spectrum. Each user in a cell has its own unique frequency band and time slot combination, and hence TDMA systems have no intracell interference, i.e., they have the first desirable feature of cellular wireless systems. However, TDMA systems do not have the second desirable feature, in that a given user only interferes with a small number of users outside the cell, so that spectral reuse is<br><br>
based on worst case interference rather than average interference. As a result, the system has a low "spectral" efficiency.<br>
In prior art direct sequence (DS)-CDMA systems the entire bandwidth is used by each base station but each base station uses a different spreading code. Such CDMA systems promise higher spectral efficiency than narrow band TDMA systems. Thus, CDMA systems have the second desirable feature of a cellular wireless system. However, CDMA systems do not have the first desirable feature of a cellular wireless system because although the signals transmitted from the base station within a cell are orthogonal, because of channel dispersion, the signals received at a receiver are not necessarily orthogonal. This results in interference between users within the same cell.<br>
Proposed prior art frequency hopping (FH)-CDMA systems are very similar to narrow band TDMA systems, except that they employ frequency hopping to also obtain the second desirable feature of a cellular wireless system. In particular, each transmitter transmits a narrow band signal, and periodically changes the carrier frequency to achieve the frequency hopping. However, disadvantageously, such hopping is relatively slow, reducing the amount of averaging that can be achieved for a given delay in the transmission path that the system can tolerate.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,410,538 issued to Roche et al. on April 25, 1995 discloses a multi-tone CDMA system. Such a system is essentially an OFDM system that eliminates intracell interference by insuring that the received signals within a cell are orthogonal. Thus, the Roche et al. system has both desirable features of a cellular wireless system. However, the Roche et al. system partitions the spectrum into a large number of tones, which makes the system very susceptible to Doppler shifts in mobile systems. Also, because each mobile user transmits on a large number of tones, the peak-to-average ratio of the mobile transmitter is very high, resuhing in poor power efficiency at the mobile station, which is disadvantageous in that power is often a limited resource in the mobile station.<br>
United States Patent No. 5,548,582 issued to Brajal et al. on August 20, 1996 discloses a general wide-band orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based spread spectrum multiple access.<br>
We have recognized in United States Patent Application Serial No. (Case Laroia 9-1-1) that the Brajal et al. system is not optimized for use in a cellular system in that there is no teaching therein how to optimize a) the hopping pattern, b) the tone assignment, or c) the bandwidth reuse. We have further recognized that optimizing these factors, individually and/or collectively, is important to obtain a spectrally efficient system, i.e., a system that has the two particularly desirable features of a cellular wireless<br><br>
system. In particular, we disclosed in United States Patent Application Serial No. (Case Laroia 9-1-1) dividing the entire bandwidth into orthogonal tones, and reusing all of the orthogonal tones in each cell To reduce peak-to-average ratio at the mobile transmitter, low bit rate user, such as a voice user, is allocated preferably a single one, but no more than a very small number, of the orthogonal tones for use in communicating with the base station. Data users are similarly allocated tones for data communication. However, the number of tones assigned for each data particular user is a function of the data rate for that user. The tone assignment for a given user is not always the same within the available band, but instead the tones assigned to each user are hopped over time.<br>
A tone hopping pattem was disclosed that achieves maximum frequency diversity and averages the intercell interference, e.g., using a pattem that is a function of a mutually orthogonal latin square. More specifically, in the downlink, i.e., in the channel from the base station to the mobile station, the tones assigned to each user are change relatively rapidly, e.g., from symbol to symbol, i.e., the user fast "hops" from one tone to another. However, in the uplink, i.e., in the channel from the mobile station to the base station, although fast hopping is possible, preferably slow hopping is employed to allow efficient modulation of the uplink signal. However, when slow hopping is used in the uplink, it is necessary to employ additional techniques, such as interleaving, to compensate for the reduction in the intercell interference averaging effect.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
We have recognized that notwithstanding the foregoing advancements, additional improvements are yet necessary to achieve spectrally efficient system, i.e., a system that has the two particularly desirable features of a cellular wireless system. One such improvement, in accordance with the principles of the invention, is the use of offsetting between cells, and in particular, the use of tone offsetting and time offsetting. More specifically, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, frequencies that define the tone set of one cell is offset fi-om the frequencies that define the tone set of at least one adjacent cell. In other words, if a first base station is using tones F1, F2, ..., FN within a frequency band, then a second base station adjacent to the first base station uses tones F,+Af,F2+Af...,FN+Af within the same frequency band. In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the symbol timing of the base-station of one cell is offset from the symbol timing of the base-station of an adjacent cell. Thus, if a first base station starts successive symbols at times Tl, T2, and T3, then a second base station adjacent to the first base station starts its respective corresponding successive symbols at times Tl+At, T2+At, and T3+At. For example, in a cellular system with hexagonaliy shaped cells, the<br><br>
tone sets of two adjacent cells are offset by 1/3 of the spacing between adjacent tones, and the symbol timings of two adjacent cells are offset by 1/3 of a symbol period. Advantageously, the intercell interference is more uniformly distributed among users in a cell.<br>

Applicant thus regards any means which can provide those functionalities as equivalent as those shown herein*<br>
Before describing the invention it is necessary to understand generally the environment in which the invention operates, namely, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems.<br><br>
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems employ orthogonal tones within a frequency bandwidth to transmit data from different users at the same time. In particular, for any particular symbol period T which is available for symbol transmission, and a given bandwidth W, the number of available orthogonal tones N, is given by WT. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, the same bandwidth W is reused in each cell. The spacing between the orthogonal tones is A, which is given by 1/T. In addition to the symbol period T which is available for symbol transmission, an additional time Tc is required for transmission of a cyclic prefix, which is prepended to each symbol period and is used to compensate for the dispersion introduced by the channel response and the pulse shaping filter used at the transmitter. Thus, although a total period of T+Tc is employed, only T is available for user data transmission.<br>
FIG. 1 shows an example of available orthogonal tones at one cell with a spacing of A within a bandwidth W. FIG. 2 shows a time domain view of the symbol period T which is available for symbol transmission, and the additional time Tc required for transmission of the cyclic prefix. Note that within each symbol period T data may be sent on each of the tones substantially simultaneously. Also, the last portion of the data symbol period T is often employed as the cyclic prefix in manner shown in FIG. 2.<br>
FIG. 3 shows a block diagram of exemplary OFDM transmitter 301. Because of its high level, whether or not the diagram of FIG. 3 depicts a prior art OFDM transmitter or an OFDM in accordance with the principles of the invention depends on the particular implementation of the various components of FIG, 3. Also, OFDM transmitter 301 may be used in either a base station as the downlink transmitter or in a mobile station as an uplink transmitter. The particular embodiments necessary for either application will be described more fully hereinbelow.<br>
OFDM transmitter 301 includes a) encoder 303, b) data-to-tone applier 305, c) tone assignment unit 307, and d) cyclic prefix prepender 309.<br>
Encoder 303 receives an overall information stream for transmission from a source and encodes it according to a particular encoding scheme. Such overall information stream typically includes information streams generated on behalf of more than one user if OFDM transmitter 301 is being used in a base station and only includes information streams for one user if OFDM transmitter 301 is being used in a mobile station. The encoding scheme employed may vary whether the information being transmitted in a particular information stream is voice or data. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be able to 1) select, e.g., traditional convolutional or block coding, or 2) devise, appropriate encoding schemes as a function of the model of the interference environment in which the OFDM system is being deployed.<br><br>
Data-to-tone applier 305 modulates the overall encoded information stream supplied as an output from encoder 303 onto the various available tones. For each particular encoded information stream within the overall encoded information stream at least one tone is assigned by tone assignment unit 307, and that tone is used to modulate the particular encoded information stream received from encoder 303. If a particular encoded information stream is voice then, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, preferably a single one, but no more than a very small number, of the orthogonal tones are assigned for particular encoded information stream. If a particular encoded information stream is data then, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, the number of orthogonal tones assigned that particular encoded information stream is a function of the data rate for the user of that particular encoded information stream.<br>
Tones are assigned to each encoded information stream by tone assignment unit 307, which conveys the assignments to data-to-tone applier 305. The tone assignment for a given user is not always the same within the available band, but instead the tones assigned to each user are hopped over time by tone assignment unit 307-<br>
Cyclic prefix prepender 309 adds the cyclic prefix to each symbol period as described above. The cyclic prefix is added only for the tones being used by OFDM transmitter 301. Thus, for example, if OFDM transmitter 301 is in a base station using all of the tones, then the cyclic prefix uses all of the available orthogonal tones within bandwidth W. If OFDM transmitter 301 is in a mobile station using only a single one of the tones, then the cyclic prefix uses only that particular single tone. Advantageously, use of the cyclic prefix eliminates the need for equalization at the receiver.<br>
FIG. 4 shows a block diagram of an exemplary OFDM receiver 401. As with FIG. 3 because of its high level, whether or not the diagram of FIG. 4 depicts a prior art OFDM receiver or an OFDM in accordance with the principles of the invention depends on the particular implementation of the various components of FIG. 4. Also, as shown OFDM receiver 401 may be used in either a base station as the downlink receiver or in a mobile station as an uplink receiver. The particular embodiments necessary for either application will be described more fully hereinbelow.<br>
OFDM receiver 401 includes a) cyclic prefix remover 409, b) tone-to-data extractor 405, c) tone assignment u it 407, and d) decoder 403.<br>
The signal received at OFDM receiver 401, e.g., by an antenna and amplifier arrangement, not shown, is supplied to cyclic prefix remover 409, Cyclic prefix remover 409 removes the cyclic prefix from each total period of the received signal. The remaining signal, with period T, is supplied to tone-to-data extactor 405.<br><br>
Tone-to-data extractor 405 extracts each information stream received on the various available tones which are being used by OFDM receiver 401 to develop an overall reconstructed data stream. Tones are assigned for use by OFDM receiver 401 by tone assignment unit 407, which conveys the assignments to data-to-tone remover 405. The tone assignment for a given user is not always the same within the available band, but instead the tones assigned to each user are hopped over time by tone assignment unit 407. As a result, it is necessary that there be correspondence between tone assignment unit 307 of OFDM transmitter 301 and tone assignment unit 407 of an associated OFDM receiver 401, Such correspondence is typically achieved through i priori arrangement, e.g., upon call set up.<br>
Decoder 403 receives an overall information stream from transmission tone-to-data extractor 405 and decodes it to develop an overall output information stream. The decoding is often performed according to the inverse of the scheme used to encode the information stream. However, modifications may be made to the decoding scheme to account for channel and other effects to produce a more reliable decoded output than simply using the inverse of the encoding scheme. Alternatively, specific algorithms may be developed for use in decoding the received signal that take into account channel response, interference, and other effects. Such overall output information stream typically includes information streams generated on behalf of more than one user if OFDM receiver 401 is being used in a base station and only includes information streams for one user if OFDM receiver 401 is being used in a mobile station.<br>
The resulting overall output stream is supplied to a destination for further processing. For example, if the information stream is voice and OFDM receiver 401 is within a mobile station, then the information stream is supplied to be converted to an audible signal that is played for the user. If the information stream is voice and OFDM receiver 401 is within a base station, the voice information may be separated for transmission to the ultimate destination, e.g., via a wireline network.<br>
FIG. 5 shows further details of an exemplary implementation of data-to-tone applier 305 for a base station. Each of multipliers 501 multiplies a particular information stream by a sinusoidal waveform which is one of the orthogonal tones and is generated by tone generator 503. The resulting modulated signals are then summed by adder 505. Typically, data-to-tone applier 305 is implemented digitally, e.g., by a processor performing the functionality of multipliers 501, tone generator 503, and adder 505 using digital representations of the orthogonal tones.<br>
The same general architecture as shown in FIG. 5 may be used to implement data-to-tone applier 305 for a mobile station. However, instead of covering the entire range of<br><br>
N orthogonal tones used within the cell by the base station by having N multipUers, only the maximum number of orthogonal tones used by the mobile station need have available multipliers. Since many mobile stations are used strictly for voice, only one multiplier need be provided. However, since, as will be described in more detail hereinbelow, the tone assignments for each user are changed, it is necessary that the tone generator in a mobile station be able to generate the entire range of N orthogonal tones. Furthermore, if only one tone is used, adder 505 may be dispensed with.<br>
As described above, the tones assigned to any particular information stream is changed periodically. This is known in the art generally as frequency hopping, and is referred to herein more specifically as tone hopping.<br>
The use of the use of offsetting, e.g., tone offsetting and/or time offsetting, between cells, improves the averaging of the feeling of the effects of interference, i.e., the variance of interference power is reduced. More specifically, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, the frequencies that define the tone set of one cell is offset from the frequencies that define the tone set of at least one adjacent cell. In other words, if a first base station is using tones F,, Fj, ..., FN within a fi'equency band, then a second base station adjacent to the first base station uses tones F,+Af, F2+Af, ... Fj^+Af within the same frequency band. This is shown in FIG, 6, in which tone set 601 used within a first cell are spaced from each other by A and each tone of set 601 is displaced by Af from each tone in tone set 603 of an adjacent second cell in accordance with the principles of the invention. In one illustrative example, in a cellular system with hexagonally shaped cells, the tone sets of two adjacent cells are offset by 1/3 of the spacing A between adjacent tones.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention, the symbol timing of the base-station of one cell is offset from the symbol timing of the base-station of an adjacent cell. Thus, if a first base station starts successive symbols at times Tl, T2, and T3, then a second base station adjacent to the first base station starts its respective corresponding successive symbols at times THAt, T2+At, and T3+At. This is shown in FIG. 7, in which successive symbol start times set 701 used within a first cell are displaced by At from each of the corresponding ones of the successive start times in successive symbol start times set 703 of an adjacent second cell, in accordance with the principles of the invention. In one illustrative example, in a cellular system with hexagonally shaped cells, the symbol timings of two adjacent cells are offset by 1/3 of a symbol period. Advantageously, the intercell interference is more uniformly distributed among users in a cell.<br><br>
The principles of this invention yields performance improvement over the prior art even in the event that no hopping is employed.<br><br><br><br><br>
