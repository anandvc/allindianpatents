SUBSTITUTED  DIAZABICYCL.OALKANE DERIVATIVES  AS  LIGANDS  AT  ALPHA 7  NICOTINIC ACETY LCHOLINE RECEPTORS<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to diazabicycloalkane derivatives, compositions comprising such compounds, and methods of treating conditions and disorders using such compounds and compositions.<br>
Description of Related Technology<br>
Nicotinic acetylcholine receptors (nAChRs) are widely distributed throughout the central (CNS) and peripheral (PNS) nervous systems. Such receptors play an important role in regulating CNS function, particularly by modulating release of a wide range of neurotransmitters, including, but not necessarily limited to acetylcholine, norepinephrine, dopamine, serotonin and GABA. Consequently, nicotinic receptors mediate a very wide range of physiological effects, and have been targeted for therapeutic treatment of disorders relating to cognitive function, learning and memory, neurodegeneration, pain and inflammation, psychosis and sensory   . gating, mood and emotion, among others.<br>
Many subtypes of the nAChR exist in the CNS and periphery. Each subtype has a different effect on regulating the overall physiological function. Typically, nAChRs are ion channels that are constructed from a pentameric assembly of subunit proteins. At least 12 subunit proteins, oc2-al0 and p2-p4, have been identified in neuronal tissue. These subunits provide for a great variety of homomeric and heteromeric combinations that account for the diverse receptor subtypes. For example, the predominant receptor that is responsible for high affinity binding of nicotine in brain tissue has composition (a4)2(B2)3 (the a4(52 subtype), while another major population of receptors is comprised of the homomeric (0:7)5 (the a.7 subtype).<br>
Certain compounds, like the plant alkaloid nicotine, interact with all subtypes of the nAChRs, accounting for the profound physiological effects of this compound. While nicotine has been demonstrated to have many beneficial properties, not all of<br><br>
WO 2005/028477	PCT/US2004/030735<br>
the effects mediated by nicotine are desirable. For example, nicotine exerts gastrointestinal and cardiovascular side effects that interfere at therapeutic doses, and its addictive nature and acute toxicity are well-known. Ligands that are selective for interaction with only certain subtypes of the nAChR offer potential for achieving beneficial therapeutic effects with an improved margin for safety.<br>
The a 7 nAChRs have been shown to play a significant role in enhancing cognitive function, including aspects of learning, memory and attention (Levin, E.D., J. Neurobiol. 53: 633-640, 2002). For example, a7 nAChRs have been linked to conditions and disorders related to attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, senile dementia, dementia associated with Lewy bodies, dementia associated with Down's syndrome, AIDS dementia, Pick's Disease, as well as cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia, among other systemic activities. The activity at the a7 nAChRs can be modified or regulated by the administration of cc7 nAChR ligands. The ligands can exhibit antagonist, agonist, partial agonist, or inverse agonist properties. Thus, a7 ligands have potential in treatment of various cognitive disorders.<br>
Although various classes of compounds demonstrating ct7 nAChR-modulating activity exist, it would be beneficial to provide additional compounds demonstrating activity at the <x7 nachrs that can be incorporated into pharmaceutical compositions useful for therapeutic methods. specifically it would beneficial to provide compounds interact selectively with cc7-containing neuronal compared other subtypes.></x7>

Compounds of the invention may exist as stereoisomers wherein, asymmetric or chiral centers are present. These stereoisomers are "R" or "S" depending on the configuration of substituents around the chiral element. The terms "R" and "S" used herein are configurations as defined in IUPAC 1974 Recommendations for Section E, Fundamental Stereochemistry, Pure Appl. Chem., 1976, 45:13-30. The invention contemplates various stereoisomers and mixtures thereof and are specifically included within the scope of this invention. Stereoisomers include enantiomers and<br><br>
WO 2005/028477	PCT/US2004/030735<br>
diastereomers, and mixtures of enantiomers or diastereomers. Individual stereoisomers of compounds of the invention may be prepared synthetically from commercially available starting materials which contain asymmetric or chiral centers or by preparation of racemic mixtures followed by resolution well-known to those of ordinary skill in the art. These methods of resolution are exemplified by (1) attachment of a mixture of enantiomers to a chiral auxiliary, separation of the resulting mixture of diastereomers by recrystallization or chromatography and optional liberation of the optically pure product from the auxiliary as described in Furniss, Hannaford, Smith, and Tatchell, "Vogel's Textbook of Practical Organic Chemistry", 5th edition (1989), Longman Scientific &amp; Technical, Essex CM20 2JE, England, or (2) direct separation of the mixture of optical enantiomers on chiral chromatographic columns or (3) fractional recrystallization methods.<br>

For example, a compound may be reacted with an acid at or above room temperature to provide the desired salt, which is deposited, and collected by filtration after cooling. Examples of acids suitable for the reaction include, but are not limited to tartaric acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, as well as mandelic, atrolactic, methanesulfonic, ethanesulfonic, toluenesulfonic, naphthalenesulfonic, carbonic, fumaric, gluconic, acetic, propionic, salicylic, hydrochloric, hydrobromic, phosphoric, sulfuric, citric, or hydroxybutyric acid, camphorsulfonic, malic, phenylacetic, aspartic, glutamic, and the like.<br>
Compositions of the Invention<br>
The invention also provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) in combination with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The compositions comprise compounds of the invention formulated together with one or more non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The pharmaceutical compositions can be formulated for oral<br><br>
WO 2005/028477	PCT/US2004/030735<br>
administration in solid or liquid form, for parenteral injection or for rectal administration.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable carrier," as used herein, means a nontoxic, inert solid, semi-solid or liquid filler, diluent, encapsulating material or formulation auxiliary of any type. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically acceptable carriers are sugars such as lactose, glucose and sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate; powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatin; talc; cocoa butter and suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil, safflower oil, sesame oil, olive oil, corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such a propylene glycol; esters such as ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogen-free water; isotonic saline; Ringer's solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the composition, according to the judgment of one skilled in the art of formulations.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of this invention can be administered to humans and other mammals orally, rectally, parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by powders, ointments or drops), bucally or as an oral or nasal spray. The term "parenterally," as used herein, refers to modes of administration, including intravenous, intramuscular, intraperitoneal, intrasternal, subcutaneous, intraarticular injection and infusion.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions for parenteral injection comprise pharmaceutically acceptable sterile aqueous or nonaqueous solutions, dispersions, suspensions or emulsions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. Examples of suitable aqueous and nonaqueous carriers, diluents, solvents or vehicles include water, ethanol, polyols (propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, and the like, and suitable mixtures thereof), vegetable oils (such as olive oil) and injectable organic esters such as ethyl oleate, or suitable mixtures thereof. Suitable fluidity of the composition may be maintained, for<br><br>
WO 2005/028477	PCT/US2004/030735<br>
example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersions, and by the use of surfactants.<br>
These compositions<br>
 can also contain adjuvants such as preservative agents, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and dispersing agents. Prevention of the action of microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. It also can be desirable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride and the like. Prolonged absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
In some cases, in order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This can be accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension of crystalline or amorphous material with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug can depend upon its rate of dissolution, which, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form. Alternatively, a parenterally administered drug form can be administered by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle.<br>
Suspensions, in addition to the active compounds, can contain suspending agents, for example, ethoxylated isostearyl alcohols, polyoxyethylene sorbitol and sorbitan esters, microcrystalline cellulose, aluminum metahydroxide, bentonite, agar-agar, tragacanth, and mixtures thereof.<br>
If desired, and for more effective distribution, the compounds of the invention can be incorporated into slow-release or targeted-delivery systems such as polymer matrices, liposomes, and microspheres. They may be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacteria-retaining filter or by incorporation of sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions, which may be dissolved in sterile water or some other sterile injectable medium immediately before use.<br>
Injectable depot forms are made by forming microencapsulated matrices of the drug in biodegradable polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides) Depot injectable<br>
A -I<br><br>
&gt;--<br><br>
WO 2005/028477	PCT/US2004/030735<br>
formulations also are prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are compatible with body tissues.<br>
The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration through a bacterial-retaining filter or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved.or dispersed in sterile water or other sterile injectable medium just prior to use.<br>
Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspensions can be formulated according to the known art using suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation also can be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic, parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent such as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of injectables.<br>
Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets, pills, powders, and granules.

In the case of . capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br><br>
WO 2005/028477	PCT/US2004/030735<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using lactose or milk sugar as well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols.<br>
The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well-known in the pharmaceutical formulating art. They can optionally contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract in a delayed manner. Examples of materials useful for delaying release of the active agent can include polymeric substances and waxes.<br>
Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with suitable non-irritating carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active compound.<br>
Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsipns, solutions, suspensions, syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, corn, germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol, polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Besides inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents, emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>

Liposomes are formed by mono- or multilamellar hydrated liquid crystals that are dispersed in an aqueous medium. Any nontoxic, physiologically acceptable and metabolizable lipid capable of forming liposomes may be used. The present compositions in liposome form may contain, in addition to the compounds of the invention, stabilizers, preservatives, and the like. The preferred lipids are the natural and synthetic phospholipids and phosphatidylcholines (lecithins) used separately or together.<br>
Methods to form liposomes are known in the art. See, for example, Prescott, Ed., Methods in Cell Biology, Volume XIV, Academic Press, New York, N. Y., (1976), p 33 et seq.<br>
Dosage forms for topical administration of a compound of this invention include powders, sprays, ointments and inhalants. The active compound is mixed under sterile conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives, buffers or propellants. Ophthalmic formulations, eye ointments, powders and solutions are also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Aqueous liquid compositions of the invention also are particularly useful.<br>

Methods of the Invention<br>
Compounds and compositions of the invention are useful for modulating the effects of nAChRs, and more particularly ct7 nAChRs. In particular, the compounds and compositions of the invention can be used for treating and preventing disorders<br><br>
WO 2005/028477	PCT/US2004/030735<br>
modulated by a7 nAChRs. Typically, such disorders can be ameliorated by selectively modulating the a7 nAChRs in a mammal, preferably by administering a compound or composition of the invention, either alone or in combination with another active agent, for example, as part of a therapeutic regimen.<br>
The compounds of the invention, including but not limited to those specified in the examples, possess an affinity for nAChRs, and more particularly a7 nAChRs. As cc7 nAChRs ligands, the compounds of the invention can be useful for the treatment and prevention of a number of oc7 nAChR-mediated diseases or conditions.<br>
For example, ct7 nAChRs have been shown to play a significant role in enhancing cognitive function, including aspects of learning, memory and attention (Levin, E.D., J. Neurobiol. 53: 633-640, 2002). As such, a7 ligands are suitable for the treatment of cognitive disorders including, for example, attention deficit disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), Alzheimer's disease (AD), mild cognitive impairment, senile dementia, AIDS dementia, Pick's Disease, dementia associated with Lewy bodies, and dementia associated with Down's syndrome, as well as cognitive deficits associated with schizophrenia.<br>
In addition, a7-containing nAChRs have been shown to be involved in the neuroprotective effects of nicotine both in vitro (Jonnala, R. B. and Buccafusco, J. J., J. Neurosci. Res. 66: 565-572, 2001) and in vivo (Shimohama, S. et al., Brain Res. 779: 359-363, 1998). More particularly, neurodegeneration underlies several progressive CNS disorders, including, but not limited to, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, Huntington's disease, dementia with Lewy bodies, as well as diminished CNS function resulting from traumatic brain injury. For example, the impaired function of a7 nAChRs by f5-amyloid peptides linked to Alzheimer's disease has been implicated as a key factor in development of the cognitive deficits associated with the disease (Liu, Q.-S., Kawai, H., Berg, D. K., PNAS 98: 4734-4739, 2001). The activation of a7 nAChRs has been shown to block this neurotoxicity (Kihara, T. et al., J. Biol. Chem. 276:13541-13546, 2001). As such, selective ligands that enhance a7 activity can counter the deficits of Alzheimer's and other neu-odegenerative diseases.<br><br>
WO 2005/028477	PCT/US2004/030735<br>
Parkinson's disease is characterized by muscular rigidity, tremor, and bradykinesia. Epidemiologic studies have long demonstrated that cigarette-smoking subjects have lower risk of parkinsonism than nonsmerkers (Baron, J. A. Neurology 36: 1490-1496,1986). Moreover, direct administration of nicotine has been shown to improve tremor in Parkinson's patients. At least part of the beneficial effect of nicotine is thought to involve neuroprotection, a feature that is now understood to be mediated by a7 neuronal nAChRs (Jonnala, R. R., Buccausco, J. J. J. Neurosci. Res. 66: 565-571,2001).<br>
Schizophrenia is a complex disease that is characterized by abnormalities in perception, cognition, and emotions. Significant evidence implicates the involvement of oc7 nAChRs in this disease, including a measured deficit of these receptors in post-mortem patients (Leonard, S. Eur. J. Pharmacol. 393: 237-242, 2000).   Deficits in sensory processing (gating) are one of the hallmarks of schizophrenia. These deficits can be normalized by nicotinic ligands that operate at the a7 nAChR (Adler L. E. et al., Schizophrenia Bull. 24: 189-202,1998; Stevens, K. E. et al., Psychopharmacology 136: 320-327, 1998). Thus, oc7 ligands demonstrate potential in the treatment schizophrenia.<br>
Angiogenesis, a process involved in the growth of new blood vessels, is important in beneficial systemic functions, such as wound healing, vascularization of skin grafts, and enhancement of circulation, for example, increased circulation around a vascular occlusion. Non-selective nAChR agonists like nicotine have been shown to stimulate angiogenesis (Heeschen, C. et al., Nature Medicine 7: 833-839, 2001). Improved angiogenesis has been shown to involve activation of the oc7 nAChR (Heeschen, C. et al, J. Clin. Invest. 110: 527-536, 2002). Therefore, nAChR ligands that are selective for the a7 subtype offer improved potential for stimulating angiogenesis with an improved side effect profile.<br>
A population of a7 nAChRs in the spinal cord modulate serotonergic transmission that have been associated with the pain-relieving effects of nicotinic compounds (Cordero-Erausquin, M. and Changeux, J.-P. PNAS 98:2803-2807, 2001). The a7 nAChR ligands demonstrate therapeutic potential for the treatment of pain states, including acute pain, post-surgical pain, as well as chronic pain states including inflammatory pain and neuropathic pain. Moreover, a7 nAChRs are<br><br>
WO 2005/028477	PCT/US2004/030735<br>
expressed on the surface of primary macrophages that are involved in the inflammation response, and that activation of the a.7 receptor inhibits release of TNF and other cytokines that trigger the inflammation response (Wang, H. et al Nature 421: 384-388, 2003). Therefore, selective a.7 ligands demonstrate potential for treating conditions involving inflammation and pain.<br>
The mammalian sperm acrosome reaction is an exocytosis process important in fertilization of the ovum by sperm. Activation of an a7 nAChR on the sperm cell has been shown to be essential for the acrosome reaction (Son, J.-H. and Meizel, S. Biol. Reproduct. 68:1348-1353 2003). Consequently, selective a7 agents demonstrate utility for treating fertility disorders.<br>
Compounds of the invention are particularly useful for treating and preventing a condition or disorder affecting cognition, neurodegeneration, and schizophrenia. Cognitive impairment associated with schizophrenia often limits the ability of patients to normally function, a symptom not adequately treated by commonly available treatments, for example, treatment with an atypical antipsychotic. (Rowley, M. et al., J. Med. Chem. 44: 477-501, 2001). Such cognitive deficit has been linked to dysfunction of the nicotinic cholinergic system, in particular with decreased activity at a.7 receptors. (Friedman, J. I. et al., Biol Psychiatry, 51: 349-357, 2002). Thus, activators of a.7 receptors can provide useful treatment for enhancing cognitive function in schizophrenic patients who are being treated with atypical antipsychotics. Accordingly, the combination of an al nAChR ligand and an atypical antipsychotic would offer improved therapeutic utility.

When used in the above or other treatments, a therapeutically effective amount of one of the compounds of the invention can be employed in pure form or, where such forms exist, in pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, amide or prodrug form. Alternatively, the compound can be administered as a pharmaceutical composition containing the compound of interest in combination with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers. The phrase "therapeutically effective amount" of the compound of the invention means a sufficient amount of the compound to treat disorders, at a reasonable benefit/risk ratio applicable to any medical treatment. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of the compounds and compositions of the invention will be decided by the attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the disorder; activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental with the specific compound employed; and like factors well-known in the medical arts. For example, it is well within the skill of the art to start doses of the compound at levels lower than required to achieve the desired therapeutic effect and to gradually increase the dosage until the desired effect is achieved.<br>
The total daily dose of the compounds of this invention administered to a human or lower animal range from about 0.10 mg/kg body weight to about 1 g/kg body weight. More preferable doses can be in the range of from'about 0.10 mg/kg body weight to about 100 mg/kg body weight. If desired, the effective daily dose can be divided into multiple doses for purposes of administration. Consequently, single dose compositions may contain such amounts or submultiples thereof to make up the daily dose.<br><br>

Method PD: A solution of the N-benzy) or Cbz-protected amine (1 mmol) in ethanol (10 mL) was stirred with Pd/C (100 mg, 10 wt%) under hydrogen (1-4 atm) at ambient temperature for 2-4 h. The mixture was purged with nitrogen, filtered through diatomaceous earth, and concentrated to give the free amine.<br>
General Procedures for N-Methvlation<br>
Method EC: The Boc-protected or free amine (1 mmol) was combined with 36% aqueous formalin (1-2 mmol) and 88% formic acid (1-5 mL) was added. The mixture was warmed to 100 °C for 1 -2 h, then cooled to room temperature and concentrated under vacuum. The residue was purified by column chromatography chromatography (eluting with MeOH - CH2CI2 - NH4OH (10 : 90 :1)) to provide the N-methylated free base, which was converted to a salt by one of procedures S1 -S5.<br>
Method RA: The free amine (1 mmol) and NaBH(OAc)3 (1 mmol) in 36% aqueous formalin (10-20 mL) was stirred at ambient temperature for 5 - 20 h. The mixture was quenched with saturated, aqueous NaHC03 (25 mL), extracted with CH2CI2 (3 x 25 mL), dried (Na2S04) and concentrated under reduced pressure. The residue was purified by column chromatography (eluting with MeOH - CH2CI2 - NH4OH (10 : 90 : 1)) to provide the N-methylated free base, which was converted to a salt by one of procedures S1 - S5.<br>

r3H1-Methvlvcaconitine (MLA) binding<br>
Binding conditions were similar to those for [3H]-cytisine binding. Membrane enriched fractions from rat brain minus cerebellum (ABS Inc., Wilmington, DE) were slowly thawed at 4 °C, washed and resuspended in 30 volumes of BSS-Tris buffer (120 mM NaCI, 5 mM KCI, 2 mM CaCI2, 2 mM MgCI2, and 50 mM Tris-CI, pH 7.4, 22 °C). Samples containing 100-200 ug of protein, 5 nM [3H]-MLA (25 Cj/mmol; Perkin Elmer/NEN Life Science Products, Boston, MA) and 0.1% bovine serum albumin (BSA, Millipore, Bedford, MA) were incubated in a final volume of 500 uL for 60 minutes at 22 °C. Seven log-dilution concentrations of each compound were tested in duplicate. Non-specific binding was determined in the presence of 10 uM MLA. Bound radioactivity was isolated by vacuum filtration onto glass fiber filter plates prewetted with 2% BSA using a 96-well filtration apparatus (Packard Instruments, Meriden, CT) and were then rapidly rinsed with 2 mL of ice-cold BSS. Packard MicroScint-20® scintillation cocktail (40 uL) was added to each well and radioactivity was determined using a Packard TopCount® instrument. The IC50 values were determined by nonlinear regression in Microsoft Excel® software. Kj values were calculated from the IC50S using the Cheng-Prusoff equation, where Kj = IC50/1+[Ligand]/KD].<br>
Compounds of the invention had Kj values of from about 1 nanomolar to about 10 micromolar when tested by the MLA assay, many having a Kj of less than 1 micromolar. [3H]-Cytisine binding values of compounds of the invention ranged from about 50 nanomolar to at least 100 micromolar. The determination of preferred compounds typically considered the Kj value as measured by MLA assay in view of the Kj value as measured by [3H]-cytisine binding, such that in the formula D = KJMLA/<br>
