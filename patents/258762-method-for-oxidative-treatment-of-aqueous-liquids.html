Method for oxidative treatment of aqueous liquids<br>
The invention relates to a method for oxidative treatment<br>
of aqueous liquids by means of oxidants, wherein the<br>
aqueous liquid is passed through an electrolysis reactor,<br>
in which such electrodes are utilised, which produce mainly<br>
highly aggressive oxidants (0H-, O3, H2O2) in the<br>
electrochemical decomposition of the water due to high<br>
excess voltages (for example +3V at the anode and -1,5 V at<br>
the cathode).<br>
A method for oxidative treatment of surfaces by means of an<br>
electrolyte liquid containing oxidants is known (DE 102 19<br>
688 A1). In this an electrolyte liquid is pumped in<br>
circulation. The required oxidants are electrochemically<br>
produced by means of electrodes provided with a diamond<br>
cover in an electrolysis reactor. Such electrodes have the<br>
property to produce a large potential difference between<br>
cathode and anode in the electrolysis, which clearly<br>
exceeds the usual 1,4 Volt and can be about 4,5 Volt, for<br>
example. In this, mainly very aggressive hydroxyl radicals<br>
are created, but also ozone and hydrogen peroxide. The<br>
known method is utilised in order to clean the surfaces of<br>
silicon wafers, for example, and for this purpose the<br>
wafers are put into a container with an electrolytic liquid<br>
such as sulfuric acid.<br><br>
The present invention relates to a method for oxidative<br>
treatment of black and/or grey water such that an end<br>
product can be produced, which consists substantially of<br>
water.<br>
The term black water is to be understood in this<br>
application as faeces in more or less liquid form. The<br>
water originating for example from a hand wash basin has<br>
been designated as grey water.<br>
The water treated according to the method of the invention<br>
is designated as rinse or wash water, that is water, which<br>
can be used for flushing in a toilet. According to the<br>
method of the invention the black and/or grey water can be<br>
conditioned to such an extent, though, that is can<br>
certainly be used as fresh water, if one does not consider<br>
the slight chloride portions contained therein, in which<br>
respect the utilisation as washing water in toilets in<br>
trains or air-planes is envisioned here.<br>
Starting from the known method, black or grey water is used<br>
as the aqueous liquid according to the invention, this is<br>
freed from coarse particles, mechanically broken up<br>
thereafter, before being passed into the electrolysis<br>
reactor, in order to be able to release gaseous portions,<br>
and to introduce the remaining residual liquid, which<br>
consists mainly of water, into a fresh, wash and/or rinse<br>
water system.<br>
In a preferred method according to the invention, a<br>
circulating method can be utilised, that is the liquid to<br><br>
be treated is passed several times through the electrolysis<br>
reactor such that this can be formed relatively small<br>
depending on the arising liquid volume to be treated. It is<br>
conceivable equally well though, to utilised a non-<br>
continuous method here, that it to dimension the length of<br>
the electrolysis reactor such that the liquid to be treated<br>
is conditioned during passing through the electrolysis<br>
reactor that far that a liquid can be taken out at the<br>
outlet, which consists substantially of water.<br>
The invention is explained below by way of example with<br>
reference to the only figure of the drawing, wherein this<br>
shows a flow diagram of the conditioning of black water<br>
into fresh water.<br>
In the figure, a black water tank is indicated by 10,<br>
wherein for example the discharge mass from a toilet or<br>
from a water basin in a toilet on a plane or on a train is<br>
collected. In this connection it is not substantial, how<br>
the discharge mass is conveyed there, that is via the usual<br>
devices in domestic installations or via vacuum devices, as<br>
they are known in vacuum toilets in vehicles.<br>
101 and 102 designate the level indicators of the tank.<br>
A black water pump 11 conveys the discharge mass into a<br>
shredder 12, in which the discharge mass is broken up. From<br>
here the discharge mass passes into a filter 13 and through<br>
a discharge valve 14 and an inlet valve 15 into the<br>
electrolysis reactor 20.<br><br>
Not shown in the figure is a separator, which can be<br>
arranged anywhere between the toilet and the black water<br>
tank 10, in order to remove such parts from the<br>
accumulating liquid, which are not to be subjected to the<br>
treatment. Here parts such as lighters are sorted out,<br>
which sometimes end up in the bowl of a toilet.<br>
Located in the electrolysis reactor 20 is a plurality of<br>
diamond covered electrodes, and, as far as both electrodes,<br>
cathode and anode, are covered with carbon, a separating<br>
cloth membrane is arranged between them. It is substantial<br>
for the present invention that such electrodes are<br>
selected, which produce a relatively high voltage<br>
difference, of which it is known that especially OH"<br>
radicals are produced. These are generated from the aqueous<br>
portion of the faeces or of the wash and grey water,<br>
respectively, and in turn affect the other components of<br>
the wash and grey water in oxidising manner. These<br>
components are almost exclusively organic compounds, which<br>
are converted through the OH- radical to water and carbon<br>
dioxide. This is the process desired according to the<br>
invention, namely, that the oxidants can be produced from<br>
the aqueous components of the faeces, which in turn "burn"<br>
the organic components of the faeces such that besides<br>
water only carbon dioxide remains.<br>
The faeces are guided into a cycle, that is, they exit the<br>
electrolysis reactor 20 and via flow and transmission flow<br>
measurements, determination of the reduction or oxidation,<br>
respectively, and of the pH value (30, 31, 32) they are<br>
passed into the reactor 20 again. For the circulation of<br><br>
the liquid a rotary pump 33 is utilised. In the figure the<br>
inlet of the reactor 20 is arranged at the top and the<br>
outlet at the bottom, although in a preferred method<br>
according to the invention this is also implemented in<br>
reversed manner.<br>
Not shown in this cycle of the elements 20, 30, 31, 32 and<br>
33 is a bypass with a filter, which bypass can be switched<br>
in and out. This filter is utilised to filter out not<br>
transformed components, that is for example organic<br>
components, which can also occur in faeces in low amounts.<br>
The reactor 20 is provided with level indicators 202, 203<br>
and a temperature meter 201.<br>
Furthermore, the reactor 30 has an outlet for exhaust air<br>
guided upwards, which is led out of the device by means of<br>
an exhaust air vent 21 controlled through an air flow<br>
monitor 22.<br>
When the circulating liquid has been treated sufficiently<br>
long, it can be guided through an outlet valve 4 0 into a<br>
fresh water tank 41. This is provided with a level<br>
indicator 42. Fresh water can be withdrawn through a valve<br>
43.<br>
In a preferred use of the method according to the<br>
invention, such as in a train toilet, it can be achieved<br>
that the fresh water required for flushing the toilet can<br>
be recovered. The treated fresh water obtained above that<br>
can be discharged onto the rails without any problem.<br><br>
Essential is in this connection the closed cycle, i. e.<br>
that arising black water is circulated therein that long,<br>
until is has achieved the required quality.<br><br>
