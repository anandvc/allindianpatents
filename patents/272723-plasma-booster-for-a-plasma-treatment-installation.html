Description<br>
FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a plasma booster for a plasma treatment installation<br>
according to the preamble of claim 1, in particular for use in a vacuum coating<br>
installation according to claim 15 and for a vacuum treatment method according to claim<br>
18 respectively.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
[0002] Hot or cold cathodes are known, in which by applying a voltage between a<br>
cathode, for example a spiral-wound filament or a point with high negative potential, and<br>
an anode, electrons are extracted into the treatment space of a vacuum coating installation<br>
in order to increase the density of the charge carriers at that site. Such electron sources or<br>
ion sources are provided with their own electrical supply. The cathode is conventionally<br>
only connected with the treatment space of the plasma treatment installation via a screen<br>
in order to avoid loading of the cathode through reactive gas or other negative effects due<br>
to the plasma treatment process. Of disadvantage is, on the one hand, that the electrons<br>
are generated outside of the coating chamber and consequently further devices arc<br>
necessary to transfer them into the treatment chamber with as few losses as possible. On<br>
the other hand, due to the additionally necessary electrical supply and complex<br>
structuring, for reasons of costs alone, only a small number of such electron or ion<br>
sources can be provided. Most often, if at all, only one such ion sources is provided with<br>
a plasma treatment installation.<br>
[0003] Known methods for the deposition of DLC layers, i.e. layers with a high<br>
component of sp.sup.3 carbon bonds, such as described for example in WO 01/79585.<br>
utilize an intermediate frequency excitation on the substrate in order to generate a layer<br>
deposition through the developing glow discharge. The glow discharge is generated<br>
between the parts and the installation wall by means of a DC or by means of a unipolar or<br>
bipolar pulsed substrate bias in the pressure range of conventional magnetron sputter<br>
deposition.<br>
[0004] The pieces to be coated are therein actively included in the process. The<br>
achievable deposition rate is thereby inter alia strongly determined by the geometry of the<br>
configuration with respect to the workpiece coating in the coating installation, which<br>
causes strong fluctuations in the deposition rate. The condition may thereby arise that<br>
weak ionization is generated with a less active configuration. This leads to a low<br>
deposition rate and therewith to low productivity.<br>
 <br>
3<br>
[0005] In known plasma treatment installations workpieces arc held on substrate carriers,<br>
for example in the form of a carousel and guided past the coating source(s). Examples<br>
thereof are doubly rotating configurations with geometric distances outside the range of<br>
20-80 mm, whereby no controlled hollow-cathode plasma is generated. Typical problem<br>
areas are the coating of plate configurations and flat parts, which generate only a low<br>
plasma stream.<br>
[0006] In general an increase of the carbon supply by increasing the reactive gas How is<br>
only possible to a limited extent through the throughput of the vacuum pumping system.<br>
since the layer quality is compromised when leaving the optimal process window.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007] The invention is based on the task of providing a plasma booster which can be<br>
installed into the plasma treatment space or directly onto a carousel or even integrated in<br>
a workpiece carrier without elaborate and costly additional measures.<br>
[0008] This task is solved through the inventive characteristics in the characterizing<br>
clause of claim 1. The plasma booster can therein be operated through a bias supply to<br>
impress an electric signal onto the workpieces.<br>
[0009] Of the conventional plasma processes is known that, depending on the process<br>
pressure and the applied voltage, through specific geometric configurations one or several<br>
secondary plasmas may be generated through the so-called hollow-cathode effect. While-<br>
having a locally restricted yet very high density, these secondary plasmas interfere with<br>
the planned plasma process through different effects such as overheating of individual<br>
substrates, plasma fluctuations, graphitization in the gas phase and others. For that reason<br>
in all conventional Plasma CVD methods precautions must be taken in order to avoid<br>
such secondary plasmas.<br>
[0010] Through an arrangement implemented according to the invention it was<br>
unexpectedly achieved to utilize the hollow-cathode effect without damaging<br>
consequences onto process management or layer quality through a plasma booster with<br>
an empirically determinable geometry depending on the process parameters, such that a<br>
stable augmentation of the plasma density and a significant increase of the deposition rate<br>
becomes possible.<br>
[0011] The arrangement according to the invention for augmenting and/or igniting a glow<br>
discharge plasma comprises at least one hollow body of an electrically conductive<br>
material, the hollow space of the hollow body being implemented such that when an<br>
electric signal is impressed on the hollow body, at least in a certain pressure and voltage<br>
range the geometric conditions for the ignition of a discharge in the interior of the hollow<br>
body are satisfied. The hollow body comprises furthermore at least one opening through<br>
which the charge carriers can flow off into the environs of the arrangement in order to<br>
permit there the ignition and operation of a plasma or to boost a plasma existing there.<br>
 <br>
4<br>
[0012] The geometry is here selected such that the process temperature can be kept low<br>
to avoid affecting the properties of the workpieces. Critical for the geometry of the<br>
plasma booster substantially encompassing at least one hollow space are here the inner<br>
dimensions or a characteristic geometric parameter of the hollow space which represents<br>
a characteristic number for the mean distance of the areas of equal electric potential<br>
encompassing the hollow space. For example for a pressure range of 1 .times.10.sup.-3<br>
mbar to 5.times.l0.sup.-2 mbar, preferably 4.times.l0.sup.-3 mbar to 2-10.sup.-2 mbar a<br>
mean distance range of 20 to 200 mm, preferably 60 to 100 mm has been found to be<br>
suitable.<br>
[0013] The application of this principle can take place thereby that at least one<br>
arrangement according to the invention is installed as a plasma booster into the loading of<br>
a carousel with workpiece carriers, whereby the plasma density is increased in the entire<br>
treatment space and, for example, a higher deposition rate can be attained.<br>
[0014] Alternatively, the workpieces can be fastened directly on an arrangement<br>
according to the invention and therewith come directly into connection with the plasma<br>
of the hollow cathode. Combinations of various embodiments of the arrangement<br>
according to the invention can be also be utilized advantageously.<br>
[0015] In the following an attempt is made to explain the phenomena underlying the<br>
invention by means of known laws of physics. However, this can only be seen as a,<br>
possibly flawed, approximation to the relationships obtaining in an industrial coating<br>
installation. These [relationships] may differ significantly from the models developed by<br>
means of exemplifying simplified assumptions, for example with respect to the complex<br>
geometries occurring or moved electrodes.<br>
[0016] Under the assumption that an arrangement according to the invention for boosting<br>
the plasma, which is comprised either of one or several plasma booster trees or of<br>
substrate trees of corresponding geometry, they represent a cathode for a glow discharge,<br>
the anode being the coating chamber which is preferably at ground potential, lor the<br>
ignition of the glow discharge a voltage is applied between anode and cathode which is<br>
between 200 V and 2000 V, preferably between 400 V and 1200 V, each including the<br>
limit values. After the ignition the discharge can also be operated at a lower voltage.<br>
[0017] The ignition of the plasma follows Paschen's law. According to this law the<br>
ignition voltage V.sub.t, or the ignition potential E.sub.t is a function of the type of gas<br>
and at a given type of gas is a function of the product of electrode distance d and pressure<br>
p: V.sub.l=[B.times.p.times.d]/[C+ In pd], E.sub.t  B /|C+ In pd|; where B and C are gas<br>
type-dependent constants.<br>
[0018] As is known to a person of skill in the art, there arc different options for<br>
improving the ignition process. For example when applying a DC voltage, it can be<br>
briefly pulsed at high frequencies. Independently of the type of operator voltage, which<br>
may be a DC, a bipolar or unipolar pulse, a conventional AC voltage or also a modulated<br>
DC voltage, the ignition of a plasma booster according to the invention can be affected or<br>
 <br>
5<br>
improved through the following measures: [0019] rapid pressure fluctuations. |0020|<br>
brief voltage increase (single voltage pulse), [0021] pulse operation of the voltage source,<br>
[0022] applying an external magnetic field perpendicularly or parallel to the [0023]<br>
cathode/anode discharge gap, [0024] additional operation of a plasma, for example in the<br>
form of a sputter, [0025] spark or low-voltage arc plasma, 100261 choice of a readily<br>
ionizable gas, such as for example Ar, Ne, Me.<br>
[0027] Increase of the plasma density by means of a magnetic field is here of particular<br>
significance, since therewith the probability for ionization of the gas in the entire plasma<br>
space increases. For all conditions under which the speed of the charge carriers in the<br>
plasma is not parallel to the magnetic field, forces occur which force these charge carriers<br>
onto a circular path. In the relatively small cathode drop region the movement of the<br>
charge carriers is only affected to a minor extent due to the relatively high field strengths.<br>
In contrast, the magnetic field has a stronger effect on the positive column. The forces of<br>
the magnetic field decrease the outward diffusion of the charge carriers and increase the<br>
plasma density through the increased impact probability with the gas molecules.<br>
[0028] The plasma booster according to the invention is essentially based on the effect of<br>
the increase of the plasma density through the ignition of a hollow cathode. If a discharge<br>
is operated such that to one anode several cathodes are assigned, the distance of the<br>
cathodes from one another is of importance. If the distances of the cathodes from one<br>
another are greater than twice the cathode drop, no mutual effect occurs. If the cathodes<br>
are moved closer to one another or if the plasma density is decreased, faster electrons<br>
from the one cathode surface enter the cathode drop region of the other cathode and<br>
therein are decelerated through the charge, which is also negative, and are reflected. This<br>
reflection at the cathode potentials proceeds until the electron has lost energy, for<br>
example through impact. Through the reflection, in turn, the ionization probability is<br>
increased. The current density increases and may increase by a factor of more than<br>
hundred as a function of the type of gas, of the pressure, the distance or the geometry.<br>
[0029] However, at a very small distance of the cathodes with respect to one another the<br>
current density falls rapidly again, which is explained therewith that the current no longer<br>
finds its way to the anode out of the gap between the two cathodes.<br>
[0030] The mutual effect of the cathodes is referred to as hollow cathode effect. It is<br>
formed if a cathode has hollow spaces which have a diameter smaller the twofold drop<br>
space. The size of the cathode drop space can be strongly affected by the application of a<br>
magnetic field.<br>
[0031] In conventional plasma treatment installations or electrode configurations the<br>
development of hollow cathodes, in particular in the direct proximity to the surface to be<br>
treated, has until now been avoided as much as possible since, in general, through the<br>
formation of such, so-called secondary plasmas highly negative effects result for the<br>
plasma treatment process. For example through such discharges energy may be<br>
withdrawn from the plasma, the reactive gas may be too rapidly or too completely<br>
dissociated or the workpiece surfaces may be overheated, to describe only some of the<br>
 <br>
disturbing phenomena.<br>
[0032] One aim of the present invention, in contrast, is providing a plasma booster which<br>
avoids the disadvantageous effects of a hollow cathode and increases the plasma density<br>
within and outside of the plasma booster to such a degree that it contributes to the<br>
improvement of the treatment process. The plasma density in the interior is here<br>
significantly higher, which is of advantage for better dissociation or excitation,<br>
respectively, of gaseous precursors.<br>
[0033] The principle of the invention will be described by example in conjunction with<br>
the following drawing. Therein depict: TABLE-US-00001 a plasma booster a workpiece<br>
holder a carousel<br>
[0034] The plasma booster 1 shown in FIG. 1 is structured of several supcrjaccnt circular.<br>
elliptical or polygonal annuli 2 or annuli of combined geometries, the annuli 2 being<br>
disposed at a distance a, which is sufficiently small to avoid the ignition of a hollow<br>
discharge between the annuli 2. If the distance is chosen even only slightly too large, the<br>
ignition of a highly intensive undesired secondary plasma occurs between the parallel<br>
cathodes 2, with the above described disadvantageous consequences.<br>
[0035] Distance a between the cathode annuli 2, or distance b between the workpieccs or<br>
mountings must consequently be small compared to the two-fold cathode drop,<br>
advantageously even smaller than the cathode drop. In the present embodiment a distance<br>
a of 1 to 60 mm, preferably 5 to 25 mm was chosen.<br>
[0036] The total height h of the plasma booster 1 can readily be varied by adding or<br>
omitting one or several annuli 2. The annuli 2 can for example be held in the desired<br>
position by individual connection rods 3 with spacer sleeves not further shown here.<br>
[0037] In the case of the present FIG. 1 A, A', the geometrically characteristic parameter<br>
is the inner diameter d of the cathode annuli which also represents the essential<br>
dimension for generating and stabilizing the hollow cathode. In FIG. 1 B the diameter<br>
d'of the circle inscribed in the triangle is assumed as the characteristic parameter. The<br>
diameter d, d'should therefore be chosen such that the conditions for a hollow cathode are<br>
satisfied, i.e. smaller or approximately equal to the twofold cathode drop. In the present<br>
embodiment a distance d of 20 to 200 mm, preferably between 60 to 100 mm was<br>
selected. Together with the height h, the diameter d, d'eonsequently defines the geometry<br>
of the hollow cathode, which can not only be implemented in a different geometry of the<br>
cross section, but also be delimited against the remaining plasma space through different<br>
delimitation areas. For example, instead of many annular segments 2. only one upper and<br>
one lower annular segment may be provided with a grid spanned in between or parallel<br>
wires or rods, cylinder or other hollow body with suitable openings or cut-outs on the<br>
circumference, for example in the form of slots or the like. It is important that there is at<br>
least one opening of the hollow cathode which keeps open the path of the charge carriers<br>
to the anode.<br>
 <br>
7<br>
[0038] In the embodiment depicted in FIG. 1 it was further found that covering of the<br>
upper or lower opening by a metal grid 10 can have a positive effect on the stability of<br>
the plasma.<br>
[0039] FIG. 2 shows a workpiece carrier 4 implemented as a plasma booster. The annuli<br>
5 are provided with receptions 7 for workpieces 8. The characteristic parameter d" can<br>
here be viewed either, as depicted, as the smallest distance of the workpiece carrier 5<br>
from a carrier rod 6, or as the smallest distance between the spokes 11 of the workpiece<br>
carrier, depending on which distance is smaller. It is here also essential that the distance a<br>
as well as the distances b between the workpieces 8 is chosen such that no ignition of a<br>
hollow cathode discharge occurs. At least the workpieces of one workpiece carrier plane<br>
should therefore have very similar, or better identical, geometries or the appropriate<br>
distances a or b, respectively, should be set. To attain as uniform a hollow discharge<br>
plasma as possible over the height of the plasma booster 4, it is advantageous to provide<br>
the spokes 11 of the particular workpiece carrier annuli 5 in the same position such that,<br>
as shown for example in the case depicted in FIG. 2, three identical hollow cathode<br>
spaces 12, 12', 12" are formed in the interior of the plasma booster 4.<br>
[0040] In principle a single workpiece carrier annulus 5 with a hollow cathode space 12<br>
or a single annulus 2 can already be applied as a plasma booster provided the geometry<br>
suitable for the corresponding pressure/voltage range is chosen. However, it is<br>
understood by a person of skill in the art that appropriate plasma boosters 1 or workpiece<br>
carriers 4 implemented as plasma boosters comprised, as depicted in FIG. 1 or 2. of<br>
several planes of annuli 2 or of workpiece carrier annuli 5 achieve a significantly stronger<br>
effect. In such plasma boosters 1, 4, for example, reactive gas or precursors for plasma<br>
CVD or combined PVD/CVD processes can highly efficiently be excited or split and<br>
converted into highly reactive species, for example ionized molecules, molecule<br>
fragments and/or into radicals. Therewith the deposition rate is also significantly<br>
increased and with suitable process management the layer quality of such plasma CVD<br>
layers is improved.<br>
[0041] In FIG. 3 is depicted a carousel 9 on which several plasma boosters 1, as shown in<br>
FIG. 1, as well as also several workpiece carriers 4, as implemented in FIG. 2, are<br>
disposed. The workpiece carriers 4 can therein be mounted such that they arc rotatably<br>
movable and, for example as depicted, in cooperation with carousel 9 and receptions 7<br>
bring about the triple rotation of the workpieces 8 in order to achieve a maximally<br>
uniform coating quality. Such a triple rotation is depicted schematically through the<br>
corresponding movement arrows 1., 2. and 3. It is advantageous if the characteristic<br>
geometric distance d'of plasma booster 1 is at least slightly smaller than the characteristic<br>
geometric distance d" of the workpiece carrier 4, whereby with the application of a. for<br>
example, intermediate-frequency pulse signal according to the Paschcn equation, first the<br>
plasma in the plasma boosters is ignited.<br>
[0042] Such a configuration is especially advantageous if, for example, starting from a<br>
metallic adhesion layer, a graduated transition to a DLC layer is to be generated. If the<br>
adhesion layer is initially applied of a pure metal, for example Cr or Ti, and. as is known<br>
 <br>
8<br>
to the person skilled in the art, other metals of subgroup IV, V or VI of the periodic table<br>
of elements or Si or Al can be considered, through a sputter, an arc, a low-voltage arc or<br>
another PVD method and subsequently a carbon-containing gas, for example acetylene,<br>
methane, ethane, ethylene or the like are added, a mixed layer is formed essentially<br>
containing metal and metal carbide. However, the formation of sp.sub.3-containing<br>
carbon structures does not or only minimally occur as long as only a DC bias is applied.<br>
since in this case the reactive gas is excited or dissociated by the plasma at too low an<br>
extent. However, if, for example, an intermediate-frequency pulse signal is impressed on<br>
the carousel 9, the hollow cathode plasma, due to the smaller distance d, d' ignites first in<br>
the plasma boosters 1. The ignition is facilitated by each additional plasma source, for<br>
example through the glow discharge of the sputter targets and, if required, through an<br>
additional magnetic field applied perpendicularly to the hollow cathode plane. This can<br>
be generated for example through a Helmholtz configuration of two magnetic coils in a<br>
coating installation.<br>
[0043] After the ignition of the hollow cathode plasma in the plasma boosters 1. through<br>
the increased consumption of the reactive gas, a pressure drop occurs, which leads to a<br>
rapid ignition of a further hollow cathode plasma in the hollow spaces 12, 12', 12" of the<br>
workpiece carriers 4 and a further depletion of reactive gas. The ignition of the plasma in<br>
the workpiece carriers 4 takes place through the already high fraction of charge carriers<br>
from the plasma boosters 1 entirely synchronously and without plasma fluctuations. If the<br>
reactive gas fraction is increased, which advantageously takes place in the form of a, for<br>
example, ramp-like increase of the reactive gas flow, at the surface of the materials a high<br>
fraction of highly excited carbon or hydrocarbon ions are available which make the<br>
buildup of sp.sup.3-structures possible. Depending on the process management, now<br>
metal-containing sp.sup.3-structures or, for example by back-regulation or screening oil<br>
the targets, sp.sup.3-structures substantially comprised only of carbon and hydrogen can<br>
be deposited. A further advantage is obtained when using such plasma boosters 1 or<br>
workpiece carriers 4 thereby that the process can be managed such that even in the<br>
deposition of insulating, for example DLC layers, on workpieces, the conductivity on the<br>
inside of the plasma booster 1 or of the workpiece carrier 4, is retained. This results due<br>
to temperature loading increased in this region or due to the increased bombardment with<br>
ionized particles, which causes graphitization on the inner surface of the hollow body or<br>
of the hollow cathode when using, for example, a carbon-containing reactive gas.<br>
[0044] In the following in conjunction with examples, the distinction from prior art and<br>
the advantageous effect of the employment of plasma boosters according to the invention<br>
will be demonstrated. Details regarding the process parameters and geometric<br>
implementation of the arrangement can be found in Table 1. The process was carried out<br>
on a carousel with 6 or 12 trees.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
[0045] Here the workpieces arc charged according to prior art onto trees such that a<br>
hollow cathode is avoided. The substrate current in the process is low. the coating rate is<br>
low.<br>
 <br>
9<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
[0046] Here the pieces are charged onto trees which correspond to an arrangement<br>
according to the invention. When an IF bias is impressed a hollow cathode is thereby<br>
ignited and an increase of the substrate current as well as an increased deposition rate<br>
compared to Example 1. The geometric parameters of the hollow discharge were so<br>
adapted to the process parameters that the pieces were neither overheated nor the layer<br>
quality negatively affected.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
[0047] Here the workpieces were charged as in Example 1. additionally, two of 12 trees<br>
were replaced with an arrangement described as in FIG. I. Alternatively, on one carousel<br>
loaded with 6 trees, additionally, 3 plasma boosters 1 as in FIG. 3 were utilized. In both<br>
cases a positive effect on the deposition rate was observed.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
[0048] Here the pieces were charged onto an arrangement as in Example 2, the hollow<br>
cathode is operated at a higher pressure, which leads to an additional increase of the<br>
substrate current and of the deposition rate compared to example 1 and 2. Under these<br>
conditions the pieces were also neither overheated nor the layer quality negatively<br>
affected.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
[0049] Here the distances were greater than in Example 1, however, smaller than in<br>
Example 2. Clearly, d" here corresponds to a mean distance in the range of a maximal<br>
electron reflection, since here the hollow cathode burns very intensively, the pieces are<br>
overheated and a poor layer quality is generated through the graphitization.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
[0050] Shows a marked dependence of the effect of the plasma booster on the frequency<br>
of the impressed electric signal. With a frequency increase of 50 to 100 kHz, at otherwise<br>
constant parameters, a significant increase, compared to Example 4, of the substrate<br>
current and of the coating rate could be achieved.<br>
[0051] Although in the preceding many different feasibilities for carrying out the<br>
invention were described, it is evident to a person of skill in the art by means of the<br>
description that there are still a large number of other feasibilities for realizing<br>
corresponding arrangements for ignition or boosting the plasma. For example a<br>
corresponding arrangement can also be disposed on the vacuum chamber, the chamber<br>
bottom or chamber cover instead of on the carousel provided the arrangement is insulated<br>
from the receptacle and a corresponding electric signal, for example the substrate bias<br>
 <br>
signal, is impressed. TABLE-US-00002 TABLE 1 Examples of the Invention Example 3:<br>
