				<td>This invention relates to production of a-ABeta.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Proteins and polypeptides have become increasingly important as therapeutic<br>
agents. In most cases, therapeutic proteins and polypeptides are produced in cell culture,<br>
from cells that have been engineered and/or selected to produce unusually high levels of<br>
the particular protein or polypeptide of interest. Control and optimization of cell culture<br>
conditions is critically important for successful commercial production of proteins and<br>
polypeptides.<br>
Many proteins and polypeptides produced in cell culture are made in a batch or fedbatch<br>
process, in which cells are cultured for a period of time, and then the culture is<br>
terminated and the produced protein or polypeptide is isolated. The ultimate amount and<br>
quality of protein or polypeptide produced can be dramatically affected by the conditions<br>
of the cell culture. For example, traditional batch and fed-batch culture processes often<br>
result in production of metabolic waste products that have detrimental effects on cell<br>
growth, viability, and production or stability of the protein or polypeptide of interest.<br>
While efforts have been made to improve production of proteins and polypeptides in batch<br>
and fed-batch culture processes, there remains a need for additional improvements.<br>
Additionally, significant effort has been invested in the development of defined<br>
media (i.e., media assembled from known individual components and lacking serum or<br>
other animal byproducts) for use in culturing cells, particularly mammalian cells. Cell<br>
growth characteristics can be very different in defined media as contrasted with serumderived<br>
media. There is a particular need for the development of improved systems for<br>
producing proteins and polypeptides by cell culture in defined media.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an improved system for large scale production of<br>
proteins and/or polypeptides in cell culture. For example, the present invention provides<br>
commercial scale (e.g., 500 L or more) culture methods that utilize a medium characterized<br>
by one or more of: i) a cumulative amino acid amount per unit volume greater than about mM; ii) a molar cumulative glutamine to cumulative asparagine ratio of less than about 2;<br>
iii) a molar cumulative glutamine to cumulative total amino acid ratio of less than about iv) a molar cumulative inorganic ion to cumulative total amino acid ratio between about to 1; or v) a combined cumulative amount of<br>
glutamine and asparagine concentration per unit volume greater than about 16 mM.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that "cumulative", as used above, refers<br>
to the total amount of a particular component or components added over the course of<br>
the cell culture, including components added at the beginning of the culture and<br>
subsequently added components. In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, it<br>
is desirable to minimize "feeds" of the culture over time, so that it is desirable to<br>
maximize amounts present initially. Of course, medium components are metabolized<br>
during culture so that cultures with the same cumulative amounts of given components<br>
will have different absolute levels if those components are added at different times<br>
(e.g., all present initially vs. some added by feeds).<br>
According to the present invention, use of such a medium allows high levels of<br>
protein production and lessens accumulation of certain undesirable factors such as<br>
ammonium and/or lactate.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the media formulations of the<br>
present invention encompass both defined and non-defined media. In certain preferred<br>
embodiments of the present invention, the culture medium is a defined medium in<br>
which the composition of the medium is known and controlled.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, the culture methods<br>
include changing the culture from a first set of culture conditions to a second set of<br>
culture conditions so that a metabolic shift of the cells is achieved. In some<br>
embodiments, this change is performed when the culture has reached about 20-80% of<br>
its maximal cell density. In some embodiments, the change involves changing the<br>
temperature (or temperature range) at which the culture is maintained. Alternatively or<br>
additionally, the present invention provides methods adjusted so th,at, after reaching a<br>
peak, lactate and/or ammonium levels in the culture decrease over time. In other<br>
embodiments, the shift involves shifting the pH, osmolarlity or level of chemical<br>
inductants, such as alkanoic acids or their salts.<br>
Cell cultures of the present invention may optionally be supplemented with<br>
nutrients and/or other medium components including hormones and/or other growth<br>
factors, particular ions (such as sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate),<br>
buffers, vitamins, nucleosides or nucleotides, trace elements (inorganic compounds<br>
usually present at very low final concentrations), amino acids, lipids, or glucose or<br>
other energy source. In certain embodiments of the present invention, it may be<br>
beneficial to supplement the media with chemical inductants such as hexamethylenebis(<br>
acetamide) ("HMBA") and sodium butyrate ("NaB"). These optional supplements<br>
may be added at the beginning of the culture or may be added at a later point in order<br>
to replenish depleted nutrients or for another reason. In general, it is desirable to select<br>
the initial medium composition to minimize supplementation in accordance with the<br>
present invention.<br>
Various culture conditions may be monitored in accordance with the present<br>
invention, including pH, cell density, cell viability, lactate levels, ammonium levels,<br>
osmolarity, or titer of the expressed polypeptide or protein.<br>

"Gene": The term "gene" as used herein refers to any nucleotide sequence, DNA<br>
or RNA, at least some portion of which encodes a discrete final product, typically, but<br>
not limited to, a polypeptide, which functions in some aspect of cellular metabolism or<br>
development. The term is not meant to refer only to the coding sequence that encodes<br>
the polypeptide or other discrete final product, but may also encompass regions<br>
preceding and following the coding sequence that modulate the basal level of expression<br>
(see definition of "genetic control element" below), as well as intervening sequences<br>
("introns") between individual coding segments ("exons").<br>
"Genetic control element": The term "genetic control element" as used herein<br>
refers to any sequence element that modulates the expression of a gene to which it is<br>
operably linked. Genetic control elements may function by either increasing or<br>
decreasing the expression levels and may be located before, within or after the coding<br>
sequence. Genetic control elements may act at any stage of gene expression by<br>
regulating, for example, initiation, elongation or termination of transcription, mRNA<br>
splicing, mRNA editing, mRNA stability, mRNA localization within the cell, initiation,<br>
elongation or termination of translation, or any other stage of gene expression. Genetic<br>
control elements may function individually or in combination with one another.<br>
"Hybridoma": The term "hybridoma" as used herein refers to a cell created by<br>
fusion of an immortalized cell derived from an immunologic source and an antibodyproducing<br>
cell. The resulting hybridoma is an immortalized cell that produces<br>
antibodies. The individual cells used to create the hybridoma can be from any<br>
mammalian source, including, but not limited to, rat, pig, rabbit, sheep, pig, goat, and<br>
human. The term also encompasses trioma cell lines, which result when progeny of<br>
heterohybrid myeloma fusions, which are the product of a fusion between human cells<br>
and a murine myeloma cell line, are subsequently fused with a plasma cell. Furthermore,<br>
the term is meant to include any immortalized hybrid cell line that produces antibodies<br>
such as, for example, quadromas (See, e.g., Milstein et al., Nature, 537:3053 (1983)).<br>
"Integrated Viable Cell Density": The term "integrated viable cell density" as<br>
used herein refers to the average density of viable cells over the course of the culture<br>
multiplied by the amount of time the culture has run. Assuming the amount of<br>
polypeptide and/or protein produced is proportional to the number of viable cells present<br>
over the course of the culture, integrated viable cell density is a useful tool for estimating<br>
the amount of polypeptide and/or protein produced over the course of the culture.<br>
"Medium", "Cell culture medium", "Culture medium": These terms as used<br>
herein refer to a solution containing nutrients which nourish growing mammalian cells.<br>
Typically, these solutions provide essential and non-essential amino acids, vitamins,<br>
energy sources, lipids, and trace elements required by the cell for minimal growth and/or<br>
survival. The solution may also contain components that enhance growth and/or survival<br>
above the minimal rate, including hormones and growth factors. The solution is<br>
preferably formulated to a pH and salt concentration optimal for cell survival and<br>
proliferation. The medium may also be a "defined media" - a serum-free media that<br>
contains no proteins, hydrolysates or components of unknown composition. Defined<br>
media are free of animal-derived components and all components have a known<br>
chemical structure.<br>
"Metabolic waste product": The term "metabolic waste product" as used herein<br>
refers to compounds produced by the cell culture as a result of normal or non-normal<br>
metabolic processes that are in some way detrimental to the cell culture, particularly in<br>
relation to the expression or activity of a desired recombinant polypeptide or protein.<br>
For example, the metabolic waste products may be detrimental to the growth or viability<br>
of the cell culture, may decrease the amount of recombinant polypeptide or protein<br>
produced, may alter the folding, stability, glycoslyation or other post-translational<br>
modification of the expressed polypeptide or protein, or may be detrimental to the cells<br>
and/or expression or activity of the recombinant polypeptide or protein in any number of<br>
other ways. Exemplary metabolic waste products include lactate, which is produced as a<br>
result of glucose metabolism, and ammonium, which is produced as a result of glutamine<br>
metabolism. One goal of the present invention is to slow production of, reduce or even<br>
eliminate metabolic waste products in mammalian cell cultures.<br>
"Osmolarity" and "Osmolality": "Osmolality" is a measure of the osmotic<br>
pressure of dissolved solute particles in an aqueous solution. The solute particles include<br>
both ions and non-ionized molecules. Osmolality is expressed as the concentration of<br>
osmotically active particles (i.e., osmoles) dissolved in 1 kg of solution (1 mOsm/kg H2O<br>
at 38°C is equivalent to an osmotic pressure of 19mm Hg). "Osmolarity," by contrast,<br>
refers to the number of solute particles dissolved in 1 liter of solution. When used herein,<br>
the abbreviation "mOsm" means "milliosmoles/kg solution".<br>
"Perfusion culture": The term "perfusion culture" as used herein refers to a<br>
method of culturing cells in which additional components are provided continuously or<br>
semi-continuously to the culture subsequent to the beginning of the culture process. The<br>
provided components typically comprise nutritional supplements for the cells which have<br>
been depleted during the culturing process. A portion of the cells and/or components in<br>
the medium are typically harvested on a continuous or semi-continuous basis and are<br>
optionally purified.<br>
"Polypeptide": The term "polypeptide" as used herein refers a sequential chain of<br>
amino acids linked together via peptide bonds. The term is used to refer to an amino<br>
acid chain of any length, but one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the term<br>
is not limited to lengthy chains and can refer to a minimal chain comprising two amino<br>
acids linked together via a peptide bond.<br>
"Protein": The term "protein" as used herein refers to one or more polypeptides<br>
that function as a discrete unit. If a single polypeptide is the discrete functioning unit<br>
and does require permanent physical association with other polypeptides in order to form<br>
the discrete functioning unit, the terms "polypeptide" and "protein" as used herein are<br>
used interchangeably. If discrete functional unit is comprised of more than one<br>
polypeptide that physically associate with one another, the term "protein" as used herein<br>
refers to the multiple polypeptides that are physically coupled and function together as<br>
the discrete unit.<br>
"Recombinantly expressed polypeptide" and "Recombinant polypeptide": These<br>
terms as used herein refer to a polypeptide expressed from a mammalian host cell that<br>
has been genetically engineered to express that polypeptide. The recombinantly<br>
expressed polypeptide can be identical or similar to polypeptides that are normally<br>
expressed in the mammalian host cell. The recombinantly expressed polypeptide can<br>
also foreign to the host cell, i.e. heterologous to peptides normally expressed in the<br>
mammalian host cell. Alternatively, the recombinantly expressed polypeptide can be<br>
chimeric in that portions of the polypeptide contain amino acid sequences that are<br>
identical or similar to polypeptides normally expressed in the mammalian host cell, while<br>
other portions are foreign to the host cell.<br>
"Seeding": The term "seeding" as used herein refers to the process of providing a<br>
cell culture to a bioreactor or another vessel. The cells may have been propagated<br>
previously in another bioreactor or vessel. Alternatively, the cells may have been frozen<br>
and thawed immediately prior to providing them to the bioreactor or yessel. The term<br>
refers to any number of cells, including a single cell.<br>
"Titer": The term "titer" as used herein refers to the total amount of<br>
recombinantly expressed polypeptide or protein produced by a mammalian cell culture<br>
divided by a given amount of medium volume. Titer is typically expressed in units of<br>
milligrams of polypeptide or protein per milliliter of medium.<br>
Detailed Description of Certain Preferred Embodiments<br>
The present invention provides improved systems for the production of proteins<br>
and/or polypeptides by cell culture. In particular, the invention provides systems that<br>
minimize production of one or more metabolic products detrimental to cell growth,<br>
viability, and/or protein production or quality. In a preferred embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the cell culture is a batch or fed-batch culture. Other certain preferred<br>
embodiments of the invention are discussed in detail below. Those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art will understand, however, that various modifications toi these preferred<br>
embodiments are within the scope of the appended claims. It is the claims and<br>
equivalents thereof that define the scope of the present invention, which is not and<br>
should not be limited to or by this description of certain preferred embodiments.<br>
Polvpeptides<br>
Any polypeptide that is expressible in a host cell may be produced in accordance with<br>
the present to the host cell, or from a gene that is introduced into the host cell through genetic<br>
engineering. The polypeptide may be one that occurs in nature, or may alternatively<br>
have a sequence that was engineered or selected by the hand of man. An engineered<br>
polypeptide may be assembled from other polypeptide segments that individually occur<br>
in nature, or may include one or more segments that are not naturally occurring.<br>
Polypeptides that may desirably be expressed in accordance with the present<br>
invention will often be selected on the basis of an interesting biological or chemical<br>
activity. For example, the present invention may be employed to express any<br>
pharmaceutically or commercially relevant enzyme, receptor, antibody, hormone,<br>
regulatory factor, antigen, binding agent, etc.<br>
Antibodies<br>
Given the large number of antibodies currently in use or under investigation as<br>
pharmaceutical or other commercial agents, production of antibodies is of particular<br>
interest in accordance with the present invention. Antibodies are proteins that have the<br>
ability to specifically bind a particular antigen. Any antibody that can be expressed in a<br>
host cell may be used in accordance with the present invention. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the antibody to be expressed is a monoclonal antibody.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the monoclonal antibody is a chimeric<br>
antibody. A chimeric antibody contains amino acid fragments that are derived from<br>
more than one organism. Chimeric antibody molecules can include, for example, an<br>
antigen binding domain from an antibody of a mouse, rat, or other species, with human<br>
constant regions. A variety of approaches for making chimeric antibodies have been<br>
described. See e.g., Morrison et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. 81, 6851 (1985);<br>
Takeda et al., Nature 314, 452 (1985), Cabilly et al., U.S. Patent No. 4,816,567; Boss et<br>
al, U.S. Patent No. 4,816,397; Tanaguchi et al., European Patent Publication EP171496;<br>
European Patent Publication 0173494, United Kingdom Patent GB 2177096B.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the monoclonal antibody is a human antibody<br>
derived, e.g., through the use of ribosome-display or phage-display libraries (see, e.g.,<br>
Winter et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,291,159 and Kawasaki, U.S. Patent No. 5,658,754) or the<br>
use of xenographic species in which the native antibody genes are inactivated and<br>
functionally replaced with human antibody genes, while leaving intact the other<br>
components of the native immune system (see, e.g., Kucherlapati et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,657,103).<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the monoclonal antibody is a humanized antibody.<br>
A humanized antibody is a chimeric antibody wherein the large majority of the amino<br>
acid residues are derived from human antibodies, thus minimizing any potential immune<br>
reaction when delivered to a human subject. In humanized antibodies, amino acid<br>
residues in the complementarity determining regions are replaced, at least in part, with<br>
residues from a non-human species that confer a desired antigen specificity or affinity.<br>
Such altered immunoglobulin molecules can be made by any of several techniques<br>
known in the art, (e.g., Teng et al, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A., 80, 7308-7312 (1983);<br>
Kozbor et al., Immunology Today, 4, 7279 (1983); Olsson et al., Meth. EnzymoL, 92, 3-<br>
16 (1982)), and are preferably made according to the teachings of PCT Publication<br>
WO92/06193 or EP 0239400, all of which are incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Humanized antibodies can be commercially produced by, for example, Scotgen Limited,<br>
2 Holly Road, Twickenham, Middlesex, Great Britain. For further reference, see Jones<br>
et al., Nature 321:522-525 (1986); Riechmann et al., Nature 332:323-329 (1988); and<br>
Presta, Curr. Op. Struct. Biol. 2:593-596 (1992), all of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the monoclonal, chimeric, or humanized<br>
antibodies described above may contain amino acid residues that do not naturally occur<br>
in any antibody in any species in nature. These foreign residues can be utilized, for<br>
example, to confer novel or modified specificity, affinity or effector function on the<br>
monoclonal, chimeric or humanized antibody. In another preferred embodiment, the<br>
antibodies described above may be conjugated to drugs for systemic pharmacotherapy,<br>
such as toxins, low-molecular-weight cytotoxic drugs, biological response modifiers, and<br>
radionuclides (see e.g., Kunz et al., Calicheamicin derivative-carrier conjugates.<br>
US20040082764A1).<br>
In one embodiment, the antibody is an antibody that specifically binds to the Ap<br>
fragment of amyloid precursor protein or to other components of an amyloid plaque, and<br>
is useful in combating the accumulation of amyloid plaques in the brain which<br>
characterize Alzheimer's disease. (See, e.g., US Provisional Application 60/636,684.)<br>
In another embodiment, antibodies of the present invention are directed against<br>
cell surface antigens expressed on target cells and/or tissues in proliferative disorders<br>
such as cancer. In one embodiment, the antibody is an IgGl anti-Lewis Y antibody.<br>
Lewis Y is a carbohydrate antigen with the structure FucaJ —&gt; 2GalBl —» 4[FucaJ -*<br>
3]GlcNac61^3R (Abe et al. (1983) J. Biol. Chem., 258 11793-11797). Lewis Y antigen<br>
is expressed on the surface of 60% to 90% of human epithelial tumors (including those<br>
of the breast, colon, lung, and prostate), at least 40% of which overexpress this antigen,<br>
and has limited expression in normal tissues.<br>
In order to target Ley and effectively target a tumor, an antibody with exclusive<br>
specificity to the antigen is ideally required. Thus, preferably, the anti-Lewis Y<br>
antibodies of the present invention do not cross-react with the type 1 structures (i.e., the<br>
lacto-series of blood groups (Lea and Leb)) and, preferably, do not bind other type 2<br>
epitopes (i.e., neolacto-structure) like Lex and H-type 2 structures. An example of a<br>
preferred anti-Lewis Y antibody is designated hu3S193 (see U.S. Patent Nos. 6,310,185;<br>
6,518,415; 5,874,060, incorporated herein in their entirety). The humanized antibody<br>
hu3S193 (Attia, M.A., et al. 1787-1800) was generated by CDR-grafting from 3S193,<br>
which is a murine monoclonal antibody raised against adenocarcinoma cell with<br>
exceptional specificity for Ley (Kitamura, K., 12957-12961). Hu3S193 not only retains<br>
the specificity of 3S193 for Ley but has also gained in the capability to mediate<br>
complement dependent cytotoxicity (hereinafter referred to as CDC) and antibody<br>
dependent cellular cytotoxicity (hereinafter referred to as ADCC) (Attia, M.A., et al.<br>
1787-1800). This antibody targets Ley expressing xenografts in nude mice as<br>
demonstrated by biodistribution studies with hu3S193 labeled with 1251, lllln, or 18F,<br>
as well as other radiolabels that require a chelating agent, such as 11 lln, 99mTc, or 90Y<br>
(Clark, etal. 4804-4811).<br>
In another embodiment, the antibody is one of the human antl-GDF-8 antibodies<br>
termed Myo29, Myo28, and Myo22, and antibodies and antigen- binding fragments<br>
derived therefrom. These antibodies are capable of binding mature GDF-8 with high<br>
affinity, inhibit GDF-8 activity in vitro and in vivo as demonstrated, for example, by<br>
inhibition of ActRIIB binding and reporter gene assays, and may inhibit GDF-8 activity<br>
associated with negative regulation of skeletal muscle mass and bone density. See, e.g.,<br>
Veldman, et al, U.S. Patent Application No. 20040142382.<br>
Receptors<br>
Another class of polypeptides that have been shown to be effective as<br>
pharmaceutical and/or commercial agents includes receptors. Receptors are typically<br>
trans-membrane glycoproteins that function by recognizing an extra-cellular signaling<br>
ligand. Receptors typically have a protein kinase domain in addition to the ligand<br>
recognizing domain, which initiates a signaling pathway by phosphorylating target<br>
intracellular molecules upon binding the ligand, leading to developmental or metabolic<br>
changes within the cell. In one embodiment, the receptors of interest are modified so as<br>
to remove the transmembrane and/or intracellular domain(s), in place of which there may<br>
optionally be attached an Ig-domain. In a preferred embodiment, receptors to be<br>
produced in accordance with the present invention are receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs).<br>
The RTK family includes receptors that are crucial for a variety of functions numerous<br>
cell types (see, e.g., Yarden and Ullrich, Ann. Rev. Biochem. 57:433-478, 1988; Ullrich<br>
and Schlessinger, Cell 61:243-254, 1990, incorporated herein by reference). Nonlimiting<br>
examples of RTKs include members of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)<br>
receptor family, members of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF) family, platelet<br>
derived growth factor (PDGF) receptor, tyrosine kinase with immunoglobulin and EGF<br>
homology domains-1 (TIE-1) and TIE-2 receptors (Sato et al, Nature 376(6535):70-74<br>
(1995), incorporated herein be reference) and c-Met receptor, some of which have been<br>
suggested to promote angiogenesis, directly or indirectly (Mustonen and Alitalo, J. Cell<br>
Biol 129:895-898, 1995). Other non-limiting examples of RTK's include fetal liver<br>
kinase 1 (FLK-1) (sometimes referred to as kinase insert domain-containing receptor<br>
(KDR) (Terman et al., Oncogene 6:1677-83, 1991) or vascular endothelial cell growth<br>
factor receptor 2 (VEGFR-2)), fms-like tyrosine kinase-1 (Flt-1) (DeVries et al. Science<br>
255;989-991, 1992; Shibuya et al., Oncogene 5:519-524, 1990), sometimes referred to as<br>
vascular endothelial cell growth factor receptor 1 (VEGFR-1), neuropilin-1, endoglin,<br>
endosialin, and Axl. Those of ordinary skill in the art will be aware of other receptors<br>
that can preferably be expressed in accordance with the present invention.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment, tumor necrosis factor inhibitors, in the<br>
form of tumor necrosis factor alpha and beta receptors (TNFR-1; EP 417,563 published<br>
Mar. 20, 1991; and TNFR-2, EP 417,014 published Mar. 20, 1991) are expressed in<br>
accordance with the present invention (for review, see Naismith and Sprang, J Inflamm.<br>
47(l-2):l-7 (1995-96), incorporated herein by reference). According to one embodiment,<br>
the tumor necrosis factor inhibitor comprises a soluble TNF receptor and preferably a<br>
TNFR-Ig. In one embodiment, the preferred TNF inhibitors of the present invention are<br>
soluble forms of TNFRI and TNFRII, as well as soluble TNF binding proteins, in<br>
another embodiment, the TNFR-Ig fusion is a TNFR:Fc, a term which as used herein<br>
refers to "etanercept," which is a dimer of two molecules of the extracellular portion of<br>
the p75 TNF-.alpha. receptor, each molecule consisting of a 235 amino acid Fc portion<br>
of human IgG.sub.l.<br>
Growth Factors and Other Signaling Molecules • ,<br>
Another class of polypeptides that have been shown to be effective as<br>
pharmaceutical and/or commercial agents includes growth factors and other signaling<br>
molecules. Growth factors are typically glycoproteins that are secreted by cells and bind<br>
to and activate receptors on other cells, initiating a metabolic or developmental change in<br>
the receptor cell. In one embodiment, the protein of interest is an ActRIIB fusion<br>
polypeptide comprising the extracellular domain of the ActRIIB receptior and the Fc<br>
portion of an antibody (see, e.g., Wolfman, et al., ActRIIB fusion polvpeptides and uses<br>
therefor. US2004/0223966 Al). In another embodiment, the growth factor may be a<br>
modified GDF-8 propeptide (see., e.g., Wolfman, et al., Modifed and stabilized GDF<br>
propeptides and uses thereof. US2003/0104406 Al). Alternatively, the protein of<br>
interest could be a follistatin-domain-containing protein (see, e.g., Hill, et al., GASP1: a<br>
follistatin domain containing protein. US 2003/0162714 Al, Hill, et al., GASP1: a<br>
follistatin domain containing protein. US 2005/0106154 Al, Hill, et al., Follistatin<br>
domain containing proteins. US 2003/0180306 Al).<br>
Non-limiting examples of mammalian growth factors and other signaling<br>
molecules include cytokines; epidermal growth factor (EGF); platelet-derived growth<br>
factor (PDGF); flbroblast growth factors (FGFs) such as aFGF and bFGF; transforming<br>
growth factors (TGFs) such as TGF-alpha and TGF-beta, including TGF-beta 1, TGFbeta<br>
2, TGF-beta 3, TGF-beta 4, or TGF-beta 5; insulin-like growth factor-I and -II (IGFI<br>
and IGF-II); des(l-3) -IGF-I (brain IGF-I), insulin-like growth factor binding proteins;<br>

factors; immunotoxins; a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP); an interferon such as<br>
interferon-alpha, -beta, and -gamma; colony stimulating factors (CSFs), e.g., M-CSF,<br>
GM-CSF, and G-CSF; interleukins (TLs), e.g., IL-1 to IL-10; tumor necrosis factor<br>
(TNF) alpha and beta; insulin A-chain; insulin B-chain; proinsulin; follicle stimulating<br>
hormone; calcitonin; luteinizing hormone; glucagon; clotting factors such as factor<br>
VIIIC, factor IX, tissue factor, and von Willebrands factor; anti-clotting factors such as<br>
Protein C; atrial natriuretic factor; lung surfactant; a plasminogen activator, such as<br>
urokinase or human urine or tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA); bombesin;<br>
thrombin, hemopoietic growth factor; enkephalinase; RANTES (regulated on activation<br>
normally T-cell expressed and secreted); human macrophage inflammatory protein<br>
(MIP-1-alpha); mullerian-inhibiting substance; relaxin A-chain; relaxin B-chain;<br>
prorelaxin; mouse gonadotropin-associated peptide; neurotrophic factors such as bonederived<br>
neurotrophic factor (BDNF), neurotrophin-3, -4, -5, or -6 (NT-3, NT-4, NT-5, or<br>
NT-6), or a nerve growth factor such as NGF-beta. One of ordinary skill in the art will<br>
be aware of other growth factors or signaling molecules that can be expressed in<br>
accordance with the present invention.<br>
G-Protein Coupled Receptors<br>
Another class of polypeptides that have been shown to be effective as<br>
pharmaceutical and/or commercial agents includes growth factors and other signaling<br>
molecules. G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) are proteins that have seven<br>
transmembrane domains. Upon binding of a ligand to a GPCR, a signal is transduced<br>
within the cell which results in a change in a biological or physiological property of the<br>
cell.<br>
GPCRs, along with G-proteins and effectors (intracellular enzymes and channels<br>
which are modulated by G-proteins), are the components of a modular signaling system<br>
that connects the state of intracellular second messengers to extracellular inputs. These<br>
genes and gene-products are potential causative agents of disease.<br>
Specific defects in the rhodopsin gene and the V2 vasopressin receptor gene have<br>
been shown to cause various forms of autosomal dominant and autosomal recessive<br>
retinitis pigmentosa, nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. These receptors are of critical<br>
importance to both the central nervous system and peripheral physiological processes.<br>
The GPCR protein superfamily now contains over 250 types of paralogues, receptors that<br>
represent variants generated by gene duplications (or other processes), as opposed to<br>
orthologues, the same receptor from different species. The superfamily can be broken<br>
down into five families: Family I, receptors typified by rhodopsin and the beta2-<br>
adrenergic receptor and currently represented by over 200 unique members; Family II,<br>
the recently characterized parathyroid hormone/calcitonin/secretin receptor family;<br>
Family III, the metabotropic glutamate receptor family in mammals; Family IV, the<br>
cAMP receptor family, important in the chemotaxis and development of D. discoideum;<br>
and Family V, the fungal mating pheromone receptors such as STE2.<br>
GPCRs include receptors for biogenic amines, for lipid mediators of<br>
inflammation, peptide hormones, and sensory signal mediators. The GPCR becomes<br>
activated when the receptor binds its extracellular ligand. Conformational changes in the<br>
GPCR, which result from the ligand-receptor interaction, affect the binding affinity of a<br>
G protein to the GPCR intracellular domains. This enables GTP to bind with enhanced<br>
affinity to the G protein.<br>
Activation of the G protein by GTP leads to the interaction of the G protein a<br>
subunit with adenylate cyclase or other second messenger molecule generators. This<br>
interaction regulates the activity of adenylate cyclase and hence production of a second<br>
messenger molecule, cAMP. cAMP regulates phosphorylation and activation of other<br>
intracellular proteins. Alternatively, cellular levels of other second messenger molecules,<br>
such as cGMP or eicosinoids, may be upregulated or downregulated by the activity of<br>
GPCRs. The G protein a subunit is deactivated by hydrolysis of the GTP by GTPase, and<br>
the a(3 and y subunits reassociate. The heterotrimeric G protein then dissociates from the<br>
adenylate cyclase or other second messenger molecule generator. Activity of GPCR may<br>
also be regulated by phosphorylation of the intra- and extracellular domains or loops.<br>
Glutamate receptors form a group of GPCRs that are important in<br>
neurotransmission. Glutamate is the major neurotransmitter in the CNS and is believed<br>
to have important roles in neuronal plasticity, cognition, memory, learning and some<br>
neurological disorders such as epilepsy, stroke, and neurodegeneration (Watson, S. and<br>
S. Arkinstall (1994) The G- Protein Linked Receptor Facts Book, Academic Press, San<br>
Diego CA, pp. 130-132). These effects of glutamate are mediated by two distinct classes<br>
of receptors termed ionotropic and metabotropic. lonotropic receptors contain an<br>
intrinsic cation channel and mediate fast excitatory actions of glutamate. Metabotropic<br>
receptors are modulatory, increasing the membrane excitability of neurons by inhibiting<br>
calcium dependent potassium conductances and both inhibiting and potentiating<br>
excitatory transmission of ionotropic receptors. Metabotropic receptors are classified into<br>
five subtypes based on agonist pharmacology and signal transduction pathways and are<br>
widely distributed in brain tissues.<br>
The vasoactive intestinal polypeptide (VIP) family is a group of related<br>
polypeptides whose actions are also mediated by GPCRs. Key members of this family<br>
are VIP itself, secretin, and growth hormone releasing factor (GRF). VIP has a wide<br>
profile of physiological actions including relaxation of smooth muscles, stimulation or<br>
inhibition of secretion in various tissues, modulation of various immune cell activities,<br>
and various excitatory and inhibitory activities in the CNS. Secretin stimulates secretion<br>
of enzymes and ions in the pancreas and intestine and is also present in small amounts in<br>
the brain. GRF is an important neuroendocrine agent regulating synthesis and release of<br>
growth hormone from the anterior pituitary (Watson, S. and S. Arkinstall supra, pp. 278-<br>
283).<br>
Following ligand binding to the GPCR, a conformational change is transmitted to<br>
the G protein, which causes the a-subunit to exchange a bound GDP molecule for a GTP<br>
molecule and to dissociate from the py-subunits. The GTP-bound form of the a-subunit<br>
typically functions as an effector-modulating moiety, leading to the production of second<br>
messengers, such as cyclic AMP (e.g., by activation of adenylate cyclase), diacylglycerol<br>
or inositol phosphates. Greater than 20 different types of oc-subunits are known in man,<br>
which associate with a smaller pool of pandysubunits. Examples of mammalian G<br>
proteins include Gi, Go, Gq, Gs and Gt. G proteins are described extensively in Lodish<br>
H. et al. Molecular Cell Biology, (Scientific American Books Inc., New York, N.Y.,<br>
1995), the contents of which is incorporated herein by reference. ' i<br>
GPCRs are a major target for drug action and development. In fact, receptors<br>
have led to more than half of the currently known drugs (Drews, Nature Biotechnology,<br>
1996, 14: 1516) and GPCRs represent the most important target for therapeutic<br>
intervention with 30% of clinically prescribed drugs either antagonizing or agonizing a<br>
GPCR (Milligan, G. and Rees, S., (1999) TIPS. 20: 118-124). This demonstrates that<br>
these receptors have an established, proven history as therapeutic targets.<br>
In general, practitioners of the present invention will selected their polypeptide of<br>
interest, and will know its precise amino acid sequence. The techniques of the present<br>
invention have been successfully applied to production of diverse polypeptides<br>
including, for example, a human monoclonal antibody directed to growth and<br>
differentiation factor 8 (Examples 1, 3, 4, 7-14), humanized anti-Lewis Y antibody<br>
(Examples 5 and 6), anti-ABeta (Example 15) and a dimeric Fc-fusion protein of tumor<br>
necrosis factor receptor (Example 16), indicating that the present invention will be useful<br>
for expression of a variety of different polypeptides and proteins. Any 'given protein that<br>
is to be expressed in accordance with the present invention will have its own<br>
idiosyncratic characteristics and may influence the cell density or viability of the cultured<br>
cells, and may be expressed at lower levels than another polypeptide or protein grown<br>
under identical culture conditions. One of ordinary skill in the art will be able to<br>
appropriately modify the steps and compositions of the present invention in order to<br>
optimize cell growth and/or production of any given expressed polypeptide or protein.<br>
Genetic Control Elements<br>
As will be clear to those of ordinary skill in the art, genetic control elements may<br>
be employed to regulate gene expression of the polypeptide or protein. Such genetic<br>
control elements should be selected to be active in the relevant host cell. Control<br>
elements may be constitutively active or may be inducible under defined circumstances.<br>
Inducible control elements are particularly useful when the expressed protein is toxic or<br>
has otherwise deleterious effects on cell growth and/or viability. In such instances,<br>
regulating expression of the polypeptide or protein through inducible control elements<br>
may improve cell viability, cell density, and /or total yield of the expressed polypeptide<br>
or protein. A large number of control elements useful in the practice of the present<br>
invention are known and available in the art.<br>
Representative constitutive mammalian promoters that may be used in<br>
accordance with the present invention include, but are not limited to, the hypoxanthine<br>
phosphoribosyl transferase (HPTR) promoter, the adenosine deaminase promoter, the<br>
pyruvate kinase promoter, the beta-actin promoter as well as other constitutive promoters<br>
known to those of ordinary skill in the art. Additionally, viral prompters that have been<br>
shown to drive constitutive expression of coding sequences in eukaryotic cells include,<br>
for example, simian virus promoters, herpes simplex virus promoters, papilloma virus<br>
promoters, adenovirus promoters, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) promoters,<br>
Rous sarcoma virus promoters, cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoters, the long terminal<br>
repeats (LTRs) of Moloney murine leukemia virus and other retroviruses, the thymidine<br>
kinase promoter of herpes simplex virus as well as other viral promoters known to those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
Inducible promoters drive expression of operably linked coding sequences in the<br>
presence of an inducing agent and may also be used in accordance with the present<br>
invention. For example, in mammalian cells, the metallothionein promoter is induces<br>
transcription of downstream coding sequences in the presence of certain metal ions.<br>
Other inducible promoters will be recognized by and/or known to those of ordinary skill<br>
in the art.<br>
In general, the gene expression sequence will also include 5' non-transcribing and<br>
5' non-translating sequences involved with the initiation of transcription and translation,<br>
respectively, such as a TATA box, capping sequence, CAAT sequence, and the like.<br>
Enhancer elements can optionally be used to increase expression levels of the<br>
polypeptides or proteins to be expressed. Examples of enhancer elements that have been<br>
shown to function in mammalian cells include the SV40 early gene enhancer, as<br>
described in Dijkema et al., EMBO J. (1985) 4: 761 and the enhancer/promoter derived<br>
from the long terminal repeat (LTR) of the Rous Sarcoma Virus (RSV), as described in<br>
Gorman et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1982b) 79:6777 and human cytomegalovirus,<br>
as described in Boshart et al., Cell (1985) 41:521. • i<br>

coding sequence for expression in various mammalian cells under a variety of growth<br>
and induction conditions are also well known in the art.<br>

Methods suitable for introducing into mammalian host cells nucleic acids<br>
sufficient to achieve expression of the polypeptides or proteins of interest are well known<br>

invention can be used with either transiently or stably transfected mammalian cells.<br>
Cells<br>
Any mammalian cell or cell type susceptible to cell culture, and to expression of<br>
polypeptides, may be utilized in accordance with the present invention. Non-limiting<br>

G2). In a particularly preferred embodiment, the present invention is used in the<br>
culturing of and expression of polypeptides and proteins from CHO cell lines.<br>
Additionally, any number of commercially and non-comrnercially available<br>
hybridoma cell lines that express polypeptides or proteins may be utilized in accordance<br>
with the present invention. One skilled in the art will appreciate that hybridoma cell<br>
lines might have different nutrition requirements and/or might require different culture<br>
conditions for optimal growth and polypeptide or protein expression, and will be able to<br>
modify conditions as needed.<br>
As noted above, in many instances the cells will be selected or engineered to<br>
produce high levels of protein or polypeptide. Often, cells are genetically engineered to<br>
produce high levels of protein, for example by introduction of a gene encoding the<br>
protein or polypeptide of interest and/or by introduction of control elements that regulate<br>
expression of the gene (whether endogenous or introduced) encoding the polypeptide of<br>
interest.<br>
Certain polypeptides may have detrimental effects on cell growth, cell viability or<br>
some other characteristic of the cells that ultimately limits production of the polypeptide<br>
or protein of interest in some way. Even amongst a population of cells of one particular<br>
type engineered to express a specific polypeptide, variability within the cellular<br>
population exists such that certain individual cells will grow better and/or produce more<br>
polypeptide of interest. In certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, the<br>
cell line is empirically selected by the practitioner for robust growth under the particular<br>
conditions chosen for culturing the cells. In particularly preferred embodiments,<br>
individual cells engineered to express a particular polypeptide are chosen for large-scale<br>
production based on cell growth, final cell density, percent cell viability, titer of the<br>
expressed polypeptide or any combination of these or any other conditions deemed<br>
important by the practitioner.<br>
Cell Culture Phase<br>
Typical procedures for producing a polypeptide of interest include batch cultures<br>
and fed-batch cultures. Batch culture processes traditionally comprise inoculating a<br>
large-scale production culture with a seed culture of a particular cell density, growing the<br>
cells under conditions conducive to cell growth and viability, harvesting the culture when<br>
the cells reach a specified cell density, and purifying the expressed polypeptide. Fedbatch<br>
culture procedures include an additional step or steps of supplementing the batch<br>
culture with nutrients and other components that are consumed during the growth of the<br>
cells. A persistent and unsolved problem with traditional batch and fed-batch cultures is<br>
the production of metabolic waste products, which have detrimental effects on cell<br>
growth, viability, and production of expressed polypeptides. Two metabolic waste<br>
products that have particularly detrimental effects are lactate and ammonium, which are<br>
produced as a result of glucose and glutamine metabolism, respectively. In addition to<br>
the enzymatic production of ammonium as a result of glutamine metabolism, ammonium<br>
also accumulates in cell cultures as a result of non-metabolic degradation over time. The<br>
present invention provides an improved method of large-scale production of<br>
polypeptides that minimizes the detrimental effects of ammonium and lactate by slowing<br>
and even reversing the accumulation of these waste products in cell cultures. One of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the present invention can be employed in any<br>
system in which cells are cultured including, but not limited to, batch, fed-batch and<br>
perfusion systems. In certain preferred embodiments of the present invention, the cells<br>
are grown in batch or fed-batch systems.<br>
Media , ,<br>
Traditional media formulations, including commercially available media such as<br>
Ham's F10 (Sigma), Minimal Essential Medium ([MEM], Sigma), RPMI-1640 (Sigma),<br>
and Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's Medium ([DMEM], Sigma), have contained relatively<br>
high levels of glucose and glutamine in comparison to other amino acids. These<br>
components have been thought to be required in abundance since they are the primary<br>
metabolic energy sources for the cells. However, rapid consumption of these nutrients<br>
leads to the accumulation of lactate and ammonium as described above. Additionally,<br>
high initial levels of glucose and glutamine and the subsequent accumulation of lactate<br>
and ammonium result in high osmolarity, a condition that by itself is often detrimental to<br>
cell growth, cell viability and the production of polypeptides.<br>
The present invention provides a variety of media formulations that, when used in<br>
accordance with other culturing steps described herein, minimize and even reverse<br>
accumulation of lactate and ammonium. Media formulations of the present invention<br>
that have been shown to have beneficial effects on cell growth and/or viability or on<br>
expression of polypeptide or protein include one or more of: i) a cumulative amino acid<br>
amount per unit volume greater than about 70 mM, ii) a molar cumulative glutamine to<br>
cumulative asparagine ratio of less than about 2, iii) a molar cumulative glutamine to<br>
cumulative total amino acid ratio of less than about 0.2, iv) a molar cumulative inorganic<br>
ion to cumulative total amino acid ratio between about 0.4 to 1, and v) a combined<br>
cumulative amount of glutamine and asparagine per unit volume greater than about 16<br>
mM. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that "cumulative", as used above,<br>
refers to the total amount of a particular component or components added over the course<br>
of the cell culture, including components added at the beginning of the culture and<br>
subsequently added components. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that the<br>
media formulations of the present invention encompass both defined and non-defined<br>
media.<br>
Traditional media formulations begin with a relatively low level of total amino<br>
acids in comparison with the media formulations of the present invention. For example,<br>
the traditional cell culture medium known as DME-F12 (a 50:50 mixture of Dulbecco's<br>
Modified Eagle's medium and Ham's F12 medium) has a total amino acid content of 7.29<br>
mM, and the traditional cell culture medium known as RPMI-1640 has a total amino acid<br>
content of 6.44 mM (See e.g., H.J. Morton, In Vitro, 6:89-108 (1970), R.G. Ham, Proc.<br>
Nat. Assoc. Sci. (USA), 53:288-293 (1965), G.E. Moore et al., J. Am. Medical Assn.,<br>
199:519-24 (1967), all incorporated herein by reference). In certain embodiments of the<br>
present invention, the amino acid concentration in the culture media is preferably greater<br>
than about 70 mM. More preferably still, the media formulations of the present<br>
invention contain amino acid concentrations greater than about 70 mM in the starting<br>
media. It has been shown that when amino acid concentrations of the starting media are<br>
in this range, cell density and titer are increased throughout the growth period of the<br>
culture (see Example 13).<br>
Additionally, in certain embodiments of the present invention, the molar ratio of<br>
glutamine to asparagine in the culture media is reduced compared to other commercially<br>
and non-commercially available media. Preferably the molar ratio of glutamine to<br>
asparagine in the culture media is less than about two.<br>
Additionally, in certain embodiments of the present invention, the molar ratio of<br>
glutamine to total amino acids in the culture media is reduced compared to other<br>
commercially and non-commercially available media. Preferably the molar ratio of<br>
glutamine to total amino acids in the culture media less than about 0.2.<br>
An interesting and unexpected result of lowering the molar ratio of glutamine to<br>
asparagine or to the total concentration of amino acids in the starting media according to<br>
the present invention was that in addition to an observed decrease in the accumulation of<br>
ammonium, a decrease in the accumulation of lactate was seen as well. In certain<br>
embodiments, the accumulated levels of ammonium and lactate are r&gt;ot only lower than<br>
those in control cultures, but in fact actually decrease after an initial accumulation (for<br>
example, see Examples 3 and 7).<br>
Boraston (US Patent Number 5,871,999) has disclosed a culture medium in<br>
which the molar ratio of total inorganic ions to total amino acids is between 1 and 10.<br>
Boraston showed that by providing culture medium in which the molar ratio of total<br>
inorganic ions to total amino acids is in this range, aggregation of CHO cells grown in<br>
the medium is decreased. In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
molar ratio of total inorganic ions to total amino acids in the culture medium is reduced<br>
even further, to between about 0.4 to 1. As shown in Example 13, reducing this ratio<br>
from 1.75 to approximately 0.7 results in a marked increase in cell density and<br>
production of expressed polypeptide or protein throughout the growth period of the<br>
culture.<br>
In another preferred embodiment of the present invention, the culture medium<br>
contains a combined glutamine and asparagine concentration of between about 16 and 36<br>
mM. As shown in Example 14, Table 22, media which contain a combined total<br>
concentration of glutamine and asparagine within this range exhibit higher titers of<br>
expressed polypeptide than media which contain a combined total glutamine and<br>
asparagine outside this range. One of ordinary skill in the art will be able to choose the<br>
exact combined glutamine and asparagine concentration within this range in order to<br>
optimize cell growth and/or viability and to maximize the production of the expressed<br>
polypeptide.<br>
Furthermore, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that any of the<br>
conditions listed above may be used either singly or in various combinations with one<br>
another. By utilizing media formulation which exhibit one, some or all of the above<br>
characteristics, one of ordinary skill in the art will be able to optimize cell growth and/or<br>
viability and to maximize the production of the expressed polypeptide.<br>
Any of these media formulations disclosed in the present invention may<br>
optionally be supplemented as necessary with hormones and/or other growth factors,<br>
particular ions (such as sodium, chloride, calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers,<br>
vitamins, nucleosides or nucleotides, trace elements (inorganic compounds usually<br>
present at very low final concentrations), amino acids, lipids, protein hydrolysates, or<br>
glucose or other energy source. In certain embodiments of the present invention, it may<br>
be beneficial to supplement the media with chemical inductants such as hexamethylenebis(<br>
acetamide) ("HMBA") and sodium butyrate ("NaB"). These optional supplements<br>
may be added at the beginning of the culture or may be added at a later point in order to<br>
replenish depleted nutrients or for another reason. One of ordinary skill in the art will be<br>
aware of any desirable or necessary supplements that may be included in the disclosed<br>
media formulations.<br>
Providing a mammalian cell culture<br>
Various methods of preparing mammalian cells for production of proteins or<br>
polypeptides by batch and fed-batch culture are well known in the art. As described<br>
above, a nucleic acid sufficient to achieve expression (typically a vector containing the<br>
gene encoding the polypeptide or protein of interest and any operably linked genetic<br>
control elements) may be introduced into the host cell line by any number of well-known<br>
techniques. Typically, cells are screened to determine which of the host cells have<br>
actually taken up the vector and express the polypeptide or protein of interest.<br>
Traditional methods of detecting a particular polypeptide or protein of interest expressed<br>
by mammalian cells include but are not limited to immunohistochemistry,<br>
immunoprecipitation, flow cytometry, immunofluorescence microscopy, SDS-PAGE,<br>
Western blots, enzyme-linked immunosorbentassay (ELISA), high performance liquid<br>
chromatography (HPLC) techniques, biological activity assays and affinity<br>
chromatography. One of ordinary skill in the art will be aware of other appropriate<br>
techniques for detecting expressed polypeptides or proteins. If multiple host cells<br>
express the polypeptide or protein of interest, some or all of the listed techniques can be<br>
used to determine which of the cells expresses that polypeptide or protein at the highest<br>
levels.<br>
Once a cell that expresses the polypeptide or protein of interest has been<br>
identified, the cell is propagated in culture by any of the variety of methods well-known<br>
to one of ordinary skill in the art. The cell expressing the polypeptide or protein of<br>
interest is typically propagated by growing it at a temperature and in a medium that is<br>
conducive to the survival, growth and viability of the cell. The initial culture volume can<br>
be of any size, but is often smaller than the culture volume of the production bioreactor<br>
used in the final production of the polypeptide or protein of interest, and frequently cells<br>
are passaged several times in bioreactors of increasing volume prior to seeding the<br>
production bioreactor. The cell culture can be agitated or shaken to increase oxygenation<br>
of the medium and dispersion of nutrients to the cells. Alternatively or additionally,<br>
special sparging devices that are well known in the art can be used to increase and<br>
control oxygenation of the culture. In accordance with the present invention, one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art will understand that it can be beneficial to control or regulate<br>
certain internal conditions of the bioreactor, including but not limited to pH, temperature,<br>
oxygenation, etc.<br>
The starting cell density in the production bioreactor can be chosen by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. In accordance with the present invention, the starting cell<br>
density in the production bioreactor can be as low as a single cell per culture volume. In<br>
preferred embodiments of the present invention, starting cell densities in the production<br>
bioreactor can range from about 2 x 102 viable cells per mL to about 2 x 103, 2 x 104, 2 x<br>
105, 2 x 106, 5 x 106 or 10 x 106 viable cells per mL and higher.<br>
Initial and intermediate cell cultures may be grown to any desired density before<br>
seeding the next intermediate or final production bioreactor. It is preferred that most of<br>
the cells remain alive prior to seeding, although total or near total viability is not<br>
required. In one embodiment of the present invention, the cells may be removed from<br>
the supernatant, for example, by low-speed centrifugation. It may also be desirable to<br>
wash the removed cells with a medium before seeding the next bioreactor to remove any<br>
unwanted metabolic waste products or medium components. The medium may be the<br>
medium in which the cells were previously grown or it may be a different medium or a<br>
washing solution selected by the practitioner of the present invention.<br>
The cells may then be diluted to an appropriate density for seeding the production<br>
bioreactor. In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the cells are diluted into<br>
the same medium that will be used in the production bioreactor. Alternatively, the cells<br>
can be diluted into another medium or solution, depending on the needs and desires of<br>
the practitioner of the present invention or to accommodate particular requirements of the<br>
cells themselves, for example, if they are to be stored for a short period of time prior to<br>
seeding the production bioreactor.<br>
Initial Growth Phase<br>
Once the production bioreactor has been seeded as described above, the cell<br>
culture is maintained in the initial growth phase under conditions conducive to the<br>
survival, growth and viability of the cell culture. The precise conditions will vary<br>
depending on the cell type, the organism from which the cell was derived, and the nature<br>
and character of the expressed polypeptide or protein.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the production bioreactor can be any<br>
volume that is appropriate for large-scale production of polypeptides or proteins. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the volume of the production bioreactor is at least 500 liters. In<br>
other preferred embodiments, the volume of the production bioreactor is 1000, 2500,<br>
5000, 8000, 10,000, 12,000 liters or more, or any volume in between. One of ordinary<br>
skill in the art will be aware of and will be able to choose a suitable bioreactor for use in<br>
practicing the present invention. The production bioreactor may be constructed of any<br>
material that is conducive to cell growth and viability that does not interfere with<br>
expression or stability of the produced polypeptide or protein.<br>
The temperature of the cell culture in the initial growth phase will be selected<br>
based primarily on the range of temperatures at which the cell culture remains viable.<br>
For example, during the initial growth phase, CHO cells grow well at 37°C. In general,<br>
most mammalian cells grow well within a range of about 25°C to 42°C. Preferably,<br>
mammalian cells grow well within the range of about 35°C to 40°C. Those of ordinary<br>
skill in the art will be able to select appropriate temperature or temperatures in which to<br>
grow cells, depending on the needs of the cells and the production requirements of the<br>
practitioner.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the temperature of the initial growth<br>
phase is maintained at a single, constant temperature. In another embodiment, the<br>
temperature of the initial growth phase is maintained within a range of temperatures. For<br>
30<br>
example, the temperature may be steadily increased or decreased during the initial<br>
growth phase. Alternatively, the temperature may be increased or decreased by discrete<br>
amounts at various times during the initial growth phase. One of ordinary skill in the art<br>
will be able to determine whether a single or multiple temperatures should be used, and<br>
whether the temperature should be adjusted steadily or by discrete amounts.<br>
The cells may be grown during the initial growth phase for a greater or lesser<br>
amount of time, depending on the needs of the practitioner and the requirement of the<br>
cells themselves. In one embodiment, the cells are grown for a period of time sufficient<br>
to achieve a viable cell density that is a given percentage of the maximal viable cell<br>
density that the cells would eventually reach if allowed to grow undisturbed. For<br>
example, the cells may be grown for a period of time sufficient to achieve a desired<br>
viable cell density of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85,<br>
90, 95 or 99 percent of maximal viable cell density.<br>
In another embodiment the cells are allowed to grow for a defined period of time.<br>
For example, depending on the starting concentration of the cell culture, the temperature<br>
at which the cells are grown, and the intrinsic growth rate of the cells] the cells may be<br>
grown for 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20 or more<br>
days. In some cases, the cells may be allowed to grow for a month or more. The cells<br>
would be grown for 0 days in the production bioreactor if their growth in a seed<br>
bioreactor, at the initial growth phase temperature, was sufficient that the viable cell<br>
density in the production bioreactor at the time of its inoculation is already at the desired<br>
percentage of the maximal viable cell density. The practitioner of the present invention<br>
will be able to choose the duration of the initial growth phase depending on polypeptide<br>
or protein production requirements and the needs of the cells themselves.<br>
The cell culture may be agitated or shaken during the initial culture phase in<br>
order to increase oxygenation and dispersion of nutrients to the cells. In accordance with<br>
the present invention, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that it can be<br>
beneficial to control or regulate certain internal conditions of the bioreactor during the<br>
initial growth phase, including but not limited to pH, temperature, oxygenation, etc. For<br>
example, pH can be controlled by supplying an appropriate amount of acid or base and<br>
oxygenation can be controlled with sparging devices that are well known in the art.<br>
Shifting Culture Conditions<br>
In accordance with the teaching of the present invention, at the end of the initial<br>
growth phase, at least one of the culture conditions may be shifted so that a second set of<br>
culture conditions is applied and a metabolic shift occurs in the culture. The<br>
accumulation of inhibitory metabolites, most notably lactate and ammonia, inhibits<br>
growth. A metabolic shift, accomplished by, e.g., a change in the temperature, pH,<br>
osmolality or chemical inductant level of the cell culture, may be characterized by a<br>
reduction in the ratio of a specific lactate production rate to a specific glucose<br>
consumption rate. In one non-limiting embodiment, the culture conditions are shifted by<br>
shifting the temperature of the culture. However, as is known in the art, shifting<br>
temperature is not the only mechanism through which an appropriate metabolic shift can<br>
be achieved. For example, such a metabolic shift can also be achieved by shifting other<br>
culture conditions including, but not limited to, pH, osmolality, and sodium butyrate<br>
levels. As discussed above, the timing of the culture shift will be determined by the<br>
practitioner of the present invention, based on polypeptide or protein production<br>
requirements or the needs of the cells themselves.<br>
When shifting the temperature of the culture, the temperature shift may be<br>
relatively gradual. For example, it may take several hours or days to complete the<br>
temperature change. Alternatively, the temperature shift may be relatively abrupt. For<br>
example, the temperature change may be complete in less than several hours. Given the<br>
appropriate production and control equipment, such as is standard ,in the commercial<br>
large-scale production of polypeptides or proteins, the temperature change may even be<br>
complete within less than an hour.<br>
The temperature of the cell culture in the subsequent growth phase will be<br>
selected based primarily on the range of temperatures at which the cell culture remains<br>
viable and expresses recombinant polypeptides or proteins at commercially adequate<br>
levels. In general, most mammalian cells remain viable and express recombinant<br>
polypeptides or proteins at commercially adequate levels within a range of about 25°C to<br>
42°C. Preferably, mammalian cells remain viable and express recombinant polypeptides<br>
or proteins at commercially adequate levels within a range of about 25°C to 35°C. Those<br>
of ordinary skill in the art will be able to select appropriate temperature or temperatures<br>
in which to grow cells, depending on the needs of the cells and the production<br>
requirements of the practitioner.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, the temperature of the subsequent<br>
growth phase is maintained at a single, constant temperature. In another embodiment,<br>
the temperature of the subsequent growth phase is maintained within a range of<br>
temperatures. For example, the temperature may be steadily increased or decreased<br>
during the subsequent growth phase. Alternatively, the temperature may be increased or<br>
decreased by discrete amounts at various times during the subsequent growth phase.<br>
One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that multiple discrete temperature shifts<br>
are encompassed in this embodiment. For example, the temperature may be shifted<br>
once, the cells maintained at this temperature or temperature range for a certain period of<br>
time, after which the temperature may be shifted again - either to a higher or lower<br>
temperature. The temperature of the culture after each discrete shift may be constant or<br>
may be maintained within a certain range of temperatures.<br>
In Example 16, data are shown that demonstrate the efficacy of employing two<br>
successive temperature changes, although it will be understood by those of ordinary skill<br>
in the art that in accordance with the present invention, three or more successive<br>
temperature changes may be used to increase cell viability or density and/or increase<br>
expression of recombinant polypeptides or proteins. The temperature or temperature<br>
ranges of the cell culture after each successive temperature shift may be higher or lower<br>
than the temperature(s) or temperature range(s) preceding the shift. In a preferred<br>
embodiment of the present invention, each successive temperature or temperature range<br>
is lower than the preceding temperature or temperature range.<br>
Subsequent Production Phase<br>
In accordance with the present invention, once the conditions of the cell culture<br>
have been shifted as discussed above, the cell culture is maintained for a subsequent<br>
production phase under a second set of culture conditions conducive 'to the survival and<br>
viability of the cell culture and appropriate for expression of the desired polypeptide or<br>
protein at commercially adequate levels.<br>
As discussed above, the culture may be shifted by shifting one or more of a<br>
number of culture conditions including, but not limited to, temperature, pH, osmolality,<br>
and sodium butyrate levels. In one embodiment, the temperature of the culture is shifted.<br>
According to this embodiment, during the subsequent production phase, the culture is<br>
maintained at a temperature or temperature range that is lower than the temperature or<br>
temperature range of the initial growth phase. For example, during the subsequent<br>
production phase, CHO cells express recombinant polypeptides and proteins well within<br>
a range of 25°C to 35°C. As discussed above, multiple discrete temperature shifts may<br>
be employed to increase cell density or viability or to increase expression of the<br>
33<br>
recombinant polypeptide or protein.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the cells may be maintained in the<br>
subsequent production phase until a desired cell density or production titer is reached. In<br>
one embodiment, the cells are maintained in the subsequent production phase until the<br>
titer to the recombinant polypeptide or protein reaches a maximum. In other<br>
embodiments, the culture may be harvested prior to this point, depending on the<br>
production requirement of the practitioner or the needs of the cells themselves. For<br>
example, the cells may be maintained for a period of time sufficient to achieve a viable<br>
cell density of 1, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45, 50, 55, 60, 65, 70, 75, 80, 85, 90, 95 or<br>
99 percent of maximal viable cell density. In some cases, it may be desirable to allow<br>
the viable cell density to reach a maximum, and then allow the viable cell density to<br>
decline to some level before harvesting the culture. In an extreme example, it may be<br>
desirable to allow the viable cell density to approach or reach zero before harvesting the<br>
culture.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the cells are allowed to grow for<br>
a defined period of time during the subsequent production phase. For example,<br>
depending on the concentration of the cell culture at the start of the subsequent growth<br>
phase, the temperature at which the cells are grown, and the intrinsic growth rate of the<br>
cells, the cells may be grown for 1,2, 3,4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18,<br>
19, 20 or more days. In some cases, the cells may be allowed to grow for a month or<br>
more. The practitioner of the present invention will be able to choose the duration of the<br>
subsequent production phase depending on polypeptide or protein production<br>
requirements and the needs of the cells themselves.<br>
In certain cases, it may be beneficial or necessary to supplement the cell culture<br>
during the subsequent production phase with nutrients or other medium components that<br>
have been depleted or metabolized by the cells. For example, it might be advantageous<br>
to supplement the cell culture with nutrients or other medium components observed to<br>
have been depleted during monitoring of the cell culture (see 'Monitoring Culture<br>
Conditions' section below). Alternatively or additionally, it may be beneficial or<br>
necessary to supplement the cell culture prior to the subsequent production phase. As<br>
non-limiting examples, it may be beneficial or necessary to supplement the cell culture<br>
with hormones and/or other growth factors, particular ions (such as sodium, chloride,<br>
calcium, magnesium, and phosphate), buffers, vitamins, nucleosides or nucleotides, trace<br>
elements (inorganic compounds usually present at very low final concentrations), amino<br>
34<br>
acids, lipids, or glucose or other energy source.<br>
These supplementary components may all be added to the cell culture at one<br>
time, or they may be provided to the cell culture in a series of additions. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, the supplementary components are provided to the<br>
cell culture at multiple times in proportional amounts. In another embodiment, it may be<br>
desirable to provide only certain of the supplementary components initially, and provide<br>
the remaining components at a later time. In yet another embodiment of the present<br>
invention, the cell culture is fed continually with these supplementary components.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the total volume added to the cell<br>
culture should optimally be kept to a minimal amount. For example, the total volume of<br>
the medium or solution containing the supplementary components added to the cell<br>
culture may be 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35, 40, 45 or 50% of the volume<br>
of the cell culture prior to providing the supplementary components.<br>
The cell culture may be agitated or shaken during the subsequent production<br>
phase in order to increase oxygenation and dispersion of nutrients to the cells. In<br>
accordance with the present invention, one of ordinary skill in the art will understand that<br>
it can be beneficial to control or regulate certain internal conditions of the bioreactor<br>
during the subsequent growth phase, including but not limited to pH, temperature,<br>
oxygenation, etc. For example, pH can be controlled by supplying an appropriate<br>
amount of acid or base and oxygenation can be controlled with sparging devices that are<br>
well known in the art.<br>
Monitoring culture conditions<br>
In certain embodiments of the present invention, the practitioner may find it<br>
beneficial or necessary to periodically monitor particular conditions of the growing cell<br>
culture. Monitoring cell culture conditions allows the practitioner to determine whether<br>
the cell culture is producing recombinant polypeptide or protein at suboptimal levels or<br>
whether the culture is about to enter into a suboptimal production phase. In order to<br>
monitor certain cell culture conditions, it will be necessary to remove small aliquots of<br>
the culture for analysis. One of ordinary skill in the art will understand that such<br>
removal may potentially introduce contamination into the cell culture, and will take<br>
appropriate care to minimize the risk of such contamination.<br>
As non-limiting example, it may be beneficial or necessary to monitor<br>
temperature, pH, cell density, cell viability, integrated viable cell density, lactate levels,<br>
35<br>
ammonium levels, osmolarity, or titer of the expressed polypeptide or protein.<br>
Numerous techniques are well known in the art that will allow one of ordinary skill in<br>
the art to measure these conditions. For example, cell density may be measured using a<br>
hemacytometer, a Coulter counter, or Cell density examination (CEDEX). Viable cell<br>
density may be determined by staining a culture sample with Trypan blue. Since only<br>
dead cells take up the Trypan blue, viable cell density can be determined by counting the<br>
total number of cells, dividing the number of cells that take up the, dye by the total<br>
number of cells, and taking the reciprocal. HPLC can be used to determine the levels of<br>
lactate, ammonium or the expressed polypeptide or protein. Alternatively, the level of<br>
the expressed polypeptide or protein can be determined by standard molecular biology<br>
techniques such as coomassie staining of SDS-PAGE gels, Western blotting, Bradford<br>
assays, Lowry assays, Biuret assays, and UV absorbance. It may also be beneficial or<br>
necessary to monitor the post-translational modifications of the expressed polypeptide or<br>
protein, including phosphprylation and glycosylation.<br>
Isolation of Expressed Polvpeptide<br>
In general, it will typically be desirable to isolate and/or purify proteins or<br>
polypeptides expressed according to the present invention. In a preferred embodiment,<br>
the expressed polypeptide or protein is secreted into the medium and thus cells and other<br>
solids may be removed, as by centrifugation or filtering for example, as a first step in the<br>
purification process. This embodiment is particularly useful when Used in accordance<br>
with the present invention, since the methods and compositions described herein result in<br>
increased cell viability. As a result, fewer cells die during the culture process, and fewer<br>
proteolytic enzymes are released into the medium which can potentially decrease the<br>
yield of the expressed polypeptide or protein.<br>
Alternatively, the expressed polypeptide or protein is bound to the surface of the<br>
host cell. In this embodiment, the media is removed and the host cells expressing the<br>
polypeptide or protein are lysed as a first step in the purification process. Lysis of<br>
mammalian host cells can be achieved by any number of means well known to those of<br>
ordinary skill in the art, including physical disruption by glass beads and exposure to<br>
high pH conditions.<br>
The polypeptide or protein may be isolated and purified by standard methods<br>
including, but not limited to, chromatography (e.g., ion exchange, affinity, size<br>
exclusion, and hydroxyapatite chromatography), gel filtration, centrifugation, or<br>
36<br>
differential solubility, ethanol precipitation or by any other available technique for the<br>
purification of proteins (See, e.g., Scopes, Protein Purification Principles and Practice<br>
2nd Edition, Springer-Verlag, New York, 1987; Higgins, S.J. and Hames, B.D. (eds.),<br>
Protein Expression : A Practical Approach, Oxford Univ Press, 1999; and Deutscher,<br>
M.P., Simon, M.I., Abelson, J.N. (eds.), Guide to Protein Purification : Methods in<br>
Enzymology (Methods in Enzymology Series, Vol 182), Academic, Press, 1997, all<br>
incorporated herein by reference). For immunoaffinity chromatography in particular, the<br>
protein may be isolated by binding it to an affinity column comprising antibodies that<br>
were raised against that protein and were affixed to a stationary support. Alternatively,<br>
affinity tags such as an influenza coat sequence, poly-histidine, or glutathione-Stransferase<br>
can be attached to the protein by standard recombinant techniques to allow<br>
for easy purification by passage over the appropriate affinity column. Protease inhibitors<br>
such as phenyl methyl sulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), leupeptin, pepstatin or aprotinin may be<br>
added at any or all stages in order to reduce or eliminate degradation of the polypeptide<br>
or protein during the purification process. Protease inhibitors are particularly desired<br>
when cells must be lysed in order to isolate and purify the expressed polypeptide or<br>
protein. One of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the exact purification<br>
technique will vary depending on the character of the polypeptide or protein to be<br>
purified, the character of the cells from which the polypeptide or protein is expressed,<br>
and the composition of the medium in which the cells were grown. ' :<br>
Pharmaceutical Formulations<br>
In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, produced polypeptides or<br>
proteins will have pharmacologic activity and will be useful in the preparation of<br>
Pharmaceuticals. Inventive compositions as described above may be administered to a<br>
subject or may first be formulated for delivery by any available route including, but not<br>
limited to parenteral (e.g., intravenous), intradermal, subcutaneous, oral, nasal,<br>
bronchial, opthalmic, transdermal (topical), transmucosal, rectal, and vaginal routes.<br>
Inventive pharmaceutical compositions typically include a purified polypeptide or<br>
protein expressed from a mammalian cell line, a delivery agent (i.e., a cationic polymer,<br>
peptide molecular transporter, surfactant, etc., as described above) in combination with a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. As used herein the language "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier" includes solvents, dispersion media, coatings, antibacterial and<br>
antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, and the like1, compatible with<br>
37<br>
pharmaceutical administration. Supplementary active compounds can also be<br>
incorporated into the compositions.<br>
A pharmaceutical composition is formulated to be compatible with its intended<br>
route of administration. Solutions or suspensions used for parenteral, intradermal, or<br>
subcutaneous application can include the following components: a sterile diluent such as<br>
water for injection, saline solution, fixed oils, polyethylene glycols, glycerine, propylene<br>
glycol or other synthetic solvents; antibacterial agents such as benzyl alcohol or methyl<br>
parabens; antioxidants such as ascorbic acid or sodium bisulfite; chelating agents such as<br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid; buffers such as acetates, citrates or phosphates and<br>
agents for the adjustment of tonicity such as sodium chloride or dextrose. pH can be<br>
adjusted with acids or bases, such as hydrochloric acid or sodium hydroxide. The<br>
parenteral preparation can be enclosed in ampoules, disposable syringes or multiple dose<br>
vials made of glass or plastic.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for injectable use typically include sterile<br>
aqueous solutions (where water soluble) or dispersions and sterile powders for the<br>
extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersion. For intravenous<br>
administration, suitable carriers include physiological saline, bacteriostatic water,<br>
Cremophor EL™ (BASF, Parsippany, NJ) or phosphate buffered saline (PBS). In all<br>
cases, the composition should be sterile and should be fluid to the extent that easy<br>
syringability exists. Preferred pharmaceutical formulations are stable under 1 i the<br>
conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating<br>
action of microorganisms such as bacteria and fungi. In general, the relevant carrier can<br>
be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (for<br>
example, glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyetheylene glycol, and the like), and<br>
suitable mixtures thereof. The proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use<br>
of a coating such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required particle size in the case<br>
of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. Prevention of the action of microorganisms<br>
can be achieved by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens,<br>
chlorobutanol, phenol, ascorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be<br>
preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, polyalcohols such as manitol,<br>
sorbitol, or sodium chloride in the composition. Prolonged absorption of the injectable<br>
compositions can be brought about by including in the composition an agent which<br>
delays absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
38<br>
Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the purified<br>
polypeptide or protein in the required amount in an appropriate solvent with one or a<br>
combination of ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered<br>
sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the purified<br>
polypeptide or protein expressed from a mammalian cell line into a sterile vehicle which<br>
contains a basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those<br>
enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable<br>
solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum drying and freeze-drying<br>
which yields a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient<br>
from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.<br>
Oral compositions generally include an inert diluent or an edible carrier. For the<br>
purpose of oral therapeutic administration, the purified polypeptide or protein can be<br>
incorporated with excipients and used in the form of tablets, troches, or capsules, e.g.,<br>
gelatin capsules. Oral compositions can also be prepared using a fluid carrier for use as<br>
a mouthwash. Pharmaceutically compatible binding agents, and/or adjuvant materials<br>
can be included as part of the composition. The tablets, pills, capsules, troches and the<br>
like can contain any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a similar nature: a<br>
binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatin; an excipient such as<br>
starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or corn starch; a<br>
lubricant such as magnesium stearate or Sterotes; a glidant such as colloidal silicon<br>
dioxide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as<br>
peppermint, methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring. Formulations for oral delivery may<br>
advantageously incorporate agents to improve stability within the gastrointestinal tract<br>
and/or to enhance absorption.<br>
For administration by inhalation, the inventive compositions comprising a<br>
purified polypeptide or protein expressed from a mammalian cell line and a delivery<br>
agent are preferably delivered in the form of an aerosol spray from a pressured container<br>
or dispenser which contains a suitable propellant, e.g., a gas such as carbon dioxide, or a<br>
nebulizer. The present invention particularly contemplates delivery of the compositions<br>
using a nasal spray, inhaler, or other direct delivery to the upper and/or lower airway.<br>
Intranasal administration of DNA vaccines directed against influenza viruses has been<br>
shown to induce CDS T cell responses, indicating that at least some cells in the<br>
respiratory tract can take up DNA when delivered by this route, and the delivery agents<br>
of the invention will enhance cellular uptake. According to certain embodiments of the<br>
39<br>
invention the compositions comprising a purified polypeptide expressed from a<br>
mammalian cell line and a delivery agent are formulated as large porous particles for<br>
aerosol administration.<br>
Systemic administration can also be by transmucosal or transdermal means. For<br>
transmucosal or transdermal administration, penetrants appropriate to the barrier to be<br>
permeated are used in the formulation. Such penetrants are generally known in the art,<br>
and include, for example, for transmucosal administration, detergents, bile salts, and<br>
fusidic acid derivatives. Transmucosal administration can be accomplished through the<br>
use of nasal sprays or suppositories. For transdermal administration, the purified<br>
polypeptide or protein and delivery agents are formulated into ointments, salves, gels, or<br>
creams as generally known in the art.<br>
The compositions can also be prepared in the form of suppositories (e.g., with<br>
conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter and other glycerides) or retention<br>
enemas for rectal delivery.<br>
In one embodiment, the compositions are prepared with carriers that will protect<br>
the polypeptide or protein against rapid elimination from the body, such as a controlled<br>
release formulation, including implants and microencapsulated delivery systems.<br>
Biodegradable, biocompatible polymers can be used, such as ethylene vinyl acetate,<br>
polyanhydrides, polyglycolic acid, collagen, polyorthoesters, and polylactic acid.<br>
Methods for preparation of such formulations will be apparent to those skilled in the art.<br>
The materials can also be obtained commercially from Alza Corporation and Nova<br>
Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Liposomal suspensions (including liposomes targeted to infected<br>
cells with monoclonal antibodies to viral antigens) can also be used as pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers. These can be prepared according to methods known to those skilled<br>
in the art, for example, as described in U.S. Patent No. 4,522,811.<br>
It is advantageous to formulate oral or parenteral compositions in dosage unit<br>
form for ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. Dosage unit form as used<br>
herein refers to physically discrete units suited as unitary dosages for the subject to be<br>
treated; each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active polypeptide or protein<br>
calculated to produce the desired therapeutic effect in association with the required<br>
pharmaceutical carrier.<br>
The polypeptide or protein expressed according to the present invention can be<br>
administered at various intervals and over different periods of time as required, e.g., one<br>
time per week for between about 1 to 10 weeks, between 2 to 8 weeks, between about 3<br>
40<br>
to 7 weeks, about 4, 5, or 6 weeks, etc. The skilled artisan will appreciate that certain<br>
factors can influence the dosage and timing required to effectively treat a subject,<br>
including but not limited to the severity of the disease or disorder, previous treatments,<br>
the general health and/or age of the subject, and other diseases present. Generally,<br>
treatment of a subject with a polypeptide or protein as described herein can include a<br>
single treatment or, in many cases, can include a series of treatments. It is furthermore<br>
understood that appropriate doses may depend upon the potency of the polypeptide or<br>
protein and may optionally be tailored to the particular recipient, for example, through<br>
administration of increasing doses until a preselected desired response is achieved. It is<br>
understood that the specific dose level for any particular animal subject may depend<br>
upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific polypeptide or protein<br>
employed, the age, body weight, general health, gender, and diet of the subject, the time<br>
of administration, the route of administration, the rate of excretion, any drug<br>
combination, and the degree of expression or activity to be modulated.<br>
The present invention includes the use of inventive compositions for treatment of<br>
nonhuman animals. Accordingly, doses and methods of administration may be selected<br>
in accordance with known principles of veterinary pharmacology and medicine.<br>
Guidance may be found, for example, in Adams, R. (ed.), Veterinary Pharmacology and<br>
Therapeutics, 8th edition, Iowa State University Press; ISBN: 0813817439; 2001.<br>
Inventive pharmaceutical compositions can be included in a container, pack, or<br>
dispenser together with instructions for administration.<br>
The foregoing description is to be understood as being representative only and is not<br>
intended to be limiting. Alternative methods and materials for implementing the<br>
invention and also additional applications will be apparent to one of skill in the art, and<br>
are intended to be included within the accompanying claims.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1: Enhanced Medium 1 for anti-GDF-8 Fed-batch Process<br>
Traditional fed-batch processes for cultivating cell lines have several drawbacks<br>
including the time and effort required to administer the feeds and the need for special<br>
equipment in large-scale bioreactors. The objective was to develop a batch media for the<br>
production of proteins of interest in large-scale bioreactors that requires minimal feeds.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
41<br>
STRAINS AND MEDIA: Chinese Hamster Ovary ("CHO") cells were<br>
engineered to express a monoclonal antibody against growth and differentiation factor 8<br>
("anti-GDF-8 cells") (see Veldman et al., Neutralizing Antibodies Against GDF-8 and<br>
Uses Therefor. US20040142382 Al). Anti-GDF-8 cells were used to test a new batch<br>
media. Medium 1 and Medium 2 were compared for their abilities to support high cell<br>
density and viability. The compositions of these media, as well as Medium 3 are listed<br>
in Table 1. Media are made by adding all the components save for FeSCVTFbO. The<br>
media is then adjusted to pH 7.25, the osmolarity is recorded and FeSO4«7H2O are then<br>
added.<br>
CULTURE CONDITIONS: For flask experiments, anti-GDF-8 cells were grown<br>
in shake flasks and passaged three times. For bioreactor experiments, anti-GDF-8 cells<br>
were grown in media for 12 days, supplemented daily with either 2% by volume of 20X<br>
Medium 4 feed medium (Table 3) or 3% by volume of 16X Medium 4 (Table 4) after<br>
day 5. For the first 4 days, cells were grown at 37°C. On day 5, cells were shifted to<br>
SAMPLE ANALYSIS: Daily samples were taken from the cultures and were<br>
analyzed for amino acid, vitamin, iron, phosphate, glucose and glutamine levels.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
 Figure 1 shows that growth rate of anti-GDF-8 cells was similar in both Medium<br>
1 and Medium 2 in the flask experiments.<br>
Figure 2 shows that in bioreactors, Medium 1 exhibited a significant increase in<br>
final cell density and viability over Medium 3. The final titer also increased<br>
significantly, from 551 mg/L for the platform process to 976 mg/L with Medium l(data<br>
not shown). Temperature was shifted from 37°C to 31°C on day 5. Due to the<br>
unexpected high cell growth, the cultures were fed daily after day 5 with either 2% by<br>
volume of 20X Medium 4 or 3% by volume of 16X Medium 4. Thus, this is not a true<br>
batch experiment as originally intended. Asparagine and thiamine were supplemented in<br>
the feed media beginning on day 10.<br>
In developing a concentrated batch media, several possible concerns need to be<br>
considered. First, concentrated nutrients might prove toxic to the cells. In the media<br>
developed in this Example, all nutrients and components were deterrnined to be below<br>
the toxicity limits (data not shown).<br>
Second, the concentrated batch media necessarily has a higher osmolarity than<br>
non-concentrated media, which has been shown to have detrimental effects on cell<br>
growth and viability. This problem can be circumvented by lowering the amount of<br>
NaCl in the starting media. Furthermore, the concentrated batch media contains<br>
insufficient levels of glucose to sustain growth for the entire culture period. Thus,<br>
cultures were supplemented daily after day 5 with a glucose feed.<br>
Third, insulin and glutamine are susceptible to degradation during the 12 day<br>
culture period. Thus, the culture was supplemented with these components in addition to<br>
glucose.<br>
Finally, iron will precipitate out of solution containing high concentrations of<br>
phosphate at high pH. This problem can be circumvented by adding iron at the end of<br>
the media preparation process, after the pH has been adjusted to an appropriate level.<br><br>
Example 2: Development of concentrated feed medium (Medium 5) for anti-GDF-8<br>
cells in fed-batch process.<br>
In Example 1, a batch process for culturing anti-GDF-8 cells using Medium 1 was<br>
developed. Due to the high cell density that resulted during the process, it was<br>
determined that supplementation of nutrients in addition to glucose and glutamine was<br>
still advantageous. However, supplementing the batch with 8X Medium 4 feed media<br>
would result in excessive dilution of the culture. A more concentrated feed media was<br>
developed in order to circumvent this problem.<br>
Materials and Methods and Results<br>
Table 2 lists the compositions of Medium 4A-1, Medium 4B, Trace B and Trace D used<br>
in the formulations of Tables 3-7.<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
Note: Nucellin™ is manufactured by Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN, USA); H/P stock =<br>
0.036 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 1.08 mg/mL Putrescine»2HCl.<br>
The media formulation consists of 3 parts: I, II, III. Part I is the concentrated version of<br>
8X Medium 4 with the individual components of Medium 4B except folic acid due to the<br>
48<br>
concerns of the solubility of this vitamin. Part II is iron stock, Trace D and acidic<br>
cysteine, to avoid possible precipitation of iron if added in part I. Part III is folic acid<br>
stock. Part I is added 2% by volume daily starting on day 5 and parts II and III are added<br>
once on day 5 together with Part I.<br>
The final pH of the feed media was adjusted to 7.0 and osmolarity was about 1064<br>
mOsm. A 2% feed will result in a 2g/L glucose, a 2 mM Glutamine and a 14 mOsm<br>
osmolarity increase to the culture.<br>
2. 16X Medium 4.<br>
To reduce the increase in osmolarity, the feed media was changed from 20X Medium 4<br>
(2% by volume daily) to 16X Medium 4 (3% by volume daily). The media formulation<br>
for 16X Medium 4 is provided in Table 4.<br>

Note: Nucellin™ is manufactured by Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN, USA); H/P stock =<br>
0.036 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 1.08 mg/mL Putrescine»2HCl.<br>
In this modified 16X Medium 4, glucose was also eliminated to further reduce the<br>
osmolarity and give some flexibility of the glucose feed. Total osmolarity of the feed<br>
media is now 295 mOsm. ' '<br>
3. 16X Medium 4.<br>
Changes were made to the 16X Medium 4 formulation. Iron stock solution was added in<br>
the feed resulting in a 0.45 uM addition each feed. Additionally, glucose was added<br>
back to give a 1.5 g/L addition every feed. The media formulation for this modified 16X<br>
Medium 4 is provided in Table 5.<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
Note: Nucellin™ is manufactured by Eli Lilly (Indianapolis, IN, USA); H/P stock =<br>
0.036 mg/mL hydrocortisone, 1.08 mg/mL Putrescine'2HCl.<br>
4. 16X Medium 4.<br>
Here, the feed media (16X Medium 4) was made in combined media instead of 3<br>
separate feeds as in the last several batches. Tests were done to ensure that folic acid<br>
could be dissolved at the concentration required and that neither iron nor folic acid<br>
precipitated out of solution after storage at either 4°C or at room temperature for 6 days.<br>
The media formulation for the combined 16X Medium 4 is provided in Table 6.<br>
 [0001] Here, several changes were made to the feed media. Medium 4B<br>
powder was used instead of addition of each individual ingredient in Medium 4B.<br>
Medium 4B powder was mixed with glucose and dissolved separately under basic<br>
conditions by titrating the solution to pH 10.25. Additional asparagine and<br>
thiamine were added since the amino acid and vitamin analysis results showed<br>
these two components were exhausted by the end of fed-batch process. Use of<br>
12X Medium 4 further reduced the osmolarity increase when fed to the culture.<br>
The media formulation for 12X Medium 4 is provided in Table 7.<br>

The final osmolarity is 566 mOsm. A daily feed of 4% by volume gives an<br>
approximate osmolarity increase of 8.6, an increase in glucose of 2g/L and an increase<br>
in glutamine of 1.5 mM. The 12X Medium 4 media formulation is also known as<br>
Medium 5. Medium 5 is easy to make compared to 20X Medium 4 or 16X Medium 4,<br>
and stable over 10 days either at room temperature or at 4°C (data not'shown).<br>
Example 3: Glutamine Starvation Fed-batch Process for anti-GDF-8 Cell Culture<br>
CHO cells require glutamine in the starting media to survive. Traditionally, initial<br>
glutamine levels are high and glutamine is fed daily after day 5 until the end of the fedbatch<br>
process. Traditional fed-batch processes normally result in high lactate and<br>
ammonium levels in the cell cultures, which are known to have inhibitory effects on<br>
cell growth, cell density and recombinant protein expression. Fed-batch processes in<br>
which glucose is slowly added to the culture have been shown to lower lactate<br>
production and improve cell growth, cell density and recombinant protein expression.<br>
However, prior art methods for manipulation of glucose addition are not practical for<br>
large-scale manufacturing. Here, by utilizing culture media with lower starting levels<br>
of glutamine and eliminating glutamine from the feed, it is shown that lower levels of<br>
ammonium and lactate are produced, leading to increased cell viability. Additionally,<br>
in glutamine-starved cultures, recombinant protein expression is increased and final<br>
osmolarity is reduced.<br>

[0002] STRAINS AND MEDIA: anti-GDF-8 cells were cultured in a fedbatch<br>
mode in Medium 1 in 1 L Bioreactor.<br>
[0003] CULTURE CONDITIONS: Cells were grown for'twelve days in 1L<br>
Bioreactors. Temperature was shifted from 37°C to 31°C on either day 4 or day<br>
5 depending on the cell growth. Three fed-batch processes were tested: a normal<br>
(control) process, a no glutamine feed process and a glutamine starvation process.<br>
Pertinent details of these processes are listed in Table 8 and Table 9.<br>

SAMPLE ANALYSIS: Daily samples were taken from the cultures and were analyzed<br>
for cell density, cell viability, lactate, glutamine, and ammonium levels. Titer of<br>
expressed anti-GDF-8 antibody was also measured daily.<br>
Results and Conclusions<br>
Figure 3 shows the cell density of cultures grown in either no glutamine feed or<br>
control fed-batch conditions. In both cases, cell density was similar over the course of<br>
the experiment.<br>
Figure 4 shows percent cell viability in cultures grown in either no glutamine<br>
feed or control fed-batch conditions. The no glutamine feed culture showed a markedly 1 !<br>
higher cell viability toward the end of the experiment, beginning on day 6.<br>
Figure 5 shows ammonium levels in cultures grown in either no glutamine feed<br>
or control fed-batch conditions. The no glutamine feed culture showed a marked<br>
decrease in ammonium levels toward the end of the experiment, beginning on day 4.<br>
Figure 6 shows lactate levels in cultures grown in either no glutamine feed or<br>
control fed-batch conditions. Lactate levels were slightly lower in the no glutamine<br>
feed culture throughout the course of the experiment.<br>
Figure 7 shows anti-GDF-8 antibody titer in cultures grown in either no<br>
glutamine feed or control fed-batch conditions. Final anti-GDF-8 antibody titer was<br>
higher in the no glutamine feed culture.<br>
Figure 8 shows the cell density of cultures grown in either glutamine-starved or<br>
control fed-batch conditions. In both cases, cell density was similar over the course of<br>
the experiment.<br>
Figure 9 shows cell viability in cultures grown in either glutamine-starved or<br>
control fed-batch conditions. In both cases, cell viability was similar over the course of<br>
the experiment.<br>
Figure 10 shows ammonium levels in cultures grown in either glutamine-starved<br>
or control fed-batch conditions. The glutamine-starved culture showed a marked<br>
decrease in ammonium levels throughout the course of the experiment.<br>
Figure 11 shows lactate levels in cultures grown in either glutamine-starved or<br>
control fed-batch conditions. The glutamine-starved culture showed a marked decrease<br>
in lactate levels throughout towards the end of the experiment, beginning on day 4.<br>
Figure 12 shows anti-GDF-8 antibody titer in cultures grown in either glutaminestarved<br>
or control fed-batch conditions. Final anti-GDF-8 antibody titer was higher in the<br>
glutamine-starved culture.<br>
Collectively these results indicate that decreased glutamine levels are beneficial<br>
to cell cultures by reducing the amount of ammonium production, increasing cell<br>
viability and increasing titer of expressed anti-GDF-8 antibody. In addition, in the<br>
glutamine-starved cultures, low lactate levels were observed, possibly due to the<br>
decreased glucose consumption rate. Decreased ammonium and lactate levels also have<br>
the effect of reducing total osmolarity. Elevated osmolarity is also known to have<br>
inhibitory effects on cell growth and viability. Low initial glutamine levels together with<br>
the elimination of the glutamine feed also has the positive effect of reducing ammonium<br>
produced as a result of non-enzymatic glutamine degradation in stored media.<br>
Elimination of glutamine in the feed also simplifies the process of culturing anti-GDF-8<br>
cells. . ,<br>
Example 4. Iron dose response of anti-GDF-8 cells in Medium 1 and Medium 2.<br>
Medium 1 is much more concentrated in nutrients than Medium 2. The optimum iron<br>
levels for cell growth in Medium 1 were determined in order to avoid problems with iron<br>
deficiency during cell culture.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Anti-GDF-8 cells were cultured in dishes for one passage in either Medium 1 or Medium<br>
2. Iron concentrations of these media were manipulated by addition of different<br>
amounts of stock iron solution. Final cell densities were measured by CEDEX.<br>
Results and Conclusions<br>
Figure 13 shows the Fe dose response of anti-GDF-8 cells in Medium 1 and<br>
Medium 2 containing different iron concentrations. In Medium 2, the cell density was<br>
relatively constant for iron concentrations ranging from 3 \sM to 15 uM. In Medium 1,<br>
cell density increases with increasing iron concentration but reaches a maximum after<br>
approximately 5 uM. This difference could be due to the high nutrient content in<br>
Medium 1, which might reduce iron availability to the cells as a consequence of<br>
chelation of iron in the media. These results indicate that iron levels should be kept<br>
above 5 uM to avoid problems with iron deficiency in Medium 1.<br>
Example 5. Substitution of Glutamate for Glutamine in the Bioreactor Process.<br>
56<br>
Three experiments were performed to test the effects of substituting glutamate for<br>
glutamine in an anti-Lewis Y cell culture process.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
The experiments were performed in 10L bioreactors at pH 7.1, 30% dissolved oxygen,<br>
and a starting temperature of 37°C with a shift to 31°C on day 5. Sparge and headspace<br>
gasses were 88% of a 93% air/7% CC&gt;2 mix and 12% oxygen. The starting media in all<br>
experiments was Medium 1, which contains glutamine. Feed media and feed schedule<br>
including supplemental glucose and glutamine feeds are shown in Table 10. Columns<br>
labeled "Glutamate" were fed with modified Medium 5, containing no glutamine, but<br>
containing a molar concentration of glutamate equal to the molar glutamine<br>
concentration in standard Medium 5. Columns labeled glutamine were i fed with standard<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
Within each experiment, cell density is similar as shown in Figure 14. Cell densities are<br>
low in the Glutamine 2 and Glutamate 2 experiments due to a pH deviation to about 6.7<br>
on day 3 on the process. The drop in density between day 6 and 7 in the Glutamine 3<br>
and Glutamate 3 experiments is due to the 29% media feed on day 6.<br>
Figure 15 shows cell viability of the glutamate and glutamine fed cultures.<br>
Viabilities remained higher during the second half of the process in the bioreactors<br>
containing glutamate fed cultures.<br>
In Experiment 1, anti-Lewis Y liter is similar between the glutamate and glutamine<br>
fed cultures. Figure 16 shows that in Experiments 2 and 3, anti-Lewis Y titers are lower<br>
in the glutamine fed reactors. The lower anti-Lewis Y titer observed in these reactors<br>
could be due to the high levels of lactate produced, as shown in Figure 17.<br>
Bioreactors run with glutamate in the feed media have a lower ammonium<br>
concentration (Figure 18) and a lower osmolarity (Figure 19).<br>
The binding ELISA assay was used to test activity of samples from the Glutamine<br>
1 and Glutamate 1 experiments. The activities were similar: 110% of reference for the<br>
Glutamine 1 sample and 122% of reference for the Glutamate 1 sample (data not shown).<br>
The substitution of glutamate for glutamine in these experiments does not have a<br>
significant effect on cell density. However, cell viability is lower in the Bioreactors fed<br>
with glutamine. Ammonium, lactate and osmolarity are lower in the Bioreactors fed<br>
with glutamate compared to those fed with glutamine. On average, anti-Lewis Y titer is<br>
higher in the Bioreactors fed with glutamate and activity is essentially the same under<br>
both conditions.<br>
Example 6. Substitution of Glucose and Glutamine in the Anti-Lewis Y Cell Culture<br>
Process.<br>
The purpose of this experiment was to test the effects of substitution of glucose<br>
and glutamine with the feed media listed in Table 11 below in the culturing of anti-Lewis<br>
Y cells (see Bogheart et al., Antibody-targeted chemotherapy with the calicheamicin<br>

10:4538-49 (2004)). Cell density, cell viability, anti-Lewis Y liter and ammonium levels<br>
were measured.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
The experiment was performed in 250 ml shake flasks at a starting volume of 75<br>
ml. All shake flasks were seeded at 0.25 x 106 cells/ml in Medium 2. The flasks were<br>
incubated at 37°C in a 7% CO2 incubator for 14 days. On days 3 and 4, the flasks were<br>
fed with 5% by volume of Medium 6 feed medium. The composition of Medium 6 is<br>
listed in Table 11. On days 5-13 the flasks were fed with 5% by volume of one of the<br>
feed solutions listed in Table 12. Each condition was performed in duplicate. Samples<br>
were taken daily for cell counts by CEDEX and assays for ammonium, glucose, and<br>
lactate<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
Results and Conclusions<br>
The highest cell density was seen when glutamate or glycylglutamine was<br>
substituted for glutamine in the presence of either glucose or galactose in the feed media.<br>
Cell density was generally lower in the cultures fed with glucose/glutamine,<br>
galactose/glutamine, or glucose only (Figure 20). Final viability was highest in the<br>
cultures fed with glucose only, followed by the cultures fed with glucose/glutamate. The<br>
lowest viability was seen in the cultures fed with glutamine or asparagine combined with<br>
either glucose or galactose (Figure 21).<br>
Day 14 titer was highest in the glucose/glycylglutamine and the<br>
glucose/glutamate fed cultures at about 700 ug/ml. Titer was lowest in the<br>
galactose/glycylglutamine and the galactose/asparagine fed cultures at about 500 ug/ml.<br>
Titer in the glucose/glutamine control was about 570 ug/ml (Figure 22).<br>
The lowest ammonium levels were seen in the flasks fed with glucose/glutamate<br>
or glucose only. The flasks fed with galactose/glutamate, glucose/glutamine,<br>
glucose/glycylglutamine, and glucose/asparagine showed intermediate levels of<br>
ammonium. The flasks fed with galactose/asparagine, galactose/glycylglutamine, and<br>
galactose/glutamine had the highest levels of ammonium (Figure 23).<br>
Glucose levels remained above 1 g/L in all flasks fed with galactose until day 11.<br>
From day 11 through day 14, the glucose in these cultures was never completely<br>
depleted, remaining between 0.6 and 1 g/L, with no significant differences between the<br>
different cultures.<br>
Glucose levels increased in all flasks fed with glucose or glucose combined with<br>
another substrate until day 10. From day 10 through day 14 in these cultures, glucose<br>
levels remained fairly constant and similar to each other. On day 14 about 8.4 g/L<br>
glucose remained in the glucose/glutamate fed cultures and about 10.8g/L glucose<br>
remained in the cultures fed with glucose only.<br>
Lactate levels reached a high of about 2.4 g/L on day 5, when conditions were the<br>
same for all cells, and dropped to essentially zero in all cultures by day 14. Lactate<br>
levels were highest from day 10 through day 14 in the glucose/glutamine control, but<br>
were below 1 g/L during this time (data not shown). '<br>
All conditions tested in this experiment resulted in higher cell density than the<br>
control glucose/glutamine condition. All conditions tested except the<br>
galactose/asparagine condition resulted in higher final viability than either the<br>
glucose/glutamine control or the galactose/glutamine fed condition. Titer in the<br>
61<br>
glucose/glutamine control was about 570 ug/ml compared to a high of about 700 ug/ml<br>
in the glucose/glycylglutamine fed condition and the glucose/glutamate fed condition.<br>
Example 7. Evaluation of a Glutamine Starved Batch Process for the Production of<br>
anti-GDF-8.<br>
Typical fed-batch production methods require multiple feeds over the culture<br>
period. These feeds are designed to replace nutrients in the medium that may have been<br>
depleted by the cells or may have degraded during the batch. These feeds create<br>
complications when the process is scaled up to be used in larger reactors, such as the<br>
need for an impeller jump (see Figure 24). Furthermore, the feeds dilute the amount of<br>
anti-GDF-8 already secreted into the culture and therefore affect the harvest titer. The<br>
use of a batch process would allow inoculation of the bioreactor at full volume, instead<br>
of at a partial volume so as to accommodate the feeds, which would remove the necessity<br>
of an impeller jump and greatly reduce any dilution effect on productivity.<br>
Glutamine is one of the most important reasons that a fed-batch approach is used<br>
since it is not stable at 37 C and it had been thought that it needed to be replenished<br>
during a batch culture. However, results of Examples 2, 5, and 6, in which a glutamine<br>
starvation strategy was tested, showed a significant increase in productivity compared to<br>
a control reactor that was fed glutamine. This result was combined with the batch<br>
process to create a glutamine starvation batch process that was tested in this Example.<br>
aterials and Methods<br>
Anti-GDF-8 cells were grown in 1L Bioreactors for 12 days according to the<br>
following four growth conditions. Bioreactor parameters for all conditions were kept the<br>
same. Dissolved oxygen was maintained at no lower than 23% of air saturation by<br>
sparging with air and pH was maintained at 7.00 by the addition of a solution containing<br>
sodium bicarbonate at 0.58 M and sodium carbonate at 0.71 M. The temperature of all<br>
cultures was maintained at 37°C for the first four days of the batch. On the fourth day of<br>
the batch the temperature of all the bioreactors was lowered to 31°C and maintained at<br>
this point for the duration of the batch. The control and fed-batch cultures were fed with<br>
8%, 12%, and 8% total reactor volume of their respective feed media on days 5, 7, and<br>
10, respectively.<br>
1) Control.<br>
- Inoculation medium Medium 7 (see Table 13).<br>
62<br>
- Feed Medium 8, fed on days 5, 7, and 10 (see Table 13).<br>
- Feed 5 mM of glutamine on day 4.<br>
- Lower the temperature to 31 °C on day 4.<br>
2) Fed-batch glutamine starvation.<br>
- Inoculation medium Medium 7 with only 4 mM of glutamine (see Table 13).<br>
- Feed Medium 8 without glutamine, fed on days 5, 7, and 10 (see Table 13).<br>
- No glutamine feed on day 4.<br>
- Lower the temperature to 31 °C on day 4.<br>
3) Batch glutamine starvation.<br>
- Inoculation medium new batch medium with only 4 mM of glutamine<br>
(see Table 13).<br>
- No feed medium.<br>
- No glutamine feed.<br>
- Lower the temperature to 31 °C on day 4.<br>
- Add 5g/L of glucose on day 8.<br>
4) Batch glutamine starvation supplemented on day 8.<br>
- Inoculation medium new batch medium with only 4 mM of glutamine<br>
(see Table 13). ' '<br>
- No feed medium.<br>
- No glutamine feed.<br>
- Lower the temperature to 31 °C on day 4.<br>
- Add 4g of glucose, 375 mg of Asparagine, 3 mL of 1 mM FeSO4 stock,<br>
3.33 mL of 5 g/L Nucellin™ stock, 2.57 mL of 36 mg/L<br>
Hydrocortisone and 1.0 g/L Putrescine stock solution, 0.23 mL of 50<br>
mg/L Sodium Selenite stock, and 13.1 mg of Thiamine on day 8.<br>

Results and Conclusions<br>
Cell growth for the first 4 days was similar for the control and batch processes,<br>
while the glutamine starved fed-batch process had a slightly lower cell density and<br>
remained a little lower for the rest of the batch. Both batch processes maintained higher<br>
cell densities for the duration of the batch, probably due to the lack of any significant<br>
dilution (see Figure 25). Viabilities of all the cultures were the same up to day 8.<br>
However, it is interesting to note that on day 11, the viability of the batch process that<br>
was not supplemented was lower than the other three bioreactors and ended up<br>
significantly lower by the final day. This suggests that the batch medium could still be<br>
optimized since the supplemented batch process had a viability that was the same as the<br>
fed-batch bioreactors (see Figure 26).<br>
Cells cultured in either glutamine starved batch process or in the glutamine<br>
starved fed-batch process outperformed the same cells cultured in the control fed-batch<br>
process in productivity. The control fed-batch process had a harvest day titer of 685<br>
ug/mL, as expected, while the glutamine starved fed-batch process had a harvest titer of<br>
1080 jig/mL, about 58% higher than the control. This is similar to results seen<br>
previously. The glutamine starved non-supplemented batch process had a harvest day<br>
titer of 960 ug/mL, 40% higher than the control, similar to the glutamine starved fedbatch<br>
process, while the supplemented glutamine starved batch process had the highest<br>
titer at 1296 ug/mL. This is an 89% increase over the control (see Figure 27).<br>
When the inhibitor levels for the four conditions were analyzed the results<br>
showed that the lactate and ammonia levels for all three glutamine starved processes<br>
were significantly lower than the control. In fact, after day 4, those three conditions<br>
either stopped producing or started consuming lactate while the control continued to<br>
produce lactate throughout the batch (see Figure 28). As expected, the ammonia levels<br>
were much lower in the glutamine starved processes and declined after day 4, while the<br>
control continued to produce ammonia (see Figure 29).<br>
In this Example, combining a batch process with a glutamine starvation strategy<br>
resulted in a 40% improvement in productivity over the control fed-batch process for<br>
anti-GDF-8 cells. The data also suggest that with some optimization of the batch<br>
medium, an almost 2-fold improvement in productivity can be attained. This<br>
improvement in productivity can be attributed to two factors. First, glutamine starvation<br>
increases productivity either directly or by keeping ammonia and lactate levels very low.<br>
Second, because of the absence of feeds, the titer is not diluted during the batch.<br>
66<br>
Increased productivity together with the ease of operation inherent in a batch process<br>
makes this an attractive option for producing recombinant polypeptides.<br>
Example 8. Effects of Glutamine and Asparagine concentrations in batch media on<br>
anti-GDF-8 cell culture process.<br>
In Examples 2, 5 and 6, it was demonstrated that glutamine starvation conferred benefits<br>
on fed-batch cultures in two cell lines, including increased cell growth, cell viability and<br>
titer as well as decreased production of lactate and ammonium. Asparagine also seems<br>
to play a role in batch media.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Anti-GDF-8 cells were cultured for twelve days in 1L Bioreactors in modified<br>
Medium 9 with differing concentrations of glutamine and asparagine. Base Medium 9<br>
composition is listed in Table 14. Experimental variations on this base composition are<br>
listed in Table 15. The cultures were incubated at 37°C for the first 5 days with the<br>
exception of Reactor 4, whose temperature was 30°C for the first day due to temperature<br>
control problems. The cultures were shifted to 31°C on day 6. On day 7, the cultures<br>
were fed once with 5% by volume Medium 5 lacking glutamine. Cultures were<br>
measured daily for cell density, anti-GDF-8 titer, lactate and ammonium levels.<br>

Results and Conclusions • i<br>
Figures 30, 31, 32 and 33 show the cell growth of anti-GDF-8 cells, anti-GDF-8<br>
titer, lactate levels and ammonium levels, respectively, throughout the course of the<br>
experiments under the various experimental conditions.<br>
Under all experimental conditions, 4 mM glutamine is better than 1 mM<br>
glutamine at all the Asparagine levels tested. At comparable glutamine levels, 12 mM<br>
and 20 mM asparagine conditions are better than 8 mM asparagine conditions.<br>
Decreased lactate and NH» levels were observed at the end of the culture for all<br>
conditions tested.<br>
Example 9. Effects of Glutamine and Asparagine concentrations in batch media on<br>
anti-GDF-8 cell culture process.<br>
In Example 8, it was demonstrated that Medium 9 containing an initial<br>
concentration of 4 mM glutamine performs better than media containing 1 mM<br>
glutamine, regardless of asparagine levels. This example demonstrates the effect of<br>
media containing 13 mM glutamine levels and various asparagine levels.<br>

Anti-GDF-8 cells were cultured for twelve days in 1L Bioreactors in modified<br>

16. The cultures were incubated at 37°C for the first 3 days. The cultures were then<br>
shifted to 31°C on day 4. On day 7, the cultures were fed once with 5% by volume<br>
Medium 5 lacking glutamine. Cultures were measured periodically for cell density, cell<br>
viability, lactate, ammonium levels and glutamine levels, anti-GDF-8 titer, and<br>
osmolarity.<br>

Figures 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39 and 40 show the cell growth of anti-GDF-8 cells,<br>
percent viability of anti-GDF-8 cells, lactate levels, ammonium levels, glutamine levels,<br>
anti-GDF-8 titer, and osmolarity, respectively, throughout the course of the experiments<br>
under the various experimental conditions.<br>
Among all the conditions tested, only Medium 9 containing 13 mM glutamine<br>
and 20 mM asparagine showed significant adverse effects on cell growth and titer.<br>
Glutamine is exhausted in all the cultures at approximately the same time, regardless of<br>
whether the culture begins with 4 mM or 13 mM glutamine. The highest anti-GDF-8<br>
titer is obtained in cultures that contain 13 mM glutamine and 12 mM asparagine. All<br>
culture conditions exhibit decreased lactate and ammonium levels near the end of the<br>
culture. Ammonium levels were highest in the culture containing 13 mM glutamine and<br>
20 mM asparagine.<br>
Example 10. The effect of asparagine and cysteine levels on the observed decrease<br>
in lactate and ammonium levels in anti-GDF-8 cells cultured in Medium 9.<br>
In Examples 2, 5 and 6, it was found that cultures grown under glutamine<br>
starvation conditions exhibit decreased lactate and ammonium levels at the end of the<br>
culture process. However, cultures grown in Medium 9 under non-glutamine starvation<br>
conditions still exhibit decreased lactate and ammonium levels at the end of the culture<br>
process. This effect was not observed in other media such as Medium 1, where<br>
glutamine starvation appears necessary for the decreased levels of lactate and<br>
ammonium. Medium 9 and Medium 1 differ in the levels of asparagine (20 mM in<br>
Medium 9 versus 11 mM total in Medium 1 plus feed) and acidic cystine (1.5 mM in<br>
Medium 9 versus 0.95 mM in Medium 1). This example tests whether these two<br>
components were responsible for the observed decrease in the lactate and ammonium<br>
levels at the end of the culture.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Anti-GDF-8 cells were cultured in 1L BioReactors for 12 days. Cells were<br>
initially cultured at 37°C and were shifted to 31°C on day 4 or day 5 at 8-10xl06/ml.<br>
Table 17 lists the various experimental conditions tested. Samples were taken daily and<br>
saved for titer analysis by Protein A HPLC.<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
Anti-GDF-8 cells grown in Medium 9 exhibited decreased lactate and ammonium<br>
levels at the end of the culture process, regardless of whether the cultures were started<br>
with 4 mM or 13 mM glutamine (see Figures 42 and 43). In contrast, Medium 1 only<br>
exhibited decreased lactate and ammonium levels at the end of the culture process when<br>
the cultures were started with 4 mM glutamine (see Figures 42 and 43). Addition of<br>
extra asparagine and cystine to Medium 1 containing 13 mM glutamine did not result in<br>
decreased lactate and ammonium levels at the end of the culture process (see Figures 42<br>
and 43).<br>
Cultures that exhibited decreased lactate and ammonium levels at the end of the<br>
culture process (Medium 1 with 4 mM glutamine, Medium 9 with 4 mM glutamine and<br>
Medium 9 with 13 mM glutamine) were also observed to have lower total osmolarity at<br>
the end of the culture process (see Figure 47).<br>
Medium 9 with 4 mM glutamine exhibited the highest anti-GDF-8 titer, followed<br>
by Medium 9 with 13 mM glutamine fed on day 4 (see Figure 46). Taking the effect of<br>
dilution of the feed into account, Medium 9 containing 4 mM glutamine had equivalent<br>
anti-GDF-8 titer to Medium 9 containing 13 mM glutamine.<br>
Example 11. The effect of amino acid and vitamin levels on the observed decrease<br>
in lactate and ammonium levels in anti-GDF-8 cells cultured in Medium 9.<br>
Example 10 tested whether difference in the asparagine and cysteine levels<br>
between Medium 1 and Medium 9 were responsible for the observed decrease in lactate<br>
and ammonium levels at the end of the culture process in Medium 9 that was not starved<br>
for glutamine. It was determined that these factors were not responsible for the observed<br>
decrease. Medium 1 and Medium 9 also differ in their amino acid and vitamin<br>
concentrations. This example tests whether differences in amino acids and vitamin<br>
concentrations between these two media are responsible for the observed decrease.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Anti-GDF-8 cells were cultured in 1L BioReactors for 12 days. Cells were<br>
initially cultured at 37°C and were shifted to 31°C on day 4 at 8-10xl06/ml. Table 18<br>
lists the various experimental conditions tested. Amino acids, vitamins, hydrocortisone<br>
and putrescine, trace elements E (composition listed in Table 19) and iron were added to<br>
the various experimental Medium 1 conditions such that the levels of these components<br>
were equal to the levels in Medium 9. Samples were taken daily and saved for titer<br>
analysis by Protein A HPLC.<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
All conditions tested exhibited decreased lactate and ammonium levels at the end<br>
of the culture process except for Medium 1 containing added amino acids, indicating that<br>
increased amino acid levels in Medium 9 compared to Medium 1 are probably not<br>
responsible for the decreases in lactate and ammonium levels (see Figures 49 and 50).<br>
However, Medium 1 containing added vitamins, hydrocortisone and putrescine, trace<br>
elements E and iron exhibited lower lactate and ammonium levels at the end of the<br>
to Medium 1 containing added amino acids (see Figures 49<br>
and 50). This indicates that these components may be responsible for the observed<br>
decreases in Medium 9.<br>
Cultures grown in Medium 1 containing added vitamins, hydrocortisone and<br>
putrescine, trace elements E and iron exhibited the lowest levels of ammonium<br>
throughout the experiment due to the lower total amounts of asparagine and glutamine in<br>
the starting media (see Figure 50).<br>
Example 12. The effect of vitamin, trace elements £ and iron levels on the observed<br>
decrease in lactate and ammonium levels in anti-GDF-8 cells cultured in Medium 9.<br>
In Example 11, it was determined that the increased levels of vitamins,<br>
hydrocortisone and putrescine, trace elements E and iron in Medium 9 relative to<br>
Medium 1 might be responsible for the decrease in lactate and ammonium levels<br>
observed at the end of the culture process. Here, these components were tested<br>
individually and in combination to determine which, if any, were responsible for the<br>
observed decrease. • i<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Anti-GDF-8 cells were cultured in 1L BioReactors for 12 days. Cells were<br>
initially cultured at 37°C and were shifted to 31°C on day 4 at 8-10xl06cells/ml, with the<br>
exception of Medium 1 containing trace E elements, which were shifted on day 4 at<br>
about 6x106 cells/ml. Table 20 lists the various experimental conditions tested.<br>
Hydrocortisone and putrescine were added to all Medium 1 conditions such that the<br>
levels of these components were equal to the levels in Medium 9. Vitamins, Trace<br>
elements E (composition listed in Table 19) and iron were added to the various<br>
experimental Medium 1 conditions such that the levels of these components were equal<br>
to the levels in Medium 9. Samples were taken daily and saved for titer analysis by<br>
Protein A HPLC.<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
3 exhibited the lowest cell<br>
density and anti-GDF-8 titer (see Figures 57 and 58). The fact that Medium 9 produces<br>
superior results than Medium 1 indicates that it is better to provide the media components<br>
in the starting media rather than supplying them through multiple feeds. Additionally,<br>
the fact that both Medium 1 and Medium 9 perform better than Medium 3 indicates that<br>
providing amino acids in concentrations greater than about 70 mM provide superior<br>
results than providing amino acids in concentrations less than about 70 mM. Finally,<br>
providing amino acids in concentrations greater than about 70 mM in the starting media<br>
results in the highest cell densities and titers (compare Medium 9 vs. Medium 1).<br>
Example 14. Statistical analysis of optimum total glutamine and asparagine levels<br>
in Medium 9 for anti-GDF-8 cell culture in Bioreactors.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
Anti-GDF-8 cells were grown in 1L Bioreactors and were shifted from 37°C to<br>
31°C on the days indicated in Table 23. Final titers were subjected to a T-test in order to<br>
determine the optimum level of glutamine alone and the optimum level of total combined<br>
glutamine and asparagine. Table 23 summarizes some relevant experimental conditions<br>
and end results for anti-GDF-8 cells grown in Medium 9.<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
Figure 59 shows extrapolated anti-GDF-8 titers for various levels of glutamine<br>
alone and total combined glutamine and asparagine. Table 24 shows the results of a Ttest<br>
comparing normalized liter of glutamine levels between 2 and 15 mM and glutamine<br>
levels outside this range. Table 25 shows the results of a T-test comparing normalized<br>
liter of combined glutamine and asparagine levels between 16 and 36 mM and combined<br>
glutamine and asparagine levels oulside Ihis range.<br>
Bolh T-lesl resulls indicated significanl differences in anti-GDF-8 titers between<br>
Ihe Iwo groups lhal were compared. Cullures grown in Medium 9 conlaining between 2<br>
and 15 mM glulamine and between 16 and 36 mM combined glulamine and asparagine<br>
exhibited higher anli-GDF-8 liters lhan cullures grown in media with glulamine and<br>
combined glulamine and asparagine levels lhal fell oulside Ihese ranges. In all<br>
experimenls, asparagine levels were greater lhan 9 mM.<br>

Example 15. Effects of Medium on Cell Culture.<br>
This example investigated the performance of three cell culture medium<br>
variations at intermediate scale utilizing high density seed cultures. All of the media<br>
tested were expected to show improvements over the Phase 1 medium (Medium 10 fed<br>
with Medium 11 feed medium), based on small scale bioreactor data.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
CHO cells expressing a humanized anti-Abeta peptide IgGl monoclonal antibody<br>
("anti-ABeta cells") were tested in various media, as shown in Table 26 (see Basi et al.,<br>
Humanized Antibodies that Recognize Beta Amyloid Peptide, WO02/46237). The pH<br>
low end set point was 7.0 controlled with 0.95M Na2CO3 + 0.05M.foCO3, except for<br>
Phase 1, which was controlled with a solution containing sodium bicarbonate at 0.58 M<br>
and sodium carbonate at 0.71 M. Dissolved oxygen was controlled at 30% by sparging<br>
on demand with air, agitation was at 60 rpm, and the feed medium was Medium 5 (with<br>
or without glutamine, as noted). All cultures were grown at 130L scale except for<br>
03P49B501, which was grown at 500L scale. In brief, Medium 1 is enriched in all<br>
nutrients, without consideration for relative uptake rates, while Medium 12 was balanced<br>
by removing apparently unnecessary nutrients from the indiscriminately enriched<br>
version. The compositions of Mediums 10, 11 and 12 are listed in Table 27.<br>
(Table Remove) <br>
Results and Conclusions<br>
Media changes led to steady improvement through the course of these<br>
experiments. In terms of cell growth, viability, reduced lactate levels, reduced<br>
ammonium levels, and titer, reduced glutamine levels were better than elevated ones (see<br>
Figures 60-64) and balanced (batch) medium was better than rich medium (Medium 1,<br>
see Figures 60-64). Cultures started from high density inoculum exhibited higher final<br>
titer than did cultures started from lower density inoculums (see Figure 64).<br>
Unlike what was observed in small scale bioreactors, the first medium (Medium 1<br>
with high Gin) resulted in lower liters than did the original process (see Figure 64).<br>
There also was no shift to lactate uptake after the temperature change (see Figure 62).<br>
This suggests that there may be some scale sensitivity with this medium. This<br>
conclusion is supported by small-scale (2L) parallel runs that were done along with these<br>
intermediate scale experiments (data not shown). The later medium formulations<br>
containing less glutamine were not sensitive to scale, at least in these experiments (see<br>
Figures 60-65). The duplicated processes (Batches 2 and 3 and Batches 5 and 6) show<br>
very good run-to-run reproducibility (see Figures 60-65), increasing the confidence in all<br>
of the data gathered in this campaign.<br>
Example 16. Production of TNFR-Ig using Medium 9.<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
CHO cells expressing a dimeric fusion protein consisting of the extracellular<br>
ligand-binding portion of the human 75 kilodalton (p75) tumor necrosis factor receptor<br>
(TNFR) linked to the Fc portion of IgGl ("TNFR-Ig cells") were seeded at high density<br>
from a perfusion bioreactor and diluted to 3xl06 viable cells/ml in Medium 9 for the<br>
production bioreactor step.<br>
Results and Conclusions<br>
Figures 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71 and 72 show cell growth, cell viability, residual<br>
glucose, glutamine levels, lactate concentration, ammonium concentration, and relative<br>
product titer, respectively. Under the range of minor modifications to the process, all<br>
conditions yielded good cell growth, high cellular viability, and high overall final titer.<br>
For all the conditions of this experiment, the metabolic inhibitory byproduct<br>
lactate was either consumed, or the concentration plateaued, suggesting that lactate<br>
production was arrested. Similarly, for the inhibitory metabolite ammonium, levels rose<br>
initially, but at some time after the temperature shift the ammonium started to be<br>
consumed by the cells. In this Example, the TNFR-Ig cell cultures were subjected to the<br>
chemical inductants sodium butyrate, and HMBA.<br>
Example 17. Comparison of Large and Small-scale Culture Conditions<br>
Materials and Methods<br>
To determine whether the size of the culture affected relevant culture characteristics,<br>
anti-GDF-8 cells were grown in either small-scale 1 liter bioreactors or large-scale 6000<br>
liter bioreactors. Cells were grown at 37°C and shifted to 31°C on day 4.<br>
Results and Conclusions<br>
As can be seen in Figures 73, 74, 75 and 76 (which show cell density, liter,<br>
lactate levels and ammonium levels, respectively), there were no relevant differences<br>
between the 6000 liter large-scale and 1 liter small-scale cultures for these<br>
characteristics. Both lactate and ammonium levels began to decrease after the<br>
temperature shift on day 4. This example demonstrates that the size of the culture does<br>
not affect cell density, cell viability, lactate levels and ammonium levels when the<br>
cultures are subjected to the same growth conditions.<br><br><br>
