COMPLETE SPECIFICATION <br><br><br>
[ SECTION 10]<br><br><br>
A TUNABLE OPTICAL FILTER<br>
Department of Atomic Energy ,a department of the Govt of India having its office at Anushakthi Bhavan , Chathrapathy Shivaji Maharaj Marg, Mumbai, 400001,<br>
Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes and<br>
ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in<br>
which is to be performed<br>
1<br><br><br>
The invention disclosed in this application relates to a tunable optical filter. The tunable optical filter of the present invention is useful for selecting different bands of wave lengths from a white light, without the necessity for changing the optical element. Accordingly the filter of the present invention is also useful for obtaining different colors, which will find applications in industries such as Optical, Opto-electronics, Entertainment, Laser, Spectral radiometry, Color separation etc.<br>
Optical filters are used to select wavelengths (colors) of light. A filter works by excluding all but a limited set of wavelengths. An optical filter is specified by a wavelength number in nanometers. There are three general types of filters, long pass, short pass and band pass. The wavelengths that are allowed through a filter are called the pass band.<br>
Long pass band filters let all the wavelengths longer than the wavelength number through. These types of filters are used as barrier filters in fluorescence. They will let the fluorescent emitted light through and not the exciter light.<br>
Short pass band filters let light that is lower in wavelength through. Short pass band filters are sometimes used as exciter filters for fluorescence. A filter can transmit or reflect a specified range of wavelengths. Such a filter designed for spectroscopy is called a spectroscopic filter.<br>
Bandpass filters transmit light only within a defined spectral band ranging from less than one to many nanometers wide. They are used in a great variety of applications including spectral photometry, medical diagnostics, chemical analysis, colorimetry, and astronomy. When used in spectral photometry, bandpass filters are preferred over monochromators because of their higher transmission and better signal-to-noise ratio. The wavelength number is referred to as the center wavelength of a pass band filter. The center wavelength is the wavelength that allows the most light through within the range of wavelengths that will be passed through. Frequently, this will be the center wavelength of the filter. A pass band filter is rated by center wavelength and the pass band or width. The pass band can be 'quite'narrow and can be uneven., An uneven pass band would have more width on one side than the other.<br>
2 <br>
An interference filter is usually a pass band filter. It is specified by the center wavelength and the width. Manufacturers of interference filters provide plots of the intensity versus wavelength. This plot is the best way to understand the characteristics of a band pass filter. Interference filters use very thin glass and coatings of dielectric material such as SiO2, TiO2. ZrO2, TaO2, ZnS, MgF2, Al etc or their combinations to set up constructive and destructive interference in the filter. This interference creates the filter effect.<br>
Optical filters have been made by sputtering or by other methods of depositing materials of differing refractive index onto a transparent substrate. Such structures work well for low-power light application; however, for high-power illumination the deposited films peel-off or crack. Such a structure is found in U.S. Pat. No. 3,962,062 in which the films are deposited by sputtering. Electrically insulated integrated circuits (U.S. Pat. No. 3,976,511) have been formed by bombarding the surface of a substrate by ions and then heating the resultant bombarded surface sufficiently to react the ions with the substrate. The structure is further formed by depositing a layer onto the ion-bombarded structure and then forming desired patterns of electrically insulating layers thereon. U.S. Pat. No. 3,976,512 also illustrates ion bombardment in forming integrated circuits.<br>
FIG. 1 of the drawing accompanying this specification illustrates a high-resistivity silicon substrate *C' with one layer 4B' of nitrogen ions implanted therein a short distance from and parallel with the upper surface of the substrate. An ion accelerator is used to accelerate nitrogen ions 'A' which are uniformly incident on the surface of the silicon substrate, fn the buried implanted layer, a substrate temperature of about 700.degree. C. efficiently promotes the formation of the second-phase material (ion layer), silicon nitride, whose refractive index is 2.0. Thus silicon, with an index of refraction of 3.43, has a layer of silicon nitride with an index of refraction of 2.0 buried beneath the surface. The large difference in the index of refraction of the main body and the ion-implanted layer will cause light to be multiply reflected between the Sis N4 layer and the upper surface of the substrate. These multiple reflections lead to interference maxima and minima in the transmitted light as a function of wavelength.<br>
3 <br>
Another type of filter which is currently used is of the same type as explained above with multiplayer coating, which are being used in high power laser devices. A narrow-band<br>
interference filter   comprises of alternating reflective layers arranged in a series in the form of<br><br>
layers on a substrate (S) where the H layers have a high index of refraction and the L layers have a low index of refraction and the same optical thickness as the H layers is disclosed in a US patent No.4 009 453. Such filter is specifically useful for applications' involving lasers with high output power. The schematic of the multilayered filter is shown in figure 2. Here, the metal layers M are interposed in each alternating reflective layer system, so that one obtains the layer sequence 1 of (SHL HML HMLL MHL MHL HA), m the above example, S is the glass substrate with an index of refraction 1.5 and the layer H is ZnS and the layer L is MgF2 and the metal layer is Al.<br>
Color imaging systems benefit from the use of precision optical filters which control the spectral properties of light and color separation to exacting tolerances. In addition, system performance improves with the elimination of wavelengths outside the visible spectrum. Image capture is enhanced when the prime colors of light are precisely separated or trimmed before reaching the detector. Image reproduction, where colors are recombined, also benefits from the use of precision filters. The result is that image quality improves when a system's optics deliver precise color separation, high color signal-to-noise, and a wide dynamic range.<br>
Color imaging and measurement systems utilize color separation filters as well as prisms to differentiate the prime color wavelengths. Image capture systems divide light into red, green, and blue before reaching the detector. Image delivery systems recombine the red, green, and blue to form an image. In either case, system performance can be enhanced by carefully controlling the wavelengths and the areas of overlap. Systems, which use prisms to control the spectrum, can have enhanced performance using color separation filters.<br>
The above described presently available pass band or color optical filters are useful only for selecting a given central wavelength. If different wavelengths have-to be selected, different<br>
+.	-   -<br>
filters have.to be used for each desired central wavelength In other words such filters have no<br><br>
4 <br>
tunability option. Such filters are, therefore, not only cumbersome to use but also expensive because of the requirement of special high cost coatings such as those mentioned earlier.<br>
In spectroscopic and interferometric experiments involving different wavelengths of light, we need to use different types of interference filters to eliminate stray light entering the detector head. In those experiments, we need to replace the filters, whenever the wavelength of the light source is changed, e.g.: when we use He-Ne laser instead of Ar-ion laser (or when we change the color from red to green). This is often cumbersome, especially when the wavelength is changed continuously with a tunable type of laser. In order to avoid the problems associated with the necessity to change the filters, we have undertaken this project to develop a tunable type of optical filter.<br>
The main objective of the present invention; therefore, is to provide a tunable optical filter useful for obtaining of different wave lengths of light from a white light source, without the necessity for changing the optical element.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a tunable optical filter which is useful for selecting the wavelengths in the ultraviolet, visible and infrared (IR) regions.<br>
Yet, another objective of the present invention is to provide a tunable optical filter in which it is not required to change the optical element for choosing different wavelengths.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a tunable optical filter in which the desired band and central wavelength can be selected electronically, without changing the filters.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to provide a tunable optical filter in which the spectral distribution can be easily controlled by adjusting the pofydispersity of the emulsion used<br><br>
5 <br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide a tunable optical filter in which the intensity of the transmitted light can be controlled by changing the concentration of the<br>
emulsion used.<br><br>
Further objective of the present invention is to provide a tunable optical filter which is simple to operate and less expensive as compared to existing filters<br>
The invention has been developed based on the fact that the magnitude of the magnetic dipole moment of a magnetic emulsion, increases with the strength of the applied magnetic field until saturation is reached. This leads to chaining of the droplets. At iow concentration, one droplet thick chains are well separated and oriented along the field direction. Due to the presence of the one-dimensional ordered structure, Bragg reflection or scattering takes place from the emulsion. Here, the Bragg reflected wavelength corresponds to the spacing between the droplets.<br>
The condition for forming a linear chain is that the repulsive force between the droplets must exactly balance the attractive force between the droplets induced by the applied magnetic field. The dominant force in a field induced droplet chain is the dipole- dipole attraction. The Van der walls contribution also becomes significant at short distances. For perfectly aligned particles with a separation d' the first order Bragg condition leads to 2d = λ0/n. Where "n" is the refractive index of the suspending medium (n=1.33 for water) and λo is the wavelength of the light Bragg scattered at an angle of 180 degrees. The peak position moves toward smaller wavelength as the field is increased. The magnitude of the induced dipole can be controlled by the applied field.<br>
We explored the above property of controlling the spacing between the monodispersed emulsion droplets for developing the optical filter of the present invention where the pass band of wavelength can be chosen by choosing the appropriate magnetic filed. Using an appropriate emulsion of given diameter, the desired band can be selected by applying a given magnetic field.<br>
6 <br>
Accordingly we employed magnetic emulsions of magnetic material such as γ-Fe2O3, magnetite and combinations thereof, in a carrier medium of octane, stabilized with an inner surfactant and is emulsified with water in the presence of an ionic(cationic or anionic) or nortcomc surfactant with particles of suitable sizes and concentrations, sandwiched between two optical quality transparent plates ( e.g: glass, quarts, mylar etc.) which is hereinafter referred to as ferrofluid. The ferrofluid is sandwitched between the two transparent plates thereby forming a cell which is placed inside a non-magnetic casing (eg:AI), the cell is placed inside a compact solenoid, which is connected to a current source. The magnetic field is varied by changing the current. The reflected light from the ferrofluid cell is measured as a function of applied field strength by employing a spectrograph. As the ferrofluid droplets are super paramagnetic in nature, an applied magnetic field induces a magnetic dipole in each drop, causing them to form chains. Without external field, these droplets have no permanent magnetic moments because of the random orientation of the magnetic grains within the droplets, due to thermal motion. An external magnetic field orients these magnetic grains slightly toward the field direction, which results in a dipole moment in each droplet.<br>
In order to study the characteristic features of the new tunable optical filter, the filter is illuminated by a white light source and the reflected light from the filter assembly is sent through an optical fiber. The out put from the fiber assembly is finally entered inside a monochromator equipped with a diode array. The diode array output is processed by a computer by means of an interface card, which gives the reflected/transmitted light intensity as a function of wavelength.<br>
The tunable pass band optical filter useful for selecting different wavelengths of light of the present invention is shown in Fig 3. The magnetic emulsion (1) is sandwiched between two optical quality transparent plates (2) thereby forming a cell with is placed inside a compact solenoid (3). The spacing between the transparent glass plates is controlled by a mylar washer (4) of thickness 200 microns. The leads of the solenoid which is connected to a socket (5 )and is subsequently connected to a current source (6).<br>
According to the present invention there is provided a tunable pass band optical filter useful for selecting.different bands of wavelengths in the UV, Visible and 1R region without the<br>
7 <br>
necessity for changing the optical element, which comprises of a ferrofluid-based emulsion sandwiched between two transparent optical sheets, the thickness of the gap between the transparent optical sheets being at least 100 microns thereby forming a cell , the cell being placed inside a solenoid which is provided with a socket for connecting to a variable direct current source so as to facilitate changing the magnetic field of the cell<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the optical transparent sheets used may be selected from glass, quarts, mylar and the like. The magnetic material used may be selected from magnetic material such as iron, nickel, cobalt, γ-Fe2O3 magnetite and combinations' thereof and the like The carrier fluid in which the magnetic grains are dispersed may be n-octane, cyclohexane, n-dodecane, n-tetradecane, n-hexadecane, n-octadecane, or kerosene and the like.. The magnetic material may also be stabilized using an inner surfactant such as oleic acid, linoleic acid, olive oil and the like. The ferro magnetic material may also be emulsified with water and an ionic or nonionic surfactant with particles of suitable sizes and concentrations.<br>
The ferro magnetic material may also be emulsified with oil and an ionic or nonionic surfactant with particles of suitable sizes and concentrations.

TRe emufsion may 6e staoil'ized" tor ennancihg tne nfe time by incorporating a macromolecule, which may be a non-ionic, cationic or anfonic polymer or a macromolecule which may be a di-block or tri-block polymer or a macromo|ecule-surfactant mixture.<br>
The emulsion droplets employed may be a direct, inverted and multiple emulsion which are very well known in the field. The magnetic suspension, which may be a solid-liquid dispersion, solid-air dispersion or liquid-air dispersion.<br>
The thickness of the gap between the plates/sheets can be adjusted by employing spacers. For a given current, the spacing between the droplets is fixed in such a manner that a given band of light with a central wavelength of X (-2d/n) would be reflected. The central wavelength can be continuously tunable by changing the current, employing a polymer stabilized ferrofluid emulsion, the central wavelength can be varied up to 300 In order order to achieve tunability in the lower wavelength region, emulsions with smaller droplets are suitable. Similarly, for longer wavelength region, droplets of larger sizes are to be employed.<br>
In order, to calibrate the   tunable filter assembly, we have filled the cell assembly with ferrofluid.of a given droplet diameter (first column in the table 1). The ferrofluid used in the above experiment was made of Y-Fe2O.3 stabilized with an inner surfactant of oleic acid and<br>
9<br><br>
dispersed in a carrier medium of octane. The our surfactant was sodium dodecyl sulphate. The emulsion was subsequently stabilized with polyvinyl alcohol of molecular weight 1555 000 at a concentration of 0.5%. The filter assembly is kept inside the solenoid assembly, where the magnetic field can be varied from 0 to 200 gauss. By varying the magnetic field strength from<br>
0 to 200 Gauss, we have measured the corresponding Bragg peak central wavelength. The<br>
minimum and maximum value for different droplet radius is then estimated. Table 1 given<br>
below shows the approximate values of minimum and maximum values of central wavelength<br>
obtained for emulsions with different droplet radii ( where h = d - 2a).  Here the approximate<br>
,	L<br>
inter droplet spacing varies from lOOnm (minimum field) to close contact (maximum field).<br><br>
From the Tablel, it is clear that 4 different filters made of emulsion droplets of 100, 200, 300<br>
and 400 nm would be capable of covering a wide tunable wavelength range of 266 to 1330<br>
nm.<br>
