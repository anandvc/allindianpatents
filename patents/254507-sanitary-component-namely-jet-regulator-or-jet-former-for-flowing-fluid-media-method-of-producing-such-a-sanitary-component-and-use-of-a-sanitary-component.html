				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates to a sanitary component, namely a stream regulator or stream former for flowing fluid media, consisting of property-defining components in a sandwich-like arrangement in the direction of flow, a method of manufacturing such a sanitary component, as well as the use of such sanitary components, namely stream regulators or stream formers.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION AND PRIOR ART:<br>
Stream regulators or stream formers marketed by the Neoperl GmbH company under the brand names "Neoperl®" and "Perlator®" have been part of the prior art for years.<br>
At the same time, due to different standards, e.g. the European EN 246 standard or the US ASME A112.18.1M standard, there needs to be a number of different products available reflecting different flow rates or different flow rate restrictions. Also, different stream patterns are sought such as, on the one hand, those mixed with air as so-called bubbly flows and, on the other, laminar, crystal-clear flows of fluid media, while it is just as desirous to have control over the noise emissions occurring in outflowing streams. The above requirements further increase the number of different products which actually serve one and the same purpose.<br>
The most essential components for stream regulators or stream formers for flowing fluid media comprise means arranged in sandwich-like manner in the direction of flow; i.e., customarily a circular screen attachment, a circular diffuser plate assembly as well as a substantially cylindrical shell body having segments with stream-forming openings extending across its cross-sectional surface which can be configured in one piece with the shell and/or as insert plates.<br>
The screen attachments or filter screens, stream regulators, flow rate regulators, flow restrictors and/or check valves upstream the direction of flow protect the sanitary insert elements from dirt particles carried along in the water.  The screen attachments are usually connected to the other<br><br>
structural components and are inserted as one associated functional unit in an outflow nozzle attached to the water outlet of a faucet with e.g. screws or are inserted directly into the faucet. Screen attachments are typically made from a nontransparent synthetic material which obstructs the view of the insert elements disposed at the outflow side. As such, the user thus cannot readily tell which additional stream-forming or flow rate restricting means are provided inside the stream regulator.<br>
Since, as noted above, the spectrum of stream regulator or stream former variants span different flow rate classes, whereby only 6 1/min at 3 bar is required to operate a hand washbasin faucet, for example, while 30 1/min at 3 bar is recommended for filling a bathtub, and as also noted above, there are different technologies for producing the flow rate classes as well as producing laminar, crystal-clear or aerated streams, the user of commercially-available stream regulators, especially when dealing with spare parts, is often not able to tell which stream regulator needs to be inserted into the existing faucet so that it will operate trouble-free and comply with the necessary comfort and safety requirements.<br>
Moreover, since even for a large multitude of final products, the number of function-defining components should be kept as low as possible for technical manufacturing and cost-cutting reasons, and ultimately to also keep stock to a minimum, attempts have already been made to provide the entire necessary array of products using a combination of just a few components or component units. However, a manufacturing process also has to ensure, subject to quality assurance, that only those components are in fact used which, as a whole, ensure the desired parameters of the stream regulator the customer will ultimately use.<br>
A further difficulty in the prior art with regard to identifying suitable stream regulators relates to the fact that due to faucets normally being standardized, it is not possible to realize type-relevant or application-specific measures with e.g. a particular external design. This is compounded by the fact that stream regulators are frequently sold as OEM<br><br>
products, whereby there are only specifications from the particular faucet manufacturer, both with respect to the stream regulator itself as well as the typically metallic outer housing which accommodates the stream regulator in its interior and which is connected to the outlet faucet, not, however, specifications on the specific properties of the particular stream regulator. In other words, there is a relatively high risk of confusion relative the prior art, particularly when the products are sold without an outer housing for spare part needs.<br>

The present invention also relates to use of a sanitary component, namely a stream regulator or stream former for flowing fluid media, consisting of property-defining components in a sandwich-like arrangement in the direction of flow which comprise at least one circular screen attachment, one circular diffuser plate assembly as well as a cylindrical shell body having segments of stream-forming openings extending across its cross-sectional surface, wherein to realize the adaptability to the most diverse user and use requirements, said property-defining components are exchangeable and combinable and locking means are provided for this purpose on the inner circumference of the shell body and corresponding counter-locking means are provided on the outer circumference of the circular diffuser plate assembly, the circular diffuser plate assembly exhibits, at least on its exterior, a flow rate class-specifying optical code and the shell body a stream type-specifying optical code, namely laminar or aerated, the screen attachment furthermore being inserted into a circumferential inner recess of the circular diffuser plate assembly, wherein in the case of a flow regulator disposed between the screen attachment and the diffuser plate assembly, the screen attachment is of translucent or transparent design and the flow regulator has another optical coding as well as in the case of there being no flow regulator provided, the optical coding of the screen attachment is designed to match that of the diffuser plate assembly or be provided in a predefined combination, based on a manufacturer-authorized code table which indicates which specific optical coding as identifiable on the components without disassembly corresponds to, or approximates to the greatest extent possible, the respective application in terms of stream pattern, flow rate restriction and/or flow rate classes.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention, the coding is realized as colors of different color temperatures.<br><br>
Based on the above, the task the invention therefore addresses is that of further developing a sanitary component, namely a stream regulator or a stream former for flowing fluid media, which can be clearly identified both in the manufacturing process as well as in subsequent use by various different design and technological measures and whereby it is possible to realize the manufacture of such components in an effective, cost-efficient and simple manner without compromising the quality standards respective the final product.<br>
A further task of the invention is the developing of a method for manufacturing such sanitary components, namely stream regulators or stream formers, which is conducive to an automated assembly of stream regulators or stream formers.<br>
Last but not least, it should be possible to use such sanitary components, namely stream regulators or stream formers, in such a manner that use of unsuitable components can be excluded with a probability bordering on certainty, e.g. a flow rate class for filling a bathtub used with a faucet for a hand washbasin. The same applies to the case, as should be avoided, of OEM customers using unsuitable components.<br>
The solution to this task of the invention is realized with a sanitary component in accordance with the features of claim 1, a method for manufacturing such a sanitary component in accordance with the definition of claim 20, as well as the specific use of sanitary components according to the teaching of claim 22, whereby the subclaims constitute no less than functional designs and embodiments.<br>
The sanitary component according to the invention, namely in the form of a stream regulator or stream former for flowing fluid media, consists of property-defining components in a sandwich-like or stacked arrangement.<br>
These components comprise at least one preferably circular screen attachment or filter screen, one preferably circular or circular-cylindrical<br><br>
diffuser plate assembly as well as a preferably cylindrical shell body having segments with stream-straightening or stream-forming openings extending across its cross-sectional surface.<br>
To realize an adaptability to the most diverse user and use requirements, said property-defining components are exchangeable and combinable. To this end, locking means are for example arranged on the inner circumference of the shell body and corresponding counter-locking means are arranged for example on the outer circumference of the circular diffuser plate assembly. These means are preferably formed integrally; i.e. as one piece with the respective component.<br>
The preferably circular or circular-cylindrical diffuser plate assembly exhibits a coding specifying the flow rate class, at least on its exterior, and the shell body exhibits a coding defining the flow type or the stream pattern respectively. The flow type or stream pattern is preferably laminar with a crystal-clear stream or bubbly; i.e. aerated. The flow type or stream pattern is symbolized by a specifying optical coding.<br>
In a further embodiment of the inventive stream regulator, the outflow area of the shell body comprises a pivotable insert or pivotable stream straightener provided with stream-forming means.<br>
With the circular embodiment of the diffuser plate assembly and the shell body, the inside of the shell body is configured in the shape of a spherical cap and the pivotable stream straightener likewise has a complementary spherical cap shape. The pivotable stream straightener allows the outflow stream to be titled or swiveled at a specific angle from the longitudinal axis of the stream regulator. Moving the straightener in terms of the desired pivoting can be realized without any auxiliary means; i.e. by simply pressing a finger lightly on the underside of the plate.<br><br>
The type of given stream regulator design, with or without a pivotable stream by means of a movable stream straightener, can be symbolized by a further optical coding.<br>
In a modified embodiment of an inventive stream regulator, a coating of a defined minimum thickness or minimum strength made of an elastomer material, e.g. silicone, is provided on the outer surface of the flow straightener, which can also be formed integrally with the shell body. This coating thereby follows the contour or structure of the straightener in the direction of flow. The especially calciferous deposits which adhere to the elastomer coating over the serviceable life of the stream regulator can be removed very easily by gently moving; i.e. rubbing the coating.<br>
The type of coating on the exterior of the flow straightener moreover allows another haptic; i.e. tactile coding in the sense of the inventive task.<br>
Finally, stream regulators are known which are not accommodated within a metallic outer sleeve but rather screwed directly into the e.g. tubular end of an outflow faucet. Such concealed stream regulators comprise a shell body with a male thread and a washer which is usually disposed in a circumferential groove. Said washer can have an optical; i.e. color coding differing from the color coding of the shell body. This coding then symbolizes e.g. the type of male thread, the thread pitch or the like.<br>
In one embodiment, the screen attachment is inserted into a circumferential inner recess of the circular diffuser plate assembly, preferably by means of a locking or snap-in connection, whereby in the case of a flow regulator disposed between the screen attachment and the diffuser plate assembly, the screen attachment is designed to be translucent or transparent and the flow regulator has another optical coding.<br><br>
In the case where no flow regulator is provided, the optical coding of the screen attachment is designed to match that of the diffuser plate assembly or be provided in a predefined combination.<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment of the teaching of the invention, the optical codings are designed as respectively different color codings.<br>
The color gradings or color differences to the respective codings relate to color temperatures which can be detected by means of optoelectronic image detection and analysis. It is also within the sense of the invention for the color gradings to be readily perceived by the human eye.<br>
The color codes for the screen attachment comprise 21 colors, namely dark green, burgundy, light green, light blue, yellow, dark blue, dark gray, light gray, gray, orange, blue, ivory, green, brown, olive, red, beige, black, pink, purple and white.<br>
The color codes for the flow regulator comprise ten colors, preferably namely light green, dark gray, green, purple, dark blue, pink, orange, black, yellow and white.<br>
The color codes for the diffuser plate assembly comprise at least eleven colors, namely dark green, burgundy, light green, light blue, yellow, dark blue, dark gray, light gray, gray, orange and neutral. The neutral shade is to be understood as a color ensuing from the preferably synthetic material used, along with its material properties, without the addition of any color. When using the preferable POM material, this results in a shade which is opaque to milky white.<br>
The diffuser plate assembly is typically inserted into the shell body, but can also be configured as, for example, a component having an annular outer contour differing from the color of the shell body. A neutral color to the diffuser plate assembly then symbolizes a non-noise-reducing model while a colored variant symbolizes a noise-reducing model.<br><br>
The color coding to the shell body comprises at least two colors, whereby a first color is associated with a shell body having air supply slots and a second color is associated with a shell body without air supply slots.<br>
The first color is preferably dark gray while the second color is preferably light gray, whereby each shell body is of a solid-colored synthetic material.<br>
A complementary color code for the shell body or the base of the shell body, namely with a colored marking clearly differing from the aforementioned two colors, applies to an embodiment in which the flow straightener is configured as a pivotable insert for the shell body. For example, the color white symbolizes a pivotable embodiment while the dark gray or light gray colors symbolize a fixed embodiment.<br>
The flow regulator used in the respective sanitary component comprises a control gap, the flow cross-section of which can be altered by means of an elastically deformable ring under the pressure of the flowing fluid medium.<br>
The transparency to the screen attachment is selected such that the position of the deformable ring is or remains identifiable on the one hand and, on the other, the entire flow regulator including its coding is visible.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the elastic ring can likewise exhibit a visually identifiable coding, in particular a color coding, which differs from the control gap or its surrounding area.<br>
The screen attachment is configured to have a convex or conical shape at the inflow side.<br>
The screen attachment preferably exhibits polygonal screen openings and has an annular collar which locks into place in the inner recess of the<br><br>
circular diffuser plate assembly. The basic tint to the screen attachment can moreover provide a simple, easily-grasped indication of the preferred specific application, e.g. "water-saving," maximum flow," or "normal use."<br>
As set forth above, subject to the use-specific requirements, a selection can be made from among different diffuser plate assemblies and shell bodies, as well as flow regulators where applicable, whereby these components can be easily assembled using for example locking means or snap-in connections. Although there are only a small number of individual components visible in the assembled state, this proposed type of optical coding provides the opportunity to make a visual determination just by a quick identification of the corresponding matching pattern or colored depiction; i.e. without any other aid, as to whether the given product will correspond to the expected requirements and/or whether it will be suitable for its intended use.<br>
With respect to the method of manufacturing a sanitary component, namely a stream regulator or stream former for flowing fluid media, the sandwich-like arrangement of the property-defining components in the direction of flow is again in turn assumed, whereby same includes at least one e.g. circular screen attachment, one e.g. circular diffuser plate assembly as well as an e.g. cylindrical shell body having segments of stream-forming, stream-straightening openings extending across its cross-sectional surface.<br>
These property-defining components are exchangeable and combinable so as to realize adaptability to different user and use requirements. To this end, specific locking means or connections which are integrally formed on or inserted into the corresponding components are preferably employed.<br>
The e.g. circular diffuser plate assembly exhibits an optical coding specifying its flow rate class, at least on its exterior, and the shell body exhibits an optical coding specifying flow type; i.e. laminar or aerated.<br><br>
The screen attachment can be inserted into the diffuser plate assembly, preferably by means of the afore-mentioned locking connection, whereby in the case of a flow regulator inserted between the screen attachment and the diffuser plate assembly, the screen attachment is of a translucent or transparent configuration.<br>
The flow regulator likewise exhibits a specifying optical coding. When no flow regulator is provided, the optical coding to the screen attachment matches that of the diffuser plate assembly or is provided in a predefined combination, particularly color combination.<br>
Based on customer-specific requirements as to the flow rate class and respective stream pattern and/or flow rate desired, the method's coding of the property-defining components is gleaned from a code table to match or approximate the customer-specific requirements to the greatest extent possible.<br>
This information facilitates the retrieval of the components from inventory as well as their assembly, and also allows for automating and control. Optoelectronic image acquisition and digital image processing methods are particularly well-suited for such control purposes.<br>
The use or application of sanitary components pursuant the invention, in particular as defined in claim 1, is realized drawing on a manufacturer-authorized code table which indicates which specific optical coding as identifiable on the components without disassembly corresponds to, or approximates to the greatest extent possible, the respective application in terms of stream pattern, flow rate restriction and/or flow rate class.<br>
It is noted at this point that realizing the teaching according to the invention not only can optimize the manufacturing process and improve quality  assurance,  but  also  allows  the  end  user  to  readily  identify  the<br><br>
respective    replacement    model,    ultimately    with    the    consequence    of simplifying the preparing of orders and the actual purchase.<br>

Table 8: The color codes for the shell body, the shell base respectively, in terms of the desired stream direction when using the sanitary component.<br>
In accordance with Figures. 2 and 2a, the sanitary component comprises a flow-regulated stream regulator (Figure. 2a) having property-defining components arranged in sandwich-like manner in the direction of flow. Figures. 1 and la show a sanitary component having a stream regulator which only forms or straightens the stream.<br>
The most essential element of the sanitary components according to the invention is the shell body 1 provided with flow-straightening, stream-forming means 2 (flow straightener) comprising openings at its underside or lower section.<br><br>
The shell body 1 has slot-like openings 3 across certain sections of its outer circumference which serve in the supply of ambient air; namely when an aerated, bubbly stream pattern is to be produced.<br>
A circular diffuser plate assembly 4 is disposed upside the shell body 1 in the inflow direction. This diffuser plate assembly 4 exhibits a plurality of special, flow-dividing openings of different cross-sections or varying longitudinal cuts so as to accelerate the inflowing fluid and pass it through to the flow straightener 2 arranged downstream in the direction of flow.<br>
The diffuser plate assembly 4 is brought into contact with the interior of the shell body 1, e.g. by means of a locking connection 5, and is fixed accordingly.<br>
Thus, to realize adaptability to different user and use requirements, the property-defining components, namely the diffuser plate assembly 4 and the shell body 1, are exchangeable and combinable with the stream-forming means 2. To this end, locking means are disposed, preferably integrated, on the inner circumference of the shell body 1, while the corresponding counter-locking means are arranged, preferably integrated, on the outer circumference of the circular diffuser plate assembly 4.<br>
The circular diffuser plate assembly 4 is coded at least on its outer side. The shell body 1 is likewise coded at least on its outer side, whereby both the circular diffuser plate assembly 4 as well as the shell body 1 is preferably made of a solid-colored synthetic material, whereby the synthetic material's color corresponds to the desired optical coding.<br>
A screen attachment 6 is also inserted into the diffuser plate assembly 4, preferably by means of a locking connection 5.1 or by flush-fitting. For this   purpose,   one   embodiment  provides   for  the   circular   diffuser   plate<br><br>
assembly 4 to comprise an inner recess and the screen attachment 6 a partial or full collar complementary thereto.<br>
In the case of a flow regulator 7 inserted between the screen attachment 6 and the diffuser plate assembly 4 (see Figures. 2 and 2a), the screen attachment 6 is of a transparent design pursuant this embodiment (see Figure. 2) and the flow regulator 7 has another optical coding which differs from that of the given diffuser plate assembly 4.<br>
In the case of there being no flow regulator 7 (Figures. 1 and la), the optical coding of the screen attachment 6 is designed to match that of the diffuser plate assembly 4 or is provided in a predefined combination, in particular a color combination in accordance with Table 1.<br>
A consideration of Tables 1 to 3 and the embodiment of the sanitary components according to Figures, la, 2a and 3 allows for readily deriving the scope of application as well as the product specification or parameters.<br>
The product pursuant Figure 1 or la is accordingly a stream regulator having a shell body 1 and slot-shaped openings 3 which, pursuant Table 3, is of a dark gray color. A dark gray shell body 1 here signifies that the product produces an aerated stream.<br>
The combination of dark blue diffuser plate assembly 4 and dark blue screen attachment 6 results in a stream regulator suitable for flow rate class B (see Table 1).<br>
The sanitary component according to Figures. 2 and 2a relates to a flow-regulated stream regulator, namely for the reason that its screen attachment 6 is transparent. The flow regulator 7 visible through transparent screen 6 is yellow, meaning a flow rate of a maximum 8.3 1/min at its intended use and pursuant the impending, also variable, pressure.<br><br>
The elastically deformable ring 10 disposed in a control gap 11 is also visible. In the unloaded state, this ring 10 cannot be deformed and must assume a target position with respect to the flow cross-section to be altered. The corresponding position of the deformable ring 10 can be readily deduced with the transparent screen attachment 6 as employed.<br>
With reference to Figure 2a and a consideration of Table 3, the shell body 1 shown therein likewise has a dark gray color, signifying that the stream produced in this case is also aerated.<br>
Should the shell body 1 have a light gray color, that would signify that a laminar stream would be produced in accordance with the intended use of the respective stream regulator.<br>
The sanitary component of Figure 3 with its multi-member diffuser plate assembly comprises a screen 12 with a through-flow opening 13, This through-flow opening, the flow rate class-defining dimension of which is not readily visible to the user, can be symbolized by the coloring to the ring member 14 and/or the coloring to the screen attachment 6. The ring member 14 can be configured as an integral part of the diffuser plate assembly.<br>
The embodiment of the stream regulator according to Figure 4 has essentially the same basic construction as that shown in Figures 1 and 2, respectively la and 2a.<br>
The diffuser plate assembly is disposed in the interior of shell body 1 and has an upper part 4.1 for the purpose of accelerating the stream and a lower part 4.2 for dividing and decelerating the accelerated stream. The flow straightener 2 is disposed underneath the diffuser plate assembly as pivotable element 8. In order to obtain the pivoting motion shown as an example in Figure 4, the lower section of the inner circumference of shell body  1  is configured in spherical cap shape. The outer circumference of<br><br>
pivotable element 8 has the correspondingly complementary spherical cap shape 9. Because it is possible to pivot element 8, the out flowing stream can be moved back and forth at a specific angle, yielding substantial applicational advantages for a water faucet fitted with same.<br>
The color coding of the pivotable element 8 as the base of the shell body can be designed to differ in color from the shell body 1 so as to likewise enable a clear correlation in the sense of the invention, e.g. the color according to Table 8.<br>
Providing an additional haptic coding to the outer surface of the flow straightener or the shell base allows for the defining of the sanitary components' resistance to lime deposits pursuant Table 7. The choice of color to the non-transparent screen attachment moreover offers the user of the sanitary component a clear indication of its preferred use, e.g. conserving water. For example, according to the present Tables 4 and 5, the color "green" signifies water economizing based on a reduced flow rate.<br>
It is to be noted at this point that all the afore-mentioned optical codings are predefined irrespective of the given diameters or dimensions to the sanitary components. The optical codings relate only to the stream regulator's function-defining or comfort-defining properties.<br>
Figure 5 shows a sanitary component, the shell body 1 of which comprises a male threads 15 so that it can be screwed directly into a complementary female thread of an outflow faucet. The codings as described above can also be used here as well for flow rate classes and/or flow regulation. There is also the additional possibility of defining the type and/or pitch to the male thread 15 by the color code of the requisite washer 16.<br><br>
