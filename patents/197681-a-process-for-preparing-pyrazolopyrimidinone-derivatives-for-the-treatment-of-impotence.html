				<td>A PROCESS FOR PREPARING PYRAZOLOPYRIMIDINONE DERIVATIVES FOR THE TREATMENT OF IMPOTENCE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparing pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives of formula 1 and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof which have an  efficacy  on  impotence,  comprising  the  steps  of chlorosulfonation of pyrazolamide compounds of formula 2, followed  by  amination  with  a  primary  amine  and intramolecular cyclization. <br>
Formula 1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Formula 2<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
The compounds of formula 1 may exist in tautomeric equilibrium as shown below.<br><br>
The compounds of formula 1 may asymmetric centers and thus they can exist as enantiomers. The present invention includes both racemic mixture and separate individual enantiomers.<br>
BACKGROUND ART OF THE INVENTION<br>
Male erectile dysfunction is one of the most common sexual dysfunctions in man. Although erectile dysfunction can be primarily psychogenic in origin, it often accompanies chronic illnesses, such as diabetes mellitus, heart disease and a variety of neurological diseases. It is estimated that about 2 ~ 7% of the male population are impotent. Its prevalence is strongly related to age. For example, 18 ~ 75% of the age group of 55 to 80 years is believed to be impotent.<br>
Various treatment options for erectile dysfunction are available, such as counseling, hormone replacement therapy, self-injection or transurethral application of vasodilator agents, vacuum devices, and vascular surgery. However, these therapeutic options have several limitations<br><br>
such as side effects, high cost and low efficacy.<br>
Recently, Sildenafil has been developed as a therapeutic agent for male erectile dysfuction by oral administration. Sildenafil is the first in a new class of<br>
i<br>
drugs known as inhibiting phosphodiesterase-5 enzyme distributed specifically in corpus cavernosal tissues and induces relaxation of the corpus cavernosal smooth muscle cells, so that blood flow to the penis is enhanced, leading to an erection. Sildenafil has shown a response rate of around 80% in men with erectile dysfunction of organic cause.<br>
Since sildenafil has been developed, various compound$ for inhibiting phosphodiesterase-5 have been<br>
reported   Among them, pyrazolopyrimidinone compounds of<br>
 formula ,1  (KR Pat. No.  99-49384) IN/PCT/2001/00271/ were reported having<br>
better potency than that of sildenafil, based on the mechanism of inhibiting phosphodiesterase-5 and having better selectivity over phosphodiesterase-6 distributed in retina and phosphodiesterase-3 distributed in  heart to reduce the side effects. Further, the pyrazolopyrimidinone compounds of formula 1 were said to be improved the solubility and the metabolism in the liver, which are very important factor affecting the rate of the absorption when administered orally.<br>
The KR patent No. 99-49384 also disclosed a process for preparing the pyrazolopyrimidinone compounds of formula<br><br>
1, comprising the steps of:	'   .<br>
a)	reacting chlorosulfonated alkoxy bonzoie acid with a<br>
primary  amine  to  obtain  sulfonamide-substituted<br>
benzoic acid;<br>
b)	reacting   the   obtained   sulfonamide-substituted<br>
benzoic acid with pyrazolamine in the presence of<br>
activating reagent of carboxylic group or coupling<br>
agent of carboxylic group with amine group to obtain<br>
corresponding amide compound? and,<br>
c)	performing  an  intramolecular  cyclization  of  the<br>
obtained    amide    compound    to    obtain    the<br>
pyrazolopyrimidinone compound of formula 1.<br>
This reaction is represented in scheme 1. Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme Removed)<br>
However, the said process has several disadvantages. First, the reaction of the sulfonamide-substituted benzoic<br><br>
acid with pyrazolamine in the step b) requires the expensive coupling reagent or activation reagent such as trichloro benzoyl chloride and EEDQ (N-ethoxycarbonyl-2-ethoxy-1,3-dihydroquinoline) . Second, the yield of the step a) in which the chlorosulfonated alkoxy bonzoic acid reacts with a primary amine to produce sulfonamide-substututed benzoic acid is somewhat low, and thus, reduces the total yield of the process.<br>
Leading to the present invention, the intensive and thorough research for efficiently preparing the pyrazolopyrimidinone compound useful for the treatment of impotence, carried out by the present inventors aiming to avoid the problems encountered in the prior arts, resulted in the finding that the pyrazolopyrimidinone compound can be prepared under mild condition in high yield, with high purity and in a economic manner by chlorosulfonation, amination with a primary amine and intramolecular cyclization of a pyrazolamide compound obtained by the reaction of alkoxy benzoic acid with pyrazolamine.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a process for preparing pyrazolopyrimidinone derivatives of formula I and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof.<br><br>

Hereinafter, a detailed description will be given of the method of the present invention according to each step.<br>
I.	Chlorosulfonation Step (step a)<br>
4-(2-alkoxy benzamido)-l-alkyl-3-alkyl-5-carbamoyl pyrazole of formula 2 is directly reacted with chlorosulfonic acid or reacted with a mixture of chlorosulfonic acid and suitable amounts of thionyl chloride at an appropriate temperature, 20 °C or lower, to prepare the chlorosulfonated compound of formula 3.<br>
II.	Sulfonamidization Step (step b)<br>
The obtained chlorosulfonated compound is reacted<br><br>
with a primary amine in an appropriate solvent at suitable temperature, to produce the sulfonamide compound of formula 4.<br>
s<br>
The solvent which can be used in this reaction includes alcohol, dichloromethane and chloroform, but not limited thereto. The skilled in the art would adapt an appropriate solvent in the consideration of the solubility of the starting material, reaction condition, etc.<br>
As a primary amine used,, 2- (2-aminoethyl) -1-methylpyrrolidine, 3-aminomethyl-l-methylpyrrolidine or 2-amihomethyl-pyridine can be preferably mentioned. The amount of the primary amine used in this reaction is no less than 2 equivalents based on the chlorosulfonated compound. Alternatively, when acid scavenger such as tertiary amine, which scavenging the, acid generated during the reaction, is used, the primary amine can be used in a stoichiometric quantity.<br>
The reaction temperature of this reaction is preferably 20 °C or lower. The sulfonamide compound of formula 4 can be worked up from the reaction mixture and proceeded, to the next reaction step c) . Or  step c) can be performed in situ by just adding a suitable base to the<br><br>
reaction mixture in situ without workup.<br>
III. Intramolecular Cyclization Step (step c) Pyrazolopyrimidinone of formula 1 is prepared through intramolecular cyclization of the sulfonamide compound of formula 4. The intramolecular cyclization is carried out in the presence of a suitable base at the appropriate temperature. For example, metal salts of alcohol, metal salts of ammonia, amine, alkali or alkali earth metal hydrides, hydroxides, carbonates, bicarbonates, and bicyclic amidines such as DBU (1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene) and DBN (1,5-diazabicyclo[4.3.0]non-5-ene) can be mentioned as a suitable base.<br>
The solvent which can be used in the intramolecular cyclization includes alcohol such as methanol, ethanol, isopropanol and t-butanol; ether including tetrahydrofuran, dimethoxyethane and ,dioxane; aromatic hydrocarbons, such as benzene, toluene, xylene, chloro benzene; acetonitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one and pyridine.<br>
The present invention provides the sulfonamide compound of formula 4 from step a) and step b) reaction in good yield and in high purity. And as previously mentioned, the step c) can be performed in situ with the<br><br>
sulfonamide compound of formula 4 produced in the step b) in a one-pot reaction, thereby reducing the overall procedure of the reaction and effectuating the efficient synthesis of pyrazolopyrimidinone compound of formula 1.<br>
In particular, according to the preferred embodiment of the present invention, even though tertiary amine was used as a part of substituent of R4, the yield of the reaction was high.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for preparing pharmaceutically acceptable salts of pyrazolopyrimidinone compound as represented in formula 1, wherein the pharmaceutically acceptable salts of pyrazolopyrimidinone compound can be prepared by adding a pharmaceutically acceptable free acid to the pyrazolopyrimidinone compound of formula 1. Examples of a free acid include inorganic acids, for example, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and so on; and organic acids, for example, citric acid, acetic acid, lactic acid, tartaric acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, gluconic acid, methanesulfonic acid, glycolic acid, succinic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, galacturonic acid, glutamic acid, or aspartic acid.<br><br>
