-	skin diseases, such as psoriasis, atopic dermatitis,<br>
-	immune-mediated condiţiona of the eye, such as auto-immune diseases, e.g, including<br>
uveitis, keratoplasty and chronic keratitis,<br>
-	allergic condiţiona, e.g. vernal conjunctivitis, inflammatory condiţiona, corneal transplanta.<br>
Processes for the production of 33-Epi-33-chloro-FR 520 are known. We have now found surprislngly a process for the production of 33-Epi-33-chloro-FR 520 from FR520 (ascomycin) in which process the use of protecting groups may be avoided. Such process may be carried out in one single chemical process step.<br>
In one aspect the present invention provides an one-step process for the production of 33-Epi-33-chloro-FR 520 from FR520.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a process for the production of 33-epi-33-chloro-FR 520 from FR520 whereln protecting groups are avoided, e.g. wherein protecting group technology is avoided.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a process for the production of 33-Epi-33-chloro-FR 520 comprising reacting the compound FR520 with an appropriate chlorinating agent in organic solvent, optionally in the presence of a base, and isolating 33-Epi-33-chloro-FR 520 obtained from the reaction mixture.<br>
In a process according to the present invention FR520, the chlorinating agent and optionally the base, optionally each in organic solvent, or as such, are mixed and the mixture obtained is stirred at appropriate temperatura for a period sufflcient for reaction. The reaction mixture obtained may be worked up, e.g. analogousiy to a method as convenţional, e.g. by aqueous -extraction and evaporation of the organic solvent. The work up residue obtained comprising 33-Epi-33-chloro-FR 520 may be further purified, e.g. by chromatography, crystalllzation.<br>
An appropriate chlorinating agent includes e.g. dichlorotriphenylphosphorane. The chlorinating agent may be used as such or may be provided in situ, e.g. by treating triphenylphosphine with a chlorinated alkane, e.g. (d^alkane, such as CCI* C2CI8, preferably CCI4; or by addition of triphenylphosphine to N-chlorosuccinimide in organic solvent.<br>
Organic solvent includes appropriate organic solvent, such as hydrocarbons, e.g. aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. benzene, toluene; ethers, such as tetrahydrofurane; nitriles, e.g. acetonitrile; chlorinated alkanes, such as CCI* and mixtures of individual cited solvent. E.g., the reaction mixture may be diluted with a second solvent, e.g., if as the organic solvent toluene is used, preferably with acetonitrile, in order to facilitate stirring. Preferably organic solvent includes toluene, acetonitrile or tetrahydrofurane, or optionally a mixture of toluene and acetonitrile, in case of using triphenylphosphine and N-chlorosuccinimide for the preparation of dichlorotriphenylphosphorane as a chlorinating agent. Preferably organic solvent includes a halogenated alkane in case of using triphenylphosphine and a halogenated alkane for the preparation of dichlorotriphenylphosphorane as a chlorinating agent.In another aspect the organic solvent in a process of the present inventlon is selected from the group consisting of aromatic hydrocarbons, ethers and nitriles.<br>
In case of using triphenylphosphine and a chlorinated alkane as a solvent, the chlorinated alkane may be used in one aspect as a halogen source for the production of dichlorotriphenylphosphorane and, in another aspect, as organic solvent, although the addition of further organic solvent, e.g. such as cited above, is not excluded.<br>
Appropriate reaction temperatures include temperatures from room temperature to about 100°C, such as from room temperature to about 80°C, e.g. from room temperature to about 70°C, e.g. from room temperature to 70°C, 80°C or 100°C. In case of using a chlorinated alkane and triphenylphosphine for the production of the chlorinating agent, such as CCI», preferably the reaction temperature is reflux temperature of the chlorinated alkane.<br>
E.g. FR520 is treated with dichlorotriphenylphosphorane,<br>
e.g. dichlorotriphenylphosphorane is provided by treating triphenylphosphine with<br>
-	N-chlorosuccinimide In organic solvent, e.g. organic solvent as described above, preferably<br>
an ether or an aromatic hydrocarbon,<br>
-	chlorinated alkanes as a chlorinating agent and as a solvent, such as CCI4, in which case<br>
no further organic solvent is necessary, although the addition of further organic solvent,<br>
e.g. such as described above, is not excluded,<br>
-	solid chlorinated alkanes in organic solvent, such as C2CI8 in organic solvent, e.g. organic<br>
solvent as described above, preferably an ether or an aromatic hydrocarbon,<br>
optionally in the presence of a base.<br>
A base includes appropriate bases, such as organic bases, e.g. nitrogen containing bases, preferably such as tert.amines or heterocyclic bases containing at least one nitrogen atom, more preferably aromatic heterocyclic bases, such as a pyridine, an imidazole; preferably a pyridine, such as pyridine, 2,4,6-trimethylpyridine (s-collidine). In the case of using triphenylphosphine and a chlorinated alkane for the production of a chlorinating agent, during the reaction of FR520 with the chlorinating agent a base optionally may be present. In case of using triphenylphosphine and N-chlorosuccinimide for the<br>
production of a chlorinating agent durlng the reaction of FR520 with the chlorinating agent the presence of a base is preferred, e.g. a base should be present.<br>
In a preferred aspect of the present invention N-chlorosuccinimide is treated with triphenylphosphine in organic solvent and, to the mixture obtained, a base and FR520 are added, e.g. in portions, under stirring and heating.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a process for the production of 33-Epi-33-chloro-FR 520, comprising reacting FR 520 in organic solvent with a chlorinating agent in the presence of a base, e.g. under appropriate temperature, wherein the chlorinating agent is provided by treating triphenylphosphine with N-chlorosuccinimide in organic solvent.<br>
In another preferred aspect of the present invention triphenylphosphine is treated with a chlorinated alkane and FR 520 is added under stirring and heating.<br>
In another aspect the present invention provides a process for the production of 33-Epl-33-<br>
chloro-FR 520 from FR520, comprising reacting FR 520 with a chlorinating agent in organic<br>
solvent, e.g. under appropriate temperature, wherein the chlorinating agent is provided by<br>
treating triphenylphosphine with a chlorinated alkane,<br>
e.g. wherein the organic solvent preferably is a chlorinated alkane,<br>
e.g. in the absence of a base.<br>
The ratio of FR520 and the chlorinating agent should be at least an equivalent ratio, preferably an excess of the chlorinating agent is used, e.g. ascomycin and the chlorinating agent a used in a ratio from about 1:1 to about 1:3 (per equivalent of ascomycin 1 to 3 equivalents of the chlorinating agent), such asfrom about 1:1 to about 1:2, e.g. from about 1:1 to about 1:5, preferably from about 1:1 to about 1:1.3, e.g. a ratio from 1:1 to 1:3, such asfrom 1:1 to 1:2, e.g. from 1:1 to1:5, preferably from 1:1 to 1:1.3 may beappropriate. The ratio of FR520 and the base should be at least an equivalent ratio, preferably an excess of the base is used, e.g. FR520 and the base are used in a ratio from about 1:1 to about 1:10 (per equivalent FR5201 to 10 equivalents of the base), such as from about 1:2 to about 1:10, e.g. from about 1:3 to about 1:9, preferably from about 1:4 to 1:8;, e.g. a ratio from 1:1 to 1:10, such as from 1:2 to 1:10, e.g. from 1:3 to 1:9, preferably from 1:4 to 1:8 may be appropriate.<br>
After a sufficient period of time which period may be determined by e.g. thin layer chromatography or HPLC, the mixutre obtained comprising FR520, the chiorinating agent and optionally a base, is worked up. Work up may be preferably carried out by subjecting to aqueous extraction. From the organic phase obtained by extraction, solvent may be removed, e.g. by distillation, such as evaporation, and the (distillation, evaporation) residue obtained may be subjected to further purification, e.g. subjected to chromatography, e.g. subjected to chromatography over silicagel. 33-Epi-33-chloro-FR 520 is obtained and may be crystallized as appropriate, e.g. from a mixture of water and ethanol.<br>
 <br>
From chromatography optionally unreacted ascomycin may be recollected. Recollected ascomycin may again undergo a reaction according to the present invention.<br>
