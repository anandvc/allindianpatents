CONTROL OF COOLING WATER SYSTEM USING RATE OF CONSUMPTION<br>
OF FLUORESCENT POLYMER<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for controlling cooling water systems based on calculated information.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A cooling water system comprises a cooling tower, heat exchangers, pumps and all necessary piping to move water through the system. Control of a cooling water system is based on balancing the desire to run the cooling water system at the highest concentration cycles possible without incurring detrimental scaling, corrosion, fouling or microbiological control situations.<br>
A concentration cycle is defined for a specific species as:<br>
Specific Species Level in Cooling Water Tower Specific Species Level in Make-Up Water<br>
For example, when the specific species is the calcium ion ( Ca+2) and a cooling water system is running at 500 ppm Ca+2 with 150 ppm Ca+2 in the makeup water, the cooling water system is running at 3.3 concentration cycles. In operating a cooling water system it is desirable to achieve the maximum number of concentration cycles to avoid unnecessary loss of water in blowdown as well as unnecessary overfeeding of treatment chemicals including but not limited to, treatment polymers. The maximum concentration cycles for a cooling water system are limited by the undesirable events, such as scaling and corrosion, which occur when the amount of specific species in the<br><br>
WO 2005/110925	PCT/US2005/014189<br>
2 cooling water tower reaches a certain level, such that the species contributes to these<br>
problems.<br>
There are several currently known ways used to control the concentration cycles in cooling water systems. Controlling the concentration cycles is typically done by controlling the flow rate of "fresh" water (from one or more sources) known as makeup water into the system and by controlling the main flow rate out of the system, referred to as blowdown. In order to control makeup water flow, a pump or valve controls the flow of make-up water into the cooling tower and a level controller is typically used in the cooling tower reservoir or "sump". The level controller is linked to the make-up water pump or valve and when the water in the sump decreases to a point lower than the setpoint for the level controller the make-up water pump or valve is activated.<br>
Conductivity is the typical method of blowdown control. For purposes of this patent application, conductivity is defined as the measurement of electrical conductivity of water with electrical conductivity being present in the water due to ionic species being present in the water. Conductivity can be used to control bleed of blowdown because conductivity can readily be used to estimate the overall amount of ionic species present in the water and a simple controller can be set to open a valve or pump and start blowdown when the conductivity of the reservoir water reaches above a certain setpoint.<br>
There are limits to how useful conductivity is for control of a cooling water system as conductivity is nothing more than an indirect measure of the scaling tendency of the water as indicated by the amount of ionic species present. Small amounts of scaling species such as phosphate ions do not add measurably to the<br><br>
WO 2005/110925	PCT/US2005/014189<br>
3 conductivity, but can result in significant scaling events. Similarly, if the ratio of<br>
scaling species present in the water to the non-scaling species changes over time, blowdown control based on conductivity is an inadequate means of controlling a cooling tower. If the ratio increases, scaling can result. If the ratio decreases, the cooling tower is operated at less than optimal cycles of concentration resulting in wastage of water and chemicals used to treat the system and resulting in other problems such as corrosion. Another concern with conductivity based control in calcium carbonate systems is that above the scaling threshold, the cooling tower can act as a "lime softener". In these situations, as calcium carbonate precipitates, the system conductivity does not change proportionally to tower cycles resulting in sever scaling problems. It is understood in the art of cooling water that conductivity alone cannot be relied upon as the sole analytical based method for control of a cooling tower.<br>
Alternatively, a timer can control bleed of blowdown without really measuring any of the specific species in the water. In addition to or in place of the above control schemes, water flow meters on the make-up and blowdown can be used, in conjunction with a microprocessor controller to do an overall cooling water mass balance.<br>
A problem with these known control schemes, is that when the blowdown is controlled by conductivity and the make-up is controlled by a level controller, if the composition of the usual make-up water is variable, or if there are alternate sources of make-up water that are significantly different from the usual make-up water source, or if there are alternative sources of blowdown that are unaccounted for, level controllers and conductivity cannot account for all events that are occurring in the system. In these cases, the cooling water system is typically controlled by the operator being<br><br>
WO 2005/110925	PCT/US2005/014189<br>
4 conservative with the conductivity setpoint which thus causes extra undesirable<br>
expense due to non-optimal use of treatment chemicals and water.<br>
Many cooling water systems use treatment products to control undesirable events such as scaling, corrosion, fouling and microbiological growth. These treatment products comprise polymers and other materials and are known to people of ordinary skill in the art of cooling water systems. A cooling water control system can be set up to feed treatment product based on either a bleed/feed mechanism where the action of blowdown triggers a chemical feed pump or valve that feeds treatment product; or, in the alternative, the cooling water control system feeds treatment product based on timers using a "feeding schedule" or flow meters on the make-up water line trigger the pumping of treatment product based on a certain amount of make-up water being pumped. A limitation of these control methods is that none of these systems measure the treatment product concentration directly online, so if there is a mechanical problem, for example, if a pump fails, a drum empties, or high, low or unknown blowdown occurs, system volume changes or makeup water quality changes; the correct treatment product concentration is not maintained. Because this problem is common, typically cooling water systems are either overfed to ensure the level of treatment product in the system does not drop too low as a result of high variability in product dosage or the treatment product is unknowingly underfed. Both overfeeding and underfeeding of treatment product are undesirable due to cost and performance drawbacks.<br>
One aspect of known control schemes is an inert fluorescent chemical being added to the cooling water system in a known proportion to the active component of the treatment product feed and the use of a fluorometer to monitor the fluorescent<br><br>
WO 2005/110925	PCT/US2005/014189<br>
5 signal of the inert fluorescent chemical. This is commercially available as TRASAR®<br>
from Nalco Company, 1601 W. Diehl Road, Naperville IL 60563 (630) 305-1000. When using TRASAR® the fluorescent signal of the inert fluorescent chemical is then used to determine whether the desired amount of treatment product is present in the cooling tower and the operating parameters, such as blowdown, can then optionally be adjusted to ensure that the desired amount of treatment product is present.<br>
Many current cooling towers use inert fluorescent tracers to control the treatment product level in the system and also use a conductivity controller to measure the conductivity in the water.<br>
Cooling towers that use both inert fluorescent tracer(s) and conductivity typically use the following types of information in order to control the tower. For example, a cooling tower with typical makeup water having: 150 ppm Ca+2, 75 ppm Mg+2, and 100 ppm "M alkalinity"; with a conductivity of 600 microsiemens per centimeter (^S/cm) is set to run at 500 ppm Ca+2. hi order to operate within acceptable levels, the cycles of concentration for this cooling water system are 3.3 (calculated by dividing 500 by 150). Running the system at 500 ppm Ca+2 corresponds to a conductivity setpoint of 3.3 times 600 or 1980 µS/cm. When the conductivity exceeds this setpoint the system is configured to automatically blowdown a portion of "concentrated" cooling water ("concentrated" referring to system water with an unacceptably high level of ions) which is replaced with "fresh" makeup water (where "fresh" is defined as having a lower level of scaling ions than the "concentrated" cooling water). This decreases the conductivity and hardness (Ca+2 and Mg+2) ions via dilution. Dilution also reduces the amount of inert fluorescent tracer chemical in the system. Decreasing the amount of inert fluorescent tracer in the system decreases the<br><br>
WO 2005/110925	PCT/US2005/014189<br>
6 fluorescent signal from the inert fluorescent tracer. When the fluorescent signal from<br>
tracer decreases, the tracer control system is set up to feed a fresh mixture of treatment product and inert fluorescent tracer chemical to makeup for the decrease in fluorescence that was lost in the blowdown.<br>
A known method of control the amount of water treatment product being added to a cooling water system involves the use of another aspect of TRASAR®. This involves using a treatment product containing a fluorescent polymer that is either inherently fluorescent or a polymer that has been "tagged" with a fluorescent moiety. These fluorescent polymers are not inert, rather, they are supposed to be consumed as they function to treat whatever performance-related condition it is that they are designed to treat. Thus, by measuring the fluorescent signal of the fluorescent polymer it is possible to determine the active polymer in the system and by knowing this to be able to determine the amount of consumption of the fluorescent polymer. By knowing the amount of consumption of the fluorescent polymer it is possible to use that information to control the feeding of new treatment product containing fluorescent polymer.<br>

These fluorescent polymer scale control products are either commercially available from Nalco or are capable of being synthesized by a person of ordinary skill in the art of organic chemistry.<br>
It is understood in the art of scale control chemicals that scale control chemicals are typically divided into two different types, based on the type of scale that they inhibit. There are scale control chemicals that control the deposition of calcium phosphate and scale control chemicals that control the deposition of calcium carbonate.<br>
Typically scale control products for calcium phosphate are the fluorescent polymers previously described. Preferred scale control products for calcium phosphate are tagged polymers. It is known that even though the fluorescent polymers previously<br><br>
WO 2005/110925	PCT/US2005/014189<br>
29 described are primarily effective as calcium phosphate scale inhibitors, when calcium<br>
carbonate scale is inadequately inhibited by calcium carbonate scale inhibitors such as HEDP and PBTC, consumption of the fluorescent polymer is observed, indicating at least partial activity as a calcium carbonate dispersant on the part of the fluorescent polymer.<br>

All of these inert fluorescent tracers are either commercially available from<br>
Nalco or may be synthesized using techniques known to persons of ordinary skill in<br>
the art of organic chemistry.<br>
In formulating the water treatment product the fluorescent polymer is present in<br>

31 water treatment product and the inert fluorescent tracer is present in the water<br>
treatment product in a known proportion to all of the other ingredients in the water treatment product.<br>
In formulating the water treatment product used in the first aspect of the instant claimed invention it is understood that there are no biocides present in the water treatment product. If biocides are added to the cooling water, they are added separately.<br>
In selecting the fluorescent polymer and inert fluorescent tracer to be used together it is necessary to select them such that the fluorescent polymer has a detectable fluorescent signal that is separate from the detectable fluorescent signal of the inert fluorescent tracer. People of ordinary skill in the art of fluorometry know how to use a fiuorometer to detect the fluorescent signal of a material such that they can run the necessary tests to determine which inert fluorescent tracer should be combined with which fluorescent polymer.<br>
This is the "one-drum" method of the instant claimed invention. In the one-drum method, the fluorescent polymer and inert fluorescent tracer are mixed together into a water treatment product, which water treatment product may contain additional water treatment chemicals such as corrosion inhibitors or microbiocides.<br>
The next step in this method is to add the water treatment product comprising fluorescent polymer and inert fluorescent tracer and optional other water treatment chemicals to the water of the cooling water system. This can be done using equipment and techniques known to ordinary people of skill in the art.<br>
The amount of fluorescent polymer, on an "active polymer" basis added to the water of a cooling water system is from about 0.1 ppm to about 1000 ppm, preferably<br><br>
WO 2005/110925	PCT/US2005/014189<br>
32 from about 0.1 ppm to about 100 ppm and most preferably from about 0.1 ppm to<br>
about 20 ppm.<br>
The amount of inert fluorescent tracer added to the water of a cooling water system is from about 0.01 ppm to about 1000 ppm, preferably from about 0.03 ppm to about 10 ppm and most preferably from about 0.05 ppm to about 1.0 ppm.<br>
The overall amount of water treatment product added is based on the "requirement" for this product in the water of the cooling water system. A person of ordinary skill in the art of cooling water knows how to determine the requirement for water treatment product in the water of the cooling water system.<br>
The next step in the method is to provide one or more fluorometers. Suitable fluorometers for use to detect the fluorescent signal of the fluorescent polymer are commercially available and are selected from the group consisting of the fluorometer described and claimed in U.S. Patent No. 6,369,894 entitled, "MODULAR FLUOROMETER AND METHOD OF USING SAME TO DETECT ONE OR MORE FLUOROPHORES", issued April 9,2002, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. This modular fluorometer is available from Nalco.<br>
Other fluorometers suitable for use in the method of the instant claimed invention are the modified TRASAR 8000 fluorometer ("hand-held"); TRASAR 700 fluorometer ("Bench-top"); modified TRASAR 3000; TRASAR Xe-2 Controller; which are all available from Nalco; and the In-Line fluorometer probe, known as the Cyclops 7 fluorometer (optical filters would need to be chosen to match the tracer used) available from Turner Designs, 845 Maude Ave., Sunnyvale, CA 94085 ((408) 749-0994).

Suitable fluorometers for use to detect the inert fluorescent tracer are commercially available and are selected from the group consisting of the fluorometer described and claimed in U.S. Patent No. 6,369,894 entitled, "MODULAR FLUOROMETER AND METHOD OF USING SAME TO DETECT ONE OR MORE FLUOROPHORES", issued April 9,2002, which is herein incorporated by reference in its entirety. This modular fluorometer is available from Nalco.<br>
Other fluorometers suitable for use to detect the inert fluorescent tracer in the method of the instant claimed invention are the TRASAR 8000 fluorometer ("handheld"); TRASAR 700 fluorometer ("Bench-top"); TRASAR 3000 (for pyrene tetrasulfonic acid); modified TRASAR 3000 (for anthracene disulfonic acid disodium salt tracer); TRASAR Xe-2 Controller; and the Interchangeable Tip—Open Cell Fluorometer, which is described and claimed in U.S. Patent Application No. 10/769,631, filed January 30, 2004, and is incorporated by reference in its entirety.

WO 2005/110925	PCT/US2005/014189<br>
34 The Trasar® Xe-Controller, Trasar 3000 and Modular Fluorometer all have<br>
flow cells that permit on-line continuous monitoring of a liquid. The other fluorometers are "grab sample" fluorometers that do not allow for continuous on-line monitoring. In conducting the method of the instant claimed invention, it is preferred to use a fluorometer that permits, on-line, continuous monitoring of fluorescent signals.<br>
The one or more suitable fluorometers are then set up and used to measure the fluorescent signal of the inert fluorescent tracer and the fluorescent signal of the fluorescent polymer in the water from the cooling water system.<br>
It is critical to the workability of the method of the instant claimed invention that the measurements that are used are only those measurements done during the interval of time between the addition of new water treatment product to the water of the cooling water system. Therefore, throughout the first aspect of the method of the instant claimed invention, it is assumed that all measurements that are used in the calculations took place during an interval of time in which no water treatment product is being added to the water of the cooling water system. Also, this means that throughout the second aspect of the method of the instant claimed invention, it is assumed that all measurements that are used in the calculations took place during an interval of time in which no corrosion inhibitor product is being added and in which no scale control product is being added to the water of the cooling water system.<br>
After measuring the fluorescent signals, the measured fluorescent signals are use to calculate the amount of fluorescent polymer and the amount of inert fluorescent tracer present in the water of said cooling water system.<br><br>
WO 2005/110925	PCT/US2005/014189<br>
35 After these amounts are known it is possible to start the calculations for the rate<br>
of consumption of fluorescent polymer. This calculation of rate of consumption of scale control product is done during two different time periods. The first time period is known as the "learning time period" and the measurements taken during intervals within this time period are used to calculate the "normal" or "routine" rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer.<br>
In the following equations the variables "tlf = Time at end of interval during learning period" and "tlO = Time at start of interval during learning period" are used. Thus, the interval during the learning time period itself is tlf- tlO. The amount of time in the interval is the amount of time between the addition of more water treatment chemical because in order for this method to be operable no measurements can be used that are taken when more water treatment chemical is being added.<br>
The total amount of time in the learning time period is based on the understood "normal" operating conditions of the cooling water system. How long the total amount of time in the learning time period is and how many intervals where measurements are taken within the learning time period are required is a decision that can be made by a person of ordinary skill in the art of operating a cooling water system.<br>
The next step in the method of the instant claimed invention is to calculate the rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer during intervals of the learning time period by using an equation selected from the group comprising the Fouling Index equation, the Scale Index equation, and the Tower Scale Index equation as follows:<br><br>
WO 2005/110925	PCT/US2005/014189<br>
36 (i) FIL = [A / (tlf- tlO) ] x [In (LIT(f)/LIT(0)} - In {LTP(f)/LTP(O)}];<br>

38 In the following equations the variables "tef = Time at end of evaluation<br>
period" and "teO = Time at start of evaluation period" are used. Thus, the evaluation time period itself is tef- teO. The amount of time in the evaluation time period is based on desired operating conditions of the cooling water system. It is a decision that can be made by a person of ordinary skill in the art of operating a cooling water system to select how long the evaluation time period needs to be for their cooling water system.

After the calculation has been done during the evaluation time period, the next step is to compare the average rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer during the learning time period with the rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer during the evaluation time period. The comparison is done as follows:<br>
When the fouling index equation is used, if FIE =FILa, then the rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer is the same during the evaluation period as it was during the learning period; if FIE &gt; FILa, the rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer is greater during the evaluation period than it was during the learning period; if FIE 
When the scaling index equation is used, if SEE =SILa, then the rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer is the same during the evaluation period as it was during the learning period; if SEE &gt; SDLa, the rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer is greater during the evaluation period than it was during the learning period; if SEE

Another type of comparison can be done by calculating what is known as the NVincent Scale Index or NVincent Tower Scale Index as follows: NSI = D x [SIE - SIL] / SIL(SD), NTSI = Dx [TSIE-TSIL]/TSIL(SD);<br>
where NSI is the NVincent Scale Index and NTSI is the NVincent Tower Scale Index, where D is a constant =10;<br>
TSIE and SIE and TSIL and SIL are as defined previously, and<br>
TSIL(SD) and SIL(SD) are the standard deviations of TSIL and SIL values, respectively, calculated during the learning time period;<br>
wherein if NSI or NTSI =0, then the rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer is the same during the evaluation period as it was during the learning period; if NSI or NTSI &gt; 0, the rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer is greater during the evaluation period than it was during the learning period; if NSI 
If the rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer is higher or lower during the evaluation time period than it is during the learning time period, then an optional step in the method of the instant claimed invention is that the operator of the cooling water system can adjust the operation of the cooling water system to adjust the rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer to the value that it was during the learning period.<br><br>

and optional scale control chemicals. In formulating the scale control product used in the second aspect of the instant claimed invention it is understood that there are no biocides present in the water treatment product. If biocides are added to the cooling water, they are added separately.<br>
The scale control product and the corrosion inhibitor product are added to the water of said cooling water system. The amount of scale control product and the amount of corrosion inhibitor product added is based on the "requirement" for both of these products in the water of the cooling water system and a person of ordinary skill in the art of cooling water knows how to determine the requirement for corrosion inhibitor product and scale control product in the water of the cooling water system.<br>
After addition of the two products the method proceeds as previously described in the first aspect of the instant claimed invention.<br>
The use of a method of determine the rate of consumption is a valuable method for controlling a cooling water system because it is independent of the initial concentration of either fluorescent species, it can be used when the inert fluorescent tracer and fluorescent polymer are in separate products, the "2-drum" method, and the impact of background fluorescent signal(s) are minimized.<br><br>

58 greater during the evaluation period than it was during the learning period; if<br>
SIE  TSILa, the rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer is greater during the evaluation period than it was during the learning period; if TSIE 
NSI = D x [SIE - SIL] / SDL(SD), NTSI = Dx [TSIE-TSIL]/TSIL(SD);<br>
Where NSI is the NVincent Scale Index and NTSI is the NVincent Tower<br>
Scale Index;<br>
where D is a constant =10;<br>
TSIE and SEE and TSIL and SIL are as defined previously, and<br>
TSEL(SD) and SIL(SD) are the standard deviations of TSEL and SDL, respectively, as calculated during the learning time period; wherein if NSI or NTSI =0, then the rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer is the same during the evaluation period as it was during the learning period; if NSI or NTSI &gt; 0, the rate of consumption of fluorescent polymer is greater during the evaluation<br><br>
