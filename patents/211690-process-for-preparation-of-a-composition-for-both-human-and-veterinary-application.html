				<td>Description<br>
Field of technology<br>
The invention relates to process for preparation of a compositions, comprising etheric oils extracted from specific plants, as well as to the application of said compositions in the human and veterinary medical field.<br>
Technical problems solved with this invention<br>
One of the technical problems that is solved with this invention is the obtainment of various types of human medicaments on the basis of active natural components that successfully replace prior art medicaments based on sulfonamids, antibiotics, cortisones etc., whereby the new products according to the invention:<br>
1. do not create biorecidives in the human body;<br>
2. do not generate resistance of microorganisms;<br>
3. are ecologically unsuspected; and<br>
4. are not toxic, mutagenic or teratogenic. Another problem that is solved with this invention is the<br>
obtainment of various types of veterinary medicaments on the basis of natural components, that successfully replace prior art products based on sulfonamids, antibiotics etc.. The application of the active substances according to the invention eliminates many unwanted effects caused by the prior art products like sulfonamids and antibiotics, such as:<br>
1. the presence of biorecidives in the meat and milk of animals treated with such products; and<br>
2. the aquirement of resistance of microorganisms-bacteria against the prior art products.<br>
Description of the prior art<br>
In the prior art known medicaments for curing human diseases like: cholera, colibacillosis, dermatomycosis, inflammation of the<br>
oral mucosa and pharynx, fungicidal and bacteriological infections, inflammation of the mucous membrane of the vagina, colitis, various etiologies, the treatment of festered wounds, are based on active substances that have an antibiotic, sulfonamid or hormonal corti-coidal origin.<br>
The tendencies of modern science are to substitute a part of the medicaments based on such origins by ecologically healthy drugs, which are much easier for the human organism to bear and have a much more beneficial influence on human health.<br>
The same counts for veterinary medicaments based on antibiotics , sulfonamids and even hormones for treating animal diseases such as cholera, different types of colibacillosis, dermatomycosis, inflammation of the udder, inflammation of the vagina and uterus, various etiologies and coccidiosis. In order to avoid the unwanted<br>
consequences mentioned above, it is necessary to have ecologically healthy and unsuspected products for treating above veterinary diseases.<br>
More in particular a great deal of the bacteria that cause the abovementioned diseases have developed a form of resistance<br>
against the prior art medicaments, so the products according to the invention resolve the problems of treating the diseases listed above, as well as various types of diarrhea, inflammation of the abdomen, gastritis, inflammation of the oral mucosa, inflammation of the ear, conjunctivitis, etc.<br>
In view of the above it is pointed yet at FR-A-2.706.770 disclosing a pharmaceutical composition against tuberculosis based on an imperative mixture of seven oils extracted from each of the following plants: Eucalyptus globules, melaleucn leucadendron. Thymus vulgaris, Humulus lupulus, Eugenia caryophylata, Mentha pioerita and Origanum vulgaris. However, not any further indication for the treatment of any other disease by means of said mixture of oils or any component thereof is indicated in FR-A-2.706.770.<br>
Further it is referred to Annales Pharmaceutiques Francaises, vol.43.no.1, 1985. 77-81. merely showing the fungicidal activity of forty plant extracts against none fungal species per se. However, there is no indication that said plant extracts would be used as pharmaceutical compositions in the human and veterinary field, in particular for any of the above mentioned diseases and disorders.<br>
Description of the solution to the above-described problem.<br>
The primary component which is applied in the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions according to the invention is etheric oil obtained from any of the following plants: Origanum vulgaris, Thymus vulgaris,<br>
Mentha piperita, Thymus serpilum, Saturea hortensis, Saturea montana, Saturea subricata, Carum corticum, Thymus zugis, Ocimum gratisimum, Moranda pungtata, Mosla japanoica and Salvia offici-nalis. Preferably the etheric oil is obtained from any of the following plants: Origanum vulgaris, Thymus vulgaris and Mentha piperita. Most preferably the etheric oil is at least obtained from Origanum vulgaris and optionally from Thymus vulgaris.<br>
In case of veterinary medicaments it is also possible to use synthetic thymol having the chemical name isopropylcresol. Further the compound tannin may be used in veterinary compositions. This tannin can be recovered by extracting the residu of the leaves and blossoms of the Origanum vulgaris plants obtained after the etheric oil-distillation (see below).<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, preferably of natural origin. Representatives of such carriers are generally known in the human and veterinary pharmaceutical field. Examples of such<br>
carriers are lactose, honey, laurel, vaselin, paraffin, starch products, calcium carbonate, etc.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may have any form suitable for its application, for instance the form of a capsule, syrup, tincture, ointment, powder, emulsion, paste, etc.<br>
The content of active agent in the pharmaceutical compositions , which in fact does also depend on its pharmaceutical use, may vary between wide limits. Preferably the active agent is present in an amount of 1-15% by weight, most preferably 4-10% by weight, calculated on the total<br>
weight of the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
Further to the active agent according to the invention also other active substances, preferably of natural origin, can be used. Such substances may have bacteriological, fungicidal, adstrigidic etc. properties.<br>
The following dosage of a pharmaceutical composition, comprising 5% by weight of oil from Origano vulgaris and 95% by<br>
weight of calcium carbonate in powder form may be applied for mass and individual treatment:<br>
A) Mass treatment: Preventive dose: pigs, rabbits, calves: 500 g of powder per ton of feed<br>
chickens, ducks, turkies: 450 g of powder per ton of feed<br>
Therapeutical dose:<br>
pigs, rabbits, calves:<br>
1000 g of powder per ton of feed<br>
chickens, ducks, turkies: 900 g of powder per ton of feed for 7-10 days of therapy.<br>
B) Individual treatment:<br>
calves, foals:<br>
0.20 - 0.25 g per kg of body weight<br>
piglets, lambs, kids:<br>
0,10 g per kg of body weight<br>

be used for the conservation of food for humans and for the conservation of feed for animals and do prolong the storage life of such products.<br>
A process for extracting the etheric oils from the above mentioned plants, in particular Origanum vulgaris, Thymus vulgaris and Mentha piperita is carried out by distillation with the help of water vapour (steam).<br>
Firstly, the leaves and blossoms of the plants, which must be dry, are placed in a distiller. In case of human application of the oils obtained, the distillation of the oil from every type of plants is done separately, which means that different types of plants must not be mixed together in the process of distillation. The distiller should have two output tubes: one for the oil and one for the water vapour (steam). The dish for the water is<br>
placed under the dry parts of the plant (the leaves and blossoms) and heated up to 100°C, preferably under a pressure of about 20 bar as an increased pressure will reduce the distillation time. The water vapour passes through the dry parts of the plant, thereby creating oil drops. The drops of water vapour are lighter than the oil drops, hence flow out the output tube at the bottom of the extractor. The drops of oil flow out the output tube for the oil and into the dish intended for the oil. This process is carried out for 3 hours. The yield is 3-6 kg of oil from 100 kg of dry plants. In general the extracted oil contains a certain percentage of tymol and carvacrol: approx. 3% of tymol and 60-70% of carvacrol. After the above-described distillation, the residue of the leaves and blossoms is used to extract tannin, which can be added to, in particular, veterinary pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
More in particular the procedure for obtaining etheric oils from Origanum vulgaris plants consists of four phases:<br>
Phase 1: Selection<br>
On the basis of the existing types of Origanum vulgaris plants it has been possible to obtain seeds of Origanum vulgaris plants having about 31% active material: 86-88% carvacrol and 3~5% thymol. The remnant 8-10% does comprise the following components:<br>
linalol, barneol, cimen and some other less important components.<br>
Phase 2: Production of the plants<br>
The seeds obtained in the way according to phase 1 are planted in fine loose soil, preferably in a sub-tropical climate. During this process all agro-technical measures are applied, like watering and artificial fertilizing.<br>
From the already grown plants, only their leaves and blossoms should be used. The reaping should be undertaken while the plants are in blossom early in the morning or late in the evening hours.<br>
Phase 3: Drying of the leaves and blossoms<br>
The drying process is performed in special rooms, i.e. drying houses. The already harvested leaves and blossoms should not be exposed to direct sunlight since any exposure to sunlight significantly decreases the percentage of active material.<br>
The leaves and blossoms are arranged in layers of 20-25 cm thick. During the first three days, these layers should be turned up-side-down four times a day, either manually or mechanically, so that this drying process is proceeded in an uniform way.<br>
These drying houses are constructed in such a way, that the air is able to circulate freely all the time. The drying process lasts about 7~8 days.<br>
Phase 4: Production of the oil<br>
From the dried leaves and blossoms of the plants, a distillation of<br>
the oil is carried out on the basis of a classic steam distillation.<br>
Out of 100 kilos of dried leaves and blossoms 5~7 kilos of oil are<br>
obtained.<br>
After the distillation step according to which the oil has<br>
been obtained, the following step is carried out:<br>
the oil is heated at 187°C, during which process, again performed in<br>
the distillator, the substances, which are of no importance are<br>
evaporated. The remnants are the important substances: carvacrol 86-<br>
88#; thymol 3~5% and in minor quantities: pinene, barneol, linalool<br>
etc.<br>
After this redistillation process, the oil is left to cool to<br>
room temperature and is then packed in hermetically closed vessels made of aluminum or dark glass.<br>
The invention will be elucidated by the following series of examples, i.e. (A) examples concerning the compositions and preparation of human pharmaceutical medicaments, (B) examples concerning the compositions and preparation of veterinary pharmaceutical medicaments, (C) examples concerning the activity of pharmaceutical medicaments according to the invention and (D) examples concerning the safety of pharmaceutical medicaments according to the invention.

C) EXAMPLES CONCERNING THE ACTIVITY OF VETERINARY PHARMACEUTICAL MEDICAMENTS ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION.<br>
Example 14<br>
Introduction<br>
Coccidiosis belongs to the most common acute diseases of the modern poultry upbringing. The disease is caused by monoxenous intercellular parasites from EimeTia species, from which patho genecity depends the state of the disease and mortality level. Aiming for prevention and eradication of the coccidia today many chemotherapeutics are being used, but there appears to be a problem with the resistance of these parasites to them, especially if used inadequate and without changes. For this reason, it has been started to achieve immune protection of the poultry (vaccines) by means of a preparation according to the invention composed of 5% by weight of Origanum vulgaris oil and 95% by weight of CaC03 and indicated below as "preparation A".<br>
Materials and methods of work.<br>
The tests have been done on 75 chickens of the "Hybro" species. The chickens were grown on one mini-farm, with floor system and fed by standard concentrate "ad libidum". At the beginning of the test they have been separated in three groups of 25 animals each.<br>
Group A: In 25 chickens one day old, preparation A has been added to the food as a prevention dose, which is 0.25 gr/kg of food within 7 days. After 7th day, there has been found an infection by 35 oocysts of E.Tenella and E.Acervulima. After the infection there has been an observation of the chickens up to 28 days with regular examination of excrement. After 28th day, the chickens are<br><br>
sacrificed and examined for its parasitology section, together with the examination of the excrement.<br>
Group B: Within this group of chickens, 25 chickens were given concentrate without coccistatics and test-preparation A. After 7th day the infection by oocysts E.Tenella and E.Acervulina has appeared. The same day preparation A has been mixed with the food of the animals in a concentration of 0.5 gr/kg of food. The chickens have been fed by food mixed this way for seven days, and after this, performed the observation followed by regular parasitology examination started at the moment of the detection of the infection. After 28th day, the chickens are sacrificed and examined for its parasitology section, together with the examination of the excrement.<br>
Group C: In this group counting 25 chickens, animals were fed 7 days with pure food, and after 7th day there has appeared an oocyst of E.Tenella and E.AceTVulina infection. After clinically manifested disease (7th day after infection) their food with mixed concentrate and preparation A has started, in a concentration of 0.5 gr/kg of food. The treatment lasted for 7 days while regular parasitology examination have been performed, lasting until 28 days old chickens, when sacrificed, examined for its parasitology section, together with the examination of the excrement.<br>
The infection of the poultry has been obtained by tetrenic isolates of oocysts of E.Tenella. and E". Acervulina, which after standard application and examination of the sporulation have been given to each individual chicken in doses of lxlO5 oocysts. The examination have been performed by standard parasitology methods given by Johnson J. and Reid W . M . , 1970, Anticoccidial drugs: lesion scorion technique in battery and floar pen experiments with chickens, Exp.Parasitol. 28, 30-36. The examination have been done first day after moving in the chickens, and after their infection in two days intervals during complete test.<br>
The results of tests and discussion.<br>
By examination done the first day after moving in of the<br><br>
poultry, there has not been found a parasite infection in the animals. After the infection the examination have been performed in two days intervals, in all three experiment groups, In groups A and B while experimented, there have not been noticed the coccidia in excrement. In group C the sixth day after infection the clinical symptoms of coccidiosis have been noticed (diarrhea, characteristic behaviour . . .) as well as presence of oocysts of coccidia in the excrement. Second day after treatment, the diarrhea has stopped but in the excrement there could still be found the oocysts of coccidia.<br>
On the fourth day the number of oocysts has significantly lowered and during next controls it has dropped to a minimum. The clinical picture of the disease has stopped after the fifth day of the treatment. There have not been any chicken dead. After sacrifice of the chickens the parasitology section, together with the examination of the excrement have been performed by method of Johnson and Reid (1970), loc.cit. In groups A and B they have not been noticed while in group C they were not significantly important (level +1 according to this scale, never more than this).<br>
Based on preliminary examination it can be concluded that the application of the preparation A can be used for coccidiosis of the poultry and have been efficient in preventive and therapy effect. Having in mind that the preparation contains 5% of ethereal oil of Origanum vulgaris flower and leaf, which has healing effect on the intestinal tract and probably is this fact the reason for the absence of changes in digestive tract of infected poultry clinically found before the application of the therapy. Within this group, the quick recovery has been noticed and they have developed normally. It has been noticed that poultry has normally taken the medicated food and that the strong smell of oregano has been absorbed in the food normally and therefore kept unnoticed. The powder is a better form for homogenization in concentration-form for the poultry. While the experiment was lasting, it has been taken care of the fact that poultry got all food ad libidum, and that the micro-climate in the object moved between optimal limits for this kind of production and that optimal space was provided for the animals.<br><br>
Conclusion:<br>
Based on performed experiment using preparation A for use of the prevention and eradication of coccidiosis in chickens upbringing we can conclude the following:<br>
- The preparation in the concentration of 0,25 gr/kg of food can be successfully used in prevention of this disease. The preparation should be used by adding it to the food within 7 days; The preparation in the concentration of 0,50 gr/kg of food can be successfully used during the beginning and clinically<br>
manifested form of coccidiosis. Therapy should be applied for 7 days; The preparation mixes easily with the food. The smell of the preparation is strong, specific-oregano, but in the food it can not be tasted. Chickens eat normally food with mixed preparation in it; In treated chickens there were no side effects noticed as a consequence of the application of this preparation; The preparation can be applied both for preventive or therapeutical use, and also for other diseases of poultry.<br>
Example 15<br>
Introduction<br>
As brought up in example Ik, coccidiosis belongs to the most common parasitic diseases of poultry, for instance pheasants in intensive upbringing. The most common clinically manifested disease appears in pheasants aged 4-6 weeks, causing significant losses to this production. The eradication of the coccidiosis-prevention and therapy is analogue to the poultry production with the application of identical therapeutics. Problem of the resistance to it is present in this case as well. For these reasons the testing of the preventive and therapeutical effect of the preparation A (defined in example 14) has been done and obtained results have shown significant efficiency of this preparation used in this test.<br><br>
Materials and methods of work.<br>
The tests have been done on pheasants 3-6 weeks old, bearing in mind that coccidiosis in clinically manifested form appears in pheasants 4-6 weeks old. Based on dynamics of the production in the pheasant farm, every group of the birds counts approximately 2000 animals. The experiment has been performed on three groups.<br>
Group A: On pheasants three weeks old, after performed parasitologic examination, in which no infection of cocci was found, preparation A has been added to the food. For prevention purposes,the preparation has been given in a concentration of 0,25 gr/kg of foods seven days in a row.<br>
Group B: Within this group of pheasants, 24 days old, in abduction has been found the beginning stadium of the cocci infection. The estimation of the infection degree is being observed through the number of cocci and pathological changes in intestines. Determination of the causer-species is done based on their morphological characteristics. After diagnosis the therapy doses of preparation A has been given in a concentration of 0.5 gr/kg of foods seven days in a row.<br>
Group C: In this group the spring pheasants 4 weeks old, have clearly shown clinical symptoms of the disease. Characteristic behaviour of the birds and diarrhea were obvious in this group. Noticed there were hemoragical enteritis, which mycosis corks in cecum. The death of the pheasants was within the limits of 50-60 birds daily. The therapy of preparation A has been applied in concentration of 0,5 gr/kg of food.<br>
Diagnosis of coccidiosis has been made by taking samples of excrement and its examination by standard parasitology methods. The smear of the mucous membrane has been done from the changed areas on intestines of the diseased pheasants. The estimation of extensivity and intensity of the infection has been done by counting oocysts of cocci, and based on degree of pathological changes. Determination is obtained based on morphological characteristics of the parasites by<br><br>
means of the Norton method (1981). THE RESULTS OF TESTS AND DISCUSSION<br>
Group A: Coccidiostatic effect of the preparation A has been completely successful. During the observance of the animals for three weeks of this group of pheasants (ending 6th week) there were no cases of the presence of cocci. In obduction there were no parasite elements found (oocysts of cocci). Pheasants have normally developed, and the degree of mortality was below technological range anticipated for this production (in average 1<br>
Group B: Within this group of pheasants the beginning infection has been diagnosed, caused by E.Duodenalis and E.Colchici.<br>
The degree of the mortality was within technological limits, but the indication symptoms of the infection have been noticed. After 7~days therapy the symptoms have completely disappeared and in obduction of died and sacrificed animals there were no pathological changes in intestines and coccum, characteristic for coccidiosis. The<br>
examinations of the smear of mucous membrane have shown that the disease has not developed.<br>
Group C: This group had present coccidiosis in clinical range followed by mortality of 2.5%. Infection has been caused by E.Duodenalis and E.Colchici. Therapy has been applied for 7 days. During the first three days the mortality has been significantly decreased, while after finished therapy coccidiosis has been eradicated completely. This has been approved by obduction and para-sitology examination of the sacrificed and died pheasants.<br>
In both groups (B and C) where the infection has been noticed, after therapy there has been an important and significant approval in conditional and healthy state of the birds. Following the development of these birds for next weeks, it has been noticed that vitality and development is within optimal range for this species. Estimation and following of the mortality of the birds has been made difficult by getting the weather conditions worse (severe drop in<br><br>
temperature, heavy rains followed by wind), so that in second week of the observations a slight increase of mortality has appeared, but based on section of died animals (72 from B group, 61 from C group, and 60 from A group) and parasitology examination of died animals 5 and group excrement from experimental groups there was no cocci-diosis found.<br>
Conclusion:<br>
Based on performed experiments using preparation A for use of the prevention and eradication of coccisiosis in pheasant game birds in intensive upbringing we can conclude the following:<br>
The preparation in the concentration of 0,25 Er/kg of food can be successfully used in prevention of this disease. The preparation should be used by adding it to the food within 7 days;<br>
The preparation in the concentration of 0,50 gr/kg of food can be successfully used during the beginning and clinically manifested form of coccidiosis. Therapy should be applied for 7 days; The preparation mixes easily with the food. The smell of the preparation is strong, specif ic-oregano, but in the food it cannot be tasted. Pheasants eat normally food with mixed preparation in it;<br>
In treated pheasants there were no side effects noticed as a consequence of the application of this preparation;<br>
- The preparation can be applied both for preventive or therapeutical use, for the diseases of bacteridical or mycological ethiology of game birds. Based on shown coccidiostatic effect it may be applied for this use, like with application of other coccidiostatics (from third to eight week of upbringing).<br>
D) EXAMPLES CONCERNING THE SAVETY OF VETERINARY PHARMACEUTICAL<br>
MEDICAMENTS ACCORDING TO THE INVENTION.<br>
Example 16<br>
1. Introduction<br>
In this example a study is carried out to get more<br><br>
information about the safety of pharmaceutical compositions comprising etheric oil of origanum vulgaris (oregano oil) in broiler chicks. For this purpose two dietry levels were included in the trial: the normal recommended dose level of 250 ppm oregano oil and a dose level 10 times the recommended level (2,500 ppm of oregano oil). The latter dose level is generally used for testing the safety of products in order to apply for EU-registration referring to Council directive (COM C93 113) and Council decision (COM (.93) 114) . As a reference product, a commercially used antibiotic (virginiamycin; 20 ppm) was included in the trial. Birds were housed in battery cages for a period of 3A days. The criteria studied were weight gain, feed intake, feed conversion efficiency, water intake and general state of health.<br>
2. Experimental procedure 2.1 Experimental groups<br>
The following four experimental groups were involved in the trial:<br>
Each experimental group consisted of 90 chicks, six replicate cages with each 15 female birds.<br>
2.2 Animals<br>
A normal broiler cross ("Ross") was used. At the time of arrival at the institute, 460 one day old female birds were divided at random among 24 cages. During the pre-test period of 5 days all birds were fed a standard diet. At an age of 5 days 360 birds were<br><br>
selected and divided at random among the experimental groups according to body weight. The allocation was done in such a way as to obtain within each group two cages with 15 birds of an average body weight of 114 g, two with an average body weight of 107 g, and 5 two with an average body weight of 102 g. After allocation the chickens were fed the experimental diets for 29 days (age period 5~ 34 days).<br>
2.3 Variations 10<br>
The birds were vaccinated for Newcastle disease (according to the spray method) at an age of one and fourteen days.<br>
2 A Housing<br>
The birds were housed in battery cages, situated in an artificially heated, ventilated and lighted broiler house. The broiler house involved 12 cages. The floor space of each cage was 0.98 square metres with wire floors. Each cage was provided with an auto matic water supplier and a feed trough. Per cage, 15 birds were housed. The broiler house was illuminated 24 hours a day. During the experimental period, the light intensity was gradually reduced. The temperature in the broiler unit was gradually reduced from 28°C during the first week to 23°C during the last days of the experiment. The humidity in the broiler unit was approximately 55% during the experimental period.<br>
2 . 5 Diets<br>
For the experiment one batch of feedstuffs were used. The composition of the basic diet is presented in Table B. No coccidio-stat was added to the diets.<br>
The experimental diets were prepared at a feed mixing plant. The basal diet of the experimental groups was mixed as one batch for<br>
all groups. The experimental diets were then prepared by splitting up this batch into four batches to which the required amount of feed additives were added, and mixed. Next the diets were pelleted (2.5<br><br>
mm) without the addition of steam. The pelleting temperature, measured after the pellets left the press, was approximately 54°C. The basal diet was analysed for the content of crude protein, Ca and P.<br>
The diets were fed ad libitum. Water was also available ad libitum via an automatic device.<br><br>
* Supplied per kg diet: riboflavin, 4 mg; niacinamide, 40 mg; d-pantothenic acid, 12 mg; choline-chloride, 500 mg; cobalamin, 15 ug; Dl-a-tocopheryl acetate, 15 mg; menadione 5 nig; retinyl-acetate, 3-^ mg5 cholecalciferol, 50 pg; biotin, 0.1 mg; 5 folic acid, 0.75 mg;<br>
FeS04.7H20, 300 mg; MnO2, 100 mg; CuSO/, .5H20, 100 mg; ZnSOi, .H20, 150 mg; Na2Se03. 0.15 mg; KI, 5 mg; CoSOi, .7H20, 1 mg; antioxidant (ethoxyguin) , 100 mg; and 20 mg virginiamycin in phase 2.<br>
** Apparent faecal digestible amino acids. () Analysed contents<br>
3. Criteria studied<br>
Individual body weight after an experimental period of 14 and 29<br>
days.<br>
Feed consumption for each replicate of 15 birds, at each time of<br>
weighing.<br>
Feed conversion efficiency, calculated as kg feed consumed/kg weight gain, at each time of weighing. The data for feed consumption and conversion efficiency were corrected for the estimated amount of feed consumed by birds which died during the experimental period.<br>
- Water consumption and feed intake for each replicate of 15 birds, during one period of four days (24-28 days of age). Mortality rate, and general state of health.<br>
4. Statistical analysys<br>
The results for weight gain, feed conversion efficiency, feed intake and water consumption were analysed statistically. Results for weight gain, daily feed intake, and feed conversion efficiency are corrected for sex errors and "outliers". Differences among experimental groups were tested for significance by analysis of variance followed by the Least Significance Difference test (Snedecor and Cochran, 1980). The computer program SPSS/PC+ V5.0 (Norusis, 1992) was used to calculate the analysis of variance. All statements of significance are based on a probability of P = 0.05-<br>
5. Conclusion<br>
The results for weight gain, daily feed intake, and feed conversion efficiency at 14 and 29 days experimental period are presented in Tables C and D. Supplementation of either 250 or 2,500 ppm of oregano oil to the diet had hardly any effect on weight gain and feed conversion efficiency after 14 and 29 days experimental period. Virginiamycin when added to the diet tended to improve weight gain and feed conversion efficiency after 14 days experimental period, whereas hardly any effect on broiler performance was obtained after 29 days experimental period. The results for water intake and water/feed ratio are presented in Table E. Inclusion of either 250 and 2,500 ppm of oregano oil, or 20 ppm virginiamycin in the diet had hardly any effect of daily water intake and water/feed ratio.<br>
Mortality rate was low, 1A% (= 5 animals) , with no appreciable differences among the treatment groups. In addition, no abnormalities regarding the health status were observed during the trial. The low mortality rate obtained during the present trial indicates that the animals were in good health condition. This good health condition of the birds in the present study may explain the fact that hardly any effect of virginiamycin on broiler performance was observed, whereas normally an improvement in feed conversion efficiency is observed. Based on the results of the present study it can be concluded that oregano oil has no negative or detrimental effect on performance of healthy broiler chicks when supplemented 10 times the recommended level.<br>
