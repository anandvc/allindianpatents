This invention relates to a process of preparing anti-obesity beverages<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Consumption of alcoholic beverages like bottom fermented bears, such as pilsner, dortmund and munich bears, top-fermented bears such as ale, porter, stout and Iambic, root bears, alcohol free bears, wine, ciders and other alcoholic beverages from fruits are associated with an increase in the calorie intake and thereby increases the weight of the person.<br>
Since the public drinking alcoholic beverages are calorie conscious the object of this invention is to prepare a slim (low calorie) beverage which will not increase the weight of a person and at the same time maintain the taste of the beverages.<br>
To achieve the said objective, this invention provides a process of preparing anti-obesity beverages of the kind as herein described containing 0-15 wt% alcohol, comprising mixing the said beverage with soluble double metal salt of group lA and group IIA of hydroxycitric acid or its isomers in the proportion 0.1-0.5 w/v, wherein this addition could be at any stage in the manufacture of the said beverage.<br>
The soluble double metal salt of group lA and group IIA metals of hydroxycitric acid or its isomers in the range 0.1-0.5 % is added to beer having alcohol content 2.0-4.0 wt%.<br>
The soluble double metal salt of group lA and group IIA metals of hydroxycitric acid or its isomers in the range 0.1-0.5 % is added to beer having alcohol content 2.0-5.0 wt%.<br>
The soluble double metal salt of group lA &amp; IIA of hydroxycitric acid or its isomers in the range 0.1-0.5 % is added to beer having alcohol content 5.0-6.5 wt%.<br>
The beer having an alcoholic content of 2.0- -4.0 wt % is either "Pilsner" or "Dortmund" beer.<br>
The beer having an alcoholic content of 2.0- -5.0 wt % is either "Munich" or "Ale" or "Porter" beer.<br>
The beer having an alcoholic content of 5.0- -6.5  wt %  is  "Stouf or "Dortmund" beer.<br><br>
The beer having an alcoholic content of 0-15.0 wt % is "Lager" beer.<br>
The soluble double metal salt of group lA and group IIA metals of hydroxycitric acid or its isomers in the range 0.1-0.5 % is added to other beverages as described below having an alcohol content 0-15 wt%.<br>
Pilsner, dortmund, munich bears are prepared by known bottom fermentation process and are either lagered for maturation or ready for consumption.<br>
Ale, stout, porter bears are prepared by known top fermentation process and are either lagered for maturation or ready for consumption.<br>
Other beverages could be originated from grape juice or other fruit juice with or without the action of microbial fermenting agents resulting in wines, ciders and other similar beverages of 0-15 wt% alcohol or from fermentation of grains in their germinated or native form with or without the addition of natural or artificial additives or water resulting in 0-15 wt% alcohol either stored for maturation or ready for consumption.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the following examples:<br>
EXAMPLE 1:<br>
Preparation of a lager beer with the anti-obesity agent hydroxycitric acid.<br>
Soluble double metal salt of group lA &amp; IIA of (-) hydroxycitric acid 0.1 - 0.5 % was added to a bottom fermented and matured lager beer containing 3.5 wt% alcohol. This beer was periodically analyzed for its characteristic. It was observed that there were no perceptible changes in its physical or sensory characteristics. It was also observed that the concentration of hydroxycifric acid was constant over a period of six months.<br>
EXAMPLE 2:<br>
Preparation of anti-obesity beverages from Pilsner, dortmund and munich<br>
manufactured by bottom fermentation process<br><br>
Bottom fermented bears Pilsner contains 2.0-4.0 wt% of alcohol which is lagered for 2-3 months. The soluble double metal salts formed from group lA or group IIA metals of hydroxycitric acid or soluble sodium calcium salt of hydroxycitric acid is added in the pilsner bear in the range 0.1-0.5 %, preferably in the range 0.25 - 4.0, to get the desired product.<br>
Similarly, to dortmund which is a paler bear than Pilsner contains alcohol 2.0-4.0 wt% soluble double metal salts formed from group lA or group IIA metals of hydroxycitric acid or soluble sodium calcium salt of hydroxycitric acid or its isomer is added in the range 0.1-0.5 %, preferably 0.25 - 0.40 to get the desired product.<br>
For the mildly hopped, slightly sweet taste Munich bears which generally contains alcohol between 2.5-5.0 wt% soluble double metal salts formed from group lA or group IIA metals of hydroxycitric acid or soluble sodium calcium salt of hydroxycitric acid or its isomers is added in the range of 0.1-0.5%, preferably in the range of 0.25 - 0.40.<br>
EXAMPLE 3:<br>
Preparation of slim beverages from Ale, Porter and Stout manufactured by top fermentation process.<br>
For the top fermented bears like Ale contains 2-5 % alcohol. The free hydroxycitric acid or its isomers or soluble salts formed from group LA or group IIA metals of hydroxycitric acid or soluble sodium calcium salt of hydroxycitric acid is added in the range 0.1-0.5 %, preferably 0.25-0.40 to get the desired beverage.<br>
For the porter which is characterized by heavy foam, hoppy and slightly sweeter bear than ale contains 2-5 wt% alcohol, the free hydroxycitric acid is added in the range 0.1-0.5 % to get the desired beverage.<br>
The Stout bear is a very dark bear with a sweet slightly burned taste and having a small malt flavour containing 5.0-6.5 wt% alcohol. In this beer soluble salts formed from group lA or IIA metals of hydroxycitric acid or soluble sodium calcium salt of hydroxycitric acid or its isomers is added in the range 0.1-0.5 %.<br><br><br>
We claim ;<br>
1.	A process of preparing anti-obesity beverages containing 0-15 wt% alcohol of the kind as herein described  comprising mixing the said beverage with soluble double metal salt of group lA and group IIA of hydroxycitric acid or its isomers in the proportion 0.1-0.5 w/v, wherein this addition could be at any stage in the manufacture of the said beverage.<br>
2.	A process as claimed in claim I wherein said beverage is beer having alcohol content 3.0- 3.8 % wt.<br>
3.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein said beverage is beer having alcohol content 2.5- 4.0 % wt.<br>
4.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein said beverage is beer having alcohol content 2.5- 5.0 % wt.<br><br>
6.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein said beverage is beer having alcohol content 2.0-5.0 % wt.<br>
7.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein said beverage is beer having alcohol content 5.0- 6.5% wt.<br>
8.	A process as claimed in claim I wherein said beverage has originated from grape juice or other fruit juice with or without the action of microbial fermenting agents resulting in wines, ciders and other similar beverages of 0-15 wt% alcohol.<br>
9.	A process as claimed in claim 1 wherein said beverage is prepared from fermentation of grains in their germinated or native form with or without the addition of natural or artificial additives or water resulting in 0-15 wt% alcohol.<br><br>
10. A process of preparing anti-obesity beverages containing 0-15 wt% alcohol substantially as herein described with reference to the foregoing examples.<br><br></td>
