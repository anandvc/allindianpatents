METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR OPERATING<br>
TRAVELING SPARK IGNITER AT HIGH PRESSURE<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit, under 35 USC 119(e) of prior US provisional<br>
patent application serial no. 60/672892, filed April 19,2005, having the same title and<br>
assignee, and which is incorporated by reference in its entirety herein.<br>
1.	Field of Invention<br>
This invention relates to the fields of plasma generation, ignitions, and internal<br>
combustion (IC) engines. In particular, it relates, but is not limited, to ignition methods<br>
and ignition apparatus for use therein; and, specifically, to ignition methods and<br>
apparatus for various applications, including but not limited to, high pressure engines.<br>
More particularly, some aspects relate to the delivery of discharge current to traveling<br>
spark igniters in order to maximize their performance and longevity, esceciallv in<br>
internal combustion engines operating at high pressures.<br>
2.	Discussion of Related Art<br>
For a variety of reasons, there is interest today in increasing the pressures in<br>
internal combustion engines and similar combustion environments, with a concomitant<br>
need for ignition sources capable of operating in these environments. For example,<br>
automobile companies and manufacturers of internal combustion engines would like to<br>
be able to provide vehicles which have IC engines which operate at much higher<br>
pressures than conventional internal combustion engines. To date, however, there has<br>
not been an effective and practical ignition system for such engines. Among other<br>
concerns are longevity of igniters (spark plugs) and reliability of igniter firing.<br>
The traveling spark igniter (TSI) is a device that has been discussed as a<br>
promising spark plug replacement for internal combustion engines, but previously not for<br>
high pressure engines. TSIs have, for example, been shown in a number of prior patents<br>
including, for example, U.S. Patents Nos. 6,321,733 and 6,474,321, both assigned to the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/113850<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2006/014840<br>
 <br>

same assignee as this invention and incorporated by reference in their entireties for their<br>
explanations of TSI devices and ignition systems.<br>
Briefly, a TSI-based ignition system provides a large plasma kernel which is<br>
propagated along the igniter's electrodes by Lorentz force (along with thermal forces, to<br>
lesser degrees) and propelled into a combustion chamber. The Lorentz force acting on<br>
the ignition kernel (i.e., plasma) is created by way of the discharge current in the plasma<br>
interacting with a magnetic field caused by that same current in the electrodes of the<br>
igniter. The magnitude of the Lorentz force is proportional to the square of that current.<br>
In engines operating at normal pressures (i.e., a maximum of about 120 psi), traveling<br>
spark igniters provide significant advantages over conventional spark plugs due to the<br>
large plasma volume they generate, typically some 100-200 times larger than in a<br>
conventional spark plug, for comparable discharge energy. Increased efficiency and<br>
reduced emissions are attainable.<br>
For higher engine operating pressures, however, the breakdown voltage required<br>
for initiating the discharge between the electrodes of the igniter is significantly higher<br>
than in engines operating at conventional pressures. This creates problems for TSIs, as<br>
for any spark plug. The electrodes in a TSI, as in a conventional spark plug, are<br>
maintained in a spaced apart relationship by a member called an isolator, which is<br>
formed of an insulating material such as a ceramic. The higher breakdown voltage<br>
causes problems for both the isolator and the electrodes.<br>
Along the surface of the isolator running between the electrodes, the breakdown<br>
voltage is lower than it is further along the electrodes in a TSI, or in any conventional<br>
spark plug with a similar gap between the electrodes. Indeed, this difference in<br>
breakdown voltages varies directly with increasing pressure in the combustion chamber.<br>
Consequently, although the breakdown voltage along the isolator surface increases with<br>
pressure, that increase is less than the increase in the breakdown voltage between the<br>
exposed part of the electrodes away from the isolator surface. When breakdown occurs<br>
(as a result of which the resistance through the plasma rapidly drops), the current rises<br>
rapidly and a very large current is conducted in the forming plasma along the isolator<br>
surface, thus giving rise to the Lorentz force acting on the plasma. Such rapidly rising<br>
current, though, creates not only a very high temperature plasma, but also a powerful<br>
shock wave in the vicinity of the surface of the isolator. The larger the current, the more<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/113850<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2006/014840<br>
 <br>
-3-<br>
rapid the plasma expansion and the resulting shock wave. These combined effects can<br>
cause deformation and/or breakage of the isolator.<br>
Additionally, the high current produces very rapid erosion of the electrodes in the<br>
vicinity of the isolator surface, where they are attacked by the high current, thermal<br>
heating and thermionic emission that results thereirom.<br>
Similar problems have been manifest with igniters based on the University of<br>
Texas "railplug" design which generates a Lorentz force in a plasma traveling along a<br>
high aspect ratio discharge gap (as contrasted with a TSI, which has a low aspect ratio<br>
discharge gap).<br>
Although both the railplug and the TSI generate significant plasma motion at<br>
relatively low pressures, when the combustion chamber pressure is increased to a high<br>
pressure, the plasma behaves differently and it is this difference in behavior that leads to<br>
unsatisfactory results. In a low pressure environment, the force exerted on the plasma by<br>
the pressure is relatively small. The plasma moves easily along the electrodes in<br>
response to the Lorentz force. As the ignition chamber pressure is increased, however,<br>
that pressure provides a force of significant magnitude that resists the Lorentz force and,<br>
thus, plasma motion. Consequently, the plasma tends to become more concentrated, and<br>
to collapse on itself; instead of having a diffused plasma cloud, a very localized plasma -<br>
an arc - is formed between the electrodes below a certain current threshold. This arc,<br>
though occupying a much smaller volume than the plasma cloud of the low-pressure<br>
case, receives similar energy. As a result, the current density is higher and at the<br>
electrodes, where the arc exists, there is a higher localized temperature and more power<br>
density at the arc-electrode interfaces. That is, the current density is quite high at those<br>
interfaces, producing more localized heating of the electrodes than in the low pressure<br>
environment. The localized heating of the electrodes, in turn, produces thermionic<br>
emission of electrons and ions. The observed effect is that the arc appears to "attach"<br>
itself at relatively fixed locations on the electrodes, producing erosion of the electrodes<br>
as the entire discharge energy is deposited at the "attachment point;" this is to be<br>
contrasted with the low pressure environment where a lower density, diffused area of<br>
plasma contact moves along the electrodes without significantly damaging them.<br>
Concurrently, the plasma, affected by the Lorentz and thermal forces, bows out<br>
from the arc attachment points. This causes the magnetic field lines to no longer be<br>
orthogonal to the current flow between the electrodes, reducing the magnitude of the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/113850<br>
 <br>
PCTAJS2006/014840<br>
 <br>
-4-<br>
Lorentz force produced by a given current. So, in addition to the other problems, there is<br>
a loss in motive force applied to the plasma.<br>
Overall, there is a reduction in plasma motion as compared with the lower<br>
pressure environments, and dramatically increased electrode wear at the arc attachment<br>
points.<br>
Accordingly, a variety of needs exist, including needs for plasma generators, in<br>
general, needs for improved ignition.systems, needs for ignition systems for use in<br>
internal combustion engines and needs for an ignition system and method which<br>
generates a large ignition kernel and which is usable with high pressure engines, and is<br>
commercially practical.<br>
If a traveling spark igniter is to be used in a high pressure combustion<br>
environment, a need further exists to overcome the above negative effects on the isolator<br>
material and electrodes of the igniter. See US Patents Nos. 5704321, 6131542, 6321733,<br>
6474321, 6662793, and 6553981, for example, incorporated by reference herein. That is,<br>
a need exists for an igniter and ignition system for use in high pressure combustion<br>
engines, wherein the isolator and electrodes exhibit substantial lifetimes (preferably<br>
comparable to that, of conventional spark plugs in low pressure engines) without being<br>
destroyed by the discharge process. Desirably, such a traveling spark igniter and ignition<br>
system will be usable and useful in internal combustion engines operating not only at<br>
high and very high pressures (i.e., several hundred psi), but also at lower, conventional<br>
pressures.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The above and other needs are addressed, and advantages provided, with a new<br>
method, and corresponding apparatus, for generating and smtaining a plasma, operating<br>
a traveling spark igniter and providing an ignition for internal combustion and other<br>
engines, particularly high pressure internal combustion engines. Typically, a high initial<br>
breakdown voltage is applied to the igniter to initiate a plasma kernel in a plasma<br>
initiation region of the igniter, but preferably at a current lower than that previously<br>
employed with TSI ignitions, as the breakdown current need not produce a large Lorentz<br>
force. After the breakdown current pulse, various mechanisms may be employed to<br>
prolong the plasma while recombination is occurring and to allow the plasma to become<br>

easily detached (or detachable) from the the initiation region (typically, on or adjacent<br>
the surface of an isolator between the igniter electrodes. Before the plasma has a chance<br>
to recombine completely, the current is turned on again to provide a short follow-on<br>
pulse of energy (preferably at a current substantially less than that of the breakdown<br>
pulse). The follow-on current pulse generates a corresponding pulse of Lorentz force to<br>
move the plasma away from its previous location, further along the electrodes of the<br>
igniter. A number of such follow-on pulses may be provided, with an "off' interval<br>
between successive pulses, during which interval one or more mechanisms prolong the<br>
plasma and allow only partial recombination of the plasma. This is called "simmering."<br>
Prior to total recombination of the plasma, the next follow-on pulse of current "kicks"<br>
the plasma even further along the electrodes; and the final follow-on pulse ejects the<br>
plasma from the electrodes. One mechanism for producing simmering is to reduce the<br>
current through the igniter to a relatively low (but non-zero) level, called a "simmer<br>
current." Alternatively, if a summer current is not applied, similar effects may be<br>
obtained by using any of a number of other techniques for prolonging recombination and<br>
preventing "total" recombination of the plasma kernel by the time the next follow-on<br>
pulse arrives. For example, the follow-on pulses may be timed and possibly even<br>
waveform-shaped to more closely follow each other so that only partial recombination<br>
occurs between pulses; or each follow-on pulse may be preceded by a high sub-<br>
breakdown voltage; or the plasma may be excited by RF or laser energy. That is,<br>
numerous ways are contemplated of preventing toal plasma recombination. By "total" in<br>
reference to recombination is meant that the plasma effectively has been extinguished<br>
and high energy is needed to reignite it.<br>
The invention is manifested in several ways, or aspects, and example<br>
implementations are presented below. Other ways of practicing the invention will<br>
become apparent to those skilled in the art. The various aspects may be practiced alone<br>
or in any of many combinations, all of which cannot be reasonably enumerated here. It<br>
is intended that features of various embodiments be practiced in combinations other than<br>
those illustrated, not all features being shown in connection with all embodiments, for<br>
brevity.<br>

region, and formation of a plasma kernel adjacent said initiation region; and following<br>

said follow-on current pulses preferably may have an average duration of less than about<br>
200 microseconds, which may not be uniform. The follow-on pulses may have an<br>
amplitude of about 10-5000 V and preferably about 20-275 V. The follow-on pulses<br>
need not all have the same polarity of voltage and current and the currents of the follow-<br>
on pulses need not be constant.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Herein are explained in greater detail numerous aspects of the invention; the<br>
problems addressed by the invention, in greater detail than above; and a single<br>
embodiment of an example of an ignition circuit for practicing aspects of the invention.<br>
According to a first aspect, there will be shown a method of operating an igniter<br>
in an internal combustion engine, comprising: applying a high voltage to electrodes of<br>
the igniter, said high voltage being of amplitude sufficient to cause electrical discharge<br>
breakdown to occur between the electrodes, in an initiation region (e.g., over a surface of<br>
an isolator) between the electrodes, resulting in a high current electrical discharge in the<br>
igniter, and formation of a plasma kernel in an air or fuel-air mixture adjacent said<br>
surface; and following breakdown, applying to said electrodes (preferably a simmer<br>
current) and a sequence of one or more lower voltage and lower current pulses, whereby<br>
the plasma kernel is forced to move toward a free end of said electrodes by said lower<br>
voltage, lower current pulses.<br>
Between breakdown and a first pulse of the sequence, and between pulses of the<br>
sequence, a current desirably is maintained through the plasma kernel sufficient to<br>
prevent total recombination of the plasma. Alternatively, such a current need not be<br>
maintained, if the intervals between breakdown and the first pulse of the sequence, and<br>
between additional follow-on pulses of the sequence, are sufficiently short, such that<br>
total recombination does not occur prior to the start of such pulses . (If total<br>
recombination occurs, then.a high breakdown voltage is needed to restart the plasma<br>
formation process.) If total recombination is avoided (no matter how) before the start of a<br>
follow-on pulse, the follow-on pulse can be a relatively low current pulse (compared to a<br>
number of previous approaches, but still appreciable) and it will still provide a suitable<br>
 <br>

 <br>

Lorentz force to advance the plasma, and it will, itself, create a current arc that can move<br>
along the electrodes. As another alternative, recombination can be slowed by imposing a<br>
relatively high (but less than breakdown) voltage across the electrodes prior to the start<br>
of a follow-on pulse. All three mechanisms facilitate the establishment of a moving<br>
plasma kernel without requiring re-generation of a high energy breakdown condition,<br>
reducing the tendency of the current path to "re-attach" to the electrodes at fixed<br>
locations. The number of follow-on pulses varying according to design requirements<br>
and/or operating conditions.<br>
The igniter is preferably a traveling spark igniter.<br>
Desirably, a first pulse of the sequence follows the breakdown discharge by an<br>
interval of from about 2 to about 100 microseconds, preferably from about 10 to about<br>
20 microseconds, but this will depend on the recombination time for a plasma in the<br>
particular kind of fuel mixture being employed. Desirably, each of said follow-on pulses<br>
has a maximum amplitude of about 5 - 200 Amperes. But the amplitudes need not be<br>
uniform. Preferably, said lower voltage, lower current pulses have a maximum<br>
amplitude of about 25-105 Amperes, and more preferably about 40-80 Amperes. The<br>
pulses may have a duration of from about 2 to about 200 microseconds. Successive<br>
pulses in said sequence preferably are separated by intervals of about 10-500<br>
microseconds and even more preferably, 40-120 microseconds, but the intervals may not<br>
be uniform. In terms of voltage, each of said pulses typically may have an amplitude of<br>
about 50-5000 V and, more preferably, about 300-500 V. All pulses need not have the<br>
same polarity of voltage or current; and neither the voltage nor the current in a pulse<br>
need be constant. The foregoing numbers are all representative only and are not intended<br>
to reflect any inherent limits on the invention. Other ranges may be employed in<br>
appropriate embodiments. These numbers may be useful, though, as an aid to<br>
identifying differences with other ignition systems and methods.<br>
The invention is intended for use in high pressure engines, but is not so limited.<br>
According to a related aspect, an ignition circuit is provided for powering an<br>
igniter in an internal combustion engine, the circuit comprising means for providing a<br>
high voltage capable of causing a breakdown discharge, at a relatively high current (but<br>
preferably lower than prior TST ignitions have used), between electrodes of an igniter,<br>
and in an initiation region (e.g., on or over a surface of an isolator which separates the<br>
electrodes), when said igniter is disposed in a fuel-air mixture, whereby a plasma kernel<br>
 <br>

 <br>
PCT7US2006/014840<br>

is formed adjacent said surface by said discharge; and means for providing a sequence of<br>
one or more relatively lower voltage and lower current follow-on pulses having voltage<br>
and current amplitude and tirning sufficient to create Lorentz force pulses causing the<br>
plasma kernel to move toward a free end of said electrodes by said follow-on pulses.<br>
The means for providing a high voltage capable of causing breakdown may include a<br>
high voltage, low inductance ignition coil having a primary winding and a secondary<br>
winding, the secondary winding having a lead for connection to one electrode of an<br>
igniter, and a circuit for triggering a signal in the primary winding to induce a high<br>
voltage pulse in the secondary winding.<br>
The means for providing a sequence of relatively lower voltage (i.e., sub-<br>
breakdown voltage) pulses may comprise a low voltage source and, for each said pulse, a<br>
capacitor charged by the low voltage source and a pulse transformer having a first<br>
winding connected to said lead and a second winding through which the capacitor is<br>
discharged in response to a trigger signal, inducing said pulse in said lead. The ignition<br>
circuit may further include means for providing to the igniter, in an interval between the<br>
breakdown discharge and a first lower voltage pulse a simmer current sufficient to<br>
prevent total recombination of the plasma kernel in said interval. It also may include<br>
means for providing to the igniter, in an interval between successive follow-on pulses a<br>
simmer current sufficient to prevent total recombination of the plasma kernel in said<br>
interval. Alternatively the means for providing a sequence of relatively low voltage<br>
pulses includes means for providing pulses separated in time by an interval sufficiently<br>
short that total recombination of the plasma kernel does not occur in said interval. As<br>
another alternative, the means for providing a sequence of relatively low voltage pulses<br>
may comprise a means for preceding each such follow-on pulse by a high, sub-<br>
breakdown voltage.<br>
According to a further aspect, an ignition circuit is shown for powering an igniter<br>
in an internal combustion engine, the circuit comprising a high voltage pulse generator<br>
which generates on an output for connection to an igniter a pulse whose maximum<br>
voltage, when delivered to the igniter, is capable causing a breakdown discharge, at a<br>
high current, in an initiation region between electrodes of the igniter (e.g., adjacent a<br>
surface of an isolator which separates the electrodes), when said igniter is disposed in a<br>
fuel-air mixture, whereby a plasma kernel is formed adjacent said surface by said<br>
 <br>

 <br>

discharge; and a low voltage pulse generator which generates on the output a sequence of<br>
one or more lower voltage and lower current pulses having voltage and current amplitude<br>
and timing sufficient to force the plasma kernel to move toward a free end of said<br>
electrodes by said lower voltage, lower current pulses. The ignition circuit may further<br>
include a simmer current source which supplies on the output, in an interval between the<br>
breakdown discharge and a first lower voltage pulse, a simmer current sufficient to<br>
prevent total recombination of the plasma kernel in said interval. Alternatively, the<br>
circuit may include a follow-on pulse generator that supplies, on the output, follow-on<br>
pulses which follow each other so closely (i.e., are separated by a sufficiently short<br>
interval) that total recombination of the plasma does not occur in the interval between<br>
such pulses. As another alternative, the circuit may include a pulse source providing a<br>
sequence of relatively low voltage pulses and a high voltage source which provides,<br>
preceding each such follow-on pulse, a sub-breakdown high voltage sufficient to delay<br>
total recombination such that total recombination has not occurred when the relatively<br>
low voltage pulse starts.<br>
Thus, this invention is not limited in its application to the details of construction<br>
and the arrangement of components set forth in the following description or illustrated in<br>
the drawings. The invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or<br>
of being carried out in various ways. Any embodiments are presented by way of<br>
example only. Also, the phraseology and terminology used herein is for the purpose of<br>
description and should not be regarded as limiting. The use of "including,"<br>
"comprising," or "having," "containing," "involving," and variations thereof herein, is<br>
meant to encompass the items listed thereafter and equivalents thereof as well as<br>
additional items.<br>
It is useful, now, to attempt to better understand the problems encountered when<br>
one attempts to operate an igniter in a high pressure engine. A traveling spark igniter<br>
(TST) is an ignition device which is in the nature of a small plasma gun. A typical TSI is<br>
illustrated in Fig. 1, taken from U.S. patent no. 6,321,733. An isolator (e.g., ceramic)<br>
material 14 maintains electrode spacing. A plasma 16 is created along the surface of the<br>
isolator, due to a high voltage breakdown process occurring there. As the discharge<br>
current passes through the plasma, the temperature and volume of the plasma increase,<br>
leading to a further decrease in plasma resistivity and resistance. This increases the<br>
 <br>

 <br>

 <br>
-15-.<br>
current in the plasma, which is limited primarily by the impedance of the electrical<br>
discharge circuit that produces the current supplied to the igniter.<br>
A typical ignition circuit for operating a TSI is shown in Fig. 2, which is also<br>
taken from U.S. patent 6,321,733. The circuit consists of two main parts: (l)a<br>
conventional ignition system 42 and (2) a follow-on current generator comprising<br>
capacitors such as 46 and 48, a low voltage power supply 44 and diode 50. The<br>
conventional ignition system 42 provides a high voltage for creating a breakdown (at a<br>
high current) in the spark gap along the isolator surface 56 between the electrodes 18 and<br>
20, to form an initial plasma in the gaseous combustion mixture near that surface. The<br>
follow-on current generator provides a current through the initial plasma, in the spark<br>
gap, after breakdown discharge, forming a much larger plasma volume. Resistor 54 may<br>
(but need not) be used to limit the maximum current from capacitor 48. A typical<br>
voltage discharge profile (not to scale) is shown in Fig. 3, taken from U.S.<br>
patent 6,474,321.<br>
The conventional ignition system 42 initiates discharge in the discharge gap at<br>
time t = to- As a result, the voltage in a secondary coil in the high voltage (HV) ignition<br>
•transformer therein rises until it reaches the breakdown voltage in the spark gap at t = ti.<br>
After breakdown occurs at t = ti the voltage across the discharge gap drops rapidly to<br>
value of about 500 volts or less at t = ti, corresponding to low plasma resistivity. The<br>
voltage is substantially constant until a time t -13, when just about all the energy from<br>
capacitors 46 and 48 has been transferred, following which the voltage and current<br>
rapidly diminish to a near-zero value at time t = U- For simplicity, we shall assume that<br>
the interval from t3 to t4 is negligibly short. The interval At = t3 -12 is related to the<br>
energy stored in capacitors 46 and 48 as well as the voltage of the follow-on current<br>
through the discharge gap after breakdown occurred. The following energy balance<br>
equation relates the variables:<br>
 <br>
where V(t) is the voltage as a function of time, between the electrodes defining the<br>
discharge gap, such voltage having an initial value Vt2 at time t2 and a final value Vt2 ~ 0<br>
at t&gt;t4, i(t) is the current in the spark gap as a function of time and C is the sum of the<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/113850	PCT/US2006/014840<br>
-16-<br>
discharging capacitance (here, the sum of capacitances of capacitors 46 and 48). In the<br>
time interval Δt = t3 - t2, one can assume, as a first approximation, that V(t) ~ V0 and is<br>
roughly constant, therefore, Vt22 - Vt42, ~ V02. If one further assumes that the plasma<br>
resistivity is constant, one can make the assumption i(t) ~ i0. One can use these<br>
simplifying assumptions to obtain a basic relationship between Δt (Δt ~ t4 -t2 because t4 -<br>
t3,« Δt) and the circuit parameters described by C, V0, and i0:<br>
Δt=CV0/2i0<br>
This simple relationship provides information about pulse duration as a function of<br>
capacitance and average current io during discharge, for a given operating (relatively<br>
low) voltage Vo on the capacitors. For a given energy provided to the igniter (hence,<br>
given Vo and C), this relationship teaches that for current io to increase, the pulse<br>
duration At has to decrease. However, increasing current io also increases the Lorentz<br>
force FL- Increasing the Lorentz force moves the plasma away from the isolator surface<br>
faster, toward the end of the electrodes, into the combustion chamber of the engine.<br>
Pressure in the combustion chamber, however, provides a countervailing pressure force<br>
Fp in the igniter. Force Fp works against the Lorentz force preventing the speed of the<br>
plasma from increasing above some limiting value, independent of the length £ of the<br>
electrodes (i.e., I is the distance between the surface of the isolator and the free end of<br>
electrodes facing into the combustion chamber).<br>
The net force available to move the plasma is the difference between the Lorentz<br>
force FL and the pressure force Fp (assuming one can ignore the thermal force on the<br>
plasma as it is significant only at the earlier stages of plasma propagation and diminishes<br>
quickly as the plasma moves away from the isolator surface). It is useful to develop a<br>
model of the forces in order to understand how to overcome the pressure force. The<br>
Lorentz force FL can be represented as a magnetic pressure pe on the plasma, given by<br>
the well-known relationship pB = B2/8Π, multiplied by the effective plasma surface area,<br>
 <br>
 <br>
WO 2006/113850	PCT/US2006/014840<br>
-17-<br>
The gas pressure force Fp can be presented in the form Fp =pSpt, where p is the effective<br>
gas pressure from the combustion mixture (facing the plasma during its movement).<br>
Hence, one can write the equation for the net force governing plasma movement can be<br>
presented as:<br>
(FL - Fp) = mpt. dvpt/dt,<br>
where v&gt;pt is plasma velocity and nipt is plasma mass. In turn, plasma mass can be<br>
presented as the product of plasma mass density ppi and plasma volume Vpt - S^A^,<br>
where b&amp;pt is a fraction representing the portion of the electrode length occupied<br>
momentarily by the plasma.<br>
The net force equation can be simplified, and useful relationships derived from it,<br>
by making some rough assumptions. One can assume that the plasma volume, after its<br>
formation, is constant as the plasma propagates along the electrodes; thus, S^, b£pt and<br>
ppi are constant and forces FL and Vp are also constant. Then, by integrating one obtains:<br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
where it was assumed that the initial plasma velocity t&gt;t2 was much smaller than its final<br>
velocity, ty.<br>
 <br>
From this equation, one observes that for relatively small pressure (i.e., p « ccio2), At IQ<br>
« constant; and in this range of parameters, increasing z0 leads to decreasing At. Then<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/113850<br>
 <br>
PCTAJS2006/014840<br>
 <br>
-18-<br>
from the above relationships, one can see that the plasma can be moved faster with<br>
increasing z'o without really increasing the discharge energy (of course, this is only true<br>
for PptAZpi « const.; with increasing z"o, Pptklpt may also increase, so some additional<br>
energy may be required).<br>
However, when it is not true that p « cdo2 (i.e., the assumption fails), then<br>
increasing pressure p could lead to p/ou2 &gt; 1 and the plasma could stop moving<br>
altogether. In such a case, it will be necessary to increase i &gt; k to the point that p/at2 
1. This requires a significant increase in energy, though, due to increased At and /.<br>
Recombination processes in the plasma pose a further hurdle. The front portion<br>
of the hot plasma that is in contact with a relatively cold combustion mixture cools<br>
rapidly. The plasma recombination rate at high pressure is a function of plasma<br>
temperature, T, that varies as 1/T . Hence, at low temperature, plasma recombination<br>
occurs very fast at its propagation front where it interacts with the cold gaseous mixture.<br>
At high pressures, such recombination rate could be as fast as the plasma propagation<br>
velocity, meaning that the Lorentz force - induced movement would be entirely negated<br>
by the speed of recombination, effectively causing the plasma to stand still. In such a<br>
situation, the net plasma velocity along the electrodes is substantially zero and the<br>
plasma will seem to stay near the surface of the isolator during the entire discharge. The<br>
plasma, of course, recombines near the surface of the isolator, as well, though at a much<br>
slower rate because the gas there is much hotter than at the plasma's front edge<br>
Consequently, plasma resistivity near the isolator surface is lower than at the front edge<br>
of the plasma and most of the discharge current will be concentrated in that region,<br>
preventing further plasma recombination near the isolator.<br>
As shown above, increasing operating combustion chamber pressure lowers the<br>
net motive force on the plasma so it moves more slowly and the time it takes for the<br>
plasma to move to the combustion chamber thus increases. Therefore, for sufficiently<br>
large pressures, the plasma may never succeed in reaching the end of the igniter.<br>
To prevent the plasma from slowing down so much, the discharge current has to<br>
be raised, in order to increase the energy being fed into the plasma The increased<br>
energy input, though, is concentrated near the isolator. That is quite problematic. There<br>
are thermal stresses imposed on the isolator and shock waves are generated that can<br>
damage the isolator. There are also large thermal effects on the portions of the electrodes<br>
near the isolator. Assuming the ignition circuit supplies sufficient energy to create a net<br>
 <br>

 <br>

 <br>

force that will effectively move the plasma, then the higher the pressure in the<br>
combustion chamber, the worse the negative effects on the isolator and electrodes.<br>
These conditions decrease isolator and electrode longevity in high pressure<br>
environments, unless something is done to prevent those negative impacts.<br>
The problem of decreasing longevity of traveling spark igniters with increasing<br>
gas (i.e., combustion mixture) pressure is significantly decreased, or even eliminated, at<br>
least in part by decreasing the difference between the speed of recombination at the front<br>
of the plasma (facing the combustion chamber) and the back of the plasma (facing the<br>
isolator). By making plasma recombination more symmetrical, a significant net force on<br>
the plasma is directed into the combustion chamber.<br>
FIG. 4 diagrammatically illustrates the problem. A relatively short first current<br>
pulse forms a volume of plasma 42, as indicated by the dashed line. During that first<br>
pulse, the center of the plasma moves to the right, away from isolator 14, under the<br>
influence of the Lorentz force. As the pulse is of relatively short duration, neither the<br>
isolator surface nor the gas near the surface is heated significantly. Therefore, after the<br>
first current pulse ends, the plasma recombines at its back (left) side and its front (right)<br>
side fairly symmetrically, leaving a relatively narrow plasma kernel 44. The narrow<br>
plasma kernel still can support an arc, as explained above.<br>
The present invention improves the symmetry of plasma recombination by using<br>
a different approach to energizing the igniter. Several short current discharge bursts<br>
(follow-on pulses) are applied after the breakdown pulse, between times t^ and t3. The<br>
follow-on pulses have moderately high peak current amplitude, but significantly less<br>
than the breakdown pulse. Between the breakdown pulse and the first follow-on pulse,<br>
and between follow-on pulses, the (simmer) current preferably is maintained at a low,<br>
non-zero value, to prevent total recombination.<br>
In Fig. 5, in which the waveform is shown for one example of an igniter current<br>
that may be used to excite a TSI as explained above, breakdown occurs at time ti (peak<br>
voltage, followed by maximum current) and is complete at time ti . Beginning at time tj,<br>
a series of (one or more) lower amplitude current pulses 52A - 52E (i.e., five pulses, in<br>
this example, though the number of pulses is variable) are provided between the<br>
electrodes of the igniter. The discharge interval ends at time t3, when the plasma reaches<br>
the end of the electrodes. The plasma started at the isolator at time ti. The durations TI,<br>
%2... xn of the respective pulses 52 and their peak current magnitude, io, should be<br>

 <br>

chosen according to igniter design and gas pressure p. In a traveling spark igniter, the<br>
pulse durations and magnitudes are selected, preferably, in accordance with the length of<br>
the electrodes and the gap between them. Experimentation is a satisfactory way, and for<br>
the moment probably the best way, of setting the values of those parameters for a given<br>
igniter design and maximum pressure of its operation.<br>
. The time between pulses also depends on igniter design and pressure. The time<br>
+<br>
between the breakdown current, when it reaches near-zero level at ti and the first<br>
follow-on pulse 52A, indicated as At^i, depends on the breakdown voltage and the<br>
specifics of the isolator between the electrodes. The simmer current is is non-zero and,<br>
as such, helps avoid total plasma recombination; otherwise, a large voltage (comparable<br>
to the breakdown voltage) would be needed for initiating the next pulse. So, the current<br>
is facilitates each subsequence pulse and allows its formation without the need for an<br>
additional breakdown pulse. The following table provides parameter values which have<br>
been found useful with TSI igniters operating in a simulated combustion chamber at 400<br>
psi pressure:<br>
Electrode length: £ — 2.5 mm<br>
Peak pulse current: k « 20 - 40Amperes,<br>
Duration of the k - pulse: T^ « 10 - 20 microseconds,<br>
Time between two consecutive pulses k and k + 1: At^k+i « 50 —100 microseconds,<br>
n (i.e., number of pulses) « 3 to 4,<br>
Simmer current: is~ 1 - 3 Amperes,<br>
Time between end of breakdown and the first follow-on pulse:Atb,i ~ 5 - 20<br>
microseconds.<br>
These parameters can be significantly different for different design of spark plugs<br>
or values of pressure p. For example, for a TSI similar to the one in the previous example<br>
and operating at pressure p = 900 psi, suitable parameters that have been found useful<br>
are:<br>

Though the peak pulse values io and pulse durations Xk and the times between<br>
individual pulses Atkjc+i have been shown as constant, they need not be uniform or<br>
constant. For example, they could actually increase or decrease as a function of time.<br>
FIGS. 6 and 7 diagrammatically illustrate the operation produced by this pulsed<br>
drive scheme. It is assumed the breakdown pulse has already occurred and the first<br>
follow-on pulse is in a position Aft away from the surface of the isolator, as in FIG. 4.<br>
After a time interval Atj;2 following the first pulse, the next pulse x2 occurs, after which<br>
the plasma is in a new position b£% away from the surface of the isolator. With each<br>
successive pulse, the plasma kernel is moved to the right and then at the end of the pulse,<br>
allowed to recombine (FIG. 6, showing the plasma position after two pulses), until<br>
eventually (FIG. 7) the plasma reaches the end of the electrodes after n current pulses,<br>
and is ejected into the combustion chamber. The number of follow-on pulses, n, will<br>
depend on the pressure p in chamber, igniter parameters (e.g., the length of the<br>
electrodes, the gap between the electrodes, and the shape of the electrodes) and current<br>
discharge parameters (e.g., peak values of pulses, their durations, the inter-pulse<br>
intervals, and minimum current value between pulses). Some experimentation may be<br>
required to find suitable values.<br>
Although the current pulses are shown as positive pulses in Fig. 5, it should be<br>
realized that negative pulses can also be used, or alternating pulses or some other pattern<br>
of pluralities. The Lorentz force FL is proportional to the square of the surrent and is,<br>
therefore, independent of current polarity. Additionally, the discharge current pulses,<br>
shown as rectangular in Fig. 5, could have any suitable waveform, such as triangular<br>
shape or sinusoidal shape.<br>
As stated above, with increased operating pressure, the breakdown of voltage<br>
along the surface of the isolator also increases. Increase in breakdown voltage has a<br>
negative impact on the lifetimes of the isolator and electrodes. Such negative effects can<br>
be avoided or significantly reduced by limiting the breakdown current. For example,<br>
introducing a resistor into the high voltage circuit, as described below, limits breakdown<br>
current without wasting significantly energy when the breakdown discharge is of short<br>
duration in comparison with the total interval of follow-on discharge pulses. Limiting<br>
the current causes the mode of operation to differ substantially from that of prior TSI<br>
systems. In prior TSI systems, such as those shown in U.S. patents 6,321,733 and<br>
6,474,321, it was desired that a high breakdown current be followed immediately by high<br>

current from capacitors to create maximum acceleration and plasma speed. The goal was<br>
to get the plasma to reach the end of the electrodes and move into the combustion<br>
chamber in a single discharge pulse. In contrast, in a high pressure environment, plasma<br>
motion is small following breakdown. Thus, it is acceptable to limit the breakdown<br>
current since the breakdown current is only used to create the plasma near the isolator<br>
surface, rather than to actually produce significant plasma motion.<br>
The interval between the end of the breakdown current pulse and the first follow-<br>
on current pulse, Atb; ti depends on the peak value of the discharge current. Assuming<br>
that a resistor Rb is used to achieve this current limiting effect, than the delay time<br>
depends on the value of that resistor, which depends on the applied breakdown voltage<br>
which, in turn, depends upon the pressure p. Thus, the value of resistor Rb can be chosen<br>
to minimize stress on the isolator and electrode wear.<br>
Fig. 8 shows a partial schematic circuit diagram for an example of an electronic<br>
circuit for producing the breakdown pulse and follow-on pulses as depicted in Fig. 5. In<br>
Fig. 8, circuitry is shown for generating only the breakdown pulse and one follow-on<br>
pulse. For each additional follow-on pulse that is desired, the circuitry 110 enclosed in a<br>
dashed line can be replicated and all such circuits can be connected with the secondary<br>
windings of their boost transformers 102 in series, so that each such circuit will, in turn,<br>
deliver one of the sequenced pulses to the igniter. (Note that ta parallel arrangement is<br>
also possible.)<br>
A high voltage, for providing breakdown discharge is generated by a high energy<br>
ignition coil 100, triggered by a signal applied at 104 to cause switching of SCR 104A.<br>
Coil 100 may be any suitable ignition coil such as, but not limited to, coil model 8261<br>
sold by Autotronic Controls Corporation of El Paso, Texas, d/b/a MSD Ignition. Though<br>
usually referred to in the industry as an "ignition coil," element 100 actually is a<br>
transformer. The aforementioned model 8261 ignition coil has a low inductance primary<br>
and provides a 42-43kV output from its secondary coil when the primary coil is<br>
energized. The secondary coil of transformer 100 is directly connected (through<br>
secondary coil 102B of boost transformer 102) to one or more electrodes of igniter 101,<br>
another electrode of which is grounded.<br>
The string 106 of diodes, each paralleled by a high resistance, limits the output<br>
voltage of the ignition coil 100 to a single polarity and prevents ringing.<br>

After the breakdown pulse, a trigger signal is applied at 105 to cause a follow-on<br>
pulse to be generated. The boost transformer 102 feeds the high voltage line (HVL) to<br>
igniter 101 with a pulse of current induced by discharging capacitor 103. Capacitor 103<br>
is charged to a relatively low voltage such as, for example, about 500V and then<br>
discharged through the primary coil 102A of transformer 102 to ground through the SCR<br>
105 A.<br>
The trigger signals can be generated by any suitable circuit that may provide<br>
either fixed or programmable parameters.<br>
The igniter electrode(s) connected to the high voltage line are also connected,<br>
through a string of diodes 107, and an RC network 111, to a low voltage supply, such as<br>
the indicated 500V supply. The resistor values in network 111 are set to deliver the<br>
simmer current, is<br>
The ignition circuit of Fig. 8, it will be appreciated, represents just one way to<br>
generate the breakdown voltage and to deliver the initial current and the follow-on pulses<br>
of current that are desired. Any other suitable mechanism may be employed that<br>
generates comparable pulsing. For example, a resonant current circuit that could provide<br>
oscillating current pulses, such as sinusoidal current pulses, could be used instead of the<br>
indicated plurality of sub-circuits, each of which generates a single pulse. Moreover, by<br>
proper inversion of polarities of voltage and diodes, the circuit of Fig. 8 could be used to<br>
generate negative pulses instead of positive pulses.<br>
Another example of an ignition circuit architecture (in simplified form) is shown<br>
in Fig. 9 at 130. Only the basic circuit components are shown, it being understood that a<br>
practical implementation may require other customary components. Power supply 132<br>
supplies a voltage (termed the "high" voltage for purposes of distinguishing it, only).<br>
The voltage is high enough so that it can generate, when stepped up by transformer 134,<br>
a breakdown voltage sufficient to create a plasma at the igniter (not shown). Power<br>
supply is connected to a first end of primary winding 134A through a diode 136, to<br>
charge a capacitor 138, connected between the other end of the primary winding and<br>
ground. A pulse generator 142 supplies a train or sequence of pulses. On a first pulse,<br>
an output signal from pulse generator 142 closes electronically controlled switch 144.<br>
This action grounds the anode of diode 136, effectively disconnecting supply 132 so that<br>
it is not short-circuited, and allows capacitor 138 to discharge through the primary<br>

winding, Transformer 134 is a saturable-core step-up transformer. The HV supply 132<br>
typically has an output voltage of a few hundred volts. The closing of switch 144<br>
generates a large voltage swing across the transformer primary. Typically, a turns ratio<br>
of about 1:35 -1:40 may be used in the transformer, and this will step up the several<br>
hundred volt swing on the primary up to the range of tens of thousands of volts across<br>
the secondary winding, 134B. This latter voltage is sufficient to produce breakdown<br>
when applied to an igniter (connected to one end of the secondary winding, but not<br>
shown).<br>
The aforesaid pulse preferably also saturates the core of transformer 134.<br>
Due to the core saturation, if a next pulse is supplied by the pulse generator 142<br>
before the saturation ebbs totally, such pulse will not generate a breakdown-level output<br>
voltage on output line 152.<br>
The other end of primary winding 134B, at 154, and one end of a capacitor, 156,<br>
are tied to ground via a diode 158. Capacitor 156 is charged by a "low voltage" (LV)<br>
supply through a protective diode 164. When a pulse from pulse generator 142 is<br>
received by electronic switch 166, node 168 is grounded and capacitor 156 is grounded<br>
through series-connected diode 172, resistor 174 and switch 168.<br>
Low Voltage supply 162 may typically supply a voltage in the range of 0 -1000<br>
volts. Capacitor 156 is a large capacitance in a typical ignition system and resistor 174<br>
may be sized to limit the discharge current (pulled through the secondary winding 134 of<br>
the transformer) to about 50 Amperes (less if a lower current will suffice in the follow-on<br>
pulses).<br>
Diodes 182 and 184 merely protect their respective switches from reverse<br>
polarity spikes that could be destructive to them.<br>
Supplies 132 and 162 are shown as separate but a single supply may be used in<br>
some applications. Also, the terms low voltage and high voltage are not intended to<br>
require that the output of supply 132 be at a higher voltage than the output of supply 162,<br>
though that is most typical.<br>
Diode 164 is included for the same reason as diode 136, to protect its associated<br>
power supply from having a short-circuited output when the associated switch is closed.<br>
Depending on the exact construction of the supplies 132,162, it also may be<br>
desirable to place a resistance in series between the one or both of the supplies and<br>
 <br>
WO 2006/113850<br>
 <br>

corresponding switch 144 or 166, as applicable, to limit the output current of the supply<br>
and the charging time of the corresponding capacitor.<br>
Switches 144,166 may be implemented using various semiconductors, such as<br>
SCRs, IGBTs (especially for switch 144), MCTs and other high voltage switching<br>
elements as now or in the future may exist.<br>
A small capacitor, 159, may bypass diode 158, providing a low impedance path<br>
to ground for rapid voltage changes and protecting diode 158 against large reverse<br>
spikes.<br>
Other variations are possible. For example, instead of a single pulse generator<br>
actuating switches 144 and 166, each switch may be actuated by a different pulse<br>
generator, or one pulse generator may be employed with different outputs or differently<br>
conditioned output signals (possibly derived from a common signal) driving the<br>
switches. Or, one switch may be used, instead of two switches, as shown in Fig. 10,<br>
referring to switching element (e.g., MCT) 186. (In Fig. 10, the resistors R are expressly<br>
shown though they may not be needed, depending on power supply details.) If different<br>
pulse generators drive each of the switches, they can be controlled independently and<br>
this will permit a variety of modes of operation to be accommodated.<br>
In Fig. 9, resistor 174 is shown in a dashed-line box, to indicate it is optional.<br>
Irrespective of the fact that supply 162 may be set in conjunction with capacitor 156 to<br>
control the desired amplitude of follow-on current pulses, all of the energy stored in<br>
capacitor 156 cannot be transferred to the arc. To sustain a current in the follow-on<br>
pulses over the interval of each pulse, the capacitor 156 must be discharged at a<br>
controlled rate. One way to do this is to discharge the capacitor through a resistor, such<br>
as resistor 174. Unfortunately, the use of resistor 174 results in the dissipation of a lot of<br>
the stored energy as heat. Indeed, more energy may be lost as heat in resistor 156 than is<br>
expended in the movement of the plasma. Hence this circuit suffers from inefficient use<br>
of energy.<br>
It is possible to improve the efficiency of the circuit and to reduce the heat<br>
dissipation by making the switch element 166 a controlled current drainage path. Then,<br>
instead of using resistance 174 to limit the current drain off of capacitor 156, the switch<br>
transistor (or like element) takes care of that need, providing controlled discharge. More<br>
specifically, as shown in Fig. 11, an active switching element (here indicated as a<br>
MOSFET166'), is connected from node 168 to ground through a resistor 192. The<br>

WO 2006/113850<br>
 <br>
PCT/US2006/014840<br>
 <br>
-26-<br>
voltage across that resistor is sensed as a proxy for measuring the actual current through<br>
transistor 166'. Gate drive logic 194 interposed between the pulse generator and the gate<br>
of transistor 166', responsive to the voltage on resistor 192, operates the transistor as a<br>
switching regulator, with variable duty cycle and a resulting lower power dissipation<br>
than that arising from the use of resistor 174. Drive logic 194 may be implemented in<br>
various ways and may include fixed logic or it may include programmable logic,<br>
possibly including a microcontroller to operate the logic. An advantage of using a<br>
microcontroller is that the logic can then be configured to operate the circuit to perform<br>
in the various modes discussed herein - e.g., with or without simmer current.<br>
Note that although the generation of pulses of positive polarity will result from<br>
the illustrated examples of ignition circuits, those skilled in the art of electronics will<br>
readily be able to derive therefrom ignition circuits that will produce negative polarity<br>
pulses and even pulses of varied polarities, should it be desired to have same. It may<br>
also be desirable that some or all trigger pulses be o polarity differing from the output<br>
pulses.<br>
The detailed design of the drive logic and the parameters for the breakdown<br>
voltage, follow-on pulses, igniter, etc. will all depend on the particular engine<br>
specifications which the ignition system is required to meet. Those requirements, and<br>
considerations such as cost, component availability, and so forth will influence<br>
component selection, as well. Determination of some of these parameters may require a<br>
degree of experimentation on a model of the engine(s) for which the ignition system or<br>
circuit is intended.<br>
Although the problems and their solution have been discussed using just one<br>
form of TSI, both apply equally to other TSI designs, using both parallel and coaxial<br>
electrodes.<br>
While certain methods and apparatus have been discussed herein for use with<br>
internal combustion engines operating at high and very high pressures, it will be<br>
understood that this technology also can be used with traveling spark igniters in internal<br>
combustion engines operating at lower, conventional pressures, or even with<br>
conventional spark plugs. The advantages, however, probably will be greatest with<br>
traveling spark igniters.<br>
Also, it should be understood that although a theory of operation has been<br>
presented, there are number of simplifying assumptions which may very much limit<br>

working ignition system in a simulated high pressure engine environment, and any<br>
simplifications or errors in analysis will be understood not to detract from the value of<br>

Having thus described several aspects of at least one embodiment of this<br>

will readily occur to those skilled in the art. Such alterations, modifications, and<br>

An ignition circuit and a method of operating an igniter (preferably a traveling spark igniter) in an internal combustion engine, including a high pressure engine.

Following breakdown, a sequence of one or more lower voltage and lower current pulses is applied to said electrodes, with a low "simmer" current being sustained through the plasma between pulses, preventing total plasma recombination and allowing the plasma kernel to move toward a free end of the electrodes with each pulse.</td>
