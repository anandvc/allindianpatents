				<td>DESCRIPTION PROCESS FOR PRODUCING THERMOPLASTIC RESIN COMPOSITION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing<br>
a thermoplastic resin composition, and more specifically to a<br>
process for producing a thermoplastic resin composition using<br>
a polyolefin wax in a specific form and a thermoplastic resin,<br>
a process for producing a molded product from the<br>
thermoplastic resin composition, and a molded product<br>
obtained from the thermoplastic resin composition.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]<br>
Conventionally, a polyolefin wax has been used in a<br>
thermoplastic resin composition for a lubricant, a releasing<br>
agent, a molding aid, or the like (for example, Patent<br>
Documents 1 and 2).<br>
The polyolefin wax, which is usually in a powdered form,<br>
is mixed with a thermoplastic resin, and thus obtained<br>
mixture is molded into a thermoplastic resin composition<br>
using an extrusion molding machine.  However, the production<br>
by these methods leads to the compositional variation in the<br>
mixture and the dissolution of the polyolefin wax prior to<br>
the dissolution of the thermoplastic resin in a molding machine such as an extrusion molding machine, so the dispersion of the polyolefin wax for the thermoplastic resin was insufficient, the expected performance caused by the addition of a wax such as improvement of releasability against the increase of the added amount of the wax is not provided, and the performances of the obtained thermoplastic resin compositions are varied.<br>

[Patent Document 2] JP-A No. 2003-528948<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION [0003]<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a<br>
process for producing a thermoplastic resin composition<br>
comprising a polyolefin wax having good dispersibility for a<br>
thermoplastic resin, a process for producing a molded product<br>
using the thermoplastic resin composition, and a molded<br>
product obtained from the thermoplastic resin composition.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEMS<br>
[0004]<br>
The present inventors have reviewed the above-described<br>
problems, and as a result, they have found that a thermoplastic resin composition having good dispersibility of a polyolefin wax into a thermoplastic resin is obtained by melting and molding a mixture of a polyolefin wax in a specific form and a thermoplastic resin, and a molded product having excellent physical properties can be obtained by using the composition, thus leading to completion of the present invention.<br>
Specifically, the process for producing a thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention is characterized in that a mixture of a polyolefin wax (A) in the particle form, which has a passing ratio through a mesh having a sieve<br>
opening of 5.66 mmф of 95% by weight or more, and a non-passing ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 2.00 mmф of 95% by weight or more, and a thermoplastic resin (B) is melt-kneaded. [0005]<br>
The polyolefin wax (A) is preferably a polyethylene wax, and more preferably a metallocene polyethylene wax.<br>
A molded product of the present invention is obtained by molding thus obtained thermoplastic resin composition.<br>
EFFECTS OF THE INVENTION [0006]<br>
According to the present invention, a thermoplastic resin composition having good dispersibility of a polyolefin wax into a thermoplastic resin is obtained, and a molded product obtained from the thermoplastic resin composition is excellent in physical properties, such as blocking property, mechanical properties, and the like.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION [0007]<br>
Hereinbelow, the present invention will be described in detail.<br>
[Polyolefin wax (A)]<br>
The polyolefin wax (A) in the present invention is a polyolefin wax having a crystallization temperature, as measured by a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) at a temperature lowering rate of 2°C/min., in the range of 65 to 120°C, and a number-average molecular weight (Mn) in terms of polystyrene, as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), in the range of 400 to 5,000. [0008]<br>
The polyolefin wax (A) of the present invention has a feature of having a specific form.  The polyolefin wax (A) of the present invention is a particle in the form of a pellet or a tablet, which has a passing ratio through a mesh having<br>
a sieve opening of 5.66 mmф of 95% by weight or more, and a non-passing ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 2.00 mmф of 95% by weight or more.<br>
By using such the polyolefin wax (A) in the particle form, the polyolefin wax (B) has excellent dispersibility for a thermoplastic resin (B) as described below upon mixing them. Further, since, upon melt-kneading a mixture thereof, the polyolefin wax (A) has excellent dispersibility for a thermoplastic resin (B), thus obtained thermoplastic resin composition is excellent in physical properties, such as blocking property, mechanical properties, and the like. [0009]<br>
For the ratio of the amount of the polyolefin wax (A) which passes through a mesh (hereinafter, which may be referred to as a "mesh passing amount"), it is preferable that the passing amount ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 5.66 mmф is 95% by weight or more, the passing amount ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 4.75 mmф is 70% by weight or more, and the passing amount ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 4.00 mmф is 40% by weight or more, and it is more preferable that the passing amount ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 5.66 mmфis 99% by weight or more, the passing amount ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 4.75 mmф is 75% by<br>
weight or more, and the passing amount ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 4.00 mmф is 45% by weight or more. [0010]<br>
For the ratio of the amount of the polyolefin wax (A) which does not pass through a mesh (hereinafter, which may be referred to as a "mesh-on amount"), it is preferable that the non-passing amount ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 2.00 mmф is 95% by weight or more, the non-passing amount ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 2.83 mmф is 80% by weight or more, and the non-passing amount ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 3.35 mmф is 50% by weight or more, and for the ratio of the amount of the polyolefin wax (A) which does not pass through a mesh, it is more preferable that that the non-passing ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 2.00 mmф is 99% by weight or more, the non-passing ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 2.83 mmф is 85% by weight or more, and the non-passing ratio through a mesh having a sieve opening of 3.35<br>
mmф is 60% by weight or more. [0011]<br>
With the mesh passing amount and the mesh-on amount of the polyolefin wax in the above range, the polyolefin wax can be readily mixed with a thermoplastic resin (B) as described below, and that is, for example, if the thermoplastic resin<br>
(B) is in the form of a pellet, they can be easily mixed in a device such as a tumbler mixer without classification.<br>
The polyolefin wax in such the form can be obtained, for example, by melting a polyolefin as a raw material at a melting point or higher, and droping the melted wax onto a cooling steel belt of a tabletizer for solidifying the wax. [0012]<br>
The temperature for melting the wax can be suitably selected according to the wax as long as it is no lower than the melting point of the wax, but usually it is preferably in the range of 100 to 160°C, and more preferably 130 to 150°C.<br>
The temperature of the cooling steel belt can be suitably selected according to the wax as long as it is no higher than the melting point of the wax, but usually it is preferably in the range of 10 to 40°C, and more preferably 15 to 30°C. [0013]<br>
The speed of the cooling steel belt can be suitably selected, but usually it is preferably in the range of 10 to 25 m/min, and more preferably 10 to 20 m/min.<br>
The polyolefin wax (A) used in the present invention is not particularly limited as long as it is a wax of polyolefin, but examples thereof include a polyethylene wax, a polypropylene wax, a wax of an a-olefin homopolymer, a wax of<br>
an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer, and a wax of an ethylene/α<br>
olefin/non-conjugated diene copolymer.<br>
[0014]<br>
In the present invention, a polyethylene wax, a wax of<br>
an ethylene/αolef in copolymer, and a wax of an ethylene/α-olefin/non-conjugated diene copolymer may be collectively referred to a polyethylene based wax.<br>
Among these polyolefin waxes, a polyethylene wax, and a wax of an ethylene/α-olefin copolymer are preferable; a polyethylene wax, a wax of a copolymer of ethylene and an α-olefin having 3 to 20 carbon atoms is more preferable; a polyethylene wax, a wax of an ethylene/propylene copolymer, a wax of an ethylene/1-butene copolymer, a wax of an ethylene/1-pentene copolymer, a wax of an ethylene/1-hexene copolymer, a wax of an ethylene/4-methyl-l-pentene copolymer, and a wax of an ethylene/1-octene copolymer are even more preferable; a polyethylene wax, a wax of an<br>
ethylene/propylene copolymer, a wax of an ethylene/1-butene copolymer, a wax of an ethylene/1-hexene copolymer, and a wax of an ethylene/4-methyl-l-pentene copolymer are particularly preferable. [0015]<br>
If the polyolefin wax (A) is the above-described polyolefin wax, the dispersity for the thermoplastic resin<br>
(B) to be described later, in particular, for a polyolefin resin as the thermoplastic resin (B), is essentially excellent.<br>
The polyolefin wax (A) has a number-average molecular weight (Mn) in terms of polystyrene, as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), in the range of usually 400 to 5,000, preferably 700 to 4,500, more preferably 800 to 4,000. [0016]<br>
With the Mn of the polyolefin wax (A) in the above range, the effect of improvement on the fluidity upon preparation of the thermoplastic resin composition is increased, and a homogeneous thermoplastic resin composition can be easily obtained.<br>
The polyolefin wax (A) has a ratio (Mw/Mn) of the weight-average molecular weight (Mw) to the number-average molecular weight (Mn) in terms of polystyrene, as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), in the range of preferably 1.5 to 4.0, more preferably 1.5 to 3.5. [0017]<br>
With the Mw/Mn of the polyolefin wax (A) in the above range, the surface tackiness of the molded product obtained from the thermoplastic resin composition can be essentially reduced.<br>
The polyolefin wax (A) has a crystallization temperature, as measured by a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) under the condition of a temperature lowering rate of 2°C/min., preferably in the range of 65 to 120°C, more preferably in the range of 70 to 120°C, and particularly preferably in the range of 70 to 118°C. [0018]<br>
With the crystallization temperature of the polyolefin wax (A) in the above range, the surface tackiness of the molded product obtained from the thermoplastic resin composition can be essentially reduced.<br>
The polyolefin wax (A) has a density, as measured by a density gradient tube method in accordance with JIS K7112, in the range of preferably 850 to 980 kg/m3, more preferably 870 to 980 kg/m3, and even more preferably 890 to 980 kg/m3. [0019]<br>
With the density of the polyolefin wax in the above range, the molding shrinkage of the molded product obtained from the thermoplastic resin composition can be easily regulated.<br>
Further, the polyolefin wax (A) satisfies the following relationship represented preferably by the following formula (I), more preferably the following formula (la), and even more preferably the following formula (lb), of the<br>
crystallization temperature [Tc (°C)], as measured by a differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), and the density (D (kg/m3)), as measured by a density gradient tube process:<br>
0.501xD-366 ≥ Tc	(I)<br>
0.501xD-366.5 ≥ Tc	(la)<br>
0.501xD-367 ≥ Tc	(lb)<br>
[0020]<br>
If the crystallization temperature (Tc) and the density (D) of the polyolefin wax (A), which is an ethylene/a-olefin copolymer for example, satisfy the above formula the compositional distribution of the copolymer is more uniform, and as a result, the tackiness of the molded product obtained from the thermoplastic resin composition comprising the polyolefin wax (A) and the thermoplastic resin (B) as described below tends to be reduced. [0021]<br>
The penetration hardness of the polyolefin wax (A), as measured in accordance with JIS K2207, is usually 30 dmm or less, preferably 25 dmm or less, more preferably 20 dmm or less, and even more preferably 15 dmm or less.<br>
With the penetration hardness of the polyolefin wax (A) in the above range, a molded product obtained from the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention can be provided with sufficient strength.<br>
 [0022]<br>
The polyolefin wax (A) has an acetone extraction quantity in the range of preferably 0 to 20% by weight, more preferably 0 to 15% by weight.<br>
Further, the acetone extraction quantity is a value measured in the following manner.<br>
In a Soxhlet's extractor (made of glass), a filter (ADVANCE, No. 84) is used, and 200 ml of acetone is introduced into a 300 ml round-bottom flask in the lower part. Extraction is carried out in a hot-water bath at 70°C for 5 hours.  10 g of the first wax is set on the filter. [0023]<br>
The polyolefin wax (A) is a solid at room temperature, and is a low-viscosity liquid at 65 to 130°C, or higher.<br>
With the acetone extraction quantity of the polyolefin wax (A) in the above range, the content of the tacky components is decreased, and the fouling of the mold is suppressed, as well as a molded product with no surface tackiness can be obtained. [0024]<br>
The process for producing the polyolefin wax is not particularly limited, but the polyolefin wax can be obtained, for example, by the polymerization of monomers such as ethylene and an α-olefin, using a Ziegler/Natta catalyst or a<br>
metallocene catalyst.  Among these catalysts, a metallocene catalyst is preferable.<br>
Examples of the metallocene catalyst include a catalyst for olefin polymerization comprising:<br>
(A)	a metallocene compound of a transition metal selected from Group 4 of the periodic table, and<br>
(B)	at least one kind of the compound selected from (b-1) an organoaluminum oxy-compound,<br>
(b-2) a compound which reacts with the bridged metallocene compound (A) to form ion pairs, and (b-3) an organoaluminum compound.<br>
Hereinbelow, each of the components will be described in detail. [0025]<br>
[Metallocene Compound]<br>
(A) Metallocene compound of transition metal selected from Group 4 of the periodic table<br>
The metallocene compound for forming the metallocene catalyst is a metallocene compound of a transition metal selected from Group 4 of the periodic table, and a specific example thereof is a compound represented by the following formula (1):<br>
M1Lx   (1) In the above formula, M1 is a transition metal selected<br>
from Group 4 of the periodic table, x is a valence of the transition metal M1, and L is a ligand.  Examples of the transition metals indicated by M1 include zirconium, titanium and hafnium.  L is a ligand coordinated to the transition metal M1, and at least one ligand L is a ligand having a cyclopentadienyl skeleton.  This ligand having cyclopentadienyl skeleton may have a substituent.  Examples of the ligands L having the cyclopentadienyl skeleton include alkyl or cycloalkyl substituted cyclopentadienyl groups, such as a cyclopentadienyl group, a methylcyclopentadienyl group, an ethylcyclopentadienyl, an n-or i-propylcyclopentadienyl group, an n-, i-, sec-, or t-butylcyclopentadienyl group, a dimethylcyclopentadienyl group, a methylpropylcyclopentadienyl group, a methylbutylcyclopentadienyl group, and a<br>
methylbenzylcyclopentadienyl group; and further an indenyl group, a 4,5, 6,7-tetrahydroindenyl group and a fluorenyl group.  In these ligands having cyclopentadienyl skeleton, hydrogen may be replaced with a halogen atom, a trialkylsilyl group or the like. [0026]<br>
When the metallocene compound has two or more ligands having cyclopentadienyl skeleton as ligands L, two of the ligands having cyclopentadienyl skeleton may be bonded to<br>
each other through an alkylene group, such as ethylene or propylene, a substituted alkylene group, such as isopropylidene or diphenylmethylene, a silylene group, or a substituted silylene group, such as dimethylsilylene, diphenylsilylene or methylphenylsilylene. [0027]<br>
The ligand L other than the ligand having cyclopentadienyl skeleton (ligand having no cyclopentadienyl skeleton) is, for example, a hydrocarbon group of 1 to 12 carbon atoms, an alkoxy group, an aryloxy group, a sulfonic acid-containing group (-SO3R1) , wherein R1 is an alkyl group, an alkyl group substituted with a halogen atom, an aryl group, an aryl group substituted with a halogen atom, or an aryl group substituted with an alkyl group, a halogen atom or a hydrogen atom. [0028] [Example 1 of Metallocene Compound]<br>
When the metallocene compound represented by the above formula (1) has a transition metal valence of, for example, 4, this metallocene compound is more specifically represented by the following formula (2):<br>
R2kR31R4mR5nM1	(2)<br>
wherein M1 is a transition metal selected from Group 4 of the periodic table, R2 is a group (ligand) having<br>
cyclopentadienyl skeleton, and R3, R4 and R5 are each independently a group (ligand) having or not having cyclopentadienyl skeleton, k is an integer of 1 or greater, and k + 1 + m + n=4.<br>
  [0029]<br>
Examples of the metallocene compounds having zirconium as M1 and having at least two ligands having cyclopentadienyl skeleton include bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium monochloride monohydride, bis(cyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride,<br>
I  bis(l-methyl-3-butylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonate) and bis(1,3-dimethylcyclopentadienyl)zirconium dichloride. [0030]<br>
Also employable are compounds wherein the 1,3-position<br>
  substituted cyclopentadienyl group in the above compounds is replaced with a 1,2-position substituted cyclopentadienyl group.<br>
As another example of the metallocene compound, a metallocene compound of bridge type wherein at least two of R2, R3, R4 and R5 in the formula (2), e.g., R2 and R3, are groups (ligands) having cyclopentadienyl skeleton and these at least two groups are bonded to each other through an alkylene group, a substituted alkylene group, a silylene group, a substituted silylene group or the like is also<br>
employable.  In this case, R4 and R5 are each independently the same as the ligand L other than the aforesaid ligand having cyclopentadienyl skeleton.<br>
[0031]<br>
Examples of the metallocene compounds of bridge type include ethylenebis(indenyl)dimethylzirconium, ethylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride, isopropylidene(cyclopentadienyl-fluorenyl)zirconium dichloride, diphenylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride and methylphenylsilylenebis(indenyl)zirconium dichloride.<br>

[q2] A method for adding a component (A) and a component (B) to a polymerization reactor in any order.<br>
For the [q2] method, at least two of each catalyst components may be in contact with each other beforehand. At this time, a hydrocarbon solvent is generally used, but an a-olefin may be used as a solvent.  In addition, the monomers used herein are as previously described. [0105]<br>
As the polymerization process, suspension polymerization wherein polymerization is carried out in such a state that the polyethylene wax is present as particles in a solvent such as hexane, or gas phase polymerization wherein a solvent is not used, or solution polymerization wherein polymerization is carried out at a polymerization temperature of not lower than 140°C in such a state that the polyethylene wax is molten in the presence of a solvent or is molten alone is employable.  Among these, solution polymerization is preferable in both aspects of economy and quality.<br>

Using these catalysts, a polyolefin wax having the above ranges of Mn, Mw/Mn, a melting point and other preferable physical properties can be obtained.  The polyolefin wax obtained with the catalysts has high effect for improving the fluidity, greatly improves the molding rate, and reduces the content of the tacky components, and thus a molded product with no surface tackiness can be obtained.<br><br>
 [0109]<br><thermoplastic resin><br>
In the present invention, a thermoplastic resin (B) is mixed with the polyolefin wax (A) for use.  The thermoplastic resin (B) according to the present invention refers to a thermoplastic polymer, or a blend thereof, having a number-average molecular weight (Mn) in terms of polystyrene, as measured by gel permeation chromatography (GPC), of 8,000 or more.

Among these thermoplastic resins, polyolefin is preferable; and a low-density polyethylene, a medium-density polyethylene, a high-density polyethylene, a straight chained low-density polyethylene, polypropylene, and an ethylene-propylene copolymer are more preferable.<br>
If the thermoplastic resin (B) is the above-described resin, the dispersity with the polyolefin wax (A) is excellent essentially, and the thermoplastic resin composition comprising the thermoplastic resin (B) has the increased effect of improvement on the fluidity and tends to have a further increased molding speed.  From the the resin composition, for example, a molded product having no surface tackiness is obtained.  Further, good dispersion of the polyolefin wax in the molded product can give suppression of the reduction of the performances of the molded product such as lowered strength of the molded product and bleed-out of<br>
the low molecular weight components compared to the molded<br>
product adding the conventional wax.<br>
[0112]<br>
The thermoplastic resin (B) is preferably a particle in the form of a pellet or a tablet.<br><additive><br>

[0113]<br>
Examples of the stabilizer include an antioxidant such as hindered phenol compounds, phosphite compounds, and thioether compounds;<br>

Among these compounds, silver and the silver compound are desirable due to its high thermal stability. [0116]<br>
Examples of the silver compounds include silver complexes, silver salts such as fatty acidsalts and<br>
phosphoric acid salts and the like.<br>
If silver and the silver compounds are used as an antibacterial agent or an antifungal agent, these may be used as supported on a porous structure such as zeolite, silica gel, zirconium phosphate, calcium phosphate, hydrotalcite, hydroxyapatite, calcium silicate. [0117]<br>
Other additives also include a colorant, a plasticizer, an anti-aging agent, a pigment, a plasticizer, and oils.<br>
[Process for producing thermoplastic resin composition]<br>
In the process for producing the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention, firstly a mixture comprising the polyolefin wax (A), the thermoplastic resin<br>
(B), and if desired, an additive is prepared.  The process for preparing the mixture is not particularly limited, but the mixture may be produced by simply putting the compounding materials into a container and shaking them for mixing, or by using a mixing device such as a tumbler and a Henschel mixer.<br>
[0118]<br>
By melt-kneading thus prepared mixture, the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention can be obtained.  The melt-kneading can be carried out using, for example, an extruder, a plastomill, a Brabender, a kneader, a<br>
roll mixer, a Banbury mixer, or the like.<br>
The temperature for melt-kneading is not particularly limited as long as the polyolefin wax (A), the thermoplastic resin (B), and the like are molten, but if the thermoplastic resin is polypropylene, it is usually in the range of usually 190 to 300°C, preferably 200 to 250°C. [0119]<br>
The amount of the polyolefin wax (A) blended in the thermoplastic resin composition is not particularly limited, but it is usually 0.01 to 20 parts by weight, preferably 0.1 to 10 parts by weight, and more preferably 0.3 to 5 parts by weight based on 100 parts by weight of the thermoplastic resin (B).<br>
With blending the polyolefin wax (A) in the above range, there is a tendency that the improvement on the fluidity upon molding of the thermoplastic resin composition is increased, and the molding speed is further enhanced.  As compared with the thermoplastic resin composition including no polyolefin wax (A), the thermoplastic resin composition of the present invention tends to allow molding at a lower molding temperature, to shorten the cooling time, and thus to increase the molding cycle.  Further, the molding temperature tends to be lowered, thus leading to suppression of the thermal deterioration of the resin and then reduction of the<br>
resin strength, as well as to suppression of the burning and black speck of the resin. [0120] [Molded product]<br>
The molded product of the present invention can be obtained by molding the above thermoplastic resin composition.<br>
Examples of the molding process include injection molding, extrusion molding, blow molding, and other known molding processes.<br>
For example, if the molded product of the present invention is obtained by extrusion blow molding, a molded product is obtained usually by melting the mixture of a polyolefin wax (A) and a thermoplastic resin (B); extruding the mixture to a tubular parison from a die at a resin temperature in the range of usually 170 to 240°C; holding the parison in the mold having a desired shape; blowing air; and contacting the parison with the mold usually at a resin temperature in the range of 160 to 230°C.  Further, drawing can be effected at a suitable ratio upon extrusion blow molding.<br>
If extrusion blow molding is effected using a high-density polyethylene as the thermoplastic resin (A), a molded product is obtained by extruding the resin from a die at a resin temperature in the range of usually 170 to 220°C,<br>
preferably 180 to 210°C, and contacting the resin with the mold at a resin temperature in the range of usually 160 to 210°C, preferably 170 to 200°C.  Further, drawing can be effected extrusion upon extrusion blow molding. [0121]<br>
If extrusion blow molding is effected using polypropylene as the thermoplastic resin (A), a molded product is obtained by extruding the resin from a die at a resin temperature in the range of usually 190 to 230°C, preferably 200 to 220°C, and contacting the resin with the mold at a resin temperature in the range of usually 180 to 220, preferably 190 to 210°C.  Further, drawing can be effected upon extrusion blow molding.<br>
Each of these blow molding processes can be carried out using a appropriate molding machine corresponding to each blow molding process. [0122]<br>
If injection molding is effected using polypropylene as the thermoplastic resin (A), the cylinder temperature upon injection molding is in the range of usually 180 to 400°C, preferably 200 to 300°C, and preferably 200 to 250°C, and the injection pressure in the range of usually 10 to 200 MPa, preferably 20 to 150 MPa, and the mold temperature is in the range of usually 20 to 200°C, preferably 20 to 80°C, and more<br>
preferably 20 to 60°C. [0123]<br>
If molding is effected to give an extruded sheet or a film using polypropylene as the thermoplastic resin (A) by means of a T-die extruder, or the like, the extrusion molding can be effect at a temperature in the range of usually 200 to 300°C, preferably 200 to 270°C, and more preferably 200 to 250°C to obtain a molded product.  Further, a film extruded from the extruder may be drawn, for example, by a tenter process (horizontal/vertical drawing, or vertical/horizontal drawing), a co-biaxial drawing process, or a monoaxial drawing process to obtain a drawn film. [0124]<br>
Further, upon molding, an expanding agent can added to the thermoplastic resin composition to perform expansion extrusion molding.  In the case of expansion extrusion, the design of a die and a sizing die should be made in consideration of the expansion ratio, or the like.  As the expanding agent for preparing the expansion molded product according to the present invention, organic or inorganic chemical expanding agents are preferable.  Examples of the chemical expanding agents generally include azodicarbonamide (ADCA), azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), N,N'-dinitrosopentamethylenetetramine (DPT), 4,4'-<br>
oxybis(benzenesulfonylhydrazide) (OBSH), sodium hydrogen carbonate (baking soda), ammonium carbonate, and the like. These expanding agents may be used in a mixture of two or more kinds.  Further, an expanding aid such as a zinc compound, an urea compound, an acidic substance, amines, and the like can be used.  In addition, a masterbatch having an expanding agent with improved handlability may be used. [0125]<br>
Since the mixture obtained by adding the polyolefin wax to the thermoplastic resin (B) is melted and molded, the melting viscosity of the resin is lowered.  Thus, a load upon molding, for example, a load on the motor upon extrusion molding is lowered, and the fluidity is improved, and thus there is a tendency that the molding speed is increased. Further, a molded product having a smooth surface by the improvement of the surface of the molded product can be obtained.  In addition, the molding can be effected at a lower molding temperature, so as to shorten the cooling time, and thus to increase the molding cycle, as well as to suppression of the thermal deterioration of the resin and the burning and black speck of the resin, and the molded product has excellent mechanical strength.<br>
