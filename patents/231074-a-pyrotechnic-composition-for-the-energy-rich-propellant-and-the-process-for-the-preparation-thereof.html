FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a pyrotechnic composition for energy rich propellant<br>
and the process for the preparation thereof.<br>
PRIOR ART;<br>
The three main classes of propellants viz. Composite, double based and<br>
composite modified double based, have to function at extremes of temperature<br>
and some times at high altitude according to the end use. For stable<br>
combustion, a certain amount of initial pressure is necessary which is different<br>
for different types of propellants depending upon the flame characteristics of the<br>
propellant. The critical combustion pressure required for composite propellants<br>
is 10-15 Kg/cm2 for double based propellant is 30-35 Kg/cm2 and for composite<br>
modified double based propellant it is 20-25 Kg/cm2.<br>
Conventionally gun powder having high gas to solid ratio has been used as an<br>
efficient igniter for ignition of double based propellants at ground level.<br>
The disadvantage of using gun powder as igniter is that it fails to ignite at high<br>
attitude.<br>
Another disadvantage of using gun powder as igniter is that it is not a reliable<br>
igniter for composite and composite modified double based propellants.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of using gun powder as igniter is that it does not give<br>
satisfactory ignition for composite propellants which have high auto ignition<br>
temperature and poor mechanical properties.<br>
Further disadvantage of using gun powder as igniter is that it is not very<br>
efficient for propellants which have low structural integrity and require low<br>
critical pressure for steady state of combustion.<br>
A pyrotechnic composition usually contains a small percentage of binder which<br>
may be of natural origin or man made organic polymer, which holds fuel (metal)<br>
and oxidiser components in homogenous blend. Some other pyrotechnic<br>
compositions with metal powders such as AI, Mg, B as fuel as KNOa as oxidiser,<br>
with or without binder have also been used as igniter for the propellants.<br>
However, disadvantage of using these pyrotechnic compositions without binder<br>
is that on storage the ingredients of constituent composition are likely to<br>
segregate.<br>
Another disadvantage of using these pyrotechnic compositions without binder is<br>
that the composition becomes sensitive to mechanical impulse.<br>
Yet another disadvantage of using these pyrotechnic compositions without<br>
binder is that the composition is susceptible to ingress of moisture which affects<br>
the final performance.<br>
Still another disadvantage of using these<br>
pyrotechnic compositions without binder is that the<br>
composition does not have pelleting property and thus are?<br>
Further disadvantage <.rf using these pyrotechnic></.rf>
compositions without binder is th.it the composition does not;<br>
give reproducible and reliable results.<br>
Still further disadvantage of using these<br>
pyrotechnic compositions without: binder is that such<br>
composi t ions do not have high coiftpressive? strength.<br>
The disadvantage of using pyrotechnic composition<br>
with organic polymer binder v.i,:'. Ethyl cellulose without<br>
plastic isation,, the composition is prone to oxidation in<br>
presence of light and temperature above the softening point<br>
i1 5uP C ) .<br>
Another disadvantage of using pyrotechnic<br>
composition with ethyl eellulose without piasticisation, as<br>
hinder is that on storage the composit.ion deteriorates and<br>
pellet becomes brittle in nature.<br>

(b) potassium nitrate as an oxidizer and present in an amount<br>
of 70 to 42% by weight preferably 55 to 45% by weight, and<br>
(c) the remaining is 8 to 10% of binder as a solution of<br>
plasticised ethyl cellulose (PEC) in toluene.<br>
Further according to this invention there is provided a process for<br>
the preparation of pyrotechnic composition for energy rich propellant<br>

Example 1<br>
The plasticised ethyl cellulose (PEC) was prepared by 29% plasticisation of<br>
ethyl cellulose N-200 with diethyl phthalate. A 10 % solution of dried plasticised ethyl<br>
cellulose was prepared using 40g of dried plasticised ethyl cellulose and 400 cm3 of<br>
distilled toluene as solvent in a suitable vesel wth constant stirring to get uniform<br>
solution.<br>
l10.0g of magnesium powder Gr.V with purity more than 95% &amp; 350.0g of<br>
potassium nitrate with particle size between 90 &amp; 53 micrometer were weighed<br>
accurately and mixed on a wax paper using hom spatula. This mix was then sieved 3<br>
times through 600 micrometer sieve for better mixing. In a mixing vessel 50% of<br>
plasticised ethyl cellulose (PEC) solution was taken in which the above mix of<br>
magnesium &amp; potassium nitrate was added carefully avoiding the spillage of material.<br>
The remaining 50% of PEC solution was poured over mix and was thoroughly mixed<br>
using horn spatula to get homogeneous mix.<br>
The mix was poured on conducting polythene sheet kept in a tray and allowed<br>
to become semisolid. The semisolid mass/dough was then granulated by passing<br>
through 25 BSS (600 micrometer) sieve. The sieved granules were then retained on<br>
52 BSS (300 micrometer) sieve and retained material was dried in water jacketed oven<br>
at 60 ± 5° C for 2 to 6 hours to reduce the volatile matter to 
granules were used for characterisation. The qualified granules were used for making<br>
pellets in a pelleting machine using appropriate die &amp; punches. The pellets are used for<br>
further tests.<br>
Example No 2 to 7<br>
In these examples the procedure for preparation is identical to that of example<br>
1 except that magnesium was increased from 27 to 50% while Potassium Nitrate was<br>
reduced from 65 to 42% keeping binder (PEC) constant at 8% by weight. These<br>
formulations are given in Table 1<br>

The ignition temperature evaluated by Micro DTA for all the<br>
examples were found to be in the range from 477°C to 536°C.<br>
The formulated compositions referred at example 1 to 7 were<br>
evaluated at loading density 0.01 g/cc in simple closed vessel (free<br>
volume 700 cc) designed for this purpose. For initiation, these<br>
igniter compositions were initiated smoothly by an electric squib.<br>
The results are given in Table 1. Except the composition in<br>
example 1, all other compositions gave satisfactory pressure-time<br>
(p-t) profile with low ignition delay.<br>
The binder plasticised Ethyl cellulose (8% by weight) gave<br>
satisfactory structural integrity to the granules of the composition.<br>
The composition could be pelleted in different sizes giving pellet<br>
densities in the range of 1.40 to 1.78 g/cm3. The breaking strength<br>
for these pellets was found in the range of 200-250N. The<br>
structural integrity as well as the ballistic performance of these<br>
compositions were found to be satisfactory even five years after<br>
manufacture.<br>
The composition of example 5, using 42% of Mg and 50% of KNO3<br>
was successfully used for ignition of composite and composite<br>
modified double based propellants which delivered smooth p-t<br>
(pressure-time) profile with minimum ignition delay. This<br>
composition is safe to handle, manufacture, pelleting and for<br>
transportation, with the precautions necessary for handling<br>
pyrotechnic compositions.<br>
It is to be understood that the process of the present invention is<br>
susceptible to modifications, adaptations, changes by those skilled<br>
in art. Such modifications, adaptations, changes are intended to be<br>
within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth<br>
under the following claims:-<br>
The ingredient are not chemically in acting but gives synergetic<br>
properties i.e. properties of the end product are synergetic.<br>
