				<td>GAMING APPARATUS AND METHOD OF OPERATING THE SAME<br>
The present invention relates to gaming apparatus and method of operating the<br>
same. It relates for example to electronic gaming machines and to networked gaming<br>
systems, such as Intranet and/or Internet-based gaming systems.<br>
Gaming machines have been a popular form of entertainment for many<br>
years. This popularity has been enhanced by the advent of electronic gaming<br>
machines, and by computer-based gaming systems, such as are provided over the<br>
Internet.<br>
Many different types of game are playable. They include for example standard<br>
slot-machine type games with spinning reels, poker machines, keno, bingo, blackjack,<br>
roulette, pachinko and the like.<br>
A user will typically place a bet, press a button or pull a lever to begin a game,<br>
and will win or lose based upon the gaming machine's play algorithm and random<br>
number generator.<br>
An aim of the present invention is to provide gaming apparatus having<br>
novel features for enhancing gameplay and increasing user participation.<br>
Viewed from one aspect, the present invention provides gaming<br>
apparatus including :<br>
a plurality of roulette wheels ;<br>
input means for allowing a user to place a bet or bets on the plurality of<br>
roulette wheels during a round of betting ;<br>
means for determining the win statuses of the plurality of roulette wheels<br>
after a round of spins ; and<br>
means for displaying the bet outcome, the bet outcome being based on<br>
the input bet and on the win statuses of the roulette wheels.<br>
The invention provides roulette wheel gaming apparatus in which a user may<br>
place a bet on and play more than one roulette wheel per round, and so may play a<br>
number of roulette wheels simultaneously, with e.g. a single bet being duplicated across<br>
all of the wheels.<br><br>
The present invention provides a new approach to playing roulette that can add<br>
extra interest to the game over and above the usual game play. It benefits players by<br>
making the game more interesting, with for example wheels spinning simultaneously,<br>
ball drops taking place in rapid succession, and the<br><br>
possibility of a number of different win options. It also benefits the gaming<br>
operators by helping to increase use of their machines and spin rates.<br>
The wheels themselves may be simulated wheels generated<br>
electronically e.g. with a random number generator determining a winning wheel<br>
slot, and with an animation for wheel spin and ball run and drop. In this case,<br>
the apparatus will include means for simulating a plurality of wheels and for<br>
displaying them upon a gaming screen of the apparatus.<br>
Alternatively, or in combination with virtual wheels, the wheels may be<br>
real physical wheels that e.g. may be provided within a casino or the like. In<br>
this case, the apparatus may include a number of physical roulette wheels<br>
together with electronic betting facilities, e.g. a plurality of betting terminal that<br>
e.g. may be overseen by a central controller. In this case, the spin results from<br>
the tables may be input into the electronic betting facilities. This may be<br>
achieved automatically through electronic detection circuitry associated with the<br>
wheels, or by a croupier or the like entering the winning slots into a suitable<br>
input terminal.<br>
The real roulette wheels may be provided as normal roulette tables or<br>
may be provided by themselves without the usual betting board, etc., as these<br>
can be provided by the electronic betting facilities. The wheels could be<br>
separate from one another or provided on the same table. They may be<br>
human-operated, e.g. by a croupier, or may be automated. They may comprise<br>
a bank of automated wheels linked to a set of user terminals, the wheels being<br>
spun together, e.g. simultaneously or in a set sequence.<br>
The real roulette wheels may be located together, e.g. in a gambling pit,<br>
with a plurality of betting terminals adjacent to them, in which case the user of a<br>
terminal can see all of the wheels. The wheels may also be remote from the<br>
terminals, e.g. spread throughout a casino and/or even in another venue. In the<br>
former case, a terminal need not provide a representation of the wheels<br>
themselves on its screen, as they can be seen, although it may still be<br>
preferable to do so. In the latter case, as a user cannot see the real wheels that<br>
they are playing, the terminal will display the results of the wheel spins, and<br>
may for example display a plurality of virtual wheels that spin and stop in a<br>
manner reflecting the spins on the real wheels. In one embodiment, the<br>
apparatus may display video images of the wheels, e.g. overhead shots of the<br><br>
wheels, e.g. through the use of suitable camera apparatus. These images may<br>
be real time video sequences of the wheels or snap-shots of the wheels after<br>
the ball has dropped into a slot.<br>
The wheels themselves may take any suitable form, and may be of any<br>
standard roulette format, including e.g. the US-style or 00 roulette and the<br>
Australian-style or 0 roulette (double and single zero roulette). The wheels may<br>
also include non-standard symbols/slots.<br>
The number of wheels bet on per round may be fixed, e.g. at three, four<br>
or five wheels, or any other desired number, or may be variable. The number of<br>
wheels played may be selected by the user, and/or may be chosen<br>
automatically, e.g. based on the bet laid, and/or could be decided randomly.<br>
The apparatus may allow a user to chose which of the wheels from a<br>
number of wheels they wish to play, e.g. to allow them to replace a wheel on<br>
which they lose or win by a new wheel. For example, if there are a number of<br>
physical wheels to chose from a user may chose specific ones to bet on.<br>
Physical wheels may be locked out, e.g. when betting is finished on the<br>
table and the result is awaited, or when wins are being assessed and the like.<br>
When a table is locked out, the gaming apparatus will not place a user's bet on<br>
that table, but may still place a bet across the available tables. For example, a<br>
user may input one bet that is repeated or the like across all tables, and, before<br>
placing a second bet, one or more tables may become locked out. The second<br>
bet may then be placed on all of the remaining tables, so that the first bet is<br>
across all tables and the second bet is across a lesser number of tables.<br>
The betting on the plurality of wheels may take any suitable form. An<br>
advantage of the present invention is that all of the wheels may be bet upon<br>
through a single roulette betting board, a bet on the board being repeated or<br>
otherwise allocated across the wheels.<br>
In one preferred form, the same bet amount is replicated across the<br>
wheels. In another embodiment, bets are placed on the wheels according to a<br>
set formula, e.g. a first amount is placed on one wheel, and incrementally higher<br>
or lower amounts are placed on the other wheels. Bet allocation may also<br>
vary depending on the amount and type of a main bet. The bet allocation is<br>
preferably made automatically, without user input, although the latter is<br><br>
possible. The user may for example place the bets manually on the wheels,<br>
e.g. determine the amount and type of bet for each wheel independently.<br>
The invention may in one aspect be seen as allowing a player to bet on a<br>
first main roulette wheel using the associated betting board, and automatically<br>
applying that bet to a number of further roulette wheels that can then all be<br>
played at the same time.<br>
The bet type may take any of the usual forms associated with roulette.<br>
For example, a user may bet on a single (individual number), odd or even, red<br>
or black, high or low, a dozen, a row, a column, a line, a top line, a split, a triple,<br>
a corner or the like. The bet type is preferably repeated across the wheels, so<br>
that e.g. both the bet amount and bet type are repeated. It would also be<br>
possible however to vary the bet type between wheels, this again if applied<br>
being preferably automatic.<br>
The win events that earn a user winnings may be the same as for<br>
standard roulette wheels, e.g. based on standard bet types, and will generally<br>
be separate wheel wins independent of each other. The present invention also<br>
however allows for additional win events based on mystery and bonus events;<br>
and allows win events to be based on the spin results for a number of the<br>
wheels played.<br>
The wheels may be spun in any suitable manner. In one preferred<br>
embodiment, all of the wheels are spun together, and the wheels stop one after<br>
another. They could also however stop at the same time, and/or could start at<br>
different times. One wheel could start as another is finishing. The overlapping<br>
of the spins can increase user interest through the parallel running of wheels, as<br>
well as the bet rate. Stopping the wheels successively would allow a user to<br>
experience the anticipation of each "ball drop" into the slots individually. A<br>
number of "ball drops" one after the other in quick succession can provide an<br>
extra degree of excitement to the game play.<br>
As well as standard roulette style functions, the gaming apparatus may<br>
be provided with bonus features relating to the use of multiple roulette wheels,<br>
e.g. a win event may be based on the results across a number of the roulette<br>
wheels. In another possibility, a free roulette wheel could be provided that will<br>
e.g. automatically repeat a player's roulette bet options on a main wheel.<br><br>
The present invention may be applied to any suitable type of gaming<br>
apparatus or system. It can apply to stand-alone gaming apparatus, e.g.<br>
electronic gaming machines, such as video gaming machines, to gaming<br>
machines that are linked together, e.g. via a network such as an intranet, and/or<br>
to gaming systems provided through computing or other electronic devices, e.g.<br>
personal computers, PDAs, mobile telephones, digital television, and the like,<br>
e.g. over the Internet or other communications networks.<br>
In networked games, the apparatus may include a central control for<br>
conducting games and managing the accounting and the like, and a number of<br>
remote terminals/clients that provide user input and display mechanisms.<br>
The present invention extends to central controls/servers and to remote<br>
terminals/clients that are configured to carry out the roulette gaming of the<br>
present invention.<br>

It should be noted that any of the further aspects mentioned above may include<br>
any of the features mentioned in relation to the first aspect of the present invention.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention will now be described, by way of example<br>
only, with reference to the accompanying drawings. It is to be understood that the<br>
particularity of the drawings does not supersede the generality of the preceding<br>
description of the invention.<br>
In the accompanying drawings :<br>
Figure 1 is a block, diagram of gaming apparatus according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention ;<br>
Figure 2 is a display screen shot showing a game display according to an<br>
embodiment of the present invention ;<br>
Figure 3 is a flow diagram of a gaming control process in accordance<br>
with an embodiment of the present invention ; and<br>
Figure 4 is a block diagram of gaming apparatus according to another<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, gaming apparatus, which in this case takes the form of an<br>
electronic gaming machine (EGM) 1, includes various standard components, such as a<br>
controller 2 for controlling the operation of the EGM 1 and the games run on it, a<br>
coin/token/card input 3 for receiving bets, a coin/token/card output 4 for paying out<br>
winnings, a display 5 for displaying game screens, and a user input 6, including e.g.<br>
buttons 7, for allowing user interaction.<br>
The EGM 1 may be a stand-alone machine. It may also be networked with other<br>
EGMs and/or with a control centre via a suitable communications network 8, such as a<br>
LAN and/or WAN, in order to play networked (e.g. intranet or Internet) games, such as<br>
for example a linked jackpot.<br><br>
In use, the EGM 1 will display an initial gaming screen on the display 5. A player<br>
will insert coins and/or tokens into the EGM input 3, and will press a button 7 to initiate<br>
play and otherwise interact with the game. How matters then proceed will depend on the<br>
game being played.<br>
In roulette, the EGM 1 will display a virtual roulette wheel 9 and a betting board<br>
10. The player selects the amount to bet e.g. using the buttons 7 and selects the type<br>
of bet through the board 10. The type of bet may include any of<br><br>
the standard roulette bets, e.g. a single, odd/even, red/black, split, triple, corner,<br>
row, column, line, top line, dozen, hi/lo or the like.<br>
Once a bet has been placed, the EGM 1 will determine a winning wheel<br>
slot in accordance with a stored gaming algorithm and random number<br>
generator, and will provide an animation of the screen wheel 9 and an<br>
associated roulette ball, e.g. the wheel spins and the ball comes to rest in, or is<br>
just shown in, the winning slot.<br>
The EGM 1 then pays out any winnings in accordance with the bets laid.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the EGM 1 simulates and<br>
displays a number of extra roulette wheels 11 on which bets can also be placed<br>
at the same time as betting on the main wheel 9, e.g. by duplicating the bet<br>
across all of the wheels. Thus, a user is able to bet on and to play multiple<br>
roulette wheels at the same time. The user can bet on all of the wheels during<br>
a single round of betting using the same apparatus and betting board, and the<br>
wheels can be spun together, e.g. in a simultaneous or partly overlapping<br>
manner.<br>
The ability to bet on a number of wheels in one go increases gameplay<br>
for the user. It provides for added excitement and opens the door to further<br>
enhancements, such as win events based across a number of the wheels. It<br>
also benefits the EGM owner, as gaming participation and bet rate can be<br>
increased.<br>
Fig. 2 is a generic screen shot showing one embodiment of how a<br>
roulette game according to the present invention may be implemented. The<br>
screen shot shows the virtual roulette wheels 9 and 11, and a standard<br>
American-style betting board 10 (other styles are possible, e.g. the<br>
Australian/Monte-Carlo style which does not have the "00").<br>
A user of the machine 1 selects a stake amount from their balance using<br>
screen touch buttons 12, and indicates the type of bet on the betting board 10,<br>
e.g. by touching within a specific number or box, or by touching a line or line-<br>
crossing to provide a split, corner or the like. Several bets may be placed at the<br>
same time by repeating the stake selection and board placement.<br>
In one embodiment, a player's bets on the main wheel 9 are repeated on<br>
each of the other wheels 11, so that a bet of $2 on a single on the main wheel<br><br>
becomes a bet of $12 spread over all six wheels - $2 per wheel, each bet on the<br>
same single.<br>
The player then presses the "spin" button 13 to start the wheels 9 and 11<br>
spinning, and the EGM 1 determines the result of the spin for each wheel. The<br>
wheels 9 and 11 may all spin and stop together, or may stop successively in<br>
order to allow the player to experience the anticipation of the "ball drop" for each<br>
wheel independently. The wheels 9 and 11 could also spin in any other suitable<br>
manner relative to one another, e.g. as one stops, another may begin spinning.<br>
Overlapping spins and successive rapid ball drops may provide a particularly<br>
pleasing experience.<br>
The "wheels" button 14 allows a player to determine the number of extra<br>
wheels to play.<br>
Other buttons include a "repeat" button 15 for repeating the bets of a<br>
previous round, a "clear" button 16 for clearing a bet, e.g. if an error has<br>
occurred in the placement, and a "help" button 17 for obtaining instructions on<br>
how to play the game and the like.<br>
The display includes a history window 18 for showing previous spin<br>
results. It also includes a "balance" window 19, a "bet" window 20 and a "win"<br>
window 21 to keep track of a player's bets, and a messaging line 22 for<br>
displaying messages, e.g. from a central control.<br>
As well as repeating the main bet over all of the wheels, other bet<br>
allocation regimes are also possible. For example, bets on the extra wheels 11<br>
may be at set values or may be set at a percentage or increment of the main<br>
bet, and may be higher or lower than the main bet.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a possible flowchart for the processing of a roulette game<br>
by the controller 2. Thus, the invention may be put into effect by the controller 2<br>
running software that incorporates a subroutine executing in the manner shown.<br>
At step S1, the routine displays a start screen e.g. as shown in Fig. 2.<br>
The routine awaits the input of coins, tokens, cards or the like in step S2, and<br>
when the user has deposited a sufficient balance in the machine, the EGM 1<br>
passes to step S3, in which it prompts for the amount to be bet in the current<br>
round of play and the type of bet to be made. Prompting may occur e.g.<br>
through the flashing of the relevant buttons and the like. Thus, a user would<br><br>
select the bet types and amounts that they would like to place, e.g. $5 on 13,<br>
$25 on Red, and $10 on the second Dozen.<br>
Next, the routine prompts at step S4 for the number of wheels to be<br>
played, e.g. the player selects four or five wheels or some other number using<br>
the up/down wheel button 14.<br>
In step S5, the EGM 1 automatically allocates the bets made on the<br>
betting board to each of the wheels. This may be based on the initial bet, and<br>
e.g. each wheel may be allocated the same bet as the main bet or a percentage<br>
or increment thereof, or some other allocation regime may be used. The overall<br>
bet placed in displayed in the "Bet" window 20 at step S6. This step may be<br>
carried out each time the player increases the number of wheels in step S4, so<br>
that if a player has insufficient funds for the number of wheels to be played, then<br>
the number of wheels playable could be suitably restricted.<br>
The allocation of bets across the wheels may be a simple repeat of the<br>
bets for each wheel. In one embodiment, the option is provided of increasing<br>
the amount of the bet for each wheel, e.g. on wheels 1 and 3 a player may play<br>
the initial input amount, whilst on wheel 2 a player may play twice the amount of<br>
the main bets (e.g. the above bet may be $10 on 13, $50 on Red and $20 on<br>
the second Dozen), and on another wheel may play another multiple of the<br>
bets. A Bet Up/Down button may be provided to facilitate this function.<br>
The EGM 1 then waits for the "spin" button 13 to be pressed by the user,<br>
and, in response to the button's activation, in step S7, generates the winning<br>
slots for the wheels 9 and 11 and animates the wheel spins in accordance with<br>
the results. These wheel spins may overlap to a greater or lesser extent,<br>
preferably with the wheel.spins ending in quick succession one after the other.<br>
Once the spins are finished, the EGM 1 determines any winnings for the<br>
user, in step S8, and displays the combined winnings from across the roulette<br>
wheels in the "win" window 21.<br>
The routine finishes in step S9, and the start screen is redisplayed.<br>
The routine may of course vary from the basic form shown, and may<br>
include various validity checks, bonus games and the like, and the step order<br>
may change.<br>
Fig. 4 is a block diagram of a second embodiment, in which the multiple<br>
wheels are provided by a plurality of real (physical) roulette wheels 23, rather<br><br>
than the virtual wheels of the first embodiment. The gaming apparatus includes<br>
the physical wheels 23, as well as associated electronic betting terminals 24.<br>
In this embodiment, the wheels 23 may be provided together in close<br>
proximity to one another in.a gaming pit, with a bank of the betting terminals 24<br>
provided adjacent to them. Thus, a user can see the wheels 23 and can place<br>
bets on all of them together through one of the terminals 24, which may display<br>
a suitable screen for inputting and keeping track of bets. The screen could for<br>
example take the same form as in Fig. 2, with the displayed wheels 9 and 11<br>
mirroring the results of the real wheel spins. Alternatively, no representation of<br>
the wheels need be made.<br>
The gaming apparatus may also include a central control 25 for keeping<br>
track of the bets made through the terminals 24 and for informing the terminals<br>
24 of the wheel spin results. The central control 25 may receive the spin results<br>
of the wheels 23 through croupier terminals 26, into which the croupiers who<br>
spin the wheels 23 can feed the results. Alternatively, the results could be<br>
automatically sensed, e.g. by sensors on the wheels 23 themselves.<br>
The wheels may be human-operated, e.g. by a croupier, or could be<br>
automated. In the latter case, the wheels could for a bank of machines that are<br>
spun simultaneously or in a set sequence.<br>
The betting on physical wheels 23 could be extended so as to cover<br>
betting on wheels in remote locations, which the user cannot observe directly,<br>
so that for example the user could bet on wheels 23 anywhere within a casino<br>
or even in another venue. Although the betting terminals 24 could just display<br>
the results of the various wheel spins, gameplay is improved if a representation<br>
of the remote wheels is provided on the terminal display.<br>
When betting on remote wheels, or even on observable wheels, the<br>
system may provide a real-time video image of the wheels bet upon or a snap-<br>
shot of the wheel when the ball has dropped, so that the user may have<br>
confidence in the result indicated by the terminal 24. Thus, the central control<br>
may receive feed from a video camera 27 that is viewing a wheel. The camera<br>
27 could for example be directly overhead of a wheel 23. Its output could also<br>
be used by e.g. the central control 25 to determine the winning slot number, e.g.<br>
by suitable image processing means.<br><br>
The central control 25 may communicate with various other controllers,<br>
wheels, terminals and the like, e.g. via a suitable network 28, so as to provide<br>
further wheel choice and the like.<br>
The user may be allowed to bet on a mixture of both real and virtual<br>
wheels.<br>
In one embodiment, the user may have a choice of wheels to bet upon,<br>
and may select the wheels to play from a number of possible wheels (e.g. when<br>
playing on real wheels, a user may feel that one wheel is more favourable than<br>
another).<br>
Physical wheels may be locked out, e.g. when all bets on the table have<br>
been placed, and a result is awaited, or when a table is dividing out winnings or<br>
where there is a dispute. In this case, a bet may still be placed on each of the<br>
remaining tables. For example, a first user bet may be placed on all possible<br>
tables in the game, one or more tables may then be locked-out for whatever<br>
reason, and a second user bet may then be placed only on the unlocked tables.<br>
Thus, in one example, one table may have two user bets on it and be just about<br>
to spin, and another table may have only one user bet on it and be in the<br>
process of spinning.<br>
It is to be understood that various alterations, additions and/or<br>
modifications may be made to the parts previously described without departing<br>
from the ambit of the present invention, and that, in the light of the above<br>
teachings, the present invention may be implemented in software, firmware<br>
and/or hardware in a variety of manners as would be understood by the skilled<br>
person.<br>
For example, instead of the gaming apparatus being an EGM, it may<br>
take any other suitable form, and could for example comprise a game provided<br>
on a computing or other electronic device, such as on a personal computer,<br>
PDA, mobile phone, digital television, or the like. The game may also be<br>
provided over an intranet, the Internet, or some other communications system,<br>
such as a mobile telephone system.<br>
As well as automatic betting, it would also be possible to allow manual<br>
setting of bets across the wheels. Also, the types of bet may be varied between<br>
machines, and win events may be linked to the results of more than one wheel,<br>
e.g. a bonus win if a number of the wheels win. Various bonus and/or mystery<br><br>
events could be included, e.g. relating to linked jackpots, and the wheels<br>
themselves could include additional non-standard slots for e.g. bonuses or the<br>
like.<br><br>
