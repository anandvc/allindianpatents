				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>This invention is a permanent calendar comprising of two separate pieces, on pieces i a year indicator that is used to determine the leap or non-leap nature of a year and the day of the week that the 1 Jan of the year in question falls on. After determining the above information from the first peice, the second piece is used to fix the calendar. The principle behind this calendar is the fact that the complexities in the calendar system are such that there is ambiguity in the dating system only up to a fixed number of consecutive years after which everything recurs. The originality of this invention is in the design of the calendar piece and the year indicator piece done in such a way that it is possible for a lay person to set her calendar for any desired year without any calculation</td>

The object of this invention is to make it possible to have a calendar for any year having dates from 1 January to 31 December in the conventional from for ready reference.<br>
A permanent calendar device consisting of two parts: part 1 being the year indicator and part 2 being the date and day indicator with part 1 having two pieces, the back ground piece having leap century marked on the top, first day of a year marked on the right and the foreground piece having year makings on it with opening on the right and the part 2 having two pieces: the background piece having the calendar markings and the foreground having the month and day markings on it with openings to display the calendar in the background is designed.<br>
The novelty of this invention is utilisation of the feature that determining the leap nature of the year and the day associated with the 1 st January of any year determines the calendar fully. This feature enabled the design of a compact permanent calendar to determine the above once a year and fix the calendar subsequently for the year.<br>
The main features of a calendar are date, day, week, monthly and year.<br>
In this design the following facts are used. The fact that the calendar have a periodicity of 10,000 years, meaning that for any year with any number of digits, the calendars are the same if the last four digits for the years agree. For example the calendars for the years 12124321 and 98704321 are the same, because the last four digits agree. This allows the design of the year indicator to look up only years having at most four digits. A given year could be a leap or a non-leap year, meaning that it has either 366 days or 365 days respectively in it. The leap nature of a year is determined using the fact that the year is divisible by the number 4. In the case when the year is divisible by 100 it is not automatically a leap year, it will be a leap year only if it is also divisible by 400.<br>
The number of days in a month are fixed as follows. January, March, May, July, August, October and December have 31 days in them while April, June, September and November have 30 days in them.<br>
February alone has either 29 or 28 days respectively depending upon whether the year is a leap year or not.<br>
In addition there are 7 days, namely Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday and Saturday in a week.<br>
Therefore it is possible to fix the calendar (the table that fixes the day of the week for a given day of the month in the year), for a given year based on whether the year is a leap year or not and after deciding the day of the week on which 1 January of that year falls.<br>
These facts require a design of the calendar appropriately. In this invention the calendar is designed in such a way that we first decide the day of the week that the first day of a given year falls on. After this is done, based on the leap or non-leap nature of the year, we fix the rest of the calendar for the whole year.<br>
The calendar has two parts, the year indicator and the month and day indicator. The year indicator is used to determine the leap or non-leap nature of the year and also the day of the week on which 1 January of that year falls on. Then the calendar for the year is set using the month and day indicator.<br><br>
Working of the Calendar<br>
A device has been evolved for viewing the entire calendar of any year irrespective of whether the year is leap or not.<br>
Drawings<br>
Figure 1: It shows the numerals and their arrangement required for January, February and March months for leap and non-leap years. The top seven rows are intended for non-leap years and the bottom seven rows are intended for leap years.<br>
Figure 2: It shows the numeral and their arrangement required for April to December months which will be common for both leap and non-leap years.<br>
Figure 3:      It shows the front side of the top plate with openings indicated by "W" called windows through which the dates of the months January to December months intended for leap and non-leap years are seen.<br>
Figure 4:      It shows the back of the top plate with strips indicated by "ABC" and "DEF" as the part of the mechanism required for operating the calendar.<br>
Figure 5:      It shows the back side of the bottom two "x" and "y" plates<br>
combined with the strips "G", "H" and "I" and placed on the back side of the top calendar plate.<br>
Figure 6:      It shows the strip "A", "B", "C" (required to be fixed to the back of the top calendar plate shown in Figure 4) in the top portion and the strip "D", "E". "F" (to be fixed to the back side of the top calendar plate) in the bottom portion separating V "y" plates as shown in Figure 5.<br>
Figure 7:      It shows the back of the top and bottom portions of the top and bottom calendar plates required for the operation of the mechanism.<br>
Figure 8:      It shows the grove formed by the "H" and "I" strips fixed on the "x" plate. In this grove the "G" strip (which is fixed to the "y" plate) moves up and down.<br><br>
Figure 9:<br><br>
It shows the arrangement containing the strips "K" (which is fixed to the strip "G") and the strip "J" (which is fixed to the strips "H" and "I").   The strip "J" is intended as a stopper for the strip "K" at which position the entire arrangement is meant for brining the numerals in the "y" plate into the leap year position.<br><br>
Figure 10:    It shows the arrangement to stop the V plate from moving further to the right of a predetermined position on the front side of the calendar.<br>
Figure 11:    It shows the arrangement to stop the "x" plate from moving further to the left of a predetermined position on the front side of the calendar.<br><br>
Figure 12<br><br>
It shows the arrangement for determining the first day of the month of January in any given year. This is called the year indicator. The top plate contains the units and tens of a four digit figure while the bottom plate contains the hundreds and thousands of a four digit figure. It also contains the week day (used for determining the first day of the year).<br><br><br><br>
Figure 13:<br>
Figure 14;<br>
Figure 15:<br><br>
This shows the shape of the top plate containing tens and units of the four digit figure with a window arrangement to see the first day of January of any year.<br>
This shows the shape of the two strips "L" and "R" which are fixed to the "TH" plate at the left and right respectively. In the grove formed by these two strips the "TU" plate moves up and down and the movement is constrained by those shape of the "L" and "R" strips. The strips "1" and "2" are placed above the "L" and "R" plates hiding the above grove.<br>
This shows the shape of the "TU" plate with a opening indicated by "W" called window.<br><br><br><br>
Figure 16:<br>
Figure 17:<br><br>
This shows the calendar for a non-leap year whose first day falls on a Sunday.<br>
This shows the year indicator used to determine the first day of the year. The top four lines are centuries while the bottom collection of numbers denote years and decades.   The figure shows the top edge of the "TU" plate being just below the "TH01" group. In this position, the rows in the "TU" plates show the first day of the corresponding years in the window.<br><br>
Figure 18:    This figure shows the leap centuries on the top edge of the "TU" plate. The group of numbers in the "TU" plate indicate the years and this arrangement is again used to read off the first day of a given year horizontally.   However it is to be noted that the 00 occurring to the right of the years is used to fix the first day of the leap century year (for example year 400, 800 etc., and for all of them it turns out to be a Saturday.)<br>
Figure 19:    This figure shows the calendar for a leap year for which the first day falls on a Saturday.<br>
Figure 20:    This shows the back of the fully assembled calendar. The figure<br>
also shows a L shaped strip denoted "M" which is used to keep the calendar in the leap and non-leap year positions. The figure shows the position of "M" corresponding to a non-leap year. By rotating it in the clockwise direction the calendar moves to a leap year position.<br><br>
The numbers intended for the leap and non-leap years are arranged in 13 columns and 7 rows for each month. These numerals are to be transferred onto a plate (any material prepared in the plate form) by way of printing, embossing, engraving or molding.   In Figure 1, in Sheet 1 of the attached drawings, it can be seen that the numerals are provided for January, February and March months of non-leap year on the top portion of the plate and that of the leap year in the bottom portion separately. This plate hereinafter will be called "y" plate.<br>
«.,"<br>
In the bottom plate also the numerals are arranged for transferring on to a plate in the same way as mentioned in the above paragraph for the rest of the months. In Figure 2, in Sheet 1 of the attached drawings, it can be seen that three groups of months (April, May and June in one group, July, August and September in a second group and October, November and December in the third group) are arranged with space in between the groups. In the same way numerals are arranged in 13 columns and 7 rows for each month. It can also be seen that there is no separate provision for a leap year. This plate hereinafter will be called x" plate.<br>
Thus numerals required for twelve months are placed in two plates.<br>
On top of these two plates a single plate with openings called windows are provided as shown in Figure 4 in Sheet 3 of the attached drawings.   This plate will hereinafter be called "calendar plate". The horizontal length of one side of the "x", "y" and the "calendar plate" are the same. The vertical length of the other side of the "calendar plate" is the sum of the lengths of "x", "y" plates and the widths of two other strips "ABC", "DEF" provided (the strip "ABC" lies between<br><br>
the "x" and "y" plates and the other strip "DEF" lies below the V plate). The two strips mentioned above are provided to hold the V plate in place and enable its movement horizontally as show in Figure 4 in Sheet 3 of the attached drawings. The windows of the "calendar plate" are arranged so that when the 1 January is made to coincide with a Sunday, the window displays the numerals in the last seven columns for each month. On top of each window the name of the month and name of the week day are provided as shown in Figure 3 in Sheet 2 of the attached drawings.<br>
The strips "ABC" and "DEF" provided at the back of the "calendar plate" enable the movement of the "x" and "y" plates so that the numerals in all the 13 columns are visible through the windows, seven columns at a time. This arrangement is intended for non-leap years.<br>
A strip, called "G" strip, is attached at the back of the "y" plate in a predetermined position as shown in Figure 8 in Sheet 6 of the attached drawings.   Strips called "H" and "I" strips are attached to the "x" plate so that they are on either side of the "G" strip.   This mechanism allows for the vertical movement of the "y" plate. In this way "x" plate has a horizontal movement and the "y" plate has both horizontal and vertical movement. These movements are used for positioning the calendar for leap and non-leap years. The "H" and "I" strips are joined by the "J" strip as shown in Figure 10 in Sheet 8 of the attached drawings.   This strip holds the system of "y" plate and the "G" strip in place.   A further strip "K" is attached to the "G" strip as shown in Figure 9, in Sheet 7 of the attached drawings, to constrain the vertical movement of the "y" plate. This mechanism enables the viewing of the leap year months.<br>
Year Indicator<br>
The year indicator consists of two parts, one for the hundreds and thousands and the other for the tens and units. The digits displayed range from 0000 to 9999. The thousands and hundreds are called "TH" numbers and the tens and units are called "TU" numbers henceforth. The "TH" numbers are grouped into four groups and placed in six rows as shown in Figure 12 in Sheet 10 of the attached drawings. The first and the second rows contain the numbers starting with 04 increasing in units of 4 and ending with 00, The second row contains the numbers 03 to 99 increasing in units of 4. The third row is blank. The fourth row contains the numbers 02 to 98 increasing in units of 4 and the fifth row is again blank. The sixth row contains the numbers 01 to 97 increasing in units of 4 again. These rows are named "04 group", "03 group", "02 group" and "01 group" respectively. These groups are shown on the top portion of the TH" plate in Figure 12.   In the same plate to the right of these numbers but starting on the 7th row onwards the days of the week are displayed in the next 12 rows.   The days of the week are written in the order Sunday to Saturday and then Sunday to Thursday, one day per row, starting in row 7 and ending in row 19.   Henceforth<br><br>
the numerical groups in the "TH" plate are referred to by TH followed by the numerical group. Thus the "01" group in the "TH" plate is referred as "TH01" group and so on.<br>
The "TU" plate also has 7 groups of numbers arranged in rows as shown in Figure 13 in Sheet 10 of the attached drawings. The first numbers of each of these groups of numbers are 00, 01, 02, 03, 04, - and 05 respectively. The groups in the "TU" plate are also referred as in the above case by the TU followed by the first number in the group. Thus the groups in this pate are "TUOO", "TU01", "TU02", "TU03", "TU04", "TU-" and "TU05".<br>
The top edge of the "TU" plate comes under the sixth row containing the "01 group" as shown in Figure 17 in Sheet 13 of the attached drawings.   The "TU" plate has a window through which only seven days are visible as can be seen from the Figures 17, in Sheet 13, and Figure 18, in Sheet 14, respectively in the attached drawings.   This year indicator is used for determining the day of the week on which the 1 of January of a given year falls. After determining the day of the week corresponding to the 1 January of a year the remaining calendar is adjusted in the calendar.<br>
Mechanism of the Year Indicator<br>
Two strips "L" and "R" having the shapes showing in Figure 14 in Sheet 11 in the attached drawings, are to be fixed on either side of the "TH" plate, namely "L" on the left side and "R" on the right side as shown in Figure 12 in Sheet 10 of the attached drawings. The "TU" plate has an opening labeled "W" called window as shown in Figure 13 in Sheet 10 of the attached drawings. The positioning of "W" is such that when the top of the "TU" plate is just below the "TH01" group, the "TUOO" group is in the same row as Friday and the "TU05" group is in the same row as Thursday, visible in the window as shown in Figure 17 in Sheet 13 of the attached drawings.<br>
The "TU" plate has the"-" in the place of numerals in all the rows for the following reason. In a non-leap year there are 365 days which is 1 modulo 7. Therefore the last day of the year falls on the same week day as the first day of the year as shown in Figure '16 in Sheet 12 of the attached drawings. However if the year is a leap year, the number of days in the year are 366 which is 2 modulo 7, resulting in the last day of the year being the week day which is subsequent to the week day to which the first day of the year corresponds as shown in Figure 19 in Sheet 15 of the attached drawings. This feature is accommodated in the year indicator through the "-". Therefore in the numerals of the "TU" plate a leap year is located by seeing if there is a "-" just below it. If there is a"-" just below a numeral, then any combination of the "TH" numerals in combination with this number will be a leap year. In case the number being<br><br>
looked up is the last one in a column, the number on top of the column to the right of it is to be checked to see if it contains the"-" and conclude that the number gives a leap year if this is the case.<br>
In the case of a century (that is a year ending in the numerals 00) the day of the week is to be determined differently in the indicator based on the "TH" group to which the first two digits belong. If the first two digits are in a group other than the "TH04" group, the day is determined using the "TUOO" row. In the case of the "TH04" group the row "TU05" is used to determine the day of the week for the first of the year (thus all the leap centuries start on a Saturday only).<br>
How to operate the calendar<br>
For the non-leap year<br>
(i)       Determine the last four digits of the required year, suppose it is 1234. (ii)      Get the first two digits of the above four digits, namely 12. Then place the<br>
top edge of the "TU" plate under the group "TH04" (to which 12 belongs), (iii)      Find the row to which the next two digits, namely 34, belong in the TU<br>
plate. Corresponding to this row, read of the name of the week day (in<br>
this case it happens to be a Sunday), (iv)     Next find out if there is a "-" just below these two digits (that is 34), in this<br>
case it does not, so 1234 is not a leap year, (v)      Next fix the calendar with the 1 January positioned to coincide with<br>
Sunday. This fixes the calendar.<br>
For the leap year<br>
(i)       Suppose the year is 1924.<br>
(ii)      The first two digits are 19, thus place the top edge of the "TU" plate in the<br>
"TH03" group to which belongs, (iii)     The row to which next two digits 24 belong in the TU plate has the day of<br>
the week is a Wednesday.   Also just below 24 we find a "-" so it is a leap<br>
year, (iv)     Next the calendar is fixed by adjusting the "y" plate into the leap year<br>
position and adjusting thel January to be Wednesday.<br>
For the non-leap year<br>
(i)       Suppose the year is 1897.<br>
(ii)      The first two digits are 18, thus place the top edge of the "TU" plate in the "TH02" group to which belongs.<br><br>
(iii) The row to which next two digits 97 belong in the TU plate has the day of the week is a Friday. Also just below 97 we do not find a "-" so it is not a leap year.<br>
(iv) Next the calendar is fixed by adjusting the calendar for the non-leap year position and for the 1 January to be Friday.<br>
For the leap year<br>
(i)       Suppose the year is 23451756. The last four digits are 1756.<br>
(ii)      The first two digits of 1756 are 17, thus place the top edge of the "TU"<br>
plate in the "TH01" group to which belongs, (iii)     The row to which next two digits 56 belong in the TU plate has the day of<br>
the week is a Thursday.   Also 56 is the last number in its column and in<br>
the next column the first row has a"-" so it is a leap year, (iv)     Next the calendar is fixed by adjusting the "y" plate to be in the leap year<br>
position and then 1 January to be Thursday.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
I Claim:<br>
1. A permanent calendar device consisting of two parts : part 1 being the year indicator and part 2 being the date and day indicator with part 1 having two pieces, the background piece having leap century marked on the top, first day of a year marked on the right and the foreground piece having year markings on it with opening on the right and the part 2 having two pieces: the background piece having the calendar markings and the foreground having the month and day markings on it with opening to display the calendar in the background is designed.<br>
