BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates in general to the telecommunications field and, in particular,<br>
to a transceiver system that includes multiple radio base stations (RBSs) that can share an<br>
antenna even if the RBSs share a frequency band and/or even if the RBSs operate with different<br>
radio standards.<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
It is well known when an operator places two or more RBSs in a transceiver system or<br>
adds a new RBS to the transceiver system that the operator would like to have the RBSs share<br>
the same antenna system. An example of a traditional transceiver system with multiple RBSs<br>
that share the same antenna is briefly discussed below with respect to FIGURE 1.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 1 (PRIOR ART), there is shown a block diagram of a traditional<br>
transceiver system 100 described in PCT Patent Application No. WO 92/12579. The traditional<br>
transceiver system 100 includes several base stations (BS1, BS2, BS3...BSn) each of which can<br>
belong to a different type of radio system such as TACS, ETACS and GSM.<br>
The base stations (BS1, BS2, BS3...BSn) are connected to a filter means 102 which in turn is<br>
connected to an antenna 104. The filter means 102 filters the TX signals that are sent over TX<br>
cables 106 from the base stations (BS1, BS2, BS3...BSn) and applies the filtered TX signals to<br>
the antenna 104. The filter means 102 also filters RX signals received by the antenna 104. The<br>
filtered RX signals are then sent to a divider unit 108. The divider unit 108 divides the filtered<br>
RX signals so that separate filtered RX signals can be sent over RX<br>
cables 110 to the base stations (BS1, BS2, BS3...BSn). A drawback of this particular<br>
transceiver system 100 is that each base station (BS1, BS2, BS3...BSn) needs to use<br>
two cables~TX cable 106 and RX cable 110—to share the antenna 104 which adds to the<br>
complexity and cost of the transceiver system 100. It should be noted that U.S. Patent No.<br>
5,781,865 discloses a transceiver system that is similar to and has the same drawbacks as<br>
transceiver system 100. It should be further noted that EP 1320146 discloses a transceiver<br>
system incorporating a diplexer in order to separate bands and standards to bring compatibility<br>
of a shared antenna with multiple radio base stations. Accordingly, there is a need for a<br><br><br>
transceiver system that addresses and solves the aforementioned drawback associated with<br>
the traditional transceiver system 100. This need and other needs are addressed by the<br>
transceiver systems of the present invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention includes a transceiver system that has an antenna coupled to<br>
a filter configuration which is coupled to multiple radio base stations (RBSs). Each RBS<br>
uses one TX/RX cable and if needed a RX cable to connect to the filter configuration. To<br>
enable the RBSs so they can share one antenna, each RBS has a duplex filter incorporated<br>
therein. And, the filter configuration has a unique combination of diplex filter(s), duplex<br>
filter(s), part-band duplex filter(s), diplex-duplex filter(s), splitter(s) and/or low noise<br>
amplifier(s). Four exemplary embodiments of the transceiver system are described below<br>
to show how the filter configuration can be configured so as to enable the RBSs to share<br>
one antenna even if the RBSs share the same frequency band and/or even if the RBSs<br>
operate with different radio standards (e.g., TDMA, CDMA, WCDMA and GSM). The<br>
present invention described herein also includes: (1) a method for constructing the<br>
transceiver system; (2) a radio base station; and (3) an antenna.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to FIGURE 2, there is shown a block diagram that illustrates the basic<br>
components of a transceiver system 200 which has multiple RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn)<br>
that can share one antenna 202 in accordance with the present invention. As shown, the<br>
transceiver system 200 includes an antenna 202 which is coupled to a filter configuration<br>
204 which in turn is coupled to multiple RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn). Each RBS (RBS1,<br>
RBS2...RBSn) uses one TX/RX cable 206 and if needed a RX cable 207 (see FIGURES<br><br><br>
3A and 5A) to connect to the filter configuration 204. To enable the RBSs (RBSl,<br>
RBS2...RBSn) so they can share one antenna 202, each RBS (RBSl, RBS2...RBSn) has a<br>
duplex filter 208 incorporated therein. And, the filter configuration 204 has a unique<br>
combination of diplex filter(s), duplex filter(s), part-band duplex filter(s), diplex-duplex<br>
filter(s), splitter(s) and/or low noise amplifier LNA(s). Four different examples of how the<br>
filter configuration 204 can be configured so as to enable the RBSs (RBSl, RBS2...RBSn)<br>
to share one antenna 202 even if the RBSs (RBSl, RBS2...RBSn) share the same<br>
frequency band and/or even if the RBSs (RBSl, RBS2...RBSn) operate with different<br>
radio standards (e.g., TDMA, CDMA, WCDMA and GSM) are described below with<br>
respect to FIGURES 3-6.<br>
Referring to FIGURES 3A and 3B, there are shown two diagrams associated with<br>
the first embodiment of the transceiver system 200a in accordance with the present<br>
invention. As shown in FIGURE 3A, each of the RBSs (RBSl, RBS2...RBSn) have two<br>
branches (branch A and branch B). This is done since the transceiver system 200a<br>
typically has three sectors and each sector normally has two separate antennas 202a' and<br>
202a" with two separate RX branches so as to obtain the proper "RX diversity gain". The<br>
need for "RX diversity gain" comes from the fact that in nature a radio signal "bounces"<br>
on different things (e.g., buildings, mountains) and this leads to problematical multipath<br>
fading. And, one way to lower the influence of multipath fading is to install two or more<br>
antennas 202a' and 202a". The antennas 202a' and 202a" can be place 3-4m apart from<br>
one another or the antennas 202a' and 202a" can be made to have a 90° phase difference<br>
between themselves. However it should be appreciated that this transceiver system 200a<br>
or any of the other transceiver systems described herein can also have just one branch and<br>
one antenna like was shown in transceiver system 200 (see FIGURE 2).<br>
For clarity branch A of transceiver system 200a is described first and then a brief<br>
discussion is provided about branch B which has essentially the same filter configuration<br>
as branch A. As shown in FIGURE 3A, the transceiver system 200a includes an antenna<br>
202a' which is coupled to a filter configuration 204a' that in turn is coupled to branch A of<br>
multiple RBSs (RBSl, RBS2...RBSn). Each RBS (RBSl, RBS2...RBSn) uses one TX/RX<br>
cable 206a and if needed one RX cable 207a to connect to the filter configuration 204a'.<br><br><br>
To enable the RBSs (RBSl, RBS2...RBSn) so they can share one antenna 202a', each RBS<br>
(RBSl, RBS2...RBSn) has a duplex filter 208a incorporated therein. And, the filter<br>
configuration 204a' has a unique configuration which in this embodiment includes a diplex<br>
filter 302, one or more duplex filters 304 and 305 and a splitter 306. A detailed discussion<br>
is provided next on how the filter configuration 204a' is configured so as to enable the<br>
RBSs (RBSl, RBS2...RBSn) to share one antenna 202a even if the RBSs (RBSl,<br>
RBS2...RBSn) share the same frequency band and/or even if the RBSs (RBSl,<br>
RBS2...RBSn) operate with different radio standards (e.g., TDMA, CDMA, WCDMA and<br>
GSM).<br>
Referring to the filter components associated with RBSl and RBS2 shown in<br>
transceiver system 200a, the filter configuration 204a' includes the diplex filter 302, the<br>
duplex filter 304 and the splitter 306. The diplex filter 302 includes a full-band receiver<br>
(RX) filter 308 and two part-band transceiver (TX) filters 310 and 312. As can be seen,<br>
the full-band RX filter 308 is coupled to part-band TX1 filter 310. The duplex filter 304<br>
includes a RX filter 314 and a TX filter 316. The TX filter 316 is coupled to the part-band<br>
TX2 filter 312 located in the diplex filter 302. The first RBSl and in particular the duplex<br>
filter 208a incorporated therein uses a TX/RX cable 206a to connect to the full-band RX<br>
filter 308 and first part-band TX1 filter 310 in the diplex filter 302. In addition, the first<br>
RBSl also includes a LNA 318 and a coupler 320 that interfaces with the splitter 306 via<br>
the RX cable 207a. In this way, the splitter 306 can couple a RX signal received from the<br>
full-band RX filter 308 in the diplex filter 302 to the RX filter 314 in the duplex filter 304.<br>
It should be appreciated that the splitter 306 is used if more than one RBS is co-sited in the<br>
transceiver system 200a. The second RBS2 and in particular the duplex filter 208a<br>
incorporated therein uses a TX/RX cable 206a to connect to the duplex filter 304. The<br>
RBS2 also includes a LNA 318. In view of this filter configuration, RBSl can receive a<br>
RX signal applied to the antenna 202a' by way of the splitter 306 and transmit a TX signal<br>
within a TX1 band using the antenna 202a'. Whereas, RBS2 can receive a RX signal<br>
applied to the antenna 202a' and transmit a TX signal within a TX2 band using the antenna<br>
202a'.<br><br><br>
For each RBS in addition to RBSl and RBS2 that is within or added to the<br>
transceiver system 200a, the filter configuration 204a' and in particular the diplex filter<br>
302 would include another part-band transceiver (TX) filter 322 (shown as TX3 filter<br>
322). The part-band TX3 filter 322 is coupled to the antenna 202a'. The filter<br>
configuration 204a' would also include another duplex filter 305. The duplex filter 305<br>
includes a RX filter 324 and a TX filter 326. The TX filter 326 is coupled to the part-band<br>
TX3 filter 322 in the diplex filter 302. The additional RBS (shown as RBSn) and in<br>
particular the duplex filter 208a incorporated therein uses a TX/RX cable 206a to connect<br>
to the duplex filter 305. The RBSn also includes a LNA 318. In view of this filter<br>
configuration, RBSn can receive a RX signal applied to the antenna 202a' by way of the<br>
splitter 306 and transmit a TX signal within a TX3 band using the antenna 202a'. The<br>
same filter scheme associated with filter configuration 204a' is used to make filter<br>
configuration 204a" which is associated with branch B of the RBSs (RBSl, RBS2...RBSn)<br>
that share antenna 202a".<br>
Referring to FIGURE 3B, there is a diagram showing exemplary frequency<br>
allocations for each of the antennas 202a' and 202a" in transceiver system 200a. It is<br>
possible to see how the RBSs (RBSl, RBS2...RBSn) can share the same frequency band<br>
and can operate with different radio standards (e.g., TDMA, CDMA, WCDMA and GSM)<br>
simply by selecting the appropriate RX and TX filters. For instance, it can be seen that<br>
RBSl branch A can operate on one standard using TX1 while RBSl branch B can operate<br>
in the same or another standard using TX4. And, it can be seen that RBSl branch A and<br>
RBSl branch B have RX diversity because both have the same RX band. Moreover, it<br>
should be appreciated that if the RBSs (RBSl, RBS2...RBSn) use different standards then<br>
there must be guardbands in the frequency allocation to separate the TX bands otherwise<br>
there will be interactions between the TXs. These guardbands could be very narrow<br>
however there is going to be a tradeoff between insertion loss and guardband attenuation.<br>
Referring to FIGURES 4A and 4B, there are shown two diagrams associated with<br>
the second embodiment of the transceiver system 200b in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Like in the first embodiment of the present invention, transceiver system 200b<br>
and in particular each of the RBSs (RBSl, RBS2...RBSn) have two branches (branch A<br><br><br>
and branch B). For clarity branch A of transceiver system 200b is described first and then<br>
a brief discussion is provided about branch B which has essentially the same filter<br>
configuration as branch A.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 4A, the transceiver system 200b includes an antenna 202b'<br>
which is coupled to a filter unit 204b' that in turn is coupled to branch A of multiple RBSs<br>
(RBS1, RBS2...RBSn). Each RBS (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) uses one TX/RX cable 206b to<br>
connect to the filter unit 204b'. To enable the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) so they can<br>
share one antenna 202b', each RBS (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) has a duplex filter 2008b<br>
incorporated therein. And, the filter unit 204b' has a unique configuration which in this<br>
embodiment includes a part-band duplex filter 402. A detailed discussion is provided next<br>
on how the filter unit 204b' is configured so as to enable the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn)<br>
to share one antenna 202b' even if the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) share the same<br>
frequency band and/or even if the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) operate with different<br>
radio standards (e.g., TDMA, CDMA, WCDMA and GSM).<br>
Referring to the filter components associated with RBS1 and RBS2 shown in<br>
transceiver system 200b, the filter unit 204b' includes the part-band duplex filter 402<br>
which is coupled to the antenna 202b'. The part-band duplex filter 402 includes two part-<br>
band receiver (RX) filters 404 and 406 and two part-band transceiver (TX) filters 408 and<br>
410. As can be seen, the first part-band RX1 filter 404 is coupled to the first part-band<br>
TX1 filter 408. And, the second part-band RX2 filter 406 is coupled to the second part-<br>
band TX2 filter 410. The first RBS1 and in particular the duplex filter 208b incorporated<br>
therein uses a TX/RX cable 206b to connect to the first part-band RX1 filter 404 and first<br>
part-band TX1 filter 408 in the part-band duplex filter 402. In addition, the first RBS1<br>
also includes a LNA 412 which is coupled to the duplex filter 208b. The second RBS2<br>
and in particular the duplex filter 208b incorporated therein uses a TX/RX cable 206b to<br>
connect to the second part-band RX2 filter 406 and second part-band TX2 filter 410 in the<br>
part-band duplex filter 402. The second RBS2 also includes a LNA 412 which is coupled<br>
to the duplex filter 208b. In view of this filter unit, RBS1 can receive a RX signal within a<br>
RX1 band that is applied to the antenna 202b' and transmit a TX signal within a TX1 band<br>
using the antenna 202b'. Whereas, RBS2 can receive a RX signal within a RX2 band that<br><br>
is applied to the antenna 202b' and transmit a TX signal within a TX2 band using the<br>
antenna 202b'.<br>
For each RBS in addition to RBS1 and RBS2 that is within or added to the<br>
transceiver system 200b, the filter unit 204b' and in particular the part-band duplex filter<br>
402 would include another part-band receiver (RX) filter 414 (shown as RX3 filter 414)<br>
and another part-band transceiver (TX) filter 416 (shown as TX3 filter 416). The part-<br>
band RX3 filter 414 is coupled to part-band TX3 filter 416. The additional RBS (shown<br>
as RBSn) and in particular the duplex filter 208b incorporated therein uses a TX/RX cable<br>
206b to connect to the part-band RX3 filter 414 and part-band TX3 filter 416 in the part-<br>
band duplex filter 402. In addition, the RBSn also includes a LNA 412 which is coupled<br>
to the duplex filter 208b. The same filter scheme associated with filter unit 204b' is used<br>
make filter unit 204b" which is associated with branch B of the RBSs (RBS1,<br>
RBS2...RBSn) that share antenna 202b".<br>
Referring to FIGURE 4B, there is a diagram showing exemplary frequency<br>
allocations for each of the antennas 202b' and 202b" in transceiver system 200b. It is<br>
possible to see how the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) can share the same frequency band<br>
and can operate with different radio standards (e.g., TDMA, CDMA, WCDMA and GSM)<br>
simply by selecting the appropriate RX and TX filters. For instance, it can be seen that<br>
RBS2 branch A can operate on one standard using TX2 while RBS2 branch B can operate<br>
in the same or another standard using TX5. And, it can be seen that RBS2 branch A and<br>
RBS2 branch B do not have RX diversity because both have different RX bands where<br>
RX2 does not match RX5.<br>
Referring to FIGURES 5A and 5B, there are shown two diagrams associated with<br>
the third embodiment of the transceiver system 200c in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Like in the first two embodiments of the present invention, transceiver system<br>
200c and in particular each of the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) have two branches (branch<br>
A and branch B). For clarity branch A of transceiver system 200c is described first and<br>
then a brief discussion is provided about branch B which has essentially the same filter<br>
unit as branch A.<br><br><br>
As shown in FIGURE 5A, the transceiver system 200c includes an antenna 202c'<br>
which is coupled to a filter configuration 204c' that in turn is coupled to branch A of<br>
multiple RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn). Each RBS (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) uses a TX/RX<br>
cable 206c and if needed one RX cable 207c to connect to the filter configuration 204c'.<br>
To enable the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) so they can share one antenna 202c', each RBS<br>
(RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) has a duplex filter 208c incorporated therein. And, the filter<br>
configuration 204c' has a unique configuration which in this embodiment includes a<br>
diplex-duplex filter 502 and may have a splitter 504 (if there are more than one cosited<br>
RBS). A detailed discussion is provided next on how the filter configuration 204c' is<br>
configured so as to enable the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) to share one antenna 202c'<br>
even if the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) share the same frequency band and/or even if the<br>
RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) operate with different radio standards (e.g., TDMA, CDMA,<br>
WCDMA and GSM).<br>
Referring to the filter components associated with RBS1 and RBS2 shown in the<br>
transceiver system 200c, the filter configuration 204c' includes the diplex-duplex filter<br>
502 and the splitter 504. The diplex-duplex filter 502 includes two full-band receiver<br>
(RX) filters 506 and 508 and two part-band transceiver (TX) filters 510 and 512. As can<br>
be seen, the first full-band RX filter 506 is coupled to the first part-band TXl filter 510.<br>
And, the second full-band RX filter 508 is coupled to the second part-band TX2 filter 512<br>
but is not coupled to the antenna 202c'. The first RBS1 and in particular the duplex filter<br>
208c incorporated therein uses a TX/RX cable 206c to connect to the full-band RX filter<br>
506 and first part-band TXl filter 510 in the diplex-duplex filter 502. In addition, the first<br>
RBS1 also includes a low noise amplifier (LNA) 514 and a coupler 516 that interfaces<br>
with the splitter 504 via the RX cable 207c. In this way, the splitter 504 can couple a RX<br>
signal received from the full-band RX filter 506 in diplex-duplex filter 502 to the RX filter<br>
508 in diplex-duplex filter 502. The second RBS2 and in particular the duplex filter 208c<br>
incorporated therein uses a TX/RX cable 206c to connect to the second full-band RX filter<br>
508 and second part-band TX2 filter 512 in the diplex-duplex filter 502. The second<br>
RBS2 also includes a LNA 514. In view of this filter unit, RBS1 can receive a RX signal<br>
applied to the antenna 202c' and transmit a TX signal within a TXl band using the antenna<br><br><br>
202c'. Whereas, RBS2 can receive a RX signal applied to the antenna 202c' by way of the<br>
splitter 504 and transmit a TX signal within a TX2 band using the antenna 202c'.<br>
For each RBS in addition to RBS1 and RBS2 that is within or added to the<br>
transceiver system 200c, the filter configuration 204c' and in particular the diplex-duplex<br>
filter 502 would include another full-band receiver (RX) filter 518 (shown as RX filter<br>
518) and another part-band transceiver (TX) filter 520 (shown as TX3 filter 520). The<br>
full-band RX filter 518 is coupled to part-band TX3 filter 520 but is not coupled to the<br>
antenna 202c'. The additional RBS (shown as RBSn) and in particular the duplex filter<br>
208c incorporated therein uses a TX/RX cable 206c to connect to the diplex-duplex filter<br>
502. The RBSn also includes a LNA 514. In view of this filter unit, RBSn can receive a<br>
RX signal applied to the antenna 202c' by way of the splitter 504 and transmit a TX signal<br>
within a TX3 band using the antenna 202c'. The same filter scheme associated with filter<br>
configuration 204c' is used to make filter configuration 204c" which is associated with<br>
branch B of the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) that share antenna 202c".<br>
Referring to FIGURE 5B, there is a diagram showing exemplary frequency<br>
allocations for each of the antennas 202c' and 202c" in transceiver system 200c. It is<br>
possible to see how the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) can share the same frequency band<br>
and can operate with different radio standards (e.g., TDMA, CDMA, WCDMA and GSM)<br>
simply by selecting the appropriate RX and TX filters. For instance, it can be seen that<br>
RBS1 branch A can operate on one standard using TX1 while RBS1 branch B can operate<br>
on the same or another standard using TX4. And, it can be seen that RBS 1 branch A and<br>
RBS1 branch B have RX diversity because both have the same RX band.. It can be seen<br>
that RBS2 can work in the adjacent band with a different standard.<br>
In comparing transceiver systems 200a and 200c, it should be noted that<br>
transceiver system 200c has a lower insertion loss (~1dB) than transceiver system 200a.<br>
Because, the TX signals transmitted from the RBS2s pass through one filter 512 in the<br>
transceiver system 200c and pass through two TX filters 312 and 316 in the transceiver<br>
system 200a. Also, it should be noted that transceiver system 200c uses one diplex-duplex<br><br><br>
filter 502 while transceiver system 200a uses a diplex filter 302 and a separate duplex<br>
filter 304 per branch.<br>
Referring to FIGURES 6A and 6B, there are shown two diagrams associated with<br>
the fourth embodiment of the transceiver system 200d in accordance with the present<br>
invention. Like in the first three embodiments of the present invention, transceiver system<br>
200d and in particular each of the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) have two branches (branch<br>
A and branch B). For clarity branch A of transceiver system 200d is described first and<br>
then a brief discussion is provided about branch B which has essentially the same filter<br>
unit as branch A.<br>
As shown in FIGURE 6A, the transceiver system 200d includes an antenna 202d'<br>
which is coupled to a filter unit 204d' that in turn is coupled to branch A of multiple RBSs<br>
(RBS1, RBS2...RBSn). Each RBS (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) uses a TX/RX cable 206d to<br>
connect to the filter unit 204d'. To enable the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) so they can<br>
share one antenna 202d', each RBS (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) has a duplex filter 208d<br>
incorporated therein. And, the filter unit 204d' has a unique configuration which in this<br>
embodiment includes a diplex-duplex filter 602 and may have a low noise amplifier<br>
(LNA) 604 with a splitter function. A detailed discussion is provided next on how the<br>
filter unit 204d' is configured so as to enable the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) to share one<br>
antenna 202d' even if the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) share the same frequency band<br>
and/or even if the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) operate with different radio standards (e.g.,<br>
TDMA, CDMA, WCDMA and GSM).<br>
. Referring to the filter components associated with RBS1 and RBS2 shown in the<br>
transceiver system 200d, the filter unit 204d' includes the diplex-duplex filter 602, the<br>
LNA 604 and a splitter function. The diplex-duplex filter 602 includes two full-band<br>
receiver (RX) filters 606 and 608 and two part-band transceiver (TX) filters 610 and 612.<br>
As can be seen, the first full-band RX filter 606 is coupled by way of the LNA 604 to the<br>
first part-band TXl filter 610. And, the second full-band RX filter 608 is coupled to the<br>
second part-band TX2 filter 612 but is not coupled to the antenna 202d'. The first RBS1<br>
and in particular the duplex filter 20 8d incorporated therein uses a TX/RX cable 206d to<br><br><br>
connect to the LNA 604 and the first part-band TX1 filter 610 in the diplex-duplex filter<br>
602. In addition, the first RBS1 also includes a low noise amplifier (LNA) 614. The LNA<br>
604 can couple a RX signal received from the full-band RX filter 606 in diplex-duplex<br>
filter 602 to the RX filter 608 in diplex-duplex filter 602. The second RBS2 and in<br>
particular the duplex filter 208d incorporated therein uses a TX/RX cable 206d to connect<br>
to the second full-band RX filter 608 and second part-band TX2 filter 612 in the diplex-<br>
duplex filter 602. The second RBS2 also includes a LNA 614. In view of this filter unit,<br>
RBS1 can receive a RX signal applied to the antenna 202d' by way of the LNA 604 and<br>
transmit a TX signal within a TX1 band using the antenna 202d'. Whereas, RBS2 can<br>
receive a RX signal applied to the antenna 202d' by way of the LNA 604 and transmit a<br>
TX signal within a TX2 band using the antenna 202d'.<br>
For each RBS in addition to RBS1 and RBS2 that is within or added to the<br>
transceiver system 200d, the filter unit 204d' and in particular the diplex-duplex filter 602<br>
would include another full-band receiver (RX) filter 618 (shown as RX filter 618) and<br>
another part-band transceiver (TX) filter 620 (shown as TX3 filter 620). The full-band RX<br>
filter 618 is coupled to the LNA 604 and the part-band TX3 filter 620 but is not coupled to<br>
the antenna 202d'. The additional RBS (shown as RBSn) and in particular the duplex filter<br>
208d incorporated therein uses a TX/RX cable 206d to connect to the diplex-duplex filter<br>
602. The RBSn also includes a LNA 614. In view of this filter unit, RBSn can receive a<br>
RX signal applied to the antenna 202d' by way of the LNA 604 and transmit a TX signal<br>
within a TX3 band using the antenna 202d'. The same filter scheme associated with filter<br>
unit 204d' is used to make filter unit 204d" which is associated with branch B of the RBSs<br>
(RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) that share antenna 202d".	<br>
Referring to FIGURE 6B, there is a diagram showing exemplary frequency<br>
allocations for each of the antennas 202d' and 202d" in transceiver system 200d. It is<br>
possible to see how the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) can share the same frequency band<br>
and can operate with different radio standards (e.g., TDMA, CDMA, WCDMA and GSM)<br>
simply by selecting the appropriate RX and TX filters. For instance, it can be seen that<br>
RBS1 branch A can operate on one standard using TX1 while RBS1 branch B can operate<br>
on the same or another standard using TX4. And, it can be seen that RBS1 branch A and<br><br><br>
RBS1 branch B have RX diversity because both have the same RX band. It can be seen<br>
that RBS2 can work in the adjacent band with a different standard.<br>
In comparing transceiver systems 200c and 200d, it is noted that transceiver system<br>
200d does not have a coupler 516 and accompanying RX cable 207c in the RBS1 nor does<br>
it have the splitter 504 like shown in transceiver system 200c. However, the transceiver<br>
system 200d does have an additional active component LNA 604 outside of the RBSs.<br>
Moreover, the transceiver system 200d and in particular the RBS1 has a slightly worse RX<br>
performance than the RBS1 in transceiver system 200c.<br>
It should be appreciated that in all of the filter configurations described above that<br>
a "Tower mounted amplifier" (TMA) (not shown) could be easily incorporated therein if<br>
needed. And, in FIGURES 3A and 5A where the filter configurations included a splitter<br>
there is however another way of implementing this splitting function and that is to install 2<br>
couplers in the RBS.<br>
It should be understood that certain details and components associated with<br>
transceiver systems 200a, 200b, 200c and 200d are well known in the industry. Therefore,<br>
for clarity, the description provided above omitted those well known details and<br>
components of the transceiver systems 200a, 200b, 200c and 200d that are not necessary<br>
to understand the present invention. Lastly, it should be understood that a diplex filter<br>
normally filters signals in one band (e.g., 1900 band) from another band (e.g., 800 band).<br>
And, a duplex filter filters a TX band from a RX band.<br>
Referring to FIGURE 7, there is a flowchart illustrating the steps of a preferred<br>
method 700 for constructing the transceiver system 700 shown in FIGURES 2, 3A, 4A,<br>
5A and 6A in accordance with the present invention. Beginning at step 702, one antenna<br>
202 is provided for each branch of the RBSs used in the transceiver system 200. At step<br>
704, a filter configuration 204 is provided that has a unique combination of diplex filter(s),<br>
duplex filter(s), part-band duplex filter(s), diplex-duplex filter(s), splitter(s) and/or LNA(s)<br>
(see FIGURES 3A, 4A, 5A and 6A). At step 706, at least two radio base stations RBSs<br>
(RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) are provided where each RBS (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) has a duplex<br><br><br>
filter 208 incorporated therein. Each RBS (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) and in particular each<br>
duplex filter 208 is coupled to the filter configuration 204 which is configured in a manner<br>
that enables all of the RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) to share the antenna 202 even if the<br>
RBSs (RBS1, RBS2...RBSn) share a frequency band and even if the RBSs (RBS1,<br>
RBS2...RBSn) operate with different radio standards (e.g., TDMA, CDMA, WCDMA and<br>
GSM). Four exemplary configurations of the filter configuration 204 have been described<br>
above with respect to FIGURES 3-6.<br>
Although four embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated in the<br>
accompanying Drawings and described in the foregoing Detailed Description, it should be<br>
understood that the invention is not limited to the embodiments disclosed, but is capable of<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br><br>
TRANSCEIVER SYSTEM INCLUDING MULTIPLE RADIO BASE STATIONS<br>
THAT SHARE AN ANTENNA<br>
A transceiver system is described herein that has an antenna coupled to a filter unit<br>
which is coupled to multiple radio base stations (RBSs). Each RBS uses one TX/RX cable<br>
and if needed a RX cable to connect to the filter unit. To enable the RBSs so they can<br>
share one antenna, each RBS has a duplex filter incorporated therein. And, the filter unit<br>
has a unique combination of diplex filter(s), duplex filter(s), part-band duplex filter(s),<br>
diplex-duplex filter(s), splitter(s) and/or low noise amplifier(s). Four exemplary<br>
embodiments of the transceiver system are described herein to show how the filter unit can<br>
be configured so as to enable the RBSs to share one antenna even if the RBSs share the<br>
same frequency band and/or even if the RBSs operate with different radio standards (e.g.,<br>
TDMA, CDMA, WCDMA and GSM). Also described herein in accordance with the<br>
present invention are: (1) a method for constructing the transceiver system; (2) a radio<br>
base station; and (3) an antenna.</td>
