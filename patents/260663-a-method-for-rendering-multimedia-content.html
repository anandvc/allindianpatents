TITLE: SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MOBILE TELEPHONE AS AUDIO GATEWAY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method for rendering multimedia content between a multimedia storage source and a mobile telephone and/or a rendering device (e.g., a headset).<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Mobile telephones have evolved from voice-only electronic devices to multi-fimctional electronic devices. For example, mobile telephones may now function as electronic organizers, digital cameras, audio applications (e.g., MP3 players), video applications (e.g., video players), video game terminals, etc. Moreover, mobile telephones are not only used for voice communications, but they also are used in a variety of other forms (e.g., in instant messaging applications, sharing photographs, gaining access to information on the Internet, etc).<br>
As the mobile telephone has evolved, so too have accessories for mobile telephones. For example, the first mobile telephones required the user to hold the telephone next to the user's mouth and ear during use. Later, a wired ear bud and microphone were developed that connected to the mobile telephone were developed. The wired ear bud allows the user's hands to be free from holding the mobile telephone during use. Wireless headsets have also been developed that provide the user with both wireless and hands-free convenience.<br>
A wireless interface commonly used in headsets and mobile telephones is referred to as "Bluetooth" technology. Bluetooth refers to a technical specification designed to standardize wireless transmission between a wide variety of electronic devices, such as personal computers, mobile telephones, headsets, printers, personal digital assistants ("PDAs"), etc. Bluetooth acts as a "virtual cable", whereby one elecfronic device can easily communicate with another electronic device.<br>
Bluetooth operates using frequency-hopping spread spectrum, where data packets are spread across the 2.45-GHz Spectrum at a rate of 1,600 hops per second to lessen interference. For Bluetooth devices, the nominal link range is 10 meters and the gross data rate is up to 3 Mbps, although higher data rates have been proposed for fiiture versions of the standard. Bluetooth can support both synchronous connection oriented ("SCO") links for voice and asynchronous connectionless ("ACL") liiJcs for packet data.<br>
Wireless local area networks ("WLANs") are now ubiquitous in everyday life. Such WLAN's are commonly available in many public areas (so-called "hotspots" or "hotzones"), as well as in homes and office environments. WLANs are generally compliant with one or more IEEE standards (e.g., 802.1 la, 802. lib, 802.11 g, etc.) and are easily configured to provide for open access or to limit access by authorization and link-level security procedures.<br>
End users generally access the WLAN through WLAN adapters that may be implemented as a removable or fully embedded component in a stationary, portable or fully mobile device. Examples of such implementations in a desktop computer include ISA or PCI cards, as well as an external or removable USB adapter. Typical implementations for laptop computers include removable PCMCIA cards or embedded PCI Express or USB adapters, while typical implementations for PDAs and mobile telephones include removable SO Cards or embedded with USB or SDIO interconnections. In addition, the physical WLAN adapter is typically augmented with software (a "driver") that allows the device's operating system to manage the adapter and to create a transparent connection to the wireless network that can be used by various applications to the benefit of the end user.<br><br>
Conventional methods for facilitating communication between mobile telephones and mobile telephone accessories (e.g., headsets, hands-free kits, etc.) are generally capable of receiving signals received directly from the mobile telephone. In the case of wireless communication between the mobile telephone and the mobile telephone accessory, a Bluetooth compatible protocol is often times utilized. With the Bluetooth implementation, media may be received by the mobile telephone is generally provided in an IETF protocol (e.g. SIP, SDP, RTP, TCP, UDP, etc.). Once received by the mobile telephone, the streammg media is converted into a Bluetooth-specific protocol (e.g., advanced audio distribution profile A2DP) and then transmitted to the rendering device (e.g., a headset). Converting the streaming media to a Bluetooth-specific protocol limits the functionality of the mobile telephone in a variety of ways, for example, limits the functionality of the rendering device, limits the ability of the user to use the mobile telephone for multiple tasks, limits the battery life of the mobile telephone, etc.<br>

The audio data received by the headset 14 may also originate from one or more devices associated with a WLAN and transmitted and/or streamed to the headset 14 for listening by the user, as described below. In yet other situations, the audio data may be associated with video content displayed on the display 18 by the mobile telephone 12. For example, a video file containing an audio component stored in the memory 20 may be played back by the mobile telephone 12 or a video signal containing an audio component may be received by the mobile telephone 12.<br>
In these situations, a video component of the video file or received video signal may be decoded by, for example, the control circuit 30 or dedicated video decoder (not shown) to generate a video signal output to the display 18 for viewing. The audio component of the video file or received video signal may be decoded and delivered as an audio signal to the speaker 22 and/or the audio component may be transmitted as audio data to the headset 14 for decoding into an audio signal that is broadcast by the speaker 24. In another embodiment, the audio component of the video file or received video signal may be transmitted as audio data directly to the headset 14 from one or more devices associated with a local area network, without fransmission to the mobile telephone 12, for decoding into an audio signal that is broadcast by the speaker 24.<br>
As explained in detail below, audio data transmitted from the mobile telephone 12 to the headset 14 and/or transmitted from one or more devices associated with a WLAN to the headset 14 is typically in the form of media packets. Each media packet may contain a quantity of audio data, such as about 5 milliseconds of audio data. The audio data may be buffered by the buffer 62 and decoded by the decoder 60 into an audio signal for delivery to the speaker 24. As will be appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, the audio data may be mono, stereo or surround-sound, or arranged in any other suitable audio format.<br>
An exemplary communication network 100 in accordance with aspects of the present invention is illustrated in Figure 3. The exemplary network illustrated in Figure 3 is a public wireless local area network, which utilizes Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) protocols (e.g., IP, TCP, UDP, RTP, HTTP and the like) between the endpoints (e.g., the streaming source and rendering device (e.g., headset)). In this illustration, the mobile telephone 12 acts as a gateway or proxy for routing content (e.g., audio files, video files, etc.) stored on the server 102 through one or more routers 104 and an IP network 106, which may be any suitable network to a destination source. From the IP network 106 and, optionally, router 104, the multimedia content is fransmitted to wired LAN 108, routed to the ACCESS POINT 110, and output to the destination source (e.g., mobile telephone 12 and/or rendering device 14) in a wireless manner.<br>
Although the server 102 is shown as bemg outside of the wired LAN 108, this is for illustrative purposes only. One of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that the server 102 may be located within the wired LAN 108 depending on the specific requirements of the server 102 and/or the LAN 108 or can be on a remote network that is connected to LAN 108 via the Internet. One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that the exemplary LAN 108 may be a wireless local area network, a wide area network, personal-area access technology (e.g., wireless local area network, cellular network, WiMax, ulfra wideband network, etc.) and/or a public network (e.g., the Internet).<br><br>
As shown in Figure 3, the LAN 108 is communicatively couple to the access point 110. Access point 110 provides wireless communication medium between the mobile telephone 12 and/or headset 14 to the LAN 108. Thus, the mobile telephone 12 and/or headset 14 are communicatively coupled to the server 102.<br>
One of ordinary skill m the art will appreciate that the communication medium between devices take the form of any medium that permits electronic devices to exchange information or data. For instance, the communication medium may be a wired communications medium, such as Ethernet, or a wireless communication medium, such as IEEE 802.11(a), 802.11(b) or 802.11(g). In addition, the communication medium may also be a combination of wired and wireless communications mediums. One of ordinary skill in the art will also appreciate that any communications medium allowing the functionality described herein shall be deemed to be within the scope of the present invention. Preferably the communication medium can support a variety of network protocols including, for example, lETF-compatible protocols (e.g., IP, TCP, UDP, RTP, HTTP and the like)<br>
Figure 4 illustrates a schematic block diagram of an exemplary server (e.g., server 102). The server 102 may be any type of server. Preferably, the server 102 is a media server that is compatible with protocols developed by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) (e.g., IP, TCP, UDP, RTP, HTTP and the like). The server 102 generally includes a processor 110, a memory 112, a data storage medium 114, a local interface 116, video and input/output interfaces 118, and various communication interfaces 120. The server 102 may include optionally a display 122, a keyboard 124, and a user input device 126 (e.g., a computer mouse).<br>
The server 102 is capable of executing one or more computer applications 128 in accordance with aspects of the present invention.   In one embodiment, computer applications 128 include at least one audio and/or video application program that is capable of transmitting multimedia content (e.g., audio files, video files, audiovisual files, photographs, slides, radio, streaming audio and/or video, etc.) in a user-sensible format upon request from an associated user. The multimedia content may be stored in the data storage medium 114 or a remote storage medium (not shown) that is communicatively coupled to the WLAN 100.<br>
As stated above, the multimedia content may take any form (e.g., audio, video, photographs, streaming audio and/or video and the like) and may be stored in any suitable format (e.g., MPEG, AVI, MP3, JPG, TIFF, and the like). The server 102 may also store communications software, which is capable of converting the multimedia content stored on the server 102 and/or the remote storage medium to a format that can be rendered locally and/or remotely by the requesting device and/or a peripheral device associated with the requesting device (e.g., headset 14). Alternatively, the server 102 may provide the multimedia content in a known format and allow the requesting device and/or a peripheral device associated with the requesting device to perform any necessary conversion.<br>
The computer application 128 may be logically associated with or call one or more additional computer applications or one or more sub-computer applications 130, which generally include compilations of executable code. In one embodiment, the computer application 128, and/or the sub-applications 130 are embodied as one or more computer programs (e.g., one or more software applications including compilations of executable code). The computer program(s) can be stored on a data storage medium or other computer readable medium, such as a magnetic or optical storage device (e.g., hard disk, CD-ROM, DVD-ROM, etc.).<br>
To execute the computer application 128 and associated sub-applications 130, the server 102 can include one or more processors 110 used to execute instructions that carry out a specified logic routine(s).<br><br>
Preferably, the server 102 is based on a client - server architecture and may serve multiple clients. However, one of ordinary skill in the art will readily appreciate that any combination of computers having the functionality described herein shall be deemed to be withm the scope of the present invention. As stated above, the server 102 may be a media server that is compatible with IETF protocols (e.g., IP, TCP, UDP, RTF, HTTP and the like).<br>
The server 102 may have a memory 112 for storing data, software, logic routine instructions, computer programs, files, operating system instructions, multimedia content and the like. As illustrated in Figure 4, the computer application 128 and sub-applications 130 can be stored in the memory 112. The memory 112 can comprise several devices and includes, for example, volatile and non-volatile memory components. Accordingly, the memory 112 can include, for example, random access memory (RAM), read only memory (ROM), hard disks, floppy disks, compact disks (e.g., CD ROM, DVD ROM, CD RW, etc.), tapes, and/or other memory components, plus associated drives and players for these memory types. The processor 110, memory 112, and the data storage medium 114 are coupled using a local interface 116. The local interface 116 can be, for example, a data bus with accompanying control bus, a network, or other subsystem.<br>
The server 102 can have various video and input/output interfaces 118 as well as one or more communication interfaces 120. The interfaces 118 can be used to couple the server 102 to various peripherals, such as a display 122 (e.g., a CRT display, an LCD display, a plasma display, etc.), a keyboard 124, and a user input device 126. The communications interfaces 120 can be comprised of, for example, a modem, a network interface card, and/or a wireless network interface card. The communications interfaces 130 can enable the server 102 to transmit and receive multimedia content (e.g., audio files, video files, photographs and the like) via an external network, such as the Internet, a wide area network (WAN), a local area network (LAN), direct data link, or similar wired (e.g., Ethernet) or wireless system (e.g., 802.11-compliant protocols). Preferably, the system 100 has the capabilities for both a wired conmiunications interface (e.g., Ethernet) and a wireless communications interface (e.g., 802.11-compliant protocols) to accomplish the fimctionality described herein.<br>
The server 102 transmits and receives information (e.g., multimedia content, data, requests for information, etc.) to and from peripherals and/or devices that comprise the LAN 106. The LAN 106 generally includes any electronic device that is capable of communicating (e.g., receiving and/or transmitting information) with any other device, including the network 100. The mobile telephone 12 and/or headset 14 are portable devices that may access one or more services provided by the network 100, through WLAN interface adapters 52 and 60, respectively.<br>
As shown in Figure 3, the network 100 includes wireless communication from the LAN 108 to the mobile telephone 12 and/or headset 14 through access point 110 and one or more intermediary devices (e.g. access point 110, routers 104, IP network 106, etc.). Mobile telephone 12 is provided with a communication protocol that can be executed by an internal processor of the device and/or by dedicated communications hardware (e.g., a transceiver) coupled to the device for communication with the access point 110. The WLAN adapter 52 of the mobile telephone generally includes a built-in antenna (not shown). The antenna allows the WLAN adapter 52 to exchange signals with the wireless access point 110. The access point 110 generally executes a communication protocol corresponding to the communication protocol executed by the client devices (e.g., device associated with the LAN 108 and/or the mobile telephone 12. The access pomt 110 also includes<br><br>
communications hardware (e.g., a transceiver with an antenna) for broadcasting signals to the various client devices and receiving signals broadcast by the client devices.<br>
Figures 5A and 5B illustrate an exemplary IETF standard protocol stacks implemented for the mobile telephone 12 and the headset 14, respectively.  Referring to Figure 5A, an exemplary protocol stack is illustrated for mobile telephone 12. The protocol stack 150 may include: a network layer 152, a WiFi layer 154 and a Bluetooth stack 153. The network layer 152 includes a logic link layer 155, an Internet Protocol (IP) layer 156, a user datagram protocol (UDP) layer 158, a transport control protocol (TCP) layer 160, and a data link control protocol (DLCP) layer 162. The WiFi layer 154 includes an 802.11 radio frequency (RF) layer 164, an 802.11 physical (PHY) layer 166 and an 802.11 medium access control (MAC) layer 168. The network layer 152 and the WiFi layer 154 communicate with an authentication and security module 170. Likewise, the Bluetooth stack 153 may also communicate with the network layer 152 and the authentication and security module 170<br>
Referring to Figure 5B, an exemplary protocol stack 180 is illustrated for headset 14. The protocol stack 180 includes: a network layer 182, a WiFi layer 184 and a Bluetooth stack 185. The network layer 182 includes a logic link layer 186, an Internet Protocol (IP) layer 188, a user datagram protocol (UDP) layer 190, a transport control protocol (TCP) layer 192 and a Real Time Transport Protocol/ Real Time Control Protocol (RTP/RTCP) layer 194. The WiFi layer 184 includes an 802.11 radio frequency (RF) layer 196, an 802.11 physical (PHY) layer 198 and an 802.11 medium access control (MAC) layer 200. The headphone 14 is capable of receiving and rendering Bluetooth signals and WiFi signals through the respective layers (e.g.., Bluetooth stack 185, WiFi layer 184).<br>
The mobile telephone 12 also includes dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) and network address translation (NAT) server functionality that is typically found in a network gateway. In this manner, devices peripheral to the mobile telephone 12, such as the headset 14 are treated as a subnet that is "hidden" to the network beyond the gateway. By using DHCP and NAT, respectively, the mobile telephone assigns subnet IP addresses to the peripherals and directs incoming IP traffic (e.g., streaming audio) from the network to the proper peripheral(s) based on the assigned subnet addresses.<br>
An exemplary method 250 in accordance with aspects of the present invention is illustrated in Figure 6. Referring to Figures 3 and 6, at step 252, the user associates the headset 14 with the mobile telephone 12. The headset 14 is designated as the audio sink endpoint (e.g., rendering device) for rendering one or more audio components transmitted from server 102. The headset 14 becomes part of the private subnet and receives an IP address from the DHCP server of the mobile telephone 12.<br>
At step 254, the mobile telephone 12 requests access to the network 100 through the access point 110. The request may include a session description protocol (SDP) payload field, which may specify, for example, negotiation parameters, services requested, format of information, etc. In the exemplary system illusfrated in Figure 3, a public WLAN 100 is provided, wherein the user must be authenticated prior to access to the network 100. Accordingly, at step 256, the request is routed to the AAA server 109 by one or more redirect servers and/or proxy servers (not shown). The AAA server 109 provides authentication services to the public network 100. Assuming the user is properly authenticated, the user is provided access to the network 100, at step 258. If the user is unable to properly authenticate him or herself, the user is denied access to the public network 100.<br><br>
At Step zou, an lUentitication of available services and/or devices is provided to the mobile telephone 12. Once network access is established, at step 262, the user of the mobile telephone 12 may identify desired audio content and/or devices on a remote server 102. For example, this could be content stored on server 102 (e.g., a personal server, a personal computer in a home, a media server, etc. or content from a commercial music service (e.g., iTunes, operator portal, etc.)). The user selects the desired content to stream and initiates a streaming session with the server 102. The mobile telephone 12 also configures the headset 14 to accept the pending media flow from the server 102.<br>
At step 264, the server transmits the audio to the mobile telephone 12 using conventional IETF protocols (e.g., RTF, UDP and IP) over the network 100. At step 266, the mobile telephone 12 then forwards these packets to the headset 14, using NAT to establish the correct address for the headset 14 in the internal subnet. At step 268, the headset 14 unpacks, decodes and renders the sfreaming audio in a user-sensible formal through one or more speakers 24.<br>
In this example, session confrol is managed by the mobile telephone 12 while the media sfream is established between the server and headset. Session control may occur between local interface adapters 58 and 50 of the headset 14 and the mobile telephone 12, respectively. Session control may also occur between WLAN interface adapters 60 and 52 of the headset and the mobile telephone 12, respectively. Steps 252 through 268 are generally repeated whenever a new session is started. The exemplary method 250 utilizes WLAN interface adapters 52 and 60 to stream audio from the server 102 to the headset 14.<br>

niLE: SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MOBILE TELEPHONE AS AUDIO GATEWAY<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system and method for rendering multimedia content between iviultlniedia storage source and a mobile telephone and/or a rendering device (e.g., a headset),<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
Mobile telephones have evolved from voice-only electronic devices to multi-functional electronic dtsvices. For example, mobile telephones may now function as electronic organizers, digital cameras, audio op|)licotions (e.g., MP3 players), video applications (e.g., video players), video game terminals, etc. Moreover, mobile telephones are not only used for voice communications, but they also are used in a variety of other forms (e.g., in instant messaging applications, sharing photographs, gaining access to information on the Internet, etc).<br>
As the mobile telephone has evolved, so too have accessories for mobile telephones. For example, the (Irst mobile telephones required the user to hold the telephone next to the user's mouth and ear during use. Liitcr, a wired ear bud and microphone were developed that connected to the mobile telephone were developed. 1*he wired ear bud allows the user's hands to be free from holding the mobile telephone during use. Wireless i^eadsets have also been developed that provide the user with both wireless and hands-free convenience.<br>
A wireless interface commonly used in headsets and mobile telephones is referred to as "Bluetooth" lechnology. Bluetooth refers to a technical specification designed to standardize wireless transmission between a wide variety of elecfronic devices, such as personal computers, mobile telephones, headsets, printers, personal digital assistants ("PDAs"), etc. Bluetooth acts as a "virtual cable", whereby one electronic device can easily communicate with another electronic device.<br>
Bluetooth operates using frequency-hopping spread spectrum, where data packets are spread across the 2.45-GHz Spectrum at a rate of 1,600 hops per second to lessen interference. For Bluetooth devices, the nominal link range is 10 meters and the gross data rate is up to 3 Mbps, although higher data rates have been proposed for future versions of the standard. Bluetooth can support both synchronous connection oriented ("SCO") links for voice and asynchronous connectionless ("ACL") links for packet data.<br>
Wireless local area networks ("WLANs") are now ubiquitous in everyday life. Such WLAN's are commonly available in many public areas (so-called "hotspots" or "hotzones"), as well as in homes and office environments. WLANs are generally compliant with one or more IEEE standards (e.g., 802.1 la, 802.1 lb, 802.1 Ig, etc.) and are easily configured to provide for open access or to limit access by authorization and link-level security procedures.<br>
End users generally access the WLAN through WLAN adapters that may be implemented as a removable or fully embedded component in a stationary, portable or fully mobile device. Examples of such implementations in a desktop computer include ISA or PCI cards, as well as an external or removable USB adapter, Typical implementations for laptop computers include removable PCMCIA cards or embedded PCI Express or USB adapters, while typical implementations for PDAs and mobile telephones include removable SD Cards or embedded with USB or SDIO interconnections. In addition, the physical WLAN adapter is typically augmented with software (a "driver") that allows the device's operating system to manage the adapter and to create a transparent connection to the wireless network that can be used by various applications to the benefit of the end user.<br><br>
Conventional methods for facilitating communication between mobile telephones and mobile telephone accessories (e.g., headsets, hands-free kits, etc.) are generally capable of receiving signals received directly from the mobile telephone. In the case of wireless communication between the mobile telephone and the mobile telephone accessory, a Bluetooth compatible protocol is often times utilized. With the Bluetooth implementation, media may be received by the mobile telephone is generally provided in an IETF protocol (e.g. SIP, SDP, RTP, TCP, UDP, etc.). Once received by the mobile telephone, the streaming media is converted into a Bluetooth-specific protocol (e.g., advanced audio distribution profile A2DP) and then transmitted to the rendering device (e.g., a headset). Converting the streaming media to a Bluetooth-specific protocol limits the lliiictionality of the mobile telephone in a variety of ways, for example, limits the fxinctionality of the rendering device, limits the ability of Ihe user to use the mobile telephone for multiple tasks, limits the battery life of the iiKibile telephone, etc.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is directed to a system and method for rendering multimedia content between one or more devices associated with a wireless local area network or a wide area network and a mobile telephone and/or mobile telephone accessory. The mobile telephone acts as a gateway or proxy for routing multimedia content (e.g., audio files, video files, etc.) stored on a remote server.<br>

Figures 5A and 5B illustrate an exemplary IETF standard protocol stacks implemented for the mobile telephone 12 and the headset 14, respectively.  Referring to Figure 5A, an exemplary protocol stack is illustrated for mobile telephone 12. The protocol stack 150 may include: a network layer 152, a WiFi layer 154 and a Bluetooth stack 153. The network layer 152 includes a logic link layer 155, an Internet Protocol (IP) layer 156, a user datagram protocol (UDP) layer 158, a transport control protocol (TCP) layer 160, and a data link control protocol (DLCP) layer 162. The WiFi layer 154 includes an 802.11 radio frequency (RF) layer 164, an 802.11 physical (PHY) layer 166 and an 802.11 medium access control (MAC) layer 168. The network layer 152 and the WiFi layer 154 communicate with an authentication and security module 170. Likewise, the Bluetooth stack 153 may also communicate with the network layer 152 and the authentication and security module 170<br>
Referring to Figui-e 5B, an exemplary protocol stack 180 is illustrated for headset 14. The protocol stack 180 includes: a network layer 182, a WiFi layer 184 and a Bluetooth stack 185. The network layer 182 includes a logic link layer 186, an Internet Protocol (IP) layer 188, a user datagram protocol (UDP) layer 190, a transport control protocol (TCP) layer 192 and a Real Time Transport Protocol/ Real Time Control Protocol (RTP/RTCP) layer 194. The WiFi layer 184 includes an 802.11 radio frequency (RF) layer 196, an 802.11 physical (PHY) layer 198 and an 802.11 medium access control (MAC) layer 200. The headphone 14 is capable of receiving and rendering Bluetooth signals and WiFi signals through the respective layers (e.g.., Bluetooth slack 185, WiFi layer 184).<br>
The mobile telephone 12 also includes dynamic host configuration protocol (DHCP) and network address translation (NAT) server functionality that is typically found in a network gateway. In this manner, devices peripheral to the mobile telephone 12, such as the headset 14 are treated as a subnet that is "hidden" to (he network beyond the galeway. By using DHCP and NAT, respectively, the mobile telephone assigns subnet 1? addresses to the periphoials and directs incoming IP fraffic (e.g., streaming audio) from the network to the proper peripheral(s) based on the assigned subnet addresses.<br>
An exemplary molhod 250 in accordance with aspects of the present invention is illusfrated in Figure 6. Referring to Figures 3 and 6, at step 252, the user associates the headset 14 with the mobile telephone 12. The headset 14 is designated an the audio sink endpoint (e.g., rendering device) for rencfering one or more audio coniponents transmitted fiom server 102. The headset 14 becomes part of the private subnet and receives an IP nddress from the DHCP sorver of the mobile telephone 12.<br>
At step 254, the mobile telephone 12 requests access to the network 100 tlirough the access point 110. Tho request may include a session description protocol (SDP) payload field, which may specify, for example, ncgolialion parameters, sei vices requested, format of information, etc. In the exemplary system illusfrated in I'lgure 3, a public WLAN 100 is provided, wherein the user must be authenticated prior to access to the network 100. Accordingly, at step 256, the request is routed to the AAA server 109 by one or more redirect servers (tncl/or proxy servers (not shown). The AAA server 109 provides authentication services to the public network 100. Assuming the user IH properly authenticated, the user is provided access to the network 100, at step 258. If the user is unable to properly authenticate him or herself, the user is denied access to the public network 100.<br><br>
At step 260, an identification of available services and/or devices is provided to the mobile telephone 12. Once network access is established, at step 262, the user of the mobile telephone 12 may identify desired Siiiidio content and/or devices on a remote server 102. For example, this could be content stored on server 102 (e.g., a personal server, a personal computer in a home, a media server, etc. or content from a commercial music service (e.g., iTunes, operator portal, etc.)). The user selects the desired content to stream and initiates a streaming session with the server 102. The mobile telephone 12 also configures the headset 14 to accept the pending media flow from the server 102.<br>
At step 264, the server transmits the audio to the mobile telephone 12 using conventional IETF protocols (e.g., RTP, UDP and IP) over the network 100. At step 266, the mobile telephone 12 then forwards these packets to the headset 14, using NAT to establish the correct address for the headset 14 in the internal subnet. At step 268, the headset 14 unpacks, decodes and renders the streaming audio in a user-sensible format llirough one or more speakers 24.<br>
In this example, session control is managed by the mobile telephone 12 while the media stream is established between the server and headset. Session control may occur between local interface adapters 58 and 50 of the headset 14 and the mobile telephone 12, respectively. Session control may also occur between WLAN interface adapters 60 and 52 of the headset and the mobile telephone 12, respectively. Steps 252 through 268 are generally repeated whenever a new session is started. The exemplary method 250 utilizes WLAN interface adapters 52 and 60 to stream audio from the server 102 to the headset 14.<br>
