Method for Uplink Power Prediction and Calling Admission. Control for Mixed Service of Mobile Communication System<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a management method for the wireless resource of an uplink mixed service of a controlling radio network controller (CRNC) in a wide-band code division multiple access (WCDMA) mobile communication system, more particularly, to a method for fast call admission control of an uplink mixed service of a WCDMA system. The present invention belongs to the domain of communication technology.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
In a WCDMA (wide-band code division multiple access) system, the concept of soft capacity means that the generation of each new call will increase the interference level for all other existing calls and depress their communication quality. Therefore it is very important to controlling the access of user to network in a proper way, which is named call admission control (CAC). The CAC exists in the RRM module in a CRNC in accordance with 3GPP(3rd Generation Partner Project).<br>
The aim of the fast power control of the uplink in a WCDMA system consists in: the uplink transmit power of user equipment (UE) is adjusted by the downlink transmit power control (DL TPC) bit, so that the quality factor Ei/No of the signal received by a base station can match the quality of service (QoS) of the corresponding service. The mapping relationship between E\JNQ and QoS can be obtained by an actual measurement after simulation. Although different UEs have different distances to the base station and different transmit powers, as long as the types of service are the same, the Et/N
 <br>
The ultimate capacity of an uplink cell of a WCDMA system is limited by the total interference level received by the cell. With respect to a WCDMA system with interference restriction, the aim of downlink admission control consists in: it is determined to admit or refuse a new user call, a new radio access bearer (RAB) and a new radio link (RL) based on the current resource condition of the system (such as under switching). The admission has to be controlled on the basis of interference and radio measurement. Making sure the system is stable, the QoSof the new call should be achieved as much as possible to avoid overload.<br>
The paper, "A Call Admission Algorithm for Multiple Class Traffic in CDMA Systems", (IEEE VTC Fall 2000, Boston Sept.24-28, 2000, 4.7.1.5.), which is written by Keunyoung Kim, etc, introduces a method for the admission control of downlink (forward link) and uplink (reverse link) when there are several kinds of services in a cell of a CDMA system, and this method defines a power ratio between different services on the basis of the signal-to-interference ratios (SIR) corresponding to the services with different bit rates. It is determined by an equivalent user number for voice service in its uplink admission control, and the equivalent user number for voice service pointed out by this method is related to the voice service model adopted by the system, however, not suitable for WCDMA systems.<br>
United States Patent 6,278,882 (August 21, 2001), "Call Control Method in Base Station of CDMA Mobile Radio Communication System", which is filed by Choi, etc, introduces a call control method for CDMA mobile radio communication systems, in which the uplink ultimate capacity of a voice service is obtained by a test within a predetermined period, then the threshold for new access and switching access is further calculated, and the result of admission judgment is determined on the basis of the estimation for the influence possibly applied to the system load by the call access. With respect to this invention, it does not perform the prediction for the system load of the new call access on the basis of the real system load and the QoS of the call respectively, and does not take the interference restriction into consideration as well; in addition, it does not illustrate how to operate the program rapidly and effectively in detail.<br>
In Chinese Patent Application NO.97104491, "code division multiple access communication systems based on communication quality to control access mode" (publication number, 1173771, inventor, UEDA TETSUO), the data corresponding to the quality of the downlink signal<br><br>
measured by a terminal in a predetermined interval is sent to the base station as downlink signal quality data in order to control the access of the terminal in the code division multiple access communication system, The base station also measures the data corresponding to uplink signal quality in a predetermined interval and forms the uplink signal quality data. A base station control apparatus determines the communication quality of the service area of the base station from the uplink and the downlink signal quality, and sends an access restriction signal to the base station when the determined communication quality is bad, and then the base station implements engagement processing to the new calls sent to or from other mobile radio terminals, since the patent does not predict the increment of the uplink interference power of the system on the basis of the QoS of a call request, it is not suitable for WCDMA systems.<br>
The reference "WCDMA for UMTS JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS, LTD, 2000" written by Harri Holma, etc, introduces an uplink call admission control method which aims at single service and is based on the load factor and interference. If the new total interference level is above the threshold, a new user will not be admitted by theuplink admission control algorithm:<br>
ltotal.old+A 1    yJ threshold<br>
An admission control method for uplink real-time service requires: 1. A total interference power received by a base station, which includes the interference from other users in the cell, the interference from adjacent cells and background noise; 2. A fast and effective estimation for the interference possibly applied to the call request service; 3. Determining the interference threshold for different services in consideration of various factors. The total interference power received by the base station can be measured from the base station, but it is difficult to predict the increment of cell interference power caused by new services under the condition of mixed services. It needs considering the following factors to determine the interference threshold for different services: the capability of uplink User Equipment (UE) QoS, the QoS of the services connected to the system and switching margin. In addition, the hardware resource condition of NodeB is also a factor considered by uplink admission control.<br>
In the reference "WCDMA for UMTS JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS, LTD, 2000" written by Harri Holma, etc, two methods are adopted to estimate A I, one is from differential, the other is from integral. Both of the methods have considered the load curve for single service, but do not relate to a mixed service.<br><br>
Furthermore, in the reference "WCDMA for UMTS JOHN WILEY &amp; SONS, LTD, 2000" written by Harri Holma, etc, it does not illustrate how to determine the interference threshold for different services and how to calculate between the variants represented by decibel (dB) or dBrn rapidly, while an incorrect operational method between these variants will reduce much efficiency of the admission control.<br>
In addition, the PCT patent application (PCT/CN02/00694) filed on September 28, 2002 by the same applicant as the present application introduces a method for "Prediction of Uplink Received Main Power and Admission Control in CDMA System", the entire content of which is hereby incorporated here for reference.<br>

The uplink call admission control in a wide-band code division multiple access mobile communication system is an important part of the radio resource management module in CRNC. It is required that the uplink admission control method can estimate the increment of the interference power received by the base station after a new service access with accuracy, at the same time the method can not be too complicated and has practical solutions for detailed questions, in order to ensure the QoS of the original services in the system and the QoS of the new service, as well<br><br>

The key point to the uplink admission control method for the mixed service in a wide-band code division multiple access mobile communication system consists in how to pre-estimate the increment of the interference power received by the base station after a new call request being accessed rapidly and efficiently, and with theoretical analysis and lots of simulation it is found that the features of the call services and the load condition of the system as well as the hardware resource of the base station, and so on should be taken into consideration synthetically to predict the increment of the interference power of the base station, furthermore, the solution for the details such as the non-linear calculation between the non-integer variables in the admission control method will also influence the efficiency of the admission control method greatly.<br>
With the method of the present invention, the increment of the interference power received by the base station when a mixed service being accessed is predicted by means of the system load curve for single service and on the basis of the features of the mixed service system, and in this method, the influence of the factors such as the resource restriction of base station hardware,  the restriction of the interference power<br><br>
received by the base station and the access priority are taken into synthetical consideration firstly, and the increment of the interference power received by the base station after a new call being accessed based on the features of services and the practical situation of cell load, furthermore, the solution for the details such as the non-linear calculation between the non-integer variables is pointed out, as a result, compared with the prior art, the method of the present invention can achieve the uplink admission control in a wide-band code division multiple access mobile communication system more accurately and faster to save accessing time, increase the uplink capacity of the system, and reduce the lost call rate and the drop rate, which makes the method have a real use value.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The detailed description of the present invention will now be described with reference to the drawings and detailed practical cases.<br>
Each one of the above-mentioned four classes of services is divided into corresponding subclasses in accordance with different data rates. The present invention is on the basis of 3GPP TS-R99 series specifications.<br>
As shown in Fig 1, 2 and 3, the uplink admission control method of the present invention is as following;<br>
The description for the pre-configuration of the related parameters of the<br><br>
admission  control,   the  scaling  of   the  non integer   variable  and  the auxiliary algorithm is given firstly.<br>
Step 1; imputing call request and related parameters. The related parameters are input in accordance with a real-time measured value.<br>

The following parameters are pre-configured in background based on network planning, simulation and the result of route measurement.<br>
The related parameters of each service subclass. The service can be divided into different service subclasses on the basis of QoS and the data rate of the service, the resulted service subclasses have N kinds, and N can be adjusted based on the practical situation such as the service provided by the service provider, etc. The quality factor for each service subclass can be determined based on the block error ratio (BLER) corresponding to the QoS of the corresponding service class and the data rate.<br>
The related parameters of No. j service subclass are as following: a quality factor 3Bb/N0, which relates to the QoS of the corresponding service subclass and is configured when a mobile station is moving with a low speed; a voice activity factor J°, which relates to the voice service; a load estimation factor JCt , which relates to the  service  subclass,<br>

The background noise power is N0; the interference factor applied to the<br>
present cell from other cells is i, which relates to the ratio between the load condition of the present cell and those of adjacent cells, and can be estimated by other algorithms based on the load condition of adjacent cells.<br>
Step 2: determining NodeB hardware barrage<br>
1.	Determining whether the state of NodeB is "not available", if it is "not available", refusing the call, otherwise going to next step;<br>
2.	Based on the dedicated channels capacity consumption law assigned by NodeB and the spread factor (SF) of the service, determining whether the following formula is true:<br>
UL Capacity Credit - UL cost&gt;=0<br>
Wherein, UL Capacity Credit represents the existing hardware resource credit of NodeB, and UL cost represents the hardware resource credii required by the present call.<br>
If the formula is true, it will enter into a next step; otherwise it will refuse the access request.<br><br>
Step 3: determining uplink interference restriction<br>
The main aim of Step 3 is to determine whether the following formula is true:<br>
t total -old"*" &amp; t     ^ ithreshold<br>
The step in detail is as following:<br>
1.	Determining I threshold based on the priority, if the call request is a high<br>
Priority       Service,       threshold      =±threshold-hshpriority,       otherwise       I threshold      -<br>
J- threshold-Iowpriority •<br>
2.	Predicting for A7/: Based on a lot of simulation data and theoretical<br>
analysis it has been found that when the total wide-band powers received<br>
by the system are the same, whatever the actual telephone traffic of the<br>
system, the slope for this point of the interference power curve of mixed<br>
service is approximately equal to the slope for this point of the<br>
interference power curve of single service, as a result, the A7/ of mixed<br>
service can be predicted based on of the interference power curve of<br>
single service:<br><br><br><br><br>
wherein,   n= l- N0 / Itoui.ou,  JCL is the load estimation factor of<br>

DeltI01_LEV can be determined in accordance with table 1 (DeltI01_LEV_Base table) and the scaling value of N{) illustrated later with the following way:<br>
DeltI01_LEV=DeltI01_LEV_Base(RTWP_LEV+N0_LEV) -N0-LEV<br>
 Table 1<br><br><br><br><br>
3. Determination for uplink admission control. If Itoui.0id+DJI&gt;=1rttnMhou , refusing the call request, otherwise going to next step.<br>
The implement of the above-mentioned prediction for A-7 and determination for uplink admission control can be divided into several parts as following in a RNC system:<br>
Scaling for non-integer variable<br>
D Scaling for RTWP, and RTWP is the total wide-band power received by the base station.<br>
If RTWP 
If-50.0 
If-112.0<rtwp></rtwp>
RTWP _LEV=floor ((RTWP - (-112.0))/0.1+1),<br>
Wherein, floor( • ) represents lower limit rounding.<br>
D Scaling for DeltI01<br>
If DeltI01 -130.0, DeltI01_LEV = 0, .   If-50.0 
DeltI01_LEV=floor ((DeltI01- (-130.0))/0.1 + 1), Wherein, floor(® ) represents lower limit rounding.<br>
,4.9<br><br>
Scaling for<br><br>
iV<br><br>
If A'0
If-97.0 
If-108.0 
NO _LEV = floor ((N0- (-108.0))/0.1+1),<br>
Wherein, floor( ® ) represents lower limit rounding.<br>
D    composing    the    DeltI01 _LEV_Base    table    on    the    basis    of N0 = - 108dBm,<br>
the data in the odd lines of table 1 are the scaling values of N0 (0 ~ 621 ): N0JLEV, and the data in the odd lines of table 1 are the corresponding values of DeltI01 LEV-Base (160 ~ 800), the data in the table are calculated with the following way:<br><br>
Wherein,  n = 1- N0 / Iiol.i.oid<br>
N0: background noise power;<br>
I total: total wide-band power received by base station;<br>
It can be noticed that DeltI01 is a duality function. The relationship between DeltI01 and I total can be obtained by fixing N0 = - 108dBm, and then the DeltI01 LEV-Base table can be obtained by respectively scaling the two variables of this relationship, DeltI01 and I total, and representing I total and DeltI01 in the form of table as the independent variable and the dependent variable respectively, so that the DeltI01 corresponding to an arbitrary value of NO can be obtained through a derivation on the basis of this table: DeltI01-LEV=DeltI01-LEV-Base(RTWP-LEV+N0-LEV) - N0_LEV<br>
D Scaling for load estimation factor JCL If JCL 
If-130.0 
 <br><br>
(2) Auxiliary algorithm<br>
The aim of the auxiliary algorithm is to improve the operation efficiency of summing (or differencing) the variables in dBm (or dB) by the system. The algorithm in detail is as following:<br> Since the variables (with dimensions or without dimensions) have different scales adopted in scaling, a public nominal large enough to cover all possible ranges is defined firstly. The public nominal of physical quantity x is given as following: If x
■ i'£i-<br><br>
X:__LEV_N = o,<br>
otherwise X_LEV_N = floor((x--(~160.0))/0.1 + l)s Wherein, floorf ® ) represents lower limit rounding.<br>
The relationship between X_LEV_N and X_LEV is as following:<br>
X_LEV_N = X-LEV x (step/step_n) + (floor_x- floor_x_n)/step_n;<br>
Wherein, "step" is the scaling step length for X_LEV, step_n is the scaling step length for X_LEV_N, and floor_x is the upper limit of x corresponding to X_LEV_000, for example, if the "step" corresponding to N0_LEV_000 is 0.1, step_n is 0.1, floor_JV0 is -108, and floor_x_n is<br>
-160, N0_LEV_020 is equivalent to N0_LEV_N_540, that is because of: 540 =20+[-108-(-160)J *10 .<br>
The scaled variable can be operated after it has been converted into a scaling value under the public nominal.<br> supposing two power values of A(dBm) and B(dBm) to calculate C(dBm)=A(dBm)+B(dBm).<br>
The calculation can be performed as following:<br>
i. scaling A(dBm) with above-mentioned scaling rules: ALEV, scaling B(dBm) with above-mentioned scaling rules: B-LEV;<br>
ii. converting A-LEV into A_LEV_N and B_LEV into B_LEV_N;<br>
iii. calculating C_LEV_N with following formula:<br>
C_LEV_N = max(A_LEV_N, B_LEV_N)<br>

All the parameters used in above case are configured under a simulation environment, and those of an actual system should be configured based on the specific characteristics of base station equipments.<br>
1. Construction of a radio simulation environment and configuration of corresponding parameters.<br>
The radio environment and the corresponding parameters of a cell now will be configured in order to illustrate the method of the present invention more detailedly.<br>
It supposes that the planning radius of the cell is 2km, and then the propagation model of radio signals in the cell is:<br>
Outdoor propagation model:<br>
Z^=46.3 + 33.91g/-13.821g/26+(44.9-6.551g^)(lgd)<br>
The applicable conditions of the model consist in that: carrier frequency is in the range of 150MHz~2000MHz, the effective height of the base station antenna hb is in the range of 30-200 m, the height of the mobile station antenna is in the range of 1—10 m, the communication distance d is in the range of 1-20 km, and the height of the mobile station is 1.5m.<br>
The specific meaning of each parameter consists in that:<br>
Ab, hm	the effective heights of the base station antenna and the mobile<br>
station antenna, whose unit is meter, and the unit of d is kilometer.<br>
Supposing that the height from the antenna of the base station to the ground is  hs, the altitude of the base station ground is  hg, the height<br>
. from the antenna of the mobile station to the ground is  h . the altitude of<br><br>
the ground where the mobile station located is hmg, thus the effective height of the base station antenna can be calculated by hb^ h. + /i, hw!,; and the effective height of the mobile station antenna is/?,,,,<br>
The parameters adopted in the calculation are that hb=30m, f= 19.50Hz.<br>
2. Parameter configuration<br>
The related parameters of different service subclasses are shown in table 2, wherein the parameters in the rows of 2-5, 7-9 are pre-configured and the parameters in the rows of 6, 11-13 are determined by the pre-configured parameters through simulation, and the result of the simulation is shown in Fig.4.<br>

The total interference power received by the base station (RTWP) can be measured in an actual system, and reported to RNC (radio network controller) by NodeB (node B - base station), RTWP is calculated by a simulation algorithm in the present embodiment: RTWP= -94.1536 dBm.<br>
The service of a new call request is the service subclass of number 6, which is in the form of walking and with high priority.<br>
4. Implementation of downlink admission control method<br>

Supposing that the hardware resource of NodeB is enough and no<br>

Step3: updating the existing UL capacity credit of NodeB<br>
The UL capacity credit is updated based on the consumption law of<br>
NodeB and the SF of No.6 service subclass.<br>
The whole downlink admission control flow is ended so far.<br>
The key point to the uplink mixed service admission control is to estimate the increment of the interference power possibly applied to a system by a new call request rapidly and accurately. The present method predicts the increment of the total interference power received by a base station caused by a new call request, by means of a single service load curve on the basis of the actual conditions of different subclasses and system load and the conditions such as NodeB hardware resource barrage, etc, also a solution for non-linear variable real-time operation is provided in this method.<br>
The last point should be noted that the practical cases mentioned above is not to limit the technical solution introduced by the present invention, but to illustrate the invention; therefore, additional modifications or equivalent replacement will readily occur to those skilled in this field, although the description has illustrated the invention with the practical cases in detail; various modifications may be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the general inventive concept as defined by the appended claims and their equivalents.<br><br>
