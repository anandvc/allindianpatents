The controller 1 extracts at least a part of the header information and records the part of the header information on an optical disc 100, which is an information storage medium according to the present invention, through the recorder 3.   In addition, the controller 1 generates<br><br>
navigation data required to search for or reproduce the video data, and records the navigation data on the optical disc 100 through the recorder 3.<br>
FIG. 2 is a reference diagram illustrating an example of a file structure of an optical disc on which video data are recorded, according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 2, a directory for real-time record is provided in a root directory. Files in which the navigation data required to search for or reproduce the video data recorded on the optical disc 100 is recorded, such as Manager.ifo, Program #1.ifo,.. . , Program #N.ifo, Clip #1.ifo, . . . , and Clip #M.ifo, are stored in the real-time record directory. Files in which the video data is recorded, such as Clip #1.VOB, . . . , and Clip #K.VOB, are further stored in the real-time record directory.<br>
General information on the video data recorded on the optical disc 100 may be recorded in the file Manager.ifo. The general information includes information such as the number of programs and duration time. The navigation data for a number N of programs that are recorded on the optical disc 100, is recorded in the files Program #1 .ifo, .... and Program #N.ifo. The navigation data for each of at least one clip included in each program is recorded in the files Clip #1 .ifo, . . . , and Clip #M.ifo. The actual video data is recorded in the files Clip #1.VOB, .... Ciip#K.VOB, and Clip #K+1.VOB.<br>
Program and clip represent title and subtitle of the video data shown to a user, respectively. For example, program means a movie (Gone with the Wind', and three clips belonging to the program 'Gone with the Wind' mean first, second, and third parts.<br>
FIG. 3 is a reference diagram illustrating another example of the file structure of the optical disc on which video data are recorded, according to the present invention. Referring to FIG. 3, a directory for real-time record is provided in a root directory. Files in which the navigation data required to search for or reproduce the video data recorded on the optical disc 100 is recorded, such as Manager, ifo, Program.ifo, and Clip.ifo, are stored in the real-time record directory. A file in which the video data is recorded, such as Clip.VOB, is further stored in the real-time record directory.   Compared the file structure of FIG. 3 with that of<br><br>
FIG. 2, in the file structure of FIG. 2, the navigation data for a number N of programs is divided into a number N of files and recorded, whereas in the file structure of FIG. 3, the navigation data is incorporated into one file and recorded. The navigation data for a number M of clips is also incorporated into one file and recorded, and the clips in which the video data is recorded, are also incorporated into one file and recorded.<br>
When the video data is divided into small files and recorded, it takes more time to search for a corresponding file, whereas if the corresponding file has been found out, a desired data can be immediately read. Conversely, when the video data is incorporated into one file and recorded, a corresponding file can be immediately found out, but even if the corresponding file has been found out, it takes more time to search for a desired data and to read it.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates the data structure which corresponds to the file structure shown in FIG. 2. Referring to FIG. 4, a number N of programs Program #1, . . . , Program #n, . . . , and Program #N are recorded on the optical disc 100. The program Program #n has a number M of clips<br>
Clip #1.... , Clip #m, .... and Clip #M.    For example, a program called 'Gone with the Wind' has three clips comprised of first, second, and third parts.<br>
Video data is recorded in predetermined units of clips Clip#1.VOB,.... Clip #k.VOB, .... Clip #K.VOB, and Clip #K+1 .VOB.    The clips Clip #1.VOB, Clip #k.VOB, . . . , Clip #K.VOB, and Clip #K+1 .VOB correspond to files Clip #1.ifo, . . . , Clip#k.ifoI .... Clip #K.ifo, and Clip#K+1.ifo in which navigation data is recorded.<br>

For example, the first part of the program 'Gone with the Wind' is recorded in the clip Clip #1.VOB, the second part thereof is recorded in the clip Clip #k.VOB, and the third part thereof is recorded in the clips Clip #K.VOB and Clip #K+1 .VOB.<br><br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a detailed structure of Program #n.ifo shown in FIG. 4. Referring to FIG. 5, an identifier ID of a corresponding clip and start time and end time of duration of the clip are recorded in Program #n.ifo. When there are a plurality of clips, an identifier of a corresponding clip and start time and end time of duration of the clip are provided for each clip. In addition, information Program information #n on a corresponding program #n is recorded in Program #n.ifo. Program information #n includes title, duration time, and other information Etc 1 and Etc2.<br>
FiG. 6 illustrates a detailed structure of Clip #k.ifo shown in FIG. 4. Referring to FIG. 6, mapping information Time to Address Map which maps duration time information on a corresponding clip to address information in which video data belonging to the corresponding clip is recorded, and Bitstream information #k, which is information on a bit stream of the corresponding clip, are included in Clip #k.ifo. Bitstream information #k includes a video format and a broadcasting format. When the video format is a DIF sequence, which is video data provided by a camcorder, the video format may be recorded in the format of DV 25 and DV 50.
