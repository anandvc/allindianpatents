SPECIFICATION<br>
TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Capacitance type light-emitting switch and light-emitting switch element used for such capacitance type light-emitting switch<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a capacitance type light-emitting switch and a lightemitting switch element used for such capacitance type light-emitting switch.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
[0002]<br>
The previously known capacitance type input devices such as disclosed in patent document 1 have been used, for example, for front panels of audio instruments, television sets, and washing machines etc.    FIG. 15 shows one example of such capacitance type input devices, i.e., a light emitting switch element 151 has a panel 2 made from transparent material, a decorated layer 3 arranged on at least one side of the panel 2, a transparent electrode 101, which is a transparent conducting layer, arranged on the back side of the panel 2, and a light-emitting portion 103 arranged on the most back surface of the panel 2.    In general, a edge light type surface light source, in which a point light source 5 or a line light source is arranged on the side of a light guide plate 4 and a reflecting layer 100 is arranged on the back side of the light guide plate 4, is used as a light emitter 103 (refer to FIGS. 15 and 16).<br>
The conventional light-emitting switch element 151 described above is used as a conventional capacitance type light-emitting switch by connecting the transparent electrode 101 to a control element (not illustrated).<br><br>
[0003]<br>
In the capacitance type light-emitting switch of the configuration described above,<br>
if a finger touches the top surface of the switch or if a finger comes close to the<br>
switch, it causes the change in the capacitance of the transparent electrode 101.<br>
This change is detected with the control element, which then switches a circuit<br>
for an external loading device.<br>
In the panel of the light-emitting switch element, the decorated layer 3 is<br>
displayed or not displayed by turning the light source on or off.    In display of the<br>
decorated layer 3, in some cases light is shined on the whole region of the panel<br>
and in other cases light is shined on a certain region of the panel.    In the latter<br>
case, characters, figures, graphics, marks, patters, etc. are often displayed on<br>
such a certain region.<br>
[00041<br>
Patent document 1: Publication of unexamined utility model applications No.<br>
S61-89941<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]<br>
However, in the conventional capacitance type light-emitting switch, the use of a<br>
high conductive ITO film as a transparent electrode deteriorates the sensitivity<br>
If a thick panel is arranged at the front side of the transparent electrode 101, the<br>
sensitivity becomes worse.   This may prevent reliable entry, thus causing<br>
improper operation.<br>
[0006]<br>
Furthermore, a large number of parts are used for the conventional capacitance<br>
type light-emitting switch, thereby making its fabrication process cumbersome<br>
and complicated.     Still furthermore, an ITO layer is needed.    Consequently,<br>
production cost may increase.    The use of a large number of parts, in particidar.<br><br>
may inhibit reduction in size and weight and thickness.<br>
[0007]<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a capacitance type<br>
light-emitting switch that has high sensitivity and operates properly.    It is<br>
another object of the present invention to provide a capacitance type<br>
light-emitting switch for which a smaller nvnnber of parts are used.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a capacitance type<br>
lightemitting switch element that is capable of transmitting the change in<br>
capacitance to a control element reliably.    It is still another object of the present<br>
invention to provide a capacitance type light-emitting switch element for which a<br>
smaller number of parts are used.<br>

MOST PREFERRED EMBODIMENT TO CARRY OUT THE TNVTENTION<br>
[0023]<br>
Referring to the drawings, a description shall now be provided of an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0024]<br>
FIG. 1 is an explanation of a capacitance type light-emitting switch 61 of the<br>
present invention.    FIG. 2 is an exploded cross-sectional view showing an<br>
embodiment of a light-emitting switch element 51 of the present invention.    The<br>
first light-emitting switch element 51 is one of the components that constrnct the<br>
capacitance type light-emitting switch 61.    FIG. 3 is a back view showing the<br>
formation of a reflecting layer 1 for a light emitter 6 in FIG. 2.<br>
[0025]<br>
A control element 31 includes an oscillating circuit, a checking circuit, and a<br>
circuit-switching circuit.   An oscillating circuit is connected through a<br>
conductive unit lb to an electrode unit la.    The oscillating circuit changes the<br>
oscillating frequency, depending on the value of capacitance of the electrode unit<br>
la.<br>
The checking circuit operates to detect and check the change in the oscillating<br><br>
frequency of the oscillating circuit.    The circuit-switching circuit switches a circuit/circuits for the external loading device 32, according to the check results carried out hy the checking circuit.    The circuit-switching circuit includes, for example, a relay circuit.    The circuit-switching includes, for example, switching on and off of one electric circuit and sequential switching of one electric circuit to three or more electrical circuits.    The external loading device includes, for example, a television set and a washing machine and includes also, for example, a power supply circuit for a point light source 5 of the light-emitting switch element. [0026]<br>
A description will he provided of how the capacitance type light-emitting switch 61 operates.    For explanation, a condenser equivalent material including an electrode unit la(l) is a condenser D71, and a condenser equivalent material including the body of an operator is a condenser H72.<br>
When nothing is in touch with the top surface layer of the light-emitting switch element, i.e., a panel 2 in this embodiment, or when there is nothing very close to the top surface layer of the light-emitting switch element, the condenser D71 has a capacitance of Ca,    The oscillating circuit oscillates with a frequency of Fa, depending on Ca.    When a finger 81 of an operator touches, or is very close to, the panel 2, a capacitance Cm of the condenser H72 gives a change to the capacitance of the condenser D71.    As a result, the capacitance of the condenser D71 changes to Ct, and the oscillating frequency of the oscillating circuit changes from Fa of the previous value to Ft.   The checking circuit detects and checks the change of the oscillating frequency from Fa to Ft, and then the circuit-switching circuit switches a circuit/circuits for the external loading device. [0027]<br>
The first light-emitting switch element 51 comprises a panel 2 made from transparent materials, a decorated layer 3 arranged on at least one side of the panel 2, a light guide plate 4 arranged at on the back sides of the panel 2 and the<br><br>
decorated layer, a point light source 5 arranged on the side of the light guide plate 4, and reflective layer 1 that is made of an opaque metal film of less than 1Q/cm2 of surface resistance measured by the fourpoint probe array measurement method arranged on the back side of the light guide plate 4, and is formed to have an electrode unit la and a conductive unit lb connected to the electrode unit la. "(l)" of reference numerals la(l), lb(]), etc. means that the electrode unit la and the conductive unit lb are part of the reflecting layer 1.    The same holds true for the reference numerals shown in FIG. 4 and other figures later. [0028]<br>
The panel 2, which is used, for example, for three-dimensional covers of cellular phones, digital cameras, portable players, etc. and for front panels of audio devices, television sets, washing machines, etc., is not limited to flat plate in terms of shape.    That is to say, the panel 2 may be, for example, in the shape of flat plate, curved surface, and plate with different thickness.    As materials of the panel 2, polystyrene resin, polyoleiin resin, ABS resin, AS resin, AN resin, and other general-purpose resin may be used.    Polyphenylene oxide polystyrene resin, polycarbonate resin, polyacetal resin, polyacryl resin, polycarbonate modified polyphenylene ether resin, polybutylene terephthalate resin, polybutylene terephthalate resin, ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene resin, and other general-purpose engineering resin may be also used. [0029]<br>
The decorated layer 3 is a layer that works to decorate the panel 2.    The decorated layer 3 is, for example, formed as a colored ink layer.    As materials of the colored ink layer, colored ink may be used, which contains properly colored pigments or dyes as colorant and also contains resin, such as polyvinyl chloride resin, polyamide resin, polyester resin, polyacryl resin, polyurethane resin, polyvinyl acetal resin, polyester-urethane resin, cellulosic ester resin, and alkyd resin, as binder.    As formation method of colored ink layers, usual printing, for example, offset printing, gravure printing and screen printing, and painting may<br><br>
he used.    The manner to form the decorated layer 3 is not limited the direct formation described above.    The decorated layer 3 may form indirectly, as well. Namely, the decorated layer 3 may formed on the panel 2 by the transfer method, the simultaneous inmold transfer method, the insert method, the laminate method or other methods after it was temporarily formed on a substrate film. The decorated layer 3, without being integrally formed on the panel 2, may be first formed on a substrate film, and then the formed decorated layer 3 may be superposed on the panel 2.    The decorated layer 3 may be arranged on the front side or both sides of the panel 2.   These mutual arrangement aspects of the decorated layer 3 and the panel 2 are not shown in figures. [0030]<br>
The decorated layer 3 may be also arranged so that it can shield part of the panel. Tn this case, only a certain part, or only the area around a certain part, such as characters, figures, graphics, marks, and patterns, are illuminated and displayed. FIG. 14 is a plan view of an example of illvnnination and display in the light-emitting switch element of the present invention.    This figure shows that the panel surface evenly decorated by the decorated layer 3, except the area of "arrow' and "frame," is shielded when the light emitter 6 is turned on.    In the figure, the plain area is the area that is displayed, whereas the diagonally shaded area is the area that is shielded. [0031]<br>
The light guide plate 4 works to conduct the light, which was introduced from the side, toward the deep by total reflection and to emit part of the light from the front surface.    High refractiveindex and high internal reflective resin, such as acrylic resin and polycarbonate resin, and light-condensing plastic the light-condensing ratio of which is improved at the side thereof by adding fluorescent pigment to the resin, may be used as the light guide plate 4.   The light guide plate 4 is not hmited to Hat plate in terms of shape.    That is to say, the light guide plate 4 may be, for example, in the shape of flat plate, curved<br><br>
surface, and differently thick plate.    Optical sheets, including diffusion sheet and lens sheet, may be arranged on the top surface of the light guide plate 4 in order to improve uniformity of brightness and light intensity. [0032]<br>
Alight-emitting diode (LED) etc. may be used as the point light source 5.    A line light source such as a cathode-ray tube may be vised instead of the point light source 5. [0033]<br>
The reflecting layer 1 works to reflect light, which came from the light guide plate 4, back to the light guide plate 4 and also to reflect light, which came from the light guide plate 4, and then emit the reflected light from the from, of the light guide plate 4 (the arrows in FIG. 2 indicate the direction in which the light goes, and also do the arrows in FIGS. 4, 6, 8, 10, and 12).    The reflecting layer 1 comprises an opaque metal film.    Opaque metal films provide, on its own, a hght reflectivity needed for the present invention.    The use of silver, copper, aluminum, gold, nickel, stainless steel, etc. as materials of the metal film enables high reflectivity and also improves efficiency in illumination and display.    The reflecting layer 1 may have one metal film layer formed thereon, and it may have also two or more of metal film layers formed thereon.    In the case that the reflecting layer 1 has a plurality of metal film layers formed thereon, for a high reflectivity the metals described above will do as a material of the metal film nearest to the light guide plate 4. [0034]<br>
In the present invention, the reflecting layer 1 serves as that electrode of a capacitance type switch element which detects the change in capacitance, because the metal film that constructs the reflecting layer 1 is formed to have the electrode unit la and the conductive unit lb connected to the electrode unit la (refer to FIG. 2).    This means that in addition to the reflecting layer 1, there is no necessity for an electrode to be arranged.    As a result, a smaller number of<br><br>
parts may be used, compared with prior arts.    Furthermore, because the reflecting layer 1 has a surface resistance of less than 1Q/cm2 measured by the four-point probe array measurement method, there may be provided a high-sensitive, rarely malfunctioning contact detecting function, even if the panel 2 arranged on the front side of the electrode unit la becomes thicker, or even if the panel 2 is arranged on the front side of the electrode unit la, with clearance created between them.   A metal film with a surface resistance of less than 1Ω/cm2 may be obtained by choosing a material and film thickness appropriately. [0035]<br>
For example, aluminum with a film thickness of lµm, which has a surface resistance of less than 1Ω/cm2, meets necessary requirements for the reflecting layer 1 of the light guide plate 4.    In other words, a reflecting layer made of an opaque metal film serves as both a reflecting layer and an electrode unit, with no necessity of extra manufacturing processes. [0036]<br>
The surface resistance was measured according to JIS K 7194-1994 "Testing method for resistivity of conductive plastics with a four-point probe array." [0037]<br>
The metal layer may be formed by the vacuum deposition method, the spattering method, the ion plating method, the plating method, the metal foil pasting method, and other methods.    The metal layer formed by one or more of the methods described above is patterned to obtain the electrode unit la and the conductive unit lb.    For example, a resist film having a certain pattern is formed by exposing a photoresist film, which was formed on a metal film, using a photomask, and then by developing the exposed photoresist film, using developer, or a resist film having a certain pattern is printed on a metal film by the screen printing method, the gravure printing method, the Inkjet printing method or other methods.    After that, part of the metal film not covered by the resist layer is removed, using etching liquid.    The reflecting layer 1, without being integrally<br><br>
formed on the back side of the light guide plate 4, may be first formed on a substrate film, and then the formed reflecting layer 1 may be superposed on the back side of the light guide plate 4.    As still another example, the reflecting layer 1 may be integrally formed on the back side of the light guide plate 4.    As still another example, the metal film may be not only directly formed on the back side of the light guide plate 4, hut also indirectly formed on the back side of the light guide plate 4 by the transfer method, the simultaneous inmold transfer method, the insert molding method, the laminate method or other methods after it was temporarily formed on a substrate film. [0038]<br>
The integral formation of the reflecting layer 1 on the back side of the light guide plate 4 (including the case in which a reflecting layer is formed to have both an electrode unit and a conductive unit and the case in which a reflecting layer is formed to have the electrode unit and has an electric conductor connected the electrode unit) may further reduce the number of parts to be used for the capacitance type light-emitting switch and the light-emitting switch element. [0039]<br>
In the light-emitting switch element of the present invention, an opaque metal film that constructs the reflecting layer 1 may be formed to have no conductive unit lb.    In other words, the light-emitting switch element of the present invention comprises a panel 2 made of transparent material, a decorated layer 3 arranged on at least one side of the panel 2, a light guide plate 4 arranged at on the back sides of the panel 2 and the decorated layer 3, a point light source 5 or a line light source arranged on the side of the light guide plate 4, a reflecting layer 1 that is made of an opaque metal film of less than l	Ω/cm2 of surface resistance measured by the four-point probe array measurement method arranged on the back side of the light guide plate 4, and is formed to have an electrode unit la, and a electric conductor 7 connected to the electrode unit 1a of the reflecting layer 1 (refer to FIGS. 8 and 9).<br><br>
10040]<br>
Tn the fourth light-emitting switch element 54 shown in FIG. 8, an electrode unit<br>
lad) is connected to an electric conductor 7.    This configuration has an<br>
advantage that when the whole area of a panel is illuminated and displayed, a<br>
reflecting layer can be formed on the whole surface of a light guide plate 4.<br>
Another advantage is that the reflecting layer may be freely formed anywhere,<br>
according to the desired region for illumination and display in the panel.<br>
f004l]<br>
The electric conductor 7 is formed by the screen printing method, the inkjet<br>
printing method, the blade coating method, the bar coating method and other<br>
methods, using paste in which conductive microparticles such as carbon and<br>
silver are dispersed.    In the case that, as described above, the reflecting layer 1<br>
is indirectly formed on the back side of the light guide plate 4 by the transfer<br>
method, the simultaneous inmold transfer method, the insert method, the<br>
laminate method or other methods, the electric conductor 7, together with the<br>
reflecting layer 1, is formed on a substrate film.    A flexible board on which<br>
electric conductive material is deposited, may be used as the electric conductor 7.<br>
The flexible board may connect to the end of the electrode unit la by soldering.<br>
[0042]<br>
High reflectance can be achieved by coating the front surface of an opaque metal<br>
film with a dielectric enhanced reflection film as well.    An enhanced reflection<br>
film is a film that has high refractive-index dielectric thin films and low<br>
refractive "index dielectric thin films alternately multlayers composed thereon by<br>
optically effective film thickness of each thin film in order to achieve a high<br>
reflectance.    For example, high reflectance can be achieved over the wide<br>
wavelength region by mult-layers composing a TiO2 layer and a SiO2 layer<br>
alternately several times or more.<br>
[00431<br>
In the light-emitting switch element of the present invention, the reflecting layer<br><br>
1 may be formed to have two or more electrode units la.    That is to say, there<br>
may be two or more switches.    In this case, there are two or more detection<br>
regions, resulting in a switch capal)le of switching two or more circuits.    In<br>
addition, the illumination/display function is single, and for the<br>
illumination/display in the detection region, two or more detection regions are<br>
simultaneovisly illuminated and shielded.<br>
[0044]<br>
In an embodiment which provides a reflecting layer having an electrode unit la<br>
and a conductive unit lb, there are two or more pairs of an electrode unit la and a<br>
conductive unit lb (refer to FIGS. 4 and 5).    In the second light-emitting switch<br>
element 52, two pairs of switch parts comprising an electrode unit la(l) and a<br>
conductive unit lb(l) align in the right and left direction.<br>
[0045]<br>
In an embodiment which provides an electric conductor 7 and a reflecting layer 1<br>
having an electrode unit la, there are two or more pairs of an electrode unit la<br>
and an electric conductor 7 (refer to FIGS. 10 and 11).    In the fifth light emitting<br>
switch element 55, two pairs of switch parts comprising an electrode unit la(l)<br>
and an electric conductor 7 align in the right and left direction.<br>
[0046]<br>
In the case of N detection regions (N being a positive integer of 2 or more), the<br>
control element may have one oscillating circuit and one checking circuit and may,<br>
by time-sharing, detect and check each of the inputs from N electrode units.<br>
Furthermore, the control element may also have N pairs of circuits that have one<br>
oscillating circuit and one checking circuit.<br>
[0047]<br>
In the light-emitting switch element of the present invention, the reflecting layer<br>
1 may be also formed to have a non-conducting part Ic (refer to FIGS. 6 and 12).<br>
In the light-emitting switch element of the present invention, in the case that<br>
only a partial region of the panel is available for entry, there exists no electrode<br><br>
unit 1a in the region unavailable for entry.    In the region where there exists no electrode unit la, it is preferable to arrange the non-conducting partm1c, which does not function to detect the change in capacitance, as part of the reflecting layer.    This is because making only the desired detection region an electrode unit, thereby prevents an error in entry.    Furthermore, in the case that such region unavailable for entry is formed to have no reflecting layer, light; leaks to the back side of the light emitter.    Accordingly, the formation of a reflecting layer on such region as well ensures the effective use of light from the point light source 5 etc, [0048]<br>
The nonconducting part Ic may be formed by forming an opaque metal film on the whole surface of the reflecting layer 1 and then leaving the region that is to serve as a non-conducting part without etching when the electrode vmit la and/or the conductive unit lb are formed by the photolithoetching. [0049]<br>
In the third light-emitting switch element 53, a nonconductive part Ic is formed between two electrode units la adjacent to each other in the right and left direction.    In the sixth light-emitting switch element 56, a nonconductive part 1c is formed between two electrode units la adjacent to each other in the right and left direction. [0050]<br>
In the light-emitting switch element of the present invention, two or more light guide plates 4 may be arranged and there may be two or more formation patterns of the reflecting layer 1 (refer to FIGS. 7 and 13).    For example, in the formation pattern, the number of the electrode unit la, existence or nonexistence of the conductive unit lb or the non conductive part 1c, the arrangement position and area of them, etc. may not be equal on all area of the reflecting layer.    That is to say, in a plurality of switch regions shown on a single panel, there may be provided light-emitting switch elements that are rich in design, different in timing of illumination and shielding, different in shape of the switch region, etc.<br><br>
In the third light-emitting' switch element 53, there are provided three light guide plates 4, which are arranged in the up and down direction in FIG. 7.    Each of the light guide plates 4 has a different numher and position of the electrode unit la, a different number and position of the conductive unit lb, and a different number and position of the non-conductive part 1c,   In the sixth light-emitting switch element 56, there are provided three light guide plates 4, which are arranged in the up and down direction in FIG. 13.    Each of the light guide plates 4 has a different number and position of the electrode unit la and a different number and position of the non-conductive part 1c. [0052]<br>
The reflecting layer 1 may function, on its own, to reflect light for the light guide plate 4, but it may function to subsidiarily reflect light in the case that on the reflecting layer 1 there is another layer, which does not have a function as an electrode but functions to reflect light.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
[0053]<br>
(Example l)<br>
On a transparent polyethylene terephthalate film (thickness: 75fim) was a<br>
polyester-based anchor layer coated, on which then an opaque metal film made of<br>
silver was formed by vacuum evaporation.    After that, a photoresist layer was<br>
formed on the desired region of the metal film.    The resulted metal film was<br>
formed by etching so that it has a plurality of electrode units and conductive units<br>
connected to each of the electrode units, to obtain a reflecting layer.    The opaque<br>
metal layer had a surface resistance of 0.8iitm^ measured by the four-point profile<br>
array measurement method.<br>
[0054]<br>
The entire surface of a polyethylene terephthalate film (thickness, lOOjim) was<br><br>
grvure printed by using gray ink.    After that, all area, except area that is to be<br>
illuminated and displayed, of such gravureprinted polyethylene terephthalate<br>
film was gravure printed by using black ink to obtain a smoke-tinted decorated<br>
film.<br>
[0055]<br>
A polycarbonate light guide plate (thickness- 0.6mm) having light reflecting<br>
asperities on the back side thereof was obtained by the injection molding method.<br>
In this case, a die the cavity surface of which was microfabricated was used.<br>
[0056]<br>
Next, the reflecting layer and the light guide plate were laminated on a plastic<br>
frame from the bottom, and then commercial diffusion sheets and lens sheets<br>
were laminated further.    After that, an LED was arranged on the side of the<br>
light guide plate to obtain an edge light type backlight.<br>
[0057]<br>
Next, the decorated film was pasted uniformly on the under side of a transparent<br>
acrylic sheet (thickness- 1mm) by using transparent polyacrylic acid adhesive.<br>
Around the resulted sheet was acrylic twoside tape arranged.    After that, the<br>
sheet was pasted on the under side of the edge light type backlight to obtain a<br>
light-emitting switch element,<br>
[0058]<br>
(Example 2)<br>
Alight-emitting switch was obtained as described in Embodiment 1, except that<br>
when a metal film described above was chemically etched, a reflecting layer was<br>
formed so that it has only a plurality of electrode units .    Flexible board, which<br>
was electric conductor, was connected to each electrode unit by soldering.<br>
10059]<br>
(Example 3)<br>
The light-emitting switch element obtained in Example 1 or Example 2 was built<br>
into the operation panel of an air conditioner, and then the conductive unit<br><br>
arranged on the reflecting layer was connected to the control element of a capacitance type touch panel.    In the operation panel, the smoke-tinted decorated pattern can be seen from the operator side when light is not emitted. Therefore, the existence of the switch is not observed.    However, when the main power supply of the air conditioner is switched on, the light source of the switch element glows and the switch pattern appears with light.    When the switch unit was touched, the air conditioner functioned to set an air volume, temperature, etc. without any error.    Furthermore, with sufficient amount of light, the switch pattern was clearly visually observed.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
