				<td>Pharmaceutical compositions comprising of arsenous acid, its sodium salt and its<br>
derivatives intended for the treatment of urogenital cancer and its metastasis.<br>
1.Introduction<br>
Cancer is a significant health problem in the world. Although advances have been made in cancer detection and treatment, no vaccine or. other universally successful preventive or therapeutic method is- currently available. Management of the disease currently relies on a combination of early diagnosis and aggressive treatment, which may include one or more of a variety of therapies such as surgery, radiotherapy, chemotherapy and hormone therapy. While such therapies provide benefit to many patients, a high mortality continues to be observed for many cancers. The development of improved anti-tumour -agents would facilitate cancer prevention and treatment.<br>
Unfortunately, cancer is the leading cause of death, second only to heart disease, of both men and women. In the fight against cancer, numerous techniques have been developed and are the subject of current research directed to understanding the nature and cause of the disease and to providing methods for the control or cure thereof.<br>
Although thousands of potential anti-cancer agents have been evaluated, the treatment of human cancer remains<br>
fraught with complications, which often present an array of<br>
suboptimal treatment choices. As such,  chemotherapeutic<br>
agents, which possess little or no toxicity, which are<br>
inexpensive to obtain or manufacture,  which are well<br>
tolerated by the patient, and which are easily administered<br>
would be a desirable addition to the therapeutic modalities<br>
currently available to the oncologist. Agents that will<br>
selectively sensitise malignant tissue to allow lower doses<br>
of radiation or therapy to achieve the same therapeutic<br>
effect with less damage to healthy tissues  are also<br>
desirable.  Similarly,  agents that prevent  cancer from<br>
occurring or reoccurring are also desirable. The present<br>
invention  remedies  these  needs  by  providing  such<br>
chemotherapeutic and sensitising agents.<br>
Therefore, the technical problem underlying the present invention is to provide alternative or further compounds with anti-cancer activity and methods for the clinical use.<br>
This problem is solved by the provision of the embodiments as defined in the claims.<br>
The compounds of this invention are useful in treating cancer. They are effective in inhibiting survival and/or growth of cancer cells and/or for inhibiting undesirable cell growth in general.<br>
This invention- further provides pharmaceutical and therapeutic compositions which contain a pharmaceutically or therapeutically effective amount of these compounds and therapeutic methods and methods of treatment employing such<br>
compounds. In particular, this invention relates to methods of treating cancer by administration of the oral arsenous acid sodium salt disclosed herein.<br>
The role of arsenic trioxide in the treatment of cancer as described by several inventors is different from this invention, whereas the role of arsenic (WO 800245; Komipharm International) for the treatment of malignancies was limited to primary tumours.<br>
Also claimed is a kit for inhibiting abnormal cell growth comprising of arsenous acid sodium salt and/or synthetic analogues, modifications and pharmacologically active fragments' thereof.<br>
Before the present compounds, compositions, formulations, and methods are described, it is to be understood that this invention is not limited to the particular compounds methods, compositions, and therapeutic indications described herein, as such methods, compositions, and therapeutic indications, of course, vary. It is also to be understood that the terminology used herein is for the purpose of describing particular embodiments only, and is not intended to limit the scope of the present invention, which is only defined by the appended claims.<br>
As used herein, including the appended claims, singular forms of words such as "a," "an," and "the" include their corresponding plural referents unles.s the context clearly dictates otherwise. Thus, e.g., reference to "an organism" includes one or more different organisms, reference to "a<br>
cell" includes one or more of such cells, and reference to "a method" includes reference to equivalent steps and methods known to a person of ordinary skill in the art, and so forth.<br>
Unless otherwise defined, all technical and scientific terms used herein have the same meaning as commonly understood by a person of ordinary skill in the art to which this invention belongs. Although methods and materials similar or equivalent to those described herein can be used in the practice or testing of the.'present invention, suitable methods and materials are described below. All publications, patent applications, patent, and other references discussed above are provided solely for their disclosure prior to the filing date of the present application. Nothing herein is to be construed as an admission that the invention is not entitled to antedate such disclosure by virtue of its prior invention. All publications, patent applications, patent, and other references mentioned herein are incorporated by reference in their entirety including all figures and drawings.<br>
Prior to setting forth the invention it may be helpful to an understanding thereof to set forth definitions of certain terms to be used hereinafter.<br>
A "patient" for the purposes of the present invention includes humans and other animals, particularly mammals, and other organisms. Thus the methods are applicable to both human therapy and veterinary applications. In the<br>
<br>
preferred embodiment the patient is a mammal, and in the most preferred embodiment the patient is human.<br>
The term "animal" refers to an organism with a closed circulatory system of blood vessels and includes birds, mammals and crocodiles. The term "animal" used here also includes human subjects.<br>
The term "angiogenesis" refers to the generation of new blood vessels into cells, tissue, organs or tumours.<br>
The term "metastasis" refers to the process by which tumour cells are spread to distant parts of the body. The term is also used herein to refer to a tumour that develops through the metastatic process.<br>
The term "contacting" is used herein interchangeably with the following: combined' with, added to, mixed with, passed over, incubated with, flowed over, etc. Moreover, the compounds of present invention can be "administered" by any conventional method such as, for example, parenteral, oral, and topical and inhalation routes as described herein.<br>
As used herein, the term "safe and effective amount" refers to the quantity of a component that is sufficient to yield a desired therapeutic response without undue adverse side effects (such as toxicity, irritation, or allergic response) commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio when used in the manner of this invention. What is meant by a "therapeutically effective amount" is an amount of a compound of the present invention, .effective.. to yield the<br>
<br>
desired therapeutic response. This amount for example could be effective in delaying the growth, delaying metastasis inhibiting angiogenesis and/or tolemere and/or causing shrinkage of cancer, either a sarcoma or lymphoma. The specific safe and effective amount or therapeutically effective amount will vary with such factors as the particular condition being treated, the physical condition of the patient, the type of mammal being treated, the duration of the treatment, the nature of concurrent therapy (if any), and the specific formulations employed and the structure of the compounds or its derivatives.<br>
"An anti-angiogenic" amount refer to an amount of a compound or composition effective to depress, suppress or inhibit angiogenesis or result in amelioration of symptoms associated with an angiogenic disease. The desired result can be either a subjective relief of a symptom(s) or an objectively identifiable improvement in the recipient of the dosager a decrease in the vascularisation of endothelial cells or a decrease in the rate of angiogenesis as noted by a clinician or other qualified observer.<br>
The terms "treating cancer," "therapy," and the like refer generally to any improvement in the mammal having the cancer wherein the improvement can be ascribed to treatment with the compounds of the present invention. The improvement can be either subjective or objective. For example, if the mammal is human, the patient may note improved vigour or vitality or decreased pain as subjective symptoms of improvement or response to therapy. Alternatively, the clinician may notice decrease in tumour<br>
<br>
size or tumour burden based on physical exam, laboratory parameters, tumour markers or radiographic findings. Some laboratory signs that the clinician may observe for response to therapy include normalization of tests such as white blood cell count, red blood cell count, platelet count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, and various enzyme level's. Additionally, the clinician may observe a decrease in a detectable tumour marker. Alternatively, other tests can be used to evaluate objective improvement such as sonograms, nuclear magnetic resonance testing and positron emissions testing.<br>
"Inhibiting the growth of tumour cells" can be evaluated by any accepted method of measuring whether growth of the tumour cells has been slowed or diminished. This includes direct observation and indirect evaluation such as subjective symptoms or objective signs as discussed above.<br>
Accordingly, the compositions of the invention are administered to cells. By "administered" herein is meant<br>
*<br>
administration of a therapeutically effective dose of the candidate agents of the invention to a cell either in cell culture or in a patient. By "therapeutically effective dose" herein is meant a dose that produces the effects for which it is administered. The exact dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment, and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques. As is known in the art, adjustments for systemic versus localized delivery, age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, drug interaction and the severity of the condition may be necessary, and. will. be., ascertainable with<br>
routine experimentation by those skilled in the art. By "cells" herein is meant almost any cell in which mitosis or meiosis can be altered.<br>
Therefore, the present invention related to a pharmaceutical anti-cancer composition comprising a therapeutically effective amount of arsenous acid sodium salt represented by the following formula (I):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
<br>
2. Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to compounds, methods and compositions for the treatment of primary and metastatic neoplastic diseases, including, but not limited to urogenital carcinomas.<br>
More specifically, the present invention relates to novel chemotherapeutic compositions of arsenous acid sodium salt methods - novel uses of oral arsenic compounds for treating prostate cancer, primary and metastatic tumours of the urogenital system; and bladder, kidney, testicular and metastatic bone cancer.<br>
3. Background to the Invention<br>
The majority of chemotherapeutic drugs are currently developed for intravenous .use. ... Oral .treatment with anti-<br>
cancer agents, however, is now of interest due to the benefits of easy administration, better patient compliance and the reduction in cost and the increase in the quality of life of the patients. For example, patients will be able to undergo oral treatment as outpatients.<br>
Therefore, it is clear that oral drugs for cancer treatment have a future and will play a more important role than they have done in the past. Patient's preferences and quality of -life issues, which are becoming central considerations in palliative treatment regimens, precede the development of orally administered. drugs. Intravenous (iv) administration is a major source of discomfort and stress for cancer patients and approximately 90 % of patients asked, express a preference for oral versus iv chemotherapy, predominantly because of the convenience of administration outside a clinical setting or current concerns about previous problems with intravenous access.<br>
One of the key objectives of the present invention to provide a chemotherapeutic product for the treatment of cancer and which exhibits high bioavailability, enhanced anti-cancer activity and high level of safety following oral administration.<br>
3 . 1 Urogenital Cancer<br>
Genitourinary malignancies are composed of (amongst others) cancers of the prostate, bladder, kidney, and testis. The challenges presented by these malignancies parallel those confronting investigators and practicing., clinicians, in<br>
treating all other types of cancers. Smoking, which is strongly associated with the development of lung cancer, is responsible for one third of bladder cancers, and several studies implicate obesity with an increased risk for colon, breast, and kidney cancers.<br>
3.2 Bladder Cancer<br>
Carcinomas of the urinary tract occur in 90% of the cases directly in the bladder, 8% in the renal pelvis and 2% in the ureter or urethra. Bladder cancer is the fourth most common cancer in men and the eighth in women. Estimates are that 25% of the bladder cancers in men are related to occupational exposure and 50% to cigarette smoking. Smoking is a key determining risk, which persists for up to 10 years after smoking cessation. The choice of treatment is based  on  disease  extent:  superficial,  invasive  or metastatic.  Combination chemotherapy is used to  treat metastatic disease. Urothelial tumours are chemosensitive, and a number  of single  agents  result  in  short-term regressions in 20 to 30 percent of cases. One regimen is called the  MVAC regimen.  It  consists  of  combination treatment  with  methotrexate,  vinblastine,  adriamycin (doxorubicin) and cisplatin. Several drugs are given over a few days with the drugs then being repeated every few weeks for several months.<br>
3.3 Renal Cancer<br>
Renal cell carcinoma accounts for 90 to 95 percent of malignant neoplasm's arising from, the kidney. _Renal .cell<br>
carc.inoma   affects   more   than   30,000   American   annually   and is    responsible    for    nearly    12,000    deaths    in    the    United States each year.   Renal cell carcinoma occurs most  commonly in  adults   between  50   and  70   years   of  age,   although  it  has been    reported    in    children    as    young    as    3    years.     Renal carcinoma    is    responsible   for   approximately   3%   of    adult malignancies,    and   the   male   to    female    ratio   is    1.5:1.    A strong   correlation   exists   between   cigarette   smoking   and the   development   of   renal   cell   carcinoma.   Unproven   factors that may increase the risk for renal cell  carcinoma include polycystic   kidney   disease,   diabetes   mellitus,   and   chronic dialysis.    Up   to   85%   of   renal   cell   carcinomas   are   of   the clear   cell   type;   5%   to   15%   of   renal   cell   carcinomas   are a   papillary histologic variant.   The main type of treatment for   cancer   of   the   kidney   is   surgery   although   radiotherapy may also be recommended.   In some people,   hormonal treatment or biological treatment can be used either after surgery or when     a      cancer      cannot     be      removed      surgically.      Very occasionally,     cancer    of    the    kidney    will     spontaneously improve     without      any     treatment,      but      this      is      rare. Chemotherapy    has    not    yet    been    shown    to    be    helpful    in treating cancer of the  kidney.<br>
3.4 Testicular Cancer<br>
Testicular cancer primarily affects young men in the 20 to 44 year old age group, where it is the most common cancer. Overall, testicular cancer is not very common. Testicular cancer responds particularly well to treatment, and over 9 in 10 patients are cured. Primary germ cell tumours (GCTs) of the testis, arising by the malignant transformation, of<br>
primordial germ cells , constitute 95 percent testicular neoplasms. This disease is notable for the young age of the afflicted patients, the totipotent capacity for differentiation of the tumour cells and its curability; more than 90 percent of all newly diagnosed patients will be cured, and, "since the advent of cisplatin-based chemotherapy about 70 to 80 percent of patients with metastatic disease are cured.<br>
Surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy are the commonly used treatments, depending on the stage of the cancer and whether is has spread. Chemotherapy is more often used for non-seminoma testicular cancers, however it is also used for seminoma, which has spread. 'Testicular cancer can be treated with different combinations of drugs with the combination most often used being BEP, Bleomycin, Etoposide and Cisplatin.<br>
3 . 5 Prostate Cancer<br>
Cancer of the prostate is the most common malignancy in men in the ' United States and the third most common cause of cancer death in men above the age of 55 (after carcinomas of the lung and colon) . Surgery is the most common treatment for early-stage prostate cancer with radiation therapy being the second. There are also different forms of hormonal therapy. Prostate cancer cells do not tend to grow rapidly like some other types of cancer. For this reason traditional chemotherapy drugs have not proven to be quite as useful as they have been in some of the other major cancers. Nonetheless, some standard chemotherapies have been shown to be useful . - particularly in late-stage<br>
prostate cancer.   Although there are three chemotherapy<br>
drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for<br>
use in prostate cancer - Taxotere® (docetaxel), Novantrone®<br>
(rnitoxantrone  hydrochloride)  and  Emcyt®  (estramustine<br>
sodium  phosphate)  -  a  number  of  the  most  common<br>
chemotherapeutics approved for other cancers are used on an<br>
"off-label"  basis  for  late-stage  -prostate  cancer.<br>
Chemotherapy   is typically utilized in   patients   with<br>
advanced stage prostate cancer who are no longer responding<br>
to hormonal therapy.  None of these agents are consistently<br>
helpful in the disease. The most common sites of metastases<br>
in patients with prostate cancer are the bone and lymph<br>
nodes. The bone metastases are particularly troublesome in<br>
that they can create intense pain for the patient.<br>
3.6 Secondary Bone Cancer<br>
Secondary bone cancer does not start in the bone, but is the result of cancer cells spreading to the bone from the primary tumour. Sometimes only one area of bone is affected, but in other people a number of bone secondaries develop, often in different bones in the body. Although any type of cancer can spread to the bone, the most common types are cancers of the breast, prostate, lung, kidney and thyroid. The treatment for a secondary bone cancer depends on the type of primary cancer. For example, prostate cancer cells may have broken away from the prostate gland, travelled in the blood to the bone and begun to grow and multiply there. So the cancer cells in the bone will respond to the same type of treatment as the cancer cells in the prostate. Although a .secondary bone cancer- can occur<br>
in any bone in the body, the most commonly affected bones axe those of the spine, ribs, pelvis, skull and the upper bones of the arms and legs.<br>
3 . 7 Arsenic and Its Medical Uses<br>
Arsenic has been used as a pharmaceutical agent for more<br>
than 2400 years to treat a large variety of diseases<br>
including cancer, but it is also a poison and carcinogenic<br>
agent. With the rapid evolvement of medicine in the 20th<br>
century,  the use of medicinal arsenic waned rapidly.<br>
Interest in arsenic compounds revived when it was shown<br>
that daily intravenous administration of arsenic trioxide<br>
alone caused complete responses in a large majority of<br>
patients  with  newly  diagnosed  and  relapsed  acute<br>
promyelocytic leukaemia. Additional trials are underway in<br>
patients with haematological malignancies and solid tumours<br>
such as prostate and pancreatic cancer. A drawback of<br>
arsenic trioxide is that it is administered intravenously<br>
daily in 1-4-hr infusion for up to 6 weeks. A pilot study<br>
with an oral formulation of arsenic trioxide in patients<br>
with  acute  promyelocytic  leukaemia  is  ongoing.  The<br>
preliminary results show that the efficacy and side effects<br>
are comparable with intravenous arsenic trioxide. The same<br>
was noted for a pilot study with oral tetra-arsenic<br>
tetrasulphide given to patients with acute promyelocytic<br>
leukaemia. Thus, an oral arsenic agent with similar or<br>
better efficacy in leukaemia and solid tumours and fewer<br>
side effects, particularly in patients in whom long term<br>
treatment is required, would have costs and quality-of-life<br>
benefits.	<br>
Arsenic exists in both trivalent and pentavalent oxidation states as a chemically unstable sulphide or oxide, or as a salt of sodium, potassium or calcium. Trivalent arsenicals comprising sodium arsenite and arsenic trioxide inhibit many enzymes by reacting with biological ligands that possess available sulphur groups. Pentavalent arsenic is an uncoupler of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation. It is thus not surprising that arsenic trioxide exerts anti-tumour effects by activating apoptosis, induction of reactive oxygen species, inhibition of angiogenesis and in acute promyelocytic leukaemia cells also by degradation of PML-RARa fusion protein. The response depends upon cell type and the form of arsenic.<br>
In 1991 the National Cancer Institute reported that arsenic trioxide inhibits growth and promotes apoptosis in many different cancer cell lines and began a research programme to evaluate its clinical activity in haematologic malignancies, such as acute promyelocytic leukaemia, acute myeloid leukaemia, acute' lymphocytic leukaemia, chronic myelogenous leukaemia, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Hodgkin's disease, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, and multiple myeloma. It is also supporting research in solid tumours, such as advanced hormone-refractory prostate cancer and renal cell cancer and in cervical cancer and refractory transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder.<br>
Other clinical studies are underway, including Phase II Studies in Solid Tumours.. Based on promising pre-clinical<br>
data, NCI-sponsored clinical trials to examine the potential of arsenic trioxide for the treatment of solid tumours are under way or in the final planning stage's.<br>
4.Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a pharmaceutical composition intended for the treatment of urogenital diseases and bone metastasis and to a method of treating such diseases.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition intended for the treatment of urogenital diseases and bone metastasis in a human, wherein said pharmaceutical composition contains an effective amount of arsenous acid alkaline or earth alkaline metal salt and/or a pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvant.<br>
According to the present invention, said alkaline arsenous acid metal salt is sodium meta-arsenite (AsC&gt;2Na) or potassium meta-arsenite (As02K) .<br>
The effective amount of arsenous acid alkaline or earth alkaline metal salt is 0.0001-1500 mg/kg, preferably 1-1000 mg/kg, more preferably 1-150 mg/kg, and most preferably 50-100 mg/kg of body weight/day.<br>
Said pharmaceutical composition preferably occurs in an oral administration form, wherein said oral administration form is e.g. a tablet, capsule, powder and/or solution with<br>
a pharraaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or excipient.<br>
Said urogenital disease comprises essentially cancer of the prostate, bladder, kidney and testis.<br>
According to the invention, a chemotherapeutic product comprises of arsenous acid sodium salt having the formula (I):<br>
0=As-O~Na+<br>
Furthermore, the invention includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising such products together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or diluent. Suitable carriers and diluents are well known, as are the principles of formulation of compositions in unit dosage form and for oral administration.<br>
In a further aspect, the invention includes a method for the treatment of cancer in an animal or human body, the method comprising the simultaneous, separate or sequential administration to the said body of arsenous acid sodium salt.<br>
The Inventor has explored the potency of three arsenic compounds of different valence and methylation in panels of human tumour cell lines in vitro, arsenous acid sodium salt (A33+), dimethylarsinic acid (As5"1") and arsenic acid (As5+) . Surprisingly arsenous acid sodium salt was the most potent and showed anti-tumour activity in a human tumour model in<br>
vivo, reason to develop arsenous acid sodium salt further as a novel arsenic compound. Arsenous acid sodium salt surprisingly was more potent in vitro and showed differential activity in leukaemia, melanoma and mammary cancer lines than AsaOa. Arsenous acid sodium salt is surprisingly capable of shortening telomeres of human cancer cells, inducing cellular senescence and chromosomal abnormalities, but does not directly inhibit the telomerase activity. The effects indicate that arsenous acid sodium salt is a telomere inhibitor. Arsenous acid sodium salt was rapidly absorbed after both i.v. and p.o. administration and remained in the plasma for prolonged periods. Surprisingly the bioavailability of oral arsenous acid sodium salt was approximately 100%. Animal toxicity studies showed that the main target organs were bone marrow and lymphoid organs. Thus arsenous acid sodium salt can be administered orally. It might be used in long-term treatment of cancer patients with solid tumours or leukaemia at dose levels below the maximum tolerated dose (MTD), alone or in combination with another treatment modality, maintaining a good quality of life.<br>
This compound (NaAs02) of the present invention has been developed as novel anti-cancer agent. The compound possesses good cytotoxic activity in a panel of 43 human tumour cell lines in vitro with an IC50 value of 0.6 uM. Pronounced selectivity was observed in tumour cell lines derived from leukaemia, mammary cancer and melanoma. In a head-to-head comparison arsenous acid sodium salt was surprisingly at least 15-fold more potent than the clinically used agent arsenic trioxide and had also a<br>
better differential activity.	Arsenous acid sodium salt<br>
combined with 5-fluoruracil	(5-FU)  or vinblastine may<br>
result in additive effects.	Potassium in the arsenite<br>
reduced cytotoxic activity.<br>
In vivo arsenous acid sodium salt (oral and intraperitoneal) was surprisingly borderline active in 2/7 subcutaneously transplanted human tumour xenografts (renal cell carcinoma RXF 944LX and mammary cancer MAXF 401) . In general the highest efficacy of arsenous acid sodium salt was obtained with doses of 1/3-2/3 of the maximum tolerated dose (MTD) . The efficacy of the compound was better using daily administrations of 5 or more days compared with intermittent schedules (every 4 days x3, weekly x 3).<br>
Surprisingly, oral arsenous acid sodium salt showed a high therapeutic efficacy in cancer patients suffering from urogenital cancer, mainly prostate and bone metastasis, following treatment with 2.5, 10, 12.5, 15, 17.5 and 20 mg of arsenous acid sodium salt capsules for 14 consecutive days.<br>
Surprisingly the patients all tolerated the arsenous acid sodium salt extremely well with no adverse events (AE's) or serious adverse events (SAE's) occurring. The study medication did not cause any disturbance of any patients' well-being feeling. There was no change during the course of the study in any patients' EGG activity, audiometry or neurological examinations.<br>
Surprisingly arsenous acid sodium salt, the compound of invention, has great therapeutic and safety advantages in comparison to arsenic trioxide. Arsenic trioxide AsaOa has been shown to prolong the QT and QT interval corrected for rate (QTC) , which may predispose the patient to potentially fatal aytipical ventricular tachycardia and produce complete atrioventricular block.<br>
Further more, adverse events occurring in 10% or more of<br>
patients treated with arsenic trioxide include fatigue,<br>
fever,  oedema,  chest pain,  rigors,  reactions  at  the<br>
injection site  (ie pain,  erythema,  oedema) ,  weakness,<br>
weight  gain,  nausea,  anorexia,  decreased  appetite,<br>
diarrhoea or  loose  stools,  vomiting,  abdominal  pain,<br>
dyspepsia,   sore  throat,   constipation,   hypokalemia,<br>
hypomagnesemia, increases in serum AST (SCOT) and/or ALT<br>
(SGPT) ,  hyper kalemia,  hypocalcemia,  headache,  insomnia,<br>
paresthesia, dizziness, tremor, cough, dyspnea, epistaxis,<br>
hypoxia,  pleural  effusion,  postnasal  drip,  wheezing,<br>
decreased breath sounds, crepitations, rales, dermatitis,<br>
pruritus,  ecchymosis,  dry  skin,  erythema,  sweating,<br>
tachycardia, EGG abnormalities, sinusitis, herpes simplex,<br>
upper respiratory infection,  arthralgia,  myalgia,  bone<br>
pain,  back pain,  neck pain,  limb pain,  leukocytosis,<br>
anaemia,  thrombocytopenia, neutopenia  (may be febrile) ,<br>
hypotension,  hypertension,  flushing,  pallor,  anxiety,<br>
depression, ocular irritation, blurred vision and vaginal<br>
haemorrhage.<br>
Surprisingly none of these adverse events have been observed using the oral arsenous acid sodium salt, which is the compound of the present invention. . .<br>

solvents,  dispersion 'media,  coatings,  antibacterial and<br>
anti  fungal  agents,  isotonic  and absorption  delaying<br>
agents, and the like that are physiologically compatible.<br>
For example, the carrier can be suitable for injection into<br>
the blood. Excipients include pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
stabilizers and disintegrants. In another embodiment, the<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable formulations comprise lipid-<br>
based formulations. Any of the known lipid-based drug<br>
delivery systems can be used in the practice of the<br>
invention. For instance, multi-vesicular liposomes (MVL) ,<br>
multi-lamellar liposomes  (also known as multi-lamellar<br>
vesicles or MLV) , uni-lamellar liposomes, including small<br>
uni-lamellar liposomes (also known as uni-lamellar vesicles<br>
or SUV) and large uni-lamellar liposomes (also known as<br>
large uni-lamellar vesicles or LUV) , can all be used so<br>
long as a sustained release rate of the encapsulated<br>
compounds can be established. In one embodiment, the lipid-<br>
based formulation can be a multi-vesicular liposome system.<br>
The. composition of the  synthetic membrane vesicle is<br>
usually  a  combination  of  phospholipids,  usually  in<br>
combination with steroids, especially cholcompoundol. Other<br>
phospholipids or other lipids may also be used. Examples of<br>
lipids useful in synthetic membrane vesicle production<br>
include    phosphatidylglycerols,    phosphatidylcholines,<br>
phosphatidylserines,	phosphatidylethanolaminos,'<br>
sphingolipids, cerebrosides, and gangliosides. Preferably phospholipids    including    egg    phosphatidylcholine,<br>
dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine,<br>
dist earoylphosphat idylcholine , dioleoylphosphatidylcholine ,<br>
dipalmitoylphosphat idylglycerol ,	and<br>
dioleoylphosphatidylglycerol   are   used.   In   another embodiment, the composition containing the compound may be incorporated or impregnated into a bio-absorbable matrix. In addition, the matrix may be comprised of the said biopolymer. A suitable biopolymer for the present invention can include also one or more macromolecules selected from the group consisting of collagen, elastin,  fibronectin, vitronectin, laminin, polyglycolic acid, hyaluronic acid, chondroitin sulphate, dermatan sulphate, heparin sulphate, heparin,   fibrin,   cellulose,   gelatin,   polylysine, echinonectin,   entactin,   thrombospondin,   uvomorulin, biglycan, decorin, and dextran. The formulation of these macromolecules into a biopolymer is well known in the art. In a preferred embodiment, the therapeutic composition is not immunogenic when administered to a human patient for therapeutic purposes.<br>
A therapeutic composition of the present invention can include pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the components therein. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts include the acid addition salts that are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, tartaric, mandelic and the like. Physiologically tolerable carriers are well known in the art. Exemplary of liquid carriers are sterile aqueous solutions that contain no materials in addition to the active ingredients and water, or contain a buffer such as sodium phosphate at physiological pH value.,- .physiological-<br>
<br>
saline or both, such as phosphate-buffered saline. Still further, aqueous carriers can contain more than one buffer salt, as well as salts such as sodium and potassium chlorides, dextrose, propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and other solutes. Liquid compositions can also contain liquid phases in addition to and to the exclusion of water. Exemplary of such additional liquid phases are glycerine, vegetable oils such as cottonseed oil, organic compounds such as ethyl oleate, and water-oil emulsions. A therapeutic composition contains a polypeptide of the present invention, typically an amount of at least 0.1 weight percent of polypeptide per weight of total therapeutic composition. A weight percent' is a ratio by weight of polypeptide to total composition. Thus, for example, 0.1 weight percent is 0.1 grams of polypeptide per 100 grams of total composition.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to those salts of compounds which retain the biological effectiveness and properties of the free bases and which are obtained by reaction with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulphuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, atoluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. • The pharmaceutical composition containing the active ingredient may be in a form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be prepared according to any method known to. the art. . for ...the.-, manufacture • of<br>
pharmaceutical  compositions  and  such  compositions• may contain  one  or more agents  selected from the  group consisting  of  sweetening  agents,  flavouring  agents, colouring agents and preserving agents in order to provide pharmaceutically  elegant  and  palatable  preparations. Tablets contain the active ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients, which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for example,  inert diluents,  such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose, calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents, for example corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch, gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example magnesium stearate, stearic acid or talc. The tablets may be uncoated or they may be coated by known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a time delay material  such  as  glyceryl  monostearate  or  glyceryl distearate may be employed. They may also be coated by the techniques described in the U.S.  Pat.  Nos.  4,256,108; 4,166,452;  and 4,265,874,  to  form osmotic therapeutic tablets for control release. A pharmaceutical composition may also, or alternatively, contain one or more drugs, which may be linked to a modulating agent or may be free within  the  composition.  Virtually  any  drug  may  be administered in combination with a modulating agent as described herein, for a variety of purposes as described below. Examples of types of drugs that may be administered with a modulating agent include analgesics, anaesthetics, antianginals, antifungals,. . antibiotics,, anti-cancer drugs<br>

Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules where in the active ingredient is* mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example calcium carbonate, calcium phosphate or kaolin', or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the active ingredient is mixed with water or an oil medium, for example peanut oil, liquid paraffin or olive oil.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active materials in a mixture with excipients suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are suspending agents, for example sodium. carboxymethylcel.lulose.,. .methylcellulo.se,<br>
hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate polyvinyl-<br>
pyrolidone, gum tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or<br>
wetting agents may be a naturally occurring phosphatide,<br>
for example lecithin,  or condensation products of an<br>
alkylene   oxide   with   fatty   acids,   for.   example<br>
polyoxyethylene  stearate,  or  condensation  products  of<br>
ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for<br>
example   heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol,   or   condensation<br>
products of ethylene oxide with partial compounds derived<br>
from fatty acids and a hexitol such a polyoxyethylene with<br>
partial compounds derived from fatty acids and hexitol<br>
anhydrides,   for   example   polyoxyethylene   sorbitan<br>
monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain one or<br>
more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-<br>
hydroxybenzoate, one or more colouring agents, one or more<br>
flavouring agents, and one or more sweetening agents, such<br>
as sucrose or saccharin.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a vegetable oil, for example arachis oil, olive oil, sesame oil or coconut oil, or in a mineral oil such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents such -as those set forth above, and flavouring agents may be added to provide a palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by the addition of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous suspension by the addition of water provide<br>
the active ingredient in admixture with a dispersing or wetting  agent,  suspending  agent  and  one  or  more preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents . and suspending agents are exemplified, for example sweetening, flavouring and colouring agents, may also be present.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of oil-in-water emulsions. The oily phase may be a vegetable oil, for example olive oil or arachis oil, or a mineral oil, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these. Suitable emulsifying agents may be naturally-occurring gums, for example gum acacia or gum<br>
»<br>

Syrups and elixirs may be formulated with sweetening agents, for example glycerol, propylene glycol, sorbitol or sucrose. Such formulations may also contain a demulcent, a preservative and flavouring and colouring agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents, which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable ' preparation may also be in a sterile injectable solution or .suspension in a non-toxic<br>
parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as absolution in 1,3-butane diol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For this purpose any bland fixed oil may be employed including synthetic mono-or diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation of injectables.<br>
Dosage levels of the order of from about 0.05 mg to about 140 mg per kilogram of body weight per: day are useful in<br>
»<br>
the treatment of the above-indicated conditions (about 2.5 mg to about 7 g per patient per day) . For example, inflammation may be effectively treated by the administration of from about 0.01 to 50 mg of the compound per kilogram of body weight per day (about 0.5 mg to about 3.5 g per patient per day). The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and the particular mode of administration. For example, a formulation intended-for the oral administration of humans may vary from about 5 to about 95% of the total composition. Dosage unit forms will generally contain between from about 1 mg to about 500 mg of active ingredient. It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the activity of the specific compound employed, the age, body weight, general health, sex, . diet time of administration, route of administration, rate of excretion, drug_combination and theseverity  of  the particular 'disease undergoing  therapy.   The dosage    effective    amount    of    compounds    according    to    the invention   will   vary   depending   upon   factors   including   the particular compound,   toxicity,   and inhibitory activity,   the condition treated,   and whether the compound is administered alone or with other therapies.   Typically a dosage  effective amount   will   range   from   about   0.0001  mg/kg   to   1500   mg/kg, more preferably 1 to 1000 mg/kg,  more preferably from about 1  to  150 mg/kg of body weight,   and most preferably about  50 to  100 mg/kg of body weight.   The invention  relates  also  to a     process     or     a     method     for     the     treatment     of     the abovementioned   pathological   conditions.    The   compounds   of the  present   invention can  be  administered prophylactically or     therapeutically,     preferably    in    an    amount     that     is effective    against    the    mentioned    disorders,     to    a    warmblooded    animal,     for    example     a    human,     requiring   .such treatment,   the  compounds  preferably being used in  the  form of pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
Formulation of pharmaceutically-acceptable excipients and carrier solutions is well-known to those of skill in the art, as is the development of suitable dosing and treatment regimens for using the particular compositions described herein in a variety of 'treatment regimens, including e.g., oral, parenteral, intravenous, intranasal, and intramuscular administration and formulation.<br>
5 . 3.. 1 Oral Delivery<br>
In   certain   applications,    the   pharmaceutical    compositions disclosed  herein may  be   delivered  via   oral,.administration<br>
<br>
to an animal. As such, these compositions may be formulated with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or they may be enclosed in hard- or soft-shell gelatin capsule, or they may be compressed into tablets, or they may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet.<br>
The active compounds may even be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of ingestible tablets, buccal tables, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers, and the like. The tablets, troches, pills, capsules and the like may also contain the following: a<br>
*<br>
binder, as gum tragacanth, acacia, cornstarch, or gelatin;<br>
excipients, such as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating<br>
agent, such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic acid and<br>
the like; a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate; and a<br>
sweetening agent, such as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may<br>
be added or a flavouring agent, such as peppermint, oil of<br>
wintergreen, or cherry flavouring. When the dosage unit<br>
form is a capsule, it may contain, in addition to materials<br>
off the  above  type,  a  liquid carrier.  Various  other<br>
materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify<br>
the physical  form of the dosage unit.  For instance,<br>
tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with shellac,<br>
sugar, or both. Syrup of elixir may contain the active<br>
compound  sucrose  as  a  sweetening  agent  methyl  and<br>
propylparabens as preservatives, a dye and flavouring, such<br>
as cherry or orange flavour. Of course, any material used<br>
in  preparing   any  dosage   unit   form   should  be<br>
pharmaceutically pure and substantially non-toxic in the<br>
amounts employed. In addition, the. active compounds may be<br>
<br>
incorporated  into  sustained-release  preparation  and formulations.<br>
Typically, these formulations may contain at least about 0.1% of the active compound or more, although the percentage of the active ingredient(s) may, of course, be varied and may conveniently be between about 1 or 2% and about 60% or 70% or more of the weight or volume of the total formulation. Naturally, the amount of active compound(s) in each therapeutically useful composition may be prepared is such a way that a suitable dosage will be obtained in any given unit dose of the compound. Factors such as solubility, bioavailability, biological half-life, route of administration, product shelf life, as .well as other pharmacological considerations will be contemplated by one skilled in the art of preparing such pharmaceutical formulations, and as such, a variety of dosages and treatment regimens may be desirable.<br>
For oral administration the compositions of the present invention may alternatively be incorporated with one or more excipients in the form of a mouthwash, dentifrice, buccal tablet, oral spray, or sublingual orally administered formulation. For example, a mouthwash may be prepared incorporating the active ingredient in the required amount in an appropriate solvent, such as a sodium •borate solution (Dobell's Solution). Alternatively, the active ingredient may be incorporated into an oral solution such as one containing sodium borate, glycerine and potassium bicarbonate, or dispersed in a dentifrice, or added in a therapeutical-ly-e-ffeotiv-e amount to a<br>
composition that may include water, binders, abrasives, flavouring agents, foaming agents, and humectants. Alternatively the compositions may be fashioned into a tablet or solution form that may be placed under the tongue or otherwise dissolved in the mouth.<br>
5.1.2 Injectable Delivery<br>
In certain circumstances it will be desirable to deliver the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or even intraperitoneally. Solutions of the active compounds as freebase or pharmacologically acceptable salts may be prepared in water suitably mixed with a surfactant, such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions may also be prepared in glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary conditions of storage and use, these preparations contain a preservative to prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
The pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile injectable solutions or dispersions. In all cases the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol, polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol,... and. .. the. .li.ke)...r suitable mixtures-<br>
thereof, and/or vegetable oils. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance, of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants. The prevention of the action of microorganisms can be facilitated by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example, aluminium monostearate and gelatin.<br>
For parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, for<br>
example, the solution should be suitably buffered if<br>
necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic<br>
w±th sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous<br>
solutions are especially suitable for intravenous,<br>
intramuscular,	subcutaneous	and	intraperitoneal<br>
administration. In this connection, a sterile aqueous medium that can be employed will be known to~those of skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. For example, one dosage may be dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion. Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject being treated. The person responsible for administration will, in .any event, determine the'appropriate dose for the individual subject. Moreover, for. human, admlnistration, preparations . should .<br>
meet sterility, pyrogenicity, and the general safety and purity standards as required by national or regional offices of biologies standards.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions are prepared by incorporating the active compounds in the required amount in the appropriate solvent with several of the other ingredients enumerated above, as required, followed by filtered<br>
/<br>
sterilization. Generally, dispersions are prepared by incorporating the 'various sterilized active ingredients into a sterile vehicle which contains the basic dispersion medium and the required other ingredients from those enumerated above. In the case of sterile powders for the preparation of sterile injectable solutions, the preferred methods of preparation are vacuum-drying and freeze-drying techniques which•yield a powder of the active ingredient plus any additional desired ingredient from a previously sterile-filtered solution thereof.<br>
The compositions disclosed herein may be formulated in a neutral or salt form. Pharmace'utically-acceptable salts, include the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the protein) and which are formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic, and the like. Salts formed with the free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example, sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, histidine, procaine and the like. Upon formulation, solutions will be administered in a<br>
manner compatible with the dosage formulation and in such amount as is therapeutically effective. The formulations are easily administered in a variety of dosage forms such as injectable solutions, drug-release capsules, and the like.<br>
As used herein, "carrier" includes any and all solvents, dispersion media, vehicles, coatings, diluents, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying agents, buffers, carrier solutions, suspensions, colloids, and the like. The use of such media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients can also be incorporated into the compositions.<br>
The phrase "pharmaceutically-acceptable" refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction when administered to a human. The preparation of an aqueous composition that contains a protein as an active ingredient is well understood in the art. Typically, such compositions are prepared as injectables, either as liquid solutions or suspensions; solid forms suitable for solution in, or suspension in, liquid prior to injection can also be prepared. The preparation can also be emulsified.<br>
5.1.3 Nasal Delivery<br>
In certain embodiments, intranasal sprays, inhalation,' and/or other aerosol delivery vehicles may deliver the pharmaceutical compositions. Likewise, the delivery of drugs using intranasal microparticle resins and lysophosphatidyl-glycerol compounds are also well known in the pharmaceutical arts.<br>
5.2 Target cancers<br>
The subjects treated will typically comprise of mammals and most preferably will be human subjects e.g. .human cancer subjects. The compounds of the invention may be used alone or in combination. Additionally the treated compounds may be utilised with other types of treatments. For example, the subject compounds may be used with other chemotherapies e.g. tamoxifen, taxol, methothrexate, biologicals such as antibodies, growth factors or lymphokines, radiation etc. Combination therapies may result in synergistic results. The preferred indication is cancer especially the cancers identified previously.<br>
The compositions and methods provided herein are particularly deemed useful.for the treatment of primary and metastatic neoplastic tumours including solid tumours such as breast, central nervous system, colon, ovarian, kidney, lung, liver, bladder, prostate, head and neck etc. More specifically, tumours, which may be treated by the compositions and methods of the invention, include tumours of an epithelial origin such as, but not limited to:<br>

afflicted by any one of the above-identified conditions.<br>
The term "leukaemia" refers broadly to progressive, malignant diseases of the blood-forming organs and is generally characterized by a distorted proliferation and development of leukocytes and their precursors in the blood and bone marrow. Leukaemia is generally clinically classified on the basis of (1) the duration and character<br>
of   the   disease-acute    or   chronic;     (2)    the    type    of    cell<br>
involved;   myeloid    (myelogenous),    lymphoid    (lymphogenous),<br>
or  monocytic   and   (3)    the   increase   or   non-increase   in   the<br>
number  abnormal   cells   in the.blood-leukaemia  or  aleukaemic<br>
(subleukaemic).   The  P388 leukaemia model  is  widely accepted<br>
as  being  predictive  of  in vivo  anti-leukaemic  activity.   It<br>
is   believed  that   compound  that  tests  positive   in  the   P388<br>
assay  will   generally  exhibit   some   level   of   anti-leukaemic<br>
activity  in  vivo  regardless  of the  type  of  leukaemia  being<br>
treated.    Accordingly,     the    present    invention    includes    a<br>
method of  treating  leukaemia,   and,   preferably,   a method of<br>

6. Working examples<br>
The following subsections describe the testing of a pharmaceutical composition comprising arsenous acid sodium salt in vivo using cancer patients. The results demonstrate that arsenous acid sodium salt administered orally is effective in the treatment of urogenital cancer.<br>
6.1 Methods and materials<br>
Cancer patients suffering from prostate and/or urogenital cancer have been treated in an ICH-GCP clinical study with oral arsenous acid sodium salt. The patients were suffering from urogenital cancer, mainly prostate cancer and bone metastasis, not amenable to any established methods of therapy and were treated with arsenous acid sodium salt over 7 different dosing levels. Arsenous acid sodium salt is thought to act as a telomere poison as it is capable of shortening the telomeres of human cancer cells, which leads to chromosomal abnormalities but doesn't inhibit telomerase activity.<br>
Arsenous acid sodium salt was taken daily for 14 consecutive days according to the dose level treatment scheme below:<br>
Treatment Level 1: One capsule each 2.5 mg sodium meta-<br>
arsenite daily (every 24' hours) Prior to breakfast<br>
<br>
Treatnient Level 2:  Two capsules each 2.5 mg arsenous acid<br>
sodium salt daily 1 prior to breakfast, 1 prior to dinner<br>
Treatment Level 3:  Four capsules each 2.5 mg arsenous acid<br>
sodium salt daily 1 prior to breakfast, 2 prior to lunch,<br>
1	prior to dinner<br>
Treatment Level 4:    Five capsules each 2.5 mg arsenous acid<br>
sodium salt daily<br>
2	prior to breakfast,   2 prior to lunch,<br>
i<br>
1	prior to dinner<br>
-„) Treatment  Level  5:   Six  capsules   each   2.5  mg  arsenous   acid<br>
sodium salt daily<br>
2	prior to breakfast,   2 prior to  lunch,<br>
2 prior to dinner<br>
Patient     visits    were    planned    for    the    control     of    the<br>
•<br>
compliance, toxicity and safety and were held as follows:<br>
Visit 1: was held between day -7 and day 0 (start of treatment)<br>
Visit 2: on the first day of treatment with sodium meta-arsenite<br>
Visit 3:  on day 8 of treatment with arsenous acid sodium salt<br>
Visit 4: on day 15 (approx. 24 hours) after the completion of 14 consecutive days of treatment with arsenous acid sodium salt<br>
Visit 5: on day 22 (approx. 7 days after the completion of 14 consecutive days of treatment with arsenous acid sodium salt<br>
Visit 6: on day 42 (approx.'28 days) after the completion of the 14 days consecutive days of treatment with arsenous acid sodium salt<br>
The following target parameters were assessed during this study: toxicity profile, efficacy, liver enzyme parameters (GOT, GPT, a-GT, AP) , kidney function, haematology functions, tumour marker evaluations (CEA and PSA) and the pharmacokinetics of arsenous acid sodium salt.<br>
6.2 Results<br>
Below is a summary of the clinical findings for each patient involved in this study. The findings reported include the values for the tumour markers CEA (carcinoembryonal antigen) and PSA (prostate specific antigen) and results for efficacy, toxicity and safety.<br>
Table 1 and 2 presents the summary of patient details with PSA and CEA values:<br>

(Table Removed)<br>
Table 2 Arsenous acid sodium salt dose groups 2 and 4<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Suprisingly, the patients all tolerated the arsenous acid sodium salt extremely well. No adverse events (AE's) or serious adverse events (SAE's) occurred. The study medication did not cause any disturbance of any patient's well-being feeling. There was no change during the course of the study in any patient's ECG activity, audiometry or neurological examinations. None of the patients had radiotherapy prior to treatment with arsenous acid sodium salt. The arsenous acid sodium salt showed a high level of efficacy.<br>
6.2.1 Example 1; Patient K.F.<br>
»<br>
Histology: Advanced, inoperable, solid prostate cancer with infiltration of the rectal mucosal wall, 11.02.2004<br>
Stage: Dukes C, pT 4 Gleason score 6 Therapy<br>
Since the patient suffers from a coronary heart disease with a myocardial infarction and implantation of coronary stents, a radical prostatovesiculectoray could not be performed and a full androgen ablation with a LHRH antagonist (one profact s.c injection every 3 months) and an oral antiandrogen (androcur tablets dosage Ixl/d after lunch) was initiated. A palliative transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) to ameliorate micturition was performed in May 2004.<br>
This patient took part in the dose levels 1, 3 and 5 of the arsenous acid sodium salt study.   The results for this<br>
Si-patient indicate a clinically significant change in PSA levels for all 3 drug dose levels. Dose level one (2.5mg arsenous acid sodium salt) indicated a significant decrease in PSA from 0.29 ng/ml to 0.16 ng/ml. This decrease corresponds to a reduction in tumour activity of 44.83%. Dose level three (lOmg arsenous acid sodium salt) indicate an increase of PSA from 0.16 to 0.18 ng/ml. Dose level five (12.5mg arsenous acid sodium salt) again indicates an increase, this time from 0.17 to 0.18 ng/ml. Neither dose level 3 or 5 showed any significant change in tumour activity.<br>
Dose level one showed a decrease in tumour size from 20x35mm to 20x34mm. Dose level three also showed a decrease from 20x35 to 20x34mm while dose level five showed no change in size from 20x34mm.<br>
The secondary parameters (safety parameters) showed no clinically significant results at any of the dose levels. A reversible increase in liver transaminases sGPT and sGOT was observed during the intake of arsenous acid sodium salt in dose group III and V (visit 3 and 4) . In visit 5 the transaminases almost returned " to normal values. This increase seems to be related to the administration of the investigative drug arsenous acid sodium salt.<br>
The evaluation/judgement of clinical response/progression for dose level one was that: of a partial response. For both dose levels three and five, the disease showed stability.<br>
6.2.2 Example 2 ; Patient G.R.<br>
Histology: Advanced, inoperable, solid prostate cancer with an extraglandular tumour growth<br>
Stage: Dukes C, pT 4 Gleason score 4 Therapy<br>
As well as suffering from a prostate carcinoma, this patient also suffered from a renal cell carcinoma (since cured by radical nephrectomy) and a superficial bladder cancer (no tumour recurrence). The,patient was included in the study due the continued rising of PSA levels after a complete androgen ablation with a LHRH antagonist (one profact s.c injection every 3 months) and an oral antiandrogen (casodex tablets dosage 1xl/d after lunch).<br>
This patient took part in the dose levels 1, 3 and 5 of the<br>
•<br>
arsenous acid sodium salt study. The results for this patient indicate a clinically significant change in PSA levels for all 3 arsenous acid sodium salt dose levels. Dose level one indicated a significant decrease in PSA from 1.61 ng/ml to 0.37 ng/ml. This decrease corresponds to a reduction in tumour activity of 77.1%. Dose levels three and five indicate a decrease of PSA from 0.37 to 0.12 ng/ml and 0.11 to 0.07 ng/ml respectively. Dose level three showed a reduction in tumour activity of a further 67.56%, while dose level five showed no significant change.<br>
Dose level one showed a decrease in tumour size from 12.5x65mm to 0.8x30rrau. Dose level three also showed a decrease in the prostate tumour from 60x25 to 50x25 mm while dose level five showed no change in size.<br>
The secondary parameters (safety parameters) showed no clinically significant results at any of the dose levels. Pre-study elevated triglycerides and cholesterol level had been detected which were unchanged during the course of the study. Glucose levels always appeared elevated which could be explained by alimentary reasons since blood probes were always taken in the morning after an opulent breakfast.<br>
The evaluation/judgement of clinical response/progression for all three dose levels was that of a partial response.<br>
6.2.3 Example 3 ; Patient E.S.<br>
Histology: Advanced, inoperable, solid, androgen resistant prostate cancer with an extra-capsular tumour growth.<br>
Stage: Dukes C, pT 4 Gleason score 4 Therapy<br>
As well as suffering from a prostate carcinoma, this patient also suffers from rectum cancer. This patient was included because of the advanced and inoperable situation. An androgen ablation with a LHRH antagonist (one profact s.c injection every 3 months) has been performed.<br>
This patient took part in the dose levels 1, 3 and 5 of the arsenous acid sodium salt study. The results for this patient indicate a clinically significant change in PSA levels for all 3 drug dose levels. Dose levels one and three indicate a decrease of PSA from 0.24 ng/ml to 0.11 ng/ml and 0.11 to 0.08 ng/ml respectively. Dose level five showed no change from 0.09 ng/ml. Dose level one showed a reduction in tumour activity of 54.12% and level three, a further 67.56%. Dose level five showed no significant change.<br>
Dose level one showed a decrease in tumour size from 30x35mm to 30x30mm. Dose levels three and five showed no change in size.<br>
The secondary parameters (safety parameters) showed no clinically significant results at any of the dose levels. A reversible, and slight increase in sGPT was detected.<br>
The evaluation/judgement: of clinical response/progression for dose levels one and three was that of a partial response. Dose level five showed disease stability.<br>
6.2.4 Example 4; Patient J.S.<br>
Histology: Advanced, inoperable, androgen-resistant solid prostate cancer with an extra-glandular tumour growth.<br>
Stage: Dukes C, pT 4 Gleason score 8<br>
<br>
Therapy<br>
The patient was included in the study due the continued rising of PSA levels after subcapsular orchiectomy for androgen ablation.<br>
This patient took part in the dose levels 1, 3 and 5 of the arsenous acid sodium salt study. The results for this patient indicate a clinically significant change in PSA levels for all 3 drug dose levels. Dose level one indicated an increase in PSA from 0.19 ng/ml to 0.21 ng/ml. Dose levels three and five indicate an increase of PSA from 0.21 ng/ml to 0.27 ng/ml and a decrease of PSA from 0.27 to 0.24 ng/ml respectively. Dose levels one and three showed an increase in tumour progression while dose level five showed no significant change.<br>
Dose level one showed an increase in tumour size from 30x3Omm to 35x35mm. Dose levels three and five showed no change from 30x35mm.<br>
The secondary parameters (safety parameters) showed no clinically significant 'results at any of the dose levels. A pre-study existing elevation of sGGT and thrombocytosis remained unchanged during the course of the study.<br>
The evaluation/judgement of clinical response/progression for dose levels one and three was .that of progression of disease. Dose level five showed a partial response to the arsenous acid sodium salt.<br>
<br>
6.2.5 Example 5: Patient D.B.<br>
Histology: Local recurrence of a solid prostate cancer after radical prostatectomy (stage pT2C Gleason 6) with bladder neck infiltration, inoperable.<br>
Stage: Dukes C, pT 4 Gleason score 6<br>
Therapy<br>
This patient was included in the study due the continued rising of PSA levels after radical prostatectomy and complete androgen ablation with a LHRH- antagonist (one profact s.c injection every 3 months) and an oral antiandrogen (casodex tablets dosage 1xl/d after lunch).<br>
This patient took part in the dose levels 1, 3 and 5 of the arsenous acid sodium salt study. The results for this patient indicate a clinically significant change in PSA levels for drug dose levels one. Dose level one indicated a significant decrease in PSA from 0.45 ng/ml to 0.04 ng/ml. This decrease corresponds to a reduction in tumour activity of 91.11%. Dose levels three and five showed no change from 0.04 ng/ml.<br>
The measurement of tumour lesions was not obtainable by any of the standard measuring means.<br>
The secondary parameters (safety parameters) showed no clinically significant results at any of the dose levels. A reversible increase of liver transaminases sGOT, sGPT and sGGT was observed.<br>
<br>
The evaluation/judgement of clinical response/progression for dose level one was that of a partial response. For both dose levels three and five, the disease showed a complete response to the arsenous acid sodium salt.<br>
6.2.6 Example 6; Patient H-W.S.<br>
Histology: Advanced, inoperable, solid prostate cancer with an extraglandular tumour growth in the bladder neck and pelvic wall and a dissemination of bone metastases.<br>
Stage: Dukes C, pT 4 Gleason score 9 M2 Therapy<br>
The patient was included in the study because of the advanced status of the detected prostate cancer' with multiple bone metastases invading the whole skeleton. A complete androgen ablation with a LHRH antagonist (one prof act s.c injection every 3 months) and an oral<br>
•<br>
antiandrogen (casodex tablets dosage Ixl/d after lunch) was performed.<br>
This patient took part in the dose levels 2 and 4 of the arsenous acid sodium salt study. The results for this patient indicate a clinically significant change in PSA levels for both drug dose levels. Dose level two indicated a decrease in PSA from 725 ng/ml to 6.15 ng/ml with a decrease in tumour activity of 99.15%, while dose level four indicated a decrease of PSA from 6.15 ng/ml to 3.67 ng/ml with a further tumour activity reduction of 40.32%.<br>
Dose level two showed a decrease in tumour size from 65x40mm to 15x30mm while dose level four showed no change in size froml5x40mm.<br>
The secondary parameters (safety parameters) showed no clinically significant results at any of the dose, levels. The patients' quality of life was strongly ameliorated by arsenous acid sodium salt. A pre-study elevation of sGGT due to alcohol consumption worsened during the course of the study. The hemoglobin concentration increased from 10.0 to 11.1 g/1 whereas the PSA decreased from 725 to 3.67 ng/ml.<br>
The evaluation./judgement of clinical response/progression for both dose levels was that of a partial response to the arsenous acid sodium salt.<br>
6.3 Conclusion<br>
Overall those patients taking part in dose levels 1, 3 and 5 showed, for the most part, a reduction in their PSA levels and tumour size. Most patients showed at least a partial response to the arsenous acid sodium salt with one patient showing a stable disease status. The" patient in dose levels 2 and' 4, H-W.S., showed a very clear response to the arsenous acid sodium salt treatment with PSA levels decreasing dramatically (99.15% reduction in tumour activity) as well as a considerable decrease in tumour size. The safety (laboratory) parameters showed no clinically -significant.. results. • The arsenous acid sodium<br>
salt was surprisingly very well tolerated with no AE' s or SAE'S occurring. Overall the oral arsenous acid sodium salt, even at low doses and for relatively short treatment periods, showed a surprisingly very positive response for the treatment of prostate and/or urogenital cancer and bone metastasis.<br>
