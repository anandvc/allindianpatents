BAYER AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT, a body corporate organised under the laws of Germany, of D-51368 Leverkusen, Germany,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br>

Selective herbicides based on substituted cyclic ketoenols and safeners<br>
The invention relates to novel selective herbicidal active compound combinations<br>
which comprise substituted cyclic ketoenols, on the one hand, and at least one<br>
compound which improves crop plant compatibility, on the other, and which can be<br>
5	used with particularly good results for the selective control of weeds in various crops of<br>
useful plants.<br>
Unsubstituted   bicyclic    3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione   derivatives    (EP-A-355 599,<br>
EP-A-415 211 and JP 12-053 670) and substituted monocyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-<br>
10	dione derivatives (EP-A-377 893 and EP-A-442 077) having herbicidal action are<br>
already known.<br>
Also known are polycyclic 3-arylpyrrolidine-2,4-dione derivatives (EP-A-442 073) and      lH-arylpyrrolidinedione     derivatives      (EP-A-456 063,      EP-A-521 334,<br>
15	EP-A-596 298,   EP-A-613 884,   EP-A-613 885,   WO 94/01 997,   WO 95/26 954,<br>

Also known are 3-aryl-D3-dihydrofuranone derivatives having herbicidal properties, from EP-A-528 156, EP-A-0 647 637, WO 95/26 345, WO 96/20 196, WO 96/25 395, WO 96/35 664, WO 97/01 535, WO 97/02 243, WO 97/36 868, WO 98/05638,  WO  98/25928,  WO  99/16748,  WO  99/43649,  WO  99/48869,<br>
25	WO 99/55673, JP 12-239 276 and WO 01/17972.  3-Aryl-A3-dihydrothiophenone<br>
derivatives, too, are known (WO 95/26 345, WO 96/25 395, WO 97/01 535, WO 97/02 243, WO 97/36 868, WO 98/05638, WO 98/25928, WO 99/16748, WO 99/43649, WO 99/48869, WO 99/55673, WO 01/17972, WO 01/23354).<br><br>

Phenylpyrone derivatives which are substituted in the phenyl ring and have herbicidal properties are described in EP-A-588 137, WO 96/25 395, WO 96/35 664, WO 97/01 535, WO 97/02 243, WO 97/16 436, WO 97/19 941, WO 97/36 868, WO 98/05638, WO 99/43649, WO 99/48869, WO 99/55673 and WO 01/17972.<br>

It is known that certain substituted 2-arylcyclopentanediones have herbicidal properties (cf. for example, US-4 283 348; 4 338 122; 4 436 666; 4 526 723; 4 551547; 4 632 698; WO 96/01798; WO 96/03 366, WO 97/14 667 and also WO 98/39281, WO 99/43649, WO 99/48869, WO 99/55673 and WO 01/17972).<br>
10<br>
Moreover, it is known that certain substituted 2-arylcyclohexanediones have herbicidal and acaricidal properties (US-4 175 135, 4 209 432, 4 256 657, 4 256 658, 4 256 659, 4 257 858, 4 283 348, 4 303 669, 4 351666, 4 409 153, 4 436 666, 4 526 723, 4 613 617, 4 659 372, DE-A 2 813 341, and also Wheeler, T.N., J.

WO 01/17972).<br>
However, the activity of these compounds and/or their compatibility with crop plants are not under all conditions entirely satisfactory.<br>
20<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that certain substituted cyclic ketoenols, when used together with the compounds (safeners/antidotes) described below which improve crop plant compatibilty, prevent damage to the crop plants extremely well and can be used particularly advantageously as broad-spectrum  combination preparations  for the<br>
25	selective control of undesirable plants in crops of useful plants, such as, for example, in<br>
cereals, but also in maize, soya beans and rice.<br>
The invention provides selective herbicidal combinations comprising an effective amount of an active compound combination comprising 30<br>

15	very particularly preferred.<br>
Saturated or unsaturated hydrocarbon radicals such as alkyl or alkenyl can, as far as this is possible, in each case be straight-chain or branched, including in combination with heteroatoms, such as, for example, in alkoxy. <br>
20<br>
Unless indicated otherwise, optionally substituted radicals can be mono- or polysubstituted, where in the case of polysubstitution the substituents can be identical or different.<br>
25	In the following, additional preferred radical definitions in the aryl moiety of the<br>
compounds of the formula (I) are mentioned. Compounds of the formula (I) containing these radical definitions form preferred subgroups of the compounds of the formula (I).<br>

Surprisingly, it has now been found that the above-defined active compound<br>
combinations of substituted cyclic ketoenols of the general formula (I) and safeners<br>
(antidotes) of group (b) listed above, whilst being tolerated very well by crop plants,<br>
5	have particularly high herbicidal activity and can be used in various crops, in<br>
particular in cereal (especially wheat), but also in soya beans, potatoes, maize and rice, for the selective control of weeds.<br>
Here, it has to be considered to be surprising that, from a large number of known<br>
10	safeners or antidotes which are capable of antagonizing the damaging effect of a<br>
herbicide on the crop plants, it is in particular the abovementioned compounds of<br>
group (h) which neutralize the damaging effect of substituted cvclic ketoenols on the<br><br>
Le A 35 591-Foreign Countries<br>
-75-<br>
crop plants virtually completely without negatively affecting the herbicidal activity with respect to the weeds.<br>
Emphasis is given here to the particularly advantageous effect of the particularly and<br>
5	most preferred combination partners from group (b), in particular in respect of<br>
sparing cereal plants, such as, for example, wheat, barley and rye, but also maize and rice, as crop plants.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be used, for<br>
10	example, in connection with the following plants:<br>
Dicotyledonous   weeds   of the   genera:   Sinapis,   Lepidium,   Galium,   Stellaria,<br>

However, the use of the active compound combinations according to the invention is in no way restricted to these genera, but also extends in the same manner to other plants.<br>
5	According to the invention, it is possible to treat all plants and parts of plants. Here,<br>
plants are to be understood as meaning all plant and plant populations such as desirable and undesirable wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants can be plants which are obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or by biotechnological and recombinant methods or<br>
10	combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the<br>
plant cultivars which can or cannot be protected by breeders' rights. Plant parts are to be understood as meaning all above-ground and below-grounds parts and organs of the plants, such as shoots, leaves, flowers and roots, where leaves, needles, stems, trunks, flowers, fruit bodies, fruits and seeds and also roots, tubers and rhizomes may<br>
15	be mentioned by way of example. Plant parts also include harvested produce and<br>
vegetative and generative propagation material, for example seedlings, tubers, rhizomes, cuttings and seeds.<br>
The treatment according to the invention of the plants and plant parts with the active<br>
20	compounds is carried out directly or by action on their environment, habitat or<br>
               storage space by customary treatment methods, for example by dipping, spraying, evaporating, atomizing, broadcasting, spreading-on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of the seeds, furthermore by applying one or more coats. <br>
25<br>
                The advantageous effect of the crop plant compatibility of the active compound<br>
combinations according to the invention is particularly highly pronounced at certain<br>
concentration ratios. However, the weight ratios of the active compounds in the<br>
active compound combinations can be varied within relatively wide ranges. In<br>
30	  general, 0.001 to 1000 parts by weight, preferably 0.01 to 100 parts by weight,<br>
    particularly preferably 0.05 to 10 parts by weight and most preferably 0.07 to 1.5<br><br>
Le A 35 591-Foreign Countries<br>
-77-<br>
parts by weight of one of the compounds which improve crop plant compatibility mentioned under (b) above (antidotes/safeners) are present per part by weight of active compound of the formula (I) or its salts.<br>
5	The active compounds or active compound combinations can be converted into the<br>
customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, wettable powders, suspensions, powders, dusting agents, pastes, soluble powders, granules, suspoemulsion concentrates, natural and synthetic materials impregnated with active compound, and very fine capsules in polymeric substances.<br>
10<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is liquid solvents and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surfactants, that is emulsifiers and/or dispersants and/or foam-formers.<br>
15<br>
If the extender used is water, it is also possible to use, for example, organic solvents as auxiliary solvents. Suitable liquid solvents are essentially: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics and chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons,  such as  chlorobenzenes,  chloroethylenes  or methylene  chloride,<br>
20	aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example petroleum<br>
fractions, mineral and vegetable oils, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol, and also their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water.<br>
25<br>
Suitable solid carriers are:<br>
for example ammonium salts and ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates, suitable solid<br>
30	carriers for granules are: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as<br>
calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic granules of<br><br>
Le A 35 591-Foreign Countries<br>
-78-<br>
inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust,<br>
coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks; suitable emulsifiers and/or foam-<br>
formers are: for example non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene<br>
fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl<br>
5	polyglycol   ethers,   alkylsulfonates,   alkyl   sulfates,   arylsulfonates   and   protein<br>
hydrolysates; suitable dispersants are: for example lignosulfite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the<br>
10	form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and<br>
polyvinyl acetate, and also natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
15	It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide,<br>
titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
20	The formulations generally comprise from 0.1 to 95 per cent by weight of active<br>
compounds including the safeners, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention are generally used in<br>
the form of finished formulations. However, the active compounds contained in the<br>
25	active compound combinations can also be mixed in individual formulations when<br>
used, i.e. in the form of tank mixes.<br>
The novel active compound combinations, as such or in their formulations, can<br>
furthermore be used as a mixture with other known herbicides, finished formulations<br>
30	or tank mixes again being possible. A mixture with other known active compounds,<br>
such as fungicides, insecticides, acaricides, nematicides, bird repellents, growth<br><br>
Le A 35 591-Foreign Countries<br>
-79-<br>
factors, plant nutrients and agents which improve soil structure, is also possible. For<br>
certain intended uses, in particular in the post-emergence method, it may furthermore<br>
be advantageous to include, as further additives in the formulations, mineral or<br>
vegetable oils which are tolerated by plants (for example the commercial preparation<br>
5	"Rako Binol"), or ammonium salts such as, for example, ammonium sulfate or<br>
ammonium thiocyanate.<br>
The novel active compound combinations can be used as such, in the form of their<br>
formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom by further dilution, such as ready-<br>
10	to-use solutions, suspensions, emulsions, powders, pastes and granules. They are<br>
used in the customary manner, for example by washing, spraying, atomizing, dusting or scattering.<br>
The amounts of the active compound combinations according to the invention<br>
15	applied can be varied within a certain range; they depend, inter alia, on the weather<br>
and on soil factors. In general, the application rates are between 0.005 and 5 kg per ha, preferably between 0.01 and 2 kg per ha, particularly preferably between 0.05 and 1.0 kg per ha.<br>
The active compound combinations according to the invention can be applied before<br>
20	and after emergence of the plants, that is to say by the pre-emergence and post-<br>
emergence method.<br>
Use Examples<br>
25	The active compound or safener components are in each case dissolved in a few ml<br>
(generally 2-3 ml) of solvent (generally acetone or N,N-dimethyl-formamide), and the solutions are combined and then - if appropriate after addition of an emulsifier -diluted with water to the desired concentration. In general, an aqueous spray liquor was prepared using 0.1% of the additive Renex-36.<br>
30<br><br>

Example A<br>
Post-emergence test<br>
5	The test plants are grown under controlled conditions (temperature, light, atmos-<br>
pheric humidity) in a greenhouse. The test plants are sprayed when they have reached a height of 5-15 cm. The concentration of the spray liquor is chosen such that the particular amounts of active compound desired are applied in 500 1 of water/ha.<br>
10	After spraying, the pots with the test plants are kept in a greenhouse chamber under<br>
               controlled conditions (temperature, light, atmospheric humidity) until the test has ended. About three weeks after the application, the degree of damage to the crop plants is rated in % damage in comparison to the development of the untreated control.<br>
 15<br>
The figures denote:<br>
0 % = no damage (like untreated control) 100 % = total destruction/damage<br>
