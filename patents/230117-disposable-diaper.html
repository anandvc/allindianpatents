				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
DISPOSABLE DIAPER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a disposable diaper<br>
adapted for absorption and containment of bodily discharges.<br>
[0002]<br>
There has already been proposed a disposable diaper<br>
comprising a liquid-pervious topsheet, a liquid-impervious<br>
backsheet and a liquid-absorbent core interposed between these<br>
two sheets so as to defire, in a longitudinal direction, a front<br>
waist region, a rear waist region and a crotch region extending<br>
between these waist regions. The diaper is contoured by<br>
longitudinally opposite ends extending in a transverse<br>
direction outside longitudinally opposite ends of the core and<br>
transversely opposite side edges extending in the longitudinal<br>
direction outside transversely opposite ends of the core. The<br>
front waist region is provided with a pair of first wings<br>
extending outward from respective side edges of the front waist<br>
region in the transverse direction and the rear waist region<br>
is provided with a pain of second wings extending outward from<br><br>
the respective side edges of the rear waist region in the<br>
transverse direction (See Patent Document 1).<br>
[0003]<br>
In the diaper disclosed in Patent Document 1, the wings<br>
of the rear waist region is provided with a pair of tape fasteners<br>
and the front waist regior is provided on its outer surface with<br>
a target tape on which the tape fasteners are releasably<br>
anchored. Each of the second wings extending from the rear<br>
waist region comprises an inner layer sheet and an outer layer<br>
sheet both of which are elastically stretchable. These inner<br>
layer sheet and outer layer sheet may be made of an elastically<br>
stretchable fibrous nonwoven fabric, elastomer film or rubber<br>
film. The inner layer sheet and the outer layer sheet are<br>
overlapped and bonded together through the intermediary of<br>
elastic material having a rubber-like elasticity and a stretch<br>
stress higher than those of the inner layer sheet and the outer<br>
layer sheet. Each of the tape fastener has a fixed side portion<br>
which is permanently borded to the outer end of the associated<br>
second wing and a free portion extending outward from the fixed<br>
side portion in the transverse direction. A hook member of a<br>
mechanical fastener is attached to the free portion of the tape<br>
fastener and a loop member of the mechanical fastener is<br>
attached to outer surface of the target tape.<br><br>
[0004]<br>
To put this diaper cm the wearer's body, the second wings<br>
of the rear waist region are placed upon the outer side of the<br>
front waist region and then the free portions of the respective<br>
tape fasteners are anchored on the outer surface of the target<br>
tape to connect the front end rear waist regions with each other.<br>
Upon connection of the front and rear waist regions, the diaper<br>
is formed with a waist-hole and a pair of leg-holes. This diaper<br>
is characterized in that the inner layer sheet and the outer<br>
layer sheet constituting the second wings are bonded together<br>
in a non-stretched state through the intermediary of the elastic<br>
material, so there is no possibility that the inner layer sheet<br>
and the outer layer sheet might be formed with gathers which<br>
might create a feeling of discomfort against the wearer.<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent<br>
Application Publication No. 1998-328237<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION<br>
[0005]<br>
The diaper disclosed in Patent Document 1 uses an<br>
elastically stretchable fibrous nonwoven fabric, elastomer<br>
film or rubber film as stock materials for the inner layer sheet<br>
and the outer layer sheet constituting the second wings of the<br><br>
rear waist region. Disadvantageously, the wearer may<br>
experience uncomfortable tackiness and sliminess peculiar to<br>
elastomeric materials as these sheets formed from the elastomer,<br>
or rubber film and the elastically stretchable fibrous nonwoven<br>
fabric containing an elastomeric materials as these sheets<br>
formed from the elastomer or rubber film and the elastically<br>
stretchable fibrous nonwoven fabric containing an elastomeric<br>
material come in contact with the wearer's skin. In addition,<br>
these sheets may stick to the wearer's skin since these sheets<br>
exhibit a relatively high fricticnal force and such factor also<br>
may deteriorate a feeling to wear the diaper. When the<br>
elastomer film or the rubber film is used as stock material for<br>
the inner layer sheet and the outer layer sheet, a water vapor<br>
permeability of the second wings extending from the rear waist<br>
region will be significantly deteriorated and it will be<br>
impossible to let water vapor generated due to evaporation of<br>
sweat out from the diaper through the second wings.<br>
Consequently, a stuffiness generated within the diaper can not<br>
be eliminated.<br>
[0006]<br>
In view of the problems as have been described above, it<br>
is an object of the present invention to provide a disposable<br>
diaper improved so as to give the wearer no uncomfortable<br><br>
feeling to wear this diaper, on one hand, and to allow water<br>
vapor generated as a result of sweat evaporation to be let out<br>
from the diaper through the wings, on the other hand.<br>
MEASURE TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM<br>
[0007]<br>
The object set forth above is achieved, according to the<br>
present invention, by a disposable diaper comprising a front<br>
waist region, a rear waist region, a crotch region extending<br>
between these two waist regions, a pair of first wings extending<br>
outward from transversely opposite side edge portions of the<br>
front waist region in a transverse direction and a pair of second<br>
wings extending outward from transversely opposite side edge<br>
portions of the rear waist region in the transverse direction.<br>
[0008]<br>
The diaper according to the present invention further<br>
comprises, of the first and second wings, at least the second<br>
wings being formed from an elastically stretchable composite<br>
sheet which comprises, ir turn, a breathable stretchy plastic<br>
film formed with a plurality of air passages extending through<br>
the plastic film each having a first opening facing the wearer's<br>
skin and a second opening facing away from the wearer's skin<br>
and a pair of breathable, heat-sealable fibrous nonwoven fabric<br>
layers partially bonded to both surfaces of the plastic film<br><br>
at of heat-sealed spots and formed with a plurality of gathers<br>
rising and falling along surfaces of the fibrous nonwoven fabric<br>
layers. The wings are free from uncomfortable tackiness and<br>
sliminess peculiar to rubber-based materials although the wings<br>
are elastically stretchabLe as a whole, since one of the fibrous<br>
nonwoven fabric layers comes in contact with the wearer's skin.<br>
Furthermore, water vapor Generated due to sweat evaporation can<br>
be let out from the diaper through the air passages.<br>
[0009]<br>
The diaper according to the present invention includes<br>
the following preferred embodiments.<br>
The plastic film is formed from an elastically<br>
stretchable thermoplast LC elastomer film and a pair of<br>
polyolefin-based thermoplastic synthetic resin film layers<br>
bonded to both surfaces of the elastomer film, and the fibrous<br>
nonwoven fabric is formed from polyolefin-based thermoplastic<br>
synthetic resin fibers.<br>
[0010]<br>
The second opening has an area smaller than that of the<br>
first opening so that the air passage is tapered from the first<br>
opening toward the second opening. A surface tension is higher<br>
in the vicinity of the second opening than in the vicinity of<br>
the first opening.<br><br>
[0011]<br>
The number of the ait: passages formed through the plastic<br>
film is in a range of 10 - 8O/cm2 of the plastic film and a total<br>
area of the first openincs the plastic film is in a range of<br>
10 - 20% of an area of the plastic film.<br>
[0012]<br>
Inside the air passage, the fibrous nonwoven fabric<br>
layers are bonded together at the heat-sealed spots and the<br>
number of the air passages inside which the fibrous nonwoven<br>
fabric layers are bonded to each other is in a range of 1.5 -<br>
10% of the total number of the air passages. This diaper allows<br>
water vapor generated due to evaporation of the sweat having<br>
transferred to the heat-sealed spots to be let out from the<br>
diaper.<br>
[0013]<br>
The fibrous nonwoven fabric layers maintain a fibrous<br>
state at the heat-sealed spots and have a fibrous density higher<br>
at the heat-sealed spots than in the remaining region except<br>
the heat-sealed spots. A capillary phenomenon occurs more<br>
significantly at the heat-sealed spots than in the remaining<br>
region and an amount of sweat having permeated a remaining<br>
region of the nonwoven fabric layer rapidly transfers toward<br>
the heat-sealed spots.<br><br>
[0014]<br>
Each of the wings formed from the elastically stretchable<br>
composite sheet presents a transverse stretch stress in a range<br>
of 1.5 - 7.0 N as the wing is stretched in the transverse<br>
direction to a length dimension in the transverse direction<br>
corresponding to 120% on the basis of its non-stretched<br>
transverse length dimension set as 100% and presents a<br>
transverse stretch stress in a range of 3. 0 - 10.0 N as the wing<br>
is stretched to a length dimension in the transverse direction<br>
corresponding to 150% of the non-stretched length dimension.<br>
[0015]<br>
The plastic film has a thickness of 0.3 - 1 mm, and the<br>
fibrous nonwoven fabric layers each has a basic weight of 20<br>
-	 60 g/m2, a thickness of 0.1 - 0.5 mm and a density of 0.04<br>
-	 0.6 g/cm3.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0016]<br>
The disposable diaper according to the present invention<br>
is primarily characterized in that at least the second wings<br>
of the first and second wings are formed from the elastically<br>
stretchable composite sneet comprising the breathable and<br>
stretchy plastic film and the breathable heat-sealable fibrous<br>
nonwoven fabric layers partially bonded to both surfaces of the<br><br>
plastic film wherein one cf the fibrous nonwoven fabric layers<br>
comes in contact with the wearer's skin as the diaper is put<br>
on. Such features are effective to eliminate the apprehension<br>
that the wings might stick to the wearer's skin and the wearer<br>
might experience uncomfortable feeling to wear the diaper<br>
although the wings are elastically stretchable as a whole. On<br>
the other important aspect of the present invention, the<br>
stretchy plastic film is formed with a plurality of the air<br>
passages allowing water vapor generated due to sweat<br>
evaporation to be let out from the diaper through these air<br>
passages and thereby allowing stuffiness possibly occurring<br>
within the diaper to be prevented. Furthermore, the elasticity<br>
of the wings may be utilized to tighten the diaper around the<br>
wearer's waist and thereby may prevent the diaper once put on<br>
the wearer's body from slipping down from its proper position.<br>
[0017]<br>
In the diaper wherein the fibrous nonwoven fabric made<br>
of polyolefin-based thermoplastic synthetic resin fiber is used<br>
as the constituent layers of the composite sheet, the wings are<br>
free from uncomfortable tackiness and sliminess peculiar to the<br>
rubber-based material and there is no anxiety that the wearer<br>
might experience uncomfortable feeling as the wings come in<br>
contact with skin.<br><br>
[0018]<br>
In the diaper where in each of the air passages formed<br>
through the stretchy plastic film constituting the composite<br>
sheet is tapered from the first opening toward the second<br>
opening, a surface tension acting on the air passage is higher<br>
in the vicinity of the second opening than in the vicinity of<br>
the first opening. Consequently, sweat having flowed into the<br>
first opening can be easily transferred toward the second<br>
opening, i.e., toward the skin non-contacting side of the wing<br>
under the surface tension. In this way, wetness on this side<br>
of the wing can be rapidly eliminated.<br>
[0019]<br>
In the diaper wherein the fibrous nonwoven fabric layers<br>
constituting the composite sheet are bonded to each other inside<br>
the air passage at the heat-sealed spots, water vapor generated<br>
due to evaporation of sweat having moved to the heat-sealed<br>
spots can be let out from the diaper through these air passages<br>
and the amount of sweat having permeated the nonwoven fabric<br>
layer can be rapidly dried.<br>
[0020]<br>
In the diaper wherein the nonwoven fabric layers have<br>
fiber densities higher in the heat-sealed spots than in the<br>
respective remaining regions, a capillary phenomenon occurs<br><br>
more significantly in the heat-sealed spots than in the<br>
remaining regions. Such significant capillary phenomenon<br>
allows any amount of sweat having permeated the remaining region<br>
of the nonwoven fabric layer to be rapidly transferred to the<br>
heat-sealed spots and thereby allows the remaining region to<br>
be rapidly dried. In this way, uncomfortable tackiness and/or<br>
sliminess due to sweat which would otherwise stay on the<br>
remaining region of the nonwoven fabric layer destined to<br>
contact with the wearer's skin can be effectively eliminated.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE BEST MODE FOR WORKING OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
[0023]<br>
Details of a disposable diaper according to the present<br>
invention will be more fully understood from the description<br>
of open-type and pull-on diapers as typical embodiments given<br>
hereunder with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
EMBODIMENT 1<br>
[0024]<br>
Fig. 1 is a partially cutaway perspective view showing<br>
an open-type diaper 1A of the invention, Fig. 2 is a sectional<br>
view taken along the line II-II in Fig. 1, Fig. 3 is a sectional<br>
view taken along the line III-III in Fig. 1 and Fig. 4 is a<br>
sectional view taken along the line IV-IV in Fig. 1. In Fig.<br>
1, a transverse direction is indicated by an arrow L and a<br>
longitudinal direction is indicated by an arrow M. As used<br>
herein the term "inner sjrfaces" of top- and backsheets 2, 3<br>
and leak-barrier sheets refers to surfaces thereof facing a<br>
core 4 and as used herein the term "outer surfaces" of these<br>
sheets 2, 3, 7 refers to surfaces thereof facing away from the<br>
core 4. As used herein the term "skin contacting side" refers<br>
to the side facing the weatrer's skin and expression used herein<br>
"skin non-contacting side" refers to the side facing away from<br>
the wearer's skin.<br>
[0025]<br><br>
The diaper 1A basically comprises the liquid-pervious<br>
topsheet 2 lying on the skin contactable side, the<br>
liquid-impervious backsheet 3 lying on the skin non-contactable<br>
side and the liquid-absorbent core 4 interposed between the top-<br>
and backsheets 2, 3. In addition to these constituting members,<br>
the diaper 1A includes tape-like waist-surrounding elastic<br>
members 5, a plurality of strand-like leg-surrounding elastic<br>
members 6 and a pair of the leak-barrier sheets 7.<br>
[0026]<br>
The diaper 1A is corrposed, in the longitudinal direction,<br>
a front waist region 8, a rear waist region 10 and a crotch region<br>
9 extending between thes'2 waist regions 8, 10, and the diaper<br>
1A is contoured by longitudinally opposite end portions 11<br>
extending in the transverse direction outside longitudinally<br>
opposite ends 4a of the core 4 a.nd transversely opposite side<br>
edge portions 12 extending in the longitudinal direction<br>
outside transversely opposite ends 4b of the core 4. The front<br>
waist region 8 is provided with a pair of first wings 13 extending<br>
outward from respective side edge portions 12 of the front waist<br>
region 8 in the transverse direction. The rear waist region<br>
10 is also provided with a pair of second wings 14 extending<br>
outward from the respect ive side edge portions 12 of the rear<br>
waist region 10 in the transverse direction. Thus, the diaper<br><br>
1A has a generally hourglass-like planar shape.<br>
[0027]<br>
The topsheet 2 is formed from a breathable hydrophilic<br>
fibrous nonwoven fabric 15. The backsheet 3 is formed from a<br>
breathable liquid-impervious plastic film 16 lying on the lower<br>
surface of the core 4 and a breathable hydrophobic fibrous<br>
nonwoven fabric 17 placed on the lower surface of the film 16.<br>
Respective surfaces of the film 16 and the nonwoven fabric 17<br>
opposed to each other are intermittently bonded by means of<br>
adhesive (not shown) . The core 4 extends between the front and<br>
rear waist regions 8, 10 and is permanently bonded to at least<br>
one of inner surfaces of the topsheet 2 and the film 16 of the<br>
backsheet 3.<br>
[0028]<br>
The core 4 comprises a mixture of particulate or fibrous<br>
super-absorbent polymer and. fluff pulp or a mixture of<br>
particulate or fibrous super-absorbent polymer, fluff pulp and<br>
thermoplastic synthetic resin fiber, in any case, compressed<br>
to a desired thickness. Preferably, the core 4 is entirely<br>
wrapped with a liquid-pervious sheet such as a tissue paper or<br>
hydrophilic fibrous nonwoven fabric in order to avoid a<br>
possibility that the core 4 might get out of its initial shape<br>
and/or the particulate polymer might fall off from the core 4.<br><br>
The polymer may be seLected from the group consisting of<br>
starch-based polymer, cellulose-based polymer and synthetic<br>
polymer.<br>
[0029]<br>
The longitudinally opposite end portions 11 are formed<br>
from longitudinally opposite end portions 2a of the topsheet<br>
2	and longitudinally opposite end portions 3a of the backsheet<br>
3	extending outward beyond longitudinally opposite ends 4a of<br>
the core 4. The top- and backsheets 2, 3 are overlapped together<br>
along the end portions 2a, 3a thereof and inner surfaces of these<br>
sheets 2, 3 are permanently bonded together to form the<br>
respective end portions 11. The waist surrounding elastic<br>
members 5 are contraccibly attached to the respective end<br>
portions 11 so as to extend in the transverse direction. More<br>
specifically, the waist surrounding elastic members 5 are<br>
interposed between the respective end portions 2a of the<br>
topsheet 2 and the respective end portions 3a of the backsheet<br>
3 and are permanently bonded to the inner surfaces of these<br>
sheets 2, 3 while these elastic members 5 are stretched at a<br>
given ratio.<br>
[0030]<br>
The transversely opposite side edge portions 12 are<br>
formed from transversely opposite side edge portions 2b of the<br><br>
topsheet 2 and transversely opposite side edge portions 3b of<br>
the backsheet 3 extending outward in the transverse direction<br>
beyond transversely opposite side edges 4b of the core 4. The<br>
side edge portions 2b of the topsheet 2 extend outward in the<br>
transverse direction slightly beyond the transversely opposite<br>
side edges 4b of the core 4 and the side edge portions 3b of<br>
the backsheet 3 as well as the side edge portions 7a of the<br>
leak-barrier sheets 1 extend outward in the transverse<br>
direction beyond the side edge portions 2b of the topsheet 2.<br>
Along the side edge portions 12, the respective side edge<br>
portions 2b, 3b, 7a are overlapped together and have inner and<br>
outer surfaces thereof bonded together. The leg surrounding<br>
elastic members 6 are contractibly attached to the respective<br>
side edge portions 12 of the crotch region 9 so as to extend<br>
in the longitudinal direction. More specifically, the leg<br>
surrounding elastic members 6 are interposed between the<br>
respective side edge portions 3b of the backsheet 3 and the<br>
respective side edge portions 7a of the leak-barrier sheets 7<br>
and are permanently bonded to the inner surfaces of these sheets<br>
3, 7 while these elastic members 6 are stretched at a given ratio.<br>
[0031]<br>
The first wings 13 are defined by the side edge portions<br>
3b of the backsheet 3 and the fixed side portions 7a of the<br><br>
respective leak-barrier sheets 7 extending outward from the<br>
side edge portions 12 of the front waist region 8 in the<br>
transverse direction. These sheets 3, 7 are overlapped<br>
together and have respective inner surfaces bonded together<br>
along these side edge portions 3b, 7a of the sheets 3, 7.<br>
[0032]<br>
The second wings 14 are formed from an elastically<br>
stretchable composite sheet 18, respectively, which are<br>
elastically stretchable in the transverse direction. Each of<br>
the second wings 14 has its transversely inner end portion 14a<br>
interposed between the side edge portion 3b of the backsheet<br>
3 and the fixed side edge portion 7a of the leak-barrier sheet<br>
7 and permanently bonded to respective inner surfaces of these<br>
sheets 3, 7 by means of adhesive (not shown). The transversely<br>
outer end portions 14b of the respective second wings 14 are<br>
provided with tape fasteners 19 extending in the transverse<br>
direction.<br>
[0033]<br>
The leak-barrier sheets 7 are formed from a breathable<br>
hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric 20 and extend in the<br>
longitudinal direction between the front and rear waist regions<br>
8, 10. Each of the leak-barrier sheets 7 has the fixed side<br>
portion 7a lying outside the associated side edge 4b of the core<br><br>
4 and extending in the lor gitudinal direction, a movable portion<br>
7b normally biased to rise up above the topsheet 2 and extending<br>
in the longitudinal direction and longitudinally opposite f ix.ed<br>
end portions 7c lying on the longitudinally opposite end<br>
portions 11, respectively, and collapsed inward in the<br>
transverse direction of the diaper 1A. An elastic member 21<br>
extending in the longitudinal direction is contractibly<br>
attached to the movable portion 7b in the vicinity of its distal<br>
end wherein the elastic member 21 is wrapped with a part of the<br>
movable portion 7b and permanently bonded to the movable portion<br>
7b by means of adhesive (not shown). The fixed end portions<br>
7c are permanently bonded to the outer surface of the respective<br>
end portions 2a of the topsheet 2. In the leak-barrier sheets<br>
7, the elastic members 21 contract as the diaper 1A is curved<br>
in the longitudinal direction with the topsheet 2 inside and<br>
a contractile force of these elastic members 21 causes the<br>
movable portions 7b to rise above the topsheet 2 so as to form<br>
barriers against bodily discharges.<br>
[0034]<br>
Each of the tape fasteners 19 has a fixed side portion<br>
19a permanently bonded to the outer end portion 14b of the<br>
associated second wing 14 by means of adhesive (not shown) and<br>
a free portion 19b extending outward from the fixed side portion<br><br>
19a in the transverse direction. Stock materials for the tape<br>
fastener 19 may be selected from the group consisting of a<br>
fibrous nonwoven fabric made of polyolefin-based thermoplastic<br>
synthetic resin fiber and a film made of polyolef in-based<br>
thermoplastic resin. The free portion 19b is provided with a<br>
plurality of hooks 22 expending in a thickness direction of the<br>
diaper 1A. These hooks 22 are made of polyolefin-based<br>
thermoplastic synthetic resin. Alternatively, the free<br>
portion 19b may be coated with pressure-sensitive adhesive,<br>
instead of the hooks 22.<br>
[0035]<br>
The front waist region 8 is provided with a target tape<br>
23 on which the free end portions 19b of the respective tape<br>
fasteners 19 are releasably anchored. The target tape 23 has<br>
a rectangular shape having its longer sides extending in the<br>
transverse direction and is intermittently or continuously<br>
bonded to the outer surface of the nonwoven fabric 17 of the<br>
backsheet 3 by means of adhesive (not shown). Stock materials<br>
for this target tape 23 may be selected from the group consisting<br>
of a fibrous nonwoven fabric made of polyolefin-based<br>
thermoplastic synthetic resin fiber and a film made of<br>
polyolefin-based thermoplastic synthetic resin. The target<br>
tape 23 is provided on its outer surface with a plurality of<br><br>
loops 24 each describing a circular arc in the thickness<br>
direction of the diaper 1A. These loops 24 are made of<br>
polyolefin-based thermoplastic synthetic resin. When it is<br>
desired to coat the free portions 19b of the respective tape<br>
fasteners 19 with pressure-sensitive adhesive, the synthetic<br>
resin film may be used as the target tape 23.<br>
[0036]<br>
Fig. 5 is a partially cutaway perspective view showing<br>
a composite sheet 18 forming the second wings 14 and Fig. 6 is<br>
a section view taken along the line VI-VI. In Figs. 5, 6, a<br>
transverse direction is indicated by an arrow L, a longitudinal<br>
direction is indicated by an arrow M and a thickness direction<br>
is indicated by an arrow N. The composite sheet 18 comprises<br>
a breathable and stretohable plastic film 25 and a pair of<br>
breathable and heat-seal able fibrous nonwoven fabric layers 26A,<br>
26B. The plastic film preferably has a thickness of 0.3 - 1<br>
mm, the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B preferably has a basic<br>
weight of 20 - 60 g/m2, a thickness of 0.1 - 0.5 mm and a density<br>
in a range of 0.04 - 0.6 g/cm3, respectively. The nonwoven<br>
fabric layers 26A lies on the skin contactable side and the<br>
nonwoven fabric layers 2 6B lies on the skin non-contactable side.<br>
The plastic film 25 and the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B have<br>
respective surfaces ove rlapped and partially bonded together<br><br>
by means of a plurality of heat-sealed spots 27 which are<br>
distributed as evenly as possible. These nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 26A, 26B are formed with a plurality of gathers 28 which<br>
rise and fall along surfaces of the nonwoven fabric layers 26A,<br>
26B. The nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B may be hydrophilic<br>
or hydrophobic.<br>
[0037]<br>
The plastic film 25 is formed from an elastically<br>
stretchable thermoplastic elastomer film 29 and thermoplastic<br>
synthetic resin film layers 30 placed upon both surfaces of the<br>
elastomer film 29. The elastomer film 29 and the synthetic<br>
resin film layers 30 are overlapped and bonded together along<br>
respective surfaces thereof opposed one to another. Each of<br>
the thermoplastic synthetic resin film layers 30 comprises a<br>
pair of two sub-layers overlapped and bonded together. The<br>
plastic film 25 is formed with a plurality of air passages 31<br>
extending from its upper surface toward its skin<br>
non-contactable side (i.e., toward the nonwoven fabric layer<br>
26B) in the thickness direction of the diaper 1A. Each of these<br>
air passages 31 is defined by a first opening 32 facing the<br>
wearer's skin, a second opening 33 facing away from the wearer's<br>
skin and having a diameter smaller than that of the first opening<br>
32 and a tubular wall 34 extending between the first and second<br><br>
openings 32, 33 so as to be tapered from the first opening 32<br>
toward the second opening 33.<br>
[0038]<br>
Inside some of the air passage 31, the nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 26A, 26B have respective surfaces facing each other<br>
bonded together by means of heat-sealed spots 35. Inside the<br>
remaining air passages 31, however, these nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 26A, 26B are not heat-sealed together. At the<br>
heat-sealed spots 27, 35, these nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B<br>
are not in a filmy state but maintain a fibrous state. In other<br>
words, a fiber density of the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B<br>
is higher than a fiber density thereof in the remaining region<br>
except the heat-sealed spots 27, 35.<br>
[0039]<br>
The elastomer film 29 is made of material selected from<br>
the group consisting of styrene-based block copolymer,<br>
polyurethane-based block copolymer, polyester-based block<br>
copolymer, polyamide-based block copolymer and copolymer blend.<br>
The styrene-based block copolymer may be selected from a group<br>
consisting of styrene-butadiene-styrene (S-B-S) and<br>
styrene-ethylene butadiene-styrene (S-EB-S). The copolymer<br>
blend may be selected from a group consisting of<br>
styrene-ethylene butadiene-styrene/polypropylene (S-EB-S/PP)<br><br>
and polypropylene/ethylene-propylene (PP/-P).<br>
[0040]<br>
The synthetic resin film 30 is formed from<br>
polyolefin-based thermoplastic synthetic resin. The fibrous<br>
nonwoven fabric is formed from polyolefin-based thermoplastic<br>
synthetic resin fiber. The polyolefin may be selected from the<br>
group consisting of polyamide, polyester, polyvinyl chloride,<br>
polyethylene, polypropylene and polystyrene.<br>
[0041]<br>
The plastic film 2b may be obtained, for example, by using<br>
a process including the steps as follow. The elastomer film<br>
29 and the synthetic resin film 30 are respectively extruded<br>
from the associated extruders and placed upon each other before<br>
cured so that respective; surfaces of these film layers 29, 30<br>
opposed to each other may be heat-sealed so as to form the plastic<br>
film 25. In this step, the plastic film 25 is not formed with<br>
the air passages 31.<br>
[0042]<br>
In the softened state, the plastic film 25 runs to a rotary<br>
suction drum and one surface of the plastic film 25 is held in<br>
contact with a peripheral surface of the drum as the plastic<br>
film 25 travels on the peripheral surface. The suction drum<br>
is provided on its peripheral surface with a plurality of<br><br>
openings distributed as evenly as possible and tubular walls<br>
extending from peripheral edges of the respective openings<br>
toward an axis of the drum. The suction drum is provided on<br>
its peripheral surface vvith a suction station at which the air<br>
is sucked by suction means toward the axis of the drum through<br>
the respective openings. Regions of the plastic film 25 just<br>
facing the respective openings of the drum are sucked and<br>
stretched from the openings toward the axis of the drum as the<br>
plastic film 25 traveling on the peripheral surface of the drum<br>
reaches the suction station. In consequence, lower ends of the<br>
respective regions of the plastic film 25 sucked and stretched<br>
in this manner and exposed to "he internal space of the drum<br>
are disrupted to form a plurality of air passages 31 extending<br>
toward the axis of the dram. Then the plastic film 25 is cooled<br>
and cured and taken up on a roll.<br>
[0043]<br>
The stretchable composite sheet 18 may be obtained, for<br>
example, by using a process including the steps as follows. The<br>
nonwoven fabric layers 2 5A, 26B substantially in non-stretched<br>
state are placed upon both surfaces of the plastic film 25 being<br>
stretched in the transverse direction. Then these film 25 and<br>
the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B are partially heated to bond<br>
them together and, at the same time, to bond the nonwoven fabric<br><br>
layers 26A, 26B to each other inside the air passages 31. Upon<br>
relaxation of the plastic film 25, the film 25 contracts in the<br>
transverse direction and the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B<br>
also contract in the transverse direction to form a plurality<br>
of gathers 28. Bonding of the film 25 to the nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 26A, 26B may te achieved using thermal embossing<br>
technique or ultrasonic sealing technique. It should be noted<br>
here that the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B are bonded to each<br>
other inside some of the air passages 31 but not bonded to each<br>
other inside the remaining air passages 31.<br>
[0044]<br>
An example of the thermal embossing technique uses a<br>
thermal embossing roll provided, on its peripheral surface with<br>
a plurality of projections and a flat roll opposed to the<br>
embossing roll so that the film 25 and the nonwoven fabric layers<br>
26A, 26B placed one upon another may be guided into a nip of<br>
these rolls. In the course of passing through the nip, the film<br>
25 is stretched in a machine direction at a given ratio. The<br>
nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B are under a tension in the<br>
machine direction but not stretched. Passing through the nip<br>
of these paired rolls, the film 25 and the nonwoven fabric layers<br>
26A, 26B are wedged betveen the embossing projections and the<br>
peripheral surface of the flat roll and heated by the embossing<br><br>
projections. In this way, these film 25 and nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 26A, 26B are partially heat sealed together.<br>
[0045]<br>
The ultrasonic sealing technique generally uses a horn<br>
and an anvil opposed to each other so that the film 25 and the<br>
nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B placed one upon another may be<br>
guided through a gap between these horn and anvil. In the course<br>
of passing through the gap, the film 25 is stretched in the<br>
machine direction at a given ratio. The nonwoven fabric layers<br>
26A, 26B are under a tension in the machine direction but not<br>
elastically stretched. Frictional heat generated between the<br>
horn and the anvil both oscillating under the effect of<br>
ultrasonic waves causes the film 25 and the nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 26A, 26B to be partially heat-sealed together.<br>
[0046]<br>
The film 25 and the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B are<br>
preferably formed from the same type of polyolefin-based<br>
material. For example, when polyethylene-based synthetic resin<br>
is used to form the film 25, it is preferred to use<br>
polyethylene-based synthetic resin fiber as the component fiber<br>
of the nonwoven fabric Layers 26A, 26B. The film 25 and the<br>
nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 2 6B formed from the same type of<br>
polyolefin-based material present respective melting points<br><br>
which are substantially similar one to another and can be easily<br>
bonded one to another. When the film 25 and the nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 26A, 26B are formed from different types of<br>
polyolef in-based material, respectively, it is preferred to use<br>
the material having a melting point substantially the same as<br>
or lower than that of the film 25 for the component fiber of<br>
the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B. This is because, if the<br>
film 25 has a melting point higher than the melting point of<br>
the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B, the nonwoven fabric layers<br>
26A, 26B will inevitably become filmy in the course of<br>
heat-sealing them together with the film 25 and it will be<br>
difficult for the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B to maintain<br>
their fibrous state at the heat-sealed spots 27, 35.<br>
[0047]<br>
Fig. 7 is a perspective view showing the diaper 1A as put<br>
on the wearer's body. An example of the sequence in accordance<br>
with which a parent or a care personnel puts the diaper 1A on<br>
the wearer's body will be described. After the hip of the wearer<br>
lying face up has been laid on the developed diaper 1A, the front<br>
waist region 8 is held with the hand and folded back along the<br>
crotch region 9 onto the wearer's belly. Then, with the tape<br>
fasteners 19 gripped by the fingers, the second wings 14 are<br>
folded back so that these wings 14 may be positioned above the<br><br>
wearer's belly. The second wings 14 are placed on respective<br>
outer sides of the end psrtion 11 and the first wings 13 of the<br>
front waist region 8. Adjusting a tightness of the end portions<br>
11 as well as of the wings 14 around the wearer's waist, the<br>
free portions 19b of the respective tape fasteners 19 are<br>
anchored on the outer surface of the target tape by means of<br>
the hooks 22 and thereby the front and rear waist regions 8,<br>
10 are connected to each other.<br>
[0048]<br>
To anchor the tape fasteners 19 on the target tape 23,<br>
the free portions 19b of the respective tape fasteners 19 may<br>
be pressed against the cuter surface of the target tape 23 and<br>
thereby the hooks 22 may be engaged with the loops 24. Upon<br>
connection of the front and rear waist regions 8, 10 to each<br>
other, the diaper 1A is formed with a waist-hole 36 and a pair<br>
of leg-holes 37. Excretion discharged on the diaper 1A put on<br>
the wearer's body is absorbed by the core 4 through the topsheet<br>
2 and retained therein.<br>
[0049]<br>
Of the composite sheet 18 forming each of the second wings<br>
14, the fibrous nonwoven fabric layer 26A contacts the wearer's<br>
skin during use of the daaper 1A, so it is not apprehended that<br>
the wings 14 might uncomfortably stick to the wearer's skin in<br><br>
spite of stretchable elasticity of the wings 14. Comfortable<br>
feeling to wear the diaper 1A is further enhanced by forming<br>
the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B using polyolefin-based<br>
synthetic resin fiber which is free from tackiness as well as<br>
sliminess peculiar to ruober-based material. Tightness of the<br>
diaper 1A around the wearer's waist can be appropriately<br>
adjusted by utilizing the elasticity of the second wings 14 so<br>
as to prevent the diaper 1A from slipping down from its proper<br>
position.<br>
[0050]<br>
The stretchable plastic film 25 constituting the<br>
composite sheet 18 is formed with a plurality of air passages<br>
31	so that water vapor generated within the diaper 1A due to<br>
sweat evaporation can be Let out from the diaper 1A through these<br>
air passages 31 and thereby stuffiness possibly occurring<br>
within the diaper 1A can be prevented. More specifically, each<br>
of these air passages 31 extending through the plastic film 25<br>
in its thickness direction is tapered from the first opening<br>
32	toward the second opening 33 and a surface tension acting<br>
on the air passage 31 is higher in the vicinity of the second<br>
opening 33 than in the vicinity of the first opening 32.<br>
Consequently, sweat having flowed into the first opening 32 can<br>
be easily transferred toward the second opening 33, i.e., toward<br><br>
the skin non-contactable side of the second wing 14 under the<br>
surface tension. In this way, wetness on this side of the wing<br>
14 can be rapidly eliminated.<br>
[0051]<br>
A total thickness of the film 25 and the nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 26A, 26B in the heat-sealed spots 27 is smaller than that<br>
of the film 25 and the nonwoven fabric layer 26A except the<br>
heat-sealed spots 27, so the nonwoven fabric layer 25A except<br>
the head-sealed spots 27 comes in contact with the wearer's skin<br>
as the diaper 1A is put on. The nonwoven fabric layers 26A,<br>
26B have fiber densities higher in the heat-sealed spots 27,<br>
35 than in the respective remaining regions and therefore a<br>
capillary phenomenon occurs more significantly in the<br>
heat-sealed spots 27, 35 than in the remaining regions. Such<br>
significant capillary phenomenon allows any amount of sweat<br>
having permeated the regaining region of the nonwoven fabric<br>
layer 26A to be rapidly transferred to the heat-sealed spots<br>
27, 35 and thereby allots the remaining region to be rapidly<br>
dried. In this way, uncomfortaible tackiness and/or sliminess<br>
due to sweat which would otherwise stay on the remaining region<br>
of the nonwoven fabric layer 26A contacting with the wearer's<br>
skin can be effectively eliminated. Inside some of the air<br>
passages 31, the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B are bonded<br><br>
together at the heat-sealed spots 35, so water vapor generated<br>
as the amount of sweat having moved to the heat-sealed spots<br>
35 is evaporated can be let out from the diaper 1A through these<br>
air passages 31 and the amount of sweat having permeated the<br>
nonwoven fabric layer 26A can be rapidly dried.<br>
[0052]<br>
The number of the air passages 31 formed through the<br>
plastic film 25 is in a range of 10 - 80/cm2 of the plastic film<br>
25 and a total area ratio of the first openings 32 of these air<br>
passages 31 is in a range of 10 - 20% of the plastic film 25.<br>
If the number of the air passages 31 is less than 10 and the<br>
total area ratio of the first openings 32 of these air passages<br>
31 is less than 10% of an area of the plastic film 25, the number<br>
of the air passages 31 per square centimetre of the plastic film<br>
25 as well as the opening area, of the first openings 32 will<br>
be insufficient to let the water vapor out from the diaper 1A<br>
and to transfer the sweat toward the skin non-contacting side<br>
of the second wings 14. As a result, it would be impossible<br>
to prevent a stuffiness from being generated within the diaper<br>
1A. If the number of the air passages 31 exceeds 80/cm2 and<br>
the total area ratio of the first openings 32 of these air<br>
passages 31 exceeds 20% of the area of the plastic film 25, on<br>
the contrary, the film 25 will be formed with a number of the<br><br>
first openings 32 excess ively close one to another and the film<br>
25 will be broken between each pair of the adjacent first<br>
openings 31. Thereupon the second wings 14 will lose the<br>
desired elasticity and no more contract again. The nonwoven<br>
fabric layers 26A, 26B are bonded to each other inside the air<br>
passages 31 formed through the film 25 by a range of 1.5 - 10%<br>
with respect to the total number of the air passages 31. If<br>
this percentage is less than 1.5%, it will be impossible to let<br>
the water vapor generated due to evaporation of the sweat having<br>
been transferred to the heat-sealed spots 35 out from the diaper<br>
1A and therefore to dry the sweat having permeated the nonwoven<br>
fabric layer 26A.<br>
[0053]<br>
Each of the second wings 14 formed from the elastic<br>
composite sheet 18 presents a transverse stretch stress of 1.5<br>
- 7.0 N as the wing 14 is stretched in the transverse direction<br>
to a length dimension in the transverse direction corresponding<br>
to 120% of its non-stretched length dimension set as 100% and<br>
presents a transverse stretch stress of 3. 0 - 10. 0 N as the wing<br>
14 is stretched to a length dimension in the transverse<br>
direction corresponding to 150% of its non-stretched length<br>
dimension. If the stretch stress of the second wing 14 exceeds<br>
the above-mentioned higher limits, the wings 14 will needlessly<br><br>
clinch the wearer's waist as the diaper 1A is put on and the<br>
wearer will experience a feeling of oppression partially around<br>
his or her waist. If the stretch stress of the second wing 14<br>
is less than the above-mentioned lower limits, on the contrary,<br>
a contractile force of the wing 14 will be substantially<br>
ineffective and it will be impossible for the wings 14 to clinch<br>
the wearer's waist appropriately. The stretch stress was<br>
measured using a method as follows:<br>
(1)	 The transversely opposite side edge portions 12 of<br>
the rear waist region 10 are cut away from the diaper 1A to<br>
prepare samples for measurement of stretch stress. Each sample<br>
comprises a part of the side edge 12 and the complete second<br>
wing 14 (including the tape fastener 19). INSTRON 5543 or<br>
AUTOGRAPH manufactured by INSTRON JAPAN CO. is used to measure<br>
the stretch stress.<br>
(2)	 A fixture is attached to the side edge portion 12 of<br>
the sample except the second wing 14 so that the fixture may<br>
extend along full length of the side edge portion 12. Of the<br>
sample, the tape fastener 19 is held by an upper chuck and the<br>
fixture is held by a lower chuck. A length dimension of the<br>
sample measured between the upper and lower chucks is 70 mm.<br>
(3) A length dimension of the non-stretched sample<br>
extending between the upper and lower chucks without slacks is<br><br>
set as 100%. The sample is stretched in the vertical direction<br>
at a rate of 100 min/min so that the upper and lower chucks may<br>
get away from each other. The sample is stretched to a length<br>
dimension corresponding to 120% of its non-stretched length and<br>
a stretch stress of the sample at this moment is measured and<br>
then the sample is stretched to a length dimension corresponding<br>
to 150% of its non-stretched length and a stretch stress of the<br>
sample at this moment is measured.<br>

of strand-like waist surrounding elastic members 5 and leg<br>
surrounding elastic members 6 and a pair of leak-barrier sheets<br>
7. As will be understood from Fig. 10, the diaper 1B has a<br>
generally hourglass-like developed planar shape.<br>
[0056]<br>
The diaper 1B is composed of front and rear waist regions<br>
8, 10 opposed to each other and a crotch region 9 extending<br>
between these waist regions 8, 10 wherein the diaper 1B is<br>
contoured by longitudinally opposite end portions 11 extending<br>
in the transverse direction outside longitudinally opposite<br>
ends 4a of the core 4 and transversely opposite side edge<br>
portions 12 extending in the longitudinal direction outside<br>
transversely opposite side edges 4b of the core 4. The front<br>
waist region 8 is providec with a pair of first wings 13 extending<br>
outward from respective side edge portions 12 of the front waist<br>
region 8 in the transverse direction. The rear waist region<br>
10 is provided with a pair of second wings 14 extending outward<br>
from the respective side edge portions 12 of the rear waist<br>
region 10 in the transverse direction. In the diaper 1B,<br>
laterally outer end portions of the first and second wings 13,<br><br>
14 are put flat and permanently bonded together at a plurality<br>
of heat-sealing spots 38 arranged intermittently in the<br>
longitudinal direction. Thereupon the diaper 1B is formed with<br>
a waist-hole 36 and a pair of leg-holes 37.<br>
[0057]<br>
The topsheet 2 is formed from the same nonwoven fabric<br>
15	as that of the diaper 1A and the backsheet 3 is formed from<br>
the plastic film 16 and the nonwoven fabric 17 which are the<br>
same as those of the diaper 1A. The core 4 is the same as that<br>
of the diaper 1A and permanently bonded to the inner surface<br>
of at least one of the top- and backsheets 2, 3.<br>
[0058]<br>
The longitudinally opposite end portions 11 are formed<br>
from longitudinally opposite end portions 2a of the topsheet<br>
2	and longitudinally opposite end portions 3a of the backsheet<br>
3	extending outward beyond longitudinally opposite ends 4a of<br>
the core 4 . The top- and backsheets 2, 3 are overlapped together<br>
along the end portions 2a, 3a thereof and inner surfaces of these<br>
sheets 2, 3 are permanently bonded together to form the<br>
respective end portions 11. The waist surrounding elastic<br>
members 5 are attached t o the inner surfaces of the top- and<br>
backsheets 2, 3 so as to be interposed between the end portions<br>
2a of the topsheet 2 and the end portions 3a of the backsheet<br><br>
3 while these elastic members b are stretched at a given ratio<br>
in the transverse direction.<br>
[0059]<br>
The transversely opposite side edge portions 12 are<br>
formed from transversely opposite side edge portions 2b of the<br>
topsheet 2 and transversely opposite side edge portions 3b of<br>
the backsheet 3 extending outward in the transverse direction<br>
beyond transversely opposite side edges 4b of the core 4. The<br>
side edge portions 2b of the topsheet 2 extend outward in the<br>
transverse direction slightly beyond the transversely opposite<br>
side edges 4b of the core 4 and the side edge portions 3b of<br>
the backsheet 3 as well as the side edge portions 7a of the<br>
leak-barrier sheets 7 extend outward in the transverse<br>
direction beyond the side edge portions 2b of the topsheet 2.<br>
Along the side edge portions 12, the respective side edge<br>
portions 2b, 3b, 7a are overlapped and permanently bonded<br>
together. The leg surrounding elastic members 6 are interposed<br>
between the side edge portions 3b of the backsheet 3 and the<br>
side edge portions 7a of the respective leak-barrier sheets 7<br>
and permanently bonded to the respective inner surfaces of these<br>
sheets 3, 7 while these elastic members 6 are stretched at a<br>
given ratio in the longatudinal direction.<br>
[0060]<br><br>
The leak-barrier sheets 7 are formed from the same<br>
nonwoven fabric 20 as that of the diaper 1A and extend in the<br>
longitudinal direction between the front and rear waist regions<br>
8, 10. Each of the leak-barrier sheets 7 has the fixed side<br>
portion 7a lying outside the associated side edge 4b of the core<br>
4 and extending in the longitudinal direction, a movable portion<br>
7b normally biased to rise above the topsheet 2 and<br>
longitudinally opposite fixed end portions 7c lying on the<br>
longitudinally opposite end portions 11, respectively, and<br>
collapsed inward in the transverse direction of the diaper 1B.<br>
An elastic member 21 expending in the longitudinal direction<br>
is contractibly attached to the movable portion 7b in the<br>
vicinity of its distal end. The movable portion 7b rises up<br>
above the topsheet 2 so as to form barriers against bodily<br>
discharges.<br>
[0061]<br>
The first and second wings 13, 14 have transversely inner<br>
end portions 13a, 14a interposed between the side edge portions<br>
3b of the backsheet 3 and the fixed side portions 7a of the<br>
leak-barrier sheets 7 and permanently bonded to the respective<br>
inner surfaces of these sheets 3, 7 by means of adhesive (not<br>
shown) . The first and second wings 13, 14 are formed from an<br>
elastically stretchable composite sheet 18, respectively,<br><br>
which are elastically stretchable in the transverse direction.<br>
[0062]<br>
The composite sheet 18 comprises a breathable and<br>
stretchable plastic film 25 and a pair of breathable and<br>
heat-sealable fibrous ronwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B. The<br>
plastic film 25 and the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B have<br>
respective surfaces overlapped and partially bonded together<br>
by means of a plurality of heat-sealed spots 27 which are<br>
distributed as evenly as possible. These nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 26A, 26B are formed with a plurality of gathers 28 which<br>
rise and fall in the thickness direction of the diaper 1B. The<br>
nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B may be hydrophilic or<br>
hydrophobic.<br>
[0063]<br>
The plastic film 25 is formed from a elastically<br>
stretchable thermoplastic elastomer film 29 and thermoplastic<br>
synthetic resin film layers 30 placed upon both surfaces of the<br>
elastomer film 29. The elastomer film 29 and the synthetic<br>
resin film layers 30 are overlapped and bonded together along<br>
respective surfaces thereof opposed one to another. The<br>
plastic film 25 is formed with a plurality of air passages 31<br>
extending from its upper surface toward its skin<br>
non-contactable side (i.e., toward the nonwoven fabric layer<br><br>
26B) in the thickness direction of the diaper 1B. Each of these<br>
air passages 31 is defined by a first opening 32 facing the<br>
wearer's skin, a second opening 33 facing away from the wearer's<br>
skin and having a diameter smaller than that of the first opening<br>
32 and a tubular wall 34 extending between the first and second<br>
openings 32, 33 so as tc be tapered from the first opening 32<br>
toward the second opening 33.<br>
[0064]<br>
Inside the air passage 31, the nonwoven fabric layers 26A,<br>
26B have respective surfaces facing each other bonded together<br>
by means of heat-sealed spots 35. Similarly to the case of the<br>
second wings 14 shown in Fig. 1, these nonwoven fabric layers<br>
26A, 26B are bonded to each other in some of the air passages<br>
31. At the heat-sealed spots 27, 35, these nonwoven fabric<br>
layers 26A, 26B at the heat-sealed spots 27, 35 maintain a<br>
fibrous state. In other words, a fiber density of the nonwoven<br>
fabric layers 26A, 26B at these heat-sealed spots 27, 35 is<br>
higher than a fiber density thereof in the remaining region.<br>
[0065]<br>
The elastomer film 29 and the synthetic resin film 30 are<br>
formed from the same materials as those of the diaper 1A,<br>
respectively. The process for making the stretchable composite<br>
sheet 18 as well as the process for making the plastic film 25<br><br>
are the same as those having been described in reference with<br>
the diaper 1A. To shape the diaper 1B illustrated by Fig. 8<br>
from its state illustrated by Fig. 10 in the developed plan view,<br>
the diaper 1B may be folded along the crotch region 9 with the<br>
topsheet inside so that the front and rear waist regions 8, 10<br>
are opposed to each other and the outer end portions 13b, 14b<br>
of the first and second wings 13, 14 may be permanently bonded<br>
together by means of the heat-sealing lines 38.<br>
[0066]<br>
Of the composite sheet 18 forming each of the second wings<br>
14, the fibrous nonwoven fabric layer 26A contacts the wearer's<br>
skin during use of the diaper 1B, so it is not apprehended that<br>
the wings 14 might uncomfortably stick to the wearer's skin in<br>
spite of stretchable elasticity of the wings 14. Comfortable<br>
feeling to wear the diaper 1B is further enhanced by forming<br>
the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B using polyolefin-based<br>
synthetic resin fiber which is free from tackiness as well as<br>
sliminess peculiar to rubber-based material. Tightness of the<br>
diaper 1B around the wearer's waist can be appropriately<br>
adjusted by utilizing the elasticity of the second wings 14 so<br>
as to prevent the diaper 1B from slipping down from its proper<br>
position.<br>
[0067]<br><br>
The stretchable plastic film 25 constituting the<br>
composite sheet 18 is formed with a plurality of air passages<br>
31	 so that water vapor generated within the diaper 1B due to<br>
sweat evaporation can be Let out from the diaper 1B through these<br>
air passages 31 and thereby stuffiness possibly occurring<br>
within the diaper 1B can be prevented. More specifically, each<br>
of these air passages 31 extending through the plastic film 25<br>
in its thickness direction is tapered from the first opening<br>
32	 toward the second opening 3 3 and a surface tension acting<br>
on the air passage 31 is higher in the vicinity of the first<br>
opening 32 than in the vicinity of the second opening 33.<br>
Consequently, sweat having flowed into the first opening 32 can<br>
be easily transferred toward the second opening 33, i.e., toward<br>
the skin non-contacting side of the second wing 14 under the<br>
surface tension. In this way, wetness on this side of the wing<br>
14 can be rapidly eliminated.<br>
[0068]<br>
The nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B have fiber densities<br>
higher in the heat-sealed spots 27, 35 than in the respective<br>
remaining regions and therefore a capillary phenomenon occurs<br>
more significantly in the heat-sealed spots 27, 35 than in the<br>
remaining regions. Such significant capillary phenomenon<br>
allows any amount of sweat having permeated the remaining region<br><br>
of the nonwoven fabric layer 26A to be rapidly transferred and<br>
thereby allows the remaining region to be rapidly dried. In<br>
this way, uncomfortable tackiness and/or sliminess due to sweat<br>
which would otherwise stay on the remaining region of the<br>
nonwoven fabric layer 26A contacting with the wearer's skin can<br>
be effectively eliminated. Inside some of the air passages 31,<br>
the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B are bonded together at the<br>
heat-sealed spots 35, so water vapor generated as the amount<br>
of sweat having moved tc the heat-sealed spots 35 is evaporated<br>
can be let out from the diaper 1B through these air passages<br>
31 and the amount of sweat having permeated the nonwoven fabric<br>
layer 26A can be rapidly dried.<br>
[0069]<br>
The number of the air passages 31 formed through the<br>
plastic film 25 is in a range of 10 - 80/cm2 in the plastic film<br>
25 and a total area ratio of the first openings 32 of these air<br>
passages 31 is in a range of 10 - 20% of the plastic film 25.<br>
If the number of the air passages 31 is less than 10% and the<br>
total area ratio of the first openings 32 of these air passages<br>
31 is less than 10% of an area of the plastic film 25, the number<br>
of the air passages 31 per square centimetre of the plastic film<br>
25 as well as the opening area of the first openings 32 will<br>
be insufficient to let the water vapor out from the diaper 1B<br><br>
and to transfer the sweat toward the skin non-contacting side<br>
of the second wings 14. As a result, it would be impossible<br>
to prevent a stuffiness from being generated within the diaper<br>
1B. If the number of the air passages 31 exceeds 80/cm2 and<br>
the total area ratio of the first openings 32 of these air<br>
passages 31 exceeds 20% of the area of the plastic film 25, on<br>
the contrary, the film 25 will be formed with a number of the<br>
first openings 32 excessively close one to another and the film<br>
25 will be broken between each pair of the adjacent first<br>
openings 32. Thereupon the second wings 14 will lose the<br>
desired elasticity and no more contract again. In the diaper<br>
1B, the nonwoven fabric layers 26A, 26B are bonded to each other<br>
inside the air passages 31 formed through the film 25 by a range<br>
of 1.5 - 10% with respect to all the air passages 31. If this<br>
percentage is less than 1.5%, it will be impossible to let the<br>
water vapor generated due to evaporation of the sweat having<br>
been transferred to the heat-sealed spots 35 out from the diaper<br>
1B and therefore to dry the sweat having permeated the nonwoven<br>
fabric layer 26A.<br>
[0070]<br>
The first and second wings 13, 14 formed from a<br>
stretchable composite sheet 18 present transverse stretch<br>
stresses of 1.5 - 7.0 N as the wings 13, 14 are stretched in<br><br>
the transverse direction to length dimensions in the transverse<br>
direction correspondirg to 120% of non-stretched length<br>
dimensions of the respective wings 13, 14 both set as 100% and<br>
present transverse stretch stresses of 3.0 - 10.0 N as the wings<br>
13, 14 are stretched to length dimensions in the transverse<br>
direction corresponding to 150% of the non-stretched length<br>
dimensions of the respective wings 13, 14. If the stretch<br>
stresses of the first and second wings 13, 14 exceed the<br>
above-mentioned higher limits, the wings 13, 14 will needlessly<br>
clinch the wearer's waist as the diaper 1B is put on and the<br>
wearer will experience a feeling of oppression partially around<br>
his or her waist. If the stretch stresses of the first and<br>
second wings 13, 14 are less than the above-mentioned lower<br>
limits, on the contrary, contractile force of the wings 13, 14<br>
will be substantially ineffective and it will be impossible for<br>
these wings 13, 14 to clinch the wearer's waist appropriately.<br>
The stretch stresses cf the first and second wings 13, 14 are<br>
measured using the same method as has been described in<br>
reference with the diaper 1A.<br>
[0071]<br>
Stock material for the topsheet 2 may be selected from<br>
the group consisting of a hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric<br>
having a plurality of apertures and a plastic film having a<br><br>
plurality of fine perforations. Stock material for the<br>
backsheet 3 may be selected from the group consisting of a<br>
breathable hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric, a breathable<br>
liquid-impervious plastic film and a composite nonwoven fabric<br>
comprising two or more brsathable hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven<br>
fabric layers laminated one upon another. Stock materials for<br>
the leak-barrier sheets. 7 may be selected from the group<br>
consisting of a composite nonwoven fabric comprising two or more<br>
breathable hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric layers<br>
laminated one upon anotner and a composite sheet comprising<br>
breathable hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven fabric and a breathable<br>
liquid-impervious plastic film, laminated upon each other.<br>
[0072]<br>
As stock material for the backsheet 3 and the leak-barrier<br>
sheets 7, it is also possible to use a composite nonwoven fabric<br>
(SM nonwoven fabric or SMS nonwoven fabric) consisting of a melt<br>
blown fibrous nonwoven fabric having a high water-resistance<br>
and a spun bond fibrous nonwoven fabric having a high strength<br>
as well as a high flexibility laminated on at least one side<br>
of the melt blown fibrous nonwoven fabric.<br>
[0073]<br>
Fibrous nonwoven fabrics used to form the top- and<br>
backsheets 2, 3, the leak-barreir sheets 7, the first and second<br><br>
wings 13, 14, the tape fasteners 19 and the target tape 23 may<br>
be selected from those obtained by spun lace-, needle punch-,<br>
melt blown-, thermal bond-, spun bond- and chemical<br>
bond-processes.<br>
[0074]<br>
The hydrophilic fibrous nonwoven fabric may be made of<br>
any one of synthetic fiber, semi-synthetic fiber and<br>
regenerated fiber each modified to become hydrophilic or<br>
conjugate fiber thereof. The hydrophobic fibrous nonwoven<br>
fabric may be formed from synthetic fiber and may contain<br>
therein semi-synthetic fiber or regenerated fiber both treated<br>
to become water repellent. While not specified, the synthetic<br>
fiber may be selected from the group consisting of polyester-,<br>
polyacrylonitrile-, polyvinyl chloride-, polyethylene-,<br>
polypropylene- and polystyrene-based fibers. The suitably<br>
useful synthetic fibers further include core-sheath type<br>
conjugate fiber, side-by-side type conjugate fiber, macaroni<br>
fiber, microporous fiber and bonded-type conjugate fiber.<br>
[0075]<br>
It is preferred to use hot melt adhesive as the adhesive.<br>
In addition to hot melt adhesive, it is also possible to use<br>
any one of acrylic adhesive and elastomeric adhesive. The<br>
adhesive may be applied on the top- and backsheets 2, 3 and the<br><br>
leak-barrier sheets 7 in a suitable pattern selected from the<br>
group consisting of a spiral pattern, zigzag pattern, dotted<br>
pattern and striped pattern. Application of the adhesive on<br>
these sheets 2, 3, 7 in such pattern generates adhesive-coated<br>
regions and adhesive-free regions, resulting in that these<br>
sheets 2, 3, 7 are permanently bonded one to another in<br>
intermittent fashion, the sheets 2, 3, 7 are bonded to one to<br>
another in an intermittent, fashion and the core 4 is permanently<br>
bonded to the sheets 2, 3.<br>
[0076]<br>
In the diaper 1A, not only the second wings 14 but also<br>
the first wings 13 may be formed from the stretchable composite<br>
sheet 18 and, in the diaper 1B, it is possible to use the<br>
stretchable composite sheet 18 only for the second wings 14.<br><br>
