CROSS-REFERENCES TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001] This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application<br>
No. 60/950,294, filed July 17, 2007 (the entire content of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference).<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0002] The subject matter described herein generally relates to electric<br>
assemblies, and more particularly relates to electric current connector<br>
assemblies for use in vehicles.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Hybrid electric, fully electric, fuel cell, and other fuel efficient<br>
vehicles are becoming increasingly popular. Electric and hybrid electric<br>
vehicles utilize high voltage battery packs or fuel cells that deliver electric<br>
current necessary to drive electric traction systems and other vehicle systems.<br>
These vehicles use thick electric current connectors to deliver high power<br>
operating current from battery packs, fuel cells, and/or other power sources to<br>
electric motors and other electric devices and systems of the vehicle, and also<br><br>
between two or more such electric motors and other electric devices and <br>
systems of the vehicle.<br>
[0004] In addition, these vehicles typically include electric current sensors<br>
for each of the electric current connector, However, the electric current<br>
connectors and their corresponding electric current sensors consume space<br>
and/or weight within the vehicle systems. Such space and/or weight can often<br>
be at a premium in today's hybrid and fuel cell vehicles, particularly with the<br>
increasing complexity and additional features often included in such vehicles.<br>
[0005] Accordingly, it is desirable to provide improved electric current<br>
connector assemblies with electric current sensors, for example that provide an<br>
integrated electric current connector assembly and electric current sensor<br>
package. It also is desirable to provide improved electric current connector<br>
assemblies that potentially consume less space and/or weight in a hybrid or<br>
electric vehicle. In addition, it is desirable to provide improved electric<br>
current connector assemblies that are potentially Jess costly to produce as<br>
compared to typical electric current connector devices and typical electric<br>
current sensor packages. Furthermore, other desirable features and<br>
characteristics of the present invention will be apparent from the subsequent<br>
detailed description and the appended claims, taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings and the foregoing technical field and background.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0017] The following detailed description is merely exemplary in nature,<br>
and is not intended to limit the invention or the application and uses of the<br>
invention. Furthermore, there is no intention to be bound by any expressed or<br>
implied theory presented in the preceding technical field, background, brief<br>
summary or the following detailed description.<br>
[0018] FIG. 1 is a functional block diagram of a motor system 100 of a<br>
vehicle, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention. The vehicle may be any one of a number of different types of<br>
automobiles, such, as, for example, a sedan, a wagon, a truck, a van, a sport<br>
utility vehicle (SUV), or any one of a number of other different types of<br>
automobiles or other vehicles. The vehicle may also include any one or more<br>
different types of engines, such as, for example, a gasoline or diesel fueled<br>
combustion engine, a flex fuel vehicle (FFV) engine that uses a mixture of<br>
gasoline and alcohol, a gaseous compound engine that uses a gaseous<br>
compound such as hydrogen and natural gas, a combustion/electric motor<br>
hybrid engine, an electric motor, or a fuel cell motor.<br>
[0019] As depicted in FIG. I, the motor system 100 includes a power<br>
source 102, a first motor 104, a second motor 106, an inverter 108, a direct<br><br>
current (DC) connector 110, and an alternating current (AC) connector<br>
assembly 115. The power source 102 may include one or more batteries, fuel<br>
cells, and/or any number of other different types of power sources. It will be <br>
appreciated that the number of power sources, DC connectors, inverters, <br>
control assemblies and/or motors of the motor system 100 may vary from the <br>
depicted embodiments.<br>
[0020] In the depicted embodiment, the power source 102 provides direct<br>
current to the inverter 108 via the DC connector 110. The inverter 108, which<br>
has a control assembly 116 that controls operation thereof, converts this direct<br>
current to alternating current, and provides this alternating current to the first<br>
and second motors 104, 106 via the AC connector assembly 115. In one<br>
preferred embodiment, the control assembly 116 may include one or more<br>
electric circuit boards. However, this may vary in other embodiments.<br>
[0021] As depicted in FIG. 1, the AC connector assembly 115 includes a<br>
first connector 112 and a second connector 114. The first connector 112 has a<br>
first set of prongs 118 and a first sensor package 120. The first set of prongs<br>
118 transports the alternating current to the first motor 104. The first sensor<br>
package 120 determines a first measure of current of the first set of prongs<br>
118, and provides this first measure of current to the control assembly 136 for<br>
use in controlling the inverter 108.<br>
[0022] Similarly, the second connector 114 has a second set of prongs 122<br>
and a second sensor package 124. The second set of prongs 122 transports the<br>
alternating current to the first motor 104. The second sensor package 124<br>
determines a second measure of current of the second set of prongs 122, and<br>
provides this second measure of current to the control assembly 116 for use in<br>
controlling the inverter 108.<br>
[0023] More detailed illusions of the alternating current connector<br>
assembly 115, including the first, and second connectors 112, 114 thereof, are<br>
provided in FIGS. 2-5, and will be described in greater detail below in<br>
connection therewith. It will be appreciated that the number and/or nature of<br>
the connectors in the alternating curren connector assembly 115 may vary. In<br><br>
addition, the alternating current connector assembly 115 and/or the<br>
components thereof may also be utilized in connection with different types of<br>
vehicle devices, assemblies, and/or systems in various embodiments of the<br>
present Invention.<br>
[0024] FIG. 2 is a perspective view of an alternating current connector<br>
assembly 115 for a vehicle, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention. In a preferred embodiment, the alternating current<br>
connector assembly 115 is part of the motor system 100 of FIG. 1 and is<br>
electrically coupled between an inverter and two motors of the vehicle, as is<br>
depicted in FIG. 1. However, this may vary in other embodiments. For<br>
example, in certain other embodiments, the alternating current connector<br>
assembly 115 electrically connects two motors of a hybrid vehicle and<br>
transports alternating current between the two motors. In one such exemplary<br>
embodiment, one of the motors may serve as a generator while the other motor<br>
powers the vehicle. In another such exemplary embodiment, one of the<br>
motors may be used to power the vehicle while the vehicle is in a forward<br>
gear, while the other motor may be used to power the vehicle while the vehicle<br>
is in a reverse gear. Also in various embodiments, any number of different<br>
inverters, motors and/or other devices may be electrically coupled by the<br>
alternating current connector assembly 115.<br>
[0025] As depicted in FIG. 2, the AC connector assembly 115 includes the<br>
above-referenced first connector 112, with its first set of prongs 118, and<br>
second connector 114, with its second set of prongs 122. Also, in a preferred<br>
embodiment, the AC connector assembly 115 further includes a common<br>
housing 230, for example as shown in FIG. 2. In a preferred embodiment, the<br>
first and seconds of prongs 118, 122 extend through the length of the housing<br>
230 in connecting the inverter, such as the inverter 108 of FIG. 1, on one end<br>
of the housing 230 to multiple motors, such as the first and second motors 104,<br>
106, respectively, of FIG. 2 on the other end of the housing 230.<br>
[0026] Also as depicted in FIG. 2, the first connector 112 includes a first<br>
connector shell 232, in addition to the above-referenced first set of prongs 118<br><br>
(also depicted in FIG. 2) and first sensor package 120 (not depicted in FIG. 2).<br>
Similarly, the second connector 114 includes a second connector shell 234, in<br>
addition to the above-referenced second set of prongs 122 (also depicted in<br>
FIG. 2) and second sensor package 124 (not depicted in FIG. 2). The<br>
connector shells 232, 234 preferably are formed at least partially within the<br>
housing 230. In one preferred embodiment, the connector shells 232, 234 are<br>
cast together with the housing 230 as a single piece. However, this may vary<br>
in other embodiments.<br>
[0027] The first and second connectors 112, 114 are housed within the<br>
housing 230 and, more specifically, within their respective first and second<br>
connector shells 232, 234 that are formed at least partially within the housing<br>
230. Accordingly, in the exemplary embodiment discussed above, each of the<br>
first and second connectors 112, 114 is housed within a different<br>
corresponding one of the first or second connector shells 232, 234 but within<br>
the same common housing 230. However, this may vary in other<br>
embodiments.<br>
[0028] Each connector 112, 114 is configured to receive and transport<br>
electric current. Specifically, in a preferred embodiment, each connector 112,<br>
114 receives alternating current from one or more motors of the vehicle and<br>
transports the electric current to one or more other motors of the vehicle.<br>
[0029] As referenced above, each connector 112, 114 includes a respective<br>
set of prongs 118, 122. In the depicted embodiment, each of the first and<br>
second sets of prongs 118, 122 includes three prongs for transporting<br>
alternating current. In certain embodiments, each connector 112, 114 also<br>
includes three female mating connections (not depicted in FIG. 2, but depicted<br>
in FIGS. 6 and 7 as female mating connections 618 and 622, respectively, and<br>
described further below in connection therewith), preferably one such female<br>
mating connection electrically coupled to each prong of the respective first<br>
and second sets of prongs 118, 122 (for example, as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7<br>
with the first female mating connections 618 electrically coupled to the first<br>
set of prongs 118 and the second female mating connections 622 coupled to<br><br>
the second set of prongs 122, and as described further below in connection<br>
with FIS. 6 and 7). Unless expressly stated otherwise, "coupled" means that<br>
one element or feature is directly or indirectly joined to (or directly or<br>
indirectly communicates with) another element or feature, and not necessarily<br>
mechanically. Such female mating connections are housed within the<br>
connector shell 232, 234 for the corresponding connector 112, 114 in a<br>
preferred embodiment. In other embodiments, each connector 112, 114 may<br>
be electrically coupled to three female mating connections, each of which is<br>
preferably electrically coupled to a different prong of a corresponding one of<br>
the first or second sets of prongs 118, 122 corresponding to one of the<br>
connectors 112, 114. In a preferred embodiment, the female mating<br>
connections electrically couple the first and second prongs 118, 122 to one or<br>
motors, for example to one or more windings thereof.<br>
[0030] As mentioned, each prong of the first and second sets of prongs<br>
118, 122 is configured to receive and transport electric current. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, each such prong, also commonly referred to in the industry as a<br>
busbar, has an electrically conductive body. In certain non-limiting<br>
embodiments, each prong can handle currents up to 200 amps. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, each prong is made of copper or a copper alloy. However, this<br>
may also vary in other embodiments.<br>
[0031] Together, each of the sets of prongs 118, 122 of a corresponding<br>
connector 112, 114 preferably receives alternating current emanating from a<br>
first source and transports the alternating current in a direction toward a<br>
second source. For example, in one exemplary embodiment, each of the sets<br>
of prongs 118, 122 receives alternating current from an inverter of the vehicle,<br>
such as the inverter 108 of FIG. 1, and transports the alternating current to one<br>
of the motors of the vehicle, such as the first or second motor 104, 106 of FIG.<br>
1.<br>
[0032] Also in a preferred embodiment, the prongs 118, 122 transport and<br>
supply the alternating electric current to the one or more intended motors 104,<br>
106 also at least in part via the female mating connections (for example, the<br><br><br>
first and second female connections 618, 622 of FIGS. 6 and 7 and described<br>
below in connection therewith), which are preferably electrically coupled<br>
therebetween. For example, in one preferred embodiment, alternating current<br>
is provided from the first and second connectors 112, 114 to the female mating<br>
connections and ultimately to the one or more intended motors 104, 106.<br>
[0033] FIG. 3 is a perspective view of a portion of the AC connector<br>
assembly 115 of FIG. 2, including a portion of one of the connectors,<br>
specifically connector 114, in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of<br>
the present invention. As depicted in FIG. 3, in a preferred embodiment, the<br>
first connector 112 includes an insulator 340. For example, in the depicted<br>
embodiment in which the alternating current connector assembly 115 has two<br>
connectors 112, 114, the first connector 112 preferably includes a first<br>
insulator 340 (depicted in FIG. 3) that at least partially surrounds the first set<br>
of prongs 118 of the first connector 112. In addition, the second connector<br>
114 (not depicted in FIG. 2) preferably includes a similar, second insulator<br>
(also not depicted in FIG. 3) that at least partially surrounds a second set of<br>
prongs 122 of the second connector 114.<br>
[0034] The first insulator 340 preferably at least partially surrounds each<br>
of the first set of prongs 118, for example as shown in FIG. 3. In addition, the<br>
first insulator 340 preferably is disposed between the first set of prongs 118<br>
and the first sensor package 120 of FIG. 1, as shown in FIG. 4 (described<br>
below). The second (non-depicted) insulator preferably at least partially<br>
surrounds each of the second set of prongs 122 in a similar manner. In<br>
addition, the second insulator preferably is similarly disposed between the<br>
second set of prongs 122 and the second sensor package 124 of FIG. 1.<br>
[0035] FIG. 4 is a perspective view of a portion of the alternating current<br>
connector assembly 115 of FIG. 2, including a portion of the second connector<br>
114 and the second sensor package 124 thereof, in accordance with an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention. The second sensor package<br>
124 includes a plurality of sensors 452 (one is depicted in phantom in FIG. 4).<br>
Specifically, in a preferred embodiment, the second sensor package 124<br><br><br>
includes one sensor 452 for each prong of the second set of prongs 122<br>
corresponding to the second connector 114. Also in a preferred embodiment,<br>
the first sensor package 120 (not depicted in FIG. 4) similarly includes one<br>
sensor 452 for each prong of the first set of prongs 118 corresponding to the<br>
first connector 112. Accordingly, in a preferred embodiment in which each<br>
connector 112, 114 has three prongs 118, 122, each sensor package 120, 124<br>
likewise has three sensors 452.<br>
[0036] In a preferred embodiment, each of the sensors 452 of a particular<br>
sensor package 120, 124 is disposed within a common sensor shell 450 for the<br>
particular sensor package 120, 124. However, preferably each sensor package<br>
120, 124 has its own different sensor shell 450. Accordingly, sensors 452 of<br>
different sensor packages 120, 124 are preferably housed within different<br>
sensor shells 450. In a preferred embodiment, each sensor 452 is disposed<br>
proximate and determines a measure of electric current of a corresponding one<br>
of the prongs 118, 122 of the respective connector 112, 114 corresponding to<br>
the respective sensor package 120, 124 to which the sensor 452 belongs.<br>
Accordingly, in the embodiment depicted in FIG. 2 in which the alternating<br>
current connector assembly 115 includes two connectors 112, 114, each of a<br>
first plurality of sensors (not depicted in FIG. 4) belonging to the first sensor<br>
package 120 determines a first measure of electric current of one of the first<br>
set of prongs 118 belonging to the first connector 112. Similarly, in this<br>
embodiment, each of a second plurality of sensors 452 (depicted in FIG. 4)<br>
belonging to the second sensor package 124 determines a second measure of<br>
electric current of one of the second set of prongs 122 belonging to the second<br>
connector 114.<br>
[0037] As indicated in FIGS. 2-4, preferably each of the second set of<br>
prongs 122 extends not only through the second connector shell 234 but also<br>
through the sensor shell 450 of the second sensor package 124. Likewise,<br>
each of the first set of prongs 118 preferably extends not only through the first<br>
connector shell 232 but also through a similar sensor shell of the first sensor<br>
package 120.<br><br>
[0038] In addition, in a preferred embodiment, each prong 118, 122<br>
extends through at least a portion of a different one of the sensors 452 within<br>
the corresponding sensor shell 450 corresponding to the sensor package 120,<br>
124 to which the sensor 452 belongs, for example as shown in phantom in<br>
FIG. 4. In addition, most preferably each of the sensors 452 surrounds a<br>
portion of a corresponding prong 118, 122 that passes therethough within the<br>
corresponding sensor shell 450. However, this may vary in other<br>
embodiments.<br>
[0039] The exemplary second connector 114 of FIG. 4 is depicted without<br>
its second connector shell 234 for illustrative purposes, for example to display<br>
the second set of prongs 122 and the insulator 340. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the sensor shell 450 of each particular sensor package 120, 124<br>
is at least substantially aligned with the respective connector shell 232, 234 of<br>
the respective connector 112, 114 corresponding to the respective sensor<br>
package 120, 124 (i.e. with a particular corresponding connector shell 232,<br>
234 that corresponds thereto).<br>
[0040] Preferably each particular sensor shell 450 is aligned both in terms<br>
of proximity and geometry with the connector shell 232, 234 corresponding<br>
thereto, for example as shown in FIG. 4 as well as FIG. 7 (discussed further<br>
below). Specifically, each particular sensor shell 450 is preferably nearly<br>
adjacent to the connector shell 232, 234 corresponding thereto, with one of the<br>
above-referenced insulators 340 preferably disposed between each such<br>
particular sensor shell 450 and the particular connector shell 232, 234<br>
corresponding thereto. In addition, each sensor shell 450 is preferably<br>
designed such that it fits at least approximately directly underneath and within<br>
the particular connector shell 232, 234 corresponding thereto, without<br>
protruding laterally beyond the particular connector shell 232, 234<br>
corresponding thereto except in a downward direction into the housing, for<br>
example as is illustrated in FIGS. 2-4 (for example, in FIGS. 2-4, each sensor<br>
shell 450 cannot be seen from the perspective views unless the particular<br>
connector shell 232, 234 is removed for illustrative purposes, due to this<br><br>
configuration). This preferred configuration allows for the sensors 452 to be<br>
housed in proximity to portions of the respective prongs 118, 122<br>
corresponding thereto that extend within the respective particular connector<br>
shell 232, 234 corresponding thereto, while otherwise minimizing space<br>
around the sensors 452 and the respective prongs 118, 122 corresponding<br>
thereto. However, this may vary in other embodiments.<br>
[0041] Also in a preferred embodiment, the sensor shell 450 is shaped at<br>
least approximately similar to the corresponding connector shell 232, 234 to<br>
allow for tight and compact packaging for the sensors 452 disposed within the<br>
sensor shell 450. The packaging and integration of the connectors 112, 114<br>
and the respective sensor packages 120, 124 in close proximity to one another<br>
and within the common housing 230 allows for potential savings in space,<br>
weight, and/or manufacturing costs associated with the AC connector<br>
assembly 115, among other potential benefits thereof. In addition, the above-<br>
referenced shaping and coordination of the connector shells 232, 234 with<br>
their corresponding sensor shells 450 provide for additional for potential<br>
savings in space, weight, and/or manufacturing costs associated with the<br>
alternating current connector assembly 115, among other potential benefits.<br>
[0042] Also as shown in FIG. 4, in one preferred embodiment, the second<br>
connector 114 preferably also includes a cable 454 that electrically connects<br>
the sensors 452 to a control assembly, such as the control assembly 116 of the<br>
inverter 108 of FIG. 1. Specifically, in this preferred embodiment, the second<br>
sensor package 124 supplies the second measure of current of the second set<br>
of prongs 122 to the control assembly via the cable 454 depicted in FIG. 4.<br>
Also in a preferred embodiment, the first connector 112 includes a similar<br>
cable 454 (for example, as shown in FIG. 7, discussed below that electrically<br>
connects the sensors 452 of the first sensor package 120 to a control assembly,<br>
such as the control assembly 116 of the inverter 108 of FIG. 1. Specifically, in<br>
this preferred embodiment, the first sensor package 120 supplies the first<br>
measure of current of the first set of prongs 118 to the control assembly via a<br>
cable that is similar to the cable 454 depicted in FIG. 4.<br><br><br>
[0043] Turning now to FIG. 5, a perspective view of a [is this an underside<br>
portion?] portion of the AC connector assembly 115 of FIG. 2 is provided,<br>
including a portion of the second sensor package 124 thereof, in accordance'<br>
with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. As depicted in FIG.<br>
5, a different sensor 452 preferably extends radially around a portion of a<br>
different one of each of the second set of pongs 122 of the second connector<br>
114. Likewise, a similar non-depicted sensor preferably extends radially<br>
around a portion of a different one of each of the first set of pongs 118 of the<br>
first connector 112.<br>

female mating connections 618 is coupled to a respective one of the first set of<br>
prongs 118. Similarly, the second set of female mating connections 622<br>
extend through the second connector shell 234, including an outer portion 634<br><br><br>
thereof as shown in FIGS. 6 and 7. Each of the second set of female mating<br>
connections 622 is coupled to a respective one of the second set of prongs 122.<br>
[0046] FIGS. 6 and 7 aiso further illustrate the alignment of the sensor<br>
shells 450 of FIG. 4. As described above, each particular sensor shell 450 is<br>
preferably aligned both in terms of proximity and geometry with the connector<br>

previously discussed, in connection with FIGS. 2-4 as well. Also as described<br>
above, preferably each particular sensor shell 450 is disposed nearly adjacent<br>
to, the connector shell 232, 234 corresponding thereto. In addition, each<br>
sensor shell 450 is preferably designed such that it fits at least approximately<br>
directly underneath and within the particular connector shell 232, 234<br>
corresponding thereto, without protruding laterally beyond the particular<br>
connector shell 232, 234 corresponding thereto except in a downward<br>
direction into the housing, for example as is illustrated in FIG. 7 as well as<br>
FIGS. 2-4 above, in accordance with exemplary embodiments of the present<br>
invention. However, it will be appreciated that this may vary in other<br>
