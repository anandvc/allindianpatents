				<td>A PULVERISING MACHINE AND A METHOD FOR MAKING WOOD DUST<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates generally to a machine for pulverising wood and particularly to a mobile machine for pulverising wood and a method of pulverising wood.<br>
BACK GROUND ART<br>
Wood dust is generally known in the art. Particularly, wood dusts with high calorific value are used as fuel in multi-fuel boilers. Wood dust is used as domestic fuel in stoves, earthen or otherwise.<br>
A number of methods of making and machinery to make the same are known in the art. It is generally known to bring the cut wood to a drying site and powder it using heavy machinery. It usually involves multiple operations and machinery. For example, the cut wood has to be carried to the required sit, it has to be cut in a different machine and blown in different machine. These processes generally are time consuming and involve expert labour, thereby increasing the cost and making the final product uneconomical.<br>
US 4,785,860, granted to Arasmith, teaches an apparatus for processing wood, comprising a cylindrical drum mounted for rotation about its longitudinal axis, a cutting member, means for mounting the cutting member upon the circumferential surface of the drum such that its cutting edge is positioned a first distance from the drum surface, means for rotating the drum such that the cutting element passes along a circular path concentric to the surface of the drum, a pair of parallel ring sections each having a first and a second end and a substantially uniform cross section, and having an arcuate configuration along their length substantially conforming to the circumferential surface of the surface of the drum, the first ends of the spacing elements being positioned laterally adjacent to the path of travel of the cutting member, and extending in parallel relationship in front of the cutting member such that a gullet is defined in front of the cutting edge by the cutting member, the<br><br>
ring sections, and the surface. A repeating pattern exists for the placement of the rings and cutting members upon the surface of the drum.<br>
Making the drum rotate and making the cutting element along the circumference of the drum is a tedious process and not efficient too.<br>
US 5,649,578, granted to Leguin, teaches an improved wood pulveriser which is provided with a rotating disc studded with a plurality of curved tapered hammers. One or more anvils are secured to the pulveriser with the anvil having teeth and slots located adjacent the surface of the disc. The hammers of the rotating disc pass through the slots of the anvils as the disc rotates to tear and shard wood into bits and pieces for subsequent use or processing. The anvils of the present invention are formed with two or more useable surfaces so that the anvils can be removed, rotated, and replaced to present fresh cutting surfaces to the disc. Further, the anvils are formed by a series of bolted together anvil segments to allow replacement of only single segments in the event of damage.<br>
Presence of multiple hammers on a rotating disc makes this process cumbersome, noisy and inefficient.<br>
None of the related machinery in the state of art is an insitu machine, in the sense that the machinery is mobile.<br>
In dry parts of the world where bush trees are generally used as fuel, when the main trunk is cut and taken away for further processing, the remains of the tree like the twigs and branches are left behind as it is not economic to carry them and process them using the machinery available in the art. Hence, it is to make use of these remains, and not limited only to them, an efficient machinery is required.<br>
It is clear that dust making machines in the state of art are not able to use the tree to make dust and thus there is a waste of energy.<br>
The present invention addresses these and other shortcomings of the prior art.<br><br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a novel pulverising machinery that is efficient and simple in construction.<br>
The main object of the invention is to use the available energy in the remains of the tree left over after the removal of the trunk.<br>
It is one of the objects of the invention to use a single machinery to pulverise wood.<br>
It is another object of the invention to pulverise wood insitu.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to develop a mobile machine.<br>
It is yet another object of the invention to develop a cost effective method for pulverising wood.<br>
