This invention in general relates to a modified ring spinning tube, which reduces the duration of slow speed running of the ring spinning machine in the spinning mill. Generally while using the existing ring spinning tube in the ring spinning machine, the machine has to be run at a slow speed for quite some time at the initial stage to avoid excessive end breaks till the diameter of the bobbin reaches practically possible maximum diameter (for the given ring diameter). According to the present invention, the spinning machine can be run at high speed by nearly totally eliminating the run in slow speed.<br>

PRIOR ART<br>
DESCRIPTION ABOUT RING SPINNING PROCESS SYSTEM WITH SIMPLIFIED DIAGRAM (FIG/lO<br>
In Ring Spinning process, the drafting elements draft the input of roving end (strand of fibre) and then simultaneously inserts the required amount of twist by the ring and traveler ,and winds the spun yarn on to a bobbin.<br>
Fig ' 1' is the simplified diagram of the system. There is a drafting zone 'G' , the drawn and twisted fibres pass through lappet 'L' through a traveler 'J' on the ring 'R' and onto the bobbin 'B'. The spindle 'S' is rotated by a tape 'K' drive and the bobbin is built by a controlled rise and fall of the ring rail 'Q'. The winding position of yarn 'Y on the ring spinning tube 'A' is dependent upon the relative position of Ring and Traveler, for that particular spindle which in turn is dependent upon the Ring Rail position on which are mounted the ring and the Traveler. The ring rail extending across the length of the ring frame traverses vertically, up and down. The traversing motion is controlled by the building motion of the frame and many of the motion use a cam as the prime mover. The cam rotates and the cam follower movement is translated by a mechanical linkage to the ring rail. Cams have profiles that give different ring rail velocity, i.e. a slow upward motion and fast downward motion, the extent of traverse being the same, but the successive traverses starting at slightly upward position than the earher traverse depending upon the yarn count.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION ABOUT EXISTING RING SPINNING TUBE<br>
Fig '2' shows the existing Ring spinning tube, in this 'H' is the total height of the tube. Depending upon the spindle height, the height of the tube (H) will also change. T' is the wall thickness of the tube as shown in fig. '2'. Dl' is the outer diameter of the extreme bottom and D4 is the outer diameter of the extreme top.<br>
Normally the existing ring spinning tube are made in 1:40 and 1-64 taper from the extreme bottom to the top. The dimensions of 'H', 'D1', 'D4' and T as shown in Fig '2' are manufactured with varying dimensions according to need.<br>
RING SPINNING MACHINE RUNNING WITH EXISTING RING<br>
SPINNING TUBE The process of working of the ring spinning machine with the existing ring spinning tube is explained in detail with the help of the schematic diagram as shown in fig. '3'.<br>
According to Spinning Theory, for a given ring diameter 'R' and Spindle speed 'Si', the yarn tension 'T on yarn balloon will be maximum Tmax when the difference between the ring diameter and bobbin diameter 'B' is maximum. This occurs when the bobbin diameter is the smallest which is the bare bobbin diameter 'Bmin'.<br><br>
In the same way, the yarn tension will be minimum Tmin.' when the difference between the ring diameter and bobbin diameter is minimum, which occurs when the bobbin diameter is the largest which is practically nearest to the ring diameter.<br>
The instantaneous tension acting on the yarn balloon will be somewhere in between the two extremes *Bmax/ and 'Bmin/ depending upon the instantaneous bobbin diameter. A yarn breakage occurs when the instantaneous balloon tension exceeds yarn strength for a sufficient length of time.<br>
For a given ring diameter 'R' and spindle speed 'Si', the average tension Tavg' during a full traverse of the ring rail will be fairly constant when the largest diameter of the bobbin 'Bmax' is practically nearest to the ring diameter. The spindle speed 'S1' is chosen, considering this 'Tavg/ and the yarn strength in order to have optimum breakage level.<br>
As per fig. '3.1' , during the initial winding of ring spinning tube, the difference between the ring diameter and bobbin diameter 'Bmin' is maximum and also fairly constant which gradually comes down as the bobbin builds-up by the winding of successive coils by the traversing ring rail. For this reason, the average yarn tension for a full traverse of the ring rail, is very high at this stage because of which breakage will also be very high for the chosen spindle speed 'S1'.<br><br>
For the above reason, as shown in fig. '3.2', the start of the winding till the practically possible maximum bobbin diameter 'Bmax as shown in fig. '3.3' is reached, in practical spinning, the spindle speed is deliberately maintained lower as 'S2' in order to minimize the excessive end breaks.<br>
In practical spinning, this difference between the normal spindle speed 'S1' called 'H'igh Speed' and the reduced spindle speed 'S2 called 'Slow Speed' will be in the order of 10 to 15% of the High Speed and the duration of this Slow Speed phase will be to the extent of 10 to 15% of the total running time for the full doff.<br>
The overall effects of the above are fairly constant breakage rate throughout the build of the bobbin from empty to full stage but a drop in production rate during the initial slow speed stage. Though this practice maintains fairly constant breakage rate throughout the build of the bobbin, it would be better if the loss of production during the slow speed phase can be avoided by some suitable arrangement, which led to the innovation for the present invention.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION :<br>
According to the invention, A Ring Spinning Tube with an Inbuilt ProGIe is described which comprises, a straight section with Height "H" and diameter "D4" ; a section at the bottom of the straight section with a height "L2" and with diameter "Dl" ; a projection consisting of 2 sections, above "L2" region, with a height "LI" -  a First section of the projection being tapered with a<br><br>
maximum diameter "D2" at bottom portion of the taper and minimum diameter "D3" at the top portion of the taper and "3" being the angle between "D2" and "D3" which may vary upto a maximum of 90 degree and "L3" being the height between "D2" and "D3"; a Second section of the projection being either curved or tapered or straight or a combination and with a curved radius of "R" and the length of the taper being "Z"; a thickness, of wall of the spinning tube "T", of total height "H" except the projected portion of length "LI".<br>
DESCRIPTION ABOUT INVENTED RING SPINNING TUBE<br>
WITH AN INBUILT PROFILE<br>
Fig '4' shows the nomenclature of innovated A Ring Spinning Tube with An inbuilt Profile, which has an profile (projection) in itself, designed in such a manner to have a curve / radius and taper, which is the main and major difference from the existing ring spinning tube. There is a profile (projection) at the initial yarn winding area, as shown in Fig 4. in the invented Premier techno ring spinning tube.<br>
In figure 4, 'H' is the total height of the spinning tube. In which a profile (projection) is made at the bottom with a total height of 'LI' with a straight area 'L2' to the bottom portion of the profile and 'L3' is the length of the taper area. 'D1' is the outer diameter of the bottom straight area where the profile relieving area starts, which should be lesser than the Maximum diameter area 'D2' of the profile where the initial yarn winding area starts and Httle greater than the   diameter of the Minimum diameter<br><br>
area 'D3' of the profile which is the end of the profile. 'D4' is the outer diameter area of the top of the tube. 'T is the thickness of the wall of the tube which can be varied depending on the need. 'P' is the angle between the profile max '(D2)' and profile min '(D3)' and 'Z' is the length of the taper of the profile. 'P &amp; Z" are the precious and the crucial factor to make the profile and this can vary up to 90° as indicated in fig 4.1. 'Z' can vary from bottom to top of the tube. 'R' is the radius of the curve in the bottom portion of the profile.<br>
Fig.- 4 shows a "A Ring Spinning Tube with An inbuilt Profile" with appropriate dimensions for a typical condition of 40mm Ring diameter and 180mm spindle height in order to explain the concept. However, variations in dimensions are possible for a given individual ring spinning tube and any kind of varying dimensions with the ultimate aim of reducing or totally eliminating the slow speed running duration are covered by this invention.<br>
As explained earher, the Ring Spinning Tube with an Inbuilt Profile has been designed with a profile at the initial winding position of the bobbin similar to the one with the practically possible maximum diameter of the bobbin which is reached earliest by the actual winding of yarn layers but which necessitates slow speed running till reaching the stage. As this is practically possible when maximum diameter of the bobbin is inbuilt at the initial winding position itself, because of which slow<br><br>
speed running can be near totally eliminated right from the beginning of the winding after the doffing.<br>
The following list explains the nomenclature as well as the dimensions for the various specifications mentioned in detail in Fig." 4.1. (projected and cross sectional view of the invented Techno Ring Spinning Tube) in the invented A Ring Spinning Tube with an Inbuilt Profile.<br>

The above mentioned dimensions and range of dimensions are given for proper understanding of the invented A Ring Spinning Tube with an Inbuilt Profile and will vary depending upon the spindle height, ring diameter, selection of profile design and selection of profile starting area on the tube.<br><br>
RING SPINNING MACHINE RUNNING WITH THE INVENTED RING SPINNING TUBE WITH AN INBUILT PROFILE<br>
A Ring Spinning Tube With An Inbuilt Profile is designed with a profile (Projection) shown in fig '4' to have the practically possible maximum diameter of the bobbin 'Bmax (for the given ring diameter) at the initial yarn winding position of the doff itself, without waiting for that diameter to build-up by winding of yarn layers.<br>
Hence the average yarn tension during the full traverse of the ring rail approaches fairly constant right from the initial winding of the bobbin itself, the need to reduce the spindle speed at that stage becomes unnecessary.<br>
Accordingly, the slow speed phase can be near totally eliminated by using the Ring spinning tube with an Inbuilt Profile and spinning can be carried out at High Speed from the start to the end of the doff.<br>
The resulting advantages are that, there would be fairly constant breakage rate and the increase in the production rate from the start to end of the doff with less time consumption which gives an overall increase in the production rate compared to the existing ring spinning tube deign in which a slow speed phase is necessary at the start of the doff.<br><br>
Trials were conducted using existing ring spinning tubes and Ring spinning tubes with an inbuilt profile in ring spinning frames, which gave the following results.<br>
a.	While using the existing ring spinning tube, the duration of<br>
slow speed phase is 15% of the total running time for the full<br>
doff for which slow speed is necessary from the start of the yarn<br>
winding till the practically possible maximum bobbin diameter<br>
'Bmax is reached. In practical spinning, the spindle speed is<br>
deliberately maintained lower as 'S2' in order to minimize the<br>
excessive end brakes.<br>
The ring spinning frame running with 'S2 slow speed makes 13,600 RPM (Revolution Per Minute) and with 'Si' high speed makes 15,600 RPM in 82's Combed, lOO's Combed, 120's Combed.<br><br>
b.	While using The Ring spinning tube with an inbuilt profile in<br>
same ring frames in same counts with the same spindle speeds,<br>
the duration of the slow speed phase is kept for 1% of the total<br>
running time for the full doff due to The Ring spinning tube<br><br>
with an Inbuilt Profile designed with 'profile' to have the practically possible maximum diameter of the bobbin (for the given ring diameter) at the initial yarn winding position of the doff itself, without waiting for that diameter to build up by winding of the yam layers.<br>
Average spindle speed using A Ring spinning tube with an inbuilt<br>
profile is as follows<br>
Spindle Speed,   Slow Speed	13,600 x 1%        =        136 RPM<br>
Highspeed	15,600x99%     =   15,444 RPM<br>
Average Spindle Speed	=   15,580 RPM<br>
Difference of the average Spindle Speed while using A Ring Spinning Tube with an Inbuilt Profile to that of the existing ring spinning tube is 280 R.P.M.<br>
Increase in percentage of the spindle speed is 1.8%<br><br><br><br>
From the above results we can observe the major advantages of the Ring Spinning Tube with an Inbuilt profile in different counts as mentioned below,<br><br>
As per South India Textile Research Association, Studies conducted and published in operational factors Critical to Cost Reduction in Spinning Mills (1996 - Costs) Mill Control Report No. 13. , the savings are given below,<br><br><br>
From the above table we can arrive net savings of the Mill / year calculations as follows<br><br><br><br>
1.	Yarn counts<br>
2.	Yarn Quality<br>
3.	Selection of reduced spindle speed 'S2' called slow speed.<br>
4.	Selection of the duration of the slow speed phase.<br>
5.	Make &amp; model of the ring frame.<br>
SCOPE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In ring spinning tube as shown in fig '4' profile (projection) can be achieved with varying dimensions through single or any of these combinations such as, taper, straight, curve/radius at the initial yarn winding portion (zone) of the ring spinning tube of every doff.<br>
The taper can be achieved with increasing / decreasing angle up to 90° in to the profile tube.<br><br>
The curve / radius can be achieved with varying dimensions from bottom to top depending upon the selection of the profile design.<br>
The straight portion can be achieved with varying dimensions from bottom to top depending up on selection of profile design.<br>
The single or combinations of the taper, straight, curve / radius with varying dimensions may or may not extend firom the extreme bottom portion of the ring spinning tube to extreme top portion of the ring spinning tube.<br>
The few possible designs of Ring Spinning Tube with an inbuilt profile with variable profiles are shown in figures 5.1 to 5.11. There may be other possible designs of profile (projection) in any manner with existing ring spinning tube.<br>
Any Ring Spinning Tube designed by any manner with varying dimensions of single or combinations of the Taper, Straght, Radius with the ultimate aim of avoiding or reducing the duration of slow speed running at the beginning of the winding of bobbin, based on the principle and idea of Ring Spinning Tube with an Inbuilt profile, are covered under the present invention.<br>
Wherever twisting and winding (like doubling machines) is done by combination of ring, traveler and rotating spindles, this premier techno ring tube can be beneficially used for increasing<br><br>
the overall production rate and which also reduces the end breaks level, even though there is no slow speed running in the Ring Doubling Process.<br>
Other advantages over the present invention<br>
Worker (Piecer) efficiency will be improved since the piecer need not remove the bobbin fix)m the spindle when the techno ring spinning tube is used, where as with usual tubes, the piecer normally takes the bobbin from the spindle frequently from initial stage to 'Bmax of the bobbin due to breakage at the lower most winding position of the doff as yarn finding is too difficult in 'Bmin'.<br>
To get away with the dual motor or to get away with sophisticated motors for varying the speed during the doff, a simple induction motor with flat pulley may be sufficient if the present invention is used.<br>
Other possible designs of the profile with varying dimensions are featured in figures 5.1 to 5.11.<br><br><br><br><br>
