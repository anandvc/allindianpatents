FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
This invention relates to manufacture of interiocking building blocks using waste materials particularly dyeing sludge, fly ash, red soil<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to make use of waste materials in the dyeing industry and fly ash waste materials deposited after burning coal<br>
Another object of the invention is to make buikling blocks with interiocking mechanism so that the blocks can be so arranged to build walls without being necessaiy for any bonding materials like cement.<br>
BACKGROUND AND OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION;<br>
Due to rapid growth of the industry there is huge amount of effluent discharged from various industries. This has caused tremendous environmental problem by polluting water and air. In order to minimize the pollution to the air and water the Government has brought legislations, which mandates treatment of effiuents before it is dischaiged into tfie water or into the open environment The treated effluents are discharged into water courses. This has to some extent reduced water pollution and saved the rivers and other water courses out of the danger of the effluents which contained toxic materials and substances.<br>
However, the residue solid materials after effluent treatment started filing up and now the industry is finding it difficult to dispose off these solid residue waste materials. In particular dyeing industry was discharging untreated effluents directty into the water courses and channels all the residue waste materials which was in the form of flowing liquid mixture of water, chemical substances. After it has become mandatoxy for the dyeing industry to set up effiuent treatment plants and treat the effluents before it is let into the water courses huge amount of chemical substances in the form of solid started piliig up which could not be disposed off. Therefore it is the main object of this invention is to make use of these sludge effectively and commercially so that the problem of disposal of this solid waste from the silved industry is solved thereby helping the industries.<br><br>
Apart from the dyeing sludge there is also a problem in disposing fly ash, residue waste materials in thermal power plants and other industries where coal is being used. Equally there is also problem in disposmg off quarry dust, which is also accumulating in dangerous proportion. Though gypsum which is also a residue material from fertilizer factories is being put to various other uses still large amount of gypsum is waiting for disposal The primary object of this invention is to make commercial use of the waste materials particularly dyeing sludge, ffy ash, quarry dust, gypsum, etc. As the construction industry is going at a rapid speed there is a tremendous demand building up for bricks and cement Due to the modem technology the buildings are raised with columns and pillars and the walls have no role in supporting the structree. It is mostiy used as dividers in the buildings.<br>
rherefore by producing alternatives to bricks which use no cement to build dividing walls in the main building and compound walls. The cost of construction can be minimized aart from being reducing the demand for bricks and cement or otherwise the use of the bricks and cements are restricted only where it is absolutely necessary for the specific strength. This invention arms at manufacturing blocks which can be arranged vertically and horizontally by interiocking inbuilt system which makes the blocks hold on with each other both vertically and horizontaly thereby there is no need for bondage materials like cement or other mortars. This invention uses the residual waste materials hitherto causing problems for the industry in disposing the same and makes blocks which are interiockable. Depending upon the specific resuirements and specifications, ratio and use of the fly ash, dyeing shudge and quarry dust win be varied in making the building blocks.<br>
Thus one of the primary of the invention is to consume commercially the waste materials of the industry. One of the object of the invention is to totally eliminate consumption of sand which is becoming costly and dearer and also water in the building industry. The price of sand is not only raising but also the consumption of sand causes ecological disturbances thereby preventing precipitation of water thereby causing depletion of ground water level apart from there being danger in the course of the rivers being changed due to indiscriminate quarrying. There is huge protest by die people living on the banks of the river for quanying sands. It has now become necessary to reduce consumption of sand in the building industry. The blocks made of the above method and substances would totally eliminate use of sand.<br>
Apart from this there is also savings in use of clay and firewood as these blocks effectively replaces bricks.<br>
The interiocking blocks also can be manufactured using red mud with lime stone and Jalli available in natural soil.<br><br>
BRIEF STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION:<br>
The dyeing sludge deriving out of the Dyedng Industries is taken out after the treatment of the dyeing shidge by the assodation of the Dyeing Intdustries, which is functioning with the aid of the Government This dyeing sludge which will be in the form of thick paste is dried up to form stone like substance without any water content in it<br>
The dried sludge is put into the stone crusher and powdered. The powdered dyeing sludge is mixed with fly ash, cement, lime, pedi proof, quarry dust, gypsum and water as required using a mixture machine for the purpose. This has to be mixed thoroughly adeast for 10 minutes.<br>
The mixture is taken and put into the prefabricated moulds which has a device consisting of male and female grooves to hold them tight interlocked on the top, bottom, front and back sides. Then the mixture is subjected to a 150 to 200 kg3 per cm. pressure for atleast 3 seconds which then forms into Blocks.<br>
The blocks are taken out of the mould and kept under room temperature for 12 to 18 hrs for diying. After drying the blocks are given water curing by putting into water tank submerging them for 10 to 14 days.<br>
Subsequent to submerging the blocks in the water tanks, the blocks are dried under direct Sun for atleast three days. This is to cure the water sucked by the blocks while it was submerged in the water. Then the interlock blocks are ready for use<br>
The interiock blocks can be manufactured with the following composition of materials per block measurings 6" x 5" x 10,5" to 12" &amp; 8" Width x 5" Height x 10,5** to 12" Length.<br>
