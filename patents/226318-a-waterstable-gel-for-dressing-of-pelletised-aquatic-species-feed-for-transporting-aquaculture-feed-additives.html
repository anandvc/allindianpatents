FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a waterstable gel for dressing of pelletised aquatic species feed for transporting aquaculture feed additives.<br>
BACKGROOUND OF INVENTION<br>
Aquaculture species at times require medication/other healthcare treatments to be rendered to them as "TOP DRESS" on feed. A medium is required to administer the healthcare products to aquatic animals, successfully without undergoing leaching loss in water. Some species are quick feeders while some of them are slow feeders and they require "TOP DRESSED" materials to stay (on feed) in water for a longer period. All ingredients used are GRAS (Generally Regarded As Safe), easily digestible and have no side effects on the animal or humans who consume the fish/shrimp as food.<br>
It is known to use gels as a carrier for medicaments or other additives onto the feed pellets without considering its holding capacity.<br><br>
Several gels are currently available for aquaculture purposes with the following deficiencies.<br>
1.	After coating onto the feed granules/pellets do not dry up fast,<br>
2.	The medicaments or nutritional adjuncts added to the gel, while coating leaches out within 5-10 minutes when put in the aquaculture pond resulting in an economical loss to the farmer.<br>
3.	Leaching of medicaments into water causes depletion in dissolved oxygen level thereby increasing BOD and COD of water.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose stable gels for transporting aquaculture additives as top dressing to aquatic species.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose stable gels which efficiently transports medicaments or other additives into aquaculture species, which in turn results in maximum utilization of the added medicament or additive.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose stable gel which mixes up well with normal medicaments or nutritional adjuncts used for aquaculture.<br><br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose stable gels which is easier to coat on feed pellets or granules.<br>
A further object of this invention is to propose stable gels which has an attractant in the gel to attract aquatic species to their feed pellets and thereby resulting in quicker and complete feed consumption.<br>
A still further object of this invention is to propose stable gels which dries up much faster in air and doesn't allow leaching of medicaments/feed supplements/probiotics and herbal extracts.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a waterstable gel for dressing of pelletised aquatic species feed for transporting aquaculture additives characterized in that a solution in water of the compound selected from the carbomer group having 0.5% to 2,5% concentration, 0.1%-0.75% of a pharma-ceutically accepted cellulose and 0.25%-2.0% of natural flavour and the resultant composition having a pH value in the range of 4.5 to 8.5 and viscosity in the range of 10,000-25,000 cP.<br><br>
Further according to this invention there is provided a waterstable gel for dressing of pelletised aquatic species feed for transporting aquaculture additives characterized in that tff a solution in water of the compound selected from the carbomer group having 2.5% to 5% concentration, 2%-5% of a pharmaceutically accepted cellulose and L5%-2.5% of natural flavour and the resultant composition having a pH value in the range of 6.5 to 8.0 and viscosity in the range of 15,000-20,000 cP.<br>
DETAIL DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The product is a highly water stable transparent and high viscous gel. It contains a high molecular weight binder with no roping and sticking which helps in easy blending with or without added feed supplements and medicaments.<br>
The polymer includes acrylic acid polymer/carboxyl vinyl polymer/carboxyl polymethylene Acritamer. The cellulose may be sodium carboxy methyl cellulose/methyl cellulose/ethyl cellulose/hydroxy propyl cellulose/hydroxy ethyl cellulose/hydroxy propyy methyl cellulose phthalate/hydroxy butyl cellulose. These ingredients are non toxic and listed in USP/NF/ Apart from this the gel is fortified with flavours, flavour enchancers and attractants which specifically attracts shrimps, prawn and fish. The addition of flavours ensure maximum uptake of feed, reduce pond fouling and mask medication and other less palatable raw materials, which can otherwise reduce intake. By maximum feed and medicaments consumption, wastage will be negligible and the bottom of the pond will be clear.<br><br>
The composition in water is present at a level of from about 10-80% by weight. The polymer is present at a level of from about 2.5-5%. The composition has a pH value of from about 6.5 to 8. The cellulose is present at the level of about 2-5%. The composition has a viscosity in the range of 10,000 to 25,000 cP.<br>
The composition contains Vitamin E-50% powder vrith Vitamin E in the range of 0.25%-2.5% and Selenium yeast/sodium selenite liquid - 50% of which selenium is in the range of 100 ppm-2000 ppm and probiotics in the range of 30-50 g/Kg of feed. The composition may have Vitamin-C (coated/non coated) in the range 0.5%-12%. Further the composition may contain herbal extracts like tuisi, Phyllanthus niruri, Tephrosia purpurea, Andrographis paniculata, Tinospora cordifolia, Eclipta alba &amp; Piper longum in the range 0.05%-2.5%. The composition may also contain chlorohydroxyquinoline in the range 0.05%-2.5%. and Colistin sulphate USP in the range of 0.05%-!% and Doxycycline hydrochloride IP in the range 0.25%-2.5%<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
The stability of this gel, which is used for top dressing of feed, could be enhanced by the use of preservatives. Sodium methyl/propyl paraben/sodium benzoate^ronopol at the level of 0.01% to 1% by weight. The pH value is adjusted if necessary to pH 4.5 to 8.5. The preferred range of pH can be adjusted with mild bases such astriethanol amine or ammonia.<br><br>
The composition of this invention is readily prepared by mixing the polymer and cellulose and slowly adding the flavour. Stirring should be done until the polymer and cellulose completely disperses. The pH is the adjusted if necessary to the desired range.<br>
The composition of this invention could be easily blended onto the fed with the added feed additive and medicaments. The composition is also stable over wide temperature range, having acceptable tolerance and is satisfactory from a physical and chemical stability standpoint. The primary application is on topdressing for the fish feed.<br><br>
NOVEL FEATURES OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	The gel based formulation is compatible with normal medicaments and other feed additives.<br>
2.	It carries a natural attractant-which reaches sensory organs of aquatic species-thereby assuring complete consumption of feed.<br>
3.<br>
It has a very good flow property-which helps in homogenous mixing of medicaments or other additives even with simple hand mixing. It forms a uniform coating on the feed pellets assuring even distribution of medicaments on feed.<br><br>
4.	It dries up faster, once coated on the feed pellets thereby avoiding use of conventional driers. A quick dyring character does not soak the pellet which otherwise reduces the water stability.<br>
5.	It holds the medicaments onto feed with negligible leaching effect, rendering maximum benefit to the aquatic species.<br>
ADVANTAGES OVER OTHER KNOWN ALTERNATIVES<br>
1.	Free flowing with excellent mixing characteristics.<br>
2.	Has a better drying capability under optimum conditions.<br>
3.	The dried gel matrix doesn't allow the value added content to leach out in water in aquaculture ponds, thereby resulting in the delivery of correct dosages desired by the aqua culturist.<br>
4.	Has an aquatic species attractant, which is a naturally derived product.<br><br>
