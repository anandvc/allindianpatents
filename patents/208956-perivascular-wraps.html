TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to penvascular wtaps, and generally to compositions and methods for improving and maintaining she integrity of body passageways or cavities following surgery or injury, and more specifically, to compositions that include therapeutic agents which may be delivered to body passageways or cavities for the purpose of preventing and/or reducing a proliferative biological response that may obstruct or hinder the optimal functioning of the passageway or cavity.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Each year, thousands of people lose the ability to deliver sufficient blood to various limbs of the body. When blood vessels do fail, natural or artificial grafts may be used to restore vessel function. For example patients who must undergo chronic injections or puncturing of their blood vessels may ultimately have the insulted blood vessel(s) die (e.g., patient's suffering from end-stage renal failure require hemodialysis and multiple injections or punctures). Many artificial grafts, sum as expanded polytctrafluoroethylenc (ePTFE) or DacronÂ® (polyethylene tcrephthakue), have been designed to act, and have been used, as a replacement blood conduit. Hence, nerdlcs or other medical devices may be repeatedly used on an on-going basis to penetrate a graft without causing the death of a blood vessel.<br>
Although these graft have been used successfully for many years, many fail for a variety of reasons. For example, thrombus formation may arise from reduced blood flow due to intimal hyperplasia. which occurs at the venous anastomosis (i.e., at the blood vessel-graft attachment site). The thrombus arising from intimal hypcrplasia may result in graft occlusion and graft failure. Factors thought to contribute to the occurrence of intimal hypcrplasia include, for example, changes in blood flow hemodynamics along with damage to the vessel cndothclium, compliance differenccs between the graft and the blood vessel, and changes in blood vessel stress. The development of intimal hyperplasia arising from an arterio-venous bypass graft placemen; is only one of many examples whereby intimal hypcrplasia may occur following device placement.<br>
To increase the patency of these devices, a method of reducing the degree of intimal hypcrplasia is required. In this regard, several systemic pharmacotherapies have been<br>
1<br><br>
tried.  For example, pharmacotherapeutic regimes have included systemic-anti-platelet therapies, such as aspirin and heparin. While these treatments have demonstrated some degree . of efficacy in reducing intimnl hypcrplasia in animal models, no efficacy has been demonstrated in clinical studies. Methods of local drug delivery to the inside of the vessel have also Allied lo producey in the clinc.<br>
There exists need in the arl for improved compositions and methods for improving or maintaining the integrity of body passageways or cavities. The present invention addicsscs the problem associated with the existing procedures, offers signifimayt advantages over existing procedures,and provides other related advantages.<br>

and veins, lacrimal ducts, the trachea, bronchi, bronchiole, nasal passages (including the sinuses) and other airways, eustachian tubes, the external auditory mayal, oral cavities, the esophagus, the stomach, the duodenum, the small intestine, the large intestine, biliary tracts, the ureter, the bladder, the urethra, the fallopian tubes, uterus, vagina and other passageways of the female reproductive tract, the vas deferens and other passageways of the male reproductive tract, and the ventricular system (cerebrospinal fluid) of the brain and the spinal cord.<br>
"Body cavity" as used herein refers to any of number of hollow spaces within the body. Representative examples of cavities include, for example, the abdominal cavity, the buccal cavity, the peritoneal cavity, the pericardial cavity, the pelvic cavity, perivisceral cavity, pleural cavity, inguinal mayal and uterine cavity.<br>
"Therapeutic agent" as used herein refers to those agents which may mitigate, treat, cure or prevent (e.g., as a prophylactic agent) a given disease or condition. Representative examples of therapeutic agents are discussed in more detail below, and include, for example, microtubule stabilizing agents, anti-angiogenic agents, cell cycle inhibitors, antithrombotic agents, antiplatelet agents, anti-inflammatory agents as well as cytokines and other factors involved in the wound healing or proliferation cascade. Briefly, within the context of the present invention, anti-angiogenic agents should be understood to include any protein, peptide, chemical, or other molecule, which acts to inhibit vascular growth (see. e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,994,341, 5,886,026, and 5,716,981).<br>
Any concentration or other numerical ranges recited herein are to be understood to include concentrations of any integer within the range and fractions thereof, such as one tenth and one hundredth of an integer, unless otherwise indicated. It should be understood that the terms "a" and "an" as used above and elsewhere herein refer to "one or more" of the enumerated components. As used herein, the term "about" means Â± 15% of an indicated value.<br>
As noted above, the present invention relates generally to delivery devices, compositions, and methods for improving the integrity of body passageways following surgery or injury, that includes delivering to an external portion of the body passageway (i.e., a non-luminal surface), a composition that includes a therapeutic agent, and within preferred embodiments, either a polymer alone or a composition including a therapeutic agent (with or without a polymeric carrier). Briefly, delivery of a therapeutic agent to an external portion of<br>
10<br><br>
a body passageway (e.g., quadrantically or circumferentially) avoids many of the disadvantages of traditional approaches. In addition, delivery of a therapeutic agent as described herein allows the administration of greater quantities of the therapeutic agent with less constraint upon the volume to be delivered. For example, in embodiments in which the therapeutic agent has been incorporated into or coated onto a mesh material, the device may deliver a therapeutically effective amount of the drug in a low total volume of material, thereby reducing the amount of polymer that is released into the body upon degradation.<br>
In one aspect, the devices and compositions of the present invention are sterile. Many pharmaceuticals are manufactured to be sterile and this criterion is defined by the USP XXII . Sterilization in this embodiment may be accomplished by a number of means accepted in the industry and listed in the USP XXII , including gas sterilization, ionizing radiation, thermal treatments or filtration. Sterilization may be maintained by what is termed asceptic processing, defined also in USP XXII . Acceptable gases used for gas sterilization include ethylene oxide. Acceptable radiation types used for ionizing radiation methods include gamma, for instance from a cobalt 60 source, and electron beam. A typical dose of gamma radiation is 2.5 MRad. When appropriate, filtration may be accomplished using a filter with suitable pore size, for example 0.22 um and of a suitable material, for instance Teflon.<br>
The therapeutic agents, therapeutic devices or compositions and pharmaceutical devices or compositions provided herein may be placed within one or more containers, along with packaging material that provide instructions regarding the use of such materials. These containers may or may not contain a dessimayt. Generally, such instructions include a tangible expression describing the reagent concentration, as well as within certain embodiments, relative amounts of excipient ingredients or diluents (e.g., water, saline or PBS) that may be necessary to reconstitute the pharmaceutical composition. The containers and contents therein may also be sterile.<br>
Within yet another aspect of the invention, pharmaceutical devices, products, or compositions are provided, that includes (a) a therapeutic agent and a biodegradable polymer, wherein at least some of the biodegradable polymer is in the form of a mesh, in a ) container, and (b) a notice associated with the container in form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the manufacture, use, or sale of devices or pharmaceuticals, which notice is reflective of approval by the agency of a device or compound that, for example, disrupts<br>
11<br><br>
microtubule function or is anti-angiogenic or is anti-proliferative or is immunosuppressive and the like, for human or veterinary administration to treat non-tumorigenie angiogenesis-dependent diseases such as, for example, inflammatory arthritis or neovascular diseases of the eye. Briefly, Federal Law requires that the use of a pharmaceutical agent in the therapy of humans be approved by an agency of the Federal government. Responsibility for enforcement (in the United States) is with the Food and Drug Administration, which issues appropriate regulations for securing such approval, detailed in 21 U.S.C. Â§Â§301-392. Regulation for biological materials that include products made from the tissues of animals, is also provided under 42 U.S.C. Â§ 262. Similar approval is required by most countries, although, regulations may vary from country to country.<br>
A wide variety of therapeutic agents may be delivered to external portions of body passageways or cavities, either with or without a carrier (eg, polymeric or non-polymeric), in order to treat or prevent a condition associated with the body passageway or cavity. Discussed in more detail below are: I) Therapeutic Agents, II) Device Compositions, and III) Treatment or Prevention of Compromised Body Passageway or Cavity.<br>
I. THERAPEUTIC AGENTS<br>
A wide variety of agents (also referred to herein as 'therapeutic agents' or 'drugs*) may be utilized within the context of the present invention, either with or without a carrier (e.g., a polymer; see section II below).   Therapeutic drugs may include but are not limited to those agents which inhibit some or all of the processes involved in the development of intimal hyperplasia, such as cell proliferation, cell migration and matrix deposition. Agents in   this   category   include   cell   cycle   inhibitors   and/or   anti-angiogenic   agents,   e.g., anthracyclines,  fucoidon,  and taxanes, certain  immunosuppressive  compounds  such  as sirolimus and analogues, and derivatives, certain nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents such as   dexamethasone  and   analogues   and  derivatives,   certain   antibiotic   agents   such   as dactinomycin and analogues, and derivatives, certain statins such as cervistatin and analogues and derivatives, and certain estrogens such as 17-p-estradiol and analogues and derivatives. Furthermore, antithrombotic agents and antiplatelet agents may be used.  Discussed in more detail below are (A) anthracyclines (e.g., doxorubicin and mitoxantrone), (B) taxanes (e.g., paclitaxel and docetaxol), (C) sirolimus analogues. (D) antibiotic agents (e.g., dactinomycin) , (E) statins (e.g., cervistatin), and (F) estrogens (e.g., 17-p-cstradiol).<br>

Alternatively, R5 and R$ are hydrogen and R7 and Rj are alkyl or halogen, or vice versa.<br>
According to U.S. Patent 5,843,903, Ri may be a conjugated peptide. According to U.S. Patent 4,296,105, R5 may be an ether linked alkyl group. According to U.S. Patent 4,215,062, R5 may be OH or an ether linked alkyl group. Rj may also be linked to the anthracyclinc ring by a group other than C(O), such as an alkyl or branched alkyl group having the C(O) linking moiety at its end, such as -CH2CH(CH2-X)C(O)-Ri, wherein X is H or an alkyl group (see, e.g., U.S. Patent 4,215,062). R2 may alternately be a group linked by the functional group =N-NHC(O)-Y, where Y is a group such as a phenyl or substituted phenyl ring. Alternately R3 may have the following structure:<br><br>
in which R9 is OH either in or out of the plane of the ring, or is a second sugar moiety such as R3. Rio may be H or form a secondary amine with a group such as an aromatic group, saturated or partially saturated 5 or 6 numbered heterocyclic having at least one ring nitrogen (see U.S. Patent 5,843,903). Alternately, Rio may be derived from an amino acid, having the structure -C(O)CH(NHRn)(Ri2), in which Ru is H, or forms a C3J membered alkylenc with Rj2.

B. Taxanes<br>
In another aspect, the therapeutic agent is a taxane, or a derivative or an analog thereof. Briefly, taxanes such as, for example, paclitaxel, are compounds that disrupt mitosis (M-phasc) by binding to tubulin to form abnormal mitotic spindles.<br>
The taxane paclitaxel is a highly derivatized ditcrpenoid (Wani et aiy J. Am. Chem. Soc. 93:2325, 1971) which has been obtained from the harvested and dried bark of Taxus brevifolia (Pacific Yew) and Taxomyces Andreanae and Endophytic Fungus of the Pacific Yew (Stierle et al, Science 60:214-216, 1993). It has been formulated into commercial compositions, including the product TAXOLÂ®. Analogs and derivatives of paclitaxel include, for example, commercial products such as TAXOTEREÂ®, as well as compounds such as docetaxel, 10-dcsacetyI analogues of paclitaxel and 3'N-desbenzoyl-3fN-t-butoxy carbonyl analogues of paclitaxel) (see generally Schiff et ai, Nature 277:665-667,<br>

A wide variety of forms may be fashioned by the polymer and carriers of the present invention, including for example, coatings, threads, braids, knitted or woven sheets, tubes and rod-shaped devices, (see, e.g., Goodell et al., Am. J. Hosp. Pharm. 45:1454-1461, 1986; Langer et al., "Controlled release of macromolecules from polymers", in Biomedical polymers. Polymeric materials and pharmaceuticals for biomedical use, Goldberg, E.P., Nakagim, A. (eds.) Academic Press, pp. 113-137, 1980; Rhine et al., J. Pharm. Set 69:265-270, 1980; Brown et al.y J. Pharm. Sci. 72:1181, 1983; and Bawa et al., J. Controlled Release 7:259, 1985). Therapeutic agents may be incorporated into the device by, for example, occlusion in the polymer or in the void volume of a mesh material, dissolution in the polymer matrix, coating onto, and by binding the agent(s) to the device via covalent or non-covalcnt linkages.    The therapeutic agents may be incorporated into a secondary carrier (e.g.,<br>
30<br><br>
microparticles, microspheres, nanospheres, micelles, liposomes and/or emulsions) that is then incorporated into the primary carrier as described above. Within certain preferred embodiments of the invention, therapeutic compositions are provided in formulations such as knitted or woven meshes, pastes, sheets, films, particulates, tubes, gels, foams, braids, and sprays.<br>
Preferably, therapeutic devices or compositions of the present invention are fashioned in a manner appropriate to the intended use. For example, a therapeutic agent and biodegradable polymer are formed into a mesh or wrap for application to a venous or arterial anastomosis, preferably on the external portion of the anastomosis. Within certain aspects of the present invention, the therapeutic device or composition should be biocompatible, and release one or more therapeutic agents over a period of several days to months with the specific release profile being appropriate for the specific indication being treated. Further, therapeutic compositions of the present invention should preferably be stable for several<br>
months and capable of being produced and maintained under sterile conditions.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, a delivery device is provided that includes a<br>
therapeutic agent and a biodegradable polymer, wherein at least some of the biodegradable polymer is in the form of a mesh. A mesh, as used herein, is a material composed of a plurality of fibers or filaments (i.e., a fibrous material), where the fibers or filaments are arranged in such a manner (e.g., interwoven, knotted, braided, overlapping, looped, knitted, interlaced, intertwined, webbed, felted, and the like) so as to form a porous structure. Typically, a mesh is a pliable material, such that it has sufficient flexibility to be* wrapped around the external surface of a body passageway or cavity, or a portion thereof. The mesh is capable of providing support to the structure (e.g., the vessel or cavity wall) and may be adapted to release an amount of the therapeutic agent.<br>
A mesh may include fibers or filaments that are randomly oriented relative to each other or that are arranged in an ordered array or pattern. In one embodiment, for example, a mesh may be in the form of a fabric, such as, for example, a knitted, braided, crocheted, woven, non-woven (e.g., a melt-blown or wet-laid) or webbed fabric. In one embodiment, a mesh may include a natural or synthetic biodegradable polymer that may be ) formed into a knit mesh, a weave mesh, a sprayed mesh, a web mesh, a braided mesh, a looped mesh, and the like. Preferably, a mesh or wrap has intertwined threads that form a porous structure, which may be, for example, knitted, woven, or webbed. Representative examples of meshes include surgical meshes, such as those commercially available from<br>
31<br><br>
Ethicon, Inc. (Somerville, NJ) under the trade designation VICRYL knitted mesh, VICRYL woven mesh, Prolene mesh, Mersilene Mesh, and those available from CR Bard (Murray Hill, NJ) under the trade designation BardÂ® VisilexÂ® Mesh, BardÂ® Dulexâ¢ Mesh, and BardÂ® Mesh Flat Sheets.<br>
The structure and properties of the mesh used in a device depend on the application and the desired mechanical (i.e., flexibility, tensile strength, and elasticity), degradation properties, and the desired loading and release characteristics for the selected therapeutic agent(s). The mesh should have mechanical properties, such that the device will remain sufficiently strong until the surrounding tissue has healed. Factors that affect the flexibility and mechanical strength of the mesh include, for example, the porosity, fabric thickness, fiber diameter, polymer composition (e.g., type of monomers and initiators), process conditions, and the additives that are used to prepare the material.<br>
Typically, the delivery device includes a mesh that possesses sufficient porosity to permit the flow of fluids through the pores of the fiber network and to facilitate tissue ingrowth.   Generally, the interstices of the mesh or wrap should be sufficiently wide apart to allow light visible by eye, or fluids, to pass through the pores.  However, materials having a more compact structure also may be used. The flow of fluid through the interstices of the mesh depends on a variety of factors, including, for example, the stitch count or thread density.    The porosity of the mesh may be further tailored by, for example, filling the interstices of the mesh with another material (e.g., particles or polymer) or by processing the mesh (e.g., by heating) in order to reduce the pore size and to create non-fibrous areas. Fluid flow through the mesh or wrap of the invention will vary depending on the properties of the fluid, such as viscosity, hydrophilicity/hydrophobicity, ionic concentration, temperature, elasticity, pseudoplasticity, particulate content, and the like. Preferably, the interstices do not prevent the release of impregnated or coated therapeutic agent(s) from the mesh, and the interstices preferably do not prevent the exchange of tissue fluid at the application site.<br>
Mesh materials should be sufficiently flexible so as to be capable of being wrapped around all or a portion of the external surface of a body passageway or cavity. Flexible mesh materials are typically in the form of flexible woven or knitted sheets having a thickness ranging from about 25 microns to about 3000 microns; preferably from about 50 to about 1000 microns. Mesh material suitable for wrapping around arteries and veins typically ranges from about 100 to 400 microns in thickness.<br>
The diameter and length of the fibers or filaments may range in size depending on the form of the material (e.g., knit, woven, or non-woven), and the desired elasticity,<br>
32<br><br>
porosity, surface area, flexibility, and tensile strength. The fibers may. be of any length, ranging from short filaments to long threads (i.e., several microns to hundreds of meters in length). Depending on the application, the fibers may have a monofilament or a multifilament construction.<br>
The mesh may include fibers that are of same dimension or of different dimensions, and the fibers may be formed from the same or different types of biodegradable polymers. Woven materials, for example, may include a regular or irregular array of warp and weft strands and may include one type of polymer in the weft direction and another type (having the same or a different degradation profile from the first polymer) in the warp direction. Similarly, knit materials may include one or more types (e.g., monofilament, multi-filament) and sizes of fibers and may include fibers made from the same or from different types of biodegradable polymers.<br>
The structure of the mesh (e.g., fiber density and porosity) may impact the amount of therapeutic agent that may be loaded into the device. For example, a fabric having a loose weave characterized by a low fiber density and high porosity will have a lower thread count, resulting in a reduced total fiber volume and surface area. As a result, the amount of agent that may be loaded into or onto, with a fixed carrier: therapeutic agent ratio, the fibers will be lower than for a fabric having a high fiber density and lower porosity. It is preferable that the mesh also should not invoke biologically detrimental inflammatory or toxic response, should be capable of being fully metabolized in the body, have an acceptable shelf life, and be easily sterilized.<br>
The delivery device may include multiple mesh materials in any combination or arrangement. For example, a portion of the device may be a knitted material and another portion may be a woven material. In another embodiment, the device may more than one layer (e.g., a layer of woven material fused to a layer of knitted material or to another layer of the same type or a different type of woven material). In some embodiments, multi-layer constructions (e.g., device having two or more layers of material) may be used, for example, to enhance the performance properties of the device (e.g. for enhancing the rigidity or for altering the porosity, elasticity, or tensile strength of the device) or for increasing the amount i    of drug loading.<br>
Multi-layer constructions may be useful, for example, in devices containing more than one type of therapeutic agent. For example, a first layer of mesh material may be loaded with one type of agent and a second layer may be loaded with another type of agent. The two layers may be unconnected or connected (e.g., fused together, such as by heat<br>
33<br><br>
welding or ultrasonic welding) and may be formed of the same type .of fabric or from a different type of fabric having a different polymer composition and/or structure.<br>
Preferably, the device, including the therapeutic agent as an integral part of the device or coated on the device, has a form useful for application to an external or internal portion of a body passageway or cavity to treat or prevent a condition leading to reduced integrity of such passageways or cavities.<br>
In certain aspects, a mesh may include portions that are not in the form of a mesh. For example, the device may include the form of a film, sheet, paste, and the like, and combinations thereof. Within yet other aspects of the invention, the therapeutic compositions of the present invention may be formed as a film. Preferably, such films are generally less than 5, 4, 3, 2, or 1, mm thick, more preferably less than 0.75 mm or 0.5 mm thick, and most preferably less than 500 um to 20 urn thick. Such films are preferably flexible with an appropriate tensile strength. Within certain embodiments of the invention, the therapeutic compositions may also comprise additional ingredients such as surfactants (e.g., Pluronicsâ¢ such as F-127, L-122, L-92, L-81, and L-61), anti-oxidants [e.g. vitamin E], and hydrating agents [e.g. maltose trehelose, poly(ethylene glycol)].<br>
In one embodiment, the device includes a multi-layer construction having a<br>
film layer that includes the therapeutic agent and one or more layers of mesh material.  For<br>
example, the film layer may be interposed between two layers of mesh or may be disposed on<br>
just one side the mesh material. The film layer may include a first therapeutic agent, whereas<br>
one or more of the layers of mesh may include the same or a different agent. For example, in<br>
one embodiment, a device suitable for wrapping around a vein or artery includes a layer of<br>
mesh and a film layer loaded with a therapeutic agent. The device may be wrapped around a<br>
body passageway or cavity, such that the film layer contacts the external surface of the<br>
passageway or cavity. Thus, the device may deliver the appropriate dosage of agent and may<br>
provide sufficient mechanical strength to improve and maintain the structural integrity of the<br>
body passageway or cavity.<br>
In certain aspects, a mesh may include other components, such as other biological agents or non-biodegradable agents or polymers. Examples of additional components include antibiotic and antimicrobial agents, waxes, radio-opaque or echogenic materials and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) responsive materials (i.e., MRI contrast agents) to enable visualization of the device under ultrasound, fluoroscopy and/or MRI. For example, a delivery device may be made with or coated with a composition which is<br>
echogenic or radiopaque (e.g., made with echogenic or radiopaque with materials such as<br>
34<br><br>
powdered tantalum, tungsten, barium carbonate, bismuth oxide, barium- sulfate, or, by the addition of microspheres or bubbles which present an acoustic interface). For visualization under MR], contrast agents (e.g., Gadolinium (HI) chelates or iron oxide compounds) may be incorporated into the device, such as, for example, as a component in a coating or within the void volume of the device (e.g., within a lumen, reservoir, or within the structural material used to form the device).<br>
As noted above, the polymer and carrier compositions of the present invention may be formulated in a variety of forms to produce a delivery device suitable for application to the outside surface of a body passageway or cavity. Further, the compositions of the present invention may be formulated to contain one or more therapeutic agent(s), to contain a variety of additional compounds, and/or to have certain physical properties (e.g., elasticity, a particular melting point or a specified release rate). Within certain embodiments of the invention, compositions may be combined in order to achieve a desired effect (e.g., several preparations of microspheres may be combined in order to achieve both a quick and a slow or prolonged release of one or more factors).<br>
The compositions of the present invention may be administered in combination with other therapeutic agents, phannaceutically or physiologically acceptable carrier, excipients or diluents.<br>
In one embodiment, the composition of the invention is in the form of a knitted or woven mesh. One or more therapeutic agents may be incorporated into the mesh using several different methods. In one embodiment, the therapeutic agent may be incorporated directly in the polymeric material this is used to produce the mesh. For example, the therapeutic agent may be admixed into a melt-processable composition that includes the biodegradable polymer.     Using standard melt-processing techniques,  fiber including a therapeutic agent may be prepared. These fibers may be used to prepare the desired mesh. In another embodiment, the therapeutic agent may be coated directly onto or absorbed into the polymeric thread/yarn that is used to prepare the mesh. In another embodiment, the therapeutic agent may be incorporated into a carrier composition that is then coated onto the polymeric thread/yarn that is used to produce the mesh.    In another embodiment, the \    therapeutic agent may be coated onto or absorbed directly into the polymer that has already been knitted or woven into a mesh form. In another embodiment, the therapeutic agent may be incorporated into a carrier composition that is then coated onto the polymer that has already been knitted or woven into a mesh form.    The therapeutic agent or the therapeutic agent/carrier composition may be applied using the various coating methods that are known in<br>
35<br><br>
the art (e.g., dip coating, spray coating, solvent casting, extrusion, roll coating, etc.)- In some embodiments, the therapeutic agent may be attached directly to the fibers (e.g., by physisorption, chemisorption, ligand/receptor interaction, covalent bonds, hydrogen bonds, ionic bonds, and the like). The fibers (either before or after incorporation into the mesh), optionally, may be pre-treatcd prior to application of the therapeutic agent to enhance adhesion and/or to introduce reactive sites for attaching the drug or an intermediate (eg., a linker) to the material. Surface treatment techniques are well known in the art and include, for example, applying a priming solution, plasma treatment, corona treatment, radiation treatment and surface hydrolysis, oxidation or reduction.<br>
The instant invention also provides methods of making the devices and compositions including a therapeutic agent and a biodegradable polymer, wherein at least some of the biodegradable polymer is in the form of a mesh.   In one embodiment, there is provided a method of producing a delivery device, including (a) contacting a therapeutic agent and a biodegradable polymer, under conditions and for a time sufficient for the therapeutic agent and biodegradable polymer to form a solid, and (b) weaving or knitting the solid into a delivery device. The biodegradable polymer of step (a) may be in a viscous form or a liquid form. In another embodiment, a preferred method of producing a delivery device, includes (a) contacting a biodegradable polymer and a therapeutic agent, wherein at least some of the biodegradable polymer is in the form of a mesh, and (b) placing the biodegradable polymer mesh and therapeutic agent under conditions and for a time sufficient for the mesh to form a solid delivery device.    In yet another preferred embodiment, a delivery device may be produced by coating a biodegradable polymer with a therapeutic agent, wherein at least some of the biodegradable polymer is in the form of a mesh. Preferably the polymer mesh is coated by painting, dipping, or spraying, and the coat is in the form of a surface adherent coating, film, wrap, gel, foam, and the like.<br>
In one embodiment, the polymer used to prepare the knitted or woven mesh includes a biodegradable polymer, as discussed herein. The preferred biodegradable polymer is one that may be spun into a yarn that may then be knitted or woven into a mesh using the various techniques known in the art. Fibers having dimensions appropriate for preparing knit and woven fabrics may be made using standard melt-processing techniques, such as injection molding, compression molding, extrusion, electrospiruling, melt spinning, solution spinning and gel state spinning. In other embodiments, the mesh is a random, non-woven network of<br>
36<br><br>
fibers or filaments. Non-woven materials may be prepared, for example, by melt-blowing, wet-laying, or electro spinning the biodegradable polymer into the form of a fabric. Techniques for preparing biodegradable melt-blown fabrics are well known to those skilled in the art and are described, for example, in Wadsworth L., et al., "Melt Processing of PLA Resin into Nonwovens", 3rd Annual TANDEC Conference, Knoxville, 1993 and U.S. Patent No. 5,702,826.<br>
The delivery device may provide controlled, sustained release of the therapeutic agent. Following implantation, the therapeutic agent is released from the biodegradable polymer as the polymer is degraded in the body. The rate of degradation depends on a variety of factors, such as the chemical composition, crystallinity, porosity, and wettability of the polymer. Examples of biodegradable polymers include biodegradable polyester and copolymers formed from lactide (e.g., L-Lactide) and glycolide. Preferably, poly(lactide-co-glycolide) polymers have a lactide / glycolide molar ratio between about 100/0 and about 2/98; preferably between about 15/85 and about 3/97; and most preferably between about 10/90 and about 3/97.<br>
In one embodiment, the therapeutic agent may be incorporated into a carrier that is a polymer. The preferred polymeric carrier is a biodegradable polymer, such as a poly(ester) or a poty(ester)-poly(ether) copolymer. Preferred poly(ester) polymers are prepared from one or more hydroxy acids (e.g., lactic acid, glycolic acid etc) or hydroxyl acid derivatives (e.g., lactide, glycolide, caprolactone, etc.)- The preferred hydroxyl acid derivatives are lactide and glycolide. The preferred carrier polymer has a lactide:glycolide molar ratio of about 85:15 to about 15:85. The more preferred carrier polymer has a lactide:glycolide molar ratio of about 85:15 to about 40:60.<br>
The preferred poly(ester)-poly(ether) copolymer includes a diblock (A-B) or triblock (A-B-A, B-A-B) copolymer in which the block comprise either a poly(ester) or a poly(ether). U.S. Patent Nos. 5,612,052; 5,714,159; and 6,413,539 describe the preparation of poly(ester)-poly(ether) polymers. The preferred poly(ether) block includes a polyalkylene oxide. The preferred polyalkylene oxide includes po!y(ethylene glycoi) or poly(ethylene oxide). The preferred poly (ester) block is prepared from one or more hydroxy acids (e.g., lactic acid, glycolic acid etc) or hydroxy acid derivatives (e.g., lactide, glycolide, caprolactone etc). The preferred hydroxyl acid derivatives are lactide and glycolide. The preferred carrier polymer has a !actide:glycolide molar ratio of about 100:0 to about 15:85. The more preferred<br>
37<br><br>
carrier polymer has a lactide:glycolidc molar ratio of about 100:0 to about 40:60. The most preferred lactide:glycolide molar ratio is about 100:0. The preferred lactide isomer is D,L-lactide.<br>
A preferred carrier diblock is an A-B diblock copolymer wherein the A block includes methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) [MePEG] and the B block includes a poly(lactide). The methoxy poly(ethylcne glycol) [MePEG] may have a molecular weight (Mn) in the range of about 200 g/mol to about 20,000 g/mol. The more preferred methoxy poly(ethylene glycol) may have a molecular weight (Mn) in the range of about 500 g/mol to about 2000 g/mol. The most preferred methoxy poly(ethylenc glycol) may have a molecular weight (Mn) of about 750 g/mol. The poly(lactide) may have a molecular weight in the range of about 200 g/mol to about 10,000 g/mol. The more preferred molecular weight range for the poly(lactide) block is from about 500 g/mol to about 5000 g/mol.<br>
A preferred carrier A-B diblock copolymer has a MePEGrlactide ratio (weight/weight) in the range of about 5:95 to about 40:60. The more preferred carrier A-B diblock copolymer has a MePEG:lactide ratio (weight/weight) in the range of about 10:90 to about 30:70. The most preferred carrier A-B diblock copolymer has a MePEG:lactide ratio (weight/weight) of about 20:80.<br>
The therapeutic agent may be incorporated into the carrier using methods known in the art, such as addition of a solvent with subsequent removal of the solvent, dissolution of a therapeutic agent directly into the carrier and blending the therapeutic agent with the carrier. The methods used for incorporation of the therapeutic agent into the non-polymeric carrier are similar to those used to incorporate the therapeutic agent into the polymeric carrier, as described above.<br>
The compositions may be sterile either by preparing them under an aseptic environment and/or they may be terminally sterilized using methods available in the art. A combination of both of these methods may also be used to prepare the composition in the sterile form. The most preferable method of sterilization is a terminal sterilization using gamma radiation or electron beam sterilization methods.<br>
In one embodiment, the composition may be packaged in a container. This container may comprise a polymer or a metal foil or a paper product or a combination of these. When the polymers used are polymers that degrade via hydrolysis, the composition may be packaged in a container that reduces the amount of water absorption by the product<br>
38<br><br>
compared to the composition that  is not packaged  in such a container.     In another<br>
embodiment, the container in which the composition is packaged may contain a desicmayt. In<br>
another embodiment the container packaged composition may be packaged in a secondary<br>
container that is more resistant to moisture permeation than the first or primary container of<br>
the composition.   In another embodiment, a desicmayt may be placed between the primary<br>
and secondary container.   Properties of a container that may be important acceptable light<br>
transmission characteristics in order to prevent light energy from damaging the composition in<br>
the container (refer to USP XXII ), an acceptable limit of cxtractables within the<br>
container material (refer to USP XXII), an acceptable barrier capacity for moisture (refer to<br>
USP XXII ) or oxygen.   In the case of oxygen penetration, this may be controlled by<br>
including in the container, a positive pressure of an inert gas, such as high purity nitrogen, or a<br>
noble gas, such as argon.  The term "USP" refers to U.S. Pharmacopeia (see www.usp.org,<br>
Rbckville, MD).<br>
As discussed in more detail below, therapeutic agents of the present invention, which are optionally incorporated within one of the carriers described herein to form a therapeutic composition, may be prepared and utilized to treat or prevent a wide variety of conditions.<br>
III. TREATMENT OR PREVENTION OF COMPROMISED BODY PASSAGEWAY OR CAVITY<br>
As noted above, the present invention relates generally to compositions and methods for improving the integrity of body passageways or cavities following surgery or injury, and more specifically, to compositions that include therapeutic agents which may be delivered to the external walls of body passageways or cavities for the purpose of preventing and/or reducing a proliferative biological response that may obstruct or hinder the optimal functioning of the passageway or cavity, including, for example, iatrogenic complications of arterial and venous catheterization, aortic dissection, cardiac rupture, aneurysm, cardiac valve dehiscence, graft placement (e.g. A-V-bypass, peripheral bypass, CABG), fistula formation, passageway rupture and surgical wound repair.<br>
In certain embodiments, preferred methods for improving or maintaining a body passageway lumen or cavity includes delivering to an external portion of the body passageway or cavity a delivery device as described herein, for treating or preventing<br>
39<br><br>
iatrogenic complications of arterial and venous catheterization, complications of vascular dissection, complications of gastrointestinal passageway rupture and dissection, complications associated with vascular surgery, and the like. Exemplary body passageways for use of the instant invention include arteries, veins, the heart, the esophagus, the stomach, the duodenum, the small intestine, the large intestine, biliary tracts, the ureter, the bladder, the urethra, lacrirnal ducts, the trachea, bronchi, bronchiole, nasal airways, eustachian tubes, the external auditory mayal, vas deferens and fallopian tubes. Exemplary cavities for use of the instant invention include the abdominal cavity, the buccal cavity, the peritoneal cavity, the pericardia! cavity, the pelvic cavity, perivisceral cavity, pleural cavity and uterine cavity.<br>
In order to further the understanding of such conditions, representative complications leading to a compromised body passageway or cavity integrity are discussed in more detail below.<br>
Cardiac Bypass Surgery<br>
Coronary artery bypass graft ("CABG") surgery was introduced in the 1950s, and still remains a highly invasive, open surgical procedure, although less invasive surgical techniques are being developed. CABG surgery is a surgical procedure that is performed to overcome many types of coronary artery blockages. The purpose of bypass surgery is to increase the circulation and nourishment to the heart muscle that has been reduced due to arterial blockage.  This procedure involves the surgeon accessing the heart and the diseased<br>
Â» arteries, usually through an incision in the middle of the chest. Often, healthy arteries or veins are "harvested" from the patient to create "bypass grafts" that channel the needed blood flow around the blocked portions of the coronary arteries. The arteries or veins are connected from the aorta to the surface of the heart beyond the blockages thereby forming an autologous graft. This allows the blood to flow through these grafts and "bypass" the narrowed or closed vessel.<br>
5 The use of synthetic graft materials to create the "bypass" has been limited due to the lack of the appropriate biocompatibility of these synthetic grafts. CABG has signifimayt short term limitations, including medical complications, such as stroke, multiple organ dysfunction, inflammatory response, respiratory failure and post-operative bleeding, each of which may result in death. Another problem associated with CABG is restenosts. Restenosis is typically<br>
0 defined as a renarrowing of an arterial blood vessel within six months of the CABG procedure. It typically occurs in approximately 25% to 45% of patients, and is the result of an<br>
excessive healing response to arterial injury after a revascularization procedure.  Restenosis<br>
40<br><br>
may occur within a short period following a procedure or may develop over the course of months or years. Longer term or " late" restenosis may result from excessive proliferation of scar tissue at the treatment site, the causes of which are not well understood. Thus any product that may reduce the incidence or magnitude of the restenotic process following CABG surgery would greatly enhance the well-being of a patient.<br>
In order to prevent the restenotic complications associated with CABG surgery, such as those discussed above, a wide variety of therapeutic agents (with or without a carrier) /polymer compositions may be delivered to the external portion of the blood vessel. The polymer or therapeutic agent/polymer composition would be applied to the external portion of the vessel following the intcrventional or surgical procedure in order to prevent the restenotic complications.<br>
Particularly preferred therapeutic agents cither alone or in combination include microtubule stabilizing agents and other cell cycle inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressive agents, antithrombotic agents, antiplatelet agents and other factors involved in the prevention or reduction of the restenotic process.<br>
Peripheral Bypass Surgery<br>
Peripheral arterial disease (PAD) refers to diseases of any of the blood vessels outside of the heart. PAD is a range of disorders that may affect the blood vessels in the hands, arms, legs, or feet. The most common form of PAD is atherosclerosis. Atherosclerosis is a gradual process in which cholesterol and scar tissue build up in the arteries to form a substance called plaque. This build -up causes a gradual narrowing of the artery, which leads to a decrease in the amount of blood flow through that artery. When the flow of blood decreases, it results in a decrease of oxygen and nutrient supply to the body's tissues, which in turn may result in pain sensation. When the arteries to the legs are affected, the most common symptom is pain in the calf when walking. This is known as intermittent claudication.<br>
Peripheral bypass surgery is a procedure to bypass an area of stenosed (narrowed) or blocked artery that is a result of atherosclerosis. In this surgical procedure, a synthetic graft (artificial blood vessels) or a-an autologous graft, vein, will be implanted to provide blood flow around the diseased area. First, the surgeon makes an incision in the leg, thigh, calf or ankle skin. The location of the incision may vary based on which vessels need to be bypassed and where there is healthy artery to connect to maintain the blood flow.   The<br>
bypass graft is sewn into the artery above the stenosis or blockage, and below the stenosis or<br>
41<br><br>
blockage. This bypass provides a means whereby blood will reach the tissue that has not been receiving enough blood and oxygen. Synthetic bypass grafts used in the legs are usually made ofePTFE.<br>
Restenosis and occlusion of bypass grafts are one of the most important problems in peripheral bypass surgery. This restenosis is caused by neointimal growth (hyperplasia) and is especially pronounced within artificial graft material. This restenosis is usually at the anastomotic site where the graft and artery are connected via a surgical procedure. The intimal tissue typically grows from the native vessel into the graft. In order to prevent the restenotic complications associated with peripheral bypass surgery, such as those discussed above, a wide variety of therapeutic agents (with or without a carrier) /polymer compositions may be delivered to the external portion of the blood vessel. The polymer or therapeutic agent/polymer composition would be applied to the external portion of the vessel/anastomotic site following the interventional or surgical procedure in order to prevent the restenotic complications.<br>
Particularly preferred therapeutic agents include microtubule stabilizing agents and other cell-cycle inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressive agents, antithrombotic agents, antiplatelet agents and other factors in which may help the prevention or reduction of the restenotic process.<br>
Arterio-Venous (AV) Fistula<br>
The arterio-venous (AV) fistula is surgically created vascular connection which allows the flow of blood from an artery directly to a vein. The AV fistula was first created by researchers for kidney failure patients who must undergo kidney dialysis.<br>
Hemodialysis requires a viable artery and vein to draw blood from and return it to the body. The repeated puncturing often either causes a vein or artery to fail or causes other complications for the patient. The AV fistula increases the amount of possible puncture sites for hemodialysis and minimizes the damage to the patient's natural blood vessels. The connection that is created between the vein and artery forms a large blood vessel that continuously supplies an increased blood flow for performing hemodialysis.<br>
Restenosis and eventual occlusion are one of the most important problems in<br>
I    the long term patency of the AV fistula.   In order to prevent the restenotic complications<br>
associated with the surgical formation of an AV fistula, a wide variety of therapeutic agents<br>
(with or without a carrier) /polymer compositions may be delivered to the external portion of<br>
42<br><br>
the blood vessel. The polymer or therapeutic agent/polymer composition would be applied to the external portion of the vessel/anastomotic site following the intcrventional or surgical procedure in order to prevent the restenotic complications.<br>
Particularly preferred therapeutic agents include alone or in combination, microtubule stabilizing agents and other cell cycle inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressive agents, antithrombotic agents, antiplatelet agents and other factors involved in the prevention or reduction of the restenotic process. The preferred composition is the therapeutic agent that is contained within a polymeric mesh.<br>
Arterio-Venous (AV) Graft Surgery<br>
The AV graft surgical procedure is used for similar application as those for the AV fistula (e.g. hemodialysis patients). For the AV graft surgery, a synthetic graft material is used to connect the artery to the vein rather that the direct connection of the artery to the vein as is the case for the AV fistula. The incidence of intimal hyperplasia, which leads to occlusion of the graft, is one of the main factors that affect the long term patency of these grafts. This intimal hyperplasia may occur at the venous anastomosis and at the floor of the vein. A product that may reduce or prevent this occurrence of intimal hyperplasia will increase the duration of patency of these grafts.  In order to reduce the occurrence of intimal hyperplasia at the venous anastomosis of an AV graft, a wide variety of therapeutic agents (with or without a carrier) /polymer compositions may be delivered to the external portion of the blood vessel. The polymer or therapeutic agent/polymer composition would be applied to the external portion of the vessel/anastomotic site following the intcrventional or surgical procedure in order to prevent the restenotic complications.<br>
Particularly preferred therapeutic agents include alone or in combination, microtubule stabilizing agents and other cell cycle inhibitors, anti-angiogenic agents, anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressive agents, antithrombotic agents, antiplatelet agents and other factors involved in the prevention or reduction of the restenotic process. The preferred composition is the therapeutic agent that is contained within a polymeric mesh.<br>
Anastomotic Closure Devices<br>
Anastomotic closure devices provide a means for rapidly repairing an anastomosis. The use of some of these devices requires an invasive surgical procedure. In one embodiment of this invention, following the use of an anastomotic closure device, the mesh<br>
43<br><br>
containing the therapeutic agent may be wrapped around the anastomosis~and the anastomotic closure device, if it is left at the surgical site.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for treating or preventing intimal hyperplasia that includes delivering to an anastomotic site a delivery device. The device includes a therapeutic agent and a biodegradable polymer, wherein at least some of the biodegradable polymer is in the form of a mesh. Exemplary anastomotic sites include venous anastomosis, arterial anastomosis, arteriovenous fistula, arterial bypass, and arteriovenous graft. Preferably, the device includes a polymer mesh with a therapeutic agent is delivered to an external portion of an anastomotic site.<br>
Transplant Applications<br>
There are many applications in which various organs in the human body fail to function in a manner to sustain the well being of the patient. When an appropriate donor organ is available, an impaired organ may be replaced by a donor organ (e.g., lung, heart, kidney etc). One of the potential complications following these transplant surgeries is the potential for stenosis to occur in the blood vessels at or near the anastomotic site between the donor and recipient vessels. For example, transplant renal artery stenosis is a complication that may occur following a kidney transplant. Transplant renal artery stenosis is when the artery from the abdominal aorta to the kidney narrows, limiting blood flow to the kidney. This may also make it difficult to keep blood pressure under control. Treatment typically involves expanding the narrowed segment using a small balloon.<br>
One method to treat this stenosis is to apply the composition of this invention around the anastomotic site (junction of the donor and recipient vessels) in a perivascular manner. In a similar manner, the composition of this invention may be applied in a peritubular manner to the exterior surfaces of the trachea and or bronchi following a lung transplant procedure. Particularly preferred therapeutic agents include alone or in combination, microtubule stabilizing agents and other cell cycle inhibitors, anti-angiogenie agents, anti-inflammatory agents, immunosuppressive agents, anti-thrombotic agents, anti-platelet agents and other factors involved in the prevention or reduction of the stenotic process.<br>
Administration<br>
)	As    noted    above,    therapeutic    agents,    therapeutic    compositions,    or<br>
pharmaceutical compositions provided herein may be prepared for administration by a variety<br>
44<br><br>
of different routes, including, for example, directly to a body passageway or cavity under direct vision {e.g., at the time of surgery or via endoscopic procedures) or via percutaneous drug delivery to the exterior (adventitial) surface of the body passageway (eg, peritubulai delivery). Other representative routes of administration include gastroscopy, ECRP and colonoscopy, which do not require full operating procedures and hospitalization&gt; but may require the presence of medical personnel.<br>
Briefly, peritubular drug delivery involves percutaneous administration of localized (often sustained release) therapeutic formulations using a needle or catheter directed via ultrasound, CT, fluoroscopic, MR1 or endoscopic guidance to the disease site. Alternatively, the procedure may be performed intra-opcratively under direct vision or with additional imaging guidance. Such a procedure may also be performed in conjunction with endovasculax procedures, such as angioplasty, athercctomy or stenting or in association with an operative arterial procedure, such as endarterectomy, vessel or graft repair or graft<br>
insertion.<br>
For example, in one embodiment, the mesh (with a therapeutic agent, such as<br>
paciitaxel) may be wrapped, either completely or partially, around an injured blood vessel {e.g.. following a surgical procedure, such as a graft insertion), a body tube (e.g., trachea), and applied to the adventitial surface of a body passageway or cavity, which would allow drug concentrations to remain elevated for prolonged periods in regions where biological activity is most needed.   For example paclitaxel may be delivered in a slow release form (e.g., via a mesh) that contains from 0.001 mg/cm2 to 5 mg/cm2 (preferably 0.03 to 0.3 mg/cm2) over a selected period of time (e.g., 1 to 120 days).  For percutaneous administration, the agent may be administered at a dosage of 0.001 mg/ml to 30 mg/ml over a period of between 1 day and 90 days.      In another embodiment, similar dose ranges may be used for sirolimus and analogues and derivatives, dactinomycin and analogues and derivatives, cervistatin and analogues and derivatives, 17-p-estradiol and analogues and derivatives, dexamethasone and analogues and derivatives, and doxorubicin and analogues and derivatives as examples of compounds from the specific groupings described above. In yet another embodiment, the mesh (with a therapeutic agent, such as paclitaxel) may be placed in the appropriate location of a body cavity or a tumor resection site. If required, the mesh may be secured to the graft or the adjacent tissue using a surgical sealant, sutures, or surgical clips.   For application at a tumor resection site, paclitaxel or other cell cycle inhibitor or microtubule stabilizing agent may be delivered in a slow release form (e.g.t via a mesh) that delivers from 0.01 mg/cm2 to<br>
45<br><br>
20 mg/cm2 mg/m2 (preferably 0.01 to 10.0 mg/cm2) over a selected period of time (e.g., 1 to 150 days).<br>
In another embodiment, the therapeutic agent may be delivered to an external portion of a body passageway or cavity, such as around an injured blood vessel (e.g., following a surgical procedure, such as a graft insertion), a body tube (e.g., trachea).   For example, the therapeutic agent may be applied to the adventitial surface of a body passageway or cavity, which would allow drug concentrations to remain elevated for prolonged periods in regions where biological activity is most needed.  For example paclitaxel may be delivered in a slow release form that contains from 0.001 mg/cm    to 5 mg/cm  (preferably 0.01 to 1.0 mg/cm ) over a selected period of time {e.g., 1 to 120 days). For percutaneous administration, the agent may be administered at a dosage of 0.001 mg/ml to 30 mg/ml over a period of between 1 day and 90 days.    In another embodiment, similar dose ranges may be used for sirolimus and analogues  and derivatives, dactinomycin and analogues and derivatives, cervistatin and analogues and derivatives, 17-p-estradiol and analogues and derivatives, dexamethasone and analogues and derivatives, and doxorubicin and analogues and derivatives as examples of compounds from the specific groupings described above. In yet another embodiment, the therapeutic agent, such as paclitaxel, may be placed in the appropriate location of a body cavity or a tumor resection site. For application at a tumor resection site, paclitaxel or other cell cycle inhibitor or microtubule stabilizing agent may be delivered in a slow release form that delivers from 0.01 mg/cm   to 20 mg/cm  mg/m   (preferably 0.01 to 10.0 mg/cm2) over a selected period of time (e.g., 1 to 150 days).<br>
In another example, a patient undergoing balloon angioplasty has a sheath inserted into an artery that is to be catheterized (e.g., femoral) and through which the guidewire and balloon angioplasty catheter will be introduced. The sheath remains in place throughout the procedure, oftentimes causing injury to the site of puncture. After the removal of the balloon angioplasty hardware, a needle would be inserted through the skin to the catheterization site and a therapeutic agent (e.g., paclitaxel impregnated into a slow release polymer) or a polymer alone could be infiltrated through the needle or catheter in a circumferential manner directly around the catheterization site. This could be performed around any artery, vein, or graft, but ideal maydidates for this intervention include procedures that require arterial and venous catheterization.<br>

EXAMPLES<br>
EXAMPLE 1 SYNTHRSIS OF POLYMER MEPEG750-PDLLA-2080 POLYMER<br>
To synthesize ihc McPEG750-PDLLA-2080 polymer, 40 g of MePEG (molecular weight = 750; Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, MO) was weighed in a 500 RB flask and 160 g of D,L-Iactide (PURASORBÂ®, PURAC, Lincolnshire, IL) was weighed in a weigh boat. Both reagents were dried under a vacuum overnight at room temperature. Then 600 mg stannous 2-ethyI-hexanoate catalyst (Sigma) was added into the RB flask containing the MePEG and a magnetic stir bar. The flask was purged with N2 (oxygen free) for 5 minutes, capped with a glass stopper, placed into an oil-bath (maintained at 135Â°C), and a magnetic stirrer was gradually turned onto setting 6 (Coming). After 30 minutes, the flask was removed from the oil-bath and was cooled to room temperature in a water bath. The D,L-Iactide was added into the flask, which was then purged with oxygen free N2 for 15 minutes, the flask was capped and again placed in the oil-bath (135 Â°C). The magnetic stirrer was turned on to a setting of 3 and the polymerization reaction was allowed to continue for at least five (5) hours. The flask was removed from the oil bath and the molten polymer poured into a glass container and allowed to cool to room temperature.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
PURIFICATION OF MEPEG750-PDLLA-2080<br>
The MePEG750-PDLLA-2080 was prepared as outlined in Example 1, then 75 g MePEG750-PDLLA-2080 was dissolved in 100 ml of ethyl acetate (Fisher, HPLC grade) in a 250 ml conical flask. The polymer was precipitated by slowly adding the solution into 900 ml isopropanol (Caledon, HPLC grade) in a 2 L conical flask while stirring. The solution was stirred for 30 minutes and the suspension cooled to 5Â°C using a cooling system. The supernatant was separated and the precipitant transferred to a 400 ml beaker. The polymer was first pre-dried in a forced-air oven at 50Â°C for 24 hours to remove the bulk of the solvent. The pre-dried polymer was then transferred to a vacuum oven (50Â°C) and further dried for 24 hours until the residual solvent was below an acceptable level. The purified polymer was stored at 2-8Â°C.<br>

EXAMPLE 3<br>
COATING OF MEPEG750-PDLLA-2080 ON A PLGA (10:90) MESH<br>
A PLGA (10/90) mesh of dimension 3x6 cm2 was washed with isopropanol (Caledon, HPLC) and dried in a forced-air oven at 50Â°C. Then 3 g MePEG750-PDLLA-2080 was dissolved in 15 ml ethyl acetate (20% solution; Fisher HPLC grade) in a 20 mL glass scintillation vial. Paclitaxel (10.13 mg) was added to the polymer solution and the paclitaxel was completely dissolved by using a vortex mixer. A mesh was coated with the polymer/paclitaxel solution by dipping into such a solution. The excess solution was then removed and the coated mesh was dried using an electric fan for 2-3 minutes. The coated mesh was placed in a PTFE petri-dish and was further dried for 60 minutes using the electric fan in a fume-hood. The coated mesh was then transferred into a vacuum oven and dried under vacuum overnight at room temperature. The dried coated mesh was packed between two pieces of release-liners (Rexam A10) and sealed in a pouch bag.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
IN VITRO RELEASE PROFILE OF PACLITAXEL FROM A MESH<br>
Mesh samples were coated with PLGA (50:50, IV=0.15dL/g) in a similar manner to that described in this example.<br>
Release Studies<br>
The release profile of paclitaxel was determined using an in-vitro release method. A portion of the mesh was sampled by cutting a sample piece, weighing the sample (approx. 5-7 mg), and placing in a screw top culture tube (16xl25mm, Kimax). Then a phosphate/albumin buffer (15 mL) was added to the culture tube. The samples were placed on a rotating disk [30 rpm, 20Â° incline] (Fisher, Plate) in an incubator (VWR, Model 1380 Forced Air Oven) that was set at 37Â°C. After a specific incubation period, the culture tubes were removed from the incubation oven, the buffer was transferred to a second culture tube using a pipette, 15 mL of a phosphate/albumin buffer was added to the original mesh sample tube and the culture tubes were returned to the rotating disk in the incubation oven. The buffer was exchanged 3 times during the initial 24 hours, exchanged daily for the next 4 days and then exchanged on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays until the release study was completed.<br>
48<br><br>
Extraction of Paclitaxel from the release buffer<br>
Dichloromethane (1 mL) was added to 14 ml of paclitaxel-containing buffer. The tubes were vigorously shaken by hand for 10 seconds and then placed on a tube rotator (Thermolyne Labquake Shaker) for 15 minutes. The samples were centriftiged at 1500 rpm for 10 min. The supernatant buffer was withdrawn from the culture tube and the samples were then placed in a heating block (Pierce, ReactiTherm/ReactiVap ) at 45Â°C. The samples were dried using a stream of nitrogen. The culture tubes that contained the dried samples were capped and placed in a -20Â°C freezer until HPLC analysis of the samples could be performed.<br>
Determination of Paclitaxel content by HPLC<br>
An acetonitrile/water solution [50:50] was added (1 mL) to the culture tube containing the dried extract. The samples were vortexed for 60 sec on a vortexer (XXX). The samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 1500 rpm. Approx. 500 uL of the supernatant was transferred to an Agilent HPLC autosampler vial. The chromatographic conditions used for the determination of the paclitaxel content were : Sotvent: water/ACN 47:53, Column: Hypersil ODS 125 x 4 mm, 5 urn (Agilent), flow: lmL/min, UV detection @ 232 nm, Gradient: isocratic, runtime: 5 min, injection volume: 10 uL. An external calibration curve using paclitaxel and 7-epipaclitaxel was used to quantify the paclitaxel in the extracts. The release profile of paclitaxel from the samples was plotted as percent pacltiaxel release against time.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
EVALUATION OF PACLITAXEL CONTAINING MESH ON INTIMAL HYPERPLASIA DEVELOPMENT IN A RAT BALLOON INJURY CAROTID ARTERY MODEL<br>
Rat balloon injury carotid artery model was used to demonstrate the efficacy of a paclitaxel containing mesh system on the development of intimal hyperplasia fourteen days following placement.<br>
Control Group<br>
Wistar rats weighing 400 - 500 g were anesthetized with !.5% halothane in oxygen and the left external carotid artery was exposed. An A 2 French Fogarty balloon embolectomy catheter (Baxter, Irvine, CA) was advanced through an arteriotomy in the<br>
49<br><br>
external carotid artery down the left common carotid artery to the aorta. The balloon was inflated with enough saline to generate slight resistance (approximately 0.02 ml) and it was withdrawn with a twisting motion to the carotid bifurcation. The balloon was then deflated and the procedure repeated twice more. This technique produced distension of the arterial wall and denudation of the cndothelium. The external carotid artery was ligated after removal of the catheter. The right common carotid artery was not injured and was used as a control.<br>
Local Perivascular Paclitaxel Treatment<br>
Immediately after injury of the left common carotid artery, a 1 cm long distal segment of the artery was exposed and treated with a lxl cm paclitaxcl-containing mesh. The wound was then closed the animals were kept for 14 days.<br>
Histology and immunohistochemistry<br>
At the time of sacrifice, the animals were euthanized with carbon dioxide and pressure perfused at 100 mmHg with 10% phosphate buffered formaldehyde for 15 minutes. Both carotid arteries were harvested and left overnight in fixative. The fixed arteries were processed and embedded in paraffin wax. Serial cross-sections were cut at 3 ?m thickness every 2 mm within and outside the implant region of the injured left carotid artery and at corresponding levels in the control right carotid artery. Cross-sections were stained with Mayer's hematoxylin-and-eosin for cell count and with Movat's pentachrome stains for morphometry analysis and for extracellular matrix composition assessment.<br>
Results<br>
From Figures 3-5, it is evident that the perivascular delivery of paclitaxe! using the paclitaxel.mesh formulation resulted is a dramatic reduction in intimal hyperplasia.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
EVALUATION OF PACUTAXEL CONTAINING MESH ON INTIMAL HYPERPLASIA DEVELOPMENT IN A SHEEP CAROTID ARTERY BYPASS GRAFT MODEL<br>
Expanded polytetrafluoroethylene (ePTFE) is the most common material used for prosthetic vascular grafts, but the majority of these grafts fail over time, usually because of stenosis at the distal anastomosis site due to development of intimal hyperplasia.<br>
50<br><br>
The objective of this study was evaluation of the extent of intima! hyperplasia formation following use of a biodegradable, bioresorbable mesh containing paclitaxel and placed at the ePTFE distal anastomosis site. Paclitaxel is a drug that inhibits processes important in intimal hyperplasia development, including without limitation, inhibition of smooth muscle cell proliferation, cell migration, and matrix deposition.<br>
The left and right carotid arteries of anesthetized sheep were exposed by sharp dissection. A tunnel was formed from one carotid artery to the other to accommodate the ePTFE graft. The ePTFE graft was tunneled and trimmed for appropriate length and configuration. Using standard vascular technique, the ePTFE graft was anastomosed end-to-side with running 6-0 polypropylene suture. The angle of the junction between graft and native vessel was approximately 45Â°. The length of the implanted graft ranged from 9.5 - 15 cm (average 11 cm). The graft implant configuration is illustrated in Figure 6.<br>
Paclitaxel was incorporated into the 2 cm x 5 cm PLG mesh in the following doses and animal test groups: Group 1, 0 mg; Group 2, 0.6 mg; Group 3, 1.8 mg; and Group 4, 3.0 mg. The mesh was placed at the distal end of the graft at the anastomosis site. To place the mesh, the long side was pulled under the artery and up around either side of the distal end of the graft. One edge was positioned as close to the heel of the anastomosis as possible. The top edges of the mesh were sewn together with one suture on either side of the graft so that no gaps were left in the circumferential direction. One suture was placed at the proximal end and the other at the distal end of the mesh, and sewn to nearby connective tissue to prevent slippage of the mesh away from the anastomosis (see Figure 6). The surgical sites were closed in layers with running absorbable sutures. Standard antibiotics and analgesics were administered after surgery for several days as required.<br>
At approximately 56 days post-graft implant, animals were anesthetized. Contrast media was injected and angiograms performed of the distal graft and artery at the distal anastomosis. Immediately prior to euthanasia, the animals received heparin (150 U/kg, IV) and immediately after euthanasia, the ePTFE graft was rinsed in situ with lactated Ringers solution and perfusion-fixed in situ with 10% neutral buffered formalin (NBF). The specimens were excised en bloc and allowed to immersion fix in 10% NBF at least 24 hours prior to histological processing.<br>
The fixed specimens were trimmed and mapped accurately for corresponding cross sectional location in reference to the ePTFE graft configuration.    The scheme for<br>
51<br><br>
sectioning is illustrated in Figure 7. A total of nine sections were cut at the distal end of the graft: two cut perpendicular to the artery on either side of the anastomosis (Al and A5), one perpendicular to the artery through the 4itoe" of the anastomosis (A2), one or two cut through the floor of the anastomosis adjacent to the "toe" (A3 and A4), three cut perpendicular to the graft at its distal end, and one through the center of the graft. Adjacent sections were cut at approximately 3 mm intervals. The specimens were paraffin-embedded, cross-sectioned, and four sets of slides made, two stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E), and one each stained with Masson's trichrome and Verhoeff Van Gieson (VVG). These stains were selected for their ability to show tissue cellularity (H&amp;E), collagen, smooth muscle and fibrin (Masson's Trichrome), and clastin (VVG).<br>
Morphometric Analysis:<br>
The morphometric analysis system consists of an Olympus BX40 microscope, Optronics Image Sensor DEI-750, Sony HR Trinitron monitor, and PC computer equipped with Media Cybernetics Image-Pro Plus software v. 3.0 for Windows. Digital images are created, labeled, and stored according to applicable BioDevelopment Associates SOPs. With regard to the results, the following definitions apply: Proximal- toward the heart; Distal- away from the heart; Anastomosis- surgical connection of graft to native vessel; *'Toe" of Anastomosis- where graft and vessel meet at an obtuse angle; "Heel" of Anastomosis- where graft and vessel meet at an acute angle; "Floor" of Anastomosis- region between toe and heal; Stenosis- narrowing of graft or vessel lumen; Neointima- hyperplastic lesion on luminal surface characterized by proliferating smooth muscle cells (SMC); Pseudointima- lesion on luminal surface composed of aged thrombus, which is not undergoing typical reorganization by SMC proliferation.<br>
Morphometric measurements of histological cross sections included neointimal area (IA), maximal neointimal thickness (MIT), luminal area (LA), and area inside the graft (GA). GA = IA + LA. Area inside the graft was the reference measurement from which stenosis was determined (percent stenosis 100MA/GA). In asymmetrical sections through the floor of the anastomosis, where graft sections were not complete, only MIT was measured.<br>
Morphometric analysis was performed on sections A2 ("toe" section cut<br>
    perpendicular to the native vessel), and on sections A6, A7 and A8 (the first three complete<br>
graft sections cut perpendicular to the graft at it's distal end) (see Figure 7).  Group results<br>
were compared using a one-tailed t-test. Each of the paclitaxel mesh groups was compared to<br>
52<br><br>
the zero-dose mesh group. A summary presentation of group morphometric data is shown in Tables 1-3. Group averages for all parameters in all sections in all paclitaxel groups were less than corresponding data from the zero-dose controls.<br>
Intraluminal lesions that represented permanent or semi-permanent luminal obstructions and thus contributed functionally to reduction in blood flow were included in the morphometric analysis. Both neointima (hyperplastic lesion characterized by proliferating SMC) and pseudointima (aged adherent thrombus not undergoing typical reorganization by SMC migration and proliferation) were included in the analysis, whereas fresh thrombus was not. In reporting the morphometric data, no distinction was made between neointima and pseudointima since both represented stenotic lesions.<br>
The MIT in Section 2 ("toe" section) for Group 1 (controls) was 0.82 + 0.29 mm (group average Â± SD). The low, mid, and high dose paclitaxel groups had values of 0.78 + 0.30 mm, 0.59 Â± 0.14, mm and 0.54 Â± 0.23 mm, respectively (5%, 28%, and 34% less than controls), but these differences were not statistically signifimayt at a 95% confidence interval (p &gt; 0.05). MIT in section 6 (first full cross section of graft adjacent to the distal anastomosis) in the controls was 1.31 Â± 0.82 mm. The low, medium, and high dose paclitaxel groups had MIT in section 6 of 0.38 Â± 0.12 mm, 0.31 Â± 0.29 mm, and 0.34 Â± 0.20 mm, respectively. The reductions in MIT in Groups I, 2 and 3 were statistically signifimayt (p 
The IA of the control group was 7.41 + 5.12 mm, 6.28 Â± 4.31 mm, and 5.57 Â± 4.62 mm in sections 6, 7, and 8, respectively. In the paclitaxel groups, IA was reduced approximately 70-80%. Reductions in IA for section 6 in Groups 3 and 4 and for section 7 in Group 2,3 and 4 were statistically signifimayt (p 
The percent stenosis due to neointima in the control gfoup in section 6 was 28.4 Â± 19.5 mm2. As was the case for the other parameters, stenosis did not decrease markedly at sites 3 and 6 mm into the graft from the anastomosis. Likewise, the effect of paclitaxel on reducing stenosis was similar to the effect on IA, with approximately 70-80% reduction in stenosis, and 7 of 9 values were signifimaytly lower than controls (p 
53<br><br>
There did not appear to be a marked dose effect of paclitaxel on luminal lesions (neointima and/or pseudointima) that contributed to stenosis. Figures 8-10 clearly illustrate this point. There is an indication that stenosis was reduced slightly more at the mid paclitaxel dose than the low dose, but clearly there is no further gain in efficacy at the high dose.<br>
The attrition rate in this study due to early graft occlusion was larger than expected at the outset.   The attrition rate appeared to have a dose dependence, which is supported by the histopathology analysis.  At the lowest paclitaxel dose, 0.6 mg, there was a marked and signifimayt reduction in lesions causing luminal narrowing at the distal end of the graft. This effect did not increase markedly with increased dose, suggesting that the low dose achieved near maximal response in terms of efficacy to inhibit stenosis. The inhibitory effect of paclitaxel does not affect the mechanical integrity of the anastomosis (no evidence of leakage) in the dose range tested. Intraluminal endothelialization is not affected by paclitaxel. Finally, paclitaxel in the doses tested is not toxic to the native artery wall. Thus, the results of this study suggest that low and mid doses represent a useful clinical range of efficacy and safety.<br>
