FLEXIBLE BONE COMPOSITE<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention includes flexible bone composites including at least one polymeric layer and at least one calcium-containing layer, and methods for making the same. The composites of the invention have improved handling characteristics.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
An area of interest with regard to bone cements or calcium phosphate compositions focuses on reinforcing bone cements with various materials. Often ceramic bone cements, though strong, are brittle and not sufficiently resistant to catastrophic failure (e.g., through cracking) to function as a matrix material. Polymers can be used to reinforce ceramic bone components. For example, implantable composite materials containing a strong and resilient matrix impregnated with reinforcing filler particles, whiskers, or meshes are known. Resorbable implant materials, such as polylactides and polyglycolides, compared to traditional, non-resorbable metal or composite materials, for example, have the advantage of being biocompatible, of being biodegradable after a period of time, and of not requiring removal, e.g., in bone fixation or repair applications. These qualities can be useful for implant matrices that are designed to be temporary place fillers (and in, some cases, stabilizing components) for healing and/or regrowth, e.g., of bone voids or defects.<br>

WO 2005/123155	PCT/US2005/020484<br>

The polymeric layers are commercially available or can be made by polymerizing the various types of monomers (e.g., L-lactide, glycolide) using any suitable method such as those described below. When the polymeric layers includes two or more different monomers, i.e., a copolymer, any method capable of forming the copolymer such that the biodegradation or resorbability and the mechanical properties (e.g., before and during implantation) are sufficient for the requirements of the application for which the copolymer is to be used. For example, one such polymerization method can be found in U.S. Patent No. 6,096,855, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference hereto. Other examples of copolymerization methods for producing poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) and other random copolymers are disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 4,157,437 and International Publication No. WO 97/36553, the entire disclosures of which are also incorporated herein by reference hereto.<br>
Advantageously, in one embodiment, the polymers from which the polymeric layer is formed must have a sufficient molecular weight to be able to perform (e.g., mechanically) in the desired application. Generally, a sufficiently high molecular weight can be obtained by polymerizing substantially all (i.e., preferably at least about 98 mol%, more preferably at least about 99 mol%, most preferably at least about 99.5 mol%) of the monomeric and/or dimeric copolymer substituents. As used herein, the term "molecular weight" should be understood to mean extent of polymerization, or number or weight average of monomeric or dimeric units in the copolymer chains, Molecular weight, as used herein, can be approximated by a number of known methods, e.g., such as by gel permeation or size exclusion chromatography (GPC or SEC), by inherent or intrinsic viscosity analysis (I. V.), or<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2005/123155	PCT/US2005/020484<br>
by an equivalent scientific technique through which a correlation can be made to estimate copolymer molecular weight.<br>
When measured by GPC or SEC against polystyrene standards, the polymers according to the invention (before being processed or fabricated into films) can, in one embodiment, exhibit a number average molecular weight of at least about 75,000 grams/mole, for example from about 150,000 grams/mole to about 1,000,000 grams/mole or from about 250,000 grams/mole to about 900,000 grams/mole. Such measurements can, in another embodiment, also yield a weight average molecular weight of at least about 125,000 grams/mole, for example at least about 250,000 grams/mble or from about 400,000 grams/mole to about 2,500,000 grams/mole. Alternately, in some embodiments, the number average molecular weight can be between about 16,000 grams/mole and about 75,000 grams/mole or between about 18,000 grams/mole and about 50,000 grams/mole, and the number average molecular weight can be between about 50,000 grams/mole and about 150,000 grams/mole or between about 60,000 grams/mole and about 120,000 grams/mole.<br>
In another embodiment, such measurements can also show a polydispersity (i.e., a ratio of weight average molecular weight to number average molecular weight) from about 1.3 to about 3.5, for example from about 1.6 to about 2.8 or from about 1.85 to about 2.5. The desired application for which the polymeric layers will be used should generally determine the acceptable range of molecular weight values, e.g., a copolymer used for drug delivery, maxillofacial implant, or other application in which enhanced biodegradation or resorbability is paramount, may be preferred to exhibit number average and/or weight average molecular weights in a lower region of, or even below, the ranges listed above, whereas a copolymer used in a pin, rod, anchor, staple, or other mechanically-intensive and/or load-bearing application may be preferred to exhibit number average and/or weight average molecular weights in an intermediate or upper region of, or even above, the ranges listed above.<br>
When measured for I. V. at a concentration of about 0.1% w/v in chloroform, the polymers according to the invention (before being processed or fabricated into layers) can, in one embodiment, exhibit an. inherent viscosity of at least about 1.0 dl/g, for example from about 2.5 dug to about 8 dl/g, from about; 3 dug to about 7 dl/g or from about 4 dl/g to about<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2005/123155	PCT/US2005/020484<br>
6.5 dl/g. In another embodiment, the inherent viscosity of the poly(L-lactide-co-glycolide) copolymer of the invention can be greater than about 4.5 dl/g. The desired application for which the polymers will be used should generally determine the acceptable range of inherent viscosity values, e.g., a copolymer used for drug delivery, maxillofacial implant, or other application in which enhanced biodegradation or resorbability is paramount, may be preferred to exhibit lower inherent or intrinsic viscosities than those listed above, whereas films used in a composite for a pin, rod, anchor, staple, or other mechanically-intensive and/or load-bearing application may be preferred to exhibit inherent or intrinsic viscosities within, or even above, those listed above.<br>
The polymers can have a low moisture (or water) content (i.e., before being combined with the calcium compound-containing component), for example, not more than about 1.5% by weight or not more than about 1% by weight. In one embodiment, the moisture or water content can be not more than about 500 ppm, for example not more than about 250 ppm or not more than about 150 ppm. In other embodiments, the moisture or water content of polymers according to the invention can be not more than about 200 ppm or not more than about 100 ppm.<br>
In some embodiments, the polymers can be subject to a drying and/or volatile organic compound (VOC) removal step, in order to remove water, organic solvent(s), unreacted monomer/dimer, or other low molecular weight and/or volatile impurities or compounds that can be present in the polymers. This drying/removal step can include, but is not limited to, introduction of a relatively-dry, inert gas (e.g., such as dry nitrogen, argon, or the like, or a mixture containing such a gas), application of a vacuum (e.g., such that the pressure is not more than about 10 Torr, for example more than about 5 Torr or not more than about 1 Ton:), application of an increased temperature (e.g., of at least about 50°C, for example at least about 65°C such as from about 70°C to about 120°C, and also preferably, provided that the copolymer is at least partially crystalline, that the increased temperature is not greater than about 5°C below its melting temperature, for example not greater than about 10°C below its melting temperature), or any combination thereof. This drying/removal step is generally undertaken for a period of time sufficient to render the moisture content within acceptable or preferred limits. When performed, the step can advantageously include a combination of application of increased temperature and application of a vacuum and occurs<br>

WO 2005/123155	PCT/US2005/020484<br>
for at least about 4 hours, for example for at least about 12 hours, or alternately for not more than about 24 hours or from about 16 hours to about 20 hours.<br>
The polymers can exhibit a widejrange of degrees of crystallinity, with preferable values depending upon the desired application for which they are to be used. In one embodiment, the polymeric layers are semicrystalline and can exhibit a degree of crystallinity from about 15% to about 30%, for example from about 20% to about 30%, or for example from about 20% to about 26%. In another embodiment, the layers of the invention can exhibit a degree of crystallinity of less than about 15%. In an alternate embodiment, the layers of the invention can exhibit a degree of crystallinity from about 15% to about 50%. In other alternate embodiments, the layers of the invention can exhibit a degree of crystaUinity of less than about 10%, less than about 5%, less than about 1%, or can exhibit substantially no crystallinity (i.e., less than about 0.5%, preferably less than about 0.1%, or at any rate not quantitatively detectable by one or more experimental methods). The "degree of crystallinity" can be measured by a number of well-known experimental techniques and, when the term is used herein, reflects the relative proportion, by volume, cross-sectional area, or linear path through a sample, of crystalline regions in comparison to non-crystalline or amorphous regions of the films. Suitable experimental techniques to measure degree of crystallinity include, but are not limited to, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), x-ray scattering or diffraction methods (e.g., XRD, WARD, WAXS, etc.), or the like.<br>
The polymers may also exhibit a wide range of degrees of crystalline perfection (or crystalline imperfection), again with preferable values depending upon the desired application for which they are to be used. The degree of crystalline perfection or imperfection can be measured, for example, by DSC or another well-known experimental technique and can be referred to herein in terms of a heat of fusion (?Hf), which represents the relative perfection or imperfection of the crystals of the copolymer in terms of the amount of energy per unit of material (e.g., in Joules per gram, J/g, or milli Joules per milligram, mJ/mg) required to melt, or de-crystallize, the crystals of the copolymer. In one embodiment, the films of the invention are semicrystalline and can exhibit a heat of fusion of less than about 50 J/g, for example less than about 30 J/g or less than about 25 J/g. In another embodiment, the films of the invention can exhibit a heat of fusion from about 50 J/g to about 70 J/g. In alternate embodiments, the films of the invention can exhibit a heat of<br>
11<br><br>
WO 2005/123155	PCT/US2005/020484<br>
fusion of from about 0.5 J/g to about 15 J/g, from about 0.1 J/g to about 10 J/g, from about 15 J/g to about 25 J/g, or can exhibit substantially no heat of fusion (i.e., less than about 0.1 J/g, or at any rate not quantitatively detectable by one or more experimental methods).<br>
Melting temperatures and glass transition temperatures for the polymers can also vary, with preferable values depending upon the desired application for which they are to be used. Melting and glass transition temperatures can be measured, for example, by DSC or another well-known experimental technique, and are generally dependent upon the rate at which temperature is increased or decreased. Standard DSC tests are performed with temperature changing at a rate of about 5oC/min to about 20°C/min, particularly at about 10°C/min. The melting temperature of the polymeric layers of the present invention, as measured by standard DSC tests, can, in one embodiment, be between about 90°C and about 225°C, for example from about 110°C to about 165°C or from about 130°C,to about 150°C. The glass transition temperatures of the polymers, as measured by standard DSC tests, can, in another embodiment, be between about 30°C and about 100°C, for example between about 40°C and about 60°C.<br>
Values for various mechanical properties of the polymers can vary widely, depending inter alia upon the desired application for which they are to be used and the process by which they are formed into articles or devices for said applications. For example, in one embodiment, the tensile strength of the polymers can range from about 10 to about 100 MPa. In another embodiment, the elastic modulus of the polymers can range from about 0.1 to about 6 GPa.<br>
As the polymers and/or compositions have utility in implantations and in vivo applications, it may be desirable to sterilize such polymers and/or composites to minimize in vivo response, e.g., from infection, foreign body rejection, or the like. Because the resorbable polymers of the invention are resorbable or degradable in the presence of water, sterilization methods other than autoclavjng are particularly appropriate. Such sterilization processes can include, but are not limited to, exposure to ethylene oxide, exposure to y-radiation, exposure to an electron beam source, exposure to a cold (or at least low-temperature) plasma source, or a combination thereof. The sterilization process, depending<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2005/123155	PCT/US2005/020484<br>
upon the exposure dose and duration, is one possible way to introduce branching, grafting, or crosslinking to the polymers.<br>
In one embodiment, single or multiple doses to these means of sterilization can be performed on the polymers, articles, or devices according to the invention in an amount, or in amounts, sufficient to prevent, inhibit, or curtail in vivo response. In one preferred embodiment, the sterilization includes a single dose exposure to radiation or ethylene oxide. In another preferred embodiment, the sterilization includes a single dose exposure of the ; poly(L-lactide-co-e-caprqlactone) copolymers or composites according to the invention to y-radiation of about 25 kGy.<br>
Whenthe resorbable polymeric layer includes resorbable polymers, the flexible bone composites containing them tend to exhibit complete in vivo or in vitro resorption from about 1 month to about 2.5 years, for example from about 2 months to about 2 years. As used herein, "complete resorption" refers to the situation where, upon visual inspection, there is either no evidence of polymeric material at the site of implantation, or where, upon analysis of a sample of the implantation site of the degraded polymer, there is an absence of oligomeric material resultant from degradation of the polymer that has a number average molecular weight of more than about 1,00.0 grams/mole or not more than about 500 grams/mole. In another embodiment, the polymers and/or compositions according to the invention should typically retain at least a portion of their mechanical properties after implantation in vivo or after exposure to a phosphate buffered saline (PBS) solution having a pH of about 7.4 (± 0.2) at a temperature of about 37°C (± 1°C).<br>
The polymeric layer can be prepared by methods known in the art. For example, in one embodiment, the polymeric layer can prepared using conventional viscoelastic-liquid forming or liquid-setting means including, but not limited to, extrusion, compression molding, injection molding, thermoforming, blow molding, rotational molding, calendaring and casting (see, e.g., Joel R. Fried, Polymer Science and Technology, pages 373-384 (1995), and K. J. Mackenzie, "Film and Sheeting Materials" in 10 Kirk Othmer: Encyclopedia of Chemical Technology 775-787 (1993), the entire contents of each of the foregoing references being incorporated herein by reference).<br>

The calcium compounds may be particles or granules of any size or shape. The granules are available commercially or can be obtained by grinding or milling a calcium compound to a desired particle size or particle diameter. The granules can be classified by, for example, sieving, to obtain the desired range of particle diameters (see Perry's Chemical Engineering Handbook, chapter 21, pages 13-19 (Don. W.

For instance, in some embodiments, the layered composites can be heated in a convection oven for a time and a temperature sufficient to make the polymeric layers tacky followed by cooling. In another embodiment, pressure is applied to the heated multi-layer composite.<br>
In another embodiment, a flexible synthetic composite can be rolled up, e.g., like a jelly roll, to provide a thicker composite. In certain embodiments, it may be desirable for the portion of the rolled up composite that is on the exterior of the roll (e.g., on the outer circumference of the device shown in Fig. 6) to contain predominantly non-resorbable polymer and for the portion of the rolled up composite that is on the interior of the roll to contain predominantly resorbable polymer.<br>
In some embodiments, the flexible composites are malleable and moldable, and can be formed or cut into the desired shape before and/or during implantation.

27<br><br>
WO 2005/123155	PCT/CS2005/020484<br>
In one embodiment, the therapeutic substance is a growth factor such as, but not limited to, bone morphogenetic proteins, endothelial cell growth factors, insulin-like growth factors, or the like, or a combination thereof.<br>
Any suitable amount of therapeutic substance may be used. For example, the amount of antimicrobial agent that is present in the flexible bone composite may be an amount sufficient to provide for a product that at least reduces the growth rate of microbial organisms in the region of the product as compared to a control. In many embodiments, the amount of antibiotic will be sufficient to provide for a zone of inhibition having a diameter of at least about 10 mm, usually at least about 15 mm, as measured by the antibiotic activity assay as described U.S. Patent No. 5,968,253 to Poser et ah, the entire content of which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. The amount of therapeutic substance used in the flexible bone composite can vary depending on factors such as location of the repair, age and health of the patient, and the like, and can be determined by one skilled in the art.<br>
Flexible bone composites including a therapeutic substance are also useful in the local delivery of such substance, e.g. to a physiological site of interest. For example, flexible bone composites including an antimicrobial agent are useful for methods requiring release of an antimicrobial agent into a local environment over an extended period of time, where the period of time is generally at least about 5, usually at least about 10, and more usually at least about 20 days, where the flexible bone composites may release the antimicrobial agent into their local environment for as long as 40 days or longer, depending on the specific composition from which the product is prepared. Thus, the flexible bone composites including an antimicrobial agent find use as extended antimicrobial agent delivery vehicles, i.e. as antimicrobial agent depots, in which the local delivery of an antimicrobial agent for an extended period of time is desired. The subject compositions find particular use as local antimicrobial agent delivery vehicles forbone tissue, particularly cancellous bone tissue.<br>
In addition to, or instead of, therapeutic substances, flexible bone composites according to the invention can contain cells, particularly mononuclear cells, e.g., that are or can be differentiated (in vivo) into cells related to bone (i.e., osteogenic cells, precursors, or associated materials such as osteoblasts, osteoblast precursors, bone marrow cells, blood cells, connective tissue cells including smooth muscle cells and the like, connective tissue<br>
28<br><br>
WO 2005/123155	PCT/US2005/020484<br>
progenitors, mesenchymal stem cells, collagen, fibrin, or the like, or a combination thereof). Flexible bone composites containing such cells, whether on the surface(s) or in the interior, can advantageously be used as a matrix for tissue engineering.<br>
When utilized, the cells, whether allogenic, autogenic, or xenogenic, can be harvested and/or isolated by any known or conventional means, e.g., by centrifugation of bone marrow to isolate mononuclear cells, followed, for instance, by cell seeding and culturing in an osteogenic medium.<br>
The invention also includes methods for making a flexible bone composite including a polymeric layer and a calcium-containing layer.<br>
The flexible bone composite can be made by forming a polymeric layer as described above, and depositing a first calcium compound on the first side of the polymeric layer to form a first calcium-containing layer on the polymeric layer. Any suitable method for affixing or physically and/or chemically attaching the calcium compound to the surface of the first side of the polymeric layer can be used. For example, in one embodiment, the calcium compound can be affixed or physically and/or chemically attached to the first side of the polymeric layer by heating the polymeric layer for a time and a temperature sufficient to cause the calcium compound disposed on the surface of the first polymeric layer to physically and/or chemically attach to or adhere to the surface, e.g., by heating the polymeric layer until it becomes tacky. In another non-limiting embodiment, the calcium compound is affixed or physically and/or chemically attached to the surface of a gel (which forms the first polymeric layer) to form a calcium-containing layer on the first polymeric layer. Optionally, the method of affixing or of physically and/or chemically attaching the calcium compound to the polymeric layer can include applying pressure.<br>
In one embodiment, the flexible bone composite is made by forming a polymeric layer having a first side and a second side; contacting a first calcium compound with the first side of the polymeric layer to form a first intermediate composite; and heating the first intermediate composite at a temperature sufficient to affix or to physically and/or chemically attach the first calcium compound to the first side of the polymeric layer.<br>
In one embodiment, the polymeric layers of the invention can be perforated prior to contact with the calcium compound.<br>
29<br><br>
WO 2005/123155	PCT/US2005/020484<br>
In another embodiment, the invention includes a method for making a flexible bone composite including a perforated polymeric layer having a first side and a second side, including: perforating a polymeric layer to form a perforated polymeric layer; heating the perforated polymeric layer; contacting a first calcium compound with the first side of the perforated polymeric layer to form a first intermediate composite; and allowing the first intermediate composite to cool to a temperature sufficient to affix or to physically and/or chemically attach the first calcium compound to the first side of the perforated polymeric layer to provide a first calcium-containing layer.<br>
In one embodiment, the perforated polymeric layer is heated for a time and a temperature sufficient to make the polymeric layer tacky.<br>
Another method for making a flexible bone composite includes: casting a solution including a polymer and a solvent onto a release surface; allowing the solution to form a gel; contacting a calcium compound with a first side of the gel; and allowing the solvent to evaporate from the gel to form a flexible;bone composite having a calcium-containing layer affixed or physically and/or chemically attached to the first side of the polymeric layer.<br>
Once prepared, the flexible bone composite may be dried under reduced pressure, packaged within an appropriate moisture and sterilized.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention includes a kit or packaging system for storing, preparing, mixing, and/or administering composites according to the invention.<br>
The flexible bone composites according to the present invention can be used as or in implantable medical devices, and the like. Specifically, such applications or devices can include, but are not limited to, bone grafticontainment (e.g., bone graft or bone graft substitutes) or bone void filler either alone or in combination with one or more other conventional devices, which can include,1 but are not limited to, bone fixation plates (e.g., craniofacial, maxillofacial, orthopedic, skeletal, or the like); screws, tacks, clips, staples, nails, pins or rods, anchors (e.g., for suture, bone, or the like); scaffolds, scents, meshes (e.g., rigid, expandable, woven, knitted, weaved; etc.); sponges, implants for cell encapsulation or tissue engineering, drug delivery (e.g., carriers, bone ingrowth induction catalysts such as bone morphogenetic proteins, growth factors, peptides, and the like, antivirals, antibiotics, etc.); monofilament or multifilament structures, sheets, coatings, membranes (e.g., porous,<br>
30<br><br>

microporous, resorbable, etc.); foams (e.g., open cell or closed cell), screw augmentation, cranial reconstruction; and/or combinations thereof. When used in or with implantable medical devices, the flexible bone composite is preferably bioabsorbable and/or resorbable.<br>
Any method for implanting the flexible bone composite can be used. For example, in one embodiment, the flexible bone composite can be laid into a void, placed onto a bone or bones, rolled and packed into a void, folded and packed into a void, and the like.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention'includes a method for treating a hard tissue defect, e.g., bone or cartilage, in a patient in need thereof, including implanting a therapeutically effective amount of the flexible bone composite of the invention into the defect. Such bone defects include, but are not limited to, bone void, bone grafts, spine defects, an orthopedic defects, or maxillofacial defects. In one embodiment, the bone defect is a bone void.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention includes a method for treating a bone defect further including using a fixation device with the flexible composite. Non-limiting examples of fixation devices include plates, screws, tacks, pins, rods, vertebral spacers, or any combination thereof.<br>
In another embodiment, the invention includes methods for aspirating bone marrow in a patient in need thereof, including: implanting a therapeutically effective amount of the flexible bone composite into an area proximal to the bone marrow. For example, in one embodiment, the flexible bone composite can be soaked in aspirated bone marrow and implanted as described above.<br>

Examples 19-22 - Effect of Surface Treatment on Composite Blood Uptake<br>
Four types of flexible bone composites according to the invention were fabricated in the same general manner as in Example 18 (but with the diameter of polymeric layer from Example 11 being about 250 mm, the thickness of the polymeric layer varying from about 0.09 to about 0.17 mm, and with the polymer weight exhibiting a change commensurate with the increased diameter) and were annotated as Examples 19-22. The composite of Example 19 contained a surface that was native, or untreated, while the surfaces of composites of Examples 20-22 were treated so as to make them more hydrophilic through exposure to oxygen plasma, to carbon dioxide plasma, and to a HYDROLAST™ treatment (which is a plasma/grafting treatment process commercially available from AST Products, Inc., of Billerica, MA, and which is described, inter alia, in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,700,559,5,807,636, and 5,837,377, the entire disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by reference), respectively. The conditions for the oxygen and carbon dioxide plasma treatments were similar to those used in the plasma portion of the HYDROLAST™ treatment process, which in these cases included RF plasma at a pressure of about 30 milliTorrs and at a power of about 250 Watts.<br>
For each of the Examples 19-22, some flexible bone composites were used as fabricated, while others were aged for about 21 days at about 45°C. The flexible bone composites of Examples 19-22, both as-fabricated and aged, were soaked in bovine blood under ambient conditions for about 30 seconds to determine blood uptake levels. Table 3 below shows the results. Mean uptake values represent the average of experiments on about 15 separate samples.<br><br>
