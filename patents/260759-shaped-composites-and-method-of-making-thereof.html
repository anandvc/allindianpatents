Description of Related Art<br>
Compositematerials have long beea utilized in various applicstiow In particular, composite materials have reoently been utilized as bcatiogs. Gcaerajly, beidtigs ate mechanical devices used £br TBoitigatiiig fiictional forces. Bearings generally belong to two broad categoiics, linear or ladial beaiings, desigoated as such based upon tho nature of the frictioiial forces they mitigats. Lanear ot thiust bearings sre used m applications having inotion along a straight line, such as moving a drawer in. and out. Radial or rotary bearings are used in applications that involve movement around a ceater axis, such as a wheel on aa axis. Additionally, sojue bcaiings are designed to deal with both thrust and radial loads.<br>
■Various l^ipes of materials have been utilized depending upon the type of bearing needed to properly reduce friction. la fact, dreading upon the reguixements and loads expected in the applicatjon, the material of the bearing canrmge from plastic, metals, to even ceramics. Recent advances have prodded a new genre of beaiiags caHcd self-lubricatiag beaiings, that may be used in mtne demandiBg enviioinrieiils, such as the high tempsnrtunes of an automobile. The type of material used facilitates the self-lubricating properties of these bearings. Some common self-Iuhricating materials include various polymers, graphite or Graphalloy® a graphite/metal alloy, and molybdenum disulfide (MoSj). Self-lubiicatiug bearings require litfie or no oil and typically do not deteriorate with wear as quickly as traditional bearings that rely upon traditional, supplemental lubrication.<br>
The processes used to form bearings varies dqjending upon the complexiiy of the shape of the bearing and the material bcin^ gjrmed but generally involves techniques such as molding, casting, or stanqring operations. Bearings having more coa^lex structures are generally formed through molding or casting ptQcessos. Bearings baying less complex stmctures, typically utilijie fonnmg processes such as stamping operations, which quicldy yidd the desired shape from a large sheet of material. However, these processes can bo wastsful in light of the cost of the final product,<br>
Accardiagly, the iadnstiy continues to lequiie nrprovemeaits to produce high perfonnancc composiliBs, such as those used in hearing applications, and as such, flie induatcy sjlso desires processes for fonnmg Mgh pafoimance composites ntilizmg mote cost effective and efficient processing.<br>

MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
According to one aspect, a process is disclosed that includes the steps of presiding a con^osite strip made of a substantially rigid substrate halving a major surface and a polymer overlymg the mqor surface of <br>
the substantially rigid substrate. The jirocess also mdudes the step of shying the composite siiip with a mandrel composiie to fonn a sh^ed composite piece having a shape substantially defined by the shape of ■ftie mandrel, such that dwrng the shaping step, the major surface of the composite strip is substantially maintained in one plane.<br>
Rsfcrring to FIG. 1, a flow chart is provided fflustmtiag steps of a, sctaplcss or ncar-scxapless fijiming techoiqae for shaping a composite material accoxding to one embodhnetrt. AoconJijig to FIG. 1, the process is initated by providiflg a con^wsite strip that inchides a substeatiaHy rigid substrate eod aa overlying polymer layer. In one embodiment the substantially rigid substrate iacludcs a metal, metal alloy, or a combinatioii thereof; Suitable metals for the substantially rigid substrate include pliable metals, for example, altttninum, iroo, copper, other transition metalsj or alloys thereof. Still, according to a particular embodiment the substantially rigid substrate is made of a woven metal ajesh.<br>
In fiirther isfercuce to the composite material, the substantially rigid substrate cati be generally fonned as a strip having a major surfacc. According to one embodirnett^ the composite strip has an aspect ratio of not less than about 5:1. Accordiag to another embodiment the aspect ratio can be greater, such as not less than about 6:1 or about 8:1. Still, accordi:® to aparticular embodhnent the a£i&gt;ect ratio of tiic composite strip is not less than about 10:1. As used hsidn, the term "a^ect ratio" is defined as the ratio between the longest dimension of the substrate (the length) and the second longest dimeosion (the width). The major surface of the substrate is the plane defined by the dimensions of the length and the widtL As such, the diortest dimnnsion of the substrate snip is the thiclmess, and according to one Bmbodnnent, the I thidmcss of the composite str^ is not greater ■fiian about 5,0.0 mm, such as not greater than about 4.0 ram, or even not greater than about 3.0 mm. The total Sickness of the composite strip is dependent in part Mpon the thickness ofthe substantially rigid substrate, which according to one embodimett is not greater than about 3.0 mm, sach as mrt greater than about 1.0 mm or even not greater thaa about 0.5 mm.<br>
According to amofher embodiment, the step of providing a corrqjosite material includes cutting a 5 compositestr^ ofdiscrete dimcmsionsfromalargerpiecBofconapositenialiniai For most applications, the length ofthe composite strip is tj-picaliy not greater than about 100 cm. According to one embodiment, the length ofthe cosaposite steip is not greater than sboui 75 cm, or about 50 cm. Still, the lengti ofthe composite strip can be less, such as not greater than about 25 cm, or even about 10 cm- la a particular anbodiment, the lengQi of the composite strip is between about 75 cm amd about 5 cm. Cutting of ftifc 0 composite strip can be acconqilished using manual or automatic devices. Furtiietmare, cuttmg of the composite strip can also include cutting the ends of the composite strip at an angle to the lateral axis, sudi that the ends ofthe C0n?)0site stdp are tapaed. Tapering the ends ofthe conqiosite strip malcEs a length of one side of flie composite str^ shorter than a lengfii of the opposing side of ftie coii5&gt;osite strip. This aids the foiination of a composite shc^e having a g^, such, as a compodte split-washei as described in a. i5 subseqaraitenibodimest <br>
. Tho stq) of piovidiag the substrate can also mdude cutting a substrate of a discrete width &amp;oin a larger piacts of conq)osite mateiiaL Accordiiig to o»e embodiment, 1iue vvidlii of tie substrate is aot greaxer than about 5,0 ciq, sucli as not greater than about 4.0 cm, or even not greatEr than about 3.0 cm. As such, the ■width of the substrate can be smaller dspeading upon tiie dcsitcd dimensions of the final pieco and can be not greater than aboitf 2.0 cm-<br>
In reference fo the composite inateii4 'flje substantially rigid substrats includes an overlying polymer layer, such that the polymer layer is a laminate end substantial^ overlies the major surfece of the substrate. The polymer laminate can be obtained fion a sheet of material 1ha.t hias been slaved or shaved to produce a polymer sheet iaviag a fine tiMcincss, such as less t3ian about 1.0 mm thick. The substrate can be lamiaated ■with the polymer sheet, such that the polymer overlies at least a. major surfhce of the substantially rigid substrate as a sheet of material. Optionally, an additional rigid mesh layer, such as a bronze metal medi layer, can be introduced between the substantially rigid substcate and the polymer laminate layer. Porming the composite material typically includes heat and pressure neatment, as well as an adhesive, sudi as e^aiylene tstrafluororethyknc (ETFE), to bond the pdymar laminate and the I substantially rigid substrate. Additionally, a rigid backing layer, such as a metal baddng layer cen be affixed to the composite material for improved dvirability and fonnabiKly, The metal baddng can ovexlie the substrate or a polymer laminate layer. In cme embodiment, the polymer lay«i can substantially overlie amajorily of the surfaces of the substrate, such as the major surfece of^flie snbstrate and the sides adjacent the major surace of the substrate. Still, the polymer layer can be a laminate layer that substantially overlies 3 the BBjor sui&amp;ce of the substrate, the opposiag major surfecc of the substrate, and ■&amp;e adjacent sides of the substrate. Generally, the polymer layer is pliable and suitable for fonning ■with the metal. According to one Bmbodimenl, the polymer can be a fkoropolymer, such as a polytetrafluoroefliylene (PTFE), the addition of which is suitable for use in self-lubricating bearing ^plications. In addition, the polymer layer can tadude fillers sutsh as ceramics, ceiasnic fibers or carbon containing compounds. In a particular 5 mbodiment, the composite meteiial is NORGLIDE® composite material, commeicially available from Saint-Gobain Perfomaance Plastics Corporalion, 150 Dey Roa4 Wayne, New Jersey.<br>
KeSsning again to ritr, j., aiWd proviatng Oiu uumj^w^ito »itip loi, ike i.nTrn.oritB rttiti c^n iv engaged in a channel 103, According to one embodiment, the conqiosite strip can bs machine fed into the channel or can be manually fed into the channel The cbamiel can have dimensions substantially similar to (0 the dimensions of the composite sb^ such that at least a portion of the composite strip is secured in the cianuel during fonning,<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, after the composite strip is eogaged in the cianael 103, the con::5)osite strip engages amandrd 105. Cjcncrally, the composite strip can engage The mandrel by contactiiig a portion of the strip to the surfecc of the maadisL Engaging the mandrel can flather include securing a 3 5 portion of Hie composite strip against the jnandiel. According to various embodimcats herein, the<br>
composite strip can be genoally secuicd in the chamel and cf^engage the maudrd such th&amp;t the iimjor siir&amp;cB of the composite strip xs not in contact wifh the sutfece of tibe mandrel, lathsr sm edge of the composite strip dsfmed by fhe iMaknfiBB of fiie coinposite strip can be in contact with the surface of His maadiel duiing fbrmiug.<br>
f<br>
AccDidbg]^, the mandrel can have a selected geomelay aod contour substantially similat to tiic desired geometry and contour of tie final shaped composite piece. Generally, the mandrel can havs a poiygonal shape, particularly a symmesricel polygonal siape, such ss a circle, or the like. Accarding to a particular cmboditneat, the mandrel has a circular contour for fbnning a shaped composite piece having a circular contour, wliercby the dicumfeicnoe of ■flie mandiel substantially defines the inner dicmnfcrence of the shaped composite piece. Gcneially, the size of lie mandrel can be altfired deipending upon the desired aizB of the shaped compoate. In the context of forming a shaped coinposite having a circular con^^om:, the dimnetef •of'the'm&amp;drel can be not less than, about 1 cav sum as not less than about 2.5 cm, and particularly within a range of diameters between about 23 cm and about 15 cm.<br>
After engaging the composite strip with the mandrel 105, the con^josite strip can be shaped around the contour of the mandrel 107, such that the major sm^faoe of the substrate and composite stjip do not contact 1be mandrel and arc maintaioed in one plane. According to one embodiment a suitable tedbniqac for forming the composite str^ around the msadtel inckdes rolling the major Burfaoc giflihe composite strip under a sufScient force to guide the composite str^ aroimd the mandrel. According to one embodiiceat, the rolling force is not less than about 2.0 ]cN, suoTi as not less than about 4.5 kN, or about lOiiN. In vaiioTis embodimeats, the force applied to this major sniface of the composite str^ can bo not less than about 15 iiJ and particularly wilhin a range between about 5 KNf and about 50 KN.<br>
The shaping process can also be aided by giipping the composite strip and guiding the composite strip around the mandrel while rolling -flie major surface of the composite strip. Tlie proccss can utilize oiie or a pluralily of gripping mechanisms, such as jaws or pincers, displaced eround the maadiel for engagiog the composite str^ and maiBiainriig sufScient force to aid the shaping proccss. According to a particular embodiment, a pair of jaws gr^s the ends of the composite strip while an edge of the composite strip engages the mandrel, such that at least a portion of the edge Bubstantially maintains contact ■with the sur&amp;ce of the mandrel during forming. In apaiticular embodiment, the jaws foan the composite strip along the shs^e of the mandrel wMle rollers move over the major surface of the conqjosite sti^. After fcBming half of the composite shape, aaotber set of jaws can grip the ends of the coinposite str^ and guide the composite strip along the remainder of the mandrel to finish the diapiog process vshile the major surface of the composite ojaterial is rolled under a suEEcieat force. Upon complelion of fiie shaping process L07, the composite str^ can be removed fiom effouadthe di^e ofthe mandiel 109. <br>
Refening to FIG- 2, a split-washer ZOO is iUustreted, which caa be foimed according to the fonning pioces$ described in the previous embodimeals, FIG. 2 illustmtes a composite strip 201 fanned mto an ammlar stmotore having a gap or split 207. The size of the gap csm vaiy depending npoEi the product's dasired applicotioa. According to one embodinieat, lie open aamilar stniclure has an outer ciiciimfeieDace extending through not less than about 340°, sudi as not less fhaa about 350°, or even not leas than about 355°.<br>
The split-waski of FIG. 2 has an inner dJameter 203 and an outer diameter 205. According to a jm-tidilar embodiment, tbs open Eomulai structure has a forming tbieshold. As used herein, the "forming ■ftiBdiold" is a measure of the maximum allowable diuiensiDns for fanning a composite shape using the fbnmag prgoess described in pjrevious embodiments. In tiie context of composite shapes having a circukr COTtoui, such as the split-'washer 200, the forming ■flnedaold dnscaibes the maximmn allowable o^tor diameter 205 as a ratio between the outw diameter 205 and the inner diameter 203 (0.£).B»e/I.D.).
