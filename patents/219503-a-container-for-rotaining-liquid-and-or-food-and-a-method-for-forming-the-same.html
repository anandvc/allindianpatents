				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a disposable<br>
container.  More particularly, the present invention<br>
10       relates to a thermoplastic film, which is heat and<br>
pressure fused to the inner and/or outer surfaces of<br>
the sidewall of a thermoplastic container, and<br>
optionally, to the inner and/or outer surfaces of<br>
container's base.  The container is generally pre-<br>
15        formed via a molding process from expandable<br>
thermoplastic particles, e.g. expandable polystyrene<br>
particles (EPS).  The container is used for holding<br>
liquids, such as coffee or foods containing oil<br>
and/or fat components such as precooked fat-<br>
20        containing foods, e.g. instant noodles, soups, fried<br>
chicken, and the like.<br>
2 .   Background Art<br>
The manufacture of molded articles, such as<br>
25        containers, i.e, cups, bowls, etc. from expanded<br>
thermoplastic particles is well known.  The most<br>
commonly used thermoplastic particles are expandable<br>
polystyrene particles known as EPS.  Typically,<br>
polystyrene beads are impregnated with a blowing<br>
30        agent, which boils below the softening point of the<br>
polystyrene and causes the impregnated beads to<br>
expand when they are heated.<br>
The formation of molded articles from<br>
impregnated polystyrene beads is generally done in<br>
35        two steps.  First, the impregnated polystyrene beads<br><br>
9253 PCT<br>
5        are pre-expanded to a density of from about 2 to 12<br>
pounds per cubic foot.  Second, the pre-expanded<br>
beads are heated in a closed, mold to further expand<br>
the pre- expanded beads to form a fused article<br>
haying the shape of the mold.<br>
10                           The expandable polystyrene particles used to<br>
make foam containers are generally prepared by an<br>
aqueous suspension polymerisation process, which<br>
results in beads that can be screened to relatively<br>
precise bead sizes.  Typically, bead diameters are<br>
15       within the range of from about 0,008 to about 0-02<br>
inch.  Occasionally, cups are made from particles<br>
having bead diameters as high as 0,03 inches.<br>
In spite of careful bead sise control, one<br>
problem, which continues to plague the container<br>
20        industry, is that after a period of time the EPS<br>
containers have a tendency to leak coffee or the oil<br>
and/or fat components in food substances carried by<br>
the containers.  That is, the coffee or the oil<br>
and/or fat permeate around the fused polystyrene<br>
25         beads onto the outer surface of the sidewall of the<br>
container.  The result can be an unsightly stain on<br>
the outer surface of the sidewall of the container<br>
and/or inconvenience to the holder of the container.<br>
Several approaches have evolved over the years<br>
30        directed toward the reduction of leakage in these<br>
containers for retaining liquids and/or pre-cooked<br>
foods.<br>
Amberg et al., U.S. Patent 4,036,675 discloses<br>
a container made from foamed plastic material,<br>
35.        preferably foamed polystyrene, which is lined on and<br>
or both sides with unoriented polyplefin film,<br>
2<br><br>
5        preferably polypropylene.  The film is secured to<br>
the foamed plastic base material using as a heat-<br>
sensitive adhesive a vinylic polymer or polyamide<br>
resin.  The film is coated with a wet adhesive and<br>
dried before laminating the film to the foam<br>
10        material.  Laminating is done by heating the foam<br>
material to 250-375ºF, preheating the coated film to<br>
lOO-l8OºP, and pressing the coated film surface<br>
against the heated foam using a cold platen or<br>
roller for 10 to 15 seconds,<br>
15                              Sonnenberg U.S. Patent Nos. 4,703,065 and<br>
4,720 ,419 disclose thermoplastic polymer foam cups<br>
for retaining coffee that are molded from<br>
thermoplastic polymer particles whose surfaces are-<br>
coated with a fluorosurfactant before molding.<br>
20                              Sonnenberg U.S. Patent No. 4, 785,022 discloses<br>
a method for enhancing the coffee retention of<br>
molded foam cups, which involves coating the<br>
expandable polystyrene particles with various rubber<br>
polymers and copolymers.  The rubber useful in the<br>
25         invention can be selected from the group consisting<br>
of polybutene, polyisobutylene, isobutylene-butene<br>
copolymer and butene-ethylene copolymer.<br>
Arch, et al. U.S. patent No. 4,798,749<br>
approaches the problem of coffee leakage by<br>
30        replacing conventional blowing agents such as<br>
butanes, n-pentane, hexanes, and the halogenated-<br>
hydrocarbons with isopentane in the expandable<br>
styrene polymer particles.<br>
Ikeda, et al., U.S. Patent Mo. 4,698,367<br>
35        discloses expandable thermoplastic resin particles<br>
in which the thermoplastic resin in which a<br>
3<br><br>
9253 PCT<br>
5        copolymer composed of a fluorinated vinyl polymer<br>
part and a hydrophi1ic vinyl polymer part covers or<br>
is included on the surface or in the surface layer<br>
of the expandable thermoplastic particle.  These<br>
resin particles are useful for producing package<br>
10        containers for oily or fatty foods-<br>
Sakoda et al., U.S. Patent No. 6,277,451 B1 is<br>
directed to the prevention of oil from penetrating<br>
into a vessel obtained from expandable thermoplastic<br>
resin beads through molding.  This is achieved by<br>
15        coating the surface or the resin beads or<br>
incorporating the resin beads with a fluorine-<br>
containing block copolymer comprising a fluorine -<br>
containing vinyl-type polymer segment derived from- a<br>
fluorine-containing vinyl-type monomer and a<br>
20        lipophilic vinyl-type polymer segment derived from a<br>
lipophilic vinyl-type monomer.<br>
The containers of the above prior art are<br>
generally addressed to polystyrene containers, such<br>
as cups or bowls.  The following patents pertain to<br>
25        paper cups that are either spray coated or that<br>
contain a thermoplastic resin film either for heat<br>
insulating purposes or for producing a high<br>
impermeability to liquids.<br>
For example, Suzuki et al., U.S. Patent No.<br>
30        4,206,249 discloses a process for producing a paper<br>
container having high impermeability to liquid which<br>
comprises spray coating a polymerizable solution<br>
containing a prepolynter onto a wall surface of a<br>
previously fabricated paper container and<br>
35         irradiating the coated wall with ultraviolet light<br>
to effect the setting of the prepolymer on the wall<br>
4<br><br>
9253 PCT<br>
5        surface of the container.  This forms a coating,<br>
which is impermeable to liquids, such as water,<br>
milk, soft drinks, oils, etc.  This 249 patent also<br>
teaches in column 2, lines 4 5-62, that there is a<br>
lining method in which the interior wall surface of<br>
10        the container is lined with a thermoplastic film.<br>
The thermoplastic film is first laminated onto a<br>
blank and the blank is formed into a container.<br>
lioka, U.S. Patent Flo. 4,435/344 discloses a<br>
heat-insulating paper container where the outer and<br>
is        inner surfaces of the body member are extrusion<br>
coated or laminated with a thermoplastic synthetic<br>
resin film.  The resin film is converted into a<br>
 formed layer on the paper substrate and then the<br>
container is formed.  The result is a container with:<br>
20        good thermo-insulation properties.  This film<br>
preferably is polyethylene but as taught in column<br>
3, lines 50 - 55, this resin film cart be<br>
polypropylene, polyvinyl chloride, polystyrene,<br>
polyester, nylon and the like.<br>

insulating layer that can be made of the seme<br>
thermoplastic synthetic resin film is formed in the<br>
non-printed area of the outer surface.  The<br>

discloses a heat insulating paper cup where the body<br>
member is coated on its outside surface with, a<br>
foamed low density polyethylene, and on its inside<br>
surface with an unfoamed modified low density<br>
10        polyethylene.<br>
None of the containers of the prior art have a<br>
thin thermoplastic film fused to the inner and/or<br>
outer surfaces of a foam molded container for<br>
retaining food items such as coffee, soups, meats,<br>
15        and the like for the purpose of reducing the<br>
penetration of the liquid and/or the oil or fatty<br>
components in these food items through the foam<br>
container.<br>
SUMMARY__OF THE INVENTION<br>
20                                 The invention relates to a container suitable<br>
for use in retaining hot liquids such as coffee or<br>
water added to food items such as instant soups<br>
and/or stews.  A foam molded container made from<br>
expandable thermoplastic particles is formed, and an<br>
25         extruded or blown thin thermoplastic film is<br>
encircled at least ground the inside of the<br>
container, and the film is heat fused onto the inner<br>
surface of the sidewall of the container.<br>
Optionally, a thin thermoplastic film can be<br>
30        encircled around and heat fused onto the outer<br>
surface of the sidewall of the container, and<br>
optionally, a film can be heat fused to the inner<br>
and/or outer surfaces of the base of the container.<br>
The resultant container is impervious to leakage<br>
35         and/or stains caused by liquids and/or oily and<br>
fatty foods.  The film around the outer surface of<br>
6<br><br>
9253 PCT<br>
5        the sidewall of the container can also be used for<br>
labeling and printing purposes.<br>
The thermoplastic film is made of a polymer<br>
selected from the group consisting of solid<br>
polystyrene, rubber modified polystyrene, polymethyl<br>
10        methacrylate, rubber-modified polymethyl<br>
methacrylate, polypropylene, polyethylene,<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and mixtures<br>
thereof.  Additionally, one or more of these<br>
polymers can be blerided with a styrene/maleic<br>
15        anhydride copolymer.<br>
In the preferred embodiments of the invention,<br>
the polymer for the thermoplastic film is selected<br>
from the group consisting of solid polystyrene and<br>
rubber-modified polystyrene, i.e. a medium impact<br>
20        polystyrene resin, and a high impact polystyrene<br>
resin. The high impact polystyrene appears to give<br>
the best results.  The thickness of the<br>
thermoplastic film ranges from about 0.10 mil to<br>
about 5.0 mils, and preferably is about 1..0 mil, and<br>
25        extends substantially the depth of the container<br>
around the inner and/or outer surfaces of the<br>
sidewall of the container.<br>
Preferably, the thermoplastic film is fused to<br>
the inner and/or outer surfaces of the sidewall of<br>
30        the foam container via the same molding equipment<br>
used to form the foam container.  The thermoplastic<br>
film can optionally be fused to the inner and/or<br>
outer surfaces of the base of the formed container.<br>
The foam molded container is made of expandable<br>
35        thermoplastic resin beads, and in the preferred<br>
7<br><br>
5        embodiments, this expandable thermoplastic resin is<br>
expandable polystyrene particles (EPS).<br>
It is an object of the present invention to<br>
provide a thermoplastic foam container that exhibits<br>
improved resistance to leak-age and/or stain, and<br>
10        improved mechanical properties, such as improved- rim<br>
strength and surface hardness of the container.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention<br>
to provide a thermoplastic film fused to at least<br>
the inner surface of the sidewall of a formed foam<br>
15        container by heat and pressure, and optionally can<br>
be fused to the outer surface of the sidewall and/or<br>
to the surfaces of the base of the container.<br>
It is still a further object of the present<br>
invention to provide a thermoplastic container that<br>
20        is suitable for receiving hot liquids, such as<br>
coffee, hot water for instant soups, stews, etc and<br>
which thermoplastic container with its contents can<br>
be reheated in a microwave.<br>
25         DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the invention, 3 foam container, e.g., cups,<br>
bowls, and the like is molded from expandable<br>
thermoplastic particles.  These expandable<br>
thermoplastic particles are made front any suitable<br>
30        thermoplastic homopolymer or copolymer.<br>
Particularly suitable for use are homopolymers<br>
derived from vinyl aromatic monomers including<br>
styrene, isopropylstyrene, alpha-methylstyrene,<br>
nuclear methylstyrenes, chlorostymers, tert-<br>
35        butylstyrene, and the like, as well as copolymers<br>
prepared by the copolymeriation of at least one.<br><br>
9253 PCT<br><br>
5        vinyl aromatic monomer with monomers such as<br>
divinylbenzene, butadiene, alkyl methacrylates,<br>
alkyl acrylates, acrylonitrile, and maleic<br>
anhydride, wherein the vinyl aromatic monomer is<br>
present in at lease 50% by weight of the copolymer.<br>
10        Styrenic polymers are preferred, particularly<br>
polystyrene.  However, other suitable polymers may<br>
be used, such as polyolefins (e.g. polyethylene,<br>
polypropylene}, and polycarbonates (polyphenylene<br>
oxides, and mixtures thereof,<br>
15                                 In the preferred embodiments; the expandable<br>
thermoplastic particles are expandable polystyrene<br>
(EPS) particles.  These particles can be in the form<br>
of beads, granules, or other particles convenient<br>
for the expansion and molding operations.  Particles<br>
20        polymerized in an aqueous suspension process are<br>
essentially spherical and are preferred for molding<br>
the foam container of the invention.  These<br>
particles are screened so that their size ranges<br>
from about 0,008 to about 0.02 inch.<br>
25                                 These expandable thermoplastic particles are<br>
impregnated using any conventional method with a<br>
suitable blowing agent.  For example, the<br>
impregnation can be achieved by adding the blowing<br>
agent to the aqueous suspension during the<br>
30        polymerization of the polymer, or alternatively by<br>
re-suspending the polymer particles in an aqueous<br>
medium and then incorporating the blowing agent as<br>
taxtght in U.S. Patent No. 2,963,692 to D. Alelio.<br>
Any gaseous material or material which will produce<br>
35        gases on heating can be used as the blowing acfent.<br>
Conventional blowing agents include aliphatic<br><br>
9253 PCT<br>
5        hydrocarbons containing 4 to 6 carbon atoms in the<br>
molecule, such as butanes, pentanes, hexcanes, and<br>
the halogenated hydrocarbons, e.g. CFC's and HCFC'S,<br>
which boil at a temperature below the softening<br>
point of the polymer chosen. Mixtures of these<br>
10       aliphatic hydrocarbons blowing agents can also be<br>
used.<br>
Alternatively, water can be blended with these<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbons blowing agents or water can<br>
be used as the Sole blowing agent as taught in U.S.<br>
15        Patent Nos. 6, 127,432; 6,160,02-7; and 6,242,540<br>
assigned to NOVA, Chemicals (International) S.A.  In<br>
these patents, water-retaining agents are used.  The<br>
weight percentage of water for use as the blowing<br>
agent can range from 1 to 20%. The texts of U.S.<br>
20        Patent Nos. 6,127,4 39, 6,16 0,02 7 and 6, 242, 54 0 are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The imprecated thermoplastic particles are<br>
generally pre-expanded to a density of from about 2<br>
to about 12 pounds per cubic food.  The pre-<br>
25        expansion step is conventionally carried out by<br>
heating the impregnated beads via any conventional<br>
heating medium, such as steam, hot air, hot water,<br>
or radiant heat.  One generally accepted, method for<br>
accomplishing the pre-expansion of impregnated<br>
30        thermoplastic particles is taught in U.S. Patent NO-<br>
3,023,175 to Rodman.<br>
The impregnated thermoplastic particles can be<br>
foamed cellular polymer particles as taught in Arch<br>
et al. U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 10/021,716<br>
35       assigned to NOVA Chemicals Inc, the teachings of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.  The<br>
10<br><br>
9253 PCT<br>
5        foamed cellular particles are preferably polystyrene<br>
that are pre-expanded to a density of from about<br>
12.5 to about 34.3 pounds per cubic foot, and<br>
contain a volatile blowing agent level less than 6-0<br>
weight percent, preferably ranging from, about 2.0 wt<br>
10       % to about 5.0 wt %, and more preferably ranging<br>
from about 2.5 wt % to about 3,5 wt % based on the<br>
weight of the polymer.<br>
In a conventional manner, the pre-expanded<br>
particles or "pre-puff" are beated in a closed mold<br>
15       to further expand the pre-puff and to form the<br>
container of the invention.<br>
The thermoplastic film is made of a polymer<br>
selected from the group consisting of solid<br>
polystyrene, rubber modified polystyrene, polymethyl<br>
20        methacrylate, rubber-modified polymethyl<br>
methacrylate, polypropylene, polyethylene,<br>
polyethylene terephthalate (PET), and mixtures<br>
thereof.  Additionally, one of the preceding<br>
polymers can be blended with a styrene/maleic<br>
25        anhydride copolymer.  In the preferred embodiments<br>
of the invention, the polymer for the thetmoplastic<br>
film is selected front the group consisting of solid<br>
polystyrene and rubber-modified polystyrene, i..e. a.<br>
medium impact polystyrene resin and a high impact<br>
30        polystyrene resin.<br>
Polystyrene is a high molecular weight linear<br>
polymer produced by polymerising styrene.  When made<br>
from only the styrene monomer, the resulting polymer<br>
has a glass transition temperature of about 100ºC<br>
35       and is brittle, showing very poor strength i.e.<br>
elongation to rupture characteristics. It is known<br>
11<br><br>
9253 PCT<br>
5        that the strength characteristics can be improved by<br>
incorporating rubber modifiers such as butadiene<br>
rubber, which product is referred to as a medium<br>
impact polystyrene or a high impact polystyrene<br>
(HIPS), depending on the weight percent of rubber<br>
10       polymer incorporated into the styrene.  for the<br>
medium impact polyscyrene, the polystyrene ranges<br>
from about 95 to 98 weight percent and the rubber<br>
polymer ranges from about 2 to about 5 weight<br>
percent, based on the weight of the polystyrene<br>
15        resin.  For the high impact polystyrene, the<br>
polystyrene ranges from about 35 to about 95 weight<br>
percent and the rubber polymer ranges from about 5<br>
to about 15 weight percent, based on the weight of<br>
the polystyrene resin.<br>
20                               The process for making "HIPS" is well known to<br>
Chose skilled in the art.  Such known processes are<br>
exemplified in U.S. Patent No. 3,903,202 and U.S.<br>
Patent 4,146,559, the teachings of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.  The rubber is<br>
25        "dissolved" in the styrene monomer (actually the<br>
rubber is infinitely swollen with the monomer).  The<br>
resulting "solution" is fed to a reactor and with<br>
the use of a suitable initiator system<br>
polymerization occurs typically under shear. During<br>
30       the polymerization, the styrene is grafted to the<br>
rubber.  The grafting is thought to be necessary to<br>
provide the higher modulus and impact strength, as<br>
compared to simple blends of polystyrene and<br>
butadiene rubbers.  When the conversion of the<br>
35        styrene is about equal to the weight percent of the<br>
rubber in the system the phases invert, i.e. the<br>
12<br><br>
9253 PCT<br>
5        styrene/styrene polymer phase becomes continuous and<br>
the rubber phase becomes discontinuous.  After phase<br>
inversion the polymer is finished in a manner<br>
essentially similar to that for finishing<br>
polystyrene.<br>
10                           Preferably, the amount of rubber used in the<br>
high impact polystyrene film of the invention is<br>
about 8 weight percent and that used in medium<br>
impact polystyrene film is about 3 weight percent,<br>
based on the weight of the polystyrene resin.<br>
15                            Suitable rubbers for modifying the polystyrene<br>
are natural rubber, polybutadiene and its copolymers<br>
with styrene or other comonamers , i.e. styrene-<br>
butadiene copolymer rubber, polyisoprene and its<br>
copolymers with styrene or other comonomers, acrylic<br>
20       rubbers, EPDM rubbers, polybutylene and so on.<br>
Preferably, the rubber is polybutadiene or styrene-<br>
butadiene copolymer rubber.<br>
The particle distribution of the rubber in the<br>
polystyrene matrix is preferably unimodal.  The<br>
25        average rubber particle size ranges from about 0.5.<br>
microns to about 3 microns in size; preferably from<br>
about 1.0 micron to about 2.5 microns , more<br>
preferably from about 1 to about 2.0 micron; and<br>
most preferably from about 1.5 micron, to about 2.0<br>
_30        microns.   As is known to those skilled in the art,<br>
the particle sise of the rubber particles are<br>
generally controlled by the applied shear rate,<br>
heat, pressure, or a combination of these factors,<br>
during the stage of inversion of the polymerization<br>
35        when polystyrene becomes the continuous phase.<br>
12<br><br>
5                           Suitable rubber modified polystyrene particles<br>
are commercially available. Preferred among the<br>
commercial products of medium and high impact<br>
polystyrene are 5500, 5210, 4211, all available from<br>
NOVA Chemicals inc., 5100 Bainbridge Boulevard,<br>
to       Chesapeake, VA 23320.<br>
The rubber modified polystyrene particles may<br>
be in bead or pellet form and may include the<br>
cystomary ingredients and additives, such as<br>
pigments, colorants, plasticizers, mold release<br>
15        agents, stabilizers, ultraviolet light absorbers,<br>
and so on.  Typical pigments include, without<br>
limitation, inorganic pigments such as carbon black,<br>
zine oxide, titanium dioxide, and iron oxide, as<br>
well as organic pigmente such as quinacridone reds<br>
20        and violets and copper phthalocyanine blues and<br>
greens.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the thermoplastic film is comprised of<br>
general solid polystyrene, which also is available<br>
25        from NOVA Chemicals Inc., Beaver Valley Plant,<br>
Monaca, Pennsylvania.<br>
The thermoplastic film may be formed via an<br>
extrusion process or a blow molding process.<br>
Molding conditions may be the same as conditions<br>
30       usually employed for molding impact modified<br>
polystyrenes. Preferably, the thermoplastic film of<br>
the invention is extruded from a slot or a circulate<br>
die.<br>
Preferably, the thermoplastic film has an IZOD<br>
35       impact value ranging from about 50 to about 100 J/M<br>
14<br><br>
9253 PCT<br>
5       and an impact resistance greater than 1. 0 ft-<br>
lb/inch.<br>
The thermoplastic container can be a<br>
polystyrene cup that is fabricated by a conventional<br>
cup-forming machine that has an inner shell and an<br>
10       outer shell, for example, Cup Production MODEL 6-<br>
VLC-125 machine, made by Autonational B.V.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, after the<br>
cup or cups are molded, the thermoplastic film is<br>
formed into a cylinder and inserted into the cup,<br>
15       which, in turn is carried by a mandrel .  The inner<br>
shell is inserted into the cup, and heat and<br>
pressure is applied to the thermoplastic film to<br>
fuse the film to the inner surface of the side wall<br>
of the cup. The pressures for the inner shell against<br>
20       the thermoplastic film ranges from shout 20 to about<br>
80 pounds per square inch, preferably from about 30<br>
to about 50 pounds per square inch (psi).<br>
The fabrication rate for the film fusing<br>
operation for a single machine producing 10-ounce<br>
23       cups ranges from about 18 to 120 cups per minute.<br>
Several machines can be used to increase the<br>
production rate.  Heat is applied to the<br>
thermoplastic film by means of steam in order to<br>
melt the thermoplastic film and the adjacent<br>
30       polystyrene beads so that a cohesive effect occurs.<br>
between the inner surface of the sidewall of the cup<br>
and the thermoplastic film.  The temperature and<br>
time for this cohesion to occur may vary, for<br>
example., from about 60°C to about 120ºC for about 13<br>
35       to about 20 seconds.<br>
15<br><br>
9253 PCT<br>
5                           IC has been found that the thermoplastic film<br>
also increases the rim strength of the container,<br>
which, in effect, increases the overall strength of<br>
the container.  The rim strength is a measure of the<br>
force required (in kilograms) to cause the rim to<br>
10        crumble a one-fourth inch displacement from the<br>
opened edge of the container.<br>
Other embodiments of the invention involve the<br>
thermoplastic- film being fused to the inxier and/or<br>
outer surfaces of the sidewall and/or fused to the<br>
16       inner and/or outer surfaces of the base of the<br>
container.<br>
The invention is further illustrated, but not<br>
limited by, the following examples wherein all parts<br>
and percentages are by weight unless otherwise<br>
20       specified.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
This example illustrates the preparation of<br>
25       thermoplastic film lined containers. The NOVA<br>
Chemicals F2T1TU (expandable polystyrene)  cup beads<br>
blended with zinc stearate were pre-expanded in an<br>
11-gallon Rodman Steam pre-expandar (Artisan<br>
Industries Inc-l at atmospheric pressure. The pre-<br>
30       expansion was operated batch wise. The weight of the<br>
cup beads (i.e. 3.5 lbs.) was adjusted to make a<br>
pre-puff with a density ranging between 2,6 - 3.6<br>
pounds per cubic foot (pcf) . The newly prepared pre-<br>
puff was air dried for 5 minutes to remove the<br>
35       moisture and was allowed to age for about 4 hours<br>
before molding.<br>
16<br><br>
9253 PCT<br>
5                                 Six-ounce standard cups using different density<br>
aged pre-puff besds were molded. The steam header<br>
pressure used was 80 pounds per square inch (psi)<br>
and the total cycle time was in the range of 7.50 to<br>
8.25 seconds. The molded cups were allowed to age<br>
10        overnight.<br>
Pre-cut extruded polystyrene film (1.0 mil<br>
thickl wade from NOVA. Chemical PS 2110 (general<br>
solid polystyrene) resin was fused onto the inner<br>
surface of the sidewall of the cups in the same<br>
15       molder used for forming the cups. The header steam<br>
pressure used in the film fusion process was 45<br>
pounder per square inch and the total cycle time was<br>
5.55 seconds. The film-lined containers were stored<br>
overnight before testing.<br>
20                                 The cups with the varying density pre-puff<br>
beads, i.e. 3.47, 3.54 , 3.21, and 2.61 pcf, were<br>
tested by tha following method: Spicy oil at room<br>
temperature was poured into each container up to<br>
around 80% of the cup's height. The outside wall of<br>
25       each container containing the spicy oil was observed<br>
for oil stains and leakage every 10 minutes over the<br>
first l.5 hours., every 20 minutes in the time period<br>
from 1.5 hours to 6 hours, and, then, every hour up<br>
to a total of 48 hours.<br>
30                                 The average time failure (ATF) for each cup<br>
group sampling was calculated by adding the time to<br>
failure for each container, and dividing the total<br>
time by the number of containers tested.  Typically,<br>
ten cups of each group sampling were tested.  The<br>
35       maximum ATP value of 48 hours represents that none<br>
of the cups for each cup group sampling exhibited<br>
17<br><br>
9253 PCT<br>
5 any stain or leakage. The minimum ATP value of 0.17<br>
hours represents that all of the cups in. each of cup<br>
group sampling failed within the first 10 minutes.<br>
Each cup in each group sampling was tested for<br>
rim strength with and without a thermoplastic film<br>
10       and the average force was recorded.  Ten cups were<br>
tested in each group sampling.<br>
The results for the oil retention and the rim.<br>
strength are shown in Table l, As indicated in Table<br>
1, the cup samples with the thermoplastic film of<br>
15       the invention have an increased ATF and rim strength<br>
compared to the cup sample without the thermoplastic<br>
film.<br><br>
20)       Example 2<br>
The oil retention testing and the rim strength<br>
testing cor cups with a pre-puff density of 3.4 7 pcf<br>
were performed in a manner similar to that of<br>
Example 1. These results are shown in Table 2.  The<br>
25       polystyrene film was similar to that used in Example<br>
l and its thickness varied as shown in Table 2 .  As<br>
indicated in Table 2, the cup samples with the<br>
thermoplastic film of the invention have an<br>
18<br><br>
5       increased ATF and rim strength compared to the cup<br>
samples without the thermoplastic film.<br><br>
Example 3<br>
10                           The oil retention testing and the rim strength<br>
testing for cups with a pre-puff density of 3.50 pcf<br>
were performed in a manner similar to that of<br>
Example 1.  The thermoplastic film was similar to<br>
that used in Example 1 and was either extruded or<br>
15        blown as indicated in Table 3 .  The volume of the-<br>
EPS cups was changed from 6 ounces to 16 ounces. The:<br>
results are shown in Table 3 .  The samples with the<br>
thermoplastic film fabricated via an extrusion or a<br>
blown process have comparable testing results,<br>
20       Also, the samples with the thermoplastic film of the<br>
invention regardless of the process for making the<br>
thermoplastic film have an increased ATF and rim<br>
strength compared to the samples without the<br>
thermoplastic film.<br><br>
19<br><br>
9253 PCT<br><br>
Example 4<br>
In this Example, the polystyrene resin film was<br>
replaced with the thermoplastic materials indicated<br>
10        chersin.  NOVA PS 3500, 4211, 5500, and 5102 are the<br>
medium and high impact polystyrenes, all of which<br>
are discussed hereinabove.  As is indicated in Table<br>
4, the cup samples, with the thermoplastic film<br>
fabricated from the different thermoplastic<br>
15        materials have comparable ATF and rim strength<br>
values.<br><br>
The cups with the fused thermoplastic film of<br>
20       the above Examples have a generally uniform "rough"<br>
pr "bumpy" inner sidewall surface.  This is due in<br>
part to the fact that the film material when fused<br>
against the sidewall of the cup covers the voids<br>
formed by the expanded polystyrene beads during the<br>
25       mold processing of the cups and the applied<br>
temperature for this "fusing" process causes the<br>
expanded polystyrene beads to expand even further.<br>

retaining pre-packaged foods, e.g. instant noodles,<br>
soups, stews, chicken that are sold an the shelves<br>
in the grocery stores.  The container can be placed<br>
in the freezer, or in the microwave for reheating<br>
10       purposes without lessening the integrity of the<br>
container.<br>
