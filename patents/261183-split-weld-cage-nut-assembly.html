				<td>SPLIT WELD CAGE NUT ASSEMBLY BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention generally relates to a cage nut assembly, and more specifically relates to a cage nut assembly which is configured such that it meets torque requirements while having a relatively thin wall thickness.<br>
Cage nut assemblies are well known in the art and provide a useful function in that they are able to hold a threaded nut at locations in a frame that are difficult or in some cases impossible to reach. Cage nut assemblies are used in vehicles for seat attachments, radiator attachments, chassis to drive train attachments, and for any other nut application that requires the nut to have an "X" and "Y" axis adjustability.<br>
Currently, the thickness of the cage in these cage nut assemblies is determined by the amount of torque that the part can handle as the cage is not a continuous 360 degree connection, meaning that there is a seam/gap in the cage. Thus, to prevent the gap from expanding, the cage must have a material thickness which can take the full force of the torque. If sufficient thickness is not used, during driving torque, the nut will push out the side walls of the cage (thereby causing the seam to expand) until the nut is free to spin, stopping the nut bolt assembly. Thus, cage nut assemblies generally have cage walls which are excessively thick, for instance, a thickness of 2.0 millimeters at a minimum, in order to meet torque requirements.<br>
It would be advantageous to make a cage nut assembly which can accommodate the required torque with a relatively thin cage wall. It would also be advantageous to make a cage nut assembly which can be utilized in any desired application which requires an "X" and "Y" axis adjustability.<br>
OBJECTS AND SUMMARY<br>
A primary object of an embodiment of the present invention is to provide a cage nut assembly that has a relatively thin wall thickness, but which meets torque requirements in a desired application.<br>
Another object of an embodiment of the present invention is to provide a cage nut assembly which is relatively inexpensive to manufacture but which meets torque requirements in a desired application.<br>
Another object of an embodiment of the present invention is to provide a cage nut assembly which can be utilized in any nut application that requires the nut to have an "X" and "Y" axis adjustability.<br>
Briefly, and in accordance with the foregoing, embodiments of the present invention provide a cage member for a cage nut assembly. The cage member has protrusions stamped into the cage member material. At least one of the protrusions is formed in halves. These halves are stamped at the edge of the material exactly opposite of a mating half on the other side. When the cage member is wrapped around to its final position, the two halves butt up against each other to mimic a full protrusion. The other protrusions are not placed on the cage seam. A nut is in the cage member when the final cage member bending operation butts the two cage edges against each other.<br>
A cage member which is in accordance with an embodiment of the present invention can take many forms. For example, the cage member may have flanges on the end thereof which allow access to a nut encaged within the cage member and to allow positioning of the nut after welding of the cage member to the mating surface. The cage member may wrap around and join together with a dove-tail interlocking system. The cage member may provide that the protrusion is not split into halves but rather is off-set such that the protrusion is<br>
designed to interface with the wall of the cage member during the welding process.<br>

Attention is now directed to FIGURES 1-3 which illustrate a cage nut assembly 100 which is in accordance with a second embodiment of the present invention. The cage nut assembly 100 includes a nut member 102 and a cage member 104.<br>
The nut member 102 is best illustrated in FIGURE 3 and includes a rectangular block 106 having a generally planar upper surface 108, a generally planar lower surface 110 and sidewalls 112 which connect the upper and lower surfaces 108,110. The nut member 102 also includes a cylindrical member 114 which extends outwardly from the upper surface 108 of the nut member 102. The cylindrical member 114 is preferably in the form of a right circular cylinder. An aperture 116 extends through the nut member 102 from the block 106 into the cylindrical member 114. The aperture 116 maybe closed at the lower surface 110 of the block 106 or it may extend all the way through the block 106. The aperture 116 defines an aperture wall 118 which is preferably threaded and is capable of receiving a bolt or screw (not shown) to be attached thereto.<br>
The cage member 104 is best illustrated in FIGURES 1 and 2. The cage member 104 is used for encaging the nut member 102. Prior to encaging the nut member 102, the cage member 104 has generally planar upper and lower surfaces 120,122. The cage member 104 includes a base portion 124 and bendable first and second arm portions 126,128 extending from opposite ends of the base portion 124. The first and second arm portions 126, 128 are<br>
preferably integrally formed with the base portion 124.<br>
An aperture 130 is provided through the base portion 124 of the cage member 104 and the first and second arms 126, 128 have generally semicircular cutouts 132,134 at their free ends 136,138.<br>
The first and second arms 126,128 have dimples 140,142 provided on the lower surface 122 thereof which are formed from a stamping process and which extend outwardly from the lower surface 122 thereof. The dimples 140,142 are provided between the semicircular cutouts 132, 134 and the edges 144,146 of the arms 126,128.<br>
The first and second aims 126, 128 have half-dimples 148,150 provided on the lower surface 122 thereof at the free ends 136,138 of the arms 126,128. The half-dimples 148, 150 are formed from a stamping process and extend outwardly from the lower surface 122 of the arms 126,128. The half-dimples 148,150 are provided between the semicircular cutouts 132,134 and the edges 152,154 of the arms 126,128.<br>
In operation, the cylindrical member 114 of the nut member 102 is positioned through the aperture 130 of the cage member 104 such that the upper surface 108 of the nut member 102 is abutted against the upper surface 120 of the base portion 124 of the cage member 104. The first and second arms 126,128 are then bent around opposite sidewalls 110 of the nut member 102 and onto the lower surface 110 of the nut member 102 to form the cage nut assembly 100.<br>
The free ends 136, 138 of the arms 126, 128 then abut against one another such that the half-dimples 148,150 abut against one another and the semicircular cutouts 132,134 are in communication with one another to form a circular cutout 156.<br>
Because the arms 126,128 abut at their free ends 136,138, the cage member 104 effectively encages the nut member 102. The cage member 104 and the aperture 130 are sized so that the nut member 102 has a limited range of movement in at least one dimension, and preferably in two dimensions, for example the "X" and "Y" axes as illustrated in FIGURE 2. The circular cutout 156 is provided in the cage member 104 to allow access to the aperture 116 of the nut member 102 through the lower surface 110 thereof, within the range of movement of the nut member 102.<br>
Once the cage nut assembly 100 is formed, the cage nut assembly 100 must then be attached to a mating surface 157. The cage nut assembly 100 is positioned on the mating surface 157 such that the dimples 140,142,148, 150 are in contact with the mating surface 157.

The half-dimples 248b, 250b are provided between the semicircular cutouts 232, 234 and the edges 252, 254 of the arms 226, 228.<br>
In operation, the cylindrical member 214 of the nut member 202 is positioned through<br>
the aperture 230 of the cage member 204 such that the upper surface 208 of the nut member 202 is abutted against the upper surface 220 of the base portion 224 of the cage member 204. The first and second arms 226, 228 are then bent around opposite sidewalls 210 of the nut member 202 and onto the lower surface 210 of the nut member 202 to form the cage nut assembly 200.<br>
The free ends 236, 238 of the arms 226,228 then abut against one another such that the half-dimples 148a, 150a abut against one another, the half-dimples 148b, 150b abut against one another, and the semicircular cutouts 232, 234 are in communication with one another to form a circular cutout 256.<br>
Because the arms 226, 228 abut at their free ends 236,238, the cage member 204 effectively encages the nut member 202. The cage member 204 and the aperture 230 are sized so that the nut member 202 has a limited range of movement in at least one dimension, and preferably in two dimensions, for example the "X" and "Y" axes as illustrated in FIGURE 4. The circular cutout 256 is provided in the cage member 204 to allow access to the aperture 216 of the nut member 202 through the lower surface 210 thereof, within the range of movement of the nut member 202.<br>
Once the cage nut assembly 200 is formed, the cage nut assembly 200 must then be attached to a mating surface 257. The cage nut assembly 200 is positioned on the mating surface 257 such that the dimples 240,242,248a, 248b, 250a, 250b are in contact with the mating surface 257. The cage nut assembly 200 is then welded to the mating surface 257 with the assistance of the dimples 240,242. During the welding, the free-ends 236,238 are welded together to form a welded seam 258. The half-dimples 248a, 250a; 248b, 250b also assist in the welding of the cage nut assembly 200 to the mating surface 257 and the half- dimples 248a, 250a are welded together to form a welded dimple 260a and the half-dimples<br>
248b, 250b are welded together to form a welded dimple 260b.<br>

The half-dimples 348, 350 are provided between the semicircular cutouts 332,334 and the edges 352, 354 of the arms 326, 328.<br>
In operation, the first and second arms 326,328 are bent such that the free ends 336, 338 of the arms 326,328 abut against one another such that the half-dimples 348, 350 abut against one another and the semicircular cutouts 332,334 are in communication with one another to form a circular cutout 356.<br>
The nut member 302 is then slid into the cage member 304 at the end of the cage member 304 where the L-shaped flange 364 is provided for such that the upper surface 108 of the nut member 302 is facing the upper surface 320 of the base portion 324 of the cage member 304. The L-shaped flange 362 prevents the nut member 302 from sliding out of the<br>
cage member 302. Once the nut member 302 is positioned within the cage member 304, the L-shaped flange 364 is bent to prevent the nut member 302 from sliding out of the cage member 302, thus effectively encaging the nut member 302 within the cage member 304 and forming the cage nut assembly 300, as best illustrated in FIGURE 7.<br>
The cage member 304 is sized so that the nut member 302 has a limited range of movement in at least one dimension, and preferably in two dimensions, for example the "X" and "Y" axes as illustrated in FIGURE 7. The circular cutout 356 is provided in the cage member 304 to allow access to the aperture 316 of the nut member 302 through the lower surface 310 thereof, within the range of movement of the nut member 302.<br>
Once the cage nut assembly 300 is formed, the cage nut assembly 300 must then be attached to a mating surface 357. The cage nut assembly 300 is positioned on the mating surface 357 such that the dimples 340, 342, 348, 350 are in contact with the mating surface 357. The cage nut assembly 300 is then welded to the mating surface 357 with the assistance of the dimples 340, 342. During the welding, the free-ends 336,338 are welded together to fomi a welded seam 358. The half-dimples 348, 350 also assist in the welding of the cage nut assembly 300 to the mating surface 357 and are welded together to form a welded dimple 360.<br>
It should be noted that the cage nut assembly 300 could also be formed to have four dimples, similar to that disclosed in the second embodiment of the cage nut assembly 200, rather than three dimples.<br>

The nut member 402 also includes a cylindrical member 414 which extends outwardly from the upper surface 408 of the nut member 402. The cylindrical member 414 is preferably in the form of a right circular cylinder. An aperture 416 extends through the nut member 402 from the block 406 into the cylindrical member 414. The aperture 416 may be closed at the lower surface 410 of the block 406 or it may extend all the way through the block 406. The aperture 416 defines an aperture wall 418 which is preferably threaded and is capable of receiving a bolt or screw (now shown) to be attached thereto.<br>
The cage member 404 is best illustrated in FIGURES 10-11. The cage member 404 is used for encaging the nut member 402. Prior to encaging the nut member 402, the cage member 404 has generally planar upper and lower surfaces 420, 422. The cage member 404 includes a base portion 424 and bendable first and second arm portions 426, 428 extending from opposite ends of the base portion 424. The first and second arm portions 426,428 are preferably integrally formed with the base portion 424.<br>
The cage member 404 further includes a pair of flanges 462,464 which extend from opposite ends of the base portion 424, but not the opposite ends from which the arm portions 426,428 extend from the base portion 424. The flange 462 extends perpendicularly upwardly from the base portion 424 and extends substantially between the arm portions 426,428. The flange 464 is L-shaped such that it has a first portion 470 which extends perpendicularly outwardly from the base portion 424 proximate to the first arm portion 426, and a second portion 472 which extends perpendicularly from the first portion 470 toward the second arm portion 428. The L-shaped flange 464 is bendable. The flanges 462,464 are preferably integrally formed with the base portion 424 of the cage member 404.<br>
An aperture 430 is provided through the base portion 424 of the cage member 404 and the first and second arms 426,428 have generally semicircular cutouts 432,434 at their free ends 436,438.<br>

The first and second arms 426, 42S have half-tabs 448,450 provided on the lower surface 422 thereof at the free ends 436,438 of the arms 426,428. The half-tabs 448,450 extend outwardly from the lower surface 422 of the arms 426,428. The half-tabs 448,450 are provided between the semicircular cutouts 432,434 and the edge 452, 454 of the arms 426,428.<br>
In operation, the cylindrical member 414 of the nut member 402 is positioned through the aperture 430 of the cage member 404 such that the upper surface 408 of the nut member 402 is abutted against the upper surface 420 of the base portion 424 of the cage member 404. The first and second arms 426, 428 are bended around opposite sidewalls 412 of the nut member 402 and onto the lower surface 410 of the nut member 402 to form the cage nut assembly 400.<br>
The free ends 436,438 of the arms 426,428 then abut against one another such that the half-tabs 448,450 abut against one another and the semicircular cutouts 432, 434 are in communication with one another to form a circular cutout 456. The tabs 440,442 extend outwardly from the lower surface 422 of the cage member 404 at the bend of the first and second arms 426,428 around the lower surface 410 of the nut member 402 such that the tabs 440,442 extend in an opposite direction as does the cylindrical member 414 of the nut<br>
member 402.<br>
Because the arms 426, 428 abut at their free ends 436,438, the cage member 404 effectively encages the nut member 402. The cage member 404 and the aperture 430 are sized so that the nut member 402 has a limited range of movement in at least one dimension, and preferably in three dimensions, for example the "X", "Y" and "Z" axes as illustrated in FIGURE 11. The circular cutout 456 is provided in the cage member 404 to allow access to the aperture 416 of the nut member 402 through the lower surface 410 thereof, within the range of movement of the nut member 402.<br>
Once the cage nut assembly 400 is formed, the cage nut assembly 400 must then be attached to a mating surface 457. The cage nut assembly 400 is positioned on the mating surface 457 such that the tabs 440,442,448,450 are in "contact with the mating surface 457. The cage nut assembly 400 is then welded to the mating surface 457 with the assistance of the tabs 440,442. During the welding, the free-ends 436,438 are welded together to form a welded seam 458. The half-tabs 448,450 also assist in the welding of the cage nut assembly 400 to the mating surface 457 and are welded together to form a welded tab 460.<br>
It should be noted that the nut member 402 could be formed without the cylindrical member 414 and the cage member 404 sized so that the nut member 402 has a limited range of movement in at least one direction, and preferably in two dimensions, for example the "X" and "Y" axes as illustrated in FIGURE 11.<br>
It should further be noted that the cage nut assembly 400 could also be formed to have four tabs, similar to that disclosed in the second embodiment of the cage nut assembly 200, except with dimples, rather than three tabs.<br>
