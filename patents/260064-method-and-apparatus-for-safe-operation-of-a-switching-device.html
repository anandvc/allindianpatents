 Description<br>
Method and apparatus for safe operation of a switching device<br>
The present invention relates to a method for safe operation of<br>
a switching device as claimed in the precharacterizing clause<br>
of claim 1, and to a corresponding apparatus as claimed in the<br>
precharacterizing clause of claim 9.<br>
Switching devices, in particular low-voltage switching devices,<br>
can be used to switch the current paths between an electrical<br>
supply device and loads, and therefore to switch their<br>
operating currents. This means that the switching device opens<br>
and closes current paths, allowing the connected loads to be<br>
safely connected and disconnected.<br>
An. electrical low-voltage switching device, such as a<br>
contactor, a circuit breaker or a compact starter, has one or<br>
more so-called main contacts, which can be controlled by one or<br>
else more control magnets, in order to switch the current<br>
paths. In principle, in this case, the main contacts comprise a<br>
moving contact link and fixed contact pieces, to which the<br>
loads and the supply device are connected. In order to close<br>
and open the main contacts, an appropriate connection or<br>
disconnection signal is passed to the control magnets, in<br>
response to which their armatures act on the moving contact<br>
links such that the latter carry out a relative movement with<br>
respect to the fixed contact pieces, and either close or open<br>
the current paths to be switched.<br>
Appropriately designed contact surfaces are provided in order<br>
to improve the contact between the contact pieces and the<br>
contact links at points at which the two meet one another.<br>
These contact surfaces are composed of materials such as silver<br>
alloys, which are applied at these points<br><br>
 both to the contact link and to the contact pieces, and have a<br>
specific thickness.<br>
The materials of the contact surfaces are subject to wear<br>
during every switching process. Factors which can influence<br>
this wear are:<br>
•	increasing contact erosion or contact wear as the number<br>
of connection and disconnection processes increases,<br>
•	increasing deformation,<br>
•	increasing contact corrosion caused by arcing, or<br>
•	environmental influences, such as vapors or suspended<br>
particles, etc.<br>
This results in the operating currents no longer being safely<br>
switched, which can lead to current interruptions, contact<br>
heating or to contact welding.<br>
For example, particularly as the contact erosion increases, the<br>
thickness of the materials applied to the contact surfaces will<br>
decrease. The switching movement between the contact surfaces<br>
of the contact link and contact pieces therefore becomes<br>
longer, thus in the end reducing the contact force on closing.<br>
As the number of switching processes increases, this results in<br>
the contacts no longer closing correctly. The resultant current<br>
interruptions or else the increased connection bouncing can<br>
then lead to contact heating and thus to increasing melting of<br>
the contact material, which can in turn then lead to welding of<br>
the contact surfaces of the main contacts.<br>
If a main contact of the switching device has become worn or<br>
even welded, the switching device can no longer safely<br>
disconnect the load. In particular in the case of a welded<br><br>
 contact, at least the current path with the welded main contact<br>
will still continue to carry current and will still be live,<br>
despite the disconnection signal, so that the load is not<br>
completely isolated from the supply device. Since, in<br>
consequence, the load remains in a non-safe state, the<br>
switching device represents a potential fault source. In the<br>
case of compact starters according to IEC 60 947-6-2, for<br>
example, in which the protection mechanism acts on the same<br>
switching point as the electromagnetic drive during normal<br>
switching, this can thus result in the protective function<br>
being blocked. Fault sources such as these in particular must,<br>
however, be avoided for safe operation of switching devices,<br>
and therefore for protection of the load and of the electrical<br>
installation.<br>
The object of the present invention is to identify such<br>
potential fault sources, and to react appropriately to them.<br>
This object is achieved by the method having the features of<br>
claim 1, and by the apparatus having the features of claim 9.<br>
The present invention allows contact welding during<br>
disconnection and thus the fact that the operation of the<br>
switching device is no longer safe to be identified with little<br>
complexity, in order to allow the situation to be reacted to<br>
appropriately.<br>
 According to the invention, a movement distance difference<br>
which the armature travels after connection or disconnection is<br>
identified for this purpose, and means are initiated for<br>
breaking open welded main contacts, that is to say closed main<br>
contacts, by means of an initiation device when the identified<br>
movement distance difference is less than a predetermined value<br>
and a specific time period has elapsed after disconnection.<br><br>
The predetermined value will in this case correspond to a<br>
determined movement distance difference at which the contact<br>
link when the control magnet is disconnected is just still<br>
connected to the contact<br><br>
 pieces, so that it can be assumed that welding has occurred. In<br>
this case, the movement distance difference can be determined<br>
directly adjacent to the armature, or else adjacent to the<br>
contact link which is operatively connected to the armature, or<br>
adjacent to the means which produce this operative connection.<br>
This identification of the movement distance difference may,<br>
for example, be carried out by means of a connection between<br>
the armature and the initiation lever, for example by means of<br>
a mechanical coupling device, which no longer exerts any force<br>
on the initiation lever when the movement distance difference<br>
traveled by the armature is not less than the predetermined value.<br>
If the movement distance difference traveled by the armature<br>
after a predetermined time period has elapsed is less than this<br>
predetermined value, then it can be assumed that welding has<br>
occurred, and therefore that the operation of the switching<br>
device is not safe. These welded main contacts can be broken<br>
open again, and thus opened, by the initiation of appropriate<br>
means for breaking open the welded main contacts. In addition,<br>
the non-safe operation of the switching device can be indicated<br>
by further measures, such as disconnection of the switching<br>
device and/or production of appropriate warning signals.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments and preferred developments of<br>
the invention are specified in the dependent claims.<br>
The invention as well as advantageous exemplary embodiments of<br>
it will be described in more detail in the following text with<br>
reference to the following figures, in which:<br>
Figure 1 shows a simplified flowchart of the method according<br>
to the invention,<br>

to the invention,<br>

Figure 4 shows a third embodiment of the apparatus according<br>
to the invention,<br><br>
 Figure 5 shows a fourth embodiment of the apparatus according<br>
to the invention,<br>
Figures 6,7 show schematic illustrations of the time profiles<br>
of characteristic variables relating to Figure 2 and<br>
Figure 3,<br>
Figure 8 shows a fifth embodiment of the apparatus according<br>
to the invention with a delayed checking element in<br>
an on position of a switching device,<br>
Figure 9 shows the fifth embodiment as shown in Figure 8, with<br>
the delayed checking element in an OFF position of<br>
the switching device, and<br>
Figure 10 shows the fifth embodiment as shown in Figure 8, with<br>
the delayed checking element in a "welded" position<br>
of the switching device.<br>
As illustrated in Figure 1, the two following steps are<br>
essentially carried out in the method according to the<br>
invention:<br>
step a) identification of a movement distance difference which<br>
the armature or a component which is mechanically<br>
connected to the armature(120) travels after<br>
connection or disconnection, and<br>
step b) initiation of means for breaking open welded main<br>
contacts by means of an initiation device when the<br>
identified movement distance difference is less than a<br>
predetermined value and a specific time period has<br>
elapsed after disconnection.<br>
The idea on which the method according to the invention is<br>
based is in this case that the initiation device has a<br>
predetermined time inertia and thus a response time, which is<br>
also referred in the following text as the required initiation<br><br>
 time, which is greater during normal switching operation than<br>
an initiation time window defined by the complete armature<br>
movement. The initiation time window is used synonymously for<br>
the disconnection time in the following text. This ensures<br><br>
that initiation takes place only in the case of contact<br>
welding, specifically when the armature travels through only a<br>
short movement distance difference, owing to the contacts being<br>
welded, after a time period defined by the predetermined<br>
inertia.<br>
This initiation process allows appropriate means, that is to<br>
say a force energy store such as a latching mechanism, to be<br>
unlocked in order to break open the welded main contact or<br>
contacts. In addition, a further switching element can be<br>
provided, which blocks further operation of the switching<br>
device in the event of initiation, thus blocking the switching<br>
device until it has been reset. The blocking of normal<br>
switching can furthermore be indicated and/or processed further<br>
by means of a display, by means of a mechanical indication and<br>
reset element, by means of a signaling contact or via a data<br>
bus.<br>
Various embodiments of the apparatus according to the invention<br>
will be described in more detail in the following text using<br>
the example of a contactor.<br>
During fault-free and therefore safe operation of the switching<br>
device, during normal disconnection of the control magnet 110,<br>
which is illustrated by way of example in Figure 2, the magnet<br>
armature 120 will move in the opening direction after the<br>
magnetic force FM has fallen below the value of a spring<br>
opening force in the opposite direction to a tension spring<br>
130. After an opening movement of a few millimeters, for<br>
example 2 mm, the mechanical operating elements which are<br>
coupled to the armature 120, but are not illustrated in any<br>
more detail here, strike the contact link of the main contact<br>
or contacts of the switching device. As the opening movement of<br>
the magnet armature 120 continues further, the contact link is<br>
moved to its final open position. The entire armature movement<br><br>
distance Δx from the connected position with the main contact<br>
closed to the disconnected position with the main contact open<br>
may thus be about 6 mm. A typical opening speed of between<br>
0.5 m/s and 2 m/s is reached during the accelerated opening<br>
movement of the magnet armature 120 from the connected position<br>
to the disconnected position in the case of circuit breakers<br>
and contactors. In the<br><br>
event of contact welding, the opening movement of the armature<br>
in the present example is braked abruptly after an opening<br>
movement of 2 mm. After a further opening movement of perhaps<br>
one millimeter, the armature movement is then stopped<br>
completely, once the mechanical play has been overcome and the<br>
deformation has formed.<br>
The difference Δx in the armature movement distance between the<br>
unwelded case and welded state of the contacts is thus about<br>
3 mm. This movement distance difference Δx is then traveled,<br>
for example, in 1.5 ms in the non-welded case, which corresponds to a speed of v = 2 m/s, or in 6 ms, which<br>
corresponds to a speed of v = 0.5 m/s. If this movement<br>
distance difference Δx is regarded as a mechanical initiation<br>
window, then this corresponds to an initiation time window with<br>
a time duration of 1.5 ms or 6 ms. The inert initiation<br>
mechanism must therefore satisfy the condition of not<br>
responding during this short time window during safe operation.<br>
A first embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention<br>
will now be explained with reference to Figure 2.<br>
In this case, the apparatus has an initiation lever 150, which<br>
is mounted such that it can rotate, as the initiation device.<br>
This initiation lever 150 is held captive without contact being<br>
made by the magnetic force FM of a permanent magnet 151, which<br>
is firmly connected to the initiation lever 150, against a<br>
counteracting force FF of an initiation spring 170 on a movable<br>
ferromagnetic slotted link 160. The ferromagnetic slotted link<br>
160 consists of a metal sheet with a recess 161 and, during a<br>
closing and opening movement, is moved together with the magnet<br>
armature 120, by being coupled 140 to it. The permanent magnet<br>
151 and the slotted link 160 are now positioned with respect to<br>
one another such that, in the event of contact welding, that is<br>
to say an armature movement of a few millimeters, the slotted-<br><br>
link recess 161 is opposite the permanent magnet 151 so that<br>
its magnetic holding force FM falls below the value of the<br>
initiation spring force of the spring 170 in the opposite<br>
direction. This means that the<br><br>
holding force FM only decreases when the slotted-link recess<br>
161 is opposite the permanent magnet 151, because the armature<br>
has traveled through only a movement distance difference Δx which is less than a specific value, in the present example<br>
3 mm. Since, as a result of the welding, the slotted link 160<br>
does not move any further, there is a continuous excess force<br>
from the initiation spring 170, so that, once the time period<br>
predetermined by the time inertia has elapsed, the initiation<br>
lever 150 is moved to the initiation position, and, for<br>
example, a latching mechanism 180 is therefore unlatched.<br>
The contact welding can then be broken open by a<br>
correspondingly high spring force of the latching mechanism<br>
180, which acts on the main contact, as a result of which the<br>
armature 120 is moved with the contact links to the<br>
disconnected position. In this situation, in which the latching<br>
mechanism 180 moves to a disconnected position or initiation<br>
position, it may be expedient to link this latching-mechanism<br>
position with disconnection of the control circuit for the<br>
magnet drive 110 in order to protect the switching device<br>
against further operation, for fault identification. The<br>
initiation lever 150 is then reset again to the state in which<br>
it is held against the ferromagnetic slotted link 160 by the<br>
magnetic force FM of the permanent magnet 151, with the<br>
initiation apparatus for further safe operation therefore being<br>
interlocked, only by means of active acknowledgement or<br>
resetting, for example in the course of a maintenance measure<br>
on the switching device.<br>
In addition, as is illustrated in Figure 2, it is possible to<br>
provide for the initiation function for overcoming contact<br>
welding to be inhibited during connection of the magnet drive<br>
110. By way of example, this makes it possible to avoid the<br>
problem that the initiation time window is greater than the<br>
response time of the initiation mechanism owing to the low<br><br>
armature closing speed. This makes it possible to avoid<br>
spurious initiation. For this purpose, the initiation lever 150<br>
is held in the "non-initiated position" by means of an<br>
additional magnet coil 190, which is switched on at the same<br>
time as the magnet drive 110.<br><br>
In addition, it is possible to provide for the time inertia of<br>
the initiation mechanism to be increased during the<br>
disconnection process by the magnet coil 190 still being<br>
energized with current after interruption of the supply voltage<br>
and thus of the control voltage by means of a charge capacitor<br>
for a limited time, during which the slotted-link window passes<br>
the permanent magnet.<br>
As a further embodiment variant, additional holding of the<br>
initiation lever 150 during connection of the magnet drive 110<br>
can be achieved by the magnetic stray field (which is not<br>
illustrated in any more detail) of the armature air gap<br>
exerting a holding force FM on a component which is connected<br>
to the initiation lever 150. In the case of constant-field<br>
magnetic excitation, this may be the permanent magnet 151 of<br>
the initiation lever 150 and, in the case of magnetic<br>
alternating-field excitation, it may be an additional<br>
ferromagnetic component, fitted to the initiation lever 150.<br>
Figure 3 shows a second embodiment of the apparatus according<br>
to the invention. The entire armament movement distance from<br>
the connected position to the disconnected position is<br>
considered to be the mechanical initiation window in this case.<br>
An initiation time window with a width of, for example,<br>
10-20 milliseconds corresponds to this if, in the example of<br>
the contactor, the mean opening speed of the armature is<br>
between 0.3 m/s and 0.6 m/s. The initiation time window can<br>
also be increased by the decay time of the magnetic field after<br>
the disconnection command from the control circuit. As in the<br>
case of Figure 2, the inert initiation mechanism from Figure 3<br>
must therefore satisfy the condition of not responding during<br>
this initiation time window.<br>
For this purpose, the initiation mechanism contains a blocking<br>
device, such as a blocking lever 240, which can be operated by<br><br>
the magnet armature 220 of the magnet drive 210 used for normal<br>
operation, and an initiation device, such as an initiation<br>
lever 250, which is operated by an additional actuator 270. The<br>
blocking device 240 and the initiation device 250 are linked<br><br>
to one another in such a way that initiation is possible only<br>
in the unblocked state. One option for doing this is for the<br>
blocking lever 240 and the initiation lever 250 to form a<br>
mechanical unit, and for the blocking force FAN of the magnet<br>
armature 220 to be considerably greater than the initiation<br>
force FAK of the actuator 270. Alternatively, the blocking<br>
lever 240, the initiation lever 250 and the mechanical<br>
operative connection, which is shown in the form of a dashed-<br>
dotted arrow in Figure 3, to the plunger-type armature 274 of<br>
the additional armature 270 may be in the form of a mechanical<br>
unit. In order to prevent initiation when welding has not<br>
occurred, the initiation device 250 must be blocked by the<br>
magnet armature 220 before the actuator 270 attempts<br>
initiation. The initiation time window is in this case too<br>
short for initiation by means of the actuator 270. The actuator<br>
270 is for this purpose provided with an inert response for the<br>
disconnection process. In this case, a magnetic initiator of<br>
known design can be used as the actuator 270.<br>
In the case of a contactor with a DC magnet drive, the inert<br>
response of this magnetic initiator 270 can be produced by<br>
means of a freewheeling circuit, that is to say by means of a<br>
freewheeling diode 271 connected in parallel with the magnetic<br>
initiator 270. The control circuits for the DC magnet drive 210<br>
and for the magnetic initiator 270 are in this case<br>
electrically decoupled from one another, for example by means<br>
of a diode circuit. During connection of the magnetic drive<br>
210, the magnetic initiator 270 is connected at the same time,<br>
and the magnetic initiator armature 274 is in this case moved<br>
to the non-initiation position, where it is mechanically held<br>
against the initiator spring 275 for as long as the armature<br>
220 also remains in the connected state. During disconnection<br>
of the DC magnet drive 210, the magnetic initiator 270 is<br>
disconnected at the same time. The freewheeling circuit 271,<br>
276 delays the decay of the magnetic field on the magnetic<br><br>
initiator 270, and the magnetic initiator armature 274 drops<br>
out only after a delay time. An addition delay is achieved in<br>
that a charge capacitor 273, which is connected in parallel<br>
with the freewheeling circuit 271, 276, still supplies the<br>
magnetic initiator 270 with a voltage<br><br>
for a predetermined time period via the disconnection signal of<br>
the magnet drive 210.<br>
Figures 6 and 7 show the corresponding diagrams for the forces<br>
acting after disconnection and, respectively, the switch<br>
position after disconnection for the two embodiments<br>
illustrated in Figure 2 and Figure 3. In this case, the upper<br>
diagram in Figure 6, in particular, shows the force/time<br>
diagram for the first embodiment, as illustrated in Figure 2,<br>
during normal operation, that is to say operation without<br>
welding, and the lower diagram in Figure 6 shows the force/time<br>
diagram during faulty operation, that is to say welded<br>
operation. In a corresponding manner, the upper diagram in<br>
Figure 7 shows the switch position of the embodiment<br>
illustrated in Figure 3 during normal operation, and the lower<br>
diagram in Figure 7 shows the same embodiment during faulty<br>
operation. The time period which must elapse in this case for<br>
the method according to the invention and for the apparatus<br>
according to the invention is annotated with I here.<br>
Figure 4 shows a third embodiment as an alternative to the<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 3, with the contactor being<br>
equipped with an AC magnet drive 310. The control circuit for<br>
the magnetic initiator 370 is in this case connected via a<br>
bridge rectifier 372 to the control circuit of the AC magnet<br>
drive 310, and the inert response of the magnetic initiator 370<br>
can once again be produced by means of a freewheeling diode<br>
371. In order to additionally delay the magnetic initiator 370<br>
a charge capacitor 373 can also be connected in parallel with<br>
the freewheeling circuit 371, 376 in this case. In the circuit<br>
shown in Figure 4, the AC magnet drive 310 uses the circuit of<br>
the magnetic initiator 370 as a type of freewheeling circuit<br>
371, 376 during disconnection of the control circuit, thus<br>
leading to the magnet armature 374 of the magnet drive 310<br>
dropping out with a delay. In order to restrict this delay, a<br><br>
limiting resistor 374 is provided in the initiator circuit. The<br>
time constant T of the magnetic-field decay during<br>
disconnection of the AC magnet<br><br>
drive 310 is then governed by the time period which is defined<br>
by the relationship:<br>
T = (Lmagnet drive + Linitiator )/ (Rmagnet drive + Rinitiator + R) •<br>
Figure 5 shows a fourth embodiment of an apparatus for safe<br>
operation of a switching device. In this case, the initiation<br>
device 450 in fact acts during connection of the normal<br>
switching device drive 410.<br>
An actuator 470 is provided for this purpose, which is driven<br>
virtually at the same time as the connection signal and whose<br>
pulse duration is limited by time control to a predetermined<br>
time period, for example of 1 ms to 10 ms. Time control such as<br>
this is known to those skilled in the art, both in analog<br>
electronics and in digital electronics. A square-wave signal<br>
can thus be generated from or for the connection signal of the<br>
control magnet 410, on whose rising signal flank a single<br>
voltage pulse of predetermined time duration is produced. The<br>
time duration, which is predetermined by the time control, or<br>
at least a substantial part of it, is referred to as the<br>
response time of the actuator 470. During the response time,<br>
the actuator 470 can receive sufficient energy for initiation<br>
against the actuator holding spring 475 and the latching<br>
mechanism latching, if it can move without impediment in the<br>
initiation direction.<br>
In the event of contact welding, that is to say when the<br>
actuator 470 is not blocked, this actuator 470 releases the<br>
latching mechanism 480 without any delay during connection of<br>
the normal switching device drive 410. In this case, the<br>
mechanical initiation window is governed by the movement<br>
distance difference Δx between the disconnected position and<br>
the welded position of the moving drive component, and the<br>
initiation time window is greater than the predetermined<br>
response time of the actuator 470.<br><br>
When the contacts are not welded, the length of the mechanical<br>
initiation window is governed by the movement distance<br>
difference Δx between the disconnected position and the<br>
instantaneous position of the moving drive component during the<br>
drive pulse. This mechanical initiation time window is passed<br>
through by the actuator 470 in a time which is shorter than the<br>
response time of the actuator 470, so that sufficient energy<br>
for initiation of the latching mechanism 480 is not received.<br>
Figure 8 shows a fifth embodiment of the apparatus according to<br>
the invention with a delayed checking element 501 in an on<br>
position of a switching device. The apparatus according to the<br>
invention has a checking element 501 as the initiation device<br>
which, after disconnection of the switching device and after a<br>
specific time period has elapsed, determines the movement<br>
distance difference Δx traveled by an auxiliary contact slide<br>
502. In this case, the auxiliary contact slide 502 is<br>
mechanically operatively connected to an armature, which is not<br>
shown in any more detail, of a control magnet or<br>
electromagnetic drive. During connection of the switching<br>
device, the auxiliary contact slide 502 moves downwards, in the<br>
illustrated Figure 8, with the armature, in order to open the<br>
main contacts. The two switch positions of the switching device<br>
are annotated with the words "ON" and "OFF" in order to<br>
illustrate this. The distance between these two switch<br>
positions corresponds to the movement distance difference Δx <br>
traveled. The checking element 501 is once again designed<br>
according to the invention to initiate means 505-508 to break<br>
open welded main contacts when the movement distance difference <br>
Δx traveled is less than a predetermined value.<br>
In the example shown in Figure 8, the checking element 501 is<br>
in the form of an actuator, in particular a solenoid, which,<br>
when current is passed via the electrical connections A that<br>
are shown, extends a cylindrical bolt 504 for mechanical<br><br>
sampling of a position on the auxiliary contact slide 502. In<br>
this case, after the disconnection of the switching device, a<br>
predetermined time is allowed to pass for the bolt 504 to be<br>
extended, with this time, for example, being in the range from<br>
200 ms to 500 ms.<br><br>
Figure 9 shows the fifth embodiment, as shown in Figure 8, with<br>
the delayed checking element 501 in an OFF position of the<br>
switching device. Figure 9 shows the auxiliary contact slide<br>
502 in the "lower" switch position, with a position 503 on the<br>
auxiliary contact slide 502 now being sampled. In the present<br>
case, the sampling is carried out by the operation of the bolt<br>
504 of the checking element 501 being blocked or restricted 504<br>
by a projection 503 on the auxiliary contact slide 502, which<br>
forms the position to be sampled, if the movement distance<br>
difference Δx traveled is not less than the predetermined<br>
value. In this case, the means 505-508 for breaking open the<br>
main contacts is not initiated.<br>
Figure 10 shows the fifth embodiment as shown in Figure 8 with<br>
the delayed checking element 501 in a "welded" position of the<br>
switching device. As Figure 10 shows, the bolt 503 of the<br>
checking element 501 is now no longer blocked while being<br>
extended, but moves without any impediment out of the housing<br>
of the checking element 501. When the auxiliary contact slide<br>
502 is in this position, the movement distance difference Δx is<br>
already less than the predetermined value, since the auxiliary<br>
contact slide 502, which is connected to the main contact slide<br>
that is not shown any further, has not traveled completely to<br>
the OFF position. As a result of the unimpeded extension of the<br>
actuator or of the bolt 504 of the solenoid 501, the force that<br>
is produced in this case is transmitted via a pivoting lever<br>
506, which is mounted in the housing of the solenoid 501 such<br>
that it can rotate, to a break-open slide 508, which can then<br>
break open the welded main contact. For illustrative purposes,<br>
arrows are shown relating to the movements of the bolt 503 of<br>
the actuator 501 and of the break-open slide 508.<br>
In Figures 8 to 10 of the present invention, the auxiliary<br>
contact slide 502 is moved at right angles to the movement<br>
direction of the actuator 501 and of the checking element.<br>
However, this need not necessarily be the case. It will be just<br><br>
as possible for the checking element to move in the same<br>
direction as the auxiliary contact slide 502. For example, the<br>
auxiliary contact slide 502 could thus move "downwards" when it<br>
is opening the main<br><br>
contacts, and the "delayed" checking and initiation element 501<br>
could move upwards during initiation. If the auxiliary contact<br>
slide 502 has then entirely reached its OFF position and its<br>
force is stronger than the checking and initiation element 501,<br>
then the checking and initiation element 501 is held by the<br>
auxiliary contact slide 502. In consequence, it can no longer<br>
be initiated.<br>
Alternatively, the switch position of the auxiliary contact<br>
slide 502 as shown in Figure 8 to Figure 10 can be checked by<br>
inductive, capacitive, optical or other known means for<br>
measurement. The components of the checking and initiation<br>
element and of the break-open means as described above can<br>
advantageously also be combined in a functional unit 501, 504-<br>
505, and can be integrated in a modular form in a switching<br>
device.<br><br>
