				<td>Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a novel polybenzimidazole-benzamide copolymer composed of the repeating units represented by the following formula 1, which is applied to the electrolyte membrane of a fuel cell, and a preparation method of the same. The present invention also relates to an electrolyte membrane produced by using the mentioned copolymer and a preparation method thereof. The present invention further relates to a membrane-electrode unit (MEA) for fuel cell containing the above electrolyte membrane and a fuel cell system including the same.(Figure Removed)<br><br><br>
Background Art<br>
A fuel cell has an electrolyte and a pair of electrodes separated by the electrolyte. In inside of a fuel cell, a fuel like hydrogen is supplied to one of the two electrodes and an oxidant like oxygen is supplied to the other electrode, suggesting that chemical energy including oxidation of a fuel is converted into electric energy. Hydrogen ion (that is, proton) can pass through the electrolyte but reactant gases (that is, hydrogen and oxygen) cannot. In general, laminated fuel cell contains numbers of fuel cells and each of the fuel cell has one electrolyte and a pair of electrodes separated by the electrolyte.<br>
Fuel cells are classified into solid oxide electrolyte fuel cell, molten<br>
carbonate fuel cell, phosphoric acid fuel cell and polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell, according to the electrolyte included in them. Polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cell contains polymer electrolyte membrane as its electrolyte, and thus, has high energy density and efficiency as well as other advantages such as fast starting and stop owing to its low operating temperature.<br>
In order to be used for a fuel cell, an electrolyte has to have high proton conductivity, low methanol permeability and stability on operating temperature. In the case of Nafion polymer electrolyte membrane, provided by Du Pont, USA, it cannot be commonly used because of high unit price and low thermal stability, although it has excellent mechanical and chemical stability and high proton conductivity. Thus, studies have been vigorously undertaking to overcome the above barriers to produce a polymer electrolyte membrane.<br>
As of today, the studies have been directed to develop a hydrocarbon polymer or a fluoride/hydrocarbon mixed polymer electrolyte membrane, rather than a fluoride polymer electrolyte membrane (Li, et al., Chemistry of materials, ACS, 2003, 15, 4896-4915).<br>
One of the most representative hydrocarbon polymer electrolyte membranes was produced by doping phosphoric acid (H3PO4) into an alkali polymer polybenzimidazole, which has very low fuel permeability, moderate electrolyte price, excellent mechanical properties, oxidation resistance and thermal stability (Wainwright, et al., Journal of the Electrochemical Society, ECS, 1995, 142, L121; Li, et al., Solid State Ionics, Elservier, 2004, 168, 177-185; sensio, et al., Journal of Polymer Science, 2002, 40, 3703-3710; Asensio, et al., Journal of the Electrochemical Society, ECS, 2004, 151, A304-A310; Kim, et al., Macromolecular Rapid Communications, Wiley, 2004, 25, 894-897).<br>
evertheless, the polybenzimidazole polymer electrolyte membrane prepared by doping phosphoric acid has inappropriate proton conductivity, not sufficient enough to replace Nafion.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In order to overcome the above mentioned problems, the present inventors have studied and completed this invention by confirming that a polymer electrolyte membrane produced by using a novel polybezimidazole-benzamide copolymer composed of the repeating units represented by formula 1 has similar to or higher proton conductivity than the conventional polybezimidazole polymer electrolyte membrane.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a polybenzimidazole-benzamide copolymer composed of the repeating units represented by formula 1 applicable to the electrolyte membrane of a fuel cell and a preparation method of the same.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a polymer electrolyte membrane characteristically prepared by using the polybenzimidazole-benzamide copolymer of the invention and a preparation method thereof.<br>
It is a further object of the present invention to provide a membrane-electrode unit for fuel cell containing the polymer electrolyte membrane of the invention and a fuel cell system including the same.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention is described in detail.<br>
The present invention relates to a polybenzimidazole-benzamide copolymer characteristically composed of the repeating units represented by formula 1 and a preparation method of the same.<br>
[Formula 1]<br><br><br><br>
Wherein, x is 0.1 -99.9. (Figure Removed)<br>
The polybenzimidazole-benzamide copolymer is composed of the repeating units represented by formula 1 containing benzimidazole by 0.1% ~ 99.9% and benzamide by 99.9% ~ 0.1%. The copolymer of the present invention can be used as a polymer electrolyte membrane for a fuel cell. The copolymer is prepared by that diaminobenzoic acid, purified at 200 ~ 250 in the presence of nitrogen, is dissolved in polyphosphoric acid and mixed with aminobenzoic acid, followed by stirring for more than 6 hours. At this time, the time point when aminobenzoic acid is added to the diaminobenzoic acid polymerization solution is regulated to guarantee mechanical properties of the copolymer.<br>
The present invention also relates to a polymer electrolyte membrane for fuel cell prepared by using the copolymer of the invention and a preparation method thereof.<br>
The polymer electrolyte membrane of the present invention is prepared by direct casting method that produces an electrolyte membrane directly from a polymerization solution. The method is elucidated hereinafter. Right after the polymerization of a copolymer composed of the repeating units represented by formula 1, the polymerization solution containing polyphosphoric acid is placed on a glass plate or a stainless plate, which stores in a 50 ~ 150 oven for 1 min<br>
~ 3 days to let the solution dispersed widely. Doctor blade is used to regulate the thickness of the membrane produced. The formed membrane is cooled down to room temperature or under, which is then soaked in water to wash out polyphosphoric acid. The membrane is dried in 0.1 mmHg vacuum condition, resulting in a polymer membrane. The polymer membrane is doped in 6 M of phosphoric acid solution, followed by drying at 0.1 mmHg for 24 ~ 60 hours to prepare a polymer electrolyte membrane doped with phosphoric acid. The direct casting method does not require the purifying process and produces an electrolyte membrane having a proper thickness fast and easily. A modified method is also included in the rage of the present invention, that is, a polymer electrolyte membrane of the present invention can be prepared by doping with sulfuric acid or polyphosphoric acid instead of phosphoric acid.<br>
The electrolyte membrane prepared by the above method has excellent mechanical properties and chemical and thermal stability, enabling the operating in wide temperature ranges from room temperature to 200 . In addition, the electrolyte membrane of the invention shows high proton conductivity, compared with a polybenzimidazole electrolyte membrane, resulted from the introduction of benzamide into the conventional polybenzimidazole polymer.<br>
The present invention further provides a membrane-electrode unit (MEA) for fuel cell prepared by using the polymer electrolyte membrane doped with acid and containing polybenzimidazole-benzamide copolymer of the invention and a fuel cell system including the unit.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Practical and presently preferred embodiments of the present invention are illustrative as shown in the following Examples.<br>
However, it will be appreciated that those skilled in the art, on consideration of this disclosure, may make modifications and improvements within the spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
Example 1. Synthesis of polybenzimidazole-benzamide [95-5 (unit: weight%)] copolymer<br>
In this example, aminobenzoic acid was copolymerized with diaminobenzoic acid having both amine group and carboxylic acid group together. At that time, diaminobenzoic acid and aminobenzoic acid were purified by recrystalization. 5 g of diaminobenzoic acid was dissolved in 100<br>
ml of distilled water by heating. Upon completion of dissolving, the solution was cooled down at room temperature slowly, resulting in brown needle-like crystals. Aminobenzoic acid was purified with the same manner. The purified monomers were dried for 24 hours in vacuum condition and ready to be used.<br>
95 g of polyphosphoric acid in a flask was heated at 220 , to which 5 g of 5 wt% diaminobenzoic acid was added, followed by stirring. 10 minutes later, 0.25 g of 5 wt% aminobenzoic acid was added. As polymerization progressed, the solution turned into dark red solution with high viscosity. Upon completion of the reaction, the hot polymerization solution was placed on a glass plate and leveled, which was then put in an oven. The solution was stored in the oven at 100 for 2 days. A membrane having a regular thickness was formed on the glass plate. At that time, doctor blade was used to regulate the thickness of the film. The glass plate whereon 100 urn thick film was formed was soaked in 2 L of distilled water to wash out polyphosphoric acid. 4 L of distilled water was additionally used to eliminate the remaining polyphosphoric acid in the film at room temperature. For the complete elimination of polyphosphoric acid in the film, the film was soaked in distilled water again and heated for 3 days.<br>
The prepared film was dried in vacuum condition at 1 mmHg for 48 hours. For doping of the dried film, the film was put in 6 M of phosphoric acid solution for 60 hours. The doped film was dried again at room temperature in vacuum condition at 1 mmHg.<br>
Example 2. Synthesis of polvbenzimidazole-benzamide [90-10 (unit:weight%)] copolymer<br>
Copolymerization was performed by the same manner as described in Example 1 except that 0.5 g of aminobenzoic acid was used.<br>
Example 3. Synthesis of polybenzimidazole-benzamide [77-23 (unit:weight%)1 copolymer<br>
Copolymerization was performed by the same manner as described in Example 1 except that 1.5 g of aminobenzoic acid was used.<br>
Experimental Example 1. Measurement of proton conductivity<br>
Proton conductivity of the electrolyte membrane of the present invention was measured using ZAHNER IM-6 impedance analyzer in the frequency range of 1 Hz - 1 MHz, at galvanostatic mode of 0.001 - 0.1 mA AC current amplitude, at the temperature range between room temperature to 180 and in the absence of humidity. In the case of Nafion 115, proton conductivity was measured twice, in the absence of humidity and in 100% humidity condition. The results are shown in Figure 1.<br>
Experimental Example 2. Measurement of viscosity<br>
The viscosity of the electrolyte membrane of the present invention was measured by using Ubbelohde viscometer. Precisely, 1 g of the electrolyte membrane was dissolved with 98% sulfuric acid in a 50 mL flask, making the volume as 0.2 g/dL. Then, the viscosity was measured in a 30 thermostat. The results are shown in Table 1.<br>
Experimental Example 3. Measurement of mechanical strength<br>
The mechanical strength of the electrolyte membrane of the present invention was measured with Lloyd LR-10K universal testing machine (UTM). Precisely, each electrolyte membrane was re-prepared as dog-bone film satisfying ASTM D638 type V at room temperature with 25% humidity. The mechanical strength was measured five times per each film. The mean values<br>
of tensile strength are shown in (Table Removed) <br><br>
Experimental Example 4. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA)<br>
The thermal stability of the electrolyte membrane synthesized in the present invention was measured with TA instruments thermogravimetirc analyzer 2050. Precisely, 50 mg of each electrolyte membrane was heated from 50 to 800 by 10 /min, during which the thermogravity was serially measured. And the results are shown in Figure 2.<br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
A polymer electrolyte membrane was prepared from polybenzimidazole-benzamide copolymer in the present invention. The polymer electrolyte membrane of the invention was proved to have as excellent mechanical properties as a polymer electrolyte membrane only composed of polybenzimidazole and at the same time shows high chemical and thermal stability (see Table 1 and Figure 2). In addition, as shown in Figure 1, the polymer electrolyte membrane of the invention has improved proton conductivity.<br>
