				<td>TWO-WHEEL SUPPORTING ROLLER ASSEMBLY FOR OPTICAL COMMUNICATION WIRE AND GROUND WIRE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a two-wheel supporting roller assembly used in installing or exchanging optical communication wires (e.g. OPGW; Optical fiber Grounding Wire) and ground wires (e.g. AWS) in a power-transmission tower, and more particularly to a two-wheel supporting roller assembly for optical communication and ground wires, which helps to install a guide rope easily and to easily and precisely fix a shutter on which optical communication ground wire inserted into the upper and lower rollers is mounted.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A supporting roller is generally used in installing or exchanging optical communication wires or ground wires between power-transmission towers.<br>
When installing or exchanging optical communication wires or ground wires, it is required to shut down the electricity from being inputted to the wires from a power cable located below for a precaution against accident.<br>
A two-wheel supporting roller assembly used in the installation of optical communication wires or ground wires includes an upper roller,<br><br>
in which the optical communication wire or ground wire connected between the power-transmission towers is positioned, a lower roller, in which a pulling rope is positioned, and a rope fixing unit, in which a guide rope is positioned.<br>
To insert the wire into the upper roller or lower roller of the two-wheel supporting roller, a shutter-fixing handle is to be rotated for unlocking the shutter and then the shutter is to be rotated so that one part of the upper roller or lower roller of the two-wheel supporting roller opens.<br>
After inserting the wire through the open space, the shutter is rotated so that a combining groove can be accurately engaged with a pin of the handle. Then the shutter is locked by rotating the handle.<br>
To prevent the wire from being separated from the two-wheel supporting roller, the combining groove of the shutter should be accurately engaged with the pin. If the combining groove is not accurately engaged with the pin due to the carelessness of a worker, the shutter is apt to be opened during operation. If the shutter is opened, the wire will be separated from the two-wheel supporting roller and a power failure will occur in the transmission towers.<br>
Additionally, it has been impossible to handle the shutter with one hand, so that it has been very inconvenient to install the wire.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention is designed to overcome the above problems of the prior art, and the object of the present invention is to provide a two-wheel supporting roller assembly, in which a shutter can be easily handled with only one hand, and accurately and securely maintain its locked state after the combining groove engaged with the pin of the handle.<br>
The two-wheel supporting roller assembly for installing or exchanging optical communication wires and ground wires according to the present invention includes an upper roller, a lower roller, a rope fixing unit for connecting an upper frame and a lower frame with a rope fixing connector and combining units mounted each roller, wherein combining units comprises pressing clutches installed to each of the upper and lower frames and having a flat portion and a groove on a wing at one side, engaging plates fixed to each frame with its end disc portion and having a protrusion combined into the groove, shutters combined to each of the pressing clutches at an end portion and having a combining groove at an opposite portion, and a compression spring installed between a shutter and a washer fixed with a countersunk bolt connected to the pressing clutches.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the rope fixing unit may includes the rope fixing connector having an inner circular space, which is opened to one side and a guide rope is inserted into, a rope fixture being in contact with the rope fixing connector and connected<br>
rotatably to a round-head bolt, and a hinge spring connected to the round-head bolt to return the rope fixture to an initial position.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, when pushing a rope into a rope fixing unit, the rope fixing connector is opened and then returns back to its initial state, thus a guide rope can be easily installed.<br>

BEST MODES FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Hereinafter, preferred embodiments of the present invention will be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
A two-wheel supporting roller assembly of the present invention includes an upper roller 1 and a lower roller 2, which are identically configured and connected with a rope fixing unit 3.<br>
The upper roller 1 has an upper frame 10 and at an upper portion of the upper frame, two bearings 16, a collar 17 and a travelling roller 14 are installed in the bolt shaft 15 fixed with a nut 18. At the wide lower space of the upper frame 10, a guide plate 11 made of synthetic resin or plastics is fixed to two portions of the upper frame 10 and one portion of the inside of a shutter 12 by screws 11'.<br>
The upper frame 10 has an open side so that an optical communication wire 5 can be inserted into or seperated from the upper frame 10. A fixing pin 13 is also installed at the lower end of the upper frame 10.<br>
The shutter 12 has a combining groove 12', in which the fixing pin 13 can be inserted, locked and unlocked by a combining unit 4.<br>
The lower roller 2 has a lower frame 20 and at an upper portion of<br>
the lower frame, two bearings 26, a collar 27 and a travelling roller 24 are installed in the bolt shaft 25 fixed with a nut 28. At the wide upper space of the lower frame 20, a guide plate 21 made of synthetic resin or plastics is fixed to two portions of the lower frame 20 and one portion of the inside of a shutter 22 by screws 21'.<br>
The lower frame 20 has an open side so that a pulling rope 7 can be inserted into or seperated from the lower frame 20. A fixing pin 23 is also mounted at the upper end of the lower frame 20.<br>
»<br>
The shutter 22 has a combining groove 22', in which the fixing pin 23 can be inserted, locked and unlocked by a combining unit 4.<br>
The combining units 4 installed at the upper and lower rollers 1, 2 have pressing clutches 40, into which the bolt shafts 15 and 25 are respectively inserted within the frames 10 and 20.<br>
For the frame 10 and 20, the pressing clutch 40 has flat portions 40' at both sides so as to be movable horizontally. At a wing 41 formed on the rear of the pressing clutch 40, there are grooves 41' formed at both sides.<br>
Outside of the pressing clutch 40, a engaging plate 42, which has protrusion 43 formed at both sides so as to be engaged with or released from groove 41', is installed. As shown in Fig. 3, the engaging plate 42 is fixed to the frame 10 with headless wrench bolts 47. So the pressing clutch 40 for the frame 20 has the same structure and function as that of the frame 10, of which the detailed description is omitted.<br>
The shutter 12 is installed to end disc portion 42' of the engaging plate 42 outside of the engaging plate 42. Outside the shutter 12, a compression spring 44 and a washer 45 are assembled in series. Outside the washer 45, a countersunk bolt 46 is combined at the center of the washer 45 to assemble the end disc portion 42' of the engaging plate 42, the shutter 12, the compressing spring 44 and the washer 45 to the pressing clutch 40.<br>
The rope fixing unit 3 is connected to the upper and lower frames 10 and 20. The rope fixing unit 3 includes a rope fixing connector 30 having a width at a center wider than its circular shape. The rope fixing unit 3 also has a rope fixture 31, which is in contact with the rope fixing connector 30 and connected rotatable to a round-head bolt 32 at an upper portion of the rope fixing unit 3. There is also provided a hinge spring 33 connected to the round-head bolt 32. The hinge spring 33 and the rope fixture 31 are installed to the fixing pin 13 so that the rope fixture 31 returns to its initial position after rotation.<br>
In the assembly of the two-wheel supporting roller in according to the invention, if a worker pushes the washer 45 of the combining unit 4 with their palm, the pressing clutch 40 connected with the countersunk bolt 46 is advanced straight forward, without being rotated due to the flat portions 40'.<br>
At this time, if pressing the washer 45 with the protrusion 43 of the engaging plate 42 being engaged with the groove 41' of the pressing<br>
clutch 40 as shown in Fig. 4, the pressing clutch 40 is moved inward to separate the groove 41' and the protrusion 43 as shown in Fig. 5.<br>
If the protrusion 43 is separated from the groove 41', the upper frame 10 can be opened by rotation of the shutter 12. Thus, the shutter 12 is rotated in an opposite direction to the combining groove 12'.<br>
If the shutter 12 is rotated, an optical communication wire 5 can be inserted into the upper frame 10. And then, when rotating the shutter 12 to its initial position, the washer 45 moves outward owing to the elasticity of the compression spring 44 as soon as the protrusion 43 mesh with the groove 41'. At this time, the pressing clutch 40 is also moved outward so that the protrusion 43 is engaged with the groove 41'.<br>
If the protrusion 43 of the engaging plate 42 is engaged with the groove 41' of the pressing clutch 40, the shutter 12 is securely locked since the flat portions 40' prevent rotation of the pressing clutch 40 and engaging plate 42. Thus, the optical communication wire 5 within the upper frame 10 cannot be separated from the upper frame 10 in any case.<br>
The lower roller 2 is worked as the upper roller 1, that is to say, if the shutter 22 is opened by pressing the washer 45, the pulling rope 7 can be inserted into the lower frame 20 through the open space. And then the pulling rope 7 can be securely installed by returning the<br>
shutter 22 to its initial position.<br>
A combining unit 4 installed to each of upper and lower rollers 1, 2 enables a worker to rotate the shutters 12, 22 with only one hand. In addition, the optical communication wire 5 or the pulling rope 7 can be easily inserted into or separated from the guide plates 11, 21. Moreover, while the shutters 12, 22 are rotated to combine the combining grooves 12', 22' with the fixed pins 13, 23, the combining unit 4 will be not unlocked owing to combination between the engaging plate 42 and the pressing clutch 40. In this state, the combining unit 4 is not opened if the washer 45 is not being pushed.<br>
Since the shutters 12, 22 are conveniently rotated with one hand and not opened in any case after combining as described above, the optical communication wire 5 or the ground wire is safely installed or exchanged.<br>
After installing the optical communication wire 5 to the upper roller 1 and the pulling rope 7 to the lower roller 2, a guide rope 6 is inserted into the center space of the rope fixing unit 3 from a side of the rope fixing connector 30.<br>
If the guide rope 6 is inserted into the rope fixing connector 30, the rope fixture 31 is pushed so that it is rotated on the axis of the round-head bolt 32. If the guide rope 6 passes through the rope fixture 31, the rope fixture 31 rotates to its initial position due to the elasticity of the hinge spring 33 thereby being contacted to the rope fixing<br>
connector 30.<br>
Then, the guide rope 6 is hooked up to the rope fixing connector 30 by the rope fixture 31.<br>
At this time, since the inner space of the rope fixing connector 30 is shaped to have wider sides than a circular hole, the guide rope 6 can be easily inserted into the space.<br>
By installing the optical communication wire 5, the guide rope 6 and the pulling rope 7, as shown in fig. 7, the two-wheel supporting roller assembly can be positioned at a constant distance according as the traction machine 8 moves.<br>
In case the traction machine 8 moves as required for installation, it is possible to exchange the old wire for the optical communication wire and the new ground wire by reversing the upper roller 1 and the lower roller 2 of the two-wheel supporting roller assembly. The old wire is then retrieved.<br>
At this time, the guide rope 6 plays the role of safety rope to prevent lengthening of the distance between the two-wheel supporting roller assemblies or other accidents.<br>
When installing or exchanging an optical communication wire or ground wire, the two-wheel supporting roller assembly of the present invention may prevent wire separation or other accidents because the shutter is easily rotated by separating the pressing clutch from the engaging plate with one hand and the shutter which is returned to its<br>
initial position is not opened by external force in any case.<br>
In addition, according to the present invention, the guide rope is easily connected to the rope fixing unit since the rope fixture returns to its initial position voluntarily after rotating and the rope fixing connector has a hole wider on both sides.<br>
The two-wheel supporting roller assembly according to the present invention has been described in detail. However, it should be understood that the detailed description and specific examples, while indicating preferred embodiments of the invention, are given by way of illustration only, since various changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.<br><br><br><br><br>
