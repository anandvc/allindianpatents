COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See Section 10 and Rule 13)<br>
CONDITIONING SHAMPOO COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under<br>
the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office<br>
at 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br>
 <br>
CONDITIONING SHAMPOO COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to a conditioning shampoo composition with improved stability.<br>
Compositions comprising gel networks are known in the art and include those structured oily phases which are structured by a crystalline material. Typically these gel networks are dispersed in an aqueous cleansing phase to provide a conditioning benefit in a cleansing composition, such as a shampoo. Typical of such a disclosure is WO 2007/040571 (P&amp;G) which describes shampoo compositions comprise (a) from about 5 % to about 50 % of one or more detersive surfactants, by weight of the shampoo composition; (b) a dispersed gel network phase comprising, by weight of the shampoo composition, (i) at least about 0.05 % of one or more fatty amphiphiles; (ii) at least about 0.01 % of one or more secondary surfactants; and (iii) Water; and (c) at least about 20 % of an aqueous carrier, by weight of the shampoo composition.<br>
Despite the prior art there remains a need for more stable conditioning shampoo compositions.<br>
Accordingly, and in a first aspect, the present invention provides an aqueous conditioning shampoo comprising cleansing surfactant and a conditioning gel network, the gel network comprising a particulate having a melting point above 70°C and glyceryl monostearate.<br>
 <br>
In a further aspect the present invention provides an aqueous conditioning shampoo comprising cleansing surfactant and a structured conditioning gel phase, the gel phase comprising a particulate having a melting point above  70°C and glyceryl monostearate,<br>
We have surprisingly found that conditioning gel phases or gel networks comprising a particulate are more stable in the presence of glyceryl monostearate.<br>
Preferred particulates include those with a melting point of above 75°C.<br>
Preferably, the particulate has a platelet morphology. Alternatively, the particulate is hydrophobic. Preferred particulates include hydrophobically modified clays. Alternatives include waxes.<br>
The total amount of glyceryl	monostearate is preferably from<br>
0.01 to 20%, more preferably	from 0.1 to 10%, and most<br>
preferably from 0.5 to 5% by	weight of the total<br>
composition.<br>
The gel network is formed by combining the components at a temperature above the melting point of glyceryl monostearate in the presence of water.  In a preferred method of manufacture, the glyceryl monostearate is melted in water and the particulate material is then added.  In a more preferred method of manufacture, a quaternary ammonium compound is also added, preferably after the particulate material.  A dispersion of liquid crystalline phase droplets<br>
 <br>
is typically produced.  It will be realised that, in effect, the gel network has another component: water.  In preferred embodiments, the gel network comprises an L, lamellar phase dispersion at 25°C.<br>
When the gel network also comprises a quaternary ammonium compound, the particles also have a melting point higher than this component.  Typically, the solid particles have an inorganic core, although they may be surface-modified with organic groups.<br>
Preferably, the particles have a platelet morphology or are hydrophobic.<br>
"Platelet morphology" should be understood to mean that the particles have a "plate-like" shape, i.e. their lengths in two orthogonal directions are considerably greater than their length in the third orthogonal direction.  Typically, the particles have length and breadth that are each independently at least 10 times greater their depth; where "length", "breadth", and "depth" are expressions for the three orthogonal directions.<br>
Suitable particles having platelet morphology are clays having a layered structure.  Such clays may be anionic or cationic, i.e., they may have a net charge on the surface of the clay that is negative or positive, respectively.<br>
Preferred particles having platelet morphology are anionic clays, such as smectite clays.<br>
 <br>
Typical smectite clays include the compounds having the general formula Al2 (Si205) 2 (OH) 2 .nH20 and the compounds having the general formula Mg3 (Si20s) 2 (OH) 2.nH20, and derivatives thereof, for example in which a proportion of the aluminium ions are replaced with magnesium ions or a proportion of the magnesium ions are replaced with lithium ions and/or some of the hydroxyl ions are replaced by fluoride ions; the derivatives may comprise a further metal ion to balance the overall charge.<br>
Specific examples of suitable smectite clays are montmorillonites, volchonskoites, nontronites, saponites, beidelites and sauconites, particularly those having an alkali or alkaline earth metal ion within the crystal lattice structure.  Preferred smectite clays are montmorillonites,. nontronites, saponites, beidelites, sauconites and mixtures thereof.  Particularly preferred are montmorillonites, e.g. bentonites and hectorites, with bentonites being especially preferred.<br>
Particularly preferred particles having platelet morphology are hydrophobically-modified anionic clays; especially, hydrophobically-modified bentonite clay.<br>
Hydrophobically-modified clays typically have organic cations replacing at least a proportion of the inorganic metal ions of the unmodified clay.  Preferred organic cations for this purpose comprising one or more C6-C30 alkyl groups.  The cationic group is preferably a quaternary ammonium group.  Particularly preferred organic cations have two C6-C30 alkyl groups, for example:<br>

Especially preferred particulate materials having platelet morphology are Quaternium-18 Bentonite, i.e. bentonite hydrophobically-modified by dimethyldi(hydrogenated tallow)ammonium cations) and Quaternium-90 Bentonite, an analogous material with two vegetable-derived fatty chains. Examples of such clays are Tixogel MP 100™ and Tixogel MP 100V™ from Sud Chemie.  Other similar materials include Quaternium benzalkonium bentonite, Quaternium-18 hectorite, stearalkonium bentonite, stearalkonium hectorite and dihydrogenated tallow benzylmonium hectorite.<br>

A quaternary ammonium compound having at least one carbon chain of length C12-C30 is a preferred component of the gel network.  In preferred embodiments, the quaternary ammonium compound has only one carbon chain of length C12-C30.

EXAMPLE 4<br>
Table 4 shows the transition temperatures of compositions according to table 1 with various different fatty materials i  The results show the transition temperature by DSC scanning and thus the stability of the compositions at elevated temperatures. The table shows that GMS provides a compositions with a higher temperature stability than fatty alcohol or fatty acid.<br>
<br>
	Table 4	<br>
Fatty compounds	Melting point	Transition temperature by DSC scanning<br>
Fatty alcohol		<br>
Cetyl alcohol (C16H340)	55-60°C	Form gel at 30-40°C<br>
Behenyl alcohol (C22H460)	65-73°C	Form gel at 44-55°C<br>
Fatty acid		<br>
Palmitic acid (C16H3202)	61-64°C	Form gel at 30-40°C<br>
Fatty ester		<br>
