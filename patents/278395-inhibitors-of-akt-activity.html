				<td>INHIBITORS OF Akt ACTIVITY<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention relates to novel heterocyclic carboxamide compounds, the use of such compounds as inhibitors of protein kinase B (hereinafter PKB/Akt, PKB or Akt) activity and in the treatment of cancer and arthritis<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to heterocyclic carboxamide containing compounds that are inhibitors of the activity of one or more of the isoforms of the serine/threonine kinase, Akt (also known as protein kinase B), suitably the compounds of the invention are inhibitors of the activity of all three isoforms of the serine/threonine kinase, Akt  The present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds and methods of using the instant compounds in the treatment of cancer and arthritis (Liu et al Current Opin Pharmacology 3 317-22 (2003))<br>
Apoptosis (programmed cell death) plays essential roles in embryonic development and pathogenesis of various diseases, such as degenerative neuronal diseases, cardiovascular diseases and cancer   Recent work has led to the identification of various pro- and anti-apoptotic gene products that are involved in the regulation or execution of programmed cell death   Expression of anti-apoptotic genes, such as Bcl2 or Bcl-xL, inhibits apoptotic cell death induced by vanous stimuli   On the other hand, expression of pro-apoptotic genes, such as Bax or Bad, leads to programmed cell death (Adams et al Science, 281 1322-1326 (1998)) The execution of programmed cell death is mediated by caspase -1 related proteinases, including caspase-3, caspase- 7, caspase-8 and caspase-9 etc (Thornberry et al Science, 281 1312-1316(1998))<br>
The phosphatidyhnositol 3'-OH kinase (PI3K)/Akt/PKB pathway appears important for regulating cell survival/cell death (Kulik et al Mol Cell Biol 17 1595-1606 (1997), Franke et al, Cell, 88 435-437 (1997), Kauffmann-Zeh et al Nature 385 544-548 (1997) Hemmings Science, 275 628-630 (1997), Dudek et al, Science, 275 661-665 (1997))   Survival factors, such as platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), nerve growth factor (NGF) and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-I), promote cell survival under various conditions by inducing the activity of PI3K (Kulik et al 1997, Hemmings 1997)   Activated PI3K leads to the production of phosphatidylinositol (3,4,5)-trtiphosphate (Ptdlns (3,4,5)-P3), which in turn binds to, and promotes the activation of, the serine/ threonine kinase Akt, which contains a<br>
pleckstrin homology (PH)-domain (Franke et al Cell, 81 727-736 (1995), Hemmings Science, 277 534 (1997), Downward, Curr Opm Cell Biol 10 262-267 (1998), Alessi et al, EMBO J 15 6541-6551 (1996))   Specific inhibitors of PI3K or dominant negative Akt/PKB mutants abolish survival-promoting activities of these growth factors or cytokines   It has been previously disclosed that inhibitors of PI3K (LY294002 or wortmannin) blocked the activation of Akt/PKB by upstream kinases In addition, introduction of constitutively active PI3K or Akt/PKB mutants promotes cell survival under conditions in which cells normally undergo apoptotic cell death (Kulik et al 1997, Dudeketal 1997)<br>
Analysis of Akt levels in human tumors showed that Akt2 is overexpressed in a significant number of ovanan (J Q Cheung et al Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 89 9267-9271(1992)) and pancreatic cancers (J Q Cheung et al Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 93 3636-3641(1996))   Similarly, Akt3 was found to be overexpressed in breast and prostate cancer cell lines (Nakatani et al J Biol Chem 274 21528-21532 (1999)   It was demonstrated that Akt-2 was over-expressed in 12% of ovarian carcinomas and that amplification of Akt was especially frequent in 50% of undifferentiated tumors, suggestion that Akt may also be associated with tumor aggressiveness (Bellacosa, et al, Int J Cancer, 64, pp 280-285, 1995)   Increased Akt1 kinase activity has been reported in breast, ovarian and prostate cancers (Sun et al Am J Pathol 159 431-7(2001))<br>
The tumor suppressor PTEN, a protein and lipid phosphatase that specifically removes the 3' phosphate of Ptdlns(3,4,5)-P3, is a negative regulator of the PI3K/Akt pathway (Li et al Science 275 1943-1947 (1997), Stambolic et al Cell 95 29-39(1998), Sun et al Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 96 6199-6204(1999)) Germhne mutations of PTEN are responsible for human cancer syndromes such as Cowden disease (Liaw et al Nature Genetics 16 64-67 (1997))   PTEN is deleted in a large percentage of human tumors and tumor cell lines without functional PTEN show elevated levels of activated Akt (Li et al supra, Guldberg et al Cancer Research 57 3660-3663 (1997), Risinger et al Cancer Research 57 4736-4738 (1997))<br>
These observations demonstrate that the PI3K/Akt pathway plays important roles for regulating cell survival or apoptosis in tumongenesis<br>
Three members of the Akt/PKB subfamily of second-messenger regulated serine/threonine protein kinases have been identified and termed Akt1/ PKBa, Akt2/PKBp, and Akt3/PKBy respectively   The isoforms are homologous, particularly in regions encoding the catalytic domains   Akt/PKBs are activated by phosphorylation events occurring in response to PI3K signaling   PI3K<br>
phosphorylates membrane inositol phospholipids, generating the second messengers phosphatidyl- inositol 3,4,5-tnsphosphate and phosphatidylinositol 3,4-bisphosphate, which have been shown to bind to the PH domain of Akt/PKB   The current model of Akt/PKB activation proposes recruitment of the enzyme to the membrane by 3'-phosphorylated phosphoinositides, where phosphorylation of the regulatory sites of Akt/PKB by the upstream kinases occurs (B A Hemmings, Science 275 628-630 (1997), B A Hemmings, Science 276 534 (1997), J Downward, Science 279 673-674 (1998))<br>
Phosphorylation of Akt1/PKBa occurs on two regulatory sites, Thr308 in the catalytic domain activation loop and on Ser473 near the carboxy terminus (D R Alessiefa/ EMBO J 15 6541-6551 (1996) and R Meier et al J Biol Chem 272 30491-30497 (1997))   Equivalent regulatory phosphorylation sites occur in Akt2/PKBB and Akt3/PKBy   The upstream kinase, which phosphorylates Akt/PKB at the activation loop site has been cloned and termed 3 '-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase 1 (PDK1)   PDK1 phosphorylates not only Akt/PKB, but also p70 nbosomal S6 kinase, p90RSK, serum and glucocorticoid-regulated kinase (SGK), and protein kinase C   The upstream kinase phosphorylating the regulatory site of Akt/PKB near the carboxy terminus has not been identified yet, but recent reports imply a role for the mtegnn-hnked kinase (ILK-1), a serine/threonine protein kinase, or autophosphorylation<br>
Inhibition of Akt activation and activity can be achieved by inhibiting PI3K with inhibitors such as LY294002 and wortmannin   However, PI3K inhibition has the potential to mdiscnminately affect not just all three Akt isozymes but also other PH domain-containing signaling molecules that are dependent on Pdtlns(3,4,5)- P3, such as the Tec family of tyrosine kinases   Furthermore, it has been disclosed that Akt can be activated by growth signals that are independent of PI3K<br>
Alternatively, Akt activity can be inhibited by blocking the activity of the upstream kinase PDK1   The compound UCN-01 is a reported inhibitor of PDK1 Biochem J 375(2) 255 (2003)  Again, inhibition of PDK1 would result in inhibition of multiple protein kinases whose activities depend on PDK1, such as atypical PKC isoforms, SGK, and S6 kinases (Williams et al Curr Biol 10 439-448 (2000)<br>
Small molecule inhibitors of Akt are useful in the treatment of tumors, especially those with activated Akt (e g PTEN null tumors and tumors with ras mutations)   PTEN is a critical negative regulator of Akt and its function is lost in many cancers, including breast and prostate carcinomas, glioblastomas, and several cancer syndromes including Bannayan-Zonana syndrome (Maehama, T et al Annual Review of Biochemistry, 70 247 (2001)), Cowden disease (Parsons, R ,<br>
Simpson, L Methods in Molecular Biology (Totowa, NJ, United States), 222 (Tumor Suppressor Genes, Volume 1) 147 (2003)), and Lhermitte-Duclos disease (Backman, S et al Current Opinion in Neurobiology, 12(5) 516 (2002))  Akt3 is up-regulated in estrogen receptor-deficient breast cancers and androgen-independent prostate cancer cell lines and Akt2 is over-expressed in pancreatic and ovanan carcinomas   Akt1 is amplified in gastnc cancers (Staal, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 84 5034-7 (1987) and upregulated in breast cancers (Stal et al Breast Cancer Res 5 R37-R44 (2003))   Therefore a small molecule Akt inhibitor is expected to be useful for the treatment of these types of cancer as well as other types of cancer  Akt inhibitors are also useful in combination with further chemotherapeutic and anticancer agents<br>
It is an object of the instant invention to provide novel compounds that are inhibitors of Akt/PKB<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide pharmaceutical compositions that comprise a pharmaceutical carner and compounds useful in the methods of the invention<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a method for treating cancer that comprises administering such inhibitors of Akt/PKB activity<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a method for treating arthritis that comprises admmistenng such inhibitors of Akt/PKB activity<br>

Agents used in proapoptotic regimens (e g , bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotides) may also be used in the combination of the present invention Members of the Bcl-2 family of proteins block apoptosis Upregulation of bcl-2 has therefore been linked to chemoresistance Studies have shown that the epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulates anti-apoptotic members of the bcl-2 family (i e , mcl-1) Therefore, strategies designed to downregulate the expression of bcl-2 in tumors have demonstrated clinical benefit and are now in Phase ll/lll trials, namely Genta's G3139 bcl-2 antisense oligonucleotide   Such proapoptotic strategies using the antisense oligonucleotide strategy for bcl-2 are discussed in Water JS et al (2000), J Clin Oncol 18 1812-1823, and Kitada S etal (1994), Antisense Res Dev 4   71-79<br>
Cell cycle signalling inhibitors inhibit molecules involved in the control of the cell cycle   A family of protein kinases called cyclin dependent kinases (CDKs) and their interaction with a family of proteins termed cyclins controls progression through the eukaryotic cell cycle   The coordinate activation and inactivation of different cyclm/CDK complexes is necessary for normal progression through the cell cycle   Several inhibitors of cell cycle signalling are under development   For instance, examples of cyclin dependent kinases, including CDK2, CDK4, and CDK6 and inhibitors for the same are described in, for instance, Rosania et al, Exp Opin Ther Patents (2000) 10(2) 215-230<br>
