2.	Applicant(s)<br><br>
(a)	NAME : HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED<br>
(b)	NATIONALITY : A company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913<br>
and having its registered office at<br>
(c)	ADDRESS : Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation,<br>

3.	PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION	<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br>
GRANTED<br>
2 8 DEC 2005      20-11-2006<br><br>
WO 2004/022025	PCT/EP2003/009382<br>
PERSONAL  CARE  TOWELETTE  TABLET<br>
The invention relates to a towelette or mask compressed into a tablet which reconstitutes into its original expanded form when placed into an aqueous media.<br>
Unit dose personal care products have become quite popular. Among the reasons for such popularity is easy transport rendering their use available outside the home.  Unit dose formats are also exciting in their novel appearance. Sometimes the unit dose delivers a personal care composition impregnated on a cloth which cooperates with the composition in delivering a skin or hair benefit.  Wipe articles utilizing impregnated cloths have proven quite popular. Another type of unit dose product is being sold by Awake International, Inc. in the form of a compressed tablet.  The company recommends that the tablet be placed into a lotion filled cap of a lotion bottle.  The tablet expands and absorbs liquid from the lotion.  A towelette is thereby liberated from the tablet.<br><br>
A problem with the Awake International, Inc. technology is necessity for access to a lotion bottle or similar bulk liquid cosmetic.  There is a need to improve this unit dose delivery concept.<br>
In a first aspect, the invention provides atowelette product which includes:<br>
(i)  a water-insoluble web compressed into a tablet form, the web fully extended having a major surface area<br><br>
WO 2004/022025	PCT/EP2003/009382<br><br>
greater than 10 times a total surface area of the tablet; and (ii) a personal care composition formulated into the tablet.<br>
Now it has been found that formulating a personal care composition into or onto a water-insoluble web of a towelette compressed into tablet form achieves a unit dose more efficient than the nearest technology.  A source of water is the only extrinsic element necessary to re-activate the system.  Besides the ready-to-use aspect, formulated towelette tablets allow for uniform distribution of personal care composition ingredients throughout the towelette.<br>
Another particularly beneficial feature of this invention is that the personal care composition serves as a binder to better achieve tablet integrity.  Moreover, use of the personal care composition assists in the manufacturing process.  Lower temperatures and pressures can be utilized to form the tablet than in situations where there is no personal care composition present.<br>
A first necessary aspect of the present invention is that of a towelette web known hereinafter also as a substrate.  A wide variety of materials can be used as a substrate.  Among the desirable characteristics are that of sufficient wet strength for use, appropriate size, and non-reactivity with components of any impregnated personal care composition.<br><br>
WO 2004/022025	PCT7EP2003/009382<br><br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable substrates which meet the above criteria include non-woven substrates, woven substrates, hydro-entangled substrates, air entangled substrates and the like.  Preferred embodiments employ non-woven substrates since they are economical and readily available in a variety of materials.  By non-woven is meant that the layer is comprised of fibers which are not woven into a fabric but rather are formed into a sheet, particularly a tissue.  The fibers can either be random (i.e., randomly aligned) or they can be carded (i.e. combed to be oriented in primarily one direction) .  Furthermore, the non-woven substrate can be composed of a combination of layers of random and carded fibers.<br>
Non-woven substrates may be comprised of a variety of materials both natural and synthetic.  By natural is meant that the materials are derived from plants, animals, insects or by-products.  By synthetic is meant that the materials are obtained primarily from various man-made materials or from material that is usually a fibrous web comprising any of the common synthetic or natural textile-length fibers, or mixtures thereof.<br>
Non-limiting examples of natural materials useful in the present invention are silk fibers, keratin fibers and cellulosic fibers.  Non-limiting examples of keratin fibers include those selected from the group consisting of wool fibers, camel hair fibers, and the like.  Non-limiting examples of cellulosic fibers include those selected from the group consisting of wood pulp fibers, cotton fibers,<br><br>
WO 2004/022025	PCT/EP2003/009382<br>
hemp fibers, jute fibers, flax fibers, and mixtures thereof. Wood pulp fibers are preferred.<br>
Non-limiting examples of synthetic materials useful in the present invention include those selected from the group consisting of acetate fibers, acrylic fibers, cellulose ester fibers, modacrylic fibers, polyamide fibers, polyester fibers, polyolefin fibers, polyvinyl alcohol fibers, rayon fibers and mixtures thereof.  Examples of some of these<br>
synthetic materials include acrylics such as Acrilan ,<br><br>
Creslan®, and the acrylonitrile-based fiber, Orion® ;<br>
cellulose ester fibers such as cellulose acetate, Arnel ,<br>
and Acele ; polyamides such as Nylons (e.g., Nylon 6, Nylon<br>
®      ® 66  and Nylon 610) / polyesters such as Fortrel , Kodel , and<br>
® the polyethylene terephthalate fibers, Dacron ; polyolefins<br>
such as polypropylene, polyethylene; polyvinyl acetate fibers and mixtures thereof.<br>
Non-woven substrates made from natural materials consist of webs most commonly formed on a fine wire screen from a liquid suspension of the fibers.<br>
Substrates made from natural materials useful in the present invention can be obtained from a wide variety of commercial<br>
sources.  Non-limiting examples of suitable commercially<br>
® available paper useful herein include Airtex , an embossed<br>

The substrates of the present invention can comprise two or more layers, each having a different texture and abrasiveness.  The differing textures can result from the use of different combinations of materials or from the use of a substrate having a more abrasive side for exfoliation and a softer, absorbent side for gentle cleansing.  In addition, separate layers of the substrate can be manufactured to have different colors, thereby helping the user to further distinguish the surfaces.<br>
Personal care compositions of the present invention will be deposited onto or impregnated into the towelettes of the present invention.  Deposition or impregnation may be achieved either through wet or dry processing.  When wet processed, the personal care compositions can be suspended in an aqueous vehicle with the substrate web being immersed therein.  Downstream from the immersion, the web can be dried via an oven to remove at least some water, prior to compaction.<br>
Alternatively, the web can receive the personal care composition as a semi-solid or waxy coating which requires no elimination of water or other solvent vehicle.  The semi¬solid or waxy composition can be applied by pressure roller or print technique (e.g. gravure, thermal printing, screen process) onto the substrate web.  In a still further process variant, the composition can be dosed directly into a pressurized press during compaction of a substrate web.<br><br>

Water may be present as a carrier.  However, in most instances compression requires that water and other highly volatile fluids be driven off.  Thus, the compressed tablets of this invention ordinarily will contain from 0 to about 10 %, preferably no higher than 5 %, optimally no higher than 1 % water.<br>
Effervescent chemicals may also be incorporated into the composition and tablet.  Sodium and potassium bicarbonate are particularly suitable.  Amounts may range from about 1 % to about 50 % by weight of the tablet product.  Completed tablets upon being dropped into water will thereby be able to add a fizz phenomena.<br>
Tablets according to the present invention are formed in a conventional manner.  The processes employed can be similar to those used in tabletting laundry detergents, denture<br><br>
WO 2004/022025	PCT/EP2003/009382<br>
cleansers and antacids.  For instance, the process can be conducted at temperatures ranging from about minus 20°C to about 200°C, preferably from about 0°C to about 40°C.  Test quantities can be produced using an Instron Universal Machine which drives a cylindrical steel punch into a cylindrical die.  Pressures from about 2 to about 100 psi, most preferably between about 2 and about 10 psi and even higher amounts may be employed dependent upon the particular equipment utilized.  For production scale machinery it may¬be desirable to construct a mold in which tabletting occurs so that it incorporates channels for the circulation of liquid at the desired temperature.  Alternatively the mold could be surrounded by an electric heating coil, controlled by a temperature sensor in contact with the mold.<br>
The term "comprising" is meant not to be limiting to any subsequently stated elements but rather to encompass non-specified elements of major or minor functional importance. In other words the listed steps, elements or options need not be exhaustive.  Whenever the words "including" or "having" are used, these terms are meant to be equivalent to "comprising" as defined above.<br>
Except in the operating and comparative examples, or where otherwise explicitly indicated, all numbers in this description indicating amounts of material ought to be understood as modified by the word "about".<br>
Examples<br><br>
WO 2004/022025	PCT/EP2003/009382<br>
The following examples will more fully illustrate the embodiments of this invention.  All parts, percentages and proportions referred to herein and in the appended claims are by weight unless otherwise illustrated.<br>
Example 1<br>
A skin care lotion in powdered form is prepared with components listed in Table I below.<br>
TABLE I<br>
Powdered Skin Care Lotion<br>
	Component	Relative Weight (parts)<br>
Stearic Acid	2 .5	<br>
PEG-6000	      1.5	<br>
Sunflower Seed Oil	0.7	<br>
Glycerin	0.4	<br>
Sodium Stearoyl Lactylate	0.8	<br>
The powder is formed by placing all components into a beaker and heating to 80°C forming a liquid.  A magnetic stirrer is used for mixing the combination.  The liquid is then cooled to room temperature.  Solidified material is removed from the beaker and cut into small flakes.  These flakes are then ground into a powder.<br>
Powder is transferred to a hopper oriented above a moving web of damp cellulosic pulp towelette substrate.  A film of powder is uniformly distributed onto the damped substrate as the latter traverses beneath the hopper.  Powder clings to<br><br>
1	1<br>
WO 2004/022025	PCT/EP2003/009382<br>
the wetted substrate.  Further downstream, the substrate is cut into a 20 cm diameter circle.  A mask towelette is achieved by cutting out two eye areas and a mouth area.  In other embodiments wherein the towelette is not utilized as a facial mask, it can be rectangular with dimensions such as 20 cm (length) by 15 cm (width) .  The towelette substrate is a single layer cellulosic wood pulp construction.  Once the towelette or mask is formed, the personal care impregnated substrate is compressed within a Carver press at about 20 psi forming a round tablet 2 cm in diameter and 0.8 cm in width.<br>
Release of the mask from the tablet is accomplished by placing the tablet in a cup with 50 ml water.  When in mask form,   the water expanded mask can be placed over a  user's face and allowed to dry.  The personal care composition<br>
impregnated onto the mask will then transfer to the user's face.<br>
Example 2<br>
Another towelette tablet is manufactured similar to the process described in Example 1.  The personal care composition is however altered to the components listed in Table II.<br><br>
1	t<br>

Example 3<br>
Still another skin cream composition is impregnated into a towelette according to the present invention.  In this Example, the impregnating formulation is a wet one which is evenly distributed over the surface of a cellulosic pulp towelette substrate.  Subsequent to being impregnated with the skin cream liquid, the towelette is dried in an oven to remove almost all the water leaving behind a uniform distribution of skin benefit agents and non-volatile carriers.  Thereafter, the dried towelette is compressed into a tablet.  The impregnated formulation (absent the water carrier) is listed in Table III.<br><br>
