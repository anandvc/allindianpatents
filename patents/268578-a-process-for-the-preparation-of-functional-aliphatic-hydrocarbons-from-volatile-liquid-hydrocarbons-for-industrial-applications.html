				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of functional aliphatic hydrocarbons from volatile liquid hydrocarbons. More particularly, the invention provides a process to convert volatile liquid hydrocarbons into functional aliphatic hydrocarbons using thermal resistant mesoporous activated carbon and metal impregnated activated carbon under oxic environment. The most important application of the process of the present invention is envisaged to be in processing industries for the purpose of minimizing the pollution load by converting toxic aromatic hydrocarbons into simpler aliphatic hydrocarbons. For example, leather processing industry, which is associated with environmental pollution due to the emission of volatile hydrocarbons, is envisaged to be a potential user of the process. Besides, the process finds several other industrial applications. It has enormous potential applications as catalytic converters in automobile industry to minimize exhaust emissions. It may also find application in the energy sectors as an important sustainable source of hydrogen, required for fuel cells in mobile and stationery applications. Moreover, the process is envisaged to have application in petroleum industries for the purpose of oxidation of liquid hydrocarbons in refinery streams. Further, the process may find application in chemical industries for the synthesis of fine chemicals from bulky organic substances.<br>
Background of the Invention &amp; Description of Prior Art<br>
In   recent  years,   emissions   of volatile   liquid   hydrocarbons   (VOCs)   into  the atmosphere have   contributed significantly to air pollution. Emissions of VOC into<br><br>
the atmosphere seriously contribute to the global pollution of the environment. Diseases such as bronchitis, pneumonia, as well as other alterations of the immunologic system, are related to the atmospheric pollution. The control of their emissions has therefore become imperative . It leads to a need to develop efficient technologies for the removal of VOCs. There are many different methods for the removal of VOCs, such as adsorption, absorption, biofiltration, thermal incineration (combustion), and catalyst incineration. Although thermal incineration is widely practiced, the catalytic incineration is also preferred as it can lower the combustion temperature remarkably.<br>
The catalysts mainly used in the catalytic incinerators for the oxidation of VOCs are either supported by noble metals (Pt, Pd, Rh, Au) or transition-metals (Mn, Co, Cu, Fe, Ni). In general, noble metal catalysts have higher activities than other metal catalysts. However, their manufacturing costs are high. The major limitation associated with the thermal incineration and catalytic incineration of VOCs is release of CO2 into the atmosphere as a result of complete combustion process. This emission of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere creates a global warming problem and becomes a matter of serious public concern. It has been recognized that the increase in global temperatures causes rise in sea level, increase in intensity of weather events, changes in agricultural yields, glacier retreat, species extinctions, and increase in ranges of disease vectors . Therefore complete conversion of VOC into CO2 is not advisable and appropriate in the present scenario and its control has been recognized to be necessary to remedy the global<br><br>
warming problem. This prompts the necessity to provide a process for conversion of VOCs into intermediate or value added products rather than going for the complete conversion of VOCs into CO2.<br>
Parvulescu et al (Catalysis Today 78, 477-485, 2003) oxidized hydrocarbons such as benzene and toluene into benzaldehyde using mono (V, Nb) or bimetallic (V-Ti, Nb-Ti) ions modified MCM-41 (Mobile Crystalline Material of silicate) in the presence of hydrogen peroxide at 616°C. Reference can be made to Hsiao-Chang et al (Applied Catalysis A: General 211, 159-165, 2001) who adopted the oxidation of propene and propane into water and carbon dioxide in the presence of CO at 300°C using noble rnetals such as palladium and platinum supported on alumina and zirconia. This method suffers for its restricted commercial application due to high cost in developing the catalyst and where no value added products were produced. This high cost would severely affect the economy of the process when commercially upscaled. In the above mentioned literatures, it can be found that one of the most interesting metals seems to be platinum, and a wide range of materials, including zeolites, AI203, SiO2, TiO2 , have been used as catalyst supports. This has prompted researchers to explore possibilities to economise the process by using low cost catalytic sources.<br>
Our co-pending Indian patent application (320 DEL 2004) provides a process for the synthesis of transition metal complexes impregnated activated carbon. The preparation of materials involves the use of metal complexes in the form of<br><br>
acetylacetonates, pyridine, picoline, hexafluoroacetylacetone, oxime of Cu, Co, Ni, and insitu impregnation of the same on activated carbon having Surface area : 392 - 430 m2/g, Carbon : 37.96 - 39.36 %, Hydrogen : 2.46 - 3.41 %, Nitrogen : 0.50 -0.71 %, Moisture :8 - 15%, Ash : 40 - 50% followed by curing at optimized temperatures.<br>
Drago et. al (Applied! Catalysis B. environmental 6, 155-168,1995) reported the complete oxidation of hydrocarbons at around 250°C using metal oxides supported on carbonaceous materials. The metal oxides used were manganese and cobalt. Vivekanand et al, (Carbon 43, 3041-3053, 2005) reported the catalytic oxidation of toluene and m-xylene using a phenolic resin based activated carbon fiber (ACF) impregnated with nitrates of Co, Cr, Ni, and Cu at the reaction temperatures at around 300° C. These methods has a major limitation that the hydrocarbons used such as hexane, butane and toluene were oxidized completely into Carbon dioxide and water and does not provide any value added products of industrial use. The combination of carbon adsorption with catalytic complete oxidation of n-hexane, 2,3-dimethylbutane, cyclohexane and benzene at 300 °C using activated carbons prepared with almond shells and impregnated with CoO, Co3O4 and CrOs were also reported by Alvim Ferraz et al. (Fuel 78 1567-1573, 1999). Chi-Yuan Lu et al., (Applied Catalysis A: General 325 163-174, 2007) prepared a transition-metal catalyst by the polyol method, and subsequently to evaluate the feasibility of the catalytic incineration of volatile liquid hydrocarbons (styrene, toluene and benzene). Activated carbon was selected as the support material, and copper, cobalt, iron,<br><br>
and nickel were used as the catalytic active phases. The major limitation associated with these processes is that they involve only a partial or complete oxidation of VOCs without yielding any kind of intermediate or functional aliphatic compounds, useful for industrial application.<br>
