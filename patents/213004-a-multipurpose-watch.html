Referring to fig.l, the watch of the present invention comprises a housing (1) of a transparent plastic material, which houses various gear assemblies as described in the ensuing description. On the top surface of the said housing, there is provided a dial plate (2) having various markings described herein. Over the said dial plate (2), there are four hands (5,6,7,8) which are adapted to be separated from each other and mounted on the central pivot (33) and are rotated by the respective gear assemblies provided inside the said housing (1). A wrist watch (3) with minute and second hand, a week days dial (4) with a day indicating needle (9) and minute watch (11) with minutes hand (lla) wherein minutes watch shows minutes in decimal system (14.40 minute of solar time =100 min of decimal system) are also provided on the tip surface of the said housing. The said dial plate etc. is housed inside a protective covering of transparent material, the said covering being openable by unscrewing the screws (12la). A motor, screwed on two supports, rotates the axle (15).<br>
Referring to the fig. 2 and fig.2(a) which shows section A'A', a motor fixed gear (16) having 14 teeth is provided at the other end of the said<br>
axle (15) inside the said housing (1). When the said motor (13) starts, said motor fixed gear (16) starts rotating in anti-clockwise direction.<br>
The said motor fixed gear (16) is adapted to rotate the adjusting knob (17) in clockwise direction which in turn rotates idler (18) in anti-clock wise direction. The idler (18) is adapted to rotate the motor revolution increasing gear (19) having 10 teeth in clockwise direction and consequently the worm gear (19a) which is just an extension of said motor revolution increasing gear (19) will also start rotating in clockwise direction. The said worm gear (19a) will in turn rotate gear (20) in anti-clock wise direction. The said gear (20) has 100 teeth and one tooth of this gear rotates when worm gear (19a) completes one rotation (100 decimal seconds =8.64 solar seconds). The hand (lla) is attached to the gear (20) and shows minutes in decimal system on the said decimal system minute watch (11) in anti-clock wise direction wherein 14.40 minute of solar system 100 minutes of decimal system.<br>
The said gear (20) in turn rotates (21) in clock wise direction. The worm gear (22) attached to said gear (21) also rotates in clock wise direction and completes one rotation in one hour of decimal system (1 day =24 hours =100 hour of decimal system). The said worm gear (22) is adapted to rotate hour gear (23) in anti-clockwise direction.<br>
When worn gear (22) rotates by one rotation, one tooth of said hour gear (23) gets rotated. Thus after 100 rotations of worm gear (22), the hour gear (23) under goes one complete rotation i.e. hour gear completes on rotation in 100 hours on decimal system or 24 hours. The said hour gear (23) is connected to level gear (24) which is<br>
adapted such that it rotates level gear (25) which in turn is attached to pivot gear (26). The pivot gear (26) is adapted to rotate gear (27) which in turn is attached to pivot gear (26). The pivot gear (26) is adapted to rotate gear (27) which in turn rotates gear (28). The gear (28) rotates gear (29), the gear (29) rotates gear (30) and gear (30) rotates gear (31) which in turn rotates gear (32). The pivot grass (26) to 32 are provided on hubs (50 to 56 respectively).<br>
The gear (32) is integrally attached around the central pivot (33) of the watch. In this way pivot of the watch completes one rotation in 100 used hours or 24 hours. The gears (26) to (32) are referred as pivot gears as they help to rotate central pivot (33) of the watch. The hour hand (6), which is attached to the central pivot (33) of the watch, which rotates in clock wise direction and completes one rotation in 100 used hours or 24 hours solar hours.<br>
The said pivot gear (27) is integral connected connecting rod (34) at one end and is integrally corrected to gear (35) at other end so that when pivot gear (27) rotates in anti-clock wise direction, the gear (35) also rotates in anti-clockwise direction. The gear (35) rotates gear (36) which is turn rotates the gear (37) and gear (37) rotates idler (38) in clock-wise direction which in turn rotates gear (39) in anti-clockwise direction. The gear (39) rotates idler (40) in clock wise direction which in turn rotates the gear (41) on anti-clockwise direction. The gears (36,37,39) and Idlers (38,40) are provided on hubs (60,61,63) and (62,64) respectively. A circular disc (42) attached with gear (41). This disc (42) indicates the rotation of earth and different countries and cities are marked on the dial of this disc at their respective meridians.<br>
The disc (42) with the help of time zone ring (71) (fig.l) shows the time at different meridians.<br>
Gear (35) is integrally connected to connecting rod (34). So with pivot gear (27), gear (35) also rotates in anti-clockwise direction. Gear (35) rotate idler (111) which in turn rotates gear (112) in anti-clockwise direction. The gear (112) is fixed with change gear (113) which has 8 teeth. With gear (112) change gear (113) also rotates which in turn rotate gear (114) in clockwise direction. Gear (114) is integrally connected to week days disc (4). So with gear (114) week days disc also rotate in clockwise direction once in one week duration. Week days indicating needle (9) denotes the day on dial e.g. Sunday, Monday etc. Idler (111), gear (112), gear (114) are mounted on hubs 115, 116 and 117 respectively.<br>
Gear (43) is fixed with the central pivot (33) and hence rotates once in 24 hours. The Gear (43) rotates the gear (44) in anti-clock wise direction which in turn rotates the gear (45) in clock-wire direction. The gear (45) rotates gear (46) which in turn rotates the gear (47) in clock-wise-direction. The gear (47) is provided on change gear (48), which has 12 teeth.<br>
When change gear (48) rotates, it rotates idler (49) in anti-clockwise direction which in turn rotates the change gear (90) in clock wise direction. This change gear (90) is adapted to rotate the gear (91) having 328 teeth. The complete rotation of gear (91) corresponds to 27 days and 8 hours which is the revolution time of moon around the earth. The gear (91) is attached to the needle (8). The upper surface ofthe said gear (91) is divided in 30 equal parts which are marked as 1 to 15, 1 to 14 and 30. The marking on gear (91) which is in alignment with needle (5), indicates the different phases of moon. The marking 15 on gear (91) in alignment with needle (5) indicates full moon, marking (30) in alignment with needle (5) indicates new moon.<br>
Referring to fig.3, which shows the section at B'B', the gear (92) is adapted to rotate when central pivot (33) rotates. The gear (92) in turn rotates idler (93) in anti-clockwise direction which in turn rotates gear (94) in clockwise direction. The rotation of gear (94) causes rotation of gear (95) having 8 teeth, which is attached to gear (94). The rotation of gear (95) leads to chain action of rotating gears (96) and gears (97 to 100) and Idler (106) mounted on hubs (101) to (103), (105) and (104) respectively. The rotation of gear (100) causes rotation of change gear (107) which is fixed to it, in clock-wise direction.<br>
The change gear (107) has 7 teeth and its rotation causes rotation of gear (108) having 354 teeth in anti-clockwise direction. The gear (108) is attached to the hard (7) over the said dial plate. This hand (7) rotates on the dial of watch in one lunar gear i.e. 354 days.<br>

Accordingly the hard (5) on the dial plate rotates once in 365 days. This hard (5) indicates the dates and months according to solar calender on the dial of watch, alongwith nakshatras, rasis, etc.The gears (91), (108) and (109) are supported on gear supporting plate (110).<br>
Referring to fig.4, the dial plate is provided with four hands (5,6,7,8). The hand (5) shows the solar date and month accordingly to Gregorian calender. The hand (6) shows the solar hours on 24 hour scale as well as 100 decimal hour scale. The hand (7) shows the lunar months like chaitra, Vaisakha, etc. The hand (8) shows the lunar dates known as tithis' with phases of moon such as full moon, new moon, etc. The elliptic ring (121) corresponds to the elliphic revolution of earth around the sun and shows the seasons in the countries in northern/southern hemisphere. The circular ring (122) on the dial shows the solar time on 1 to 24 hours scale thereby directly indicating AM/PM or day/night time.<br>
The circular ring (123) on the dial plate shows the decimal time on 100 hour scale which directly shows the decimal equivalent time of solar time. The rotating circular disc (42) rotated by gear (41), shows the local time of the desired countries/cities alongwith their respective meridians with the help of time zone ring (124). The circular rotating ring (124) shows the time zone 1 to 24 hour in anti-clock wise direction. The said time zone circular ring (124) together with said rotating disc (42) shows simultaneously the local time in the different countries printed on the said disc (42). The circular rotating ring (125) shows the different phases of moon, marked from 1 to 15, 1 to 14 and 30, in clockwise direction. The marking '15' shows full moon, the marking '30' shows new moon. The visibility of the moon surface increases from lunar dates 1 to 15 when it is full moon then decreases<br><br>
from lunar dates 1 to 14 and disappears on marking 30 known as new moon. The circular ring (126) shows the lunar months chaitra, vaisakha, etc. The circular ring (127) on the dial shows the solar months according to Gregorian calender.<br>
The circular ring (127a) on the dial shows the solar date according to Gregorian calender. The important dates of personal requirements can be marked on this ring.
