When the pow^r irom the Fjiigine is transmitted to the differential unit through the Bevel gear pair, the output shafts of the unit start rotating. Hie rotation of the output shails follows the formula 2N = Nl + N2 - (1) where as N is the Engine speed, N] is the right side output shaft speed and N2 is the left side output shaft speed<br>
While the vehicle control lever is in the park position the valves VI V2 and V3 are open as shown in figure 5 and therefore the hydraulic pump on RS sucks the oil and pumps the oil back into suction line. The LS pump sucks the oil and delivers back into the i eserv^oir, as shown in figure 5. Therefore the output shafts are free to rotate at any speed In the case of Epicyclic gear if X 1 is the speed of the Sun gear, X2 is the speed of planet can-ier and X is the speed of Annulus, X 1 " 4.5 X2 - 3.5 X Fommla (2). (Tlie aimulus is the output gear connected to the vehicle) wtiere as (Zl I- Z2) / Zl -4.5 andZ2 / Zl - 3.5<br>
Zl -"- No. of teeth on Sun gear - 24 Z2 ~ No. of teeth on annulus - 84<br><br>
If the lingme Speed is 1500, on applying fonnula (1) Nl will be equal to 2455 and N2 wall be equal to 545 Similarly if the Engine speed is 2000,N1 will be equal to .1273 and 1^2 wii! be equal to 727 If the Engine speed is 3000 Nl will be 4909 and NZwtUbe 1091.<br>
[n all these cases applymg the value of X 1 and X2 in fonnula (2), the output speed of F4)icyclic gear, le. the value of X will be zero; (Nl — X 1 andN2 " X2); and therefore the vehicle vAl\ be at stand still wlien the control lever is in the T' position.<br>
When the vehicle control lever is in F (Forward Position), till the Engine speed IS raised to 1500 the same situation will continue. At 1500 the Engine speed sensor will give a signaj to the SI swatch to operate valves V4, V2 and V3 of the Hydraulic circuit. Since V2 jmd V3 aie open the LS gear pump is freely running; but the RS geai pump is pumping through the valve V4 and the orifice Tl (Paif no.6 in figure 5) wiiich neslricls the speed of the RS pump to approximately 2454 RPM. This results in a reduction of the vehicle speed. It can be noted from formula (2), that the tendency of the right side pump will be to nm faster and the LS pump to run slower, during the fon^^ud movement of the vehicle. Since the right side pump can not nm faster, it will continue to run at the same speed at any engine speed during the forward moment. llie output speed of the ^icyciic gear, corresponding to 1500 to 2454 (Engine Speed) has been given below^ in Table I. Exaiuple: When l^ngine Speed is 2000^ the R.S. output shaft speed is 2454.<br>
Applymg Fomiula(l) -	2N -Nl f N2<br>
2x2000-2454 fN2<br>
Therefore N2 1=154<br>
Applying Fonnula(2) -	XI =4.5 X2 - 3.5 X<br>
XI - Nl &amp; X2 = N2<br>
'ITiereiwe 2454-4.5 x 1546 - 3.5X<br><br><br>
Ttie output speed is rtJiiging from 0 to 2454, to provide enough starting torque for the vehicle daring the initial staii,<br>
Al 2454 the speed sensor will give a signal to S2 switch to operate the valves V3 and V7 o£ the liydi^aulic circuit. In this condition the delivery of the RS Pump is directed to the suction side of the LS pump. Since R.S pump is always trying to run faster and the LS pump is dways trying to run slower^ the result will be both the puntps wtl! be nmning at the same speed. Hiis means both LS and RS output shafts and the Engine will run at the same speed; the output of the Epicyclic gear will also be the same as shown belov*^.<br>
Since both the pumps are running at the same speed, the output shafts to which<br>
these pumps are connected, will be mnning at the same speed. Since Right side<br>
output shaft of the differential gear unit is connected to the sun gear and the Left side<br>
output shaft is connected to planet cairier, both sun gear and the planet carrier will be<br>
runnmg at the same speed llierefore XI-X2,	XI=4.5 X2-3.5X	Since<br>
XI - X2<br><br>
llierefore At the speed of 2454 and above, L.S. and R.S. output shafts, and also the Epicyclic geai output shaft will be miming at the same speed of Engine. In this condition the Vehicle is in direct drive.<br><br>
At 5250 (Engine Speed) the speed seasor vAll give a signal to S3 switch to operate the valves V2, V3 md V5. Since V2 and V3 are open the L.S. Pump udll operate freeiy; but the R.S. pump will deliver through the alternate delivery line through the vaive V5 and orifice T2 (part no.7 in figure 5) which restricts the Speed of the RS pump to almost 5250. iTie speed of L.S andR.S output shafts and Epicyclic geai output at various luiguie speeds have been given below.(Table 11)<br><br>

5250 - 4,5 X 6750 - 3.5 X<br>
llterefore X ~ 7178    fn this condition the vehicle is in over drive.lliere is an option here to avoid over drive m w^ich case switch M2 has to be manually actuated.<br>
On return the vehicle speed will follow the same path till 5250 Engine Speed. Below 5250 Engine Speed, S3 will be deactuated and the vehicle will switch over to Direct Drive with the valves V3 and V7 opened. Below^ 2454 S2 will be deactuated; SI will take over to open V4, V2 &amp; V3; and the vehicle will follow the speed as already given in Table 1. Tfiere is an option here to avoid gear drive between 1500 and 2454 in u4iich case Ml has to be manually actuated. The vehicle will now continue in direct di ive tilt the control lever is shifted to park position.<br><br>
For the Reveise ilrive the control lever hiis to be shifted to 'R' position. At 1500 speed the speed sensor uiil operate S7 arid Valves V2, V6 and VI will open. Since VI us open R.S. pump will be operating freely; but L.S. pump will suck the fluid tfirough valve V2 and deliver through orifice T3 (Pati 10 in Figure 5) and the speed of L.S. pump will be limited to almost 546 RPM. llie vehicle will now move m reverse as given below. (Tjible III). It may be noted from the formula that during reverse, the L.S. Pump will always try to run at higher s|&gt;eed and the R.S. pump will try to mn at slower speed.<br>
Example: At 2000 Engine Speed XI - 4.5 X2 - 3.5 X 3454-4.5 X 546-3.5 X 'Hierefore    X - -285.<br>
Iliere is an option for High Torque fon\'ard drive, in this case the control lever has I o be brought to HF position, \^4iei"e in at Engine Speed 3208, the sensor will give a signal to S4 to operate V2, V3 &amp; V5. Since V2 &amp; V3 are open the L.S. pump wilt operate freely, llie R.S. pump will operate tlirough the alternate delivery line iiud the speed will be limited to at)out 5250 RPM. Hie vehicle speed will be as shown m Table IV. Below 3208, S4 will be deactuated and the vehicle will move in neutral .In this position the vehicle can have higher torque. This drive is basically meant for high ranges.<br><br>
Exjunpie: At 4000 liigine speeds, R.S. (hitput shaft speed is 5250. Applying formula (1) 2N -Ni + N2 'llierefore 2 x 4000 = 5250 t N2<br>
llierefore N2F275OJ<br>
Applying fonimia (2)    XI - 4.5X2 - 3.5X<br>

Therefore 5250 - 4.5 K 2750 - 3.5X<br>
Therefore X ^^^<br><br>
Tlie Ss^stein is dao provided with an option, wherein the vehicle speed will be controiied by the Microprocessor unit to meet the required torque at the exact time during the forvt'vird drive. (Please see item 6 in Figure 8). For this facility of "Drive by Wire"^ the vehicle contiol lever has to be brought to position CC. Please also see the flow control valve wth vai"iat)ie orifice (item 19 in Figure 5) diiven by the Hydraulic Piston controlled by the microprocessor, through the rack and pinion. (Item 20 and 21 in Figure: 5) In position CC, valves VI^ V2 iind V3 will be open and the vehicle will be in neutral. The microprocessor will now come into action, set the How control valve so as to limit the Right side output shaft speed to 3000 RPM, When the Engine Speed is increased tol833 RPM, S8 will be actuated to open valves V2, V3 and V8 so that the tlow^ will be diverted through alteniate route on the extreme ietl (Plesise see figure: 5). Tlie vehicle will now staii moving as given below.<br><br><br>
During the speed range from 1833 RPM to 3000 RPM the microprocessor ifislalled m the vehicle vtili continuously receive the data on the accelerator pedal positio!!, the suction pressure of the Engine, the Eiigine temperature, the RS output shall speed and the engine speed through sensors. If the Engine speed and the suction pressure matches with the accelerator pedai position^ and the temperature is steady, the indication is that the Engine produces enough torque required for the vehicle. On the other hand, if there is adiop in suction pressure along with the engine speed in relation to tlse acceieraior position, the microprocessor will give a signal and the hydiauiic piston will drive the flow control valve in anticlockwise direction to open more and to inciease the speed limit for the R.S. output shaft till sufficient Torque is made avmiable. At 3000 RPM speed, if sufficient torque is available, the Hydraulic Piston drives the How control valve and set the valve at 3000 RPM, if not already at 3000 RPM. If the conditions contmue to remain steady the microprocessor unit gives a signal to CI to open V3 mid V7. The vehicle will now move in Direct Drive. If over drive' is preferred the microprocessor will give a signal to CI at 5250 engine RPM to open V2, V3 and V8 and set the flow control valve restricting the maximum speed of R S shatt at 5250 RF*M. 'Hie vehicle will nownm in 'overdrive' under the simxe conditions, as given m t^A&gt;h 2 above. At any stage the microprocessor can give tmothdf signsd to CA to open V3 and V7, and opt 'direct drive'.<br><br>
Ihe coniroi lever can be replaced by 5 mechanically interlocked keys, for operational convenience and better aqppearance. At a time only one key will be active wiiile the 5 other keys wiU be niactive.<br><br><br>
Sirica the system provides continuous infinitely varile gear transmission the vehicle speed is aatomaticaliy jidjusted to meet the required torque resulting in better fuel elficiency, less pollution, less we'M^ and better driving comfort. Tlie high transmission ratio m the initial ra^tge provides higher Torque and better acceleration. The option {'or direct drive in busy roads to avoid higher gear ratio provides better fuel efficiency in compaiisoa with the existing automatic drive system. Since the same gear module, without any additional gear, provides reverse drive, over drive and neutral as well, the transmission efficiency is much higher, when compared with the conventional gear units. Hie provision for automatically moving to neutral on overloads protects the engine and transmission system to a great extent. Since the vehicle automatically moves to higher ratio in low^r speed range, the chances for the tyre skid on applying bnikes, are much less. Since there is an option for "High Torque forward drive" the vehicle can be conveniently used in high ranges. Tlie unit is also provided with an option for microprocessor control in which case the system will provide the vehicle, the exact torque at the exact time, resulting m the best fuel efficiency^ less pollution jind excellent driving comfort.<br><br><br><br>
I Claim<br>
1.	An Automatic Gear Transmission system comprising of a differential gear unit an epicyclic gear unit and a hydraulic control unit, when installed on a motor vehicle, provides continuous infinitety variable positive transmission right from zero, including reverse, through gears only, instead of the conventional transmission through belts, hydraulics or electricals, inaeases the capasity to a large extent; and provides better accderation, high torque for hill climbing, including "over drive% all with in one set of gear module, instead of each module provided in the conventional design, and thereby increasing the Transmission efficiency; Also provides protection against skidding since the vehide automatically moves to lower gear as soon as the brake is applied.<br>
2.	An Infinitely variable automatic gear Transmission System, as claimed in claim 1+ provided with microprocessor controlled flow control valve with variable orifice can<br>
adjust the veiacle speed to suit the exact torque requirement, based on engine speed+ suction pressure and engine Temperature, in relation to the accelerator position, and   thereby improves the fuel efficiency and reduces emissioa<br></td>
