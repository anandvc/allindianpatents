The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br>
Method for Forwarding Packet and Apparatus Thereof<br>
Field of the Technology<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to data communication technologies, more particularly to a method and an apparatus for forwarding packet.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) is a booming technique, which divides equipment in a Local Area Network (LAN) not physically but logically into segments, and thereby implementing virtual working groups.<br>
[0003] The IEEE 802.1Q standard draft defines a method for bearing several logical VLAN subnets on the same physical link. The IEEE 802.1Q adds four bytes into a standard IEEE802.3 Ethernet frame, wherein, the four bytes are called a Virtual Local Area Network Tag (VLAN Tag), as shown in Figure 1, which is a schematic diagram illustrating a structure of a virtual Ethernet frame based on the IEEE802.1Q. In the definition of the virtual Ethernet frame structure shown in Figure 1, a VLAN Tag is inserted between a source Media Access Control (MAC) address and a frame type. The VLAN Tag contains a type field of value 0x8100, which occupies two bytes and is used for identifying the Ethernet frame as a frame of the VLAN structure. The VLAN Tag also contains VLAN Identifier (VLAN-ID), which occupies 12 bits and can support 4096 VLAN instances.<br>
0004] Recently, with the widespread applications of the VLAN, especially in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs), each user will use one VLAN, which has made the 4096 VLAN instances defined in the virtual Ethernet frame structure become a bottleneck of the network development.<br>
[0005] In order to solve the problem, a QinQ technique, i.e. 802.1Q in 802.1Q technique for expanding the VLAN ID number is provided. It also can be called a VLAN stack technique. The QinQ technique satisfies the demand of networks by increasing the<br><br><br>
number of the VLAN ID.<br>
[0006] The QinQ technique adds a 4-bytes VLAN Tag into the existing 802.1Q frame. i.e., adds a 4 bytes VLAN Tag, which is completely the same as that in the 802.1Q. closely behind the VLAN Tag in the 802.1Q, as shown in figure' 2. Under such a design concept and a scheme, the QinQ technique is completely compatible with all the characteristics of the original 802.1Q VLAN. Meanwhile, the added 12-bit VLAN ID makes the number of available VLAN IDs reach as high as 24 bits, therefore satisfying the demand for the VLAN ID under diversified circumstances.<br>
[0007] In the related art, the QinQ technique is implemented as follows: a network device which supports the QinQ technique, such as a convergence switch, a router, a broadband access server, etc., receives an Ethernet packet with only one VLAN Tag sent by a user access device. It encapsulates another VLAN Tag into the packet according to a standard VLAN tagging technique, such as in-port number, or out-port number, before forwarding the packet to a backbone network.<br>
[0008] The existing VLAN tagging techniques includes: port-based VLAN tagging techniques, MAC-based VLAN tagging techniques, network layer based VLAN tagging techniques and Internet Protocol (IP) multicast based VLAN tagging techniques.<br>
[0009] Although the second VLAN Tag in the related art can provide a VLAN lag number as long as 24 bits, the two VLAN tags contained in the Ethernet packet can only reflect physical features of the Ethernet packet, such as out-port information of the Ethernet packet, MAC address information, etc., while not reflecting service information corresponding to the Ethernet packet. Therefore, after the backbone network receives an Ethernet packet forwarded by the convergence switch, it cannot process the Ethernet packet according to corresponding service features of the Ethernet packet, and cannot implement service management and control in operations.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
[0051] In order to make the technical solution and the advantages of the present invention clearer, the present invention will be described in detail hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings and embodiments.<br>
[0052] In embodiments of the present invention, a corresponding relationship between the physical feature and the service feature of a packet is set. After receiving a packet, obtain the service feature according to the physical feature of the packet, and encapsulate the service feature into the packet.<br>
[0053] Wherein, the physical feature of a packet includes: out-port number, MAC address, network address, IP multicast, or VLAN Tag. The service feature of a packet includes: service-related features, such as service type, or service priority, etc.<br>
[0054] After the service feature corresponding to the packet is encapsulated into the packet, network devices can process the packet according to the service feature encapsulated in the packet.<br>
[0055] A basic flowchart according to an embodiment of the present invention is shown in Figure 3, including the following steps:<br>
[0056]    Step 301: receive a packet, and obtain the physical feature of the packet;<br>
[0057] Step 302: find the corresponding relationship between the physical feature and the service feature according to the obtained physical feature, and obtain service feature of the packet;<br>
[0058] Step 303: encapsulate the service feature of the packet into the packet, and forward the packet.<br>
[0059]    In the following embodiment, the first VLAN Tag of an Ethernet packet is taken<br><br><br><br>
as the physical feature of the Ethernet packet, and the second VLAN Tag is taken as the service feature of the Ethernet packet. Corresponding relationship between the first VLAN Tag and the second VLAN Tag of the Ethernet packet is set. The Ethernet packet will be shortened as packet hereinafter.<br>
[0060] Wherein, the first VLAN Tag is the VLAN Tag defined by the 802.1Q. And the second VLAN Tag is: the second layer VLAN Tag encapsulated following the QinQ technique, and the second VLAN Tag can be encapsulated either in the inner layer or in the outer layer.<br>
[0061] The corresponding relationship between the service feature, which is represented by the second VLAN Tag, and the first VLAN Tag is determined according to the requirements of practical operation circumstances and practical applications. Wherein, the corresponding relationship can be: the corresponding relationship between the service priority of the packet and the first VLAN Tag; or, the corresponding relationship between the service type of the packet and the first VLAN Tag, etc.<br>
[0062] In this embodiment, the corresponding relationship between the second VLAN Tag and the first VLAN Tag is: the corresponding relationship between the service type of the packet and the VLAN identifier of the first VLAN Tag.<br>
[0063] For example, under practical circumstances, if the value of the VLAN identifier carried in the VLAN Tag is between 1~2K, it corresponds to Internet browse services. And the value between 2~3K corresponds to SOHO services or commercial services, the value between 3~4K corresponds to Voice over IP (VoIP) services or video services. Therefore, the corresponding relationship between the first VLAN Tag and the second VLAN Tag is: if the value of the VLAN identifier of the first VLAN Tag is between I-2K. the second VLAN Tag it corresponds is 1. And if the value is between 2-3K, the second VLAN Tag it corresponds is 10, if the value is between 3~4K, the second VLAN Tag it corresponds is 1000, etc. At this time, the value 1 of the second VLAN Tag represents Internet browse services; the value 10 of the second VLAN Tag represents SOI 10 services or commercial services; and the value 1000 of the second VLAN Tag represents VoIP services or video services.<br><br><br>
[0064] The present embodiment illustrates the procedure of a convergence switch receiving a packet which is sent by a user access device and forwarding the packet to a network device in the backbone network. The procedure is shown in Figure 4, which includes the following steps:<br>
[0065]     Step 401: a convergence switch receives a packet sent by a user access device.<br>
[0066] Step 402: the convergence switch processes the received packet according to packet receiving strategies.<br>
[0067] Wherein, the packet receiving strategies includes diversified security inspections and bandwidth control strategies.<br>
[0068] Step 403: the convergence switch determines whether it supports the QinQ function, if it supports, goes to Step 404; otherwise, goes to Step 409.<br>
[0069] Step 404: the convergence switch obtains the first VLAN Tag contained in the received packet.<br>
[0070] Step 405: search the corresponding relationship between the first VLAN Tag and the second VLAN Tag, and obtain the second VLAN Tag according to the first VLAN Tag.<br>
[0071] For example, when the value of the VLAN identifier of the first VLAN Tag is between 1~2K, the corresponding second VLAN Tag is 1, which representing Internet browse services. When the value of the VLAN identifier of the first VLAN Tag is between 2~3K, the corresponding second VLAN Tag is 10, which representing SOI 10 services or commercial services, when the value of the VLAN identifier of the first VLAN Tag is between 3-4K, the corresponding second VLAN Tag is 1000. which represents VoIP services or video services.<br>
[0072] Wherein, the corresponding relationship between the first VLAN Tag and the second VLAN Tag can be configured through command-line, network manager or other configuration methods, or can be a fixed strategy implemented by hardware or software<br><br><br>
[0073]     Step 406: encapsulate the obtained second VLAN Tag into the received packet.<br>
[0074] Step 407: forward the packet carrying the second VLAN Tag to the network device in the backbone network. During this procedure, the packet can also be processed according to packet strategies. And the current procedure is ended.<br>
[0075] Wherein, the packet transmission strategies include diversified security inspections and bandwidth control strategies.<br>
[0076]    Step 408: end the current procedure.<br>
[0077] The convergence switch can process each packet it receives according to the steps shown in Figure 4.<br>
[0078] Since a second VLAN Tag is carried in the packet forwarded to the network device in the backbone network by the convergence switch, and the second VLAN Fag in the packet can identify the service type of the packet, the network device in the backbone network can process the packet according to the service feature of the packet. For example, if the service feature is the service priority, then the network device in the backbone network can first process the packets with higher priorities, which satisfies different requirement of users with different priorities.<br>
[0079] In the present invention, except for encapsulating a service feature into the packet according to the physical feature of the packet, it is also possible to set corresponding relationships between the physical feature and at least one physical Feature and/or at least one service feature according to the requirement oi~ the practical circumstances. After the packet is received, at least one physical feature and/or at least one service feature are (is) encapsulated into the packet according to the corresponding relationships. Therefore, the packet can carry more information.<br>
[0080] After the packet encapsulated with at least one physical feature and/or at least one service feature is received, the encapsulated at least one physical feature and/or at least one service feature are (is) removed, and the packet is forwarded.<br><br><br>
[0081] Correspondingly, in the above embodiment, the QinQ technique can only support two VLAN Tags. Therefore, in order to carry more physical and/or service features, more VLAN Tags can be set into the packet, the number of the VLAN tags is equal to the number of the physical and/or service features to be encapsulated into the packet. According to the number of the physical and/or service features encapsulated in the packet, the number of the VLAN Tag can be three, four, or more. The format of the added VLAN Tag is the same as that of the original VLAN Tag in' the packet. Figure 5 is a diagram illustrating a frame structure of a packet with three VLAN Tags. Figure 6 is a diagram illustrating a frame structure of a packet with multiple VLAN Tags. In addition, other information can also be carried in the packet by the additionally set VLAN Tags. And the number of the VLAN Tags is not limited.<br>
[0082] When the convergence switch receives the packet with multiple VLAN Tags from the network device in the backbone network, it only needs to remove the encapsulated VLAN Tags layer by layer to finish the de-encapsulation, and then forwards the packet to the user access device.<br>
[0083] In addition, an embodiment of the invention provides a packet forwarding apparatus corresponding to the packet forwarding method. The structure of the apparatus is shown in Figure 7, which includes a reception unit 71 and a transmitter unit 72.<br>
[0084] The reception unit 71, used for receiving a packet and obtaining a physical feature of the packet; and obtaining a service feature of the packet according to the obtained physical feature; and encapsulating the service feature of the packet into the packet;<br>
[0085] the transmitter unit 72, used for transmitting a packet that has been encapsulated with a service feature.<br>
[0086] Wherein, the reception unit 71 further includes a unit used for encapsulating at least one physical feature and/or at least one service feature into the packet. Accordingly. the transmitter unit 72 further includes a unit used for transmitting a packet containing at least one physical feature and/or at least one service feature.<br><br><br>
[0087] When the apparatus needs to de-encapsulate a packet which has been encapsulated with at least one physical feature and/or at least one service feature, the reception unit 71 further includes a unit used for receiving a packet containing at least one physical feature and/or at least one service feature, and removing the at least one physical feature and/or at least one service feature contained in the; packet. Accordingly, the transmitter unit 72 further includes a unit used for transmitting a packet whose physical feature and/or service feature have (has) been removed by the reception unit 71;<br>
[0088] or, the transmitter unit 72 further includes a unit used for receiving a packet containing at least one physical feature and/or at least one service feature, and removing the at least one physical feature and/or at least one service feature contained in the packet. The reception unit 71 further includes a unit used for transmitting a packet whose physical feature and/or service feature have (has) been removed by the transmitter unit.<br>
