DESCRIPTION NOVEL PYRIDINE DERIVATIVE AND PYRIMIDINE DERIVATIVE (3) Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a novel pyridine derivative and pyrimidine derivative, a salt thereof or a hydrate of the foregoing, having inhibitory activity against hepatocyte growth factor receptor, anti-tumor activity, inhibitory activity against angiogenesis, inhibitory activity against cancer metastasis or the like. Background Art<br>
[0002] Overexpression of hepatocyte growth factor receptor (hereafter referred to as "HGFR") is reported in various kinds of tumors such as a pancreatic cancer, a gastric cancer, a colorectal cancer, a breast cancer, a prostate cancer, a lung cancer, a renal cancer, a brain tumor or an ovarian cancer (non-patent document 1). HGFR expressed in these cancer cells is considered to be involved in cancer malignancy (aberrant growth, invasion or enhanced metastasis), because HGFR cause autophosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine kinase constitutively or upon stimulation by hepatocyte growth factor (hereafter referred to as HGF). [0003] It is also reported that HGFR is expressed in vascular endothelial cells and is involved in tumor angiogenesis since HGF stimulates HGFR to facilitate proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells (non-patent document 2). [0004] Furthermore, NK4, an antagonistic peptide for HGF, is reported to block HGF-HGFR signal to inhibit invasion of cancer cells and tumor angiogenesis (nonpatent documents 3 and 4).<br>
[0005] Therefore, a compound having inhibitory activity against HGFR is expected to be useful as an anti-tumor agent, an angiogenesis inhibitor or an inhibitor for cancer metastasis.<br>
[0006] With regard to documents disclosing a low molecular weight compound having inhibitory activity against HGFR, the patent documents 1 to 11 are listed. However, the patent documents 1 and 2 disclose indolinone derivatives; the patent documents 3 and 4 disclose quinoline derivatives and quinazoline derivatives; the patent documents 5 and 6 disclose imidazole derivatives; the patent document 7 discloses aminopyridine derivatives and aminopyrazine derivatives; the patent document 8 discloses triazolopyrazine derivatives and imidazopyrazine derivatives; the patent document 9 discloses tetracyclic derivatives; the patent document 10<br><br>
discloses triazolotriazine derivatives; the patent document 11 discloses pyrrole derivatives; therefore the compounds disclosed in these documents are obviously different in the structure from pyridine derivatives and pyrimidine derivatives according to the present invention.<br>
[0007] The patent documents 12 and 13 disclose pyridine derivatives and pyrimidine derivatives similar in the structure to the compounds according to the present invention. The patent documents 12 and 13, however, do not disclose inhibitory activity against HGFR of the compounds disclosed in the patent documents 12 and 13 as well as the compounds according to the present invention.

Effect of the Invention<br>
[0012] The compound according to the present invention has an inhibitory activity<br>
against HGFR tyrosine kinase (Pharmacological Test Examples 1 and 3), and thus<br>
inhibits   proliferation   of  human   cancer   cells   caused   by   HGFR   activation<br>
(Pharmacological Test Example 2).    The compound according to the present<br>
invention also inhibits migration of human cancer cells (Pharmacological Test<br>
Example 4).    Furthermore, the compound according to the present invention<br>
inhibits   proliferation   of  vascular   endothelial   cells   via   HGF-HGFR   signal<br>
(Pharmacological Test Example 7).<br><br>
[0013] Overexpression of HGFR is reported to involve in malignancy of cancer (overgrouth, invasion and enhanced metastasis) in a pancreatic cancer, a gastric cancer, a colorectal cancer, a breast cancer, a prostate cancer, a lung cancer, a renal cancer, a brain tumor, an ovarian cancer and a blood cancer (Cancer Research, 54, 5775-5778 (1994); Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communication, 189, 227-232 (1992); Oncogene, 7, 181-185 (1992); Cancer, 82, 15134520 (1998); J.

The cytoplasmic domain of HGFR (Genbank Accession No. J02958) is a 1.3kb DNA fragment beginning with Lys974 and including a stop codon, and described by Park et al (Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL U.S.A. 84(18), 6379-6383, 1987). The DNA fragment was isolated from the human placental cDNA library (purchased from Clontech) by PCR (TaKaRa Ex Taq™ Kit, purchased from TaKaRa) using two kinds of primers (SEQ ID NO: 1, 5'-CCGGCCGGATCCAAAAAGAGAAAGCAAATTAAA-35 and SEQ ID NO: 2, 5' -TTAATTCTGC AGCT ATGATGTCTCCC AGAAGGA-3', purchased from Invitrogen), The DNA fragment was cloned into a baculovirus transplace vector (pFastBac ~HT (purchased from GIBCO BRL)) to produce a recombinant construct. The construct was transfected into insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda 9(Sf9)) to produce a solution of HGFR transfected baculovirus (preparation of a recombinant baculovirus can be found in the standard text (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (GIBCO BRL)). The cloning of the other receptor tyrosine kinases and preparation of the recombinant baculovirus solutions were prepared using a cytoplasmic fragment starting from Lys791 (VEGFR2, Genbank Accession No.L04947), a cytoplasmic fragment starting from Lys398 (FGFR1, Genbank Accession No.X52833) and a cytoplasmic fragment starting from Lys558 (PDGFRP, Genbank Accession No.M21616) in stead of HGFR in the above method.

Industrial Applicability<br>
[0383] A compound according to the present invention has excellent HGFR inhibitory activity, and is useful as an anti-tumor agent against various kinds of tumors such as a pancreatic cancer, a gastric cancer, a colorectal cancer, a breast cancer, a prostate cancer, a lung cancer, a renal cancer, a brain tumor and an ovarian cancer, an inhibitor against angiogenesis or a cancer metastasis inhibitor.<br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION NOVEL PYRIDINE DERIVATIVE AND PYRIMIDINE DERIVATIVE (3) Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a novel pyridine derivative and pyrimidine derivative, a salt thereof or a hydrate of the foregoing, having inhibitory activity against hepatocyte growth factor receptor, anti-tumor activity, inhibitory activity against angiogenesis, inhibitory activity against cancer metastasis or the like. Background Art<br>
[0002] Overexpression of hepatocyte growth factor receptor (hereafter referred to as "HGFR") is reported in various kinds of tumors such as a pancreatic cancer, a gastric cancer, a colorectal cancer, a breast cancer, a prostate cancer, a lung cancer, a renal cancer, a brain tumor or an ovarian cancer (non-patent document 1). HGFR expressed in these cancer cells is considered to be involved in cancer malignancy (aberrant growth, invasion or enhanced metastasis), because HGFR cause autophosphorylation of intracellular tyrosine kinase constitutively or upon stimulation by hepatocyte growth factor (hereafter referred to as HGF). [0003] It is also reported that HGFR is expressed in vascular endothelial cells and is involved in tumor angiogenesis since HGF stimulates HGFR to facilitate proliferation and migration of vascular endothelial cells (non-patent document 2). [0004] Furthermore, NK4, an antagonistic peptide for HGF, is reported to block HGF-HGFR signal to inhibit invasion of cancer cells and tumor angiogenesis (nonpatent documents 3 and 4).<br>
[0005] Therefore, a compound having inhibitory activity against HGFR is expected to be useful as an anti-tumor agent, an angiogenesis inhibitor or an inhibitor for cancer metastasis.<br>
[0006] With regard to documents disclosing a low molecular weight compound having inhibitory activity against HGFR, the patent documents 1 to 11 are listed. However, the patent documents 1 and 2 disclose indolinone derivatives; the patent documents 3 and 4 disclose quinoline derivatives and quinazoline derivatives; the patent documents 5 and 6 disclose imidazole derivatives; the patent document 7 discloses aminopyridine derivatives and aminopyrazine derivatives; the patent document 8 discloses triazolopyrazine derivatives and imidazopyrazine derivatives; the patent document 9 discloses tetracyclic derivatives; the patent document 10<br><br>
discloses triazolotriazine derivatives; the patent document 11 discloses pyrrole derivatives; therefore the compounds disclosed in these documents are obviously different in the structure from pyridine derivatives and pyrimidine derivatives according to the present invention.<br>
[0007] The patent documents 12 and 13 disclose pyridine derivatives and pyrimidine derivatives similar in the structure to the compounds according to the present invention. The patent documents 12 and 13, however, do not disclose inhibitory activity against HGFR of the compounds disclosed in the patent documents 12 and 13 as well as the compounds according to the present invention.

Effect of the Invention<br>
[0012] The compound according to the present invention has an inhibitory activity<br>
against HGFR tyrosine kinase (Pharmacological Test Examples 1 and 3), and thus<br>
inhibits   proliferation   of  human   cancer   cells   caused   by   HGFR   activation<br>
(Pharmacological Test Example 2).    The compound according to the present<br>
invention also inhibits migration of human cancer cells (Pharmacological Test<br>
Example 4).    Furthermore, the compound according to the present invention<br>
inhibits   proliferation   of  vascular   endothelial   cells   via   HGF-HGFR   signal<br>
(Pharmacological Test Example 7).<br><br>
[0013] Overexpression of HGFR is reported to involve in malignancy of cancer (overgrouth, invasion and enhanced metastasis) in a pancreatic cancer, a gastric cancer, a colorectal cancer, a breast cancer, a prostate cancer, a lung cancer, a renal cancer, a brain tumor, an ovarian cancer and a blood cancer (Cancer Research, 54, 5775-5778 (1994); Biochemical and Biophysical Research Communication, 189, 227-232 (1992); Oncogene, 7, 181-185 (1992); Cancer, 82, 15134520 (1998); J.

The cytoplasmic domain of HGFR (Genbank Accession No. J02958) is a 1.3kb DNA fragment beginning with Lys974 and including a stop codon, and described by Park et al (Proc. Natl. Acad. ScL U.S.A. 84(18), 6379-6383, 1987). The DNA fragment was isolated from the human placental cDNA library (purchased from Clontech) by PCR (TaKaRa Ex Taq™ Kit, purchased from TaKaRa) using two kinds of primers (SEQ ID NO: 1, 5'-CCGGCCGGATCCAAAAAGAGAAAGCAAATTAAA-35 and SEQ ID NO: 2, 5' -TTAATTCTGC AGCT ATGATGTCTCCC AGAAGGA-3', purchased from Invitrogen), The DNA fragment was cloned into a baculovirus transplace vector (pFastBac ~HT (purchased from GIBCO BRL)) to produce a recombinant construct. The construct was transfected into insect cells (Spodoptera frugiperda 9(Sf9)) to produce a solution of HGFR transfected baculovirus (preparation of a recombinant baculovirus can be found in the standard text (Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System (GIBCO BRL)). The cloning of the other receptor tyrosine kinases and preparation of the recombinant baculovirus solutions were prepared using a cytoplasmic fragment starting from Lys791 (VEGFR2, Genbank Accession No.L04947), a cytoplasmic fragment starting from Lys398 (FGFR1, Genbank Accession No.X52833) and a cytoplasmic fragment starting from Lys558 (PDGFRP, Genbank Accession No.M21616) in stead of HGFR in the above method. EGFR was purchased from Sigma (Production No. E-2645). [0353] 2. Expression and purification of receptor tyrosine kinases<br>

The supernatant was loaded onto an Ni-NTA agarose column (3 ml, purchased from Qiagen) equilibrated with 30 ml of Buffer A (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol5 500 mM KC1, 20 mM imidazole and 10 % (v/v) glycerol). The column was washed with 30 ml of Buffer A, 6 ml of Buffer B (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 1 M KC1, and 10 % (v/v) glycerol) and 6 ml of Buffer A in this order. Then, the column was eluted with 6 ml of Buffer C (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.5), 5 mM 2-mercaptoethanol, 100 mM KC1, 100 mM imidazole, and 10 % (v/v) glycerol) to provide a fraction. The fraction was entrapped in a dialysis membrane (purchased from Spectrum Laboratories), dialyzed at 4 °C overnight with 1 L of dialysis buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 10 % (v/v) glycerol, 1 mM dithiothreitol, 0.1 mM Na3V04 and 0.1 mM EGTA), and stored at -80 °C until used. An aliquot of the dialyzed fraction was subjected to SDS electrophoresis, and then a recombinant protein (His6-HGFR, the HGFR cytoplasmic domain fused with six histidine at the N terminus) detected at a molecular weight of about 60 kDa when stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue, was determined with regard to protein content using BSA (purchased from Sigma) as a standard. The VEGFR2 cytoplasmic domain, the FGFR1 cytoplasmic domain, and the PDGFRp cytoplasmic domain were fused with six histidine at the N terminus by the similar method to produce respective recombinant proteins (His6-VEGFR2, His6-FGFR1, and His6- PDGFRp).
