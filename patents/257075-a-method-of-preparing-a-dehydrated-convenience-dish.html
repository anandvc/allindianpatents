CONVENIENCE    DISH    AND    METHOD    FOR PREPARING THEREOF;<br>
SATYANARAYAN SEKHSARIA PVT. LTD., A COMPANY INCORPORATED UNDER THE COMPANIES ACT, 1956, WHOSE ADDRESS IS 11-A, MITTAL CHAMBERS, NARIMAN POINT, MUMBAI -400 021, MAHARASHTRA, INDIA.<br>
THE	FOLLOWING	SPECIFICATION<br>
PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a convenience dish, method for preparing the convenience dish and a package containing the same thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Typically, convenience food is available as a processed food, pre-cooked food or completely prepared meals or a dish. These foods require minimum preparation, typically just heating, and are packaged for a long shelf life with little loss of flavor and nutrients over time. The use of convenience food is becoming more popular as it reduces the time of the consumer in the kitchen for preparation of the food or has even avoided the preparation of dish.<br>
Today, the emerging trend of convenience food has captured a wide range of market and has been enjoying great popularity now among tourists, working people, and amongst those who neither have a desire nor time to prepare and cook a dish.<br>
There are various types of convenience food available in the market such as pre cooked food, ready-to-eat food, dehydrated food, two-minute noodles etc.<br>
In case of the pre-cooked convenience food known or available, the consumer has to spend time for cooking the food again before consuming. Also, it is frequently noted that the pre-cooked food needs to be prepared as a dish before being consumed that leads the consumer to spend more time in preparing the dish. Moreover, the pre-cooked food has considerable moisture content and has the problem of shelf life.<br>
The time consumed by the consumer in preparing a dish is considerably reduced in ready-to-eat food available in the market or known in the art. The ready-to-eat food or dishes are available as packages that need to be heated for atleast about 15 to 20 minutes (min.). in boiling water and consumed thereafter. Alternatively, such ready-to-eat food can be emptied into a container and heated in a microwave oven for few seconds to few minutes and consumed as it is. However, most of the ready-to-eat food<br><br><br>
known is packaged in a wet form having very high moisture content. As the product is 'wet' it requires sterilization to avoid microbiological contamination in the package that leads to food spoilage. The process of sterilization is carried out under severe processing conditions, which affects the characteristics, flavor and taste of the food.<br>
The dehydrated foods known in the art solves the problem of shelf life that is it increases the shelf life of the food product.<br>
US Patent 2,278,472 discloses a dehydrated, prefrozen food product, particularly to the preparation and preservation of foodstuffs so that they may be prepared or cooked by the consumer in substantially less time than heretofore possible for the ordinarily dried foodstuff. The patent also describes a process of producing a dehydrated prefrozen food product by slowly freezing the food and dehydrating the food, wherein slow freezing results in the formation of large ice crystal that causes consequent rupture of the cells and destruction of the structure of the food material and hence, cannot be used for ready-to-eat food as it will disrupt the structure of the food material. The patent also discloses the extent of dehydration that may be done depending upon the nature of the food, degree of softening and rupturing of the cell structure; however the desirable moisture content should be between 30% and 95%. This moisture content would also lead to problems on long-term storage of the food product. It is also known that if the moisture content of the dehydrated food is reduced, then rehydration of the food takes a longer time or needs additional cooking or steaming of the food. Further, the patent also discloses rehydration of the dehydrated food done by steaming or precooking in hot water. Hence, it requires further preparation and/ or cooking of the food, and/or dish before consuming.<br>
US Patent 5089281 discloses a preparation of quick cooking, wherein the quick-cooking rice product is prepared by first cooking rice at substantial atmospheric pressure in an amount of water at least sufficient to hydrate the rice to a moisture content of about 60% to 75% by weight and at a temperature of about 90°C to 100°C for about 1 min. to 10 min. for hydrating the rice to moisture content of about 30% to 60% by weight. The water<br><br><br>
cooked rice then is steam pressure cooked in water with agitation at a pressure of about 250 mm Hg to about 2500 mm Hg above atmospheric pressure for about 1 min. to 50 min. for further hydrating and gelatinizing the rice for obtaining a cooked rice which has a moisture content of about 60% to 75% by weight and which is about 85% to 100% gelatinized. After steam pressure-cooking, the pressure is gradually released for avoiding puffing the cooked rice. The cooked rice then is dried at a temperature for about 140°C to 205°C. The invention requires two steps for cooking rice, wherein the rice is first cooked under pressure for the purpose of hydration and is than steam pressure cooked with agitation. Further, drying of the rice is carried out in two steps, wherein first being under stationary conditions and second under agitated condition. The process claimed in this patent is only applicable to rice varieties, hence it cannot be used for any other food and food products.<br>
In general, the available convenience foods require the step of cooking, preparing, warming, pre-steaming or heating before consuming. They also have a problem of loss of flavor, taste due to processing and storage methods as they contain considerable amount of moisture.<br>
Generally, such convenience food is prepared by partially or completely cooking the food followed by drying or dehydrating the food to remove excess moisture. Alternative methods known are cooking and freezing the food and packing in a sterile condition.<br>
US patent 2,713,003 describes a method for producing reconstitutable dehydrated food products, by dehydration, and particularly to a method of preparing readily reconstitutable dehydrated food products, in which the food products are given a preliminary conditioning treatment which facilitates removal of the moisture there from during a subsequent dehydration operation in which apparatus and methods generally used in the food drying industry may be availed of. One aspect of the invention provides preconditioning of the food product by freezing it. However, dehydration of the foodstuff is cumbersome. The rehydration of the food requires cooking before consumption.<br><br><br>
The European Patent 0,803,204 provides a desiccated culinary preparation. The desiccated culinary preparation is protected for conservation against hydration by an essentially hydrophobic layer formed by frying or cooking in an oily medium. The layer is partially traversed by hydrophilic portions to enable the inner hydrophilic structure of the preparation to be rehydrated for consumption. Rehydration may be carried out prior to consumption by external contacting or spraying with water or the like or during consumption, by the saliva when chewing the preparation. The patent also describes a process comprising the steps of cooking or frying the product to form the hydrophobic outer layer, chilling the cooked product to freeze the liquid water content therein and thereafter subjecting the product to dehydration treatment such as a lyophilization cycle to sublime the frozen water content and evaporate the free oil content.<br>
There are several brands of food related enterprises available that provides ready-to-eat, ready-to-cook food that are often available in a packaged form. These products require cooking by direct or indirect heating of the product for at least 5 min. For e.g. by putting the pack in boiling water or hot water for atleast 5 min., or by putting the product in a microwavable container and heating. These products are available in RETORT pouches, and the steps required to produce these product is cooking the food, packing the cooked food in a suitable material followed by sterilizing the packaged product in a retort to eliminate micro organisms and to improve the shelf life, wherein the shelf life of these products varied from 9 to 12 months.<br>
However, in all such convenience food prepared by the above methods, the consumer has to prepare a dish before consuming the food, which is time consuming. Ready-to-eat food products are not dehydrated, as they are prepared by retort method and hence, have to be packed in "wet" form to retain the flavor and taste of the dish.<br>
There occurs a problem of preparing such dehydrated dish preparation as convenience food, as a dish preparation will include not only the dehydrated food and food product, but also the condiments, flavors and other ingredients made by a specific recipe. So, when a convenience dehydrated dish is prepared by methods known in the art, there is<br><br><br>
maximum drip loss, considerable loss of energy, fuel, due to repeated series of freezing and thawing. Also, there is loss of original characteristics of the dish, due to repetitive handling of the food. Further, all these factors affect the final texture of the dehydrated dish and hence make it difficult to rehydrate.<br>
Hence, there is a need to produce a dehydrated convenience dish that retains original characteristics, and can be reconstituted in a short span of time by adding liquid and does not require further step of preparation, cooking or warming, thereby providing a fully rehydrated meal with an excellent palatable feeling. The convenience dish has less moisture content, long shelf life and no chances of spoilage.<br>
There is also a need to provide a method to produce said convenience dish, wherein the method should be such that it is not cumbersome and can be used to prepare said convenience dish of all food including grains, cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits, milk and milk products, meat and meat products, seafood, poultry and combinations thereof.<br>
Further, the convenience dish, method for preparing the same and the packaging techniques should be such that, seasonal foods are made available throughout the year.<br>
OBJECT OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a convenience dish that can be rehydrated with a liquid within few minutes, such that it provides a readily served dish that retains the original characteristic, flavor, taste and aroma of the dish.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a convenience dish that requires no further cooking, boiling or preparation for rehydration, and hence saves time and effort.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a convenience dish having long shelf life, light -weight and easily transportable.<br>
It is also an object of the present invention to provide a convenience dish providing seasonal food throughout the year.<br><br><br>
Further, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method for preparing said convenience dish thereof.<br>
Yet, it is an object of the present invention to provide a method that can be used for all types and kinds of food.<br>
Further, the object of the present invention is to provide a package containing said convenience dish without a preservative.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a convenience dish having moisture content of less than 7% and that can be rehydrated with a liquid within 3minutes (min.). Moreover, the present invention provides a method for preparing said convenience dish and a package containing the dish thereof. The convenience dish of the present invention includes but not limited to, cereal dish, pulse dish, vegetable dish, fruit dish, milk and milk products dish, meat and meat product dish, poultry dish, seafood dish and combination thereof.<br>
The terms as used herein for the purpose of the present invention are described below:<br>
As used herein the term "Convenience" refers to foods, which are designed to save consumers time, reduce wastage from spoilage, and reduce financial costs using economies of scale. These foods require minimum preparation, typically just heating, and are packaged for a long shelf life with little loss of flavor and nutrients over time. They were developed specifically to preserve the oversupply of agricultural products in order to stabilize the food markets in developed countries.<br>
As used herein the term "dish" refers to a specific food preparation, a "distinct article or variety of food", ready- to- eat, wherein the dish may be served on dishware, or may be eaten out of hand.<br><br><br>
As used herein the term "recipe" refers to a set of instructions that show how to prepare or make something, especially a dish.<br>
As used herein the term "preparing" refers to execution of the recipe resulting in a dish.<br>
As used herein the term "cooking" refers to a vast range of methods, tools, and combinations of ingredients to improve the flavor or digestibility of food, wherein the range of temperatures varies for different foods, wherein Cooking requires applying heat to a food, which usually, though not always, physically and chemically transforms it, thus changing its flavor, texture, appearance, and nutritional properties.<br>
As used in the present invention the term "Dehydration" is defined as the application of heat under controlled conditions to remove the majority of the moisture content normally present in a food by evaporation or in case of freeze drying by sublimation. This definition excludes other unit operations, which remove water from foods (eg. Mechanical separations, membrane concentrations, and baking) as these normally remove much less water than dehydration.<br>
As used herein the term "freezing" is defined as a unit operation in which the temperature of a food is reduced below the freezing point, and a proportion of moisture undergoes a change in state to form ice crystals.<br>
As used herein the term "rehydration" refers to reconstitution of the moisture lost through dehydration.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention provides a method for preparing the convenience dish having the steps of preparing and cooking the dish, freezing the dish, followed by dehydrating the dish to a moisture content of less than 7%. The convenience dish thus obtained may be readily served within 3min. by the process of rehydration as provided by the present invention.<br>
The method of the present invention for preparing convenience dish can be used for all types of food including but not limited to cereals, pulses, vegetables, fruits, milk and milk products, meat and meat products, poultry, sea food and combinations thereof.<br><br><br>
The dehydrated convenience dish as prepared by the method of the present invention has moisture content of less than 7%, is light weight and can be rehydrated with a liquid within 3min. or in microwave within few sec. thereby providing a ready to serve dish that needs no further cooking, boiling, or preparation. The convenience dish has a shelf life of not less than 2yrs., microporous structure and is bright in colour. Further, the convenience dish also provides all types of seasonal food through out the year.<br>
The convenience dish that can be prepared from the present invention includes but not limited to cereal dish, pulse dish, vegetable dish, milk and milk products, meat and meat products, poultry dish, seafood dish and combination thereof.<br>
The liquid used for rehydrating the convenience dish includes water, juices, milk and milk products, beverages, stew,broth, extracts, concentrates and combinations thereof, wherein the ratio of weight of the convenience dish to liquid is about 1:2 to 1:9.<br>
In the present invention, the step of preparation and cooking provides a dish that is palatable, digestible, has desired quality, characteristic, flavor, texture, taste and the like, and is ready to be served.<br>
Preparing and cooking the dish may be carried out using a recipe. Further, cooking of the dish can be carried out by any conventional method of cooking.<br>
However for the purpose of the present invention, the desired quality, characteristic, flavor, texture, taste etc. can be obtained if the dish is cooked under pressure.<br>
Freezing the cooked dish results in the formation of small ice crystals within and between the cells of the dish, that results in the piercing but not rupturing of a large number of cell wall and outer surface or skin of the food material used for preparing the dish. The step of freezing also results in the liberation of combined or molecular water, thereby assisting in its subsequent liberation during the dehydrating operation.<br><br><br>
Freezing can be carried out by conventionally used mechanical freezing systems such as chest freezers, blast freezers, individual quick freezers and the likes.<br>
For the purpose of the present invention, it is desirable to carry out the freezing treatment in such way and at such a temperature, that there will not be the formation of large ice crystals with the consequent rupture of the cells, structure of the food material and other ingredients used for the preparation of the dish. Hence, the freezing treatment should be such that there should be formation of small ice crystals, sufficient only to puncture the cells of the food material and other ingredients of the dish such that it allows the formation of open porous structure on the surface and inside the food material and other ingredients, thereby causing rapid and full rehydration of the dish .Open porous structure is because of combination of both freezing and dehydration. Further, the dish obtain thereof will retain the original characteristics of the food material and other ingredients.<br>
Dehydration of the frozen dish reduces the moisture content thereby inhibiting the microbial growth, enzyme activity and extending the shelf life of the dish. Dehydration also causes reduction in weight of the food that reduces the transport cost and provides greater variety and convenience for the consumer.<br>
The process of dehydration is carried out by blowing hot air over the frozen dish. When hot air is blown over the frozen dish, heat is transferred to the surface, and causes water to evaporate. Water vapour diffuses through a boundary film of air and is carried away by the moving air, this creates a region of lower water vapour pressure at the surface of dish and the water vapour pressure gradient is established from the moist interior of the dish to the dry air. This gradient provides the "driving force" for water removal from the dish.<br>
Dehydration of the dish can be carried out by but not limited to tray dryer also called as cabinet dryer, fluidized bed dryer and freeze-dryer.<br><br><br>
For the purpose of the present invention, it is desirable to prepare and cook the food at a pressure ranging from about 2psi to 15psi for 10min. to 45min. preferably at 2psi to 6psi for 10min. to 25min. However, specific pressure and time required for cooking the dish may depend upon the nature of the particular food, its texture, moisture content and other conditions.<br>
After preparing and cooking the dish it is desirable to freeze the dish at temperature ranging from about -50°C to 0°C for 15min. to 48hrs preferably at -50°C to -10°C for 15min. to 20hrs. However, the time and temperature for freezing the dish may depend upon the type, nature, moisture content and other conditions of the dish.<br>
Further, it is preferred to dehydrate the frozen dish at temperature ranging from about 30°C to 200°C for 10min. to 6hrs. desirably at 60°C to 120°C for 15min. to 3hrs. such that the moisture content of the dish is less than 7%. However, the specific time and temperature required for dehydrating the dish may vary depending upon the moisture content, nature and other conditions of the dish.<br>
Rehydration of the dish results in regaining the volume and texture of the dish. Further it also enhances the aroma, taste, color and flavor of the dish like freshly prepared dish.<br>
The present invention provides a method for rehydration of the convenience dish, wherein the convenience dish is rehydrated with the liquid within 3min. or in microwave within 45 sec. and the ratio of weight of the convenience dish to liquid is 1:2 to 1:9. However, the time taken for rehydration of the dish and ratio of weight of the convenience dish to liquid also depends upon the type of the dish to rehydrate and the liquid used for rehydration for e.g. the time taken to rehydrate the rice dish, pulse dish, vegetable dish is 10sec. to 3min., and the ratio of weight of the rice dish, pulse dish and vegetable dish to water that is used as a liquid is 1:3, 1:5 and 1:2 respectively.<br>
The liquid that can be used for rehydration of the dish includes water, juices, beverages, milk and milk products, stew, broth, extracts, concentrates and combinations thereof. The liquid to be used for rehydration depends upon the taste and type of the dish. In<br><br><br>
case of hot dish like rice dish, vegetables dish etc. It is desirable to carry out rehydration with hot liquid, as this kind of dish generally taste good if consumed hot. Whereas, on the other side in case of cold dish like kheer, sheer- khurma, custard etc. it is generally preferable to rehydrate the dish with cold liquid as the dish taste good when consumed cold. However, it also depends upon the requirement, choice and the way in which the consumer wants to serve or consume the dish.<br>
The present invention provides a method of preparing convenience cereal dish especially rice dish having the steps of preparing and cooking the rice dish by using a recipe under pressure at 4psi to 5psi for 15min. to 25min., freezing the rice dish at -30°C to -15°C for 15min. to 20hrs., and dehydrating the rice dish at 90°C to 120°C for 30min. to 1hr. to a moisture content of less than 7%.<br>
It is desirable to wash and soak the cereals in liquids preferably water before cooking in order to get the desired characteristic and texture of the dish. As washing the cereals removes the dirt, dust, mud &amp; any other unwanted matter and constituent. The process of soaking fastens the cooking process by getting the moisture in the centre of the cereals resulting in quicker heat transfer in the centre during cooking and thereby reducing the cooking time. Further, the process of soaking improves the final texture of the cooked product.<br>
The rice dish that can be prepared from the method as described includes but does not limit to khichidi, pulao, curd rice, lemon rice, sambhar rice, rasam rice, tomato rice, fried rice, biryani, tamarind rice, crab rice, meat rice, chicken rice.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of preparation of the convenience pulse dish having the steps of preparing and cooking the pulse dish by using a recipe under pressure at 2psi to 5psi for 10min. to 25min., freezing the pulse dish at ~40°C to -10°C for 15 min. to 10hrs. followed by dehydrating the frozen pulse dish at 45°C to 120°C for 15 min. to 3hrs. to a moisture content of less than 7%.<br><br><br>
It is preferable to soak the pulse in liquids preferably water before preparing and cooking in order to get the desired characteristic and texture of the dish. As washing the pulse removes the dirt, dust, mud &amp; any other unwanted matter and constituent.
