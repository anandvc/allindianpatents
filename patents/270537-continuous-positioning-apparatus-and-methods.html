Background of the Invention<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
       This invention relates generally to methods and apparatus for monitoring parameters<br>
associated with fluid systems, and specifically in one aspect to the non-invasive monitoring<br>
of arterial blood pressure in a living subject.<br>
2.	Description of Related Technology<br>
       The accurate, continuous, non-invasive measurement of blood pressure has long been<br>
sought by medical science. The availability of such measurement techniques would allow the<br>
caregiver to continuously monitor a subject's blood pressure accurately and in repeatable<br>
fashion without the use of invasive arterial catheters (commonly known as "A-lines") in any<br>
number of settings including, for example, surgical operating rooms where continuous,<br>
accurate indications of true blood pressure are often essential.<br>
       Several well known techniques have heretofore been used to non-invasively monitor<br>
a subject's arterial blood pressure waveform, namely, auscultation, oscillometry, and<br>
tonometry. Both the auscultation and oscillometry techniques use a standard inflatable arm<br>
cuff that occludes the subject's peripheral (predominately brachial) artery. The auscultatory<br>
technique determines the subject's systolic and diastolic pressures by monitoring certain<br>
Korotkoff sounds that occur as the :uff is slowly deflated. The oscillometric technique, on<br><br>
the other hand, determines these pressures, as well as the subject's mean pressure, by<br>
measuring actual pressure changes that occur in the cuff as the cuff is deflated. Both<br>
techniques determine pressure values only intermittently, because of the need to alternately<br>
inflate and deflate the cuff, and they cannot replicate the subject's actual blood pressure<br>
waveform. Thus, continuous, beat-to-beat blood pressure monitoring cannot be achieved<br>
using these techniques.<br>
       Occlusive cuff instruments of the kind described briefly above have generally been<br>
somewhat effective in sensing long-term trends in a subject's blood pressure. However, such<br>
instruments generally have been ineffective in sensing short-term blood pressure variations,<br>
which are of critical importance in many medical applications, including surgery.<br>
       The technique of arterial tonometry is also well known in the medical arts. According<br>
to the theory of arterial tonometry, the pressure in a superficial artery with sufficient bony<br>
support, such as the radial artery may be accurately recorded during an applanation sweep<br>
when the transmural pressure equals zero. The term "applanation" refers to the process of<br>
varying the pressure applied to the artery. An applanation sweep refers to a time period<br>
during which pressure over the artery is varied from over-compression to under-compression<br>
or vice versa. At the onset of a decreasing applanation sweep, the artery is over-compressed<br>
into a "dog bone" shape, so that pressure pulses are not recorded. At the end of the sweep,<br>
the artery is under-compressed, so that minimum amplitude pressure pulses are recorded.<br>
Within the sweep, it is assumed that an applanation occurs during which the arterial wall<br>
tension is parallel to the tonometer surface. Here, the arterial pressure is perpendicular to the<br>
surface and is the only stress detected by the tonometer sensor. At this pressure, it is<br>
assumed that the maximum peak-to-peak amplitude (the "maximum pulsatile") pressure<br>
obtained corresponds to zero transmural pressure. Note that other measures analogous to<br>
maximum pulsatile pressure, including maximum rate of change in pressure (i.e., maximum<br>
dP/dT) can also be implemented.<br>
       One prior art device for implementing the tonometry technique includes a rigid array<br>
of miniature pressure transducers that is applied against the tissue overlying a peripheral<br>
artery, e.g., the radial artery. The transducers each directly sense the mechanical forces in the<br>
underlying subject tissue, and each is sized to cover only a fraction of the underlying artery.<br>
The array is urged against the tissue to applanate the underlying artery and thereby cause<br>
beat-to-beat pressure variations within the artery to be coupled through the tissue to at least<br>
some of the transducers. An array of different transducers is used to ensure that at least one<br>
transducer is always over the artery, regardless of array position on the subject This type of<br>
tonometer, however, is subject to several drawbacks. First, the array of discrete transducers<br><br>
generally is not anatomically compatible with the continuous contours of the subject's tissue<br>
overlying the artery being sensed. This can result in inaccuracies in the resulting transducer<br>
signals. In addition, in some cases, this incompatibility can cause tissue injury and nerve<br>
damage and can restrict blood flow to distal tissue.<br>
       Other prior art techniques have sought to more accurately place a single tonometric<br>
sensor laterally above the artery, thereby more completely coupling the sensor to the<br>
pressure variations within the artery. However, such systems may place the sensor at a<br>
location where it is geometrically "centered" but not optimally positioned for signal<br>
coupling, and further typically require comparatively frequent re-calibration or repositioning<br>
due to movement of the subject during measurement.<br>
       Tonometry systems are also commonly quite sensitive to the orientation of the<br>
pressure transducer on the subject being monitored. Specifically, such systems show<br>
degradation in accuracy when the angular relationship between the transducer and the artery<br>
is varied from an "optimal" incidence angle. This is an important consideration, since no<br>
two measurements are likely to have the device placed or maintained at precisely the same<br>
angle with respect to the artery. Many of the foregoing approaches similarly suffer from not<br>
being able to maintain a constant angular relationship with the artery regardless of lateral<br>
position, due in many cases to positioning mechanisms which are not adapted to account for<br>
the anatomic features of the subject, such as curvature of the wrist surface.<br>
       Furthermore, compliance in various apparatus components (e.g., the strap and<br>
actuator assembly) and the lack of soft padding surrounding the sensor which minimizes<br>
edge effects may adversely impact the accuracy of tonometric systems to a significant extent.<br>
       One very significant limitation of prior art tonometry approaches relates to the<br>
magnitude and location of the applied applanation pressure during varying conditions of<br>
patient motion, position, mean pressure changes, respiration, etc. Specifically, even when the<br>
optimum level of arterial compression at the optimal coupling location is initially achieved,<br>
there is commonly real-world or clinical factors beyond reasonable control that can introduce<br>
significant error into the measurement process, especially over extended periods of time. For<br>
example, the subject being monitored may voluntarily or involuntarily move, thereby<br>
altering (for at least a period of time) the physical relationship between the tonometric sensor<br>
and die subject's tissue/blood vessel. Similarly, bumping or jarring of the subject or the<br>
tonometric measurement apparatus can easily occur, thereby again altering the physical<br>
relationship between the sensor and subject. The simple effect of gravity can, under certain<br>
circumstances, cause the relative positions of the sensor and subject blood vessel to alter<br>
with time as well.<br><br>
       Furthermore, physiologic responses of the subject (including, for example, relaxation<br>
of the walls of the blood vessel clue to anesthesia or pharmacological agents) can produce the<br>
need for changes in the applanation level (and sometimes even the lateral/proximal position<br>
of the sensor) in order to maintain optimal sensor coupling. Additionally, due to the<br>
compliance of surrounding tissue and possibly measurement system, the applanation level<br>
often needs to adjust with changes in mean arterial pressure.<br>
       Several approaches have heretofore been disclosed in attempts to address the<br>
foregoing limitations. In one prior art approach, an occlusive cuff is used to provide a basis<br>
for periodic calibration; if the measured pressure changes a "significant" amount or a<br>
determined time has elapsed, then the system performs a cuff calibration to assist in resetting<br>
the applanation position. Reliable pressure data is not displayed or otherwise available<br>
during these calibration periods. See for example U.S. Patent 5,261,414 to Aung, et al issued<br>
November 16, 1993 and entitled "Blood-Pressure Monitor Apparatus," assigned to Colin<br>
Corporation (hereinafter "Aung"). See also U.S. Patent 6,322,516 issued November 27,2001<br>
and entitled "Blood-Pressure Monitor Apparatus," also assigned to Colin Corporation,<br>
wherein an occlusive cuff is used as the basis for calibration of a plurality of light sensors.<br>
       In another prior art approach, a pressure cuff or a pelotte equipped with a<br>
plethysmographic gauge, such as an impedance or a photo-electric device, is used to drive a<br>
servo control loop. See, e.g., U.S. Patent 4,869,261 to Penaz issued September 26, 1989 and<br>
entitled "Automatic noninvasive blood pressure monitor," assigned to University J.E. Purkyne<br>
v Brne (hereinafter "Penaz"). In this device, the sensor is connected through at least one<br>
amplifier and a phase corrector to an electro-pressure transducer. All these components<br>
constitute the closed loop of a servo control system which (at least ostensibly) continuously<br>
changes the pressure in the cuff and attempts to maintain the volume of the artery at a value<br>
corresponding to zero tension across the arterial wall. The servo control system loop further<br>
includes a pressure vibration generator, the frequency of vibration being higher than that of the<br>
highest harmonic component of blood pressure wave. A correction circuit is also provided, the<br>
input of which is connected to the plethysmographic sensor and output of which is provided to<br>
correct the setpoint of the servo control system. The Penaz system therefore in effect constantly<br>
"servos" (within a cardiac cycle) to a fixed light signal level received from the sensor. Unlike<br>
the Colin systems described above, the system continuously displays pressure to the operator.<br>
However, the operation of the plethysmographic sensor of Penaz limited the application of this<br>
device to a peripheral section of a limb (preferably a finger) where the peripheral pressure,<br>
especially under conditions of compromised peripheral circulation, may not accurately reflect<br>
aortic or brachial artery pressure. This presents a potentially significant cause of error.<br><br>
       Yet another prior art approach uses a series of varying pressure "sweeps" performed<br>
successively to attempt to identify the actual intra-arterial blood pressure. The applanation<br>
pressure applied during each of these sweeps is generally varied from a level of arterial<br>
under-compression to over-compression (or vice-versa), and the system analyzes the data<br>
obtained during each sweep to identify, e.g., the largest pressure waveform amplitude. See,<br>
e.g., U.S. Patent 5,797,850 to Archibald, et al issued August 25, 1998 and entitled "Method<br>
and apparatus for calculating blood pressure of an artery," assigned to Medwave, Inc.<br>
(hereinafter "Archibald"). The system of Archibald is not truly continuous, however, since<br>
the sweeps each require a finite; period of time to complete and analyze. In practice the<br>
sweeps are repeated with minimal delay, one after another, throughout the operation of the<br>
device. During applanation mechanism resetting and subsequent sweep operations, the<br>
system is effectively "dead" to new data as it analyzes and displays the data obtained during<br>
a previous sweep period. This is clearly disadvantageous from the standpoint that significant<br>
portions of data are effectively lost, and the operator receives what amounts to only periodic<br>
indications of the subject's blood pressure (i.e., one new pressure beat display every 15-40<br>
seconds).<br>
       Lastly, the techniques for non-invasive pressure measurement disclosed by the<br>
Assignee of the present invention in U.S. Patent No's. 6,228,034, 6,176,831, 5,964,711, and<br>
5,848,970, each entitled "Apparatus and method for non-invasively monitoring a subject's<br>
arterial blood pressure" and incorporated herein by reference in their entirety, include<br>
modulation of applanation level at, inter alia, frequencies higher than the heart rate (e.g.,<br>
sinusoidal perturbation at 25 H2). Further, Assignee has determined over time that it is<br>
desirable in certain circumstances to control the applanation level according to other<br>
modulation schemes and/or frequencies, and/or which are not regular or deterministic in<br>
nature, such as those disclosed by co-owned U.S. Patent No. 6,974,419, entitled "Method<br>
and apparatus for control of non-invasive parameter measurements" and incorporated herein<br>
by reference in its entirety. Each of the foregoing methods, however, distinguishes between<br>
two modes of operation, the first being (1) calibration; and the second being known as (2)<br>
patient monitoring mode ("PMM").<br>
"Simulated Annealing "<br>
       Simulated annealing (SA) is a term that relates to optimization schema that are<br>
related to or modeled generally after physical processes. For example, one branch of<br>
simulated annealing theory is a generalization of a Monte Carlo method for examining the<br>
equations of state and frozen states of n-body systems. The concept is based to some degree<br><br>
on the manner in which liquids freeze or metals recrystalize during the physical process of<br>
annealing. In an annealing process, material initially at high temperature and disordered, is<br>
cooled so as to approximately maintain thermodynamic equilibrium. As cooling proceeds,<br>
the system becomes more ordered and approaches a "frozen" ground state at Temperature<br>
(T)=0. Accordingly, SA can be thought of as analogous to an adiabatic approach to the<br>
lowest energy state. If the staning temperature of the system is too low, or the cooling<br>
regimen is insufficiently slow, the system may form defects or freeze in meta-stable states;<br>
i.e., become trapped in a local minimum energy state.<br>
       One scheme (Metropolis) selects an initial state of a thermodynamic system (energy<br>
E and temperature T), and holding T constant, the initial configuration is perturbed, and the<br>
change in energy (dE) determined. If the change in energy is negative, the new configuration<br>
is accepted. If the change in energy is positive, it is accepted with a probability determined<br>
by the Boltzmann factor exp-(dE/T). This processes is then repeated sufficient times to give<br>
adequate sampling statistics for the current temperature. The temperature is then<br>
decremented, and the entire process repeated until a "frozen" state is achieved (at T=0).<br>
       This Monte Carlo approach can be analogized to combinatorial problems. The<br>
current state of the thermodynamic system is analogous to the current solution to the<br>
problem. The energy equation for the thermodynamic system is analogous to the objective<br>
function. The ground state is analogous to the global minimum.<br>
       A significant difficulty in implementing this algorithm, however, is that there is often<br>
no obvious analogy for the temperature (T) with respect to a parameter in the combinatorial<br>
problem. Furthermore, avoidance of entrainment in local minima (quenching) is dependent<br>
on an "annealing schedule", the choice of initial temperature, the number of iterations<br>
performed at each temperature, and how much the temperature is decremented at each step<br>
as cooling proceeds.<br>
       Based on the foregoing, there is needed an improved apparatus and methodology for<br>
accurately and continuously controlling the non-invasive measurement of parameters such as<br>
pressure. Such improved methodology and apparatus would ideally integrate the highly<br>
efficient simulated annealing (SA) approach and allow for, inter alia, continuous measurement<br>
(tonometrically or otherwise) of one or more physiologic or hemodynamic parameters, the<br>
measured values of such parameters being reflective of true (e.g., intra-arterial) parameters,<br>
while also providing robustness and repeatability under varying environmental conditions<br>
including motion artifact and other noise. In addition, such method and apparatus would operate<br>
under a substantially unified scheme, as opposed to the two or more independent schemes<br>
modeled in prior art devices.<br><br>
       Such a method and apparatus would also be easily utilized by trained medical personnel<br>
and untrained individuals, thereby allowing subjects to accurately and reliably conduct self-<br>
monitoring if desired.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
       Reference is now made to the drawings wherein like numerals refer to like parts<br>
throughout.<br><br>
       It is noted that while the invention is described herein primarily in terms of a<br>
apparatus and methods for the control of non-invasive measurements of hemodynamic<br>
parameters such as blood pressure obtained via the radial artery (i.e., wrist) of a human<br>
subject, the invention may also be readily embodied or adapted to monitor such parameters<br>
at other blood vessels and locations on the human body, as well as monitoring these<br>
parameters on other warm-blooded species. Similarly, the techniques of the present<br>
invention can be applied to other parameters, as well as other similar fluidic systems which<br>
have similar properties to those of the circulatory system of a living being. All such<br>
adaptations and alternate embodiments are readily implemented by those of ordinary skill in<br>
the relevant arts, and are considered to fall within the scope of the claims appended hereto.<br>
       As used herein, the term "continuous" is meant to include without limitation<br>
continuous, piece-wise continuous, and/or substantially continuous processes (e.g., those<br>
which are generally continuous in nature, but are not perse continuous).<br>
       As used herein, the term "hemodynamic parameter" is meant to include parameters<br>
associated with the circulatory system of the subject, including for example pressure (e.g.,<br>
diastolic, systolic, pulse, or mean pressure), derivatives or combinations thereof, arterial<br>
flow, arterial wall diameter (and its derivatives), cross sectional area of the artery, and<br>
arterial compliance.<br>
       Additionally, it is noted that the terms "tonometric," "tonometer," and "tonometry"<br>
as used herein are intended to broadly refer to non-invasive surface measurement of one or<br>
more hemodynamic parameters, such as by placing a sensor in communication with the<br>
surface of the skin, although contact with the skin need not be direct, and can be indirect<br>
(e.g., such as through a coupling medium or other interface).<br>
       The terms "applanate" and "applanation" as used herein refer to, without limitation,<br>
the compression (relative to a state of non-compression) of tissue, blood vessel(s), and other<br>
structures such as tendon or muscle of the subject's physiology. Similarly, an applanation<br>
"sweep" refers to one or more periods of time during which the applanation level is varied<br>
(either increasingly, decreasingly, or any combination thereof). Although generally used in<br>
the context of linear (constant velocity) position variations, the term "applanation" as used<br>
herein may conceivably take on any variety of other forms, including without limitation (i) a<br>
continuous non-linear (e.g., logarithmic) increasing or decreasing compression over time; (ii)<br>
a non-continuous or piece-wise continuous linear or non-linear compression; (iii) alternating<br>
compression and relaxation; (iv) sinusoidal or triangular waves functions; (v) random motion<br>
(such as a "random walk"; or (vi) a deterministic profile. All such forms are considered to<br>
be encompassed by these terms.<br><br>
       As used herein, the terns "epoch" refers to any increment of time, ranging in duration<br>
from the smallest measurable fraction of a second to more than one second.<br>
       As used herein, the terms "spatial" and "position", although described in terms of a<br>
substantially Cartesian coordinate system having applanation (i.e., Z-axis), lateral (X-axis)<br>
and (Proximal refers to closer to the heart) longitudinal or (proximal—distal) (Y-axis)<br>
components, shall refer to any spatial coordinate system including, without limitation,<br>
cylindrical, spherical, and polar. Such use of alternate coordinate systems may clearly be<br>
independent of any particular hardware configuration or geometry (e.g., by performing<br>
simple mathematical translations between a Cartesian-based apparatus and the non-Cartesian<br>
coordinate system), or alternatively make advantageous use of such geometries. The present<br>
invention is therefore in no way limited to certain coordinate systems of apparatus<br>
configurations. As one example, it will be recognized that the methods and apparatus of the<br>
present invention may be embodied using a cylindrical coordinate system modeled around<br>
the radial artery, such that a particular point in space for the tonometric sensor(s) can be<br>
specified by the Z, r, and 6 parameters. This approach may have advantages since the<br>
forearm/wrist area of the human being very roughly comprises a cylindrical form.<br>
       As used herein, the term "temperature" refers to, without limitation, any parameter<br>
which can be correlated or analogized to temperature in an actual or physical annealing process<br>
including, for example, confidence level. Temperature as used in the context of the SA models<br>
disclosed herein is merely an aostract concept representative of a quantity or property<br>
associated with the system being controlled or modeled.<br>
       As used herein, the term "application" (in the context of a software application)<br>
refers generally to a unit of executable software that implements a certain functionality or<br>

Overview<br>
       In one fundamental aspect, the present invention comprises apparatus and methods<br>
for controlling an applanation or other positioning mechanism used in physiologic analysis<br>
such as, e.g., non-invasive hemodynamic parameter measurements in order to, inter alia,<br>
maintain optimal coupling between a parameter sensor and the blood vessel of interest.<br>
These improved apparatus and methods are based on simulated annealing (SA) paradigms<br>
that provide a substantially unified and highly effective means for placing and maintaining<br>
the hemodynamic assessment or other such system in an optimized operational state.<br>
Maintenance of this state correlates, inter alia, to the best possible accuracy for the<br>
parameters) (e.g., blood pressure) being measured.<br>
       Exemplary techniques for determining the optimal applanation level, position, and<br>
coupling that can be utilized with or benefit from the present invention are described in<br>
detail in, e.g., co-owned U.S. Patent No. 6,730,038 entitled "Method And Apparatus For<br>
Non-Invasively Measuring Hemodynamic Parameters Using Parametrics" issued May 4,<br>
2004 and co-owned U.S. Patent No. 5,974,419 entitled "Method and Apparatus for Control<br><br>
of Non-Invasive Parameter Measurements" issued December 13, 2005 each of which are<br>
incorporated by reference herein in their entirety.<br>
       The improved techniques and apparatus of the present invention advantageously may<br>
be used with a broad range of hardware configurations, including e.g., a single sensor (or<br>
array of sensors) as described in detail herein and the aforementioned and incorporated co-<br>
pending application, or in conjunction with literally any type of other apparatus adapted for<br>
hemodynamic parameter measurement, including for example the devices described in co-<br>
pending U.S. patent application Ser. Nos. 09/815,982 entitled "Method and Apparatus for the<br>
Noninvasive Assessment of Hemodynamic Parameters Including Blood Vessel Location"<br>
filed Mar. 22, 2001, and 09/815,080 entitled "Method and Apparatus for Assessing<br>
Hemodynamic Parameters within the Circulatory System of a Living Subject" also filed Mar.<br>
22, 2001, both of which are assigned to the assignee hereof and incorporated herein by<br>
reference in their entirety. For example, an entirely tonometric pressure-based approach can<br>
be used. Alternatively, ultrasound measurements of blood pressure via blood flow kinetic<br>
energy or velocity can be used as a confirmatory technique for the tonometric pressure-based<br>
approach. As another example, lateral positioning based on analysis of the acoustic signals<br>
relating to vessel wall detection may be used in addition to (or in place of) the pressure-<br>
based techniques described in the cited co-owned patents and patent applications.<br>
       Hence, the various aspects of the present invention are advantageously compatible<br>
with a number of different physiologic and hemodynamic assessment techniques. It will also<br>
be recognized that the techniques and apparatus described herein are in no way limited to<br>
tonometric applications; rather, these features may be implemented even in e.g., occlusive<br>
cuff or pellot-based systems.<br>
       While the techniques described in the aforementioned co-pending patent and patent<br>
applications have been determined by Assignee to be highly effective, their robustness and<br>
utility in practical (e.g., clinical) settings is enhanced through the addition of one or more of<br>
the various aspects of the present invention. In the context of blood pressure measurement,<br>
existing approaches to acquire and measure the patient's mean arterial blood pressure<br>
focused on the compression of the patient's tissues at a location directly over their artery of<br>
interest (e.g., the radial artery) such that the observed pulse pressure was maximized. It is at<br>
this point of maximum pulse pressure that the pressure exerted on the compressed artery<br>
equals the mean arterial pressure. Observance of the mean arterial pressure in an accurate<br>
way was largely predicated on locating the artery correctly, and compressing the artery at an<br>
appropriate level of applanation.<br><br>
       Under some such approaches, location of the artery was accomplished using two<br>
discrete steps or phases. First during an initial calibration phase, a scan of a narrow portion<br>
of an acquisition space is performed by making broad movements along both the lateral and<br>
applanation axes. Second, during the second phase of operation, the applanation location is<br>
fine tuned using a series of small experimental dithers around the current operating point<br>
located during the calibration phase. In this way, the two phases of artery location and<br>
applanation can be viewed as a "large signal experiment" followed by a "small signal<br>
experiment".<br>
       While there normally is no sense that a large signal experiment is better or worse<br>
than a small signal experiment, there are some issues introduced to the system under<br>
measurement by implementing such an approach. First, the observed pulse pressure may not<br>
only be a function of the actual position of the transducer with respect to the artery, but it<br>
quite probably is also a function of the history of stresses placed upon the involved tissues<br>
by the actuator. It would therefore be reasonable to expect that this historical effect may be<br>
amplified with larger disturbances of the system seen during initial calibration.<br>
       Second, using two separate modes of operation assumes that the system (i.e. the<br>
transducer, actuator and patient's tissues) will respond similarly during both large signal and<br>
small signal experiments, in effect assuming the system behaves in a linear fashion.<br>
However, the operating point located during the initial calibration phase and the operating<br>
point located during the second phase may be two different "answers" that are only<br>
appropriate to their own respective phases of operation. In systems where only small<br>
adjustments are made to the applanation position and the lateral position subsequent to<br>
calibration, such a two phase solution can be problematic as the operating point located<br>
during calibration may not be the ideal operating point location for the second phase and the<br>
control system can have a tendency to get stuck at a local, as opposed to global, maxima.<br>
       Therefore in accordance with one embodiment of the invention, a method and<br>
apparatus are provided for monitoring hemodynamic parameters, such as blood pressure, in a<br>
continuous and non-invasive manner while operating under a single unifying scheme. In a<br>
sense, this approach acknowledges the fact that we are constantly calibrating, always<br>
questioning whether or not we are at the patient's optimal operating point to measure the<br>
hemodynamic parameter of interest. One. embodiment of the invention includes a<br>
measurement apparatus for measuring various hemodynamic parameters associated with the<br>
human body. In addition, a digital processor is disclosed for calculating various parameters<br>
in response to the measured parameters. Additionally, the invention includes a method and<br><br>
apparatus for controlling the location of the measurement in response to information<br>
generated by the digital processor.<br>
       In accordance with a described embodiment of the hemodynamic system monitoring<br>
apparatus, the hemodynamic system apparatus implements a "simulated annealing" process<br>
which unifies measurements under a single scheme of operation. In one exemplary<br>
embodiment of the simulated annealing process, dithers of varying sizes will be dynamically<br>
applied to the system around a given operating point. The size of these dithers will be<br>
correlated to a confidence analysis (e.g. so-called temperature measurement), such that larger<br>
changes to dither will be applied when confidence is low while smaller more subtle changes<br>
will' be used when confidence is high. This simulated annealing process will be more<br>
resilient against being trapped by so-called local maxima over prior art techniques, as well as<br>
being more resilient against varying topologies of hemodynamic parameter curves. This<br>
approach also opens up the solution space to the maximum amount allowed by the physical<br>
actuator implemented (i.e. by allowing for adjustment in the applanation, lateral and distal<br>
axes either serially or in parallel) and by further allowing for dynamic adjustment of the<br>
position of the transducer over the 'radial artery further improving the reliability and<br>
robustness of these classes of ion-invasive hemodynamic parameter monitors. Further,<br>
because the unifying scheme is largely a "small signal" approach, although not necessarily<br>
so due to factors such as this aforementioned optimal positioning confidence level,<br>
disruptions to the system causing inaccurate non-invasive readings are effectively<br>
minimized.<br>
Continuous Positioning Methodology<br>
       It will also be recognized mat while the process of the present invention is described<br>
subsequently herein with respect to a tonometric pressure sensor or transducer, it can be<br>
applied more generally to other signal domains including without limitation ultrasonics and<br>
electromagnetic radiation (e.g., IR, X-ray, etc.).<br>
       Furthermore, it will be appreciated that while primarily described in the context of<br>
the aforementioned tonometric apparatus (i.e., a tonometric pressure sensor which also acts<br>
to provide varying levels of compression of the underlying tissue and blood vessel(s)), the<br>
methodology of the present invention may be practiced using apparatus having separate<br>
components which provide these functions. For example, the control of the pressure sensor<br>
may be partly or completely decoupled from the applanation control system, such that the<br>
level of applanation can be varied independently from the coupling of the active surface(s) of<br>
the sensor. A detailed discussion of exemplary electronic and signal processing apparatus<br><br>
used to support the operation of the processes described herein is provided with respect to<br>
Fig. 6 below.<br>
       It will be recognized by those of ordinary skill that the logical processes of the<br>
present invention may also be practiced entirely algorithmically (e.g., in software) and/or<br>
firmware.<br>
       Fig. 1 is a flow chart illustrating the general control methodology performed to<br>
determine, e.g., the hemodynamic parameters) (blood pressure, etc.) of a living subject in<br>
accordance with one embodiment of the present invention. The overall process can be<br>
thought of as constituting four (4) basic methodological steps. The first step 102 comprises<br>
the step of entry into the "simulated annealing" process and the pre-requisite calculations for<br>
the steps that follow. This first step 102 is described further in detail with regards to Fig. 2<br>
and its accompanying disclosure<br>
       It will be appreciated that the term "simulated annealing" as used herein is merely<br>
used as an analogy for sake of easier understanding of the concepts of the invention, and in<br>
no way carries any specific connotation or meaning.<br>
       In step 104, the variation (e.g., dither) generation process is initiated. The set of<br>
dither factors typically includes an applanation dither factor, a lateral dither factor and a<br>
distal dither factor, corresponding to the applanation, lateral and distal axes respectively for<br>
the measuring apparatus. The dither generation process is discussed further herein with<br>
regards to Fig. 3 and its accompanying disclosure. Alternative embodiments of the invention<br>
described herein may include more or less dither factors and/or axes of interest and<br>
implementation would be readily apparent to one of ordinary skill given the present<br>
disclosure herein.<br>
       Step 106 corresponds to the pressure signal processing methodology utilized with<br>
regards to the present embodiment of the invention. This methodology is described in<br>
further detail with and in part with regards to Fig. 4 and its accompanying disclosure.<br>
       In step 108, the system behavior is adjusted based on the aforementioned dither<br>
generation and hemodynamic parameter processing steps. Generally speaking, as the<br>
confidence level of being located at the optimal point decreases the dither factors utilized are<br>
increased in order to allow for "larger" searches of the optimal positioning point, this<br>
optimal point being the ideal location from which to obtain hemodynamic parameter<br>
readings. Conversely, as the confidence level increases, the dither factor is decreased in<br>
order to allow only "smaller" searches for the optimal point in order to obtain hemodynamic<br>
parameter readings, while simultaneously minimizing adverse influences on the system as a<br><br>
result of the non-invasive measurement This adaptive behavior is discussed further with<br>
regards to Fig. 5 and its accompanying disclosure.<br>
       At this point, the process 100 may end or alternatively the process may continue by<br>
performing a new measurement at 102 and repeating one or more of the aforementioned<br>
processes. For purposes of simplicity and brevity, processes 102, 104, 106 and 108 will be<br>
primarily discussed with regard's to only two axes of interest (i.e., applanation and lateral),<br>
although it is recognized that more or less axes processing steps could be implemented<br>
consistent with the principles of the present invention.<br>
(I) Simulated Annealing Entry<br>
       Referring now to Fig. 2, une exemplary embodiment of the simulated annealing entry<br>
process 102 is shown. While the exemplary simulated annealing process is described in<br>
conjunction with the use of tonometric blood pressure monitoring system, such as for<br>
example the TL-150 developed and marketed by Tensys® Medical, Inc., the invention is in<br>
no way so limited. In fact, the process discussed with regards to Fig. 2 may be utilized<br>
within the framework of a plurality of different apparatus measuring other physiologic or<br>
hemodynamic parameters, the aforementioned TL-150 merely being exemplary.<br>
       In step 202, a pressure transducer is applanated along the applanation axis at a<br>
desired location; e.g., a palpation mark determined by a user, or location determined via<br>
vessel location mechanism or technique such as ultrasound or the like. In a first<br>
embodiment, the palpation mark is determined manually by first, palpating the radial styloid<br>
process and then drawing a transverse line over this bone. Next, the location of the patient's<br>
pulse is determined and the user will draw a line perpendicular to and intersecting the<br>
transverse line previously drawn. The intersection of this line will be referred to herein as<br>
the palpation mark. While discussed in terms of locating along the radial styloid process on<br>
a patient's wrist, the palpation technique described herein could be equally applicable to<br>
other areas of the human body, such as e.g. the ulnar pulse point, carotid pulse point, or<br>
brachial pulse point, etc. The measuring apparatus is then placed over the palpation mark and<br>
the pressure transducer will applanate the patient's tissue at the palpation mark to a specified<br>
applanation pressure (such as e.g. 85 mm-Hg).<br>
       In step 204, it is determined whether the apparatus can detect pulse beats originating<br>
from the pulse point (e.g., the radial pulse point palpation mark). If a pulse is detected, then<br>
the apparatus will take an average of the pulse pressures observed over a specified number of<br>
beats (e.g. four (4)), or employ another scheme for obtaining a desired data set at step 206,<br>
and the process will then invoke the simulated annealing process with average pulse pressure<br><br>
measurements at step 208. If the pulse is not detected, then a "hybrid" lateral process step is<br>
invoiced at step 205.<br>
       Assuming that a pulse beat has not been detected, the hybrid lateral processing step is<br>
invoked at step 205. Here, the apparatus will begin looking for beats by performing a lateral<br>
scan beginning at a point that is a specified distance from the beginning of possible lateral<br>
travel. It has been found through experiment that the specified distance of travel from the<br>
beginning of possible lateral travel is often most effective at approximately 1/4 of an inch<br>
(0.25 in.), although more or less travel clearly may be utilized.<br>
       Next, the apparatus will 'servo" (i.e., continuously or semi-continuously vary) the<br>
applanation position in order to maintain an average pressure at a specified position such as<br>
e.g. 60 mm-Hg. During the lateral scan, any beats collected by the apparatus are noted along<br>
with the position and pressure reading of the sensor at the time of detection.<br>
       At this point in the hybrid lateral process, the apparatus determines whether it has<br>
collected a predetermined number of beats (e.g. four (4) in the illustrated embodiment), or<br>
has reached the end of lateral travel without detecting the required number of beats. If the<br>
end of the specified lateral travel has been reached without detecting the specified number of<br>
beats, step 205 is repeated; however this time a lower lateral scan velocity is used, and/or the<br>
possible lateral travel area is increased.<br>
       On the other hand, if the predetermined number of beats had been collected, the<br>
transducer will be positioned over the lateral position as indicated by the largest reading of<br>
the collected beats. At the point, the apparatus will servo the applanation position of the<br>
transducer until an average desired pressure (e.g., 85 mm-Hg) is reached, and collect another<br>
predetermined number of beats in step 207.<br>
       In step 207, if it is determined the hybrid lateral process of step 205 was entered into<br>
as a result of a motion recovery process; then the number of beats collected will be specified<br>
at a number such as e.g. twenty (20) collected beats. If not a result of a motion recovery<br>
process, a fewer number of collected beats is needed, such as e.g. four (4) beats. The<br>
apparatus will then either query whether the required number of beats have been collected in<br>
a specified time limit, and if the apparatus returns "true" to this inquiry, the apparatus will<br>
average the pulse pressure measurements collected over the collected number of beats and<br>
invoke step 208, the simulated annealing process.<br>
       If the apparatus times out prior to collecting the specified number of beats, then the<br>
hybrid lateral process will repeat, but with a lower scan velocity. If this repeated hybrid<br>
lateral process is repeated over a predetermined number of times (e.g. two (2)), then the user<br><br>
will be notified of the processing error, and the process will be terminated or a diagnostic or<br>
troubleshooting mode entered if desired.<br>
       In step 208, the simulated annealing process is invoiced tointer alia prepare for entry<br>
into subsequent dither generation processing steps, as described further below with regards<br>
to Fig. 3 and its accompanying disclosure. A starting temperature value is selected in step<br>
208 using the chart of Pig. 2a showing starting temperature as a function of initial pulse<br>
pressure. Fig. 2a demonstrates the functional relationship between starting temperature<br>
(relative units) selected versus initial pulse pressure (in mm-Hg). For purposes of hardware<br>
simplicity, a 1-D interpolator may be used to perform a piece-wise linear interpolation of the<br>
starting temperature versus initial pulse pressure chart of Fig. 2a during step 208, although<br>
more complex interpolations, or curve fitting algorithms are possible such as e.g. polynomial<br>
or even spline interpolation.<br>
(2) Dither Generation<br>
       Referring now to Fig. 3, one exemplary method for dither generation 104 is discussed<br>
in detail. At a high level, the exemplary dither generation process 104 involves three basic<br>
steps of operation: (1) determination of the next dither pair sequence 302; (2) execution of<br>
the dither pair 316; and (3) clocking the temperature controller 350 according to a pre-<br>
specifled scheme.<br>
       Regarding steps (1) and (2), i.e. dither pair determination and execution, these<br>
processing steps will be discussed in detail below with regards to Figs. 3a, 3b and 3c.<br>
       Regarding step (3), logic within the apparatus will determine whether the<br>
temperature controller has been decked a pre-specified (e.g. two (2)) number of times at step<br>
352. If the logic returns "true", the current temperature will be reduced by by a prescribed<br>
amount; e.g., one "click", at step 356. If the logic returns false, the current temperature will<br>
be maintained at step 354.<br>
       Referring now to Fig. 3a, an exemplary embodiment of the process for determining<br>
the next dither pair sequence 302 is described in detail. A dither pair sequence determines<br>
the order of "experiments" or triais used when evaluating two different positions for the<br>
transducer apparatus. A dither pair sequence can thus be thought of as the center, or "heart"<br>
of the simulated annealing process that controls the positioning of the transducer under this<br>
unifying scheme.<br>
       In the present embodiment, the dither pair sequence is substantially randomized. The<br>
reasoning for this can perhaps best be explained by example. For instance, imagine that<br>
activity with regards to the patient's pulse pressure is in reality uncorrected with the<br><br>
apparatus movements. If this activity involves monotonic changes over large periods of<br>
time, such as a result of a particular physiological or pharmacological effect, fixing the order<br>
of the "experiments" or trials will have a very predictable and undesirable influence on the<br>
test results. For example, in cases where the patient's pulse pressures are monotonically<br>
increasing, and this increase is such that it is stronger than any influence exerted by moving<br>
the transducer position, then whichever position tested last in the dither pair will usually<br>
dominate, given that it will have the higher observed pulse pressure (as we are<br>
monotonically increasing in pressure). In such a case the transducer position would almost<br>
never move away from the previously established position. Conversely, if always ending<br>
with the dithered position last in each dither pair, the transducer position would always tend<br>
to move away with each dither pair to the randomly chosen dither. In order to combat this<br>
effect, the order of the dither pair is randomized, effectively eliminating any long-term<br>
accidental and non-causal correlation with external pulse pressure changes. Other schemes<br>
may be used to avoid such effects as well, however, including those which specifically<br>
analyze the possible effects (such as the foregoing monotonic scenario) and adaptively<br>
develop a scheme which combats or mitigates such deleterious effects. Furthermore,<br>
randomization may not be required at all times, and hence may be applied selectively if<br>
desired.<br>
       As is known in the mathematical arts, randomizing of signals and/or numerical<br>
sequences is most typically implemented through the use of so called pseudo random<br>
number generators which generate Pseudo Random Binary Sequences (PRBS). Pseudo<br>
Random Binary Sequences (PRRS) are a defined sequence of inputs (+/-1) that possess<br>
correlative properties similar to white noise, but converge in within a give time period. In<br>
addition, the inputs can be specified (and thereby optimized) to produce more effective<br>
signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) within the constraints of the system. One common type of PRBS<br>
sequence generator uses an n-bit shift register with a feedback structure containing modulo-2<br>
adders (i.e. XOR gates) and connected to appropriate taps on the shift register. The generator<br>
generates a maximal length binary sequence according to Eqn. 1:<br><br>
The maximal length (or "m-sequunce") has nearly random properties that are particularly<br>
useful in the present invention, and is classed as a pseudo-noise (PN) sequence. Properties of<br>
m-sequences commonly include:<br><br>
(a) "Balance" Property--For each period of the sequence, the number of '1's and '0's<br>
differ by at most one. For example in a 63 bit sequence, there are 32 't's and 31 '0's.<br>
(b) "Run Proportionality" Property-In the sequences of '1's and of'O's in each period,<br>
one half the runs of each kind are of length one, one quarter are of length two, one<br>
eighth are of length three, and so forth.<br>
(c) "Shift and add" Property-The modulo-2 sum of an m-sequence and any cyclic<br>
shift of the same sequence results in a third cyclic shift of the same sequence.<br>
(d) "Correlation" Property—When a full period of the sequence is compared in term-<br>
by-term fashion with any cyclic shift of itself, the number differences is equal to the<br>
number of similarities plus one (1).<br>
(e) "Spectral" Properties--The m-sequence is periodic, and therefore the spectrum<br>
consists of a sequence of equally-spaced harmonics where the spacing is the<br>
reciprocal of the period. With the exception of the dc harmonic, the magnitudes of<br>
the harmonics are equal. Aside from the spectral lines, the frequency spectrum of a<br>
maximum length sequence is similar to that of a random sequence.<br>
       In step 304, the apparatus will first determine whether in the previous dither pair, did<br>
the apparatus both: (1) end with a dithered position; and (2) choose to go towards the dither.<br>
In other words, was a new reference position established with the dithered position last. If<br>
so, then step 306 is invoked. Conversely, if the answer is no, then step 308 is invoked.<br>
       Assuming for a moment, that the answer to the logical query of step 304 was yes,<br>
then step 306 is invoked. At step 306, the apparatus queries to determine whether the<br>
temperature (i.e. the starting temperature selected at step 208) is low enough to enable an<br>
inferred reference position. An inferred reference position, as opposed to a standard<br>
reference position, is a position that can be extrapolated upon a very specific circumstance.<br>
This inferred reference position is extrapolated when a new dithered position is tested and<br>
the apparatus, and the underlying algorithm, decides to go towards this new dithered<br>
position.<br>
       A new reference position, at a predetermined distance between the two points beyond<br>
the dithered position in a direction that is further away from the previous reference position<br><br>
is "inferred". In one exemplary embodiment, this predetermined distance is 1/3rd (33.333%)<br>
of the previous dither. This in effect exaggerates the original dither movement by an<br>
additional l/3rd of the previous dither. However, such exaggerations are typically only<br>
deployed at low temperatures to avoid excessive movements. At low temperatures this<br>
extrapolation is desirable, as it provides a quantity of gain in order to increase slew rate<br>
beyond that which a given dither size would otherwise imply.<br>
       Fig. 3d graphically demonstrates for the utility of the aforementioned concept.<br>
Specifically, in cases where there is a fixed applanation dither size, small perturbations<br>
cannot be tracked when they are small compared to the fixed applanation dither size.<br>
Further, with large variations in the hemodynamic parameter measured, fixed applanation<br>
dither sizes may have difficulty in keeping up (i.e. because they are typically slew-rate-<br>
limited) with the signal. Therefore, as can be seen in Fig. 3d, it would be desirable to vary<br>
the dither size as a function of confidence (i.e. by lowering dither size to measure small<br>
perturbations when confidence is high and exaggerating dither size when confidence is low<br>
as a result of large variations in the signal).<br>
       Referring back to step 306, if the temperatures are low enough to enable an inferred<br>
reference position, then the apparatus will be asked to randomly choose between either of the<br>
following possible dither sequences at step 310: (1) [inferred reference, dither]; or (2)<br>
[dither, inferred reference]. Conversely, if the temperatures are not low enough, then the<br>
apparatus will randomly choose between either of the following possible dither sequences at<br>
step 312: (1) [reference, dither]; or (2) [dither, reference].<br>
       Referring back to the question queried back at step 304, if the answer to the query at<br>
step 304 is negative, then the apparatus will invoke step 308. In step 308, the apparatus<br>
queries to determine whether in the previous dither pair, did we both: (1) end with a<br>
reference position; and (2) choose: to stay with the reference position (i.e. was a new position<br>
not established and the reference position was last).<br>
       If the answer to the query at step 308 is negative, then the apparatus will randomly<br>
choose between either of the following dither sequences at step 312 as previously discussed.<br>
       If the answer is in the affirmative, then the apparatus will choose randomly either<br>
between (1) setting the dither sequence to [dither]; or (2) setting the dither sequence to<br>
[reference, dither] at step 314. In the case of (1), since a new reference position was not<br>
established in the previous dither pair and the reference position was last, processing time<br>
can advantageously be spared by simply re-using the measurements from the immediately<br>
prior measurement position.<br><br>
       Referring now to Fig. 3a. (part 2 of 3), one exemplary embodiment of the process for<br>
executing the dither pair 316 is described in detail. At an abstract level, executing a dither<br>
pair according to the present embodiment is equivalent to reading the specific dither<br>
sequence previously determined and going to each specified position type in sequence. At<br>
each position we collect the beat data then move on to the next position specified in the<br>
sequence. At the conclusion of this iterative data collection enough data has been collected<br>
to make a decision on which position should be declared as our reference position.<br>
       At step 318, the next position type specified in the sequence is first queried to<br>
determine what position type it is. Depending on its position type, different algorithms or<br>
processing steps may be implemented in order to process and execute the respective dither<br>
pair. If the position type is an inferred reference position, then step 320 is invoked, while if<br>
it is a reference position or dithered position, steps 322 or 324 are invoked, respectively.<br><br>
       At step 320, the position type has been determined to be an inferred reference<br>
position by the apparatus. The reference position and the next target are set to a position that<br>
is a predetermined value (e.g. 1/3rd) as far as the difference between the previous reference<br>
position and the previous dithered position beyond the previous dithered position.<br>
Mathematically, if our previous positions are designated PReference1-1 and PDither1-1 then the new<br>
reference position PReference is computed as follows using Eqn. 2:<br><br>
If the position type has been determined to be a reference position, then the apparatus will<br>
set the target position to the current reference position at step 322.<br>
       If the position type has been determined to be a dithered position, then a dithered<br>
position is generated at step 324, requiring the generation, transformation and "baking" of a<br>
"unit dither" at step 326. The term "baking" refers in the present context to the process of<br>
modifying the value of the unit dither as a function of temperature. At step 324, the<br>
apparatus must first determine the axes that will be involved in the dither. These axes may<br>
include, but are not limited to, the Cartesian axes previously discussed (i.e. applanation,<br>
lateral, and distal axes). In one exemplary implementation, each dither can utilize<br>
movements in any combination of the actuator axes (i.e., the aforementioned applanation,<br>
lateral and distal axes) either serially or in parallel. The ability to move in more than one<br>
axis in parallel can potentially speed up the response for cases where the pulse pressure<br>
profiles are at steep angles with nespect to the principle axes. However, for pulse pressure<br><br>
profiles that are largely parallel with the principle axes, single axis moves are often more<br>
beneficial. It is believed that most of these profiles are largely parallel, but not exactly<br>
parallel to, the principle axes. For purposes of robustness to alternate pulse pressure profiles,<br>
while at the same time acknowledging the nominal tendency for the profiles to be largely<br>
parallel to the exemplary actuator axes, a random mix of single and multiple axes dithers are<br>
performed in the illustrated embodiment, whose distribution is statistically controlled as a<br>
function of the current temperature.-<br>
       At step 328, and in one exemplary embodiment, a 1-D interpolator is used to perform<br>
a piece-wise linear interpolation of the chart shown at Fig. 3e to determine the applanation<br>
axis only dither probability. This exemplary chart shown in Fig. 3e is constructed currently<br>
such that at high temperature values, the chart returns a value of 0.33, while at low<br>
temperature values it returns a value of 0.66. Thus in this example, applanation-only dithers<br>
are twice as probable at low temperature values, than at high temperature values. The<br>
remaining dithers will be equally divided between performing a lateral-only dither, or a<br>
combined applanation and lateral dither, etc. A substantially random number is generated in<br>
the closed interval [0, 1]. This random number is then tested, if the random number is less<br>
than the applanation-only probability, then only applanation will be involved in the next<br>
dither. If the random number is greater than or equal to the applanation-only probability;<br>
and is less than Eqn. 2, then only lateral movements will be involved in the next dither. If<br>
the random number is greater than or equal to Eqn. 3, then both applanation and lateral<br>
movements will be involved in the next dither.<br><br>
       Referring now to Fig. 3b, the unit dither is generated, transformed and "baked". A<br>
unit dither is a unit less ordered N-Tuple of numbers, each of which is from the closed<br>
interval [-1, 1], with N being the number of axes of movement implemented in the<br>
exemplary actuator context This N-Tuple of numbers is central to the process for<br>
generating randomized dithers for the simulated annealing algorithm described herein. For<br>
purposes of simplicity, it is assumed that the number of axes (N) in the example of the<br>
process of step 326 is equal to two (2), although more or less axes may be incorporated.<br>
       At step 330, the unit dither is generated. The apparatus first determines whether the<br>
unit dither generation is for a reference dither. If the result returns "true", then a unit dither<br>
of [0, 0] will be returned. If the result returns "false", then a randomly generated N-Tuple<br><br>
that resides in a unit cube is generated. Unit dither generation is first started by generating a<br>
random point within the unit cube. Although it is not desirable to end up with a unit sphere,<br>
using a spherical coordinate system to generate the random point will allow for a distribution<br>
of points such that most of the points wilt be concentrated at small radii. Random spherical<br>
generation will distribute points in such a way that the number of points at a given radius is<br>
nominally constant, thus this would imply lower densities at higher radii, as this constant<br>
number of points will be distributed over a larger circumference at the larger radii. To avoid<br>
this situation, random points aie first generated in a Cartesian coordinate system, in effect<br>
guaranteeing a uniform distribution of points per unit volume.<br>
       Generating a randomly generated N-tuple is accomplished in one exemplary<br>
embodiment in the following manner. These steps are repeated for each of the N<br>
dimensions, here two (2), to generate the N-tuple.<br>
       First, a signed random number in the closed interval [-1, 1] is generated. Next, the<br>
concept of offset bias is introduced. Adaptive and axis-specific offset biases, each of which<br>
are constrained to values in the closed interval [-1, 1], are maintained to influence the<br>
distribution of the randomly generated dithers. For example, a dither offset bias value of<br>
zero in the illustrated embodiment indicates that there is no bias applied to the given dither<br>
generation for a given axis, while a value of 1.0 indicates that 100% of the time a positive<br>
going dither will be generated. Likewise a dither offset value bias of -1.0 indicates that<br>
100% of the time a negative going dither will be generated. This concept is utilized to<br>
adaptively respond to evidence developed that indicates, for example, that the majority of<br>
successful dithers in the recent positioning history along the applanation axis were mostly<br>
negative. In this case, a negative dither offset bias will be generated to increase the<br>
likelihood of generating negative applanation dithers.<br>
       Using the current adaptively-determined offset bias for the given dimension i, Biasi,<br>
Biasi is clipped to the closed interval of [-0.99, 0.99]. Bias is then calculated as being equal<br>
to 1 minus Biasi. A random number R is generated in the closed interval [0, 1.0] and then a<br>
signed random number is calculated using Eqn. 4.<br>
SignedRcmdomNumber = 2 x R - Bias	(Eqn. 4)<br>
If SignedRandomNumber is greater than zero, then Eqn. 5 is used; if it is less than zero, Eqn.<br>
6 is used. The ith component of the N-Tuple is set to the newly calculated<br>
SignedRandomNumber.<br><br><br>
       The unit dither specification is then tested for compliance. The radius of the unit<br>
dither is computed, and exemplary logic determines whether the radius of the unit dither is<br>
less than or equal to one, to ensure that the point falls inside of the unit sphere. If the unit<br>
dither falls within the unit sphere, then the logic determines if the radius is greater than or<br>
equal to 0.5. This test is utilized to avoid the generation of small dithers relative to the<br>
maximum possible given the current temperature.<br>
       If greater than or equal to 0.5, the square of the radius is calculated, while either<br>
serially or in parallel a random number is generated in the closed interval [0, 1]. If the<br>
random number generated is less than or equal to the square of the radius, then the unit<br>
dither passes the criteria established and the result is returned. If any of these tests fail, unit<br>
dither generation is repeated.<br>
       In step 332, the unit dither is transformed to a number with physical units to guide<br>
the actuator movement. The transformation process converts this unit less N-tuple into a<br>
similar N-tuple, but with physical units. Note, however, that the units may be different<br>
depending on the axis that it controls. For instance applanation units in the transformed unit<br>
dither may be in mm-Hg, although this is by no means a requirement, thus allowing for a<br>
tissue compliance-related response further downstream in the apparatus code. Similarly<br>
units for lateral position may use finer units than that used for distal position, to account for<br>
differences in the potential range between these two axes. It is in this step that nominal<br>
differences in travel, i.e. aspect ratio, between the various axes are taken into account.<br>
       First, for each axis in the N-tuple of the unit dither specification, the axis-specific<br>
component in the N-tuple will be transformed. The maximum specified dither travel for the<br>
given axis Dithermax will then be obtained. In one embodiment, this quantity will be fixed at<br>
the compile time of the software implementing the algorithm, and will represent the nominal<br>
maximum dither to be generated for the given axis, though run-time adaptations can cause<br>
the generations of yet larger dithers when determined to be appropriate. The ith component of<br>
the N-tuple is then transformed into physical units using Eqn. 7.<br><br><br>
       The adaptively determintsd aspect ratio is then applied. "Aspect ratio" as used in the<br>
context of the present embodiment specifically refers to the aspect ratio between the<br>
applanation and lateral and/or distal axes, etc., however for simplicity it will be only<br>
discussed as the ratio between applanation and lateral. In this particular embodiment, this<br>
more specifically refers to the ratio of the maximum applanation dither to the maximum<br>
lateral dither (or derivative quantities relating thereto). At compile-time, a fixed nominal<br>
aspect ratio is defined such that a given unit dither specification of [1, 1], the resulting dither<br>
will have an applanation displacement versus a lateral displacement that are related by this<br>
nominal aspect ratio. In other words, the nominal aspect ratio defined at compile-time<br>
allows the code to abstract these nominal differences away, and therefore can largely<br>
concentrate instead on the run-time tweaks to this basic relationship.<br>
       An aspect ratio "tweak" in the present context is an adaptively determined quantity<br>
that is signed and has values in the closed interval [-1,1]. A value of "0" implies that no<br>
adaptation is necessary in the dither aspect ratio. A positive value indicates that over-and-<br>
above the nominal aspect ratio, applanation should be further emphasized, and a negative<br>
value indicates that lateral should be further emphasized. In actual implementation when,<br>
e.g., an applanation emphasis is tailed for, (i.e. an aspect ratio "tweak" &gt; 0), "half of this<br>
emphasis is placed upon the applanation axis, and "half of this is used to de-emphasize the<br>
lateral axis. In this way, disruptions resulting from too large a degree the nominal vector<br>
length of the dither being generated are advantageously avoided. If for instance, the<br>
applanation axis has an aspect ratio tweak value that is positive, the applanation dither is<br>
further emphasized. Note also that the use of "half of the aspect ratio tweak on the<br>
applanation axis, and the other half on the lateral axis is meant purely in a geometric sense;<br>
hence the use of the square root in Eqn. 8. The invention is in no way limited to such "half"<br>
or other schemes, however. Conversely, if the applanation axis has an aspect ratio tweak<br>
value that is negative, Eqn. 9 is used which effectively de-emphasizes further the applanation<br>
dither.<br><br><br>
An adaptively determined aspect ratio adjustment for pulse pressure curve asymmetry is then<br>
applied. This is done in order to account for the typical pulse pressure curve asymmetries<br>
found irrespective of whether the device is currently operating above or below the patient's<br>
mean pressure. It has been found by the inventors hereof that pulse pressure slopes above<br>
the patient's mean pressure roll-off at a much steeper rate than the pulse pressure rise below<br>
the patient's mean pressure. In other words, when above the patient's mean pressure, there<br>
is a need to de-emphasize the applanation axis dither, while this dither should be emphasized<br>
when below the patient's mean pressure.<br>
       The adaptively determined dither offset values can be utilized to give an indication<br>
whether or not the apparatus is largely applanating or de-applanating. If the apparatus is<br>
largely applanating, then it can foe deduced that pulse pressure readings may be below the<br>
patient's mean pressure. Conversely, if the apparatus is largely de-applanating, then it is<br>
likely that the readings are above the patient's mean pressure. Through studies conducted by<br>
the Assignee hereof, it has been determined that this ratio is roughly 260%; that is, the pulse<br>
pressure slopes are approximately 2.6 times steeper above the patient's mean than below it.<br>
Therefore, given AboveVsBelowMeanPPRatio = 2.60, the application ratio tweak is<br>
calculated using Eqn. 10 where the AppOffset value is greater than or equal to zero,<br>
otherwise Eqn. 11 is used.<br><br>
Similarly, if it is desired to de-emphasize (using Eqn. 13) or emphasize (Eqn. 14) other axes,<br>
such as the lateral axis, this can be calculated as well using similar aspect ratio tweaks.<br>
Thus, the dither value at each position i is calculated using the value obtained by either Eqn.<br>
10 or Eqn. 11 using Eqn. 12.<br><br><br><br><br>
       Following the transformation process of the unit dither, the unit dither is now<br>
"baked" at step 334. The term "baking" refers in the present context to the process of<br>
modifying the value of the unit dither as a function of temperature. It is generally expected<br>
that a response at high temperatures (i.e. correlating to a lower confidence that the transducer<br>
is located properly) the system should be displaced more, while at lower temperatures the<br>
system is expected to be displaced less.<br>
       In one embodiment, the transformed unit dither is baked by first obtaining the current<br>
"taxed" temperature for each axis. "Taxing", as the name implies, is the core system<br>
temperature with an added "tax'; here a generic and arbitrary quantity that can be used for<br>
multiple purposes. A tax can be applied to the temperature for various reasons, but in<br>
general it is used to penalize the system, or perhaps put it in an increased state of<br>
perturbation or awareness. In this embodiment, the temperature is taxed only when the<br>
current mean pressure is particularly high or low (as determined against, e.g., predetermined<br>
or variant criteria), corresponding to the likelihood that the value is not correct<br>
       It should also be noted that in the current embodiment, a temperature can be used<br>
either taxed or not taxed and thus at any one time both versions can be made available in the<br>
system. In an alternate embodiment, each axis will have a temperature equivalent to the<br>
system-wide core temperature.<br>
       Referring now to Fig. 3f, the temperature coefficient is determined using a 1-D<br>
interpolator to perform a piece-wise linear interpolation of the chart depicted in Fig. 3f. The<br>
baked dither is then calculated using Eqn. 15.<br><br>
       Referring again back to Fig. 3a (part 3 of 3), in step 336 the apparatus advances to<br>
the target position, regardless of whether it was an inferred reference position, reference<br>
position or a dithered position. If the target position is not reached within a predetermined<br>
amount of time (e.g. 1.5 seconds), then the system times out on this dither and notifies the<br>
system while aborting the simulated annealing process.<br><br>
       If the target position is reached in time, the beat data is collected at step 338. The<br>
process for collecting beat data is described in detail below with regards to Fig. 3c and its<br>
accompanying disclosure.<br>
       After collection of the beat data, the system determines whether the last position was<br>
the last position type in the sequence at step 346. If it is not, the whole process repeats<br>
starting at step 318. If it is the last position in the sequence, the algorithm advances to<br>
hemodynamic parameter processing.<br>
(3) Hemodynamic Parameter Processing<br>
       Referring now to Fig. 3c, the collection of beat data 338 is described in detail. At step<br>
340, the number of beats to collect is determined. In one embodiment, the number of beats<br>
to collect is fixed at a predetermined number (e.g. two (2)). Alternatively, in a second<br>
embodiment, the number of beats is collected as a function of one or more parameters (e.g.,<br>
temperature). In this example, ti piece-wise linear interpolation of the chart of Fig. 3f<br>
(Temperature vs. Beats to Collect) is used to determine the baseline number of beats to be<br>
collected.<br>
       In a third embodiment that can be used either alone or in conjunction with either of<br>
the two previous embodiments, (computer or algorithmic) logic determines whether the core<br>
temperature value is below a certain threshold (e.g. 2000). If so, then a statistical algorithm<br>
is employed which first generates a random number in the closed interval [0,1] and tests this<br>
random number to see whether it it: either higher or lower than the midpoint of die interval<br>
(i.e. 0.5). If it is less than the midpoint, a pre-specifted number of beats are added (e.g. one<br>
(1)), while if the random number is greater than the midpoint, the number of beats to detect<br>
is left at the existing value.<br>
       The reason for the foregoing approach utilized in this third embodiment is that at low<br>
temperatures, there are conflicts between two opposing needs. As the vast majority of dithers<br>
will occur at lower temperatures, the decisions made at these low temperatures would benefit<br>
by as little noise as is practicable. On the other hand, it is undesirable to sacrifice a rapid<br>
response to large changes, and to a large degree the noise is taken out in the long run as the<br>
results of consecutive dithers that are cumulative in nature.<br>
       Furthermore it has been observed that at low temperatures, the resultant dithers of<br>
these decisions are small in nature and that they therefore do not by themselves have a large<br>
impact on these decisions. So in response, an approach is taken that statistically adds in the<br>
equivalent of an additional "half a beat" on average at these low temperatures.<br><br>
       Therefore, at these lower temperatures, half of the time the number of beats are taken<br>
as normally would be determined given the current temperature, etc., and the other half of<br>
the time, one additional beat is taken under this third embodiment.<br>
       At step 342, beat detection is delayed for a predetermined amount of time. This beat<br>
delay detection is utilized to account for delays such as (1) group delays in batch processing;<br>
or (2) for settling time after a dither. In one embodiment, these delays are set to 250 ms and<br>
125 ms respectively, accounting for a total delay of 375 ms, although it will be recognized<br>
that other values may be used.<br>
       At step 344, the apparatus waits for either a beat timeout or a detected beat. A beat<br>
timeout in the present context comprsies the absence of a detected beat during any<br>
designated epoch of time, such as e.g., five (5) seconds. While primarily envisioned as only<br>
utilizing a pre-established epoch of time, certain embodiments of the present invention may<br>
extend, contract or adapt this timeout as conditions change within the system. For example,<br>
after a detected motion event, the wait period may be reset, re-establishing the full<br>
designated epoch of time. Alternatively, after a detected motion event, the wait period may<br>
be extended for a specified period of time.<br>
       If on the other hand a beat is detected, the exemplary apparatus executes logic which<br>
determines whether the detected beat occurred within a prescribed period (e.g., one second)<br>
of a previously detected motion event. If it has, then the beat is ignored. If not, the beat is<br>
stored for later processing. For example, in one embodiment, the detected beat is added to<br>
previously detected beats to keep a running average calculation of mean pulse pressure<br>
values over the duration of the beat collection cycle.<br>
       Referring now to Fig. 4, the hemodynamic parameter processing step 106 of Fig. 1 is<br>
described in detail.<br>
       At step 400, patient monitoring mode (PMM) bias is applied to the measured pulse<br>
pressure difference. PMM bias is a correction that is applied to the measured pulse<br>
(pulsatile) pressure difference in order to correct what has been observed as flat pulse<br>
pressure curves. It has been observed through experiment by the Assignee hereof that when<br>
the pulse pressure versus mean pressure curves becomes flattened, the peak in this curve<br>
occurs at a place that is actually higher than the patient's mean pressure. The flatter the<br>
curve becomes, the larger this offset appears to be. As the peak in this pulse pressure curve<br>
is used as a basis to determine the patient's mean pressure, a corrective bias is applied in<br>
order to shift the peak towards lower pressure to correct for this phenomenon. This shift is<br>
such that it will typically be larger for flatter curves, and smaller for sharper curves. In one<br>
embodiment, this factor has been set to 35% (0.35). However, in order to avoid issues of<br><br>
these bias values lowering pressures too far, various measures are taken to curtail its effect<br>
In one exemplary embodiment, :he PMM bias in step 400 is applied as follows using Eqn. 16<br>
and Eqn. 17:<br><br>
       After performing these two calculations, the PMM bias is determined by performing<br>
a piece-wise linear interpolation of the reference mean as a function of PMM bias (chart<br>
shown in Fig. 4a) to determine the nominal PMM bias to use. This linear interpolation can<br>
be performed by using an interpolator (e.g. a 1-D interpolator). After obtaining the current<br>
taxed (or in some embodiments, untaxed) temperature, a piece-wise linear interpolation of<br>
the temperature as a function of PMM bias temperature factor is determined using a chart<br>
such as that shown in Fig. 4b. The addition of the pulse pressure bias is then performed<br>
thusly using Eqn. 18, Eqn. 19 and Eqn. 20:<br><br>
Note that the term on the right side of Eqn. 19 is negative to reflect mat the higher the mean<br>
pressure difference is, the more the pulse pressure difference should be de-emphasized.<br><br>
Next, the algorithm must make the transition decision at step 402. This transition decision is<br>
based on a combination of where the timeout occurred, and in which position (dithered<br>
and/or reference). If no timeout occurred in either position (i.e. dithered and reference),<br>
which is the most typical case, then pulse pressure change is determined using Eqn. 21 at<br>
step 406.<br><br><br>
       At step 408, the transition probability is determined. In simulated annealing,<br>
transition probabilities are based upon both the change in energy, (the negative of the change<br>
in pulse pressure in one embodiment), and the current temperature. While the transition<br>
probability is normally set to 100% if there is a decrease in energy, (simulated annealing<br>
attempts to lower the total energy of a system; this is equivalent to an increase in pulse<br>
pressure in the exemplary implementation for a hemodynamic system), there are a variety of<br>
responses for the cases of no change in energy, or for an increase in energy state. This<br>
feature in large part gives simulated annealing its inherent ability to be able to move away<br>
from locally optimal areas and find what would be the global optima. In essence, it is the<br>
ability to occasionally, in a metered way and under strict control, advance a move towards a<br>
higher energy (lower pulse pressure) state, that provides many of the benefits of the<br>
simulated annealing control process.<br>
       In step 408, the change in energy is determined using a piece-wise linear<br>
interpolation of the AEnergy as a function of APressure (see chart of Fig. 4c). Note that the<br>
chart and linear interpolation are only used for changes of pulse pressure that are negative.<br>
If the AEnergy is negative, the transition probability is set to 1.0. If the AEnergy is equal to<br>
zero, then the transition probability is set to 0.5. If the AEnergy is positive (i.e., the dithered<br>
position resulted in a smaller pulse pressure) and the current temperature is greater than a<br>
prescribed value (e.g., 500), then the transition probability is set to zero. However, if the<br>
AEnergy is positive and the current temperature is less than 500, then a 2-D interpolator is<br>
used to perform a bi-linear interpolation of the transition probability as a function of<br>
temperature, and the delta energy chart of Fig. 4c is utilized to determine the transition<br>
probability.<br>
       At step 410, if the timeout was only in the dithered position, or was in both the<br>
reference and dithered positions, then the transition probability is set to zero. Conversely, at<br>
step 412, if the timeout only occurs in the reference position, then the transition possibility is<br>
set to 1.0.<br>
       At step 414, a decision is made about whether to take the transition or not In one<br>
embodiment, the apparatus will generate a random number in the closed interval [0, 1]. If<br>
the random number is less man the transition probability then the system will take the<br>
transition towards the dithered position, otherwise it will start with the current reference<br>
position.<br><br><br>
       Referring now to Fig. 5, an exemplary embodiment of the adaptive adjustment<br>
algorithm of the invention is described.<br>
       Per step 500 the temperature is adaptively adjusted. Note that the exemplary<br>
adjustments described herein are subject to limits beyond which the adjustment will not take<br>
effect. For temperature increases, the limit imposes a maximum, and for temperature<br>
decreases, the limit imposes a minimum. In adjusting the temperature, the timeout pattern is<br>
also analyzed. In the nominal case (i.e. where mere is no timeout), signs of excessive<br>
modulation of the pulse pressure are identified by determining whether or not there was a<br>
large pressure change (step 502). In one exemplary embodiment, this determination is<br>
accomplished in a two-step process. First, logic determines whether the large pulse pressure<br>
is greater than a prescribed value (e.g., fifteen (15) mm-Hg). If not, the logic returns "false";<br>
otherwise logic men queries whether the smaller pulse pressure is less than or equal to a<br>
given percentage (e.g., 60%) of the larger pulse pressure. If it is, then the logic returns<br>
"true", otherwise it returns "false". While the threshold limits of fifteen mm-Hg and 60% of<br>
the larger pulse pressures have been chosen for this example, it is understood that these<br>
numbers may vary considerably from application to application, the aforementioned<br>
numbers merely being exemplary.<br>
       If the pressure change was too large in magnitude (i.e., the logic has returned true),<br>
then the temperature is reduced (e.g. by a prescribed increment such as 2 "clicks") at step<br>
504. If there was not a large instant pressure change, logic then determines whether or not<br>
there was a large mean pressure change to determine whether the mean pressure is being<br>
excessively modulated. In one embodiment, If the mean pressure change increases by more<br>
than 35 mm-Hg, then the logic wilt return "true" and the temperature will be decreased by a<br>
set amount (e.g. two (2) clicks). If not, then logic determines if there was too small of a<br>
pulse pressure or mean pressure change at step 506. This is to ensure that at least a minimal<br>
amount of both pulse pressure and mean pressure modulation is applied to the system.<br>
       In one variant, if the absolute pulse pressure change is less man 1 mm-Hg, then the<br>
logic will return "true", otherwise it will determine if the absolute mean pressure change is<br>
less than 1.5mm-Hg, and then return "true" if the answer is yes, otherwise it will return<br>
"false". If logic determines the change was too small, then the temperature is increased at<br>
step 510 (e.g. by 1.3 clicks), otherwise the temperature is kept current (step 508).<br>
       Note however that the aforementioned process (i.e. steps 502 - 510) are applicable<br>
when there has been no timeout observed. At step 512, logic determines whether there was a<br>
dither beat timeout, a reference beat timeout, or both. At step 514, the occurrence of a dither<br>
beat timeout event normally suggests that the system may have been dithered too much so as<br><br>
to lose the beat at the dithered position. This suggests a temperature that is too high if the<br>
assumption that has been made is correct However, if the reference beat is not strong either,<br>
then there is a risk of losing the reference beat as well by dithering too much, and inducing<br>
too much large signal behavior.<br>
       Therefore, before assuming that the initial assumption was a valid one, logic is used<br>
in the exemplary algorithm to determine whether the reference beat pulse pressure is greater<br>
man a minimum amount (e.g. 10mm-Hg), which is to ensure that reducing temperature does<br>
not raise the possibility that the reference beat may be lost by any large temperature changes<br>
to the system. If the reference beat pulse pressure is greater than the minimum amount, then<br>
the temperature is decreased. In one exemplary embodiment, the temperature is reduced by<br>
three (3) clicks, otherwise no change is made.<br>
       At step 316, if there was only a reference beat timeout, then the temperature is<br>
increased. In one embodiment, this temperature increase is 1.5 clicks, although other values<br>
may be used.<br>
       At step 518, if there is both a reference and a dither beat timeout, then the<br>
temperature is increased. In one embodiment, this temperature increase is by 2.5 clicks.<br>
Note that in the illustrated embodiment, the temperature increase for this second condition<br>
(both timeouts) is larger than for the reference-only timeout, since greater correction<br>
magnitude is ostensibly required.<br>
       At step 519, respective dither strengths are determined given the dither specification.<br>
Dither strength is a characterization of the degree to which a particular dither was deemed to<br>
be either strongly lateral or strongly applanation, etc., or alternatively the degree to which it<br>
was strongly neither. Recall that in general, random dithers have been taken along all of the<br>
participating axes, however in order to tune various adaptive parameters it is often important<br>
to collect data on the effectiveness of the dithers taken primarily along one of the principle<br>
axes. In one embodiment, a strong predominantly signal-axis dither is taken to be one<br>
whereby its normalized dither, equivalent to its mapping in the unit sphere, is within 30<br>
degrees of a principle axis. In one exemplary embodiment, the dither strength is determined<br>
as follows:<br>
Step One: Normalize the applanation and lateral dither amounts using Eqn. 22;<br><br><br><br>
       Step Four: If yes to step three, then test Ditherapp&gt;0. If yes, return<br>
App_Is_Strongly_Positive, otherwise return App_Is_Strongly_Negative;<br>
Step Five: If no to step three, then test the applanation dither amount using Eqn. 24<br><br>
Step Six: If yes to step five, then test Ditherlot&gt;0. If yes, return<br>
Lat_Is_Strongly_Positivet otherwise return Lat_Is_Strongly_Negative; If no to step five, then<br>
return neutral.<br>
       At step 520, a 12-point running sum for both applanation and lateral movements is<br>
recorded.<br>
       It will be recognized that while the foregoing process is described with respect to<br>
lateral and/or applantion axes or dimensions, others may be used, either in place of the<br>
foregoing, or in conjunction therewith (or even in different permutations), as will be readily<br>
implemented by those of ordinary skill given the present disclosure.<br>
       At step 522, the applanation and running sums for the adaptations are updated. In a<br>
first embodiment, these sums are updated as follows.<br>
       If App_Is_Strongly_Positive is returned, then logic determines whether the transition<br>
to the dither was taken. If yes, the applanation running sum is fed a value of two (2),<br>
otherwise it is fed a value of negative one (-1).<br>
       If App_Is_Strongly_Negative. is returned, then logic determines whether the transition<br>
to the dither was taken. If yes, the applanation running sum is fed a value of negative two (-<br>
2), otherwise it is fed a value of one (I).<br>
       If Lat_Is_Strongly_Positive is retumed, then logic determines whether the transition<br>
to the dither was taken. If yes, the lateral running sum is fed a value of two (2), otherwise it<br>
is fed a value of negative one (-1).<br><br>
       If Lat_Is_Strongly_Negative is returned, then logic determines whether the transition<br>
to the dither was taken. If yes, he lateral running sum is fed a value of negative two (-2),<br>
otherwise it is fed a value of one (1).<br>
If nothing is returned, notching is added to the running sums.<br>
       At step 524, the adaptive aspect ratio is determined. First, however, a similarity<br>
score that measures how similar the applanation and lateral values are, a dissimilarity score<br>
that determines how dissimilar the applanation and lateral values are and the categorization<br>
strength score mat measures the extent to which the similarity and the dissimilarity scores<br>
can be trusted needs to be determined. The equations for these calculations are shown below<br>
as Eqn.'s (25) through (28).<br><br>
Next, if the variable Scoreaolegqrbaalon snnslll &gt; 0.35 then logic determines whether or<br>
not Scoredtalmaarlv&gt; Scoreslmllarlv If not, then the scores are said to be too unequivocal or<br>
indefinite, and hence cannot be acted upon. In this case, the aspect ratio will be slowly<br>
decayed towards zero, which is; generally the safest place to be whenever in doubt In one<br>
embodiment, the aspect ratio is thus calculated using Eqn. 29:<br><br><br><br>
this is an indication that the stores are probably similar. The aspect ratio should thus be<br>
affected by the confidence of 1 similarity, however to be more careful, the aspect ratio is<br>
approached geometrically rather than by making a sudden change to a new value. Recall that<br>
our target aspect ratio for a similarity is simply towards zero. The aspect ratio is thus in one<br>
embodiment calculated as:<br><br>
indication that the scores are probably dissimilar. However, this is obviously easy to<br>
conclude when one of the scores (e.g. applanation or lateral) is 0. So it must also be<br>
demanded in that case a minimum absolute difference of scores (see e.g. Eqn. 31).<br><br>
If Eqn. 31 is satisfied, then the likelihood of dissimilarity is more confidently reaffirmed.<br>
However, the case where one of the scores (applanation or lateral) is zero has not been ruled<br>
out. Since such a condition tends to exaggerate the dissimilarity score, when such a case<br>
occurs it is desirable to modulate the dissimilarity score by the magnitude of the non-zero<br>
score. See Eqn. 32.<br><br>
If Scoreficdlotllstlty&gt;Scoresimilarity, then the aspect ratio is calculated in one embodiment using<br>
Eqn. 33, otherwise no action is taken.<br><br><br>
       At step 526, a temperature tax is adaptively assessed upon the reference mean. First,<br>
the latest reference mean is added to an n-point (e.g. S-point) running average. In one<br>
embodiment, the balance of these calculations occurs upon demand at the time that the taxed<br>
temperature is required. This is particularly advantageous, as the tax is based upon the<br>
current core temperature at the time that it is needed.<br>
       Next, a piece-wise linear interpolation is performed on an average mean as a function<br>
of temperature tax chart as is shown in Fig. 5a. Upon determining the temperature tax, logic<br>
determines if an "alternative minimum tax" (AMT) should be assessed. This AMT is<br>
assessed when temperatures go below a certain threshold. This logic asks whether or not the<br>
core temperature is below MaxTempForAMT? If so, then use Eqn. 34, otherwise the<br>
apparatus uses Eqn. 35.<br><br>
System Apparatus for Hemodynamic Assessment<br>
       Referring now to Fig. 6, exemplary embodiments of apparatus for measuring<br>
hemodynamic properties within the blood vessel of a living subject consistent with the<br>
control methodologies of the present invention are now described. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, the apparatus is adapted for the measurement of blood pressure within the<br>
radial artery of a human being, although it will be recognized that other hemodynamic<br>
parameters, monitoring sites, and even types of living organism may be utilized in<br>
conjunction with the invention in its broadest sense.<br>
       The exemplary apparatus 600 of Fig. 6 fundamentally comprises an applanation<br>
assembly (including one or more pressure transducers 622) for measuring blood pressure<br>
from the radial artery tonometrically; a digital processor 608 operatively connected to the<br>
pressure transducers) 622 (and a number of intermediary components) for (i) analyzing the<br>
signals generated by the transducers); (ii) generating control signals for the stepper motor<br>
606 (via a microcontroller 611a operatively coupled to the stepper motor control circuits);<br><br>
and (iii) storing measured and analyzed data. The motor controllers 611, processor 608,<br>
auxiliary board 623, and other components may be housed either locally to the applanator<br>
602, or alternatively in a separate stand-alone housing configuration if desired. The pressure<br>
transducer 622 and its associated storage device 652 are optionally made removable from the<br>
applanator 602.<br>
       The pressure transducer 522 is, in the present embodiment, a strain beam transducer<br>
element which generates an electrical signal in functional relationship (e.g., proportional) to<br>
the pressure applied to its sensing surface, although other technologies may be used. The<br>
analog pressure signals generated by the pressure transducer 622 are converted into a digital<br>
form (using, e.g., an ADC 609) after being optionally low-pass filtered 613 and sent to the<br>
signal processor 608 for analysis. Depending on the type of analysis employed, the signal<br>
processor 608 utilizes its program either embedded or stored in an external storage device to<br>
analyze the pressure signals and other related data (e.g., stepper motor position as<br>
determined by the position encoder 677, scaling data contained in the transducer's EEPROM<br>
652 via I2C1 signal).<br>
       As shown in Fig. 6, the apparatus 600 is also optionally equipped with a second<br>
stepper motor 645 and associated controller 611b, the second motor 645 being adapted to<br>
move the applanator assembly 602 laterally across the blood vessel (e.g., radial artery) of the<br>
subject as described above. A third stepper motor (not shown) and associated controls may<br>
also be implemented if desired to control the proximal positioning of the applanation<br>
element 602. Operation of the lateral positioning motor 645 and its controller 611b is<br>
substantially analogous to that of the applanation motor 606, consistent with the<br>
methodologies previously described herein..<br>
       As previously discussed, continuous accurate noninvasive measurements of<br>
hemodynamic parameters (e.g., blood pressure) are highly desirable. To this end, the<br>
apparatus 600 is designed to (i) identify the proper level of applanation of the subject blood<br>
vessel and associated tissue; (ii) continuously "servo" on this condition to maintain the blood<br>
vessel/tissue properly biased for the best possible tonometric measurement; optionally; and<br>
(iii) scale the tonometric measurement as needed to provide an accurate representation of<br>
intravascular pressure to the user/operator.<br>
       During the simulated annealing process, the controller 611a controls the applanation<br>
motor 606 to applanate the artery (and interposed tissue) according to a predetermined<br>
profile. Such control schemes may also be employed with respect to the lateral and proximal<br>
motor drive assemblies if desired, or alternatively a more static approach (i.e., position to an<br>
optimal initial position, and then reposition only upon the occurrence of an event causing<br><br>
significant misalignment). In this regard, it will be recognized that the control schemes for<br>
the applanation motor and the lateral/proximal positioning motor(s) may be coupled to any<br>
degree desired consistent with the invention.<br>
       The apparatus 600 is also configured to apply the methodologies of the first, second,<br>
third and fourth processes 102, 104, 106 and 108 previously discussed with respect to Figs. 1<br>
- 5. Details of exemplary implementations of these latter methodologies are described<br>
elsewhere herein.<br>
       The physical apparatus 600 of PIG. 6 comprises, in the illustrated embodiment, a<br>
substantially self-contained unit having, inter alia, a combined pressure transducer 622 and<br>
applanation device 600, motor controllers 611, RISC digital processor 608 with associated<br>
synchronous DRAM (SDRAM) memory 617 and instruction set (including scaling lookup<br>
tables), display LEDs 619, front panel input device 621, and power supply 624. In this<br>
embodiment, the controllers 611 are used to control the operation of the combined pressure<br>
transducer/applanation device, who the control and scaling algorithms are implemented on a<br>
continuing basis, based on initial operator/user inputs.<br>
       For example, in one embodiment, the user input interface comprises a plurality (e.g.,<br>
two) buttons disposed on the face of the apparatus housing (not shown) and coupled to the<br>
LCD display 679. The processor programming and LCD driver are configured to display<br>
interactive prompts via the display 679 to the user upon depression of each of the two<br>
buttons.<br>
       Furthermore, a patient monitor (PM) interface circuit 691 shown in Fig. 6 may be<br>
used to interface the apparatus 600 to an external or third-party patient monitoring system.<br>
Exemplary configurations for such interfaces 691 are described in detail in co-pending U.S.<br>
patent application Ser. No. 10/060,646 entitled "Apparatus and Method for Interfacing Time-<br>
Variant Signals" filed Jan. 30, 2002, and assigned to the Assignee hereof, which is<br>
incorporated by reference herein in its entirely, although other approaches and circuits may<br>
be used. The referenced interface circuit has the distinct advantage of automatically<br>
interfacing with literally any type of patient monitor system regardless of its configuration.<br>
In this fashion, the apparatus 600 of the present invention coupled to the aforementioned<br>
interface circuit allows clinicians end other health care professionals to plug the apparatus<br>
into in situ monitoring equipment already on hand at their facility, thereby obviating the<br>
need (and cost) associated with a dedicated monitoring system just for blood pressure<br>
measurement.<br>
       Additionally, an EEPROM 552 is physically coupled to the pressure transducer 622<br>
as shown in FIG. 6 so as to form a unitary unit which is removable from the host apparatus<br><br>
600. The details of the construction and operation of exemplary embodiments of such<br>
coupled assemblies are described in detail in co-owned U.S. Pat. No. 6,676,600, entitled<br>
"Smart Physiologic Parameter Sensor and Method", issued Jan. 13, 2004, assigned to the<br>
Assignee hereof, and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety, although other<br>
configurations clearly may be substituted. By using such a coupled and removable<br>
arrangement, both the transducer 622 and EEPROM 652 may be readily removed and<br>
replaced within the system 600 by the operator.<br>
       It is also noted that the apparatus 600 described herein may be constructed in a<br>
variety of different configurations, and using a variety of different components other than<br>
those specifically described herein. For example, it will be recognized that while many of the<br>
foregoing components such as the processor 608, ADC 609, controller 611, and memory are<br>
described effectively as discrete integrated circuit components, these components and their<br>
functionality may be combined into one or more devices of higher integration level (e.g., so-<br>
called "system-on-chip" (SoC) devices). The construction and operation of such different<br>
apparatus configurations (given the disclosure provided herein) are readily within the<br>
possession of those of ordinary skill in the medical instrumentation and electronics field, and<br>
accordingly not described further nerein.<br>
       The computer program(s) for implementing the aforementioned first, second, third<br>
and fourth processes are also included in the apparatus 600. In one exemplary embodiment,<br>
the computer program comprises an object ("machine") code representation of a C++ source<br>
code listing implementing the methodology of FIGS. 1 -5, either individually or in<br>
combination thereof. While C++ language is used for the present embodiment, it will be<br>
appreciated that other programming languages may be used, including for example<br>
VisualBasic™, FORTRAN, and C+. The object code representation of the source code listing<br>
is compiled and may be disposed on a media storage device of the type well known in the<br>
computer arts. Such media storage devices can include, without limitation, optical discs, CD<br>
ROMs, magnetic floppy disks or "hard" drives, tape drives, or even magnetic bubble<br>
memory. These programs may also be embedded within the program memory of an<br>
embedded device if desired. The computer program may further comprise a graphical user<br>
interface (GUI) of the type well known in the programming arts, which is operatively<br>
coupled to the display and input device of the host computer or apparatus on which the<br>
program is run.<br>
       In terms of general structure, the program is comprised of a series of subroutines or<br>
algorithms for implementing the applanation and scaling methodologies described herein<br>
based on measured parametric data provided to the host apparatus 600. Specifically, the<br><br>
computer program comprises tin assembly language/micro-coded instruction set disposed<br>
within the embedded storage device, i.e. program memory, of the digital processor or<br>
microprocessor associated with the hemodynamic measurement apparatus 600. This latter<br>
embodiment provides the advantage of compactness in that it obviates the need for a stand-<br>
alone PC or similar hardware to implement the program's functionality. Such compactness is<br>
highly desirable in the clinical and home settings, where space (and ease of operation) are at<br>
a premium.<br>
       As previously noted, one of the significant advantages of the present invention relates<br>
to its flexibility; i.e., that it is essentially agnostic to the hardware/firmware/software on<br>
which it is used, and can be readily adapted to various different platforms or systems for<br>
measuring hemodynamic or other physiologic parameters. For example, the methods and<br>
apparatus of the present invention are substantially compatible with, inter alia, those<br>
described in: co-pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/393,660 "Method and<br>
Apparatus for Control of Non-fnvasive Parameter Measurements" filed Mar. 20, 2003; co-<br>
pending U.S. patent application Ser. No. 10/269,801 entitled "Apparatus and Methods for<br>
Non-lnvasively Measuring Hemodynamic Parameters" filed Oct. 11, 2002;co-pending U.S.<br>
patent application Ser. No. 10/920,990 entitled "Apparatus and Methods for Non-lnvasively<br>
Measuring Hemodynamic Parameters" filed Aug. 18, 2004; co-pending U.S. patent<br>
application Ser. No. TBD entitled "Apparatus and Methods for Non-lnvasively Measuring<br>
Hemodynamic Parameters" filed Jan. 20, 2006; co-pending U.S. Patent No. 6,554,774<br>
entitled "Method and Apparatus for Assessing Hemodynamic Parameters within the<br>
Circulatory System of a Living Subject" issued Apr. 29, 2003, each of the foregoing<br>
assigned to the Assignee hereof and incorporated by reference herein in its entirety.<br>
       It is noted that many variations of the methods described above may be utilized<br>
consistent with the present invention. Specifically, certain steps are optional and may be<br>
performed or deleted as desired. Similarly, other steps (such as additional data sampling,<br>
processing, filtration, calibration, or mathematical analysis for example) may be added to the<br>
foregoing embodiments. Additionally, the order of performance of certain steps may be<br>
permuted, or performed in parallel (or series) if desired. Hence, the foregoing embodiments<br>
are merely illustrative of the broader methods of the invention disclosed herein.<br>
       While the above detailed description has shown, described, and pointed out novel<br>
features of the invention as applied to various embodiments, it will be understood mat various<br>
omissions, substitutions, and changes in the form and details of the device or process illustrated<br>
may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit of the invention. The<br>
foregoing description is of the best mode presently contemplated of carrying out the invention.<br><br>
This description is in no way meant to be limiting, but rather should be taken as illustrative of<br>
the general principles of the invention. The scope of the invention should be determined with<br>
reference to the claims.<br><br>
