GUJARAT STATE, INDIA.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
This invention relates to system for housing construction using prefabricated components. This invention particularly relates to a system for housing construction using prefabricated components which offers various necessary and ample components to erect a construction.<br>
The present invention is introduced to unravel the problems associated with construction industry. Since beginning of civilization man has been continuously attempting to create a shelter that would provide him protection against devastating forces of the nature. Initially the stone, wood, leaves etc. were used. Gradually mankind started using mud, bricks, cement, concrete etc. but this traditional and so far contemporary method involves innumerable problems during construction process. Such as,<br>
1.	The dead load of the building resulting by the conventional method of construction is very high which limits the load bearing capacity of building with prefixed safety factor.<br>
2.	The traditional method of construction is labour intensive and calls for higher financial resources yet does not even provide consistent quality.<br>
3.	The laborers have their limitations and they may fall to meet the time limits.<br>
4.	In the traditional labour involved method, as the quality of workmanship    differs    from    person    to    person,    quality<br>
2<br><br>
standardization can not be achieved. Moreover, the wastage of materials is considerably high while handling and utilizing them manually.<br>
5.	The requirement on the construction sight such as, electricity, water supply, continuous transportation facility for raw material, residences for labours etc. is very high and costly especially in the case of remote area. In this type of circumstances slow and time consuming traditional process makes the cost of construction very high.<br>
6.	Expansion and renovation of the buildings made by the conventional process is very costly, time consuming, cumbersome and sometime not practicable.<br>
7.	The traditional method does not provide enough strength to the construction so that it can withstand against natural calamities such as tremors, earthquakes etc.<br>
8.	The conventional method which uses solid walls of bricks does not keep cool in summer and warm in winter.<br>
9.	The cost involved in some common steps for different sizes of construction such as constructing foundation, slab etc. remain same and very high. Thus this method is not feasible for small scale construction.<br>

Description of the Invention:<br>
This   invention   will   now   be   described   with   reference   to<br>
accompanying drawings where in:<br>

Fig. U shows connection details at various level of construction.<br>
Fig. V, W, X, Y and Z show connection details below plinth level, between two wall units, at plinth level, between two columns and at roofing level.<br>
Fig. Zl shows cross sectional details of connections.<br>
Fig. Z2 shows front view of construction in respect of plans as shown in fig. P, Q, R, S and T.<br>
Fig. Z3 shows 3-D view of installed prefabricated components of housing construction system.<br>
The invention can be broadly divided in three levels:<br>
1)	Foundation Level<br>
2)	Walling Level<br>
3)	Flooring and Roofing Level<br>
7<br><br>
The prefabricated components used at Foundation level are footing (1), column (5), pedestal (8) and solid wall panel (10) as shown in Fig. A, B, C and D respectively. To distribute the load from column (5) to greater area of soil wider footing (1) is designed as shown in fig. A. The weight of footing (1) is optimized without compromising the strength by providing concrete ribs (4) on thin concrete slab. Nut (37) acting as reinforcement, is inserted between periphery holes (3) of footing (1) to keep the bending and shear stresses within permissible limits. Pedestal (8) is Inserted in axial hole (2) of footing (1). Column (5) is placed on pedestal (8) which is tied together with the help of clip (30). Dimensions of groove (7) of column (5) and projection (11) of Solid wall panel (10) are designed in such a way that solid wall panel (10) can be easily inserted and firmly fixed to the column (5). Pedestal (8) is anchored adequately by clip (30) to both upper and lower elements to prevent segregation due to soil movement. As the concrete is not suitable element for tensile stress, enough tensile and bending strength is provided to column (5) and pedestal (8) by inserting a steel bar (32) inside the axial hole (6) and axial hole (9) of the column (5) and pedestal (8) accordingly. Afterwards the steel bar (32) is grouted by concrete to act monolithic with the outer shell of concrete. The connections between components of foundation level are shown in Fig. V and Z1.<br>
8<br><br>
The prefabricated components used at Walling level are column (5), capital (12), Tie Beam (20) and hollow wall block (23). In this invention, the walling unit is a prefabricated hollow block (23) instead of solid brick. As normally the wall does not carry any load, it is useless to make it solid as made in traditional systems. Moreover, brick wall also increases the dead load of the system. The hollow wall block (23) as shown In the fig. H has lesser weight than brick yet more strength as it is made up of concrete. The hollow wall blocks (23) are inserted into columns (5). These consecutive wall blocks are bonded to one another using cement mortar mixture as shown in fig. W. Moreover, consecutive columns are fixed using cement mortar mixture as shown in fig. Y. Capita! CI (12) and Capital C2 (16) are connector unit designed for flexibility in connection of column units (5) with Tie-beams (20), beams (24). Capital CI (12) and Capital C2 (16) have central core matching the column section and projection in one to four sides to receive other elements in the desired direction. Capital CI (12) and Capital C2 (16) comprise of external connection holes (15) and external connection holes (19) respectively to connect additional components like weather sheds (28) etc. Tie beam (20) is used to provide adequate tying of structure at different levels such as flooring level, lintel level etc as shown in Fig. X and Zl. The H -shaped Tie - Beam (20) is hollow which allows passing the reinforcement steel bars (32) through it. These bars (32) are anchored in the column units (5) as shown in Fig. X and finally<br>
9<br><br>
embedded within cement mortar. As shown in Fig. X, the steel bar (32) is inserted through tie-beam (20) and capital (12) for providing required tensile and bending strength.<br>
The prefabricated components used at flooring and roofing level are beam (24), slabs (25) and chicken mesh (26) as shown in fig. I, 3 and K respectively..Slab units (25) are solid in structure and made up of cement concrete with adequate reinforcement as per standards depending up on the requirement. Beams (24) are used to support the slab units (25) and transfer the dead and live load to the column units (5). Beams (24) are of T- shape with end portion designed such that it can provide suitable connection with the capital CI (12) and capital C2 (16). Beams may be used of different lengths to opt for flexible room dimensions. Slab units (25) of shape cuboids are placed over beam (24) to cover the space of the floor area. Finally a layer of chicken mesh (26) is laid for sealing the joints and serving as backing for flooring as shown in fig. Z. Slab units (25) are reinforced to avoid cracking.<br>
The components used at parapet level are parapet block (31) and column (5) as shown in fig. O and fig. D respectively. The column units (5) are extended from roofing level to parapet level in which parapet blocks (31) are inserted horizontally which are further bonded with cement mortar mixture.<br>
10<br><br>
Fig.Z3 clearly shows how different components are placed at different levels and how the different components are connected as explained earlier.<br>
