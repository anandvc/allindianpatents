CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This is a continuation of Ser. No. 09/386,548 filed August 30, 1999.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates generally to fluid ejection devices. In particular,<br>
the invention relates to fluid ejection device controlled by electrically isolated<br>
primitives.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The art of inkjet printing technology is relatively well developed. Commercial<br>
products such as computer printers, graphics plotters, copiers, and facsimile machines<br>
successfully employ inkjet technology for producing hard copy printed output. The<br>
basics of the technology have been disclosed in various articles in the Hewlett-Packard<br>
Journal, Vol. 36, No. 5 (May 1985), Vol. 39, No. 4 (August 1988), Vol. 39, No. 5<br>
(October 1988), Vol. 43, No. 4 (August 1992), Vol. 43, No. 6 (December 1992) and<br>
Vol. 45, No. 1 (February 1994) editions. Inkjet devices have also been described by<br>
W.J. Lloyd and H.T. Taub in Output Hardcopy Devices (R.C. Durbeck and S. Sherr, ed.,<br>
Academic Press, San Diego, 1988, chapter 13).<br><br>
A thermal inkjet printer for inkjet printing typically includes one or more<br>
translationally reciprocating print cartridges in which small drops of ink, are ejected by<br>
thermal energy from a drop generator, towards a medium upon which it is desired to<br>
place alphanumeric characters, graphics, or images. Such cartridges typically include a<br>
print head having an orifice member or plate that has a plurality of small nozzles<br>
through which the ink drops are ejected. Beneath the nozzles are ink firing chambers,<br>
which are enclosures in which ink resides prior to ejection through a nozzle. Ink is<br>
supplied to the ink firing chambers through ink channels that are in fluid communication<br>
with an ink reservoir, which may be contained in a reservoir portion of the print<br>
cartridge or in a separate ink container spaced apart from the print head.<br>
Ink drop ejection through a nozzle employed in a thermal inkjet printer is<br>
accomplished by quickly heating the volume of ink residing within the ink firing<br>
chamber with a selectively energizing electrical pulse to a heater resistor ink ejector<br>
positioned in the ink firing chamber. At the commencement of the heat energy output<br>
from the heater resistor, an ink vapor bubble nucleates at sites on the surface of the<br>
heater resistor or its protective layers. The rapid expansion of the ink vapor bubble<br>
forces the liquid ink through the nozzle. Once the electrical pulse ends and an ink drop<br>
is ejected, the ink firing chamber refills with ink from the ink channel and ink reservoir.<br>
Thermal inkjet ink can be corrosive. Prolonged exposure of electrical<br>
interconnections of an ink cartridge to the ink, will frequently result in a degradation<br>
and failure of the print head because the transistors that fire the heater resistors are<br>
effectively cut off from their source of power or from their control signals. In some<br>
print head designs, the transistors that fire the heater resistors are addressed (controlled)<br>
from a single electrical connector. If this one connector is electrically disabled because<br>
of chemical attack from the ink and its constituents, a large part (or all) of an ink<br>
cartridge can fail, adversely affecting print quality.<br>
The heater resistors of a conventional inkjet print head comprise a thin film<br>
resistive material deposited on an oxide layer of a semiconductor substrate. Electrical<br>
conductors are patterned over the oxide layer and provide an electrical path to and from<br>
each thin film heater resistor. Since the number of electrical conductors can become<br>
large when a large number of heater resistors are employed in a high density (high DPI<br>
- dots per inch) print head, various multiplexing techniques have been introduced to<br><br>
reduce the number of conductors utilized to connect the heater resistors to circuitry<br>
disposed in the printer. See, for example, United States Patent No. 5,541,629 "Print<br>
head with Reduced Interconnections to a Printer" and despite its good conductivity,<br>
imparts an undesirable amount of resistance in the path of the heater resistor.<br>
Individual transistors are typically addressed using combinations of electrical<br>
signals applied to the drain, source and gate terminals. These combinations of signals<br>
can effectively control when individual transistors will be in their "on" state, thereby<br>
allowing a droplet of ink to be ejected onto the print medium. Multiplexing the<br>
function of the various lines through the semiconductors allows a large number of<br>
individual transistors to be addressed using a relatively small number of address line<br>
conductors.<br>
Multiplexing techniques have helped reduce the total number of conductors<br>
utilized to energize the heater resistors. Notwithstanding the improvements in<br>
addressing, there remains a desire to reliably address each transistor to avoid<br>
catastrophic failure of a print head caused by a single fault on an address bus. In<br>
addition, there is a desire to provide printheads that have a flexibility to accept different<br>
input signal configurations.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
A fluid ejection device has a first set of primitives within a first region of a<br>
substrate of the device, and a second set of primitives within a second region of the<br>
substrate. The second set of primitives is electrically isolated from said first set of<br>
primitives. The number of primitives of said first set of primitives is different from the<br>
number of primitives of said second set of primitives.<br>
Many of the attendant features of this invention will be more readily appreciated<br>
as the same becomes better understood by reference to the following detailed<br>
description and considered in connection with the accompanying drawings in which like<br>
reference symbols designate like parts throughout.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
FIG. 1A is a block diagram of a printing system incorporating an embodiment of<br>
the present invention. The printing system 10 can be used for printing on any suitable<br>
material, such as paper media, transfer media, transparency media, photographic paper<br>
and the like. In general, the printing system communicates with a host system 12, which<br>
can be a computer or microprocessor that produces print data. The printing system 10<br><br>
includes a printer assembly 14, which controls the printing system, a print head<br>
assembly 16 that ejects ink and in some embodiments, a print head assembly transport<br>
device 18 that positions the print head assembly 16.<br>
The printer assembly 14 also includes a controller 20, a print media transport<br>
device 22 and a print media 24. The print media transport device 22 positions the print<br>
media 24 (such as paper) according the control instructions received from the controller<br>
20. The controller 20 provides control to the print media transport device 22, the print<br>
head assembly 16 and the print head assembly transport device 18 according to<br>
instructions received from various microprocessors within the printing system 10. In<br>
addition, the controller 20 receives the print data from the host system 12 and processes<br>
the print data into printer control information and image data. This printer control<br>
information and image data is used by the controller 20 to control the print media<br>
transport device 18, the print head assembly 16 and the print head assembly transport<br>
device 18. For example, the print head assembly transport device 18 positions the print<br>
head 30 over the print media 24 and the print head 30 is instructed to eject ink drops<br>
according to the printer control information and image data.<br>
The print head assembly 16 is preferably supported by a print head assembly<br>
transport device 18 that can position the print head assembly 16 over the print media 24.<br>
Preferably, the print head assembly 16 is capable of overlying any area of the print<br>
media 24 using the combination of the print head assembly transport device 18 and the<br>
print media transport device 22. For example, the print media 24 may be a rectangular<br>
sheet of paper and the print head assembly transport device 18 may position the paper in<br>
a media transport direction while the print head assembly transport device 18 may<br>
position the print head assembly 16 across the paper in a direction transverse to the<br>
media transport direction.<br>
The print head assembly 16 includes an ink supply device 26 that is fluidically<br>
coupled to the print head 30 for selectively providing ink to the print head 30. The print<br>
head 30 includes a plurality of ink drop delivery systems, such as an array of inkjet<br>
nozzles or drop generators. The ink jet nozzles are comprised of orifices through an<br>
orifice plate through which ink is ejected when the ink is heated to boiling. As discussed<br>
further below, each ink drop delivery system forms a printed image by ejecting droplets<br>
of ink onto the print media 24 according to instructions from the controller 20.<br><br>
FIG. 3 shows an isometric view of the top of a substrate 313 on which is formed<br>
a barrier layer 315 that is shaped to direct ink to flow through a passage 307 into an ink<br>
firing chamber 301. At the "bottom" of the ink firing chamber 301 is a thin film heater<br>
resistor 309 that is covered by a protective dielectric layer (not shown). When current is<br>
forced through the heater resistor 309, ink in the firing chamber 301 is boiled causing<br>
the ink to be expelled through an orifice 303 in the orifice plate or top plate 305 that is<br>
placed over the barrier layer 315. By capillary action, ink is retained in the firing<br>
chamber 301 until electrical current to the heater resistor heats the ink. The electrical<br>
current through the heater resistor therefore determines when ink is ejected from the<br>
orifice 303.<br>
Fig. 1B is a simplified block diagram depicting print head or substrate 30 of the<br>
present invention in greater detail. For the purposes of the illustrative example in FIG.<br>
1B, element 30 may be considered to be a semiconductor substrate such as a silicon<br>
substrate that incorporates inkjet drop generators and associated circuitry.<br>
Alternatively, element 30 can represent a combination of a rigid semiconductor<br>
substrate and a flexible circuit for carrying signals between a printing system and the<br>
drop generators on print head 30.<br>
Substrate 30 is divided into two regions, 30-1 and 30-2. Alternate embodiments<br>
of the invention disclosed herein would of course include a substrate divided into more<br>
than two regions. Each region shown in FIG. 1B contains a set of primitives.<br>
Hereinafter, a "primitive" is comprised of a collection of transistors (FETs) that are<br>
turned on (and off) by voltages applied to (or removed from) control lines coupled to the<br>
FETs. All of the FETs in a primitive typically have their drain (or source) terminals<br>
coupled to a common ground; all of these FETs typically have their sources (or drains)<br>
coupled to a power source through individual and corresponding thin film heater<br>
resistors on the surface of the substrate. The power is a "primitive select" signal on a<br>
"primitive select" line discussed below. Alternate embodiments would also include<br>
using unique grounds for the FETs. Each FET then has its gate coupled to an address<br>
line, the voltages of which control the FET individually. The FETs, heater resistors and<br>
"lines" to and from the FETs and external connection points (connectors) all are<br><br>
considered to be fabricated "on" the substrate 30. The "lines" are typically comprised<br>
of conductive traces fabricated on the substrate using appropriate semiconductor<br>
fabrication techniques.<br>
One of the control lines to the primitive is considered to be a primitive control<br>
line - not shown in FIG. 1B but shown in FIG. 4 as the primitive select lead 404. This<br>
primitive control line (404 in FIG. 4) applies V+ (or ground) to the source or drain<br>
terminals of the FETs in a primitive (through the heater resistor 400 in FIG. 4). The<br>
other control line of an FET in a primitive is an address line coupled to the FET's gate,<br>
identified in FIG. 4 by reference numeral 406. The gate of each FET of a primitive is<br>
coupled to a unique address line permitting the FETs of a primitive to be individually<br>
activated. When the primitive control line to a primitive is active (primitive select line<br>
404 in FIG. 4) and an address line (406 in FIG. 4) to a FET gate in the same primitive is<br>
active, that FET (402 in FIG. 4) will carry current through the corresponding heater<br>
resistor (400 in FIG. 4), causing ink to be ejected from the print head.<br>
The sequence of turning "on" and "off" the transistors is as follows. If a<br>
transistor is "on" and conducting current, and thereafter the address line on the gate is<br>
turned "off" prior to the primitive control line being turned "off" the transistor can be<br>
damaged by avalanche breakdown, as well as other semiconductor failures. In the<br>
preferred embodiment, the address line is turned "on" prior to the primitive control line<br>
being turned "on." The address line should stay "on" until after the primitive control<br>
line has been turned off to avoid semiconductor failures.<br>
FIG 4 shows a single FET switching device 402 of a "primitive" and which acts<br>
to control current flow through a heater resistor 400 used to eject ink onto a print<br>
medium. The FET 402 of FIG. 4 is but one transistor of several such devices that make<br>
up a "primitive." Several such FETs would be coupled together sharing a common<br>
ground and having their source coupled to V+ through a corresponding heater resistor.<br>
The relative direction and/or source of current through an FET is a design choice.<br>
Alternate embodiments would of course include coupling the FET source directly to V+<br>
with the FET drain coupled to ground through the heater resistor. Still other<br>
embodiments would include coupling the FET source to ground through the heater<br>
resistor and coupling the FET drain to a negative-polarity voltage.<br><br>
The address lead 406 corresponds to (and is connected to) the FET gate. In the<br>
embodiment shown, power is applied to the FET primitive select lead 404, which in turn<br>
is connected to the FET through the heater resistor 400. The ground connection 403<br>
provides the return path for current through the FET 402 such that when the gate is<br>
active and power is applied to the primitive select lead 404, current flows through the<br>
resistor, through the FET to ground. Only when both the primitive select and the<br>
address line on the gate are both active will the current flow through the resistor,<br>
through the FET to ground.<br>
In a print head "primitive," which is a group of FETs coupled to a primitive<br>
select lead 404 through separate heater resistors 400 on the substrate, all of the FETs<br>
have power applied to them simultaneously. The FETs in the group are all connected to<br>
the common ground but each of the FETs in the group has its gate 406 coupled to an<br>
address line. Individual FETs in a group or "primitive" can be fired separately if the<br>
FET's primitive select lead 404 and gate 406 are active at the same time. Accordingly,<br>
a combination of a primitive select lead 404 and an address select lead (gate) 406<br>
individually control each FET in a matrix fashion.<br>
An ink jet print head can be made more reliable when the several primitives on<br>
an ink jet print head substrate (which surround or are proximate to an ink aperture) are<br>
organized into groups or clusters and when these groups of primitives are addressed by<br>
electrically separate address and primitive control lines. In the preferred embodiment,<br>
the primitives on a substrate are divided in half along a line transverse to the ink<br>
aperture. Primitives on one side of this line are addressed by one address bus;<br>
primitives on the other side are addressed by a different address bus. A fault on one<br>
address bus will therefore not affect primitives controlled by the other address bus.<br>
Although the depiction of FIG. 1B shows only two primitives per region,<br>
alternate embodiments would include virtually any number of primitives on a substrate.<br>
Moreover, the primitives might be organized into more than two groups. Three or more<br>
groups might be controlled by three electrically separate address busses.<br>
Each primitive shown in FIG. 1B (P1 - P1') includes a plurality of heater<br>
resistors, also known in the art as drop generators D or D', and associated multiplexing<br>
circuitry M or M', including the FETs described above. The multiplexing circuitry<br>
receives signals from a plurality of power or primitive select or primitive control lines<br><br>
(not shown in FIG. 1B) and address select lines A or A'. The primitive control lines and<br>
the address lines together actuate the drop generators D or D' by firing the FETs, the<br>
current of which acts to eject droplets of ink during a printing operation. In order to<br>
properly activate a particular drop generator, a combination of a primitive select lines<br>
and an address select lines that is unique to that drop generator must be activated. A<br>
primitive select line connects to the source/drain of each transistor by way of the drop<br>
generator within the primitive associated with the primitive select line. An address<br>
select line 32 or 32' connects to the gate of one transistor in each of the primitives<br>
within region 30-1 or 30-2.<br>
It is well known in the art that the gate of an FET can control when the device<br>
conducts. Alternate embodiments of the invention would include using other types of<br>
three-terminal current switching elements besides FETs including, but not limited to<br>
devices such as bi-polar transistors, SCRs, TRIACs and the like. In the case of a bi-<br>
polar transistor for example, controlling the base voltage would control when the device<br>
conducts.<br>
FIG. 6A is a schematic plan view of a major surface of a three-color print head.<br>
In operation, yellow, magenta and cyan inks would flow upward, i.e. out of, the plane of<br>
the FIG. 6A through the ink apertures 670, 672 and 674 into firing chambers (shown in<br>
FIG. 3) distributed along both sides of the ink apertures 670, 672 and 674. Shaded,<br>
rectangular areas on opposite sides of the ink apertures (602, 604, 606, 608, 610, 612,<br>
614, 615, 616, 618, 620, and 622) denote primitives. (Not shown in FIG. 6A, but<br>
existent in a preferred embodiment are twelve (12) additional primitives, each of which<br>
is adjacent to the enumerated primitives that are shown and the ink apertures, so as to<br>
provide a total of 24 primitives on the substrate. Each of the ink apertures therefore has<br>
eight primitives adjacent to it. Each of the eight primitives is comprised of 18<br>
transistors.) As shown, the ink aperture 670 has four primitives 602, 604, 615 and 614<br>
that are located about the ink aperture 670. One primitive, 615, schematically depicts<br>
the several FETs and heater resistors connected to them, proximate to one end and<br>
adjacent to one side of the ink aperture 670.<br>
Each of the FETs of the primitive 615 is coupled to a ground bus 630<br>
represented by a heavy line that can be seen on each of the primitive areas shown in the<br>
figure (602, 604, 606, 608, 610, 612, 614, 615, 616, 618, 620, and 622).<br><br>
A first address bus 640 is comprised of several conductors (individual<br>
conductors not shown), at least one of which is extended to each gate of each FET in the<br>
first set of primitives shown (614, 615, 616, 618, 620, and 622) in the upper or top<br>
portion of the substrate 600 shown in FIG. 6A. A second address bus 650 is comprised<br>
of several conductors (individual conductors not shown) at least one of which is<br>
extended to each gate of each FET in the primitives shown (602, 604, 606, 608, 610,<br>
612) of a second set of primitives along the lower portion of the substrate 600 shown in<br>
FIG. 6A. The first and second address busses 640 and 650 are electrically isolated from<br>
each other but are accessible from the connectors 660 and 662 on the edges of the<br>
substrate 600.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, each FET of a primitive has its gate terminal<br>
coupled to an address line 642. There are therefore a number of address lines "N" in an<br>
address bus 640, 650 that is equal to the number of drop generators (and FETs) in each<br>
of the primitives shown (602, 604, 606,608, 610, 612, 614, 615, 616, 618, 620, and<br>
622). The address lines to the gates of the FETs of one set of primitives shown (602,<br>
604, 606, 608, 610, 612) are electrically isolated from the gates of the FETs of the other<br>
set of primitives shown (614, 615, 616, 618, 620, and 622). (In an alternate<br>
embodiment, the two sets of address lines may be indirectly or directly coupled<br>
together.) The FETs in any set of primitives will not fire if those FETs are deactivated<br>
by their corresponding primitive control lines, depicted in FIG. 6A as the "P" lines 690.<br>
The address lines are therefore effectively multiplexed to reduce the number of address<br>
lines utilized to control numerous transistors in several primitives while allowing for<br>
individual selectability (addressability) of the drop generators. The only exception to<br>
this would be if one or more truncated primitives P (with less than N drop generators) is<br>
utilized. During a printing operation, the printing system cycles through the address<br>
lines such that only one of the address lines A1 through AN is activated at a time. (See<br>
FIG. 6B.) Thus, within a primitive, only one drop generator can be activated at a time.<br>
However, all of the drop generators in the various primitives associated with a particular<br>
address can be fired simultaneously.<br>
Referring back to FIG. 1B, each of the two regions 30-1 and 30-2 has its own set<br>
of separate address lines that control the firing of FETs in the corresponding region and<br>
which are preferably electrically isolated from each other so as avoid a fault on one line<br><br>
affecting all of the primitives that it is connected to. Thus, region 30-1 has a first set of<br>
address lines A1, A2,...,AN, terminating on the substrate in a set of address pads 32.<br>
Region 30-2 has a second set of addresses A1',A2',...,AN', separate from the first set<br>
and terminating in a separate set of address pads 32'.<br>
As suggested earlier, one embodiment of print head 30 may be a combination of<br>
a silicon substrate and a flexible substrate.<br>
In a first embodiment, the address pads 32 represent flexible circuit connections<br>
that connect to electronics in the printer assembly 14 when the print head assembly 16 is<br>
installed into printer assembly 14. Alternatively, in a second embodiment, the address<br>
pads 32 represent the bond pads on a silicon substrate. Intermediary circuitry such as a<br>
flexible circuit can be used to connect the bond pads to circuitry in printer assembly 14.<br>
One method for connection to such bond pads is known in the art as TAB bonding, or<br>
tape automated bonding.<br>
In a third embodiment, the number of addresses A1,A2,.. .,AN in region 30-1 is<br>
equal to the number of addresses A1',A2',...,AN' in region 30-2 (although alternate<br>
embodiments would include using different numbers of address lines in each region.) In<br>
the third embodiment, jumpers or conductive traces on print head 30 or a flexible circuit<br>
attached to the print head 30 electrically connect the address A1 to address A1', address<br>
A2 to address A2',...,address AN to AN', etc. Thus, whenever address A is activated in<br>
section 30-1, a corresponding address A' is activated in section 30-2. By providing<br>
these separate connections for each address pair A and A', the crucial address<br>
connections are maintained even if a connection to one of them is lost. This assures that<br>
the proper signals are provided to print head 30 even if one of the address connections to<br>
print head 30 is lost.<br>
In a fourth embodiment, the addresses in the sections 30-1 and 30-2 are<br>
electrically isolated. This allows the printer assembly to operate the print head in two<br>
modes. The printer can activate pairs of addresses A and A' simultaneously, allowing<br>
for a higher printer speed. One way to do this is might include having the printer<br>
assembly circuitry electrically couple the address lines in pairs. Alternatively, the<br>
printer can operate the addresses A and A' independently while combining primitives<br>
between region 30-1 and 30-2 in pairs. This lowers printer cost, but sacrifices speed.<br><br>
An exemplary inkjet printing apparatus, a printer 101, that may employ the<br>
present invention is shown in outline form in the isometric drawing of FIG. 2A.<br>
Printing devices such as graphics plotters, copiers, and facsimile machines may also<br>
profitably employ the present invention. A printer housing 103 contains a printing<br>
platen to which an input print medium 105, such as paper, is transported by mechanisms<br>
that are known in the art. A carriage within the printer 101 holds one or a set of<br>
individual print cartridges capable of ejecting ink drops of black or color ink.<br>
Alternative embodiments can include a semi-permanent print head mechanism that is<br>
sporadically replenished from one or more fluidically-coupled off-axis ink reservoirs, or<br>
a single print cartridge having two or more colors of ink available within the print<br>
cartridge and ink ejecting nozzles designated for each color, or a single color print<br>
cartridge or print mechanism; the present invention is applicable to a print head<br>
employed by at least these alternatives. A carriage 109, which may be employed in the<br>
present invention and mounts two print cartridges 110 and 111, is illustrated in FIG. 2B.<br>
The carriage 109 is typically supported by a slide bar or similar mechanism within the<br>
printer and physically propelled along the slide bar to allow the carriage 109 to be<br>
translationally reciprocated or scanned back and forth across the print medium 105. The<br>
scan axis, X, is indicated by an arrow in FIG. 2A. As the carriage 109 scans, ink drops<br>
are selectively ejected from the print heads of the set of print cartridges 110 and 111<br>
onto the medium 105 in predetermined print swatch patterns, forming images or<br>
alphanumeric characters using dot matrix manipulation. Conventionally, the dot matrix<br>
manipulation is determined by a user's computer (not shown) and instructions are<br>
transmitted to a microprocessor-based, electronic controller within the printer 101.<br>
Other techniques of dot matrix manipulation are accomplished by the computer's<br>
rasterizing the data then sending the rasterized data as well as print commands to the<br>
printer. The printer interprets the commands and rasterized information to determine<br>
which drop generators to fire.<br>
As can be seen in FIG. 2C, a single medium sheet is advanced from an input tray<br>
into a printer print area beneath the print heads by a medium advancing mechanism<br>
including a roller 207, a platen motor 209, and traction devices (not shown). In a<br>
preferred embodiment, the inkjet print cartridges 110, 111 are incrementally drawn<br>
across the medium 105 on the platen by a carriage motor 211 in the X direction,<br><br>
perpendicular to the Y direction of entry of the medium. The platen motor 209 and the<br>
carriage motor 211 are typically under the control of a media and cartridge position<br>
controller 213. An example of such positioning and control apparatus may be found<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,070,410 "Apparatus and Method Using a Combined<br>
Read/Write Head for Processing and Storing Read Signals and for Providing Firing<br>
Signals to Thermally Actuated Ink Ejection Elements". Thus, the medium 105 is<br>
positioned in a location so that the print cartridges 110 and 111 may eject drops of ink to<br>
place dots on the medium as instructed by the data that is input to a drop firing<br>
controller 215 and power supply 217 of the printer. These dots of ink are formed from<br>
the ink drops expelled from the selected orifices in the print head in a band parallel to<br>
the scan direction as the print cartridges 110 and 111 are translated across the medium<br>
by the carriage motor 211. When the print cartridges 110 and 111 reach the end of their<br>
travel at an end of a print swath on the medium 105, the medium is conventionally<br>
incrementally advanced by the position controller 213 and the platen motor 209. Once<br>
the print cartridges have reached the end of their traverse in the X direction on the slide<br>
bar, they are either returned back along the support mechanism while continuing to print<br>
or returned without printing. The medium may be advanced by an incremental amount<br>
equivalent to the width of the ink ejecting portion of the print head or some fraction<br>
thereof related to the spacing between the nozzles. Control of the medium, positioning<br>
of the print cartridge, and selection of the correct ink ejectors for creation of an ink<br>
image or character is determined by the position controller 213. The controller may be<br>
implemented in a conventional electronic hardware configuration and provided<br>
operating instructions from memory 216. Once printing of the medium is complete, the<br>
medium is ejected into an output tray of the printer for user removal.<br>
A single example of an ink drop generator found within a print head is illustrated<br>
in the magnified isometric cross section of FIG. 3. As depicted, the drop generator<br>
comprises a nozzle, a firing chamber, and an ink ejector. Alternative embodiments of a<br>
drop generator employ more than one coordinated nozzle, firing chamber, and/or ink<br>
ejectors. The drop generator is fluidically coupled to a source of ink.<br>
In FIG. 3, the preferred embodiment of an ink firing chamber 301 is shown in<br>
correspondence with a nozzle 303 and a segmented heater resistor or firing resistor 309.<br>
Many independent nozzles are typically arranged in a predetermined pattern on the<br><br>
orifice plate 305 so that the ink drops are expelled in a controlled pattern. Generally, the<br>
medium is maintained in a position which is parallel to the plane of the external surface<br>
of the orifice plate. The heater resistors are selected for activation in a process that<br>
involves the data input from an external computer or other data source coupled to the<br>
printer in association with the drop firing controller 215 and power supply 217. Ink is<br>
supplied to the firing chamber 301 via opening 307 to replenish ink that has been<br>
expelled from orifice 303 following the creation of an ink vapor bubble by heat energy<br>
released from the segmented heater resistor 309. The ink firing chamber 301 is bounded<br>
by walls created by the orifice plate 305, a layered semiconductor substrate 313, and<br>
barrier layer 315. In a preferred embodiment, fluid ink stored in a reservoir of the<br>
cartridge housing flows by capillary force to fill the firing chamber 301.<br>
A more-reliable ink jet print head of the present invention includes a substrate<br>
that supports heater resistors that provide heat pulses for ejecting droplets of ink onto a<br>
medium. As depicted schematically by Fig. 4, each heater resistor 400 is individually<br>
controlled by a separate switching device 402, which is preferably a field effect<br>
transistor, or FET. Each switching device 402 has a primitive select lead 404 for<br>
transmitting power, and an address select lead 406 for opening and closing the switching<br>
device 402 through the FET gate to allow current to flow through the resistor 400.<br>
Thus, in order to heat a particular resistor 400, the particular resistor's associated<br>
switching device 402 must have its primitive lead 404 and address lead 406 active<br>
concurrently.<br>
In the print head of the present invention, the resistors and associated FETs<br>
coupled to the resistors are arranged into groupings called primitives. There are several<br>
primitives on each substrate. Each primitive has a separate single primitive select lead<br>
that provides power to all of the resistors in the primitive. Each primitive has a ground<br>
lead coupled to the ground connections of every switching device in the primitive. To<br>
reduce the number of connections to connect to the substrate, the same ground lead can<br>
be coupled to multiple primitives.<br>
Each switching device (FET or other transistor device) within a particular<br>
primitive is coupled to an independent or separately energizable address select lead.<br>
During operation, the address leads are actuated one at a time in a sequence such that<br><br>
only a single switching device in a primitive is actuated at a time. To reduce the number<br>
of connections to the substrate, address lines are shared between primitives.<br>
The substrate of the present invention is divided into various topographic regions<br>
that each contain at least one primitive. Within each region, the address lines are<br>
shared; each primitive has its own unique primitive select line. Alternate embodiments<br>
however might provide each region on the die with its own separate set of address lines.<br>
A schematic diagram of the present invention is illustrated in FIG. 5A. A<br>
substrate 500 has three ink feed slots or ink apertures 502 through which ink from an ink<br>
reservoir feeds to firing resistors adjacent to the feed slots. Alternate embodiments<br>
would include substrates providing only a single-color aperture or other colors as well.<br>
There are three ink feed slots, one slot 502Y providing yellow, one slot 502M providing<br>
magenta, and one slot 502C providing cyan ink to the resistors. (The yellow feed slot<br>
502Y, shown greatly enlarged along with a few firing resistors numbered 1-5, is<br>
depicted in FIG. 5B) The resistors are arranged into 24 primitives along the feed slots<br>
502, indicated in the figure by the numbers 1-24. For example, along the ink feed slot<br>
providing yellow ink, primitives 2, 4, 6, and 8 are arranged along one side of the feed<br>
slot, and primitives 1, 3, 5, and 7 are arranged along an opposing edge of the feed slot<br>
502Y.<br>
In the preferred embodiment, each primitive includes 18 firing resistors (with<br>
each coupled to a separate current-controlling FET) with a single primitive select line<br>
shared between the 18 resistors within each primitive. Alternate embodiments would of<br>
course include larger as well as smaller numbers of firing resistors and transistors per<br>
primitive. Thus, for the substrate of the present invention, there are 24 independent<br>
primitive select lines PS1 to PS24 (only PS4 and PS2 shown) corresponding to the 24<br>
primitives.<br>
Each primitive select line routes to a connector pad located along one of two<br>
outer edges 504N or 504S of the substrate. In order for each resistor within a particular<br>
primitive to be separately energized, each resistor is connected to a current-controlling<br>
transistor, each having a separate address line (not shown).<br>
During a printing operation, the printer cycles through the addresses as depicted<br>
in FIG. 6B such that only a single one of the 18 firing resistors within a particular<br>
primitive is operated at a time, i.e. sequentially. However, resistors in different<br><br>
primitives may be operated simultaneously. For this reason, and to minimize a number<br>
of contacts, primitives share address lines. Thus, for a given set of primitives sharing<br>
address lines, there are 18 address lines to allow for independent operation of addresses<br>
for a particular primitive.<br>
To improve reliability and to allow multiple modes of operation, the primitives<br>
of the substrate are segregated into groups. One group of primitives is addressed by a<br>
first set of address lines for the primitives in the group. A second group of primitives is<br>
addressed by a separate set of address lines for the second group. The two groups of<br>
primitives are divided into regions that are designated as north 500N and south 500S for<br>
purposes of identification. In this example, half of the primitives are contained in region<br>
500N closest to substrate edge 504N. The other half of the primitives are contained in<br>
region 500S closest to the substrate edge 504S. Alternate embodiments include dividing<br>
the primitives in uneven groups spread across the substrate in any ratio.<br>
One set of 18 address select lines, referred to as A1N, A2N,... ,A18N, provide<br>
address select signals to the switching devices in the region 500N. Another set of 18<br>
address select lines, referred to as A1S, A2S, ...A18S provide address select signals to<br>
the switching devices in the region 504S.<br>
Providing separate north and south (or upper and lower) address leads to the<br>
transistors in the primitives in the north and south regions provides several benefits.<br>
First, the susceptibility to losing an address connection is reduced by one half. Second,<br>
by having independent sets of address leads for the separate groups of primitives,<br>
multiple firing modes are enabled for the same print head. As discussed before, print<br>
heads are operated by cycling through address lines as is indicated by Fig. 6B. By<br>
having north and south primitives, the print head can be operated as having either 24 or<br>
having 12 primitives.<br>
Address pairs of the north and south groups can be electrically or functionally<br>
"tied" together by appropriate circuitry so that combinations of transistors in any<br>
combination of groups can be fired together. In one such embodiment, each time a<br>
particular north address is activated (for example A1N), the corresponding south address<br>
is simultaneously activated (for example, A1S). This can be done by making A1N<br>
electrically common with A1S, A2N electrically common with A2S, etc. using any<br><br>
appropriate circuitry. This allows for higher speed or higher frequency printing,<br>
because it takes less time to cycle through the addresses (again view FIG. 6B).<br>
On the other hand, the print head can also be operated as having 12 primitives.<br>
This can be done by serially cycling through all of the south addresses and then all of<br>
the north addresses. Although slower, this provides the opportunity to make pairs of<br>
primitive select lines electrically common but keeping the address lines electrically<br>
isolated. This reduces the cost of the switching electronics utilized to energize the<br>
primitives, reducing the cost of the printing system.<br>
It should be recognized that in addition to the thermal inkjet embodiment<br>
described above, this invention is also applicable to alternative drop formation<br>
technologies including, for example, medical devices.<br>
In sum, a print head for an inkjet printer includes a substrate upon which is<br>
disposed a plurality of heater resistors. The heater resistors are electrically ordered into<br>
a first group and a second group; they are physically arranged about the opposing sides<br>
of an elongated slot (an ink aperture) through which ink flows from an ink reservoir to<br>
ink firing chambers of the ink jet print head. The resistors are heated by electrical<br>
current that is directed by switching devices such as three-terminal current switching<br>
field-effect transistors or FETs. Electrical control signals to the various FETs (which<br>
allow the heater resistors to be energized) are coupled into the print head using two (2)<br>
connectors on opposites of the substrate.<br>
One electrical connector disposed on a first side of the substrate is provided with<br>
electrical paths between the contacts of the connector and the gate inputs of the various<br>
firing transistors that are electrically coupled to only a first group of ink firing elements<br>
(resistors) that coincidentally are proximate to a first portion of the ink aperture. A<br>
second electrical connector disposed on a second side of the substrate that is opposite<br>
the first side, is provided with electrical paths between the second connector and the<br>
gate inputs of a second group of transistors that are used to fire a second group of heater<br>
resistors.<br>
Stated alternatively, the control inputs for the several transistors are divided into two<br>
groups where each group is electrically coupled to one of two edge connectors. A fault<br>
on one of the address lines controlling one of the transistors will disable only that<br>
transistor or other transistors coupled to that same address line. The control signals<br><br>
from the other connector, which are electrically isolated from the first connector, are not<br>
affected by ground (or other) faults adversely affecting signals on the opposite<br>
connector. Using two edge connectors to control inputs to the transistors significantly<br>
increases the print head reliability in that functionality of at least some of the ink<br>
ejectors is retained, even if a group of other ink ejectors is disabled.<br>
While the present invention has been disclosed with reference to the foregoing<br>
specification and the preferred embodiment shown in the drawings and described above,<br>
it will be apparent to those skilled in the art that changes in form and detail may be<br>
