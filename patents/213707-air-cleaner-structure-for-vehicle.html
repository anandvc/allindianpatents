COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"AIR CLEANER STRUCTURE FOR VEHICLE"<br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA., a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
preferable for extending the exchange interval of an air filter element, in order to provide a passage for an oil or the like in an air cleaner.<br>
[0002]<br>
[Prior Art]<br>
As an air cleaner structure for a vehicle comprising a breather device for refluxing a blow-by gas from a crankcase of an engine to an air cleaner, there has been known, for example, "Blow-by Gas Reflux Device for Multicylinder Engine"that which is described in Japanese Pre-examination Patent Publication (KOKAI) No. 7-119431 (1995) .<br>
[0003]<br>
The art of the above-mentioned publication, as shown in FIGS. 1 and 3 of the publication, resides in that a chamber 83 (The symbols used in the publication are used.) is formed by fitting a cover plate 79 to a front wall 74 of a front case 67 in a cleaner case 63 of an air cleaner 28 by a plurality of bolts 81, an intake tube 84 connected to a crankcase is connected to the chamber 83 to thereby communicate between the crankcase and the chamber 83, an oil mist flowing from the crankcase into the chamber 83 is discharged to the side of an element 64 through a communication hole 82 provided<br><br>
in a cover plate 79, and a water discharge hole 88 is provided at a lower portion of the chamber 83 to thereby discharge water and oil in the chamber 83 into the water discharge hole 88.<br>
[0004]<br>
[Problems to be solved by the Invention]<br>
According to the art of the above-mentioned publication, the oil separated in the chamber 83 by forming the chamber 83 is discharged by using the lower surface of the chamber 83 as an oil passage, so that formation of the chamber 83 as the oil passage needs the cover plate 79, the bolts 81, female screws for screwing the bolts 81, and boss portions for forming the female screws, and, therefore, the number of component parts is large, and structure is complicated.  Therefore, a large number of assembly steps are needed.<br>
[0005]<br>
In addition, since the communication hole 82 communicating from the chamber 83 into the clean side of<br>
the air cleaner 28 is provided in the vicinity of the<br>
lower surface of the front case 67, the oil mist contained in the blow-by gass flowing through the communication hole 82 into the clean side flows to the side of the element 64 under the flow of air on the upper<br><br>
side in the clean side to adhere to the element 64, thereby presumably shortening the exchange interval of the element 64.<br>
[0006]<br>
Accordingly, it is an object of the present invention to simplify structure, reduce the number of component parts, facilitate assembly and prolong the exchange interval of an air filter element, in order to provide a passage for an oil or the like in an air cleaner, in an air cleaner structure for vehicle.<br>
[0007]<br>
[Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
In order to attain the above object, claim 1 is characterized in that, in a vehicle comprising an engine breather device for communication between a crankcase of an engine and an air cleaner by a piping, an air filter element is disposed at a predetermined upward spacing from a bottom surface of an air cleaner case faced to the inside of a clean side of the air cleaner, a passage is formed by surrounding with a lower surface of the air filter element, the bottom surface of the air cleaner case and two side walls of the air cleaner case, and a discharge port is provided at an end portion of the passage.<br><br>
[0008]<br>
The passage is formed in the inside of the clean side by the lower surface of the air filter element, the bottom surface of the air cleaner case and the two side walls of the air cleaner case, and the oil or the like is caused to flow through the passage to the discharge port, whereby the oil or the like can be discharged with a simple structure without forming a special passage in the air cleaner case. [0009]<br>
Besides, since it is needless to provide a chamber as in the conventional art, there is no need for bolts or a partition wall, the number of component parts can be reduced, and production cost can be reduced.<br>
In addition, fastening bolts for forming the chamber is unnecessary, the number of assembly steps can be reduced, assembly is facilitated^ and assembly cost can be reduced. [0010]<br>
Further, when the bottom surface of the air cleaner case is spaced by a sufficient distance downwards from the air filter element so that the oil flowing on the bottom surface of the air cleaner case does not adhere to the air filter element, the air filter element would not<br><br><br>
be stained with the oil or the like, and the exchange interval of the air filter element can be prolonged.<br>

[0030]<br>
With such a constitution as above, air taken in from the above-mentioned intake-side tube into the second chamber 102 is filtered by an air filter not shown, the flow of the filtered air is controlled by opening and closing a secondary air control valve, and, when the secondary air control valve is opened, air is supplied to the exhaust port 71 through the reed valve to oxidize<br><br>
unburned gas in the exhaust gas, thereby cleaning the exhaust gas, and the cleaned exhaust gas is discharged to the exterior.<br>
The opening and closing of the secondary air control valve are performed by utilizing a negative pressure in the intake pipe 15. [0031]<br>
Symbol 111 denotes an endless form first seal member surrounding the first partition portion 96, 112 denotes a second seal member surrounding a part of the . second partition portion 97, and the first seal member<br>

[0033]<br>
FIG. 8 is a sectional view taken along line 8-8 of FIG. 6, and shows that the case main body 81 is provided with a recessed portion 81p recessed more to the inside of the vehicle body (in the direction of arrow "in") than the second bottom surface 81e, and an oil discharge port 81q is provided on the rear side of the recessed portion 81p.<br>
The discharge port 81q is for connecting the drain tube 68. [0034]<br>
FIG. 9 is a side view of a rear portion of a vehicle for illustrating the drain tube fitted to a rear portion of the air cleaner according to the present<br><br>
invention, and shows that an end portion of the drain tube 68 is fitted to the rear end of the power unit 12 by a clip 117, and the tip end of the drain tube 68 is closed with a plug 118.  Symbol 121 denotes a band for fixing the plug 118 to the drain tube 68. [0035]<br>
Action or effect of the air cleaner structure described above will be described below.<br>
FIG. 10 is an action view for illustrating the action or effect of the air cleaner structure according to the present invention.<br>
The air cleaner 18 is so constructed that, as indicated by void arrows a to d, outside air is sucked in from the intake port 78 through an intake duct into the dirty side, is filtered by the air filter element 77, caused to flow into the clean side 93, and is caused to flow from the clean side 93 into the connecting tube 17. [0036]<br>
On the other hand, the oil mist flowing in from the inside of the cylinder head of the engine through the breather tube and the communication hole 103 into the air cleaner 18 flows through the penetrating portions 105 and 115 (for symbol 115, see FIG. 7) as indicated by arrows ® and (1), and flows into the connecting tube 17 together<br><br>
with the flow of air. [0037]<br>
In addition, a part of the oil mist becomes droplets of oil, which drop onto the first bottom surface 81d as indicated by arrow ®, the dropped oil flows on the inclined first bottom surface Bid as indicated by arrow @, further, flows from the first bottom surface Bid to the second bottom surface 81e as indicated by arrows (5) and ©, and flows from the second bottom surface 81e through the recessed portion 81p and the discharge port Blq (See FIG. 8) into the drain tube 68 as indicated by arrow (Z).<br>
Then, the oil accumulates in the drain tube 68 shown in FIG. 9. The oil thus accumulated is periodically discharged by removing the plug 118. [0038]<br>
Thus, in FIG. 6, the position of the communication hole 103 through which the oil mist is jetted from the breather tube 72 (See FIG. 4) into the air cleaner 18 is provided between the air filter element 77 and the connecting tube 17 and at an upper portion of the case main body 81, whereby it is possible to prevent the oil mist flowing from the communication hole 103 into the air cleaner 18 from flowing to the side of the air filter element 77 by the flow of air flowing from the side of<br><br>
the air filter element 77 to the side of the connecting tube 17 in the air cleaner 18, and the air filter element 77 can be prevented from being stained by the oil mist. [0039]<br>
Besides, since the oil passage 90  according to the present invention has a comparatively large width W as shown in FIG. 5, even when the quantity of the oil flowing on the bottom surface 81a is increased, the oil can be made to difficultly adhere to the filter paper 77b.<br>
Further, since the first bottom surface 81d and the second bottom surface 81e are surfaces inclined rearwardly downwards, the oil can be smoothly led to the discharge port 81q. [0040]<br>
As has been described referring to FIGS. 1, 2 and 5, in the motorcycle 10 comprising the breather device 74 for the engine 13 for communication between the crankcase 64 of the engine 13 and the air cleaner 18 through the breather tube 72, the air filter element 77 is disposed at the predetermined upward spacing HL from the bottom surface 81a of the air cleaner case 76 fronting on the inside of the clean side 93 of the air cleaner 18, the oil passage 90 as a passage is formed by surrounding by the lower surface 77a of the air filter element 77, the<br><br>
bottom surface 81a and the two side walls 81b, 82a of the air cleaner case 76, and the discharge port 81q for the oil, water and the like is provided at an end portion of the oil passage 90. [0041]<br>
The oil passage 90 is formed in the air cleaner 18 by the lower surface 77a of the air filter element 77, the bottom surface 81a of the air cleaner case 76 and the two side walls 81b, 82a of the air cleaner case 76, and the oil and the like are caused to flow from the oil passage 90 to the discharge port Blq, whereby the oil and the like can be discharged with a simple structure without specially forming a passage in the air cleaner case 76, and the oil passage 90 can be easily formed. [0042]<br>
In addition, since there is no need to provide a chamber as in the conventional art, there is no need for bolts or partition wall, the number of component parts can be reduced, and production cost of the air cleaner 18 can be reduced.<br>
Besides, fastening of bolts for forming the chamber is not needed, so that the number of assembly steps of the air cleaner 18 can be reduced, assembly is facilitated, and assembly cost of the air cleaner 18 can<br><br>
be reduced.<br>
[0043]<br>
Further, when the bottom surface 81a of the air cleaner case 76 is spaced downwards from the air filter element 77 by a sufficient distance, namely, the predetermined spacing HL so that the oil flowing on the bottom surface 81a of the air cleaner case 76 does not adhere to the air filter element 77, the air filter element 77, particularly the filter paper 77b, is not stained by the oil or the like, so that exchange interval of the air filter element 77 can be prolonged.<br>
[0044]<br>
Incidentally, in FIG. 6, the communication hole 103 into which the oil mist in the air cleaner 18 flows is provided on the side of the air filter element 77 with respect to the connecting tube 17; however, this arrangement is not limitative, and the communication hole 103 may be provided in the case main body 81 on the side opposite to the air filter element 77 with respect to the connecting tube 17.  In the latter case, the communication hole 103 is spaced from the air filter element 77, so that it is possible to more securely prevent the oil mist coming out of the communication hole 103 from flowing to the side of the air filter element 77.<br><br>
[0045]<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
The present invention, constituted as described above, displays the following effects.<br>
The air cleaner structure for vehicle according to claim 1 resides in that the air filter element is disposed at a predetermined upward spacing from the bottom surface of the air cleaner case fronting on the inside of the clean side of the air cleaner, the passage is formed by the lower surface of the air filter element, the bottom surface of the air cleaner case and the two side walls of the air cleaner case, and the discharge port is provided at an end portion of the passage. Therefore, the oil and water in the air cleaner case can be made to flow from the passage on the bottom surface to the discharge port, and the oil and the like can be discharged with a simple structure without specially forming a passage in the air cleaner case. [0046]<br>
In addition, since there is no need to provide a chamber as in the conventional art, there is no need for bolts or partition walls, the number of component parts can be reduced, and production cost can be reduced.<br>
Besides, fastening of bolts for forming the chamber<br><br>
is not needed, so that the number of assembly steps can be reduced, assembly is facilitated, and assembly cost can be reduced. [0047]<br>
Further, when the bottom surface of the air cleaner case is spaced downwards by a sufficient distance from the air filter element so that the oil flowing on the bottom surface of the air cleaner case does not adhere to the air filter element, the air filter element is not stained by the oil or the like, and the exchange interval of the air filter element can be prolonged.<br><br>
