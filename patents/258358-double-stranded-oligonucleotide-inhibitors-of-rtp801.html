FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to novel siRNA molecules which inhibit the RTP801 gene and to the use of such molecules to treat respiratory disorders of all types (including pulmonary disorders), eye diseases and conditions, microvascular disorders, angiogenesis- and apoptosis-related conditions.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD)<br>
Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), affects more than 16 million Americans and is the fourth highest cause of death in the United States. Cigarette smoking causes most occurrences of the debilitating disease but other environmental factors cannot be excluded (Petty TL. 2003. Definition, epidemiology, course, and prognosis of COPD. Clin. Cornerstone, 5-10).<br>
Pulmonary emphysema is a major manifestation of COPD. Permanent destruction of peripheral air spaces, distal to terminal bronchioles, is the hallmark of emphysema (Tuder RM.et al . Oxidative stress and apoptosis interact and cause emphysema due to vascular endothelial growth factor blocade. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol, 29:88-97; 2003.). Emphysema is also characterized by accumulation of inflammatory cells such as macrophages and neutrophils in bronchioles and alveolar structures (Petty, 2003).<br>
The pathogenesis of emphysema is complex and multifactorial. In humans, a deficiency of inhibitors of proteases produced by inflammatory cells, such as alpha 1-antitrypsin, has been<br>
shown to contribute to protease/antiprotease imbalance, thereby favoring destruction of alveolar<br>
extracellular matrix in cigarette-smoke (CS) induced emphysema (Eriksson, S. 1964. Pulmonary<br>
Emphysema and Alpha]-AntiIrypsin Deficiency. Ada Med Scand 175:197-205. Joos, L., Pare,<br>
P.D., and Sandford, A.J. 2002. Genetic risk factors of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.<br>
Swiss Med Wkly 7J2.27-37). Matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) play a central role in<br>
experimental emphysema, as documented by resistance of macrophage metalloelastase knockout<br>
mice against emphysema caused by chronic inhalation of CS (Hautamaki, et al: Requirement for<br>
macrophage elastasefor cigarette smoke-induced emphysema in mice. Science 277:2002-2004).<br>
Moreover, pulmonary overexpression of interleukin-13 in transgenic mice results in MMP- and<br>
cathepsin-dependent emphysema (Zheng, T., et al 2000. Inducible targeting oflL-13 to the adult<br>
lung causes matrix metalloproteinase- and cathepsin-dependent emphysema. J Clin Invest<br>
106:1081-1093). Recent works describe involvement of septal cell apoptosis in lung tissue<br>
destruction leading to emphysema (Rangasami T, et al . Genetic ablation of Nrf2 enhances<br>
susceptibility to cigarette smoke-iduced emphysema in mice. Submitted to Journal ofClinincal<br>
Investigation.; Tuder RM et al. Oxidative stress and apoptosis interact and cause emphysema<br>
due to vascular endothelial growth factor blocade. AmJRespir Cell Mol Biol, 29:88-97; 2003.;<br>

Yokohori N, Nagai A., Alveolar wall apoptosis causes lung destruction and emphysematous<br>
changes. Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol. 2003 May;28(5):555-62.).<br>
Among the mechanisms that underlie both pathways of lung destruction in emphysema,<br>
excessive formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) should be first of all mentioned. It is well<br>
established that prooxidant/antioxidant imbalance exists in the blood and in the lung tissue of<br>
smokers (Hulea SA, et al: Cigarette smoking causes biochemical changes in blood that are<br>
suggestive ofoxidative stress: a case-control study. J Environ Pat hoi Toxicol Oncol. 1995; 14(3-<br>

and cause emphysema due to vascular endothelial growth factor blocade. Am J Respir Cell Mol<br>
Biol, 29:88-97; 2003.). After one hour exposure of mice to CS, there is a dramatic increase of 8-<br>
hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine (8-OHdG) in the alveolar epithelial cells, particularly of type II (see<br>
Inhal Toxicol. 2003 Sep; 15(10):! 029-3 8. above).<br>
Overproduced reactive oxygen species are known for their cytotoxic activity, which stems from<br>
a direct DNA damaging effect and from the activation of apoptotic signal transduction pathways<br>
(Takahashi A, Masuda A, Sun M, Centonze VE, Herman B. Oxidative stress-induced apoptosis<br>

ROS's are not only cytotoxic per se but are also proinflammatory stimuli, being prominent<br>
activators of redox-sensitive transcription factors NFkB and AP-1 (reviewed in Rahman I.<br>
Oxidative stress and gene transcription in asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease:<br>
antioxidant therapeutic targets. Curr Drug Targets Inflamm Allergy. 2002 Sep;l(3):291-315.).<br>
Both transcription factors are, in turn, strongly implicated in stimulation of transcription of<br>
proinflammatory cytokines (reviewed in Renard P, Raes M. The proinflammatory transcription<br>
factor NFkappaB: a potential target for novel therapeutical strategies. Cell Biol Toxicol.<br>

inflammation. Arch Immunol Ther Exp (Warsz). 2000;48(2):59-63) and matrix degrading<br>
proteinases (Andela VB, Gordon AH, Zotalis G, Rosier RN, Goater JJ, Lewis GD, Schwarz EM,<br>

bone. Clin Orthop. 2003 Oct;(415 Suppl):S75-85.; Fleenor DL, Pang IH, Clark AF. Involvement<br>
of AP-1 in interleukin-1 alpha-stimulated MMP-3 expression in human trabecular meshwork<br>

cytokine, IL-lbeta: a role for the dual signalling pathways, Akt and Erk. Genes Cells. 2003<br>
Jun;8(6):515-23.). Proinflammatory cytokines, in turn, serve as attractors of inflammatory cells<br>
that also secrete matrix degrading enzymes, cytokines and reactive oxygen species. Thus, it<br>
appears that a pathogenic factor, like e.g. CS, triggers a pathological network where reactive<br>
oxygen species act as major mediators of lung destruction.<br>
Both reactive oxygen species (ROS) from inhaled cigarette smoke and those endogenously<br>
formed by inflammatory cells contribute to an increased intrapulmonary oxidant burden.<br>
One additional pathogenic factor with regards to COPD pathogenesis is the observed decreased<br>
expression of VEGF and VEGFRII in lungs of emphysematous patients (Yasunori Kasahara,<br>
Rubin M. Tuder, Carlyne D. Cool, David A. Lynch, Sonia C. Flores, and Norbert F. Voelkel.<br>

Vascular Endothelial Growth Factor Receptor 2 in Emphysema. AmJRespir Crit Care Med Vol<br>
163. pp 737-744, 200 J). Moreover, inhibition of VEGF signaling using chemical VEGFR<br>
inhibitor leads to alveolar septal endothelial and then to epithelial cell apoptosis, probably due to<br>
disruption of intimate structural/functional connection of both types of cells within alveoli<br>
(Yasunori Kasahara, Rubin M. Tuder, Laimute Taraseviciene-Stewart, Timothy D. Le Cras,<br>

VEGF receptors causes lung cell apoptosis and emphysema. J. Clin. Invest. 106:1311-1319<br>
(2000).; Voelkel NF, Cool CD. Pulmonary vascular involvement in chronic obstructive<br>
pulmonary disease. Eur Respir JSuppl. 2003 Nov;46:28s-32s).<br>
Macular degeneration<br>
The most common cause of decreased best-corrected vision in individuals over 65 years of age<br>
in the US is the retinal disorder known as age-related macular degeneration (AMD). As AMD<br>
progresses, the disease is characterized by loss of sharp, central vision. The area of the eye<br>
affected by AMD is the Macula - a small area in the center of the retina, composed primarily of<br>
photoreceptor cells. So-called "dry" AMD, accounting for about 85% - 90% of AMD patients,<br>
involves alterations in eye pigment distribution, loss of photoreceptors and diminished retinal<br>
function due to overall atrophy of cells. So-called "wet" AMD involves proliferation of<br>
abnormal choroidal vessels leading to clots or scars in the sub-retinal space. Thus, the onset of<br>
wet AMD occurs because of the formation of an abnormal choroidal neovascular network<br>
(choroidal neovascularization, CNV) beneath the neural retina. The newly formed blood vessels<br>
are excessively leaky. This leads to accumulation of subretinal fluid and blood leading to loss of<br>
visual acuity. Eventually, there is total loss of functional retina in the involved region, as a large<br>
disciform scar involving choroids and retina forms. While dry AMD patients may retain vision<br>
of decreased quality, wet AMD often results in blindness. (Hamdi &amp; Kenney, Age-related<br>
Macular degeneration - a neve viewpoint, Frontiers in Bioscience, e305-314, May 2003). CNV<br>
occurs not only in wet AMD but also in other ocular pathologies such as ocular histoplasmosis<br>
syndrome, angiod streaks, ruptures in Bruch's membrane, myopic degeneration, ocular tumors<br>
and some retinal degenerative diseases.<br>
Various studies conducted have determined several risk factors for AMD, such as smoking,<br>
aging, family history (Milton, Am J Ophthalmol 88, 269 (1979); Mitchell et al., Ophthalmology<br>
102, 1450-1460 (1995); Smith et al., Ophthalmology 108, 697-704 (2001)) sex (7-fold higher<br>
likelihood in females: Klein et al., Ophthalmology 99, 933-943 (1992) and race (whites are most<br>
susceptible). Additional risk factors may include eye characteristics such as farsightedness<br>
(hyperopia) and light-colored eyes, as well as cardiovascular disease and hypertension.<br>
Evidence of genetic involvement in the onset progression of the disease has also been<br>
documented (see Hamdi &amp; Kenney above).<br>
Two companies, Acuity Pharmaceuticals and Sirna Therapeutics, have both recently filed an<br>
IND for siRNA molecules inhibiting VEGF and VEGF-R1 (Flt-1), respectively, for treatment of<br>
AMD. These molecules are termed Cand5 inhibitor and 027 inhibitor respectively.<br>
Microvascular disorders<br>
Microvascular disorders are composed of a broad group of conditions that primarily affect the<br>
microscopic capillaries and lymphatics and are therefore outside the scope of direct surgical<br>
intervention. Microvascular disease can be broadly grouped into the vasospastic. the yasculitis<br>
and lymphatic occlusive. Additionally, many of the known vascular conditions have a<br>
microvascular element to them.<br>
• Vasospastic Disease - Vasospastic diseases are a group of relatively common conditions<br>
where, for unknown reasons, the peripheral vasoconstrictive reflexes are hypersensitive.<br>
This results in inappropriate vasoconstriction and tissue ischaemia, even to the point of<br>
tissue loss. Vasospastic symptoms are usually related to temperature or the use of<br>
vibrating machinery but may be secondary to other conditions.<br>
• Vasculitic Disease - Vasculitic diseases are those that involve a primary inflammatory<br>
process in the microcirculation. Vasculitis is usually a component of an autoimmune or<br>
connective tissue disorder and is not generally amenable to surgical treatment but<br>
requires immunosuppressive treatment if the symptoms are severe.<br>
• Lymphatic Occlusive Disease - Chronic swelling of the lower or upper limb<br>
(lymphoedema) is the result of peripheral lymphatic occlusion. This is a relatively rare<br>
condition that has a large number of causes, some inherited, some acquired. The<br>
mainstays of treatment are correctly fitted compression garments and the use of<br>
intermittent compression devices.<br>
Microvascular pathologies associated with diabetes<br>
Diabetes is the leading cause of blindness, the number one cause of amputations and impotence,<br>
and one of the most frequently occurring chronic childhood diseases. Diabetes is also the<br>
leading cause of end-stage renal disease in the United States, with a prevalence rate of 31%<br>
compared with other renal diseases. Diabetes is also the most frequent indication for kidney<br>
transplantation, accounting for 22% of all transplantation operations.<br>
In general, diabetic complications can be classified broadly as microvascular or macrovascular<br>
disease. Microvascular complications include neuropathy (nerve damage), nephropathy (kidney<br>
disease) and vision disorders (eg retinopathy, glaucoma, cataract and corneal disease). In the<br>
retina, glomerulus, and vasa nervorum, similar pathophysiologic features characterize diabetesspecific<br>
microvascular disease.<br>
Microvascular pathologies associated with diabetes are defined as a disease of the smallest<br>
blood vessels (capillaries) that may occur e.g. in people who have had diabetes for a long time.<br>
The walls of the vessels become abnormally thick but weak. They, therefore, bleed, leak protein<br>
and slow the flow of blood through the body.<br>
Clinical and animal model data indicate that chronic hyperglycemia is the central initiating<br>
factor for all types of diabetic microvascular disease. Duration and magnitude of hyperglycemia<br>
are both strongly correlated with the extent and rate of progression of diabetic microvascular<br>
disease. Although all diabetic cells are exposed to elevated levels of plasma glucose,<br>
hyperglycemic damage is limited to those cell types (e.g., endothelia] cells) that develop<br>
intracellular hyperglycemia. Endothelial cells develop intracellular hyperglycemia because,<br>
unlike many other cells, they cannot down-regulate glucose transport when exposed to<br>
extracellular hyperglycemia. That intracellular hyperglycemia is necessary and sufficient for the<br>
development of diabetic pathology is further demonstrated by the fact that overexpression of the<br>
GLUT1 glucose transporter in mesangial cells cultured in a normal glucose milieu mimics the<br>
diabetic phenotype, inducing the same increases in collagen type IV, collagen type I, and<br>
fibronectin gene expression as diabetic hyperglycemia.<br>
Abnormal Endothelial Cell Function; Early in the course of diabetes mellitus, before structural<br>
changes are evident, hyperglycemia causes abnormalities in blood flow and vascular<br>
permeability in the retina, glomerulus, and peripheral nerve vasa nervorum. The increase in<br>
blood flow and intracapillary pressure is thought to reflect hyperglycemia-induced decreased<br>
nitric oxide (NO) production on the efferent side of capillary beds, and possibly an increased<br>
sensitivity to angiotensin II. As a consequence of increased intracapillary pressure and<br>
endothelial cell dysfunction, retinal capillaries exhibit increased leakage of fluorescein and<br>
glomerular capillaries have an elevated albumin excretion rate (AER). Comparable changes<br>
occur in the vasa vasorum of peripheral nerve. Early in the course of diabetes, increased<br>
permeability is reversible; as time progresses, however, it becomes irreversible.<br>
Increased Vessel Wall Protein Accumulation<br>
The common pathophysiologic feature of diabetic microvascular disease is progressive<br>
narrowing and eventual occlusion of vascular lumina, which results in inadequate perfusion and<br>
function of the affected tissues. Early hyperglycemia-induced microvascular hypertension and<br>
increased vascular permeability contribute to irreversible microvessel occlusion by three<br>
processes:<br>
" The first is an abnormal leakage of periodic acid-Schiff (PAS)-positive, carbohydratecontaining<br>
plasma proteins, which are deposited in the capillary wall and which may<br>
stimulate perivascular cells such as pericytes and mesangial cells to elaborate growth<br>
factors and extracellular matrix.<br>
* The second is extravasation of growth factors, such as transforming growth factor pi<br>
(TGF-P1), which directly stimulates overproduction of extracellular matrix components,<br>
and may induce apoptosis in certain complication-relevant cell types.<br>
" The third is hypertension-induced stimulation of pathologic gene expression by<br>
endothelial cells and supporting cells, which include glut-1 glucose transporters, growth<br>
factors, growth factor receptors, extracellular matrix components, and adhesion<br>
molecules that can activate circulating leukocytes. The observation that unilateral<br>
reduction in the severity of diabetic microvascular disease occurs on the side with<br>
ophthalmic or renal artery stenosis is consistent with this concept.<br>
Microvascular Cell Loss and Vessel Occlusion<br>
The progressive narrowing and occlusion of diabetic microvascular lumina are also<br>
accompanied by microvascular cell loss. In the retina, diabetes mellirus induces programmed<br>
cell death of Miiller cells and ganglion cells, pericytes, and endothelial cells. In the glomerulus,<br>
declining renal function is associated with widespread capillary occlusion and podocyte loss, but<br>
the mechanisms underlying glomerular cell loss are not yet known. In the vasa nervorum,<br>
endothelial cell and pericyte degeneration occur, and these microvascular changes appear to<br>
precede the development of diabetic peripheral neuropathy. The multifocal distribution of<br>
axonal degeneration in diabetes supports a causal role for microvascular occlusion, but<br>
hyperglycemia-induced decreases in neurotrophins may contribute by preventing normal axonal<br>
repair and regeneration.<br>
Another common feature of diabetic microvascular disease has been termed hyperglycemic<br>
memory, or the persistence or progression of hyperglycemia-induced microvascular alterations<br>
during subsequent periods of normal glucose homeostasis. The most striking example of this<br>
phenomenon is the development of severe retinopathy in histologically normal eyes of diabetic<br>
dogs that occurred entirely during a 2.5-year period of normalized blood glucose that followed<br>
2.5 years of hyperglycemia. Hyperglycemia-induced increases in selected matrix gene<br>
transcription also persist for weeks after restoration of normoglycemia in vivo, and a less<br>
pronounced, but qualitatively similar, prolongation of hyperglycemia-induced increase in<br>
selected matrix gene transcription occurs in cultured endothelial cells.<br>
For further information, see "Shared pathophysiologic features of microvascular complications<br>
of diabetes" (Larsen: Williams Textbook of Endocrinology, 10th ed., Copyright © 2003<br>
Elsevier).<br>
Microvascular complications occur not only in overt diabetes but are also due to Impaired<br>
Glucose Tolerance (IGT). Microvascular complications of IGT: neuropathy, retinopathy, and<br>
renal microproteinuria.<br>
Diabetic neuropathy<br>
Diabetic neuropathies are neuropathic disorders (peripheral nerve damage) that are associated<br>
with diabetes mellitus. These conditions usually result from diabetic microvascular injury<br>
involving small blood vessels that supply nerves (vasa nervorum). Relatively common<br>
conditions which may be associated with diabetic neuropathy include third nerve palsy;<br>
mononeuropathy; mononeuropathy multiplex; diabetic amyotrophy; a painful polyneuropathy;<br>
autonomic neuropathy; and thoracoabdominal neuropathy and the most common form,<br>
peripheral neuropathy, which mainly affects the feet and legs. There are four factors involved in<br>
the development of diabetic neuropathy: microvascular disease, advanced glycated end<br>
products, protein kinase C, and the polyol pathway.<br>
Microvascular disease in diabetic neuropathy<br>
Vascular and neural diseases are closely related and intertwined. Blood vessels depend on<br>
normal nerve function, and nerves depends on adequate blood flow. The first pathological<br>
change in the microvasculature is vasoconstriction. As the disease progresses, neuronal<br>
dysfunction correlates closely with the development of vascular abnormalities, such as capillary<br>
basement membrane thickening and endothelial hyperplasia, which contribute to diminished<br>
oxygen tension and hypoxia. Neuronal ischemia is a well-established characteristic of diabetic<br>
neuropathy. Vasodilator agents (e.g., angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors, alphalantagonists)<br>
can lead to substantial improvements in neuronal blood flow, with corresponding<br>
improvements in nerve conduction velocities. Thus, microvascular dysfunction occurs early in<br>
diabetes, parallels the progression of neural dysfunction, and may be sufficient to support the<br>
severity of structural, functional, and clinical changes observed in diabetic neuropathy.<br>
Peripheral neuropathy (legs), sensorimotor neuropathy is a significant component in the<br>
pathogenesis of leg ulcers in diabetes.<br>
Neuropathy is a common complication of diabetes occurring over time in more than half of<br>
patients with type 2 diabetes. Nerve conduction studies demonstrate that neuropathy is already<br>
present in 10-18% of patients at the time of diabetes diagnosis, suggesting that peripheral nerve<br>
injury occurs at early stages of disease and with milder glycemic dysregulation. The concept<br>
that neuropathy is an early clinical sign of diabetes was proposed &gt;40 years ago, and most<br>
studies report an association between IGT and neuropathy. Most patients with IGT and<br>
associated neuropathy have a symmetric, distal sensory polyneuropathy with prominent<br>
neuropathic pain. IGT neuropathy (Microvascular complications of impaired glucose tolerance<br>
- Perspectives in Diabetes, J. Robinson Singleton, in Diabetes December 1, 2003) is<br>
phenotypically similar to early diabetic neuropathy, which also causes sensory symptoms,<br>
including pain, and autonomic dysfunction. In a survey of 669 patients with early diabetic<br>
neuropathy, sensory symptoms were present in &gt;60%, impotence in nearly 40%, and other<br>
autonomic involvement in 33%, but evidence of motor involvement in only 12%. These clinical<br>
findings suggest prominent early involvement of the small unmyelinated nerve fibers that carry<br>
pain, temperature, and autonomic signals. Direct quantitation of unmyelinated intraepidermal<br>
nerve fibers from skin biopsies shows similar fiber loss and altered morphology in patients with<br>
neuropathy associated with IGT and early diabetes .<br>
Autonomic dysfunction, particularly erectile dysfunction and altered cardiac vagal response, are<br>
common early features of neuropathic injury in diabetes. Work with IGT patients also suggests<br>
prevalent vagal dysautonoinia: separate studies have found abnormal heart rate recovery<br>
following exercise, blunted R-R interval variability to deep breathing, and reduced expiration to<br>
inspiration ratio (all measures of vagal dysautonomia) in a greater fraction of IGT patients than<br>
age-matched normoglycemic control subjects.<br>
Nerve damage in diabetes affects the motor, sensory, and autonomic fibers. Motor neuropathy<br>
causes muscle weakness, atrophy, and paresis. Sensory neuropathy leads to loss of the protective<br>
sensations of pain, pressure, and heat. The absence of pain leads to many problems in the<br>
insensate foot, including ulceration, unperceived trauma, and Charcot neuroarthropathy. The<br>
patient may not seek treatment until after the wound has advanced. A combination of sensory<br>
and motor dysfunction can cause the patient to place abnormal stresses on the foot, resulting in<br>
trauma, which may lead to infection. Autonomic sympathetic neuropathy causes vasodilation<br>
and decreased sweating, which results in warm, overly dry feet that are particularly prone to<br>
skin breakdown, as well as functional alterations in microvascular flow. Autonomic dysfunction<br>
(and denervation of dermal structures) also results in loss of skin integrity, which provides an<br>
ideal site for microbial invasion. The neuropathic foot does not ulcerate spontaneously; rather, it<br>
is the combination of some form of trauma accompanied by neuropathy.<br>
Microvascular dysfunction occurs early in diabetes, parallels the progression of neural<br>
dysfunction, and may be sufficient to support the severity of structural, functional, and clinical<br>
changes observed in diabetic neuropathy.<br>
Advanced glycated end products - Elevated intracellular levels of glucose cause a nonenzymatic<br>
covalent bonding with proteins, which alters their structure and destroys their<br>
function. Certain of these glycated proteins are implicated in the pathology of diabetic<br>
neuropathy and other long term complications of diabetes.<br>
Protein kinase C (PKC) - PKC is implicated in the pathology of diabetic neuropathy. Increased<br>
levels of glucose cause an increase in intracellular diacylglycerol, which activates PKC. PKC<br>
inhibitors in animal models will increase nerve conduction velocity by increasing neuronal<br>
blood flow.<br>
Sensorimotor polyneuropathy<br>
Longer nerve fibers are affected to a greater degree than shorter ones, because nerve conduction<br>
velocity is slowed in proportion to a nerve's length. In this syndrome, decreased sensation and<br>
loss of reflexes occurs first in the toes bilaterally, then extends upward. It is usually described as<br>
glove-stocking distribution of numbness, sensory loss, dysesthesia and nighttime pain. The pain<br>
can feel like burning, pricking sensation, achy or dull. Pins and needles sensation is common.<br>
Loss of proprioception, that is, the sense of where a limb is in space, is affected early. These<br>
patients cannot feel when they are stepping on a foreign body, like a splinter, or when they are<br>
developing a callous from an ill-fitting shoe. Consequently, they are at risk for developing ulcers<br>
and infections on the feet and legs, which can lead to amputation. Similarly, these patients can<br>
get multiple fractures of the knee, ankle or foot, and develop a Charcot joint. Loss of motor<br>
function results on dorsiflexion contractures of the toes, so called hammertoes. These<br>
contractures occur not only in the foot but also in the hand.<br>
Autonomic neuropathy<br>
The autonomic nervous system is composed of nerves serving the heart, GI tract and urinary<br>
system. Autonomic neuropathy can affect any of these organ systems. The most commonly<br>
recognized autonomic dysfuction in diabetics is orthostatic hypotension, or the uncomfortable<br>
sensation of fainting when a patient stands up. In the case of diabetic autonomic neuropathy, it is<br>
due to the failure of the heart and arteries to appropriately adjust heart rate and vascular tone to<br>
keep blood continually and fully flowing to the brain. This symptom is usually accompanied by<br>
a loss of sinus respiratory variation, that is, the usual change in heart rate seen with normal<br>
breathing. When these two findings are present, cardiac autonomic neuropathy is present.<br>
GI tract manifestations include delayed gastric emptying, gastroparesis, nausea, bloating, and<br>
diarrhea. Because many diabetics take oral medication for their diabetes, absorption of these<br>
medicines is greatly affected by the delayed gastric emptying. This can lead to hypoglycemia<br>
when an oral diabetic agent is taken before a meal and does not get absorbed until hours, or<br>
sometimes days later, when there is normal or low blood sugar already. Sluggish movement of<br>
the small instestine can cause bacterial overgrowth, made worse by the presence of<br>
hyperglycemia. This leads to bloating, gas and diarrhea.<br>
Urinary symptoms include urinary frequency, urgency, incontinence and retention. Again,<br>
because of the retention of sweet urine, urinary tract infections are frequent. Urinary retention<br>
can lead to bladder diverticula, stones, reflux nephropathy.<br>
Cranial neuropathy<br>
When cranial nerves are affected, oculomotor (3rd) neuropathies are most common. The<br>
oculomotor nerve controls all of the muscles that move the eye with the exception of the lateral<br>
rectus and superior oblique muscles. It also serves to constrict the pupil and open the eyelid. The<br>
onset of a diabetic third nerve palsy is usually abrupt, beginning with frontal or periorbital pain<br>
and then diplopia. All of the oculomotor muscles innervated by the third nerve may be affected,<br>
except for those that control pupil size. The sixth nerve, the abducens nerve, which innervates<br>
the lateral rectus muscle of the eye (moves the eye laterally), is also commonly affected but<br>
fourth nerve, the trochlear nerve, (innervates the superior oblique muscle, which moves the eye<br>
downward) involvement is unusual. Mononeuropathies of the thoracic or lumbar spinal nerves<br>
can occur and lead to painful syndromes that mimic myocardial infarction, cholecystitis or<br>
appendicitis. Diabetics have a higher incidence of entrapment neuropathies, such as carpal<br>
tunnel syndrome.<br>
Diabetic Limb Ischemia and Diabetic foot ulcers<br>
Diabetes and pressure can impair microvascular circulation and lead to changes in the skin on<br>
the lower extremities, which in turn, can lead to formation of ulcers and subsequent infection.<br>
Microvascular changes lead to limb muscle microangiopathy, as well as a predisposition to<br>
develop peripheral ischemia and a reduced angiogenesis compensatory response to ischemic<br>
events. Microvascular pathology exacerbates Peripheral Vascular Disease (PVD) (or Peripheral<br>
Arterial Disease (PAD) or Lower Extremity Arterial Disease (LEAD)- a MACROvascular<br>
complication - narrowing of the arteries in the legs due to atherosclerosis. PVD occurs earlier in<br>
diabetics, is more severe and widespread, and often involves intercurrent microcirculatory<br>
problems affecting the legs, eyes, and kidneys.<br>
Foot ulcers and gangrene are frequent comorbid conditions of PAD. Concurrent peripheral<br>
neuropathy with impaired sensation make the foot susceptible to trauma, ulceration, and<br>
infection. The progression of PAD in diabetes is compounded by such comorbidity as peripheral<br>
neuropathy and insensitivity of the feet and lower extremities to pain and trauma. With impaired<br>
circulation and impaired sensation, ulceration and infection occur. Progression to osteomyelitis<br>
and gangrene may necessitate amputation.<br>
Persons with diabetes are up to 25 times more likely than nondiabetic persons to sustain a lower<br>
limb amputation, underscoring the need to prevent foot ulcers and subsequent limb loss.<br>
Diabetic foot ulcers may occur not only in conjunction with PAD but may also be associated<br>
with neuropathy, venous insufficiency (varicose veins), trauma, and infection. PAD contributes<br>
to these other conditions in producing or precipitating foot ulcers. Foot ulcers do not necessarily<br>
represent progression of PAD, as they may occur in the presence of adequate clinical peripheral<br>
arterial perfusion. Patient- based studies indicate an increased risk of foot ulceration in diabetic<br>
patients who have peripheral neuropathy and a high plantar foot pressure. The prevalence of a<br>
history of ulcers or sores on the foot or ankles was 15% of all diabetic patients in the populationbased<br>
study in southern Wisconsin. The prevalence was higher for diabetic individuals<br>
diagnosed at age 
greater in insulin-treated diabetic patients (17%) than in patients not taking insulin (10%). The<br>
prevalence increased with age, especially in diabetic patients diagnosed at age 
patient studies from Europe, prevalence of foot ulcers in diabetic patients was 3% in those age<br>
in males than in females at age 70 years.<br>
15<br>
In diabetic patients, foot ischemia and infection are serious and even life-threatening<br>
occurrences; however, neuropathy is the most difficult condition to treat . The medical and<br>
surgical literature concerning all aspects of the clinical and pathological manifestations of the<br>
diabetic foot is overwhelming. Neuropathy, angiopathy, retinopathy, and nephropathy, alone or<br>
in combination and in varying degrees of severity, may influence the treatment of the diabetic<br>
foot.<br>
Every year, 82,000 limb amputations are performed in patients with diabetes mellitus. The<br>
majority of these amputations are performed in the elderly population. Amputations resulting<br>
from diabetes may arise from multiple etiologies, including foot ulcers, ischemia, venous leg<br>
ulcers (ie, those secondary to venous reflux), and heel ulcers (ie, those resulting from untreated<br>
pressure ulcers in the heel). The majority of these amputations originate from ulcers. The<br>
prevalence of foot ulcers among patients with diabetes is 12%. In addition, the 20-year<br>
cumulative incidence of lower-extremity ulcers in patients with type 1 diabetes is 9.9%.<br>
Diabetes-induced limb amputations result in a 5-year mortality rate of 39% to 68% and are<br>
associated with an increased risk of additional amputations. The length of hospital stay is<br>
approximately 60% longer among patients with diabetic foot ulcers, as compared with those<br>
without ulcers.<br>
Diabetic neuropathy impairs the nerve axon reflex that depends on healthy C-fiber nociceptor<br>
function and causes local vasodilation in response to a painful stimulus. This condition further<br>
compromises the vasodilatory response present in conditions of stress, such as injury or<br>
inflammation, in the diabetic neuropathic foot. This impairment may partially explain why some<br>
ulcers in the diabetic neuropathic foot are either slow to heal or fail to heal at all, despite<br>
successful lower-extremity revascularization.<br>
The most common causal pathway to diabetic foot ulceration can thus be identified as the<br>
combination of neuropathy (sensory loss), deformity (eg, prominent metatarsal heads), arid<br>
trauma (eg, ill-fitting footwear).<br>
Most surgeons prefer to perform popliteal or tibial arterial bypass because of inferior rates of<br>
limb salvage and patency compared with more proximal procedures. If popliteal or tibial arterial<br>
bypass is unable to restore a palpable foot pulse, pedal bypass has been reported to provide a<br>
more durable and effective limb-salvage procedure for patients with diabetes and ischemic foot<br>
wounds] . Even extensive multisegment occlusive disease in patients with diabetes does not<br>
present an impediment to foot salvage. Whereas serious wound complications may have<br>
disastrous results, they are uncommon after pedal bypass grafting. Adequate control of<br>
preexisting foot infection and careful graft tunneling have been shown to be effective in<br>
avoiding further complications. Angioplasty in the lower extremity is becoming more<br>
progressively utilized. However, it must be emphasized that for angioplasty to be effective, a<br>
distal vessel or feeding vessel must be patent if the more proximal angioplasty is to succeed.<br>
While diabetic ulcers / limb pathologies may be managed in some patients (by Debridement,<br>
antibiotic treatment, use of preparations to stimulate granulation tissue (new collagen and<br>
angiogenesis) and reduction of bacterial burden in the wound), it would be beneficial to have a<br>
pharmaceutical composition that could better treat these conditions and/or alleviate the<br>
symptoms.<br>

Coronary Microvascular Dysfunction in diabetes<br>
The correlation between histopathology and microcirculatory dysfunction in diabetes is well<br>
known from old experimental studies and from autopsy, where thickening of the basal<br>
membrane, perivascular fibrosis, vascular rarefication, and capillary hemorrhage are frequently<br>
found. It remains difficult to confirm these data in vivo, although a recent paper demonstrated a<br>
correlation between pathology and ocular micorovascular dysfunction (Am J Physiol 2003;285).<br>
A large amount of clinical studies, however, indicate that not only overt diabetes but also<br>
impaired metabolic control may affect coronary microcirculation (Hypert Res 2002;25:893).<br>
Werner alluded to the important paper by Sambuceti et al (Circulation 2001; 104:1129) showing<br>
the persistence of microvascular dysfunction in patients after successful reopening of the infarct<br>
related artery, and which may explain the increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality in<br>
these patients. There is mounting evidence from large acute reperfusion studies that morbidity<br>
and mortality are unrelated to the reopening itself of the infarct related artery, but much more<br>
dependent on the T1MI flow+/- myocardial blush (Stone 2002; Feldmann Circulation 2003).<br>
Herrmann indicated, among others, that the integrity of the coronary microcirculation is<br>
probably the most important clincal and prognostic factor in this context (Circulation 2001). The<br>
neutral effect of protection devices (no relevant change for TIMI flow, for ST resolution, or for<br>
MACE) may indicate that a functional impairment of microcirculation is the major determinant<br>
of prognosis. There is also increasing evidence that coronary microvascular dysfunction plays a<br>
major role in non obstructive CAD. Coronary endothelial dysfunction remains a strong<br>
prognostic predictor in these patients.<br>
Diabetic nephropathy (Renal dysfunction in patients with diabetes)<br>
Diabetic nephropathy encompasses microalbuminuria (a microvascular disease effect),<br>
proteinuria and ESRD. Diabetes is the most common cause of kidney failure, accounting for<br>
more than 40 percent of new cases. Even when drugs and diet are able to control diabetes, the<br>
disease can lead to nephropathy and kidney failure. Most people with diabetes do not develop<br>
nephropathy that is severe enough to cause kidney failure. About 16 million people in the<br>
United States have diabetes, and about 100,000 people have kidney failure as a result of<br>
diabetes.<br>
Diabetic retinopathy<br>
In the diabetic state, hyperglycemia leads to decreased retinal blood flow, retinal<br>
hyperpermeability, delays in photoreceptor nerve conduction, and retinal neuronal cell death. In<br>
short duration diabetes, neuronal cell death has been identified within the inner nuclear layer of<br>
the retina. Specifically, apoptosis has been localized to glial cells such as Mueller cells and<br>
astrocytes and has been shown to occur within 1 month of diabetes in the STZ-induced diabetic<br>
rat model. The cause of these events is multi-factorial including activation of the<br>
diacylglycerol/PKC pathway, oxidative stress, and nonenzymatic glycosylation. The<br>
combination of these events renders the retina hypoxic and ultimately leads to the development<br>
of diabetic retinopathy. One possible connection between retinal ischemia and the early changes<br>
in the diabetic retina is the hypoxia-induced production of growth factors such as VEGF. The<br>
master regulator of the hypoxic response has been identified as hypoxia inducible factor-1 (HIF-<br>
1), which controls genes that regulate cellular proliferation and angiogenesis. Prior studies have<br>
demonstrated that inhibition of HIF-1 ubiquitination leads to binding with hypoxia responsive<br>
elements (HRE) and production of VEGF mRNA.<br>
Diabetic Retinopathy is defined as the progressive dysfunction of the retinal vasculature caused<br>
by chronic hyperglycemia. Key features of diabetic retinopathy include microaneurysms, retinal<br>
hemorrhages, retinal lipid exudates, cotton-wool spots, capillary nonperfusion, macular edema<br>
and neovascularization. Associated features include vitreous hemorrhage, retinal detachment,<br>
neovascular glaucoma, premature cataract and cranial nerve palsies.<br>
There are 16 million people in the US with Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes. Within 15 years, 80%<br>
of Type 1 patients have developed diabetic retinopathy while 84% of Type 2 diabetic patients<br>
develop retinopathy within 19 years. These numbers constitute a significant market for<br>
therapeutic agents aimed at ocular diseases of neovasculature. The development of diabetic<br>
retinopathy is time-dependent. Despite optimal blood sugar control, patients with long-standing<br>
disease can be expected to eventually develop some form of retinopathy. The National Society<br>
to Prevent Blindness has estimated that 4 to 6 million diabetics in the U.S. have diabetic<br>
retinopathy. The estimated annual incidence of new cases of proliferative diabetic retinopathy<br>
and diabetic macular edema are 65,000 and 75,000, respectively, with a prevalence of 700,000<br>
and 500,000 respectively. Diabetic retinopathy causes from 12,000 to 24,000 new cases of<br>
blindness in the US every year. Retinopathy is treated by surgical methods, effective in reducing<br>
severe vision loss, but the lasered portions of the retina are irreversibly destroyed. There are no<br>
drug treatments available.<br>
A microvascular disease that primarily affects the capillaries, diabetes mellitus affects the eye<br>
by destroying the vasculature in the conjunctiva, retina and central nervous system. Patients may<br>
present with histories of long-standing injected bulbar conjunctivae along with systemic<br>
complaints of weight loss despite larger than normal appetite (polyphasia), abnormal thirst<br>
(polydypsia) and abnormally frequent urination (polyuria).<br>
19<br>
Fluctuating visual acuity secondary to unstable blood sugar is a common ocular sign. Swelling<br>
within the crystalline lens results in large sudden shifts in refraction as well as premature<br>
cataract formation. Changes in visual acuity will depend upon the severity and stage of the<br>
disease.<br>
In the retina, weakening of the arterioles and capillaries may result in the characteristic<br>
appearance of intraretinal dot and blot hemorrhages, exudates, intraretinal microvascular<br>
abnormalities (IRMA) microaneurysms, edema and cotton wool infarcts. Proliferative diabetic<br>
retinopathy is the result of severe vascular compromise and is visible as neovascularization of<br>
the disc (NVD), neovascularization elsewhere (NVE) and neovascularization of the iris (NVI, or<br>
rubeosis irides). Neurological complications include palsies of the third, fourth and sixth cranial<br>
nerves as well as diabetic papillitis and facial nerve paralysis.<br>
Diabetes mellitus is a genetically influenced group of diseases that share glucose intolerance. It<br>
is characterized as a disorder of metabolic regulation as a result of deficient or malfunctioning<br>
insulin or deficient or malfunctioning cellular insulin receptors.<br>
Biochemistry involving the formation of sorbitol plays a role in the destruction of pericytes,<br>
which are cells that support the vascular endothelium. As the supportive pericytes perish,<br>
capillary endothelium becomes compromised, resulting in the vascular leakage of blood, protein<br>
and lipid. This, in combination with thickened, glucose-laden blood, produces vascular<br>
insufficiency, capillary nonperfusion, retinal hypoxia, altered structure and decreased function.<br>
The formation and release of vasoproliferative factors which play a role in the genesis of retinal<br>
neovascularization are poorly understood.<br>
Most non-vision threatening sequelae of diabetes resolve spontaneously over the course of<br>
weeks to months following medical control. In cases where there are large refractive changes,<br>
patients may require a temporary spectacle prescription until the refraction stabilizes. When<br>
retinopathy threatens the macula or when new blood vessels proliferate, the patient may be<br>
referred for laser photocoagulation. The Diabetic Retinopathy Study (DRS) has conclusively<br>
proven that panretinal photocoagulation was successful in reducing the risk of severe vision loss<br>
in high-risk patients. It defined the high-risk characteristics as: (1) Neovascularization of the<br>
optic disc (NVD) one-quarter to one-third of a disc diameter in size and (2) Neovascularization<br>
elsewhere (NVE) with any vitreous hemorrhage.<br>
Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)<br>
DME is a complication of diabetic retinopathy, a disease affecting the blood vessels of the<br>
retina. Diabetic retinopathy results in multiple abnormalities in the retina, including retinal<br>
thickening and edema, hemorrhages, impeded blood flow, excessive leakage of fluid from blood<br>
vessels and, in the final stages, abnormal blood vessel growth. This blood vessel growth can<br>
lead to large hemorrhages and severe retinal damage. When the blood vessel leakage of diabetic<br>
retinopathy causes swelling in the macula, it is referred to as DME. The principal symptom of<br>
DME is a loss of central vision. Risk factors associated with DME include poorly controlled<br>
blood glucose levels, high blood pressure, abnormal kidney function causing fluid retention,<br>
high cholesterol levels and other general systemic factors.<br>
According to the World Health Organization, diabetic retinopathy is the leading cause of<br>
blindness in working age adults and a leading cause of vision loss in diabetics. The American<br>
Diabetes Association reports that there are approximately 18 million diabetics in the United<br>
States and approximately 1.3 million newly diagnosed cases of diabetes in the United States<br>
each year. Prevent Blindness America and the National Eye Institute estimate that in the United<br>
States there are over 5.3 million people aged 18 or older with diabetic retinopathy, including<br>
approximately 500,000 with DME. The CDC estimates that there are approximately 75,000 new<br>
cases of DME in the United States each year.<br>
Additional Neuropathies<br>
In addition to diabetes, the common causes of neuropathy are herpes zoster infection, chronic or<br>
acute trauma (including surgery) and various neurotoxins. Neuropathic pain is common in<br>
cancer as a direct result of the cancer on peripheral nerves (e.g., compression by a tumor) and as<br>
a side effect of many chemotherapy drugs.<br>
Microvascular disease - Vascular and neural diseases are closely related and intertwined. Blood<br>
vessels depend on normal nerve function, and nerves depends on adequate blood flow. The first<br>
pathological change in the microvasculature is vasoconstriction. As the disease progresses,<br>
neuronal dysfunction correlates closely with the development of vascular abnormalities, such as<br>
capillary basement membrane thickening and endothelial hyperplasia, which contribute to<br>
diminished oxygen tension and hypoxia. Vasodilator agents (e.g., angiotensin-convertingenzyme<br>
inhibitors, a 1-antagonists) can lead to substantial improvements in neuronal blood flow,<br>
with corresponding improvements in nerve conduction velocities.<br>
Clinical manifestations<br>
Neuropathy affects all peripheral nerves: pain fibers, motor neurons, autonomic nerves. It<br>
therefore necessarily can affect all organs and systems since all are innervated. There are several<br>
distinct syndromes based on the organ systems and members affected, but these are by no means<br>
exclusive. A patient can have sensorimotor and autonomic neuropathy or any other combination.<br>
Despite advances in the understanding of the metabolic causes of neuropathy, treatments aimed<br>
at interrupting these pathological processes have been limited by side effects and lack of<br>
efficacy. Thus, treatments are symptomatic and do not address the underlying problems. Agents<br>
for pain caused by sensorimotor neuropathy include tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs), serotonin<br>
reuptake inhibitors (SSRJs) and antiepileptic drugs (AEDs). None of these agents reverse the<br>
pathological processes leading to diabetic neuropathy and none alter the relentless course of the<br>
illness. Thus, it would be useful to have a pharmaceutical composition that could better treat<br>
these conditions and/or alleviate the symptoms.<br>
Additional Retinopathies<br>
Retinal microvasculopathv (AIDS retinopathv)<br>
Retinal microvasculopathy is seen in 100% of AIDS patients. It is characterized by intraretinal<br>
hemorrhages, microaneurysms, Roth spots, cotton-wool spots (microinfarctions of the nerve<br>
fiber layer) and perivascular sheathing . The etiology of the retinopathy is unknown though it<br>
has been thought to be due to circulating immune complexes, local release of cytotoxic<br>
substances, abnormal hemorheology, and HIV infection of endothelial cells. AIDS retinopathy<br>
is now so common that cotton wool spots in a patient without diabetes or hypertension but at<br>
risk for HIV should prompt the physician to consider viral testing. There is no specific treatment<br>
for AIDS retinopathy but its continued presence may prompt a physician to reexamine the<br>
efficacy of the HIV therapy and patient compliance.<br>
Bone marrow transplantation (BMT) retinopathv<br>
Bone marrow transplantation retinopathy was first reported in 1983. It typically occurs within<br>
six months, but it can occur as late as 62 months after BMT. Risk factors such as diabetes and<br>
hypertension may facilitate the development of BMT retinopathy by heightening the ischemic<br>
microvasculopathy. There is no known age, gender or race predilection for development of<br>
BMT retinopathy. Patients present with decreased visual acuity and/or visual field deficit.<br>
Posterior segment findings are typically bilateral and symmetric. Clinical manifestations include<br>
multiple cotton wool spots, telangiectasia, microaneurysms, macular edema, hard exudates and<br>
retinal hemorrhages. Fluorescein angiography demonstrates capillary nonperfusion and dropout,<br>
intraretinal microvascular abnormalities, microaneurysms and macular edema. Although the<br>
precise etiology of BMT retinopathy has not been elucidated, it appears to be affected by several<br>
factors: cyclosporine toxicity, total body irradiation (TBI), and chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
Cyclosporine is a powerful immunomodulatory agent that suppresses graft-versus-host immune<br>
response. It may lead to endothelial cell injury and neurologic side effects, and as a result, it has<br>
been suggested as the cause of BMT retinopathy. However, BMT retinopathy can develop in the<br>
absence of cyclosporine use, and cyclosporine has not been shown to cause BMT retinopathy in<br>
autologous or syngeneic bone marrow recipients. Cyclosporine does not, therefore, appear to be<br>
the sole cause of BMT retinopathy. Total body irradiation (TBI) has also been implicated as the<br>
cause of BMT retinopathy. Radiation injures the retinal microvasculature and leads to ischemic<br>
vasculopathy. Variables such as the total dose of radiation and the time interval between<br>
radiation and bone marrow ablation appear to be important. However, BMT retinopathy can<br>
occur in patients who did not receive TBI, and BMT retinopathy is not observed in solid organ<br>
transplant recipients who received similar doses of radiation. Thus, TBI is not the sole cause, but<br>
it is another contributing factor in development of BMT retinopathy. Chemotherapeutic agents<br>
have been suggested as a potential contributing factor in BMT retinopathy. Medications such as<br>
cisplatin, carmustine, and cyclophosphamide can cause ocular side effects including<br>
papilledema, optic neuritis, visual field deficit and cortical blindness. It has been suggested that<br>
these chemotherapeutic drugs may predispose patients to radiation-induced retinal damages and<br>
enhance the deleterious effect of radiation. In general, patients with BMT retinopathy have a<br>
good prognosis. The retinopathy usually resolves within two to four months after stopping or<br>
lowering the dosage of cyclosporine. In one report, 69 percent of patients experienced complete<br>
resolution of the retinal findings, and 46 percent of patients fully recovered their baseline visual<br>
acuity. Because of the favorable prognosis and relatively non-progressive nature of BMT<br>
retinopathy, aggressive intervention is usually not necessary.<br>
Ischemic conditions<br>
Ischemia can be divided into 2 categories: the first involves the accelerated atherosclerosis that<br>
occurs commonly in patients with diabetes, i.e., in the femoral, popliteal, and posterior tibial<br>
arteries. These vessels, often only 1 or 2 cm in diameter, can develop atherosclerotic plaque,<br>
which seriously decreases blood flow. After large vessels become completely occluded, stroke,<br>
myocardial infarction, ischemia, and nonhealing diabetic foot ulcers can occur. This form of<br>
ischemia is essentially a large-vessel disease.<br>
Post Stroke Dementia<br>
25% of people have dementia after a stroke with many others developing dementia over the<br>
following 5 to 10 years. In addition, many individuals experience more subtle impairments of<br>
their higher brain functions (such as planning skills and speed of processing information) and<br>
are at very high risk of subsequently developing dementia. Very small strokes in the deep parts<br>
of the brain in this process (called microvascular disease) seem to be essential in the process<br>
leading to an identified pattern of brain atrophy specific to post-stroke dementia.<br>
Ocular Ischemic Syndrome<br>
Patients suffering from ocular ischemic syndrome (OIS) are generally elderly, ranging in age<br>
from the 50s to 80s. Males are affected twice as commonly as females. The patient is only rarely<br>
asymptomatic. Decreased vision occurs at presentation in 90 percent of cases, and 40 percent of<br>
patients have attendant eye pain. There may also be an attendant or antecedent history of<br>
transient ischemic attacks or amaurosis fugax. Patients also have significant known or unknown<br>
systemic disease at the time of presentation. The most commonly encountered systemic diseases<br>
are hypertension, diabetes, ischemic heart disease, stroke, and peripheral vascular disease. To a<br>
lesser extent, patients manifest OIS as a result of giant cell arteritis (GCA).<br>
Unilateral findings are present in 80 percent of cases. Common findings may include advanced<br>
unilateral cataract, anterior segment inflammation, asymptomatic anterior chamber reaction,<br>
macular edema, dilated but non-tortuous retinal veins, mid-peripheral dot and blot hemorrhages,<br>
cotton wool spots, exudates, and neovascularization of the disc and retina. There may also be<br>
spontaneous arterial pulsation, elevated intraocular pressure, and neovascularization of the iris<br>
and angle with neovascular glaucoma (NVG). While the patient may exhibit anterior segment<br>
neovascularization, ocular hypotony may occur due to low arterial perfusion to the ciliary body.<br>
Occasionally, there is visible retinal emboli (Hollenhorst plaques).<br>
The findings in OIS are caused by internal carotid artery atheromatous ulceration and stenosis at<br>
the bifurcation of the common carotid artery. Five percent of patients with internal artery<br>
stenosis develop OIS. However, OIS only occurs if the degree of stenosis exceeds 90 percent.<br>
Stenosis of the carotid artery reduces perfusion pressure to the eye, resulting in the abovementioned<br>
ischemic phenomena. Once stenosis reaches 90 percent, the perfusion pressure in the<br>
central retinal artery (CRA) drops only to 50 percent. Often, the reduced arterial pressure<br>
manifests as spontaneous pulsation of the CRA. The findings are variable and may include any<br>
or all of the above findings.<br>
Patients with OIS have significant systemic disease that must be assessed. Cardiac death is the<br>
primary cause of mortality in patients with OIS—the five-year mortality rate is 40 percent. For<br>
this reason, patients with OIS must be referred to a cardiologist for complete serology, EKG,<br>
ECG, and carotid evaluation.<br>
Microvascular Diseases of the Kidney<br>
The kidney is involved in a number of discreet clinicopathologic conditions that affect systemic<br>
and renal microvasculature. Certain of these conditions are characterized by primary injury to<br>
endothelial cells, such as:<br>
• hemolylic-uremic syndrome (HUS) and ihrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura<br>
(TTP) HUS and TTP are closely related diseases characterized by<br>
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and variable organ impairment Traditionally,<br>
the diagnosis of HUS is made when renal failure is a predominant feature of the<br>
syndrome, as is common in children. In adults, neurologic impairment frequently<br>
predominates and the syndrome is then referred to as TTP. Thrombotic<br>
microangiopathy is the underlying pathologic lesion in both syndromes, and the<br>
clinical and laboratory findings in patients with either HUS or TTP overlap to a<br>
large extent. This has prompted several investigators to regard the two syndromes<br>
as a continuum of a single disease entity. Pathogenesis: Experimental data<br>
strongly suggest that endothelial cell injury is the primary event in the<br>
pathogenesis of HUS/TTP. Endothelial damage triggers a cascade of events that<br>
includes local intravascular coagulation, fibrin deposition, and platelet activation<br>
and aggregation. The end result is the histopathologic finding of thrombotic<br>
microangiopathy common to the different forms of the HUS/TTP syndrome. If<br>
HUS/TTP is left untreated, the mortality rate approaches 90%. Supportive<br>
therapy—including dialysis, antihypertensive medications, blood transfusions,<br>
and management of neurologic complications—contributes to the improved<br>
survival of patients with HUS/TTP. Adequate fluid balance and bowel rest are<br>
important in treating typical HUS associated with diarrhea.<br>
• radiation nephritis - The long-term consequences of renal irradiation in excess<br>
of 2500 rad can be divided into five clinical syndromes:<br>
(i)Acute radiation nephritis occurs in approximately 40% of patients after a latency<br>
period of 6 to 13 months. It is characterized clinically by abrupt onset of hypertension,<br>
proteinuria, edema, and progressive renal failurein most cases leading to end-stage kidneys.<br>
(ii)Chronic radiation nephritis, conversely, has a latency period that varies between 18<br>
months and 14 years after the initial insult. It is insidious in onset and is characterized by<br>
hypertension, proteinuria, and gradual loss of renal function.<br>
(iii)The third syndrome manifests 5 to 19 years after exposure to radiation as benign<br>
proteinuria with normal renal function<br>
(iv)A fourth group of patients exhibits only benign hypertension 2 to 5 years later and<br>
may have variable proteinuria. Late malignant hypertension arises 18 months to 11 years<br>
after irradiation in patients with either chronic radiation nephritis or benign hypertension.<br>
Removal of the affected kidney reversed the hypertension. Radiation-induced damage to the<br>
renal arteries with subsequent renovascular hypertension has been reported.<br>
(v)A syndrome of renal insufficiency analogous to acute radiation nephritis has been<br>
observed in bone marrow transplantation (BMT) patients who were treated with total-body<br>
irradiation (TBI).<br>
It has been reported that irradiation causes endothelial dysfunction but spares vascular smooth<br>
muscle cells in the early postradiation phase. Radiation could directly damage DNA, leading to<br>
decreased regeneration of these cells and denudement of the basement membrane in the<br>
glomerular capillaries and tubules. How this initial insult eventually leads to<br>
glomerulosclerosis, tubule atrophy, and interstitial fibrosis is unclear. It is postulated that<br>
degeneration of the endothelial cell layer may result in intravascular thrombosis in capillaries<br>
and smaller arterioles. This intrarenal angiopathy would then explain the progressive renal<br>
fibrosis and the hypertension that characterize radiation nephritis. A recent study of irradiated<br>
mouse kidneys showed a dose-dependent increase in leukocytes in the renal cortex, suggesting<br>
a role for inflammatory processes in radiation-induced nephritis.<br>
In other kidney diseases, the microvasculature of the kidney is involved in autoimmune<br>
disorders, such as systemic sclerosis (scleroderma). Kidney involvement in systemic sclerosis<br>
manifests as a slowly progressing chronic renal disease or as scleroderma renal crisis (SRC),<br>
which is characterized by malignant hypertension and acute azotemia. It is postulated that SRC<br>
is caused by a Raynaud-like phenomenon in the kidney. Severe vasospasm leads to cortical<br>
ischemia and enhanced production of renin and angiotensin II, which in turn perpetuate renal<br>
vasoconstriction. Hormonal changes (pregnancy), physical and emotional stress, or cold<br>
temperature may trigger the Raynaud-like arterial vasospasm. The role of the renin-angiotensin<br>
system in perpetuating renal ischemia is underscored by the significant benefit of ACE<br>
inhibitors in treating SRC. In patients with SRC who progress to severe renal insufficiency<br>
despite antihypertensive treatment, dialysis becomes a necessity. Both peritoneal dialysis and<br>
hemodialysis have been employed. The End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD) Network report on<br>
311 patients with systemic sclerosis-induced ESRD dialyzed between 1983 and 1985 revealed<br>
a 33% survival rate at 3 years.<br>
The renal microcirculation can also be affected in sickle cell disease, to which the kidney is<br>
particularly susceptible because of the low oxygen tension attained in the deep vessels of the<br>
renal medulla as a result of countercurrent transfer of oxygen along the vasa recta. The smaller<br>
renal arteries and arterioles can also be the site of thromboembolic injury from cholesterolcontaining<br>
material dislodged from the walls of the large vessels.<br>
Taken as a group, diseases that cause transient or permanent occlusion of renal<br>
microvasculature uniformly result in disruption of glomerular perfusion, and hence of the<br>
glomerular filtration rate, thereby constituting a serious threat to systemic homeostasis.<br>
Acute Renal Failure (ARF)<br>
ARF can be caused by microvascular or macrovascular disease (major renal artery occlusion or<br>
severe abdominal aortic disease). The classic microvascular diseases often present with<br>
microangiopathic hemolysis and acute renal failure occurring because of glomerular capillary<br>
thrombosis or occlusion, often with accompanying thrombocytopenia. Typical examples of<br>
these diseases include:<br>
a) Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura - The classic pentad in thrombotic<br>
thrombocytopenic purpura includes fever, neurologic changes, renal failure,<br>
microangiopathic hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia.<br>
b) Hemolvtic uremic syndrome - Hemolytic uremic syndrome is similar to thrombotic<br>
thrombocytopenic purpura but does not present with neurologic changes.<br>
c) HELLP syndrome (hemolvsis. elevated liver enzymes and low platelets). HELLP<br>
syndrome is a type of hemolytic uremic syndrome that occurs in pregnant women with<br>
the addition of transaminase elevations.<br>
Acute renal failure can present in all medical settings but is predominantly acquired in hospitals.<br>
The condition develops in 5 percent of hospitalized patients, and approximately 0.5 percent of<br>
hospitalized patients require dialysis. Over the past 40 years, the survival rate for acute renal<br>
failure has not improved, primarily because affected patients are now older and have more<br>
comorbid conditions. Infection accounts for 75 percent of deaths in patients with acute renal<br>
failure, and cardio-respiratory complications are the second most common cause of death.<br>
Depending on the severity of renal failure, the mortality rate can range from 7 percent to as high<br>
as 80 percent. Acute renal failure can be divided into three categories: Prerenal, intrinsic and<br>
postrenal ARF. Intrinsic ARF is subdivided into four categories: tubular disease, glomerular<br>
disease, vascular disease (includes microvascular) and interstitial disease.<br>
Progressive Renal Disease<br>
There is evidence that progressive renal disease is characterized by a progressive loss of the<br>
microvasculature. The loss of the microvasculature correlates directly with the development of<br>
glomerular and tubulointerstitial scarring. The mechanism is mediated in part by a reduction in<br>
the endothelial proliferative response, and this impairment in capillary repair is mediated by<br>
alteration in the local expression of both angiogenic (vascular endothelial growth factor) and<br>
antiangiogenic (thrombospondin 1) factors in the kidney. The alteration in balance of angiogenic<br>
growth factors is mediated by both macrophage-associated cytokines (interleukin-lfi) and<br>
vasoactive mediators. Finally, there is intriguing evidence that stimulation of angiogenesis<br>
and/or capillary repair may stabilize renal function and slow progression and that this benefit<br>
occurs independently of effects on BP or proteinuria.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in some of its embodiments, concerns inhibition of the RTP801 gene or<br>
polypeptide for the treatment of eye diseases, respiratory disorders and microvascular disorders,<br>
inter alia. As will be described herein, the preferred inhibitors to be used with the present invention<br>
are biological molecules.<br>
Without being bound by theory, the inventors of the present invention have found that RTP801<br>
is involved in various disease states including microvascular disorders, eye diseases, respiratory<br>
disorders , and spinal cord injury and disease, and it would be beneficial to inhibit RTP801 in<br>
order to treat any of said diseases or disorders. Methods, molecules and compositions which<br>

may be beneficially employed in the treatment of a patient suffering from any of said conditions.<br>
The present invention provides methods and compositions for inhibiting expression of the<br>
RTP801 gene in vivo. In general, the method includes administering oligoribonucleotides,<br>
such as small interfering RNAs (i. e., siRNAs) that are targeted to a particular mRNA and<br>

limited to any conditions involving choroidal neovascularization (CNV), wet and dry AMD,<br>
ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angiod streaks, ruptures in Bruch's membrane, myopic<br>
degeneration, ocular tumors, retinal degenerative diseases and retinal vein occlusion<br>
(RVO). Some conditions disclosed herein, such as DR, which may be treated according to<br>
the methods of the present invention have been regarded as either a microvascular disorder<br>
and an eye disease, or both, under the definitions presented herein.<br>
"RTP801 gene" refers to the RTP801 coding sequence open reading frame, as shown in Figure 1<br>
(SEQ ID NO:1), or any homologous sequence thereof preferably having at least 70% identity,<br>
more preferable 80% identity, even more preferably 90% or 95% identity. This encompasses<br>
any sequences derived from SEQ ID NO:1 which have undergone mutations, alterations or<br>
modifications as described herein. Thus, in a preferred embodiment RTP801 is encoded by a<br>
nucleic acid sequence according to SEQ. ID. NO. 1. It is also within the present invention that<br>
the nucleic acids according to the present invention are only complementary and identical,<br>
respectively, to a part of the nucleic acid coding for RTP801 as, preferably, the first stretch and<br>
first strand is typically shorter than the nucleic acid according to the present invention. It is also<br>
to be acknowledged that based on the amino acid sequence of RTP801 any nucleic acid<br>
sequence coding for such amino acid sequence can be perceived by the one skilled in the art<br>
based on the genetic code. However, due to the assumed mode of action of the nucleic acids<br>
according to the present invention, it is most preferred that the nucleic acid coding for RTP801,<br>
preferably the mRNA thereof, is the one present in the organism, tissue and/or cell, respectively,<br>
where the expression of RTP801 is to be reduced.<br>
"RTP801 polypeptide" refers to the polypeptide of the RTP801 gene, and is understood to<br>
include, for the purposes of the instant invention, the terms "RTP779", "REDD1", "Ddit4",<br>
"FLJ20500", "Dig2", and "PRF1", derived from any organism, optionally man, splice variants<br>
and fragments thereof retaining biological activity, and homologs thereof, preferably having at<br>
least 70%, more preferably at least 80%, even more preferably at least 90% or 95% homology<br>
thereto. In addition, this term is understood to encompass polypeptides resulting from minor<br>
alterations in the RTP801 coding sequence, such as, inter alia, point mutations, substitutions,<br>
deletions and insertions which may cause a difference in a few amino acids between the<br>
resultant polypeptide and the naturally occurring RTP801. Polypeptides encoded by nucleic acid<br>
sequences which bind to the RTP801 coding sequence or genomic sequence under conditions of<br>
highly stringent hybridization, which are well-known in the art (for example Ausubel et al.,<br>
Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Baltimore, Maryland (1988),<br>
updated in 1995 and 1998), are also encompassed by this term. Chemically modified RTP801 or<br>
chemically modified fragments of RTP801 are also included in the term, so long as the<br>
biological activity is retained. RTP801 preferably has or comprises an amino acid sequence<br>
according to SEQ. ID. NO. 2. It is acknowledged that there might be differences in the amino<br>
acid sequence among various tissues of an organism and among different organisms of one<br>
species or among different species to which the nucleic acid according to the present invention<br>
can be applied in various embodiments of the present invention. However, based on the<br>
technical teaching provided herein, the respective sequence can be taken into consideration<br>
accordingly when designing any of the nucleic acids according to the present invention-<br>
Particular fragments of RTP801 include amino acids 1-50, 51-100,103-150, 151-200 and 201-<br>
232 of the sequence shown in Figure 2. Further particular fragments of RTP801 include amino<br>
acids 25-74, 75-124, 125-174,175-224 and 225-232 of the sequence shown in Figure 2.<br>
RTP801 as used herein is a protein described, among others, in WO 99/09046. RTP801 which is<br>
also referred to as RTP801, has been described as a transcriptional target of HIF-la by Shoshani T<br>
et al. (Shoshani et al., 2002, Mol Cell Biol, 22, 2283-93). Furthermore the study by Ellisen et al.<br>
(Ellisen et al., Mol Cell, 10, 995-1005) has identified RTP801 as a p53-dependent DNA damage<br>
response gene and as a p63-dependent gene involved in epithelial differentiation. Also, RTP801<br>
mirrors the tissue-specific pattern of the p53 family member p63, is effective similar to or in<br>
addition to TP 63, is an inhibitor to in vitro differentiation , and is involved in the regulation of<br>
reactive oxygen species. Apart from that, RTP801 is responsive to hypoxia-responsive transcription<br>
factor hypoxia-inducible factor 1 (HIF-1) and is typically up-regulated during hypoxia both in vitro<br>
and in vivo in an animal model of ischemic stroke. RTP801 appears to function in the regulation of<br>
reactive oxygen species (ROS) and ROS levels and reduced sensitivity to oxidative stress are both<br>
increased following ectopic expression RTP801 (Ellisen et al. 2002, supra; Soshani et al. 2002,<br>
supra). Preferably, RTP801 is a biologically active RTP801 protein which preferably exhibits at<br>
least one of those characteristics, preferable two or more and most preferably each and any<br>
of these characteristics.<br>
A related gene to RTP801 is RT801L, also referred to as "REDD2", was discovered by the<br>
inventors of the present invention. RTP801L is homologous to RTP801, and reacts in a similar<br>
manner to oxidative stress; thus, RTP801L probably possesses some similar functions with<br>
RTP801.<br>
Without being bound by theory, RTP801 being a stress-inducible protein (responding to<br>
hypoxia, oxidative stress, termal stress, ER stress) is a factor acting in fine-tuning of cell<br>
response to energy disbalance. As such, it is a target suitable for treatment of any disease where<br>
cells should be rescued from apoptosis due to stressful conditions (e.g. diseases accompanied by<br>
death of normal cells) or where cells, which are adapted to stressful conditions due to changes in<br>
RTP801 expression (e.g. cancer cells), should be killed. In the latter case, RTP801 may be<br>
viewed as a survival factor for cancer cells and its inhibitors may treat cancer as a monotherapy<br>
or as sensitising drugs in compbination with chemotherapy or radiotherapy.<br>
The term "polynucleotide" refers to any molecule composed of DNA nucleotides, RNA<br>
nucleotides or a combination of both types, i.e. that comprises two or more of the bases<br>
guanidine, cytosine, thymidine, adenine, uracil or inosine, inter alia. A polynucleotide may<br>
include natural nucleotides, chemically modified nucleotides and synthetic nucleotides, or<br>
chemical analogs thereof. The term includes "oligonucleotides" and encompasses "nucleic<br>
acids".<br>
The term "amino acid" refers to a molecule which consists of any one of the 20 naturally occurring<br>
amino acids, amino acids which have been chemically modified (see below), or synthetic amino<br>
acids.<br>
The term "polypeptide" refers to a molecule composed of two or more amino acids residues.<br>
The term includes peptides, polypeptides, proteins and peptidomimetics.<br>
A "peptidomimetic" is a compound containing non-peptidic structural elements that is capable of<br>
mimicking the biological action(s) of a natural parent peptide. Some of the classical peptide<br>
characteristics such as enzymatically scissille peptidic bonds are normally not present in a<br>
peptidomimetic.<br>
By the term "dominant negative peptide" is meant a polypeptide encoded by a cDNA fragment<br>
that encodes for a part of a protein (see Herskowitz I.: Functional inactivation of genes by<br>
dominant negative mutations. Nature. 1987 Sep 17-23;329(6136):219-22. Review; Roninson IB<br>
et al., Genetic suppressor elements: new tools for molecular oncology—thirteenth Cornelius P.<br>
Rhoads Memorial Award Lecture. Cancer Res. 1995 Sep 15;55(18):4023). This peptide can<br>
have a different function from the protein from which it was derived. It can interact with the full<br>
protein and inhibit its activity or it can interact with other proteins and inhibit their activity in<br>
response to the full-length (parent) protein. Dominant negative means that the peptide is able to<br>
overcome the natural parent protein and inhibit its activity to give the cell a different<br>
characteristic, such as resistance or sensitization to death or any cellular phenotype of interest.<br>
For therapeutic intervention the peptide itself may be delivered as the active ingredient of a<br>
pharmaceutical composition, or the cDNA can be delivered to the cell utilizing known methods.<br>
Preparation of peptides and polvpeptides<br>
Polypeptides may be produced via several methods, for example:<br>
43<br>
1) Synthetically:<br>
Synthetic polypeptides can be made using a commercially available machine, using the known<br>
sequence of RTP801 or a portion thereof.<br>
2) Recombinant Methods:<br>
A preferred method of making the RTP801 polypeptides of fragments thereof is to clone a<br>
polynucleotide comprising the cDNA of the RTP801 gene into an expression vector and culture<br>
the cell harboring the vector so as to express the encoded polypeptide, and then purify the<br>
resulting polypeptide, all performed using methods known in the art as described in, for example,<br>
Marshak et al., "Strategies for Protein Purification and Characterization. A laboratory course<br>
manual" CSHL Press (1996). (in addition, see Bibl Haematol. 1965;23:1165-74 Appl Microbiol.<br>
1967 Jul; 15(4):851-6; Can J Biochem. 1968 May;46(5):441-4; Biochemistry. 1968<br>
Jul;7(7):2574-80; Arch Biochem Biophys. 1968 Sep 10;126(3):746-72; Biochem Biophys Res<br>
Commun. 1970 Feb 20;38(4):825-30).).<br>
The expression vector can include a promoter for controlling transcription of the heterologous<br>
material and can be either a constitutive or inducible promoter to allow selective transcription.<br>
Enhancers that can be required to obtain necessary transcription levels can optionally be<br>
included. The expression vehicle can also include a selection gene.<br>
Vectors can be introduced into cells or tissues by any one of a variety of methods known within<br>
the art. Such methods can be found generally described in Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning:<br>
A Laboratory Manual, Cold Springs Harbor Laboratory, New York (1989, 1992), in Ausubel et<br>
al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Baltimore, Maryland (1989),<br>
Vega et al., Gene Targeting, CRC Press, Ann Arbor, MI (1995), Vectors: A Survey of Molecular<br>
Cloning Vectors and Their Uses, Butterworths, Boston MA (1988) and Gilboa et al. (1986).<br>
3) Purification from natural sources:<br>
RTP801 polypeptide, or naturally occurring fragments thereof, can be purified from natural<br>
sources (such as tissues) using many methods known to one of ordinary skill in the art, such as<br>
for example: immuno-precipitation with anti- RTP801 antibody, or matrix-bound affinity<br>
chromatography with any molecule known to bind RTP801.<br>
Protein purification is practiced as is known in the art as described in, for example, Marshak et<br>
al., "Strategies for Protein Purification and Characterization. A laboratory course manual."<br>
CSHL Press (1996).<br>
By "biological effect of RTP801" or "RTP801 biological activity" is meant the effect of<br>
RTP801 in respiratory disorders, which may be direct or indirect, and includes, without being<br>
bound by theory, the effect of RTP801 on apoptosis of alveolar cells induced by hypoxic or<br>
hyperoxic conditions. The indirect effect includes, but is not limited to, RTP801 binding to or<br>
having an effect on one of several molecules, which are involved in a signal transduction<br>
cascade resulting in apoptosis.<br>
"Apoptosis" refers to a physiological type of cell death which results from activation of some<br>
cellular mechanisms, i.e. death that is controlled by the machinery of the cell. Apoptosis may, for<br>
example, be the result of activation of the cell machinery by an external trigger, e.g. a cytokine or<br>
anti-FAS antibody, which leads to cell death or by an internal signal. The term "programmed cell<br>
death" may also be used interchangeably with "apoptosis".<br>
"Apoptosis-related disease" refers to a disease whose etiology is related either wholly or<br>
partially to the process of apoptosis. The disease may be caused either by a malfunction of the<br>
apoptotic process (such as in cancer or an autoimmune disease) or by overactivity of the<br>
apoptotic process (such as in certain neurodegenerative diseases). Many diseases in which<br>
RTP801 is involved are apoptosis-related diseases. For example, apoptosis is a significant<br>
mechanism in dry AMD, whereby slow atrophy of photoreceptor and pigment epithelium cells,<br>
primarily in the central (macular) region of retina takes place. Neuroretinal apoptosis is also a<br>
significant mechanism in diabetic retinopathy.<br>
An "inhibitor" is a compound which is capable of inhibiting the activity of a gene or the product of<br>
such gene to an extent sufficient to achieve a desired biological or physiological effect. An<br>
"RTP801 inhibitor" is a compound which is capable of inhibiting the activity of the RTP801 gene<br>
or RTP801 gene product, particularly the human RTP801 gene or gene product. Such inhibitors<br>
include substances that affect the transcription or translation of the gene as well as substances that<br>
affect the activity of the gene product. An RTP801 inhibitor may also be an inhibitor of the<br>
RTP801 promoter. Examples of such inhibitors may include, inter alia: polynucleotides such as AS<br>
fragments, siRNA, or vectors comprising them; polypeptides such as dominant negatives,<br>
antibodies, and enzymes; catalytic RNAs such as ribozymes; and chemical molecules with a low<br>
molecular weight e.g. a molecular weight below 2000 daltons. Specific RTP801 inhibitors are<br>
given below.<br>
"Expression vector" refers to a vector that has the ability to incorporate and express heterologous<br>
DNA fragments in a foreign cell. Many prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression vectors are known<br>
and/or commercially available. Selection of appropriate expression vectors is within the knowledge<br>
of those having skill in the art.<br>
The term "antibody" refers to IgG, IgM, IgD, IgA, and IgE antibody, inter alia. The definition<br>
includes polyclonal antibodies or monoclonal antibodies. This term refers to whole antibodies or<br>
fragments of antibodies comprising an antigen-binding domain, e.g. antibodies without the Fc<br>
portion, single chain antibodies, miniantibodies, fragments consisting of essentially only the<br>
variable, antigen-binding domain of the antibody, etc. The term "antibody" may also refer to<br>
antibodies against polynucleotide sequences obtained by cDNA vaccination. The term also<br>
encompasses antibody fragments which retain the ability to selectively bind with their antigen or<br>
receptor and are exemplified as follows, inter alia:<br>
(1) Fab, the fragment which contains a monovalent antigen-binding fragment of an<br>
antibody molecule which can be produced by digestion of whole antibody with the<br>
enzyme papain to yield a light chain and a portion of the heavy chain;<br>
(2) (Fab')2, the fragment of the antibody that can be obtained by treating whole antibody<br>
with the enzyme pepsin without subsequent reduction; F(ab'2) is a dimer of two Fab<br>
fragments held together by two disulfide bonds;<br>
(3) Fv, defined as a genetically engineered fragment containing the variable region of the<br>
light chain and the variable region of the heavy chain expressed as two chains; and<br>
(4) Single chain antibody (SCA), defined as a genetically engineered molecule<br>
containing the variable region of the light chain and the variable region of the heavy<br>
chain linked by a suitable polypeptide linker as a genetically fused single chain<br>
molecule.<br>
By the term "epitope" as used in this invention is meant an antigenic determinant on an antigen<br>
to which the antibody binds. Epitopic determinants usually consist of chemically active surface<br>
groupings of molecules such as amino acids or sugar side chains and usually have specific threedimensional<br>
structural characteristics, as well as specific charge characteristics.<br>
Preparation of anti- RTP8Q1 antibodies<br>
Antibodies which bind to RTP801 or a fragment derived therefrom may be prepared using an<br>
intact polypeptide or fragments containing smaller polypeptides as the immunizing antigen. For<br>
example, it may be desirable to produce antibodies that specifically bind to the N- or C- terminal<br>
or any other suitable domains of the RTP801. The polypeptide used to immunize an animal can<br>
be derived from translated cDNA or chemical synthesis and can be conjugated to a carrier<br>
protein, if desired. Such commonly used carriers which are chemically coupled to the<br>
polypeptide include keyhole limpet hemocyanin (KLH), thyroglobulin, bovine serum albumin<br>
(BSA) and tetanus toxoid. The coupled polypeptide is then used to immunize the animal.<br>
If desired, polyclonal or monoclonal antibodies can be further purified, for example by binding<br>
to and elution from a matrix to which the polypeptide or a peptide to which the antibodies were<br>
raised is bound. Those skilled in the art know various techniques common in immunology for<br>
purification and/or concentration of polyclonal as well as monoclonal antibodies (Coligan et al,<br>
Unit 9, Current Protocols in Immunology, Wiley Interscience, 1994).<br>
Methods for making antibodies of all types, including fragments, are known in the art (See for<br>
example, Harlow and Lane, Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,<br>
New York (1988)). Methods of immunization, including all necessary steps of preparing the<br>
immunogen in a suitable adjuvant, determining antibody binding, isolation of antibodies,<br>
methods for obtaining monoclonal antibodies, and humanization of monoclonal antibodies are<br>
all known to the skilled artisan<br>
The antibodies may be humanized antibodies or human antibodies. Antibodies can be<br>
humanized using a variety of techniques known in the art including CDR- grafting (EP239,400:<br>
PCT publication WO.91/09967; U.S. patent Nos.5,225,539;5,530,101; and 5,585,089, veneering<br>
or resurfacing (EP 592,106; EP 519,596; Padlan, Molecular Immunology 28(4/5):489-498<br>
(1991); Studnicka et al., Protein Engineering 7(6):805-814 (1994); Roguska et al., PNAS<br>
91:969-973 (1994)), and chain shuffling (U.S. Patent No. 5,565,332).<br>
The monoclonal antibodies as defined include antibodies derived from one species (such as<br>
murine, rabbit, goat, rat, human, etc.) as well as antibodies derived from two (or more) species,<br>
such as chimeric and humanized antibodies.<br>
Completely human antibodies are particularly desirable for therapeutic treatment of human<br>
patients. Human antibodies can be made by a variety of methods known in the art including<br>
phage display methods using antibody libraries derived from human immunoglobulin<br>
sequences. See also U.S. Patent Nos. 4,444,887 and 4,716,111; and PCT publications WO<br>
98/46645, WO 98/50433, WO 98/24893, WO 98/16654, WO 96/34096, WO 96/33735, and WO<br>
91/10741, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Additional information regarding all types of antibodies, including humanized antibodies,<br>
human antibodies and antibody fragments can be found in WO 01/05998, which is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Neutralizing antibodies can be prepared by the methods discussed above, possibly with an<br>
additional step of screening for neutralizing activity by, for example, a survival assay.<br>
The terms "chemical compound", "small molecule", "chemical molecule" "small chemical<br>
molecule" and "small chemical compound" are used interchangeably herein and are understood<br>
to refer to chemical moieties of any particular type which may be synthetically produced or<br>
obtained from natural sources and usually have a molecular weight of less than 2000 daltons,<br>
less than 1000 daltons or even less than 600 daltons.<br>
The present invention also relates to functional nucleic acids comprising a double-stranded<br>
structure, their use for the manufacture of a medicament, a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising such functional nucleic acids and a method for the treatment of a patient.<br>
Hypoxia has been recognised as a key element in the pathomechanism of quite a number of<br>
diseases such as stroke, emphysema and infarct which are associated with sub-optimum oxygen<br>
availability and tissue damaging responses to the hypoxia conditions. In fast-growing tissues,<br>
including tumor, a sub-optimum oxygen availability is compensated by undesired neoangiogenesis.<br>
Therefore, at least in case of cancer diseases, the growth of vasculature is<br>
undesired.<br>
In view of this, the inhibition of angiogenesis and vascular growth, respectively, is subject to<br>
intense research. Already today some compounds are available which inhibit undesired<br>
angiogenesis and vascular growth. Some of the more prominent compounds are those inhibiting<br>
VEGF and the VEGF receptor. In both cases, the effect of VEGF is avoided by either blocking<br>
VEGF as such, for example by using an antibody directed against VEGF such as pursued by<br>
Genentech's AVASTIN (monoclonal AB specific for VEGF) (Ferrara N.; Endocr Rev. 2004<br>
Aug;25(4):581-611), or by blocking the corresponding receptor, i. e. the VEGF receptor<br>
(Traxler P; Cancer Res. 2004 Jul 15;64(14):4931-41; or Stadler WM et al., Clin Cancer Res.<br>
2004 May 15;10(10):3365-70).<br>
As, however, angiogenesis and the growth of vasculature is a very basic and vital process in any<br>
animal and human being, the effect of this kind of compound has to be focused at the particular<br>
site where angiogenesis and vascular growth is actually undesired which renders appropriate<br>
targeting or delivery a critical issue in connection with this kind of therapeutic approach.<br>
It is thus an objective of the present invention to provide further means for the treatment of<br>
diseases involving undesired growth of vasculature and angiogenesis, respectively.<br>
By "small interfering RNA" (siRNA) is meant an RNA molecule which decreases or silences<br>
(prevents) the expression of a gene/ mRNA of its endogenous cellular counterpart. The term is<br>
understood to encompass "RNA interference" (RNAi). RNA interference (RNAi) refers to the<br>
process of sequence-specific post transcriptional gene silencing in mammals mediated by small<br>
interfering RNAs (siRNAs) (Fire et al, 1998, Nature 391. 806). The corresponding process in<br>
plants is commonly referred to as specific post transcriptional gene silencing or RNA silencing<br>
and is also referred to as quelling in fungi. The RNA interference response may feature an<br>
endonuclease complex containing an siRNA, commonly referred to as an RNA-induced<br>
silencing complex (RISC), which mediates cleavage of single-stranded RNA having sequence<br>
complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA duplex. Cleavage of the target RNA may<br>
take place in the middle of the region complementary to the antisense strand of the siRNA<br>
duplex (Elbashir et al 2001, Genes Dev., 15. 188). For recent information on these terms and<br>
proposed mechanisms, see Bernstein E., Denli AM., Harmon GJ: The rest is silence. RNA. 2001<br>
Nov;7(l 1):1509-21; and Nishikura K.: A short primer on RNAi: RNA-directed RNA polymerase<br>
acts as a key catalyst. Cell. 2001 Nov 16;107(4):415-8. Examples of siRNA molecules which<br>
may be used in the present invention are given in Tables A-C.<br>
During recent years, RNAi has emerged as one of the most efficient methods for inactivation of<br>
genes (Nature Reviews, 2002, v.3, p.737-47; Nature, 2002, v.418,p.244-51). As a method, it is<br>
based on the ability of dsRNA species to enter a specific protein complex, where it is then<br>
targeted to the complementary cellular RNA and specifically degrades it. In more detail,<br>
dsRNAs are digested into short (17-29 bp) inhibitory RNAs (siRNAs) by type III RNAses<br>
(DICER, Drosha, etc) (Nature, 2001, v.409, p.363-6; Nature, 2003, .425, p.415-9). These<br>
fragments and complementary mRNA are recognized by the specific RISC protein complex.<br>
The whole process is culminated by endonuclease cleavage of target mRNA (Nature Reviews,<br>
2002, v.3, p.737-47; Curr Opin Mol Ther. 2003 Jun;5(3):217-24).<br>

siRNAs of the present invention<br>
General specifications of siRNAs of the present invention<br>
Generally, the siRNAs used in the present invention comprise a ribonucleic acid comprising a<br>
double stranded structure, whereby the double- stranded structure comprises a first strand and a<br>
second strand, whereby the first strand comprises a first stretch of contiguous nucleotides and<br>
whereby said first stretch is at least partially complementary to a target nucleic acid, and the<br>
second strand comprises a second stretch of contiguous nucleotides and whereby said second<br>
stretch is at least partially identical to a target nucleic acid, whereby said first strand and/or said<br>
second strand comprises a plurality of groups of modified nucleotides having a modification at<br>
the 2'-position whereby within the strand each group of modified nucleotides is flanked on one or<br>
both sides by a flanking group of nucleotides whereby the flanking nucleotides forming the<br>
flanking group of nucleotides is either an unmodified nucleotide or a nucleotide having a<br>
modification different from the modification of the modified nucleotides. Further, said first<br>
strand and/or said second strand may comprise said plurality of modified nucleotides and may<br>

specific for RTP801 is a suitable means of inhibiting angiogenesis/ growth of vasculature and<br>
vascular leakage, (both from the existing vasculature and from growing vasculature). Additionally,<br>
this application discloses (without being bound by theory) that RTP801 being a stress-inducible<br>
protein (induced by hypoxia, oxidative stress, thermal stress, ER stress) is a factor acting in finetuning<br>
of cell response to energy disbalance. Thus inhibition of RTP801 by such double-stranded<br>
nucleic acid is suitable for treatment of any disease where cells should be rescued from apoptosis<br>
due to stressful conditions (e.g. diseases accompanied by death of normal cells) or where cells<br>
adapted to stressful conditions due to changes in RTP801 expression, should be killed (e.g. tumor<br>
cells). In the latter case, upon inhibiting RTP801 through such double-stranded nucleic acid, this<br>
survival factor with anti-apoptotic function in hypoxic cells, more particularly hypoxic cancer cells,<br>
is made ineffective thus allowing the cells devoid of RTP801- mediated protection to be driven into<br>
apoptosis. This can additionally occur when other apoptosis promoting factors are present Such<br>
other apoptosis promoting factors include, among others, chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In<br>
other words, the double-stranded nucleic acid according to the present invention may be effective<br>
alone in cancer treatment (monotherapy) and also as a supplementary therapy.<br>
Such double-stranded structure comprises a first strand and a second strand, whereby the first<br>
strand comprises a first stretch of contiguous nucleotides and the second strand comprises a<br>
second stretch of contiguous nucleotides, whereby the first stretch is either complementary or<br>
identical to a nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801 and whereby the second stretch is either<br>
identical or complementary to a nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801. By particularly using<br>
RTP801 as a target for such kind of double-stranded nucleic acid, it is thus also possible to<br>
immediately address a target in the cascade involved in the growth and development of<br>
vasculature and angiogenesis, respectively, and thus in a different way compared to the pathway<br>
used by VEGF inhibitors such as VEGF antibodies. Without wishing to be bound by any theory,<br>
the present inventors assume that the nucleic acid according to the present invention may exert<br>
its function in those cells which provide for a background which is involved in or observed in<br>
connection with any disease where undesired, particularly hypoxia induced angiogenesis and/or<br>
growth or development of vasculature occurs. This understanding is supported by the finding<br>
that RTP801 knock-out mice do not exhibit any phenotype different from wildtype mice under<br>
non-hypoxic conditions. Only upon induction of hypoxia as observed in a diseased condition<br>
such as, e. g., tumor growth, the RTP801 related knock-out results in a pathology similar to the<br>
one observed in humans suffering from this kind of disease.<br>
It is to be understood that the nucleic acid according to the present invention is preferably a<br>
functional nucleic acid. As used herein, the term functional nucleic acid preferably means a<br>
nucleic acid the function of which is different from being active in the cell as a template for the<br>
transcription of any hnRNA, mRNA, or any other transcription product, whereby either said<br>
hnRNA, mRMA or any other transcription product, respectively, or the nucleic acid according to<br>
the present invention is subject to a translation process, preferably a cellular translation process,<br>
resulting in a biologically active RTP801 protein. It is to be acknowledged that a functional<br>
nucleic acid as preferably used herein is capable of reducing the expression of a target nucleic<br>
acid. More preferably, such reduction is based on a post-transcriptional gene silencing process<br>
of the target nucleic acid. Even more preferably such reduction is based on RNA interference. A<br>
most preferred form of the functional nucleic acid is an siRNA molecule or any further molecule<br>
having the same effect as an siRNA molecule. Such further molecule is selected from the group<br>
comprising siRNAs, synthetic siRNAs, shRNAs and synthetic shRNAs. As used herein siRNAs<br>
may additionally comprise expression vector derived siRNAs, whereby the expression vector is<br>
in a preferred embodiment a virus such as Adenoviruses, Adenoassociated viruses, Herpes<br>
viruses and Lentiviruses. As used herein shRNA preferably means short hairpin RNAs. Such<br>
shRNA can be made synthetically or can be generated using vector encoded expression systems,<br>
preferably using RNA polymerase III promoters. In connection therewith it is to be<br>
acknowledged that the functional nucleic acid according to the present invention is directed to<br>
RTP801 which is also preferably referred to herein as the target and the nucleic acid coding for<br>
said target as the target nucleic acid.<br>
As preferably used herein, the double-stranded structure of the nucleic acid according to the<br>
present invention .comprises any double-stranded structure, whereby such double-stranded<br>
structure is preferably generated by the first stretch and the second stretch provided by the<br>
nucleic acid having the basic design. The double-stranded structure may comprise one or several<br>
mismatches. Such double-stranded structure is formed by Watson-Crick-base pairing and/or<br>
Hoogsteen base pairing and/or similar base pairing mechanisms. Based on the basic design of<br>
the nucleic acid according to the present invention it is preferred that one stretch, is in antisense<br>
orientation to a nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801 or a part thereof, whereas the other<br>
stretch is in the sense orientation to a nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801 or a part thereof.<br>
Because of this, one stretch is complementary to a nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801 or<br>
a part thereof, and the other stretch is identical to a nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801 or<br>
a part thereof. In connection therewith it is to be acknowledged that the term identical, of<br>
course, means also partially identical, whereby the identity, expressed as homology, is at least<br>
80%, preferably 90%, more preferably 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, 99% or 100%. Similar to the<br>
definition of identity, complementarity can be defined in terms of homology, whereby such<br>
homology is of the same range as the identity if the complementary strand would be translated<br>
into the identical strand according to Watson-Crick base pairing rules. In an alternative<br>
embodiment, one stretch is identical to a nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801 or a part<br>
thereof and the other stretch is complementary to a nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801 or<br>
a part thereof.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid according to the present invention is downregulating<br>
RTP801 function. Down-regulation of RTP801 function preferably happens by<br>
reduction in the level of expression at the protein level and/or the mRNA level, whereby such<br>
reduced level of expression, preferably at the protein level, can be as little as 5% and be as high<br>
as 100%, with reference to an expression under conditions where the nucleic acid according to<br>
the present invention is not administered or is not functionally active. Such conditions are<br>
preferably the conditions of or as present in an expression system, preferably an expression<br>
system for RTP801. Such expression system is preferably a translation system which can be an<br>
in vitro translation system, more preferably a cell, organ and/or organism. It is more preferred<br>
that the organism is a multicellular organism, more preferably a mammal, whereby such<br>
mammal is preferably selected from the group comprising man, monkey, mouse, rat, guinea pig,<br>
rabbit, cat, dog, sheep, cow, horse, cattle and pig. In connection with the down-regulation it is to<br>
be acknowledged that said down-regulation may be a function of time, i. e. the down-regulation<br>
effect is not necessarily observed immediately upon administration or functional activation of<br>
the nucleic acids according to the present invention, but may be deferred in time as well as in<br>
space, i. e. in various cells, tissues and/or organs. Such deferment may range from 5%-100%,<br>
preferably 10 to 50%. It will be acknowledged by the ones skilled in the art that a 5 % reduction<br>
for a longer time period might be as effective as a 100% reduction over a shorter time period. It<br>
will also be acknowledged by the ones skilled in the art that such deferment strongly depends on<br>
the particular functional nucleic acid actually used, as well as on the target cell population and<br>
thus, ultimately, on the disease to be treated and/or prevented according to the technical teaching<br>
of the present application, insofar, a 5 % reduction-over a longer time period~might be as<br>
effective as 100% reduction over a shorter time period. It will also be acknowledged by the ones<br>
skilled in the art that the deferment can occur at any level as outlined above, i.e. a deferment in<br>
function, whereby such function is any function exhibited by RTP801, a deferment in protein<br>
expression or a deferment at mRNA expression level.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the first stretch comprises at least 14 nucleotides, preferably 14<br>
contiguous nucleotides. It will be acknowledged by the one skilled in the art that the first stretch<br>
should have a length which is suitable to allow for specifically addressing a nucleic acid<br>
sequence coding for RTP801 and more specifically the nucleic acid coding for RTP801 as<br>
present in the translation system where the expression of RTP801 is to be reduced. Again<br>
without wishing to be bound by any theory or any mode of action of the nucleic acid according<br>
to the present invention, it seems that there is an interaction between the nucleic acid according<br>
to the present invention and the nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801, preferably at the<br>
transcript level, i. e. upon generation of an mRNA from the respective nucleic acid sequence<br>
coding for RTP801. Due to the likelihood of any sequence of the nucleic acid according to the<br>
present invention being identical to or complementary to a sequence contained in the genome or<br>
transcriptome of the translation system, the length of the first stretch should thus be as long as to<br>
make sure that, under the assumption that some kind of base pairing between the nucleic acid<br>
coding for RTP801 and one of the strands of the nucleic acid according to the present invention<br>
actually occurs, only the sequence coding for RTP801 but no other coding sequence, preferably<br>
no other essential coding sequence, of the genome or the transcriptome is addressed for or by<br>
such base pairing. By this length, the occurrence of off-target effects can be reduced and<br>
preferably eliminated. To increase the stringency of this kind of specifically addressing RTP801<br>
and the nucleic acid sequence coding therefor, the first stretch preferably has a length of at least<br>
18 or 19 nucleotides. The upper limit for the length of the first stretch is preferably less than 50<br>
nucleotides, however, the length can be significantly longer and can comprise 100, 200 or even<br>
500 nucleotides or any length in-between. Apart from this, one skilled in the art will prefer to<br>
have a rather short first stretch, particularly in case the nucleic acid according to the present<br>
invention is chemically synthesised as the shorter the sequence is, the less time and material<br>
consuming the synthesis thereof will be and the lower will be the rate at which incorrect<br>
nucleotides are inserted into the respective sequence.-Another factor which is to be taken into<br>
consideration in connection with fixing the length of the first stretch is the fact that, typically at<br>
a length beyond 50 or more nucleotides, an unspecific interferon response may be observed. It<br>
depends on the particular condition to be treated whether this kind of unspecific interferon<br>
response is to be tolerated or not. For example, an interferon response could be tolerated if the<br>
interferon response and/or the expression of the interferon genes can be limited to the<br>
pathogenic cells.<br>
In view of this, more preferred lengths of the first stretch are from about 14 to 40 nucleotides, 18<br>
to 30 nucleotides, 19 to 27 nucleotides, 21 to 25 nucleotides and 19 to 23 nucleotides.<br>
The same considerations as outlined above for the first stretch are applicable to the second<br>
stretch which may thus comprise any length as described herein in connection with the first<br>
stretch. It is also within the present invention that the length of the first stretch is different from<br>
the length of the second stretch, however, it is preferred that both stretches have the same<br>
length.<br>
According to the basic design of the nucleic acid, the first stretch and second stretch are parts of<br>
the first strand and second strand, respectively, of the nucleic acid according to the present<br>
invention. It will be acknowledged that at either end, i. e. at the 5' end as well as the 3' end the<br>
first strand and/or second strand may comprise one or several nucleotides, preferably additional<br>
nucleotides, at any combination.<br>
In connection therewith it is to be acknowledged that those nucleotides of the individual strand<br>
going beyond the end(s) of the stretch corresponding to the respective strand can be used to<br>
further contribute to the complementarity and identity, respectively, of the stretch and thus to the<br>
specific addressing of the nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801.<br>
It will be acknowledged that, basically, based on the technical teaching provided herein, the<br>
nucleic acid according to the present invention can address any part of the nucleic acid sequence<br>
coding for RTP801, preferably coding for RTP801 in the translation system where the<br>
expression of RTP801 is to be reduced. Insofar, the present invention comprises any nucleic<br>
acid having the characteristics as defined herein, whereby the complementary and identical<br>
strands and stretches of the nucleic acid according to the present invention can basically start<br>
from any nucleotide of the nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801. Accordingly, under the<br>
proviso that the first stretch of the nucleic acid according to the present invention is<br>
complementary to the nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801, i. e. is the antisense strand<br>
thereof or is in antisense orientation thereto, the first nucleotide of said stretch, i. e. the most 5'<br>
terminal nucleotide corresponds, i. e. aligns to the last nucleotide of the sequence coding for<br>
RTP801 at the 3' end. In a further embodiment such most 5' terminal nucleotide corresponds to<br>
the penultimate nucleotide of the nucleic acid coding for RTP801 and so on until the last<br>
position is reached which, given the length of the antisense stretch, still allows that the antisense<br>
strand of the nucleic acid according to the present invention is complementary to the nucleic<br>
acid sequence coding for RTP801. Insofar, any nucleic acid according to the present invention is<br>
within the present invention which could be generated by scanning the nucleic acid sequence<br>
coding for RTP801 starting from the most 5' terminal nucleotide thereof and laying over the<br>
basic design of the nucleic acid according to the present invention and realising the<br>
characteristics for such nucleic acid according to the present invention. The same considerations<br>
are applicable to the embodiments disclosed herein where the complementarity and identity of<br>
the nucleic acid according to the present invention is not only provided by the first stretch and<br>
second stretch, respectively, but such complementarity and identity also involves one or more<br>
nucleotides beyond the first stretch and second stretch, respectively, then being part of the first<br>
strand and second strand, respectively.<br>
Of the various nucleic acids according to the present invention as disclosed herein, those with<br>
internal reference numbers 14, 22, 23, 25, 27, 39, 41, 42, 49 and 50 (see Table A) are<br>
particularly preferred. In connection therewith it is to be noted that those nucleic acids according<br>
to the present invention which can be used in both human and an animal model such as rat<br>
and/or mouse are particularly useful. The surprising advantage of these particular nucleic acids<br>
according to the present invention resides in the fact that they are effective both in human and in<br>
an animal model which means that the test results obtained in the animal model can be<br>
immediately transferred from the animal model to the human being and more particularly<br>
without the necessity to make any changes to the human sequence which would otherwise<br>
become necessary in case the nucleic acid according to the present invention was designed such<br>
as to comprise (a) sequence(s) which differ(s) between the species, more particularly the species<br>
used for animal model testing and man as the ultimate preferred organisms or patient. It is<br>
further preferred that these nucleic acids have a modification pattern as also described in the<br>
examples.<br>
However, it is also within the present invention that any of the sequences according to SEQ. ID.<br>
NOs. 3, 16-17, 22-27, 29, 41-46, 51-53, 66-67, 72-77, 79, 91-96 and 101-102 and respective<br>
combinations resulting in the nucleic acid molecules according to the present invention having<br>
internal reference numbers 14, 22, 23, 25, 27, 39, 41, 42, 49 and 50, is only partially contained<br>
in a further nucleic acid according to the present invention. Preferably, the further nucleic acids<br>
according to the present invention comprise at least 14 contiguous nucleotides of the SEQ. ID.<br>
NO.s 3, 16-17, 22-27, 29, 41-46, 51-53, 66-67, 72-77, 79, 91-96 and 101-102, and more<br>
preferably 14 contiguous nucleotide base pairs at any end of the double-stranded structure<br>
comprised of the first stretch and second stretch as outlined in the preceding table. It will be<br>
understood by the ones skilled in the art that given the potential length of the nucleic acid<br>
according to the present invention and particularly of the individual stretches forming such<br>
nucleic acid according to the present invention, some shifts relative to the coding sequence of<br>
RTP801 to each side is possible, whereby such shifts can be up to 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 nucleotides<br>
in both directions, and whereby the thus generated double-stranded nucleic acid molecules shall<br>
also be within the present invention.<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention the first stretch and the first strand have the<br>
same length. Likewise it is preferred that the second strand has the same length as the second<br>
stretch, whereby it is even more preferred that the first stretch and the second stretch have the<br>
same length. In a still more preferred embodiment, the first strand only comprises the first<br>
stretch and the second strand only comprises the second stretch. In an even more preferred<br>
embodiment neither the first stretch, and thus the first strand, nor the second stretch, and thus<br>
the second strand, comprise an overhang. In other words, it is also within the present invention<br>
that the double-stranded nucleic acids according to the present invention are blunt ended,<br>
preferably at each end of the double-stranded structure of the nucleic acids according to the<br>
present invention. Such blunt ended structure can be realized in connection with any other<br>
embodiments of the nucleic acids according to the present invention, particularly those<br>
embodiments where the nucleic acids according to the present invention have a modification<br>
pattern, more preferably a modification pattern as described herein.<br>
In a further aspect, the nucleic acid according to the present invention has thus a basic design<br>
which provides for blunt ends at both ends of the double-stranded structure of the nucleic acid<br>
according to the present invention. However, it is also within the present invention that there is a<br>
overhang, i. e. a stretch of one or more nucleotides protruding from the double-stranded<br>
structure. The overhang can be, in principle, at the 5' end of the antisense strand, at the 3' end of<br>
the antisense strand, at the 5' end of the sense strand and/or the 3' end of the sense strand. It is<br>
V<br>
to be noted that realising any single of said options as well as any combination thereof is within<br>
the present invention. More preferred is a combination, whereby the overhang is located at the<br>
3' end of the antisense strand and at the 3' end of the sense strand. It is also within the present<br>
invention that the overhang is at the 5' end of the antisense strand and at the 5' end of the sense<br>
strand. Furthermore it is within the present invention that the overhang is located only at the<br>
antisense strand of double-stranded structure, more preferably at the 3' end of the antisense<br>
strand of the double-stranded structure.<br>
In connection with the overhangs, it is to be noted that the overhang plus the stretch preferably<br>
form the strand and the lengths provided for the stretches herein apply also to these<br>
embodiments. The individual overhang can, independent of its location, consist of at least one<br>
nucleotide. However, the individual overhang can comprise as many as 10 and is preferably two<br>
nucleotides long. It is within the present invention that the respective nucleotide(s) forming the<br>
overhang(s) is/are also complementary to the nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801 in case<br>
of the first strand being complementary to said nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801, and<br>
the overhang being at the 3' or 5' end of the antisense strand, or that the overhang(s) is/are<br>
identical to the nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801 in case the first strand is identical to<br>
the nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801. The same applies to any overhang located at the<br>
second stretch of the basic design of the nucleic acid according to the present invention,<br>
whereby it is to be acknowledged that the overhang design at the second stretch can be<br>
independent from the overhang design of the first stretch.<br>
It is also within the present invention that the overhang forming nucleotides are neither<br>
complementary nor identical to the corresponding nucleotides of the nucleic acid sequence<br>
coding for RTP801. As used herein, and preferably in this embodiment, "corresponding" means<br>
the respective nucleotides which follow at the 5' end and/or the 3' end of the stretch having a<br>
nucleotide counterpart on the nucleic acid coding for RTP801.<br>
Preferably, the first strand comprises at its 3' end two nucleotides, preferably deoxynucleotides<br>
and more preferably two TT and/or this kind of nucleotides also at the 3' end of the second<br>
strand, whereby more preferably the length of the first stretch and the second stretch is 19<br>
nucleotides. The strands are thus comprised of the stretch and the overhang. In this<br>
embodiment the double-stranded structure consists of 19 base pairs and an overhang of two<br>
nucleotides at each end of 3' end of the individual stretch.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the first stretch and/or the first strand comprise(s) ribonucleotides,<br>
whereby it is particularly preferred that the first stretch consists in its entirety of ribonucleotides.<br>
The same applies to the second stretch and the second strand, respectively. In connection<br>
therewith, however, each and any of the nucleotides of the first stretch and second stretch,<br>
respectively, is modified in a preferred embodiment. The same applies to the first strand and<br>
second strand, respectively. Particularly the terminal nucleotides, irrespective whether they are<br>
ribonucleotides or deoxyribonucleotides, can have an OH-group which as such can be modified.<br>
Such OH-group may stem from either the sugar moiety of the nucleotide, more preferably from<br>
the 5'position in case of the 5'OH-group and/or from the 3'position in case of the 3'OH-group,<br>
or from a phosphate group attached to the sugar moiety of the respective terminal nucleotide.<br>
The phosphate group may in principle be attached to any OH-group of the sugar moiety of the<br>
nucleotide. Preferably, the phosphate group is attached to the 5'OH-group of the sugar moiety in<br>
case of the free 5'OH-group and/or to the 3'OH-group of the sugar moiety in case of the free<br>
3 'OH-group still providing what is referred to herein as free 5' or 3' OH-group.<br>
As used herein with any strategy for the design of RNAi or any embodiment of RNAi disclosed<br>
herein, the term end modification means a chemical entity added to the most 5' or 3' nucleotide<br>
of the first and/or second strand. Examples for such end modifications include, but are not<br>
limited to, 3' or 5' phosphate, inverted (deoxy) abasics, amino, fluoro, chloro, bromo, CN, CF,<br>
methoxy, imidazole, caboxylate, thioate, C| to CIQ lower alkyl, substituted lower alkyl, alkaryl<br>
or aralkyl, OCF3, OCN, O-, S-, or N-alkyl; O-, S-, or N-alkenyl; SOCH3; SO2CH3; ONO2; NO2,<br>
N3; heterocycloalkyi; heterocycloalkaryl; aminoalkylamino; polyalkylamino or substituted silyl,<br>
as, among others, described in European patents EP 0 586 520 B1 or EP 0 618 925 Bl.<br>
As used herein, alkyl or any term comprising "alkyl" preferably means any carbon atom chain<br>
comprising 1 to 12, preferably 1 to 6 and more, preferably 1 to 2 C atoms.<br>
A further end modification is a biotin group. Such biotin group may preferably be attached to<br>
either the most 5' or the most 3' nucleotide of the first and/or second strand or to both ends. In a<br>
more preferred embodiment the biotin group is coupled to a polypeptide or a protein. It is also<br>
within the scope of the present invention that the polypeptide or protein is attached through any<br>
of the other aforementioned end modifications. The polypeptide or protein may confer further<br>
characteristics to the nucleic acid molecules according to the present invention. Among others<br>
the polypeptide or protein may act as a ligand to another molecule. If said other molecule is a<br>
receptor the receptor's function and activity may be activated by the binding ligand. The<br>
receptor may show an internalization activity which allows an effective transfection of the<br>
ligand bound nucleic acid molecules according to the present invention. An example for the<br>
ligand to be coupled to the inventive nucleic acid molecule is VEGF and the corresponding<br>
receptor is the VEGF receptor.<br>
Various possible embodiments of the RNAi of the present invention having different kinds of<br>
end modification(s) are presented in the following table 1.<br>
TABLE 1: VARIOUS EMBODIMENTS OF THE INTERFERING RIBONUCLEIC ACID<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The various end modifications as disclosed herein are preferably located at the ribose moiety of<br>
a nucleotide of the nucleic acid according to the present invention. More particularly, the end<br>
modification may be attached to or replace any of the OH-groups of the ribose moiety, including<br>
but not limited to the 2'OH, 3'OH and 5'OH position, provided that the nucleotide thus<br>
modified is a terminal nucleotide. Inverted abasics are nucleotides, either desoxyribonucleotides<br>
or ribonucleotides which do not have a nucleobase moiety. This kind of compound is, among<br>
others, described in Sternberger, M., Schmiedeknecht, A., Kretschmer, A., Gebhardt, F.,<br>
Leenders, F., Czauderna, F., Von Carlowitz, I., Engle, M., Giese, K., Beigelman, L. &amp; Klippel,<br>
A. (2002). Antisense Nucleic Acid Drug Dev, 12, 131-43<br>
Any of the aforementioned end modifications may be used in connection with the various<br>
embodiments of RNAi depicted in Table 1; it is to be noted that the 51 end modifications<br>
mentioned above are usually only presenti in the sense strand of the siRNA molecule<br>
Further modifications can be related to the nucleobase moiety, the sugar moiety or the<br>
phosphate moiety of the individual nucleotide.<br>
Such modification of the nucleobase moiety can be such that the derivatives of adenine,<br>
guanine, cytosine and thymidine and uracil, respectively, are modified. Particularly preferred<br>
modified nucleobases are selected from the group comprising inosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine,<br>
2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl, 2-propyl and other alkyladenines, 5-halo uracil, 5-halocytosine, 5-<br>
halo cytosine, 6-azacytosine, 6-aza thymine, pseudo-uracil, 4-thiouracil, 8-halo adenine, 8-<br>
aminoadenine, 8-thiol adenine, 8-thiolalkyl adenines, 8-hydroxyl adenine and other 8-<br>
substituted adenines, 8-halo guanines, 8-amino guanine, 8-thiol guanine, 8-thioalkyl guanine, 8-<br>
hydroxylguanine and other substituted guanines, other aza- and deaza adenines, other aza- and<br>
deaza guanines, 5-trifluoromethyl uracil and 5-trifluoro cytosine.<br>
In another preferred embodiment, the sugar moiety of the nucleotide is modified, whereby such<br>
modification preferably is at the 2' position of the ribose and desoxyribose moiety, respectively,<br>
of the nucleotide. More preferably, the 2' OH group is replaced by a group or moiety selected<br>
from the group comprising amino, fluoro, alkoxy and alkyl. Preferably, alkoxy is either methoxy<br>
or ethoxy. Also preferably alkyl means methyl, ethyl, propyl, isobutyl, butyl and isobutyl. It is<br>
even more preferred that, regardless of the type of modification, the nucleotide is preferably a<br>
ribonucleotide.<br>
The modification of the phosphate moiety is preferably selected from the group comprising<br>
phosphothioates.<br>
It will be acknowledged by the one skilled in the art that the nucleic acid of the present<br>
invention which consists of a multitude of nucleotides may thus be formed by nucleotides which<br>
are linked through a phosphodiester linkage or through a phosphothioate linkage, or a<br>
combination of both along the length of the nucleotide sequence of the individual strand and<br>
stretch, respectively.<br>
A further form of nucleotides used may actually be siNA which is, among others, described in<br>
international patent application WO 03/070918.<br>
The nucleotides forming the first stretch and first strand, respectively, of the nucleic acid<br>
according to the present invention can comprise one or more modified nucleotides, whereby the<br>
individual modified nucleotide has a modification which is preferably a modification as<br>
disclosed herein. In addition to the particular modification, the modification can be or comprise<br>
some sort of label, whereby the label is selected from the group chemiluminescent labels,<br>
fluorescent labels and radio labels. These kinds of labels are known to the one skilled in the art<br>
and, e. g., described in Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, John Wiley and<br>
Sons, Baltimore, Maryland, 1998. The thus labelled nucleic acid according to the present<br>
invention may be used also for diagnostic purposes or for monitoring the site of action as well as<br>
for the staging of any treatment, preferably related to any of the diseases disclosed herein.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the nucleic acid according to the present invention is modified such<br>
that the pyrimidine nucleotides in the sense stretch or strand are 2' O-methyl pyrimidine<br>
nucleotides and, either additionally or alternatively, the purine nucleotides in the sense stretch or<br>
strand are 2'-deoxypurine nucleotides. In a further embodiment the pyrimidine nucleotides<br>
present in the sense stretch or sense strand are 2'-deoxy-2'-fluoro pyrimidine nucleotides.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the modification is not based on the chemistry of the nucleotide, i.<br>
e. the modification depends on whether the nucleotide to be modified is either a purine<br>
nucleotide or a pyrimidine nucleotide, but is predominantly based on the individual nucleotide's<br>
spatial arrangement in the overall double-stranded structure of the basic design of the nucleic<br>
acid according to the present invention.<br>
More particularly, either the first strand and first stretch, respectively, or the second strand and<br>
second stretch, respectively, show a spatial pattern of modification of the nucleotides forming<br>
said stretches and strands, respectively.<br>
Focusing on the first stretch first, there is a pattern of groups of modified nueleotides and groups<br>
of non-modified nucleotides. These groups of non-modified nucleotides are also referred to<br>
herein as flanking groups of nucleotides. More preferably, the pattern consists of groups of<br>
modified nucleotides and non-modified nucleotides. Even more preferably, the pattern is a<br>
regular pattern and even more preferably an alternating pattern along the length of the first<br>
stretch of the nucleic acid according to the present invention. The group of modified nucleotides<br>
may either consist of one or of several nucleotides which are modified and which are preferably<br>
nucleotides which are modified at the 2' position, i. e. have a modification at the sugar moiety.<br>
More preferably, this modification is a 2'-O-Me modification.<br>
The group of non-modified nucleotides may either consist of one or of several nucleotides<br>
which are either not modified, whereby the not-modified nucleotides are preferably<br>
nbonucleotides, or the not modified nucleotides are nucleotides having a modification, whereby<br>
such modification is different from the modification shown by the nucleotides forming the<br>
group of modified nucleotides. Even more preferably, the not modified nucleotides are<br>
ribonucleotides. It is to be noted that the term not modified and non-modified nucleotide are<br>
used in an interchangeable manner if not indicated to the contrary. The first stretch of the<br>
nucleic acid according to the present invention may either start with a group of modified<br>
nucleotides or start with a group of non-modified nucleotides as defined herein. However, it is<br>
preferred that the first stretch starts with a group of modified nucleotides. Most preferably, the<br>
group of modified nucleotides consists of a single nucleotide. In connection with this<br>
embodiment the first stretch is preferably in antisense orientation to the nucleic acid coding for<br>
RTP801. It is also within the present invention that the modification as exhibited by the<br>
nucleotides forming the group of modified nucleotides is the same for all groups of modified<br>
nucleotides present on the first stretch. However, it is also within the present invention that<br>
some group of modified nucleotides have a different modification than one or several groups of<br>
modified nucleotides present on the first stretch.<br>
On the second strand of the nucleic acid according to the present invention, a pattern as<br>
described for the first stretch can also be realised. The same characteristics as described in<br>
connection with the first stretch can be realized in an embodiment on the second stretch as well,<br>
whereby it is preferred that, under the proviso that the second stretch is in sense orientation<br>
relative to the nucleic acid sequence coding for RTP801, the second strand of the nucleic acid<br>
according to the present invention starts with a group of non-modified nucleotides.<br>
The nucleic acid according to the present invention comprising a double-stranded structure may<br>
comprise a first stretch having the modification pattern as described herein. Alternatively, the<br>
double-stranded nucleic acid according to the present invention may comprise a second stretch<br>
having the modification pattern as outlined above. It is, however, most preferred that the doublestranded<br>
nucleic acid according to the present invention consists of a first stretch and a second<br>
stretch, whereby both the first stretch and the second stretch have a spatial modification pattern<br>
as described herein.<br>
It is within the present invention that the characteristics of the spatial modification pattern is the<br>
same on both stretches in terms of size of the groups of modified nucleotides and groups of nonmodified<br>
nucleotides and the kind of modifications actually used. Preferably, the spatial pattern<br>
of modification on the first stretch is shifted such that a group of modified nucleotides on the<br>
first stretch is opposing a group of non-modified nucleotides on the second stretch and vice<br>
versa. However, it is also with the present invention that the patterns are exactly aligned, i. e.<br>
that a group of modified nucleotides on the first stretch is opposing a group of non-modified<br>
nucleotides on the second stretch and a group of non-modified nucleotides on the first stretch is<br>
opposing a group of non-modified nucleotides on the second stretch. It is still within the present<br>
invention that the spatial pattern of modification on the first stretch and the second stretch is<br>
shifted relative to each other so that only a first portion of a group of modified nucleotides on<br>
one stretch is opposing a portion of a group of non-modified nucleotides on the other stretch,<br>
whereas the second portion of the group of modified nucleotides is opposing another group of<br>
modified nucleotides. It is within the present invention that the disclosure provided herein on the<br>
spatial modification pattern of the stretch(es) of the nucleic acid according to the present<br>
invention applies also to the strand(s) of the nucleic acid according to the present invention.<br>
However, it is preferred that the stretches of the nucleic acid comprise the spatial modification<br>
pattern and the strands comprise such stretches and one or more overhang(s) as disclosed herein.<br>
It is particularly preferred that the overhang is a phosphate group at the 3' end of either the<br>
antisense strand, or the sense strand or both strands, whereby it is more preferred that the<br>
phosphate group is at the 3' end of both the antisense strand and the sense strand. In an even<br>
more preferred embodiment, the phosphate group is a phosphate group as defined herein.<br>
It is also within the present invention that the nucleic acid according to the present invention<br>
may exhibit a linker connecting the first and the second strand. Such linker is preferably a<br>
polymer. The polymer can be any synthetic or natural polymer. Possible synthetic linkers are,<br>
among others, PEG or a polynucleotide. Such linker is preferably designed such as to allow the<br>
either partial or complete folding back of the first stretch onto the second stretch and vice versa.<br>
Finally, it is within the present invention that the nucleic acid according to the present invention<br>
is a synthetic one, a chemically synthesised one, an isolated one, or one derived from any<br>
natural sources such as, for example, prepared by means of recombinant technology. In<br>
connection with the preparation of any nucleic acid according to the present invention any<br>
modification as disclosed herein can be introduced either prior, during or subsequent to the<br>
preparation of the respective nucleic acid according to the present invention as known to the<br>
ones skilled in the art.<br>
The vector according to the present invention comprises a nucleic acid according to the present<br>
invention. Additionally, the vector may include elements to control targeting, expression and<br>
transcription of said nucleic acid in a cell selective manner as is known in the art. The plasmid<br>
can include a promoter for controlling transcription of the heterologous material, i. e. the nucleic<br>
acid according to the present invention, and can be either a constitutive or an inducible promoter<br>
to allow selective transcription. Enhancers that may be required to obtain necessary transcription<br>
levels can optionally be included. Enhancers are generally any non-translated DNA sequences<br>
which work contiguously with the coding sequence, thus in cis, to change the basal transcription<br>
level dictated by the promoter. The expression of such constructs is known to the one skilled in<br>
the art and may be done, e. g., by providing a respective tandem construct or by having different<br>
promoters transcribing for the first and second strand and first and second stretch, respectively,<br>
of the nucleic acid according to the present invention.<br>
When the nucleic acid according to the present invention is manufactured or expressed,<br>
preferably expressed in vivo, more preferably in a patient who is in need of the nucleic acid<br>
according to the present invention, such manufacture or expression preferably uses an<br>
expression vector, preferably a mammalian expression vector. Expression vectors are known in<br>
the art and preferably comprise plasmids, cosmids, viral expression systems. Preferred viral<br>
expression systems include, but are not limited to, adenovirus, retrovirus and lentivirus.<br>
Methods are known in the art to introduce the vectors into cells or tissues. Such methods can be<br>
found generally described in Sambrook et al., Molecular cloning: A Laboratory Manual, Cold<br>
Springs Harbour Laboratory, New York (1983, 1992), or in Ausubel et al., Current Protocols in<br>
Molecular Biology, John Wiley and Sons, Baltimore, Maryland, 1998.<br>
Suitable methods comprise, among others, transfection, lipofection, electroporation and<br>
infection with recombinant viral vectors. In connection with the present invention, an additional<br>
feature of the vector is in one embodiment an expression limiting feature such as a promoter and<br>
regulatory element, respectively, that are specific for the desired cell type thus allowing the<br>
expression of the nucleic acid sequence according to the present invention only once the<br>
background is provided which allows the desired expression.<br>
In a further aspect the present invention is related to a pharmaceutical composition comprising a<br>
nucleic acid according to the present invention and/or a vector according to the present<br>
invention and, optionally, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, diluent or adjuvants or other<br>
vehicle(s). Preferably, such carrier, diluents, adjuvants and vehicles are inert, and non-toxic. The<br>
pharmaceutical composition is in its various embodiments adapted for administration in various<br>
ways. Such administration comprises systemic and local administration as well as oral,<br>
subcutaneous, parenteral, intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraperitonial, intranasal, and<br>
intrategral.<br>
It will be acknowledged by the ones skilled in the art that the amount of the pharmaceutical<br>
composition and the respective nucleic acid and vector, respectively, depends on the clinical<br>
condition of the individual patient, the site and method of administration, scheduling of<br>
administration, patient age, sex, bodyweight and other factors known to medical practitioners.<br>
The pharmaceutically effective amount for purposes of prevention and/or treatment is thus<br>
determined by such considerations as are known in the medical arts. Preferably, the amount is<br>
effective to achieve improvement including but limited to improve the diseased condition or to<br>
provide for a more rapid recovery, improvement or elimination of symptoms and other<br>
indicators as are selected as appropriate measures by those skilled in the medical arts.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention<br>
may comprise other pharmaceutically active compounds. Preferably, such other<br>
pharmaceutically active compounds are selected from the group comprising compounds which<br>
allow for uptake intracellular cell delivery, compounds which allow for endosomal release,<br>
compounds which allow for, longer circulation time and compounds which allow for targeting<br>
of endothelial cells or pathogenic cells. Preferred compounds for endosomal release are<br>
chloroquine, and inhibitors of ATP dependent H+ pumps.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition is preferably formulated so as to provide for a single dosage<br>
administration or a multi-dosage administration.<br>
It will be acknowledged that the pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention<br>
can be used for any disease which involves undesired development or growth of vasculature<br>
including angiogenesis, as well as any of the diseases and conditions described herein.<br>
Preferably, these kind of diseases are tumor diseases. Among tumor diseases, the following<br>
rumors are most preferred: endometrial cancer, colorectal carcinomas, gliomas, endometrial<br>
cancers, adenocarcinomas, endometrial hyperplasias, Cowden's syndrome, hereditary nonpolyposis<br>
colorectal carcinoma, Li-Fraumene's syndrome, breast-ovarian cancer, prostate cancer<br>
(Ali, I. U., Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 92, no. 11, June 07, 2000, page 861 -<br>
863), Bannayan-Zonana syndrome, LDD (Lhermitte-Duklos' syndrome) (Macleod, K., supra)<br>
hamartoma-macrocephaly diseases including Cow disease (CD) and Bannayan-Ruvalcaba-Rily<br>
syndrome (BRR), mucocutaneous lesions (e. g. trichilemmonmas), macrocephaly, mental<br>
retardation, gastrointestinal harmatomas, lipomas, thyroid adenomas, fibrocystic disease of the<br>
breast, cerebellar dysplastic gangliocytoma and breast and thyroid malignancies (Vazquez, F.,<br>
Sellers, W. R., supra).<br>
It is to be acknowledged that any of the tumor disease to be treated with the pharmaceutical<br>
composition according to the present invention is preferably a late stage tumor disease. In<br>
another embodiment, the tumor disease involves cells which are tumor suppressor negative,<br>
whereby more preferably the tumor suppressor is PTEN.<br>
The pharmaceutical composition according to the present invention can also be used in a method<br>
for preventing and/or treating a disease as disclosed herein, whereby the method comprises the<br>
administration of a nucleic acid according to the present invention, a vector according to the<br>
present invention or a pharmaceutical composition or medicament according to the present<br>
invention for any of the diseases described herein.<br>
In a further aspect, the present invention is related to a method for designing or screening a<br>
nucleic acid which is suitable to down-regulate RTP801, more particularly to down-regulate<br>
RTP801 function. This method comprises the use of a nucleic acid sequence as disclosed herein<br>
and the assessment of such nucleic acid in a suitable assay. Such assay is known in the art and,<br>
for example, described in the example part of this application. In a further step, a doublestranded<br>
nucleic acid is designed, preferably according to the design principles as laid down<br>
herein, which is suitable to down-regulate RTP801, preferably in connection with a post<br>
transcriptional gene silencing mechanism such as RNA interference. Also the thus obtained, i. e.<br>
designed or screened, nucleic acid is assessed in the respective assay and the result, i. e. the<br>
effect of both the nucleic acid according to the present invention as well as the newly designed<br>
or screened nucleic acid in such assay compared. Preferably, the designed or screened nucleic<br>
acid is more suitable in case it is either more stable or more effective, preferably both. It will be<br>
acknowledged that the method will be particularly effective if any of the nucleic acids according<br>
to the present invention is used as a starting point. It is thus within the present invention that<br>
new nucleic acid molecules will be designed based on the principles disclosed herein, whereby<br>
the target sequence on the RTP801 mRNA will be slightly shifted relative to the target sequence<br>
on the RTP801 mRNA for the corresponding nucleic acid according to the present invention.<br>
Preferably the new nucleic acid will be shifted by at least one or more nucleotides relative to the<br>
stretch on the target mRNA in either the 5' or the 3' direction of the mRNA coding for RTP801.<br>
It is however with in the present invention that the shift occurs in both directions simultaneously<br>
which means that the new nucleic acid incorporates the nucleic acid according to the present<br>
invention used as a starting point. It is also within the present invention that the elongation of<br>
the nucleic acid according to the present invention and used as a starting point is biased to either<br>
the 3' end or the 5' end. In case of such as bias either the 3' end or the 5' end of the new nucleic<br>
acid is longer, i.e more extended than the other end. When the new nucleic acid molecule is<br>
generated by extending either the 3' end of the 5' end of the antisense strand and/or the sense<br>
strand, the following sequence of steps is typically applied. If the shift is to the 5' end of the<br>
mRNA of RTP801, the 3' end of the antisense strand has to be extended by the number of the<br>
nucleotides by which the 5' end of the mRNA of RTP801 is shifted. The nucleotide(s) thus to be<br>
added to the 3' end of the antisense strand of the new nucleic acid is/are complementary to those<br>
nucleotides following at the 5' end of the target sequence on the RTP801 mRNA used for the<br>
nucleic acid molecule according to the present invention used as a starting point. The same has<br>
to be done to the sense strand. However the nucleotides to be added to the sense strand have to<br>
correspond, i.e. be complementary to the nucleotides newly added to the 3' end of the antisense<br>
strand which means that they have to be added to the 5' end of the sense strand. The latter step<br>
on the sense strand, however has to be done only to the extent that apart from the antisense<br>
strand also the sense strand shall be shifted, which is the case in preferred embodiments of the<br>
present invention. Although this shifting can be done to an extent defined by the ones skilled in<br>
the art, more preferably the shift shall be done such that also the new nucleic acid still contains a<br>
strech of at least 14 nucleotides, preferably 14 contiguous nucleotides as exhibited by any of the<br>
nucleic acid molecules disclosed herein.<br>
The synthesis of any of the nucleic acids described herein is within the skills of the one of the<br>
art. Such synthesis is, among others, described in Beaucage S.L. and Iyer R.P., Tetrahedron<br>
1992; 48: 2223-2311, Beaucage S.L. and Iyer R.P., Tetrahedron 1993; 49: 6123-6194 and<br>

among others, described in Eckstein F., Annu. Rev. Biochem. 1985; 54: 367-402, the synthesis<br>
of RNA molecules is described in Sproat B., in Humana Press 2005 Edited by Herdewijn P.;<br>
Kap. 2: 17-31 and respective downstream processes are, among others, described in Pingoud A.<br>
et. al., in 1RL Press 1989 Edited by Oliver R.W.A.; Kap. 7: 183-208 and Sproat B., in Humana<br>
Press 2005 Edited by Herdewijn P.; Kap. 2: 17-31 (supra).<br>
siRNA for RTP801 can be made using methods known in the art as described above, based on<br>
the known sequence of RTP801 (SEQ ID NO:1), and can be made stable by various<br>
modifications as described above. For further information, see Example 9.<br>
Further, in relation to the methods of the present invention as described herein, additional RNA<br>
molecules may be used with said methods e.g. inhibitory RNA molecules of the present<br>
invention include single stranded oligoribonucleotides preferably comprising stretches of at least<br>
7-10 consecutive nucleotides present in the sequences detailed in Tables A-C,<br>
said oligoribonucleotides being capable of forming [and/or comprising] double stranded regions<br>
in particular conformations that are recognized by intracellular complexes, leading to the<br>
degradation of said oligoribonucleotides into smaller RNA molecules that are capable of<br>
exerting inhibition of their corresponding endogenous gene, and DNA molecules encoding such<br>
RNA molecules. The corresponding endogenous gene is preferably the 801 gene and may<br>
additionally be the VEGF gene and /or the VEGF-Rlgene. The invention also provides a<br>
composition comprising the above single stranded oligoribonucleotide in a carrier, preferably a<br>
pharmaceutical ly acceptable carrier.<br>
Additionally, the present invention provides for combination therapy for all the conditions<br>
disclosed herein and in particular conditions involving choroidal neovascularization. In said<br>
combination therapy, both the RTP801 and VEGFR genes are inhibited in order to ameliorate<br>
the symptoms of the disease being treated. These genes may be inhibited with a combination of<br>
siRNAs or antibodies (including aptamer antibodies) or both. The present invention therefore<br>
also provides for a novel pharmaceutical composition comprising an RTP801 inhibitor and a<br>
VEGF or VEGFR-1 inhibitor, the RTP801 inhibitor preferable being an siRNA, more preferably<br>
an siRNA molecule detailed in Tables A-C and in particular, siRNA Nos: 14, 22, 23, 25, 27, 39,<br>
41, 42, 49 and 50 of Table A, and the VEGF/ VEGFR-1 inhibitor optionally being an antibody<br>
or aptamer. The combined use of said compounds (i.e., RTP801 siRNA and VEGF antibody or<br>
any other combined example disclosed herein) in the preparation of a medicament is also part of<br>
the present invention.<br>
Thus, RTP801 siRNA such as an siRNA molecule detailed in Tables A-C and in particular,<br>
siRNA Nos: 14, 22, 23, 25, 27, 39, 41, 42, 49 and 50 of Table A may be administered in<br>
conjunction with agents which target VEGF or VEGF receptor 1 (VEGFR1). Such agents<br>
currently exist on the market or in various stages of approval and work through different<br>
mechanisms. Antibodies and antibody fragments such as ranibizumab (Lucentis, Genentech)<br>
attach to released VEGF to inhibit binding of VEGF to active receptors. An aptamer which can<br>
act like a ligand/antibody (Macugen, Eyetech/Pfizer, approved recently by the FDA for wet<br>
AMD) is also a possibility. Macugen bonds with extracellular VEGF to block its activity. These<br>
drugs are administered locally by intravitreal injection. Anti-VEGF siRNA based compounds<br>
(such as Acuity's CandS inhibitor of VEGF or SIRNA's 027 inhibitor of VEGFR-1) are also<br>
available. Additionally, the small molecule aminosterol Squalamine (Genaera) which is<br>
administered systemically reportedly interferes in multiple facets of the angiogenic process,<br>
including inhibiting VEGF and other growth factor signaling in endothelial cells.<br>
The conjoined administration of an RTP801 inhibitor, preferably an siRNA, and any of the<br>
above VEGF / VEGFR-1 inhibitory agents can have a synergistic effect whereby said combined<br>
treatment is more effective than treatment by any of these individual compositions, irrespective<br>
of dosage in the single therapy option. This synergistic effect is also supported by preliminary<br>
results obtained by the Asignee, as detailed in Example 6.<br>
RTPSOli has a different mechanism of action and is potentially synergistic with VEGF-VEGFR<br>
inhibitors. A study in RTP801 KO mice indicates that protective phenotype in the KO mice<br>
persists in spite of the fact that expression of VEGF mRNA in the eye is as high as in the WT<br>
mice. Our additional preliminary data indicate that inhibition of RTP801 may be synergistic<br>
with the inhibition of VEGF-VEGFR regulatory axis in treatment of retinal pathology. The<br>
inventors of the present invention have found in appropriate experiments that administration of<br>
siRNA against RTP801 in the model of AMD (see Example 6 below) leads not only to<br>
downregulation of RTP801 itself but also, as a consequence, to upregulation of the<br>
antiangiogenic and neuroprotective factor PEDF as well as the downregulation of expression of<br>
MCP1, a macrophage chemoattractant protein. Thus, inhibition of RTP801 simultaneously<br>
confers antiangiogenic, neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects.<br>
It is to be understood that, in the context of the present invention, any of the siRNA molecules<br>
disclosed herein, or any long double-stranded RNA molecules (typically 25-500 nucleotides in<br>
length) which are processed by endogenous cellular complexes (such as DICER - see above) to<br>
form the siRNA molecules disclosed herein, or molecules which comprise the siRNA molecules<br>
disclosed herein, can be employed in the treatment of the diseases or disorders described herein.<br>
Additional disorders which can be treated by the molecules and compositions of the present<br>
invention include all types of choroidal neovascularization (CNV), which occurs not only in wet<br>
AMD but also in other ocular pathologies such as ocular histoplasmosis syndrome, angiod<br>
streaks, ruptures in Bruch's membrane, myopic degeneration, ocular tumors and some retinal<br>
degenerative diseases.<br>
An additional aspect of the present invention provides for methods of treating an apoptosis related<br>
disease. Methods for therapy of diseases or disorders associated with uncontrolled, pathological<br>
cell growth, e.g. cancer, psoriasis, autoimmune diseases, inter alia, and methods for therapy of<br>
diseases associated with ischemia and lack of proper blood flow, e.g. myocardial infarction (MI)<br>
and stroke, are provided. "Cancer" or "Tumor" refers to an uncontrolled growing mass of abnormal<br>
cells. These terms include both primary tumors, which may be benign or malignant, as well as<br>
secondary tumors, or metastases which have spread to other sites in the body. Examples of cancertype<br>
diseases include, inter alia: carcinoma (e.g.: breast, colon and lung), leukemia such as B cell<br>
leukemia, lymphoma such as B-cell lymphoma, blastema such as neuroblastoma and melanoma.<br>
The invention also provides a composition comprising one or more of the compounds of the<br>
invention in a carrier, preferably a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. This composition may<br>
comprise a mixture of two or more siRNAs for different genes or different siRNAs for the same<br>
gene. A composition comprising siRNA for the RTP801 gene and siRNA for the VEGF gene<br>
and /or the VEGF-R1 gene is envisaged.<br>
Another compound of the invention comprises the above compound of the invention (structure<br>
A) covalently or non-covalently bound to one or more compounds of the invention (structure<br>
A). This compound may be delivered in a carrier, preferably a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier, and may be processed intracellularly by endogenous cellular complexes to produce one<br>
or more siRNAs of the invention. Another compound of the invention comprises the above<br>
compound of the invention (structure A) covalently or non-covalently bound to an siRNA for<br>
another gene, especially the VEGF gene and/or the VEGF-R1 gene.<br>
This invention also comprises a novel chemical entity which is an RTP801 inhibitor, preferably<br>
an siRNA, chemically bound, covalently or non-covalently, to any of the above VEGF /<br>
VEGFR-1 inhibitory agents. A particular chemical entity envisaged is an siRNA RTP801<br>
inhibitor covalently bound to an antibody to VEGF or VEGF receptor-1. Methods of production<br>
of such novel chemical entities are known to those skilled in the art.<br>
This invention also comprises a tandem double-stranded structure which comprises two or more<br>
siRNA sequences, which is processed intracellularly to form two or more different siRNAs, one<br>
inhibiting 801 and a second inhibiting VEGF / VEGFR-1 In a related aspect, this invention<br>
also comprises a tandem double-stranded structure which comprises two or more siRNA<br>
sequences, which is degraded intracellularly to form two or more different siRNAs, both<br>
inhibiting 801.<br>
In particular, it is envisaged that a long oligonucleotide (typically about 80-500 nucleotides in<br>
length) comprising one or more stem and loop structures, where stem regions comprise the<br>
sequences of the oligonucleotides of the invention, may be delivered in a carrier, preferably a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, and may be processed intracellularly by endogenous<br>
cellular complexes (e.g. by DROSHA and DICER as described above) to produce one or more<br>
smaller double stranded oligonucleotides (siRNAs) which are oligonucleotides of the invention.<br>
This oligonucleotide can be termed a tandem shRNA construct. It is envisaged that this long<br>
oligonucleotide is a single stranded oligonucleotide comprising one or more stem and loop<br>
structures, wherein each stem region comprises a sense and corresponding antisense siRNA<br>
sequence of an 801 gene. In particular, it is envisaged that this oligonucleotide comprises sense<br>
and antisense siRNA sequences as depicted in any one of Tables A through C. Alternatively, the<br>
tandem shRNA construct may comprise sense and corresponding antisense siRNA sequence of<br>
an 801 gene and additionally sense and corresponding antisense siRNA sequence of a different<br>
gene such as VEGF or VEGF-R1.<br>
As mentioned herein, siRNA against RTP801 may be the main active component in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition, or may be one active component of a pharmaceutical composition<br>
containing two or more siRNAs (or molecules which encode or endogenously produce two or<br>
more siRNAs, be it a mixture of molecules or one or more tandem molecule which encodes two<br>
or more siRNAs), said pharmaceutical composition further being comprised of one or more<br>
additional siRNA molecule which targets one or more additional gene. Simultaneous inhibition<br>
of RTP801 and said additional gene(s) will probably have an additive or synergistic effect for<br>
treatment of the diseases disclosed herein, according to the following:<br>

Any molecules, such as, for example, antisense DNA molecules which comprise the siRNA<br>
sequences disclosed herein (with the appropriate nucleic acid modifications) are particularly<br>
desirable and may be used in the same capacity as their corresponding siRNAs for all uses and<br>
methods disclosed herein.<br>
The invention also comprises a method of treating a patient suffering from a disorder such as the<br>
disorders described herein comprising administering to the patient the above composition or<br>
compound in a therapeutically effective dose so as to thereby treat the patient.<br>
By the term "antisense" (AS) or "antisense fragment" is meant a polynucleotide fragment<br>
(coprising either deoxyribonucleotides, ribonucleotides or a mixture of both) having inhibitory<br>
antisense activity, said activity causing a decrease in the expression of the endogenous genomic<br>
copy of the corresponding gene (in this case RTP801). An RTP801 AS polynucleotide is a<br>
polynucleotide which comprises consecutive nucleotides having a sequence of sufficient length<br>
and homology to a sequence present within the sequence of the RTP801 gene set forth in SEQ<br>
ID NO: 1 to permit hybridization of the AS to the gene. The sequence of the AS is designed to<br>
complement a target mRNA of interest and form an RNA:AS duplex. This duplex formation can<br>
prevent processing, splicing, transport or translation of the relevant mRNA. Moreover, certain<br>
AS nucleotide sequences can elicit cellular RNase H activity when hybridized with their target<br>
mRNA, resulting in mRNA degradation (Calabretta et al, 1996: Antisense strategies in the<br>
treatment ofleukemias. Semin Oncol. 23(l):78-87). In that case, RNase H will cleave the RNA<br>
component of the duplex and can potentially release the AS to further hybridize with additional<br>
molecules of the target RNA. An additional mode of action results from the interaction of AS<br>
with genomic DNA to form a triple helix which can be transcriptionally inactive. Particular AS<br>
fragments are the AS of the DNA encoding the particular fragments of RTP801 described<br>
herein.<br>
Many reviews have covered the main aspects of antisense (AS) technology and its therapeutic<br>
potential (Wright &amp;Anazodo, 1995. Antisense Molecules and Their Potential For The<br>
Treatment Of Cancer and AIDS. Cancer J. 8:185-189.'). There are reviews on the chemical<br>
(Crooke, 1995. Progress in antisense therapeutics, Hematol. Pathol. 2:59; Uhlmann and<br>
Peyman, 1990. Antisense Oligomicleotides: A New Therapeutic Principle. Chem Rev 90(4): 543-<br>
584.), cellular (Wagner, 1994. Gene inhibition using antisense oligodeoxynucleotides. Nature<br>
372:333.) and therapeutic (Hanania, et al 1995. Recent advances in the application of gene<br>
therapy to human disease. Am. J. Med. 99:537.; Scanlon et al., 1995. Oligonucleotides-mediated<br>
modulation of mammalian gene expression. FASEB J. 9:1288.; Gewirtz, 1993.<br>
Oligodeoxynucleotide-based therapeutics for human leukemias, Stem Cells Dayt. 11:96.)<br>
aspects of this technology.<br>
Antisense intervention in the expression of specific genes can be achieved by the use of<br>
synthetic AS oligonucleotide sequences (see Lefebvre-d'Hellencourt et al, 1995.<br>
Jmmunomodulation by cytokine antisense oligonucleotides. Eur. Cytokine Netw. 6:7.\ Agrawal,<br>
1996. Antisense oligonucleotides: towards clinical trials, TJBTECH, 14:376.; Lev-Lehman et<br>
al., 1997. Antisense Oligomers in vitro and in vivo. In Antisense Therapeutics, A. Cohen andS.<br>
Smicek, eds (Plenum Press, New York)). AS oligonucleotide sequences are designed to<br>
complement a target mRNA of interest and form an RNA:AS duplex. This duplex formation can<br>
prevent processing, splicing, transport or translation of the relevant mRNA. Moreover, certain<br>
AS nucleotide sequences can elicit cellular RNase H activity when hybridized with their target<br>
mRNA, resulting in mRNA degradation (Calabretta, et al, 1996. Antisense strategies in the<br>
treatment ofleukemias. Semin. Oncol. 23:78.). In that case, RNase H will cleave the RNA<br>
component of the duplex and can potentially release the AS to further hybridize with additional<br>
molecules of the target RNA. An additional mode of action results from the interaction of AS<br>
with genomic DNA to form a triple helix which may be transcriptionally inactive.<br>
The sequence target segment for the antisense oligonucleotide is selected such that the sequence<br>
exhibits suitable energy related characteristics important for oligonucleotide duplex formation<br>
with their complementary templates, and shows a low potential for self-dimerization or selfcomplementation<br>
(Anazodo et al., 1996). For example, the computer program OLIGO (Primer<br>
Analysis Software, Version 3.4), can be used to determine antisense sequence melting<br>
temperature, free energy properties, and to estimate potential self-dimer formation and selfcomplimentary<br>
properties. The program allows the determination of a qualitative estimation of<br>
these two parameters (potential self-dimer formation and self-complimentary) and provides an<br>
indication of "no potential" or "some potential" or "essentially complete potential". Using this<br>
program target segments are generally selected that have estimates of no potential in these<br>
•<br>
parameters. However, segments can be used that have "some potential" in one of the categories.<br>
A balance of the parameters is used in the selection as is known in the art. Further, the<br>
oligonucleotides are also selected as needed so that analogue substitution do not substantially<br>
affect function.<br>
Phosphorothioate antisense oligonucleotides do not normally show significant toxicity at<br>
concentrations that are effective and exhibit sufficient pharmacodynamic half-lives in animals<br>
(Agrawal, 1996. Antisense oligonucleotides: towards clinical trials, TIBTECH, 14:376.) and are<br>
nuclease resistant. Antisense induced loss-of-function phenotypes related with cellular<br>
development have been shown for the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), for the<br>
establishment of tectal plate formation in chick (Galileo et al., 1991. J. Cell. Biol., 112:1285.)<br>
and for the N-myc protein, responsible for the maintenance of cellular heterogeneity in<br>
neuroectodermal cultures (ephithelial vs. neuroblastic cells, which differ in their colony forming<br>
abilities, rumorigenicity and adherence) (Rosolen et al., 1990. Cancer Res. 50:6316.; Whitesell<br>
et al., 1991. Episome-generated N-myc antisense RNA restricts the differentiation potential of<br>
primitive neuroectodermal cell lines. Mol. Cell. Biol. 11:1360.). Antisense oligonucleotide<br>
inhibition of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFgF), having mitogenic and angiogenic properties,<br>
suppressed 80% of growth in glioma cells (Morrison, 1991. Suppression of basic fibroblast<br>
growth factor expression by antisense oligonucleotides inhibits the growth of transformed<br>
human astrocytes. J. Biol. Chem. 266:728.) in a saturable and specific manner. Being<br>
hydrophobic, antisense oligonucleotides interact well with phospholipid membranes (Akhter et<br>
al, 1991. Interactions of antisense DNA oligonucleotide analogs with phospholipid membranes<br>
(liposomes) Nuc. Res. 19:5551-5559.). Following their interaction with the cellular plasma<br>
membrane, they are actively (or passively) transported into living cells (Loke et al, 1989.<br>
Characterization of oligonucleotide transport into living cells. PNAS USA 86:3474.), in a<br>
saturable mechanism predicted to involve specific receptors (Yakubov et al, 1989. PNAS USA<br>
86:6454.).<br>
A "ribozyme" is an RNA molecule that possesses RNA catalytic ability (see Cech for review)<br>
and cleaves a specific site in a target RNA.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, ribozymes which cleave RTP801 mRNA may be<br>
utilized as RTP801 inhibitors. This may be necessary in cases where antisense therapy is limited<br>
by stoichiometric considerations (Sarver et al., 1990, Gene Regulation and Aids, pp. 305-325).<br>
Ribozymes can then be used that will target the RTP801 sequence. The number of RNA<br>
molecules that are cleaved by a ribozyme is greater than the number predicted by<br>
stochiochemistry. (Hampel and Tritz, 1989; Uhlenbeck, 1987).<br>
Ribozymes catalyze the phosphodiester bond cleavage of RNA. Several ribozyme structural<br>
families have been identified including Group I introns, RNase P, the hepatitis delta virus<br>
ribozyme, hammerhead ribozymes and the hairpin ribozyme originally derived from the<br>
negative strand of the tobacco ringspot virus satellite RNA (sTRSV) (Sullivan, 1994; U.S. Pat.<br>
No. 5,225,347, columns 4-5). The latter two families are derived from viroids and virusoids, in<br>
which the ribozyme is believed to separate monomers from oligomers created during rolling<br>
circle replication (Symons, 1989 and 1992). Hammerhead and hairpin ribozyme motifs are most<br>
commonly adapted for trans-cleavage of mRNAs for gene therapy (Sullivan, 1994). The<br>
ribozyme type utilized in the present invention is selected as is Known in the art. Hairpin<br>
ribozymes are now in clinical trial and are the preferred type. In general the ribozyme is from<br>
30-100 nucleotides in length. Delivery of ribozymes is similar to that of AS fragments and/or<br>
siRNA molecules.<br>
It will be noted that all the polynucleotides to be used in the present invention may undergo<br>
modifications so as to possess improved therapeutic properties. Modifications or analogs of<br>
nucleotides can be introduced to improve the therapeutic properties of polynucleotides.<br>
Improved properties include increased nuclease resistance and/or increased ability to permeate<br>
cell membranes. Nuclease resistance, where needed, is provided by any method known in the art<br>
that does not interfere with biological activity of the AS polynucleotide, siRNA, cDNA and/or<br>
ribozymes as needed for the method of use and delivery (Iyer et al., 1990; Eckstein, 1985;<br>
Spitzer and Eckstein, 1988; Woolf et al., 1990; Shaw et al., 1991). Modifications that can be<br>
made to oligonucleotides in order to enhance nuclease resistance include modifying the<br>
phophorous or oxygen heteroatom in the phosphate backbone. These include preparing methyl<br>
phosphonates, phosphorothioates, phosphorodithioates and morpholino oligomers. In one<br>
embodiment it is provided by having phosphorothioate bonds linking between the four to six 3'-<br>
terminus nucleotide bases. Alternatively, phosphorothioate bonds link all the nucleotide bases.<br>
Other modifications known in the art may be used where the biological activity is retained, but<br>
the stability to nucleases is substantially increased.<br>
All analogues of, or modifications to, a polynucleotide may be employed with the present<br>
invention, provided that said analogue or modification does not substantially affect the function<br>
of the polynucleotide. The nucleotides can be selected from naturally occurring or synthetic<br>
modified bases. Naturally occurring bases include adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymine and<br>
uracil. Modified bases of nucleotides include inosine, xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2- aminoadenine,<br>
6-methyl, 2-propyl and other alkyl adenines, 5-halo uracil, 5-halo cytosine, 6-aza cytosine and<br>
6-aza thymine, psuedo uracil, 4- thiuracil, 8-halo adenine, 8-aminoadenine, 8-thiol adenine, 8-<br>
thiolalkyl adenines, 8-hydroxyl adenine and other 8-substituted adenines, 8-halo guanines, 8-<br>
amino guanine, 8-thiol guanine, 8-thioalkyl guanines, 8- hydroxyl guanine and other substituted<br>
guanines, other aza and deaza adenines, other aza and deaza guanines, 5-trifluoromethyl uracil<br>
and 5- trifluoro cytosine.<br>
In addition, analogues of polynucleotides can be prepared wherein the structure of the<br>
nucleotide is fundamentally altered and that are better suited as therapeutic or experimental<br>
reagents. An example of a nucleotide analogue is a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) wherein the<br>
deoxyribose (or ribose) phosphate backbone in DNA (or RNA is replaced with a polyamide<br>
backbone which is similar to that found in peptides. PNA analogues have been shown to be<br>
resistant to degradation by enzymes and to have extended lives in vivo and in vitro. Further,<br>
PNAs have been shown to bind stronger to a complementary DNA sequence than a DNA<br>
molecule. This observation is attributed to the lack of charge repulsion between the PNA strand<br>
and the DNA strand. Other modifications that can be made to oligonucleotides include polymer<br>
backbones, cyclic backbones, or acyclic backbones.<br>
The polypeptides employed in the present invention may also be modified, optionally<br>
chemically modified, in order to improve their therapeutic activity. "Chemically modified" -<br>
when referring to the polypeptides, means a polypeptide where at least one of its amino acid<br>
residues is modified either by natural processes, such as processing or other post-translational<br>
modifications, or by chemical modification techniques which are well known in the art. Among<br>
the numerous known modifications typical, but not exclusive examples include: acetylation,<br>
acylation, amidation, ADP-ribosylation, glycosylation, GPI anchor formation, covalent<br>
attachment of a lipid or lipid derivative, methylation, myristlyation, pegylation, prenylation,<br>
phosphorylation, ubiqutination, or any similar process.<br>
Additional possible polypeptide modifications (such as those resulting from nucleic acid<br>
sequence alteration) include the following:<br>
"Conservative substitution" - refers to the substitution of an amino acid in one class by an amino<br>
acid of the same class, where a class is defined by common physicochemical amino acid side<br>
chain properties and high substitution frequencies in homologous polypeptides found in nature,<br>
as determined, for example, by a standard Dayhoff frequency exchange matrix or BLOSUM<br>
matrix. Six general classes of amino acid side chains have been categorized and include: Class I<br>
(Cys); Class II (Ser, Thr, Pro, Ala, Gly); Class III (Asn, Asp, Gin, Glu); Class IV (His, Arg,<br>
Lys); Class V (He, Leu, Val, Met); and Class VI (Phe, Tyr, Tip). For example, substitution of an<br>
Asp for another class III residue such as Asn, Gin, or Glu, is a conservative substitution.<br>
"Non-conservative substitution" - refers to the substitution of an amino acid in one class with an<br>
amino acid from another class; for example, substitution of an Ala, a class II residue, with a<br>
class III residue such as Asp, Asn, Glu, or Gin.<br>
"Deletion" - is a change in either nucleotide or amino acid sequence in which one or more<br>
nucleotides or amino acid residues, respectively, are absent.<br>
"Insertion" or "addition" - is that change in a nucleotide or amino acid sequence which has<br>
resulted in the addition of one or more nucleotides or amino acid residues, respectively, as<br>
compared to the naturally occurring sequence.<br>
"Substitution" - replacement of one or more nucleotides or amino acids by different nucleotides<br>
or amino acids, respectively. As regards amino acid sequences the substitution may be<br>
conservative or non- conservative.<br>
In an additional embodiment of the present invention, the RTP801 polypeptide or<br>
polynucleotide may be used to diagnose or detect macular degeneration in a subject. A detection<br>
method would typically comprise assaying for RTP801 mRNA or RTP801 polypeptide in a<br>
sample derived from a subject.<br>
"Detection" - refers to a method of detection of a disease. This term may refer to detection of a<br>
predisposition to a disease, or to the detection of the severity of the disease.<br>
By "homolog/homology", as utilized in the present invention, is meant at least about 70%,<br>
preferably at least about 75% homology, advantageously at least about 80% homology, more<br>
advantageously at least about 90% homology, even more advantageously at least about 95%,<br>
e.g., at least about 97%, about 98%, about 99% or even about 100% homology. The invention<br>
also comprehends that these polynucleotides and polypeptides can be used in the same fashion<br>
as the herein or aforementioned polynucleotides and polypeptides.<br>
Alternatively or additionally, "homology", with respect to sequences, can refer to the number of<br>
positions with identical nucleotides or amino acid residues, divided by the number of<br>
nucleotides or amino acid residues in the shorter of the two sequences, wherein alignment of the<br>
two sequences can be determined in accordance with the Wilbur and Lipman algorithm ((1983)<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:726); for instance, using a window size of 20 nucleotides, a word<br>
length of 4 nucleotides, and a gap penalty of 4, computer-assisted analysis and interpretation of<br>
the sequence data, including alignment, can be conveniently performed using commercially<br>
available programs (e.g., Intelligenetics™ Suite, Intelligenetics Inc., CA). When RNA<br>
sequences are said to be similar, or to have a degree of sequence identity or homology with<br>
DNA sequences, thymidine (T) in the DNA sequence is considered equal to uracil (U) in the<br>
RNA sequence. RNA sequences within the scope of the invention can be derived from DNA<br>
sequences or their complements, by substituting thymidine (T) in the DNA sequence with uracil<br>
(U).<br>
Additionally or alternatively, amino acid sequence similarity or homology can be determined,<br>
for instance, using the BlastP program (Altschul et al., Nucl. Acids Res. 25:3389-3402) and<br>
available at NCBI. The following references provide algorithms for comparing the relative<br>
identity or homology of amino acid residues of two polypeptides, and additionally, or<br>
alternatively, with respect to the foregoing, the teachings in these references can be used for<br>
determining percent homology: Smith et al,, (1981) Adv. Appl. Math. 2:482-489; Smith et al.,<br>
(1983) Nucl. Acids Res. 11:2205-2220; Devereux et al., (1984) Nucl. Acids Res. 12:387-395;<br>
Feng et al., (1987) J. Molec. Evol. 25:351-360; Higgins et al., (1989) CABIOS 5:151-153; and<br>
Thompson etal., (1994) Nucl. Acids Res. 22:4673-4680.<br>
"Having at least X% homolgy" - with respect to two amino acid or nucleotide sequences, refers<br>
to the percentage of residues that are identical in the two sequences when the sequences are<br>
optimally aligned. Thus, 90% amino acid sequence identity means that 90% of the amino acids<br>
in two or more optimally aligned polypeptide sequences are identical.<br>
An additional embodiment of the present invention concerns a pharmaceutical composition<br>
comprising an RTP801 inhibitor in a therapeutical ly affective amount as an active ingredient<br>
and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The inhibitor may be a biological inhibitor, an<br>
organic molecule, a chemical molecule, etc. said pharmaceutical composition may comprise an<br>
RTP801 inhibitor which is a polynucleotide which comprises consecutive nucleotides having a<br>
sequence which is an antisense sequence to the sequence set forth in Figure 1 (SEQ ID No: 1).<br>
Further, the RTP801 inhibitor may be a vector comprising these polynucleotides. Additionally,<br>
the RTP801 inhibitor may be a monoclonal antibody which specifically binds to an epitope<br>
comprising 4-25 amino acids set forth in Figure 2 (SEQ ID No:2), or an RNA molecule which<br>
targets the RTP801 gene mRNA such as an siRNA molecule (optionally depicted in Tables A-C<br>
and in particular, siRNA Nos: 22,23,25,27, 39,41, 42, 49 and 50 of Table A) or a ribozyme.<br>
The active ingredients of the pharmaceutical composition can include oligonucleotides that are<br>
nuclease resistant needed for the practice of the invention or a fragment thereof shown to have<br>
the same effect targeted against the appropriate sequence(s) and/or ribozymes. Combinations of<br>
active ingredients as disclosed in the present invention can be used, including combinations of<br>
antisense sequences.<br>
An additional embodiment of the present invention provides for the use of a therapeutically<br>
effective dose of an RTP801 inhibitor for the preparation of a medicament for promoting<br>
recovery in a patient suffering from spinal cord disease or injury. In one embodiment the<br>
inhibitor is preferably an siRNA. In another embodiment the inhibitor is preferably Structure A<br>
depicted herein.<br>
The invention has been described in an illustrative manner, and it is to be understood that the<br>
terminology which has been used is intended to be in the nature of words of description rather than<br>
of limitation.<br>
Obviously, many modifications and variations of the present invention are possible in light of the<br>
above teachings. It is, therefore, to be understood that within the scope of the appended claims, the<br>
invention can be practiced otherwise than as specifically described.<br>

Example 1<br>
General Materials and methods<br>
If not indicated to the contrary, the following materials and methods were used in Examples 1-5:<br>
Cell culture<br>
The first human cell line, namely HeLa cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured<br>
as follows: Hela cells (American Type Culture Collection) were cultured as described in<br>
Czauderna F et al. (Czauderna, F., Fechtner, M., Aygun, H., Arnold, W., Klippel, A., Giese, K.<br>
&amp; Kaufmann, J. (2003). Nucleic Acids Res, 31, 670-82).<br>
The second human cell line was a human keratinozyte cell line which was cultivated as follows:<br>
Human keratinocytes were cultured at 37 °C in Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM)<br>
containing 10% FCS.<br>
The mouse cell line was B16V (American Type Culture Collection) cultured at 37 °C in<br>
Dulbecco's modified Eagle medium (DMEM) containing 10% FCS. Culture conditions were as<br>
described in Methods Find Exp Clin Pharmacol. 1997 May; 19(4):231-9:<br>
In each case, the cells were subject to the experiments as described herein at a density of about<br>
50,000 cells per well and the double-stranded nucleic acid according to the present invention<br>
was added at 20 nM, whereby the double-stranded nucleic acid was complexed using 1 ng/ml of<br>
a proprietary lipid.<br>
Induction ofhypoxia-like condition<br>
The cells were treated with CoCb for inducing a hypoxia-like condition as follows: siRNA<br>
transfections were carried out in 10-cm plates (30-50% confluency) as described by (Czauderna<br>
et al., 2003; Kretschmer et al., 2003). Briefly, siRNA were transfected by adding a preformed<br>
1 Ox concentrated complex of GB and lipid in serum-free medium to cells in complete medium.<br>
The total transfection volume was 10 ml. The final lipid concentration was 1.0 ug/ml; the final<br>
siRNA concentration was 20 nM unless otherwise stated. Induction of the hypoxic responses<br>
was carried out by adding CoCh (lOOuM) directly to the tissue culture medium 24 h before<br>
lysis.<br>
Preparation of cell extracts and immuno blotting<br>
The preparation of cell extracts and immuno blot analysis were carried out essentially as<br>
described by Klippel et al. (Klippel, A., Escobedo, M.A., Wachowicz, M.S., Apell, G., Brown,<br>
T.W., Giedlin, M.A., Kavanaugh, W.M. &amp; Williams, L.T. (1998). Mol Cell Biol, 18, 5699-711;<br>
Klippel, A., Reinhard, C., Kavanaugh, W.M., Apell, G., Escobedo, M.A. &amp; Williams, L.T.<br>
(1996). Mol Cell Biol, 16, 4117-27). Polyclonal antibodies against full length RTP801 were<br>
generated by immunising rabbits with recombinant RTP801 protein producing bacteria from<br>
pET19-b expression vector (Merck Biosciences GmbH, Schwalbach, Germany). The murine<br>
monoclonal anti-pi lOa and anti-p85 antibodies have been described by Klippel et aJ. (supra).<br>
Example 2<br>
Reduction of RTP801 expression in a first human cell line<br>
Various double-stranded nucleic acids were prepared. Their location relative to the mRNA and<br>
CDS as well as human SNPs in the nucleic acid coding for human RTP801 (databank accession<br>
no. NM_019058) is depicted in Figure 3. The first human cell line was contacted with said<br>
double-stranded nucleic acids as described in example 1. Upon induction of a hypoxia-like<br>
condition and treatment with said double-stranded nucleic acids the cells were lysed and the cell<br>
lysates subjected to immunoblotting. pi lOa, which is a catalytic unit of the PI3-kinase, and p85<br>
were used as loading controls. The intensity of the RTP801 band as visualised using the<br>
RTP801 polyclonal antibodies is a measure of the activity of the individual double-stranded<br>
nucleic acids in terms of reducing the expression level of RTP801.<br>
Each and any of the double-stranded nucleic acids has been such modified such that a 2' O-Me<br>
group was present on the first, third, fifth, seventh, ninth, eleventh, thirteenth, fifteenth,<br>
seventeenth and nineteenth nucleotide of the antisense strand, whereby the very same<br>
modification, i. e. a 2'-O-Me group was present at the second, fourth, sixth, eighth, tenth,<br>
twelfth, fourteenth, sixteenth and eighteenth nucleotide of the sense strand. Additionally, it is to<br>
be noted that in case of these particular nucleic acids according to the present invention the first<br>
stretch is identical to the first strand and the second stretch is identical to the second strand and<br>
these nucleic acids are also blunt ended.<br>
The experiments were performed twice and the individual results shown in Figs. 4A to H, where<br>
they are designated as experiment 1 and experiment 2, respectively.<br>
The representations h, hr and hmr in Figs. 4A to H indicate that the respective double-stranded<br>
nucleic acid was designed such as to address a section of the RTP801 mRNA which is specific<br>
for human RTP801 mRNA (h), to address a section of the RTP801 mRNA which is specific for<br>
human and rat RTP801 mRNA (hr) and to address a section of the RTP801 mRNA which is<br>
specific for human, mouse and rat RTP801 mRNA (hmr). The double-stranded nucleic acid<br>
referred to as no. 40.1 was used as a positive control and untreated cells (UT+) were used as<br>
negative control.<br>
In accordance with the results, the following double-stranded nucleic acids turned out to be<br>
particularly useful in down-regulating the expression of RTP801: no. 14, no. 15, no. 20, no. 21,<br>
no. 22, no. 23, no. 24, no. 25, no. 27, no. 39, no. 40, no. 41, no. 42, no. 43, no. 44, no. 49 and no.<br>
50 (see Table A).<br>
Example3<br>
Reduction of RTP801 expression in a second human cell line<br>
The experiments as described in connection with Example 2 were repeated using the second<br>
human cell line as specified in Example 1 and the results are depicted in Figs. 5A to F.<br>
As may be deduced from these figures, the results as obtained in connection with the<br>
experiments described in Example 2, were confirmed using this second human cell line.<br>
Example 4<br>
Dosage effect of RTP801-specific double-stranded nucleic acids<br>
In this experiment, the dosage effect of RTP801-specific double-stranded nucleic acids was<br>
investigated.<br>
For that purpose, the HeLa cells treated as in connection with Examples 2 and 3, whereby the<br>
concentration of double-stranded nucleic acid in the cultivation broth was 10 nM, 5 nM and 1<br>
nM. As positive control, double-stranded nucleic acid no. 40.1 was used, as negative control<br>
untreated cells (UT+). The read out was the same as described in connection with Examples 2<br>
and 3. The particular double-stranded nucleic acids used were those with internal reference<br>
numbers 14, 22, 23 and 27 which are directed to stretches on the RTP801 mRNA which are<br>
shared by humans, mice and rats, and double-stranded nucleic acid with internal reference<br>
numbers 39 and 42 which are directed to stretches of the RTP801 mRNA specific for human<br>
RTP801.<br>
The results are shown in Fig. 6A to C. From said figures it can be taken that there is a clear<br>
concentration dependency of the effect of the double-stranded nucleic acids specific for<br>
RTP801, whereby the nucleic acid molecules having internal reference numbers 1, 15, 20, 21,<br>
24, 40,41, 43, 44,, 22, 23, 27, 39, 42,40.1, 44.1, and 14, preferably 22,23,27, 39, 42,40.1 and<br>
44.1 and more preferably 14, 23 and 27 and preferably each of said nucleic acid molecule<br>
having the particular modification pattern as described for them in the example part herein are<br>
particularly effective<br>
Example 5<br>
Species specificity of the RTP801-specific double-stranded nucleic acid<br>
The double-stranded nucleic acids according to the present invention have been designed against<br>
stretches of the RTP801 mRNA which are the same or different in various species. To test<br>
whether there is a species specificity of a RTP801-specific double-stranded nucleic acid, the<br>
double-stranded nucleic acids with internal reference numbers 14, 22, 23 and 27 which address a<br>
stretch of the RTP801 mRNA which is conserved among human, mouse and rat RTP801<br>
mRNA, and the double-stranded nucleic acids with internal reference numbers 39 and 42 which<br>
address a stretch of the RTP801 mRNA which is specific for human RTP801 mRNA, i. e. which<br>
addresses a stretch which as such is not present in mouse or rat, were compared in terms of<br>
down-regulating RTP801 using the same approach and read-out as specified in Examples 1 and<br>
2.<br>
Although all of the double-stranded nucleic acids used are in principle active against human<br>
mRNA and, as shown in the preceding examples, are also suitable to down-regulate the<br>
expression of RTP801, upon using a mouse cell line only those double-stranded nucleic acids<br>
which are also specific for mouse RTP801 mRNA effectively reduced RTP801 expression,<br>
namely double-stranded nucleic acids nos. 14, 22,23 and 27.<br>
From this result it can be concluded that it is possible to design RTP801 addressing doublestranded<br>
nucleic acids which are specific for one or several species. This allows use of the very<br>
same molecule in animal models as well as in man.<br>
Example 6<br>
Experimental models, methods and results relating to Macular Degeneration<br>
The compounds of the present invention were tested in the following an animal model of<br>
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV). This hallmark of wet AMD is induced in model animals<br>
by laser treatment.<br>
A) MOUSE MODEL<br>
Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) induction<br>
Choroid neovascularization (CNV), a hallmark of wet AMD, was triggered by laser<br>
photocoagulation (532 nm, 200 mW, 100 ms, 75 urn) (OcuLight GL, Index, Mountain View,<br>
CA) performed on both eyes of each mouse on day 0 by a single individual masked to drug<br>
group assignment. Laser spots were applied in a standardized fashion around the optic nerve,<br>
using a slit lamp delivery system and a cover slip as a contact lens.<br>
Treatment groups<br>
CNV was induced in the following groups of mice (males 6-8 weeks of age):<br>
 (l)12WTmice;<br>
(2) 12 RTP801 Knock-Out mice;<br>
(3) 12 WT mice injected with 0.25 fig of synthetic stabilized active anti-RTP801<br>
siRNA (REDD 14) in one eye and inactive anti-RTP801 siRNA (REDD8 -<br>
negative control) in the fellow eye, at days 0 and 7;<br>
(4) 12 WT mice injected with 0.25 \ig of synthetic stabilized active anti-RTP801<br>
siRNA (REDD 14) in one eye and inactive anti-GFP siRNA (negative control) in<br>
the fellow eye at days 0 and 7;<br>
(5) 12 WT mice injected with either 0.1 ug of synthetic stabilized active anti-<br>
RTP801 siRNA (REDD 14) in one eye and PBS (negative control) in the fellow<br>
eye at days 0 and 7;<br>
(6) 12 WT mice injected with either 0.05 ug of synthetic stabilized active anti-RTP801<br>
siRNA (REDD14) in one eye and PBS (negative control) in the fellow eye at days 0 and<br>
7.<br>
Both eyes of each mouse were laser-treated. The volume injected was 2 \i\.<br>
Evaluation<br>
1. The experiment was terminated at day 14. For evaluation, the eyes were enucleated and<br>
fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 4°C. The neurosensory retina was<br>
detached and severed from the optic nerve. The remaining RPE-choroid-sclera complex<br>
was flat mounted in Immu-Mount (Vectashield Mounting Medium, Vector) and<br>
coverslipped. Flat mounts were examined with a scanning laser confocal microscope<br>
(TCS SP, Leica, Germany). Vessels were visualized by exciting with blue argon laser.<br>
Horizontal optical sections (1 urn step) were obtained from the surface of the RPEchoroid-<br>
sclera complex. The deepest focal plane in which the surrounding choroidal<br>
vascular network connecting to the lesion could be identified was judged to be the floor<br>
of the lesion. Any vessel in the laser treated area and superficial to this reference plane<br>
was judged as CNV. Images of each section were digitally stored. The area of CNVrelated<br>
fluorescence was measured by computerized image analysis using the Leica TCS<br>
SP software. The summation of whole fluorescent area in each horizontal section was<br>
used as an index for the volume of CNV.<br>
2. Separate WT mice (5 eyes per group) were used for evaluating RTP801 mRNA<br>
expression in CNV (as well as the expression of other genes relevant to AMD)<br>
(untreated and treated with siRNA) using real-time PCR on RNA extracted from<br>
RPE/choroids, or from neural retina.<br>
Results<br>
1. RTP801 KO mice displayed 30% less blood vessel leakage compared to WT mice<br>
following CNV induction; see Figure 8.<br>
2. Synthetic stabilized siRNA against RTP801, REDD14, elicited a dose-dependent<br>
reduction of the CNV volume. A maximum of -70% inhibition compared to PBSinjected<br>
eyes was achieved at a REDD 14 (sequence No. 14 in table 1, SEQ ID No.s 16<br>
(sense) and 66 (antisense)) dose of 0.25 ug per eye. At the same dose, both negative<br>
control siRNAs, REDD8 and anti-GFP siRNA, displayed only 27% and 33% CNV<br>
volume reduction respectively, supporting both the superior efficacy of REDD 14 and<br>
also the specificity of its effect.<br>
B) NON-HUMAN PRIMATE MODEL<br>
CNV induction<br>
Eight male cynomoglus monkeys (Macaco fascicularis) 2-6 years of age were used for the<br>
study. Choroidal neovascularization (CNV) was induced by perimacular laser treatment of both<br>
eyes prior to doseadministration. Nine lesions were placed in the macula with a laser [OcuLight<br>
GL (532 nrn) Laser Photo-coagulator with an IRIS Medical® Portable Slit Lamp Adaptor], and<br>
laser spots in the right eye were mirror the placement in the left eye. The approximate laser<br>
parameters were as follows: spot size: 50-100 urn diameter; laser power: 300-700 milliwatts;<br>
exposure time: 0.1 seconds.<br>
Treatment<br>
Immediately following laser treatment, both eyes of all animals were subjected to a single<br>
intravitreal injection. Left eye was dosed with 350 ug of synthetic stabilized siRNA against<br>
RTP801 (the same one used in the mouse study) in the final volume of 50 ul, whereas the<br>
contralateral eye received 50 ul of PBS (vehicle).<br>
Evaluation<br>
1. All the animals were subjected to daily examination of food consumption and body<br>
weight measurements.<br>
2. 2 monkeys were euthanized at day 6 following CNV induction. Their eyes were<br>
enucleated and posterior pole was flattened. Then the fovea region was excised and<br>
separated into choroids and neuroretina which were separately (for every animal) frozen<br>
in liquid nitrogen to be subsequentlyused for UNA extraction and real time PCR<br>
evaluation of RTP801 expression.<br>
3. Fluorescein angiograms were performed pre-study, and at the end of weeks 1, 2, and 3<br>
following CNV induction. Photographs were taken, using a fundus camera (TRC-50EX<br>
Retina Camera). Images were captured using the TOPCON IMAGEnet™ system.<br>
Fluorescein dye (10% fluorescein sodium, approximately 0.1 mL/kg) was injected via<br>
vascular access ports. Photographs were taken at several timepoints following dye<br>
injection, to include the arterial phase, early arteriovenous phase and several late<br>
arteriovenous phases in order to evaluate neovascularization snd to monitor leakage of<br>
fluorescein associated with CNV lesions. Interpretation and analysis of the fluorescein<br>
angiograms was independently conducted by two ophthalmologists.<br>
Neovascularization (NV) was assessed in early angiograms and every spot was graded<br>
according to the following scheme:<br>
0 - no signs of NV<br>
0.5 - suspicious spot<br>
1 - "hot" spot<br>
2 - NV in the laser burn<br>
112<br>
3 - evident NV<br>
Leakage was assessed according to the following scheme:<br>
0 - no leakage<br>
0.5 - suspicious spot<br>
1 - evident small spot leakage<br>
2 - leakage growing with time<br>
3 ~ leakage greater than previous borders (evidently)<br>
In addition, the size of every spot was compared between the early and the late angiograms<br>
using morphometric measurements, and the increase in the spot's size resulting from the leakage<br>
was calculated.<br>
4. Electroretinograms (ERGs) were recorded using an Epic 2000 electroretinograph<br>
according to Sierra's SOPs and the study-specific SOP, including the use of the<br>
Ganzfield apparatus, at prestudy and in the end of week 3 The tabulated ERG data were<br>
evaluated by a veterinary ophthalmologist.<br>
The study was terminated at day 21 post CNV induction. Gross necropsy and histological<br>
examination were performed on organs and tissues including the eyes.<br>
Results<br>
1. siRNA against RTP801 reduced RTP801 expression in the'RPE/choroids of laser-treated<br>
animals, as measured at day 6 post CNV induction by real-time PCR (see Figure 10).<br>
2. Comparison of the spot grading for leakage and neovascularization between the fellow eyes<br>
in each individual monkey revealed that both of these pathological characteristics were<br>
diminished in the eyes injected with RTP801 siRNA as compared to the control (for leakage<br>
results, see Figure 11; for neovascularization results, see Figure 12).<br>
3. Calculation of the overall number of spots with higher clinically-relevant grades (2 and 3) of<br>
leakage or neovascularization in all siRNA-injected eyes compared to all PBS-injected eyes<br>
again revealed that siRNA injected eyes were less affected (see Figure 13, a+b).<br>
4, The overall grading data for leakage of spots and neovascularisation was subjected to<br>
statistical evaluation. The existence of differences between the siRNA and control treatments<br>
was analyzed by calculating the delta between the mean spot ranks of the control right (R)<br>
eye and siRNA-injected left (L) eye (delta=R-L). The significance of the difference was<br>
calculated using a non-parametric statistical method, Wilcoxon signed ranks test - a one tail<br>
test. Different phases of angiograms (early arterial, arterio-venous and late venous) were<br>
analyzed separately for every week (1,2, and 3).<br>
Table 1 shows the significance (one tail test) of leakage rank difference from 0 for each<br>
group (p-values 
left eyes (siRNA treated) with respect to the right (Placebo treated) in week 2 and 3 in the<br>
late angiograms.<br>
TABLE 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Note that late angiograms are usually utilized for evaluation of leakage parameters.<br>
Table 2 shows the significance (one tail test) of neovascularization (NV) rank difference<br>
from 0 for each group (p-values 
TABLE 2<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
A significant NV rank reduction was found in the left eyes with respect to the right in week 2<br>
and 3 in the early period and in the Arterio Venus period in week 2.<br>
Note that early angiograms are usually utilized for evaluation of neovascularization parameters.<br>
5. Quantitative morphornetric evaluation of the increase in area of the spots occurring between<br>
early (arterial phase) and late (venous phase) angiograms due to the leakage revealed that<br>
this parameter was significantly reduced in the laser spots within siRNA-injected eyes (left<br>
eyes, OS) compared to control (right eyes, OD). Two examples are shown in Figure 14. The<br>
graphs demonstrate the relative increase (in %) in the area of every spot in the left and right<br>
eye of animals #3315 and 3300.<br>
Additionally, it was noted throughout all the above studies that anti RTP-801 siRNA had no<br>
adverse effects on electroretinograms (ERG), on eye histology or on structure and function of<br>
other organs and systems.<br>
To summarize the above experiments and results:<br>
1. Both genetic (RTP801 -/-) and therapeutic siRNA inhibition of RTP801 expression in the<br>
laser-induced CNV model of wet age-related macular degeneration (wet AMD) result in<br>
significant reduction of the CNV volume.<br>
2. Positive results were obtained in mouse and non-human primate model.<br>
3. Pathological and ERG examination in monkey did not reveal any siRNA-mediated<br>
toxicity either in eyes or in any other organs or systems.<br>
C) EFFICACY OF COMBINATION THERAPY OF RTP801 SIRNA (REDD 14) AND ANTIVEGF<br>
ANTIBODY<br>
The efficacy of combination therapy of RTP801 siRNA (REDD14) and anti-VEGF antibody in<br>
the treatment of diseases in which CNV occurs was tested in the above mouse CNV model.<br>
A) CNV volume studies<br>
The volume of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) 3 weeks after laser injury was computed<br>
byconfocal fluorescence microscopy as previously described (Sakurai et al. IOVS 2003;44:<br>
3578-85 &amp; Sakurai et al. IOVS 2003; 44: 2743-2749).<br><br>
In previous studies we found that anti-VEGF-A antibody (Ab) reduced CNV volume in a dose<br>
dependent fashion. A dose of 1 ng of VEGF-A Ab was chosen for the REDD14+VEGF-A Ab<br>
combination studies because this dose had an intermediate inhibitory effect: VEGF-A Ab (1 ng)<br>
reduced the size of CNV by 26±6%.<br>
The principal findings of the REDD 14 + VEGF-A antibody (Ab) study are:<br>
• The addition of REDD 14 at the lower 0.05 ng dose reduced the size of CNV by 27±4%<br>
compared to VEGF-A Ab alone.<br>
• The addition of REDD14 at the higher 0.25 ug dose reduced the size of CNV by 55±3%<br>
compared to VEGF-A Ab alone.<br>
B) CNV leakage studies<br>
Experiment 1<br>
This experiment was designed in order to identify a potential additive or synergistic therapeutic<br>
effect of inhibition of VEGF and RTP801 in the model of laser-induced choroid<br>
neovascularization in mice<br>
Materials:<br>
• REDD 14 (RTP801 siRNA)<br>
• REDD8 (negative control)<br>
• Anti-VEGF antibodies<br>
• Non-specific IgG (negative control)<br>
CNV was induced on day zero as described above; the test material was injected to the subjects<br>
on day zero and day 7.<br>
The results were evaluated by Fluorescein angiography on weeks 1,2, 3, and by CNV volume<br>
measurement on week 3. each test group was composed of 10 eyes.<br>
Experimental groups:<br>
• VEGF Ab 0.5 ng/eye<br>
• VEGF Ab 1 ng/eye<br>
• VEGF Ab 2 ng/ eye<br>
• VEGF Ab 4 ng/eye<br>
• REDD 14 0.05 ug/eye<br>
• REDD 14 0.1 ug/eye<br>
• REDD 14 0.25 ug/eye<br>
• REDD 14 0.05 ug/eye + VEGF Ab 1 ng/eye<br>
• REDD 140.1 ug/eye + VEGF Ab 1 ng/eye<br>
• REDD 14 0.25 ug/eye + VEGF Ab I ng/eye<br>
Control groups<br>
• PBS<br>
• Non-specific IgG 2 ng/eye<br>
• REDDS 0.1 ug/eye<br>
• REDDS 0.1 ug/eye + VEGF Ab 1 ng/eye<br>
Results<br>
The results of the above experiment are presented in Figures 23-24. These results show that<br>
simultaneous intravitreal administration of VEGF Ab and REDD 14 leads to augmented and<br>
dose-dependent inhibition of Choroid neovascularization and Choroid blood vessel leakage, as<br>
expressed in reduced incidence of Grade 4 spots and increased incidence of Grade 1 spots.<br>
Angiograms were graded using a modification of a semi-quantitative grading (1-4) scheme<br>
previously published (Sakurai et al. IOVS 2003; 44: 2743-2749). Grade 1 lesions are considered<br>
as never having formed, i.e., equivalent to complete prevention. Grade 4 lesions are considered<br>
pathologically significant, i.e., equivalent to lesions that would be treated in patients.VEGF-A<br>
Ab (1 ng) reduced the incidence of Grade 4 lesions per eye by 38±8% and increased the<br>
incidence of Grade 1 lesions per eye by 66±43%.<br>
The principal findings of the REDD 14 + VEGF-A Ab combination leakage study are:<br>
• The addition of REDD 14 at the lower 0.05 ug dose reduced the incidence of Grade 4 lesions<br>
by 66±12% compared to VEGF-A Ab alone.<br>
• The addition of REDD 14 at the higher 0.25 ng dose reduced the incidence of Grade 4 lesions<br>
by 60± 12% compared to VEGF-A Ab alone.<br>
• The addition of REDD 14 at the higher 0.25 jig dose doubled (100±34%) the incidence of<br>
Grade 1 lesions compared to VEGF-A Ab alone.<br>
118<br>
Experiment 2<br>
This experiment was designed in order to study the effect of REDD 14 on gene expression in<br>
RPE and neural retina.<br>
Experimental design<br>
Groups:<br>
• PBS<br>
• REDD 14 0.25 mg<br>
The Group size was 5 eyes. CNV was induced by laser treatment as described above on day<br>
zero; the test material was also injected on day zero, and the effect evaluated by qPCR analysis<br>
of gene expression in RPE and neural retina on days zero and 5.<br>
Results<br>
The results of the above experiment are presented in Figure 25. These results show that the<br>
administration of REDD 14 causes:<br>
• -40% downregulation of RTP801 expression below the baseline both in RPE and<br>
in neural retina (see also Figure 26);<br>
• ~ 70% upregulation of PEDF expression over the baseline in neural retina (note:<br>
in PBS-injected eyes expression of PEDF is 40% downregulated below the<br>
baseline)<br>
• -40% downregulation of VEGF164 expression below the baseline in RPE (note:<br>
in PBS-injected eyes, expression of VEGF164 is 20% downregulated)<br>
• -50% reduction of MCP1 expression in RPE/choroids (Figure 26)<br>
General conclusions from both experiments:<br>
• Simultaneous inhibition of RTP801 and VEGF has enhanced inhibitory effect on<br>
choroid neovascularization and neovascular leakage.<br>
• Inhibition of RTP801 expression by REDD 14 not only prevents PEDF<br>
downregulation in the CNV model but enhances its expression compared to the<br>
baseline.<br>
• Inhibition of RTP801 expression leads to concomitant downregulation of MCP1<br>
which should have an anti-inflammatory effect.<br>
• Without being bound by theory, the increase of PEDF expression by REDD 14 may<br>
underlie the observed cooperative effect of simultaneous inhibition of VEGF and<br>
RTP801<br>
(Note: PEDF is a well-known antiangiogenic and neuroprotective factor.)<br>
• Without being bound by theory, the reduction of MCP1 expression by REDD14<br>
may also underlie the observed cooperative effect of simultaneous inhibition of<br>
VEGF and RTP801<br>
(Note: MCP1 is a known pro-inflammatory chemokine involved in pathogenesis of AMD.)<br>
Additional AMD models which may be used to test the methods of the present invention:<br>
• Ccl-2 or Ccr-2 deficient animals - deficiency in either of these proteins causes<br>
the development of some of the main features of AMD. Animals deficient in<br>
these proteins can be used to test the methods of the present invention.<br>
For further information on AMD animal models, see: Chader, Vision research 42 (2002) 393-<br>
399; Ambati et al., Nature Medicine 9(11) (2003) 1390-1397; Tolentino et al., Retina 24 (2004)<br>
132-138.<br>
D) Comparison of activity of REDD 14 anti RTP801 siRNA possessing a 3'phosphate group<br>
on each strand with the same molecule lacking 3' phosphates (REDD14NP) in the laserinduced<br>
CNV model.<br>
The experiment was generally performed and evaluated as described above. One eye of each<br>
mouse (12 per group) was injected with 0.25 ug of REDD 14 siRNA whereas another eye was<br>
injected with REDD MNP siRNA.<br>
Results<br>
Both siRNAs equally efficiently reduced CNV volume (Fig. 27).<br>
Example 7<br>
Models and results relating to COPD and Emphysema<br>
The compounds of the present invention were tested in the following an animal models:<br>
* Cigarette smoke-induced emphysema model: chronic exposure to cigarette smoke causes<br>
emphysema in several animals such as, inter alia, mouse, guinea pig.<br>
* Lung protease activity as a trigger of emphysema.<br>
* VEGFR inhibition model of emphysema.<br>
* Bronchial instillation with human neutrophil / pancreatic elastase in rodents.<br>
* MMP (matrix metalloprotease)-induced enphysema.<br>
* Inflammation-induced emphysema.<br>
Additionally, emphysema models may be generated through genetic means (e.g., mice carrying<br>
the TSK mutation), and emphysematous animals may be generated by known modifiers of<br>
susceptibility to emphysema such as, inter alia, lung injury, alveolar hypoplasia, hyperoxia,<br>
glucocorticoid treatment and nutrition.<br>
A. Evaluation of the influence of lack of RTP801 on disease development in mouse<br>
models of emphysema (using RTP801 knockout mice)<br>
(1) Cigarette smoking (CS) induced inflammation and apoptosis is initiated in 5 RTP801<br>
KO and 5 control wild type 4 months old male mice. The mice are subjected to intense<br>
CS (as described in Rangasamy et al., see above) for 7 days. KO and WT non-treated<br>
mice from the VEGFR inhibition experiment above can also serve as non-treated control<br>
groups for this experiment. The lungs are subsequently agarose-inflated, fixed and<br>
imbedded in paraffin, and development oxidative stress in the KO mice is assessed by:<br>
a) immunohistochemical localization and quantitation of 8-oxb-dG in the<br>
lung sections;<br>
b) immunohistochemical localization and quantitation of active caspase 3 in<br>
the lung sections using specific antibodies, or quantitative evaluation of<br>
the number of TUNEL-positive cells;<br>
c) measurement of ceramide concentration in the lung extracts;<br>
d) measurement of caspase activity in the lung extracts.<br>
 (2) Long-term cigarette smoking in the KO mice.<br>
6 KO and 6 age-matched WT female mice were subjected to intense cigarette smoking (5 hrs a<br>
day) during a period of 6 months. The mice were then sacrificed, and average interseptal<br>
diameter (a parameter of emphysema development) was evaluated using a morphometric<br>
approach.<br>
B. Evaluation of the influence of lack of RTP801 on disease progression in mouse<br>
models of emphysema by inhibiting endogenous RTP801 employing intralung delivery<br>
RTP801 -inactivating siRNA<br>
CS-induced inflammation was induced by 7 day smoking in 2 groups of C57BL6 mice, 10<br>
mice per group. Group 1: CS + delivery of control siRNA (REDDS) siRNA; Group 2: CS +<br>
RTP801 siRNA (REDD 14). Control groups of mice were instilled with either type of siRNA but<br>
kept in room air conditions. The animals were evaluated as in the above experiment with the<br>
Knock-Out mice.<br>
Methods<br>
Exposure to cigarette smoking (CS)<br>
Exposure is carried out (7 h/day, 7 days/week) by burning 2R4F reference cigarettes (2.45 mg<br>
nicotine per cigarette; purchased from the Tobacco Research Institute, University of Kentucky,<br>
Lexington, KY, USA) using a smoking machine (Model TE-10, Teague Enterprises, Davis, CA,<br>
USA). Each smoldering cigarette was puffed for 2 s, once every minute for a total of eight puffs,<br>
at a flow rate of 1.05 L/min, to provide a standard puff of 35 cm3. The smoke machine is<br>
adjusted to produce a mixture of sidestream smoke (89%) and mainstream smoke (11%) by<br>
burning five cigarettes at one time. Chamber atmosphere is monitored for total suspended<br>
particulates and carbon monoxide, with concentrations of 90 mg/m3 and 350 ppm, respectively.<br>
Morphologic and morphometric analyses<br>
After exposing the mice to CS or instillation of RTP801 expressing plasmid, the mice are<br>
anesthetized with halothane and the lungs are inflated with 0.5% low-melting agarose at a<br>
constant pressure of 25 cm as previously described6. The inflated lungs are fixed in 10%<br>
buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections (5 urn) are stained with hematoxylin and<br>
eosin. Mean alveolar diameter, alveolar length, and mean linear intercepts are determined by<br>
computer-assisted morphometry with the Image Pro Plus software (Media Cybernetics, Silver<br>
Spring, MD, USA). The lung sections in each group are coded and representative images (15 per<br>
lung section) are acquired by an investigator masked to the identity of the slides, with a Nikon<br>
E800 microscope, 20X lens.<br>
Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAD and phenotyping<br>
Following exposure to CS or instillation of RTP801 expressing plasmid, the mice are<br>
anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital. The BAL fluid collected from the lungs of the mice is<br>
centrifuged (500 'g at 4°C), and the cell pellet is resuspended in phosphate-buffered saline. The<br>
total number of cells in the lavage fluid is determined, and 2 x 104 cells are cytocentrifuged<br>
(Shandon Southern Products, Pittsburgh, PA, USA) onto glass slides and stained with Wright-<br>
Giemsa stain. Differential cell counts are performed on 300 cells, according to standard<br>
cytologic techniques .<br>
Identification of alveolar apoptotic cell populations in the lungs.<br>
To identify the different alveolar cell types undergoing apoptosis in the lungs, an<br>
immunohistochemical staining of active caspase 3 is performed in the lung sections from the<br>
room air (RA) as well as CS exposed mice. To identify the apoptotic type II epithelial cells in<br>
the lungs, after active caspase 3 labeling, the lung sections are incubated first with anti-mouse<br>
surfactant protein C (SpC) antibody and then with an anti-rabbit Texas red antibody. Apoptotic<br>
endothelial cells are identified by incubating the sections first with the anti-mouse CD 31<br>
antibody and then with the biotinylated rabbit anti-mouse secondary antibody. The lung sections<br>
are rinsed in PBS and then incubated with the streptavidin-Texas red conjugated complex. The<br>
apoptotic macrophages in the lungs are identified by incubating the sections first with the rat<br>
anti-mouse Mac-3 antibody and then with the anti-rat Texas red antibody. Finally, DAPI is<br>
applied to all lung sections, incubated for 5 minutes, washed and mounted with Vectashield<br>
HardSet mounting medium. DAPI and fluorescein are visualized at 330-380 nm and 465-495<br>
nm, respectively. Images of the lung sections are acquired with the Nikon E800 microscope,<br>
40X lens.<br>
Immunohistochcmical localization of active caspasc-3<br>
Immunohistochemical staining of active caspase-3 assay is performed using anti-active caspase-<br>
3 antibody and the active caspase-3-positive cells are counted with a macro, using Image Pro<br>
Plus program. The counts are normalized by the sum of the alveolar profiles herein named as<br>
alveolar length and expressed in urn. Alveolar length correlates inversely with mean linear<br>
intercept, i.e., as the alveolar septa are destroyed, mean linear intercepts increases as total<br>
alveolar length, i.e., total alveolar septal length decreases.<br>
Caspase 3 activity assay<br>
The caspase-3/7 activity is measured in lung tissue extracts using a fluorometric assay according<br>
to the manufacturer's instructions. Snap-frozen lung tissue (n = 3 per group) was homogenized<br>
with the assay buffer, followed by sonication and centrifugation at 800 x g. After removal of<br>
nuclei and cellular debris, the supernatant (300 u.g protein) is then incubated with the profluorescent<br>
substrate at room temperature for Ih and the fluorescence intensity was measured<br>
utilizing a Typhoon phosphoimager (Amersham Biosciences, Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA). The<br>
results are expressed as the rate of specific caspase-3 substrate cleavage, expressed in units of<br>
caspase 3 enzymatic activity, normalized by total protein concentration. Active recombinant<br>
caspase 3 was utilized as the assay standard (0-4 U). Tissue lysates without substrate, assay<br>
buffer alone, and lysates with caspase 3 inhibitor were utilized as negative controls.<br>
Immunohistochemical localization of 8-oxo-dG<br>
For the immunohistochemical localization and quantification of 8-oxo-dG, lung sections from<br>
the mice exposed to CS or instilled with RTP801 expressing plasmid are incubated with anti-8-<br>
oxo-dG antibody and stained using InnoGenexTM Iso-IHC DAB kit using mouse antibodies.<br>
The 8-oxo-dG-positive cells are counted with a macro (using Image Pro Plus), and the counts<br>
were normalized by alveolar length as described.<br>
Instillation of plasmid DNA into mouse lungs<br>
Plasmid DNA of RTP801 expressing and control vectors were prepared under endotoxin-free<br>
DNA isolation kit. For intra-tracheal instillation, 50 ug of plasmid DNA is delivered in 80 ul<br>
sterile perfluorocarbon. The oxygen carrying properties of perfluorocarbon make it well124<br>
tolerated at these volumes, while its physical-chemical properties allow for extremely efficient<br>
distal lung delivery when instilled intratracheally. Mice are anesthetized by brief inhalational<br>
halothane exposure, the tongue is gently pulled forward by forceps and the trachea instilled with<br>
perfluorocarbon solution applied at the base of the tongue via a blunt angiocatheter.<br>
Instillation of siRNA into mouse lungs.<br>
Mice are anesthetized with an intra-peritoneal injection of Ketamine/Xylazine (115/22 mg/kg).<br>
50ug of siRNA is instilled intranasally in 50ul volume of 0.9% NaCl by delivering five<br>
consecutive 10 uJ portions. At the end of the intranasal instillation, the mouse's head is held<br>
straight up for 1 minute to ensure that all the instilled solution drains inside.<br>

Results<br>
1, Instillation of an RTP801 expressing plasmid results in an emphysema-like phenotype in<br>
mouse lungs which is evident by (1) inctease in bronchoalveolar lavage cell counts (Fig.<br>

Models and results relating to microvascular disorders<br>
The compounds of the present invention were tested in animal models of a range of<br>
microvascular disorders as described below.<br>
1. Diabetic Retinopathy<br>
RTP801 promotes neuronal cell apoptosis and generation of reactive oxygen species in vitro.<br>
The inventor of the current invention also found that in RTP801 knockout (KO) mice<br>
subjected to the model of retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), pathologic neovascularization NV<br>
was reduced under hypoxic conditions, despite elevations in VEGF, whereas the lack of this<br>
gene did not influence physiologic neonatal retinal NV. Moreover, in this model, lack of<br>
RTP801 was also protective against hypoxic neuronal apoptosis and hyperoxic vasoobl<br>
iteration.<br>
Experiment 1<br>
Diabetes was induced in 8wk old RTP801 KO and C57/129sv wildtype (WT) littermate mice by<br>
intraperitoneal injection of STZ. After 4 weeks, ERG (single white flash, 1.4xlOA4 ftc, 5 ms)<br>
was obtained from the left eye after 1 hour of dark adaptation.. RVP was assessed from both<br>
eyes using the Evans-blue albumin permeation technique.<br>
Results<br>
Blood glucose was not different between diabetic (DM) WT and DM KO (495±109 vs 513±76<br>
mg/dl), nor nondiabetic (NDM) WT and KO (130±10 vs 135±31 mg/dl, respectively). RVP in<br>
the DM WT group was increased 138% (5\.2± 37.9 uL/g/hr, n=8) compared to NDM WT (21.5<br>
± 18.8 uL/g/hr, n=9, p=0.055). In contrast, RVP was reduced by 80% in DM KO (9.5 ± 8.5<br>
uL/g/hr, n-6, p=0.023) as compared to the DM WT mice, resulting in a 140% decrease of<br>
diabetes-induced RVP. In DM WT mice, there was a prolongation (p
potential implicit times for OP2 (11%), OP3 (12%), &amp; OP4 (14%) and for the B-wave (23%) as<br>
compared to NDM WT. A-wave was not significantly changed. These changes were<br>
normalized -100% in DM KO mice for OP3 &amp; OP4 and 65% for B-wave as compared to NDM<br>
KO. Conclusion; Knock out of RTP801 ameliorates diabetes-induced RVP and ERG<br>
abnormalities in mice, suggesting that this hypoxia inducible gene may serve an important role<br>
in the pathogenesis of early diabetic retinal disease.<br>
Experiment 2<br>
Diabetes was induced in RTP801 knockout and in control wild type mice with the matched<br>
genetic background. In addition, it was induced in C57B16 mice, which were subsequently used<br>
for intravitreal injection of anti-RTP801 and control siRNAs. For diabetes induction, the mice<br>
were injected with streptozotocin (STZ 90 mg/kg/d for 2 days after overnight fast). Animal<br>
physiology was monitored throughout the study for changes in blood glucose, body weight, and<br>
hematocrit. Vehicle-injected mice served as controls. The appropriate animals were treated by<br>
intravitreal injections of lug of REDD 14 anti-RTP801 siRNA or lug of anti-GFP control<br>
siRNA. siRNA was injected twice in the course of the study - on day 0, when the first STZ<br>
injection was performed, and on day 14 after the STZ injection.<br>
Retinal vascular leakage was measured using the Evans-blue (EB) dye technique on the animals<br>
after 4 weeks duration of diabetes. Mice had a catheter implanted into the right jugular vein 24<br>
hours prior to Evans Blue (EB) measurements. Retinal permeability measurements in both eyes<br>
of each animal followed a standard Evans-blue protocol.<br>
Results<br>
1. Retinal blood vessel leakage was reduced by 70% in RTP801 KO diabetic mice<br>
compared with wild type diabetic mice (see Figure 20).<br>
2. The Knock out of RTP801 normalizes ERG abnormalities in mice: In DM WT mice,<br>
there was a prolongation (p
(11%), OP3 (12%), &amp; OP4 (14%) and for the B-wave (23%) as compared to NDM WT.<br>
A-wave was not significantly changed. These changes were normalized ~100% in DM<br>
RTP801 KO mice for OP3 &amp; OP4 and 65% for B-wave as compared to NDM RTP801<br>
KO (see Figure 21).<br>
3. Similarly to the results in KO mice, retinal blood vessel leakage was reduced by 50% in<br>
diabetic mice injected intravitreally with REDD 14 siRNA against RTP801 compared to<br>
diabetic mice intraviterally injected with control siRNA against GFP (see Figure 22).<br>
2. Retinopathy of prematurity<br>
Retinopathy of prematurity was induced by exposing the test animals to hypoxic and hyperoxic<br>
conditions, and subsequently testing the effects on the retina. Results showed that RTP801 KO<br>
mice were protected from retinopathy of prematurity, thereby validating the protective effect of<br>
RTP801 inhibition.<br>
3. Myocardial infarction<br>
Myocardial infarction was induced by Left Anterior Descending artery ligation in mice, both<br>
short term and long term. Results: reduction of TnT and CPK-MB fraction levels at 24 hrs<br>
postinfarct in the blood and better echocardiogram (ejection fraction volume) at 28 days<br>
postinfarct in RTP801 KO mice.<br>
4. Microvascular Ischemic conditions<br>
Animal models for assessing ischemic conditions include:<br>
1. Closed Head Injury (CHI) - Experimental TBI produces a series of events<br>
contributing to neurological and neurometabolic cascades, which are related to the<br>
degree and extent of behavioral deficits. CHI is induced under anesthesia, while a<br>
weight is allowed to free-fall from a prefixed height (Chen et al, J. Neurotrauma 13,<br>
557, 1996) over the exposed skull covering the left hemisphere in the midcoronal<br>
plane.<br>
2. Transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) - a 90 to 120 minutes transient<br>
focal ischemia is performed in adult, male Sprague Dawley rats, 300-370 gr. The<br>
method employed is the intraluminal suture MCAO (Longa et al., Stroke, 30, 84,<br>
1989, and Dogan et al., J. Neurochem. 72, 765, 1999). Briefly, under halothane<br>
anesthesia, a 3-0-nylon suture material coated with Poly-L-Lysine is inserted into the<br>
right internal carotid artery (ICA) through a hole in the external carotid artery. The<br>
nylon thread is pushed into the ICA to the right MCA origin (20-23 mm). 90-120<br>
minutes later the thread is pulled off, the animal is closed and allowed to recover.<br>
3. Permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) - occlusion is permanent,<br>
unilateral-induced by electrocoagulation of MCA. Both methods lead to focal brain ischemia<br>
of the ipsilateral side of the brain cortex leaving the contralateral side intact (control). The<br>
left MCA is exposed via a temporal craniectomy, as described for rats by Tamura A.et al., J<br>
Cereb Blood Flow Metab. 1981;1:53-60. The MCA and its lenticulostriatal branch are<br>
occluded proximally to the medial border of the olfactory tract with microbipolar<br>
coagulation. The wound is sutured, and animals returned to their home cage in a room<br>
warmed at 26°C to 28°C. The temperature of the animals is maintained all the time with an<br>
automatic thermostat.<br>
5. Acute Renal Failure (ARF)<br>
Testing active siRNA for treating ARF may be done using sepsis-induced ARF or ischemiareperfusion-<br>
induced ARF.<br>
1. Sepsis induced ARF<br>
Two predictive animal models of sepsis-induced ARF are described by Miyaji T, Hu X, Yuen<br>
PS, Muramatsu Y, Iyer S, Hewitt SM, Star RA, 2003, Ethyl pyruvate decreases sepsis-induced<br>
acute renal failure and multiple organ damage in aged mice, Kidney Int. Nov;64(5): 1620-31.<br>
These two models are lipopolysaccharide administration and cecal ligation puncture in mice,<br>
preferably in aged mice.<br>
2. Ischemia-reperfusion-induced ARF<br>
This predictive animal model is described by Kelly KJ, Plotkin Z, Vulgamott SL, Dagher PC,<br>
2003 January,. P53 mediates the apoptotic response to GTP depletion after renal ischemiareperfusion:<br>
protective role of a p53 inhibitor, J Am Soc Nephrol.; 14(1): 128-38.<br>
Ischemia-reperfusion injury was induced in rats following 45 minutes bilateral kidney arterial<br>
clamp and subsequent release of the clamp to allow 24 hours of reperfusion. 250 ug of REDD 14<br>
or GFP siRNA (negative control) were injected into the jugular vein 2 hrs prior to and 30<br>
minutes following the clamp. Additional 250ug of siRNA were given via the tail vein at 4 and 8<br>
hrs after the clamp. siRNA against GFP served as a negative control. ARF progression was<br>
monitored by measurement of serum creatinine levels before and 24 hrs post surgery. At the end<br>
of the experiment, the rats were perfused via an indwelling femoral line with warm PBS<br>
followed by 4% paraformaldehyde. The left kidneys were removed and stored in 4%<br>
paraformaldehyde for subsequent histological analysis. Acute renal failure is frequently defined<br>
as an acute increase of the serum creatinine level from baseline. An increase of at least 0.5 mg<br>
per dL or 44.2 umol per L of serum creatinine is considered as an indication for acute renal<br>
failure. Serum creatinine was measured at time zero before the surgery and at 24 hours post<br>
ARF surgery.<br>
To study the distribution of siRNA in the rat kidney, Cy3-labeled 19-mer blunt-ended siRNA<br>
molecules (2 mg/kg) having alternating O-methyl modification in the sugar residues were<br>
administered iv for 3-5 min, after which in vivo imaging was conducted using two-photon<br>
confocal microscopy. The confocal microscopy analysis revealed that the majority of siRNA in<br>
the kidneys is concentrated in the endosomal compartment of proximal tubular cells. Both<br>
endosomal and cytoplasmic siRNA fluorescence were relatively stable during the first 2 hrs post<br>
delivery and disappeared at 24 hrs.<br>
As evident from Figure 19, there was a ten-fold increase in the level of serum creatinine<br>
following a 45-min of kidney bilateral arterial clamp treatment (PBS treatment). Four injections<br>
of 801 siRNA (REDD 14, SEQ In No.s 16 and 66) (2 hrs prior to the clamp and 30min, 4h and<br>
8h after the clamp) significantly reduced the creatinine level in serum by 40% (P 
results suggest that 801 siRNA can protect renal tissue from the effects of ischemia-reperfusion<br>
injury and thus reduce the severity of ARF.<br>
Example 9<br>
Preparation of siRNAs<br>
Using proprietary algorithms and the known sequence of gene RTP801 (SEQ ID NO:1), the<br>
sequences of many potential siRNAs were generated. siRNA molecules according to the above<br>
specifications were prepared essentially as described herein.<br>
The siRNAs of the present invention can be synthesized by any of the methods which are wellknown<br>
in the art for synthesis of ribonucleic (or deoxyribonucleic) oligonucleotides. For<br>
example, a commercially available machine (available, inter alia, from Applied Biosystems) can<br>
be used; the oligonucleotides are prepared according to the sequences disclosed herein.<br>
Overlapping pairs of chemically synthesized fragments can be ligated using methods well known<br>
in the art (e.g., see U.S. Patent No. 6,121,426). The strands are synthesized separately and then are<br>
annealed to each other in the tube. Then, the double-stranded siRNAs are separated from the<br>
single-stranded oligonucleotides that were not annealed (e.g. because of the excess of one of them)<br>
by HPLC. In relation to the siRNAs or siRNA fragments of the present invention, two or more such<br>
sequences can be synthesized and linked together for use in the present invention.<br>
The siRNA molecules of the invention may be synthesized by procedures known in the art e.g.<br>
the procedures as described in Usman et al., 1987, J. Am. Chem. Soc., 109, 7845; Scaringe et al.,<br>
1990, Nucleic Acids Res., 18, 5433; Wincott et al., 1995, Nucleic Acids Res. 23, 2677-2684;<br>
and Wincott et al., 1997, Methods Mol. Bio., 74, 59, and may make use of common nucleic<br>
acid protecting and coupling groups, such as dimethoxytrityl at the 5'-end, and<br>
phosphoramidites at the 3'-end. The modified (e.g. 2'-0-methylated) nucleotides and<br>
unmodified nucleotides are incorporated as desired.<br>
Alternatively, the nucleic acid molecules of the present invention can be synthesized separately<br>
and joined together post-synthetically, for example, by ligation (Moore et al., 1992, Science 256,<br>
9923; Draper et al., International PCT publication No. W093/23569; Shabarova et al., 1991,<br>
Nucleic Acids Research 19, 4247; Bellon et al., 1997, Nucleosides &amp; Nucleotides, 16, 951;<br>
Bellon et al., 1997, Bioconjugale Chem. 8, 204), or by hybridization following synthesis and/or<br>
deprotection.<br>
The siRNA molecules of the invention can also be synthesized via a tandem synthesis<br>
methodology, as described in US patent application publication No. US2004/0019001<br>
(McSwiggen) wherein both siRNA strands are synthesized as a single contiguous<br>
oligonucleotide fragment or strand separated by a cleavable linker which is subsequently<br>
cleaved to provide separate siRNA fragments or strands that hybridize and permit purification of<br>
the siRNA duplex. The linker can be a polynucleotide linker or a non-nucleotide linker.<br>
For further information, see PCT publication No. WO 2004/015107 (ATUGEN).<br>
As described above, the siRNAs of Table A (below) were constructed such that alternate sugars<br>
have 2'-O-methyl modification i.e. alternate nucleotides were thus modified. In these preferred<br>
embodiments, in one strand of the siRNA the modified nucleotides were numbers<br>
1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15,17 and 19 and in the opposite strand the modified nucleotides were numbers<br>
2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16 and 18. Thus these siRNAs are blunt-ended 19-mer RNA molecules with<br>
alternate 2-0'-methyl modifications as described above. The siRNAs of Tables 2 and 3 (below)<br>
are also constructed in this manner; the siRNAs of Table B are blunt-ended 19-mer RNA<br>
molecules with alternate 2-0'-methyl modifications; the siRNAs of Table C are blunt-ended 21-<br>
mer RNA molecules with alternate 2-0'-methyl modifications.<br>
Table A details various novel siRNA molecules which were generated and subsequently<br>
synthesized for gene RTP801. The two final columns indicate the results of two experiments<br>
performed to examine the activity of the novel molecules. Briefly, HeLa or Hacat cells were<br>
transfected with a specific novel siRNA to be tested. Expression of the RTP801 polypeptide<br>
was then determined by western blotting using an antibody against the RTP801 polypeptide.<br>
Referring to the two right-hand columns of Table A, "-" signifies an inactive or low-activity<br>
molecule (which does not substantially inhibit the expression of the RTP801 gene); "+" signifies<br>
an siRNA molecule with some inhibitory activity (of RTP801 gene expression), "+4-" signifies a<br>
molecule with higher inhibitory activity, and so on. Any one of the the siRNA molecules<br>
disclosed herein, and in particular the active molecules detailed in Table A are novel and also<br>
considered a part of the present invention.<br>

Pharmacology and drue delivery<br>
The nucleotide sequences of the present invention can be delivered either directly or with viral<br>
or non-viral vectors. When delivered directly the sequences are generally rendered nuclease<br>
resistant. Alternatively the sequences can be incorporated into expression cassettes or constructs<br>
such that the sequence is expressed in the cell as discussed herein below. Generally the construct<br>
contains the proper regulatory sequence or promoter to allow the sequence to be expressed in<br>
the targeted cell.<br>
The compounds or pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention are administered and<br>
dosed in accordance with good medical practice, taking into account the clinical condition of the<br>
individual patient, the disease to be treated, the site and method of administration, scheduling of<br>
administration, patient age, sex, body weight and other factors known to medical practitioners.<br>
The pharmaceutically "effective amount" for purposes herein is thus determined by such<br>
considerations as are known in the art. The amount must be effective to achieve improvement<br>
including but not limited to improved survival rate or more rapid recovery, or improvement or<br>
elimination of symptoms and other indicators as are selected as appropriate measures by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
The treatment generally has a length proportional to the length of the disease process and drug<br>
effectiveness and the patient species being treated. It is noted that humans are treated generally<br>
longer than the mice or other experimental animals exemplified herein.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be administered by any of the conventional routes<br>
of administration. It should be noted that the compound can be administered as the compound or<br>
as pharmaceutically acceptable salt and can be administered alone or as an active ingredient in<br><br>
combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, solvents, diluents, excipients, adjuvants<br>
and vehicles. The compounds can be administered orally, subcutaneously or parenterally<br>
including intravenous, intraarterial, intramuscular, intraperitoneally, and intranasal<br>
administration as well as intrathecal and infusion techniques. Implants of the compounds are<br>
also useful. Liquid forms may be prepared for injection, the term including subcutaneous,<br>
transdermal, intravenous, intramuscular, intrathecal, and other parental routes of administration.<br>
The liquid compositions include aqueous solutions, with and without organic cosolvents,<br>
aqueous or oil suspensions, emulsions with edible oils, as well as similar pharmaceutical<br>
vehicles. In addition, under certain circumstances the compositions for use in the novel<br>
treatments of the present invention may be formed as aerosols, for intranasal and like<br>
administration. The patient being treated is a warm-blooded animal and, in particular, mammals<br>
including man. The pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, solvents, diluents, excipients,<br>
adjuvants and vehicles as well as implant carriers generally refer to inert, non-toxic solid or<br>
liquid fillers, diluents or encapsulating material not reacting with the active ingredients of the<br>
invention.<br>
When administering the compound of the present invention parenterally, it is generally<br>
formulated in a unit dosage injectable form (solution, suspension, emulsion). The<br>
pharmaceutical formulations suitable for injection include sterile aqueous solutions or<br>
dispersions and sterile powders for reconstitution into sterile injectable solutions or dispersions.<br>
The carrier can be a solvent or dispersing medium containing, for example, water, ethanol,<br>
polyol (for example, glycerol, propylene glycol, liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like),<br>
suitable mixtures thereof, and vegetable oils.<br>
Proper fluidity can be maintained, for example, by the use of a coating such as lecithin, by the<br>
maintenance of the required particle size in the case of dispersion and by the use of surfactants.<br>
Nonaqueous vehicles such a cottonseed oil, sesame oil, olive oil, soybean oil, com oil,<br>
sunflower oil, or peanut oil and esters, such as isopropyl myristate, can also be used as solvent<br>
systems for compound compositions. Additionally, various additives which enhance the<br>
stability, sterility, and isotonicity of the compositions, including antimicrobial preservatives,<br>
antioxidants, chelating agents, and buffers, can be added. Prevention of the action of<br>
microorganisms can be ensured by various antibacterial and antifungal agents, for example,<br>
parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, and the like. In many cases, it is desirable to<br>
include isotonic agents, for example, sugars, sodium chloride, and the like. Prolonged<br>
absorption of the injectable pharmaceutical form can be brought about by the use of agents<br>
delaying absorption, for example, aluminum monostearate and gelatin. According to the present<br>
invention, however, any vehicle, diluent, or additive used have to be compatible with the<br>
compounds.<br>
Sterile injectable solutions can be prepared by incorporating the compounds utilized in<br>
practicing the present invention in the required amount of the appropriate solvent with various<br>
of the other ingredients, as desired.<br>
A pharmacological formulation of the present invention can be administered to the patient in an<br>
injectable formulation containing any compatible carrier, such as various vehicle, adjuvants,<br>
additives, and diluents; or the compounds utilized in the present invention can be administered<br>
parenterally to the patient in the form of slow-release subcutaneous implants or targeted delivery<br>
systems such as monoclonal antibodies, vectored delivery, iontophoretic, polymer matrices,<br>
liposomes, and microspheres. Examples of delivery systems useful in the present invention<br>
include U. S. Patent Nos. 5,225,182; 5,169,383; 5,167,616; 4,959,217; 4,925,678; 4,487,603;<br>
4,486,194; 4,447,233; 4,447,224; 4,439,196; and 4,475,196. Many other such implants, delivery<br>
systems, and modules are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
A pharmacological formulation of the compound utilized in the present invention can be<br>
administered orally to the patient. Conventional methods such as administering the compound in<br>
tablets, suspensions, solutions, emulsions, capsules, powders, syrups and the like are usable.<br>
Known techniques which deliver it orally or intravenously and retain the biological activity are<br>
preferred. In one embodiment, the compound of the present invention can be administered<br>
initially by intravenous injection to bring blood levels to a suitable level. The patient's levels are<br>
then maintained by an oral dosage form, although other forms of administration, dependent<br>
upon the patient's condition and as indicated above, can be used.<br>
