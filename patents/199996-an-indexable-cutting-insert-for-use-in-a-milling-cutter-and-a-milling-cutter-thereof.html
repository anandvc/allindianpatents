DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Attention is first drawn to Figs.  1  to 3.    The cutting insert 10 in<br><br>
WO(l3/('(M2(lfl	PCT/IH2/0..46J<br>
-6-<br>
accordance with the present invention has generally square shaped top 12 and bottom 14 surfaces. The cutting insert can be manufactured by pressing and sintering or by injection molding. Four substantially identical side surfaces 16 extend between the top surface 12 and the bottom surface 14. The side surfaces 16 5 are designed to be identical, however, as a result of the manufacturing process one or more of the side surfaces may be slightly different from the required design. For example, it is known that during sintering the cutting insert shrinks and that the shrinkage may be non-uniform. Therefore, substantially identical means herein, as identical as can be achieved taking into consideration manufacturing tolerances.<br>
10 Each side surface 16 comprises a major side surface 18 connected to an adjacent minor side surface 20. Adjacent major side surfaces 18 merge at two diametrically opposite comer edges 22.<br>
Adjacent minor side surfaces 20 merge at an intermediate side surface 24. The two adjacent minor side surfaces 20 and the intermediate side surface 24<br>
15 form Hie peripheral side surface 26 of a protuberance 28 protruding outwardly from the cutting insert 10. There are two diametrically opposite protuberances 28 that extend away from each other, in a top or bottom view of the cutting insert 10, as can be seen in Fig. 2.<br>
The intersection of each major side surface 18 with the top 12 or bottom<br>
20 14 surface defines a major cutting edge 30. There are eight substantially identical major cutting edges 30. The intersection of each minor side surface 20 with the top 12 or bottom 14 surface defines a minor cutting edge 32. There are eight substantially identical minor cutting edges 32. Each minor cutting edge 32 is connected to an adjacent major cutting edge 30.   In accordance with a preferred<br>
25 embodiment of the present invention, the minor cutting edges 32 are shorter than the major cutting edges 30 and form therewith an obtuse angle a in a top or bottom view of the cutting insert 10, as can be seen in Fig. 2.<br>
For each side surface 16 a height dimension H is defined as the vertical height of the side surface in a side view of the cutting insert (see Fig. 3). In other<br><br>
WO<ij pct></ij>
-7-<br>
words, the height dimension H is the distance between a first point Pi on the major cutting edge 30 associated with the bottom surface 14 and a vertically opposite second point P2 on the major cutting edge 30 associated with the top surface 12. In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, each side surface 5 16 has a varying height dimension H. Preferably, the height dimension H has a minimum value Hroin in a central region 34 of the side surface 16. Further preferably, the height dimension H decreases monotonically from a maximum value Hmax at an outer region 36 of the side surface 16 to the minimum value Hmin at the central region 34.<br>
10	With reference to Fig. 3, two planes are defined. A median plane M<br>
located midway between the top and bottom surfaces 12, 14 and a reference plane N parallel to the median plane M and passing through the outer extremities 38 of the minor cutting edges 32 associated with the top surface 12. A similar reference plane associated with the bottom surface 14 could also be defined, however, it is<br>
15 redundant since the cutting insert 10 has mirror symmetry with respect to the median plane M.<br>
For a given side surface 16 the major and minor cutting edges 30, 32 associated with the given side surface have a varying slope that is directly related to the varying height dimension.  The minor cutting edge 32 extends from its outer<br>
20 extremity 38 to a point 40 where it merges with the major cutting edge 30 whilst sloping away from the reference plane N and towards the median plane M. The major cutting edge 30 comprises two sections, a first section 30i extends from the point 40, where it merges with the minor cutting edge 32, towards the central region 34 of the side surface 16 whilst sloping away from the reference plane N<br>
25 and towards the median plane M, a second section 30j extends from the central region 34 of the side surface 16 whilst sloping towards the reference plane N and away from the median plane M. Reference is also made to Figs. 4 and 5 showing a chip groove 42 provided in the top and bottom surfaces 12,14. The chip groove 42 is adjacent to and extends longitudinally along the major and minor cutting edges<br><br>

30, 32.<br>
The top surface 12 is provided with a top abutment surface 44 generally centrally located with respect to the major cutting edges 30 and the bottom surface 14 is provided with a bottom abutment surface 46 generally centrally located with 5 respect to the major cutting edges 30 and generally facing away from the top abutment surface 44. In accordance with a preferred embodiment, the top and bottom abutment surfaces 44, 46 are flat and parallel to each other. The distance between the top and bottom abutment surfaces 44, 46 is at least equal to the maximum value Hmax of the height dimension H of the side surfaces. The cutting<br>
10 insert 10 is provided with a land 48 extending from the major and minor cutting edges 30,32 towards the chip groove 42.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Figs. 6 to 8, showing a milling cutter 50, comprising a tool body 52 having the general form of a circular disk and a plurality of identical cutting inserts 10, in accordance with the present invention, releasably<br>
15 mounted in insert pockets 54. In Fig. 6 only three cutting inserts 10 are shown and the same three cutting inserts are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The tool body 52 has two oppositely facing generally circular side faces 56 connected by a peripheral mounting face 58. An axis of rotation A passes through the side faces 56 and defines a direction of rotation R of the milling cutter 50.<br>
20	The insert pockets 54 are spaced angularly around the peripheral<br>
mounting face 58 and the cutting inserts 10 are arranged in a staggered formation in pairs with one of the top or bottom abutment surfaces 44, 46 of each cutting insert 10 facing in the direction of rotation R. A first cutting insert 10' of a given pair of cutting inserts has a radially and axially outermost first protuberance 28* protruding<br>
25 axially at least partially from a first side face 56' of the tool body 52. A second cutting insert 10" of the given pair of cutting inserts has a radially and axially outermost second protuberance 28" protruding axially at least partially from a second side face 56" of the tool body 52. Generally, the first and second protuberances 28', 28" protrude radially at least partially from the peripheral<br><br>

mountingface5S.<br>
Attention is now drawn to Fig. 9 showing how the two cutting inserts 10', 10" of the milling cutter 50 produce a required profile 60, 60', 60" in a workpiece 62. The workpiece being the cam of a camshaft. In the figure the two 5 cutting inserts 10\ 10" mutually superimposed with the first cutting insert 10', represented by a solid line, being in front of the second cutting insert 10", which is represented by a dashed line. The required profile in the workpiece comprises a central straight section 60 (the flank of the cam) and two beveled sections 60*, 60" (the chamfered edges of the flank) on either side of the central straight section 60.<br>
10 The first beveled section 60' is formed by the first minor cutting edge 32* associated with the first protuberance 28' of the first cutting insert 10\ whereas the second beveled section 60" is formed by the second minor cutting edge 32" associated with the second protuberance 28" of the second cutting insert 10". The central straight section 60 is formed by both the first major cutting edge 30' of the<br>
15 first insert 10' and the second major cutting edge 30" of the second insert 10", which, as can be seen overlap. Since, the first major cutting edge 30' of the first insert 10' and the second major cutting edge 30" of the second insert 10" overlap, they are located at the same radial distance from the axis of rotation.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8 it can be seen that the fact that the major cutting edge<br>
20 30 (30', 30") slopes as described above, introduces an inherent axial rake thereby avoiding the necessity of positioning the top surface 12 of the cutting insert 10 at an angle to the axis of rotation A. Consequently, the angular pitch between adjacent cutting inserts can be reduced giving rise to the well-known advantages of close pitch milling cutters.   It will be apparent that a further advantage of the cutting<br>
25 insert in accordance with the teachings of the present invention is the possibility of using the same cutting inserts in milling cutters of different widths. Therefore, by adjusting the axial overlap of the cutting inserts, the length of the central straight section 60 in the workpiece can be altered. Yet a further advantage of the present invention is that the milling cutter uses a single type of cutting insert that can be<br><br>
WO 03/004206	PCT/IL02/00463<br>
-10-<br>
indexed eight times and that can be used as either a right-hand or left-hand cutting insert when mounted on the milling cutter.<br>
As can be seen in Figs. 7 and 8, the cutting insert 10 is retained in the insert pocket 54 by means of a wedge 64, which abuts the top abutment surface 44 5 of the insert 10. The wedge 64 being secured to the tool body 52 of the milling cutter 50 by a screw 66. The insert 10 is wedged between the wedge 64 and a support surface 68 of the insert pocket 54. The support surface 68 faces the direction of rotation R. As can be seen, the bottom surface 14 of the insert 10 abuts the support surface 68 in the region of protrusion 28 and the corner edge 22,<br>
10 thereby supporting the insert 10 against cutting forces when the milling cutter 50 is in operation. As can be seen in Fig. 3, this arrangement is made possible by the fact that both the corner edges 22 and the protrusions have the same height Hmsx, and also by the feet that the corner edges 22 are cylindrical in shape, giving them a larger surface area than would be obtained by a corner edge that would be formed<br>
15     merely by the intersection of adjacent major side surfaces 18.<br>
Although the present invention has been described to a certain degree of particularity, it will be appreciated that various modifications can be made without departing from the spirit or scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.<br><br>
