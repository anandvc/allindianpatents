3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION This invention is generally related to thermally insulating structures, and more particularly to a high thermal efficiency, insulated glass unit structure sealed with a room  temperature-cured  composition  exhibiting  low  permeability  to   gas,  or mixtures of gases.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Room temperature-curable (RTC) compositions are well known for their use as sealants. In the manufacture of Insulating Glass Units (IGU) panels of glass are placed parallel to each other and sealed at their periphery such that the space between the panels, or the inner space, is completely enclosed. The inner space is typically filled with air. The transfer of energy through an insulating glass unit of this typical construction is reduced, due to the inclusion of the insulating layer of air in the inner space, as compared to a single panel of glass. The energy transfer may be further reduced by increasing the separation between the panels to increase the insulating blanket of air. There is a limit to the maximum separation beyond which convection within the air between the panels can increase energy transfer. The energy transfer may be further reduced by adding more layers of insulation in the form of additional inner spaces and enclosing glass panels. For example three parallel spaced apart panels of glass separated by two inner spaces and sealed at their periphery. In this manner the separation of the panels is kept below the maximum limit imposed by convection effects in the airspace, yet the overall energy transfer can be further reduced. If further reduction in energy transfer is desired then additional inner spaces can be added.<br>
Additionally, the energy transfer of sealed insulating glass units may be reduced by substituting the air in a sealed insulated glass window for a denser, lower conductivity gas. Suitable gases should be colorless, non-toxic, non-corrosive, nonflammable, unaffected by exposure to ultraviolet radiation, and denser than air, and of lower conductivity than air. Argon, krypton, xenon, and sulfur hexaflouride<br>
2<br><br>
are examples of gases which are commonly substituted for air in insulating glass windows to reduce energy transfer.<br>
Various types of sealants are currently used in the manufacture of insulated glass units including both curing and non-curing systems. Liquid polysulphides, polyurethanes and silicones represent curing systems, which are commonly used, while polybutylene-polyisoprene copolymer rubber based hot melt sealants are commonly used non-curing systems.<br>
Liquid polysulphides and polyurethanes are generally two component systems comprising a base and a curing agent that are then mixed just prior to application to the glass. Silicones may be one component as well as two component systems. Two component systems require a set mix ratio, two-part mixing equipment and cure time before the insulating glass units can be moved onto the next manufacturing stage.<br>
However, current RTC silicone sealant compositions, while effective to some extent, still have only a limited ability, to prevent the loss of low thermal conductivity gas, e.g., argon, from the inner space of an IGU. As a result of this permeability, the reduced energy transfer maintained by the gas between the panels of glass is lost over time.<br>
A need therefore exists for an IGU with a RTC composition of reduced gas permeability compared to that of known RTC compositions. When employed as the sealant for an IGU, an RTC composition of reduced gas permeability will retain the intra- panel insulating gas of an IGU for a longer period of time compared to that of a more permeable RTC composition and will therefore extend the insulating properties of the IGU over a longer period of time.<br>

SUMMARY QF THE INVENTION The present invention relates to an insulated glass unit with increased thermal insulation stability. Specifically, the present invention relates to an insulated glass unit which comprises at least two spaced-apart sheets (panes) of glass, or of other functionally equivalent material, in spaced relationship to each other, a low thermal conductivity gas therebetween and a gas sealant assembly including a cured, i.e., crosslinked or vulcanized, curable sealant composition comprising:<br>
a)	at least one silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane;<br>
b)	at      least      one      crosslinker      for      the      silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane(s);<br>
c)	at least one catalyst For the crosslinking reaction;<br>
d)	at least one organic nanoclay, and, optionally,<br>
e)	at least one solid polymer having a permeability to gas that is less than the permeability of the crosslinked diorganopolysiloxane(s).<br>
When used as a component of the gas sealant assembly of an IGU, the foregoing cured sealant composition reduces the loss of gas(es) from the IGU thus extending its useful service life.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with the present invention, an insulated glass unit comprising increased thermal insulation stability is provided with at least two spaced- apart sheets of glass in spaced relationship to each other, a low thermal conductivity insulating gas or mixture of gases therebetween and a gas sealant element including a cured sealant composition resulting from the curing of a curable sealant composition comprising: a) at least one silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane; b) at least one crosslinker for the silanol-terminated diorganopolysiloxane(s); c) at least one catalyst for the crosslinking reaction; d) at least one organic nanoclay filler; and, optionally, e) at least one solid polymer having a permeability to gas that is less than the permeability of the crosslinked diorganopolysiloxane(s).<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, insulated glass unit 10 of known and conventional construction includes glass sheets 1 and 2 maintained in spaced-apart relationship by a gas sealant assembly possessing a primary gas sealant member 4, continuous spacer member 5 and low gas permeable sealant composition 7 prepared as hereinafter described, space 6 between sheets 1 and 2 being filled with an insulating gas or gases such as argon. A glazing bead 8, as known in the art, is placed between glass sheets 1 and 2 and window frame 9. Panes 1 and 2 can be fabricated from any of a variety of materials such as glass, e.g., clear float glass, annealed glass, tempered glass, solar glass, tinted glass, e.g., low energy glass, etc., acrylic resin and polycarbonate resin, and the like.<br>
The inclusion of cured sealant composition 7 in the foregoing gas sealant assembly provides improved gas barrier characteristics and moisture leakage characteristics relative to known and conventional gas sealants.

The curable sealant composition herein includes at least one organic nanoclay filler (d). Nanoclays possess a unique morphology with one dimension being in the nanometer range. The nanoclays can form chemical complexes with an intercalant that ionicaliy bonds to surfaces in between' the layers making up the clay particles. This association of intercalant and clay particles results in a material which is compatible with many different kinds of host resins permitting the clay filler to disperse therein.<br>
The term "exfoliation" as used herein describes a process wherein packets of nanoclay platelets separate from one another in a polymer matrix. During exfoliation, platelets at the outermost region of each packet cleave off, exposing more platelets for separation.<br>
The term "gallery" as used herein describes the space between parallel layers of clay platelets. The gallery spacing changes depending on the nature of the molecule or polymer occupying the space. An interlayer space between individual nanoclay platelets varies, again depending on the type of molecules that occupy the space.<br>

The argon permeability of the foregoing cured composition was measured using a gas permeability set-up. The measurements were based on the variable-volume method at 100 psi pressure and at a temperature of 25°C. The permeability measurements were repeated under identical conditions 2-3 times in order to assure their reproducibility.<br>
The permeability data are graphically presented in Figures 1 and 2.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 2 AND EXAMPLES 5-9<br>
To provide a 1 weight percent C-15A clay (see Example 5, Table 3): 227.7 g of OMCTS (octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane) and 2.3 g of C-15A were introduced into a three-neck round bottom flask fitted with overhead stirrer and condenser. The mixture was stirred at 250 rpm for 6 hours at ambient temperature. The temperature was increased to 175°C while stirring was continued. 0.3 g of CsOH in   1ml of water was added to the reaction vessel through a septum. After 15<br>
16<br><br>
minutes, polymerization of OMCTS began and 0.5 ml of water was then added with an additional 0.5 ml of water being added after 5 minutes. Heating and stirring were continued for 1 hour after which 0.1 ml of phosphoric acid was added for neutralization. The pH of the reaction mixture was determined after 30 minutes. Stirring and heating were continued for another 30 minutes and the pH of the reaction mixture was again determined to assure complete neutralization. Distillation of cyclics was carried out at 175°C and the mixture was thereafter cooled to room temperature.<br>
The same procedure was followed with 2.5, 5 and 10 wt% of C-15A (see Examples 6-8, Table 3).<br>
Similar in-situ polymerization procedures were followed with 10 wt% high aspect ratio clay (SF ME100) (see Example 9, Table 3). The in-situ polymer with different amounts of clay were then used to make cured sheets as follows: In-situ PDMS-nanoclay formulations were mixed with NPS crosslinker and solubilized DBTO catalyst using a hand blender for 5-7 min with air bubbles being removed by. vacuum. The mixture was then poured into a Teflon sheet-forming mold and maintained for 24 hours under ambient conditions (25°C and 50% humidity). The partially cured sheets were removed from the mold after 24 hours and maintained at ambient temperature for seven days for complete curing.<br>

Argon permeability was measured using a gas permeability set-up as in the previous examples. The measurements were based on the variable-volume method at 100 psi pressure and at a temperature of 25°C, Measurements were repeated under identical conditions 2-3 times in order to assure their reproducibility.<br>
The permeability data are graphically presented in Figures 1 and 2. As shown in the data, argon permeability in the case of the cured sealant compositions of the invention (Examples 1-3 and 5-8 of Figure 1 and Examples 4 and 9 of Figure 2) was significantly less than that of cured sealant compositions outside the scope of the invention (Comparative Examples 1 and 2 of Figures 1 and 2). In all, while the argon permeability coefficients of the sealant compositions of Comparative Examples 1 and 2 exceed 900 barrers, those of Examples 1-9 illustrative of sealant compositions of this invention did not exceed 900 barrers and in some cases, were well below this level of argon permeability coefficient (see, in particular, examples 3,8 and 9).<br>
While the preferred embodiment of the present invention has been illustrated and described in detail, various modifications of, for example, components, materials and parameters, will become apparent to those skilled in the art, and it is intended to cover in the appended claims all such modifications and changes which come within the scope of this invention.<br>
