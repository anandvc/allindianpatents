Description of the Preferred Embodiment<br>
Referring to Fig, 1 which is a schematic view of the succession of steps A-F to produce a filled container, the first step A comprises making a hollow plastic container by a method and apparatus wherein the neck or finish of the container is first injection molded, then a tube is extruded integrally with the injection molded finish, molds are closed about the tube and the tube is down to form a container. Such a method and apparatus is shorn in U.S. Patents 2,710,987 and 2,911,673, incorporated herrin by reference, and embodied in what has become known as ^ BC-3 machine.<br>
As further shown in Fig. 1, the hollow blown container is then applied w;lth indicia or decoration in one or more colors and designs through step B as may be desired. Step C of Fig. 1 shows applying a closure C to the container. The bottom of the container is then cut off as in step D leaving an open-ended tube as shown in step E. Step E shows the tube with the closure thereon as delivered to a customer. The purchaser of the open-ended tube fills the tube with the viscous product through the open end and then seals the open end as at F.<br>
A clo^are can be applied either before or after decorating, herein shown as applied after the first decorating step B.  Preferably, the closure is applied after decorating.<br><br>
In accordance with the invention, the decorating steps are performed by rotating the container with respect to silk screen printer stations P, as shown in Fig. 2, by clamping the container and rotating the container relative to the station. Alternatively, decorating can be by heat bonding a label to the container or by applying a pressure sensitive label.<br>
Referring to Figs. 3-6, the container preferably comprises the infection molded finish 10, the extruded side wall or body 11 sufficiently thin thickness that it is flexible, and the integral bottom wall 12 which is thicker and relatively rigid to allow for driving the tube to rotate the tube in the capping and decorating operations. The wall 11 is preferably of substantially r-onstant thickness, for example, + 0.006 in.<br>
As shown in Figs. 5 and 6, the bottom wall 12 is formed with indentations or recesses 13, 14 which are utilized so that they can h<i engaged by lugs of a chuck for the printing and application closure. as shown in fig. finis preferably includes top or transverse wall having centrally located dispensing opening></i>
The container is preferably made of linear low density polyethylene. A preferred composition is linear low density polyethylene having a dispersion index of greater than 5. However , high density polyethylene, low density polyethylene cr polypropylene * ay be used.<br>
Referring to Figs. 7 and 8, a preferred form of apparatus is show;: in the aforementioned copending application<br><br>
Serial No. 08/228,048 filed April 15, 1994, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Referring to Fig. 8, the apparatus for severing the bottom of a contenner comprises a lower star wheel 20 having recesses 21 for receiving the closures C on the inverted containers A and an associated guide rail 32. The apparatus also includes an upper star wheel 30 with recesses for the container body A and an associated guide rail 31. The upper end of the container is clamped by blocks 26/ 27 having recesses 28, 29 which are movable relative to one another to hold the upper end of the container A. A guillotine blade 24 is movable across the bottorr of the closure by a cylinder to sever the bottom of the container A along a plane that is at 90° to the vertical or longitudinal axis of the container A. The guillotine 24 is guided by guide surfaces 25 in the blocks 26, 27.<br>
The apparatus of Fig. 7 is preferably positioned at a capping station adjacent a rotary turret 30 which is driven intermittently pa fit the capping station to apply the container to the closure. The apparatus shown in Fig. 8 is located at a trimming station and the turret 30 moves the inverted containers past the trimming station to sever the bottom of the container. A guide rail 32 retains the lower end of the capped container in recesses the lever star wheel during severing of the bottom of tne container.<br>
In accordance with a further aspect of the invention, a container structure is provided that facilitates handling, rotating and decorating the container before cutting the closed<br><br>
end. The base 42 of. blow molded container 40 is formed with a single diametrical, lug 44 which is engaged by the complementary lug 46 on the rotating chuck 48 (FIG. 9). Such a construction tends to rigidify the base such that the container 40 can be held and rotated more firmly for decorating. In addition, the lug construction provides a greater thickness than the side wall of the container and maximum surface for engagement by the lug 46 on chuck 43.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 10-14, in a further form, the container 50 is f :&gt;rmed with a diametral lug 44a. In addition, the body of the container 50 is strengthened by diametrically opposed surfaces :2 on the lower end of the container adjacent the base. Each sarface 52 has an arcuate upper end and and tapers axially downwardly and inwardly toward the base 54 of the container 50. Surfaces 52 function to structurally rigidify the base while simultaneously reducing the amount of parison stretch into the base, thereby increasing the thickness of plastic in that area.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 15-18, in another form of the container 60, the entire annular lower end 62 of the container 60 is tapered axially downwardly and inwardly to form a frustoconical surtace. This functions to reduce the amount of parison stretch into the base, increasing the thickness of plastic in that area. In addition, opposed arcuate surfaces 64 are provided or the frustoconical surface.<br>
Refer r it.g to FIGS. 19-21, in still further form of container 70, a plurality of circumferentially spaced grooves<br><br>
72 our provided on the frustoconical surface 74. Opposed arcuate surfaces 76 are provided as in FIGS. 15-18. The grooves function to structurally ngidify the taper area of the base of the bottle.<br>
Referring to FIGS. 23-26, in another form of container 80, the container is formed only with the frustoconical surface 82 and grooves 84.<br>
Typical examples of containers used to make tubes in accordance with the invention comprise:<br>
