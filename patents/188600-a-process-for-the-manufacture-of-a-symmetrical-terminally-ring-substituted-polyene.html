				<th>Full Text</th>

The present invention is concerned with a novel process for the manufacture of symmetrica!, terminally ring-substituted polyenes, especially carotenoids of the canthaxanthin, astaxanthin etc. types and the corresponding 2,2'-dinor-carotenoids (generally referred to as 4,4'-diketo-carotenoids) from acetalized polyene dialdehydes by an acid-catalyzed condensation reaction with cyclic dienol ethers.<br>
Lewis acid-catalyzed additions of a,|3-unsatur3ted ethers (aldehyde enol ethers) to acetals have been known for a long time and date back to the work of MUlIer-Cunradi and Pieroh (see US Patent 2,165,962). Hoaghn and Hirsch [J.A.C.S, Zl, 3468 et seq. (1949)] investigated this reaction further and broadened the possible applications, which Isler et al. likewise did in the nineteen fifties with respect to the synthesis of P-carotene, crocetin dialdehyde, lycopene as well as p-apocarotenoids [Helv. Chim. Acta 39, 249 et seq. and 463 et seq. (1956), ibid. 42, 854 et seq. (1959) as well as US Patents 2,827,481 and 2,827,482]. Later, Mukaiyama [Angew. Chem. 89, 858 et seq. (1977) and Org. Reactions 28, 203 et seq. (1982)] extended the reaction by using the readily accessible trimethylsiiyl enol ethers.<br>
Also in the case of the enol ethers of aliphatic and aiicyclic ketones, not only alkyi enol ethers, but also silyl enol ethers react with acetals to give p-alkoxy-ketones or, with cleavage of alcohol, to give the corresponding ehmination products [Chem. Lett. 1974.16 et seq., J.A.C.S. 1^, 3248 et seq. (1980), Chem. Lett. 1987. 1051 et seq. as well as ibid., 1975, 569 et seq.].<br>
The first Lewis acid-catalyzed condensations of l-alkoxy-l,3-dienes (dienol ethers) with a,[3-unsaturated acetals were reported by Nazarov and Krasnaya [J. Gen. Chem. USSR 28, 2477 et seq. (1958)] and by Makin [Pure &amp; Appl. Chem. 47,173 et seq. (1976), J. Gen. Chem. USSR 31&gt; 3096 et seq. (1961) and 32, 3112 et seq. (1962)]. Here, the coupling of the acetal to the dienol ether takes place as far as can be seen exclusively at its y-position with the formation of a chain-lengthened a,[3-unsaturated acetal, which, however, in competition with the first acetal reacts with further dienol ether with the formation of a further, chain-lengthened a,p-unsaturated acetal etc. [teiomer formation; see also Chemla et al.. Bull. Soc. Chim. Fr. 130, 200 et seq. (1993)]. For this reason such a condensation has i been found not to be workable for synthetic purposes, especially for the synthesis of apocarotenals [Isler et al., Adv. Org. Chem. 4. 115 et seq. (1963)].<br><br>
Not only l-alkoxy-l,3-dienes, but also trimethylsilyloxydienes [of the type CH2=CH-CH=CH-OS!(CH3)3] can be condensed with a,p-unsaturated acetals in the presence of Lewis acid catalysts, as disclosed by Mukaiyama et al. in Chem. Lett. 1975, 319 et seq. In this coupling too the attack seems to take place exclusively at the terminal (y) carbon atom of the diene system [ "y-attack"; Mukaiyama et al.. Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan 50, 1161 et seq. (1977) and Japanese Patent Publication (Kokaz) 36,645/1977/Chem. Abs. 87, 201825 t, (1977)]. In contrast to the reaction with l-alkoxy-l,3-dienes, in which an a,p-unsaturated acetal results, in the case of the reaction of trimethylsilyloxydienes with acetals there is formed an aldehyde which does not react further with the diene (no telomer formation). Thereby, zinc bromide and many other Lewis acids are required as catalysts only in small amounts [Heming (et al.), Tetr. Lett. 1979,3209 et seq. and Chimia 34,265 et seq. (1980) as well as Brownbridge, Synth. 1983, 85 et seq]. By using this method Mukaiyama et al. were able to synthesize vitamin A [Kokai 36,645/1977, Chem. Lett. 1975, 1201 et seq. and Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan 51, 2077 et seq. (1978)] and workers from Rhdne-Poulenc developed new routes to carotenoids and vitamin A (DOS 2,701,489 and A.E.C. Societe de Chimie Organique et Biologique No. 7824350).<br>
The aforementioned Lewis acid-catalyzed condensation of a dienol ether with an a,p-unsaturated acetal based on the works of Nazarov and Krasnaya, Makin as well as Chemla et al. would be a very valuable access to apocarotenals and bis-apocarotenals if the yield of the desired primary product of the type<br>
...CH=CH-CH(OaIkyll)-CH2-CH=CH-CH(Oalkyll)(OaIkyl2)<br>
could be increased and the telomer formation could be suppressed. Thus, the desired polyene aldehyde of the type<br>
.. .CH=CH-CH=CH-CH=CH-CHO could be obtained from this primary product by hydrolysis of the acetal group<br>
C(0alkyl^)(Oalkyi2) and elimination of alkyl^OH [European Patent Publication (EP) 0816334A1].<br>
Some examples are known in which ketone dienol ethers of the type ...CH=CH-CH=C(0aIky!/trimethyIsilyl)-CH2-alkyl<br>
are reacted with aldehydes, acetals, orthoesters and other electrophiles to give a,p-unsat-urated ketones of the type<br>
...E-CH2-CH=CH-CO-CH2-alkyl (E represents an electrophilic substrate) [Tetr. Lett. 22, 705 et seq. and 2833 et seq. (1981), ibid., 27, 2703 et seq. (1986), ibid. 29, 685 et seq. (1988) as well as Chem. Ber. n3, 1571 et<br><br>
seq. (1990)]. This reaction appears to be of somewhat limited use, not on reactivity grounds, but because of the difficult accessibility of the aforementioned ketone dienol ethers, as, inter alia, regioselectivity problems have to be taken into consideration in their production [formation of the undesired regioisomers of the type<br>
...CH2-CH=CH-C(0-alkyl/trimethylsilyl)=CH-alkyl].<br>
Based on the aforementioned dienol ether condensation, A. Riittimann has recently developed a novel, economical synthesis of apocarotenals and bis-apocarotenals (EP 0 816 334 M), which has the advantage that the C-C linkage is effected under catalytic conditions, namely using a Lewis acid catalyst. Moreover, no phosphorus- or sulphur-containing reagents are required in this approach.<br>
A novel synthesis of canthaxanthin, astaxanthin, the corresponding 2,2'-dinor-carotenoids and structurally similar, symmetrical carotenoids having two terminal rings (4,4'-diketo-carotenoids) has now been found. This novel synthesis is likewise based on a catalyzed dienol ether condensation and also avoids the use of phosphorus- and sulphur-containing reagents, but makes use in a very refined and surprising manner of a cyclic compound as a reaction participant which has not only the main features of the terminal ring, but also the dienol ether grouping required for the condensation.<br>
The object of the present invention is to manufacture the aforementioned symmetrical carotenoids starting from polyene diacetals while avoiding as far as possible the aforementioned disadvantages of the state of the art and replacing the Wittig, Horner or Julia reaction hitherto used for this purpose. This object is achieved in accordance with the invention by reacting a polyene diacetal with a cyclic dienol ether in the presence of a suitable catalyst, namely a Lewis acid or Bronsted acid, and, after hydrolyzing the resulting condensation product, undertaking a base- or acid-induced elimination of alcohol at the two ends of the mainly conjugated hydrocarbon chain bonded to the two rings in order to obtain the desired symmetrical, terminally ring-substituted fiiily conjugated polyene. Not only is the reaction of the cyclic dienol ether with the polyene diacetal novel, but surprisingly it is effected with an exclusive attack of the acetal at the y-position of the dienol ether. By the base- or acid-induced elimination of the alkanol subsequent to the hydrolysis two conjugated C-C double bonds are formed without the need for a phosphorus- or sulphur-containing reagent, which is in contrast to the methodology hitherto usually employed in this field.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention is concerned with a process for the manufacture of a symmetrical, terminally ring-substituted polyene of the general formula<br><br><br><br>
or a substituted cyclohexene (m signifies 1, so that formula III in this case specifically represents the formula<br><br><br>
wherein * denotes the respective hnkage position.<br>
The formulae of polyenes and cyclic dienol ethers disclosed in the scope of the present invention embrace in each case isomeric forms, e.g. optically active and cis/trans or E/Z isomers, as wel\ as mixtures thereof unless expressly stated to the contrary. With respect to the E/Z isomerism, then the (all-E) isomers of the polyene dt(0,0-dialkyi acetals) of formula II and of the products of formula I of the process in accordance with the invention are, in general, preferred.<br>
In the first process step of the process in accordance with the invention, i.e. the reaction of the polyene di{0,0-dia!kyl acetal) with the cychc dienol ether under acidic conditions, an exclusive attack of the former compound at the y-position of the cyclic dienol ether takes place. When a cyclic dienol ether of formula III in which R signifies hydrogen and R'* signifies Ci-4-aIkoxy is used, there results as the intermediate product of this first process step a compound of the general formula<br><br><br><br>
This first process step is conveniently carried out by reacting the polyene di(0,0-dialkyl acetal) of formula II with the cyclic dienol ether of formula III in an organic solvent at temperatures in the range of about -SO^C to about +60°C (e.g. from about -25'C to about +60°C), preferably in the temperature range of about -30°C to room temperature (e.g. from about 0°C to about room temperature), and in the presence of a Lewis or Bronsted acid. Suitable organic solvents are, in general, polar or non-polar aprotic solvents. Such solvents are, for example, lower halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. methylene chloride and chloroform; lower aliphatic and cyclic ethers, e.g. diethyl ether, tert.butyl methyl ether and tetrahydrofiiran; lower aliphatic nitriles, e.g. acetonitrile; lower ahphatic esters, e.g. ethyl acetate; as well as aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene. The preferred solvent is acetonitrile, optionally in combination with further aforementioned solvents, especially with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride. Where a mixture of acetonitrile with ethyl acetate or methylene chloride is used, the ratio by volume of acetonitrile to ethyl acetate or methylene chloride is preferably about 1:1 to about 4:1, particularly about 4:1. Examples of Lewis acids which can be used are zinc chloride, zinc chloride dietherate, zinc bromide, zinc di(trif]uoromethanesulphonate), titanium tetra¬chloride, tin tetrachloride, boron trifluoride etherate as well as iron(III) chloride; and examples of Bronsted acids which can be used are p-toluenesulphonic acid, methane-sulphonic acid, trifluoromethanesulphonic acid, sulphuric acid as well as trifluoroacetic acid. In general, the Lewis acids, especially the zinc salts, boron trifluoride etherate and iron(III) chloride, are preferred. The catalysts are, in general, used in catalytic (below stoichiomeric) amounts, conveniently in an amount which is about 0.5 to about 30 mol percent based on the amount of polyene di(0,0-dialkyl acetal) used, with the mol percent<br><br>
range preieraDiy lymg between about :3"/o and W"/o. further, there are conveniently used about 2.1 to about 4 equivalents, preferably about 2.2 to about 2.6 equivalents, of cyclic dienol ether per equivalent of polyene di(0,0-dialkyl acetal). Moreover, the reaction is conveniently effected at normal pressure with, in general, the pressure not being critical.<br>
Frequently, the intermediate of formula V or of formula VI occurs, usually together with diverse similar intermediates, as a precipitate, which can be isolated after cooling the reaction mixture, for example to about -10°C to -20°C, and filtration. Subsequently, the intermediate is then hydrolyzed with aqueous acid to the corresponding compound of formula IV.<br>
When no isolation and subsequent hydrolysis is undertaken, a direct hydrolysis in the reaction mixture can be carried out. In so doing, an acid, preferably sHghdy dilute aqueous acetic acid, for example with aratioby volume acetic acid:water of about 9:1, is added to the reaction mixture and the mixture is subsequently stirred for a period, for example about 30 minutes to about 2 hours, conveniendy in the temperature range of about 0°C to about 50"C. In addition to the acetic acid there can be used especially a catalytic amount, such as about 1-2 mol percent based on the amount of polyene di(0,0-dialkyl acetal) used, of p-toluenesulphonic acid in order to accelerate the hydrolysis somewhat. In comparison to the separate hydrolysis of the intermediate product of formula V or VI, the hydrolysis undertaken directly in the reaction mixture is preferred.<br>
The product of formula of IV can be isolated from the reaction mixture and, if desired, purified in a manner per se. Typically, the mixture is combined with water and the whole is extracted with a water-immiscible organic solvent, such as, for example, with a lower alkane, dialkyl ether or aliphatic ester, e.g. hexane, tert.butyl methyl ether or, respectively, ethyl acetate, and the organic phase is washed with water and/or sodium bicarbonate solution and/or saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried and concentrated. The thus-isolated and at least to some extent washed crude product can then, if desired, be purified further, for example by column chromatography, e.g. using eluting agents such as hexane, ethyl acetate, toluene or mixtures thereof, or (re)crystallization, for example from an alcohol, e.g. methanol or ethanol.<br>
With respect to the last process step, i.e. the cleavage of the alkanol R^OH from the compound of formula IV, eliminations of the alkanol from p-alkoxyaldehydes or 5-alkoxy-a,p-unsaturated aldehydes with the formation of the corresponding a,p-unsaturated aldehydes are known in the specialist literature and can be carried out under a variety of<br><br>
conditions. For example, in the field of known base-induced eliminations 1,8-diazabicyclol5.4.0]undec-7-ene is very often used as the base in an amount of about 2 to 4 equivalents based on the amount of aldehyde used. Such conditions are used in the known production of carotenoids [see, inter alia, Btill. Chem. Soc. Japan 50, 1161 et seq. (1977), ibid. 51, 2077 et seq. (1978), Chem. Lett. 1975, 1201 et seq. and German Offenlegungsschrift 2,701,489] and ofvitamin A (see, inter alia, Chem. Lett. 1975,1201 et seq). As examples of acid-induced alkanol cleavages reference is again made to Bull. Chem. Soc. Japan 50, 1161 et seq. (1977) and to J. Gen. Chem. USSR 30, 3875 et seq. (1960) in which p-toluenesulphonic acid or 85% phosphoric acid is used as the acid catalyst. The buffer system sodium acetate/ acetic acid [Helv. Chem. Acta. 39, 249 et seq. and 463 et seq. (1956) and US-Patents 2,827,481 and 2,827,482] has been used for such a cleavage especially in the production of the carotenoids. Also in the case of corresponding alkoxy ketones (P-alkoxyketones or 5-alkoxy-a,p-unsaturated ketones) the cleavage of the alkanol in general succeeds very well: see in this respect Synthesis 1986,1004 et seq. or J. Org. Chem. 49, 3604 et seq. (1984). Taking into consideration this and other pertinent literature a person skilled in the art will have no difficulties in finding reaction conditions for the successful performance of the last step of the process in accordance with the invention.<br>
Furthermore, the cleavage of the alkanol R'OH (2 equivalents per equivalent of the compound of formula IV) can also be carried out with several equivalent amounts of a base based on one equivalent of the compound of formula IV. Thus, the last process step in this case is conveniently carried out by converting the compound of formula IV, dissolved in a suitable organic solvent, into the corresponding polyene of formula I in the presence ofa base with cleavage of the alkanol R~OH. Suitable organic solvents are, in general, protic or aprotic solvents or mixtures thereof, such as, for example, alcohols, e.g. ethanol and isopropanol, and alcohol mixtures; or aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. toluene. The base can be inorganic or organic, and there are suitable, in general, strong bases, especially those alkali metal alcoholates which are stronger bases, e.g. sodium ethylate. As indicated above, there are conveniently used at least two equivalents of base per equivalent of the compound of formula IV, preferably about 2.5 to about 8 equivalents.<br>
Thereby, when an alkali metal alcoholate is used as the base, either a solution of the sodium alkoxide in the alkanol is prepared in advance or this solution is prepared freshly from metallic sodium and the alkanol. The bringing together of the alkanolic solution of the sodium alkoxidewith the solution or suspension of the compound of formula IV in the (same) aikanol, preferably likevi/ise prepared in advance, can be effected in optional<br><br>
sequence. The reaction mixture is then stirred while heating, suitable in the temperature range of about eO^C to about l4(fC, preferably at temperatures of about 80°C to about 100°C. Depending on the boiling point of the solvent the reaction is conveniently effected at normal pressure or with a slight excess pressure (in order to achieve the desired temperature), with, in general, the pressure not being critical. Under these conditions the cleavage reaction has normally finished after a few hours, especially after about 5 to 10 hours.<br>
In the case of an acid-induced alkanol cleavage, suitable acids are, in general, strong mineral acids, such as, for exarhple, hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, hydroiodic acid, sulphuric acid and perchloric acid, and sulphonic acids, such as, for example, methane-sulphonic acid, trifluoromethanesulphonic acid and p-toluenesulphonic acid. The mineral acids can be aqueous and, depending on the acid, can have a concentration of about 10 to about 50%. Hydrochloric acid (especially about 10 to 37%), hydrobromic acid (especially about 25 to 30%) or hydroiodic acid (e.g. 47%) is the most suitable. In this case only a catalytic amount, i.e. up to a maximum of 1 equivalent per equivalent of the compound of formula IV, preferably about 0.1 to about 1 equivalent, is required. Further, the acid-induced alkanol cleavage is effected in a solvent in which the compound of formula IV has a good solubility (a so-called "homogeneous cleavage") or in a solvent in which this is not the case, i.e. in which the compound of formula IV is on the other hand in suspension (heterogeneous cleavage). In both cases, however, the acid catalyst need not be completely dissolved. Suitable solvents for the homogenous cleavage are especially halogenated aliphatic hydrocarbons, e.g. methylene chloride, chloroform and 1,2-dichloroethane, and aromatic hydrocarbons, e.g. benzene and toluene. Suitable solvents (dispersion media) for the heterogeneous cleavage are lower aliphatic nitriles, ketones and carboxylic acids, e.g. acetonitrile, acetone and, respectively, acetic acid, preferably acetonitrile and acetone. In both cases the alkanol cleavage is conveniently effected in the temperature range of about -20°C to about +50°C, preferably in the range of about tf^C to room temperature. The reaction time is in each case dependent on the reaction temperature and can amount to several hours, with the cleavage reaction normally having finished at the latest after about 5 hours.<br>
Such an acid-induced alkanol cleavage is more suitable than a base-induced alkanol cleavage for the manufacture of astaxanthin, i.e. the compound of formula I in which R' signifies hydroxy and m and n both signify 1.<br><br>
As an alternative to the separate hydrolysis and alkanol cleavage, these two process steps can be carried out in a combined process step without isolation of the compound of formula IV using a somewhat stronger acid, especially a mineral acid, such as, for example, aqueous hydrochloric acid.<br>
Irrespective of the chosen procedure for the last process step, the product can be isolated from the reaction mixture in a manner known per se, normally by cooling the reaction mixture, conveniently to room temperature or even to about 0°C, optional addition of water and filtration. After its isolation the product can be washed, for example with water and/or aqueous alcohol, and finally, if desired, dried under reduced pressure. If desired, further methods such as column chromatography and recrystalhzation can be used in order to arrive at a still purer product. Where an isomerization of the Z-isomers present in the product to the corresponding E-isomers is desired, a respective intermediate step can be included in the isolation and purification process; this comprises adding an alcohol or aqueous alcohol, e.g. aqueous isopropanol, immediately after the cooling, heating the mixture in the temperature range of about 80°C to about 100°C and thereupon again cooling the mixture and filtering off and drying the solid. Saturated lower hydrocarbons, e.g. heptane, also come into consideration as possible solvents. In general, the E-isomers are less soluble than the corresponding Z-isomers and accordingly often occur as a precipitate in higher yield. Furthermore, as mentioned above, the (all-E)-isomers of the products of formula I are, in general, preferred.<br>
In the process in accordance with the invention defined above R^ preferably signifies methyl, either R^ preferably signifies hydrogen and R^ preferably signifies isobutoxy or R^ and R'* together preferably signiiy the methylenedioxy group (R^ = R = hydrogen), and n preferably signifies 1.<br>
While some of the educts of the process in accordance with the invention are known, others can be produced according to methods known per se fi-om precursors which are to some extent known.<br>
Thus, for example, the novel polyene di(0,0-dialkyl acetals) of formula II can be prepared very simply in a known general manner by reacting the corresponding polyene dialdehyde of the formula<br><br><br>
CHO<br>
OHCl<br>
VII<br><br>
with the respective trialkyl orthoformate, especially in the corresponding Cj-s-alkanol, e.g. methanol for the 0,0-dimethyl acetal, and in the presence of a catalytic amount of an organic acid or of a Lewis acid, e.g. p-toluenesulphonic acid or, respectively, zinc chloride [see, for example, Organikum, Organ isch-chemisches Grundpraktikum, 6' edition, p. 377 et seq. (1963)]. The reaction takes place to some extent in suspension, i.e. the respective polyene dialdehyde is suspended in the alkanol or in an alkanol/methytene chloride mixture and then there are conveniently added to the suspension about four mol equiva¬lents of the trialkyl orthoformate, followed by a trace of acid catalyst, e.g. p-toluene¬sulphonic acid. In so doing, the dialdehyde dissolves slowly and the polyene di(0,0-diatkyl acetal) of formula [I which is formed simultaneously crystallizes out slowly. The reaction is conveniendy carried out in the temperature range of about 0'C to about 40°C and as a rule takes from 30 minutes to about 4 hours. As further references which illustrate the generally known acetalization method, reference is made to European Patent Publications 252 389 and 391 033 as well as to J. Mol. Cat. Z9,117 et seq.

The polyene dialdehydes of formula VII, in turn, are either known, especially from the specialist hterature concerning carotenoids, or, where novel, can be produced according to methods known per se. Thus, for example, the two-fold reaction of 2,7-dimethyl-2,4,6-octatriene-l,8-dial (the so-called "Cio-dial") with C5- or Cio-Wittig aldehydes to give different chain-lengthened dialdehydes has become known from this literature. The text books "Carotenoids" (0. Isler, published by Birkhauser Basel and Stuttgart, 1971), especially its chapters VI and XII and the further literature mentioned therein, and "Carotenoids, Volume 2 : Synthesis" (G. Britton, S. Liaaen-Jensen and H. Pfander, published by Birkhauser Basel Boston Berlin, 1996), especially its chapters III and V!I, yield much useful information on the production and the occurrence of the known dialdehydes.<br>
The cyclic dienol ethers of formula III are novel and represent a further aspect of the present invention.<br>
Those cyclic dienol ethers of formula III in which R^ signifies hydrogen, R"" signifies Ci.4-alkoxy and m signifies 0 can be prepared in accordance with Reaction Scheme 1 hereinafter starting from the known 2-methyI-l,3-cyclopentanedione:<br><br><br>
Those compounds of formula X in which R* signifies methoxy or isobutoxy are known and can be produced according to the method of Rosenberger et al. [J. Org. Chem<br>
47, 2134 et seq. (1982)] from the commercially available 2-methyl-1,3-cyclopentanedione/l'hydroxy-2-methyl-cyclopenten-3-oneof formula VIII by acid-catalyzed etherification with methanol or, respectively, isobutanol to the corresponding compound of formula IX, followed by a double methylation with methyl iodide and lithium diisopropylamine at low temperature, e.g. at about -70°C. p-Toluenesulphonic acid/toluene is especially suitable as the acid catalyst/solvent combination for the first<br><br>
process step VIII -» [X and tetrahydrofuran is preferably used as the solvent for the second process step. The remaining compounds of formula X in which R signifies a Ci-4-alkoxy group other than methoxy or isobutoxycan be produced in an analogous manner.<br>
In accordance with the Peterson olefination [J. Org. Chem. 33, 780 et seq. (1968)] the keto enot ether of formula X is then reacted with trimethylsilylmethyllithium (itself suitable produced from trimethylsilylmethyl chloride and metallic lithium in pentane) in pentane, and, after subsequent addition of water, gives the compound of formula XI in crystalline form. Subsequently, this can be converted directly with potassium hydride as the base and in tetrahydrofuran as the solvent at temperatures below room temperature, e.g. in the temperature range of about 0°C to about IS^C, into the desired cyclic dienol ether of formula Ilia. In so doing, the pentane used as the solvent in process step X ^^ XI<br>
is replaceddistillativelyby the solvent of the last process step XI -&gt; Ilia (tetrahydrofuran) until a boiling point of about 62°C (boiling point of tetrahydrofuran 66°C) is attained. It is not necessary to isolate the compound of formula XI produced as the intermediate: by the solvent exchange and the thermal treatment this compound decomposes into the desired cyclic dienol ether of formula IJIa and the lithium salt of trimethylsilanol.<br>
After the addition of water the thus-obtained dienol ether is conveniendy extracted tvith a suitable solvent, especially a lower alkane, e.g. pentane or hexane, or a lower aliphatic ether, e.g. diethyl ether, and thereafter purified by distillation under a high vacuum.<br>
Those cyclic dienol ethers of formula III in which R^ signifies hydrogen, R* signifies Ci.4-alkoxy and m signifies 1 can be produced in accordance with Reaction Scheme 2 hereinafter:<br><br><br>
Those compounds of formula XIII in which R'* signifies methoxy, ethoxy or isobutoxy are known [Tetr. Lett. 37, 1015 et seq. (1996) and, respectively, EP 31875] and can be produced according to the method of Rosenberger et al. [J. Org. Chem. 47, 2130 (19S2}j from methyl isobutylate and ethy] vinyl ketone (by a Robinson annulation) followed by an acid-catal)'zed etherification of the resulting l-hydroxy-cycIohexen-3-one of formula XII with the corresponding alkanol to give the corresponding compound of formula XIII. Methanesulphonic acid or p-toluenesulphonic acid is especially suitable as the acid catalyst for the last process step XII -&gt; XIII and a lower alkane, e.g. hexane, or an aromatic hydrocarbon e.g. benzene or toluene, is especially suitable as the solvent. The remaining compounds of formula XIII in which R* signifies a C|-.!-alkoxy group other than methoxy, ethoxy or isobutoxy can be produced in an analogous manner.<br><br>
The third and the last process step to the desired cydic dienol ether of formula Illb can be carried out analogously to process step X —» XI and process step XI -&gt; Ilia for the production of the corresponding 5-ring compound [in accordance with the Peterson olefination, J. Org. Chem. 33, 780 et seq (1980) ]. Although the compound of formula XIV can be isolated and purified by crystalUzation, it is, however, very unstable, especially in pure crystalline form; it readily rearranges in air into the compound of the formula<br><br>
Therefore, the compound of formula of XIV after crystallization and drying, suitably under a high vacuum and while gassing with inert gas, e.g. argon, must be used as soon as possible in the next (last) process step. This last process step is conveniently effected in the presence of potassium hydride as the base and in tetrahydrofuran as the solvent at temperatures in the range of about O^C to about 15°C.<br>
After the addition of water the thus-obtained dieno! ether is conveniently extracted with a suitable solvent, especially a lower alkane, e.g. pentane or hexane, or a lower ahphatic ether, e.g. diethyl ether, and thereafter purified by distillation under a high vacuum.<br>
This production of the cyclic dienol ether of formula lib is carried out more efficiently by reacting the compound of formula XIII with trimethylsilylmethyllithium in pentane at temperatures of about 0°C to about -10°C and thereafter replacing the pentane by tetrahydrofuran until the boiling point of tetrahydrofuran is achieved; this is thus a one-pot process. As in the above-described production of the cyclic enol ether of formula ilia, the resulting intermediate of formula XIV thereby decomposes into the desired cyclic enol ether of formula Illb and the lithium salt of trimethylsilanol.   Heating in tetrahydrofuran for too long a time should, however, be avoided, since under the prevailing basic conditions a partial isomerization of the resulting cyclic enol ether into the corresponding cyclohexadiene of the formula<br><br><br>
The compound of formula XVII is acetali2ed in a manner known per se with a ketone R^COR^ or its dimethyl acetal to give the corresponding compound of formula XVIII [see Heiv. Chim. Acta 64, 2436 et seq. (1981) and EP 0 085 158 A2]. Where acetone or its dimethyl acetal is used as the ketone or dimethyl acetal, in this case the thus-obtained compound of formula XVIII in which R' and R^ both signify' methyl and m signifies 0 or 1 is known. However, formaldehyde or formaldehyde dimethyl acetal is preferably used as the acetalizing reagent and then the compound of formula XVIII in which R^ and R both signify hydrogen is obtained in high yield. The next t^\'o process steps XVIII —* XIX and<br><br>
XIX —&gt; IIIc can be carried out analogously to process steps X -&gt; XI and XI —&gt; Ilia or<br>
Xlll —&gt; XIV and XIV —* Illb of Reaction Scheme 1 or, respectively, 2. The preferred product of this process is 4,6,6-trimethyl-5,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-5-methylidene-i,3-benzodioxol, i.e. the compound of formula IIIc in which R^ and R both signify hydrogen and m signifies 1.<br>
Not only the cyclic dienol ethers of formula III, but also the intermediates of formulae IV, V and VI are novel compounds and likewise represent a further aspect of the present invention.<br>
The final products of the process in accordance with the invention, i.e. the symmetrical, terminal ring-substituted polyenes of general formula I, belong for the most part to the carotenoid field and can be used in a corresponding manner, for example as colorants or pigments for foodstuffs, egg yolk, the integuments (especially skin, legs and beak) and/or the subcutaneous fat of poultry, the flesh and/or the integuments (especially skin, scales and shell) offish and crustaceans etc. For example, astaxanthm is extremely suitable as a pigment for the pigmentation of salmon. This use can be effected according to methods known per se as described, for example, in European Patent Publication No. 630,578.<br><br>

The crystals present dissolved in about 2-3 minutes and a yellow precipitate formed after about a further 5 minutes. After stirring for about 40 minutes 250 ml of methanol were added dropwise, followed by 0.3 ml of triethylamine. About 50 ml of solvent, i.e. methylene chloride, were subsequently distilled off under reduced pressure (350-400 mbar/35-40 kPa) at 30°C during 30 minutes.

(i)      Preparation of l-isobutoxy-2.4.4-trimethyl-cyclopenten-3-one<br>
For the preparation of a solution of lithium diisopropyJamine in tetrahydrofuran ("LDA solution"), 117 ml (830 mmol) of diisopropylamine were added dropwise to a mixture of 470 ml (750 mmol) of a 1.6M solution of butylHthium in hexane and 390 ml of tetrahydrofuran under argon within 30 minutes and the temperature was left to come slowly to-15°C.<br>
430 ml (about 330 mmol) of the above LDA solution were placed at "70°C in a 1.5 1 suiphonation flask provided with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, 500 ml dropping fiannel and argon gasification. 55 g (327 mmol) of l-isobutoxy-2-methyl-cyclopenten-3-one were added dropwise thereto. The reaction mixture was then stirred at -7G°C for 20 minutes, subsequently treated slowfy with 20.3 ml (46.3 g, 326 mmol) of methyl iodide and left to come to room temperature. After stirring at room temperature for 15 minutes the mixture was again cooled to -70°C and a further 300 ml (230 mmol) of the above LDA solution were added dropwise, followed by 14.1 ml (32.1 g, 226 mol) of methyl iodide. The mixture was again left to come to room temperature and this procedure was repeated three times with 128 ml (98 mmol) of LDA solution and 6.1 ml (14 g, 100 mmol) of methyl iodide, 86 ml (66 mmol) of LDA solution and 4.0 ml (9 g, 65 mmol) of methyl iodide as well as 42 ml (32 mmol) of LDA solution and 2.0 ml (4.5 g, 32 ml) of methyl iodide. The reaction mixture was thereafl:er stirred at room temperature for one hour.<br>
For the working up, there were added slowly thereto, initially dropwise, 100 mi of water and then 500 ml of diethyl ether, the aqueous phase was separated and the organic phase was washed with about 500 m! of saturated sodium chloride solution. The organic phase was then dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated at 35°C under reduced pressure. This gave 65 g of crude l-isobutoxy-2,4,4-trimethyl-cyclopenten-3-one as a colourless oil.<br><br>
This methylation reaction was repeated again in a wholely analogous manner starting from 49 g (291 mmol) of l-isobutoxy-2-methyl-cyclopenten-3-one. A further 49 g of crude l-!sobutoxy-2,4&gt;4-trimethyl-cyclopenten-3-one were obtained in this manner.<br>
The crude products (together 114 g) of these two batches were purified by distillation over a short Vigreux column [b.p. about 83°C/0.4 mbar (40 Pa)]. This gave 85 g of product which partially solidified in the form of a glass. The product was dissolved in 500 ml of pentane and crystalhzed fi-om the solution in a deep freezer (-25°C). After filtration the crystals were dried at room temperature under a vacuum (14 mmHg), which gave 79.6 g (66% yield) of l-isobutoxy-2,4,4-trimethyl-cyclopenten-3-one as snow-white platelets, m.p. 63°C. The content of the desired product according to gas chromatography (GC) was 100%.<br>
(ii)     Preparation of l-isobutoxy-2,4.4-trimethvl-3-exomethylene-cyclopentene<br>
170 ml of an about 0.8 M solution of trimethylsilylmethyllithium (about 140 mmol) in pentane [prepared by heating 3.3 g (0.48 mol) of lithium powder in 140 ml of pentane with 24.7 g (0.2 mol) of chIoromethyitrimethylsilaneat40'^C (reflux temperature) for about 16 hours, filtering under argon with a pressure suction filter and rinsing with about 20 ml of pentane; yield in each case about 80-85% according to titration: see J. Organomet. Chem 9, 165-168 (1967)] were placed in a 500 ml four-necked sulphonation flask provided with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, dropping funnel and argon gasification. A solution of23g (112 mol) of l-isobutoxy-2,4,4-trimethyl-cyclopenten-3-one (96% pure according to GC) in 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise thereto at -20°C. Then, the mixture was warmed to room temperature, a Vigreux column was fitted and solvent (pentane) was distilled off and continuous addition of tetrahydrofuran (finally 300 mo!) was carried out until a head temperature of 62'C was attained. Then, the mixture was cooled to 0°C and treated dropwise with 150 ml of water. After extraction with pentane and washing the organic phase with saturated sodium carbonate solution and sodium chloride solution the organic phase was dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated at 35*^0 under reduced pressure. A distillation over a short Vigreux column [b.p. 49-55°C/0.40-0.45 mbar (40-45 Pa) ] gave 17.24 g (78% yield) of 1 -isobutoxy-2,4,4-trimethyl-3-exomethylene-cyclopentene as a colourless oil with a content of 99.4% according to GC.

450 ml of a 0.8M solution of trimethylsilylmethyllithium (about 360 mmol/1.3 eq) in pentane [prepared from 7.1 g (1 mol) of lithium powder, 51 g (0.41 mol) of chloromethyl-trimethylsilane and 350 ml of pentane analogously to the method described in Example 3 (ii)/J. Organomet. Chem. 9,165-168 (1967)] were placed in a 750 ml four-necked sulphonation flask provided with a magnetic stirrer, thermometer, dropping funnel and argon gasification. 60 g (0.278 mol) of i-isobutoxy-2,4,4-trimethyI-cycIohexen-3-one (9.75% pure according to GC) were added dropwise to the solution at about -20°C in about one hour, which gave rise to a shghtly exothermic reaction. After completion of the addition the mixture was stirred at 0'C in an ice bath for one hour until educt was no longer present according to GC.<br>
Then 100 mi of water were added slowly through the dropping funnel. Thereafter, the aqueous phase was separated and extracted twice with 50 ml each time, a total of 100 ml, of pentane. The combined organic phase was washed with 100 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated under reduced pressure. Crystalhzation from 125 ml of pentane while stirring at 50°C for about one hour gave, after suction filtration and drying for about 18 hours under a high vacuum at room temperature, 75 g (90% yield) of 1-isobutoxy-2,4,4-trimethyl-3-hydroxy-3-trimethylsilylmethyl-cyclohexene as white crystals, m.p. about 50°C; IH-NMR (250 MHz, CDCI3): inter alia 0.12 (s, 9H, Si(CH3)3), 1.80 (t, J = 7Hz, 2-CH2), 1.86 (s, 2H,-CH2-Si), 2,47(t,J=7Hz,3-CH2).<br>
This product must be used immediately in the next step, as it is very unstable and readily rearranges into the oily compound of formula XV (see corresponding remarks in the general description).<br>
(ii)     Preparation of l-isobutoxv-2,4,4-trimethyl-3-exomethyiene-cyclohexene<br><br>
60 ml of a potassium hydride suspension in oil (about 20%wt./vol., containing about 12 g/0.3 mol KH) were placed in a 750 ml four-necked sulphonation flask provided with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, dropping funnel and argon gasification. The potassium hydride was washed three times with 25 ml each time, a total of 75 ml, of pentane, with the solvent being decanted off after each washing, and 200 mloftetrahydrofuran were added thereto. After cooling the mixture to 5°C by means of an ice bath a solution of the above 75 g (0.25 mol) of l-isobutoxy-2,4,4-trimethyl-3-hydroxy-3-tnmethylsilylmethy!-cyclohexene in 50 ml of tetrahydrofuran was added dropwise in about 1 hour at a maximum temperature of lO^C. Then the mixture was stirred at 15-20'C/1 hour and at room temperature/1 hour (GC control: about 96% product and no longer educt).<br>
For the working up, the mixture was cooled to 0°C and 200 ml of water were cautiously added dropwise. The two phases were now separated and the aqueous phase was extracted three times with 100 ml each time, a total of 300 ml, of pentane. The combined organic phases were washed with 100 ml of saturated sodium chloride solution, dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated. The separated residue was again taken up in 250 ml of pentane, again dried with anhydrous sodium sulphate, filtered and concentrated under reduced pressure. This gave 58 g of crude l-isobutoxy-2,4,4-trimethyl-3-exomethylene-cyclohexene as a yellowish liquid. A distillation at 0.1 mbar (10 Pa) over a small 10 cm Vigreux column gave at aboihng point of about 55-60'C 51.2 g (93% yield) of l-isobutoxy-2,4,4-trimethyl-3-exomethylene-cyctohexene as a colourless oil with a content of the desired product of 95% according to GC.

sulphonation flask provided with a mechanical stirrer, thermometer, 20 cm Vigreux column with distillation headpiece and argon gasification. 53 g (0.25 mol) of 1-isobutoxy-2,4,4-trimethyl-cyclohexen-3-one (97.5% pure according to GC) in 100 ml of tetrahydro-furan were added dropwise to the solution within 30 minutes at about -20°C, which gave rise to a slight exothermic reaction. Then the mixture was stirred at O'^C for 1 hour, about 300 ml of pentane were subsequendy distilled off through the Vigreux column and, after the addition of 200 ml of tetrahydrofuran, the distillation was continued until a boihng point of about 60°C was attained (GC control: about 90% of desired product; educt and intermediate no longer present).<br>
Then, the mixture was cooled to +5°C, 200 ml of water were cautiously added dropwise and the mixture was worked up as in the previous experiment [Example 4 (ii)].

0.5 ml oftriethylamine, 20 ml of methanol were added and the methylene chloride was removed under reduced pressure (350 mbar/35 kPa) at 20-30°C. The resulting orange crystals were now cooled at -5°C for 2 hours. After suction filtration, washing (methanol, 0°C) and drying under a high vacuum at room temperature for 18 hours there were obtained 5.3 g (about 95% yield) of 3,4,3',4'-tetradehydro-7,8,7',8'-tetrahydro-4,4'-diisobutoxy-8,8'-dimethoxy-p,p'-carotene as orange crystals which were used immediately in the next reaction (ii).<br>

After cooling the mixture to 3°C 15 ml of water were added thereto and, after 30 minutes, the mixture was suction filtered using a P3 fi-it and washed with 10 ml of methanol at -20°C. After drying the product at room temperature under a high vacuum there were obtained 4.0 g of the compound named in the title as orange crystals, m.p. 169-179°C. The crystals were recrystallized by dissolution in 30 ml of methylene chloride and replacement by 20 ml of methanol under reduced pressure [as described under (i)].

Then, 60 ml of ethanol were added thereto continuously and the solution was concentrated until the final volume was about 15-20 ml. For the isomerization, the resulting suspension was then boiled at reflux for 2 hours, cooled to room temperature and filtered, and the crystaJs were washed with about 10 ml of ethanol at -20°C. Drying at SO°C under a high vacuum for two hours gave 3.30 g of astaxanthin as dark violet crystals which were recrystallized from 70 ml of methylene chloride and 40 ml of acetone as described under (a). This gave 3.10 g (74% vield) of astaxanthin as deep violet ghstening crystals,<br><br>

Preparation of3.3'-dihvdroxv-4.4'-dikel:o-p.P'-carotene. i.e. of a^taxanthin (formula I wherein R' signifies hydroxy and m and n both signify 1; "through process" II + III -^ I)<br>
50 ml of methylene chloride were placed in a 100 ml four-necked sulphonation flask provided with a magnetic stirrer, thermometer and argon gasification and about 55 mg (6 drops, 0.5 mmol) of acetone dimethyl acetal and 40 mg (3 moI%) of anhydrous iron(III) chloride were added. The mixture was stirred at 35-40'C for 2 hours. Then it was cooled to -30°C and 2.80 g (7 mmol) of crocetin dialdehyde dimethyl acetal (HPLC: &gt; 97% pure) and 3.28 g (18.2 mmol, 2.6 eq.) of 4,6,6-trimethyl-5,6,7,7a-tetrahydro-5-methylidene-l,3-benzodioxol were added thereto in one portion and without solvent. The mixture was then stirred at -30'C to -25'C for 41/2 hours under HPLC control. Then 1 ml (about 1.5 g/ 9 mmol) of 48% aqueous hydrobromic acid and 50 ml of methylene chloride were added thereto at -25'C and the mixture was stirred at -15'^C for a further 11/4 hours.<br>
For the neutralization, 5, ml (10 mmol) of2N sodium hydroxide solution were added to the mixture in one portion and the mixture was stirred for 5 minutes. Then, it was poured into water, the water was separated and the organic phase was washed with saturated sodium bicarbonate solution and semi-saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over anhydrous sodium sulphate and concentrated to about 30 ml under reduced pressure. The concentrated solution was then filtered over a pad of 15 g of silica gel (0.04-0.056 mm) using a methylene chloride/diethyl ether (3:1) solvent mixture, concentrated somewhat under reduced pressure and continuously replaced by ethanol until the final volume was 20 ml, at which point crystallization set in. The resulting suspension was treated with a small spatula tip of butylated hydroxytoluene and, for the isomer ization, refluxed for about 16 hours. Then it was cooled to room temperature, suction filtered and washed with cold ethanol. This gave, after drying at 70'C under a high vacuum for two hours, 3.60 g of violet crystals which were recrystalHzed twice fi-om methylene chloride/acetone as described under Example 18(a). In this manner there were obtained 3.00 g (68% yield based on crocetin dialdehyde dimethyl acetal used) of astaxanthin as deep violet, glistening crystals, m.p. 219'C. HPLC content (wt.% compared with standard): (all E)-astaxanthin: 95% (9Z + 13Z)-astaxanthin: 0.2% mo nomethoxymethyl-astaxanthin: 1% S'-apoastaxanthinal: 1%<br>
