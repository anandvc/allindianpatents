The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
1<br>
 <br>
I.	Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to an integrated wound dressing system for the care and treatment of wounds. More particularly, the present invention relates to an all-in-one wound dressing system and method having a bandage, treatment material, and fasteners in an integrated unit for quickly and effectively treating a wide array of wounds.<br>
II.	Background Art<br>
One of the leading causes of death on military battlegrounds and in hospital trauma units is severe blood loss and the associated shock that it produces. Therefore, one of the most vital priorities of caregivers (medics, first responders, and medical providers) is to control and stop bleeding. There are many devices and methods that may be employed to control bleeding. One of the most commonly used devices for bleeding control is the elastic bandage.<br>
Elastic bandages have been known in the prior art for many years. These bandages are sometimes called "roller" bandages or "wraps" and come in rolls having various fasteners, such as Velcro速, metal clips, or tape. They are sold under brand names such as ACE速 wrap.<br>
Elastic bandages are a preferred wound dressing by caregivers ranging from<br>
physicians and trained medics to individual first responders with minima! first aid<br>
training. Elastics bandages are highly adaptable to treat a range of wounds and<br>
conform to virtually any body part. Elastic bandages provide many benefits at the<br>
wound site, including applying varying degrees of compression and support to the<br>
wound, as well as providing a sterile barrier around the.wound.. Compression and<br>
support is effective in controlling bleeding, and reducing pain and swelling in the area<br>
around the wound. The sterile barrier reduces the risk of contamination and infection of<br>
the wound.	.<br>
Elastic bandages are also effective in applying and securing other treatment medicaments and materials to the wound site. One material that is often used in wound dressing and treatment is a woven fabric or gauze. Gauze is effective in controlling bleeding and can be placed directly on the wound to provide focused treatment at the wound site, Gauze is also used as a sterile material to remove foreign matter from the wound site.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
Many currently available bandages act to cover the wound site. Their main function is to keep the wound site clean, not to control hemorrhage, (n order to control hemorrhage, another material, such as gauze, must be used at the wound site: The gauze can then be covered and wrapped by the bandage. These bandages require the introduction and use of other materials to properly treat a wound.<br>
There are presently available hemostatic dressings that are designed to promote the accelerated clotting of blood at wounds. Examples of these dressing are the HemCon速 bandage {HernCon Inc., Tigard, Oregon, U.S.A) and QuickClot速 (Z-Medica Corporation, Wallingford, Connecticut, U.S.A.). While these products generally promote clotting, they still require the application of direct pressure to the wound site in order to be effective.<br>
While the above described wound treatments are suitable, the handling and use of the various separate components can be cumbersome and time consuming which increases the risk of blood loss and associated complications. Also, the introduction of multiple components to the wound site increases the risk of contamination and infection. Notwithstanding the usefulness of the above-described treatments, a need still exists for a fully integrated wound treatment system and method for treating wounds quickly and effectively while reducing the risk of contamination and infection. III.       Disclosure of the Invention<br>

V.        Detailed Description of the Drawings<br>
The present invention as illustrated, for example, in FIG. 1 is directed to an integrated wound treatment system ("system") 1Qo. The system 100 preferably includes at least an elastic bandage 110 and a receptacle (or means for storing sterile material and/or gauze) 120 disposed on the elastic bandage 110.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, the receptacle 120 forms a pocket and contains a sterile wound treatment material 140, e.g gauze. The receptacle 120 includes a first surface 125 adapted for contact with the wound. The surface may comprise a single layer structure or a multiple layer structure. In one embodiment, the surface includes a non-adherent pad layer 126, a plastic layer 130, or a combination thereof. For example, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, the non-adherent pad 126 is disposed on an exterior surface of the receptacle 120 and forms a wound contacting surface 125.<br>
In keeping with the invention, the wound treatment system 100 is provided with an occlusion layer. For example, the plastic layer 130 is disposed adjacent to the non測adherent pad 126. In some embodiments, plastic layer 130 is disposed adjacent an interior surface of receptacle 120. In some embodiments, the plastic layer 130 can be removed from receptacle 120 and placed on the wound such that the plastic layer 130 forms the wound contacting surface. Alternatively, if desired, the plastic layer 130 can be removed from the receptacle and discarded such that no occlusion layer is provided. . In some embodiments, the plastic layer 130 may be fixedly attached to the wound contacting surface 125 such that when the dressing is applied, plastic layer 130 abuts the wound and forms an occlusion layer. The plastic layer 130 acts to maintain moisture and heat levels at the wound site and impedes the passage of air into or out of the wound site.<br>
The non-adherent pad layer 126 minimizes the  adhesion of the dressing to the wound. The plastic layer 130 serves as an occlusion layer and protects the treatment material 140 from contamination. The occlusion layer is effective to provide a heat barrier that minimizes heat loss at the wound site. This is particularly useful when dressing abdominal wounds which often lead to significant heat loss. Occlusion dressings have also been found to promote faster healing.<br>
The receptacle 120 includes an exit 150 that Provides access to the treatment materia! 140 and facilitates controlled withdrawal of treatment material 140. The exit 150 may include any element, or combination.of elements, that allow for the removaf of the treatment material. 140 from the receptacle 120. For example, the exit 150 may<br>
 <br>
 <br>
comprise any of a slit, an opening, an overiapping flap, or any similar arrangement that<br>
allows the treatment material 140 to be controllably removed from the receptacle 120.<br>
See FIGs. 1 and 2(b).	,<br>
The receptacle 120 preferably has a low-profile design and. provides a substantially flat pocket having a generally uniform distribution of treatment material 140 throughout the receptacle. The receptacle 120 and treatment material 140 are configured to store a sufficient amount of treatment material 140 to clean and treat a range of wound sizes and severities. The caregiver removes the treatment material 140 from the receptacle 120 by pulling the treatment material 140 through the exit 150. The desired amount of treatment material 140 may be readily selected by the caregiver: This is beneficial when treating multiple wounds, for example both entry and exit wounds, with the same dressing. In some embodiments, the treatment material 140 may be divided into portions of predetermined size, for example, with a perforated boundary between portions.<br>
Once selected, the treatment material 140 is used to provide sterile cleaning of the wound. If no cleaning is necessary, or if controlling the bleeding is more vital, the treatment material 140 is placed on the wound, as needed. The elastic bandage 110 ts then placed over the wound area and the wound is wrapped. The elastic bandage 110 may be wrapped such that it provides the desired compression to the wound in order to assist in bleeding control. In accordance with an aspect of the invention, the treatment material 140 may include a bjood coagulant to provide additional control of bleeding. Exemplary coagulants include Chitosan, Fibrinogen and Thrombin.<br>
In keeping with the invention, the elastic bandage 110 may also include fasteners or brakes 160 provided on at least one surface. The fasteners 160 are provided to assist with application of the bandage 110 and to minimize the unintentional unraveling of the bandage 110 during application. The fasteners 160 also facilitate securing the bandage 110 during final-packaging. The fasteners 160 may include a variety of suitable fasteners that are applied in a variety of configurations. For example, the fasteners 160 may include a plurality of spaced apart Velcro速 or adhesive strips 160, as shown in FIG. 1. The fasteners 160 may be disposed on the bandage 110 onfy, on the receptacle 120 only, or on both the bandage 110 and receptacle 120. Each fastener 160 may be spaced from adjacent fasteners 160 by a distance d, which distance can be up to several inches. Alternatively, the distance between fasteners 160 may vary. Also, see fasteners 160 in FIG. 4(a).<br>
 <br>
(n accordance with the present invention, the treatment material 140 and exit 150 may be variously configured. In the embodiment shown in FIG. 1, the receptacle 120 includes an exit 150 comprising a slit. The treatment material 140 is packaged in the receptacle 120 in an s-shaped configuration with the end of the treatment material140 abutting exit 150. The treatment material 140 may be pulled through the exit 150 by the caregiver during application. The treatment material 140 may be removed in an amount selected by the caregiver and used as needed, either to clean and/or pack the wound.<br>
In the configuration shown in FIG. 2(a), the receptacle 220 includes an exit 250 formed by an overlapping flap that extends over the width of the receptacle 220. The treatment material (not shown) is packaged inside the receptacle 220 and removed from the receptacle through the overlapping flap 250, as needed. Receptacle 220 may also include non-adherent pad 226 and a plastic layer 230.<br>

In another embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in FIG. 4(b), the integrated wound treatment system 400 includes a rolled elastic bandage 410 having a receptacle 420 disposed on the bandage. The receptacle 420 may be formed by folding the bandage 410 onto itself to create a pocket. The pocket may be formulated by, e.g., stitching the folded portion of the bandage as illustrated by stitches 470 while maintaining an opening 450 on at least one side. The pocket may be positioned adjacent a wound pad 426 disposed on the bandage 410. Treatment material, such as gauze and/or occlusive plastic sheeting, may be disposed inside the receptacle 420 to treat the wound.<br>
In another exemplary embodiment of the present invention, as illustrated in FIGs. 5(a)-(c), the integrated wound treatment system 500 includes a rolled* elastic bandage 510 and a sealed receptacle 520 having treatment material 540 packed inside, e.g. hemostatic gauze. The bandage 510 and receptacle 520 may embody many sizes and orientations, including a receptacle 520 that is separate and detached from the bandage 510, as shown in FIG. 5(a), a receptacle 520 having stitches 570 affixing it to the bandage 510, as shown in FIG. 5(b), or a receptacle 520 that is removably attached to the bandage 510, for example by Velcro速. The receptacle 520 may be made of a resilient material or gauze and may include removable gauze 540, removable occlusive plastic sheeting 530, and a closure flap or exit 550, as shown in FIG. 5(c).- The receptacle 520 is opened just prior to use and the hemostatic gauze 540 is removed from inside the receptacle 520 and applied, directly to "the wound. The receptacle 520 and/or occlusive plastic sheeting 530 may be optionally placed over the gauze 540 to provide an occlusion layer. The elastic bandage 510 is then placed over the wound area and the wound is wrapped. The elastic bandage 510 may be wrapped such that it provides the desired compression to the wound in order to assist in bleeding control.<br>
 <br>
The bandage may also include optional Velcro速 and/or adhesive strips 560 to assist in wrapping and securing the bandage 510, as shown in FIG. 5(b).<br>
To assist in providing compression to the wound, the wound treatment system may include a member, i.e. a structural element about which the bandage may 6e wrapped to increase pressure on the wound. FIGs. 6(a)-(d) illustrate exemplary embodiments of a pressure bar or member that may be used with the present invention. The pressure bar 600 is designed to have sufficient rigidity and may also have various surface shapes, including assorted protrusions and flat surfaces. The pressure bar 600 may be utilized along with the bandage 610 to apply an additional degree of pressure to the wound. This additional pressure is instrumental in providing extra control of bleeding at the wound site.<br>
The pressure bar 600, as shown in FIGs. 6(a)-(b), is made of a length of resilient material having a protrusion 620 in the form of an arcuate or curved surface. The pressure bar 600 may also include a brace 630 that extends the length of the protrusion. The brace 630 provides additional support and rigidity to the protrusion 620 and allows the pressure bar 600 to maintain its shape and effectively provide pressure to the wound. The pressure bar 600, as shown in FIGs. 6(c)-(d), may also have a protrusion 620 in the form of a bowl-Iike surface. This embodiment may optionally include a brace, not shown, that extends the length of the bowl-like surface. The pressure bar 600 is utilized by applying the surface of the pressure bar 600, particularly the protrusion 620, next to the wound or wound pad. The protrusion 620 of the pressure bar 600 is preferably applied to the wound pad in order to apply sufficient pressure to control bleeding. The bandage is then wrapped around the wound.<br>
The pressure bar 600 further includes flaps 640 for attaching the pressure bar 600 to the bandage. The flaps 640 may also include attachment means for attaching the pressure bar 600 to the bandage 610. These attachment means may include, for example, stitching, Velcro速, clips or other attachment means. The flaps 640 may also be made of a resilient material that provides additional support and rigidity to the pressure bar 600.<br>
When the wound dressing is applied to a would, it is often desirable to inspect the dressing to determine whether the wound is leaking. Continued wound leaking can lead to substantial blood loss if untreated, in accordance with an aspect of the invention, pressure bar 600 may be formed from a transparent or translucent material. This will allow the care giver to check the wound by sliding or peeling away the bandage and viewing the pressure bar.  if the wound is leaking, the care giver can readily see the<br>
<br>
 <br>
blood through pressure bar 600.   Accordingly, the care giver can check the wound without completely removing the wound dressing.<br>
