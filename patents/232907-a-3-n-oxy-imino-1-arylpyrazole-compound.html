				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a 3-(N-oxy-imino)-l-arylpyrazole compound. It relates to their unexpected and useful systemic insecticidal activity. The invention particularly pertains to compositions of said compounds and method, using said compounds, for the control of arthropod, nematode, helminth or protozoan pests. In particular to the application of said compounds or compositions in agricultural methods of use, particularly as pesticides, for controlling arthropods, especially insects by systemic action. The invention also relates to 1-arylpyrazole hydrazones.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
The control of insects nematodes or helminths by means of active material having a 1-arylpyrazole group therein has been described by many patents or patent application such as International Patent Publication No. WO 93/06089 (and the equivalent U.S. Patent No. 5,451,598),WO 94/21606 and WO 87/03781 as well as in European Patent Publication Numbers 0295117, 659745, 679650, 201852 and 412849, German Patent No. DE 19511269 and U.S. Patent No. 5,232,940. Other compounds are disclosed in WO 92/13451, 20 August 1992, to Schering Agrochemicals Ltd., which describes 5-chloro-l-[2,6-dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-4-(4,5-dicyano-lH-imidazol-2-yl)-3-hydroxyiminomethyl lH-pyrazole as an intermediate, also with activity against a single species Lucilia, sericata, sleep blow fly. This Schering reference appears to be the only reference describing 1-arylpyrazole-oxime compounds as insecticides. It is an object of the present invention to provide new pesticidal compounds of the 1-arylpyrazole family together with processes for their preparation. A second object of the present invention is to provide pesticidal compositions and pesticidal methods of use of the pesticidal pyrazole compounds against arthropods especially insects, plant nematodes, or helminth or protozoan pests,<br><br><br>
particularly in agricultural or horticultural crops, forestry, veterinary medicine or livestock husbandry, or in public health.<br>
A third object of the present invention is to provide very active compounds, with broad spectrum pesticidal activity, as well as compounds with selective special activity, e.g.. aphicidal. miticidal. foliar insecticidal. soil insecticidal and nematicidal. systemic, antifeeding or pesticidal activity via seed treatment.<br>
A fourth object of the present invention is to provide compounds with substantially enhanced and more rapid activity, especially against insects and more particularly insects in their larval stages.<br>
A fifth object of the present invention is to provide compounds with greatly improved (greater and faster) penetration into pest species when topically applied and thus provide enhanced movement of the compounds to the pesticidal site(s) of action within the pest.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide compounds with high activity and improved safety to the user and the environment.<br>
These and other objects of the invention shall become readily apparent from the detailed description of the present invention.  These objects are met in whole or in part by the instant invention.<br>

MITICIDE. INSECTICIDE. APHICIDE. AND NEMATICIDE USE<br>
The following representative test procedures, using compounds of the<br>
invention, were conducted to determine the pesticidal use and activity of compounds<br>
of the invention against: mites: certain insects, including aphids. two species of<br>
caterpillar, a fly. and three species of beetle larvae (one foliar feeding and two root<br>
feeding): and nematodes. The specific species tested were as follows:<br>
GENUS. SPECIES COMMON NAME (ABBREVIATION)<br>
Tetranychus urticae twospotted spider mite TSM<br>
Aphis nasiurtii buckthorn aphid BA<br>
Spodoptera eridania southern armyworm SAW<br>
Epiiachna variveti Mexican bean beetle MBB<br>
Musca domestics housefly HF<br>
Diabrotica u. howardi southern corn rootworm SCRW<br>
Diabrotica virgifera western corn rootworm WCRW<br>
Meloidogyne incognita southern root-knot nematode SRKN<br>
Aphis gossypii cotton aphid CA<br>
Schizaphis graminum greenbug (aphid) GB<br>
Heliothis virescens tobacco budworm TBW<br>
Foimulations:<br>
The test compounds were formulated for use according to the following<br>
methods used for each of the test procedures.<br>
For mite, aphid, southern armyworrn. Mexican bean beetle, and tobacco<br>
budworm tests, a solution or suspension was prepared by adding 10 mg of the test<br>
compound to a solution of 160 mg of dimethylformamide. 838 mg of acetone. 2 mg of<br>
a 3:1 ratio of Triton X-172 : Triton X-152 (respectively, mainly anionic and nonionic<br>
low foam emulsifiers which are each anhydrous blends of alkylaryl polyether alcohols<br>
with organic sulfonates). and 98.99 g of water. The result was a concentration of 100<br>
ppm of the test compound.<br>
For housefly tests, the formulation was initially prepared in a similar manner<br>
to the above, but in 16.3 g of water with corresponding adjustment of other<br>
components, providing a 200 ppm concentration. Final dilution with an equal volume<br>
of a 20° o by weight aqueous solution of sucrose provided a 100 ppm concentration of<br>
the test compound. When necessary, sonication was provided to insure complete<br>
dispersion.<br>
For southern and western corn rootworm tests, a solution or suspension was<br>
prepared in the same manner as that used for the initial 200 ppm concentration for<br>
housefly. Aliquots of this 200 ppm formulation were then used by dilution with water<br>
according to the required test concentration.<br>
For southern root-knot nematode and systemic tests for southern armyworrn.<br>
cotton aphid, tobacco budworm and greenbug. a stock solution or suspension was<br>
prepared by adding 15 mg of the test compound to 250 mg of dimethylformamide.<br>
1250 mg of acetone and 3 mg of the emulsifier blend referenced above. Water was<br>
then added to provide a test compound concentration of 150 ppm. When necessary,<br>
sonication was provided to insure complete dispersion.<br>
For tobacco buduorm contact tests, a stock solution was prepared by<br>
dissolving the compound in acetone and then further diluted to pro\ ide the required<br>
serial dilution concentrations.<br>
Test Procedures:<br>
The above formulated test compounds were then evaluated for their pesiicidal<br>
activity at the specified concentrations, in ppm (parts per million) by weight,<br>
according to the following test procedures:<br>
Twospotted spider mite: Leaves infested with adult and nymphal stages of the<br>
two-spotted spider mite, obtained from a stock culture were placed on the primary<br>
leaves of two bean plants growing in a 6 cm. peat pot. A sufficient number of mites<br>
(150-200) for testing were transferred to the fresh plants within a period of twentyfour<br>
hours. The potted plants (one pot per compound) were placed on a revolving<br>
turntable and sprayed, sufficient to wet the plants to runoff, with 100 ml of the 100<br>
ppm test compound formulation by use of a DeYilbiss spray gun set at 40 psig. air<br>
pressure. As an untreated control. 100 ml of the \vater-acetone-DMF-emulsifier<br>
solution, containing no test compound, were also sprayed on infested plants. A<br>
treated control with a commercial technical compound, either dicofol or hexythiazox.<br>
formulated in the same manner, was tested as a standard. The sprayed plants were<br>
held for six days, after which a mortality count of motile forms was made.<br>
Twospotted spider mite fovicide t e s t ) : Eggs were obtained from adults of the<br>
twospotted spider mite from a stock culture. Heavily infested leaves from the stock<br>
culture were placed on uninfested bean plants. Females were allowed to oviposit for a<br>
period of about 24 hours, after which the leaves of the plant were dipped into a<br>
solution of TEPP (tetraethyl diphosphate) in order to kill the motile forms and prevent<br>
additional egg laying. This dipping procedure, which was repeated after the plants<br>
dried, did not affect the viability of the eggs. The potted plants (one pot per<br>
compound) were placed on a revolving turntable and sprayed, sufficient to wet the<br>
plants to runoff, with 100 ml of the 100 ppm test compound formulation by use of a<br>
DeVilbiss spray gun set at 40 psig. air pressure. As an untreated control. 100 ml of<br>
the water-acetone-DMF-emulsifier solution, containing no test compound, were also<br>
sprayed on infested plants. A treated control with a commercial technical compound.<br>
typically demeton. formulated in the same manner, was tested as a standard. The<br>
sprayed plants were held for seven days, after which a mortality count of egg forms<br>
was made along with notations on residual activity on hatched larvae.<br>
Buckthorn or cotton aphid: Adult and nymphal stages of buckthorn or cotton<br>
aphid were reared on potted dwarf nasturtium or cotton plants, respectively. The<br>
potted plants tone pot per compound tested) infested with 100-150 aphids. were<br>
placed on a revolving turntable and sprayed with 100 ml of the 100 ppm test<br>
compound formulation by use of a DeYilbiss spray gun set at 40 psig air pressure. As<br>
an untreated control. 100 ml of a water-acetone-DMF-emulsifier solution, containing<br>
no test compound, were also sprayed on infested plants. A treated control with a<br>
commercial technical compound, malathion or cyhalothrin. formulated in the same<br>
manner, was tested as a standard. After spraying, the pots were stored for one day on<br>
buckthorn aphid or three days for cotton aphid, after which the dead aphids were<br>
counted.<br>
Southern armvworm: Potted bean plants, were placed on a revolving turntable<br>
and sprayed with 100 ml of the 100 ppm test compound formulation by use of a<br>
DeYilbiss spray gun set at 40 psig air pressure. As an untreated control. 100 ml of a<br>
water-acetone-DMF-emulsifier solution, containing no test compound, were also<br>
sprayed on plants. A treated control with a commercial technical compound, either<br>
cypermethrin or sulprofos. formulated in the same manner, was tested as a standard.<br>
\Vhen dry. the leaves were placed in plastic cups lined with moistened filter paper.<br>
Five randomly selected second instar southern armyworm larvae were introduced into<br>
each cup which was closed and held for five days. Larvae which were unable to move<br>
the length of the body, even upon stimulation by prodding, were considered dead.<br>
Tobacco bud worm: Potted cotton plants were placed on a revolving turntable<br>
and sprayed with 100 ml of the 100 ppm test compound formulation by use of a<br>
DeYilbiss spray gun set at 40 psig air pressure. As an untreated control. 100 ml of a<br>
water-acetone-DMF-emulsifier solution, containing no test compound, were also<br>
sprayed on plants. A treated control with a commercial technical compound, either<br>
cypermethrin or sulprofos. formulated in the same manner, was tested as a standard.<br>
When dry. the leaves were placed in plastic dishes containing a piece of filter paper<br>
and a moistened dental wick. One randomly selected second instar tobacco budworm<br>
larva was then introduced into each cup which was closed and held for five days.<br>
Larvae unable to move the length of their body, even upon stimulation by prodding,<br>
were considered dead.<br>
Mexican bean beetle: Potted bean plants were placed on a revolving turntable<br>
and sprayed with 100 ml of the 100 ppm test compound formulation, sufficient to wet<br>
the plants to runoff, by use of a DeYilbiss spray gun set at 40 psig air pressure. As an<br>
untreated control. 100 ml of a water-acetone-DMF-emulsifier solution, containing no<br>
test compound, were also sprayed on plants. A treated control with a commercial<br>
technical compound, either cypermethrin or sulprofos. formulated in the same<br>
manner, was tested as a standard When dry. the leaves were placed in plastic cups<br>
lined with moistened filter paper. Five randomly selected second instar Mexican bean<br>
beetle larvae were introduced into each cup which was closed and held for five days.<br>
Larvae which were unable to move the length of the body, even upon stimulation by<br>
prodding, were considered dead.<br>
House fly: Four to six day old adult house flies were reared according to the<br>
specifications of the Chemical Specialties Manufacturing Association (Blue Book.<br>
McN'air-Dorland Co.. N.Y. 1954: pages 243-244. 261) under controlled conditions.<br>
The flies were immobilized by anesthetizing with carbon dioxide and twenty five<br>
immobilized individuals, males and females, were transferred to a cage consisting of a<br>
standard food strainer and a wrapping-paper-covered surface. Ten ml of the 100 ppm<br>
test compound formulation were added to a souffle cup containing an absorbent cotton<br>
pad. As an untreated control. 10 ml of a \vater-acetone-DMF-emulsiller-sucrose<br>
solution, containing no test compound, were applied in a similar manner. A treated<br>
control with a commercial technical compound, malathion. formulated in the same<br>
manner, was tested as a standard. The bait cup was introduced inside the food strainer<br>
prior to admitting the anesthetized flies. After 24 hours, flies which showed no sign<br>
of movement on stimulation were considered dead.<br>
Southern or western corn rootworm: Into a jar containing 60g of sandy loam<br>
soil was added 1.5 ml of an aqueous formulation consisting of an aliquot of the 200<br>
ppm test compound formulation, diluted with water as appropriate for the final soil<br>
concentration of the test compound. 3.2 ml of water and five pregerminated corn<br>
seedlings. The jar was shaken thoroughly to obtain an even distribution of the test<br>
formulation. Following this, twenty corn rootworm eggs (or optionally ten first instar<br>
larvae in the case of \VCR\V) were placed into a cavity, which was made in the soil.<br>
Vermiculite (1 ml), used optionally in the case of WCRW tests, and water (1.7ml)<br>
were then added to this cavity. In a similar manner, an untreated control was prepared<br>
by application of the same size aliquot of a water-acetone-DMF-emulsifier solution,<br>
containing no test compound. Additionally, a treated control with a commercial<br>
technical compound (selected typically from terbufos. fonofos. phorate. chlorpyrifos.<br>
carbofuran. isazophos. or ethoprop). formulated in the same manner was used as<br>
needed as a test standard. After 7 days, the living rootworm larvae were counted<br>
using a well known "Berlese" funnel extraction method.<br>
Southern root-knot nematode: Infected roots of tomato plants, containing egg<br>
masses of southern root-knot nematode. were removed from a stock culture and<br>
cleaned of soil by shaking and washing with tap water. The nematode eggs \vere<br>
separated from the root tissue and rinsed with water. Samples of the egg suspension<br>
were placed on a fine screen over a receiving bowl, in which the water level was<br>
-54 -<br>
adjusted to be in contact with the screen. From the bowl, juveniles were collected on<br>
a fine screen. The bottom of a cone-shaped container was plugged with coarse<br>
vermiculite and then filled to .within 1.5 cm of the top with about a 200 ml volume of<br>
pasteurized soil. Then into a hole made in the center of the soil in the cone was<br>
pipetted an aliquot of the 150 ppm test compound formulation. A treated control with<br>
a commerical technical compound, fenamifos. formulated in a similar manner, was<br>
tested as a standard. As an untreated control, an aliquot of a water-acetone-DMFemulsifier<br>
solution, containing no test compound, was applied in a similar manner.<br>
Immediately after treatment of the soil with the test compound there were added to the<br>
top of each cone 1000 second stage juvenile southern root-knot nematodes. After 3<br>
days, a single healthy tomato seedling was then transplanted into the cone. The cone,<br>
containing the infested soil and tomato seedling, was kept in the greenhouse for 3<br>
weeks. At the termination of the test, roots of the tomato seedling were removed from<br>
the cone and evaluated for galling on a rating scale relative to the untreated control as<br>
follows:<br>
1- severe galling, equal to untreated control<br>
3- light galling<br>
4- very light galling<br>
5- no galling, ie. complete control<br>
These results were then converted to an ED} or EDf value (effective dose to<br>
provide a 3 or 5 gall rating).<br>
Southern armyworm on tomato - systemic evaluation: This test was conducted<br>
in conjunction with the southern root-knot nematode evaluation (discussed below).<br>
The tomato plants, grown in the soil (at an initial compound test screening rate of 6.6<br>
ppm soil concentration or about 150 ppm solution concentration) for nematode<br>
evaluation, were then utilized for evaluation of a compound's uptake via roots and<br>
subsequent systemic transport to the tomato foliage. At the termination of the<br>
nematode test. 21 days after treatment, the tomato foliage was excised, placed into a<br>
plastic container, and infested with second instar larvae of southern armyworm. After<br>
about 5 days, the larvae were examined for percent mortality.<br>
Cotton aphid and tobacco budworm (on cotton') and greenbug and tobacco<br>
budworm (on sorghum) - systemic evaluation: A 7.0 ml aliquot of the 150 ppm<br>
nematode test solution was applied to deliver the equivalent of 10.0 ppm soil<br>
concentration dose as a drench to 6 cm pots containing cotton and sorghum plants.<br>
The cotton plants were previously infested with cotton aphids about two days before<br>
treatment and greenbug one day before treatment. After holding the plants about three<br>
days, the plants were rated for aphid activity. Again at six days, the plants were rated<br>
tor aphid activity and the cotton aphids and greenbugs were counted and mortality<br>
as assessed. Portions of the cotton and sorghum foliage were excised, placed in<br>
separate plastic containers, and infested with second instar larvae of lobacco<br>
budworm. The potted plants were dipped in sulfotepp to kill the remaining aphids and<br>
returned to the greenhouse for regrowth. Thirteen days after treatment, the remaining<br>
foliage was excised and fed to tobacco budworms. Mortality was assessed six days<br>
after infestation.<br>
Cotton aphid and southern armywoim (on cotton) and greenbug and southern<br>
army worm 'on sorghurrn - systemic evaluation: A stock solution or suspension was<br>
prepared to deliver 5 ml of a 20 ppm soil concentration dose (and subsequent<br>
dilutions) as a drench to 6 cm pots containing cotton and sorghum plants. The cotton<br>
plants were previously infested with cotton aphids about two days before treatment<br>
and greenbug one day before treatment. After holding the plants about three days, the<br>
plants were rated for aphid activity. Again at six days, the plants were rated for aphid<br>
activity and the cotton aphids and greenbugs were counted and mortality was<br>
assessed. Portions of the cotton and sorghum foliage were excised, placed in separate<br>
plastic containers, and infested with second instar larvae of southern armyworms. The<br>
potted plants were dipped in sulfotepp to kill the remaining aphids and returned to the<br>
greenhouse for regrowth. Thirteen days after treatment the remaining foliage was<br>
excised and fed to southern armyworm. Mortality was assessed six days after<br>
infestation.<br>
Cotton aphid and southern armyworm (on cotton and oats^ - seed treatment<br>
evaluation: Technical material was applied to the seed of oats and cotton by placing<br>
the compound and the seed in an appropriate sized jar and rolling the jar on a ball<br>
mill. Assay of the material applied to the seed was by weight. Seed was then planted.<br>
When germinated and emerged, the plants were infested at the appropriate intervals<br>
with host insects. Mortality was assessed on those insects.<br>
Tobacco budworm • contact evaluation: The following topical application<br>
method provides an assessment of contact toxicity of a compound to tobacco<br>
budworm larvae. The test compound solution at sequential two-fold dilution<br>
concentrations from 10 down to 0.16 ug'ul was applied by a microinjector in<br>
replicated 1 ul portions to the dorsum of approximately 20 mg tobacco budworm<br>
larvae. This is equivalent to applied doses of 500 down to 8 ug'g body weight. An<br>
acetone treated control, without any test compounds, was also applied. A treated<br>
control with a commercial technical compound, cypermethrin or thiodicarb. also in<br>
acetone was used as a standard. The treated larvae were placed, individually, in<br>
separate plastic petri dishes containing an untreated cotton leaf and a moist dental<br>

or to be planted or to the seeds or growing plant roots.<br>
In the area of public health, the arylpyrazoles are especially useful in the<br>
control of many insects, especially filth flies or other Dipteran pests, such as<br>
houseflies. stableflies. soldierflies. homilies, deerflies. horseflies, midges, punkies.<br>
blackflies. or mosquitoes.<br>

In practical use for the control of arthropods, especially insects or mites, or<br>
nematode pests of plants, a method, for example, comprises applying to the plants or<br>
to the medium in which they grow an effective amount of a arylpyrazole of the<br>
invention. For such a method, the active arylpyrazole is generally applied to the locus<br>
in which the arthropod or nematode infestation is to be controlled at an effective rate<br>
in the range of about 5 g to about 1 kg of the active arylpyrazole per hectare of locus<br>
treated. Under ideal conditions, depending on the pest to be controlled, a lower rate<br>
may offer adequate protection. On the other hand, adverse weather conditions,<br>
resistance of the pest or other factors may require that the active ingredient be used at<br>
higher rates. The optimum rate depends usually upon a number of factors, for<br>
example, the type of pest being controlled, the type or the growth stage of the infested<br>
plant, the row spacing or also the method of application. More preferably an effective<br>
rate range of the active arylpyrazole is from about 50g Tia to about 400 g;ha.<br>
When a pest is soil-borne, the active arylpyrazole generally in a formulated<br>
composition, is distributed evenly over the area to be treated t ie. for example<br>
broadcast or band treatment) in any convenient manner and is applied a: rates from<br>
about 5 to about 1kg ai ha. preferably from about 50 to about 250 g ai ha. When<br>
applied as a root dip to seedlings or drip irrigation to plants the liquid solution or<br>
suspension contains from about 0.075 to about 1000 mg ai 1. preferably from about 25<br>
to about 200 mg ai 1. Application may be made, if desired, to the field or cropgrowing<br>
area generally or in close proximity to the seed or plant to be protected from<br>
attack. The active component can be washed into the soil by spraying with water over<br>
the area or can be left to the natural action of rainfall. During or after application, the<br>
formulated arylpyrazole can. if desired, be distributed mechanically in the soil, for<br>
example by ploughing, disking, or use of drag chains. Application can be prior to<br>
planting, at planting, after planting but before sprouting has taken place, or after<br>
sprouting.<br>
The arylpyrazoles of the invention and methods of control of pests therewith<br>
are of particular value in the protection of field, forage, plantation, glasshouse,<br>
orchard or vineyard crops, of ornamentals, or of plantation or forest trees, for<br>
example: cereals (such as wheat or rice), cotton, vegetables (such as peppers), field<br>
crops (such as sugar beets, soybeans or oil seed rape), grassland or forage crops (such<br>
as maize or sorghum), orchards or groves (such as of stone or pit fruit or citrus).<br>
ornamental plants, flowers or vegetables or shrubs under glass or in gardens or parks,<br>
or forest trees (both deciduous and evergreen) in forests, plantations or nurseries.<br>
They are also valuable in the protection of timber (standing, felled, converted.<br>
stored or structural) from attack, for example, by sawflies or beetles or termites.<br>
They have applications in the protection of stored products such as grains,<br>
fruits, nuts, spices or tobacco, whether whole, milled or arylpyrazoleed into products,<br>
from moth, beetle, mite or grain weevil attack. Also protected are stored animal<br>
products such as skins, hair, wool or feathers in natural or converted form (e.g. as<br>
carpets or textiles) from moth or beetle attack as well as stored meat, fish or grains<br>
from beetle, mite or fly attack.<br>
Additionally, the arylpyrazoles of the invention and methods of use thereof are<br>
of particular value in the control of arthropods, helminths or protozoa which are<br>
injurious to. or spread or act as vectors of diseases domestic animals, for example<br>
those hereinbefore mentioned, and more especially in the control of ticks, mites, lice.<br>
fleas, midges, or biting, nuisance or myiasis flies. The arylpyrazoles of the invention<br>
are particularly useful in controlling arthropods, helminths or protozoa which are<br>
present inside domestic host animals or which feed in or on the skin or suck the blood<br>
or the animal, for which purpose they may be administered orally. parenterally.<br>
percutaneously or topically.<br>
Furthermore, arylpyrazoles of the invention may be useful for coccidiosis. a<br>
disease caused by infections from protozoan parasites of the genus Eimeria. It is an<br>
important potential cause of economic loss in domestic animals and birds, particularly.<br>
those raised or kept under intensive conditions. For example, cattle, sheep, pigs or<br>
rabbits may be affected, but the disease is especially important in poultry, particularly<br>
in chickens. Administration of a small amount of a arylpyrazole of the invention.<br>
preferably by a combination with feed is effective in preventing or greatly reducing<br>
the incidence of coccidiosis. The arylpyrazoles are effective against both the cecal<br>
form and the intestinal forms. Furthermore, the arylpyrazoles of the invention may<br>
also exert an inhibiting effect on oocytes by greatly reducing the number and<br>
sporulation of those produced. The poultry disease is generally spread by the birds<br>
picking up the infectious organism in droppings in or on contaminated litter, ground.<br>
food, or drinking water. The disease is manifested by hemorrhage, accumulation of<br>
blood in the ceca. passage of blood to the droppings, weakness and digestive<br>
disturbances. The disease often terminates in the death of the animal, but the fowl<br>
which survive severe infections have had their market value subtantiallv reduced as a<br>
result of the infection.<br>
The compositions hereinafter described for application to growing crops or<br>
crop growing loci or as a seed dressing may. in general, alternatively be employed for<br>
topical application to animals or in the protection of stored products, household<br>
goods, property or areas of the general environment. Suitable means of applying the<br>
arylpyrazoles of the invention include:<br>
to growing crops as foliar sprays, dusts, granules, fogs or foams or also as<br>
suspensions of finely divided or encapsulated compositions as soil or root treatments<br>
by liquid drenches, dusts, granules, smokes or foams: to seeds of crops via application<br>
as seed dressings by liquid slurries or dusts:<br>
to animals infested by or exposed to infestation by arthropods, helminths or<br>
protozoa, by parenteral. oral or topical application of compositions in which the active<br>
ingredient exhibits an immediate and. or prolonged action over a period of time against<br>
the arthropods, helminths or protozoa, for example by incorporation in feed or suitable<br>
orally-ingestible pharmaceutical formulations, edible baits, salt licks, dietary<br>
supplements, pour-on formulations, sprays, baths, dips, showers, jets, dusts, greases,<br>
shampoos, creams, wax smears or livestock self-treatment systems;<br>
to the environment in general or to specific locations where pests may lurk.<br>
including stored products, timber, household goods, or domestic or industrial<br>
premises, as sprays, fogs, dusts, smokes, wax-smears, lacquers, granules or baits, or in<br>
tricklefeeds to waterways, wells, reservoirs or other running or standing water:<br>
to domestic animals in feed to control fly larvae feeding in their feces:<br>
In practice, the arylpyrazoles of the invention most frequently form pans of<br>
compositions. These compositions can be employed to control: arthopods. especially<br>
insects or mites: nematodes: or helminth or protozoan pests. The compositions may<br>
be of any type known in the an suitable for application to the desired pest in any<br>
premises or indoor or outdoor area or by internal or external administration to<br>
vertebrates. These compositions contain at least one arylpyrazole of formula (I) or a<br>
pesticidally acceptable salt thereof, such as described earlier, as the active ingredient<br>
in combination or association with one or more other compatible components which<br>
are for example, solid or liquid carriers or diluents, adjuvants, surface-active-agents,<br>
or the like appropriate for the intended use and which are agronomically or<br>
medicinally acceptable. These compositions, which may be prepared by any manner<br>
known in the an. likewise form a pan of this invention.<br>
These compositions may also contain other kinds of ingredients such as<br>
protective colloids, adhesives. thickeners, thixotropic agents, penetrating agents, sprayoils<br>
(especially for acaridical use), stabilizers, preservative agents (especially mold<br>
preservatives), sequestering agents, or the like, as well as other known active<br>
ingredients with pesticidal propenies (particularly insecticidal. miticidal. nematicidal.<br>
or fungicidal) or with propenies regulating the growth of plants. More generally, the<br>
arylpyrazoles employed in the invention may be combined with all the solid or liquid<br>
additives corresponding to the usual techniques of formulation.<br>
Compositions, suitable for applications in agriculture, horticulture, or the like<br>
include formulations suitable for use as. for example, sprays, dusts, granules, fogs.<br>
foams, emulsions, or the like.<br>
The effective use doses of the arylpyrazoles employed in the invention can<br>
vary within wide limits, particularly depending on the nature of the pest to be<br>
eliminated or degree of infestation, for example, of crops with these pests. In general.<br>
the compositions according to the invention usually contain about 0.05 to about 95%<br>
(by weight) of one or more active ingredients according to the invention, about 1 to<br>
about 95% of one or more solid or liquid carriers and. optionally, about 0.1 to about<br>
50% of one or more other compatible components, such as surface-active agents or<br>
the like.<br>
In the present account, the term "carrier" denotes an organic or inorganic<br>
ingredient, natural or synthetic, with which the active ingredient is combined to<br>
facilitate its application, for example, to the plant, to seeds or to the soil. This carrier<br>
is therefore generally inert and it must be acceptable (for example, agronomically<br>
acceptable, particularly to the treated plant).<br>
The carrier may be a solid, for example, clays, natural or synthetic silicates,<br>
silica, resins, waxes, solid fertilizers (for example ammonium salts), ground natural<br>
minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite. montmorillonite.<br>
bentonite or diatomaceous earth, or ground synthetic minerals, such as silica, alumina,<br>
or silicates especially aluminium or magnesium silicates. As solid carriers for<br>
granules the following are suitable: crushed or fractionated natural rocks such as<br>
calcite. marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite: synthetic granules of inorganic or<br>
organic meals: granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, corn<br>
cobs, com husks or tobacco stalks: kieselguhr. tricalcium phosphate, powdered cork,<br>
or absorbent carbon black: water soluble polymers, resins, waxes: or solid fertilizers.<br>
Such solid compositions may. if desired, contain one or more compatible wetting.<br>
dispersing, emulsifying or colouring agents which, when solid, may also serve as a<br>
diluent.<br>
The carrier may also be liquid, for example: water: alcohols, particularly<br>
butanol or glycol. as well as their ethers or esters, particularly methylglycol acetate:<br>
ketones. particularly acetone, cyclohexanone. methylethyl ketone.<br>
methylisobutylketone. or isophorone: petroleum fractions such as paraffmic or<br>
aromatic hydrocarbons, particularly xylenes or alkyl naphthalenes: mineral or<br>
vegetable oils: aliphatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly trichloroethane or<br>
methylene chloride: aromatic chlorinated hydrocarbons, particularly chlorobenzenes:<br>
water-soluble or strongly polar solvents such as dimethylformamide. dimethyl<br>
sulphoxide. or X-methylpyrrolidone: liquefied gases: or the like or a mixture thereof.<br>
The surface-active agent may be an emulsifying agent, dispersing agent or<br>
wetting agent of the ionic or non-ionic type or a mixture of such surface-active agents.<br>
Amongst these are e.g.. salts of polyacrylic acids, salts of lignosulphonic acids, salts<br>
of phenolsulphonic or naphthalenesulphonic acids, polycondensates of ethylene oxide<br>
with fatty alcohols or fatty acids or fatty esters or fatty amines, substituted phenols<br>
(particularly alkylphenols or arylphenols). salts of sulphosuccinic acid esters, taurine<br>
derivatives (particularly alkyltaurates). phosphoric esters of alcohols or of<br>
polycondensates of ethylene oxide with phenols, esters of fatty acids with polyols. or<br>
sulphate, sulphonate or phosphate functional derivatives of the above arylpyrazoles.<br>
The presence of at least one surface-active agent is generally essential when the active<br>
ingredient and'or the inert carrier are only slightly water soluble or are not water<br>
soluble and the carrier agent of the composition for application is water.<br>
Compositions of the invention may further contain other additives such as<br>
adhesives or colorants. Adhesives such as carboxymethylceilulose or natural or<br>
synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or lattices, such as arabic gum.<br>
polyvinyl alcohol or polyvinyl acetate, natural phospholipids. such as cephalins or<br>
lecithins, or synthetic phospholipids can be used in the formulations. It is possible to<br>
use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example: iron oxides, titanium oxides or<br>
Prussian Blue: organic dyestuffs. such as alizarin dyestuffs. azo dyestuffs or metal<br>
phthalocyanine dyestuffs: or trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron.<br>
copper, cobalt, molybdenum or zinc.<br>
Compositions containing arylpyrazoles of formula (I), or pesticidally<br>
acceptable salts thereof, which may be applied to control arthropod, plant nematode.<br>
helminth or protozoan pests, may also contain synergists (e.g. piperonyl butoxide or<br>
sesamex). stabilizing substances, other insecticides, acaricides. plant nematocides.<br>
anthelmintics or anticoccidials. fungicides (agricultural or veterinary as appropriate,<br>
e.g. benomyl and iprodione). bactericides. arthropod or vertebrate attractants or<br>
repellents or pheromones. deodorants, flavouring agents, dyes, or auxiliary therapeutic<br>
agents, e.g. trace elements. These may be designed to improve potency, persistence.<br>
safety, uptake where desired, spectrum of pests controlled or to enable the<br>
composition to perform other useful functions in the same animal or area treated.<br>
Examples of other pesticidally-active arylpyrazoles which may be included in.<br>
or used in conjunction with the compositions of the present invention are: acephate.<br>
chlorpyrifos. demeton-S-methyl. disulfoton. ethoprofos. fenitrothion. fenamiphos.<br>
fonofos. isazophos. isofenphos. malathion. monocrotophos. parathion. phorate,<br>
phosalone. pirimiphos-methyl. terbufos. triazophos. cyfluthrin. cypermethrin,<br>
deltamethrin. fenpropathrin. fenvalerate. permethrin. tefluthrin. aldicarb. carbosulfan.<br>
methomyl. oxamyl. pirimicarb. bendiocarb. teflubenzuron. dicofol. endosulfan.<br>
lindane. benzoximate. cartap. cyhexatin. tetradifon. avermectins. ivermectins,<br>
milbemycins. thiophanate, trichlorfon. dichlorvos. diaveridine or dimetriadazole.<br>
For their agricultural application, the arylpyrazoles of the formula (I), or<br>
pesticidally acceptable salts thereof, are therefore generally in the form of<br>
compositions, which are in various solid or liquid forms.<br>
Solid forms of compositions which can be used are dusting powders (with a<br>
content of the arylpyrazole of formula (I), or a pesticidally acceptable salt thereof,<br>
ranging up to 80%). wettable powders or granules (including water dispersible<br>
granules), particularly those obtained by extrusion, compacting, impregnation of a<br>
granular carrier, or granulation starting from a powder (the content of the arylpyrazole<br>
of formula (I), or a pesticidally acceptable salt thereof, in these wettable powders or<br>
granules being bemeen about 0.5 and about 80%). Solid homogenous or<br>
heterogenous compositions containing one or more arylpyrazoles of formula ( I ) , or<br>
pesticidally acceptable salts thereof, for example granules, pellets, briquettes or<br>
capsules, may be used to treat standing or running water over a period of time. A<br>
similar effect may be achieved using trickle or intermittent feeds of water dispersible<br>
concentrates as described herein.<br>
Liquid compositions, for example, include aqueous or non-aqueous solutions<br>
or suspensions (such as emulsifiable concentrates, emulsions, flowables. dispersions,<br>
or solutions) or aerosols. Liquid compositions also include, in particular, emulsifiable<br>
concentrates, dispersions, emulsions, flowables. aerosols, wertable powders (or<br>
powder for spraying), dry flowables or pastes as forms of compositions which are<br>
liquid or intended to form liquid compositions when applied, for example as aqueous<br>
sprays (including low and ultra-low volume) or as fogs or aerosols.<br>
Liquid compositions, for example, in the form of emulsifiable or soluble<br>
concentrates most frequently comprise about 5 to about 80° o by weight of the active<br>
ingredient, while the emulsions or solutions which are ready for application contain.<br>
in their case, about 0.01 to about 20% of the active ingredient. Besides the solvent.<br>
the emulsifiable or soluble concentrates may contain, when required, about 2 to about<br>
50° o of suitable additives, such as stabilizers, surface-active agents, penetrating<br>
agents, corrosion inhibitors, colorants or adhesives. Emulsions of any required<br>
concentration, which are particularly suitable for application, for example, to plants.<br>
may be obtained from these concentrates by dilution with water. These compositions<br>
are included within the scope of the compositions which may be employed in the<br>
present invention. The emulsions may be in the form of water-in-oil or oil-in-water<br>
type and they may have a thick consistency.<br>
The liquid compositions of this invention may. in addition to normal<br>
agricultural use applications be used for example to treat substrates or sites infested or<br>
liable to infestation by arthropods (or other pests controlled by arylpyrazoles of this<br>
invention) including premises, outdoor or indoor storage of processing areas,<br>
containers or equipment or standing or running water.<br>
All these aqueous dispersions or emulsions or spraying mixtures can be<br>
applied, for example, to crops by any suitable means, chiefly by spraying, at rates<br>
which are generally of the order of about 100 to about 1.200 liters of spraying mixture<br>
per hectare, but may be higher or lower (eg. low or ultra-low volume) depending upon<br>
the need or application technique. The arylpyrazoles or compositions according to the<br>
invention are conveniently applied to vegetation and in particular to roots or leaves<br>
having pests to be eliminated. Another method of application of the arylpyrazoles or<br>
compositions according to the invention is by chernigation. that is to say. the addition<br>
of a formulation containing the active ingredient to irrigation water. This irrigation<br>
may be sprinkler irrigation for foliar pesticides or it can be ground irrigation or<br>
underground irrigation for soil or for systemic pesticides.<br>
The concentrated suspensions, which can be applied by spraying, are prepared<br>
so as to produce a stable fluid product which does not settle (fine grinding) and<br>
usually contain from about 10 to about 75° b by weight of active ingredient, from<br>
about 0.5 to about 30% of surface-active agents, from about 0.1 to about 10% of<br>
thixotropic agents, from about 0 to about 30% of suitable additives, such as antifoaming<br>
agents, corrosion inhibitors, stabilizers, penetrating agents, adhesives and. as<br>
the carrier, water or an organic liquid in which the active ingredient is poorly soluble<br>
or insoluble Some organic solids or inorganic salts may be dissolved in the carrier to<br>
help prevent settling or as antifreezes for water.<br>
Thewettable powers (or powder for spraying) are usually prepared so that they<br>
contain from about 10 to about 80% by weight of active ingredient, from about 20 to<br>
about 90° o of a solid carrier, from about 0 to about 5% of a wetting agent, from about<br>
3 to about 10% of a dispersing agent and. when necessary, from about 0 to about 809 b<br>
of one or more stabilizers and or other additives, such as penetrating agents,<br>
adhesives. ami-caking agents, colorants, or the like. To obtain these wettable<br>
powders, the active ingredient! s) isiare) thoroughly mixed in a suitable blender with<br>
additional substances which may be impregnated on the porous filler and is(are)<br>
ground using a mill or other suitable grinder. This produces wettable powders, the<br>
wettability and the suspendability of which are advantageous. They may be<br>
suspended in water to give any desired concentration and this suspension can be<br>
employed very advantageously in particular for application to plant foliage.<br>
The "water dispersible granules (\VG)" (granules which are readily dispersible<br>
in water) have compositions which are substantially close to that of the wettable<br>
powders. They may be prepared by granulation of formulations described for the<br>
wettable powders, either by a wet route (contacting finely divided active ingredient<br>
with the inert filler and a little water, e.g. 1 to 20% by weight, or with an aqueous<br>
solution of a dispersing agent or binder, followed by drying and screening), or by a<br>
dry route (compacting followed by grinding and screening).<br>
The rates and concentrations of the formulated compositions may vary<br>
according to the method of application or the nature of the compositions or use<br>
thereof. Generally speaking, the compositions for application to control arthropod.<br>
plant nematode. helminth or protozoan pests usually contain from about 0.00001% to<br>
about 95%. more particularly from about 0.0005% to about 50% by weight of one or<br>
more aryIpyrazoles of formula ( I) . or pesticidally acceptable sa!:s thereof, or of total<br>
active ingredients (that is to say the arylpyrazole of formula (1). or a pesticidally<br>
acceptable salt thereof, together with: other substances toxic to arthropods or plant<br>
nematodes. anthelmintics. anticoccidials. synergists. trace elements or stabilizers I.<br>
The actual compositions employed and their rate of application will be selected to<br>
achieve the desired effect( s) by the farmer, livestock producer, medical or veterinary<br>
practitioner, pest control operator or other person skilled in the art.<br>
Solid or liquid compositions for application topically to animals, timber,<br>
stored products or household goods usually contain from about 0.00005% to about<br>
90%. more particularly from about 0.001% to about 10%. by weight of one or more<br>
arylpyrazoles of formula (I I or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof. For<br>
administration to animals orally or parenterally. including percutaneously solid or<br>
liquid compositions, these normally contain from about 0.1% to about 90% by weight<br>
of one or more arylpyrazoles of formula (I) or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Medicated feedstuffs normally contain from about 0.001% to about 3% by weight of<br>
one or more arylpyrazoles of formula ( I ) or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Concentrates or supplements for mixing with feedstuffs normally contain from about<br>
5% to about 90%. preferably from about 5% to about 50%. by weight of one or more<br>
arylpyrazoles of formula ( I ) or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof. Mineral salt licks<br>
normally contain from about 0.1% to about 10% by weight of one or more<br>
arylpyrazoles of formula (I i or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof.<br>
Dusts or liquid compositions for application to livestock, goods, premises or<br>
outdoor areas may contain from about 0.0001% to about 15%. more especially from<br>
about 0.005% to about 2.0%. by weight, of one or more arylpyrazoles of formula (I)<br>
or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof. Suitable concentrations in treated waters are<br>
between about 0.0001 ppm and about 20 ppm. more particularly about 0.001 ppm to<br>
about 5.0 ppm. of one or more arylpyrazoles of formula (I), or pesticidally acceptable<br>
salts thereof, and may be used therapeutically in fish farming with appropriate<br>
exposure times. Edible baits may contain from about 0.01% to about 5%. preferably<br>
from about 0.01% to about 1.0%. by weight, of one or more arylpyrazoles of formula<br>
(I) or pesticidally acceptable salts thereof.<br>
When administered to vertebrates parenterally. orally or by percutaneous or<br>
other means, the dosage of arylpyrazoles of formula (I), or pesticidally acceptable<br>
salts thereof, will depend upon the species, age. or health of the vertebrate and upon<br>
the nature and degree of its actual or potential infestation by arthropod, helminth or<br>
protozoan pests. A single dose of about 0.1 to about 100 mg. preferably about 2.0 to<br>
about 20.0 mg. per kg body weight of the animal or doses of about 0.01 to about 20.0<br>
mg. preferably about . 1 to about 5.0 mg. per kg body weight of the animal per day.<br>
for sustained medication, are generally suitable by oral or parerueral administration.<br>
