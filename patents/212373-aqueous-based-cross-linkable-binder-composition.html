AQUEOUS CROSS-LINKABLE BINDER COMPOSITION AND COATING, LACQUER. OR SEALING COMPOSITION: COMPRISING SUCH A BINDER COMPOSITION<br>
The invention relates to an aqueous-based cross-linkable binder composition comprising<br>
(A)	an aqueous dispersion of a polyester-polyacrylate hybrid resin 50 to 90 wt.% of which is composed of polyester and 10 to 50 wt.% of which is composed of polyacrylate, which hybrid resin is obtainable by grafting a composition of unsaturated monomers onto a partially unsaturated hydroxy-functional polyester resin, and<br>
(B)	an organic polyisocyanate, and<br>
to its use for the production of a coating, lacquer or sealing composition.<br>
Two-component aqueous-based binder compositions based on hydroxyl-functional polyester-polyacrylate hybrid resins and organic polyisocyanates are known from, int. al.f WO 97/19118 and WO 94/13720.<br>
WO 97/19118 discloses a water-dissipatable polymer comprising an at least partially unsaturated polyester having a molecular weight between 300 and 3,000, an OH number between 20 and 300, and an acid number 
WO 94/13720 discloses a polymer dispersion based on polyester and acrylate having a solids content of between 30 and 55% by weight which can be obtained by free-radical polymerisation of from 80 to 20% by weight of at least (a) one (meth)acryiic acid ester of mono- or polyalcohols wherein said esters can additionally contain free hydroxyl groups; and<br><br>
(b)	one ethylenically unsaturated, at least monofunctional acid; and optionally<br>
(c)	an ethylenically unsaturated monomer which is distinct from (a) and (b) or mixtures thereof,<br>
with from 20 to 80% by weight of a free-radical polymerisable polyester resin having from 0.2 to 1.5 polymerisable double bonds per molecule, obtainable by the polycondensation of at least divalent polyalcohols with at least divalent polycarboxylic acids or their derivatives in the presence of polyalcohols and/or polycarboxyiic acids containing at least one polymerisable double bond. However, if such polymer dispersions of aqueous organic polyester-acrylate polyols are combined with polyisocyanates, the presence of organic amines used for at least partially neutralising the carboxylic acids can catalyse the undesired reaction between water and isocyanate. This produces carbon dioxide, which can foam,, leading to undesirable effects, such as imperfections in a coating layer.<br>
Accordingly, a drawback to the known aqueous-based coating compositions is that either their pot life is open to improvement or they cause excessive foaming during spraying.<br>
The invention now provides aqueous-based binder compositions which do not detract from the performance due to excessive foaming and which have an acceptable pot life and cure speed, which compositions comprise aqueous polyester-polyacrylate hybrid dispersions having a solids content of more than 30% by weight at a viscosity of 0.1 to 5 Pa.s and an organic polyisocyanate.<br>
The invention provides aqueous-based cross-linkable binder compositions comprising (A) an aqueous dispersion of a polyester-polyacrylate hybrid resin 50 to 90 wt.% of which is composed of polyester and 10 to 50 wt.% of which is composed of polyacrylate, which hybrid resin is obtainable by grafting a composition of radically polymerisable unsaturated monomers onto a partially unsaturated hydroxy-functional polyester resin, and (B) an organic polyisocyanate, characterised in that the partially unsaturated hydroxy-functional polyester has a hydroxyl value of 50 to 350, a COOH value of at most<br><br>
10 mg KOH/g, and a number average molecular weight, optionally after chain extension with a polyisocyanate, of from 400 to 3,000, and is obtainable by reaction of a mixture of polycarboxylic and, optionally, monocarboxylic acids, at least 50 mole% of such poly- and/or monocarboxylic acids are aliphatic acids with 6-12 carbon atoms, with one or more (cyclo)aliphatic alcohols comprising an aliphatic and/or a cycloaliphatic diol, wherein 0.5-6 mole% of the acids and/or alcohols are ethylenically unsaturated, and, optionally, a mono- and/or bisepoxide, and/or a tri- or higher-functional polyacid and/or polyalcohol, and the composition of radically polymerisable unsaturated monomers comprises a mixture of hydrophobic and hydrophilic monomers, wherein<br>
(a)	the hydrophobic monomers are selected from the group of aromatic vinyl compounds and (cyclo)alkyl(meth)acrylates with 4 or more carbon atoms in the (cyclo)alkyl group, and<br>
(b)	the hydrophilic monomers are selected from the group of (meth)acrylic acid, (meth)acryiamide, (meth)acrylonitriie, optionally substituted, unsaturated monomers containing a sulphonic acid salt group, hydroxy-alkyl(meth)acrylates, and, optionally, unsaturated monomers containing nonionic groups such as C1-C4 alkoxy polyalkylene oxide groups, wherein the molar ratio of unsaturated carboxylic acid groups to unsaturated sulphonic acid groups is between 1:1 and 4:1, the molar ratio of components (a) to components (b) is between 1:2 and 3:1, the COOH value is between 20 and 80, and the SO3H value is between 10 and 40, and wherein the carboxylic acid groups are at least partly neutralised.<br>
It should be considered highly surprising that by making use of these very specific compositions for the polyester and the polyacrylate in the proposed hybrid resins of the invention, both the pot life and the cure speed of coating compositions containing said resins remain within the envisaged targets.<br>
The same holds for the spraying properties of coating compositions containing said hybrid resins, which do not suffer from excessive foaming. The hybrid<br><br>
resins according to the invention provide stable, aqueous coating compositions which, when cured, provide high-quality coatings.<br>
Coating compositions prepared from such binder compositions according to the invention are further characterised by properties such as excellent hardness, chemical resistance, water resistance, distinctness of image (DOI), and gloss.<br>
Further provided according to the invention are a cross-linked coating which has been derived from such a coating composition and a coated substrate which has been' prepared by applying a coating composition as defined hereinbefore on a substrate, causing or allowing the aqueous-based carrier phase of the composition to be removed, and generating cross-linking of the coating that has been applied on the substrate.<br>
The partially unsaturated hydroxy-functional polyester of the polyester-polyacrylate hybrid resin according to the invention can be prepared using conventional polymerisation procedures known to be effective for polyester synthesis. The reaction to form the partially unsaturated hydroxy-functional polyester may be conducted in one or more stages. Preferably, the polyester is a branched polyester. In order to obtain a branched polyester, the condensation reaction is carried out in the presence of a branching agent, which may be a trior higher-functional acid and/or alcohol. For the tri- or higher-functional acid preference is given to an acid selected from the group of trimellitic acid and pyromellitic acid or the anhydride thereof. For the tri- or higher-functional polyaicohol preference is given to a polyaicohol selected from the group of 1,1,1-trimethylol propane, 1,1,1-trimethylol ethane, 1,2,3-trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, and mixtures thereof. More preferred is the use of a tri- or higher-functional polyaicohol. Most preferred is the use of 1,1,1-trimethylo! propane.<br>
In   order  to   achieve   hydroxyl   functionality   in   the   resulting   polyester,   a stoichiometric excess of the hydroxyl component should be used. The hydroxyl<br><br>
value of the polyester may be increased further by the incorporation of a branching agent. Preferably, the polyester has an average hydroxy! functionality of &gt;2, more preferably &gt; 2.3, and most preferably &gt;2.5.<br>
If desired, the polyester may also contain urethane groups by chain extension with a diisocyanate such as hexamethylene diisocyanate or isophorone diisocyanate, and may further be provided with a proportion of carbonylamino linking groups -C(=0)-NH- (i.e. amide linking group) by including an appropriate amino-functional reactant as part of the "hydroxy! component" (such amide linkages are in fact useful in that they are more hydrolysis-resistant and more hydrophilic).<br>
The (poly)carboxylic acids may comprise m-aromatic dicarboxyiic acids, p-aromatic dicarboxyiic acids, cycloaliphatic dicarboxyiic acids, aliphatic dicarboxyiic acids, preferably with more than 6 carbon atoms, more preferably with 6 to 12 carbon atoms, and aliphatic monocarboxylic acids, preferably with more than 6 carbon atoms, more preferably with 6 to 12 carbon atoms, or mixtures thereof. At least 50 mole% of the mono- and/or polycarboxylic acids should be aliphatic acids with 6 to 12 carbon atoms, preferably 60-100 mole%, more preferably 65-100 mole%.<br>

Optionally, monoalcohols may be used in the preparation of the polyester resin. Examples of mono-alcohols include n-hexanol, 2-ethyl hexanol, cyclohexanol, tert. butyl cyclohexanol, stearyl alcohol, dodecanol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The partially unsaturated hydroxy-functional polyester may further contain a mono- and/or bisepoxide. Particularly suitable epoxy-containing compounds are glycidyl ethers, such as alkyl glycidyl ethers, for example, butyl glycidyl ether and 2-ethylhexyl glycidyl ether; glycidyl esters, including glycidyl esters of carboxylic acids, for example, glycidyl esters of a, a-dimethyl octanoic acid, and the glycidyl ester of Versatic acid (available as Cardura®E-10 ex She!!) or bisepoxide compounds based on bisphenol A according to the following formula<br><br>
wherein n ranges from 0 to 5, preferably 0 to 3. An example thereof is the bisepoxide Epikote 828 ex Shell. The introduction of a mono- and/or bisepoxide results in the reduction of the COOH value.<br><br>

Preference is given to a partially unsaturated hydroxy-functional polyester containing 0.05 to 0.5 ethylenically unsaturated group per molecule.<br>
The polyester resin has a carboxylic acid number of 
The polyester-polyacrylate hybrid resin is obtained by the addition polymerisation of radically polymerisable unsaturated monomers in the presence of the partially unsaturated hydroxy-functional polyester described hereinbefore. In this process, the addition polymer is linked to the polyester resin by means of grafting onto the unsaturated groups in the polyester. Where the term "grafting" is used in this application, an addition polymerisation reaction to a degree of more than 0% (to a maximum of 100%) of radically polymerisable monomers on the unsaturated bonds in the polyester resin is meant.<br>
The graft polymerisation of the radically polymerisable unsaturated monomers in the presence of the partially unsaturated hydroxy-functional polyester resin is generally carried out in an inert atmosphere (e.g., of nitrogen) in the presence of a radical initiator. The reaction is preferably carried out in a water-miscible organic solvent at a temperature in the range of 60° to 200°C. The amount of organic solvent usually is in the range of 0 to 30 wt.%, calculated on the overall reaction mixture. Suitable examples of such a solvent are glycol ethers and propylene glycol ethers, such as methoxypropanol, butoxyethanol, isopropanol,<br><br>

Optionally, a hydrophilic polyisocyanate may be partially substituted for the hydrophobic polyisocyanate. Such a hydrophillic polyisocyanate may be a polyisocyanate compound substituted with non-ionic groups, such as the above-mentioned C1-C4 alkoxy polyalkylene oxide groups. Preferably 1 to 30 wt.% of non-ionic groups will be present on the total solid polyisocyanate compound, i.e. the organic,- hydrophobic, and hydrophilic polyisocyanate, more preferably 2 to 20 wt.%, most preferably 5 to 15 wt.%. Preferred are the isocyanurates of 1,6-hexane diisocyanate and isophorone diisocyanate substituted with methoxypolyethylene glycol.<br>
The polyisocyanate and the aqueous polyester-polyacrylate hybrid dispersion should be mixed in such a ratio that the NCO:OH ratio is in the range of 0.5-3:1, preferably 0.75-2.5:1, and more preferably 1-2:1.<br>
Polyisocyanate B), and, optionally, the hydrophilic polyisocyanate may be mixed into component A) by any suitable technique. However, simple stirring is usually sufficient. Sometimes it can be useful to dilute the polyisocyanate somewhat with an organic solvent like ethyl acetate or 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate to reduce its viscosity.<br>
The binder composition may contain catalysts like amines and Sn-based catalysts. Examples thereof include dibutyl tin dilaurate and dibutyl tin diacetate. The pot life at ambient temperature usually is between 2 and 10 hours, depending on the use of the catalysts and their amount The pot life is determined by the appearance of the sprayed film.<br>
The coating compositions may further comprise other ingredients, additives or auxiliaries, such as other polymers or polymer dispersions, pigments, dyes,<br><br>
emulsifiers (surfactants), pigment dispersion aids, wetting agents, levelling agents, anti-cratering agents, antifoaming agents, antisagging agents, heat stabilisers, UV absorbers, antioxidants, and fitters.<br>
Suitable types of other polymer dispersions include acrylic polymer emulsions and aqueous polyurethane dispersions.<br>
Also included in the binder or coating compositions of the invention may be reactive diluents such as water-soluble mono- or (preferably) polyhydric alcohols. Examples of monohydric alcohols include hexyl glycol, butyoxyethanol, l~methoxy-propanol-2, 1-ethoxy-propanol-2, 1-propoxy-propanoi-2, 1-butoxy-propanol-2, 2-methoxybutanol, 1-isobutoxy-propanol-2, dipropylene glcyol monomethyl ether, diacetone alcohol, methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, butanol, 2-butanol, pentanol, hexanol, benzyl alcohol, Guerbet alcohol, and mixtures thereof. Examples of polyhydric alcohols include ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, isomeric butane diols, the polyethylene oxide glycols or polypropylene oxide glycols, trimethylol propane, pentaerythritol, glycerol, and mixtures thereof.<br>
The composition of the present invention consists essentially of water, being an aqueous composition. However, about 20 wt.% of liquid content of the composition may be an organic solvent. As suitable organic solvents may be mentioned dimethyl dipropylene glycol, methyl ether of diacetone alcohol, ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, ethyl glycol acetate, butyl glycol acetate, 1-methoxy-2-propyl acetate, butyl propionate, ethoxyethyl propionate, toluene, xylene, methylethyl ketone, methylisobutyl ketone, methylamyl ketone, ethylamyl ketone, dioxolane, N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone, dimethyl carbonate, propylene carbonate, butyroiactone, caprolactone, and mixtures thereof. The VOC of the composition may range from 0 to 400 g/l, preferably from 0 to 250 g/l.<br>
The coating composition of the present invention may be applied to any substrate. The substrate may be, for example, metal, plastic, wood, glass,<br><br>
ceramic material, or some other coating layer. The other coating layer may be comprised of the coating composition of the invention or it may be a different coating composition. The coating compositioFis"of the invention show particular utility as clear coats, base coats, pigmented top coats, primers, and fillers. The coating compositions can be applied by conventional means such as by spray gun, brush, or roller, with spraying being preferred. Curing temperatures preferably are between.0° and 80°C and more preferably between 10° and 60°C. The compositions are particularly suitable in the preparation of coated metal substrates, such as in the refinish industry, in particular the body shop, to repair automobiles and transportation vehicles, and in finishing large transportation vehicles such as trains, trucks, buses, and aeroplanes.<br>
Preferred is the use of the coating composition of the present invention as a clear coat Clear coats are required to be highly transparent and must adhere well to the base coat layer. It is further required that the dear coat does not change the aesthetic aspect of the base coat by strike-in, i.e. discolouration of the base coat due to its solvation by the clear coat composition, or by yellowing of the clear coat upon outdoor exposure. A clear coat based on the coating composition of the present invention does not have these drawbacks.<br>
In the case of the coating composition being a clear coat, the base coat may be a conventional base coat known in the coating art. Examples are solvent borne base coats, e.g., Autobase® ex Akzo Nobel Coatings, based on cellulose acetobutyrate and acrylic resins, and water borne base coats, e.g., Autowave® ex Akzo Nobel Coatings, based on an acrylic resin dispersion. Furthermore, the base coat may comprise pigments (colour pigments, metafiles and/or pearls), wax, solvents, flow additives, neutralising agent, and defoamers. Also high-solids base coats can be used. These are, for instance, based on polyols, imines, and isocyanates. The clear coat composition is applied to the surface of a base coat and then cured. An intermediate curing step for the base coat may be introduced.<br><br>
The invention will be illustrated with reference to the following examples. Of course these examples are submitted for a better understanding of the invention only; they are not to be construed as limiting jn 3ny manner the scope thereof.<br><br>

Preparation of the coating compositions Examples 20 to 60<br>
The aqueous polyester-poiyacryiate hybrid-dispersions (component A) were -, mixed with poly-functional isocyanate cross-linkers (component B) in a ratio NCO:OH = 1.5:1 or NCO:OH = 1:1. The hybrid dispersions were diluted with butyl glycol (10 wt.% on solids). The isocyanate components were diluted with methoxyisopropyl acetate (80 wt.% on solids).<br>
For the  isocyanate  cross-linkers  use  was  made  of two   polyisocyanates commercially available from Bayer:<br>
a)	Desmodur LS 2025 (= Desmodur N3600) a hydrophobic isocyanurate based on 1,6-hexamethyiene diisocyanate), and<br>
b)	Bayhydur LS 2032 (= Bayhydur N3100) a hydrophilic isocyanurate based on 1,6-hexamethylene diisocyanate, modified with about 12 wt.% of methoxypolyethylene oxide glycol).<br>
LS 2032 and LS 2025 were used in a ratio of 1:1 or 2:1, based on NCO functionality.<br>
■<br>
No use was made of a catalyst.<br>
The   mixtures   of  polyester-poiyacryiate   hybrid   resin   dispersions   and   the<br>
isocyanate components were applied on glass panels in a dry layer thickness<br>
between 60 and 80 jim. The panels were allowed to dry at ambient (room)<br>
temperature (RT) for one week.<br>
The Persoz Hardness was determined in accordance with French industrial<br>
Standard method NF T30-016, the results being expressed in seconds.<br>
The resistance to methylethyl ketone was determined by means of a rub test,<br>
whereas the resistance to skydrol (a phosphate ester component used as brake<br>
fluid in aeroplanes) was determined by immersing a coated sample for 500<br>
hours at 70°C.<br>
All coating layers exhibited excellent water resistance.<br>
The properties of the obtained coating layers are given in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
Mixtures of polyester-polyacrylate dispersions and the isocyanate components in an NCO:OH ratio of 1.5:1 without catalyst were diluted to spraying viscosity and applied in two layers as a clear coat on a water borne blue metallic base coat (Autowave®, ex Akzo Nobel) on an aluminium substrate. The clear coat layers were allowed to dry for 15 minutes, followed by drying at ambient temperature or at 60°C for 45 minutes, resulting in a dry layer thickness between 50 and 90 µm. After one week at ambient (room) temperature the D.O.I, (distinction of image) and the gloss were measured in accordance with ASTM D-523 at 20°. A D.O.I, between 60 and 80 is acceptable, whereas a gloss value on a base coat at 20° of above 80 "is considered high, while a gloss value at 20° of above 70 is considered acceptable. The results are given in Table 3.<br><br><br><br>
