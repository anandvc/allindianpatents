				<td>HYDROCARBYI. PHOSPHINIMINE/CYCLOPENTADIENYL COMPLEXES OF GROUP 4 AND THEIR USB IN OLEFIN<br>
POLYMERIZATION<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to novel organometallic complexes.<br>
Additionally, the complexes have been discovered to be surprisingly active<br>
catalysts for the polymerization of olefins.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The polymerization of olefins using a catalyst having a<br>
phosphinimine ligand and a cyclopentadienyl ligand is known and is<br>
disclosed for example in copending and commonly assigned U.S. patent<br>
application 08/959,589 (Stephan et al) (now U.S Patent 5,965,677).<br>
These prior catalysts have an "activatable" ligand which is not a<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligand. Exemplary activatable ligands include halides,<br>
alkyls, amides and phosphides.<br>
We have now surprisingly discovered and reproducibly synthesized<br>
a group of novel organometallic complexes of group 4 metals having a<br>
phosphinimine ligand and more than one cyclopentadienyl ligand. These<br>
novel complexes form unique crystal structures which may be observed by<br>
x-ray techniques.<br>
The organometallic complexes of this invention might be regarded<br>
as metallocenes because they contain two or more cyclopentadienyl<br>
ligands. It is known that metallocenes of group 4 metals are active<br>
catalysts for the polymerization of ethylene. However, we have<br>
discovered that certain organometallic complexes of this invention are<br>
substantially more active for ethylene polymerization than their simple<br>
metallocene analogs.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides an organometallic<br>
complex defined by the formula:<br><br>
wherein M is a group 4 metal in oxidation state 4;<br>
each Cp is selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted<br>
cyclopentadienyl, substituted cyclopentadienyl, unsubstituted indenyl,<br>
substituted indenyl, unsubstituted fluorenyl and substituted fluorenyl;<br>
each of R1, R2 and R3 is a hydrocarbyl group which is bonded to<br>
phosphorus by a carbon-phosphorus single bond;<br>
n is 2 or 3 and n + p = 3; and<br>
when p = 1, L is a monoanionic ligand.<br>
Preferred metals are titanium, zirconium and hafnium, particularly<br>
titanium.<br>
As noted above, the novel complexes of this invention must contain<br>
either 2 or 3 cyclopentadienyl ligands. As such, they may be regarded as<br>
metallocenes. The term "cyclopentadienyl" ligand as used herein is meant<br>
to convey its broad but conventional meaning and to be inclusive of both<br>
substituted and unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl, indenyl and fluorenyl<br>
ligands. Examples of suitable substituents include alkyl groups; halide<br>
substituents (i.e. substituents which contain Br, Cl, I or F atoms) or<br>
heteroatom substituents (i.e. substituents which contain N, S, O or P<br>
atoms). For reasons of low cost and ease of organometallic synthesis, the<br>
use of unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl and unsubstituted indenyl ligands is<br>
preferred.<br>
The hydrocarbyl groups are preferably alkyl group having from 1 to<br>
10 carbon atoms. Tertiary butyl groups are particularly preferred. The<br>
hydrocarbyl groups may also contain substituents, especially halide<br>
substituents (i.e. containing Br, Cl, I or F atoms) or heteroatom<br>
substituents (i.e. substituents which contain N. S, O or P atoms).<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
We have discovered a new series of group 4 metal complexes with<br>
a phosphinimine ligand and two or more cyclopentadienyl ligands. These<br>
compounds have been examined and characterized by various analytical<br>
techniques including x-ray crystallography.<br>
Synthetic routes to the species described herein are described in<br>
detail in the Experimental section. We have previously described the<br>
facile synthesis of CpTi(NP-t-Bu3)Cl2 1. In a similar manner, the reaction<br>
of Me3SiNP-t-Bu3 2 and (lndenyl)TiCI3 3 affords the species<br>
(lndenyl)Ti(NP-t-Bu3)CI2 4 in approximately 95% isolated yield. This<br>
species is readily converted to (lndenyl)Ti(NP-t-Bu3)Me2 5 in 86% yield via<br>
reaction with methyl Grignard. This light yellow crystalline product exhibits<br>
methyl resonances in 1H NMR spectrum at 0.16 ppm. Compound 5 was<br>
also characterized by x-ray crystallography (Figure 1). These data reveal<br>
Ti-methyl carbon distances average 2.128(4) A with a C-Ti-C angle of<br>
99.50(13) °. The phosphinimide ligand geometry is typical of that seen in<br>
CpTi-phosphinimide complexes. The Ti-N and P-N distances in 5 are<br>
1.782(2) A and 1.585(2) A respectively with a P-N-Ti angle approaching<br>
linearity (178.38(11)°).<br>
Reaction of 1 with one equivalent of the dimethyl ether complex of<br>
sodium cyclopentadiene {"(dme)NaCp"] affords the dark red product<br>
Cp2Ti(NP-t-Bu3)CI 7 in 93% isolated yield. The 1H NMR spectrum of 7<br>
shows a single resonance at 6.21 ppm attributable to the cyclopentadienyl<br>
protons. The spectral features are temperature invariant, thus inferring<br>
that both cyclopentadienyl rings are bound to the metal in a n5 bonding<br>
mode. In a similar synthetic procedure, reaction of 6 with Li(lndenyl)<br>
yields the complex (lndenyl)2Ti(NP-t-Bu3)CI 8 in 86% isolated yield. The<br>
1H NMR data infer the presence of both an ?5 and an ?1 bound indenyl<br>
ligand as the overlapping resonances accounting for 14 protons give rise<br>
to six signals. These NMR features of 8 are invariant with temperature<br>
even on heating solutions of 8 to 80°C. Crystallographic study of 8 (Figure<br>
2) confirmed the interpretation of the NMR data and the presence of ?5<br>
and ?1 bound indenyl ligands. The Ti-N and Ti-CI distances in 8 are<br>
1.775(2) A and 2.2947(10) A respectively. The TJ-C distance for the ?1-<br>
indenyl ligand is 2.229(3) A. This distance is slightly longer than the cr-Ti-<br>
C found in 5, consistent with the greater steric demands of the indenyl<br>
ligands.<br>
We have also discoveredjithat the mixed cyclopentadienyl-indenyl<br>
species, Cp(lndenyl)Ti(NP-t-Bu3)CI 9 can also be prepared via two<br>
alternative pathways. Either reaction of 4 with one equivalent of<br>
(dme)NaCp or reaction of 1 with Li(lndenyl) afford dark red crystalline of 9.<br>
Regardless of the synthetic route, 1H and 13C{1H} NMR data indicate that<br>
the product 9 contains an ?5-cyclopentadienyl group and an V-indenyl<br>
fragment. This was also affirmed by the results of an x-ray<br>
crystallographic study (Figure 3). While most of the metric parameters<br>
within 9 are similar to those seen in 8, it is noteworthy that the lesser steric<br>
congestion in 9 results in a shorter Ti-C bond of 2.198(5) A. The synthesis<br>
of 9 from 1 involves a facile nucleophilic substitution. In contrast, the path<br>
to 9 from 4 likely requires an interesting ?5-?1 -indenyl ring-slippage.<br>
Complex 1 reacts with two equivalents of (dme)NaCp to give the<br>
dark red crystalline product 10 formulated as Cp3Ti(NP-t-Bu3) in 89%<br>
yield. 1H and 13C{1H} NMR spectra show single resonances at 6.03 and<br>
114.57 ppm respectively attributable to the cyclopentadienyl ligands.<br>
Cooling to —80°C reveals no change in these resonances suggesting a<br>
rapid process of site exchange. It should be noted that the three<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligands may be ?5 bonded although this proposition is<br>
unlikely for both steric and electronic reasons. Moreover, an x-ray<br>
crystallographic analysis of 10 (Figure 4) reveals that the molecule<br>
contains two ?5- and one ?1-cyclopentadienyl groups in the solid state.<br>
Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory, this geometry likely results in a<br>
relatively electron rich metal center in 10 compared to 5, 8 and 9. The<br>
significant lengthening of the Ti-N to 1.844(2) A and the Ti-C s-bonds to<br>
2.366(4) A support this view.<br>
The analogous species (lndenyl)3Ti(NP-t-Bu3) 11 is obtained from<br>
the reaction of 4 with excess Li(lndenyl). This results in the dark red<br>
crystalline product 11 in 95% yield. The 1H NMR data show four<br>
resonances at 25°C, which sharpen on heating, again inferring an ?5-?1-<br>
site exchange process. On cooling to —80°C eighteen resonances are<br>
observed, inferring the presence of inequivalent ?5- and ?1-indenyl rings.<br>
The precise assessment of the exchange barrier is a complicated issue as<br>
the exchange process appears to involve three sites for each of seven<br>
protons. Consequently, the coalescence of resonances can not be<br>
unambiguously observed, although it appears that coalescence of the<br>
resonances in the 1H NMR spectra of 11 occurs at approximately—25°C.<br>
This infers an approximate barrier to ?5- and ?1-indenyl site exchange of<br>
8-9 Kcal/mol.<br>
An x-ray crystallographic study of 11 confirmed that this species in<br>
the solid state contains a single ?5- and two V-indenyl ligands (Figure 5).<br>
The Ti-Navg (1.780(6) A) in 11 are similar to those seen in 5, 8 and 9, while<br>
the Ti-C are slightly longer (Ti-CaVg 2.215(7) A) although not as long as<br>
those seen in the more electron rich species 10. Whilst not wishing to be<br>
bound by theory, it is, presumably, the greater steric demands of the<br>
indenyl ligands that preclude the binding of two of such ligands in rj5-<br>
manner. However, it is not possible to exclude the possibility that the<br>
phosphinimine ligand is in this compound a better 6-electron donor ligand<br>
than indenyl.<br>
The mixed cyclopentadienyl-indenyl species Cp(lndenyl)2Ti(NP-t-<br>
Bu3) 12 is also accessible from the reaction of 1 and excess Li(lndenyl).<br>
The 1H NMR data show four resonances inferring the presence of an ?5-<br>
cyclopentadienyl and two ?1-indenyl ligands. This interpretation was<br>
confirmed crystallographically (Figure 6). The metric parameters are<br>
unexceptional as they mimic those observed for 5, 8, 9 and 11. In<br>
contrast to 11, compound 12 appears to be a rigid molecule in which there<br>
is no interchange of ?5-cyclopentadienyl and the two V-indenyl ligands.<br>
Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory, it may be postulated that<br>
steric crowding is a factor determining the binding modes of the<br>
cyclopentadienyl and/or indenyl ligands in the series of compounds<br>
described herein. The steric demands of the larger indenyl ligand and its<br>
extended p-system likely facilitate ring slippage and thus favor V-binding.<br>
While the geometries of the phosphinimide ligands are relatively constant,<br>
with only minor changes in the P-N bond distance and Ti-N-P bond angle,<br>
there is a clear effect of the electronic environment at the metal center on<br>
the Ti-N bond distance. In the formally 18 electron species 10, the Ti-N<br>
bond was observed to about 1.844(2) A. In contrast, in 5, 8, 9, 11 and 12<br>
the electron count is formally 16 and the Ti-N is strengthened and<br>
shortens to an observed length of about 1.77 A.<br>
Group 4 metal complexes with only two cyclopentadienyl rings or<br>
two indenyl rings classically have both rings T|5-bonded to the metal<br>
center. We are not aware of any well characterized examples of such<br>
species where the ring system is Tj1-bonded to the metal. The closest<br>
exception to this observation is in the CP3MX and Cp4M complexes with<br>
more than two cyclopentadienes. In these systems two of the<br>
cyclopentadienes are ?5-bonded while the remaining cyclopentadienes are<br>
V-bonded. These systems have been termed "whiz" compounds as the<br>
sigma bound and p bound cyclopentadienes generally rapidly interchange.<br>
The phosphinimine compounds described herein have at least two<br>
cyclopentadienyl ligands which may be substituted cyclopentadienyl<br>
ligands and a phosphinimine ligands. The compounds described are<br>
unique in structure. The x-ray crystallographic data and NMR<br>
spectroscopy data demonstrate that the cyclopentadienyl ligands or<br>
indenyl ligands can be ? or ?5 bonded to the metal depending on the<br>
number and type of cyclopentadienyl ligands or indenyl ligands present.<br>
The NMR spectroscopy data also shows that, for some of the novel<br>
compounds, ring whizzing can occur in solution. This ?1 - ?5 site<br>
exchange can be slowed by lowering the temperature. Of course, the ?1<br>
?5 site exchange is not observed when the complexes are frozen into<br>
crystals for x-ray analysts.<br>
PART A: EXPERIMENTAL<br>
All preparations were done under an atmosphere of dry, O2-free N2<br>
employing both Schlenk line techniques and an inert atmosphere glove<br>
box. Solvents were purified employing a Grubb"s type column system. All<br>
organic reagents were purified by conventional methods. 1H and 13C{1H}<br>
NMR spectra were recorded on one of two spectrometers (Bruker Avance-<br>
300 and 500 operating at 300 and 500 MHz, respectively). Trace amounts<br>
of protonated solvents were used as references and chemical shifts are<br>
reported relative to SiMe4. 31P NMR spectra were recorded on a Bruker<br>
Avance-300 and are referenced to 85% H3PO4. The precursor complexes<br>
CpTi(NP-t-Bu3)CI2 1, Me3SiNP-t-Bu3 2 and (lndenyl)TiCI3 3 were prepared<br>
via conventional (previously reported) methods.<br>

Compound 2 (0.250 g; 0.864 mmol) was added to a toluene<br>

110°C for 12 hours. The volatile products were removed in vacuo to yield<br>
a bright yellow solid. The solid was washed with hexane (3 x 25 mL),<br>
filtered and dried under vacuum (0.365 g; 0.810 mmol; 95%). 1H NMR 5<br>

Synthesis of flndenvl)Ti(NP-t-Bu3)Me2 (5)<br>
To a diethylether solution (25 mL) of complex 4 (0.250 g; 0.555<br>
mmol) was added an excess of MeMgBr (0.42 mL; 3.0 M; 1.25 mmol) at<br>
room temperature. The solution was stirred for 12 hours. The solvent<br>
was removed in vacuo and the solid extracted with hexane (3 x 25 mL).<br>
The volume of the solvent was reduced to 10 mL and the solution was left<br>
to crystallize overnight. Light yellow crystalline 5 was isolated by filtration<br>
and dried under vacuum (0.195 g; 0.476 mmol; 86%). 1H NMR 8 7.67 (m,<br>
2H, Indenyl), 7.20 (m, 2H, Indenyl), 6.85 (d, 2H, Indenyl), 6.01 (t, 1H,<br>

NMR 8 126.54, 125.02, 123.48, 112.71, 100.62, 42.86 (TiMe22), 41.30 (d,<br>
J1pc = 46.1 Hz, PCMe3). 29.57. 31P{1H} NMR 8 31.93. This light yellow<br>
crystalline product exhibits methyl resonances in 1H NMR spectrum at<br>
0.16 ppm. Compound 5 was also characterized by x-ray crystallography<br>
(Figure 1). These data reveal Ti-methyl carbon distances average<br>
2.128(4) A with a C-Ti-C angle of 99.50(13) °. The phosphinimide ligand<br>
geometry is similar to that seen in simple CpTi-phosphinimide complexes.<br>
The Ti-N and P-N distances in 5 are 1.782(2) A and 1.585(2) A<br>
respectively with a P-N-Ti angle approaching linearity (178.38(11)°).<br>
Synthesis of (t-Bu2PN)TiCI3 (6)<br>
To a solution of TiCU (0.327 g; 1.73 mmol) in xylenes (3.5 mL) was<br>
added a solution of 2 (0.500 g; 1.73 mmol) in xylenes (3.5 mL). The<br>
reaction was then heated to 135°C in an oil bath. After 17 hours the<br>
solution was cooled and a filtration of the solution yielded (0.575 g; 1.55<br>
mmol; 90%) of 6 as a yellow powder. 1H NMR 5 1.08 (d, J3 ph = 14.2 Hz;<br>
27H; t-Bu).<br>
Synthesis of Cp?Ti7NP-t-Bu3)Cl (7)<br>
To a THF solution (10 mL) of complex 1 (0.250 g; 0.625 mmol) was<br>
added one equivalent of NaCpDME (0.100 g; 0.625 mmol) at 20°C. The<br>
yellow solution turned dark red within minutes. The solution was stirred for<br>
12 hours and the solvent was removed under vacuum to yield a dark red<br>
solid. The solid was extracted with hot benzene (3 x 25 mL). The volume<br>
of the filtrate was reduced to 10 mL and the solution left to crystallize for<br>
12 hours. Dark red crystalline 7 was isolated by filtration and dried under<br>
vacuum (0.251 g; 0.584 mmol; 93%). 1H NMR 5 6.21 (s, 10H, Cp), 1.17<br>
(d, J3ph = 13.1 Hz, 27H, PtBu3). 13C{1H} NMR 5 115.06, 41.80 (d, J1Pc =<br>
45.9 Hz, PCMe3), 29.99. 31P{1H} NMR 8 39.45. The 1H NMR spectrum of<br>
7 shows a single resonance at 6.21 ppm attributable to the<br>
cyclopentadienyi protons. The spectral features are temperature invariant.<br>
Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory, this suggests that both<br>
cyclopentadienyi rings are bound to the metal in a ?5 bonding mode.<br>
Synthesis of (Indenyl)2TUNP-t-Bu3)CI (8)<br>
The synthesis of complex 8 is similar to that of 7. Complex 4<br>
(0.300 g; 0.666 mmol) and Li(lndenyl) (0.081 g; 0.663 mmol) afford dark<br>
red crystalline 8 (0.302 g; 0.570 mmol; 86%). Alternatively, complex 8 can<br>
be synthesized from 6 and two equivalents of Li(lndenyl) 1H NMR 5 7.53<br>
(m, 2H, Indenyl), 7.32 (m, 2H, Indenyl), 7.24 (m, 4H, Indenyl), 6.45 (broad<br>
m, 2H, Indenyl), 6.45 (m, 2H, Indenyl), 6.14 (broad, 2H, Indenyl), 1.18 (d,<br>
J3ph = 11.9 Hz, 27H, t-Bu). 13C{1H} NMR 8 124.68, 124.58, 123.53,<br>
123.38, 115.55, 96.37, 41.50 (d, J1Pc = 44.1 Hz, PCMe3), 29.53. 31P{1H)<br>
NMR 5 44.08. The 1H NMR data infer the presence of both an ?5 and an<br>
tj1 bound indenyl ligand as the overlapping resonances accounting for 14<br>
protons give rise to six signals. These NMR features of 8 are invariant<br>
with temperature even on heating solutions of 8 to 80°C. Crystallographic<br>
study of 8 (Figure 2) confirmed the interpretation of the NMR data and the<br>
presence of -?5 and ?1 bound indenyl ligands. The Ti-N and Ti-CI<br>
distances in 8 are 1.775(2) A and 2.2947(10) A respectively. The Ti-C<br>
distance for the V-indenyl ligand is 2.229(3) A. This distance is slightly<br>
longer than the s-Ti-C found in 5, consistent with the greater steric<br>
demands of the indenyl ligands.<br>
Synthesis of Cpnndenvl)Ti(NP-t-Bu3)CI (9)<br>
The synthesis of complex 9 is similar to that of 7. Complex 4<br>
(0.500 g; 1-11 mmol) and NaCpDME (0.160 g; 1.09 mmol) afford dark red<br>
crystalline 9 (0.465 g; 0.973 mmol; 88%). Alternatively, complex 9 can be<br>
synthesized from 1 and one equivalent of Li(lndenyl). 1H NMR 5 8.04 (d,<br>
1H, Indenyl), 7.72 (d, 1H, Indenyl), 7.32 (m, 2H, Indenyl), 6.85 (m, 2H,<br>
Indenyl), 6.24 (d, 1H Indenyl), 5.68 (s, 5H, Cp), 1.16 (d, J3PH = 13.4 Hz,<br>
27H, P"Bua). 13C{1H} NMR 8 147.73, 142.44. 133.19, 124.65. 122.28,<br>
122.13, 120.97, 115.35, 113.69. 93.77, 41.55 (d, J1PC = 44.1 Hz, PCMe3),<br>
29.52. 31P{1H} NMR 5 44.44. Regardless of the synthetic route, 1H and<br>
13C{1H} NMR data confirm that the product 9 contains an ?5-<br>
cyclopentadienyl group and an V-indenyl fragment. This view was also<br>
affirmed by the results of an x-ray crystallographic study (Figure 3). While<br>
most of the metric parameters within 9 are similar to those seen in 8, it is<br>
noteworthy that the lesser steric congestion in 8 results in a shorter Ti-C<br>
bond of 2.198(5) A. The synthesis of 9 from 1 involves a facile<br>
nucleophilic substitution. In contrast, the path to 8 from 4 requires an ?5-<br>
?1-indenyl ring slippage.<br>
Synthesis of Cp3Ti(NP-t-Bu3) (10)<br>
The synthesis of complex 10 is similar to that of 7. Complex 1<br>
(0.500 g; 1.25 mmol) and excess NaCp DME (0.401 g; 2.75 mmol) afford<br>
dark red crystalline 10 (0.510 g; 1.11 mmol; 89%). 1H NMR 5 6.03 (s,<br>
15H. Cp), 1.13 (d, J3pH = 13.1 Hz, 27H, P"Bu3). 13C{1H} NMR 5 114.57,<br>
42.00 (d, J1pc = 46.6 Hz. PCMe3), 30.50. 31P{1H) NMR 5 37.48. 1H and<br>
13C{1H} NMR spectra show single resonances at 6.03 and 114.57 ppm,<br>
respectively, which are attributable to the cyclopentadienyl ligands.<br>
Cooling to —80°C, reveals no change in these resonances, suggesting a<br>
rapid process of site exchange. It should be noted that the presence of<br>
three ?5-cyclopentadienyl ligands can not specifically be excluded<br>
although this proposition is unlikely for both steric and electronic reasons.<br>
An x-ray crystallographic analysis of 10 (Figure 4) reveals that the<br>
molecule contains two ?5- and one V-cyclopentadienyl groups in the solid<br>
state.<br>
Synthesis of (Indenvl)3Ti(NP-t-Bu3) (11)<br>
The synthesis of complex 11 is similar to that of 7. Complex 4<br>
(0.500 g; 1.11 mmol) and excess Li(lndenyl) (0.300 g; 2.46 mmol) afford<br>
dark red crystalline 11 (0.640 g; 1.05 mmol; 95%). Alternatively, complex<br>
11 can be synthesized from 6 and three equivalents of Li(lndenyl). 1H<br>
NMR 57.45 (broad m, 6H, Indenyl), 7.18 (m, 6H, Indenyl), 6.29 (t, 3H,<br>
Indenyl), 5.53 (broad, 6H, Indenyl), 0.95 (d, J3™ = 13.5 Hz, 27H; PfBu3).<br>
13C{1H} NMR 5 123.24, 41.35 (d, J1pc = 44.0 Hz, PCMe3), 15.53. 31P{1H}<br>
NMR 5 44.08. The 1H NMR data show four resonances at 25°C, which<br>
sharpen on heating, again inferring the type of ?5-?1-site exchange<br>
process discussed above. On cooling to —80°C eighteen resonances are<br>
observed, inferring the presence of inequivalent ?5- and ?1-indenyl rings.<br>
The precise assessment of the exchange barrier is a complicated issue as<br>
the exchange process appears to involve three sites for each of seven<br>
protons. Consequently, the coalescence of resonances can not be<br>
unambiguously observed, although it appears that coalescence of the<br>
resonances in the 1H NMR spectra of 11 occurs at approximately —25°C.<br>
This infers an approximate barrier to ?5- and ?1- indenyl site exchange of<br>
8-9 Kcal/mol. An x-ray crystallographic study of 11 confirmed that this<br>
species in the solid state contains a single ?5- and two V-indenyl ligands.<br>
The average Ti-N (1.780(6) A) in 11 are similar to those seen in 5, 8 and<br>
9, while the average Ti-C are slightly longer (Ti-CaVg 2.215(7) A) although<br>
not as long as those seen in 10. Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory,<br>
space roups in each case. The data sets were collected (4.5°
it is presumably the greater steric demands of the indenyl ligands that<br>
preclude the binding of two of such ligands in ?5-manner.<br>
Synthesis of Cpgndenvl)2Ti(NP-t-Bu3) (121<br>
Complex 1 (0.500 g, 1.25 mmol) and Li(lndenyl) (0.366 g, 3.00<br>
mmol) were combined as solids and toluene (25 mL) was added. The<br>
reaction was allowed to stir for 72 hours and then was filtered and<br>
concentrated in vacuo. Heptane was then added slowly and the product<br>
crystallized as a dark red solid (0.407 g; 0.728 mmol; 58%). 1H NMR 5<br>
7.78 (m, 4H; Indenyl), 7.22 (m, 4H; Indenyl), 6.67 (m, 2H; Indenyl), 6.24<br>
(m, 4H; Indenyl), 5.53 (s, 5H; Cp), 0.92 (d, J3ph =13.3 Hz; 27H; P"Bu3).<br>
The 1H NMR data show four resonances inferring the presence of an ?s-<br>
cyclopentadienyt and two v1-indenyl ligands. This interpretation was<br>
confirmed crystallographically for the solid state. The metric parameters<br>
are unexceptional as they mimic those observed for 5, 8, 9 and 11. In<br>
contrast to 11, compound 12 appears to be a rigid molecule in which there<br>
is no interchange of ?5-cyclopentadienyl and the two ?1-indenyl ligands.<br>
X-Rav Data Collection and Reduction<br>
X-ray quality crystals of 5, 8-12 were obtained directly from the<br>
preparation as described above. The crystals were manipulated and •<br>
mounted in capillaries in a glove box, thus maintaining a dry, O2-free<br>
environment for each crystal. Diffraction experiments were performed on<br>
a diffractometer (Siemens SMART System CCD) collecting a hemisphere<br>
of data in 1329 frames with 10 second exposure times. Crystal data are<br>
summarized in Table 1. The observed extinctions were consistent with the<br>
space groups in each case. The data sets were collected (4.5°
50.0°). A measure of decay was obtained by re-collecting the first 50<br>
frames of each data set. The intensities of reflections within these frames<br>
showed essentially no statistically significant change over the duration of<br>
the data collections. The data were processed using a conventional data<br>
processing package in particular, using software known as SAINT and<br>
XPREP. An empirical absorption correction based on redundant data was<br>
applied to each data set. Additional solution and refinement was<br>
performed using conventional techniques (i.e. TEXSAN software solution<br>
package operating on a mainframe computer ("SGI Challenge"<br>
computers) with remote X-terminals or a personal computer employing X-<br>
emulation). The reflections with Fo2&gt;3sFo2 were used in the refinements.<br>
Structure Solution and Refinement<br>
Non-hydrogen atomic scattering factors were taken from the<br>
literature tabulations. The heavy atom positions were determined using<br>
direct methods (with software known as SHELX-TL). The remaining non-<br>
hydrogen atoms were located from successive difference Fourier map<br>
calculations. The refinements were carried out by using full-matrix least<br>
squares techniques on F, minimizing the function ?(IFol-IFcl)2 where the<br>
weight ? is defined as 4F02/2s(F02) and F o and Fc are the observed and<br>
calculated structure factor amplitudes. In the final cycles of each<br>
refinement, all non-hydrogen atoms were assigned anisotropic<br>
temperature factors. Carbon bound hydrogen atom positions were<br>
calculated and allowed to ride on the carbon to which they are bonded<br>
assuming a C-H bond length of 0.95 A. Hydrogen atom temperature<br>
factors were fixed at 1.10 times the isotropic temperature factor of the<br>
carbon atom to which they are bonded. The hydrogen atom contributions<br>
were calculated, but not refined. The locations of the largest peaks in the<br>
final difference Fourier map calculation as well as the magnitude of the<br>
residual electron densities in each case were of no chemical significance.<br>
X-ray crystallography data which further characterize the above<br>
described complexes are provided in the accompanying tables.<br>
PART B: GAS PHASE POLYMERIZATION<br>
Catalyst Preparation and Polymerization Testing Using a Semi-Batch,<br>
Gas Phase Reactor<br>
Standard Schlenk and drybox techniques were used in the<br>
preparation of supported catalyst systems using the organometallic<br>
complexes from Part A. Solvents were purchased as anhydrous materials<br>
and further treated to remove oxygen and polar impurities by contact with<br>
a combination of activated alumina, molecular sieves and copper oxide on<br>
silica/alumina. Where appropriate, elemental compositions of the<br>
supported catalysts were measured by Neutron Activation analysis and a<br>
reported accuracy of + 1% (weight basis).<br>
The supported catalysts were prepared by initially supporting a<br>
commercially available MAO on a silica support (12 weight % aluminum,<br>
based on the weight of the silica support), followed by deposition of the<br>
organometallic complex. The aiming point for the Al/Ti mole ratio was<br>
120/1.<br>
All the polymerization experiments described below were<br>
conducted using a semi-batch, gas phase polymerization reactor of total<br>
internal volume of 2.2 L. Reaction gas mixtures (ethylene/butene<br>
mixtures) were measured to the reactor on a continuous basis using a<br>
calibrated thermal mass flow meter, following passage through purification<br>
media as described above. Reaction pressure was set at 200°C. A pre-<br>
determined mass of the catalyst sample (Table B1) was added to the<br>
reactor under the flow of the inlet gas with no pre-contact of the catalyst<br>
with any reagent, such as a catalyst activator. The catalyst was activated<br>
in-situ (in the polymerization reactor) at the reaction temperature in the<br>
presence of the monomers, using a metal alkyl complex which has been<br>
previously added to the reactor to remove adventitious impurities. Purified<br>
and rigorously anhydrous sodium chloride (160 g) was used as a catalyst<br>
dispersing agent.<br>
The internal reactor temperature was set at 90°C and monitored by<br>
a thermocouple in the polymerization medium and controlled to +/- 1.0°C.<br>
The duration of the polymerization experiment was one hour. Following<br>
the completion of the polymerization experiment, the polymer was<br>
separated from the sodium chloride and the yield determined.<br>
Table B1 illustrates data concerning the Al/transition metal ratios of<br>
the supported catalyst and polymer yield. Table B2 provides data which<br>
describe polymer properties.<br>
Experiments 1 -3 are inventive. Experiment 4, using titanocene<br>
dichloride (Cp2TiCla) is comparative. Titanocene dichloride is substantially<br>
less active than the inventive complexes. This is an unusual and<br>
surprising result. Whilst not wishing to be bound by theory, the<br>
experimental results suggests that the MAO (which is a Lewis acid) does<br>
not preferentially/completely abstract the phosphinimide ligand of the<br>
inventive complexes. Instead, the results strongly suggest that the MAO<br>
preferentially abstracts a Cp-type ligand from the inventive complexes.<br>
The resulting catalysts according to this invention are substantially more<br>
active than the comparative titanocene as shown in Table B1.<br>
PART C: THE CONTINUOUS SOLUTION POLYMERIZATION<br>
All the polymerization experiments described below were<br>
conducted on a continuous solution polymerization reactor. The process<br>
is continuous in all feed streams (solvent, monomers and catalyst) and in<br>
the removal of product. All feed streams were purified prior to the reactor<br>
by contact with various absorption media to remove catalyst killing<br>
impurities such as water, oxygen and polar materials as is known to those<br>
skilled in the art. All components were stored and manipulated under an<br>
atmosphere of purified nitrogen.<br>
All the examples below were conducted in a reactor of 71.5 cc<br>
internal volume. In each experiment the volumetric feed to the reactor<br>
was kept constant and as a consequence so was the reactor residence<br>
time.<br>
The catalyst solutions were pumped to the reactor independently<br>
and in some cases were mixed before entering the polymerization reactor<br>
(as indicated in the examples). Because of the low solubility of the<br>
catalysts, activators and MAO in cyclohexane, solutions were prepared in<br>
purified xylene. The catalyst was activated in-situ (in the polymerization<br>
reactor) at the reaction temperature in the presence of the monomers.<br>
The polymerizations were carried out in cyclohexane at a pressure of 1500<br>
psi. Ethylene was supplied to the reactor by a calibrated thermal mass<br>
flow meter and was dissolved in the reaction solvent prior to the<br>
polymerization reactor. If comonomer (for example 1 -octene) was used it<br>
was also premixed with the ethylene before entering the polymerization<br>
reactor. Under these conditions the ethylene conversion is a dependent<br>
variable controlled by the catalyst concentration, reaction temperature and<br>
catalyst activity, etc.<br>
The internal reactor temperature is monitored by a thermocouple in<br>
the polymerization medium and can be controlled at the required set point<br>
to +/- 0.5°C. Down stream of the reactor the pressure was reduced from<br>
the reaction pressure (1500 psi) to atmospheric. The solid polymer was<br>
then recovered as a slurry in the condensed solvent and was dried by<br>
evaporation before analysis.<br>
The ethylene conversion was determined by a dedicated on line<br>
gas chromatograph by reference to propane which was used as an<br>
internal standard. The average polymerization rate constant was<br>
calculated based on the reactor hold-up time, the catalyst concentration in<br>
the reactor and the ethylene conversion and is expressed in l/(mmol*min).<br>
Average polymerization rate (kp) = (Q/(100-Q)) x (1/[TM]) x (1/HUT)<br>
where: Q is the percent ethylene conversion;<br>
[TM] is the catalyst concentration in the reactor expressed in<br>
mM; and<br>
HUT is the reactor hold-up time in minutes.<br>
Polymer Analysis<br>
Melt index (Ml) measurements were conducted according to ASTM<br>
method D-1238-82.<br>
Polymer densities were measured on pressed plaques (ASTM D-<br>
1928-90) with a densitometer.<br>
Polymerization and polymer data for the following examples are<br>
shown in Table C1.<br>

is not very active under solution polymerization conditions similar to those<br>
described in the inventive examples, although a small amount of low<br>
molecular weight polymer was recovered.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
The inventive complexes are well suited for use as a component in<br>
a cataiyst system for the polymerization of olefins, especially ethyiene.<br>
Polyethylene produced with the inventive complexes is useful, for<br>
example, in the production of film, extruded parts and profiles and molded<br>
plastic goods.<br>
We Claim:<br>
1. An organometallic complex defined by the formula:<br><br>
wherein M is a group 4 metal in oxidation state 4;<br>
each Cp is selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted<br>
cyclopentadienyl, substituted cyclopentadienyl, unsubstituted<br>
indenyl, substituted indenyl, unsubstituted fluorenyl and<br>
substituted fluorenyl;<br>
each of R1, R2 and R3 is a hydrocarbyl group which is bonded to<br>
phosphorus by a carbon-phosphorus single bond;<br>
n is 2 or 3 and n + p = 3; and<br>
when p = 1, L is a monoanionic ligand, which is not —N=PR1R2R3;<br>
and where at least one of said Cp is either unsubstituted or<br>
substituted indenyl.<br>
2. The organometallic complex as claimed in claim 1 wherein M is<br>
Ti.<br>
3. The organometallic complex as claimed in claim 1 wherein n is 3<br>
and each Cp is selected from unsubstituted cyclopentadienyl and<br>
unsubstituted indenyl.<br>
4. The organometallic complex as claimed in claim 1 wherein each R<br>
is an alkyl group.<br>
5. The organometallic complex as claimed in claim 4 wherein each R<br>
is tertiary butyl.<br>
6. An olefin polymerization process wherein at least one alpha olefin<br>
having from 2 to 10 carbon atoms is polymerized in the presence<br>
of a catalyst system comprising:<br>
a) an organometallic complex as defined in claim 1; and<br>
b) an activator.<br>
7. The process as claimed in claim 6 wherein:<br>
(i) said organometallic complex and said activator are<br>
supported or a particular support; and<br>
(ii) said polymerization process is a gas phase<br>
copolymerization of ethylene and at least one alpha<br>
olefin selected from butene, pentene and hexane,<br>
wherein said gas phase copolymerization is undertaken at a<br>
pressure of from 1 to 20 atmosphere and a temperature of from<br>
60 to 130°C.<br>
8. The process as claimed in claim 6 wherein said olefin<br>
polymerization is conducted in the presence of a hydrocarbon<br>
diluent or hydrocarbon solvent.<br>
An organometallic complex defined by the formula:<br>
wherein M is a group 4 metal in oxidation state 4;<br>
each Cp is selected from the group consisting of unsubstituted<br>
cyclopentadienyl, substituted cyclopentadienyl, unsubstituted indenyl,<br>
substituted indenyl, unsubstituted fluorenyl and substituted fluorenyl;<br>
each of R1, R2 and R3 is a hydrocarbyl group which is bonded to phosphorus<br>
by a carbon-phosphorus single bond;<br>
n is 2 or 3 and n + p = 3; and<br>
when p = 1, L is a monoanionic ligand, which is not —N=PR1R2R3; and<br>
where at least one of said Cp is either unsybstituted or substituted indenyl.</td>
