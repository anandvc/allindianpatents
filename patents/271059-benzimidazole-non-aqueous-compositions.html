				<td>This invention relates to benzimidazole non-aqueous compositions BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The benzimidazoles are the largest chemical family used to treat endoparasitic diseases in domestic animals. They are characterized by a broad spectrum of activity and a wide safety margin. Their high degree of efficacy and low toxicity are often sought after in agronomic practice. However, they are sparingly soluble in water and are generally administered orally as a suspension or paste or by intraruminal injection. Although oral administration of benzimidazoles in ruminants and horses is particularly effective, a suspension or paste formulation generally causes manufacturing, storage and stability problems. Further, it is often desirable to combine the benzimidazole with a macrocyclic lactone to broaden the spectrum of parasites controlled to include ectoparasites arid those endoparasites which may be missed by the benzimidazole. However, the physical and chemical stability of the macrocyclic lactone may be compromised in a routine suspension or paste formulation.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of this invention to provide an effective oral veterinary composition containing a benzimidazole and a macrocyclic lactone, which is a stable homogeneous clear solution.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a method for the prevention, treatment and control of endo- and ectoparasitic infection or infestation in an animal, particularly a horneothermic animal.<br>
Other objects and features of the invention will become more apparent from the detailed description set forth hereinbelow.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a stable, non-aqueous, oral, veterinary composition which comprises one or more surfactants, a water-miscible solvent, optionally an oil and an effective amount of each of a benzimidazole and a macrocyclic lactone.<br>
Also provided are a method for the treatment and control of parasitic infection and infestation in a horneothermic animal and a process for the preparation of a non-aqueous oral veterinary parasiticidal composition.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Benzimidazoles are used to treat endoparasitic diseases in domestic animals and are characterized by a broad spectrum of activity and low toxicity. Benzimidazoles of current interest include thiabendazole, cambendazole, parbendazole, mebendazole, fenbendazole, oxfendazole, oxibendazole, albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide, thiophanate, febantel, netobimin, and triclabendazole. It is often desirable to administer the benzimidazole compound in combination with a macrocyclic lactone such as milbemycin D; avermectin; ivermectin; abamectin; doramectin; moxidectin or the like to enhance the spectrum of parasites to be controlled. Benzimidazoles and macrocyclic lactones offer complimentary parasite control in homeothermic animals. For example, triclabendazole is active against liver flukes but not round worms or ectoparasites and moxidectin is active against round worms and ectoparasites, but is less active as a flukicide.<br>
Ideally, veterinary compositions containing both a benzimidazole and a macrocyclic lactone would be stable, bioavailable and easy to administer. Because benzimidazoles have very limited solubility in water, they are often formulated as suspensions or pastes. However, suspension and paste compositions frequently exhibit caking and sedimentation which cause manufacturing, storage and stability problems. Further, in order to obtain sufficient bioavailability, micronization of the benzimidazole is generally required in the formulation process of a suspension or paste. Moreover, paste formulations may retain their structure and are often spit out of the animal's mouth.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that a benzimidazole and a macrocyclic lactone may be formulated as a clear, homogeneous, non-aqueous solution suitable for oral administration to a homeothermic animal. Advantageously, the composition of the invention is self-emulsifying so that the benzimidazole active ingredient does not precipitate in the stomach but remains bioavailable. Since the benzimidazole remains in solution, no micronization is required in the preparation of the inventive composition. The oral veterinary composition of the invention comprises one or more surfactants, a water-miscible solvent, optionally an oil and an effective amount of each of a benzimidazole and a macrocyclic lactone.<br>
Surfactants suitable for use in the inventive composition include non-ionic surfactants such as sucrose monolaurate, sorbitan monooleate or polysorbate 80; polyethylene glycol 660 hydroxystearate; polyoxyl 35 castor oil; PEG-60 hydrogenated castor oil or the like, or a mixture thereof, preferably sorbitan fatty acid esters, more preferably sorbitan monooleate or polysorbate 80 or a mixture thereof.<br><br>
Water-miscible solvents suitable for use in the inventive composition include pharmaceutically acceptable water-miscible solvents, for example alcohols such as benzyl alcohol, ethanol, or the like; glycols such as polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, glycerin, or the like, preferably alcohols or glycols or a mixture thereof, more preferably benzyl alcohol, ethanol, polyethylene glycol, propylene glycol, or a mixture thereof.<br>
Oils suitable for use in the inventive composition include pharmaceuticaily acceptable oils, lor example propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate, caprylic/capric triglyceride, or the like, preferably propylene glycol dicaprylate/dicaprate.<br>
Benzimidazoles suitable for use in the inventive composition include thiabendazole, cambendazole, parbendazole, mebendazole, fenbendazole, oxfendazole, oxibendazole, albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide, thiophanate, febantel, netobimin, or triclabendazole, preferably triclabendazole.<br>
Macrocyclic lactones suitable for use in the composition of the invention include milbemycin D, avermectin, ivermectin, abamectin, doramectin, or moxidectin, preferably moxidectin.<br>
The effective amounts of the benzimidazole and macrocyclic lactone compounds may vary according to the potency of the compounds, the method of application, the host animal, the target parasite, the degree of infestation, or the like. In general, amounts of about 2-10% w/v, preferably 3-7% w/v, of a benzimidazole such as triclabendazole may be suitable and amounts of about 0.01-2.0% w/v, preferably 0.05-1.0% w/v, more preferably about 0.07-0.3% w/v of a macrocyclic lactone such as moxidectin may be suitable.<br>
Surfactants may be present in the inventive composition in amounts of 1.0-75.0% w/v, preferably 2.5-60.0% w/v. The oil may be present in amounts of about 0-70% w/v, preferably about 10-70% w/v, more preferably about 25-65%w/v.<br>
As used in the specification and claims, the term "benzimidazole" designates a veterinary compound in the benzimidazole chemical family such as thiabendazole, cambendazole, parbendazole, mebendazole, fenbendazole, oxfendazole, oxibendazole, albendazole, albendazole sulfoxide, thiophanate, febantel, netobimin, or triclabendazole. As used in the specification and claims, the term "macrocyclic lactone" designates a pharmaceutical compound in the avermectin or milbemycin family of compounds including avermectins such as ivermectin, abamectin or doramectin and milbemycins such as milbemycin D or moxidectin.<br><br>
As used herein, the term "w/w" designates weight/weight, the term "w/v" designates weight/volume, and the term "mg/kg" designates milligrams per kilogram of body weight.<br>
