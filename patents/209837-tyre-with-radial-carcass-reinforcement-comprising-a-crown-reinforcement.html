'TYRE WITH RADIAL CARCASS REINFORCEMENT COMPRISING A CROWN REINFORCEMENT"<br>
SOCIETE DE TECHNOLOGIE MICHELIN, a French company of 23, rue Breschet, F-63000 Clermont-Ferrand, France and MICHELIN RECHERCHE ET TECHNIQUE S.A., a Swiss company of Route Louis Braille, 10 et 12, CH-1763, Granges-Paccot, Switzerland,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
CROWN REINFORCEMENT FOR A RADIAL TYRE<br>
The present invention relates to a tyre with radial carcass reinforcement anchored on either side to at least one bead wire and having a crown reinforcement formed of at least two so-called working plies, superposed and made of wires or cables which are parallel in each ply and are crossed from one ply to the next, forming angles of at most 45째 in absolute value with the circumferential direction of the tyre.<br>
It relates more particularly to a tyre of the "heavy vehicle" type, the ratio of the height above rim H to the maximum axial width S of which is at most 0.80, and which is intended to be fitted on a medium- or high-tonnage vehicle, such as a lorry, bus, trailer, etc.<br>
Some current tyres, called "highway" tyres, are intended to travel at high speed and on longer and longer journeys, owing to the improvement in the road network and the growth of the motorway network throughout the world. All the conditions under which such a tyre is required to travel without doubt make it possible to increase the number of kilometres travelled, the wear of the tyre being less; on the other hand, the endurance of the latter and in particular of the crown reinforcement is adversely affected.<br>
The lack of endurance relates both to the fatigue resistance of the crown plies, and in particular the resistance to separation between ends of plies, and to the fatigue resistance of the cables of the portion of carcass reinforcement located beneath the crown reinforcement, the first deficiency being greatly influenced by the operating temperature at the edges of the working plies, whether travelling in a straight line or under drift.<br>
A first solution has been described in French Application FR 2 728 510, and proposes arranging, firstly between the carcass reinforcement and the crown reinforcement working ply radially closest to the axis of rotation, an axially<br><br><br>
continuous ply formed of inextensible metal cables forming an angle of at least 60째 with the circumferential direction and the axial width of which is at least equal to the axial width of the shortest working crown ply, and, secondly between the two working crown plies, an additional .ply formed of metallic elements oriented substantially parallel to the circumferential direction, the axial width of said ply being at least 0.7 So.<br>
The problems relating to the separation between working plies and the fatigue resistance of the carcass reinforcement cables have been solved, and the operating temperatures reduced; on the other hand, prolonged travel of the tyres thus constructed has caused fatigue breaking of the cables of the additional ply, and more particularly of the edges of said ply, to occur, whether or not the so-called triangulation ply is present.<br>
It is always possible to change the reinforcement elements concerned, and in particular to select cables of a different construction or cables of greater tensile strength. The solution above, while admittedly simple, is still costly.<br>
Thus, in order to overcome these above new drawbacks and to improve the endurance of the crown reinforcement of the type of tyre in question, French Application 3 ] 73/DEL/98 which has not been published to date, has chosen another solution, and proposes, on either side of the equatorial plane and in the immediate axial extension of the additional ply of reinforcements which are substantially parallel to the circumferential direction, to couple, over a certain axial distance, the two working crown plies formed of reinforcement elements crossed from one ply to the next, then to decouple them by profiled members of rubber mix at least over the remainder of the width common to the said two, working plies.<br>
The fatigue strength of the circumferential elements is not optimal, unless the minimum density of the elements at the edges of the ply and a minimum rupture resistance of said elements are respected, which involves a high cost price for material.<br><br>
In order to improve the endurance of the crown reinforcement of the type of tyre in question, without being faced with problems of fatigue of the reinforcement elements, French application FR 98/06000 radically modifies the orientation of the inextensible reinforcement elements of the additional ply which is arranged radially between said working plies, said elements then being radial.<br>
The shearing stresses between the two working crown plies are very great, more particularly in the case of coupling of said two working plies, which results in delamination between the plies as the tyre becomes fatigued. In order to overcome the above disadvantages and to improve the endurance of the crown reinforcement of the type of tyre in question, the invention proposes ingeniously to reconcile the advantages of radial orientation with those of circumferential orientation of the reinforcements elements of the additional ply located radially between the two working crown plies.<br>
According to a first variant, the tyre P according to the invention, with radial carcass reinforcement of maximum axial width So, comprising a crown reinforce짭ment formed of at least two working crown plies of inextensible reinforcement elements, crossed from one ply to the other, forming angles of between 10째 and 45째 with the circumferential direction, said plies having axial widths L32, L34 at least equal to 80% of the width So, is characterised in that an additional ply formed of least one ply of reinforcement elements, of width L33 less by at least 15% of the width So than the width L32 (L33) of the least wide working ply, arranged radially between said working plies, is axially composed of three parts, a central part in the form of a ply formed of inextensible, substantially radial, metallic reinforcement elements, said ply having an axial width L'33 equal to at least 45% of the width So, and two lateral parts in the form of strips, each formed of circumferential elastic metallic reinforcement elements, the modulus of elasticity upon traction per unit of width of a lateral strip being at most equal to the modulus of elasticity upon traction, measured under the same conditions, of the most extensible working ply, and the width L"33 of each strip being at most 10% of the width So.<br><br>
"Inextensible element" is to be understood to mean an element, cable or monofilament which has a relative elongation of less than 0.2% when subjected to a tensile force equal to 10% of the breaking load. In the case of the tyre in question, the inextensible reinforcement elements are preferably inextensible metal cables made of steel.<br>
Metallic elements oriented substantially parallel to the circumferential direction are elements which form angles within the range +2.5째, -2.5째 around 0째 with said direction.<br>
Substantially radial reinforcement elements, cords or cables are elements which form angles within the range +5째, -5째 around 0째 with the meridian direction.<br>
Metallic reinforcement elements are said to be elastic when they have a relative elongation greater than 2% when they are subjected to a tensile force equal to 10% of their breaking load. They have a curve of tensile stress as a function of the relative elongation which has shallow gradients for the slight elongations and a substantially constant, steep gradient for the greater elongations, the change of gradient taking place in a range of relative elongation of between 0.2% and 0.8%. Owing to this, said elements may be referred to as "bimodular" elements.<br>
A modulus of elasticity E upon traction of a ply per unit of width results from the tensile stress o exerted in the direction of the reinforcement elements and over a unit of width to obtain a relative elongation e. "Elasticity modulus of the lateral part of the additional ply which is at most equal to the modulus of the same name of the most extensible working ply" is to be understood to mean that the modulus of said part of the additional ply, whatever the relative elongation, is at most equal to the modulus of the most extensible working ply whatever the relative elongation, the most extensible ply being the ply which, for each value of tensile stress, has a relative elongation greater than that of the other ply for the same stress.<br><br>
Advantageously, the modulus of the lateral part of the additional ply will be such that it is low for a low relative elongation of between 0% and 0.5%, and at most equal to the greatest modulus of elasticity upon traction of the most extensible working ply, for relative elongations greater than 0.5%, said moduli of elasticity being approximately equal, for a given relative elongation e, to the products of the tangent modulus of elasticity of the reinforcement elements for said elongation e and the volume fraction of metal in the ply.<br>
In a second variant, the lateral parts of the additional plies may also be formed of circumferentially inextensible metallic elements cut so as to form sections of a length very much less than the circumference of the least long ply, but preferably greater than 0.1 times said circumference, the cuts between sections being axially offset relative to each other. Such an embodiment makes it possible to impart, in simple manner, to the lateral parts of the additional ply a modulus which can easily be adjusted (by selecting the gaps between sections of the same series), but which in all cases is less than the modulus of the ply formed of the same metallic elements, but continuous ones, the modulus of the additional ply being measured on a vulcanised ply of cut elements, taken from the tyre.<br>
In a third variant for obtaining a lateral strip having a lower tensile modulus than the tensile modulus of the most extensible working ply, it is advantageous to use as reinforcement elements for said lateral part undulating metallic elements of circum짭ferential orientation, the ratio aA, of the amplitude of undulation to wavelength<br>
being at most 0.09.<br>
In the last two variants cited, the metallic elements are preferably steel cables.<br>
Preferably, the working plies, on either side of the equatorial plane and in the immediate axial extension of the additional ply, are coupled over an axial distance 1 at least equal to 3.5% of the width So, then being decoupled by profiled members of rubber mix at least over the remainder of the width common to said two working plies, the presence of said couplings also permitting the reduction of the tensile<br><br>
stresses acting on the circumferential cables of the edge located closest to the coupling.<br>
The thickness of the decoupling profiled members between working plies, measured level with the ends of the least wide working ply, will be at least equal to two millimetres, and preferably greater than 2.5 mm.<br>
"Coupled plies" is to be understood to mean plies, the respective reinforcement elements of which are separated radially by at most 1.5 mm, said thickness of rubber being measured radially between the respectively upper and lower generatrices of said reinforcement elements.<br>
The working plies generally are of unequal axial widths. Whether the radially outermost working ply is axially less wide than the radially innermost working ply, or whether said radially outermost ply is axially wider than the radially innermost working ply, it is then advantageous for the crown reinforcement to be finished off radially to the outside by at least one additional ply, referred to as a protective ply, of so-called elastic reinforcement elements, oriented relative to the circumferential direction at an angle of between 10째 and 45째 of the same direction as the angle formed by the inextensible elements of the working ply radially adjacent thereto.<br>
An elastic reinforcement element for a protective ply meets the same definition as previously, and has a relative elongation of greater than 2% when subjected to a tensile force of 10% of the breaking load. Said elements are also metal cables made of steel.<br>
The protective ply may have an axial width less than the axial width of the least wide working ply, but advantageously sufficient totally to cover the zone of coupling between the two working crown plies, and all the more advantageously since the tread of the tyre in question comprises a circumferential or quasi-circum짭ferential groove axially arranged radially on the zone of coupling between the two working plies. Said protective ply may also have an axial width greater than the<br><br>
axial width of the least wide working ply, such that it covers the edges of the least wide working ply and, in the case of the radially upper ply as being the least wide, such that it is coupled, in the axial extension of the additional reinforcement, with the widest working crown ply over an axial distance of at least 2% of the width So, then being decoupled, axially to the outside, from said widest working ply by profiled members of a thickness of at least 2 mm. The protective ply formed of elastic reinforcement elements may, in the case referred to above, be firstly possibly decoupled from the edges of said least wide working ply by profiled members of a thickness substantially less than the thickness of the profiled members separating the edges of the two working plies, and secondly have an axial width less or greater than the axial width of the widest crown ply.<br>
Whatever the solution adopted, the crown reinforcement may be finished off, radially to the inside between the carcass reinforcement and the radially inner working ply closest to said carcass reinforcement, by a triangulation ply of inextensible metallic reinforcement elements made of steel, forming with the circumferential direction an angle greater than 60째 and of the same direction as that of the angle formed by the reinforcement elements of the ply radially closest to the carcass reinforcement. Said triangulation ply may have an axial width less than said least wide working ply, but may also have the necessary width sufficient for said ply to be able to be coupled with another ply, be it with the widest working ply or the protective ply radially above the working plies, or with the widest working ply.<br>
The characteristics and advantages of the invention will be better understood with the aid of the following description, which relates to the drawing, which illustrates an example of embodiment in non-limitative manner, and in which the single Figure 1 shows a diagram, viewed in meridian section, of a preferred variant of a crown reinforcement according to the invention.<br>
In Figure 1, the tyre P, of dimension 495/45 R 22.5 X, has an H/S form ratio of 0.45, H being the height of the tyre P on its mounting rim and S its maximum axial<br><br>
width. Said tyre P comprises a radial carcass reinforcement (1) anchored in each bead to at least one bead wire, forming an upturn, and formed by a single ply of metal cables. This carcass reinforcement (1) is hooped by a crown reinforcement (3), formed radially from the inside to the outside:<br>
by a first working ply (32) formed of inextensible 27.23 hooped metal cables, which are continuous over the entire width of the ply and are oriented by an angle a, equal to 18째 in the case illustrated, said ply having an elasticity modulus per unit of width, taking into account the spacing selected between cables, of 5,300 daN/mm ;<br>
surmounting the first working ply (32), by an additional reinforcement (33), formed of<br>
*	a central part (33') in the form of a ply formed of the same inextensible metal cables made of steel, said cables being oriented at 90째 to the circumferential direction, the axially outer edges of said ply (33') being separated from the working crown ply (32) by layers of rubber of low thickness,<br>
*	two lateral parts (33") in the form of plies formed of continuous elastic bimodular metal cables made of steel, such a cable having a low tangent modulus of elasticity upon traction, of the order of 5,000 daN/mm for low relative elongations, for example up to 0.4%, and a modulus, for example greater than 10,000 daN/mm ,<br>
unit of width substantially equal to 4,000 daN/mm2 for relative<br>
which imparts to said lateral part a tangent modulus of elasticity per unit of width substantially equ; elongations greater than 0.6%,<br>
then by a second working ply (34) formed of inextensible metal cables identical to those of the first working ply (32), and forming an angle 棺 opposed to the angle a and, in the case illustrated, equal to said angle a of<br><br>
18째 (but possibly being different from said angle a), with the circum짭ferential direction,<br>
and finally by a final ply (35) of so-called elastic cables oriented relative to the circumferential direction by an angle y of the same direction as the angle (3 and equal to said angle |3 (but possibly being different from said angle), this final ply being a protective ply formed of elastic metal cables.<br>
The axial width L32 of the first working ply (32) is equal to 0.87 times the maximum axial width So of the centre section of the carcass reinforcement (1), namely 416 mm, which, for a tyre of conventional shape, is substantially less than the width Li of the tread, which is equal in the case in question to 430 mm. The axial width L34 of the second working ply (34) is equal to 0.83 times the axial width So, namely 400 mm. As for the overall axial width L33 of the additional ply (33), it is equal to 320 mm. Said width is broken down as follows: the central ply (33') formed of radial cables has a width L'33 of 240 mm, which represents 50% of the width So, each lateral ply (33") formed of undulating circumferential cables has an axial width L"33 of 40 mm, the width of a ply with undulating cables being measured from peak to peak of the undulation. The final crown ply (35), referred to as a protective ply, has a width L35 substantially equal to 370 mm.<br>
The two working plies (32) and (34), on either side of the equatorial plane and axially in the extension of the additional ply (33), are coupled over an axial width 1, equal in this case to 15 mm: the cables of the first working ply (32) and the cables of the second working ply (34), over the axial width 1 of the coupling of the two plies, are separated radially from each other by a layer of rubber, the thickness of which is minimal and corresponds to twice the thickness of the rubber calendering layer of the hooped metal 27.23 cables of which each working ply (32, 34) is formed, i.e. 0.8 mm. Over the remaining width common to the two working plies, that is to say, approximately 20 mm on either side, the two working plies (32) and (34) are separated by a rubber profiled member (4) of substantially triangular shape, the thickness of said profiled member (4) increasing from the axial end of the<br><br>
coupling zone to the end of the least wide working ply, reaching a thickness of 4 mm at said end. Said profiled member (4) has a sufficient width to radially cover the end of the widest working ply (32) which, in this case, is the working ply radially closest to the carcass reinforcement. The crown of the tyre is finished off by a tread (5) joined to the beads by two sidewalls (6), and the triangulation ply, radially adjacent to the carcass reinforcement (1) on either side of the equatorial plane, moves away therefrom axially towards the outside, said ply being joined to the carcass reinforcement (1) by means of triangular profiled members (7) of rubber.<br>
The second solution tested corresponds to the use, for circumferential reinforce짭ment elements for the lateral parts (33") of the additional ply (33), of inextensible metal cables made of steel, such as the cables used in the working crown plies, but cut so as to have sections of cables, the circumferential length of which is equal to 1/6 of the circumferential length of the ply. Said additional ply, in the case in question, has a tangent modulus of elasticity upon traction, per unit of width and for a relative elongation of 0.4%, deemed to be equal to 3,500 daN/mm .<br>
The third solution corresponds to the use, for circumferential reinforcement elements for the lateral parts (33") of the additional ply (33), of inextensible metal cables made of steel, such as those used in the working crown plies, but undulating, the ratio a貫. of the undulations, a being the amplitude of undulation and 貫 its<br>
wavelength, being at most 0.09, said ratio permitting sufficient elongation of said cables in the case of travelling under strong drift while satisfactorily reinforcing the axial parts of the crown reinforcement in the vicinity of the coupling widths between working crown plies.<br><br>

elongation of between 0% and 0.4%, and at most equal to the greatest modulus<br>
of elasticity upon traction of the most extensible working ply (32, 34), for<br>
relative elongations greater than 0.4%.<br>
6.	A tyre as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the inextensible<br>
reinforcement elements of the plies (32, 34, 33') are preferably metal cables<br>
made of steel.<br>
7.	A tyre as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the working plies (32, 34), on either side of the equatorial plane and in the immediate axial extension of the additional ply (33), are coupled over an axial distance 1 at least equal to 3.5% of the width So, then being decoupled by profiled members (4) of rubber mix at least over the remainder of the width common to said two working plies (32, 34).<br>
8.	A tyre as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the crown reinforcement (3) is finished off radially to the outside by at least one additional ply (35), referred to as a protective ply, of so-called elastic reinforcement elements which are oriented relative to the circumferential direction at an angle of between 10째 and 45째 and of the same direction as the angle formed by the inextensible elements of the working ply (32, 34) radially adjacent thereto.<br>
9.	A tyre as claimed in claim 8, wherein the elastic reinforcement elements of the protective ply (plies) (35) are metal cables made of steel.<br><br>
10.	A tyre as claimed in claim 8, wherein the protective ply (35) has an axial<br>
width L35 greater than the axial width of the least wide radially upper working<br>
ply (34), such that it covers the edges of said least wide working ply and such<br>
that it is coupled, in the axial extension of the additional reinforcement (33),<br>
with the widest working crown ply (32) over an axial distance of at least 2% of<br>
the width So, then being decoupled, axially to the outside, from said widest<br>
working ply (32) by profiled members of a thickness of at least 2 mm.<br>
11.	A tyre as claimed in one of claims 1 to 5, wherein the crown<br>
reinforcement (3) is finished off, radially to the inside between the carcass<br>
reinforcement (1) and the radially inner working ply (32) closest to said carcass<br>
reinforcement (1), by a triangulation ply of inextensible metallic reinforcement<br>
elements made of steel, forming with the circumferential direction an angle<br>
greater than 60째 and of the same direction as that of the angle formed by the<br>
reinforcement elements of the ply (32) radially closest to the carcass<br>
reinforcement (1).<br>
