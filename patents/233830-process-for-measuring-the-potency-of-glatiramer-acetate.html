				<td> FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to methods of standardizing the measurement of the potency of glatiramer acetate based on specific recognition of the glatiramer acetate by T cells.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
It is desirable to standarize the measurement of the potency of pharmaceutical compositions as there is an optimum potency and quality of active component that is effective in treating the disease for which it is administered.<br>
Glatiramer acetate (GA, also known as Copolymer-1 (Physician's Desk Reference), Copolymer 1, Cop-1 or COPAXONE®), is an approved drug for the treatment of multiple sclerosis (MS) . Glatiramer acetate consists of the acetate salts of synthetic polypeptides, containing four naturally occurring amino acids (Physician's Desk Reference): L-glutamic acid, L-alanine, L-tyrosine, and L-lysine (Physician's Desk Reference) with an<br><br>
average molar fraction of L-glutamic acid:  0.129-0.153; L-alanine: 0.392-0,462; L-tyrosine: 0.086-0.100; L-lysine: 0.300-0.374, respectively.   The average molecular weight of glatiratner acetate is 4,700 - 11,000 daltons (Physician's Desk Reference). Chemically, glatiramer acetate is designated L-glutamic acid polymer with L-alanine, L-lysine and L-tyrosine, acetate (salt) (Physician's Desk Reference).  Its structural formula is:<br>
(Glu, Ala, Lys, Tyr) x.xCH3COOH<br>
(CsH9N04.C3H,NO,.C6H14N202.C9H11NO3)x.xC2H402<br>
CAS - 147245-92-9<br>
(Physician's Desk Reference).  Glatiramer acetate is also written as: poly[L-Glu13-15, L-Ala39-46, L-Tyr8-6-10, L-Lys30-37] nCH3COOH.<br>
Glatiramer acetate was shown to suppress experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE)  an experimental model for multiple sclerosis (MS) in various animal species (Lando et al. , 1979; Aharoni, 1993) . Studies of murine EAE suggested that the protection against EAE is mediated by T cell activity (Aharoni, 1993) . This protection from active induction of EAE by mouse spinal cord homogenate, in which several auto-antigens are involved, could be adoptively transferred to normal recipients by injection of glatiramer acetate-specific T suppressor cells (Aharoni, 1993) . In phase III clinical trials, daily subcutaneous injections of glatiramer acetate were found to slow progression of disability and reduce the relapse rate in exacerbating-remitting multiple sclerosis (Johnson, 1987) . Processes of manufacturing glatiramer acetate are described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,849,550 and 5,800,808 and PCT International Publication No. WO 00/05250.<br>
It is commonly accepted that a high level of antigen specificity is a feature of T cell activation.  The T cells of the immune system recognize immunogemc peptides complexed to the major histocompatibility complex  (MHC)  class  II  or I molecules, expressed on antigen presenting cells (APCs).  The specificity<br><br>
of antigen recognition by T cells is defined by several parameters: 1) affinity of the T cell receptor to the MHC peptide complex; 2) primary sequence of the antigenic peptide; and 3) synergistic effects of certain amino acid combinations within the antigenic peptide. Based on current knowledge on the mechanism of action of glatiramer acetate, it is believed that the biological activity of glatiramer acetate in MS is mediated by immunomodulation of T cell activity.<br>

EXPERIMENTAL EXAMPLES GENERAL PROCEDURE OUTLINE<br>
Mice were immunized with 250 µg GA RS in CFA. GA RS was produced as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,800,808 or PCT International Publication No, WO 00/05250. The GA RS was chosen based on the chemical and biological properties being in the midrange of Copaxone® as described above. After 9-11 days, a primary culture of LN cells was prepared, and the cells were incubated with various concentrations of GA RS and with test samples. Following 18-21 hours of incubation at 37°C in a humidified CO2 incubator, the culture media were collected and the level of IL-2 was measured by ELISA. The T-cell response to each DS batch were tested at two concentrations (within the linear range), and the % potency of the DS batch was calculated relative to that of the GA RS batch. <br>

Preparation  of  GA RS  emulsion<br>
Equal volumes of GA RS solution (5 mg/ml) and CFA were mixed. The mixture was transferred into a sterile glass syringe connected to a second glass syringe through a luer bridge. The mixture was mixed well by being transferred from one syringe to another until the mixture was well emulsified. A stable emulsion was confirmed when a drop of the emulsion floated on water without dispersing.<br>
Injection<br>
The GA RS emulsion was transferred into an insulin syringe. Then, 100 µl of the emulsion (250 µg GA per mouse) were injected into four footpads of each naive mouse (about 25 µl into each footpad) , The immunized mice were used for the in vitro test 9-11 days following immunization.<br>
Preparation of a primary culture of LN cells<br>
The primary culture of LN cells was prepared 9-11 days following immunization, according to the following procedure:<br>
Surgical procedure for removal of LN cells<br>
The UV lamp was turned on 20 minutes before commencing work in the laminar hood and turned off when work began. Prior to placing any reagents under the hood, the working surface was cleaned with a 70% ethanol solution. Enriched DCCM1 medium was prepared. The enriched DCCM1 and the RPMI medium were pre-warmed at 37°C prior to use. The mice were sacrificed by cervical dislocation. Each mouse was placed on its back and fastened to a support platform. The abdomen was sprayed with 70% alcohol and a middle incision was made (a 2 cm-long incision was usually sufficient;) . The skin was intersected towards the hind legs and LN was .located from the hind and forelegs. The LN was transferred into a sterile petri dish containing about 5 ml sterile RPMI medium and the LN cells were teased out by a sterile syringe plunger. The sterile syringe was used to collect the cells' suspension from the petri dish (the collection of tissue debris was avoided by using sterile needles). The cells' suspension were transferred into a 50 ml sterile tube.<br><br>
Cell counting: Example procedure for counting LN cells derived from 5 immunized mice<br>
The cells' tube were filled with RPMI medium up to 40 ml. The LN cells were centrifuged at 200 xg for 10 minutes at room temperature (15-25°C). The pellet was re-suspended with 40 ml RPMI. Two aliquots of 50 µl were drawn each from the cells' suspension diluted 4-fold with 150 µl of 0.1% Trypan blue in a microtest well. The aliquots were mixed well by pipetting gently up and down. The hemacytometer was covered with a cover slip. A 50-200 µl pipettman was used to load both aliquots into the upper and lower chambers of the hemacytometer, one suspension in each chamber. The mixture was allowed to settle within the chambers for about 2 minutes. Care was taken to not introduce bubbles into the chamber. The mixture (cell suspension + Trypan blue) was allowed to cover the entire surface of the chamber. If bubbles were present in the chamber, or if it was overloaded, the hemacytometer was cleaned completely and dried with wipes and the chambers were reloaded.<br>
The viable cells were counted in the central square (composed of 25 large squares of 16 small squares each, see Fig. 3} of the upper and lower chambers. The viable cells did not absorb Trypan blue and were therefore characterized by a clear appearance. However, dead cells were permeable to Trypan blue and appeared blue in color. Cells appearing on the border of the central square were only counted if a portion of the cell was actually within the central square. If a cell was on the border, and not at all within the central square, it was not counted. The cells' density was calculated using the following equation:<br>
Average number viable cells (both chambers) x 4 x 104 = cells<br>
ml<br>
The cells were centrifuged at 200 xg for 10 minutes at room temperature.  The cells were re-suspended to a density of 1xlO7<br><br>
cells/ml with enriched DCCM1.<br>
In vitro bioassay<br>
The in vivo bioassay was performed in a 24-well, flat-bottomed tissue culture test plate at a final volume of 1 ml.<br>
Preparation of GA RS calibration curve<br>
One aliquot of the 1 mg/ml GA RS stock was thawed. The GA RS stock solution was diluted to 100 µg/ml (10-fold) with enriched DCCMl medium and filtered through a 0.2 µ. cellulose acetate filter. Six serial dilutions of the GA RS solution with enriched DCCMl medium were prepared between 2-50 µg/ml, as described by the example in Table 2.<br>
Table 2: Example for preparation of GA RS dilutions<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Preparation of GA D.S dilutions<br>
About 10-20 mg of GA DS from the batch to be tested was weighed accurately and dissolved with ddH20 to 1.2 mg/ml. The OD minus blank of the solution was measured at 275 nm. The OD of the sample was adjusted to approx. 1.03 with ddH20 to obtain a stock solution of 1 mg/ml of GA. The stock solution of 100 µg/ml was prepared with enriched DCCMl and filtered through a 0.2 µ cellulose acetate filter.  The stock solution was diluted to 10 and 20 µg/ml as described in Table 2 for the RS batch.<br>
Assay reaction<br>
The following were added to the 24 -well flat-bottomed tissue culture plate (see an example of a plate template below) :<br>
GA RS<br>
0.5  ml  of  LN  cells  (final  density,  for  example,  5xl06 cells/well).<br>
0.5 ml of each GA RS dilution, thus the final concentrations of GA RS in the wells were 25, 15, 10, 5, 2.5 and 1 µg/ml .<br>
GA DS samples<br>
0.5  ml  of  LN  cells  (final  density,  for  example,  5xl06 cells/well).<br>
0.5 ml of each sample dilution, thus the final concentrations of the test sample in the well were 5 and 10 µg/ml.<br>
Each test included the following controls:<br>
1)	Negative  control  -  LN cells  incubated with a  control<br>
peptide:<br>
0.5 ml of LN cells (final density 5xl06 cells/well) 0.5 ml of MBP peptide solution (20 µg/ml) in  enriched DCCM1 (final concentration 10 µg/ml)<br>
2)	Positive  control  -  LN  cells  stimulated  with  Con A<br>
(non-specific T cell stimulant):<br>
0,5 ml of LN cells (final density 5xl06 cells/well) 0.5 ml of Con A (5 µg/ml) in enriched DCCM1 (final concentration 2.5 µg/ml)<br><br>
Example for a plate template<br><br>

GA RS* - Glatiramer acetate reference standard.<br>
The density of the cells was changed depending upon their response to GA. The cultures were kept at 37°C in a humidified 5% CO2 incubator for 18-21 hrs. The plate was centrifuged at 200 xg for 10 minutes at room temperature. The supernatants were collected into cryotubes. The supernatants were divided into working aliquots to avoid repeated freezing/thawing of the samples. The supernatants were stored at -20°C for up to one week. The hood was cleaned with 70% ethanol solution and dried with Kirn wipes. The gloves were removed and the hands were immediately washed with disinfectant.<br>
ELISA for IL-2 detection<br>
All samples were tested in triplicate. Each plate run included the following:<br>
l)IL-2 standard curve - including at least 6 non-zero<br>
concentrations of IL-2.<br>
2)	Blank<br>
+ 1st antibody, without IL-2 standard, + 2nd antibody (zero point).<br>
3)	Samples<br>
The culture media of GA RS, test samples and controls were diluted with enriched DCCM1 as follows:<br><br>
a)	A 2-fold dilution of the 1 and 2.5 µg/ml GA RS<br>
sample and of the negative control sample;<br>
b)	5-10 fold dilutions of the 5-25 µg/ml GA RS samples<br>
and of the test samples; and<br>
c)	15-20 fold dilution of the positive control sample<br>
(Con A) .<br>
The ELISA protocol for measuring IL-2 levels was performed according to the manufacturer's recommendations.  If the optical density of any sample reached the upper/lower limits of the plate reader, the sample was re-analyzed at a higher/lower dilution, respectively.<br>
Calculations and acceptance criteria<br>
ELISA Measurements<br>
The mean absorbance was subtracted of the blank sample (zero IL-2 standard point) from the absorbance of standards, samples and controls and calculated for each set of triplicate the mean (absorbance-blank), standard deviation (SD), and relative standard deviation (RSD).<br>
Sample Replicates<br>
Whenever there was a suspected outlier, it was necessary to ensure that the outlier was statistically based, in order to elucidate any potential problems that may have affected the overall results. If the RSD between triplicate measures was higher than 10% and the average OD-blank was &gt; 0.300, outlier rejection was applied using the Dixon Q-Test. The Dixon Q-Test was used to reject possible outliers when the relevant acceptance criteria was not satisifed in a test based on replicates. The outlier test was applicable only to replicate measurements of the same standard solution. For less than 10 observations, only 1<br><br>
outlier was able to be determined and eliminated. This procedure expanded the use of the Dixon Q-Test in rejecting outliers from any number of replicate measurements between 3 and 7, with a confidence level of 95%.<br>
Procedure<br><br>
The suspected outlier was designated were labeled in reference to the suspected outlier, e.g., X2 was the value next to the suspected outlier, X3 was second value from the suspected outlier, Xk was the farthest from the suspected outlier and Xk^ was the value second from the farthest, etc.<br>
For 3-7 replicates, the following equation was used: X2 - X1<br>
X+ - X1.<br>
The appropriate k value was determined from the calculated<br>
fraction using Table 3.<br>
Table 3: k Value<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
If no outlier was identified by the Dixon Q-Test but the % difference between 2 out of the 3 replicates was not more than 10%, the closest 2 replicates were used for calculating the % potency. Otherwise, the ELISA test was repeated for this sample.<br>
Outlier rejection from samples with OD 
Blank Samples<br>
The absorbance of each of the blank samples was 
IL-2 Standard Curve<br>
The IL-2 standard curve was graphed according to the manufacturer's recommendations. IL-2 standards that exhibit poor sensitivity or sample processing error were able to be rejected if a minimum of six non-zero concentration IL-2 standards remained in the curve. The back-calculated standard concentration had a relative error (RE) greater than 20% for the lower calibration point and ±15% for all other concentrations. The IL-2 calibration curve was constructed from at least six non-zero concentration points (at least 17 calibration points), covering the range of expected concentrations. The standard curve range was able to be truncated if the high or low concentrations failed. The R2 of the linear regression curve was &gt; 0.97.<br>
Assay Controls<br>
The concentration of IL-2 was calculated in all samples from the linear regression plot of the IL-2 standard, utilizing the equation of the linear regression curve. The final concentration of IL-2 was calculated in all samples by multiplying by the samples' dilution factor.<br><br>
Negative Control (MBP Peptide)<br>
The final concentration of IL-2 in at least 2 out of the 3 replicates of the negative control sample was below the levels of IL-2 measured for the lowest calibration point of the GA RS curve.<br>
Positive Control (Con A)<br>
The final concentration of IL-2 in at least 2 out of the 3 replicates of the positive control sample was similar to or above the level of IL-2 in the highest calibration point of the GA RS curve.<br>
Calculation of the relative potency of GA DS batches<br>
GA RS curve<br>
The GA RS curve was plotted on a log-log scale, with log IL-2 concentration on the y-axis and log GA RS concentration on the x-axis. The calibration curve was constructed from at least five non-zero concentrations (at least 14 calibration points). Calibration points were rejected as described for the IL-2 standard points. The best-fit regression curve was computed through the standard points. The R2 was &gt; 0.97. The slope (ß) was &gt; 0.77.<br>
Parallelism analysis<br>
The dose-response curve of each test sample was plotted on a log-log scale, with log IL-2 concentration on the y-axis and log GA DS concentration on the x-axis. The best fit regression curve was computed through the sample points. The slope (ß*) was within the following range:<br><br>
ß x 0.635 
If ß* was out of limits, the in-vitro test was repeated in duplicate (two separate sample preparations). If ß* in one re-test failed, the batch was rejected. If ß* in both re-tests was within limits, the % potency and 95% fiducial limits were determined.<br>
Estimation of the % potency and the fiducial limits The estimate of the random error to be used to determine the Fiducial Limits (which have a 95% probability of including the "true % potency") was obtained by using ANOVA. This statistical technique splits the total variation between observed responses into separate components, namely:<br>
1.	due to linear dose-response	<br>
2.	due to the mean effect of preparation    <br>
3.	due to deviation from parallelism<br>
4.	due to deviation from linearity.<br>
5.	due to residual between-replicate variation.<br>
The components 3 and 4 were included in the random error term due to non-significant deviations from linearity and parallelism, respectively. The total sum of squares was partitioned into 3 components (SS-Regression, SS-Preparation and SS-Error), the appropriate number of degrees of freedom and the F-test for significance.<br>
The % potency of the tested batch was calculated and the 95% fiducial limits for the estimated potency as described below:<br><br>
Computational Algorithm for the Calculation of Relative Potency and 95% Fiducial Limits.<br>
Step 1:  Compute the transformation of the given data (GA. Batch and GA. RS.) Into log10 scale :<br>
Yw= Iog10(responsew); i=1,... nk XKI Iog10(doseki);         i=1,..., nk<br>
where k=1,2 is a preparation index of GA. batch and GA. RS, respectively;<br>
n1 and n2 are the total numbers of measurements performed for the GA. batch and GA. RS, respectively.<br>
Thus, N= n1+ n2 is an overall total number of observations.<br>
Step 2:   Calculate the common slope for the linear regression based on all measured data points via.the formula:<br><br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where Y is an overall mean value of Iog10(response); X is an overall mean value of Iog10(dose).<br>
Step 3:   Calculate the sum of squares due to regression on Iog10(dose) as:<br><br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Step 4:   Calculate the random error sum of squares as:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where Yk, Xk. are mean Iog10(response) and Iogl0(dose) values, respectively, of preparation k.<br>
Step 5:  Calculate the Mean Square Error term as following:<br>
DFERR(random error degrees of freedom) =N-3;<br>
Step 6:   Use the statistical tables of t-distribution In order to find the appropriate value of t-statistic:<br>
t«t(0.976, DFewl).<br>
Step 7:   Calculate the point estimate of the relative potency as following:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
Step 8:   Calculate the expression denoted by C via the formula:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Step 9 :   Calculate the logarithms of lower and upper limits of 95% Fiducial Interval:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Step 10: Transform the values computed in the previous step Into original scale by taking of anti-logarithms of the resulting log-limits and multiply by 100%.<br>
The estimated potency of GA DS batch was not less than 80% and not more than 125% of the stated potency. The fiducial limits of error (P=0.95) of the estimated potency were less than 70% and not more than 143% of the stated potency. If the batch was outside the above limits, the in-vitro test was repeated in duplicate. If the results of both re-tests were within specifications, the batch was acceptable. If one re-test failed, the batch was rejected.<br>

EXAMPLE 2: DEVELOPMENT OP STANDARD PROCEDURE OF EXAMPLE 1<br>
Experiment 2A: Profile of cytokines secreted from GA RS-specific<br>
T cells<br>
The LN cells were derived from female (SJL x BALB/OF1 mice immunized with 250 µg GA RS in CFA 9-11 days earlier were cultured in the presence of various concentrations of GA RS. The cells were incubated with GA RS for 18-24 hours at 37°C in a 5% C02 humidified incubator. Subsequently, the cultures were centrifuged and the supernatants collected and assayed for cytokines by ELISA.<br>
The ELISA was performed using biotinylated antibodies specific to the  cytokine  and  strepavidin-horseradish  peroxidase  (HRP) conjugated for detection.  Each plate ran included blank control (first and second antibodies without the cytokine standard). Each plate ran also included quality control (QC) samples (three concentrations of cytokine standard within the assay's linear range).  Each in vitro test included a positive control (Con A, a non-specific T-cell stimulant) and a negative control (no GA or any other antigen).  All the cytokines were measured after 18-24 hours of incubation.  Levels of TGF-p, IL-10 and IL-4 were tested again after 72 hours of incubation.  The results are shown in Table 4.<br><br>
Table 4: Cytokine profile<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In Table 4, the maximal levels measured for each cytokine are presented in arbitrary units: (-)  400 pg/ml . Table 4 shows that in response to GA RS in culture, the LN cells secreted IL-2, INF-Y, IL-10 and IL-6, while TNF-a, IL-4, IL-13 and TGF-ß were not detected in the culture media. These results indicate that the cytokines produced by the GA RS-specific T cells are of Th0 type. It should be noted that a Th0 profile was observed in different immunization protocols, i.e., immunization with IFA or with low doses of GA.<br>
Since IL-2 is a good marker for T cell activation, and since the secretion of IL-2 in response to GA RS was very reproducible, with a linear dose-response relationship, IL-2 seemed to be the optimum cytokine to measure T cell activation.<br>
Experiment 2B: Optimization of the immunization procedure<br>
Several experiments were performed to establish the optimal immunization protocol. The first experiment tested the effect of GA RS (immunizing antigen) dose on T-cell responses in the LN and in the spleen. Two groups of 10 mice each were immunized with either 250 µg GA in CFA (group 1) (as in the EAE blocking test) or with 10 µg GA in CFA (group 2) . Primary cultures were prepared from both the LN and the spleens of the immunized mice. The cultures were incubated overnight with various doses of GA RS and afterwards the culture media were collected and assayed for IL-2 as in Experiment 2A. The results in Fig. 4 clearly show that in both immunization protocols the levels of IL-2 secreted from LN cells are high compared to those secreted from spleen cells. Based on these results it was decided to use primary cultures of LN cells for the assay. In addition, the doses of GA RS injected into mice did not affect the T cell response in culture. Both LN and spleen cells secreted similar quantities of IL-2 regardless of the immunizing dose of GA RS. This indicates that the immunization procedure is robust, and that even major variations in the immunizing dose of GA RS do not affect the immunological outcome.<br>
For further optimization of the immunization protocol, one group was injected with 250 µg GA RS in CFA and the second group with 10 mg GA in ICFA. The dose of GA RS in the second group was higher since ICFA, a weaker adjuvant, was used. Ten days later, the response of the LN cells from both groups to GA RS was tested in vitro. Fig. 5 shows that immunization with 250 µg GA RS in CFA induced a much stronger response in culture, although a much lower dose of antigen was used.<br>
Based on these findings, and on the fact that 250 µg/mouse of GA in CFA is very effective in blocking EAE (at least 80% blocking<br>
of EAE in this mouse strain) , 250 jig/mouse of GA in CFA appears to be the optimum dose.<br>
Specific T cells were usually generated within approximately 10 days, following a single immunization with CFA. Fig. 6 shows the response of the LN cells to GA RS in culture, prepared 9, 10 and 11 days following immunization. Since the dose-response of IL-2 secretion was similar on all days, the immunization period may last for 9-11 days.<br>
Experiment 2C: Optimization of the in vitro test conditions<br>
Several experiments were performed to establish the optimal protocol for the in-vitro reaction. These studies included optimization of culture conditions, incubation time, stability of IL-2 in test samples and stability of GA RS at -20°C.<br>
i)Culture media<br>
Cultures of mouse lymphoid cells are usually maintained in RPMI medium, supplemented with 1% normal mouse serum. Normal mouse serum may contain endogenous IL-2 that can be detected by the anti mouse IL-2 monoclonal antibodies used in the ELISA kit. In addition, the use of different lots of normal serum may increase the inter-day variations of the in vitro test. To avoid cross-contamination with endogenous mouse IL-2, and to reduce the inter-day variations of the method, the responses of the GA-specific T cells were tested in 4 different culture media: 1) RPMI + 1% normal mouse serum (NMS) ; 2) RPMI + 1% fetal bovine sera (FBS) (bovine IL-2 is not recognized by the anti mouse IL-2 used in the ELISA kit); 3) Biotarget (serum-free media produced exclusively by BeitHaemek, Israel) ; and 4) DCCM1 (serum-free media produced by various manufacturers).<br><br>
Fig. 7 shows the results of a representative experiment that compares the response of LN cells to GA RS in different culture media. The best responses were observed when serum-free media were used. The dose-response range was left-shifted in the absence of serum. This can be explained by previous studies showing that GA binds to albumin and to other serum proteins. This binding may reduce the availability of GA in culture to interactions with APCs, and thus higher concentrations of GA are required to stimulate the T cells. Based on these results, the optimum medium seems to be DCCM-1 medium.<br>
ii) Kinetics of IL-2 secretion<br>
IL-2 is an autocrine and paracrine growth factor that is essential for clonal T-cell proliferation and for functional properties of B cells and macrophages. Following stimulation of the culture with GA RS, IL-2 is secreted by the activated GA-specific T cells and is subsequently consumed by the LN cells. Kinetic studies of IL-2 secretion were performed in an attempt to determine the optimal (peak) time for collection of the supernatants, following stimulation with GA. LN cells were cultured and incubated with various concentrations of GA RS at 37°C in a humidified C02 incubator. At the intervals indicated in Fig. 8, aliquots were sampled and the cells were removed by centrifugation. The supernatants were kept at 20°C and at the end of the experiment were assayed for IL-2 by ELISA.<br>
Fig. 8 shows that the peak of IL-2 levels in the culture media is between 18-21 hours. The reduction in IL-2 levels in samples collected from 24-48 hours can be explained by the consumption of IL-2 by the LN cells. Thus, the optimum time for supernatant collection appears to be after 18-21 hours of incubation.<br><br>
iii) Measurement of cytokines<br>
The method relies on accurate measurements of IL-2 in samples of GA RS and test samples. During the experiments, the levels of IL-2 were measured by OptEIA (Pharmingen, Cat. # 2614KI) - an ELISA kit specific for mouse IL-2. This ELISA kit is very sensitive and the results are accurate and reproducible.<br>
iv) Stability of IL-2 in test samples at -20°C<br>
In most of the experiments performed, the culture media were collected and kept at -20°C before being analyzed by the ELISA. Preliminary studies of the stability of IL-2 in culture media show that the cytokine is stable for one week at -20°C (Fig. 9) . Therefore, the culture media of the in-vitro test samples can be kept at -20°C for up to one week prior to measuring IL-2. The results of this experiment also demonstrated that the ELISA results are very reproducible -- the. levels of IL-2 measured in the samples were practically identical in two ELISA plate runs performed on two different days one week apart.<br>
v)Stability of GA RS solution at -20°C<br>
To test the stability of GA RS solution at -20°C, the dose-response of a GA RS solution was tested immediately following preparation, and after storage for 5 months at -20°C. Fig. 10 shows that there is practically no difference in the dose-response curves of GA RS solution before and after storage for 5 months at -20°C. Therefore, aliquots of GA RS solution can be prepared and kept at -20°C for at least 5 months before use.<br><br>
Experiment 2D: Determination of Linear Range of GA RS Calibration Curves<br>
The statistical validation was carried out based on GA RS calibration curves calculated and evaluated separately for each one out of 21 plates received for the analysis. These 21 samples were gathered at different times over an approximately four-month period. The GA concentration range for the given plates varied from 0.25 to 50 µg/ml. The following validation characteristics derived from the GA RS calibration curves constituted the main concern of the analysis:<br>
1.	Optimal transformation to ensure wider limits of the linear<br>
range;<br>
2.	Determination of the linear range limits;<br>
3.	Overall criteria for accepting a calibration curve;<br>
4.	Estimation of assay accuracy and precision;<br>
5.	Assessment of duplicate reliability  (see the paragraph<br>
below).<br>
The nature of the experiments was such that there were typically 3 replicates (triplicates) at each calibration point. However, in some instances, when a triplicate measurement could not be provided, the assessment of duplicate reliability became essential.<br>
Linearity of GA Dose-Response Relationship<br>
The basis of most aspects of the validation discussion presented below was a linear regression model that related the IL-2 concentration (pg/ml) to the GA concentration (µg/ml) . The assumption of the linearity of this relationship was necessary for the appropriate fitting of the linear regression model. The data was plotted in a Linear-Linear scale. The same relationship<br>
was transformed into Log-Log scale, as well as a Log-Linear scale, and a Log-Square Root scale. The Log-Log transformation demonstrated the most suitable linear features. Thus, the chosen form of the regression model was the Log-Log one:<br>
Loglo (IL-2 cone) = a + ß* Log10 (GA conc) + error<br>
The response variable was a log-transformed mean of the 3 replicates measured at each calibration point. This model was fitted to each calibration sample and the appropriate statistics (R2, intercept, and slope) were calculated for each fitted curve. The value of R2 reflected the ratio of the residual sum of squares (RSS) to the total sum of squares (TSS) via the formula:<br>
R2 = 1-RSS/TSS<br>
Linear Range Determination<br>
The linear range was determined based on the following criteria:<br>
1.	Visual inspection of plotted log10 (IL-2 cone) vs. log10 (GA<br>
cone) ;<br>
2.	The regression influence diagnostics, such as Cook's known<br>
in the art distance statistic;<br>
3.	Evaluation of the variation of the precision and accuracy<br>
values calculated for the calibration curves for several<br>
potential  linear  range  definitions provided  a visual<br>
evaluation of the linearity of the relationship.  There was<br>
no evidence of non-linearity of the relationship inside of<br>
the chosen linear range 1-25 µg/ml.<br><br>
Experiment 2E: Determination of Criteria for GA RS Standard Curve<br>
Validation parameters derived from GA RS calibration curves, fitted within selected limits (1-25 µg/ml) of the linear range, were determined to be the following:<br>
1.	R2 of the linear regression fits of log10 (IL-2 cone) to log10<br>
(GA cone) for each plate in the study;<br>
2.	Slopes and intercepts for these straight line fits;<br>
3.	Accuracy calculated at each calibration point for each<br>
plate; and<br>
4.   Precision calculated at each calibration point for every plate .<br>
In order to compute accuracy and precision, each calibration curve was used to calibrate (back-calculate) the GA Concentrations given the values of IL-2 concentration:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The basic measure of (in) accuracy used was the percent difference between the mean of the estimates of concentration and the true concentration in the triplicate samples:<br>
inaccuracy = ([Mean (Xi.back) - GA conc.]/GA cone.) * 100%.<br>
The basic measure of precision used was the relative standard deviation  (RSD  or  CV)  of  the  triplicate  estimates  of<br>
concentration :<br>
precision = CV(Xi.back) = [Std. Dev. (Xi.back) / Mean (Xi.back) ] * 100%. The goal of the analysis was to propose acceptance criteria for<br><br>
the fitted calibration curve which ensured that the accuracy and precision of the method were adequate. The acceptance criteria were based on the R2 and the slope of the GA RS calibration curve. About 80% of the plates could be characterized by small inaccuracy values (
1.	High R2 values (&gt;0.98);<br>
2.	Relatively high slope values,  reflecting dose response<br>
relationships (&gt;0.78 in 15 of 16 plates) .<br>
Since the majority of calibration curves were characterized by relatively high R2 (mean =0.99) and by relatively steep slopes (mean = 0.87), in contrast to the excluded plates which had both relatively low R2 (mean = 0.94) and rather flat slopes (mean = 0.72), the overall acceptance criteria for calibration curves were considered in terms of R2 and slope. The simple rule defining the acceptance parameters was based on the computation of cut-off points for the slope and R2 separately and located them mid-way between the maximum value for rejected curves (max_R2 = 0.95 max_slope = 0.77) and the minimum value for accepted curves (min_R2 = 0.98 min_slope = 0.77). Thus, the acceptance criteria were derived as follows:<br>
1.	R2 &gt; 0.97;<br>
2.	Slope 2:0.77.<br>
These criteria were applied to at least five different (triplicate) concentrations for fitting the calibration curve within the range 1-25 µg/ml of GA concentration. Additionally, the range of intercept values was between 1.42 - 1.78, mean = 1.58. This range was similar for the 16 eligible and the 5 removed plates.<br><br>
Accuracy and precision were calculated for each curve, and for each concentration among those on the plate. These individual values (for each curve and concentration) were also averaged over:<br>
1.	Different concentrations for each curve;<br>
2.	Different curves for each concentration; and<br>
3.	Over all curves and concentrations.<br>
The relevant conclusion was that for GA RS calibration curves based on at least five different calibration points in the linear range 1-25 µg/ml, when the calibration curve was restricted to having R2 &gt; 0.97 and slope &gt; 0.77, the resultant average accuracy and precision was estimated as:<br>
1.	The mean (± SD) accuracy value for the method was: 8.0% ±<br>
2.3%; and<br>
2.	The mean (± SD) precision value for the method was: 2.9% ±<br>
1.7%.<br>
Reliability Assessment of GA RS Calibration Curves Based on Duplicate Measurements<br>
A comparison of the assay's accuracy and precision descriptive statistics was performed in order to assess the reliability of GA RS calibration curves fitted using duplicate measurements at each calibration point. In addition, the individual accuracy and precision values (for each curve and concentration) for all three possible selections of duplicate measurements, out of the given triplicate, were studied. When concentrating on those curves that satisfied the acceptance criteria described in the previous section and fitted within the limits of the defined linear range 1-25 µg/ml, it was evident that when a triplicate measurement can not be provided for some reasons, it can be successfully<br><br>
substituted by duplicate measurement.<br>
Table 5: Accuracy and Precision Descriptive Statistics Summary<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The mean (+ SD) accuracy and precision of the method based on triplicates were 8.0% ± 2.3% and 2.9 % ± 1.7%, respectively<br>
(Table 5).<br>
The mean (±SD) accuracy and precision of the method based on duplicates were:<br>
1.	Accuracy: 8.1% + 2.8%; Precision: 2.5% + 1.7%;<br>
2.	Accuracy: 8.0% + 2.5%; Precision: 2.9% ± 2.1%; and<br>
3.	Accuracy: 8.4% + 2.8%; Precision: 2.4% + 1.5%.<br><br>
Experiment 2F: Determination of Statistical Relationship<br>
It was found that the mean (in) accuracy of the method is 8.0% with SD=2.3%. The aim was to develop a reliable test for the slope comparison of two log(dose)-log(response) lines of a new GA batch vs. GA RS. The test took into account the (in)accuracy of the above-mentioned method. The highest limit of the approximate 95% individual tolerance region for the mean (in)accuracy of the method served as a threshold value: Mean + 2*SD = 12.6%. Thus, variations within the range ± 12.6% were considered non-significant .<br>
A full mathematical explanation of the relationship between p* (the slope of the batch line) , ß (the slope of the standard line) and the highest permitted (in)accuracy value follows. Without loss of generality, only the case where ß* &gt; ß will be proved in detail (due to the existing symmetry, the extension of the proof for the case where ß* 
Xback = 10 (Y-α/ß where Y = Iog10 (IL-2 concentration). The formula for the (in)accuracy calculation was: (in) accuracy = ( (10 (Y-α/ß - Xtrue) / Xtrue] * 100%.<br>
Ylow and Yhigh were the lowest and highest log (response) values permitted by the highest allowable (in)accuracy of ± 12.6%.<br>
Thus, the region where the hypothesis of the equality of slopes was to be accepted was:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Thus, the boundaries of the equality of the slopes were<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The slope of a straight line was calculated as follows:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
Assuming for the particular case under consideration that<br>
X2/X1 = 2 (for dose levels of 5 and 10 /zg/ml) , p* was calculated<br>
as follows:<br>
ß* = ß • (1 + log(1.288)/log 2) = ß • 1.365<br>
Combining this result with the one obtained for the symmetric case where ß* 
(Equation Removed)<br>
In the given data, all slope values were within the matching critical limits, meaning that no deviation from the parallelism assumption was observed.<br>
Once a batch was accepted as statistically valid (existence of linearity and parallelism has been proved), the potency ratio of the test preparation relative to the standard was estimated. This was done in a parallel line assay by fitting straight parallel lines to the data and determining the horizontal distance between them:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where ß denoted the potency, Ys, YT, Xs, XT were the mean<br>
log (responses) and log (doses) of the standard and test preparations, respectively. B - was a common slope for the standard and test log(dose)- log(response) lines. The least-squares estimate of the common slope - B was a weighted average of the least-squares estimates of two slopes separately from the standard line and the test line. Taking the anti-logarithm of the expression above, one was able to obtain a point estimate of the "true% potency" of a test preparation relatively to its standard:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br><br>
EXAMPLE 3: VALIDATION OF THE STANDARD PROCEDURE OF EXAMPLE 1<br>
The goal of the analysis, presented below, was to establish validated release specifications for the relative potency of a GA batch. A GA batch was considered valid, if the following criteria, based on statistical inference, were fulfilled:<br>
1.   No violations of the assumptions involved in the bioassay analysis approach:<br>
(a)	Independence and normality of the log(responses);<br>
(b)	Homogeneity of the variance of the log(responses);<br>
(c)	No outliers;<br>
(d)	Parallelism (non-significance of the slope ratio test);<br>
2 .   The point estimate of the relative potency was within a pre-<br>
specified range: 80% - 125%; and<br>
3. The 95% Fiducial Limits for the "true relative potency" value were within a wider pre-defined confidence range: 70% to 143%.<br>
The model assumed that the standard and the test preparations should behave as if one were a simple dilution of the other. This means that the log (dose)-response lines for the two preparations should not deviate significantly from linearity and parallelism. Thus, an anti-logarithm of the constant horizontal displacement between these straight lines was able to serve as an estimate of the potency ratio. These two requirements, linearity and parallelism, constituted a concept of the assay validity. The check of validity was a prerequiste to the estimation of the relative potency and its fiducial limits.<br>
The estimate of random error was needed for the computation of fiducial limits for the true value of the relative potency. This measure was obtained by the implementation of the statistical technique known as "Analysis of Variance" (ANOVA). Therefore,<br>
the classical statistical assumptions of the ANOVA must have been satisfied. The requirements for the statistical analysis of a parallel-line bioassay model were as follows:<br>
1.	The responses were independently normally distributed about<br>
their expected values;<br>
2.	The variance of the response was not affected by the mean<br>
response value;<br>
3.	There were no outliers;<br>
4.	The relationship between the log(dose) and response was able<br>
to represented by a straight line over the range of doses;<br>
and<br>
5.	The straight line of the test preparation was parallel to<br>
that of the standard.<br>
The batch analysis data was obtained from different experiments performed on different days by different operators. Validation trials of the standard procedure of Example 1 were carried out by a series of experiments, each involving: 1) immunization of mice with 250 µg GA RS in CFA; 2) preparation of a primary culture from the LN cells 9-11 days following immunization; 3) incubation of the LN cells with various concentrations of GA RS and with test samples; 4) collection of the culture media and analysis of IL-2 levels by ELISA; 5)plotting a GA RS curve based on triplicate IL-2 measurements performed at 6 dose levels from 1-25 µg/ml; and 6) comparison of the T cell response to each test sample to the response to the RS batch (in triplicate) at two concentrations within the linear range (5 and 10 µg/ml) . The % CV was also calculated for each triplicate in order to detect any problems associated with variability between triplicates (normally, the % CV between triplicates should not exceed 10-15%). For the given data, no violations of the conditions were detected.<br>
The validation characteristics used to provide an overall<br>
knowledge of the capabilities of the analytical procedure were: linearity, range, accuracy, precision, specificity and robustness. The validation criteria and analyses were based on the ICH consensus guideline, "Validation of Analytical Procedures: Methodology", November 1996 (CPMP/ICH/281/95). Statistical methods recommended in "European Pharmacopoeia" guideline were adapted to the given data for analysis purposes.<br>
Experiment 3A:  Linearity and Range<br>
In each in vitro test, a dose-response curve of GA RS batch was used to calculate the relative response of the cells to the tested samples. Each calibration curve included at least five points (without zero) . Twenty-one calibration curves collected from different in vitro tests, performed during the development and the validation stages, were plotted and evaluated for each plate .<br>
Statistical analysis of the data revealed that the plots of log10 (IL-2 concentration) versus log10 (GA RS concentration) provided the best linear fit. The linear range mainly emerged by visual inspection and evaluation of accuracy and precision of the calibration points. The %RSD was calculated for each triplicate in order to detect any problems associated with variability between triplicates (normally, the %RSD between triplicates should not exceed 10-15%) . The range of GA RS curve was specified between 1-25µg/ml.<br>
Based on these analyses, the GA RS curve should be comprised of at least 6 calibration points, one with zero concentration (negative control) and at least 5 concentrations of GA RS in the range between 1 and 25 µg/ml . Linear regression of log10 (IL-2 concentration) versus log10 (GA RS concentration) should have an R2 &gt; 0.97 and a slope &gt; 0.77.<br><br>
Experiment 3B: Accuracy<br>
The accuracy of the method was established across the specified linear range of the GA RS curve. Statistical analysis of the data revealed that the mean accuracy of the method was: 8.0% ± 2.3%.<br>
Experiment 3C: Precision<br>
The basic measure of precision used was the relative standard deviation (RSD) of replicate (usually triplicate) estimate of concentration.<br>
The RSD was established across the linear range of GA RS curves. Statistical analyses of the data revealed that the mean precision of the method was 2.9% ± 1.7%. The reliability of duplicate measures was equivalent to that of triplicate. Therefore, when one of the three replicates was identified as an outlier, the outlier was omitted and the results from duplicate measures were accepted.<br>
Experiment 3D: Method repeatability<br>
The GA specific T cell response to a GA DS batch was measured repeatedly, 3 times, in the same in vitro test. Three weights of the same batch were each diluted to 5 and 10 µg/ml and incubated with the GA-specific T-cells. The levels of IL-2 in the culture media of the test samples and of the GA RS samples, were measured by ELISA in triplicate. The % potency and 95% fiducial limits of the cells to each replicate were calculated relative to the GA RS. Table 6 shows the % response calculated for each replicate.<br><br>
Table 6: Method Repeatabi1ity<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Experiment 3E: Intermediate precision<br>
The % response of a GA DS batch was tested in 3 different in vitro tests, performed in different days, by 3 different investigators from the same laboratory. Table 7 summarizes the % potency and 95% fiducial limits determined for this batch in the 3 repeated experiments.<br>
Table 7: Intermediate Precision<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br><br>
Experiment 3F: Method reproducibility<br>
The reproducibility of the method was assessed by means of inter-laboratory study. The % response GA DS batch was tested in two different experiments, performed in 2 different laboratories, using different  analysts,  equipment and reagents.  Table 8 summarizes the results from both labs.<br>
Table 8: Method Reproducibilitv<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Based on the above experiments, it can be concluded that the in vitro test is reproducible.<br>
Experiment 3G: Specificity<br>
The discrimination of the method was tested at 3 levels: 1) discrimination between samples incubated with/without GA RS (matrix effect); 2) discrimination between GA RS and other related and non-related proteins and peptides, including GA DS; and 3) discrimination between GA RS and GA related copolymers in which the peptide sequences have been deliberately modified.<br>
i) Recognition of GA RS by GA RS-specific T cells (matrix effect)<br>
GA-specific T cells were induced by immunization of female (SJL x BALB/C)F1 mice mouse with 250 g GA RS in CFA. This dose of GA is routinely used for testing the biological activity of GA batches in this mouse strain using the EAE blocking test. The control group in this experiment was injected with CFA alone. Ten days following immunization, LN cells were removed from the both groups of mice.  The cells were incubated with GA RS for 18-24 hours at 37°C in a 5% C02 humidified incubator.<br>
Subsequently, the cultures were centrifuged and the supernatants collected and assayed for interleukin-2 (IL-2, a cytokine secreted from activated T cells) by ELISA using biotinylated antibodies specific to IL-2 and strepavidin-horseradish peroxidase (HRP) conjugate for detection (Fig. 1) . Each plate run included blank control (first and second antibodies without the cytokine standard). Each plate run also included quality control (QC) samples (three concentrations of cytokine standard within the assay's linear range). Each in vitro test included a positive control (Con A, a non-specific T-cell stimulant) and a negative control (no GA or any other antigen) . Fig. 2 shows that the LN cells from mice immunized with GA RS secrete IL-2 dose dependently in response to GA RS in culture, while LN cells from the control mice do not respond to GA. RS in culture. The levels of IL-2 in the negative control samples is usually below or close to the ELISA detection limit (approximately 3 pg/ml). These IL-2 levels are always below the levels secreted by the lowest calibration point of GA RS (1 µg/ml) . These results indicate that the secretion of IL-2 by the GA specific T-cells is GA dependent.<br>
ii)Discrimination between related and non-related antigens<br>
The discrimination between related and non-related antigens (proteins and single peptides) was demonstrated by testing the response of the GA RS-specific T cells to various antigens in-vitro. A primary culture of LN cells derived from female (SJL x BALB/C) Fl mice immunized 9-11 days earlier with 250 µg GA RS in CFA. The primary culture was incubated overnight with GA RS and with various other antigens at 37°C in a 5% C02 humidified incubator. Then, the cultures were centrifuged and the supernatants collected and assayed for IL-2 by ELISA as in<br><br>
Experiment 3G(i).<br>
Table 9 shows that in this experimental system the GA-specific T cells did not respond to either human MBP (myelin basic protein), the MBP immunodominant peptide pp.87-99 (an encephalitogenic peptide) , or its analog pp. 87-99ALa96 (an EAE suppressor peptide) . Lysozyme, a non-relevant basic protein, was also not recognized by the GA-specific T cells. TV-35 and TV-109 were peptides with a molecular weight of 3757 and 11727, respectively (PCT International Publication No. WO 00/18794). These peptides had a defined sequence comprised from the same four amino acids of GA (Ala, Glu, Lys, Tyr), in the same molar ratio as in GA. The GA RS-specific LN cells did not respond to TV-35, and had a very low cross-reactivity with TV-109. These results can be explained by the observation that immunization with GA RS induced the formation of a mixture of T cells with different specificity towards the multiple T-cell epitopes present in GA. TV-35 and TV-109 may share common sequences with GA, however, and incubation of the GA-specific T cells with a single peptide probably caused only a partial stimulation of a small fraction of the GA-specific cells in culture. Thus, the overall T-cell response (secretion of IL-2) was below or close to detection limits.<br><br>
Table 9: Specificity of GA RS-specific LN cells<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
1 % Potency =IL-2 concentration in culture media of the antieen XI00 IL-2 concentration in culture media of GA RS<br>
The in vitro test was sensitive to the average molecular weight (MW) of the GA batch. Fig. 11 shows the response of the GA RS-specific cells to GA RS (MW = 7900) and to GA DS batches differing in their average MW. As can be seen, the response generally correlated with the average MW; the higher the average MW, the greater the response. However, it should be noted that the release specifications for the average MW of GA DS are between 4700-10000, and that similar levels of IL-2 were secreted in response to DS batches with average MW within specifications (Fig. 11) . These results indicate that the method was highly specific to GA and sensitive to changes in the average MW of GA.<br>
iii) Recognition of GA drug substance (DS) and Copaxone® drug product (DP) by GA RS-specific T cells<br>
Nine to eleven days following immunization of	female (SJL x<br>
BALB/C)F1 mice with 250 µg GA RS in CFA, the	LN cells were<br>
removed and cultured with various doses of GA	RS batch (the<br>
immunizing antigen) and with a DS batch.<br>
IL-2 was measured as in Experiment 3G(i).  Fig. 12A shows that<br>
the LN cells cross-reacted with both standard batches. The dose-response curves of IL-2 secretion (measured by ELISA as above) by both batches were similar, indicating that the tested batches shared similar T-cell epitopes. Comparison between GA RS and a Copaxone® batch shows that the GA RS-specific T cells also cross-reacted with the DP batch, and that mannitol, the excipient in the Copaxone® formulation, did not affect or interfere with the T-cell responses (Fig. 12B). Thus, this method provides an indication of batch-to-batch reproducibility.<br>
v)Discrimination between GA and related copolymers<br>
In Experiment 3G(ii), it was demonstrated that the in vitro test was sensitive to the average MW of GA peptides, using GA DS batches differing in their average MW. Since the experiment was based on bio-recognition of GA by GA-specific T cells, which specifically respond to linear sequences, it was expected that the method would be sensitive to variations/modifications in the sequences of GA peptides. This was demonstrated by using: 1) copolymers synthesized from only 3 out of the 4 amino acids comprising GA; 2) a GA batch (XX) resulting from deliberate modification in manufacturing conditions, i.e., addition of excess of free amino acids to GA monomers during synthesis. The average MW of this batch was high and out of specifications (MW = 11150 Da) ; and 3) degradation products of GA RS obtained by proteolysis with trypsin and chymotrypsin.<br>
Table 10 shows that the GA-specific T-cells did not respond to the 3 amino acid copolymers lacking lysine, alanine or tyrosine. In addition, the % response of the cells to the batch XX was relatively high and out of the method specifications (100 ± 30%) , indicating that the method might be sensitive to modifications in the production process. The high % response can also be explained by the sensitivity of the test to the MW of GA peptides, as<br><br>
demonstrated.<br>
Table 10: Method Specificity<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Kinetics studies of GA RS proteolysis by trypsin and chymotrypsin show that the in vitro test was sensitive to degradation of GA peptides. Figs. 13 and 15 show that the secretion of IL-2 by the cells was reduced upon proteolysis time, and the % potency of the cells to the proteolysed peptides was out of the method specifications (100 ± 30%) (Table 11). Overlay chromatograms (by "RP-HPLC) of the degraded samples (Figs. 14 and 16) demonstrated the kinetics of the proteolysis by trypsin and chymotrypsin, respectively. The cumulative results from all specificity studies revealed that the method was highly specific to GA and discriminated between GA and closely related antigens.<br><br>
Table 11: Method Specificity - Effect of Proteolysis<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Experiment 3G: Robustness<br>
i) Robustness of Acceptance Criteria<br>
The consistency and robustness of the defined acceptance criteria was examined by comparing the resulting estimates of the relative potency obtained for the repeated GA batches. The batch analysis data included a number of repeated GA batches. Two batches were measured on three different days by different operators. One batch was tested on two different days by different operators, as well.<br>
In the parallelism test for the repeated GA batches, all GA batch slopes values were within the appropriate critical limits for the parallelism slope ratio test. All GA batches satisfied the acceptance criteria for the point estimates of the relative potency values with 95% fiducial limits (the estimated %potency was within the limits of 80%-125% and the 95% fiducial limits were within the range of 70%-143%). For the analyzed data of the repeated GA batches, their validity did not depend on the day of experiment or the operator performing the test. This data supports the robustness of established specifications.<br>
ii)  Robustness of  Critical  Parameters in  the Immunization Procedure and the in vitro Reaction<br>
The robustness of critical parameters in both the immunization procedure and the in vitro reaction was evaluated. Briefly, it was shown that: 1) the immunological response of the LN cells was not affected by the immunizing dose of GA RS; 2) the immunization period was 9-11 days; 3) the response of the LN cells to GA RS was higher compared to the spleen cells response; 4) immunization with GA RS + CFA resulted in the LN cells having a stronger response compared to immunization with ICFA; 5) the presence of serum in culture media strongly affected the GA-specific T cell response, thus the in vitro reaction was performed in a serum-free media; 6) the optimal time frame for collecting the culture media was 18-21 hours following incubation with GA RS and test samples; and 7) the culture media can be kept at -20°C for up to one week before tested in ELISA. Thus, it was shown that the method was robust.<br>
Summary Statistics for the Point Estimate and 95% Fiducial Limits of Relative Potency<br>
95% Tolerance Limits for the Mean Relative Potency<br>
To assess. the acceptance limits for the estimated relative potency of a new batch, the mean and the standard deviation of the individual log(potency) estimates were calculated:<br>
Mean(Mi)  =    0.0074; SD(Mi)    =    0.0402.<br>
An approximated 95% tolerance range for the mean relative potency value, based on the analyzed data, was:<br><br>
 [10Mean(Mi ± 2 * SD(Mi)] * 100% = [84%, 122%].<br>
 Range of the 95% Fiducial Limits of Relative Potency<br>
The minimum and maximum values of the 95% Fiducial Limits for the individual relative potency estimates were:<br>
Minimum(Low Limit)  =   79.3% Maximum(High Limit) =    147.3%<br>
Satisfaction of the Acceptance Criteria<br>
Based on the analysis, the acceptance criteria were determined to be:<br>
1.	The assumptions involved in bioassay analysis approach were<br>
fulfilled, namely:<br>
a.	Independence and normality of the log(responses);<br>
b.	Homogeneity of the variance of the log(responses);<br>
c.	No outliers; and<br>
d.	Parallelism (non-significance of the slope ratio<br>
test) .<br>
2.	The estimated relative potency was not less than 80% and not<br>
more than 125% of the standard potency; and<br>
3.	The 95% Fiducial Limits of error of the estimated relative<br>
potency were not less than 70% and not more than 143% of the<br>
standard potency.<br>
Discussion of Example 3<br>
Validation of the in vitro test revealed that the method was reproducible and the mean accuracy and precision were in an acceptable range. The method was highly specific to GA peptides and sensitive to the quality of the active substance.<br>
SUMMARY AND DISCUSSION<br>
An in vitro method was developed for GA DS and Copaxone® batches. This method was based on bio-recognition of T-cell epitopes (linear sequences) by GA RS-specific T cells. The GA RS-specific T cells secrete Th0 cytokines in response to GA in culture. In this method, the recognition of GA batches by T cells is monitored by measuring the levels of IL-2 in the culture media by ELISA. It was shown that the GA RS-specific T cells are cross-reactive with both DS and DP batches, indicating that these batches share similar sequences with the RS batch, and that mannitol, the excipient in the DP formulation, does not interfere with the reaction.<br>
The method was very specific to GA peptides and is sensitive to the average MW of the peptide mixture. MBP was not recognized by the GA-specific T cells. MBP immunodominant peptides (both encephalitogenic and suppressive peptides), as well as single peptides with amino-acid composition similar to that of GA, did not stimulate the T cells. Critical parameters in the immunization procedure, as well as in the in-vitro reaction, were optimized during this experiment. This experiment showed that the method was very reproducible and robust.<br>
The method can be adapted to standardize other T cell antigens for use in pharmaceutical compositions. A primary culture of T cells specific to an antigen RS, instead of GA RS, can be made from animals immunized against the antigen RS. The cytokine production of this culture in response to antigen RS and in response to the sample antigen can be measured. The cytokine production in response to antigen RS can be plotted against the concentration of antigen RS to create a standard curve. The cytokine production in response to the sample antigen can be compared to the standard curve to determine whether the antigen is within the acceptable range of potency.<br>
The optimum cytokine to monitor can be determined as in Experiment 2A. Conditions for immunization and the in vitro test may be optimized as in Experiments 2B and C.<br><br>
