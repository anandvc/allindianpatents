				<td>The present invention relates to a textile machine, in particular a drawing frame with a can-traversing device.<br>
In the case of drawing frames for filling flat-top cans it is known to traverse the flat-top can to be filled inside a chamber which is connected on a narrow side to the space surrounding the drawing frame (DE 40 15938 Al, Fig. 24). Constituents of fly, which become detached from the sliver supplied to a can as the can is being filled, thus remain in this chamber. For traversing the can a drive is required which likewise becomes contaminated with fly over time and thus results in breakdowns.<br>
The object of the present invention is therefore to further develop the textile machine in such a way as to avoid the drawbacks outlined above and in particular to prevent the traversing drive and possibly further drives connected to the chamber from being contaminated with fly.<br>
This object is attained according to the present invention as described below. By arranging the can-traversing device in a first chamber and by arranging the drive thereof in a second chamber, which are separated from each other aerodynamicaliy by means of a fluidic separating member, fly is prevented from penetrating into the chamber which receives the drive, as a result of which breakdowns resulting from fly are avoided.<br>
If the can-changing device is arranged inside the textile machine and not on a can-conveying carriage for supplying and removing cans, it is possible to counteract contamination by fly of the drive of the can-changing device in a similar manner. Depending upon the design of the can-traversing device, the solution according to the invention can be used independently of a design of the subject of the invention or even in combination therewith.<br><br>
It has been found that in order to avoid contamination of a drive by fly it is advantageous if the drives are arranged spatially separate from each other in separate chambers. Since the drives of the can-traversing device and the can-changing device are independent of each other, in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the subject of the invention the two chambers for the can-traversing device and for the can-changing device are hermetically sealed off from each other.<br>
In order to permit, on the one hand, servicing of the drive arranged in the third chamber and, at the same time, secure sealing in a simple manner, it is advantageous if the device according to the invention is further developed. Since both the drive arranged in the second chamber and the drive arranged in the third chamber are intended to produce movement along the first chamber, it is advantageous to arrange and to seal off the said two drives in chambers arranged one above the other.<br>
Designing the fluidic separating member has been found to be particularly advantageous, but a different design, for example by means of an air flow is also perfectly possible and convenient, in which case the said air flow can also optionally be provided in addition to a different type of fluidic separation. An additional air flow of this type, which keeps a drive free from contamination by fly, can be produced in that a defined air flow is produced inside the second chamber as a result of the interplay of the design of the second chamber and as a result of the provision of a fan.<br>
In order that the connecting member extending from the first chamber to the second or third chamber respectively can be made with dimensions as small as possible, so that the area to be sealed off is as small as possible, the provision is made that the driven device runs easily.<br><br>
It is also possible to counteract contamination of the drive or drives by fly in that, optionally as an additional step, fly and other dirt and fibre constituents are prevented from being able to settle in the first chamber for a long time or for a prolonged period. Independently of a design of the textile machine in accordance with one of the preceding claims, a step of this type is also advantageous since this feature is also independently important. In this case a design according to the invention of a cleaning device has been found to be particularly advantageous.<br>
In the sense of the present invention the term "can-traversing device" should not be understood as being restricted to a device of this type which imparts a linear movement to the can to be filled. This term should rather also embrace such a device which during the filling imparts a different type of movement necessary therefor to the can, for example a movement made up of different movements or, in the case of round cans, a rotational movement.<br>
The term "can" is not restricted to a special shape of can, for example a flat-top can, but is also intended to include a can with a differing shape, for example a round can.<br>
The device according to the invention is simple in design and effective in its operation. In this case it can be adapted in a simple manner by an appropriate choice of a suitable fluidic or aerodynamic separation to the drives and the connecting members thereof used in each case for the driven can-traversing device or the can-changing device respectively.<br><br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a textile machine, in particular a drawing frame, with a can-traversing device which is driven with the aid of a driving device and which is arranged in a first chamber connected to the space surrounding the textile machine, wherein the driving device of the can-traversing device is situated in a second chamber which is separated with the aid of a fluidic separating member from the first chamber receiving the can-traversing device, a connecting member extending through the said separating member from the driving device to the can-traversing device.<br><br>
Embodiments of the device according to the invention are explained in greater detail below with the aid of drawings with reference to a drawing frame. In the drawing<br>
Fig. 1    is a front view in partial section of a drawing frame designed according to the invention;<br>
Fig. 2    is a side view of a drawing frame according to the invention with drives indi¬cated with broken lines;<br>
Fig. 3    is a plan view, in section, of part of the drive of the drawing frame;<br>
Fig. 4    is a diagrammatic side view of part of the drive of the drawing frame, and<br>
Fig. 5    is a diagrammatic plan view of the drawing frame with a cleaning device accor¬ding to the invention.<br>
Fig. 1 shows the drawing frame (y designed according to the invention in a front view from that side on which cans{20)to be filled are conveyed thereto by means of a can carriage(2)(Fig. 5) and from which the cans (20) are subsequently removed again after the filling. The can carriage(2)receives a plurality of cans(20)in a conventional manner, eight cans(2(Jin the embodiment shown, and is movable transversely to a (first) chamber(3)of the drawing frame(l) For this purpose, the drawing frame(l)engages with a mating wheel (not shown) or the like of the can carriage(2jby means of a drive wheel (lO)in order to move the can carriage (2;into the desired position in front of the drawing framevjjin which one of the eight cans(20)can be supplied to a chamber(3)of the draw¬ing frame(l)and can be removed from the chamber 0)again and deposited on the can carriage (2J In order that this exchange of cans (removing a filled can (20) from the chamber(3)and depositing it on the can carriageujand supplying an empty can(20)to the chamber(3)for filling) can be carried out, the chamberfc)is open on its side facing the can carriageC)so that it is connected to the space surrounding the drawing frame(l.)<br>
The chamber(3)has a roller conveyor which comprises a plurality of rollers (3Q) and on which the can(20)can be traversed in the longitudinal direction of the chamber (3)<br><br>
(traversing path: vide double arrow fx in Fig. 5). In order to traverse the canfcOja can-traversing device(7jis provided in the chamber^) the can-traversing device(7jmoving the can(20jto be filled backwards and forwards below a filling head (not shown) during the filling procedure, so that a sliver drawn and evened-out in a manner which is known and therefore not shown is distributed uniformly in the interior of the can. In addition, to this end, the moving (=traversing) path (double arrow f, in Fig. 5) is provided on both sides with rollers (12) which are each arranged in pairs (not shown) and are displaceable transversely to the traversing path of the can (2Q) by a pendulum device and between which the upper end of the can(203is guided and which tilt the can^OJfrom one side to another during the traversing. Since the filling of the can @0)is known per se and is not therefore a subject of the present invention, it is unnecessary to provide a more detailed description of the supplying and drawing of the slivers supplied in a con¬ventional manner or of the filling procedure of the can(20'The can-traversing device (j) has an entrainment means (70,) of which the end (700) remote from the can carriageO)(v/^e also Figs. 2 and 5) engages behind the canpOjto be filled. At its end facing the can carriagefc^the entrainment means(70jhas a controllable pivot arm $01)which is pivotable from a rest position, in which it extends parallel to the traversing path {vide double arrow fj in Fig. 5), into an operating position, in which the said pivot arm (70 f) extends parallel to the end (70Q) of the entrainment means (70jand together therewith encloses the can^O^<br>
The entrainment means (70) is guided with the aid of guide members (not shown), which extend parallel to the traversing path (double arrow fx in Fig. 5), and is connected to a driving device(72)by means of a driving belt 71 which forms a connecting member<br>
r<br>
and which passes around two reversing rollers 710 and 711 (Fig. 2). The said driving device (72)comprises a driving roller(720,)around which the driving belt(71)passes and which is mounted on a shaft(72lJof a controllable gearing(722^vhich causes the move¬ment of the entrainment means(70)to be reversed in accordance with the setting of the said entrainment means(70) Since gearings(722)of this type, as well as their control devices, are known per se, an illustration in detail is unnecessary.  The gearing(722^is<br><br>
connected by way of one or more further belts(723^24)and corresponding belt pulleys 725, 726 and(727j (vztfe Fig. 2) to the drive shaft (728) of a drive motor $29) which is designed for example as the main motor of the drawing frame 1 and which also drives the drawing unit (not shown) of the drawing frame (l)(vide driving wheel (73) and belt 730 in Fig. 1).<br>
The driving device(72)is arranged in a second chamber $) which is separated from the first chamber(3) by a fluidic separating member(6) In accordance with the embodi¬ment illustrated, the said fluidic separating member (6Jis constructed in the form of a wall(61) which is provided only in the region of the reversing rollers(710)and(^ll)with one respective small opening (610) (vide Fig. 4) in each case for the passage of the driving belt (71} Since the entrainment means ^0)has to patrol over a relatively large area, i.e. over practically the entire length, of the chamber(3,)the driving belt ^l) also has to extend over this area of the chamber(3.) In order to be able to arrange the bearings (712)of the reversing rollers(710)and(711)outside the chamberG,) i.e. inside the chamber (8,)the said reversing rollers(71Qand(7l 1)project only in part - through the two openings (610)- into the chamber(3 J) In this case the said two openings (610)are made so narrow (for example with a clearance in the order of magnitude of less than half a millimetre) that they practically form a seal. In order to increase the sealing effect, it is provided in accordance with Fig. 4 that the wall 61 carries one respective wiping brush(61 l)and(^12) on both sides of the reversing roller(710)and(711) respectively. In the embodiment illus¬trated, the said wiping brush(61 l)and^512)respectively is orientated radially with respect to the reversing roller (710)and^l Irrespectively, so that the bristles thereof can always yield in order to reverse the driving direction of the can-traversing device(7jwhen the driving direction of the driving belt(7l)is reversed, without their sealing action being adversely affected.<br>
As the design of the device has been described in principle, the mode of operation thereof will now be explained:<br>
During the filling of the can(20) individual fibres, fibre scraps and the like, together with the sliver (not shown), drawn and evened-out and deposited in the can(20^arrive in<br><br>
the chamber 3, the said individual fibres, fibre scraps and the like either not being con¬nected at all to the sliver or being so poorly tied therein that they are now released therefrom. The said fibres, fibre scraps and other constituents now move at random through the chamber (3J and are also in part prevented by the can^O)- which moves backwards and forwards during the traversing - from being deposited in the chamber(3j) but rather they fly about in an uncontrolled manner as so-called fly in the chamber^ This fly cannot cause any damage in the chamber 3 itself, since the moved parts present therein are merely driven passively and are not part of a driving device.<br>
The fly does represent a risk to the driving deviceC^however, since, as a result of jamming, constituents of fly can lead to hot running and seizure of the rapidly rotating parts of the driving device and even to burning. The fluidic separating member(6jhas the intended result, therefore, that fly of this type cannot penetrate into the said second chamber (8) which receives the driving device (72^ In this way, the driving device (72j operates without disturbance or risk even over a prolonged period.<br>
It is to be understood that the subject of the invention is not exclusively restricted to the embodiment of a drawing frame(l)as described above, but within the scope of the present invention it can be varied in numerous ways, for example by replacing indivi¬dual members by equivalents or by other combinations thereof. In this way, it is advan¬tageous if the replacement or exchange of the cans (removal of a filled can(20)from the chamber f3J for deposition on the can carriage t2)and supplying an empty can(20) to the chamber(3)for filling) is carried out with the aid of a can-changing device(4)arranged in the drawing frame Q) A can-changing device(4)of this type is shown merely diagram-matically in Figs. 1, 2 and 5. In the embodiment shown it is provided with a slide^Oj The said slide 40 has a controllable coupling device (not shown), by means of which a can 20 present on the can carriage(2)can be connected to the slide^OJin a kinematically fixed manner and can be pulled down from the can carriage(2)and into the chamberQ)of the drawing frame 1.<br>
If a can(20)is to be filled, the can carriage{2)is moved by a suitable drive by means of the driving wheel(lQj- the drive of which is not shown in the Figures since it is con-<br><br>
structed in a conventional manner - in a known manner into such a position in front of the chamberOJ of the drawing frame (ljthat an empty can 20 is present in front of the open narrow side of the chamberO) With the aid of a driving device $3)which will be described below, the slide &amp;0)is moved into a position such that it can be connected with the aid of the above-mentioned coupling device to the can&amp;Ojto be filled. The slide&amp;O) then pulls the canOQjinto a position in which it can be taken up by the can-traversing deviceC7Jfor traversing during the filling procedure. The coupling device is actuated in this position in order to release the can 20 to be filled. The slide(40)of the can-changing device 4 then moves into a rest position at the other end of the chamber(3)(v/de Fig. 5).<br>
The slide&amp;OJis supported by a longitudinal side with the aid of two rollers^H)on a rail 01) which extends parallel to the longitudinal direction of the chamber(3Jand thus to the traversing path (vide double arrow fx in Fig. 5). The slide$0)is connected on the other longitudinal side thereof to a connecting member(42jwhich is supported by means of a sliding guide(420Jto a sliding railO 10)which extends parallel to the railQ IV In addi¬tion, the connecting member (42} is connected to the driving device (43) already men¬tioned. The said driving device(43)has an entrainment member ^30Jwhich in turn is connected to a driving belt(431) The driving belt 431 is driven by a driving wheel 
The sliding rail(110\and the driving device(43)are not arranged in the chamber^) with the can-changing device 4, but in a separate chamber(5)which is separated from the chamber(3Jby a fluidic separating member(60.) In the embodiment illustrated, the said fluidic separating member (60) is in turn constructed in the form of a wall (62) which separates the two chambers(3)and (5 Ifrom each other and which has only a small con¬necting opening(£20)through which the connecting member ^2) extends from the can-changing device ^)to the driving device 43 thereof. In the embodiment illustrated, the connecting opening(620jis constructed in the form of a narrow slot, so that the passage of fly constituents such as fine fibre constituents and the like is effectively prevented and the driving device(43\is protected from contamination by fly. In this way, the risk of damage to the driving device^O} as already described in conjunction with the driving<br><br>
device 72 of the can-traversing device (7) is eliminated in this case too.<br>
In the two embodiments described, the fluidic separating member 6 or 60 respec¬tively is constructed in a mechanical manner, namely in the form of a wall <j5l or respectively. although this is not a pre-condition it allows fluidic separating member type to be produced in simple manner. the embodiments described seal which constructed either mechanical manner example form of wiping brushes and pneumatic laby provided each case at point can-traversing device arranged chamber connected its driving another namely can-changing same way likewise chamber6 widely different designs are possible. for slot-shaped connecting opening with lip-like brush-like sealing members shown opened briefly only passage con said along order closed again after passing alternatively however floating on guided guide extending closes entire length thereof.></j5l>
There are various steps which contribute to an effective seal being produced in a particularly simple manner between the chamber(3)and the chambers(5)and(8jreceiving the driving device @3)and $2)respectively. In addition, an easy-running guide of the can-traversing device(7)and the can-changing device/4jrespectively contributes not least in this respect. In this way for example, as shown in Figs. 1 and 5, the slide
 <br>
changing device likewise has to transmit a lower force and can therefore be made with smaller dimensions than in the case of sliding friction. In this way, the connecting opening(620)can also be kept very small, and this simplifies the sealing between the chambers(3)and(5Jto a significant extent.<br>
In principle, the two driving devices (43) and ^2) can be housed in a common chamber (not shown). In this case there is the risk, however, that fibre constituents and other fly constituents - which could be brought through a servicing door (13) or (14) respectively (vide Fig. 2) into the said chamber during a servicing operation - could always pass through the more rapidly rotating driving members of the driving device f 2) to reach the driving members of the driving device^3,*) which rotate more slowly and are even at a standstill throughout the filling of the can (20,)i.e. for prolonged periods, and could settle there and result in damage.<br>
In order to avoid this risk, as shown in Fig. 1, the driving devices(43/ and^^are arranged in separate chambers(5)and(8j which are separated from each other by a further fluidic separating member 0500.) In this case too, for the sake of simplicity the said fluidic separating member <f>00)is constructed in a mechanical manner in the form of a wallC63) The arrangement of the two driving devices (43) and Q72)in second and third separate chambers 5 and 8 has the advantage that the restriction of a chamber (5) or (8) respectively to one of the two driving devices $3) and (72)in each case can result in a further increase in the operational reliability, since a reduction in non-controllable flows in the chambers(5)and(8)can also be achieved by a reduction in the size of the chambers (5) and (8} This eliminates the risk for example that fly constituents, which have still reached the chamber(5,)or (S)through the servicing door03)or(l4)for example, can be spread further from this point and can penetrate into the other chamber(8) or (^respec¬tively.<br>
Since both the can-traversing device (7jand the can-changing device(4.Jhave to be moved over the same longitudinal area of the drawing frame 1, it is advisable to arrange the two chambers(5)and(8)one above the other, even if an arrangement one behind the<br><br>
other or on different longitudinal sides of the chamber 3 is quite possible.<br>
Since the driving device (43J is at greater risk than the driving device (72) as a result of its lower running speed and longer stoppage periods, the chamber(5)is separated her¬metically from the chamber(8,) and this is achieved by the above-mentioned wall (63) In order to ensure a secure sealing even in the region of the servicing door(l3j)the chamber (3)is sealed off from the servicing doorQ3)by a resilient seal(l30)resting against the servicing door (13^ and, if the servicing door 04) also extends over the region of the chamber@,)it is additionally sealed off from the servicing doorQ4)by a resilient seal(l40) resting against the servicing door(14) The said resilient sealQ30)and possibly(l40jis situated in each case in the boundary walls of the chamber(5,)which extend from the servicing doortp^and possibly(l4)(vz'<ie for example the wall in figs. and></ie>
If a mechanical seal is not provided as the fluidic separating member(6J^0Jor ^00) respectively, the required sealing effect can be achieved by a suitable design of the con¬necting opening(620jin the form of a labyrinth seal of greater or lesser complexity.<br>
A further possibility is to provide the fluidic separating member %6,)fcty or (^00) respectively in the form of a suitable air flow which prevents fly constituents from reaching the driving device^3)and/or(72.) In this way, a curtain of air can be formed for example between the chamber(3jand the chamber (5) and/or (8,} in that for example a transverse flow (not shown) is produced which picks up the constituents floating in the air and conveys them to a collecting container which the air leaves through a filter (not shown).<br>
A further possibility of a pneumatic fluidic separating member, which can be pro¬vided in addition to one of the designs described, is shown in Fig. 3, in which the cham¬ber 8 with the driving device(72)is illustrated in a diagrammatic manner. In this case the two servicing doors (13)and(l4jare also clearly visible, which are intended to allow access to the driving device &amp;3) and(72)and which therefore (vide Figs. 1 and 2) extend over the essential vertical area of the two chambers (5jand(8Jarranged one above the<br><br>
other. Each servicing door carries a filter(131) and 041) respectively, in order to permit the passage of air, without fly being able to penetrate into the chamber(5)or(8)at the same time.<br>
In accordance with the embodiment described above, the driving device (7,2)has the above-mentioned gearing (722) and the driving roller (720)as the first main group A and the above-mentioned drive motor 729, the belt roller(727Jand the driving wheel(73) for the belt(73Q)- the illustration of which has been omitted in Fig. 2 for the sake of simpli¬city - as the second main group B. In addition, a fan(64)is mounted on the drive shaft (728) of the drive motor(729)(v/cfe Figs. 1 and 3), in order to produce in the chamber 8 an air flow which passes through the filter (131) of the servicing doorQ3jto arrive in the chamber(8)and leaves the said chamberf8Wain through the filter 041) of the servicing door(14^ In this case, the chamber(8)is divided into two interconnected partial chambers - namely a suction spacev81)and a discharge space(82J- by a wall(80)which extends as far as the lateral wall(15)of the drawing frame 1 provided with the servicing doors (13J and(14A In this way the wall$0)does not pass through the entire chamber^but leaves sufficient space for a satisfactory drive connexion to be possible between the two main groups A and B (by means of the belt(724)- vide Fig. 2), so that the suction space(81) and the discharge space 82 are connected to each other at their ends remote from the filters \\ 31) and (141) In this case, the arrangement of the filters (l 31) and (l41} in the servicing doors(l3)and(l4)one (servicing door 13) of which is associated with the suc¬tion space 81 and the other (servicing door 14) of which is associated with the discharge space 82 in each case, is made in such a way that the air flow (vide arrow f2) produced by the fan 64 passes the most important members of the two main groups A and B and seizes and entrains the fly constituents present there. For this reason, as shown in Fig. 2, the filters(131)and([41)are arranged at different levels in order to deflect the air flow (arrow f2) in an optimum manner. The same object can also be achieved by suitable baffles (air-guiding plates or the like) inside the chamber 8. When the air flow (vide arrow f2) leaves the discharge space($2,)the fly constituents entrained by the air flow (arrow f2) are deposited on the filter( 141) which is cleaned in a conventional manner at an appropriate time.<br><br>
The drawing frame 1 described above is one which receives both the can-traversing device^Jand the can-changing device &amp;) It is also possible, however, deviating from the drawing frame (l) illustrated and described, for the can-traversing device f7jalone to be arranged inside the drawing frame 1, whilst the cans are changed with the aid of a can-changing device (not shown) provided on the can carriage 2.<br>
It has been implicitly assumed above that it is non-round (flat-top) cans(20)which are being filled, but it is obvious that with a suitable adaptation of the movement patterns the invention can also be used in conjunction with round cans(20.J<br>
As already mentioned, as well as the sliver to be deposited in the can £0,) loose fibres not tied in the sliver and fibre scraps etc. also arrive in the chamberGWhere they can be periodically swirled. Since the risk of such fly arriving in one of the chambers(5) and (^arises only when constituents of this type are'present in the chamber 0,) in a further development of the device described it is provided that the chamber(3)is cleaned at regular or irregular intervals. This can be carried out in various ways, for example with the aid of a brush-like cleaning device(9)(not shown)- which operates purely mechanically and which is used for specified periods.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a cleaning device 9 which operates on a purely pneumatic basis and in which the slide (40)has a suction funnel (90) which is connected to an underpressure source (not shown) by way of a tubeOlJ The underpressure in the suction funnel (90) can be controlled in a desired manner, for example independently of the position of the slide (4Q) at pre-determined time intervals or even as a function of the position of the slide ^0.) For this purpose, in accordance with the embodiment shown in Fig. 5, sensors (92Q)andf92l) which are connected to a control device(92) with the aid of lines(930)and (931,\are provided in each case in the end region of the traversing path (vide double arrow ft). The sensors(920)and
 <br>
sensorsG?20)and(921)is passed, a switching pulse is delivered to the control device (92) which as a function thereof releases the underpressure in the suction funnel(90)or inter¬rupts it again, so that the cleaning action is released only during the movement of the slide(40) If it is desired, the sensors (920jand $21) can also be dispensed with, in which case the underpressure can then be controlled by that control device (not shown) which sets the slide
If the chamber 0) is to be additionally cleaned, the underpressure in the suction funnel(90)can also be released for a short time between two can-changing cycles. In addition, if desired, a blasting device, which contributes to the intensification of the air flow supplied to the suction funnel (90^ can also be provided at the end of the chamber^) facing the can carriageO) This compressed-air flow can also optionally be permanently effective if the underpressure effect in the suction funnel is also continuously main¬tained.<br>
It is also possible to provide a stationary suction funnel (not shown) at the end of the chamberC3)facing the can carriageC2jand to provide the slide(40)with a brush, scraper or the like which conveys fly and dirt constituents - which would have settled on the base of the chamber(3)- to the said stationary suction funnel during a movement of the slide(4Cjfor ejecting a full can (20.)<br><br>
In accordance with a further modification (not shown) of a cleaning device(9)for the chamberO^a blasting nozzle is provided in the region of the open narrow side of the chamberO,)the said blasting nozzle blowing the fly into a collecting container which is arranged in a rear region of the chamberQjand which is emptied periodically (manually or automatically, for example pneumatically). Other arrangements are likewise pos¬sible, for example an arrangement of the blasting nozzle (or a different type of cleaning member of the cleaning device 9) on the slide 40 or, if the drawing frameCl^as no can-changing device(4,)on another member which can patrol along the chamber (3^option¬ally independently of the can-traversing deviceC^or, on the other hand, together there¬with and can thus be connected to the said can-traversing device (l)or to the driving belt<br>
C71;<br>
A cleaning device(9)for the chamber(3jis also advantageous if the can(2Qjis made round and is thus not given a traversing movement but only a rotational movement. As has likewise already been mentioned above, in this case too the driving device required for this to achieve the filling movement of the can (20) is arranged in a chamber (not shown) separated aerodynamically from the chamber^ A<br>
The invention is not restricted to the embodiments illustrated. It can also be applied in principle to textile machines other than drawing frames in which cans are filled with sliver or in which cans are displaced, such as for example in the case of carding machines.<br><br><br>
