				<td>GSK-3 INHIBITORS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to enzyme inhibitors, and more particularly to heterocyclic inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3P, GSK-3, to processes of preparation of such compounds, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising them, and to their use for the treatment and or prophylaxis of a disease in which GSK-3 is involved, such as Alzheimer's disease or non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The search for new therapeutic agents has been greatly aided in recent years by better understanding of the structure of enzymes and other biomolecules associated with target diseases. One important class of enzymes that has been the subject of extensive study is the protein kinases. Many diseases are associated with abnormal cellular responses triggered by protein kinase-mediated events. These diseases include autoimmune diseases, inflammatory diseases, neurological and neurodegenerative diseases, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, allergies and asthma, Alzheimer's disease or hormone-related diseases. Accordingly, there has been a substantial effort in medicinal chemistry to find protein kinase inhibitors that are effective as therapeutic agents.<br>
Glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) is a serine/threonine protein kinase comprised of a and (3 isoforms that are each encoded by distinct genes (Coghlan et al., Chemistiy &amp; Biology?, 7. 793-803 (2000); Kim and Kimmel, Curr. Opinion Genetics Dev., 10, 508-514 (2000)). The threonine/serine kinase glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3) fulfills a pivotal role in various receptor-linked signalling pathways (Doble, BW, Woodgett, JR J.Cell Sci. 2003, 116:1175-1186). Dysregulation within these pathways is considered a crucial event in the development of several prevalent human disorders, such as type II diabetes (Kaidanovich O, Eldar-Finkelman H. Expert Opm. Ther. Targets, 2002. 6:555-561), Alzheimer's disease (Grimes CA, Jope RS. Prog.Newobioi 2001, 65:391-426) , CNS disorders such as manic depressive disorder and neurodegenerative diseases, and chronic inflammatory disorders (Hoeflich KP. Luo<br><br>
J, Rubie EA, Tsao MS, Jin O, Woodgett J, Nature 2000, 406:86-90). These diseases may be caused by, or result in, the abnormal operation of certain cell signalling pathways in which GSK-3 plays a role.<br>
GSK-3 has been found to phosphorylate and modulate the activity of a number of regulatory proteins. These proteins include glycogen synthase which is the rate limiting enzyme necessary for glycogen synthesis, the microtubule associated protein Tau, the gene transcription factor P-catenin, the translation initiation factor elF2B, as well as ATP citrate lyase, axin, heat shock factor-1, c-Jun, c-Myc, c-Myb, CREB, and CEPBa. These diverse protein targets implicate GSK-3 in many aspects of cellular metabolism, proliferation, differentiation and development.<br>
Currently, inhibition of GSK-3 may represent a viable strategy to develop novel medicinal entities for the treatment of such unmet diseases (Martinez A, Castro A, Dorronsoro 1, Alonso M, Med. Res. Rev., 2002, 22:373-384) through insulin mimicry, tau dephosphorylation and amyloid processing, or transcriptional modulation respectively.<br>
Among the great diversity of chemical structures with GSK-3 inhibition already found (Dorronsoro, I; Castro, A; Martinez, A Exp Opin Titer Patents 2002, 12:1527-1536; Alonso,M. and Martinez, A. Currrent Medicinal Chemistry 2004, 11, 753-761), the 2,4-disubstituted thiadiazolidinone (TDZD) are presented as the first ATP-non competitive GSK-3 inhibitors (Martinez A, Alonso M, Castro A, Perez C, Moreno F, J Med Chem, 2002, 45:1292-1299; WO 01 85685 and US 2003/0195238). These compounds have great interest since they are selective and do not show inhibition on other several kinases such as PKA, PKC, CK-2 and CDKl/cyclin B. However, thiadiazolidinones have the tendency to react with nucleophiles and this property may jeopardize their drug potential.<br>
There is still a need to find good GSK-3 inhibitors, being both effective and selective, and having good "drugability" properties, i.e. good pharmaceutical properties related to administration, distribution, metabolism and excretion.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Taking advantage of some of our molecular modelling results and theories, we have designed and synthesized a second generation of 2,4-disubstituted thiadiazolidinones (TDZD) which are very stable against thiol-containing biological molecules such as glutathion and BSA (bovine serum albumina). Surprisingly, these compounds have also a very favourable drugable profile, in particular oral bioavailability and blood brain barrier penetration.<br>
In one aspect the invention is directed to compounds of general formula 1:<br><br>
i<br>
wherein:<br>
Ri is an organic group having at least 8 atoms selected from C or O, which is not linked directly to the N through a -C(O)- and comprising at least an aromatic ring; R:1 , Rh, R2, R.4 R4, R5.

We have found that compounds with a benzyl like structure at position 4 and a bulky group comprising an aromatic ring or rings at position 2 of the thiadiazolidinones interact optimally with the GSK-3 enzyme while at the same time presenting good drugability properties.<br>
Preferred compounds are those in which Ri has an aromatic group having at least 10 aromatic carbons. These compounds show good activity, stability and reduced binding to plasma proteins like glutatione and albumin.<br>
Also preferred are compounds in which R| has an aromatic group directly linked to the N of the thiadiazolidine.<br>
In a particular embodiment compounds in which Rj is a naphthyl group are preferred, most preferably if Ri is a a-naphthyl group.<br>
Another preferred class of compounds are those in which the substituent at position 4 of the TDZD is an unsubstituted benzyl group.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The typical compounds of this invention selectively inhibit GSK-3(3 without inhibition of other protein kinases such as PKA, PKC, CK-2 and CdK2, which could eliminate the effects. Additionally they do not bind significantly to model proteins such as Glutathione and Bovine Serum Albumin which is a good indication of their stability in plasma. They also show good absorption and blood brain banner permeability as demonstrated by the examples.<br>

The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts, derivatives, solvates , prodrugs" refers to any pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester, solvate, or any other compound which, upon administration to the recipient is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a compound as described herein. However, it will be appreciated that non-pharmaceutically acceptable salts also fall within the scope of the invention since those may be useful in the preparation of pharmaceutically acceptable salts. The preparation of salts, prodrugs and derivatives can be carried out by methods known in the art.<br>
For instance, pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds provided herein are synthesized from the parent compound which contains a basic or acidic moiety by<br><br>
conventional chemical methods. Generally, such salts are, for example, prepared by reacting the free acid or base forms of these compounds with a stoichiometric amount of the appropriate base or acid in water or in an organic solvent or in a mixture of the two. Generally, nonaqueous media like ether, ethyl acetate, ethanol, isopropanol or acetonitrile are preferred. Examples of the acid addition salts include mineral acid addition salts such as, for example, hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, nitrate, phosphate, and organic acid addition salts such as, for example, acetate, maleate, fumarate, citrate, oxalate, succinate, tartrate, malate, mandelate, methanesulphonate and p-toluenesulphonate. Examples of the alkali addition salts include inorganic salts such as, for example, sodium, potassium, calcium, ammonium, magnesium, aluminium and lithium salts, and organic alkali salts such as, for example, ethylenediamine, ethanolamine, N,N-dialkylenethanolamine, triethanolamine, glucamine and basic aminoacids salts.<br>
Particularly favoured derivatives or prodrugs are those that increase the bioavailability of the compounds of this invention when such compounds are administered to a patient (e.g., by allowing an orally administered compound to be more readily absorbed into the blood) or which enhance delivery of the parent compound to a biological compartment (e.g., the brain or lymphatic system) relative to the parent species.<br>
Any compound that is a prodrug of a compound of formula (I) is within the scope of the invention. The term "prodrug" is used in its broadest sense and encompasses those derivatives that are converted in vivo to the compounds of the invention. Such derivatives would readily occur to those skilled in the art, and include, depending on the functional groups present in the molecule and without limitation, the following derivatives of the present compounds: esters, amino acid esters, phosphate esters, metal salts sulfonate esters, carbamates, and amides. Examples of well known methods of producing a prodrug of a given acting compound are known to those skilled in the art and can be found e.g. in Krogsgaard-Larsen et al. "Textbook of Drugdesign and Discovery" Taylor &amp; Francis (april 2002).<br><br>
The compounds of the invention may be in crystalline form either as free compounds or as solvates (e.g. hydrates) and it is intended that both forms are within the scope of the present invention. Methods of solvation are generally known within the art. Suitable solvates are phannaceutically acceptable solvates. In a particular embodiment the solvate is a hydrate.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) or their salts or solvates are preferably in phannaceutically acceptable or substantially pure form. By phannaceutically acceptable form is meant, inter alia, having a phannaceutically acceptable level of purity excluding nonnal pharmaceutical additives such as diluents and carriers, and including no material considered toxic at normal dosage levels. Purity levels for the drug substance are preferably above 50%, more preferably above 70%o, most preferably above 90%. In a prefen-ed embodiment it is above 95% of the compound of fonnula (I), or of its salts, solvates or prodrugs.<br>
The compounds of the present invention represented by the above described fonnula (I) may include enantiomers depending on the presence of chiral centres or isomers depending on the presence of multiple bonds (e.g. Z, E). The single isomers, enantiomers or diastereoisomers and mixtures thereof fall within the scope of the present invention.<br>
We have found that the compounds of fonnula I above are selective GSK-3 inhibitors (they do not show inhibition on other kinases) and additionally they present good phannacological properties which makes them suitable for drug development. Indeed, through the adequate selection of the size and chemical characteristics of the substituents on the TDZD ring we have obtained compounds that are very stable against plasma molecules such as glutathion and BSA, and have shown good oral bioavailability and blood banner penetration.<br>
Ri comprises an aromatic group, this improves the stability properties. In an embodiment R| has at least 10 aromatic carbons. Alternatively, good compounds are obtained with electron donating groups on the aromatic ring such as alkoxyl or methylendioxy.<br><br>
Although R1 can be linked to the TDZD through any group as long as it is not -C(O)- (because of degradation and poor stability in plasma), it is preferred that the aromatic group is directly linked to the N of the TDZD.<br>
Representative substituents that can be used as Rj are the following:<br><br>
Very good results of stability and bioavailability in vivo have been obtained with a bulky aromatic group such as naphthyl. In particular alpha-naphthyl has given good results. When Rj is alpha-naphthyl, it is preferred that it is an unsubstituted alpha-naphthyl.<br>
Concerning the substituent at position 4 of the TDZD, it is preferred that Ra and Rb are H.<br>
In another embodiment it is preferred that R2. R3 R4 R5, R6 are independently selected from hydrogen, substituted or unsubstituted alky], COR7, -C(0)OR7, -OR7,  -NR7Rx- or<br>
halogen.<br><br><br><br><br>
And their salts, prodrugs and solvates.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) defined above can be obtained by available synthetic procedures. Some examples of these procedures are described in WO 01/85685 and US 2003/0195238 and references therein. The content of these documents is incoiporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
Therefore in another aspect the invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound of formula (I) or a salt or solvate thereof as claimed in any of claims 1-11, which comprises reacting a benzyl substituted isothiocyanate of formula II<br><br>
with a compound of formula RrN=C=0.<br>
For example, the following procedure can be used to produce 4-N-benzyl substituted thiadiazolidinones:<br><br><br>
The general experimental procedure of Scheme 1 is described for example in Slomczynska, U.; Barany, G., "Efficient Synthesis of l,2,4-Dithiazolidine-3,5-diones (Dithiasuccinoyl-amines) and observations on formation of l,2,4-Thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione by related Chemistry", J. Heterocyclic Chern., 1984, 27, 241-246.<br>
For example, sulfuryl chloride is added dropwise with stirring, under nitrogen atmosphere, preferably at low temperature, preferably at about 5 °C, to a solution of benzyl isothiocyanate and the isocyanate indicated in each case, in a suitable solvent such as hexane, ether or THF. When the addition is finished, the mixture is left to react, for example by stirring for 20 hours at room temperature. After this time, the resulting product is isolated by conventional methods such as suction filtration or solvent evaporation and then, the purification is performed (e.g. by recristallization or silica gel column chromatography using the appropriate eluent).<br>
Other alternative procedures will be apparent to the person skilled in the art, such as the use of any other chlorinating agent instead of sulfuryl chloride, variations in the order of addition of the reactants and reaction conditions (solvents, temperature, etc).<br>
The reaction products may, if desired, be purified by conventional methods, such as crystallisation, chromatography and trituration.<br>
One preferred pharmaceutically acceptable form is the crystalline form, including such form in a pharmaceutical composition. In the case of salts and solvates the additional ionic and solvent moieties must also be non-toxic. The compounds of the<br><br>
invention may present different polymorphic forms, it is intended that the invention encompasses all such forms.<br>
Another aspect of this invention relates to a method of treating or preventing an GSK-3 mediated disease with an GSK-3 inhibitor as described above, which method comprises administering to a patient in need of such a treatment a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutical composition thereof.<br>
The terms "GSK-3 mediated disease, or "GSK-3 mediated condition", as used 1 herein, mean any disease or other deleterious condition or state in which GSK-3 is known to play a role. Such diseases or conditions include, without limitation, diabetes, conditions associated with diabetes, chronic neurodegenerative conditions including dementias such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, progressive supranuclear palsy, subacute sclerosing panencephalitic parkinsonism, postencephalitic parkinsonism, pugilistic encephalitis, guam parkinsonism-dementia complex, Pick's disease, corticobasal degeneration, frontotemporal dementia, Huntington's Disease, AIDS associated dementia, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, multiple sclerosis and neurotraumatic diseases such as acute stroke, epilepsy, mood disorders such as depression, schizophrenia and bipolar disorders, promotion of functional recovery post stroke, cerebral bleeding (for example, due to solitary cerebral amyloid angiopathy), hair loss, obesity, atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, hypertension, polycystic ovary syndrome, syndrome X. ischaemia, brain injury, especially traumatic brain injury, cancer, leukopenia, Down's syndrome, Lewy body disease, inflammation, chronic inflammatory diseases, cancer and hyperproliferative diseases as hyperplasias and immunodeficiency.<br>

Alzheimer's disease.<br>

diabetes.<br><br>

Synthesis of compounds<br>
General experimental procedure:<br>
Sulfuryl chloride is added dropwise with stirring, under nitrogen atmosphere, at 5 °C to a solution of benzyl isothiocyanate and the isocyanate indicated in each case, in hexane, ether or THF. When the addition is finished, the mixture is stirred for 20 hours at room temperature. After this time, the resulting product is isolated by suction filtration or by solvent evaporation and then, the purification is performed by reciistallization or silica gel column chromatography using the appropriate eluent. More details can be found in Slomczynska, U.; Barany, G., "Efficient Synthesis of 1,2,4-Dithiazolidine-3,5-diones (Dithiasuccinoyl-amines) and observations on formation of l,2,4-Thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione by related Chemistry", J.

Biological Methods Example 11<br>
GSK-3P inhibition<br>
The GSK-3P activity was determined by incubation of a mixture of recombinant human GSK-3 enzyme, a phosphate source and GSK-3 substrate in the presence and in the absence of the corresponding test compound, and by measuring the GSK-3 activity of this mixture.<br>
Recombinant human glycogen synthase kinase 3B was assayed in MOPS 8 mM pH 7.3, EDTA 0.2 mM, MgClo 10 mM and sodium orthovanadate 0.25 mM in the presence of 62.5 μM of Phospho-Glycogen Synthase Peptide-2 (GS-2), 0.5 μCi y-33P-ATP and unlabelled ATP at a final concentration of 12.5 μM. The final assay volume was 20 \x\. After incubation for 30 minutes at 30 °C, 15 μL aliquots were spotted onto P81 phosphocellulose papers. Filters were washed four times for at least 10 minutes each and counted with 1.5 ml of scintillation cocktail in a scintillation counter. The compounds IC50 values were calculated analyzing inhibition curves by non-linear regression using GraphPad Prism.<br>
The IC50 (concentration at which 50 % of enzyme inhibition is shown) values are gathered in table 1.<br>

Sample Preparation<br>
The compounds (working solution at 1 mM) were incubated during 30 minutes at room<br>
temperature with Glutathione (Sigma) and Bovine serum albumin (Fraction V) (Sigma)<br>
at equimolecular concentrations (1 mM ). After this time the solution was filtrated and<br>
analysed by HPLC-UV/MS.<br>
Chromatographic methods<br>
HPLC was performed with a symmetry CI8 ( 2.1x150mm. 3.5μm column using a<br>
Waters Alliance 2695 with a 2996 photodiode array and ZQ2000 mass spectrometer<br><br><br><br>
unbinding compounds in the two assays. The presence of an aromatic group at position 2 (R|) of the TDZD clearly improves the properties of these compounds. This effect is bigger if there are at least 10 aromatic carbons present in the substituent, or electrondonating substituents such as in compounds 5 and 10. We can also observe that when the aromatic group is directly linked to the N of the TDZD the results are better. Best results were obtained with phenyloxyphenyl and with alpha-naphthyl.<br>
These data are clearly better than those of previous TDZD compounds. Indeed, previously described 2,4,-dibenzyl-l,2,4-thiadiazolidine-3,5-dione with a smaller substituent at position 2 of the thiadiazolidinone gives a value of 17,1 in the gluthatione assay and 57,0 in the albumin assay, much lower than for example present compound 4 which has an additional methyl group, and in the range of comparative example 3 which has no aromatic rings. And the compound with R| = benzoyl decomposes during the assays thus performing much worse than the compounds of formula I.<br>
Example 13<br>
Brain permeation after oral and intravenous administration<br>
This study was conducted at CIDA S.A.L., Sta Perpetua de Mogola (Barcelona)<br>
Spain.<br>
The objective of this study was investigate the pharmacokinetic behaviour of<br>
compound 2 (R( = alpha-naphthyl) and its possible accumulation in the brain tissue<br>
after both oral and intravenous administration.<br>
C57/BL6 mice (15-30g) from Charles River laboratories Spain were used in this<br>
study. All the mice had free access to the dried, pelleted standard mouse diet. Water<br>
was available ad libitum. Animals were fasted for 4 hours before treatment, but with<br>
water ad libitum. They were fed 2 hours after administration.<br>
Compound 2 was formulated in 10.0% PEG400. 10.0% Cremophor in bidistilled water. The route of administration was a single oral administration at 20 g/kg (10 mL/kg) and single intravenous administration at 2 mg'kg (10 mL/kg). An additional<br><br>
experiment was performed at 200 mg/kg by the oral route only to determine<br>
proportionality of absorption.<br>
Four animals (2 males and 2 females) were used at each extraction time. Blood was<br>
heparinised, and after centrifugation (3000rpm, 10 mins, 5°C), two plasma aliquots<br>
stored at -20°C and -30 °C until analysis (HPLC/MS-MS).<br>
The summary of the experiment results is showed in the table 3.<br><br>
Compound 2 is quickly absorbed from the Gl tract after oral administration. A half-life of 6 hours was found after an oral administration of 20 mg/kg. Compound 2 presented a bioavailability of 31.87%. Levels of Compound 2 were detected in the brain, both after oral and intravenous administration. This shows that compounds of formula I above have good bioavailability properties and are suitable for development as a drug for the treatment of GSK-3 mediated diseases or conditions.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
