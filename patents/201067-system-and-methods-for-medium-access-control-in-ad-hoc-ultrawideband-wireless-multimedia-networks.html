				<td>FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention relates to the field of medium access control for ad hoc multimedia networks. More specifically, this invention relates to the field of medium access control for ad hoc Ultra-Wideband wireless multimedia networks.<br>
PRESENT STATE OF ART<br>
Ultra-Wideband (UWB) systems are mostly based on the Impulse Radio (IR) technology which uses very short pulses (such as of 0.1 to 1.5 nanoseconds). It results in wide spectral occupation in the frequency domain. One definition of a UWB transmission is a signal whose fractional bandwidth, Bf1 is larger than<br>
2(f - f ) 0.25, where Bf =-±Ui—±LLi where fH is the highest frequency and fL is the<br>
JH "*"//.<br>
lowest frequency in the transmission band.<br>
In general, an UWB network consists of TermiNodes (TNs) that are small personal devices that act both as a node and a terminal. As a terminal, a TN can initiate communication with another end-system. As a node, it forwards incoming data to an outgoing link. It includes transmission from a radio link to a radio link, from a radio link to a fixed link and from a fixed link to a radio link. Each node possesses a UWB transceiver for wireless communication with other nodes.<br>
Role of the medium access control (MAC) protocol is to coordinate transmission access to the channel that is shared by all the TNs, provide Quality of Service (QoS) guarantees for different applications and provide security. MAC domain of a TN includes the TN itself and other TNs which are within its radio range.<br>
A multi-hop UWB domain is the wireless area where the UWB technology is used and the multi-hop connectivity is exploited to obtain an end-to-end wireless communication path. Networking protocols work in this domain. Each TN works as a terminal and a node (router). An example of a distributed ad hoc network architecture consisting of a multi-hop domain is shown in Figure 1.<br><br>
In CSMA/CA, each node monitors the status of the channel before transmitting information. If channel is idle, a node is allowed to transmit a packet. If channel is sensed to be busy, the node defers transmission to a later time using an exponential backoff mechanism. In order to reduce the probability of two nodes colliding because they cannot listen to each other, CSMA/CA introduces a virtual carrier sending mechanism. Here, a source node which wants to transmit a packet first transmits a short control packet called RTS (request to send). This packet includes information for the source node, destination node and duration of the following transmission. The destination senses the medium and if it finds it free, transmits a CTS (clear to send) control packet that includes the same duration information. All nodes listening to either RTS or CTS packet, use this duration information along with physical carrier sensing when they want to use the medium. CSMA/CA as used in WLAN is shown in the Figure 2.<br>
The RTS frame has been shown in Figure 3 which consists of the five time slots:<br>
1)	In the first field, the frame control is transmitted;<br>
2)	The second field consists of the duration of the transmission which is going to occur;<br>
3)	In the third field the address of the receiving device is transmitted;<br>
4)	In the fourth field the address of the Transmitting device is transmitted;<br>
5)	In the fifth field, a CRC code is sent for error detection.<br>
With reference to Figure 4 CTS Frame Format has been shown where :<br>
1)	In the first field, the frame control is transferred;<br>
2)	In the second field, the duration of the transmission to be followed is specified;<br>
3)	In the third field, the address of the receiving device is transmitted;<br>
4)	Next a CRC code is transmitted for error detection.<br>
In WLAN, as specified in the IEEE 802.11x standards, available at www.ieee.org, the destination also sends an acknowledgement (ACK) back to the source node if the packet was received correctly. We note that this ACK feature is available in the CSMA/CA which is used for WLAN, but does not<br><br>
necessarily have to be part of other systems where CSMA/CA is used. If ACK is<br>
not used, then CSMA/CA protocol's slot configuration is as shown in the Figure<br>
5. Here, following notations are used:<br>
Ts: Minimum time needed to sense carrier (like DIFS in IEEE802.11)<br>
Tacq: Channel acquisition time during which source and destination nodes<br>
achieve bit synchronization<br>
Trts: Time to transmit RTS packet<br>
Tcts: Time to transmit CTS packet<br>
Tdata: Time to transmit data<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
A UWB network would typically need to support applications that are used in current internet such as multimedia conferencing, streaming, VoIP, web browsing etc. These applications have different requirements in terms of their delay bound, delay jitter rate, loss, and average delay. Current MAC protocols such as CSMA/CA and TDMA cannot specify these goals. There is need for an efficient MAC protocol which controls access to the channel and provides QoS guarantees for different types of applications present in a UWB network.<br>
It should also decide length of packets to be transmitted for each TN. UWB technology uses pico-second precision rules, and impulse radio and due to this the channel acquisition time can be very high. It can seriously impact MAC layer performance especially in protocols such as CSMA/CA where a node may also need wait to acquire the channel. If packet length is too short, it can result in poor performance due to high channel acquisition time. If packet lengths are too large, it can result in poor performance of other delay and/or jitter sensitive applications. As,bit-error rate is usually higher in wireless channels than in wired networks, longer packet lengths can also result in high packet error rate.<br>

and all other TNs<br>
each TN conveys its own value of<br>
V aSS _ servedrate(t d) j<br>
receive this value and thereby the length of packet that transmittable when it gets access to physical channel is computed.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further comprises a method of enhanced CSMA/CA medium access control for ad hoc UWB network where applications specify their delay bound, jitter and rate requirements, termed ECSMA/CA/QoS MAC, where RTS and CTS frames are extended such that each TN conveys its information related to delay bound, and buffer in addition to average delay and rate control information in that for delay bound related information, each TN considers all its multiple flows which have requirements for delay bound and jitter and the head-of-line packet for all such delay and jitter sensitive flows of a TN. where delay bound for this flow is dbound(m,k)\  wtime(m9k,tdk)  is   the time<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
ECSMA/CA/Rate MAC System for UWB Wireless Networks<br>
We consider a UWB MAC domain where each TN is in the transmission range of any other TN in that domain, thus each TN can directly communicate with any other TN in that domain. Next, we consider a scenario where each TN has one or more applications with rate requirement only. There could be multiple applications per TN. Thus applications running have either rate requirements or have no QoS requirements at all. It is possible that some of these applications have some other QoS requirements too but only the rate requirements are strict and other requirements are quite loose and these applications choose to explicitly specify only the rate requirements in a UWB network. Thus all applications which do not specify their rate requirements are considered to be best effort applications. In such situations, a network operator can use Enhanced CSMA/CA (ECSMA/CA/Rate) proposed here in a UWB network. In essence, the ECSMA/CA/Rate invented here is for UWB networking systems where applications either specify their QoS requirements in terms of their required rate or do not specify any QoS requirement.<br>
Referring to figure 6 , TNk has some data to send to TNZ. It senses that the<br>
channel is idle. It waits for a minimum fixed amount of time period, Tidle flX€d to<br>
check if the channel stays idle. If the channel stays idle, it computes a random amount of time which depends upon network state, required QoS and observed QoS. If the channel stays idle for this random amount of time also,   TNk<br>
computes length of the data packet that it is allowed to send at that time as per the ECSMA/CA/Rate MAC and sends an ERTS_Rate(k) message to TNZ. The<br>
TNz   upon   successfully  receiving  this   message,   sends  an   ECTS_Rate(z)<br><br>
message to 77V*. The TN, 77V*, upon successfully receiving the ECTS_Rate(z) message, sends the data packet.<br>
In figure 7,77Vk has some data to send to TNZ. It senses that the channel is idle.<br>
It waits for a minimum fixed amount of time period, Tidle flxed to check if the<br>
channel stays idle. If the channel stays idle, it computes a random amount of time which depends upon network state, required QoS and observed QoS. If the channel stays idle for this random amount of time also, 77Vk computes length of<br>
the data packet that it is allowed to send at that time as per the ECSMA/CA/Rate MAC and sends an ERTS_Rate(k) message to TNZ. The 77Vz upon successfully<br>
receiving this message, sends a ECTS_Rate(z) message to 77V*. It also starts a<br>
timer Twait dala. The TN, 77V*, upon successfully receiving the ECTS_Rate(z)<br>
message, starts sending the data packet. This data packet may be lost or get corrupted. In such an event, the TN, 77V2, waits for Twait data, and sends an<br>
RTx_Data_Req request, asking 77Vk to retransmit the data packet.<br>
Let agg_reqratek   be the aggregate required rate of 77V*. If there are multiple<br>
application on a TN with rate requirements only, add the required rate of each application on a TN to compute aggregate required rate of each TN.<br>
In the system described here, each TN runs ECS MA/C A/Rate MAC. A UWB MAC domain consists of a distributed system and each TN needs to decide how much of data can it sends when it gets right to transmit on the channel. There is no centralized access point or coordinator in the system here. Thus, each TN needs to take a decision in a fair manner otherwise performance of applications running on other TNs would be impacted.<br>
Let agg_servedrate(t,k) be the aggregate served rate of 77V* at time t. It is the sum of served rate of all the applications running on a TN. Let tdk be an arbitrary  time  when   77V*   has  got  access  to  channel  with  the   use  of<br><br>
ECSMA/CA/Rate and is ready to send data.   Let L{td,k) be the length of data that TNk would be allowed to send with the ECSMA/CA protocol invented here.<br>
Suppose a TN,77VA, wants to send data to another TN, TNZ ai time tdk. There<br>
could be other TNs in the system which are already sending or receiving data at time tadJi or which also have data to send at time tdk.    If the TN,  TNk, is<br>
successful in getting access to the physical channel as per the ECSMA/CA/Rate MAC, which is described later in this document, we denote this time by tdk.<br>
Here, tdk &gt; tdk and tdk is the first time instant after tdk when TNk is allowed to start sending control packets to TNZ as per ECSMA/CA/Rate protocol.<br>
A UWB networking system with the ECSMA/CA/Rate MAC works as follows.<br>
1.	If at time tdk, the TN, TNk,    finds the channel is idle, it waits for a<br>
minimum fixed period of time to see if channel stays idle. (This step is similar to what is done in CSMA/CA). This minimum amount of time is pre-specified and we denote this by Tidle flxed<br>
2.	If the channel stays idle for Tidle flxed  in step 1 above, TNk waits for an<br>
additional random amount of time which is computed as a function of network state, required QoS for each TN and observed QoS for each TN.<br>
For TNk, we denote this period of time by tdk.<br>
3.	If the channel stays idle for Tidle flxed   and for random amount of time<br>
computed   in   step   2   (i.e.    T™dom{tadk)\   the   TN,    TNk,   sends   an<br>
ERTS_Rate(k) packet to the TN, 7Wz(i.e. the TN whom it wants to send<br>
data to). This ERTS_Rate packet includes observed and required rate related information, and is described in the methods below. In this packet, it sets the duration field to be greater than or equal to the value of time that would be taken to send ERTS_Rate, ECTS_Rate and data<br><br>
packet in that network. TNs other than TNk and TNZ, use this value of duration and do not attempt transmission during this period.<br>
4.	If TN2 receives this packet successfully, it waits for a fixed amount of time<br>
(which we denote by Tinier flxed) and if it is ready to receive data from TNk,<br>
it sends a ECTS_Rate(z) packet to TNk. This packet includes observed<br>
and required rate related information. In the duration field, it sets a value which is greater than or equal to the time period needed for TNZ for<br>
sending the ECTS_Rate(z) message and an estimate of time for TNk\o<br>
send a data packet of size ACQ to TNZ. TNs other than TNk and TNZ,<br>
use this value of duration and do not attempt transmission during this period.<br>
5.	After sending the ECTS_Rate(z) packet, the TN,  TNZ, starts a timer<br>
(referred to as TwaU data timer here),   and waits for maximum amount of<br>
time which is equal to a pre-specified positive real number, Twait data. If TN2 does not receive data from TNk before expiry of the Twait data timer, it sends a RTx_Data_Req(z) message to TNk, informing TNk that the data was not received. Figure 7 shows an example of this situation.<br>
6.	If TNZ still doesn't receive data from TNk before the expiry of the timer<br>
Twait_data, it can resend the RTx_Data_Req(z) message to TNk, informing<br>
TNk that the data packet was not received.   The TN, TNZ, can do for<br>
maximum	of	Max_RTx_Data_Req(z)	times,	where<br>
Max_RTx_Data_Req(z) is an integer positive finite number for TN, TNZ.<br>
7.	Upon   receiving  the  ECTS_Rate(z)  or the  RTx_Data_Req(z)  packet<br>
successfully, the TN, TNk, waits for Tin{er flxed and starts data transmission<br>
to TNz. In this data packet, it sets a value in the duration field which is equal to the time needed for TNk to transmit this data packet. Other TNs<br><br>
use this value of duration and do not attempt transmission during this period. Length of this data packet is chosen as described in the Method I below.<br>
8.	If the TN, TN2, receives data from TNk but data is not received correctly, it sends an RTx_Data_Req(z) message to TNk, informing TNk that the data packet was not received correctly. After this, the TN, TNZ, starts a timer, Twait data and waits to receive the correct data from TNk.<br>
9.	If data is still not received correctly or not received at all, the TN,   TNZ,<br>
can retry sending RTx_Data_Req(z) message for the maximum of Max_RTxJDataJReq(z) times. Each time a TN waits for maximum of TWait data time period before resending a RTxJDataJReq message.<br>
10.	If the data is received correctly or Max__Rtx_Data__Req(z) number of<br>
attempts have been exhausted by the TN, TNZ, the system goes back to<br>
step 1.<br><br>
agg _ reqrate<br>
to use the above. For this<br>
Each TN needs to know the<br>
mm<br>
V aSS _ servedrate{t d ) j<br>
purpose, we use two different types of message formats.<br>
For Type-I message format, we extend the RTS frame as well as the CTS frame and append a 1-byte field to each of these to convey the rate control information. We call this a "Rate_Cntrl" field. We show the extended RTS frame, ERTS_Rate, in Figure 8, extended CTS frame, ECTS_Rate, in Figure 9 and rate control field, Rate_Cntrl, in Figure 10.<br><br>
In the Rate_Cntrl field, in the bits b1 to b7 (as in Figure 10), each TN carries its<br>
. The first bit of this field, bO in Figure 10, is set to 1 if<br>
agg _ reqrate<br>
V	aSS _ servedrate{td) j<br>
agg _ reqrate<br>
V	aSS _ servedrate(td ) j<br><br>
&gt;1, otherwise the first bit, bO, is set to 0.<br><br><br>
We now propose a type II frame format for ERTS_Rate and ECTS_Rate frames which is shown in the Figure 11, 12 and 13. Figure 11 shows a QoS control field, QoS_Cntrl, First two bits of this field are used to convey rate control related information and other six bits are not used for ECSMA/CA/Rate MAC systems. ERTS_Rate and ECTS_Rate frames carry one-octet QoS_Cntrl field.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Method II<br>
In the ECSMA/CA/Rate MAC invented here, a TN, TNk, which has data to send at time t, and has found the channel idle for Tidle Jixed period of time, computes a<br>
random amount of time T™dom and waits to see if the channel stays idle for that<br>
period and then only it can start sending data. To compute, random backoff period, an exponential backoff is used as in the CSMA/CA MAC. In the system described here, the backoff period is computed after taking into account required rate and observed rate of applications running on that TN. Let Tc be the size of<br>
contention window at any given time. For the system here, choose a random<br>
W<br>
positive number in the range (0,	*rc)   and use this as the<br>
frac _ agg _ rate(t, k)<br>
backoff timer. Here, Wk is a pre-specified real positive number for the TN, TNk.<br><br><br><br><br>
ECSMA/CA/AvqDelav/Rate MAC System for Ad Hoc UWB Wireless Networks<br>
We consider a UWB network where each application on a TN has one of the following three types of requirements:<br>
-	QoS requirements in terms of average delay and required rate,<br>
-	QoS requirements in terms of required rate only,<br>
-	Best effort applications with no QoS requirements.<br>
There could be multiple applications per TN and each of these could have diverse type of QoS requirement such as rate requirement, or rate and average delay requirements, or have no QoS requirements at all.     In the system described here, each TN runs ECSMA/CA/AvgDelay/Rate MAC. Let  agg_reqratek     be the aggregate required rate of  TNk   considering all<br>
applications for the TN,  TNk, which have requirements on rate (i.e. either<br>
applications with requirement on rate only or applications with requirement on rate and average delay). Add the required rate of each application on a TN to compute aggregate required rate of each TN.   Let agg _servedrate(t,k) be the<br>
aggregate served rate of TNk at time t. It is the sum of served rate of all the<br>
applications running on a TN.   Let   tdk be an arbitrary time when TNk has got<br><br>
access to channel with the use of ECSMA/CA/AvgDelay/Rate and is ready to send data.  Let L{td,k) be the length of data that TNk would be allowed to send<br>
with the ECSMA/CA/AvgDelay/Rate protocol invented here.<br>
Suppose a TN,77Vftl wants to send data to another TN, TN 2ai time tdk. There<br>
could be other TNs in the system which are already sending or receiving data at time tdk or which also have data to send at time tdk.    If the TN,  TNk, is<br>
successful in sending in getting access to the physical channel as per the ECSMA/CA/AvgDelay/Rate MAC, which is described later in this invention document, we denote this time by tdk. Here, tdk &gt; tdk and tdk is the first time<br>
instant after tdk when TNk is allowed to start sending control packets to TN2 as per ECSMA/CA/AvgDelay/Rate MAC protocol.<br>
Consider a flow h of the TN TNk which has requirements for its average delay and rate. Let d°afg{k,h,tdk) be the observed average queuing delay of the IP packets flow h of the TN, 77V,, at the time tdk and d^gget{k,h)be the target queuing delay of flow h of the TN, TNk. Note that this observed average delay is in the queues in the TN, TNk, where packets have to wait before they get a chance to be transmitted. d'Jgget(.) is a finite positive real number.<br>
We extend the ERTS_Rate frame as well as the ECTS_Rate frame and append a 1-byte field, AvgDelay_Cntrl, to each of these to convey the average delay control information. We show the extended RTS frame, ERTS_AvgDelay_Rate, in Figure 14, extended CTS frame, ECTS_AvgDelay_Rate, in Figure 15 and average control field, AvgDelay_Cntrl, in Figure 16.<br><br><br><br>
Thus if TNa wants to send data to TNb, it sends an   ERTS_AvgDelay_Rate message after getting access to channel via the ECSMA/CA/AvgDelay/Rate<br><br>
its average delay control field. Every other TN listens to this packet and comes to know value of the rate control and average delay control fields of TNa.<br>
Every other TN in the network listens to this ERTS_AvgDelay_Rate packet and makes note of the values given in the rate control and average delay control<br><br>
its average delay control field.  Every other TN listens to this packet and comes to know value of the rate control and average delay control fields of TNb.<br><br><br>
 considering all the flows for which observed average queuing delay is more than target queuing average delay.<br>
This invention also proposes a type II frame format for ERTS_AvgDelay_Rate and ECTS__AvgDelay_Rate frames which is shown in the Figure 18 and 19. Figure 17 shows a QoS control field, QoS__Cntrl, First two bits of this field are used to convey rate control related information, next two bits are used to convey average delay rated information, and other four bits are not used for ECSMA/CA/AvgDelay/Rate MAC systems. ERTS_AvgDelay_Rate and ECTS_AvgDelay_Rate frames carry one-octet QoS_Cntrl field.<br>
We define the following:<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Method VI<br>
In the ECSMA/CA/AvgDelay/Rate MAC invented here, a TIM,   TNk, which has data to send at time t, and has found the channel idle for Tidle flxed period of time,<br>
computes a random amount of time Trandom and waits to see if the channel stays<br>
idle for that period and then only it can start sending data. To compute, random backoff period, an exponential backoff is used as in the CSMA/CA MAC.<br><br><br>
A threshold,  frac_avgdelay_viol   thres_1A,    is pre-specified for each flow h<br>
which       has       requirement       for       its       average       delay.        Here, frac   avgdelay   viol_thres_\h       is      a      positive      real      number      and<br>
frac _ avgdelay __ viol _ thres _ 1 h &gt;0.0.<br><br>
Here, D(k) is a pre-specified positive real number for each TN,  TNk   and D(A:)&gt;1.0.<br>
ECSMA/CA/QoS   MAC  System  for Ad   Hoc  UWB  Wireless   Multimedia Networks<br>
We consider a UWB wireless multimedia network where applications have diverse tvoe of QoS reauirements. These include:<br><br>
-	multimedia applications which have QoS requirements in terms of delay bound, jitter and required rate,<br>
-	applications which have QoS requirements in terms of average delay and required rate,<br>
-	applications which have QoS requirements in terms of required rate only,<br>
-	best effort applications with no QoS requirements.<br>
There could be multiple applications per TN and each of these could have diverse type of QoS requirement. In the system described here, each TN runs ECSMA/CA/QoS MAC. Let agg_reqratek be the aggregate required rate of TNk<br>
considering all applications for the TN, TNk, which have requirements on rate<br>
(i.e. either applications with requirement on rate only or applications with requirement on rate and average delay or application with requirements on delay bound, rate and jitter). Add the required rate of each application on a TN to compute aggregate required rate of each TN. Let agg _servedrate(t,k) be the<br>
aggregate served rate of TNk at time t. It is the sum of served rate of all the<br>
applications running on a TN which have some sort of QoS requirements and does not include best effort applications. Let tdk be an arbitrary time when TNh<br>
has got access to channel with the use of ECSMA/CA/QoS MAC and is ready to send data.  Let L(tdh) be the length of data that TNk would be allowed to send<br>
with the ECSMA/CA/QoS protocol invented here.<br>
Suppose a TN.77V*, wants to send data to another TN, TNZ at time tdk. There<br>
could be other TNs in the system which are already sending or receiving data at time tdk or which also have data to send at time tadk.    If the TN,  TNk, is<br>
successful in sending in getting access to the physical channel as per the ECSMA/CA/QoS MAC, which is described later in this invention document, we<br>
denote this time by tdk. Here, tdk &gt; tdk and tdk is the first time instant after tdk when TNk is allowed to start sending control packets to TNZ as per ECSMA/CA/QoS MAC protocol.<br><br>
Consider a flow h of the TN TNk which has requirements for its average delay and rate. Let d°al$g(k,h,tdk) be the observed average queuing delay of the IP packets flow h of the TN, TNk, at the time tdk and dfa^ei(k9h)be the target queuing delay of flow h of the TN, TNk. At any given time, tdk, choose one flow with requirements over average delay and rate for the TN, TNk. To select such a flow, use the mechanism presented in the ECSMA/CA/AvgDelay/Rate MAC<br><br>
is minimum at that time considering only those flows for which observed average queuing delay is higher than target average queuing delay.<br>
We extend the ERTS_AvgDelay_Rate frame as well as the ECTS_AvgDelay_Rate frame and append a 1-byte field, Buffer_Cntrl, and another one byte field, DBound_Cntrl, to each of these frames to convey buffer and delay bound related information. We show the extended RTS frame, ERTS_QoS, in Figure 22, extended CTS frame, ECTS_QoS, in Figure 23. We call these type-l frames.<br>
Rate_Cntrl field is used as in the ECSMA/CA/Rate MAC and AvgDelay_Cntrl field is used as in the ECSMA/CA/AvgDelay/Rate MAC. Each of these is a one octet field. The first bit indicates how to interpret information in the remaining seven bits.<br>
For Buffer_Cntrl and DBound_Cntrl, we simply use one octet field each for Type-I frames. Both of these fields carry non-negative values.<br>
We also propose a Type II, ERTS_QoS Frame and a Type II, ECTS_Frame. These are shown in the Figure 25 and 26. Each of these uses a one octet QoS control field which is shown in the Figure 24. Here, we use 2 bits for rate control related information, 2 bits for average delay related information, 2 bits for buffer depth related information and 2 bits for delay bound related information.<br><br>
In Figure 25 :<br>
1)	In the first field, the frame control is transmitted;<br>
2)	In the second field, the duration of the transmission which is to follow is specified;<br>
3)	In the third field, the address of the receiving device is specified;<br>
4)	In the fourth field, the address of the transmitting device is specified;<br>
5)	In the fifth field, an octet rate control field is transmitted which consists of 2 bits for rate control related information, 2 bits for average delay related information, 2 bits for buffer depth related information and 2 bits for delay bound related information;<br>
6)	The last field consists of a CRC code for error detection.<br>
The frame structure as shown in Figure 26 is as follows:<br>
1)	The first field consists of the frame control bits;<br>
2)	The second field consists of the duration of the transmission that is to follow;<br>
3)	The third field consists of the address of the receiving device;<br>
4)	The fourth field consists of the octet Qos control field;<br>
5)	The fifth and the final field consist of the CRC code for error detection.<br>
Each TN considers all its flows which have requirements for delay bound, jitter or average delay and adds length of pending packets for these flows. For TN, TNk,<br>
at time, tdk1 we denote this by agg_buff(tdfc,k). Each TN, TNk, informs other<br>
nodes of the value of its agg_buff, considering only those flows which have requirements for delay bound, average delay or jitter, by including this information in the ERTS_QoS and ECTS_QoS frames. If Type I frame is used, then one octet is available for this information.<br>
If type-ll frame is used, then 2 bits are available to carry this information. The bits (b4, b5) in the QoS_Cntrl field are used for this purpose as given here. Let there be two pre-specified thresholds, aggbuff jh\ and aggbuff  thl such that<br>
agg_buff _th2 &gt; agg_buff Jh\ &gt; 0.<br><br>
1.	If agg_buff(td,k,k)&gt;agg_buff _th2, set (b4, b5)=(1. 1) in the QoS_Cntrl<br>
field of the TN which is sending such a message. The receiving TN would set agg_buff of the sending TN to be equal to agg_buff_th2.<br>
2.	If aggjmff Jh\<agg_buff jhl set b5 in></agg_buff>
the QoS_Cntrl field of the TN which is sending such a message. The receiving TN would set agg_buff of the sending TN to be equal to agg_buff_th1.<br>
3.	If   0   <agg_buff set b5 in the></agg_buff>
QoS_Cntrl field of the TN which is sending such a message. The receiving TN would set agg_buff of the sending TN to be equal to a small positive number fu such that 0 
4.	If agg_buff(tdtk9k)=0, set (b4, b5)=(0,0) in the QoS_Cntrl field of the TN<br>
which is sending such a message.<br>
To compute value of DBound_Cntrl, each TN considers all its flows which have requirements for delay bound and jitter. There could be multiple flows with requirements for delay bound and jitter for each TN. Consider the head-of-line packet for all such delay and jitter sensitive flows of a TN. This is the packet which has been in the queue (in TN) for maximum amount of time for that flow.<br>
Consider head-of-line packet of each delay and jitter sensitive flows for each TN, TNk, at time, tdk, and   select a flow for which difference of the waiting time in<br>
the system and delay bound of that flow is maximum. Suppose flow m is such a selected flow for the TN, TNh% at time, td%k. Let delay bound for this flow be<br>
dbound(m,k). Let wtime(m,k,tdk) denote the time period for which the head-of-line packet of flow m for the TN, TNh, has been in the system by the time tdk. If<br>
a packet has been in a queue in the TN for a period which is greater than delay bound  of the  corresponding  flow,   then  it  is  discarded.  Thus  we  have,<br><br>
wtime(m,k,tdk)
for the head-of-line packet for this flow m considering all the delay and jitter sensitive flows of the TN, TNk, at time, tdk.<br>
For such a flow of the TN, TNk, at time, tdk, we say:<br>
delta _ rem{k, tdk) = (dbound(m9 k) - wtime(m, k, td k))<br>
Each TN,  TNk1 informs other nodes of the value of its delta _rem{kjdk), by<br>
including this information in the ERTS_QoS and ECTS_QoS frames. If Type I frame is used, then one octet is available for this information.<br>
If type-ll frame is used, then 2 bits are available to carry this information. The bits (b6, b7) in the QoS_Cntrl field are used for this purpose as given here. Let there be    three    pre-specified    thresholds,    delta _ rem _ thO,    delta _ rem _ th\    and<br>
delta _ rem _ thl,   such   that      delta _ rem _ thl &gt; delta _ rem _ th\ &gt; delta _ rem _ thO &gt;<br>
0.0.<br>
1.	If delta_rem(kjdk)&gt;delta   rem   thl, set (b6, b7)=(1, 1) in the QoS_Cntrl<br>
field of the TN which is sending such a message. The receiving TN would set DBound_Cntrl field of the sending TN to be equal to delta _rem jhl.<br>
2.	If delta_rem_th\
0) in the QoS_Cntrl field of the TN which is sending such a message. The receiving TN would set DBound_Cntrl field of the sending TN to be equal to delta _ rem _ thl.<br>
3.	If delta   rem_th0<delta_rem delta_rem jh set b7 in></delta_rem>
the QoS_Cntrl field of the TN which is sending such a message. The receiving TN would set delta_rem of the sending TN to be equal to delta   rem_th0.<br>
4.	If    0<delta_rem delta_rem_th0 set b7 in the></delta_rem>
QoS_Cntrl field of the TN which is sending such a message. The<br><br>
receiving TN would set delta_rem of the sending TN to a small positive number o such that 0 
With reference to figure 27,Nk has some data to send to TNZ. It senses that<br>
the channel is idle. It waits for a minimum fixed amount of time period, Tidle flxed to<br>
check if the channel stays idle. If the channel stays idle, it computes a random amount of time which depends upon network state, required QoS and observed QoS. If the channel stays idle for this random amount of time also,  TNk<br>
computes length of the data packet that it is allowed to send at that time as per the ECSMA/CA/QoS MAC and sends an ERTS_QoS(k) message to TNZ. The<br>
TNZ upon successfully receiving this message, sends a ECTSJ3oS(z) message<br>
to TNk. The TN, TNk, upon successfully receiving the ECTS_QoS(z) message,<br>
sends the data packet.<br>
In figure 28, TNk has some data to send to TNZ. It senses that the channel is<br>
idle. It waits for a minimum fixed amount of time period, Tid{e ftxed to check if the<br>
channel stays idle. If the channel stays idle, it computes a random amount of time which depends upon network state, required QoS and observed QoS. If the channel stays idle for this random amount of time also, TNk computes length of<br>
the data packet that it is allowed to send at that time as per the ECSMA/CA/QoS MAC and sends an ERTS_QoS(k) message to TN2. The TNZ upon successfully<br>
receiving this message, sends a ECTS_QoS(z) message to TNk. It also starts a<br>
timer Twait data. The TN,  TNki upon successfully receiving the ECTS_QoS(z)<br>
message, starts sending the data packet. This data packet may be lost or get corrupted. In such an event, the TN, TNZ, waits for Twait data, and sends an<br>
RTx_Data_Req(z) request, asking TNk to retransmit the data packet.<br>
Method VIM<br>
If a delay and jitter sensitive flow needs to be served when the TN, TNh, has got access to send data at time tdk, we choose L(tdk) such that<br><br><br>
frac_rate_cntrl{tdk,k) is as defined in the ECSMA/CA/Rate MAC,<br>
ACQ = It is a pre-specified, minimum length of a packet needed to reduce the<br>
impact on MAC layer performance due to higher channel acquisition time in<br>
UWB systems,<br>
Time td = tdk,<br>
Bk: a pre-specified positive scaling constant for TNk, Bk eR+, for each TN TNk, A(k) is a pre-specified scaling constant for TNk, A(k)&gt; 1.0;<br>
Dk: a pre-specified positive scaling constant for TNk, Dk eR+, for each TN TNk, E(k) is a pre-specified scaling constant for TNk, E(k)&gt; 1.0;<br>
Method IX<br>
In the ECSMA/CA/QoS MAC invented here, a TN,  TNk, which has data to send at time t, and has found the channel idle for Tidle flxed period of time, computes a<br>
random amount of time T™kdom and waits to see if the channel stays idle for that<br><br>
period and then only it can start sending data. In the system described here, the backoff period is computed after taking into account required QoS and observed QoS of applications running on that TIM. Let Tc be the size of contention window<br>
at any given time. For the system here, choose a random positive number in the<br><br>
(a positive real number) threshold, and a delay and jitter sensitive flow of the TN, TNk, is selected to be served, then use as follows:<br><br>
Other steps remain similar to those presented in the Method VIII. Method XI<br>
If agg-buff(k,tdk)&gt;agg_buff _thres, where agg_buff_thres   is a pre-specified<br>
(a positive real number) threshold, and a delay and jitter sensitive flow of the TN, TNk, is selected to be served, then use as follows:<br><br>
Other steps remain similar to those presented in the Method VIII.<br>

time t, and has found the channel idle for Tidle fvced period of time, computes a random amount of time T™kdom and waits to see if the channel stays idle for that period and<br>
then starts sending data.in that the backoff period is computed after taking into account required QoS and observed QoS of applications running on that TN. and a<br>
selected as the backoff timer.<br>
17.	A method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the length of packet to be allowed to<br>
be transmitted via ECSMA/CA/QoS MAC when a TN gains access to channel, is<br>
computed in that if delta_rem(k,tdk)&gt; delta   rem   thres, where delta_rem_thres is a<br><br>
pre-specified (a positive real number) threshold, and a delay and jitter sensitive flow of the TN, TNk, is selected to be served, then :<br><br>
18.	A method as claimed in claim 14, wherein the length of packet to be allowed to<br>
be transmitted via ECSMA/CA/QoS MAC when a TN gains access to channel is<br>
computed in that If agg__buff(k,tdk)&gt; agg_buff _thres, where agg_buff_thres is a<br>
pre-specified (a positive real number) threshold, and a delay and jitter sensitive flow of the TN, TNk, is selected to be served, then :<br><br>
19.	An enhanced CSMA/CA/AvgDelay/Rate MAC System for ad hoc UWB Wireless<br>
Networks as substantially as herein described particularly with reference to the<br>
figures 6-28.<br>
20.	A method for enhanced CSMA/CA/Rate medium access control for ad hoc<br>
UWB Wireless Networks as substantially as herein described particularly with<br>
reference to the figures 6-28<br>
21.	A method for enhanced CSMA/CA/QoS Medium access control for ad hoc UWB<br>
network where applications specify their delay bound, jitter and rate requirements<br>
substantially as herein described particularly with reference to the figures 6-28<br>
