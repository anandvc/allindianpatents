				<td>Switchgear Cabinet with a Rack<br>
The invention relates to a switchgear cabinet with a rack<br><br>
               comprising having aligned centering surfaces a pedestal                              <br>
               made up  of  longitudinal  and depth<br>
braces and a vertical frame member connected thereto, the length and depth braces forming at their ends a receiving means into which the vertical frame members are inserted and welded to the pedestal to form a corner connection.<br>
Such a switchgear cabinet is for example known from DE 19 04 558.  In such switchgear cabinets a separate corner connector is omitted, so that the individual vertical frame members and longitudinal or depth braces are welded directly to one another.  The longitudinal and depth braces are in the form of angled profiles.  The depth brace is butt-jointed with its flat end face on to an arm of the longitudinal brace and welded at that point.<br>
The vertical frame member, formed as an angled profile and likewise made up of two arms, can also be connected to the pedestal thus formed.  For this purpose one of the arms is provided with notches at the end face.  Thus there remains from the second arm on the end face a tab, which the longitudinal brace of the pedestal contacts with its end face.<br><br>
In this type of corner connection it is difficult to align the vertical frame member on the pedestal in such a way that on the one hand it can be simply and precisely welded in place and on the other hand is exactly positioned.  For this reason it is proposed in WO 90/15464 to use an additional member.  This is secured to the depth brace so that the longitudinal braces of the vertical frame member can be brought into position.  In this corner connection again an additional part is necessary, which causes a correspondingly higher outlay.<br>
It is the object of the invention to provide a switchgear cabinet of the type already mentioned in which the corner connection is simply constructed on the rack and exact alignment of the vertical frame member is enabled.<br>
This object of the invention is achieved in that the vertical frame members have centering surfaces which are aligned to stops on the longitudinal and depth braces. The vertical frame member can be brought into position on the centering surfaces along the stops.  The centering surfaces form together with the stops an automatic guidance for the vertical frame member, which maintains the position of the parts to be connected during the welding procedure.  By means of this simple measure, in addition, additional corner connector members for<br><br>
aligning the vertical frame member can be omitted, so that the rack is simply constructed.<br>
According to a development of the invention the centering surfaces of the vertical frame member are aligned vertically to the respectively associated side surfaces of the rack, and the stops are web-shaped in form, are at an angle of 90° to one another and form an open receiving means.<br>
The vertical frame member can be inserted from the outside into the pedestal into the receiving means.  The web-like stops in this case abut on the centering surfaces.<br>
If webs are located spaced apart from the stops in a vertical direction on the longitudinal and depth.braces, the vertical frame member being supported on said webs on its end face abutting surface, and if the vertical frame member is welded on the abutting surface and on the centering surfaces with the longitudinal and depth braces, then a stable connection of the vertical frame member is possible.<br>
Because the abutting surface is located at a spacing from the stops, high torque loads can be introduced into the vertical frame member.<br><br>
A switchgear cabinet according to the invention is characterised in that the vertical frame member is profiled on its side facing outwards in the corner area, and in that the webs have a notch adapted to this profiling.<br>
The most varied built-in components can be secured in the profiling of the frame member.  For example, hinge members or closures for a door can be attached, or angled portions of connected side walls can be accommodated.  By means of the adapted notches in the longitudinal or depth braces, disruptive material residues which would represent a risk of injury are avoided.  Furthermore, the vertical frame member can be so pre-positioned on the adapted notch, that it is precisely aligned.<br>
According to a preferred development of the invention, side portions of the vertical frame member are connected to the centering surfaces, and the side portions merge into the contact web to form a closed sealing and/or contact frame for a side wall, switchgear cabinet door or the like.<br>
Because the centering surfaces are aligned on the stops, the side portion is also adapted to the contact web.  A<br><br>
built-in component can then be secured in a sealed manner with the closed seal and/or contact frame.<br>
Therefore, the present invention relates to a Switchgear<br>
abinet with a rack, havingaligined centering surfaces comprising<br>
 a pedestal made up of longitudinal<br>
and depth braces and a vertical frame member welded thereto, the longitudinal and depth braces forming at their ends a receiving means into which the vertical frame member is inserted and is welded to the pedestal to form a corner connection, characterised in that the vertical frame members have centering surfaces, aligned on stops of the longitudinal and depth braces.<br>
A simply constructed switchgear cabinet is characterised in that there is located, at the end of the vertical frame members facing away from the pedestal, a top frame which corresponds in its design to the pedestal.  The invention will be explained in more detail in the following with reference to an embodiment given by way of example and shown in the drawing, which shows:<br>
Figure 1: a partial perspective exploded view showing the corner area of a rack,<br>
Figure 2: the view according to Figure 1 in the assembled condition.<br>
Figure 1 shows a pedestal 20 made up of longitudinal and depth braces 30 and 40.  The longitudinal and depth braces have the same cross-sectional geometry.  The entire pedestal 20 is constructed from two longitudinal and two depth braces 30 and 40, which are respectively aligned parallel to one another.  In order to produce the pedestal 20 one single stamped and bent part is used, so that the individual longitudinal and depth braces 30 and 40 are integrally connected together.  The longitudinal and depth braces 30 and 40 have a horizontal top portion<br>
37, 47, which connects to a contact web 31, 41 bent downwards through 90°.<br>
The contact web 31, 41 serves to contact for example a side wall or a cabinet door.  A seal member may be inserted between the side wall member or the cabinet door and the contact web 31, 41 in order to provide a seal.  A horizontal web 32, 42 is bent back at right angles from the contact web 31, 41.  This web 32, 42 merges into the downwardly-directed wall 33, 43.  A folded portion of the wall member or of the cabinet door can be accommodated in the free space formed for the web 32, 42 and the wall 33, 43.<br>
The wall 33, 43 is terminated by a base portion 34, 44. Here the pedestal 20 can be set on to the base.  The longitudinal or depth braces 30, 40 are provided on their webs 32, 42 with notches 35, 45 at the end faces.  The notches 35, 45 are adapted to the external geometry of a vertical frame member 10.  Spaced apart vertically from the web 32, 42 at the end of the top parts 37, 47 there are attached stops 36, 46 for centering surfaces 12.5 of the vertical frame member 10.<br>
The vertical frame member 10 has a connecting web 11, from which hollow chambers extend to both sides.  In order to form the hollow chambers, the sheet metal blank<br>
for the vertical frame member 10 is folded a number of times.  Specifically, there connects with the connecting web 11 a folded portion 12.1, which merges via a transitional piece 12.2 into an angled portion 12.3.  The angled portion 12.3 is located vertically to the associated side walls of the rack.  Connecting at right angles to the angled portions 12.3 are side portions 12.4.  The side portions 12.4 serve as a support surface for the cabinet door or the side wall.  In order to form the centering surfaces 12.5, the side portions 12.4 are bent at right angles in the direction of the interior of the rack.  The centering surfaces 12.5 merge at right angles into attachment sections 12.6.  The attachment sections 12.6 thus stand parallel to the associated side walls of the rack.  The attachment sections abut via bent-over end pieces on the connecting web 11, where they are also secured.<br>
The vertical frame member 10 is pushed into the outwardly open receiving means of the pedestal 20.  Thus the centering surfaces 12.5 slide along the stops 36, 46. With its abutting surface 12.8, the frame member 10 abuts at the end on the webs 32, 42 of the pedestal 20.  In this position the vertical frame member 10 is aligned on its centering surfaces 12.5.  Thus also the attachment sections 12.6 are positioned towards the interior of the rack.<br>
The exact vertical alignment of the frame member 10 is possible by means of the notch 35, 45.  As this is adapted to the external geometry of the vertical frame member 10, it can be applied here flush.<br>
This assembly situation is shown in more detail in Figure 2.  For final attachment, the vertical frame member 10 is welded to the pedestal 20.  The weld seam 50 thus formed extends along the stops 36, 46 over the contact web 31, 41 to the notches 35, 45.<br>
As Figure 2 shows, a respective surrounding seal and/or contact frame is formed with the side portions 12.4 and the contact webs 31, 41.<br><br><br><br>
