Method for accessing information on article with a tag attached thereon, local server, ONS proxy, program, tag creation method, apparatus including a tag writer, tag and program for controlling an apparatus including a tag writer<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to information processing technology, and more particularly to a method for accessing information on article with a tag attached thereon, a local server, an ONS proxy, a program, a tag creation method, a tag writer, a tag and a program for controlling an apparatus including a tag writer.<br>
Background art<br>
In order to promote the efficiency of article circulation and the spread of article quality control by use of RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) tag, EPCglobal, a standardization group, has established the specifications (shown in Figure 17) of EPC code that includes version information (VER) indicating tag data bit assigmnent, manufacturer ID (MID), product ID (PID) and product serial number (SNO) (refer to non-patent document 1).<br>
Also, the standardization group, EPCglobal has proposed a framework (shown in Figure 16) for accessing information on article with an RFID tag in which an EPC code is stored attached thereon. According to the framework, a local server 103 acquires an EPC code serving as article ID from data that is stored in an RFID tag 101 received via a tag reader 102. Subsequently, by use of the EPC code, the local server 103 requests the network address of a PML server 107 recording information on article with an RFID tag attached thereon via a network 104 from an ONS server 105. Then, by use of the EPC code and the network address of the PML server 107 acquired from the ONS server 105, the local server 103 accesses the information<br><br>
on article with the tag attached thereon, which is stored in the PML server 107.<br>
Data recorded onto an RFID tag can generally be read with an RFID tag reader of any type. Consequently, an EPC code recorded onto an RFID tag attached to an article worn by an individual may be read with a tag reader installed in a public space. Concerned about the privacy problem that an article worn by an individual may be grasped by anyone else, consumer groups have staged boycott movements against articles with an RFID tag, interfering with promotion of the efficiency of article circulation and the spread of article quality control by use of RFID tag.<br>
As a method for coping with the privacy problem regarding RFID tag, there has been proposed Kill-Command for halting the function of RFID tag at the time when the article is bought by a consumer (refer to non-patent document 2 ) . As another method, there has been proposed a function such that a blocker tag, which interferes with tag readers, blocks other tag data from being read (refer to non-patent document 3) . As still another method for coping with the privacy problem, there has been proposed a method in which whenever data recorded onto an RFID tag is read, the data contents are rewritten with an external tag writer or by the tag itself (refer to non-patent documents 4 and 5).<br>

Also, the server 300 can employ OS Open provided by International Business Machines Corp., a real time OS such as Vx Works of Wind River Systems, Inc. or an operating system incorporated into a network computer such as Java (R) OS.<br><br>
it can be understood from the above description that the computer apparatus is not limited to a particular operating system environment Of course, the local server 103, ONS server 105, ONS proxy 106 or PML server 107 can be operated under a different operating system environment from each other.<br>
The network 104 is a communication path that connects the local server 103, ONS server 105, ONS proxy 106 and PML server 107; it can be implemented by the Internet, for example. As is commonly known, the network 104 being the Internet performs connection between systems by use of TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol) . In the network 104, mutually communicating systems are specified by use of IP address represented by global address or local address.<br>
(Functional block configuration)<br>
Figure 6 is a functional block diagram of a network system according to the first embodiment of the invention . According to the embodiment of the invention, the local server 103 includes a tag reader/writer controller 1031, an ONS resolver 1032 and a PML requester 1033 . The local server 103 is connected to the tag reader 102 capable of reading data recorded on the RFID tag 101. In order to acquire a virtual ID to be described later, the tag reader/writer controller 1031 acquires data recorded on the RFID tag by controlling the tag reader/writer 102.<br>
In order to acquire the network address (IP address in this embodiment) of the PML server 107, the ONS resolver 1032 sends a network address request including the virtual ID  (VID)  acquired by the tag reader/writer controller 1031 to the network and obtains the network address of the PML server 107.<br>
The PML requester 1033 accesses, by use of the network address of the PML server 107 which is obtained by the ONS resolver 1032 and<br><br>
the virtual ID, information (hereinafter referred to as PML information) on an article having an RFID tag attached thereon and being associated with the RFID tag, which information is recorded on the PML server 107.<br>
On the ONS proxy 106, there is securely recorded a common key (K) 1061. In response to the request including the virtual ID from the ONS resolver 1032 of the local server 103, the ONS proxy 106 decrypts the virtual ID by use of the common key 1061 to acquire an article ID. Then, in order to generate a network address request to request rhe network address of the PML server which provides access to the information on article associated with the article ID, the ONS proxy<br>
106	extracts a manufacturer ID (MID) from the article ID.  The ONS<br>
proxy sends the network address request in which the extracted MID<br>
is included to the ONS server 105.<br>
The ONS server 105 is constructed according to the specifications based on DNS server established by the standardization group, EPCGlobal. On the ONS server 105, there is recorded data to associate each manufacturer ID (MID) with the network address of a PML server<br>
107	managed by a manufacturer indicated by the manufacturer ID.<br>
According to the first embodiment, in response to the network address<br>
request including the MID, the ONS server 105 returns the network<br>
address of the PML server 107 that provides access to the information<br>
on article associated with the article ID.<br>
The PML server 107 includes a PML manager 1071 and a PML database 1072 that records PML information corresponding to each article ID. Also, on the PML server 107, there is securely recorded a common key (K) 1073. According to the embodiment, in response to the PML information request from the local server 103, the PML manager 1071 decrypts the virtual ID included in the PML information request by use of the common key (K) 1073 to acquire the article ID. Then, the PML manager 1071 identifies PML information corresponding to the article ID from the PML database 1072 and provides it for the local server 103.<br><br>
(Generation of tag data including virtual ID)<br>
Figure 7 is a first exemplary data structure of data recorded on an RFID tag 101 according to the first embodiment of the invention. According to the specifications established by the standardization group, EPCGlobal, by use of version number (VER) 701 of 8 bits, the data contents assigned to the remaining 8 8 bits can be defined. In the first example, in the remaining 88 bits, there is stored one virtual ID (VID) 7 02 generated based on article ID; in version number 701, there is stored a bit string indicating employment of such data structure.<br>
Figure 8 is a second exemplary data structure of data recorded on an RFID tag 101 according to the first embodiment of the invention. In the second example, in the remaining 88 bits, there are scored the first virtual ID (VID-1) 802of52bits generated f rommanuf acturer ID (MID) and product ID (FID) each included in article ID and the second virtual ID (VID-2) 803 of 36 bits generated from serial number (SNO) included in article ID; in version number (VER) 8 01, there is stored a bit string indicating employment of such data structure.<br>
According to the embodiment, virtual ID is generated by applying an appropriate encryption process to article ID. A.rticle ID can be calculated by applying an appropriate decryption process to virtual ID. Also, according to the embodiment of the invention, for the purpose of protecting privacy, virtual ID preferably fulfills a condition, i.e. Indistiguishable, in which even when mapping with respect to a pair of a given article ID and virtual ID is known, mapping with respect to another virtual ID can not be known. If the above described Indistiguishable is fulfilled, for example, even when the user makes public the retrieval result of a virtual ID, the user can know only the mapping of the above virtual ID and article ID and can not know any mapping with respect to another virtual ID. According to the first embodiment, to meet the above described requirement, a bit string of a virtual ID is generated according<br><br>
ro the following method.<br>
Figure 10 is a flowchart showing an exemplary flow of a method for generating a virtual ID according to the first embodiment of the invention.<br>
The process starts with step 1001, and an article ID is acquired (step!002) . Here, if a correspondence between article ID and virtual ID is one - one, Indistiguishable can not be fulfilled. Thus, in order to associate one article ID with plural virtual IDs, the number of bits of article ID is smaller that that of virtual ID, as shown in Figure 9. According to the embodiment, in order to associate one article ID with virtual IDs on the order of 220, when a virtual ID of 88 bits is generated, an article ID of 68 bits consisting of MID 901 of 24 bits, PID 902 of 20 bits and SNO 903 of 24 bits is employed. Subsequently, a random number R of 20 bits is generated (step 1003; and then digits of the random number R is distributed within the article ID (step 1004) according to an "All-cr-Nothing Transformation (AONT} " algorism, and then the article ID is encrypted with the key K in a manner that decryption with the common key scored in the ONS proxy and PML server is possible (step 1005).<br>
The above process is expressed by the following formula, where known block cipher OFBmode such as DES canbe employed as encryption function E, and K is a key of DES, and IV is the initial vector.<br>
VID = EK, -v (AONT (MIDI |PID| I SNO, ,R) )<br>
In AONT algorism, the random number effect of the random number R is distributed over the entire cipher text, whereby when any single bit of the cipher text is lost, the cipher text can not be decrypted into a clear text. For example, OAEP known as cipher padding of RSA is one of the methods for implementing AONT. According to the embodiment, as AONT function used in step 1004, there is employed OAEP to be described below in detail.<br><br>
Figure 11 is a flowchart showing OAEP algorism used to generate a virtual ID according to the first embodiment of the invention.<br>
The process starts with step 1101. First the random number R generated in step 1003 is hashed by a hash function F () that outputs a hash value of 68 bits to obtain F(R) (step 1102), and then there is generated X being an exclusive OR between the article ID of 63 bits and the F (R) (step 1103 ) . Further, X is hashed by a hash function G () that outputs a hash value of 20 bits to generate G (X) (step 1104) , and then there is generated Y being an exclusive OR between the random number R of 20 bits and G (X) (step 1105) . Finally, X and Y are joined (step 1106). By executing the above steps, there is generated a bit string Z with a length of 83 bits to be encrypted in step 1005, thereby finishing the process (step 1107) . The above described process is expressed by the following formulas.<br>
X - XOR (MIDI|PID! iSNO, F (R) Y = XOR (R, G (X)) Z = X | I Y<br>
Taking into consideration the first exemplary data structure of data recorded on RFID tag, the method for generating a virtual ID was described above. However, it will be easily understood by those skilled in the art that also in the second example, by use of a similar method, VID-1 is generated by applying a random number of 8 bits to one part (44 bits) of the article ID consisting of MID (24 bits) and PID (20 bits) , and VXD-2 is generated by applying a random number of 12 bits to SNO part (24 bits) of the article ID.<br>
By executing the above described steps, a virtual ID of 88 bits is obtained, and the process for the first example is finished (step 1006) . The virtual ID generated by the above described method is written into the RFID tag 101 together with the version number by use of the tag writer 102.<br>
(Method for accessing information on article with a taa attached<br><br>
thereon)<br>
Figure 12 is a flowchart showing an exemplary flow of a method for accessing PML information according to the first embodiment of the invention. .<br>
The process starts with step 1201, and the tag reader 102 reads tag data from the RFID tag 101. The read tag data is given to the local server 103 (step 1202). The local server 103 generates a request having "VID. VER. onsroot. org" including virtual ID (VID) and version number (VER) as target URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and sends it to the ONS server 105 (step 1203).<br>
When receiving the request sent from the local server 103 in step 1203, the ONS server returns, in response that version information (VER) indicating that virtual ID is included in the tag is included in the request, the IP address of the ONS proxy 10 6 to the local server 103. Then, by use of the IP address of the ONS proxy 106, the local server 103 returns an ONS service request including VID to the ONS proxy (step 1204).<br>
When receiving the ONS service request, the ONS proxy 105 decrypts the VID included in the request by use of the common key 1061 which the ONS proxy 105 holds to obtain an article ID (step 1205) , and then extracts manufacturer ID (MID) included in the article ID to return a request having "MID. onsroot. org" including the MID as target URL to the ONS server 106 (step 1206) . The ONS server 105 identifies the IP address of the PML server from the MID included in the request and returns it to the local server 103 (step 1207) .<br>
By use of the IP address of the PML server 107, the local server 103 sends a PML service request including VID to the PML server 107 (step 1208) . Byuseof the common key 1073, the PML server 107 decrypts the VID included in the received PML service request to obtain an article ID. By use of the article ID, the PML server 107 identifies PML information to be provided and provides it for the local server<br><br>
103 (step 1209), thereby finishing the process (step 1210). According to the embodiment, by executing the above described steps, the local server 103 can access the PML information stored in the PML database of the PML server 107.<br>
{Embodiment 2)<br>
Figure 13 is a high-level schematic diagram showing a network system according to a second embodiment of the invention. According to the second embodiment of the invention, the network system 100 includes local servers 103a to 103c, an ONS server 105, an ONS proxy 106 and a PML servers 107a to 107c, which are communicatable with each other via a network 104.<br>
It should be noted that according to the second embodiment of the invention, the network system includes a-plurality cf local servers each with a tag reader/writer connected thereto and a plurality of PML servers. In explaining the second embodiment of the invention, tag reader/writers 102a to 102c, local servers 103a to 103c and PML servers 107a to 107c are often generically referred to as tag reader/writer 102, local server 103 and PML server 107 , respectively.<br>
(Hardware configuration)<br>
According to the second embodiment of the invention, RF1D tag 101, tag reader/writer 102, local server 103, network 104, CNS server 105, ONS proxy 106 and PML server 107 can be realized with hardware similar to that of the first embodiment. Thus, regarding the second embodiment, the description of hardware configuration of each component is omitted.<br>
(Functional block configuration)<br>
Figure 14 is a functional block diagram of a network system according to the second embodiment of the invention. According to the second embodiment of the invention, similarly to the first embodiment, the<br><br>
local server 103 includes a tag reader/writer controller 1031, an ONS resolver 1032 and a PML requester 1033. Also, according to the second embodiment, the local server 103 includes an authentication mechanism 1034. The authentication mechanism 1034 performs authentication with the ONS proxy 10 6 and stores a credential obtained as a result of authentication. The credential stored in the authentication mechanism 1034 is used by the PML server 107 determining, in response that a PML information request is received from PML requester 1033, whether or not access to recorded PML information is permissible.<br>
According to the second embodiment, a different security level is given to each of the local servers 103a to l03c (or tag readers /writers 102a to 102c) . Specifically, assume that: with the connected tag reader/writer 102a installed in a public space, the local server 103a" is a non-secure one with no credential given thereto';'with the connected tag reader/writer 102b installed in an ordinary retail shop, the local server 103b is a low-level secure one with a low-level credential given thereto; and with the connected tag reader/writer 102 c managed by the manufacturer of article with a tag attached thereon, the local server 103c is a high-level secure one with a high-level credential given thereto.<br>
Similarly to the first embodiment, on the ONS proxy 106, there is securely recorded a common key (K) 1061. According to the second embodiment, the ONS proxy 10 6 further includes an authentication mechanism 10 62, and supplies a credential in accordance with authentication level to the local server 103 in response that authentication is properly performed with the authentication mechanism 1033 of the local server 103. The ONS proxy 106 according to the second embodiment has a function of requesting the network address of a different PML server 107 from the ONS server 105 based on a result of authentication performed with the local server 103.<br>
The ONS server 105, which can be realized by a configuration similar to that of the first embodiment, has a function of sending back the<br><br>
network address of a PML server 107 in response to a request.<br>
According to the first embodiment, the PML server 107 includes a PML manager 1071, a PML database 1072 and a securely recorded common key (K) 1073. According to the second embodiment, the PML server 107 further includes an authentication mechanism 107 4. The authentication mechanism 1074 has a function of determining, according to a credential that a local server 103 requesting PML information holds, whether or not access to PML information recorded on the PML database 1072 is permissible.<br>
Figure 15 is a flowchart showing an exemplary flow of a method for accessing PML information according to the second embodiment.<br>
The process starts with step 1501. The tag reader 102 reads tag data including at least one virtual "ID* (VID) from the RFID tag 101." VID can be generated by a method similar to one which was described regarding the first embodiment.<br>
The read rag data is given to the local server 103 (step 1502) . The local server 103 generates a request having VVVID. VER. onsroot. org" including virtual ID (VID) and version number (VER) as target URL (Uniform Resource Locator) and sends it to the ONS server 105 (step 1503).<br>
When receiving the request sent from the local server 103 in siep 1503, the ONS server 105 returns the IP address of the DNS proxy 106 to the local server 103 based on the request. Then, by use of the IP address of the ONS proxy 106, the local server 103 sends an ONS service request including VID to the ONS proxy 106 (step 1504) .<br>
The above described steps are similar to those in the first embodiment. Subsequently, according to the second embodiment, the ONS proxy 106 performs authentication with the local server 103 which sent the ONS service request (step 1505). If authentication fails in step 1505, then the flow proceeds from step 1506 through arrow No to step<br><br>
1508 without issuing any credential.  in the second embodiment, assume that the authentication between the non-secure local server 103a and ONS proxy 105 fails, thus issuing no credential.<br>
If the authentication is properly performed in step 1505, then the flow proceeds from step 1506 to arrow Yes, and authentication level is determined. Those skilled in the art can appropriately design and implement a method for determining authentication level. For example, authentication level can be determined by the IP address of local server, the ID of tag reader/writer or the like, which are preliminarily registered. Then, a credential corresponding to the determined authentication level is issued to the local server 103 (step 1507) .<br>
In the second embodiment, assume that: low-level authentication is properly performed" with respect'- to the local server 103b with low-security level given thereto, whereby a low-level credential is issued; high-level authentication is properly performed with respect to the local server 103c with high-security level given thereto, whereby a high-level credential is issued.<br>
Subsequently, the ONS proxy 106 decrypts VID included in the request by use of common key (K) 1061 to obtain an article ID (step 1508), and extracts manufacturer ID (MID) included in the article ID to send a request having "MID. onsroot. org" including the MID as target URL to the ONS server 106 (step 1509). According to the second embodiment, the ONS proxy 105 generates a different target URL based on a result of authentication of step 1506.<br>
Specifically, the ONS proxy 105 generates "MID. non_secure. onsroot. org" with respect to the local server 103a for which authentication has failed, and generates "MID. low_secure. onsroot. org" with respect to the local server 103b for which low-level authentication has been properly per formed, and generates "MID. high_secure . onsroct org" with respect to the local server 10 3b for which high-level authentication has been properly performed.<br><br>
When receiving the request, the ONS server 105 identifies the IP address of an appropriate PML server 107 from the MID and security-level included in the request and returns it to the local server 103 (step 1510) . It should be noted that the returned IP address can change according to the contents of target URL.<br>
Specifically, according to the second embodiment, the ONS server 105 returns the I, address of PML server 107a to the local server 103a, and returns the IP address of PML server 107b to the local server 103b, and returns the IP address of PML server 107c to the local server 103c.<br>
Ey use of the acquired IP address of PML server 107, the local server 103 sends a PML service request including VID to the PML server 107 (step 1513) . When receiving the PML service request, the PML server 107 firstly determines whether or not the server itself is a secure site (step 1512) .<br>
If it is determined in step 1512 that the PML server 107 is not a secure site, then the flow proceeds through arrow No to step 1514 because the PML information stored in the above PML server 107 is accessible by anyone. If it is determined in step 1512 that the PML server 107 is a secure site, then the PML server 107 certifies, by use of authentication mechanism 1074 whether or not the local server 103 which has sent the PML service request holds an appropriate credential (step 1513).<br>
If the authentication mechanism 1073 of PML server 107 determines in step 1513 that the local server 103 holds an appropriate credential, the flow proceeds through arrow Yes to step 1514. In step 1514, the PML server 107 decrypts VID included in the PML service request by use of the common key (K) 1073 to obtain an article ID. Sy use of the article ID, the PML server 107 identifies PML information to be provided, and then provides it for the local server 103, thereby finishing the process (step 1516) .<br><br><br><br>
If the authentication mechanism 1073 of PML server 107 determines in step 1513 that the local server 103 does not holds an appropriate credential, then the flow proceeds through arrow No to step 1515, and the PML server 107 rejects access to PML information by the local server 103 (step 1515) , thereby finishing the process (step 1516) .<br>
The previous description is of preferred examples for implementing the invention, and the technical scope of the invention should not be restrictively interpreted by the description of the embodiment but be defined by the claims . Those skilled in the art will recognize that many changes or modifications to the embodiments described above are possible . For example, while the above embodiments are described under an assumption that encryption and decryption of virtual ID are performed with a secret key cryptography using a common key, encryption and decryption of virtual ID may of course be performed with a public key cryptography using a pair of secret key and-public key. Further, for example, while ONS proxy and ONS server is constructed as separate hardware in the above described embodiments, the functions of ONS proxy and ONS server may be implemented by the same hardware. Specifically, those skilled in the art can easily and properly design the hardware arrangement and implementation of servers, functional blocks, program modules and the like each described above in the embodiments. It will be apparent from the description of the claims that an embodiment with such changes or modifications applied thereto can also be included in the technical scope of the invention.<br><br><br>
