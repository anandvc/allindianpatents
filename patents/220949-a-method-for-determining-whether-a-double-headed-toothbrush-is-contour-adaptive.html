TWIN HEAPED TOOTHBRUSH<br>
Tliis is a continuation-in-part of Serial No. 09/596,081, filed June 16,2000.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
Tliis invention relates to toothbrushes. More particularly, this invention relates to contour adaptive toothbrushes.<br>
A:; disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,121,520 and 5,499,421 issued to the present inventor, Miciiael 1 trice, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference, to effectively clean teeth and gum areas complex maneuvering of a toothbrush is necessary. It is generally acknowledged that the great majority of individuals brush their teeth and gum surfaces primarily in a horizontal and semi-circular manner, even though this particular technique is not deemed to be the be ;t way of cleaning the teeth and gum surfaces. There are two reasons why most individuals resort to this ineffective technique. First, conventional brushing heads are not paniculaily designed to follow the contours of the teeth and gum surfaces, and as an extension of the human arm do not permit complicated and exact maneuvers to be performed. Second, most brushing takes place in the early morning when one first arises and in the evening just prior to retiring. This is a factor, as demanding complicated procedures for this time of day and night are beyond the tolerance of most individuals. For these reasons, most individuals resort to a simple natural horizontal or semi-circular conventional brushing technique.<br>
Numerous attempts have been made in the past as shown, for example, in U.S. Pat. Nos. 860,840 LO Strassburger, 3,742,549 to Scopp et al., and 4,67;360 to Marthaler et al. to improve the design of the toothbrush such as the bristles and/or the head. U.S. Fat, No. 860,840 to StrassbuÂ»ger discloses a toothbrush having two rows of bristles sloped in opposite directions<br><br>
relative to each other, and a central section of bristles arranged parallel to and located between the two outside rows. However, these prior toothbrushes do not simultaneously and/or independently accommodate different contours of the teeth.<br>
In other patents, adjacent head portions of a toothbrush are made to pivot or flex relative to the han.tle portion so that the bristles are better able to conform to the contours of the teeth and gum surfaces. Such an arrangement is shown in U.S. Pat. Nos. 928,32S to Carpentier, 2,266,195 to Hallock, 3,152,349 to Brennesholtz, 4,333,199 to Del Rosario, 4,488,328 to (iyman, 4.691,405 to Reed, and 4,776,054 to Rauch. More particularly, U.S. Pat Nos. 4,333,199 to Del Ro: ario and 4,488,328 to Hyman disclose a toothbrush having a single discreet brushing head that. an be pivoted about the handle. The Del Rosario patent, in addition, discloses a orushing head that can rotate about three planes.<br>
-   U.S. Pat Nos. 1,928,328 to Carpentier, 2,266,195 to Hallock, 3,152,349 to Brennesholt2 and 4,691 405 to Reed show a toothbrush head capable of flexing or articulating relative to the aandle. Specifically, the brushing head comprises a plurality of serially arranged flexing head segments, wherein the segments flex in union or relative to each other.<br>
Finally, U.S. Pat. No. 4,776,054 to Rauch discloses a toothbrush head having three arranged 1-rushing segments, whereby the central segment is aligned with the handle and the two segments on either side are symmetrically arranged relative to the central segment. The bristles an the outer sides of the Rauch patent have narrow, blade-like, contact points which are likely to induce excessive pressure to the gum due to the narrow contact points. In other words, the narrow Wide-like bristles inherently place higher excessive concentrated pressure on the gum nore so than bristles with a larger contact area.<br>
None of these toothbrushes are directed to overcoming ineffective brushing techniques,<br><br>
&gt;r the individual's anatomically limited abilities to effectively clean the curvilinear surfaces of he teeth and provide for gentle stimulation of the varying gum tissues without harm or iiscomfort for the user, for example, by utilizing side-by-side arranged brushing heads.<br>
In addition, none of these toothbrushes provide for the discreet functioning of one or nore brushing heads as separate elements by addressing the force exerted by the user hereinaftei "the X Value"), the resistance/resiliency characteristics of the molecular density of he material used in conjunction with the structural dimensions of the toothbrush (hereinafter 'the Y Value"), in concert with the resistance/resiliency of the bristle body as separate functioning elements of the uniform bristle body mass (hereinafter "the Z Value"), as well as the ateral resistance characteristics of the one or more necks (hereinafter "the L Value").<br>
Moreover, none of these toothbrushes enables the vanring of the brushing pressure, in lccordanct with the proclivity of the user, in order to prevent excessive pressure from being ipplied to i he gums and/or gingival tissue or from injury to the tooth enamel.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Presently, it is only generally known that a neck or a head of a toothbrush can be<br>
"resilient. ' To achieve full contour-adaptivity of a toothbrush, however, specific forces, resistance:, and resiliencies of the toothbrush have to be addressed and understood. As a result, full "functioning" of a toothbrush has not been possible as the dynamic-interaction between a user and the toothbrush, as well as the forces, resistances and resiliencies of the toothbrush, have not been addressed, appreciated and/or understood.<br>
One embodiment of a toothbrush includes one or more necks and/or uniform bristle body mass oÂ£fei ing resistance and then providing resiliency as to brushing forces as may be applied to achieve full contour-adaptivity of (he toothbrush. One can appreciate the toothbrush from the standpoim of a machine having moving parts wherein the force and/or energy of the user is harnessed (the power source) and the moving parts of the toothbrush are dependent upon the understanding of degree of force over a range of user variants and what is required to resist such force and at what point or value of such force in which such resistances incorporated into the toothbrush become resilient. Full functioning of the toothbrush is not possible without this knowledge and the lack of such knowledge prevents any toothbrush from realizing dynamic<br><br>
contour ad aptivity that provides workability and full functionality for the user in the application and use oi the toothbrush. Therefore, merely stating that a toothbrush is resilient does not provide any degree of knowledge as to what is required on the part of the toothbrush to function.<br>
Th*s embodiment of toothbrush may provide resistance to the brushing force by the flexible neck portions to the degree that such one or more necks resist such force and then become resilient to such force based upon the resistance/ resiliency characteristics of the neck structures meeting obstructions. The separate and combined neck structures also provide contour-ad aptivity by being directly related to the resistance and resiliency characteristics of the one or moj e bristle body heads. The resistance/resiliency of the bristle body heads is related to the neck structures, and may correspond to the force( s)*exerted by the user. The bristle body heads may be configured to provide resistance to the changing curvilinear structures encountered during brushing.<br>
Th
 <br>
concert wiih the one or more discreet and combined bristle body mass offering resistance and resiliency 
The toothbrush may include: a handle to be grasped by a human hand; a first neck extending irom the handle; a second neck extending from the handle parallel to the first neck; a first bristle support attached to the first neck; a second bristle support attached to the second neck; a plurality of first bristles extending from the first bristle support; and/or a plurality of second bristles extending from the second bristle support. The plurality of first and second bristles may be formed of a stiffness. The first and second necks may be formed of a predetermined resiliency, flexibility and bending resistance. The value of the stiffness relative to the predetermined resiliency, flexibility and bending resistance may be set in accordance with a predetermined brushing force to be applied by the bristles to achieve the full functioning of the one or moje articulating heads in making and maintaining contact with the dento-gingival<br>
lunction.<br>
TV embodiments described herein have been included for purposes of illustrating the principals Â«&gt;f the present invention. Accordingly, the present invention is not limited to the :onfigurations and constructions as illustrated and/or set forth herein.<br>
Also, throughout the illustrations of different embodiments, the same or equivalent elements have been identified with the same reference numerals.<br>
Figs. 1-3 show one embodiment of the left (L) and right (R) handles of a dual headed .oothbmsh 10, Conventional molding equipment may be used to form the integral right handle R) and integral left handle (L). The right and left handles may include handles 12L and 12R, leek portions 13L and 13R and/or the brushing heads 14L and 14R. The right and left handles nay be m
 <br>
held flat to drill holes for the brushes and plug bristles 15 into the holes (see Fig, 3). The bristles have a stifihess, which can range from soft to hard to vary the resiliency and resistance presented by the brisiles to the teeth and gums during brushing. The bristles may be cut to any desired length, shape and/or profile, and polished in accordance with commercially known techniques.<br>
Thr left and right handles may be brought together and welded along the handles 12L and 12R by conventional bonding and welding techniques. For example, the Branson Ultrasonic Corporation, manufactures and sells commercial vibrational and ultrasonic welding machines capable of welding various types of plastics.<br>
As discussed above, the toothbrush is configured to be dependent upon understanding and addressing the force exerted by the user in brushing his or her teeth ("the X Value"), meeting the resistance, resiliency characteristics of the molecular density of the material used in injunction with the structural dimensions of the neck elements ("the Y Value"), achieving iltemate functioning of the brushing heads in concert with the resistance/resiliency :haracterisiics of the discreet and combined uniform bristle body mass ("the Z Value") in naintamini; contact with the dento-gingival junction with the inside and adjacent rows of bristles )f each independently articulating brushing head. Addressing each of these factors (values), and he elemenis for carrying out each of these factors, provides for the proper functioning iharacterisi ics of the toothbrush.<br>
The toothbrush is dependent on characteristics of necks 13L and 13R7 and brush heads 14L and 14 R to achieve the proper functioning of the toothbrush. Moreover, the toothbrush can vork (funciion) with the use of a cushioned insert 16 in the handle (see Figs, 1A and IB). The anbodimeuts of Figs. 4 and 5 illustrate the toothbrush without the use of a cushioned insert 16.<br>
The inclusion of the cushioned insert, which can be made of a rubber having a stiffness<br><br>
which varies from soft to hard can increase the sensitivity for the user. The increase in sensitivity occurs as ;* result of the pressure transmitted by the user through the thumb being totally or partially absorbed by said insert. The insert can be of any shape or design which fits into a similarly suaped cavity provided in the left and right handles. The insert 16 is shown to have an oval top. Moreover, the oval shaped inset 16 is provided with a rectangular base 16B. The rectangulai base 16B slides into a rectangular cavity 16C formed during the molding operation of the left and right handles. A suitable adhesive may be used to hold the rectangular base 16A of insert 16 in cavity 16C of the handles. Thereafter the bonding of the left and right handles may insure the permanent retention of insert 16 in the finished toothbrush. Also, the insert may be made of rubber and shaped to accommodate the thumb of the user. The resiliency characteristics of the rubber can be varied to accommodate the pressure exerted on the brush through the thumb of the user. Thus the stiffness of the-rubber insert can be varied from soft to hard to provide a range of cushioning characteristics.<br>
Fui [her, the polymers used to make the left and right handles can be selected to increase or decrease the flexibility, resiliency and resistance of the necks 13L and 13R of the left and right handles. Similarly, the stiffness of the bristles 15 of the brushing heads 14L and 14R can be selected to range from soft to hard to vary the resiliency and resistance presented by bristle to the teeth and gam of the user.<br>
Thi- embodiments of the toothbrush provide for the adaptation of the toothbrush to the changing surfaces of the differing tooih/teeth/gingival structures of the user encountered during brushing by the one or more self-responding, self articulating brushing heads (see Fig. 10). Addressing and understanding the X, Y, Z and L values allow for the full, proper and safe functioning â  of the toothbrush.<br><br>
Thi- independent contour-adaptivity of the one or more brushing heads is dependent upon critical and exact understanding of the forces involved during brushing;<br>
â¢	X-Value - force of the user;<br>
â¢	Y-Value = resistance/resiliency of the one or more necks (resistance to force/load);<br>
â¢	Z-Value Â»the resistance/resiliency of the one or more bristle heads working in conjunction with the one or more necks; and/or<br>
â¢	L~\ aiue - Lateral resistance characteristics of the one or more necks combined. Method of Determining Forces, Resistances &amp; Resiliencies<br>
All laboratory testing utilized the Digital ForeÂ© &amp; Torque Gauge supplied by the Mark 10 Corporation of Hicksville, New York, The model use<jl for this testing is the series eg20 digital force gau which calibrated in pounds kilograms and millinewton. such compression determination was establishing necessary exact forces resistances resiliencies functioning requirements of toothbrush. fig. illustrates :he certificate calibration supplied by mark corporation model no. serial so dated october></jl>
All calibrations were completed using a fixture constraining each flexible/resistant element in a fixed position (see Figs. 7-9) wherein such forces were applied either (1) deflecting such bristK uniform masses to 50% of their natural fixed vertical orientation and (2) wherein such measurements were established deflecting necks to 3/Sths from their "natural" fixed molded positions.<br>
Calibration offerees (1): (Y Value) Initial resistance, then subsequent resiliency of the deck structures. The method employed here concerned having the handle portion of the toothbrush fixed in a holding fixture replicating the handle being grasped by a human hand and,<br><br>
allowing the necks (unsupported, as it would be in normal brushing) to deflect and/or flex to a degree of i/8ths of an inch off of rheir "natural" fixed and/or molded position upon such force that would yield their deflecting to this 3/8ths of an inch (see Fig. 7). Such deflecting (3/Sths of an inch) allows ihe toothbrush to achieve optimum contour-adaptivity of all surfaces encountered during brushing and, in particular, the achieving of contacting and removing plaque from the dento-gin^ival junction of all individuals using the toothbrush.<br>
Calibration of forces (2): (Z Value) Vertical deflecting to 50% of fixed (without any pressure b^ing applied) venical orientation of such bristle body mass and/or structure(s) wherein such pressure was applied to deflect such bristle body mass(es) to 50% off of vertical. This method provides the degree of resistance necessary to derive the degree of force required to produce such deflection. The bristle-body mass, upon 50% of deflection, provides the Z Value (see Fig. 81<br>
Calibration of forces.(3): (X Value) All calculations here utilized establishing the average force applied by the average user of toothbrushes, single-headed or otherwise. These calculations incorporated gauging what force was required to deflect such bristle stnicture/masses to 50% off their "natural" vertical orientation. Additionally, the same method as described in (1) above was used where each different handle was constrained in said fixture replicatint. the same holding orientation of the average user of a toothbrush allowing the necks and/or neck element of the toothbrush to deflect the sane 3/Sths of an inch off of their normal fixed posii ions to replicate the average movement range occurring during "normal" brushing.<br>
Calibration of forces (4): (L Value) Lateral resistance/resiliency of the individual and/or combined neck structures of the toothbrush. These calibrations were determined having the individual neck segments/structures fixed as described in (1) and (3) above wherein such force<br><br>
was applied allowing each segment to deflect laterally, again, 3/8th$ of an inch replicating the movement of the brush head(s) combined as the individual uses the 'upward and downward" movemenl during brushing (see Fig. 9). (This movement being distinct from the individual crushing into and out of the oral cavity in a fashion horizontal and parallel to the tooth/teeth/gum structures)  The 'upward and downward" movement of the average individual incorporates asing the toothbrush going from the top of the palatal structures of teeth and to the bottom of the lower jaw looth/teeth/gum structures in such "upward and downward" motion. Force, Resistance &amp; Resiliency Values<br>
Th*; average force exerted by the user on a toothbrush is from LOS to 2,35 kg of brushing force. Such pressure force exerted deflects the bristle body mass to 50% of vertical orientation. Thi; following values were derived from deflecting the neck structures (Y*Value) 3/Sths if an inch crom their fixed molded position. The heads and necks combined (Z-Value) were also deflected ?.-'$ths of an inch from their fixed positions. The lateral calculations (L-Value) also   -were deflected 3/Sths of an inch from their fixed positions.<br>
