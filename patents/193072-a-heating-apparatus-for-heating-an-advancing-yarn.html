BEATZHO  APPARATUS  FOA  HEATZNO  AH  ADVAKCXKO  XARH<br>
The  invention  relates  to  a  heating  apparatus  for heating  an  advancing  yarn  with  the  characteristics  as defined  in  the  preamble  of  claim  1.<br>
In  particular,   for  crimping  synthetic  filament yams  in  a  false  twist  crimping  machine,   it  is  common  to provide  heaters,  through  which  a  yam  is  guided.     The  yam advances  in  a  heatable  axial  groove,  the  target temperature  of  the  yarn  being  in  a  range  from  150"C  to 230Â°C.     The  heater  is  operated  at  a  temperature,   which  is substantially  higher  than  SOCC.    A  heater  may  have several  grooves  each  of  which  serves  to  guide  one  yam.<br>
Known  from  EP  o  412  429  Bl  is  a  heater,  which has  a  heatable  axial  groove,   through  which  the  yarn advances  along  a  zigzag  line.    The  zigzag  line  is  formed by  several  yarn  guides,  one  yarn  guide  being  arranged  at each  reversal  point  of  the  line.     The  yam  guides  are individual  ridges,  which  are  inserted  into  the  axial groove  parallel  to  and  equally  spaced  apart  from  one another.<br>
It  has  shown  that  in  operation  the  yarn  guides soil  after  a  certain  period  of  time  as  a  result  of anorganic  deposits.     To  avoid  that  the  deviation  of  the yarn  Guidance  from  a  desired  Value     cxceasiveiy large,   it  is  necessary  to  remove  and  clean  the  yarn guides.     In  the  known  heater,   each  yarn  guide  must  be removed  individually,  which  is  time  consuming.<br><br>
It  is  therefore  the  object  of  the  present invention  to  further  develop  the  known  heater  such  that the  number  of  yarn  guide  elements  is  minimized,   meds  the handling  necessary  for  changing  the  yarn  guides  is simplified.<br>
This  object  Is  accomplished  by  a  heating apparatus  having  the  characteristics  of  claim  1.<br>
The  heating  apparatus  of  the  present  invention is  characterized  in  that  the  yarn  guides  are  formed  as elevations  on  two  opposite  metal  strips.     Since  the elevations  are  arranged  alternatingly  on  the  one  and  on the  other  metal  strip,   and  since  the  elevations  project beyond  the  center  plane  of  the  groove,  the  yam  is  caused to  advance  along  a  zigzag  line.<br>
The  metal  strips  may  be  manufactured  by  hot  or cold  forming,  so  that  the  position  and  dimensions  of  the elevations  are  dependent  on  a  mold  or  tool,   and  that  they exhibit  a  very  high  accuracy  among  each  another.     As  a result,   the  looping  angles  and  the  frictional  conditions are  equal  at  each  deflection  point  of  the  yarn,  which favors  a  smooth  run  of  the  yarn.    The  metal  strips  are supported  on  opposite  side  walls  of  the  axial  groove  and positioned  relative  to  each  other  such  that  opposite  yearn guides  are  offset  from  one  another.<br>
For  cleaning  the  yarn  guides,   both  metal  strips may  be  simply  pulled  out  of  the  axial  groove  and, subsequently,   be  reinserted-     To  ensure  that  the  yarn assumes  a  uniformly  smooth  run  over  the  entire  heating length,   the  yarn  guides  are  to  be  arranged  in  accordance with  claim  2.<br>
The  configuration  of  the  heating  apparatus  in accordance  with  claim  3  is  especially  advantageous,  when the  yarn  is  to  be  heated  very  rapidly.       To  this  end,   the yam  guides  are  arranged  in  a  first  section  of  the  heating apparatus  at  a  slight  distance  from  each  other,   so  that<br><br>
the  air  jacket  carried  along  by  the  yarn  can  be  stripped vigorously.     In  the  further  course  of  the  heating  length, the  yam  guides  are  further  spaced  apart  from  each  other.<br>
The  arrangement  of  the  elevations  on  the  metal strips  may  also  be  such  that  two  successive  elevations  are formed  alternatingly  on  the  one  and  on  the  other  metal strip.     This  measure  allows  to  reduce  the  looping  angle  on each  yarn  guide  advantageously  by  50  percent.<br>
The  configuration  in  accordance  with  claim  5  is of  advantage  because  of  the  low  manufacturing  costs  of  the sheet  metal  strips.    The  corrugations  may  be  formed  by simple  bending  or  stamping  tools.<br>
For  purposes  of  positioning  opposite  yarn guides,   the  metal  strips  are  interconnected  by  means  of several  crosspieces.    Advantageously,  the  crosspieces  are arranged  in  the  vicinity  of  the  groove  bottom,   so  as  to avoid  that  the  yarn  comes  into  contact  with  the  heated surface  of  the  groove  bottom.<br>
The  embodiment  of  claim  7  is  advantageous  in that  opposite  yarn  guides  are  formed  on  a  shaped  metal sheet,   and  that  thereby  the  position  of  the yam  guides relative  to  one  another  is  defined  exclusively  by  the bending  or  stamping  tool.     Furthermore,  the  arrangement  of crosspieces  between  the  sides  may  be  omitted.<br>
The  embodiment  of  claim  8  is  a  cost-favorable alternative  for  obtaining  a  shaped  section  from  a  flat metal  strip.     The  incisions  parallel  to  the  fold  line permit  to  form  the  corrugations  down  to  the  groove  bottom in  the  folded  condition.     Furthermore,   it  is  avoided  that a  corrugation  extends  into  the  fold  line,  which  would strongly  interfere  with  a  subsequent  forming  process.<br>
The  ends  of  the  yarn  guides  on  the  yarn insertion  side  are  realized  in  accordance  with  claim  9, preferably  such  that  they  are  flattened  toward  the  center plane  of  the  groove.    This  results  in  a  V-shaped  or<br><br>
circular  inlet  in  the  axial  direction,  which  permits  a simple  threading  of  the  yarn.    If  the  yarn  guide  is  made in  the  form  of  a  corrugation,  same  proceeds  from  the  upper side  of  the  axial  groove  with  an  increasing  depth,  the profile  of  the  axial  groove  thereby  resulting  in  a  V-shaped  opening  toward  the  yam  insertion  side.<br>
The  embodiments  of  claims  10  and  11  relate  to  an advantageous  configuration  of  the  yam  guides  in  the  side walls,  which  allows  to  obtain  a  favorable  looping  angle and  a  small  surface  of  friction.     The  shaping  of  the  yarn guides  must  be  accurately  predefined,  since  it  has  a substemtial  influence  on  the  rimming  characteristics  of the  yarn.<br>
It  has  been  found  that  yarns  of  certain  polymer types,   for  example,  polyamide,  must  have  a  high  degree  of contact  with  the  yarn  guides  for  their  heat  treatment. This  treatment  may  advantageously  be  realized  with  a heating  apparatus  in  accordance  with  claims  12  and  13. The  configuration  of  claims  14  and  15  prevents  the  yarn from  contacting  the  groove  bottom  and,   thus,   from  being damaged  as  a  result  of  thermal  stress.    Likewise  in  this instance,   it  will  be  again  advantageous  to  bound  the bottom  corrugation  by  incisions  parallel  to  the  fold  line, when  the  channel  section  is  made  from  a  flat  sheet  metal strip.<br>
To  guarantee  an  adequately  high  resistance  to wear,   the  metal  strip  may  be  provided  on  it  inner  side,   at least  in  the  region  of  the  yarn  guides,  with  a  coating  of a  hard  material.     To  this  end,   the  metal  strip  or  the channel  section  with  the  yarn  guides  formed  thereon  may  be treated  with  nitride  or  boride.     The  coating    is from  10  to  30  /im.     Surface  hardnesses  from  1,000  HV  to 2,000  HV  are  obtained.     In  applications,  which  require  a protection  against  wear,   it  is  preferred  to  use  yarn guides  with  a  chromium  nitride  or  a  titanium  nitride<br><br>
coating.     These  relatively  thin  films  from  6  to  9  /im  are applied  by  the  PVD  or  the  CVD  process.     The  surface hardness  is  in  a  range  of  ^  3,500  HV.    At  this  point,   it should  be  noted  that  the  heating  apparatus  of  the  present invention  is  not  limited  to  the  aforesaid  types  of coating.     However,   other  commonly  used  types  of  coating may  be  applied  likewise.<br>
The  configuration  of  the  heating  apparatus  in accordance  with  claims  19  and  20  has  the  advantage  that several  heating  zones  with  a  different  yam  guidance  are formed,   thus  permitting  additional  optimizations  of temperature  and  yarn  quality.<br>
The  heating  zones  of  the  heating  apparatus  may be  flexibly  combined  in  accordance  with  claim  21.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a heating apparatus for heating an advancing yam, comprising an elongate heater with an axial groove, the groove having opposite side walls mounting several yam guides for guiding the yam along a zigzag line in axial direction through groove, characterized in that the yam guides are formed as elevations on two metal strips, and that the metal strips are supported in face&gt;to-face relationship on side walls, with opposite elevations being offset from one another.<br>

Figgie  7  is  a  schematic  top  view  of  a  heating apparatus  with  a  corrugated  channel  section.<br>
A metal  strip  3  comprises  along  its  axial direction  a  plurality  of  yarn  guides  that  are  formed  on its  one  side  in  the  shape  of  elevations  C.l.     The elevations  6.1  have  preferably  a  cross  section  in  the shape  of  a  divided  circle  or  divided  ellipsis,   and  they are  equal-sized  as  can  be  noted  from  Figure  1.     In  the region  of  the  yarn  guidance,  the  elevations  6.1  are  made cylindrical,   so  as  to  form  a  curved  yarn  guide  surface  20. At  one  end  of  the  yam  guides  or  elevations  6.1  a  bevel  10 is  formed.    The  bevel  10  is  inclined,  so  that  it  forms with  the  metal  strip  an  acute  angle.     The  bevel  is  located on  the  side  from which  the  yarn  is  inserted.<br>
The  metal  strips  3  are  shaped  by  means  of  cold or  hot  forming  processes  or  by  means  of  a  machine  cutting process  from  solid  material.     The  width  of  metal  strip  3, which  results  from  the  depth  of  elevation  6.1  and  the thickness  of  the  sheet  metal,  must  be  somewhat  larger  than half  the  width  of  an  axial  groove  2  that  is  formed  in  an heating  apparatus  1.<br>
Shown  in  Figure  2.1  is  a  heating  apparatus  1, which  has  an  axial  groove  2  arranged  therein.     Inserted into  axial  groove  2  are  two  metal  strips  3.1  and  3.2.     The metal  strips  3.1  and  3.2  are  supported  on  opposite  side walls  4  and  S  of  axial  groove  2.     In  the  Figure,   the elevations  6.1  of  metal  strip  3.1  and  the  elevations  6.2 of  metal  strip  3.2  are  formed  as  corrugations  21  and arranged  In  face-   relationship  offset  froe  one another,   the  depths  of  elevations  6.1  and  the  depth  of elevations  6.2  extending  beyond  the  center  plane  of  the groove.     The  surfaces  of  the  elevations  form  yarn  guide<br><br>
surfaces  20.    An  inserted  yam  7  is  deflected  on  you guides  6  such  that  it  forms  a  zigzag  course.<br>
The  metal  strips  3.1  and  3.2  of  Figures  2.1  and 2.2  are  sheet  metal  strips  with  corrugations  21  formed therein  by  stamping.    The  two  metal  strips  3.1  and  3.2  are interconnected  by  means  of  crosspieces  8  in  groove  bottom 9,  so  as  to  savvier  the  metal  strips  3.1  and  3.2  in  their position  relative  to  one  another.    The  crosspieces  8  are arranged  between  the  metal  strips  3.1  and  3.2,  preferably spaced  apart  from  groove  bottom  9,  so  as  to  prevent  yam  7 from  coming  into  contact  with  the  groove  bottom  9  of heating  apparatus  1.<br>
As  shown  in  Fig\ire  2.2,  the  metal  strips  3.1  and 3.2  terminate  with  their  elevations  6.1  and  6.2  in  a  bevel 10  on  the  yarn  insertion  side.    The  bevel  10  inclines toward  the  groove  center,   so  as  to  form  a  V-shaped  or  a circular  inlet  11  which  facilitates  the  insertion  of  yeurn 7.<br>
The  embodiment  of  Figxires  3.1  and  3.2  consists of  a  channel  section  or  a  shaped  sheet  metal  strip  14,  the yarn  guides  6  being  stamped  in  both  sides  of  the  uncial center  in  the  form  of  corrugations  21.    The  corrugations on  side  walls  14.1  and  14.2  alternate  from  one  side  to  the other  and  guide  the  yarn  in  a  zigzag  line  along  axial groove  2.<br>
The  channel  section  14  has  a  cross  section  which corresponds  to  the  cross  section  of  axial  groove  2.     The corrugations  21  euro  shaped  such  that  the  depth  of corrugation  21  increases  from  the  upper  side  of  axial groove  2  to  its  maximum  depth  that  is  necessary  for guiding  the  yarn.     This  results,   as  can  be  noted  from Figure  3.2,   in  a  bevel  10  and,  thus,   in  the  formation  of  a V-shaped  inlet  11,   which  facilitates  likewise  the insertion  of  the  yarn.<br><br>
To  keep  the  yam  off  the  groove  bottom,  bottom corrugations  12  are  provided  by  stamping  between  side walls  14.1  tend  14.2  of  channel  section  14.     These  bottom corrugations  12  extend  transversely  to  the  axial  groove, as  can  be  noted  from  Figure  3.3,   and  they  have  a  cross section  in  the  shape  of  a  divided  circle  or  divided ellipsis.     However,   other  cross  sections  are  possible.     To keep  the  contact  with  the  yarn  as  slight  as  possible,   it will  be  advantageous  to  form  the  bottom  corrugation  higher at  the  start  and  at  the  end  of  the  heating  zone,   so  that there  is  barely  a  contact  with  the  bottom  corrugations  in the  remaining  range  of  the  heating  zone.<br>
Shown  in  Figure  4.1  is  a  channel  section  with side  walls  14.1  and  14.2,  each  of  which  is  provided  by stamping  with  two  successive  corrugations  21,   which alternate  from  one  side  wall  to  the  other.     This arrangement  of  the  yarn  guides  allows  to  accomplish  that the  looping  of  the  yarn  can  be  reduced  by  50%  with  the same  number  of  yarn  guides  as  in  the  heating  apparatus  of Figure  3.1.     Furthermore,   in  the  heating  apparatus  of Figure  4.1,   the  spacing  between  oppositely  adjacent  yarns guides  6  is  made  smaller  at  the  inlet  end  of  the  heating zone  than  in  the  remaining  length  of  the  heating  zone. This  results  in  an  irregular  zigzag  course  of  the  yarn. In  particular  in  the  inlet  region,  the  short  zigzag  leads to  a  rapid  heating  of  the  yarn,   since  the  air  jacket curried  along  by  the  yarn  is  stripped  several  times  in  a rapid  succession.     In  addition,   the  yarn  is  rapidly smoothed  during  its  passage.<br>
Shown  in  Figure  4.2  is  a  heating  apparatus  with an  arrangement  of  yarn  guides,  which  permits  at  the beginning  a  small  looping  of  the  yarn  on  each  yarn  guide, so  as  to  then  change  over  to  a  regular  zigzag  course  with alternate  use  of  one  yarn  guide.    Also  in  this  embodiment, theâyarn  guides  are  formed  as  stamped-in  corrugations  2ir.<br><br>
Preferably,   the  channel  section  14  is  made  from a  flat  sheet  metal  strip  15.    To  this  end,  as  shown  in Figure  5.1,   the  sheet  metal  strip  15  is  folded  along  two lines  18  to  a  desired  shape.     The  corrugations  21  and bottom  corrugations  12  are  previously  shaped  in  the  sheet metal  strip  15  by  meme  of  a  bending  stamp  tool.     To delimit  the  corrugations  21  and  the  bottom  corrugations  12 relative  to  the  fold  line  18,   incisions  16  and  17  are  made before  the  shaping.<br>
In  sheet  metal  strip  15,  opposite  to corrugations  21,   inspection  windows  24  are  stamped  out  in each  of  the  facing  sidajyus.     These  inspection  windows 24  permit  a  visual  judgment  of  the  degree  of  soiling  on the  yarn  guides  in  the  dismantled  state.     Furthermore,   at the  one  end  of  the  sheet  metal  strip  a  hole  25  is  stamped out  for  applying  a  tool.<br>
Shown  in  Figgie  5.2  is  the  sheet  metal  strip  15 folded  to  a  channel  section.     This  channel  section  with corrugations  21  and  12  is  inserted,   as  illustrated, without  further  modification,   into  an  axial  groove  2  of  a heating  apparatus  1.<br>
Shown  in  Figure  6  is  a  heating  apparatus  with channel  sections  14  and  19  one  following  the  other  in  the longitudinal  direction  of  axial  groove  2.     The  metal strips  are  formed  in  this  embodiment  by  side  walls  14.1, 14.2  and  19.1,   19.2  of  channel  sections  14  and  19, Provided  by  stamping  in  side  walls  14.1  and  14.2  are corrugations  21.i  and  provided  in  side  walls  19.1  and  19.2 are  corrugations  21.2.    All  corrugations  21.1  and  21.2 have  the  same  depth.     The  spacings  between  corrugations 21.1  on  side  walls  14.1  and  14.2  and  the  spacings  between corrugations  21.2  and  side  walls  19.1  and  19.2  are  uneven, so  that  the  yarn  is  guided  differently  in  the  heating zones  of  channel  sections  14  and  19.<br><br>

The  corrugations  22  have  a rectangular  cross  section,   and  form  a  guide  surface  23  on their  longitudinal  side.    The  corrugations  22  extend through  the  center  plane  of  axial  groove 2,  so  as  to  guide the  yam  7  in  a  zigzag  course  along  axial  groove  2.    In the  region  of  corrugations  22,  the  yarn  7  is  in  contact with  guide  surface  23,  so  that  there  results  a  great length  of  contact.    This  heating  apparatus  permits  the yarn  to  be  heated  by  contact.<br>
The  heating  apparatus  shown  in  Figures  2.1-6  are elongate  rails.    Arranged  in  the  rail  is  an  axial  groove  2 with  opposite  side  walls  4  and  S.    The  axial  groove  2  is heated  by  a  resistance  heater  13.    Seune  is  constructed  as a  bar.     This  bar  is  inserted  into  a  bore,  which  is  axially arranged  in  the  base  plate  of  the  heating  apparatus.     To avoid     of  heat,   the  axial  groove  2  is  closed  in operation  by  a  lid,  after  the  yarn  is  inserted.<br><br>
