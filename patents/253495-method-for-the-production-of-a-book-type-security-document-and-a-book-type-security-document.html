				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The invention relates to a method for the production of a book-type security<br>
document and to a book-type security document, especially a passport book.<br>
A book-type security document, such as for example a passport or the like,<br>
comprises a book block and a passport card which are connected with each<br>
other before these are connected with a book cover to a passport book. The<br>
book block is produced of a paper or a paper-like material which comprises<br>
security characteristics. The passport card comprises a multitude of security<br>
elements and in the case of a passport, the book block is personalized,<br>
matching the passport card.<br>
There is considerable interest in protecting book-type security documents<br>
against forgeries and to make the production of forgeries technically<br>
impossible or at least uneconomical. Moreover, easy verifiability and<br>
checkability of intermediate products for book-type security documents or for<br>
security documents themselves should be rendered possible.<br>
From EP 0 784 829 B1, a carrier arrangement is known for mounting into a<br>
contactless chip card. This carrier arrangement comprises a transponder unit<br>
which is designed, for example, with a semiconductor chip and an antenna<br>
coil connected with it. These transponder units are suitable for the<br><br>
contactless operation of chip cards. The energy required for the operation is<br>
transmitted in a general form by means of electromagnetic waves from a<br>
terminal to the chip card. Data communications between the terminal and the<br>
chip card are also provided in this manner. Characteristics can thus be<br>
stored in the transponder unit.<br>
This carrier arrangement presents a so-called pre-laminate which is suitable<br>
for further processing in a chip card.<br>
From DE 197 11 343 A1, a plastic card with individual visual information is<br>
known in which a photographic layer is applied for personalization. This<br>
photographic layer is applied on a carrier which is laminated over on one<br>
side by a laminated layer, with the contacts of the card chip being left free<br>
from the covering over by the laminate.<br>
The invention is based on the objective of providing an economical and<br>
forgery-proof method for the production of security documents, as well as of<br>
providing a security document which enables contactless storage for security<br>
characteristics of the security document, data of the security document and<br>
personal data of the owner of the security document, for example, biometric<br>
characteristics.<br>
According to the invention, this problem will be solved by a method according<br>
to the characteristics of claim 1, as well as by a security document according<br>
to the characteristics of claim 20.<br>
The method for the production of a security document according to the<br>
invention, with at least one security cambric and at least one transponder<br>
unit which is fully encompassed by the laminated layers and forming a<br>
laminated layer sheath, has the advantage that a unit will be created which is<br>
difficult to forge. In the contactlessly operable transponder unit, encoded<br>
information or security characteristics of the security document can be<br>
stored, as well as data of the security document and personal data of the<br>
owner of the security document, such as biometric characteristics, for<br><br>
example. Thus, security characteristics can be provided randomly<br>
coordinated with each other or redundantly, with the laminated layer sheath<br>
providing at least mechanical protection. Moreover, the at least one security<br>
cambric and the at least one transponder unit can withstand higher strains<br>
such as, for example, when the security document is carried in a wallet or in<br>
rear trousers pockets, as well as strains due to accidental washing or<br>
stamping with a metal stamp or the like.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention, it is provided<br>
that the edge of the laminated layers - after complete encompassing of the<br>
at least one security cambric and the at least one transponder unit - will be<br>
stamped to an end format, cut, or cut to size by other separating methods.<br>
Thus, a uniform size for a book page can be created which corresponds with<br>
additional inside pages which are formed without laminated layers.<br>
The at least one security cambric and the at least one transponder unit or,<br>
respectively, their functions are integrated in one layer according to an<br>
advantageous embodiment of the invention. Thus, a security document can<br>
be produced which comprises a very thin structure. Due to the compact and<br>
at least partial integration, additional security characteristics can be<br>
developed, thus rendering manipulation more difficult.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the invention, it is<br>
provided that at least one transponder unit is applied on the at least one<br>
security cambric and that this composite is provided with laminated layers. It<br>
is thus rendered possible that - with a personalization page designed as a<br>
security cambric - a transponder unit is provided on a front or rear side<br>
which is laminated in, together with the personalization page. By means of<br>
this unit in which the transponder unit comprises in particular personalization<br>
data of the personalization page, a unit will be created which is particularly<br>
difficult to forge.<br>
Alternatively, it can also be provided that one transponder unit is applied on<br>
one inside page of a book-type security document - such as a passport book<br><br>
for example - and that this inside page and transponder unit will be fully<br>
encompassed and sheathed by the laminated layers. These inside pages<br>
advantageously comprise at least one security characteristic which can also<br>
be stored in the transponder unit.<br>
The two aforementioned embodiments ensure that any delamination or<br>
splitting of the security cambric and/or the transponder unit will be rendered<br>
impossible.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the invention, it is<br>
provided that a projection is created on the laminated layers on one side and<br>
the laminated composite is sewn into a book block in the area of the<br>
projection. Thus, the at least one security cambric and the at least one<br>
transponder unit provided in a sheathing of laminated layers can be<br>
introduced in the production of the book-type security document. This further<br>
renders any manipulation more difficult.<br>
According to another alternative embodiment of the invention, it is provided<br>
that - through the laminated layers - a double page for a book-type security<br>
document will be formed and, on one side, at least one security cambric is<br>
introduced and, on the other side, at least one transponder unit will be<br>
sheathed. This advantageous design has the advantage that - in the folding<br>
area of the double page - a stay or a seam area will be formed, via which the<br>
double page will be sewn in or fastened in the book block for the production<br>
of the security document. This embodiment provides the advantage that a<br>
minor thickness of the laminated layer sheath will be created, with the at<br>
least one security cambric as well as the at least one transponder unit being<br>
provided in a protective sheathing through the laminated layers.<br>
Alternatively, it can be provided that the double page is designed separately<br>
and that a projection is provided on one side each of the separately designed<br>
double page, said projection being provided for sewing into a book block or<br>
for working into a book-type security document.<br><br>
The laminated layers are advantageously glued or welded with each other<br>
under pressure and/or temperature. Thus, with the use of adhesive or the<br>
like, a fixation to each other can be provided at the same time between the at<br>
least one security cambric and the at least one transponder unit. During or<br>
before the laminated layers are laminated on, a casting compound can also<br>
be advantageously introduced for the fixation of an IC module or a chip<br>
module so that the module will be fixed and protected in the casting<br>
compound. This applies in particular for the lamination process. Another<br>
advantageous embodiment can be provided by the use of a double-sided<br>
adhesive tape which can be laminated, for example, with reactive adhesives.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the invention, it is<br>
provided that the at least one transponder unit will be personalized after the<br>
production of the laminated layer sheath. This personalization can be<br>
provided, for example, by the storage of biometric characteristics of the<br>
owner of the security document. With an algorithm, for example, a hash<br>
value on the basis of the ICAO line and/or the personalization data can be<br>
deposited on the IC module. Thus, at a later point in time, it can be checked<br>
whether the individual security characteristics and components correctly<br>
belong together, and any forgery can be reliably detected. In the same<br>
manner, an indelible numeric or alphanumeric and biunique value - existing<br>
in the IC module and being provided, for example, in the so-called write-once<br>
memory and/or in ROM memory and/or other written memories - is to be<br>
advantageously deposited visually discemibly on the security cambric,<br>
especially the personalization page.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the invention, it is<br>
provided that - after the production of a laminated layer sheath which<br>
encompasses at least one security cambric and at least one transponder unit<br>
- at least one security characteristic will be provided in the laminated layer<br>
sheath, in particular, lasering or a hole matrix. The additional introduction of<br>
security characteristics during the production of the security document will<br>
increase the forgery proof quality.<br><br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention for the<br>
production of a security document, the transponder unit comprises a chip<br>
module with an integrated antenna which is applied on a security cambric or<br>
a laminated layer by means of a tape automatic bonding process (TAB). This<br>
will ensure economic production. The advantage of this transponder unit is<br>
also its ruggedness and easier verifiability.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the invention, it is<br>
provided that the transponder unit comprises a chip module, wherein ICs are<br>
fastened on so-called interposer or, respectively, contact elements, with two<br>
contact elements then being electrically conductively connected with contact<br>
ends of the antenna coil. This can provide for another simple production of a<br>
transponder unit with contactless storage for biometric data and additional<br>
security characteristics.<br>
Another advantageous embodiment of the transponder unit provides that an<br>
un-housed IC module will be contacted - using flip chip contacting - with an<br>
antenna provided in the laminated layer. This embodiment provides the<br>
advantage of a flat-built transponder unit.<br>
According to another advantageous and alternative embodiment of the<br>
invention, it is provided that a transponder unit comprises a chip module with<br>
contacting for an external coil or antenna, the coil or the antenna being<br>
produced by means of screen printing, by means of conductive and polymer<br>
materials such as, for example, silver-filled pastes, through thin copper or<br>
aluminum or gold wires, through ultrasound by means of sonotrode<br>
technology, through etched coils on the basis of copper, aluminum or other<br>
conductive materials, through inkjet technology with a correspondingly<br>
conductive ink. Depending on the number of transponder units to be<br>
produced, one or the other embodiment can result in an economic production<br>
of the security document.<br>
Advantageously, the IC module is fastened and protected by means of a<br>
casting compound. This introduction achieves the advantage that the IC<br><br>
module is protected against environmental influences, especially against<br>
mechanical pressure. Moreover, fixation in a desired position to the security<br>
cambric can be provided. For example, a chip module can be positioned<br>
close to a passport photo or it can be on the edge of a personalization page<br>
or inside page to provide a maximum area for the antenna coils.<br>
Advantageously, the laminated layer sheath comprises at least one<br>
transparent laminated layer which is applied for lamination so that a security<br>
cambric is accepted visibly and in a machine-readable form.<br>
The book-type security document according to the invention - especially a<br>
travel document, according to any one of the preceding claims in a laminated<br>
layer sheath encompassing the at least one transponder unit and the at least<br>
one security cambric - has the advantage that the at least one security<br>
cambric and the at least one transponder unit are fully encompassed, and<br>
thus protected, by at least one laminated layer. The laminated layer can be<br>
designed as a sheath or as a pocket in which the at least one security<br>
cambric - for example in the form of a personalization page or an inside<br>
page provided with security characteristics - as well as at least one<br>
transponder unit are arranged and encompassed. Due to the preferably at<br>
least partial congruence of the security characteristics on the at least one<br>
security cambric and the at least one transponder unit, the forgery proof<br>
quality is considerably increased. Moreover, any splitting of the laminated<br>
layer to replace the at least one transponder unit and/or the at least one<br>
security cambric will result in a destruction of the entire composite. Due to<br>
this arrangement according to the invention, a personalization page, for<br>
example, with the characteristics introduced visually, photographically, by<br>
printing technology and/or laser technology can be duplicated and deposited<br>
contactlessly in the memory in the at least one transponder unit. Due to this<br>
redundancy of the security characteristics, manipulation will be rendered<br>
considerably more difficult.<br><br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the security document, it<br>
is provided that the at least one security cambric and the at least one<br>
transponder unit are each designed smaller than the end format of one page<br>
of a book block. This will ensure that the laminated layers form an exterior<br>
circumferential marginal area which exclusively consists of the at least one<br>
upper and lower laminated layer which are advantageously welded together<br>
to one unit in the marginal area and cannot be separated individually.<br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the security document, it<br>
is provided that the at least one laminated layer is designed as a covering<br>
film or as an overlay film. Depending on the cases of application and<br>
utilization, not only can at least one covering layer be applied but also at<br>
least one overlay layer. For example, a covering and/or overlay layer can be<br>
sectionally applied for the production of a uniform layer thickness of the<br>
laminated layer sheath so that uneven thicknesses by the chip module can<br>
be balanced out and the completed composite will comprise a uniform overall<br>
thickness.<br>
Further advantageous embodiments and developments of the invention are<br>
specified in the additional claims.<br>
In the following, the invention as well as additional advantageous<br>
embodiments and developments of the same will be described and explained<br>
in detail on the basis of the examples presented in the drawings. The features which can be gathered from the description and the accompanying drawings can<br>
be used individually by themselves or in a plurality in any combination<br>
according to the invention. It is shown in:<br>

embodiment of a book-type security document in<br>
opened up condition.<br>
Figure 1 presents diagrammatically a security document 11 in an opened up<br>
view. This security document 11 is preferably a travel document or a<br>
passport book. This security document 11 comprises a book lining 12, such<br>
as, for example, a book cover of a book on the outside as a reinforcing<br>
element. On the inside, an end paper 14 is provided. This end paper 14<br>
surrounds the book lining which encompasses a book cover. The security<br>
document 11 comprises at least one security cambric 15 in the form of at<br>
least one personalization page 16. Advantageously, at least one additional<br>
security cambric is provided as inside pages 17, 18 and 19. The inside pages<br>
17, 18 and 19 are designed, for example, as double pages 17', 18', 19' and,<br>
during the production of the security document 11, they are sewn with each<br>
other in the fold area with the personalization page to a book block 20.<br>
The security cambric 15 comprises, for example, on one rear side a<br>
transponder unit 21, with the security cambric 15 and the transponder unit 21<br>
each being surrounded by one upper and one lower laminated layer 22, 23.<br>
These laminated layers 22, 23 fully encompass the security cambric 15 and<br>
the transponder unit 21 and comprise a circumferential and closed edge 24,<br>
as also presented in detail, for example in the Figures 2 and 3. The<br>
laminated layers 22, 23 form a pocket or a sheath 25 around a composite 26<br>
which can consist of at least one security cambric 15 - which may comprise<br>
several layers - and at least one transponder unit 21. On one side of the<br>
laminated layer sheath 25, a projection 27 is formed in a size of 10 to 13 mm,<br>
for example. This projection 27 essentially contributes to the stability and<br>
fastening of a seam 28 by means of which the inside pages 17, 18, 19 are<br>
also fixed to a book block 20 together with the laminated layer sheath 25.<br>
Alternatively, it can also be provided that the security cambric 15 and the<br><br>
transponder unit 21 are integrated in one layer or built up and formed by the<br>
combination of several layers and/or partial layers. The following forms of<br>
embodiment apply for the aforementioned combination possibilities, as far as<br>
they are suitable.<br>
Figure 2 is a diagrammatic presentation of a top view of a personalization<br>
page 16 which is fully encompassed by laminated layers 22, 23. The front<br>
personalization page can be designed, for example, according to ICAO<br>
standards and comprises a photo 32 of the owner of the document, an OCR<br>
machine readable ICAO line 33, personalization data 34 and a diffractive<br>
structure 36 - over the full surface or in elements as in the exemplary<br>
embodiment - which can be provided on the surface or on the inside, as well<br>
as a number of additional security characteristics or elements not drawn in.<br>
The contour of the personalization page 16 is diagrammatically presented<br>
which is preferably produced of a security paper and additional security<br>
characteristics. This contour is dimensioned such that an edge 24 of a few<br>
millimeters surrounds the personalization page and also the at least one<br>
transponder unit 21 and such that the laminated layer sheath 25 does not<br>
project versus a book lining 12.<br>
Figure 3 presents a diagrammatic sectional view along the line ll-ll in Figure<br>
2 of a laminated composite 26. The personalization page 16 is<br>
advantageously equivalent to the size of the transponder unit 21. Basically,<br>
the transponder unit 21 can assume nearly any random forms and positions.<br>
However, an antenna 38 or, respectively, a coil of the transponder unit 21<br>
must comprise a geometry or, respectively, a surface or a number of<br>
windings so that a corresponding quality for the desired or required reading<br>
distance is given. The operating frequency is 13.56 MHz, for example, and<br>
allows the usual reading performance. The presented embodiment has the<br>
advantage that - especially in the area of the spine of the book or,<br>
respectively, the seam 28 - a relatively low thickness of the laminated layer<br>
sheath 25 is achieved so that the sewing process can be accordingly simply<br>
performed and, with a suitable selection of the laminated layers 22, 23, the<br><br>
requirements on bending frequency and stability as well as foldability will be<br>
met.<br>
The laminated layers 22, 23 can consist of a single laminated layer on each<br>
side or of multi-layered films, such as, for example, a combination of PE and<br>
PET or, respectively, PET-like materials with a high surface stability.<br>
Moreover, other thermoplastic films or sandwich-type film combinations can<br>
be used, such as, for example, PVC, ABS, PET-G, PET, PP, PA, teslin, PC,<br>
or the like.<br>
Figure 4 presents a diagrammatic top view onto a laminated composite 26 of<br>
a laminated layer sheath 25 in partial section. In this partial section, the<br>
arrangement of a transponder unit 21 to a personalization page is presented.<br>
The transponder unit 21 comprises at least one antenna 38 and one chip<br>
module 39 which are contacted via electrical connections 41 to each other,<br>
preferably on an interposer 40. The transponder unit 21 is arranged, for<br>
example, next to the personalization photo 31. The position of the antenna<br>
38	can be provided at random and optionally even in the entire area of the<br>
security cambric 15.<br>
Figure 5a is a diagrammatic sectional presentation of the laminated<br>
composite 26 according to Figure 4. A chip module 39 is applied on an<br>
antenna carrier film 46 so that an electrical contract between the chip module<br>
39	and the antenna 38 and, respectively, its connections is given. Optionally,<br>
a cover film 47 can be applied or laminated onto the antenna carrier film 46,<br>
the cover film preferably comprising a recess 45 in the area of the chip<br>
module 39 so that the chip module 39 is leveled in and the connections of<br>
the antenna 38 are mechanically protected at the same time. In thickness,<br>
the chip modules 39 range between 150 to 250 µm, ranging especially<br>
between 180 to 200 µm, and can be principally thinned. The usual antenna<br>
substrates for antenna carrier films 46 have a thickness of 6 to 500 µm,<br>
especially a thickness ranging between 30 and 120 µm, and can consist -<br>
depending on the production method and the required contacting methods of<br><br>
the chip module 39 - of PET, PI, FR-4, aramide, PVC, PS, PE, PA, PP, PE,<br>
teslin, PC, and similar materials. The antenna coils 38 can be produced of<br>
enameled copper wire with an ultrasonic sonotrode laying technology, for<br>
example. Alternatively, the antenna coils 38, as air coils, can be laid into a<br>
corresponding recess and laminated. Moreover, the antenna coils 38 can be<br>
produced by screen printing by means of polymer and conductive pastes<br>
(additive flexible printed circuit board technology) or as flexible printed circuit<br>
boards with subtractive technique, as an etching method in copper or<br>
aluminum.<br>
Figure 5b is a diagrammatic sectional view of an alternative embodiment of<br>
Figure 5a. A preferably transparent film - for example of PE or an equivalent<br>
material such as, for example, PET-G or PMMA - is designed as an antenna<br>
carrier film 46 or accepts at least the antenna 38. In a passage boring or<br>
punching of the preferably 100 to 500 µm thick layer, a chip module 39 is<br>
provided which can be contacted via contacts 41 on an upper side of the film.<br>
This composite 26 is encompassed by the laminated layers 22, 23.<br>
Figure 6 presents another alternative embodiment of a laminated composite<br>
26. The transponder unit 21 is applied on an antenna carrier film 46. On the<br>
underside, an overlay film 49 is provided for example which, if necessary,<br>
can protect the printed picture on the antenna carrier film 46 and contributes<br>
overall to the stability of the composite 26. This overlay film 49 can also be<br>
provided instead of a laminated layer 22 or 23, or it can be done without so<br>
that the film 46 takes over the functions of the overlay film. On the opposite<br>
side, a cover film 47 is preferably provided with a recess 45 which is<br>
protected by another cover film 48 or an overlay film 49. The laminated layer<br>
structure can have different numbers of superposed films.<br>
Figure 7 presents another diagrammatic top view of a laminated composite<br>
26. This embodiment deviates from Figure 4 insofar as the antennas 38 are<br>
provided in the outer marginal area of the personalization page 16. With a<br>
maximum number of windings, a maximum of communication reach can be<br><br>
achieved or, respectively, with a specified communication reach, a minimum<br>
of windings will be required.<br>
Figure 8 presents another alternative embodiment of a laminated layer<br>
sheath 25 to the Figures 4 and 5. This embodiment comprises a transponder<br>
unit 21 with a module-type minor variation of the embodiment of the antenna<br>
38 and a chip module 39. With such small antenna geometries, the antenna<br>
38 can be directly designed on the chip module 39, for example, by means of<br>
TAB technology. In this embodiment, the personalization page 16 can<br>
comprise, for example, a recess into which the module-type minor variation<br>
of the embodiment is inserted. Additionally, on the front and/or the rear side<br>
of the personalization page 16, a cover layer and/or an overlay layer can be<br>
provided which is thinned or perforated in design in the area of the<br>
transponder unit 21.<br>
Figure 9 presents another alternative embodiment of a laminated layer<br>
sheath 25. This is designed as a double page, and, for example, on a left<br>
side, the transponder unit 21 being protected by the laminated layers 22, 23<br>
and, on the right side, a personalization page 16 being surrounded by<br>
laminated layers 22, 23. In the fold area, a perforation or grooving is<br>
preferably provided which is introduced mechanically or thermally, to provide<br>
a seam 28 during the production of the security document 11 in a simplified<br>
form. This embodiment enables a separate arrangement of at least one<br>
security cambric 15 and at least one transponder unit 21 in a common<br>
laminated layer sheath 25.<br>
Figure 10 provides the laminated layer sheath 25 according to Figure 9 in a<br>
security document 11 which is presented in an opened up side view.<br>
Additionally to the double page, further inside pages 17, 18 and 19 can be<br>
provided via the seam 28 for the laminated layer sheath 25. Furthermore, it<br>
can be provided that the antenna carrier film 46 extends over the entire<br>
double page, with the fold area being designed such that secure plating-<br>
through is provided despite bending.<br><br>
Figure 11 presents an alternative embodiment of Figure 10. Instead of an<br>
embodiment of a laminated composite 26, for example, two laminated layer<br>
sheathes 25 are sewn with a projection 27 into a security document 11, with<br>
a first laminated layer sheath 25 fully encompassing a personalization page<br>
16 and the at least one other laminated layer sheath 25 encompassing the<br>
transponder unit 21. The front and rear side of the personalization page 16 is<br>
thus fully accessible. This embodiment provides that, for example, one<br>
laminated layer sheath 25 with one personalization page 16 or one inside<br>
page 17 can be separately produced, as well as one laminated layer sheath<br>
25 with one transponder unit 21 to join them in the production of the security<br>
document 11 and - by storing the personalization data in the transponder<br>
unit 21 - providing them with an increased forgery proof quality.<br>
The embodiment of the security document 11 presented in Figure 12<br>
deviates from the embodiment presented in Figure 11 such that the<br>
laminated layer sheath 25 comprising the personalization page 16 and/or<br>
one inside page 17, 18, 19 is arranged opposite the laminated layer sheath<br>
25 comprising the at least one transponder unit 21.<br>
Figure 13 presents another alternative embodiment of a security document<br>
11 in the side view in an opened up condition. The transponder unit 21 is<br>
provided on one inside page 17, 18 or 19 in the form of a sticker. This sticker<br>
is provided, for example, as a visa, as an extension of passports without a<br>
transponder unit, as a transponder unit for savings books and similar security<br>
documents. This embodiment has the advantage that the transponder unit 21<br>
according to Figure 6 is subsequently applied on the inside page 17, 18 or<br>
19 and an additional increase in forgery proof quality will be provided by the<br>
programming and storage of biometric characteristics and other personal-<br>
specific characteristics. Also, for example, after application of the sticker or<br>
the visa, lasering can be provided so that the page 17, 18 or 19 provided with<br>
the transponder unit 21 is also personalized. Fastening can be by means of<br>
cold adhesive or melt adhesive, or reactive and partially reactive adhesive<br>
systems can be used.<br><br>
The transponder unit 21 applied on the inside page can be cut or punched<br>
respectively, jointly with the inside at the end of the production process. In<br>
this embodiment, the transponder unit 21 is terminated shortly before the<br>
seam 28 or, respectively, the spine of the book so that - on all three other<br>
sides - a full-surface composite is provided with the inside page 17, 18 or 19,<br>
and bordering will only be performed at the end of the production process.<br>
When using a transponder unit 21 which is sheathed in a laminated layer<br>
sheath 25 or in a laminate pocket which consists of at least two laminated<br>
layers 22, 23, a shielding element can be advantageously provided in the<br>
security document 11. The shielding element is understood as an element<br>
which - in closed condition of the security document 11 - prevents a wireless<br>
communication with the transponder unit 21; however, it will enable<br>
communication in opened up condition. In particular, electronically<br>
conductive elements will be provided as shielding elements - such as<br>
electrically conducting pastes by printing technology, or thin laminated foils of<br>
aluminum, copper, steel or a wire fabric in a book cover and/or in a security<br>
cambric adjacent to the transponder unit 21. Principally, the shielding<br>
element need not be executed over the full surface but can also be line-like,<br>
in the form of a raster or the like so that there will be interference with RF<br>
radiation. The shielding element is arranged particularly close to the<br>
transponder unit 21; thus, particularly good shielding is provided through<br>
short circuits of the electromagnetic wave.<br>
The production of the laminated layer sheath 25 which comprises at least<br>
one security cambric 15 and one transponder unit 21 can be provided as<br>
follows:<br>
Firstly, the security cambric 15 is produced which consists, for example, of<br>
paper, plastic, or the like. This security cambric is produced with security<br>
characteristics such as a security print, visual elements, photographic<br>
elements, security characteristics produced by printing technology as well as<br>
characteristics applied by laser technology.<br><br>
The transponder unit 21 consists of a chip module 39 and an antenna 38.<br>
Depending on the structure of the laminated layer sheath 25, a chip module<br>
39 can be provided with an external antenna 38, as well as a chip module 39<br>
with an integrated antenna 38. With an un-housed chip module 39, a so-<br>
called flip chip contacting will be preferably selected in which the un-housed<br>
chip module 39 is directly applied to the antenna connections. The antenna<br>
substrate can be optionally designed and produced. The chip module 39 is<br>
preferably protected by means of a corresponding casting compound. If<br>
required or desired, this finished element can be directly fastened on a<br>
security cambric 15 by means of an adhesion mediator, with the chip being<br>
optionally provided in a blanking 45 in the security cambric 15 or a cover film<br>
47, 48 so that the increase by the chip or, respectively, the casting<br>
compound is provided in this blanking 45, or the antenna substrate can be<br>
reinforced with an additional laminate such that the chip with the casting<br>
compound is laminated largely flush or preferably flush and will thus be<br>
mounted flush on the personalization page.<br>
The transponder unit 21 can also be realized by a chip module 39 in which<br>
the ICs are fastened on so-called interposer or, respectively, contact<br>
elements 40 whose two contact elements will then be connected, electrically<br>
conductively, with the contact ends of the antenna coil 38. This IC assembly<br>
can also be provided by means of flip chip technology as well as by means of<br>
the conventional bond technology.<br>
In the design of a transponder unit 21 by means of a chip module 39 with an<br>
integrated antenna 38, a particularly efficient and economical process can be<br>
performed with the use of the so-called TAB process (tape automatic<br>
bonding). In case of the integration of the antenna 38 in the form of a coil or<br>
a dipole or a folded dipole, it can be economically produced in fine conductor<br>
etching on a thin FR-4 layer or a polyamide substrate or, respectively,<br>
principally also on a polyester or poly carbonate or polyamide or PVC or ABS<br>
substrate.<br><br>
The transponder unit 21 can be connected in a preferred embodiment with<br>
the security cambric 15. In an alternative embodiment, the transponder unit<br>
21 can be arranged adjacent to a security cambric 15, such as, for example,<br>
by the design of a double page, and the respectively separate arrangement<br>
can also be provided on one page.<br>
The security cambric 15 and the transponder unit 21 are designed preferably<br>
smaller than the end format of a book block. A laminated layer 22, 23 is<br>
applied on at least one side of the transponder unit 21 and the at least one<br>
security cambric 15, with the at least one security cambric 15 and the at least<br>
one transponder unit 21 being closed. Subsequently thereto or<br>
simultaneously, a circumferential edge 24 is formed which is produced by<br>
lamination under pressure and temperature, for example, in a roll laminator<br>
or in a lamination press. In another work step, the laminated sheath 25 is cut<br>
or punched to an end format.<br>
The laminated sheath 25 is introduced into a book block 20 or into a security<br>
document 11 and preferably sewn in. After their introduction, additional<br>
personalization characteristics can be provided in the laminated sheath 25 by<br>
hole matrix or by lasering.<br>
The above described characteristics can be combined at random with each<br>
other and are each inventive on their own.<br><br>
