TITLE<br>
A PROCESS FOR PREPARATION OF 6-(4, 7-DIHYDROXY- HEPTYL) QUINONE WITH ANTIFEEDANT AND ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY<br>
APPLICANT<br>
S. IGNACIMUTHU, N. RAJA, M. PAVUNRAJ AND V. DURAIPANDIYAN ENTOMOLOGY RESEARCH INSTITUTE, LOYOLA COLLEGE, CHENNAI- 600 034<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for preparation of 6-(4,7-dihydroxy-heptyl) quinone with antifeedant and antibacterial property thereof.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Applications of chemical pesticides affect the quality (nutritional contents) of the crop and increase agro-residues. Increased use of chemical pesticides over a long period has not only proved to be harmful to soil microflora, animals and human life, but also has contributed to a number of side effects, viz., development of resistance by the insects/ weeds/ pests resurgence and outbreak of new pests, toxicity to non-target organism like beneficial insects and humans. An insecticide has traditionally targeted nervous system functions that are common to many species including humans. The use of these neurotoxic insecticides has led to the killing of beneficial insects and posed a serious threat to humans and other animals. Dreadful facts of chemical pesticide demand for eco-friendly and environmentally safer alternate compound for crop protection.<br>
Plants are known to contain innumerable biologically active compounds. They yield valuable herbal products, which are often used in the treatment of various ailments. Plants have also been traditionally used to control insects. Hence, an attempt has been made to isolate some degradable, environment friendly biomolecule from the plant Pergularia daemia<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to propose a process for preparation of new compound with antifeedant and antibacterial property and a new compound thereof.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for preparation of a new compound with antifieedant and antibacterial property and a compound thereof to overcome the disadvantages of the prior art.<br>
Further object of this invention is to propose a process for preparation of a new compound with antifeedant and antibacterial property and a new compound thereof, which exhibited antifeedant and antibacterial activity.<br>
Still further object of this invention is to propose a process for preparation of a new compound with antifeedant and antibacterial property and a new compound thereof, which is not harmful to beneficial organism.<br>
STATEMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for preparation of new compound comprising steps of: -<br><br>
Dissolving powdered Pergularia daemia leaves in ethyl acetate to obtain mixture.<br>
Condensation of the filtered mixture   to obtain condensed crude extract. Collection of 5th fraction to obtain the  new compound.<br>
Further according to this invention there is provided a new compound with antifeedant and antibacterial properties which comprises 6-(4,7dihydroxy-heptyl) quinone.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Further objects and advantages of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing descriptions when read in conjuction with the accompanying drawings and wherein:<br>
Fig. 1 Shows a flow chart for the isolation of the new compound 6-(4,7-hydroxy-heptyl) quinone from ethyl acetate extract of Pergularia daemia (Fr. - Fraction; Hex - Hexane; EA - ethyl acetate)<br><br><br><br><br>
Fraction IV was obtained when 85% hexane and 15% ethyl acetate were mixed together and used as the elutent and poured over the crude extract fixed on top of the column and allowed to elute the compounds in the crude extract.<br>
Fraction V was obtained 80% hexane and 20% ethyl acetate were mixed together and used as the elutent and poured over the crude extract fixed on top of the column and allowed to elute the compounds in the crude extract.<br>
Fraction VI was obtained when 75% hexane and 25% ethyl acetate were mixed together and used as the elutent and poured over the crude extract fixed on top of the column and allowed to elute the compounds in the crude extract.<br>
The new compound, 6-(4,7dihydroxy-heptyl) quinone was found only in the tube containing fraction V. This new compound is applicable for agriculture, medical and pharmaceutical applications.<br>
STRUCTURE ELUCIDATION<br>
The following details are found after subjecting the compound to FTIR, 1HNMR and 13CNMR. The details of the study are provided here.<br>
The structure of this quinone was elucidated by spectroscopic methods such as *H NMR, I3C-NMR and IR-Spectrophotometer. 5-) 4,7- dihydroxy heptyl) cyclohex-2-ene-l, 4-dione, semi solid)<br>

BIOLOGICAL ACTIVITY OF 6-(4JDIHYDROXY-HEPTYU OUINONE<br>
i) Antifeedant activity of 6-(4,7dihydroxy-heptyl) quinone against SAitura and H. armigera<br>
Antifeedant activity of the compound 6-(4,7-dihydroxy heptyl) quinone was studied with leaf disc no choice method (Isman, 1990). Fresh leaf discs (3-cm diameter) of castor and cotton were used for S. litura and H. armigera, respectively. The leaf discs were treated with 100, 250, 500, 1000 and 2000 ppm of the compound individually; the leaf disc treated with acetone was considered as positive control and the leaf disc without solvent was considered as negative control. In each petri dish (1.5 cm x 9 cm) wet filter paper was placed to avoid early drying of the leaf disc. A fourth instar larva of S. litura and H. armigera was introduced individually. Five replicates were maintained for each concentration and progressive consumption of leaf area by the larva after 24 h was recorded in control and treated discs using leaf area meter (Delta - T Devices, Serial No. 15736 F 96, UK). The percentage of antifeedant index was calculated using the formula of Ben Jannet, et al., (2000)<br>
S3<br><br><br>
ii) Antibacterial activity of 6-(4,7dihydroxy-heptyl) quinone<br>
The antibacterial activity was carried out by using disc diffusion method (Bauer et al, 1966). The new compound 6-(4,7-dihydroxy-heptyl) quinone was dissolved in 2% dimethyl sulfoxide ((DMSO). Sterile paper discs were impregnated with different concentrations corresponding to 25, 50, 75, 100 and 125 jig/disc. These discs were allowed to dry at room temperature. The impregnated discs were then placed on the preinoculated Muller Hinton Agar (MHA) plates. (10^g/disc) Chloramphenicol was used as reference control and DMSO was used as negative control. Plates were incubated at 37°C for 24 h. and zone of inhibition was observed and recorded.<br><br>
Advantages of this invention<br>
Crude ethyl acetate extract of Pergularia daemia exhibits significant antifeedant and antibacterial activity at 5% concentration against Helicoverpa armigera and Spodoptera litura polyphagous insects of crop plants and against bacteria such as Bacillus subtilis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli and Proteus vulgaris. Six fractions were isolated from ethyl acetate extract of which fraction showed strong antifeedant and antibacterial activity.<br>
In this fraction a new compound responsible for antifeedant and antibacterial activity, which is 5-(4,7-dihydroxyheptyl) cyclohex-2-ene-l, 4-dione, was found which was confirmed using FTIR, ]HNMR and 13CNMR; data. The quinone enhances the antifeedant and antibacterial activity of the compound. The larvae after feeding due to the insecticidal activity of the compound fail to moult and ultimately die. Since this compound is having antifeedant activity against the potential pests Helicoverpa armigera<br><br>
and Spodoptera litura, it is therefore useful for controlling other pests also; hence this compound is useful in the pest management. The compound isolated from Pergularia daemia does not show any phytotoxicity and is not harmful to other beneficial organisms. The new compound 6- (4,7-dihydroxy heptyl) quinone of the present invention can also be used in medical, pharmaceutical applications.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
1.	Two kg of plant powder was extracted with 8 litres of ethyl acetate (l:4w/v) for<br>
48 hrs.<br>
2.	The powder was soaked in ethyl acetate for 48 hrs. After that the supernatant was<br>
collected. The solvent was condensed for 30 minutes using vacuum rotary<br>
evaporator at 40° water bath and with 25-30 Hg pressure for maximum<br>
condensation. After condensation the crude extract was kept in refrigerator at 4°<br>
until further use.<br>
3.	18 g of crude extract was obtained from 2 kg of plant powder i.e. 0.90%<br>
It is to be noted that the present invention is susceptible to modifications, changes, and adaptations by those skilled in the art. Such modifications, changes adaptations are intended to be within the scope of the present invention, which is further set forth under the following claims.<br><br></td>
