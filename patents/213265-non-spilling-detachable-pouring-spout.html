				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
a)	Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved non-spilling pouring spout which can be attached to most containers for use in pouring liquid from a filling container into a receiving container, with no risk of accidental spillage and/or evaporation.<br>
b)	Brief description of the prior art<br>
Pouring spouts on containers, for use in filling other containers or tanks with liquid, are well known. In use, the container with the spout is tipped to position the spout downwardly in a filling neck on the container to be filled. During the tipping operation however, liquid can be spilled from the spout before it is properly positioned relative to the filling neck. With known scouts it is also difficult to know when the container being filled becomes full. Often the container overflows because the person filling the container cannot see past the spout in the filling neck. More liquid can be spilled when the spout is withdrawn from the filling neck. Furthermore, when transferring volatile and highly inflammable liquid, dangerous gaseous vapours escape from the receiving container. All these problems raise significant safety concerns th known spouts. This can results in dangerous explosions for the home o\ r refuelling his lawn mower, skin contamination for the farmer handling pesticic and herbicides, and injury for persons using liquids which are harmful upon con : with the skin, such as acid. It is. known to provide containers with spouts which have liquid valves therein to control the flow of liquids through the spouts. The liquid valves are arranged to automatically open the spout when it is inserted in the filling neck of a receiving container and to automatically close the spout when it is withdrawn from the neck. However, much of the known spouts which can be attached to a filling<br><br>
3<br><br><br><br>
container do not address or offer an effective solution to the problem of spillage due to overflowing. Additionally, these known spouts do not resolve the problem of liquid spillage due to liquid left in the dispensing tube between the valve an the outlet end of the tube. When the spout is withdrawn from the receiving container, the liquid contained between the valve and the outlet end of the tube is spilled. Further, the known valve equipped spouts do not provide a locking mechanism which prevents accidental valve opening, neither they provide means for preventing evaporation. Examples of such spouts are disclosed in U.S. patents 1,167,589; 2,822,832; and 3,074,444.<br>
U.S.  patent No. 4,958,668 issued to the present inventor discloses a pouring spout which solves the problems mentioned herein above. The spout disclosed in this patent comprises an inlet tube for receiving liquid from the filling container, and an outlet tube operatively coupled to the inlet tube for guiding liquid therefrom into the receiving container. The inlet tube has an inlet portion provided with means for attaching it to the filling container, and a main portion. The outlet tube has a collar-like portion telescopically mounted onto the main portion of the outlet tube, and a short outlet portion of a smaller diameter than the inlet tube. The spout also comprises a liquid valve which includes a valve head and means for connecting the valve head to the outlet tube. The connecting means comprises a perforated plate extending across a lowermost end of the collar-like portion of the outlet tube and a pin having one end connected to a central portion of the perforated plate and another end connected to the valve head. A valve seat is disposed at substantially a lowermost end of the main portion of the inlet tube, whereby spillage of liquid contained in the spout is prevented. A spring is mounted within the collar-like portion of the outlet tube between the perforated plate and the lower most end of the main portion of the inlet tube for biasing the valve in a normally closed position. At least one stop responsive to an upward force is also mounted externally on a surface of the lowermost end of the collar-like portion of the outlet tube for opening the valve. The main portion of the inlet tube and the collar-like portion of the outlet tube are coaxial whereas the outlet portion of the outlet tube downstream the liquid valve extends at an angle substantially less than<br><br>
4<br><br><br><br>
90° with respect to this axis. According to this invention, the fact that the valve is located in close proximity to the outlet of the spout eliminates spillage upon withdrawal of the spout. However, this spout does not provide means regulating an airflow for preventing spillage of liquid when the receiving container is full, neither it resolves the problem of liquid evaporation.<br>
Canadian patent No. 1,228,334.issued also to the present inventor, is an improvement of the structure of the pouring spout disclosed in U.S. patent No. 4,958,668. According to a preferred embodiment, the spout disclosed therein further comprises an air regulating means comprising a rib having a substantially central hollow passage having one end open to ambient temperature and another end opening inside the outlet portion of the inlet tube. The rib projects from a surface of the inlet tube and extends substantially parallel to said coaxis. An elongated rod is disposed in the hollow passage and an air valve is disposed inside the external rib at one end of the rod. Means are provided for biasing this air valve in a normally closed position. In addition, an elevation is disposed on the collar-like portion to the outlet tube and aligned with the other end of the rod, whereby an upward force on the stop causes this rod to contact this elevation and open the air valve. Therefore, this air regulating means provide an air passage into the filling container. Advantageously, the elevation disposed on the collar-like portion to the outlet tube is positioned in such a manner that the air vaive allowing air to enter the container is actuated only when the main valve is opened 2/3 of its maximum opening. This particular embodiment prevents liquid leaks by regulating the speed wherein the liquid flows inside the spout. However, this spout do not provide an air regulating means allowing air to flow from a downstream end of the outlet tube inserted inside the receiving container, up into the filling container thereby preventing spillage of liquid when the receiving container is full. It does not either provide a solution to the problem of evaporation.<br>
It is thus an object of the present invention to provide an economically manufactured, improved non-spilling pouring spout for use by persons of all skill levels. It is also an object of the present invention to provide a pouring soout which<br><br>
5<br>
can be adapted to a variety of dispensing containers to permit the transfer of a broad range of liquids including fuels, paint thinner, chemicals, chlorine, and painter's ink. The problems of overflow, spiuage, and evaporation associated with the transfer of these liquids from a dispensing container into a receiving container are obviated by the present invention.<br>
The present invention also fulfils other needs which will be apparent to those skilled in the art upon reading the following specification.<br>

end of the main portion of the inlet tube; and<br>
-	biasing means mounted between the perforated plate and the<br>
valve seat for biasing the valve head against the valve seat in a<br>
normally closed position;<br>
d)	stop  means  responsive to  an  upward   force,  the  stop   means  being<br>
operatively connected to the liquid valve for opening said liquid valve when<br>
an upward pressure is applied to the pouring spout and thus allowing<br>
transfer of liquid from the filling container to the receiving container; and<br>
e)	air regulating means operatively connected to the liquid valve, the air<br>
regulating means allowing air to flow from outside the spout into the<br>
receiving container upon actuation of the liquid valve;<br>
characterized in that the air regulating means comprises :<br>
-an "air passage extending inside'the spout from the downstream end of the outlet tube up to the upstream end of the inlet tube, said passage providing an air flow entering from the downstream end of the outlet tube up into the filling container;<br>
-an air valve devised to regulate an air flow inside said passage upon actuation of the liquid valve; and<br>
-sealing means disposed around the main portion of the inlet tube and under the slidable collar-like portion of the outlet tube for coupling in a sealing manner said main portion and said slidable collar-like portion.<br>
It is also an object of this invention to provide an improved pouring spout of the type set forth wherein the air regulating means includes a rod having a first<br><br>
6<br>
end connected to the valve head and a second end operatively connected to the  air valve.<br>
It is still a further object of this invention to provide an improved detachable pouring spout of tne type set forth wherein the air regulating means comprises:<br>

DESCRIPTION OF SEVERAL PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
A pouring spout 1 according to the invention, is devised for transferring liquid from a filling container 3 to a receiving container 5. For example, as shown in Fig. 1, the pouring spout can be permanently or detachably mounted on a container 3 to fill a small tank 5 on a lawn mower 7 with gasoline.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3A, the pouring spout 1 comprises an inlet tube 11, and an outlet tube 21. The inlet tube 11 has an inlet portion 13 with an upstream end 14 and a downstream end 15 and a main portion 17 with an upstream end 18 and a downstream end 19. The downstream end 15 of the inlet portion 13 is adjacent to the upstream end 18 of the main portion 17. The inlet tube 11 also comprises an air channel 12 and a liquid channel 16 which extend inside the inlet tube 11 from the upstream end 14 of the inlet portion 11 to the downstream end 19 of the main portion 17. Furthermore, the inlet portion 13 is provided with or operatively connected with suitable connecting means 10 for attaching the inlet tube 11 to the filling container 3. In the preferred embodiment illustrated in Fig. 3A, the connecting means 10 includes a collar (not shown) and an O-ring 8, the collar being detachably coupled to a flange 4 and screwed in a sealing manner to the filling container 3 with the help of the O-ring 8. Other types of connecting means are well known in the art.<br>
As best shown in Fig. 3B, the outlet tube 21 is operatively coupled to the inlet tube 11 for guiding liquid 8 thereiFrom into the receiving container. The outlet tube 21 has a collar-like portion 23 devised to be telescopicaliy slidable onto the main portion 17 of the inlet tube 11 and an outlet portion 27 devised to be inserted inside the receiving container. The collar-like portion 23 has an upstream end 26 and a downstream end 25. The outlet portion 27 also has an upstream end 28 and a downstream end 29. The downstream end 25 of the collar-like portion 23 is adjacent to the upstream end 28 of the outlet portion 27. The outlet portion 27 is<br><br>
10<br>
also sized to fit inside the receiving container 5. As for the inlet tube 11, the outlet tube 21 comprises an air channel 22 and a liquid channel 26 which extend inside throughout the outlet portion 27 from its upstream end 28 to its downstream end 29. As can be appreciated, the liquid channels 16, 26 of the inlet 11 and outlet tubes 21 are operatively connected together for forming a liquid passage for guiding the liquid 9 from the filling container 3 into the receiving container 5. Also, the air channels 12, 22 of the inlet 11 and outlet tubes 21 are operatively connected together for forming an air passage wherein air may flow from the downstream end 29 of the outlet tube 21 into the filling container 5. Preferably, a circular seal 30 is disposed around the main portion 17 of the inlet tube 11 and under the slidable collar-like portion 23 of the outlet tube 21. This seal 30 can be made of a rubber-like material and helps avoiding air and liquid leak from inside the spout 1.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3C, the pouring spout 1 also comprises a liquid valve 31 located inside the liquid channel 16 of the inlet tube 11. The liquid valve 31 normally closes the liquid passage and includes a valve head 33; a valve seat 35; means 37 for connecting the valve head 33 to the outlet tube 21; and biasing means 39 for biasing the valve head 33 against the valve seat 35 in a normally closed position.<br>
As shown in Fig. 3A, the valve head 33 is preferably made of rubber-like material and it normally sits in a closed position on the valve seat 35. The valve seat 35 is fixed to the interior of the liquid channel 16 at substantially the downstream end 19 of the main portion 17 of the inlet tube 11. The valve seat 35 is preferably molded integrally to the liquid channel 16 of the inlet tube 11 and defines a circular valve opening.<br>
Fig. 3A also shows that the means 37 for connecting the valve head 33 to the outlet tube 21 comprise a perforated plate 41 extending across the upstream end 28 of the outlet portion 27 of the outlet tube 21. The plate 41 is preferably molded integrally to the liquid channel 26 of the outlet tube 21. A pin 43 extends<br><br>
11<br>
V<br>
perpendicularly therefrom the plate 41, the pin 43 having one end 44 connected to a central portion of the perforated plate 41 and another end 45 connected to the valve head 33. The biasing means 39 are mounted between the perforated plate 41 and the valve seat 35 for biasing the valve head 33 against the valve seat 35 in a normally closed position. Preferably, the biasing means 39 comprise a spring 47 mounted around the pin 43, the spring 47 having a first end 48 biasing against the plate 41 and a second end 49 biasing against the valve seat 35.<br>
Fig. 3A further shows that the pouring spout 1 also comprises an air valve 51 located inside the inlet tube 11 at substantially the upstream end 14 of the inlet portion 13. The air valve 51 has a portion 53 operatively connected to the inlet tube 11, a bump 55 projecting at least partially inside the air channel 12 of the inlet tube and biasing means 57 for normally biasing the bump 55 against the air channel 12 in a normally closed position. Preferably, the air valve 51 comprises a rubber-like ring 58 extending inside the inlet tube 11 and a tongue 59 extending radially therefrom. The tongue 59 comprises a bump 55 projecting perpendicularly therefrom towards the air channel 12. Preferably also, the biasing means 57 for biasing the bump 55 against the air channel 12 are operatively connected to a rod 61 as it will be explained herein below.<br>
The spout further comprises a rod 61 having a first end 63 and a second end 65. The rod 61 extends from behind the liquid valve 31 inside the inlet tube 11 up to the second end 65. The first end 63 of the rod 61 is operatively connected to the valve head 33. The second end 65 extends at a distance away from the air valve 51 when the liquid vaive 31 is in closed position as in Fig. 3A. However, the second end 65 of the rod 61 comes into contact with and presses against the air valve 51 to open the same when the liquid valve 31 is in a substantially fully opened position as in Fig. 3C.<br>
As explained herein before, the air valve 51 preferably comprises a ring 58, a tongue 59 and a bump 55. Accordingly, the second end 65 of the rod 61 preferably comprises a wall 67 coming into contact with and pressing against the<br><br>
air valve 51 to open the same when the liquid valve 31 is in a substantially fully opened position as in Fig. 3C. A thin cylindrical portion 69 extends therefrom the wall 67 through the tongue 59, the cylindrical portion 69 comprising a head 68 and a spring 70. Therefore, the spring 70 and the head 68 of the rod's cylindrical portion 69 are located on a first side of the tongue 59 opposite to another side of the tongue 59 which is close to the wall 67. The spring 70 has a first end leaning against the head 68 of the cylindrical portion and a second end leaning against the tongue 59, thereby biasing the bump 55 of the tongue 59 against the first air channel 12 in a normally closed position as in Fig. 3A.<br>
The spout 1 further comprises stop means 71 responsive to an upward force. The stop means 71 is operatively connected to the liquid valve 31 for opening the same when an upward pressure is applied to the pouring spout 1 and thus allowing transfer of liquid 9 from the filling container 3 to the receiving container 5. Preferably the downstream end 29 of the outlet portion 27 of the outlet tube 21 is of a smaller diameter than the upstream end 28 of the outlet portion 27 of the outlet tube 21. Accordingly, once the downstream end 29 of the outlet portion is inserted inside the receiving container 5, the upstream end 28 of the outlet portion 27 of the outlet tube 21 defines the stop means 71 whereby an upward pressure from the receiving container 5 can be applied to (see Fig. 3C).<br>
In the illustrated preferred embodiments, the main portion 17 of the inlet tube 11 and the collar-like portion 23 of the outlet tube 21 are straight and coaxial, and the outlet portion 27 of the outlet tube 21 downstream the liquid valve 31 extends at an angle lower than 90° with respect to said axis. The illustrated preferred embodiments further preferably comprise a pair of opposite teeth 40 embodied on an external surface of the outlet portion 27 of the outlet tube 21. According to the exact location and shape of the teeth 40, they may be used as a spot against which the upward pressure from the receiving container 5 is applied. The teeth 40 may also help in blocking an horizontal movement of the spout 1 with respect to the receiving container 5.<br><br>
13<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the pouring spout of the invention may also comprise a dust protector 91 adapted to fit on the downstream end 29 of the outlet tube 21 and blocking means 81 to avoid that an upward pressure effected against the pouring spout opens the liquid valve (not shown). The pouring spout 1 may further comprise a filter (not illustrated) disposed inside the spout 1 or at ends thereof for preventing contaminants from entering the receiving container.<br>
Figures 4A, 4B, 5A and 5B show an example of a preferred blocking means 81. The illustrated blocking means comprises a compressible a handle 83. The handle 83 comprises a pair of anchoring ends 84 operatively connected to an external surface of the inlet tube 11 close to the upstream end 24 of the outlet tube 21, and a blocking end 85 extending into a slot 87. Preferably a pair of slots 87,87' extend inside the downstream end 19 of the main portion 17 of the inlet tube 11 on both side thereof. A pair of arms 89,89', having an angular end, extends towards and coaxial to the slot 85, from both sides of the upstream end 24 of the collar-like portion 23 of the outlet tube 21. Accordingly, the handle 83 has a rest position (see Figs. 4A and 5A) wherein its blocking end 85 blocks the slot 87 to the arm 89, thereby preventing the collar-like portion 23 of the outlet tube 21 to slide onto the main portion 17 of the inlet tube 11. The handle 83 also has a compressed position (see Figs. 4B and 5B) wherein its blocking end 85 slides out the slot 87, thereby allowing the arms 89,89' to slide into their corresponding slots 87,87' and the outlet tube 21 to slide onto the main portion 17 of the inlet tube 11. In the compressed position, the handle 83 is biased such that the blocking end 85 automatically goes back into the slot 87 once freed from the arm 89. Although not illustrated, other blocking means known in the art such as means using a blocking pin are conceivable according to the present invention.<br>
Figures 3A, 3B, 3C, 3D and 3E illustrate a preferred embodiment of the pouring spout 1 of the invention in operation. The spout 1 is initially inserted down into the filling neck 6 of the tank 5 to be filled (Fig. 3A). The liquid valve 31 is normally closed by the spring 47, thus preventing any liquid 9 from passing out the spout 1 as it is positioned in the neck 6. As the spout 1 is more fully inserted into<br><br>
14<br>
the neck 6, the teeth 40 on the outlet tube 21 contact the neck 6. The outlet tube 21 starts to smoothly and evenly slides up onto the inlet tube 11 as shown in Fig. 3B. As the outlet tube. 21 slides up the pin 41 attached therein, the pin 41 moves the valve head 33 up off the valve seat 35, against the force of the spring 47, to open the liquid valve 31. This allows the liquid 9 to now enter the tank 5 being filled (Fig. 3B).<br>
The rod 61, having its first end 63 connected to the valve head 31 will also move but the air valve 51 will remain in closed position. Indeed, 1) the cylindrical portion 59 of the rod's second end 65 will move throughout the tongue 59 of the air valve 51; 2) the wall 67 will not press against the tongue 59 because it extends at a distance away from the air valve 51. Accordingly, in the position illustrated in Fig. 3B, the flow rate of liquid 9 will be relatively slow because of a suction caused by the flowing liquid. A negative air pressure will build up into the filling container 3 and the flow of liquid will have to stop sporadically to allow air to flow inside the liquid passage, from outside the spout 1 up into the filling container 3.<br>
Figure 3C shows another position wherein the outlet tube 21 has slid further to fully open the liquid valve 31 and also open the air valve 51. By sliding further up onto the inlet tube 11 than in Fig. 3B, the liquid valve 31 has opened fully and moved the rod 61 accordingly. In Fig. 3C, the second end of the rod 65 thereby presses against the air valve 51 against the force of the spring 70. This allows air "A" to flow through the air passage from outside the spout 1 up into the filling container 3. The air pressure inside the filling container 3 thus equilibrates automatically as the liquid 9 flows therefrom. Accordingly, the flow rate will be relatively rapid since there is no stop. Furthermore, advantageously, the flow of air "A" highly reduces emanations of volatile liquid since these emanations will be returned back into the filling container.<br>
Figure 3D shows, as a person skilled in the art can understand in view of Figs. 3A to 3C, that the flow of liquid into the spout stops automatically when a level "M" of liquid 9 reaches the downstream end 29 of the outlet portion 27 of the<br><br>
15<br>
outlet tube 21. At such this maximum level "M", air would not be able to flow neither into the liquid passage, nor the air passage and the negative air pressure in the filling container 3 will be sufficient to retain liquid 9 therein against gravity. Spilling of liquid over the neck 6 of the receiving container 5 will thus be avoided, another major advantage of the spout 1 of the present invention. No other pouring spout known in the art possesses this advantage.<br>
When filling is completed, the spout 1 is withdrawn from the neck 6 of the receiving container 5. Because of the force of the spring 47 of the liquid valve 31, the outlet tube 21 will thus simultaneously slide downwardly, causing 1) the liquid valve 31 to close partially, and simultaneously, the air valve 51 to close fully; 2) subsequently causing the liquid" valve 31 to close fully. Liquid 9 remaining in the outlet portion 27 of the outlet tube 21 will thus flow by itself into the receiving container 5.<br>
As shown in Fig. 2, the spout of the invention may further comprise one or a plurality of holes 73 extending through an upper portion of the outlet tube 21. Although not visible on this Figure, the holes 73 are positioned to extend between the valve seat and the valve head of the liquid valve when the outlet tube 21 is in a downward position i.e. when the liquid valve is substantially closed. With the holes 73 air may flow from ahead of the liquid valve towards the downstream end 29 of the outlet tube 21. These holes 73 will help to empty more rapidly the outlet tube 21 from liquid remaining therein. When the outlet tube 21 is slide up onto the inlet tube 11 to open the liquid valve, the holes move accordingly to adopt a position behind the valve head and the circular seal disposed around the main portion of the inlet tube 11 thereby preventing liquid to leak therefrom.<br>
The pouring spout 1 can be made of non-corrosive material such as plastic so that corrosive liquids can be safely transferred without damaging the spout 1 structure.<br><br>
