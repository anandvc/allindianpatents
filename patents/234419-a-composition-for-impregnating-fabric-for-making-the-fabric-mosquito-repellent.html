THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES THE INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the textile fabric and articles and garments made of textile fabric.<br>
Particularly this invention relates to fabric, garments and articles made from textile fabric having insect repellent property.<br>
INTRODUCTION<br>
Mosquitoes are known to transmit diseases like yellow fever, dengue, epidemic, polyarthritis, malaria and several forms of encephalitis, which can lead to serious illness and even death. The excrement of insect as well as their dead body has been identified as a significant allergen and can cause disease such as asthma in children. Therefore, many efforts have been made to eradicate or at least to control these pests. The methods for avoiding mosquito bites include limiting the time spent outdoors at dawn and dusk, wearing protective clothing and using insect repellents.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In the prior art, Permethrin - a synthetic pyrethroid, a repellent as well as knockdown, is used for insect repellency. Pyrethroids and their synthetically prepared analogs effectively control a variety of pests, such as ticks, cockroaches, houseflies, mosquitoes, black flies, fleas, and other flying or crawling insects. Despite these highly favourable characteristics, Permethrin has only limited general utility because of its relatively short-lived insecticidal activity. This is due to the decomposition of Permethrin into a non-active, non-insecticidal product in the presence of oxygen and ultraviolet light.<br>
Other insect repellents derived from plants such as citronella, geranium, basil, garlic and peppermint generally provide only temporary protection from mosquitoes. Also, these plant-based repellents are generally less effective. The candles made up of citronella can be mildly effective mosquito<br>
2<br><br>
repellents. One research study compared candles with 3% citronella to plain candles in preventing bites from the Aedes mosquito. Persons near the citronella candles had 42% fewer bites than unprotected persons; ordinary candles provided a 23% reduction.<br>
Although there are many insect repellents, which can be directly applied to the skin as spray, lotion, cream and tick products but they become less effective with time. These insect repellents when directly applied on skin can cause irritation, allergy or itching on skin of the user, especially, on babies and young children's skin because their skin is more susceptible to irritation and allergies. Apart from these disadvantages, the insect repellents should not be applied to children's hands because they may put hands into their mouths and eyes and may cause further problems. Another limitation is that these insect repellents cannot be applied over cuts, wounds, or irritated skin. Also, because of sweating, perspiration or getting wet, the user may need to re-apply the repellent more frequently.<br>
US patent no. 5198287 describes a Permethrin based tent fabric with insect repellent properties. The coated tent fabric has a fabric substrate with a coated outer surface normally exposed to degrading elements of the atmosphere and a coated inner surface normally shielded by the fabric substrate from the degrading elements of the atmosphere. The limitation of this invention is that the insect repellent properties are effective only for six months.<br>
US patent 6015570 discloses an insect-repellent composition and process of making the same. The invention describes a fabric composition, which consists of fabric substrate and an application of an aqueous composition formed by an insect-repellent composition, which contains an amine insect-repellent, at least one reactive silicone, and starch. The overall stability of the insect-repellent composition may be affected by coating the composition with, for example, a waxy compound, gelatine, polyethylene glycol and derivatives.<br>
3<br><br>
US patent 6054182 discloses a method of delivery of insect repellent which controls the amount and toxicity of a repellent applied directly to garments, particularly children's garments.<br>
An amine insect repellent, N, N'-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET), is found to be stable at both reduced and elevated temperatures and under storage conditions. DEET is the most effective mosquito repellent as compared to other insect repellent. It works by masking the telltale odours of carbon dioxide and lactic acid given off by the body, and by confusing the homing insect at close range. A higher percentage of DEET should be used if the user is outdoors for several hours, while a lower percentage of DEET can be used if time outdoors is limited. DEET has proved to be very effective on biting flies, chiggers, deerflies, fleas, leeches, mosquitoes, and ticks. But DEET, when directly applied to the skin may have some serious effects such as it may cause injury to eyes, mucous membranes, and sensitive skin.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome the limitations of the prior art and to provide fabrics having mosquito repellent property and garments and other articles made from that fabric which will repel mosquitoes.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The products containing DEET currently are available to the public in the form of variety of liquids, lotions, sprays, and impregnated materials (e.g., wrist bands). The formulations registered for direct application to human skin contain DEET from 4 to 100%.<br>
DEET is basically designed for direct application to human skin to repel insects, rather than kill them.<br>
In  accordance  with  the  present  invention,  the  process  comprises the<br>
following steps:<br>
1) Scouring process: For cleaning and rinsing purpose, the scouring process is carried out to prepare the surface of the fabric to absorb the chemical as much as possible. Load the goods in the Jet machine at ambient temperature along with 3% of caustic soda (NaOH) and non-ionic soap added to machine. The temperature inside the machine is then raised by 3°C per minute up to temperature between 75 - 85°C. This temperature is then maintained for about 30 minutes. The Mangle pressure is maintained about 2 kg.<br>
After 30 minutes allow the aqueous solution to cool. Then the hot wash and cold wash process is carried out with normal water. After hot wash and cold wash, 2% of Oxalic acid and 2% of Hydrochloric acid is added to the solution. The temperature is again increased to about 80°C (with a raise of 3°C per minute) and then the temperature is maintained for about 30 minutes. After 30 minutes allow the aqueous solution to cool. Again the hot wash and cold wash process is carried out with normal water.<br>
2) Dyeing process: In dyeing process, 1% of acetic acid is added in the Jet Machine and the temperature from the ambient temperature is raised by 2°C per minute up to a temperature between 90 - 110°C. This temperature is maintained for 30 minutes. After 30 minutes<br>
8<br><br>
allow the aqueous solution to cool. Again the hot wash and cold wash process is carried out with normal water.<br>
3)	Drying process: The fabric is first passed through two tanks (two<br>
deep and two nip), on a stentor machine. The first tank is filled with<br>
only water and the second tank is filled with 0.3% of acetic acid. The<br>
fabric to be treated is passed over two sets of rolls - one is a top roll<br>
for which the mangle pressure is 4 kg and second is a bottom roll for<br>
which the mangle pressure is 3kg.<br>
Typically, the fabric is passed through 5 chambers of the drying tank. The temperature in the 5 chambers is maintained at different degrees.<br>
1st chamber temperature - 90 °C to 200 °C 2nd chamber temperature - 90 °C to 200 °C 3rd chamber temperature - 90 °C to 200 °C 4th chamber temperature - 90 °C to 200 °C 5th chamber temperature - 90 °C to 200 °C<br>
The speed of stentor machine during drying process is kept at 10 to 70 meters per minute.<br>
4)	Finishing process: For finishing process, the fabric is passed through<br>
two tanks (two deep and two nip). Both the tanks are filled with a<br>
chemical N, N'-diethyl-m-toluamide (DEET). The pH valve of the<br>
solution in the stentor machine is adjusted to 4 - 5 by adding acetic<br>
acid to it. The fabric is passed over two sets of rolls - one is a top roll<br>
for which the mangle pressure is 5 kg and second is a bottom roll for<br>
which the mangle pressure is 4 kg.<br>
The fabric is then passed through 5 chambers. The temperature of the 5 chambers is maintained at different degrees.<br>
1st chamber temperature - 90 °C to 200 °C 2nd chamber temperature - 90 °C to 200 °C<br>
9<br><br>
3rd chamber temperature - 90 °C to 200 °C 4th chamber temperature - 90 °C to 200 °C 5th chamber temperature - 90 °C to 200 °C<br>
During the finishing process, the speed of stentor machine is kept at 10 to 70 meters per minute.<br>
The preliminary tests done on the fabric, show that the fabric with the chemical added in it does not cause any allergy or otherwise adverse reaction or irritation on the skin. Further, the test showed that there were no adverse effects following the use of fabric treated with the insect repellent chemical containing DEET in children and pregnant or breastfeeding women.<br>
It has also been found in preliminary tests that the fabric does not lose its texture or feel and can be printed or worked over. It was also proved that the chemical does not have any odour discernible by the human olfactory system.<br>
Further, the preliminary tests showed that the insect repellent chemical compound and the mosquito repellent property of the fabric are retained in the fabric for more than 15 washes.<br>

Step II: Dyeing the prepared fabric with acetic solution in the Jet machine heated from 25 degrees C to 90 - 110 degrees C at the rate of 2 degrees per minute and maintained at 85 degrees C for 30 minutes, passing the fabric through hot wash and cold wash with water to dyed fabric; <br>
Step III: Drying the dyed fabric with acetic acid solution in the stentor machine passing over two sets of rolls- top roll with mangle pressure of 4 kg and bottom roll with mangle pressure of 3 kg, passing through 5 chambers maintained at 150 °C, 160 °C, 165 °C, 150 °C, 175 °C, at the speed of 40 meters per minute;<br>
Step IV : Finishing the dried fabric with N, N-diethyl m-toluamide (DEET) solution in the stentor machine through two tanks, pH of solution adjusted between 4 to 5 with acetic acid, passing over two sets of rolls- top roll with mangle pressure of 5 kg and bottom roll with mangle pressure of 4 kg, passing through 5 chambers maintained at 160 °C, 165 °C, 170 °C, 175 °C, 180 °C, at the speed of 35 meters per minute.<br>
The ingredients used in the present invention and in example 2 to 4 were the same. However, instead of using the composition as in example 1 of the invention, lower quantities were tried out. Severe problems were encountered at the time of impregnation of the batch. No impregnation could therefore be formed and hence, no or unsatisfactory insect repellency was obtained.<br>
14<br><br>
Again, fabrics were tried to be made using DEET less than 35 %, and Acetic acid less than 10 % using different permutations and combinations not within the range. In all cases, either no stable fabric could be made or the insect repellency was unsatisfactory.<br>
Yet again fabric were tried out keeping the same parameter but adding DEET either alone or in combination with Acetic acid within the ranges disclosed in the specification and the fabrics were found to be satisfactory.<br>
The insect-repellent compositions of the present invention were found to afford the wearer complete protection under most types of weather and infestation conditions. Furthermore, the insect-repellency effectiveness of the fabric substrate treatment was found to span up to a period of about several hours to at least several weeks.<br>
To test the stability of the fabric treatment, garments were produced from treated fabric. Fabric substrates which were laundered from ten to fifty launderings continue to exhibit insect-repellent properties. It is to be noted that typically the industry standard number of washings for apparel is three, five, or ten for consumer apparel and fifty washings for military or certain specialty requirements such as, for example, flame retardancy.<br>
To test the effectiveness of the treatment, laboratory size knit and woven fabric samples were processed using the compositions described above. A first batch of the samples was tested for direct insect repellency using fire ants and Aedes mosquito as test insects. For several hours the fire ants and Aedes mosquito were directly repelled by the fabric samples. A second batch of the fabric samples were tested by wearers who wore garments made from the fabric sample. Mosquitoes and blackflies were repelled for at least eleven hours during a field trip.<br>
A production trial was initiated on four fabric substrates, knit and woven cotton, poly/cotton and poly/nylon. The fabrics were dyed with the insect-repellent composition applied during dyeing and/or resin finishing. Another group of knitted and woven fabrics were dyed, printed and resin finished<br>
15<br><br>
with the insect-repellent composition applied at the dyeing, printing and resin finishing steps.<br>
Garments such as shirts, hats, and the like were produced from the treated fabric substrates. The garments were tested under conditions encountered during outdoor activities. The garments were found to repel insects under outdoor conditions during activities such as hiking, hunting, and fishing in coastal, swamp and mountain conditions during day and night wear. The treated garments were compared to untreated counterparts under the same conditions. In one particular field trial, garments were tested on mosquitoes. When the mosquitoes landed on the treated fabric at any location on the garment, they would only remain for about four to about six seconds before taking off.<br>
This present invention and many of its attendant advantages will be understood from the foregoing description, and it will be apparent that various modifications and changes can be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the present invention or sacrificing all of its material advantages, the process hereinbefore described being merely preferred embodiments.<br>
For example, the insect-repellent composition of the present invention can incorporate different insect control agents such as, for example, alkylamines and alkylneodecamines. Additionally, the insect-repellent composition may be applied on a wide range of fabric substrates including textile blends, woven and non-woven, knits, fibers, leather and synthetic adaptations of leather, flocked-fabrics.<br>
The present invention may be embodied in other specific forms without departing from its spirit or essential attributes. Accordingly, reference should be made to the appended claims, rather than the foregoing specification, as indicating the scope of the present invention.<br>
This shows that without the precise application of the precise combination and the technique provided and disclosed in the specification, the invention<br>
16<br><br>
cannot be worked out by one skilled in the art. The invention is therefore, not a mere admixture of known ingredients to obtain a predictable profile.<br>
Thus it is apparent that there has been provided, in accordance with the invention, a process that fully satisfies the objects, aims, and advantages set forth above. While the invention has been described in conjunction with specific embodiments thereof, it is evident that: many alternatives, modifications, and variations will be apparent to those skilled in the art in light of the foregoing description. Accordingly, it is intended to embrace all such alternatives, modifications, and variations as fall within the spirit and broad scope of the appended claims.<br>
