Field of the application<br>
The present application relates to a data unit processing entity in<br>
a data unit transmission network and to a control method for such a<br>
data unit processing entity.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
In the field of data communication, it is known to provide data unit<br>
transmission networks. Data that needs to be transported over such a<br>
data unit transmission network is divided into individual data<br>
units, and each data unit carries a routing address that is used by<br>
network nodes for sending the data unit to its intended destination.<br>
The handling of such data units is typically performed in accordance<br>
with an appropriate protocol, e.g. the Internet Protocol (IP). It is<br>
noted that such data units may carry different names in the context<br>
of different protocols, such as packet, protocol data unit, segment,<br>
frame, etc. In the present description and claims, the term "data<br>
unit" is used generically to describe any such fragment of data that<br>
is being transported over an appropriate network.<br>
If all network nodes of a data unit transmission network are<br>
immobile and are always connected to the overall network via the<br>
same links, then there is no problem in routing data units to<br>
intended receiving nodes, because the routing address serves both to<br>
identify and to locate the receiving node. However, the situation<br>
becomes more complicated if at least some nodes that can access the<br>
data unit transmission network over more than one link. For example,<br>
a node could be capable of moving and of accessing the network over<br>
various links depending on location. Such a node capable of<br>
accessing the network over more than one link will therefore be<br>
referred to as a mobile node in the present description and claims.<br>
However, it is to be noted that the term "mobile node" relates to<br>
any node capable of accessing the network over more than one link,<br>
regardless of whether the node is in fact physically mobile. In<br>
other words, the term "mobile node" also covers nodes that are<br>
neither physical mobile nor moving, as long as they are capable of<br>
accessing via more than one link. As an example, a mobile node could<br>
therefore be a stationary computer that is equipped with a wire line<br><br>
LAN connection, a wireless LAN capability and a GPRS radio<br>
capability, such that it could access a network (e.g. the Internet)<br>
over these three different links.<br>
The situation of nodes that can access a network over more than one<br>
link requires additional routing capabilities.<br>
In connection with work on expanding the capabilities of the<br>
Internet protocol, request for comments 3220 that relates to version<br>
4 of the Internet Protocol (IPv4) describes the use of two types of<br>
routing addresses, a so-called home address for identifying a node<br>
and a so-called care-of address for forwarding of data units to<br>
mobile nodes. The home address (HoA) is an example of the general<br>
concept of an identifying address (IA), and the care-of address<br>
(CoA) is an example of the general concept of a forwarding address<br>
(FA) .<br>
The term "mobile node" therefore refers to such that nodes that can<br>
have a plurality of forwarding addresses simultaneously.<br>
In a generalised network operating in accordance with an appropriate<br>
routing protocol (RP) , the network nodes are arranged to distinguish<br>
between the IAs and the FAs in a data unit to be forwarded. It is<br>
noted that the term "routing protocol" (RP) as used in the present<br>
description and claims is generic to describe any protocol suitable<br>
for allowing the routing of data units over a plurality of network<br>
nodes. IP is an example of such a general routing protocol.<br>
In a data unit transmission network that uses identifying addresses<br>
and forwarding addresses, one may provide special data unit<br>
processing entities or agents that perform a decision operation for<br>
determining a forwarding address on the basis of an identification<br>
address. It is noted that the term "entity" or "agent" as used in<br>
the present specification and claims refers to a functional element<br>
that is capable of performing a certain function. An entity or<br>
element may be located in a single place, e.g. in a node, but it can<br>
also be distributed over several locations, e.g. several nodes or<br>
other network elements.<br><br>
The data unit processing entity of this type comprises a decision<br>
part for setting a forwarding address in a received data unit<br>
depending on the identification address set in the received data<br>
unit, by accessing a memory that contains decision data, where the<br>
decision data comprises one or more forwarding addresses associated<br>
with identification address. As an example, in the present proposals<br>
for developing IP, i.e. for version 6 (IPv6), the use of a so-called<br>
home agent is proposed. A home agent receives data units that<br>
contain the home address (i.e. the identifying address), and on the<br>
basis of rules and parameters stored in a so-called binding cache<br>
performs a so-called binding operation, i.e. determines the care-of<br>
address for the given home address. In the present discussion of<br>
further developing IP networks using mobile nodes, i.e. in the<br>
discussion for Mobile Ipv6 (MIPv6), it is considered that the mobile<br>
node can have multiple care-of addresses. It can re-route between<br>
different care-of addresses by indicating to appropriate agents in<br>
the network which care-of address to use.<br>
The method of managing the decision data is performed by letting the<br>
mobile node send so-called binding updates to the home agent or to<br>
the so-called corresponding nodes. A corresponding node is a node<br>
with which the mobile node is in communication, and in the course of<br>
this communication, the mobile node can simply indicate to the<br>
corresponding node, which care-of address to use. The basic<br>
principle is that the home agent and corresponding nodes can only<br>
have one care-of address listed in the binding cache. It is the<br>
mobile node that decides to which care-of address data is directed<br>
that is destined for the home address (via the home agent) , and it<br>
can determine for each corresponding node to which care-of address<br>
the corresponding node should send. The principle therefore is that<br>
each home agent or corresponding node only has one of the possible<br>
care-of addresses indicated in its binding cache.<br>
In connection with mobile Ipv6 a system called N0MADv6 has been<br>
proposed, which comprises filters for mobile Ipv6 bindings. NOMAD<br>
allows a mobile node that has a plurality of care-of addresses to<br>
register multiple binding updates at any appropriate binding agent<br>
(e.g. home agent, correspondent node or a so-called mobility anchor<br>
point) and associate these different bindings with a filter. The<br><br>
filter allows to direct different flows to different care-of<br>
addresses based on the Traffic Class field in the IPv6 header, the<br>
Flow Label field in the IPv6 header, the Protocol Extension field in<br>
the IPv6 header, which identifies the type of higher layer protocol<br>
being used, the Source Address (or source address prefix), a range<br>
of Source Port or Destination Port numbers in the protocol header,<br>
or the value of a certain data region within the IPv6 packet.<br>
A further concept known in connection with mobile IPv6 is the use of<br>
bicasting, i.e. of allowing a home agent to temporarily have<br>
bindings to two care-of addresses for the same home address. While<br>
such bindings are simultaneously active, every packet is replicated<br>
and a copy is sent to each care-of address.<br>
WO 03/047183 describes a system operating according to the mobile<br>
Ipv6 architecture comprising a mobile node that has an associated<br>
home agent for conducting communication with a correspondent node<br>
over an IP network. This document is concerned with the problem that<br>
generic IP networks do not specifically support the selection of<br>
unidirectional links. The document proposes to provide detection of<br>
a unidirectional interface in the mobile node, and to then transmit<br>
to the home agent a binding update indicating a care-of address that<br>
identifies the detected unidirectional interface, such that packets<br>
can then be routed via the unidirectional interface.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is to further improve the capabilities<br>
of a system that uses identifying addresses and forwarding<br>
addresses.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The object is achieved by a data unit processing entity as described<br>
in claim 1 and a method of controlling a data unit processing entity<br>
as described in claim 8. Advantageous embodiments are described in<br>
the dependent claims.<br><br>
In accordance with the present invention, the data unit processing<br>
entity contains a management part that provides a network control<br>
function with access to the decision data memory independently of<br>
any access provided to one or more mobile nodes. Typically, the<br>
management part will also provide an interface to the decision data<br>
for mobile nodes, but this is not necessary. In other words, the<br>
decision data that is used by a decision part of the data unit<br>
processing entity for selecting a forwarding address on the basis of<br>
an identifying address contained in a data unit, can be changed by a<br>
network control function independently of the changes that may be<br>
performed by or at the request of any mobile nodes.<br>
This concept provides great advantages. It allows the combination of<br>
mobility management at the level of the routing protocol (RP) of the<br>
data unit transmission network with network control operations that<br>
take into account parameters and requirements used in the overall<br>
network management. For example, if the mobile nodes connect to the<br>
data unit transmission network over a variety of radio links, then<br>
the management of radio links can be brought into association with<br>
the mobility management performed by the data unit processing entity<br>
that determines a forwarding address on the basis of an identifying<br>
address. In other words, aspects of radio link management, such as<br>
utilization, over-loading, congestion etc. can be taken into account<br>
by a network control function that in turn has access to the<br>
decision data memory of the data unit processing entity, in order to<br>
appropriately update the decision data. For example, it is possible<br>
that while a mobile node has indicated to the data unit processing<br>
entity that it wishes to receive data units over a forwarding<br>
address that is associated with one radio link of a plurality of<br>
available radio links, the network control function may override<br>
that request by writing a different forwarding address into the<br>
decision data, e.g. because the radio link associated with the<br>
forwarding address selected by the mobile node is over-loaded while<br>
another available radio link is under-utilized. With the concept of<br>
the present invention, it is especially possible to perform a<br>
network controlled handover procedure for a given mobile node, i.e.<br>
a handover procedure in which the network initiates the handover<br>
and/or decides on the initial and final communication links.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the management<br>
part provides independent access to the decision data for a<br>
plurality of control functions. This has the particular advantage of<br>
a decentralized control over the management of the decision data,<br>
and consequently over the decision procedure itself. All of the<br>
various control functions have at least partial access to the<br>
decision data, such that each of the control functions is involved<br>
in the control process for setting forwarding addresses. This<br>
provides great flexibility and many new degrees of freedom in<br>
overall data unit handling in comparison with a centralized system<br>
like in the prior art, in which only one control function controls<br>
the decision data.<br>

Detailed description of embodiments<br>
In the following description and detailed embodiments, reference<br>
will sometimes be made to the Internet Protocol (IP) and presently<br>
discussed modifications thereof, such as IP version 6 (IPv6) and<br>
Mobile IPv6 (MIPv6). The Internet Protocol and its modifications are<br>
a preferred application of the concepts of the present invention,<br>
but the present invention is by no means restricted to IP or its<br>
modifications, or even to network layer protocols in general. Much<br>
rather, the present invention can be applied in the context of any<br>
data unit transmission network that uses identifying addresses and<br>
forwarding addresses. For example, the invention can also be applied<br>
in the context of MPLS (Multi Protocol Label Switching), which is a<br>
protocol situated below IP, i.e. below the network layer, but in<br>
effect above the link layer.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a schematic representation of a data unit transmission<br>
network 10 that comprises network nodes 101-112. Among these network<br>
nodes there are routing nodes 101-109, which are arranged to route<br>
data units over the data unit transmission network 10 in accordance<br>
with an appropriate routing protocol that will generically be<br>
abbreviated as RP. As indicated above, the routing protocol RP may<br>
be any appropriate network layer protocol, such as IP or a<br>
modification of IP, but may also be a routing protocol that is<br>
situated at a different layer, such as MPLS.<br>
The network 10 furthermore comprises end nodes 110, 111 and 112,<br>
i.e. nodes that are terminals of the network. Nodes 110 and 111 are<br>
mobile nodes, which communicate with appropriate access nodes 106,<br>
108 or 109 in wireless fashion. On the other hand, end node 112 is a<br>
fixed node that is fixedly connected to node 107, e.g. by one fixed<br>
wire-line link. It is again noted that the present invention is not<br>
restricted to any specific type of mobile node. As such, the mobile<br><br>
nodes can access the data unit transmission network in any way<br>
suitable for communication over a plurality of access links, e.g.<br>
radio, infrared or even by (possibly movable) wire-line connections.<br>
For example, it is possible that a mobile node can access the data<br>
unit transmission network over a first type mobile phone connection<br>
(e.g. via GSM), a second type mobile phone connection (e.g. via<br>
UMTS) and a wireless local area network (W-LAN) . Each of these<br>
different access possibilities is then associated with its own<br>
forwarding address, although the mobile node only has one<br>
identifying address. Typically, the individual forwarding addresses<br>
will also be associated with their own access node, e.g. when<br>
considering the example of Fig. 1, network node 108 will handle data<br>
units carrying a first forwarding address for mobile node 111, while<br>
access node 106 will handle data units carrying a different<br>
forwarding address for mobile node 111.<br>
The network nodes 101-112 are capable of distinguishing between an<br>
identifying address IA and a forwarding address FA in data units<br>
that are being transmitted over network 10. This can be achieved in<br>
any suitable or desirable way, e.g. by providing for a specific<br>
structure of the data units, such that the identifying address and<br>
the forwarding address are to be found at respectively designated<br>
fields of the data units. This shall be explained with the examples<br>
of Figs. 2 and 3.<br>
Fig. 2 schematically shows a data unit 20 that consists of a basic<br>
data unit 21 that has its own header 23. For example, this basic<br>
data unit 21 can be a standard IP packet, where header 23 contains a<br>
field 24 for the standard IP address. In this case, the standard IP<br>
address is the identifying address. In accordance with the routing<br>
protocol RP employed, an additional header 22 can be added, which<br>
comprises a designated field 25 for a forwarding address.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a different scheme	where a data	unit 30	has a single<br>
header 31, which comprises a	first field	32 for	holding the<br>
identifying address IA and a	second field	33 for	holding the<br>
forwarding address FA.<br><br>
In any case, the network nodes 101-112 are capable of appropriately<br>
reading the data units and identifying the respective addresses.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a schematic representation of an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. Reference numeral 4 relates to the data unit<br>
processing entity, which comprises a decision part 41, a decision<br>
data memory 42 and a management part 43. The decision part 41 is<br>
arranged to set a forwarding address FA in a received data unit that<br>
is to be forwarded. The operation of the decision part 41 depends on<br>
the identifying address set in the received data unit that is to be<br>
forwarded, and on the decision data stored in association with the<br>
given identifying address in the decision data memory 42. The<br>
decision data comprises one or more forwarding addresses FA, which<br>
the decision part may select.<br>
The management part 43 is arranged to provide an interface to the<br>
decision data memory 42 for modifying the decision data stored<br>
therein. The interface is arranged to provide one or more mobile<br>
nodes access to the decision data memory 42 for updating the<br>
decision data. In the example of Fig. 4, reference numeral 47<br>
represents a mobile node, which comprises a control function 50<br>
capable of communicating with the management part 43, in order to<br>
modify the decision data stored in decision data memory 42. For<br>
example, the control function 50 can send update requests to the<br>
management part 43 indicating that the mobile node 47 would like to<br>
change from a forwarding address FA1 that is associated with radio<br>
link 52 to a different forwarding address FA2 that is associated<br>
with radio link 53. In the example of Fig. 4, reference numeral 45<br>
relates to a first access node that mobile node 47 may employ and<br>
reference numeral 4 6 to a second access node that mobile node 47 may<br>
employ. Reference numeral 44 is a given node that sends RP data<br>
units to mobile node 47. For example, it can be a correspondent node<br>
in accordance with IPv6. The data unit processing entity 4 is an<br>
appropriate agent for identifying and inserting forwarding<br>
addresses. As such, it can be associated with a given node, such as<br>
the node 44, or it can be located at a specific node associated with<br>
the mobile node 47, i.e. as a type of home agent at the node that<br>
receives data units that only carry the identifying address IA of<br>
mobile node 47, such that these data units may receive a forwarding<br><br>
address FA that allows routing of the data units to the intended<br>
destination, i.e. mobile node 47.<br>
Equally, the data unit processing entity 4 may be provided at a<br>
designated node of the network, i.e. a type of mobility anchor<br>
point, that is designated to handle data units that lack a<br>
forwarding address.<br>
In the example of Fig. 4, the entities communicate at the level of<br>
the routing protocol RP, i.e. are peers of this protocol. As<br>
indicated, the access nodes 45 and 46 are also peers, but the<br>
underlying link protocol LP is different for the two different types<br>
of mobile access. For example, the link 52 can be governed by a link<br>
layer protocol for a mobile phone connection (e.g. for GSM, GPRS or<br>
UMTS), while link 43 may be governed by a link protocol for W-LAN.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the management part 43<br>
furthermore provides an interface for a network control function 51,<br>
such that the network control function 51 can access the decision<br>
data in decision data memory 42 independently of any access provided<br>
to one or more mobile nodes, such as mobile node 47.<br>
Function 51 can be any type of network control function, e.g. a<br>
radio resource management function for radio links. For this<br>
purpose, the network control function 51 can communicate with radio<br>
control functions 48, 49 that are respectively associated with radio<br>
links 52 and 53. In this way, the network control function 51 can<br>
e.g. be a multi-radio resource management (MRRM) function.<br>
Such an arrangement has the particular advantage that a coordinating<br>
management of radio resources for different access technologies can<br>
be combined with the mobility management at the level of the routing<br>
protocol RP. It is noted that one of the decisive aspects of the<br>
basic routing at the level of the routing protocol RP is that it is<br>
independent of any particular underlying access technology.<br>
In Fig. 4. the connections between the network control function 51<br>
and the management part 43 is shown as a dotted line, just like the<br>
connections between the control functions 48, 49 and the network<br><br>
control function 51. The connections among the control functions and<br>
between a control function and the management part can be provided<br>
in any suitable or desirable way. In other words, they may make use<br>
of data units that adhere to the routing protocol RP, or the<br>
connections can be via separate, dedicated control signalling<br>
connections. In this way, the network control function 51 may be<br>
provided in one or more of the network nodes, or can be provided<br>
separately from the network nodes in a dedicated control<br>
architecture.<br>
It is noted that although the control functions 48 and 49 shown in<br>
Fig. 4 communicate with the network control function 51, which in<br>
turn may access the decision data memory 42 via the interface of the<br>
management part 43, it is equally possible that the control<br>
functions 48, 49 directly communicate with the management part 43.<br>
This is shown in the embodiment of Fig. 8, which uses the same<br>
reference numerals as Fig. 4, such that a repeated description of<br>
the corresponding elements is not necessary.<br>
In the example of Fig. 8, the control functions 48, 49, 50 and 51<br>
each have independent access to the decision data. Therefore, each<br>
is involved in the decision procedure for determining forwarding<br>
addresses on the basis of an identifying address. This leads to a<br>
highly flexible decentralized control structure for the management<br>
of the forwarding addresses at the level of the RP.<br>
In general, the data unit processing entity of the present invention<br>
is such that the interface provided by the managing part 43 provides<br>
a plurality of control functions with access to the decision data<br>
memory 42. One or more of this plurality of control functions may be<br>
located in one of the mobile nodes, such as the control function 50<br>
located in mobile node 47.<br>
Fig. 5 shows an example of a decision procedure setting a forwarding<br>
address in a received data unit that is to be forwarded. In step<br>
S51, the identifying address IA is read in the received data unit.<br>
Then, in step S52, the decision procedure looks into the decision<br>
data memory 42, in order to retrieve the decision data associated<br>
with the identifying address IA. The retrieved decision data is then<br><br>
It is noted that the decision data may have any suitable or<br>
desirable form. Preferably, the decision data comprises decision<br>
rules and decision parameters. These decision rules and decision<br>
parameters can be stored in association with an identifying address,<br>
e.g. in the form of tables referenced via the identifying address<br>
IA.<br>
The decision rules can e.g. have a simple "if-then" form, such as<br>
"if the higher layer protocol is X, then select forwarding address<br>
FA 1" and "if higher layer protocol is Y, then select forwarding<br>
address FA 2". For example, X may stand for UDP and Y for TCP.<br>
Decision parameters can be values to which rules refer, such as "if<br>
data unit size is below parameter Z, then select forwarding address<br>
FA 1, else FA 2", where "parameter Z" is a variable that refers to a<br>
value stored in the decision data memory, and the management part 43<br>
may allow the external control functions to update this parameter.<br>
Another example for rules is that they depend on such parameters as<br>
the data rate or delay along a given link, such as "if delay exceeds<br>
Th on link with FA 2, then set select forwarding address FA 3",<br>
where "delay" is provided by a control function associated with the<br>
FA 2 link, and Th is an adjustable threshold parameter.<br>
The rules may also be more sophisticated, e.g. depend on one or more<br>
predetermined cost functions. A rule could then e.g. be "Set<br>
forwarding address such that Cost_function_A is minimum", where<br>
Cost_function_A is a predetermined cost function. The cost functions<br>
may evaluate "cost" in terms of one or more of monetary value,<br>
energy, network load, delay, throughput, data rate, quality of<br>
service (QoS), or any other suitable or desirable measure. Such<br>
measures may specifically be associated with link resources, and<br>
relate to time slots, codes, frequencies, carriers, transmission<br>
power, etc.<br>
Rules may also depend on user behaviour, for example on the mobility<br>
behaviour of the user of a mobile node that is moving. If it is e.g.<br>
determined that a user is moving quickly or consistently, as<br><br>
measured by an appropriate parameter, then a rule could be present<br>
for avoiding the setting to a forwarding address that would require<br>
an expected handover very soon, e.g. a forwarding address associated<br>
with a micro-cell from which it can be expected that a fast moving<br>
user will soon exit. In other words, "if motion_parameter exceeds<br>
Th_m, then do not set FA 4", where motion_parameter represents a<br>
parameter that indicates the user's degree of motion, and Th_m is an<br>
adjustable threshold.<br>
The access to the decision data memory may be such that only<br>
parameters can be updated, or only rules, but it is preferable that<br>
the access is such that both rules and parameters may be changed.<br>
For example, in the context of the example of Fig. 8, access could<br>
be such that the control functions 48, 49 only access and change<br>
parameters (such as e.g. delay and data rate values associated with<br>
their links), whereas control function 51 only accesses and amends<br>
rules. Control function 50 could in turn be allowed to access all<br>
rules, parameters that relate to the mobile node, but not parameters<br>
that e.g. relate to links 52, 53. This example provides the<br>
advantage of a control scheme in which the possibly very different<br>
time scales of different control functions are very simply<br>
integrated. Namely, the control functions 48, 49 will typically send<br>
update requests much more often than the mobile node, due to the<br>
possibly rapidly changing circumstances at these links. Nonetheless,<br>
this does not lead to any problems.<br>
In summary, one or more of the multiple control functions with which<br>
management part 43 communicates, are network resource management<br>
functions, e.g. for managing radio resources.<br>
Figs. 6 and 7 show examples of management procedures for changing<br>
the decision data in the decision data memory 42. In Fig. 6, the<br>
procedure begins with step S61, in which it is determined whether an<br>
update request (UR) has been received from a mobile node (MN) . Such<br>
an update request may originate from any of the control functions<br>
capable of communicating with the management part 43. If yes, then<br>
step S62 processes the update request, i.e. the updates requested<br>
are performed, e.g. one or more rules and one or more parameters are<br>
changed. The procedure then continues to step S63, in which it is<br><br>
determined whether an update request has been received from the<br>
network control function (NCF) 51. If yes, then this update request<br>
is processed in step S64. The procedure then continues to step S65,<br>
in order to either loop back to the beginning or to end.<br>
As can be seen in the example of Fig. 6, the update requests for the<br>
decision data that are received from the mobile node (e.g. from the<br>
control function 50 at the mobile node) and from the networks<br>
control function 51 are handled independently of one another.<br>
In the simple example shown in Fig. 6, both the mobile node and the<br>
network control function have full access, i.e. can update any rule<br>
or any parameter. However, it is also possible that the management<br>
part 43 restricts the access of one or both of the network control<br>
function and the mobile node. For example, it is possible that the<br>
network control function 51 receives full access, while the mobile<br>
node only receives access to certain parameters and/or certain<br>
rules. For example, the mobile node's access may be restricted to<br>
parameters that indicate user preferences and rules for "soft"<br>
decisions, but the mobile node does not receive any access to rules<br>
for "hard" decisions (such as mandatory handover decisions).<br>
It is also possible that the access provided to different control<br>
functions receives different priorities. An example of this is shown<br>
in Fig. 7. The procedure of Fig. 7 starts with step S71, in which it<br>
is determined whether an update request has been received from the<br>
network control function 51. If this is the case, then the update<br>
request is processed in step S72. Subsequent to step S72, a timer is<br>
reset in step S73. The procedure then goes to step S74, in which it<br>
is determined whether an update request has been received from a<br>
mobile node. If this is the case, then step S75 determines whether<br>
the timer has expired or not. Only if the timer has expired will the<br>
procedure proceed to step S76, in which the update request from the<br>
mobile node is processed. Otherwise, step S76 is skipped. The<br>
procedure then continues to step S77, in order to either loop back<br>
to the beginning or to terminate.<br>
Due to the use of the timer, the priority of the procedure is to<br>
process update request from the network control function 51, whereas<br><br>
update request from the mobile node (e.g. from the control function<br>
50 of the mobile node) are only processed if sufficient time has<br>
passed since receiving the last update request from the network<br>
control function 51.<br>
It is noted that the examples given in Figs. 6 and 7 use update<br>
requests as an interface for accessing the decision data memory.<br>
However, the invention is by no means restricted to such a<br>
technique, as the interface may be provided in any suitable or<br>
desirable way.<br>
It is furthermore noted that the update requests received from the<br>
network control function 51 will typically be more frequent than<br>
those received from the mobile node. This again underscores the<br>
aspect of independent access, and indicates one of the important<br>
advantages of the invention. Namely, by providing a plurality of<br>
independent control functions with access to the decision data<br>
memory, a highly flexible management of the decision data can be<br>
performed, e.g. in accordance with the possibly very different time<br>
scales relevant for the individual control functions. It is also<br>
pointed out that the access to the decision data memory 42 by the<br>
two control functions 51 and 50 as shown in Fig. 4 is only an<br>
example, and any number of control functions may have independent<br>
access to the decision data via the management part 43.<br>
The decision part 41 and the decision procedure S51-S53 act<br>
dynamically to select a forwarding address FA from the decision data<br>
stored in decision data memory 42. Preferably, this dynamic<br>
selection is such that it is performed for each individual data unit<br>
to be forwarded. In other words, the decision procedure preferably<br>
does not operate for a group or block of data units at a time, but<br>
is performed individually for each received data unit that it is to<br>
be forwarded.<br>
Although the present invention has been described by way of<br>
preferred examples, these only serve to convey to the skilled person<br>
a more complete understanding of the invention, but are by no means<br>
intended to be limiting. The invention is defined by the appended<br><br>
claims, where the reference numerals only serve to make the claims<br>
readable, but have no limiting effect.<br><br>
