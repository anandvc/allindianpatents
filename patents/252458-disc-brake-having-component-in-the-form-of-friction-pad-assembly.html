				<td>The present invention relates to a disc brake having a component in the form of a friction pad assembly.<br><br>
This invention relates to a disc brake having a friction pad assembly primarily for a motor vehicle and the subject matter of this invention is divided out of Co. pending application No.244/MAS/93.<br><br>
In the Co. pending application No.244/MAS/93 there is described an invention for a component such as a friction pad assembly or force distribution member for such assembly.<br><br>
The disc brake of the invention is of the general kind in which a pair of pad assemblies each including a backing plate and a layer of friction material on a surface thereof are mounted in the brake at either side of a rotatable disc and fluid and/or mechanically-operated actuator means are operable to urge the pad, assemblies into braking engagement with the disc when the brake is actuated. The brake may incorporate a force distribution member or spreader between the actuator means and at least one of the pad assemblies and this may constitute an alternative or additional form of the aforesaid component.<br><br>
In a brake of the aforesaid kind each friction pad assembly is supported in the brake at the outer edges of the backplate and it is common to employ a spring or springs which react against a pair; of the brake and bias the pad assemblies downwardly against guide surfaces in order to minimize operational noise. This creates frictional <br>
s si stance to movement of the friction pad assemblies into and out cf engagement with the disc and, whilst this can be acceptable in relatively small brakes, such as those used on cars, the friction levels in larges ccmmercial vehicle brakes can become intolerable because of the inevitably larger canponents and consequently larger springs employed. In order to relieve the frictional forces, it has been proposed to bias the friction pad assemblies upwardly away from the adjacent guide surface(s) by placing separate springs beneath the pad assemblies. Wlfilst these can achieve the desired effect, they are unsatisfactory in that, being separate components, they can be inadvertently emitted during original assembly, or after servicing of the brake. Moreover, because the springs degrade in use and become less effective, it is desirable to fit new springs when the friction pad assemblies are replaced or serviced and this cannot be guaranteed when the springs are supplied as separate canponents. It can also be desirable to load the aforesaid force distribution member in a given direction in the brake.<br><br>
An object of the inventiai is to provide a disc brake having component, such as a friction pad assembly, in which v a biasing spring is incorporated irr a simple and inexpensive manner as a normally inseparatble component.<br><br>
According to the invention, the disc brake component is provided with a component which comprises a rigid plate, a spring device, and an abutment on the component engaging a first surface at one side of the spring device, portions of the spring device extending respectively to either side of the abutment and having surfaces opposed to the first surface portion engaging facing surface parts of the component in such a manner as to retain the spring device on the component in a normally inseparable manner prior to installation of the component in a brake.<br><br>
The invention will be understood to include a disc brake incorporating one or more pad assemblies and/or a force distribution member or spreader of the invention arranged with an elongate support means of the brake engaged between said opposed surfaces and the spring stressed against said abutment to bias the pad assembly (ies) or device in a given direction within the brake.<br><br>
The present invention relates to a disc brake having a component in the form of a friction pad assembly or a force distribution member for such •assembly comprising a rigid plate (2A, 5A), an elongate spring device, and an abutment on the component engaging a first surface of the spring device, portions of the spring device extending respectively to either side of the abutment along the component and having surfaces (16A, 16B) opposed to the first surface engaging respective facing surface parts of the component, the spring device being retained on the component in a normally inseparable manner, prior to installation of the component in a brake, by co-action with the abutment and component surface parts.<br><br>
The invention will now be described, by way of	. <br>
example, with reference to the accompanying drawings in which: -<br><br>
Figure 1 is a plan view of a sliding caliper disc brake incorporating a pair of pad assemblies of the invent ion;<br>
Figure 2 is a section along the line 2-2 of Figure 1;<br><br>
Figure 3 is a detail to an enlarged scale of part of the brake of Figures 1 and 2;<br>
Figure 4 is a plan view to an enlarged scale of part of the brake of Figures 1 and 2;<br>
Figure 5 is a detail in plan view of an alternative type of brake component of the invention, and<br>
Figure 6 is a side view of the assembly of Figure 5.<br><br>
The disc brake illustrated in Figure 1 of the drawng is of the sliding caliper type and includes a fixed carrier 1 intended to be secured, as by bolting for example, to a fixed part of a vehicle in the vicinity of a wheel to be braked. The carrier 1 has a directly actuated brake friction pad assembly 2 slidably mounted therein and disposed at one side of a brake disc (not shown), A clamp member 3 is carried by guide pins, one of which can be seen at 4, for sliding movement relative to the carrier. The clamp member moves an indirectly actuated friction pad assembly 5 also mounted in the carrier 1 and disposed at the opposite side of the brake disc from the pad assembly 2. Bach pad assembly includes a backing plate 2A, 5A to one side of each of which is secured a respective layer of friction material 2B, 5B.<br><br>
The pad assemblies are supported at edge portions of the backing plates for sliding movement in the fixed carrier<br>
1	and are retained in the carrier by pins 6 extending through slots 6A in upstanding integral lugs 7 of the backing plates, in conventional manner.<br>
An actuator housing 8 is secured to the clamp member 3, as by bolts for example, and houses an appropriate focm of force transmission means for cooperation with a force input cam actuated by a lever 9 mounted on em actuator shaft 10 and operated by means of an air actuator for example (not shown) which would be mounted on a support bracket 11 secured to the actuator housing. Actuating force is applied to the pad assembly<br>
2	by way of a force distribution member 10A disposed between the backing plate 2A C£ this assembly and the actuator. This serves to distribute the actuating force over a substantial area of the pad assembly. Details of the internal actuator components are not shown since they do not form part of the present invention.<br><br>
Each pad assembly 2, 5 is provided with a pair of springs 12, one of which can be seen in greater detail from Figures 2 to 4. Each spring is in the form of an elongate plate of generally sinusoidal form having a central longitudinal slot 13 (Figure 4) enabling the spring to be placed around one of the lugs 7 of a pad assembly for lateral retention thereon. The term sinusoidal is intended to indicate the generally wavy nature of the blade spring, rather than its strict geanetrical shape and it will be seen that there is sane variation in the width and depth of the individual undulatiens. The lug has an abutment which may be a pin 14 projecting transversely from either side thereof to form spigots, the spring being arranged on the pad assembly with the spigots resting in one of the troughs formed by the sinusoidal shape of the spring. <br><br>
The " abutment may be formed in alternative ways, as, for example, by deforming the material of the backplate, or by the addition of materials, such as by welding, after assembly of the spring on the pad assembly. The adjacent v and remote extremeties 16A, 16B of the spring provide respective convex surfaces which rest on adjacent parts of the upper edge of the backplate 2 A, 5A. Before the pad assembly is installed in the brake, the spring 12 is retained thereon by co-action with the spigots of the pin 14, or other abutment, and the backplate, the effect being to bias the ends 16A, 16B of the spring lightly into engagement with the backplate (as indicated partly in broken lines in Figure 2) resulting in reliable retention of the spring and a stable assembly. Since the spring is difficult to remove, the possibility of the pad being fitted without the spring is substantially precluded. Hie spring may be removed by first extracting the pin 14 and then lifting the spring off the lug 7.<br><br>
Prior to installation of the pad assembly in the brake, the ppring is in the position clearly illustrated in broken lines in Figures 3 with a central through 12A thereof partly intersecting the slot 6A. To instal the pad assembly in the brake, the free end portion 16B of the spring remote from the pin 14 is lifted slightly to permit the insertion of a pad support pin 6 of the brake through the lug 7 and the spring remains in stressed condition when released into contact with the upper surface of the pin, being then in the position illustrated in full lines in Figures 2 and 3 with the end portion 16B spaced from the backplate. The force thus generated is reacted between the spigot 14 and the backplate via the end 16A of the spring, with the result tihat an upward force is exerted on the pad assembly which either removes the lower edge 2C, 5C frcm the adjacent normally supporting surfaces within the carrier, one of which can be seen at 17 in Figure 2, or at least relieves the force between the pad lower edge and surfaces 17, thereby substantially reducing the friction between the pad assembly and caliper, it is to be noted that in this embodiment the spring topically deflects about the spigot 14 through an gngle of about 6.8® from its position in its free state.<br><br>
Assuming the normal rotation of the brake disc to be that indicated by the arrow R in Figure 2, there wo^ld normally be a slight clearance between the forward edge P of the pad assembly 2, 5 and the adjacent surface B of the carrier 1# The metal to metal contact which occurs when this clearance is taken up during braking can lead to an undesirable "clonk" and an additional effect of the spring 12 could be to produce a generally circumfernetial component of force resisting the take-up of this clearance and thereby lessening the severity of the impact between the surfaces P and B with a consequent reduction in, or elimination of noise. It would alternatively be possible to arrange for the spring 12 at one end of the pad assembly to bias the assembly continually so that the surfaces P and B at the other end thereof are maintained in engagement in order to eliminate the aforesaid impact noise.<br><br>
The present invention may be applied to components other than pad assemblies and Figures 5 and 6 illustrate the invention applied to a force distribution member or spreader, an example of which is designated 10A in Figure 1. The spreader 10A is supported in the brake on the vpins 6 in the same manner as the pad assemblies 2, 5 and is provided with a slot 20 at each lateral end region thereof, one such slot and end region being illustrated in Figures 5 and 6, The spreader also has an abutment pin 21 extending across the slot and supported in the opposed side walls 21A of the latter. The spreader carries a pair of sinusoidal springs similar to those described previously, one adjacenet each end region thereof. One of these springs is illustrated in Figures 5 and 6 and designated 22.<br><br>
The main body 22A of each Spring 2 2, is of a width such as to lie comfortably within the slot 2o and enlarged end portions 2 3, 24 bear against the upper surface of the spreader, as illustrated in broken lines in Figures 6, i.e. prior to installation of the spreader in the brake. In this condition, the spring lies under the pin 21 with its end portions 23, 24 engaging the upper surface of the spreader and are stressed between the pin and this surface so as to be retained substantially inseparably on the spreader. When the spreader is installed in the brake, the end portion 2 3 is lifted from its engaged position shown in broken lines to engage the stpring over the pin 6, the spring being thereby stressed so as to lift the spreader in the manner described with reference to the pad assemblies of Figures 2 and 3. The end 23 of the stressed spring remains spaced fran the upper surface of the spreader, as previously.<br><br>
The invention will be seen to provide a component, such as a pad assembly or spreader in which a spring is incorporated in a simple and effective manner to form a substantially inseparable part of the component before the lateer is installed for use in a brake, and in which the spring also acts, with the component installed, to reduce the friction between the component and caliper. It will be understood that the component of the invent ion may be employed not only in a sliding caliper disc brake of the type described and other types, but may also be employed in various types of fixed caliper disc brakes.<br><br>
Although the components shown and described herein are lifted by the action of the springs 12 and 22 when installed in a brake, they may be arranged, particularly in the case of a spreader, to be urged in other directions such as downwardly within the brake.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
