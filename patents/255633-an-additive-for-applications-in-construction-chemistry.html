Additive with applications in construction chemistry<br>
Description<br>
The present invention concerns a new additive for applications in construction<br>
chemistry consisting of a core component A) and a shell component B) applied to<br>
the same<br>
Modern building materials based on inorganic binders such as e g tile adhesives,<br>
plasters, levelling compounds, wall mortars etc must usually have an organic<br>
additive in order to fulfil the requirements made on them In this connection an<br>
average person skilled in the art will know that the type of organic modification has<br>
a greater effect on the most important properties of these formulations for<br>
construction chemicals than the selection and composition of the inorganic base<br>
components Examples of these properties are the water retention capacity or the<br>
stability of tile adhesives and filling compounds as well as the general rheological<br>
profile of such building materials<br>
The so-called modified cellulose ethers play almost the most important role in the<br>
case of such organic modifications whereby this term embraces a large variety of<br>
multiple substance systems Use of such cellulose ethers has enabled numerous<br>
building material properties to be specifically adapted to the respective application<br>
The composition of the said components and their effects on the adhesive tendency<br>
of corresponding building material systems is described in detail in the European<br>
Patent EP 530 768 B1 Combinations of additives are used which consist of water-<br>
soluble cellulose ethers and denvatives thereof, polyacrylamide, alkali or<br>
ammonium salts of cross-linked polyacrylates and polyacrylates that are optionally<br>
additionally grafted with starch which are usually referred to as superabsorbents<br><br>
(SAB), starch ethers' and additives of alkali, alkaline earth or ammonium salts of<br>
condensation products of naphthalenesulfonic acid or phenolsulfonic acid with<br>
formaldehyde or with sulfonic acid-modified polycondensation products of<br>
melamme and formaldehyde may also be suitable. The latter products improve<br>
especially the working properties of building material mixtures containing water by<br>
reducing the adhesive tendency of the building material mixtures containing water<br>
According to EP 530 768 A1 this multicomponent additive contains the starch ether<br>
together with polyacrylamide as a synthetic polymer compound in a blend with<br>
water-soluble mixed substituted cellulose ethers which, in addition to hydroxyethyl<br>
substituents, have 3-alkoxy-2-hydroxypropyl residues with 2 to 6 carbon atoms in<br>
the alkoxy group The selection and use of the water-soluble mixed substituted<br>
cellulose ethers that are blended with the starch ethers and the synthetic polymer<br>
compound is of decisive importance for the intended improvements . In this<br>
connection cellulose ether derivatives can be preferred which, in addition to the<br>
hydroxyethyl substitution, have at least one 3-alkoxy-2-hydroxypropyl residue with<br>
a straight-chain alkoxy residue with 2 to 6 C atoms<br>
DE 39 135 18 Al also teaches the composition of a appropriately modified cellulose<br>
ether systems. In particular it describes the special effect of a particular mixed<br>
substituted cellulose ether variant which has 3-alkoxy-2-hydroxypropyl residues<br>
with 2 to 8 carbon atoms in the alkoxy group in addition to hydroxyethyl<br>
substituents and is used in combination with starch ethers and anionic<br>
polyacrylamides<br>
US 4,487,764 Bl protects a special combination of the common cellulose ethers<br>
with swellable and non-flocculatmg organic polymers which are present in the form<br>
of cross-linked polyacrylates as superabsorbers and should ensure particularly<br>
advantageous working properties.<br><br><br>
Special viscosity-enhancing effects are also known from US 5,432,215 Bl in which<br>
a combination of cellulose ethers and superabsorbers is used in this connection<br>
DE 39 200 25 C2 describes considerable improvements in the working properties of<br>
plaster systems in the machine In particular they should reduce the destruction of<br>
the initially formed paste structure by corresponding shear forces<br>
Recently cellulose ether substitutes based on more suitable polysaccharides or<br>
synthetic and optionally water-swellable sulfogroup-containmg copolymers have<br>
been increasingly used Such compounds are described for example in DE 198 06<br>
482 A1, DE 100 37 629 A1, WO 2005/035603 and DE 10 2004 032 304 6 where<br>
they are used either as a complete or as a partial substitute for the cellulose ethers<br>
that would otherwise be used.<br>
Compositions containing organic components for coating polyacrylamide are known<br>
from both DE 26 12 101 Al and DE 26 07 757 Al However, the said organic<br>
components are not polymers and they also do not exhibit any film formation at all<br>
However, they are suitable for avoiding lump formation Polymers which also<br>
withstand extreme shear conditions and stirring conditions and which can develop a<br>
delayed action are not described in these publications.<br>
In general it may be ascertained that high-quality building materials which also<br>
suffice higher technical requirements can be produced by using the described<br>
additives However, the amount of effort required to further improve the working<br>
properties of such building material systems which contain such additives is<br>
becoming greater and greater Thus the main focus is on the processing of the<br>
finished building material that has already been stirred with the mixing water where<br>
in particular the amount of force required to stir a building material that is available<br>
in a dry form plays an equally important role As the energy required to stir a<br>
building material system becomes less and less, the employees will also become less<br><br><br>
tired and the technical stirring systems will be subject to less wear and their<br>
susceptibility to failure will be reduced<br>
Coated, water-soluble or water-swellable polymer particles are known from WO<br>
92/20727 Crystalline substances such as sodium sulfate or sodium carbonate are<br>
used as a coating material and preferably saturated salt solutions are sprayed in<br>
mixers onto polymer particles. The particles coated in this manner have an<br>
improved dispersing power in aqueous solutions, howevei, the dissolving properties<br>
under difficult conditions is still unsatisfactory In addition the high contents of<br>
coating agent are an undesired weight ballast.<br>
DE 103 16 476 A1 also describes a coated water-soluble polymer in which the<br>
coating contains water glass Polymer particles coated in this manner are claimed to<br>
have excellent dispersing and solubility characteristics which are particularly<br>
beneficial especially under difficult dissolution conditions An agglomeration of the<br>
polymer particles in the aqueous solution is largely suppressed.<br>
In the sense of a further development of the known state of the art, the object of the<br>
present invention was to develop additives for in the widest sense construction<br>
chemical systems, dispersions and paint formulations with the primary aim of<br>
especially improving the incorporation of these additives. These new additives<br>
should above all ensure at least the known good properties of construction chemical<br>
systems and if possible give the systems to which they are added additional positive<br>
properties.<br>
This object was achieved with the aid of an additive for applications in construction<br>
chemistry comprising an organic and/or inorganic core component A) with<br>
rheology-enhancmg properties and a shell component B) applied to the same by<br>
virtue of physical and/or chemical interactions which acts as a coating.<br><br><br>
This additive according to the invention has been surprisingly shown not only to<br>
fulfil the concrete problem by improving the stirrability and in particular by having<br>
a positive effect on the properties of the wet mortar, but also in the case of an<br>
application of these additives in thickener systems it has turned out that the time of<br>
addition can play a positive role Thus for example the delayed addition of a<br>
thickener based on an anionic polyacrylamide that was used accordingly in a<br>
formulation as an additive according to the invention considerably improved the<br>
stirrabihty and at the same time it was possible to considerably reduce the amount<br>
of additive used without having a negative effect on the wet mortar properties<br>
Furthermore the unexpected properties of the additives according to the present<br>
invention not only allow them to be used in building chemical systems which<br>
contain hydraulic binders, but also in other systems such as paints and lacqueis<br>
which clearly extends beyond the application field envisaged according to the object<br>
of the invention Overall the entirety of the positive effects found for the additive<br>
according to the invention could not have been predicted<br>
With regard to the essential component A) according to the invention, the present<br>
invention takes into account variants with properties that a person skilled in the art<br>
refers to as plastic and/or dynamic viscosity, flow limit, rheopexy and thixotropy<br>

non-cellulose type have proven to be particularly suitable as component A) wheie<br>
these are intended to have viscosity-enhancing properties in the final application<br>

derivatives and/or sulfo group-containing copolymers and/or copolymes based on<br>

which can also be used in any desired mixture have proven to be particularly<br>

The described copolymers are prepared in a known manner by linking the<br>
monomers forming the structures a) to d) by radical, ionic or complex coordmative<br>

If component A) in the additive according to the invention contains polyacrylamides<br>
among others, they should preferably have non-ionic, anionic, cationic or<br>

acid also come into consideration as anionic comonomers All these specified acids<br>
can be polymerized as free acids, as salts or as mixtures thereof Monomers that are<br>
completely water-soluble as well as those that have a limited water-solubility can be<br>
used as non-ionic comonomers for the polyacrylamides such as for example<br>
(meth)acrylmtnle, N,N-dimethylacrylamide, vmylpyridine, vinyl acetate,<br>
methacrylamide, hydroxy group-containing esters, polymerizable acids,<br>
dihydroxyethyl and dihydroxypropyl esters of acrylic acid and methacrylic acid,<br><br><br>
esters containing ammo groups and amides of polymerizable acids such as for<br>
example dialkylammo esters or amides such as dimethylammopropyl acrylamide<br>
Comonomers in the form of catiomzed esters of (meth)acryhc acid, catiomzed<br>
amides of (meth)acryhc acid and catiomzed N-alkylmono-amides and diamides with<br>
C1-6 alkyl residues are for example suitable as cationic polyacrylamides.<br>
In the case of hydrocolloid-forrning or hydrogel-forming substances as component<br>
A), the present invention preferably suggests polyelectrolytes based on acrylic acid<br>
or acrylamide derivatives or other ethylemcally unsaturated monomer building<br>
blocks preferably containing catiomc and/or anionic charges.<br>
Additives which contain component A) in a cross-linked or partially cross-linked<br>
form have proven to be particularly suitable.<br>
The additive according to the invention can then contain a member of the group<br>
borax, aluminium sulfate or zeolite as the moiganic component A) for certain<br>
applications.<br>
Overall component A) is only limited with regard to its essential inventive property<br>
1 e an enhancement of rheology However, in general all organic and/or inorganic<br>
compounds come into consideration as component A) where the particle size is also<br>
not subject to any major limitation Nevertheless the present invention takes into<br>
consideration a preferred vanant in which component A) has an average particle-<br>
size range of ≤ 500 µm and preferably ≤ 250 µm The distribution of particle sizes<br>
can be homogeneous or heterogeneous within the proposed particle size ranges I e<br>
it can consist of mainly larger particles or smaller particles which can also<br>
approximate the respective extremes and/or only cover these extremes depending on<br>
the respective application.<br><br><br>
Component B) of the additive which acts as a coating or shell, should according to<br>
the invention preferably be a film-forming polymer which initially completely<br>
surrounds the component A) and is released in a retarded manner during its<br>
application in construction chemistry. The following are especially suitable for this<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl acetate, polyethylene glycols with one or two<br>
hydrophobic end groups, modified polypropylene glycols, copolymers of<br>
polyethylene and polypropylene glycol, polyvinyl pyrolidme, polyvmyhdene<br>
chloride, alginates, cellulose derivatives, starch derivatives, gelatins, waxes and also<br>
any mixtures of the said representatives.<br>
In principle the shell component B) should be a compound which, due to physical<br>
and/or chemical interactions, can be applied to the core component A) and in the<br>
process of which forms chemical and/or physical and preferably reversible cross-<br>
links Dialdehyde such as e g glyoxal, dnsocyanates, dioles, carboxyhc acids and<br>
derivatives thereof and any mixtures thereof are regarded as particularly preferred<br>
The series of preferred representatives of component B) can be extended as desired<br>
while observing the required properties Representatives come into consideration as<br>
suitable compounds which contain at least two functional groups which are able to<br>
react with the functional groups, which are essentially the acidic groups or hydroxyl<br>
groups of component A) Suitable functional groups for this have already been<br>
mentioned above.<br>
hydroxyl, amino, epoxy, isocyanate, ester, amido or aziridmo groups Typical<br>
lepresentatives theieof are ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, triethylene glycol,<br>
tetraethylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, polyglycerol, tnethanolamme,<br>
propylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, block copolymers of ethylene oxide and<br>
propylene oxide, ethanolamme, sorbitan fatty acid esters, ethoxylated sorbitan fatty<br>
acid esteis, trimethylolpropane, pentaerythritol, 1,3-butanediol, 1,4-butanediol,<br>
polyvinyl alcohol, sorbitol, starch, polyglycidyl ether, polyaziridme compounds,<br>
1,6-hexamethylene diethylene urea, diphenylmethane-bis-4,4'-N,N'-diethylene urea,<br><br><br>
halogen epoxy compounds t,uch as epichlorohydrm and a-methylepifluorohydrm,<br>
polyisocyanates, alkylene carbonates, bisoxazolmes and oxazohdones, polyamido<br>
amines and products of their reaction with epichlorohydrm Finally the following<br>
also come into consideration polyquarternary amines such as e g condensation<br>
products of dimethylamme with epichlorohydrm and homopolymers and<br>
copolymers of dimethylammoethyl(meth)acrylate which can optionally also be<br>
quarternated with methyl chloride.<br>
Finally multifunctional bases are also suitable as a suitable component B) which<br>
must also be able to form ionic cross-links for which polyammes and quarternated<br>
salts thereof are particulaily suitable.<br>
As a further variant of component B) the present invention also envisages that it<br>
contains additional process additives which are preferably derived from the group of<br>
plasticizers such as e g phthalates and polyethylene glycols, anticakmg agents such<br>
as e g tuethyl citrate, polysorbate 80, stearic acid, sodium lauryl sulfate, talcum or<br>
antifoaming agents.<br>
The invention takes mto consideration that as a further variant component B) can be<br>
composed of several layers which preferably comprise at least one reactive layer<br>
According to definition ' reactive layer" is understood to mean that the component<br>
directly interacts with component A) usually as part of a polymerization process<br>
This means that in the case of a two-layer structure, the layer facing component A)<br>
as well as the outermost layer can have been present as reactive layers and have<br>
reacted with component A) However, all other variants are also conceivable in<br>
which for example only the innermost layer represents a reactive layer and for<br>
example has interacted with component A) or only the outermost layer Finally if<br>
component B) is composed of at least three layers, it is possible that neither the<br>
innermost nor the outermost layer is a reactive layer and the reactivity is limited to<br>
layers which aie arranged between the innermost and the outermost layer In this<br>
case they are mainly layers which have developed their respective reactivity in a<br><br>
retarded manner, 1 e not until the overlying layers towards the outside have been<br>
separated from the additive by abrasion and/or dissolution processes. In general it<br>
should be noted that component B) reacts with component A) which involves at<br>
least one reactive layer or further components react with component B) that has<br>
already been applied to component A). In this manner the essential inventive<br>
property of the present additive 1 e its rheology-enhancing effect can be specified<br>
and controlled depending on the respective application medium and the desired<br>
release profile of the core layer A) by selecting suitable shell components<br>
The above-mentioned also encompasses an additive variation in which component<br>
B) is applied to component A) with the aid of component C) .In this case it has<br>
proven to be particularly advantageous when component C) in a liquid form or as a<br>
physical mixture results in a chemical cross-linking of component B) on component<br>
A) Particularly suitable representatives of component C) are dialdehydes such as<br>
glyoxal, dnsocyanates, dioles, dicarboxyhc acids and derivatives and any mixtures<br>
thereof However, in principle all types of compounds which can also be used as<br>
component B) come into consideration as a suitable component C).<br>
From a practical point of view and taking into consideration the very broad<br>
application potentials, the additive according to the invention should not have<br>
excessively large particle sizes For this reason the present invention envisages an<br>
average particle size range for the additive consisting of components A) and B)<br>
which is ≤ 2000 µm and preferably ≤ 1000 µm<br>
In addition to the additive itself, the present invention also claims the use of this<br>
additive especially as an additive with an action that has a delayed onset The<br>
retardation is primarily due to component B) 1 e the shell component which as<br>
already described can comprise a variable number of layers and in particular<br>
reactive layers In this connection the additive according to the invention is<br>
especially suitable for use in paints and in this case above all in dispersion paints<br><br>
and inks, in lacquers, in pigment preparations and pigment concentrates which is<br>
also encompassed by the present invention.<br>
A special variant of use also relates to the time delay in which the increase in<br>
viscosity and/or rheology development in filled aqueous systems is time controlled<br>
This preferably occurs in combination with cellulose ethers and/or cellulose ether<br>
substitutes As alieady described these cellulose ether substitutes are representatives<br>
of the group oligosaccharides and polysaccharides, preferably starch ethers, welan<br>
gum, diutan gum, xanthan, chitosan or guar derivative and/or sulfo group-contammg<br>
copolymers and/or copolymers based on acrylamide and/or other hydrocolloid-<br>
formmg or hydrogel-forming substances as aheady described in detail above with<br>
regard to component A).<br>
The filled aqueous systems are preferably building material systems based on<br>
inorganic and in particular mineral binders and particularly preferably cement,<br>
gypsum, lime, anhydrite or other binders based on calcium sulfate.<br>
Tile adhesives, plasters, setting compounds, joint fillers, wall mortars, repair<br>
mortars and jointing mortars are particularly suitable representatives of such<br>
building material systems which according to the present invention are preferably<br>
suitable for mechanical stirring and/or mechanical application and in this connection<br>
they in particular constitute very stable treated and/or thickened dry mortars such as<br>
plasters or tile adhesives.<br>
Overall the additives for applications in construction chemistry according to the<br>
invention enable considerable improvements compared to the previously known<br>
state of the art due to their time controllable rheology-enhancmg properties which is<br>
not least due to the different compounds compared to the state of the art which the<br>
additive contains as component A) or component B)<br>

glyoxal The amounts of coating material were varied and preparations containing 1,<br>
2, 5 and 10 % by weight coating material were produced (stated in weight percent of<br>
coating material based on the polyacrylamide used)<br>
The polyacrylamides coated according to examples 1 to 5 (see table) were tested for<br>
their relevant properties in a tile adhesive formulation mixture 1<br>
1 kg tile adhesive mortar was stirred with a commercial drill (1000 W, 800 rpm) and<br>
a helical stirrer 340 g mixing water was added per 1000 g dry mortar<br><br><br><br>
Test methods<br>
Determination of stability (slip test)<br>
For the slip test a tile (15 x 25 cm, weight 1 9 kg) is placed in the tile adhesive<br>
formulation and loaded for 30 seconds with 5 kg weight. A mark is applied to the<br>
upper edge of the tile and the sample setup is placed vertically It is subsequently<br>
observed whether and to what extent the tile slips A slip of 1 to 10 mm is rated as<br>
stable<br>
Viscosity measurement<br>
The stirred fresh mortar is placed as free from air bubbles as possible in a 250 g can<br>
using a spatula The can is filled to the upper edge and is smoothed with the spatula<br>
Subsequently the material is compacted with the aid of a lifting table (10 lifts, about<br>
1 lift per second) and covered with the can lid (reversed) From this moment the<br>
time measurement is started The first viscosity measurement (Brookfield-<br>
Viscosimetei, Model RV) takes place after 5 mm, the second after 20 mm It is<br>
measured using a TF spindle (spindle 96 (TF) with a mark at 3 2 cm) at 2 5 rpm by<br>
immersing the spindle in the mortar up to the mark. In each case the highest<br>
indicated value (mPa*s or cP) is noted. At least 3 values should be determined per<br>
measurement (tolerance between the measurements +/- 10 %)<br><br><br>
n ap "no longer applicable" the viscosity is so high that the adhesive can no<br>
longer be applied to the concrete slab, it was therefore not possible to check the<br>
stability under load<br><br>
Example 7 (comparison)<br>
Experimental setup<br>
2000 g mortar according to mixture 1 was stirred with a commercial drill (1000 W,<br>
2000 rpm) and a type Ml 7 mortar mixer 340 g mixing water was added per 1000 g<br>
dry mortar<br><br>
Example 8 (comparison)<br>
Experimental setup<br>
2000 g mortar according to mixture 1 was stiried with a commercial drill (1000 W,<br>
2000 rpm) and a type M17 mortar mixer 340 g mixing water was added per 1000 g<br>
dry mortar<br><br><br>
Example 9 (invention)<br>
Experimental setup<br>
2000 g mortar according to mixture 1 was stirred according to 4 4 of EN 196-1 340<br>
g mixing water was added per 1000 g dry mortar The polyacrylamide was added<br>
according to the description "mixing process" in the table<br><br>
The effect of the delayed addition and its positive effect on the rheology (viscosity)<br>
is more pronounced in this example the higher the charge density of the<br>
polyacrylamide<br><br>
Example 10<br>
Experimental setup<br>
12 kg mortar was stirred with a commercial drill (1000 W, 800 rpm) and a helical<br>
stirrer 340 g mixing water was added per 1000 g dry mortar<br>
The sulfo group-containing polymer is the commercial product SWR 308/4198 from<br>
the Construction Research &amp; Technology Company<br><br>
Due to the retarded activation of the thickener as an additive according to the<br>
invention an excellent easy stirring behaviour was achieved in mixtures 2 and 4<br>
The build up of viscosity from a low viscosity to the end viscosity developed<br>
without a viscosity peak All four mixtures showed a stability of 1 to 4 mm In the<br>
case of mixtuie 4 it was possible to reduce the amount of the coated polyacrylamide<br>
by 25 % due to a synergistic effect with the copolymer containing sulfo groups In a<br><br>
mixture without the sulfo group-containing polymer (mixture 2) this reduction in<br>
the amount was not possible due to the loss of stability<br>
The retarded release of component A) (polyacrylamide) from the additive according<br>
to the invention into the dry mortar was achieved by coating the appropriate additive<br>
with a material which dissolved correspondingly slowly from the surface of the<br>
additive when the dry mortar is stirred in, where polyvinyl alcohol was used as a<br>
coating agent<br><br>
