[0001] This Application claims priority to U. S. applications serial numbers<br>
11/253927 filed on October 19, 2005, 11/056067 filed on February 11, 2005, and<br>
11/300229 filed on December 13, 2005, now pending.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] The present invention relates to novel aqueous polyurethane dispersions and shaped articles made therefrom. Specifically, the present invention relates to solvent-free, stable dispersions, which comprise fully formed polyurethaneurea with blocked isocyanate end groups. The dispersions can be formed by prepolymer mixing processes. The present invention additionally relates to shaped articles and coated articles formed from such aqueous dispersions, which can be heat and /or pressure activated for bonding, lamination and adhesion to substrates. The shaped articles may remain flexible and elastomeric after bonding, lamination or adhesion.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0003] Polyurethanes (including polyurethaneureas) can be used as adhesives for various substrates, including textile fabrics. Typically, such polyurethanes are either fully formed non-reactive polymers or reactive isocyanate-terminated prepolymers. Such reactive polyurethane adhesives often require extended curing time to develop adequate bonding strength, which can be a disadvantage in manufacturing processes. In addition, the isocyanate groups of the polyurethanes are known to be sensitive to moisture, which limits the storage stability and reduces the shelf life of the product incorporating such polyurethanes.<br>
[0004] Typically, such polymers, when fully formed, are either dissolved in a solvent (solvent borne), dispersed in water (water borne), or processed as thermoplastic solid materials (hot melt). Notably, solvent-based adhesives face ever-tightening health and environmental legislation aimed at reducing volatile<br><br>
organic compound (VOC) and hazardous air pollutant (HAP) emissions. Accordingly, alternatives to conventional solvent-based products are needea.<br>
[0005] Hot-melt adhesives, although environmentally safe and easily applied as films, generally have high set and poor recovery when subject to repeated stretch cycles. Therefore, improvements are needed.<br>
[0006] Many attempts have been made to develop water borne polyurethane adhesives to overcome these deficiencies.<br>
[0007] U.S. Patent No. 5,270,433 discloses an "adhesive composition comprising a substantially clear and solvent-free, aqueous, one-component polyurethane dispersion containing the reaction products of (a) a polyol mixture comprising polypropylene glycol, (b) a mixture of polyfunctional isocyanates comprising a, a, a1, a1-tetramethyl xylene diisocyanate (TMXDI), (c) a functional component capable of salt formation in aqueous solution, and (d) optionally, a chain-extending agent." The adhesive films from this composition have low recovery power and poor heat resistance in view of the unsymmetrical structure and steric hindrance of isocyanate groups on TMXDI, preventing the formation of strong inter-chain urea hydrogen bonds in the hard segments of the polymer.<br>
[0008] U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2004/0014880 A1 discloses an aqueous polyurethane dispersion for adhesive bonding in wet and dry laminations stated to have superior coatability, adhesive strength and heat resistance. This dispersion contains a substantial amount of organic solvent -methyl ethyl ketone (MEK).<br>
[0009] U.S. Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0220463 A1 discloses a method for making a polyurethane dispersion that is free of organic solvent such as N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP). However, the composition is limited to a prepolymer having low free diisocyanate species, such as methylene bis(4-phenylisocyanate) (4,4'-MDI). The process to produce such a prepolymer with<br><br>
processing also requires short path distillation of the free diisocyanate and is thus not economical in producing a prepolymer for making a polyurethane dispersion.<br>
[00010]	U.S. Patent No. 4,387,181 discloses a stable aqueous polyurethane<br>
dispersion, containing N-methylpyrrolidone (NMP) solvent, prepared by reaction of carboxylic group-containing oxime-blocked, isocyanate-terminated prepolymer and polyamine. The prepolymer is made by reaction of aromatic diisocyanates, such as 4,4'-diphehylmethanediisocyanate (MDI) or toluene diisocyanate (TDI), with polyether or polyester polyols and a dihydroxy alkanoic acid. The oxime-blocked isocyanate groups are capable of reacting with polyamine at 60 to 80°C within 6 to 18 hours. The dispersion is stable in storage, and the film formed from the dispersion has good tensile properties. However, this dispersion still has organic solvent present and the longer curing time needed is unsuitable for fabric bonding and lamination in practice.<br>
[0001] U.S. Patent No. 5,563,208 describes an acetone process to prepare an essentially solvent-free aqueous polyurethane dispersion, comprising urethane prepolymers with blocked isocyanate groups and polyamines within the molecular weight range of 60 to 400 in a molar ratio of blocked isocyanate groups to primary and/or secondary amino groups of from 1:0.9 to 1:1.5. This dispersion is stable in storage at room temperatures and gives a heat-resistant binder in coating. It requires long curing time (up to 30 minutes), which is still not suitable for fabric bonding and adhesion. Furthermore, the acetone process requires an additional distillation step to remove the acetone from the dispersion, which makes this process less economical.<br>
[00011]	U.S. Patent No. 6,586,523 describes an acetone process for<br>
preparing a self-crosslinking polyurethane dispersion for sizing agents, comprising a prepolymer with isocyanate groups partially blocked and partially extended, and excess polyfunctional compounds having molecular weights from 32 to 500 with primary or secondary amino and/or hydroxyl groups. This dispersion composition reduces the curing time to some degree, but still has<br><br>
deficiencies because an additional distillation step to remove the acetone is required.<br>
[00012]	U.S. Patent No. 6,555,613 describes a solvent-free aqueous<br>
dispersion of a reactive polyurethane having a number average molecular weight (Mn) of from 800 to 14,000, a degree of branching of from 0.0 to 3.0 mol/kg, and an isocyanate functionality from 2.0 to 6.0 per mole. The polyurethane is made from a polyester polyol, a polyisocyanate and polyisocyanate adduct, with low molecular weight polyol and anion-forming units after neutralizing incorporated in the polymer chains, and with blocked isocyanate groups capable of further reactions for crosslinking. The result of such dispersion is a coating material that is hard, glossy and elastic, but such coating material does not have the elastomeric features and stretch/recovery properties required for an adhesive to be used with stretch fabrics.<br>
[00013]	Thus, it would be desirable to provide an improved aqueous<br>
polyurethane dispersion, which overcomes one or more of the deficiencies of the prior art.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br><br>
[00040]	Aqueous polyurethane dispersions falling within the scope of the<br>
present invention are provided from particular urethane prepolymers, which also form an aspect of the present invention.<br>
[00041]	Urethane prepolymers, or capped glycols, can generally be<br>
conceptualized as the reaction product of a polyol, a polyisocyanate, and a compound capable of salt-forming upon neutralization, before the prepolymer is dispersed in water and is chain-extended. Such prepolymers can typically be made in one or more steps, with or without solvents. Depending on whether the prepolymer is dissolved in a less volatile solvent (such as MEK, or NMP) which will remain in the dispersion; dissolved in a volatile solvent such as acetone, which can be later removed; or is dispersed in water without any solvent; the dispersion process can be classified in practice as the solvent process, acetone process, or prepolymer mixing process. The prepolymer mixing process has environmental and economical advantages, and therefore is preferred as the basic process for making the solvent-free aqueous dispersions in the present invention.<br>
[00042]	In the prepolymer mixing process, it is important that the viscosity of<br>
the prepolymer is adequately low enough, without dilution by a solvent, to be transported and dispersed in water. The present invention in one embodiment, relates to polyurethane dispersions derived from such a prepolymer, which meet this viscosity requirement and do not have any organic solvent in the prepolymer or in the dispersion. In accordance with the invention, the prepolymer is the reaction product of a polyol a), a diisocyanate b) and a diol compound c).<br>
[00043]	The present invention can, in one embodiment, provide novel,<br>
solvent-free, stable, aqueous polyurethane dispersions, which can be processed and applied directly as adhesive materials {i.e., without the need of any additional adhesive materials) for coating, bonding, and lamination of to substrates, by conventional techniques. Aqueous polyurethane dispersions falling within the scope of the present invention may be provided with: essentially no emission of<br><br>
adhesion strength, heat resistance, and stretch/recovery properties in finished products and in practical applications.<br>
[00044]	The present invention can, in an additional embodiment, provide<br>
shaped articles which may or may not be adhesive that can be coated on a release paper, whereby aqueous dispersions of the invention can be used for bonding and lamination to substrates including textile fabrics. The adhesion can be activated, by applying heat and/or pressure onto a substrate and the adhesive film, with a residence time of less than one minute, for example, from about 15 seconds to about 60 seconds. The thus bonded articles have good stretch/recovery properties and are expected to be durable in normal wear and wash cycles.<br>

Alternatively, this prepolymer can be made in two steps by first reacting starting material a) with excess b), followed by reacting with component c) until a final desired %NCO of the prepolymer is achieved. For example, the %NCO may range from about 1.3 to about 6.5, such as from about 1.8 to about 2.6. Significantly, no organic solvent is added to or mixed with the starting materials before, during or after the reaction. Optionally, a catalyst may be used to facilitate the prepolymer formation.<br>

[00072]	At least one monofunctional dialkyl amine compound e), as the<br>
blocking agent for isocyanate groups, is added to the water medium during or after the prepolymer is dispersed. For example, the blocking agent can be added to the water mixture immediately after the prepolymer is dispersed. Optionally at least one polymeric component g) (MW &gt; about 500), with at least three or more primary and/or secondary amino groups per mole of the polymer, is added to the water medium after the prepolymer is dispersed and the blocking agent is added.<br>
[00073]	Examples of suitable mono-functional dialkylamine blocking agents<br>

The molar ratio of the amine blocking agent to the isocyanate groups of the prepolymer prior to dispersion in water generally should<br><br>
range from about 0.05 to about 0.50, for example from about 0.20 to about 0.40. Catalysts may be used for the de-blocking reactions.<br>
[00074]	Examples of the suitable polymeric component g) include:<br>

I. DuPont de Nemours, Wilmington, Delaware). Other additives which may be added to the prepolymer or the aqueous dispersion comprise adhesion promoters, anti-static agents, anti-cratering agents, anti-crawling agents, optical brighteners, coalescing agents, eiectroconductive additives, luminescent additives, flow and leveling agents, freeze-thaw stabilizers, lubricants, organic and inorganic fillers, preservatives, texturizing agents, thermochromic additives, insect repellants, and wetting agents.<br>
[00076]	Such optional additives may be added to the aqueous dispersion<br>
before, during, or after the prepolymer is dispersed, as the process allows. No organic solvent is added to the aqueous dispersion at any time.<br>
[00077]	Polyurethane aqueous dispersions falling within the scope of the<br>
present invention should be expected to have a solids content of from about 10% to about 50% by weight, for example from about 30% to about 45% by weight. The viscosity of polyurethane aqueous dispersions falling within the scope of the present invention may be varied in a broad range from about 10 centipoises to<br><br>
about 100,000 centipoises depending on the processing and application requirements. For example, in one embodiment, the viscosity is in the range of about 500 centipoises to about 30,000 centipoises. The viscosity may be varied by using an appropriate amount of thickening agent, such as from about 0 to about 2.0 wt%, based on the total weight of the aqueous dispersion.<br>
[00078]	The solvent-free aqueous polyurethane dispersions of the present<br>
invention are particularly suitable for adhesive shaped articles, which can be used for fabric bonding, lamination, and adhesion purposes when applied with heat and pressure for a relatively short period of time. Pressures, can for example, range from about atmospheric pressure to about 60 psi and times can range from less than about one second to about 30 minutes in accordance with the bonding method used.<br>
[00079]	Such shaped articles may be made by coating the dispersion onto a<br>
release paper and drying to remove water at temperatures below about 100 °C through commercially available processes to form a film on the paper. The formed film sheets can be slit into strips of desired width and wound-up into spools for later use in applications to form stretch articles, for example textile fabrics. Examples of such applications include: stitch-less or seamless garment constructions; seam seal and reinforcement; labels and patches bonding to garments; and localized stretch/recovery enhancement. The adhesion bonding can be developed in the temperature range of from about 100 °C to about 200 °C, such as from about 130 °C to about 200 °C, for example, from about 140 °C to about 180 °C, in a period of 0.1 seconds to several minutes, for example, less than about one minute. Typical bonding machines are Sew Free (commercially available from SewSystems in Leicester, England), Macpi trimming machine (commercially available from the Macpi Group in Brescia, Italy), Framis hot air welding machine (commercially available from Framis Italy, s p.a. in Milano, Italy).This bonding is expected to be strong and durable when exposed to<br><br>
[00081]	In addition, articles with laminated films or dispersions can be<br>
molded. For example, fabric can be molded under conditions appropriate for the hard yarn in the fabric. Also, molding may be possible at temperature which will mold the shaped article or dispersion, but below temperatures suitable for molding the hard yarn.<br>
[00082]	Lamination can be carried out to secure the shaped article to a<br>
fabric using any method wherein heat is applied to the laminate surface. Methods of heat application include, for example, ultrasonic, direct heat, indirect heat, and microwave. Such direct lamination may provide an advantage in view of other methods used in the art in that the shaped article may not only bond to the a substrate via a mechanical interaction but also via a chemical bond. For example, if the substrate has any reactive hydrogen functional groups, such groups may react with the isocyanate and hydroxyl groups on the dispersion or shaped article, thereby providing a chemical bond between the substrate and the dispersion or shaped article. Such chemical bonding of the dispersion or shaped article to the substrate can give a much stronger bond. Such bonding may occur in dry shaped articles that are cured onto a substrate or in wet dispersions that are dried and cured in one step. Materials without an active hydrogen include polypropylene fabrics and anything with a fluoropolymer or a silicone based surface. Materials with an active hydrogen include, for example, nylon, cotton, polyester, wool, silk, cellulosics, acetates, metals, and acrylics. Additionally, articles treated with acid, plasma, or another form of etching may have active hydrogens for adhesion. Dye molecules also may have active hydrogens for bonding.<br>
[00083]	Methods and means for applying dispersions and shaped articles<br>
falling within the scope of the present invention on an article include, but are not limited to: roll coating (including reverse roll coating); use of a metal tool or knife blade (for example, pouring a dispersion onto a substrate and then casting the dispersion into uniform thickness by spreading it across the substrate using a metal tool, such as a knife blade); spraying (for example, using a pump spray bottle); dipping; painting; printing; stamping; and impregnating the article. These<br><br>
methods can be used to apply the dispersion directly onto a substrate without the need of further adhesive materials and can be repeated if additional/heavier layers are required. The dispersions can be applied to any fabrics of knits, wovens or nonwovens made from synthetic, natural, or synthetic/natural blended materials for coating, bonding, lamination and adhesion purposes. The water in the dispersion can be eliminated with drying during the processing (for example, via air drying or use of an oven), leaving the precipitated and coalesced polyurethane layer on the fabrics to form an adhesive bond.<br>
[00084]	At least one coagulant may optionally be used to minimize<br>
penetration of dispersions according to the invention into a fabric or other article. Examples of coagulants that may be used include calcium nitrate (including calcium nitrate tetrahydrate), calcium chloride, aluminum sulfate (hydrated), magnesium acetate, zinc chloride (hydrated) and zinc nitrate.<br>
[00085]	An example of a tool that can be used for applying dispersions<br>
falling within the scope of the present invention is the knife blade shown in FIGS. 8 and 9. The knife blade 100, can be made of metal or any other suitable material. The knife blade can have a gap of a predetermined width 102 and thickness 104. The gap may range in thickness, for example, from 0.2 mils to 50 mils, such as a thickness of 5 mils, 10 mils, 15 mils, 25 mils, 30 mils, or 45 mils.<br>
[00086]	The thickness of dispersions and shaped articles falling within the<br>
scope of the present invention may vary, depending on the application and method of application. In the case of dry shaped articles, the final thickness may, for example, range from about 0.1 mil to about 250 mil, such as from about 0.5 mil to about 25 mil, including from about 1 to about 6 mil (one mil = one thousandth of an inch).  For aqueous dispersions, the amount used may, for example, range from about 2.5 g/m2 to about 6.40 kg/m2, such as from about 12.7 to about 635 g/m2, including from about 25.4 to about 152.4 g/m2.<br>
[00087]	Types of planar sheets and tapes that can be coated with<br>
dispersions and shaped articles falling within the scope of the present invention<br><br>
include, but are not limited to: textile fabrics, including wovens and knits; -nonwovens; leather (real or synthetic); paper; metal; plastic; and scrim.<br>

stretch and recovery and improved molding properties.<br>
[00090]	Articles comprising shaped articles, film, tape, or aqueous<br>
polyurethane dispersion may be molded. The articles may be made with multiple layers of substrate and shaped article, film, tape, or dispersion. The multi-layered articles also may be molded.

reverse roll coating are described in Walter, et al., "Solving common coating flaws in Reverse Roll Coating," AIMCAL Fall Technical Conference (October 26-29, 2003), the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[00094]	Dispersions and shaped articles falling within the scope of the<br>
present invention may be applied continuously or selectively to a given substrate. In this regard, FIGs. 5-7 show, in cross-sectional view, schematic illustrations of applications of dispersions and shaped articles falling within the scope of the present invention. In these figures, substrates are represented by thick black lines and dispersions and shaped articles falling within the scope of the present invention are represented as: (1) two parallel thin lines when applied via a spreading method (via use of a knife blade, etc.), as shown in FIG. 5; (2) a zigzag line superimposed on a thick black line when applied via a dipping method, as shown in FIG. 6; or (3) a zigzag line between or above thick black lines when applied via a painting or spray method and the like, as shown in FIG. 7. The drawings on the left-hand side of the figures, designated with a number followed by the letter "a", represent continuous application of dispersions and shaped articles falling within the scope of the present invention whereas the drawings on the right-hand side of the figures, designated with a number followed by the letter "b," represent selective or segmented application of dispersions and shaped articles falling within the scope of the present invention. While not shown in FIGs. 5-7, it is also contemplated that dispersions and shaped articles falling within the scope of the present invention can be applied both continuously and in segments in the same application, for example, continuously on or between some layers, and in segments on or between other layers.<br><br>
[00095]	FIGS. 10-13 show representative examples of garments that can be<br>
made to incorporate dispersions or shaped articles falling within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[00096]'        FIG. 10 shows a brassiere 110 having fabric brassiere cups 112 formed within a support structure that includes a peripheral region 114 surrounding the cups 112, and body-wrapping sides 116 that terminate with fastening means, such as a hook 118 and mating loop 120. The brassiere 110 further includes shoulder straps 122. The brassiere 110 can be made to incorporate dispersions or shaped articles falling within the scope of the present invention. Such dispersions or shaped articles can be provided for or on any number of locations on the brassiere, including, but not limited to, the shoulder straps 122, the peripheral region 114, and the body-wrapping sides 116. Such dispersions or shaped articles can be provided anywhere where a seam would be expected to be present to join one or more segments of material in the bra. As shown in FIG. 10, the brassiere cups 112 and geometric shaped regions 124 along the body wrapping sides 116 do not have film applied. All other fabric components include a shaped article or dispersion according to the invention. While not specifically shown in FIG. 10, brassiere cups 112 may be molded using dispersions falling within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[00097]	FIG. 11 shows a cross-sectional view of a brassiere cup 112.  FIG.<br>
12 shows an exploded view of the edge of the cup that meets the peripheral region 114 surrounding the cup. As shown in FIGs. 11 and 12, the brassiere cup 112 is formed of fabric to which no dispersion or film has been applied. The peripheral region 114 has a film applied, and thus has a greater thickness than the fabric of the cup, which comprises the thickness of the film and fabric together. The peripheral region 114 offers some breast supporting rigidity and firmness, without the uncomfortable rigidity provided by an underwire.<br>
[00098]	FIG. 13 shows a woman's panty or brief 130 that can be made to<br>
incorporate dispersions or shaped articles falling within the scope of the present invention for adhesion, enhanced elasticity, and/or enhanced support. Such dispersions or shaped articles can be provided for or on any number of locations<br><br>
on the panties or briefs 130, including, but not limited to, the waistband 132 anc the leg openings 134.<br>
[00099]	Another aspect of the invention is an article which may comprise an<br>
adhesive, a stretch member, and a substrate. The adhesive 150 and stretch member 152 may be combined in a first step and attached to the substrate 154 in a second step to form a stretch article 156, FIG. 14. Alternately, the adhesive 162 and stretch member 162 may be applied to the substrate 164 in a single step to form a stretch article 166, FIG. 15. In both embodiments heat and pressure can be used to bond the adhesive. Examples of the adhesive may include adhesive tape made from the aforementioned aqueous polyurethane dispersions or the dispersions themselves can be used directly as an adhesive. These adhesive may or may not be elastic.  Examples of a stretch member may include spandex yarn or tape, rubber yarn or tape, woven narrow elastic strip, knitted elastic strip, and the like. One embodiment of the invention is a folded over hem in which the substrate 200 is folded over and secured using the adhesive 202 and given support for stretch and recovery by the stretch member 204 , FIG. 16. The folded over hem shown in FIG. 16 can be used in garments, for example intimate apparel or swimwear.  Examples of intimate apparel include underwear for men and women, brassieres, and shapewear.<br>
[000100] Another aspect of the invention is an article comprising the shaped article and a substrate wherein the shaped article and the substrate are attached to form a laminate whereby coefficient of friction of the elastic laminate is greater than that of the substrate alone. Examples of this are a waistband with a coating or film comprising the aqueous polyurethane dispersion which prevents slippage of the garment from another garment such as a blouse or shirt, or alternately prevents slippage of the waistband on the skin of the garment wearer.<br>
[000101]        Another aspect of the invention is an article comprising a shaped article and a substrate wherein the modulus of the shaped article varies along the length, or alternately the width, of the article. For example, a substrate such as fabric 302 can be treated with two feet (61 cm) of a shaped article such as a one inch (2.5 cm) wide adhesive tape 304. An additional layer of adhesive 306 can<br><br>
be applied by painting three two inches (5 cm) by one inch segments along the length of the one inch wide adhesive tape to form composite structure 300, FIG. 17.<br>
[000102]        Shaped article, for example films of the aqueous polyurethaneurea dispersions, may have the following properties:<br>
set after elongation of from about 0 to 10%, for example from about<br>
0 to 5%, typically from about 0 to about 3%,<br>
elongation of about 400 to about 800%, and<br>
tenacity of about 0.5 to about 3 Mpa.<br>
[000103]       Laminates prepared from articles and substrates may have the<br>
following properties:<br>
peel strength after 50 washes wherein at least 50% of the strength is maintained from the same before washing, air permeability of at least about 0 to about 0.5 cfm, and moisture vapor permeability of at least about 0 to about 300 g/m2 over 24h.<br>
Analytical Methods<br>
[000104]       In the examples that follow, the following analytical methods were used:<br>
Peel Strength for Adhesive Bonds<br>
[000105]       ASTM D903-93, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, was modified for testing of film laminated fabrics. The sample size used for testing was 1 inches x 6 inches (2.5 cm x 15 cm). The separation rate was 2 inches per minute (5 centimeter per minute). Data are reported as pounds of force per inch of sample width (kilogram per millimeter), as shown in Tables 2 and 4.<br><br>
Wash Test<br>
[000106]        AATCC test method 150-2001, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, was used for the washing of molded bra cups. The machine cycle was (I) normal/cotton sturdy. The washing temp was (III) 41 °C. The drying procedure was (A)(i) tumble cotton sturdy 66 °C for 30 minutes with a 10 minute cool down time.<br>
Moisture Vapor Transport<br>
[000107]        ASTM E96-00, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, was used for testing the moisture vapor transport properties of articles. Data are reported as grams per square meter for a 24 hour period, as shown in Table 7.<br>
Air Permeability<br>
[000108]       ASTM D-737, the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference, was used for testing the air permeability properties of articles. Data are reported as cubic feet of air per minute per square foot of fabric (cfm, cubic centimeter of air per second per square centimeter of fabric (ccs)) , as shown in Table 7.<br>
Elongation, Tenacity, and Set<br>
[000109]       Elongation and tenacity properties were measured on films using a dynamic tensile tester Instron. The sample size was 1 x 3 inches (1.5 cm x 7.6 cm) measured along the long dimension. The sample was placed in clamps and extended at a strain rate of 200% elongation per minute until a maximum elongation was reached. The tenacity and elongation were measured just prior to the film break. Similarly, the set % was measured by extending a 1 x 3 inches sample of film (1.5 cm x 7.6 cm) from 0 to 50 % elongation for five cycles at a strain rate of 200% per minute. The set % was measured after the fifth cycle.<br>

Example 1<br>
[000117]       The preparation of the prepolymers was conducted in a glove box with nitrogen atmosphere. A 2000 ml Pyrex® glass reaction kettle, which was equipped with an air pressure driven stirrer, a heating mantle, and a thermocouple temperature measurement, was charged with about 382.5 grams of Terathane® 1800 glycol and about 12.5 grams of DMPA. This mixture was heated to about 50 °C with stirring, followed by the addition of about 105 grams of Lupranate® Ml diisocyanate. The reaction mixture was then heated to about 90 °C with continuous stirring and held at about 90 °C for about 120 minutes, after which time the reaction was completed, as the %NCO of the mixture declined to a stable value, matching the calculated value (%NCO aim of 1.914) of the prepolymer with isocyanate end groups. The viscosity of the prepolymer was determined in accordance with the general method of ASTM D1343-69 using a Model DV-8 Falling Bali Viscometer, (sold by Duratech Corp., Waynesboro, VA.)» operated at about 40 °C. The total isocyanate moiety content, in terms of the weight percent of NCO groups, of the capped glycol prepolymer was measured by the method of S.

[000122]       The viscosities, as measured by the falling ball method at 40 °C, of the example prepolymer samples (Examples 1 through 5) and comparative examples samples (Examples 6C through 10C) are listed in Table 1 for comparison:<br><br><br>
[000123]       As shown in Table 1, the prepolymers prepared with Lupranate® Ml or Mondur® ML gave substantially lower viscosity, in the absence of any solvent during or after the prepolymer preparation, than those prepared with Isonate® 125MDR. The prepolymer viscosities from the comparative example samples, without the dilution using a solvent, were too high to be transported and dispersed in water in downstream processing.<br>
Example 11<br>
[000124]        The solvent-free prepolymer, as prepared according to the procedures and composition described in Example 1, was used to make the polyurethaneurea aqueous dispersion of the present invention. [000125]       A 2,000 ml stainless steel beaker was charged with about 700 grams of de-ionized water, about 15 grams of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), and about 10 grams of triethylamine (TEA). This mixture was then cooled with ice/water to about 5 °C and mixed with a high shear laboratory mixer with rotor/stator mix head (Ross, Model 100LC) at about 5,000 rpm for about 30 seconds. The viscous prepolymer, prepared in the manner as Example 1 and contained in a metal tubular cylinder, was added to the bottom of the mix head in the aqueous solution through flexible tubing with applied air pressure. The temperature of the prepolymer was maintained between about 50 °C and about<br><br>
70 °C. The extruded prepolymer stream was dispersed and chain-extended with water under the continuous mixing of about 5,000 rpm. In a period of about 50 minutes, a total amount of about 540 grams of prepolymer was introduced and dispersed in water. Immediately after the prepolymer was added and dispersed, the dispersed mixture was charged with about 2 grams of Additive 65 (commercially available from Dow Corning®, Midland Michigan) and about 6 grams of diethylamine (DEA). The reaction mixture was then mixed for about another 30 minutes. The resulting solvent-free aqueous dispersion was milky white and stable. The viscosity of the dispersion was adjusted with the addition and mixing of Hauthane HA thickening agent 900 (commercially available from Hauthway, Lynn, Massachusetts) at a level of about 2.0 wt% of the aqueous dispersion. The viscous dispersion was then filtered through a 40 micron Bendix metal mesh filter and stored at room temperatures for film casting or lamination uses. The dispersion had solids level of 43% and a viscosity of about 25,000 centipoises. The cast film from this dispersion was soft, tacky, and elastomeric.<br>
Example 12<br>
[000126]       The solvent-free prepolymer, as prepared according to the procedures and composition described in Example 1, was used to make the polyurethaneurea aqueous dispersion of the present invention. [000127]       A 2,000 ml stainless steel beaker was charged with about 900 grams of de-ionized water, about 15 grams of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), and about 10 grams of triethylamine (TEA). This mixture was then cooled with ice/water to about 5 °C and mixed with a high shear laboratory mixer with rotor/stator mix head (Ross, Model 100LC) at about 5,000 rpm for about 30 seconds.

In a period of about 50 minutes, a total amount of about 540 grams of prepolymer was introduced and dispersed in water. Immediately after the prepolymer was added and dispersed, the dispersed mixture was charged with about 2 grams of Additive 65<br><br>
(commercially available from Dow Corning®, Midland Michigan) and about 6 grams of diethyiamine (DEA). The reaction mixture was then mixed for about another 30 minutes. The resulting solvent-free aqueous dispersion was milky white and stable. The viscous dispersion was then filtered through a 40 micron Bendix metal mesh filter and stored at room temperatures for film casting or lamination uses. The dispersion had solids level of 40% and a viscosity of about 28 centipoises. The cast film from this dispersion was soft, tacky, and elastomeric.<br>
Example 13<br>
[000128]       The solvent-free prepolymer, as prepared according to the procedures and composition described in Example 1, was used to make the polyurethaneurea aqueous dispersion of the present invention. [000129]       A 2,000 ml stainless steel beaker was charged with about 700 grams of de-ionized water, about 15 grams of sodium dodecylbenzenesulfonate (SDBS), and about 10 grams of triethylamine (TEA).

In a period of about 50 minutes, a total amount of about 540 grams of prepolymer was introduced and dispersed in water. Immediately after the prepolymer was added and dispersed,' the dispersed mixture was charged with about 2 grams of Additive 65 (commercially available from Dow Corning®, Midland Michigan) and about 6 grams of diethyiamine (DEA). The reaction mixture was then mixed for about another 30 minutes. The resulting solvent-free aqueous dispersion was milky white and stable. The viscous dispersion was then filtered through a 40 micron Bendix metal mesh filter and stored at room temperatures for film casting or lamination uses. The dispersion had solids level of 43 % and a viscosity of about<br><br>
28 centipoises. The cast film from this dispersion was soft, tacky, and elastomeric.<br>
Example 14C<br>
[000130]       The preparation procedures were the same as Example 11, except that DEA was not added into the dispersion after the prepolymer was mixed. Initially, the dispersion appeared to be no different from Example 11. However, when the dispersion was aged at room temperatures for one week or more, the film cast from this dispersion was brittle and not suitable for adhesions or laminations.<br>
Example 15<br>
[000131]       The filtered aqueous dispersion as prepared in Example 11 was used to coat films on silicone coated release paper, with a continuous 12-inch (30 cm) laboratory reverse roll coater. The coater was equipped with a 3-zone drying oven, with the temperature settings at about 60 °C, 75 °C and 120 °C, respectively. The total residence time of drying was about 6 minutes. The dried film of about 3-mil thick was wound up at a speed of about 2 meters per minute. The elastomeric film 12 was able to peel off from the release paper easily and used for laminations.<br>
Example 16<br>
[000132]       The filtered aqueous dispersion as prepared in Example 11 was used to coat films on silicone coated release paper to form elastomeric film 12. Lab samples were prepared manually by securing a 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) sheet of double sided silicone release paper (Covermount DS from Print Mount Co., Inc 401-232-0096) to a work surface with masking tape. The aqueous dispersion was poured onto the release paper and cast into a uniform thickness by spreading the dispersion across the release paper using a metal knife blade tool, as shown in FIGs. 8 and 9, having a 6 inch (15 cm)wide gap of 5 mil thickness.  Excess solution was blotted with a paper towel. Castings were air-dried overnight under a hood. The resulting film 12 was easy to peel away from the release paper for further use.<br><br>
Example 17<br>
[000133]        The film on release paper 12 from Example 15 was placed onto the back of a 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) warp knit nylon with spandex fabric 14. The fabric/film/release paper sandwich was fed into a Hashima HP-400C Belt Oven Laminator (Hashima Co., Ltd , Gifu-City Japan, 058-245-4501) and laminated at 165 °C, with a 20 second residence time and a pressure setting of P=1,16, as shown by path 11a in FIG. 1. The release paper was removed, leaving film/fabric laminate stretch article 18a.<br><br>
Example 18<br>
[000134]       The laminated stretch article 18a was covered with another 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) piece of warp knit nylon spandex fabric. The fabric/film/fabric sandwich was fed into the Hashima laminator and laminated at 165 °C, with a 20 second residence time and a pressure setting of P=1, to give stretch article 24a. The peel strength for Example 18 was 2.56 lb/in, see Table 2.<br>
Example 19<br>
[000135]       Film 12 of Example 15 was laminated to fabric under the same conditions as Example 17, with the exception that the lamination temperature was 120 °C . The release paper was removed, leaving a film/fabric laminate stretch article 18a. The film side of article 18a was covered with another 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) layer of warp knit nylon spandex fabric. The fabric/film/fabric sandwich was fed into the Hashima laminator and laminated at 165 °C, with a 20 second residence time and a pressure setting of P=1 to give a stretch article 24a. The peel strength for Example 19 was 1.71 lb/in, see Table 2.<br><br>
Example 20<br>
[000136]       In this example, two stretch articles of 18a were layered with the film sides facing each other. The fabric/film/film/fabric sandwich was fed into the Hashima laminator and laminated at 165 °C with a 20 second residence time and a pressure setting of P=1 to give a stretch article. The peel strength for Example 20 was 4.25 lb/in, see Table 2.<br>
Example 21<br>
[000137]        Film 12 of Example 15 was carefully removed from release paper and placed onto a 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) warp knit nylon with spandex fabric 14. Another 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) layer of warp knit nylon spandex fabric was placed onto cast film 20. The fabric/film/fabric sandwich 20 was fed into the Hashima laminator and laminated at 165 °C, with 20 a second residence time and a pressure setting of P=1 22 to give a stretch article 24a. The peel strength for Example 21 was 1.72 lb/in, see Table 2.<br>
Example 22<br>
[000138]       A second film was carefully removed from release paper and placed on the fabric/film/fabric sandwich 24a to form article 26. A second 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) layer of warp knit nylon spandex fabric was placed onto the second layer of cast film 28. The fabric/film/fabric/film/fabric sandwich was fed into the Hashima laminator and laminated at 165 °C, with 20 second residence time and a pressure setting of P=1 as in 30, to give stretch article 32a.<br>
Example 23<br>
[000139]       In this example, a piece of warp knit nylon spandex fabric (1 inch x 12 inch (2.5cm x 30 cm)) was dipped into high viscosity aqueous dispersion 10b from Example 11 and pulled out, and then the excess was squeezed off between gloved fingers. The excess was squeezed off a second time between gloved fingers to give the dipped article 34. The coated strip was hung and allowed to air dry overnight under a hood to give stretch article 38a, path 21a in FIG. 2.<br>
Example 24<br><br>
[000140]       A piece of lightweight nonwoven fabric, deformable in the cross-machine direction, is soaked into low viscosity aqueous dispersion 10b, prepared according to the method of Example 12 (40 wt% solids and 28 centipoises). The dipped article 34 is allowed to drip to remove excess dispersion liquid, and then is hung for drying in a fume hood for overnight 36 to give stretch article 38a, path 21a in FIG. 2.<br>
Example 25<br>
[000141] In this example, stretch article 38a from Example 23 was covered with a warp knit nylon spandex fabric (6inch x 12 inch (15cm x 30 cm)) 40. The layered article 40 was fed into the Hashima laminator and laminated at 165 °C, with 20 second residence time and a pressure setting of P=1 as in 42, path 21b in FIG. 2, to give stretch article 44a. The peel strength for Example 25 was 6.17 lb/in, see Table 2.<br>
Example 26<br>
[000142]        In this example, stretch article 44a was covered with a warp knit nylon spandex fabric (6 inch x 12 inch (15 cm x 30 cm)) 46, path 21c in FIG. 2. The layered article 46 was fed into the Hashima laminator and laminated at 165 °C, with 20 second residence time and a pressure setting of P=1 as in 48 to give stretch article 50a. The peel strength for Example 26 was 5.26 lb/in, see Table 2.<br>
Example 27<br>
[000143]       In this example, a filtered solution of the aqueous dispersion as prepared in Example 12 is poured into a typical spray bottle. The filtered aqueous dispersion 10c is applied directly to bistretch cotton/spandex twill fabric using spray bottle, 52 as shown in FIG. 3. The fabric is air-dried, 54, to form a stretch article 56a, path 31a in FIG. 3.<br>
Example 28<br>
[000144]       A piece of stretch denim fabric is pretreated by soaking into a bath containing a water solution of 20 wt% calcium nitrate tetrahydrate as a coagulant and dried in an oven at 100 °C for 30 minutes. The aqueous dispersion 10c, prepared according to the method of Example 12 (40 wt% solids and 28<br><br>
centipoises) is coated evenly onto the backside of the pretreated fabric with a blade, as shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, having a 5 mil gap thickness. The dispersion is coagulated on the surface of the fabric without soaking through. This fabric is then dried 54 in the oven at 80 °C for 60 minutes to give a stretch article 56a, path 31a in FIG. 3.<br>
Example 29<br>
[000145]       A piece of stretch denim fabric is coated with a high viscosity dispersion 10c of Example 11 (43 wt% solids and 25000 centipoises). This increased viscosity allows the dispersion coated on one side of the fabric without soaking through the fabric 52. The fabric is dried 54 in an oven at 80 °C for 60 minutes 56a, path 31a in FIG. 3.<br>
Example 30<br>
[000146]       A 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) warp knit nylon spandex fabric piece was secured to the work surface using masking tape (allowing the fabric to be held under slight tension in the warp direction). The filtered aqueous dispersion 10c of Example 11 (43 wt% solids and 25000 centipoises) was poured onto the fabric 52. This increased viscosity allows the dispersion coated on one side of the fabric without soaking through the fabric 52. A uniform thickness of film was made by spreading the dispersion across the fabric using the metal tool, shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, having a 6 inch wide gap of 10 mil thickness.  Excess solution was blotted with a paper towel. Coated fabric was air-dried overnight under a hood. The article 52 was fed into the Hashima laminator and laminated at 165 °C, with 20 second residence time and a pressure setting of P=1 as in 54 to form a stretch article 56a, path 31a in FIG. 3.<br>
Example 31<br>
[000147]        A 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) warp knit nylon spandex fabric piece was secured to the work surface using masking tape (allowing the fabric to be held under slight tension in the warp direction). The filtered aqueous dispersion 10c of Example 11 (43 wt% solids and 25000 centipoises) was poured onto the fabric 52. A uniform thickness of film was made by spreading the dispersion across the fabric using the metal tool, shown in FIGS. 8 and 9, having<br><br>
a 6 inch wide gap of 10 mil thickness. Excess solution was blotted with a paper towel. Another 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) warp knit nylon spandex fabric was laid over the dispersion and lightly pressed to promote adhesion 58, path 31b in FIG. 3. The coated fabric sandwich was air-dried overnight under a hood. The layered article 58 was fed into the Hashima laminator and laminated at 165 °C, with 20 second residence time and a pressure setting of P=1 as in 60 to give stretch article 62a. The peel strength for Example 31 was 4.06 lb/in, see Table 2.<br><br>
Example 32<br>
[000148]        Stretch article 24a, FIG. 1, was made according to Example 21 except that 100% cotton circular knit fabric was used as the top fabric and the bottom fabric. A 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) piece of cotton based stretch article 24a was molded into a bra cup using a Texilformung Willi Lehman GmbH Molding Machine Type 2030 NT equipped with an 8.5 cm deep circular bullet mold. The bullet and conical mold base were heated to 195 °C, while the ring clamp was heated to 185 °C. The fabric was molded according to standard practice for 45 seconds. The cup height was measured immediately after molding and again after a wash and dry cycle according to AATCC Test Method 150-2001. The laminated and molded cup with cotton had a height of 7.4 cm. After washing, the cup of Example 32 had a height of 4.2 cm.<br><br>
Example 33C<br>
[000149]       A 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) piece of 100 % cotton circular knit was molded in the same manner as Example 32. The cup height was measured immediately after molding and again after a wash and dry cycle according to AATCC Test Method 150-2001. The 100 % cotton circular knit molded cup had a height of 7.3 cm. After washing the cup of Example 33C had a height of 1.9 cm.<br>
Example 34<br>
[000150]        Stretch article 24a, FIG. 1, was made with warp knit nylon spandex fabric as top fabric and bottom fabric, according to Example 21. A 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) piece of warp knit nylon spandex based stretch article 24a was molded in the same manner as Example 32. The cup height was measured immediately after molding and again after a wash and dry cycle according to AATCC Test Method 150-2001. The laminated and molded cup had a height of<br>
6.7	cm. After washing the cup of Example 34 had a height of 6.4 cm.<br>
Example 35C<br>
[000151]       A 12 inch x 12 inch (30 cm x 30 cm) piece of 100 % warp knit nylon was molded in the same manner as Example 32. The cup height was measured immediately after molding and again after a wash and dry cycle according to AATCC Test Method 150-2001. The laminated and molded cup had a height of<br>
6.8	cm. After washing the cup of Example 35C had a height of 5.9 cm.<br>
Example 36<br>
[000152]       Four spandex yarns (Lycra®70 denier) were cut from a package into 110 cm lengths and laid side by side. The yarns were laid down side by side in a flat bundle and pressed into the tape formed from cast film of example 11, FIG 14. The yarn tape composite was fed into a bonding machine (commercially available from Sew Systems, Leicester, England) with a warp knitted fabric to form a folded over hem on the fabric. The fold over hemming was carried out at 180 °C resulting in a smooth hem which was held together by the adhesive tape and reinforced with the spandex yarn, FIG. 16.<br><br>
Example 37<br>
[000153]        In this example, the hemming was done similar to example 36, but the spandex yarn drafted (stretched) and the tape had little to no draft or tension while it was being fed into the bonding machine. This resulted in a hem which was similar to the hem of example 36, but the hem in this example was gathered.<br>
Example 38<br>
[000154]        In this example, the fabric of example 36 is coated with a solution of the dispersion as in example 30. Stretch yarn is applied to the fabric and the fabric is hemmed using a bonding machine as in example 36. A flat bonded hem reinforced with a stretch yarn is formed.<br>
Example 39<br>
[000155]       In this example a spandex yarn is coated with the dispersion of example 11. The coated yarn is applied to the edge of the fabric. The edge of the fabric is folded over to create a hem. The folded hem is bonded using a bonding machine as in example 36. Aflat bonded hem using a stretch yarn to bond the fabrics is formed.<br>
Example 40<br>
[000156] A laminated article made similar to from example 17 was tested for peel strength. The sample was washed 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 times. Data for this example are given in Table 4.<br>
Example 41<br>
[000157]       A laminated article was made according to example 40 with the exception of the film. The film used for this example was a 1 mil stretch film #3410 (commercially available from Bemis Associates, Inc. of Shirley, Massachusetts). The laminate was tested for peel strength. The sample was washed 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 times. Data for this example are given in Tables 4 and 5.<br><br><br>
Example 42<br>
[000158]       In this example, dispersion of Example 12 was used according to Example 15 to make a 2 mil film. A second layer of film was made by casting of the dispersion of Example 12 into a 4.5 mil film on a polypropylene sheet.
