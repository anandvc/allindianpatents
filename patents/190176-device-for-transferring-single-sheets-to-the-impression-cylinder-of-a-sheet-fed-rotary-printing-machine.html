				<td>Device for transferring single sheets to the impression cylinder of a sheet fed rotary printing machine<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a device for transferring single sheets to the impression cylinder of a sheet fed rotary printing machine according to the preamble of patent claim 1.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
A device of this type has been disclosed by EP-A-0,467,832 of the same applicant. This device allows the position of a sheet to be constantly automatically adapted, remaining in register, to the position of the printing plate, which is printing it and is attached to the plate cylinder, during transfer to the impression cylinder. This obviates the necessity to adjust the printing plates themselves, when they are being attached to the plate cylinder, at precisely equal angular intervals, which is cumbersome and time-consuming. Deviations from the actual precise attachment position of the printing plates are corrected in the device mentioned by the automatic adjustment of the sheets on the transfer cylinder.<br>
A common factor in the conventional sheet-transfer devices was that the arriving sheets are transferred to the impression cylinder precisely in the same rhythm, the transfer point of the transfer cylinder, at which the leading edge of the sheet is taken over by the grippers of the impression cylinder, always being the<br>
same. In order to achieve the fact that, when the sheets are printed, the spacing between the leading edge of the sheet and the beginning of print, that is to say the free top margin of the sheet, is constantly of equal width, due care had to be taken during the attachment of the printing plates on the plate cylinder that all the printing plates were mounted with precisely equal spacing, that is to say, in the case of a plate cylinder having two, three or four printing plates, had to have a precise angular interval of 180°, of 120° or of 90° respectively. The condition that all the printed sheets must have a top margin of equal size is extremely important, above all when printing security documents, in particular when printing bank notes, in which the sheets have a number of security-document prints arranged in rows and columns and are subsequently cut up into individual security documents. Different widths of the top margins of the sheets, whose leading edge serves as a reference edge for cutting, therefore lead to incorrect centering of the security documents and thus to rejection.<br>
By means of the known device according to EP-A-0,467,832 described at the beginning, however, a correction of the sheet position can only be carried out in the one or the other circumferential direction, but the sheet cannot be adjusted slightly obliquely relative to the circumferential direction, if appropriate, if this were to be required by a correspondingly oblique attachment position of the printing plate on the plate cylinder. This means that, when the printing plates are being attached to the plate cylinder, although precisely equal angular intervals are not essential, a precise adjustment of the printing plates parallel to the axis is essential, the leading edges of which printing plates have to be aligned exactly parallel to the axis of the plate cylinder.<br>
The restriction of the adjustment possibilities in the known device to a parallel displacement of the sheets in the circumferential direction is based on the<br>
fact that the transfer cylinder has a drum which can be adjusted relative to its shaft in the circumferential direction and on which the sheet rests, such that it is impossible to turn the sheet obliquely relative to the circumferential direction using this device.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is based on the object of improving the known device of the type described at the beginning in such a way that not only an adjustment of the sheet in the circumferential direction is possible, but also an adjustment of the sheet slightly obliquely relative to the circumferential direction in order thus to be able to take account of any possible oblique position of the printing plates attached to the plate cylinder. Additionally, the construction of the device is to be simplified.<br>
The object of this invention provides a device for transferring single sheets to the impression cylinder of a sheet fed rotary printing machine which has a plate cylinder provided with N printing plates, having a transfer cylinder which acts together with the impression cylinder, whose diameter is 1/N of the diameter of the plate cylinder and which completes N revolutions when the plate cylinder does one revolution, having sheet grippers which are installed on the transfer cylinder, have a front stop for the arriving sheets and are adjustable by a controllable setting means during each revolution of the transfer cylinder such that, when passing through the transfer position in which a sheet is transferred to the impression cylinder, the front stop takes a position by means of which the precise register of said sheet is adjusted relative to the position of the printing plate which prints it on the plate cylinder, wherein the sheet grippers are mounted on a setting plate mounted movably on the transfer cylinder, and an individually controllable setting means engages at each end of said setting plate, which setting means displaces the relevant end of the setting plate by a amount relative to the transfer cylinder in the circumferential direction thereof during each revolution of the transfer cylinder.<br>
The fact that, during each revolution of the transfer cylinder, each of the two ends of the movably mounted setting plate is individually adjustable by a predeterminable amount allows, in a simple manner, not only displacement of a sheet in the circumferential direction, but also turning to an oblique position if the two ends of the setting plate are namely adjusted by different amounts. In this case, only the movably mounted setting plate with the sheet grippers and not, as in the known device, an entire drum needs to be adjusted relative to the cylinder shaft.<br>
A preferred embodiment is described in claims 2 and 3.<br>
Further expedient designs, in particular a preferred design of the control means which actuate the two setting means, emerge from the other dependent claims.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
According to Figures 1 to 3, the transfer cylinder 2 of the device is arranged between a feed roller S and the impression cylinder D of a. rotary printing machine, in particular an intaglio printing machine, whose plate cylinder P (Figure 3) interacts in a known manner with the impression cylinder D. The directions of rotation of all the cylinders are indicated by arrows in the Figures 1 to 3.<br>
The plate cylinder P has at least two printing plates, generally N printing plates, N being greater than 1. In the example considered, the plate cylinder P has four printing plates which are mounted at an angular interval of approximately 90°, that is to say do not necessarily have to be adjusted precisely to a fraction<br>
of a millimeter at a 90° interval, and which can also have deviations from the axial parallelism. In Figure 3, the four printing segments of the impression cylinder D and of the plate cylinder P are indicated.<br>
The sheets B are moved by the feed roller S individually one after the other via a feed table T (indicated only diagrammatically) and are passed to the transfer cylinder 2, every arriving sheet being conveyed against the front stop 4a of the sheet grippers 4 linked to the transfer cylinder 2 and being carried along by said sheet grippers until they are transferred to the impression cylinder D. The feed roller S can, in particular, be a known suction roller driven at a nonuniform speed. In the illustration according to Figure 1, an arriving sheet B is just being taken over by the sheet grippers 4 and, in the illustration according to Figure 2, the leading edge of the sheet B is being transferred by the transfer cylinder 2 to the sheet grippers G2 of the impression cylinder D.<br>
During one full revolution of the plate cylinder, the transfer cylinder 2 completes N revolutions, that is to say four revolutions in the example considered, and it has a diameter which amounts to 1/N of the diameter of the plate cylinder P, that is to say a quarter of said diameter in the example considered. During each revolution, the transfer cylinder 2 conveys one sheet.<br>
In the example considered, the impression cylinder D and the plate cylinder P are of equal size and, since there are four printing plates, the impression cylinder D has four printing segments covered with rubber blankets and, ahead of each rubber blanket, sheet grippers of which the grippers Gl can be seen in Figure 1 and the grippers G2 can be seen in Figure 2.<br>
In the region of the feed roller S a known front lay (not illustrated here) is usually also provided, which serves to align an arriving sheet B and is subsequently pivoted downwards so that said sheet can be conveyed onto the transfer cylinder 2.<br>
According to Figures 4 and 5, in which the feed<br>
roller S, the feed table T and the impression cylinder D are not illustrated, the transfer cylinder 2 is mounted by its shaft 1 so as to be rotatable in the machine frame 30 and is driven at a uniform speed by the impression cylinder by means of a gear 32 which is attached to said shaft 1 and engages in the impression-cylinder gear. In this case, the transfer cylinder 2 thus completes four revolutions when the plate cylinder P does one full revolution. Since the impression cylinder D has the same diameter as the plate cylinder P, as is usually the case, this naturally corresponds to one revolution of the impression cylinder D. In principle, however, the impression cylinder can also have a different diameter from that of the plate cylinder, in particular a smaller diameter, it being possible for the impression cylinder, for example, to be just as large as the transfer cylinder.<br>
The sheet grippers 4 which interact with a gripper or sheet rest 4' are arranged on the transfer cylinder 2 so as to be adjustable to the respective adjustment of the position of the arriving sheets. For this purpose, the sheet grippers 4 are mounted on a setting plate 3 which is mounted movably in the two side walls 5 and 6 of the transfer cylinder 2. For this purpose, the setting plate 3 has, at its two ends, guide projections 3a and 3b which engage in guide slots 5b and 6b respectively in the side walls 5 and 6. Linked to these side walls 5 and 6 are roller levers 9 and 10 which are pivotable in bearings 5a and 6a respectively in these side walls about axes lying parallel to the shaft 1. These roller levers are provided with carriers 11 and 12 at their ends protruding into the transfer cylinder 2 and with running rollers 13 and 14 at their other ends.<br>
The carriers 11 and 12 engage in each case between two stop parts 7 and 8 respectively which are attached to the setting plate 3, extend essentially parallel to the shaft 1 and are located opposite one another in the circumferential direction of the transfer cylinder  2.  These  stop parts  7  and  8  serve  as  a<br>
clearance-free guide for the carriers 11 and 12 respectively. The running rollers 13 and 14 engage in each case in an annular guide path 15c and 16c respectively which is formed by two mutually concentric annular projections 15a, 15b and 16a, 16b respectively of an annular actuator 15 or 16 respectively on the one or the other side and which surrounds the shaft 1. The two actuators 15 and 16 are suspended so as to be pivotable in each case about a journal 17 and 18 respectively, attached to the device frame 30 above the shaft 1, so that they can be tilted about an axis lying parallel to the shaft 1. The arrangement is such that the running rollers 13 and 14 can roll along the annular guide paths 15c and 16c without clearance while the transfer cylinder 2 rotates.<br>
With the aid of the control means described below, the actuators 15 and 16 can be pivoted individually about the journals 17 and 18 in a plane oriented perpendicular to the shaft 1, as a result of which, as explained below, the setting plate 3 with its sheet grippers 4 can be adjusted relative to the body of the transfer cylinder 2 parallel to the circumferential direction thereof or into a position oriented obliquely relative to the circumferential direction.<br>
Each of the actuators 15 and 16 has its own control means. Both control means are of identical construction and each have a lever arm 19 or 20 respectively which is attached to the region of the actuator 15 or 16 respectively facing away from the journal 17 or 18 respectively. As shown in Figure 4, the same number of individually adjustable stops 19a to 19d are attached to the lever arm 19 as there are printing plates provided on the plate cylinder, that is to say four adjustable stops in the example considered. Accordingly, the individually adjustable stops 20a to 20d are provided on the lever arm 20.<br>
In Figure 4, the lever arms 19 and 20 are illustrated, for reasons of clarity, with their stops turned downwards through 90° relative to their actual position<br>
which is shown in Figure 5. These stops 19a to 19d and 20a to 20d lie adjacently and can interact in each case with a control eccentric in the form of a cam 24a to 24d and 25a to 25d respectively. All the cams are seated on the shaft 23, mounted rotatably in the device frame 30, and have the shape of segments which extend in each case over an angle of approximately 360°/N, that is to say over approximately 90° in the example considered. The angular interval of adjacent cams is 360°/N, that is to say 90° in the example considered, so that, for example, the cam 24a or 25a can act on the stop 19a or 20a respectively during a quarter-revolution of the shaft 23, while the other cams 19b to 19d or 20b to 20d are ineffective; in the following quarter-rotation of the shaft 23, the cam 24b or 25b can then act on the stop 19b or 20b respectively while the other cams are ineffective, etc.<br>
The arrangement is such that, during one full revolution of the transfer cylinder 2, the shaft 23 with the cams completes one quarter-revolution. For this purpose, a gear 27 is attached to the one end of the shaft 23, the diameter of which gear is four times as large as a gear 31 on the shaft 1, and which is driven by said gear 31 by means of a toothed belt 26. In general, the shaft 23 with the cams completes 1/N revolutions during one full revolution of the transfer cylinder.<br>
As shown in Figure 5, the lever arm 19 with its stops 19a to 19d is drawn, by a tension spring 21 which is attached to the lever end and whose other end is attached to the frame 30, in the direction of the cams 24a to 24d or in the direction of a fixed stop 22 which is mounted on the frame 30. In the position illustrated by continuous lines in Figure 5, the lever arm 19 rests against the fixed stop 22 under the effect of the spring 21 since all the adjustable stops 19a to 19d assume a position which is sufficiently remote from the cams 24a to 24d. This position of the lever arm 19 with the actuator 15 is described as the zero position in which the annular guide path 15c lies concentrically to the axis 1 of the transfer cylinder 2.<br>
In the position of the device illustrated by dot-dashed lines in Figure 5, the stop 19a assumes the position 19a'. In this position, it is adjusted to such an extent in the direction of the cam 24a assigned to it that said cam strikes against said stop when passing through its effective position and presses it back to such an extent that the lever arm 19 with its actuator 15 is pivoted about the journal 17 in the clockwise direction relative to the zero position counter to the effect of the spring 21. This dot-dashed position is intended to represent the maximum deflection.<br>
The above description applies equally to the arrangement and functioning of the other actuator 16 with its lever arm 20 for which a corresponding tension spring and a corresponding fixed stop are provided, and to the interaction of the stops 20a to 20d with the cams 25a to 25d. Since the two actuators 15 and 16 can be controlled independently of one another, the one actuator can assume its zero position while the other actuator is pivoted out of its zero position to a greater or lesser extent.<br>
During each full revolution of the transfer cylinder 2, the actuators 15 and 16 are either left in their zero position or adjusted about the fixed journal 17 or 18 respectively individually according to a given program which is defined by the individual adjustment of the adjustable stops 19a to 19d and 20a to 20d, depending on whether a cam 24a to 24d or 25a to 25d respectively pushes or does not push the assigned adjustable stop 19a to 19d or 20a to 20d respectively back by a greater or lesser amount when passing through its effective position.<br>
The essential factor is the position of the setting plate 3 at that moment at which the leading edge of a sheet located on the transfer cylinder 2 is transferred, whilst the sheet grippers 4 are open, to the sheet grippers of the impression cylinder D, as illustrated in Figure 2. The position of the sheet at this point in time determines the later, in-register adaptation of said sheet to the relevant printing plate of the<br>
plate cylinder. It is to be assumed in the following that the two positions illustrated in Figure 5 are these positions during the sheet transfer.<br>
The zero position is selected such that any required correction of the position of the sheet only needs to take place in the one circumferential direction. The maximum possible deflection is adapted to the magnitude of the tolerance of the plate attachment, that is to say by experience the maximum inaccuracy in the attachment of the plates to the plate cylinder.<br>
The actuators 15 and 16 are located in that position of the transfer cylinder in which its sheet grippers 4 take over an arriving sheet, and said sheet grippers are thus constantly in the zero position. If correction of the sheet position is not required, the relevant stop is adjusted in such a way that it is not contacted by the relevant cam. During the transfer of a sheet from the transfer cylinder 2 to the impression cylinder D, both actuators 15 and 16 therefore continue to assume their rest position, as shown in Figure 5 by continuous lines for the lever arm 19 with the actuator 15, and the guide paths 15c and 16c lie concentrically to the cylinder axis 1. Therefore no displacement of the setting plate 3 with the sheet grippers 4 takes place, and the sheet does not undergo any displacement on the transfer cylinder 2.<br>
It shall be assumed that, for the purpose of positional correction, the following sheet has to be displaced into an oblique position relative to the circumferential direction, specifically into the maximum oblique position. For this purpose, the following adjustable stop 19b is displaced by the maximum possible amount in the direction of the cams, which is illustrated for the position 19a' of the stop 19a by dot-dashed lines in Figure 5. After the transfer cylinder 2 has completed one full revolution and therefore the cam shaft 23 has completed a quarter-revolution, the following cam 24b assumes its operating position and brings about a maximum deflection of the lever arm 19 with the actuator 15 by<br>
striking against the stop 19b. As is to be assumed, the other actuator 16 remains in its zero position. Owing to the deflection of the actuator 15, its guide path 15c is pivoted towards the left eccentrically to the cylinder axis 1 in the illustration according to Figure 5. As a result, the setting plate 3 with the sheet grippers 4 at their left-hand end according to Figure 5 is displaced by the roller lever 9 in the one circumferential direction, while its other end remains non-displaced. The sheet transferred onto the impression cylinder D is therefore in an oblique position which corresponds to the corresponding oblique position of the printing plate on the plate cylinder.<br>
Analogously, the guide path 16c and thus the other end of the setting plate 3 can, of course, also be displaced by corresponding adjustment of one of the stops 20a to 20d on the other side, such that the sheet is displaced obliquely in the other direction.<br>
If the corresponding stops 19a and 20a, 19b and 20b etc. have been adjusted by the same amount on both sides and are therefore pushed back by the same amount by the cams 24a and 25a or 24b and 25b etc. assigned to them, this then means that the two actuators 15 and 16 are adjusted by the roller levers 13 and 14 by exactly the same amount in the same circumferential direction. This results in a purely parallel displacement of the sheet. Only if the two ends of the setting plate 3 are adjusted by different amounts based on different adjustments of the simultaneously effective stops 19a and 20a, 19b and 20b etc., does this correspond to theadjust-ment of the relevant sheet into an oblique position.<br>
The stops 19a to 19d and 20a to 20d are adjusted individually in such a way that, during each rotation of the transfer cylinder, an individual correction of the position of the setting plate 3 and thus of the position of the sheet takes place in such a way that, during the transfer of the sheet to the impression cylinder, said sheet assumes the position required to achieve a perfect printing register. In this way, after printing, all the<br>
sheets have a constant margin width between the leading edge and the beginning of print.<br>
This individual adjustment of the stops 19a to 19d and 20a to 20d takes place, in the example considered, by means of the diagrammatically illustrated adjusting screws 28a to 28d and 29a to 29d respectively.<br>
Such an adjustment of the stops can take place either by hand, for example by means of the diagrammati-cally illustrated adjusting screws, prior to the printing operation based on some trial prints, or setting motors are provided for this purpose, each of which is assigned to an adjustable stop. These setting motors are either actuated from a control panel by pressing keys or they are controlled as a function of the register deviations which are measured automatically by reading off register lays. In the case of non-printed sheets, this purpose is served, for example, by the register lays which are applied during printing and by means of whose readings the positions of the subsequent sheets are corrected. When the arriving sheets already have a first print, for example a background, register lays applied in the first printing unit can then serve for the automatic register correction.<br>
In general, it is sufficient to provide a maximum displacement of the setting plate 3 of two millimeters, for example, relative to the transfer cylinder 2 because the adjustment of the printing plates on the plate cylinder with a tolerance of a maximum of two millimeters is possible without difficulty and without taking up much time.<br>
The device according to the invention is not restricted to the exemplary embodiment described, but permits a variety of design embodiments.<br><br><br><br>
