				<td>Combination product for controlling parasites on animals<br>
The invention relates to novel compositions for controlling parasites on animals, comprising an N-arylpyrazole and also a pyrethroid in a formulation comprising aliphatic cyclic carbonates and aliphatic cyclic or acyclic polyethers.<br>
N-Arylpyrazoles and their good insecticidal and acaricidal activity are known from US 2006014802 Al, WO2005090313 Al, FR2834288 Al, WO09828277, US06069157, WO200031043, DE19824487, WO09804530, WO09962903, EP00933363, EP00911329, WO09856767, US05814652, WO09845274, WO9840359, WO09828279, WO09828278, DE19650197, WO09824767, EP00846686, EP00839809, WO09728126, EP00780378, GB02308365, US05629335, WO09639389, US05556873, EP00659745, US05321040, EP00511845, EP-A-234119, EP-A-295117 and WO 98/24769. In spite of this abundance of applications with numerous N-arylpyrazole structures, there is a superior structure type which, for most indications, shows, by comparison, the best activity. l-[2,6-Dichloro-4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-3-cyano-4-[(trifluoromethyl)-sulphinyl]-5-aminopyrazole (INN: fipronil) is generally acknowledged to be the most effective compound of this class for controlling most parasites.<br>
N-Arylpyrazoles have been marketed as ectoparasiticides for more than 10 years (Hunter, J.S., III, D.M. Keister and P. Jeannin. 1994. Fipronil: A new compound for animal health. Proc. Amer. Assoc. Vet. Parasitol. 39th Ann. Mtg. San Francisco, CA. Pg. 48.). They are distinguished by good and broad activity and acceptable compatibility. It is known that the existing formulations having a high content of DEE (Transcutol) contain a strong transdermal (FR1996-11446 A; Sicherheitsdatenblatt [Safety data sheet]: ISO/DIS 11014/29 CFR 1910.1200/ANSI Z400.1 Printing date 10/23/2001: FRONTLINE® TOP SPOT™: fipronil 9.7% w/w) component. This facilitates, via the formulation, penetration into the sebaceous glands and the epithelium (Skin distribution of fipronil by microautoradiography following topical administration to the beagle dog. Cochet, Pascal; Birckel, P.; Bromet-Petit, M.: Bromet, N.: Weil, A.; European Journal of Drug Metabolism and Pharmacokinetics (1997), 22(3), 211-216.). Via sebum excretion from the sebaceous<br>
glands, a high concentration in the sebaceous glands may contribute to a long-lasting availability of the active compound if the active compound is carried along. However, in the case of the customary formulations, penetration of N-arylpyrazoles into the circulation is also likely, since each hair follicle is supplied by a blood vessel and the follicles are thus separated from the circulation only by a very thin barrier (Transfollicular drug delivery - Is it a reality? Meidan, Victor M; Bonner, Michael C; Michniak, Bozena B.; International Journal of Pharmaceutics (2005), 306(1-2), 1-14). Thus, the availability of the active compound on the animal is limited, too, both with respect to duration and concentration, since the active compound passes into the circulation and its available concentration in the sebum is lowered accordingly.<br>
It is further known that the efficacy of the N-arylpyrazoles against representatives of the genus Ixodes is less than that against other genera of ticks (Endris RG, Matthewson, Cooke D &amp; Amodie D (2000). Rellency and efficacy of 65% permethrin and 9.7% fipronil against Ixodes ricinus. Vet. Therapeutics, Vol. 1 (No, 3): 159-168); Endris RG, Cooke D, Amodie D, Sweenwy DL &amp; Katz TL (2002). Repellency and efficacy of 65% permethrin and selamectin spot-on formulations against Ixodes ricinus on dogs. Vet. Therapeutics. Vol. 3 (No. 1): 64-71).<br>
Pyrethroids do likewise have a relatively broad insecticidal action, and some representatives also show good acaricidal effects; however, with these compounds there are frequently incompatibilities, and only particularly non-toxic representatives with limited efficacy can be used for cats. Recently, WO 04/098290 described a solution of this problem where a dosage tolerated by cats could be achieved with the aid of a synergist, an acaricidal pyrethroid and a neonicotinoid. The different physicochemical properties of the materials used require special formulations.<br>
Furthermore, it is generally known that, compared to N-arylpyrazoles, pyrethroids are less active against ticks of the genus Dermacentor. Recently, it has furthermore been found that there is no cross-resistance between pyrethroids and N-arylpyrazoles in pyrethroid-resistant insects. On the other hand, selection of such mosquito strains with N-arylpyrazoles even leads to partial reversion of the pyrethroid resistance.<br>
[Laboratory evaluation of fipronil, a phenylpyrazole insecticide, against adult Anopheles (Diptera: Culicidae) and investigation of its possible cross-resistance with dieldrin in Anopheles stephensi. Kolaczinski, Jan; Curtis, Chris. London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, London, UK. Pest Management Science (2001), 57(1), 41-45].<br>
WO 2001/065941 Al and EP1013170 Al propose the combination of an N-arylpyrazole and a pyrethroid in applications against plant pests. JP 11049618 A2 uses similar mixtures to prevent feeding damage on timber constructions. WO 95/22902 Al uses such mixtures for the direct control of termites. FR 2713891 Al and WO 95/22902 Al even claim a synergistic effect of such mixtures, but without demonstrating it clearly.<br>
However, [Antagonism of fipronil toxicity by piperonyl butoxide and S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate in the German cockroach (Dictyoptera: Blattellidae). Valles, Steven M.; Koehler, Philip G.; Brenner, Richard J. Center for Medical, Agricultural and Veterinary Entomology, USDA-ARS, Gainesville, FL, USA. Journal of Economic Entomology (1997), 90(5), 1254-1258] indicates that inhibitors of the oxidative metabolism (P450 oxidase inhibitors) have an antagonistic effect in cockroaches on the action of N-arylpyrazoles. Since most pyrethroids are detoxified via the p450 oxidase path, they, like MGK264 or piperonyl butoxide, have to be considered to be antagonists rather than synergists of the N-arylpyrazoles.<br>
GB2396557 Al teaches that the treatment of ectoparasites with mixtures of N-arylpyrazoles and pyrethroids (if appropriate also with addition of synergists, such as MGK264 or piperonyl butoxide) is possible when concentrated powder formulations are used. WO 95/22902 Al describes a soil treatment with improved activity by combined application of phenylpyrazoles and pyrethroids for control of termites. Here, too, the mixture used is unsuitable for application on homeotherms.<br>
Since such formulations are difficult to apply in practice and, owing to the particles (GB 2396557), involve additional toxicological risks, it has to be the object to prepare a self-spreading liquid formulation having a good user safety profile which<br>
combines the positive activity properties of the pyrethroids with those of the N-arylpyrazoles and does not result in a reduction of the efficacy of the N-arylpyrazoles even in the presence of further synergists from the class of the p450 oxidase inhibitors.<br>
To this end, by intensive analyses and test series, we have now identified, from a large number of additives, solvents and spreading agents, formulations which, in general, can improve the good arthropodicidal efficacy properties of the N-arylpyrazoles in combination with pyrethroids. Surprisingly, the expected antagonistic effects were not observed here.<br>
The invention relates to novel compositions for controlling parasites on animals, comprising an N-arylpyrazole and a pyrethroid in a formulation comprising:<br>
an aliphatic cyclic carbonate<br>
an aliphatic cyclic or acyclic polyether.<br>
The arthropodicidal compositions according to the invention are novel and, compared to the formulations hitherto described, have considerably better and longer-lasting efficacy, with simultaneously improved user and target animal safety profile.<br>
For the compositions, the combination partners of the N-arylpyrazoles are preferably arthropodicidal pyrethroids, in particular of the cyanopyrethroid (for example flumethrin), type-1 pyrethroid (for example permethrin) or non-ester pyrethroid (etofenprox) type.<br>
Here, a-cyanopyrethroids (for example alpha-cypermethrin, cyfluthrin, beta-cyfluthrin, cyhalothrin, cypermethrin, deltamethrin, fenvalerate, flucythrinate, flumethrin, tau-fluvalinate) are preferably employed in a concentration range of from 0.01 to 5% by weight, and a synergist is added, if appropriate (as described, for example, in WO 04/098290). Particular preference is given to using cypermethrin, cyfluthrin, deltamethrin and flumethrin in a concentration range of from 0.025 to<br>
0.25% by weight. Very particular preference is given to using flumethrin in a concentration range of from 0.05 to 1.25% by weight.<br>
Type-1 pyrethroids (for example allethrin, bioallethrin, permethrin, phenothrin, resmethrin, tetramethrin, transfluthrin) are preferably employed in a concentration range of from 20 to 70% by weight. Particular preference is given here to permethrin, cyphenothrin in a concentration range of from 30 to 60% by weight. Very particular preference is given to using permethrin in concentrations of from 40 to 50% by weight.<br>
Non-ester pyrethroids (for example etofenprox, halfenprox, silafluofen) are usually employed in a concentration range of from 10 to 60% by weight. Preference is given to etofenprox or halfenprox; particular preference is given to etofenprox in a concentration range of 25-55%.<br>
To the person skilled in the art, N-arylpyrazoles are known per se as arthropodicidally active compounds, for example from the documents mentioned above, which are incorporated herein by way of reference.<br>

(Formula Removed) <br>
Particularly preferred examples of compounds which can be used according to the invention are:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
An example of a very particularly preferred N-arylpyrazole is fipronil.<br>
A further example of a very particularly preferred N-arylpyrazole is 5-amino-4-trifluoromethylsulphinyl-1 -(2,6-dichloro-4-trifluoromethylphenyl)-3 -thio-carbamoylpyrazole.<br>
Depending on the nature and arrangement of the substituents, the active compounds may, if appropriate, be present in various stereoisomeric  forms, in particular as enantiomers and racemates. According to the invention, it is possible to use both the pure stereoisomers and mixtures thereof.<br>
If appropriate, the active compounds can also be employed in the form of their salts, pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts and basic salts being suitable.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts are salts of mineral acids or organic acids (for example carboxylic acids or sulphonic acids). Examples which may be mentioned are salts of hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, acetic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, succinic acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, methanesulphonic acid, 4-toluenesulphonic acid, galacturonic acid, gluconic acid, embonic acid, glutamic acid or aspartic acid. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are, for example, the alkali metal salts, for example the sodium or potassium salts, and the alkaline earth metal salts, for example the magnesium or calcium salts.<br>
It is furthermore also possible to use the active compounds in the form of their solvates, in particular hydrates. Solvates are to be understood as meaning both the solvates, in particular hydrates, of the active compounds themselves and the solvates, in particular hydrates, of their salts.<br>
As solids, the active compounds may, in certain cases, form various crystal modifications. Advantageous for the use in medicaments are stable modifications having suitable solubility properties.<br>
Unless indicated otherwise, percentages are to be understood as per cent by weight based on the weight of the finished preparation.<br>
Usually, the compositions comprise the arylpyrazole in amounts of from 1 to 27.5% by weight, preferably from 5 to 20% by weight, particularly preferably from 7.5 to 15% by weight.<br>
The aliphatic cyclic carbonate is preferably ethylene carbonate or propylene carbonate, it also being possible to use mixtures.<br>
The amount of aliphatic cyclic carbonate in the formulation can be varied widely in the range of from 10% by weight to 70% by weight, preferably from 12.5 to 50% by weight, particularly preferably from 15 to 40% by weight.<br>
Aliphatic cyclic and/or acyclic ethers are compounds known per se. Preferably, they are ethers derived from diols having up to 8 carbon atoms, such as, for example, ethylene glycol, diethylene glycol, propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol. In the acyclic ethers, one or both OH groups carry a C1-4-alkyl group, preferably, only one OH group is etherified; particularly preferred examples are: diethylene glycol monoethyl ether, diethylene glycol monopropyl ether, dipropylene glycol monopropyl ether. Preferred 5- or 6-membered cyclic ethers have a ring oxygen and 4 or 5 ring carbon atoms and optionally carry a C1-4-alkyl substituent; preferably, they carry a free OH group either directly on the ring or on the C1-4-alkyl substituent. A particularly preferred example is tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol. The amount of aliphatic, cyclic and/or acyclic ether in the compositions according to the invention can be varied within wide limits of from 20 to 77.5% by weight, with amounts in the range of from 25 to 65% by weight and amounts in the range of from 25 to 50% by weight being particularly preferred and very particularly preferred, respectively.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the compositions according to the invention may additionally comprise one or more esters of a dihydric or trihydric alcohol having up to three carbon atoms with organic fatty acids having 6 to 18 carbon atoms. As alcohol component, the esters used according to the invention contain a di-or trihydric alcohol having up to three carbon atoms, such as, for example, ethylene glycol, propylene glycol or glycerol. In general, at least two, preferably all, hydroxyl groups of the alcohol are esterified. The acid components of the esters are fatty acids having 6 to 18 carbon atoms, which may be straight-chain, branched and also mono-or polyunsaturated. It is possible to use mixed esters or else mixtures of various types of esters. Preferred triglycerides are caprylic/capric acid triglycerides and also caprylic/capric/linoleic acid triglycerides. Preference is likewise given to esters of propylene glycol with caprylic and/or capric acid (propylene glycol octanoate decanoate). Particularly preferably, these glycerol or propylene glycol esters of caprylic/capric acid have a viscosity range (20°C) of 0.08 - 1.3 Pa.s, and preferably<br>
0.08 - 0.40 Pa.s. It is also possible to use their polyethylene oxide-, polypropylene oxide- and/or propylene carbonate-modified derivatives having the viscosity range mentioned. Examples which may be mentioned are propylene glycol dicaprylate, propylene glycol octanoate decanoate having a viscosity range of 0.09-0.12 Pa.s, caprylic/capric diglyceryl succinate having a mean viscosity of 0.23 Pa.s, medium-chain caprylic/capric triglycerides having a viscosity of 0.27 - 0.30 Pa.s.<br>
The liquid formulations according to the invention may comprise one or more of the esters mentioned above. Usually, the compositions according to the invention comprise the ester or the ester mixture in proportions of from 0 to 40% by weight, preferably from 1 to 35% by weight, particularly preferably from 1 to 12.5% by weight and very particularly preferably from 2.5 to 7.5% by weight.<br>
If appropriate, customary organic or inorganic antioxidants may be used for stabilizing the formulations mentioned. Suitable inorganic antioxidants are, for example, the sulphites and bisulphites, in particular sodium bisulphite. Preference is given to phenolic antioxidants, such as anisole, butylated hydroxytoluene and hydroxyanisole, and their mixtures with one another. Usually, from 0.01 to 1% by weight, preferably from 0.05% to 0.5%, particularly preferably from 0.075 to 0.2% by weight is used.<br>
The formulation ingredients mentioned, in particular the organic esters, may be stabilized against possible hydrolytic degradation using acidifying agents. Suitable acidifying agents are pharmaceutically acceptable acids, in particular carboxylic acids, such as, for example, succinic acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid or citric acid. Their preferred amount is in the range of from 0 to 0.5% by weight, but preferably from 0 to 0.2% by weight.<br>
Polymeric surfactants based on polymethoxysiloxanes having a low surface tension of 
is the methoxysilane/ethylene oxide copolymer Belisil Silvet L 77 from Bayer GE Siliconics GmbH. The amount of these formulation auxiliaries may be varied within wide limits in the range of from 0.01 to 1.0% by weight. The preferred range is from 0.2 to 0.4% by weight.<br>
If appropriate, the formulations may comprise further pharmaceutically acceptable auxiliaries and additives.<br>
In addition to the arylpyrazoles and pyrethroids, the compositions according to the invention may also comprise one or more additional active compounds. Preferred examples of such active compounds for combinations which may be mentioned are: growth inhibitors, such as, for example, chitin biosynthesis inhibitors, such as, for example, benzoylphenylureas (for example triflumuron, lufenuron); phenyloxazolines (for example etoxazole); juvenile hormone analogues (for example methoprene, hydroprene, pyriproxifen) and also mixtures of these active compounds with one another. Their amount may be varied within wide limits in the range of from 0.1 to 7.5% by weight, but preferably from 0.25 to 5.0% by weight, particularly preferably from 0.25 to 2.5% by weight.<br>
The formulations according to the invention may also comprise synergists. Synergists in the sense of this application are to be understood as meaning compounds which for their part do not have the desired activity, but which, as mixing partners, increase the activity of the active compounds. Piperonyl butoxide, MGK264, verbutin, S,S,S-tributyl phosphorotrithioate may be mentioned here in an exemplary manner. In the formulations according to the invention, synergists are preferably used for α-cyanopyrethroids, namely in a synergistpyrethroid ratio of 20-50:1 (see also WO 04/098290). The preferred synergist is MGK264.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are environmentally compatible and have a low toxicity which is reduced compared to that of known compositions. Accordingly, they are user-friendly and furthermore distinguished by their easy handling. The compositions have a favourable flashpoint of &gt; 70°C and can therefore<br>
be manufactured in simple plants which do not require additional measures to protect against explosions.<br>
Having favourable homeotherm toxicity, the compositions of the invention are suitable for controlling parasitic arthropods, in particular insects and arachnids, very particularly fleas and ticks, encountered on animals, in particular homeotherms, particularly preferably mammals. These animals may be domestic animals and useful animals and also zoo animals, laboratory animals, test animals and pets.<br>

Biological examples<br>
All compounds were metered out exactly by weight to ensure better comparability. To this end, 20 pipettes of the fipronil-containing commercial preparation were emptied into a glass bottle and likewise blinded using a code. All samples were applied as a single spot to the neck (cats and smaller dogs) using Eppendorf pipettes (volume up to 0.95 ml). For application volumes of more than 1 ml, the volume was halved and applied to the neck as two spots at a distance of about 10 cm.<br>
Further laboratory tests for the activity against fleas and ticks according to Example 2 show that the preparations in the abovementioned formulations according to the invention have very good and long-lasting action against ticks and fleas which, in the tests, is consistently superior to the prior art (CE1 - CE3). Furthermore, the preparations in the abovementioned formulations according to the invention are distinguished in that they are tolerated by target animal and user, and they are thus highly suitable for controlling fleas and ticks on small animals.<br>
A.	Activity against fleas (Ctenocephalides felis) on dogs<br>
Between days -4 and -1, dogs are infested 1-2 times with about 100 adult unfed Ctenocephalides felis per dog. The fleas are placed on the neck of the animal. On day 0, the success of the infestation on the dog is examined by checking the awake animal for fleas. The number of live fleas is noted.<br>
After the fleas have been counted, the animals are treated. The dogs of the control<br>
group are not treated. The medicaments to be examined are administered to the<br>
animals dermally as a spot-on in an application rate of 0.1-0.15 ml/kg of bodyweight<br>
or as a spray in an application rate of 1-1.5 ml/kg of bodyweight. The application is<br>
carried out once on day 0. Only animals that are clinically healthy are used.<br>
On days 1 and 2, all dogs are examined for live fleas. The results are noted with the<br>
crude data.<br>
On days 7, 14, 21, 28 and 35 and, if appropriate, also on days 42 and 49, all dogs are<br>
reinfested with about 100 adult unfed Ctenocephalides felis per dog. In each case one<br>
day after the reinfestation, all dogs are checked for live fleas. The results are noted<br>
with the crude data.<br>
A formulation is considered to be highly effective if, between 24 and 48 hours after<br>
reinfestation, an efficacy of &gt; 95% is found, and this action persists for at least<br>
3-4 weeks.<br>
The efficacy is calculated using a modified formula according to Abbott:<br>

B. Activity against ticks (Rhipicephalus sanguineus, Dermacentor variabilis') on dogs<br>
Between days -4 and -1, dogs are sedated using 2% Rompun® (Bayer AG, active compound: xylazine hydrochloride) (0.1 ml/kg of bodyweight). Once all dogs have been sedated (after about 10-15 minutes), they are transferred to transport boxes, and 50 Rhipicephalus sanguineus or Dermacentor variabilis (25♀, 25♂) per dog are applied to the neck of the animal. After about 1½ hours, the animals are retransferred from the transport box into the cage.<br>
On day 0, the success of the infestation on the dog is examined by checking the awake animal for ticks. An intensive search is carried out in the region of the head<br>
and the ears, including the folds of the ears, in the region of the neck, on the lower abdomen, on the lower breast, on the flank and in between the toes and on the limbs. The number of sucking live ticks is noted. Dead ticks are removed. After the ticks have been counted, the animals are treated. The dogs of the control group are not treated. The medicaments to be examined are administered to the animals dermally as a spot-on at 0.1-0.15 ml/kg of bodyweight or as a spray at 1-1.5 ml/kg of bodyweight. The application is carried out once on day 0. Only animals which are clinically healthy are used.<br>
On day 1 and day 2, all dogs are checked for living and dead sucking ticks. The results are noted with the crude data. On day 2, all living and dead ticks are removed from the dog.<br>
On days 7, 14, 21, 28, 35 and, if appropriate, also on days 42 and 49, all dogs are reinfested with in each case 50 Rhipicephalus sanguineus or Dermacentor variabilis (25♀, 25♂) per dog. In each case two days after the reinfestation, all dogs are checked for living and dead sucking ticks. The results are noted with the crude.data. On the second day after the reinfestation, all living and dead ticks are removed from the dog.<br>
A formulation is considered to be highly effective if, on day 2 and in each case on the second day after reinfestation, an efficacy of &gt; 90% is found, and this action-persists for at least 3 weeks. For calculating the efficacy, a modified formula according to Abbott is used:<br>
