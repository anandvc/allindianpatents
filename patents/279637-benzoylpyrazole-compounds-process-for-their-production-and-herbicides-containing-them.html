TEST EXAMPLE 4<br>
Paddy field soil was put into a 1/1,000,000 hectare pot, and seeds of barnyardgrass (Echinochloa oryzicola vasing.) and Japanese bulrush (Scirpus juncoides) were sown and lightly covered with soil. Then, pot was left<br>
 <br>
61 to stand in a greenhouse in a state irrigated to a water depth of from 0.5 to 1 cm, and next day or two days later, tubers of Japanese ribbon waparo (Sagittaria pygmaea) were planted. Then, the irrigated water depth was maintained to be from 3 to 4 cm, and when barnyardgrass and Japanese bulrush reached 0.5 leaf stage, and Japanese ribbon waparo reached primary leaf stage, a water diluted solution of a wettable powder or an emulsifieable concentrate of the compound of the present invention prepared in accordance with a conventional preparation method, was uniformly dropwise applied by a pipette so that the amount of active ingredients would be a prescribed amount.  Further, paddy field soil was put into a 1/1,000,000 pot, followed by soil puddling to an irrigated water depth of from 3 to 4 cm. Next day, rice<br>
(Oryza sativa L.) (var.: Nihonbare) of two leaf stage was transplanted in a transplantation depth of 3 cm. On the 4th day after transplantation, the compound of the present invention was applied in the same manner as described above.<br>
On the 14th day after application, the State of growth of barnyardgrass, Japanese bulrush and Japanese ribbon waparo was visually observed, and on the 21st day after application, the state of growth of rice was visually observed, and the herbicidal effect was evaluated by a growth inhibition rate (%) of 0<br>
