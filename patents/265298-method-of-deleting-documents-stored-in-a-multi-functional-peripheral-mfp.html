				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to the domain of Multi-function Peripherals (MFPs). Specifically, this invention relates to the field of Local User Interface (LUI) for MFPs. More particularly, this invention relates to a method and system of deleting job / documents in an MFP using shortcut smart delete button.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The presently available MFPs contain storage space such as hard disks that enable users to store various jobs and documents. These jobs and documents can be transferred to the MFPs through various protocols such as FTP, email, HTTP, etc. Jobs and documents of different users can be stored in an MFP in a common shared storage (or directory) in the hard disk. Alternatively, each user can be allocated a separate storage space (or directory). A user can be enabled access to the individual storage space on the MFP after providing some identification information, such as a username and password. Further, the user can also delete the various jobs and documents stored in his individual storage space on the MFP. Usually, the interface provided to clear the individual storage space of all documents and jobs is cumbersome, and can be accessed only through the Embedded Web Server (EWS) of the MFP, or by browsing through a complicated menu on the LUI.<br>
When a user wants to delete all the jobs or documents stored in his individual<br><br>
storage space in an MFP, then there are the following alternatives:<br>
1.	The user can* access the EWS of the MFP through his computer. In this<br>
case he empties his individual storage space and deletes all the jobs and<br>
documents through the EWS.<br>
2.	Alternatively, the user can try to access the MFP through the LUI. In this<br>
case the user has to authenticate himself with the MFP and then browse<br>
through a detailed menu to access the individual storage device and empty<br>
the same.<br>
3.	The MFP may offer an option of deleting all the jobs and documents stored<br>
in the MFP, irrespective of the individual ownership of the different jobs and<br>
documents.<br>
The US patent publication US20060050297A1 titled, "Data control device, method for controlling the same, image output device, and computer program product" describes an image forming device includes a data memory portion for storing files, a printer device for printing images and a communication interface for sending image data. The image forming device further includes a user discrimination portion for discriminating a user who operates the image forming device, a related file extraction portion for searching and extracting files having connection with the discriminated user, a display device for displaying a data list screen for the user to select files to be processed from the extracted files, and a<br><br>
process execution control portion for controlling the printer device, the communication interface or the hard disk drive so as to execute a predetermined process in accordance with the file selected by the user. The patent publication describes an image forming device that includes a data memory portion, and a user discriminating portion, that authenticates users and allows the user to process the stored data. One of the group processes is a multiple file delete function that enables the user to delete all the files for the user using simple menu operations. However, a single* button to delete all the files without the need to navigate through a menu has not been described.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
1.	The process for deleting stored jobs and documents in the MFP through<br>
the LUI is very tedious and requires effort of a user to browse through a<br>
detailed menu on the MFP.<br>
2.	Simpler methods available from the LUI might enable a user to delete all<br>
stored jobs and documents without regard to the ownership of the jobs and<br>
the documents.<br>
3.	There is no shortcut available in an MFP LUI that can easily and smartly<br>
delete all stored jobs and documents in the MFP for a particular user.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention enables a user to easily delete all the jobs and documents stored in his individual storage space in an MFP, through the LUI of the MFP. The LUI of the MFP is provided with a delete button. The user can press this delete button on the LUI (after authenticating himself on the MFP - e.g. by providing a username and a password). By pressing this button it deletes all the jobs and documents stored in the individual storage space of the user in the MFP.<br>
The present invention enables user to delete all his stored jobs and documents in an MFP from the LUI of the MFP by pressing a single direct shortcut smart delete key on the LUI.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method of deleting job / documents stored in a user's individual storage space in an MFP using shortcut delete button comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	providing a smart delete button on the LUI of an MFP;<br>
(b)	logging into the MFP by the user by providing a username and password<br>
associated with the user for authentication;<br>
(c)	pressing the smart delete button to delete the said job/documents by the<br>
user once the* authentication is successful;<br>
(d)	prompting the user to confirm the deletion of the jobs / documents stored in<br>
users individual storage space; and<br><br>
(e) deleting the job/document from the individual storage space if the user confirms the delete.<br>
The delete button is adapted to delete all the jobs / documents stored in a common storage of the MFP by pressing the button if no user has logged on. The said method is used in devices, which store jobs or documents for multiple users, and which offer a local interface for a user to interact and access the device.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a system for deleting job / documents stored in a users individual storage space in an MFP using shortcut delete button comprising:<br>
(a)	a smart delete button provided on the LUI of an MFP;<br>
(b)	means for logging into the MFP by the user by providing a username and<br>
password associated with the user for authentication; and<br>
(c)	means for prompting the user to confirm the deletion of the jobs/documents<br>
stored in users individual storage space,<br>
where the delete button enables the deletion of the said job/documents by the user once the authentication is successful.<br>
The common storage of the MFP is the storage space utilized by un-authenticated or un-authorized users of the MFP. The delete button is adapted to delete all the jobs / documents stored in a common storage of the MFP by pressing the button if no user has logged on.<br><br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Figure 1 is the flow chart of the work flow diagram of the proposed invention.<br>

However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
The present invention relates to Multi-functional Peripherals (MFPs), and particularly to a smart delete button in the MFP that deletes all the jobs and documents for a user stored on a storage device in the MFP. According to the<br><br>
invention, the user first authenticates himself on the MFP, and then presses a delete button. The .pressing of the delete button will cause all the jobs and documents of the user to be deleted at once.<br>
The present invention enables a user to delete all jobs and documents stored in his individual storage space in an MFP through a delete button on the LUI of the MFP.<br>
The present invention provides a smart delete button on the LUI of an MFP. This delete button provides a simple shortcut for a user to delete all the jobs and documents stored in his individual storage space on the MFP.<br>
Figure 1 is the flow chart of the work flow of the proposed invention. A user can utilize the smart delete button on an MFP as follows:<br>
1.	The user logs into the MFP by providing his username and password.<br>
2.	The user then presses the smart delete button.<br>
3.	The user can' be prompted to confirm if he actually wants to delete all the<br>
jobs and documents stored in his individual storage space.<br>
4.	If the user then confirms the delete, all the jobs and documents stored in<br>
the MFP in his individual space are deleted.<br>
The alternatives of the present invention are given below<br><br>
1.	The  smart delete button in the LUI of an MFP can be implemented such<br>
that if no user has logged on (or authenticated himself) at the LUI, then<br>
pressing the button will automatically delete all the jobs and documents<br>
stored in the common storage of the MFP (i.e. in the storage space utilized<br>
by un-authenticated or un-authorized users of the MFP).<br>
2.	The system can be implemented in devices other than MFPs, which store<br>
jobs or documents for multiple users, and which offer a local interface for a<br>
user to interact and access the device. For example, the invention can be<br>
implemented in stand-alone storage devices such as Disk Storage devices<br>
that offer a local interface for the user.<br>
ADVANTAGES<br>
