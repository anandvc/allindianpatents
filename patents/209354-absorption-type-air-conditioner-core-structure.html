The water tray 71 is located below the evaporator heat exchange pipe 61, with the edge of the water tray 71 being aligned with a middle portion of the side liquid and water shielding plates 69.<br>
Referring now to Figures 1, 15, 16 and 17, the absorber 11 comprises an absorber heat exchange pipe 73, an absorber solution spraying pipe 77, a liquid shielding plate 76, a cooling water inlet pipe 75 and a cooling water outlet pipe 74. Above the absorber heat exchange pipe 73 is the absorber solution spraying pipe 77 which is connected to the LTG concentrate solution inlet pipe 81 and the HTG concentrate solution inlet pipe 80. The LTG concentrate solution inlet pipe 81 and the HTG concentrate solution inlet pipe 80 are connected to the concentrate solution outlet pipe of the plate heat exchanger 8. There is the liquid shielding plate 76 from the outer side of the absorber solution spraying pipe 77 down to the absorber heat exchange pipe 73, preferably to the top portion of the absorber heat exchange pipe 73. The cooling water inlet pipe 75 is connected to the outlet pipe of an outside cooling apparatus, and the cooling water pipe 7 connects the cooling water outlet pipe 74 to the cooling water inlet pipe 29 of the condenser 1.<br>
The operating process of the present invention is as follows. Referring now to Figures 1, 8, 9, 10 and 11, when the heat resource in the HTG combustion chamber 55 of the HTG 4 burns and reaches 1200 °C, the dilute solution from the plate heat exchanger 8 passing through the HTG dilute solution<br><br>
inlet pipe 52, is heated to 158 °C around the HTG smoke pipes 59 and the HTG combustion chamber 55. The dilute solution boils and produces a large amount of steam. To prevent the dilute solution from entering the LTG steam inlet pipe 37, the HTG liquid guiding plate 41 blocks the dilute solution from splashing in. At the same time, the smoke releases slowly from the HTG smoke pipes 59 through the wavy fins 56. After releasing a large amount of steam, 57% dilute solution is concentrated to 63% and sinks into the cone shape bottom of the HTG 4, then flows into the plate heat exchanger 8 through the HTG concentrate solution inlet pipe 58, to undergo the heat exchange process, and then flows into the absorber 11 and is sprayed out. Referring now to Figures 4 and 8, the large amount of steam produced by the HTG 4 enters the LTG heat exchange pipe 39 through the LTG steam inlet pipe 37, thereby it heats the dilute solution outside the pipe to 90 °C. The LTG refrigerant steam produced from the dilute solution and the HTG refrigerant steam from the LTG pressure differential capillary tube 31 enter the condenser 1 and condense to water after the heat is released. 57% dilute solution in LTG is concentrated to 63%, then it once again enters the plate heat exchanger 8 through the concentrate solution outlet pipe 27 to undergo the heat exchange process, and enters the absorber 11 and is sprayed out. Referring now to Figures 1, 8, 14 and 17, the cooling water, which comes from the cooling water outlet pipe 74 of the absorber 11 to the cooling water inlet pipe 29 through the cooling water pipe 7, flows through the condenser heat exchange pipe 30, thereby condensing the steam outside the pipe into water; and the heat energy of the LTG 2 is carried away by the cooling water through the cooling water outlet pipe 28 into the cooling apparatus. As refrigerant, the condensed water, from the refrigerant water outlet pipe 49 through the refrigerant water pipe 22 and refrigerant water first time inlet pipe 64, enters the evaporator 10, hence provides cooling by evaporation. Referring now to Figures 1 and 14, the 14°C air conditioning water from the air conditioning system, through the air conditioning water inlet pipe 63, enters the evaporator heat exchange pipe 61. The 4°C refrigerant water of the condenser 1 through the refrigerant water first time inlet<br><br>
pipe 64, and the refrigerant water 72 of the water tray 71 through the refrigerant water second time inlet pipe 65 spray towards the evaporator heat exchange pipe 61. The temperature of the air conditioning water within the evaporator heat exchange pipe 61 reduces to 7°C by evaporation of refrigerant water outside of the evaporator heat exchnge pipe 61; then it, through the air conditioning water outlet pipe 62, enters the air conditioning heat exchange pipe which has an external air fan. The refrigerant water receives the heat energy of the air conditioner system and then changes to steam that is absorbed by the absorber 11. Referring now to the Figures 1 and 17, the lithium bromide solution, which has a concentration of 63% and a temperature of 37°C, has a very strong capacity of absorbing water steam. The concentrate solution from the plate heat exchanger 8 sprays through the absorber solution spraying pipe 77 towards the absorber heat exchange pipe 73. When the concentrate solution absorbs the steam from the evaporator 10, its temperature raises, and its concentration reduces. The absorbed heat of the concentrate solution is carried away by the cooling water that enters absorber heat exchange pipe 73 through the cooling water inlet pipe 75. While the concentrate solution becomes dilute to 57%, and it is pumped by the solution pump 19 to the plate heat exchanger 8, in there this solution involves in the heat exchange process. This solution is then sent to the HTG 4 and the LTG 2, respectively, to be heated and condensed. The above-described process is repeated continuously to maintain the normal operation of the air conditioner.<br>
The advantages of the present invention are as follows:<br>
1. It is a breakthrough of the structure of the traditional absorption-type air conditioner. The condenser 1, LTG 2 and HTG 4 are in one vessel. Above the HTG 4 is the LTG 2, and above the LTG 2 is condenser 1. This structure substantially reduces outward leakage. The upper vessel 24 has only one long welding seam, therefore it has a superior vacuum condition and a compact<br><br>
structure. There is a proper heat exchange gradient between the HTG and the LTG. The temperature in the HTG 4 is the highest, the temperature in the LTG 2 is in the middle, and the temperature in the condenser 1 is the lowest. The heat exchange pipes of the condenser 1, LTG 2, evaporator 10 and absorber 11 are all helical copper pipes, which has high heat exchange efficiency.<br>
2.	In the upper vessel 24 there are non-metal insulation boards 34 between the HTG 4 and the LTG 2, and between the LTG 2 and the condenser 1.<br>
3.	When the steam of the LTG 2 enters the condenser 1 and then condenses into water the pressure difference is very large. The present invention utilizes a very long helical LTG pressure differential capillary tube 31 to increase the resistance for entering the condenser, and adjust the pressure between the LTG 2 and the condenser 1.<br>
4.	The structural arrangement for the concentrate solution exiting the HTG 4 and the dilute solution entering the HTG 4, and the dilute solution exiting the LTG 2 and the concentrate solution entering the LTG 2, has the solutions entering and existing at high positions, therefore maintains very stable solution level. This ensures that the HTG smoke pipes 59 and the upper vessel 24 are not burned out, and prevents the solution from being either over concentrate or over dilute. Furthermore, it ensures every HTG smoke pipes 59 having sufficient heat exchange.<br>
5.	The HTG 4 has an eccentrical HTG combustion chamber, and a rear sealing end that can release the smoke through the HTG smoke pipes 59. The bottom of the HTG 4 has a cone-shape similar to the bottom of a pan, which can effectively separate the concentrate solution from the dilute solution. The concentrate solution can be retrieved from the bottom of the pan, and the equilibrium tube 51 can release the gas in the concentrate solution into the steam<br><br>
chamber of the HTG.  Furthermore, the HTG liquid guiding plate 41 can prevent the boiling solution from splashing into the LTG steam inlet pipe 37.<br>
6.	The evaporator 10 and the absorber 11 has the inner water shielding plate 68 and the liquid shielding plate 76, respectively. The evaporator 10 further has the outer liquid shielding plate 67. With these covers, the refrigerant water cannot spray to the outside, at the same time, the solution from the outside can not come in. Furthermore, between the evaporator 10 and the absorber 11 there is the side liquid and water shielding plate 69. The solution of the absorber 11 also cannot enter the evaporator 10. Therefore, the solution does not contaminate the refrigerant water, and the refrigerating operation of the system can be assured.<br>
7.	The plate heat exchanger 8 is located within the lower vessel 21. All four solution pipes of the absorber 11, for the concentrate solution in and the dilute solution out, are within the lower vessel 21. Even if there is a small amount of leakage, it will not influence vacuum level of the whole system. At the same time, the four solution pipes between the upper vessel 24 and the lower vessel 21 are all surrounded by the solution pipe protecting cover 23. The solution pipe protecting cover 23 can be welded conveniently.<br>
8.	The upper vessel 24, lower vessel 21 and solution pipe protecting cover 23 have few welding seams, which can meet the requirement of the high level vacuum.<br>
Because of its compact structure, small volume, few welding seams, high level vacuum, and having the heat exchange pipes (30, 39, 61, 73) of the condenser 1, LTG 2, evaporator 10 and absorber 11 all made of helical copper pipes, the air conditioner core structure of the present invention has high heat exchange efficiency.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
