I he present invention relates to novel polymorphic forms of quetiapine fumarate, processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical compositions containing them.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
2-[2-(4-Dibenzo[b,f]-[1,4]thiazepin-11-yl-1-piperazinyl)ethoxy]ethanol (quetiapine) and its salts were disclosed in Eur. Pat. No. 0240228 and they are useful for their antidopaminergic activity, for example, as an antipsychotic or neuroleptic.<br>
Various processes for preparation of quetiapine and 2-[2-(4-Dibenzo[b,f]-[1,4]thiazepin-11 -yl-1 -piperazinyl)ethoxy]ethanol hemifumarate (quetiapine fumarate) were described in EP 0240 228, EP 0282236, WO 01/55125 and WO 99/06381. According to the teachings of literature, quetiapine fumarate was crystallized from ethanolic solution containing quetiapine free base and fumaric acid. Quetiapine fumarate prepared according this method fails to produce well defined reproducible crystalline form.<br>
It has now been discovered stable, reproducible two crystalline forms of quetiapine fumarate. It has also been discovered that the crystalline forms of quetiapine fumarate can be obtained in very pure state. Thus, they can be used as active ingredients in pharmaceutical preparations.<br>
Thus, the object of the present invention is to provide quetiapine fumarate in stable and reproducible crystalline forms, processes for their preparation and pharmaceutical composition containing them.<br>
The present invention also provides amorphous form of quetiapine with adequate stability and good dissolution properties.<br>
Thus another object of the present invention is to provide amorphous form of quetiapine fumarate, a process for preparing it and a pharmaceutical composition containing it.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a novel crystalline form of quetiapine fumarate, which is designated as form I. Quetiapine fumarate crystalline Form I is characterized by x-ray powder diffraction pattern having significant reflections expressed as 29 values at about 7.3, 9.2, 11.6, 13.3, 14.4, 14.8, 15.3, 15.9, 16.2, 16.7, 17.6, 19.1, 19.7, 20.1, 20.8, 21.1, 21.8, 22.3, 23.4, 24.3, 24.7, 25.1, 25.6, 27.1, 28.5, 29.5, 33.2, 40.4 deg.<br><br>
x-Ray powder diffractogram of quetiapine fumarate crystalline Form I is shown in Figure 1 . The major peaks and their intensities of x-ray powder diffractogram are shown in Table 1. The intensities of the reflections are expressed as percent of most intense reflection.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a process for the preparation of quetiapine fumarate crystalline Form I.<br>
Quetiapine fumarate crystalline Form I is prepared by dissolving quetiapine free base and fumaric acid in a suitable solvent and crystallizing fumarate salt. This crystallization from the suitable solvent is an effective method of removing impurities.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention thus provides quetiapine fumarate crystalline Form I which is substantially pure, for example at least 98 % preferably at least 99 %, more preferably at least 99.5 % pure.<br>
Preferably molar ratio of quetiapine free base to fumaric acid is between about 1:0.4 to about 1:1.<br>
The suitable solvents are ketones like acetone, methyl iso butyl ketone; esters like ethyl acetate, ethyl formate, methyl acetate; and mixture thereof.<br>
The preparation of quetiapine free base is described, for example in EP 0240228.<br>
Crystallization of quetiapine fumarate from solution may be initiated by conventional means such as addition of a non-solvent, evaporation of solvent, cooling or seeding the solution.<br>
The present invention also provides another novel crystalline form of quetiapine fumarate, which is designated as Form II. Quetiapine fumarate crystalline Form II is characterized by x-ray powder diffraction pattern having significant reflections expressed as 29 values at about 4.9, 7.4, 9.2, 11.7, 13.4, 14.4, 14.9, 15.4, 15.9, 16.3, 16.7, 17.7, 18.6, 19.8, 20.2, 20.8, 21.2, 21.9, 22.4, 22.9, 23.4, 24.3, 24.7, 25.2, 25.7, 26.9, 27.8, 28.8, 29.4, 33.2, 35.9, 38.0, 38.7, 39.9, 42.8 deg.<br>
x-Ray powder diffractogram of quetiapine fumarate Form II is shown in Fig. 2. The major peaks and their intensities of x-ray powder diffractogram are shown in table 2. The intensities of the peaks are expressed as percent of most intense reflection.<br><br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a process for the preparation of quetiapine fumarte Form II.<br>
Quetiapine fumarate crystalline Form II is prepared by dissolving quetiapine free base in methyl tert. butyl ether, heating to reflux, adding fumaric acid at reflux, maintaining at reflux for about 30 minutes to about 1 hour, cooling to 20-30°C, maintaining for about 30 minutes with or without stirring, optionally seeding with quetiapine fumarate crystalline Form II, filtering and washing the crystals formed with methyl tert. butyl ether.<br>
Preferably molar ratio of quetiapine free base to fumaric acid is between about 1:0.4 to about 1:1.<br>
The present invention also provides a novel amorphous form of quetiapine fumarate, which is designated as amorphous quetiapine fumarate. The amorphous quetiapine fumarate is characterized by having broad x-ray diffraction maximum expressed as 20 between about 10 and about 30 deg.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a process for the preparation of amorphous quetiapine fumarate. Amorphous quetiapine fumarate may be prepared by dissolving quetiapine fumarate in a solvent mixture, removing the solvent from the solution. Quetiapine fumarate crystalline Form I or Form II, which are obtained as described herein above, or quetiapine fumarate obtained by previously known methods may be used for the preparation of amorphous quetiapine fumarate.<br>
The solvent mixture comprises chloroform and methanol in a ratio between about 1:0.5 and 1:2 volume/volume, preferably in the ratio of 1:1 volume/volume. The solvent can be removed form the solution by techniques such as vacuum drying or spray drying.<br>
A further aspect of the present invention provides a pharmaceutical composition comprising an effective amount of quetiapine fumarate polymorphic form and a pharmaceutical^ acceptable carrier.<br>
The quetiapine fumarate polymorphic forms include quetiapine fumarate crystalline Form I, quetiapine fumarate crystalline Form II and amorphous quetiapine fumarate.<br>
