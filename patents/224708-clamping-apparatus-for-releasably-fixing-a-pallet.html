				<td>CLAMPING APPARATUS FOR RELEASABLY FIXING A PALLET<br>
The present invention refers to a clamping apparatus compri's<br>
ing a chuck member and a pallet member adapted to be releasably<br>
fixed to the chuck member. The chuck member comprises clamping<br>
means for clamping the pallet to the chuck member and first cen-<br>
tering means, while the pallet member has second centering means<br>
adapted to cooperate with the first centering means to define the<br>
relative position between the chuck member and the pallet.<br>
. Clamping apparatuses of the kind mentioned above are mainly-<br>
used to fix work pieces in a positionally well defined manner in<br>
the machining area of a machine tool. Thereby, the work piece<br>
first is fixed to a pallet and then, the pallet is releasably at-<br>
tached to the chuck member. Alternatively, the work piece itself<br>
can constitute the pallet. In most cases, the chuck member itself<br>
is fixedly attached to the machine tool. Commonly, such clamping<br>
apparatuses are used with milling, grinding, polishing and erosion<br>
machines.<br>
A problem in machining the work piece may exist insofar as<br>
the machining tool and/or machining fluid jets can excite the<br>
clamping apparatus to vibrations, thereby impairing the quality, of<br>
machining of the work piece.<br>
. The document EP-A-1 044 763 discloses a holder for exactly<br>
positioning a work piece in the machining area of a machine tool,<br>
the holder being provided with a vibration damper. By providing<br>
such a damper, the problems mentioned herein before should be<br>
avoided. On the one hand, the holder comprises connecting elements<br>
for attaching it to a fixed supporting structure and, on the other<br>
hand, fixing means for holding the work piece. The holder is in<br>
the form of a so-called leveling or pendulum head to which a work<br>
piece is fixed and which can be finely adjusted in three direc-<br>
tions. Thereby, the work piece can be very exactly positioned with<br>
regard to the machine tool. The above mentioned vibration damper <br>
is intended to absorb the vibration energy induced into the holder<br>
through the work piece by the rinsing fluid during an electro ero-<br>
is intended to absorb the vibration energy induced into the holder<br>
through the work piece by the rinsing fluid during an electro ero-<br>
sive machining process. As materials for the damper, particularly<br>
rubber or rubber-like materials are suggested.<br>
The document DE-A-199 17 104 discloses another holder pro-<br>
vided with a vibration damper. Besides the vibration damper, a re-<br>
gion of the holder is provided in which the holder and the sup-<br>
porting structure and/or the work piece are in direct contact.<br>
Thereby, a connection shall be realized that is partially hard and<br>
partially damped. Such a holder is said to be particularly useful<br>
in connection with work pieces subjected to a cutting or lapping<br>
operation.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a clamp-<br>
ing apparatus of the kind referred to herein above incorporating a<br>
damping element that is stable, has a high rigidity and, simulta-<br>
neously, provides excellent dampi^ng^characteristic^.<br>
To meet this and other objects, the present invention pro-<br>
vides a clamping apparatus comprising a chuck member and a pallet<br>
member releasably fixed to the chuck member. The chuck member com-<br>
prises clamping means for clamping the pallet to the chuck member.<br>
The chuck member has first centering means and the pallet member<br>
has second centering means cooperating with the first centering<br>
means to define the relative position between the chuck member and<br>
the pallet. The chuck member and/or the pallet member are/is pro-<br>
vided with at least one damping element consisting at least par-<br>
tially of a compressed composite of metal chips.<br>
A damping element consisting of a compressed composite of<br>
metal chips is relatively stiff and provides very good damping<br>
properties in view of the load to be expected during machining a<br>
work piece fixed to the chuck and the pallet, respectively.<br>
In the following, an embodiment of the apparatus according to<br>
the invention will be further described, with reference to the ac-<br>
companying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a perspective view of a chuck and a pallet; and<br>
Fig. 2 shows a longitudinal sectional view of the chuck and<br>
the pallet of Fig. 1.<br>
With reference to Fig. 1, there is shown a perspective view<br>
of the chuck 1 and the pallet 2 including some additional elements<br>
to be explained in more detail herein below. The chuck essentially<br>
comprises a lower portion 3 and an upper portion 4. The lower por-<br>
tion 3 of the chuck 1 includes a circular base plate 5, a circular<br>
support plate 6 and a damping element 7 inserted between the above<br>
mentioned circular base and support plates 5, 6. The upper portion<br>
4 of the chuck 1 comprises a cylindrical clamping housing 8, the<br>
interior thereof being provided with clamping elements in the form<br>
a clamping balls (not shown in Fig. 1), and the top thereof being<br>
provided with centering elements in the form of protruding center-<br>
ing pins 9. The base plate 5 is attached to a machining apparatus<br>
(not shown) by means of fixing elements 11. The support plate 6 is<br>
attached to the base plate 5 by means of screws 12 adapted to be<br>
screwed into anchor nuts 13. For receiving these anchor nuts 13,<br>
the bottom of the support plate 6 is provided with blind holes<br>
(not shown in Fig. 1) . The anchor nuts are manufactured of a duc-<br>
tile, but nevertheless elastic material and provided with a cen-<br>
tral thread made of steel. The end portion of the anchor nuts 13<br>
facing the base plate 5 are provided with a shoulder 13a, the pur-<br>
pose thereof being explained in more detail herein below.<br>
The clamping housing 8 is fixed to the support plate 6 by<br>
means of screws 14 as well. For receiving the damping element 7,<br>
both the base plate 5 and the support plate are provided with cir-<br>
cular recesses corresponding in size to the diameter of the circu-<br>
lar damping element 7, whereby only the recess 15 provided in the<br>
base plate 5 is visible in Fig. 1.<br>
The pallet 2 comprises a circular base plate 17 and a circu-<br>
lar support plate 18. The bottom of the base plate 17 is provided<br>
with a clamping pin 19 by means of which the pallet 2 can be<br>
clamped to the chuck 1. Moreover, fixed to the bottom of the base<br>
plate 17, a elastically resilient disk (not shown in Fig. 1) is<br>
provided that comprises a plurality of groove-like recesses, which<br>
correspond to the centering pins 9 of the chuck 1 as far as shape<br>
and position is concerned and which serve for determining the po-<br>
sition of the pallet 2 with regard to the chuck 1 in X- and Y-<br>
direction. Also in this case, a damping element 20 is inserted be-<br>
tween the base plate 17 and the support plate 18. Similarly, both<br>
plates 17 and 18 are provided with circular recesses corresponding<br>
in size to the diameter of the circular damping element 20,<br>
whereby only the recess 2'1 provided in the base plate 17 is visi-<br>
ble in Fig. 1.<br>
In the present example, the support plate 18 is designed as<br>
an integral part of the pallet 2. For fixing the work piece to be<br>
machined, the top of the support plate 18 is provided with fixing<br>
elements, e.g. in the form of bores, which are, however, not visi-<br>
ble in Fig. 1.<br>
Both the damping element 7 of the chuck 1 and the damping<br>
element 20 of the pallet 2 comprise a plurality of steel chips or<br>
swarfs that are compressed under pressure to a squeezed composite<br>
of steel chips. The pressure by which the chips are compressed to<br>
a composite can amount to between some ten kN up to several hun-<br>
dreds kN. Depending on the particular application, the compressed<br>
composite of steel chips can be embedded in a pott^nt. Preferably,<br>
the damping elements 7, 20 have an essentially cylindrical shape;<br>
however, it is also possible to use square or annular damping ele-<br>
ments .<br>
Fig. 2 shows a longitudinal sectional view of the chuck 1 and<br>
the pallet 2. In this view, it can be clearly seen that the sup-<br>
port plate 6 and the base plate 5 are attached to each other by<br>
means of screws 12. The screws 12 are received in the anchor nuts<br>
13, the latter ones expanding radially upon screwing in the screws<br>
12. Thus, the anchor nuts 13 are rigidly fixed in the blind holes<br>
24 of the support plate 6. Due to the fact that the screws 12 are<br>
fixed to the support plate 6 by means of ductile, but elastic an-<br>
chor nuts 13, an elastic connection results between the support<br>
plate 6 and the base plate 12 via the screws 12. Moreover, besides<br>
the connection by means of the screws 12, the two plates 5, 6 are<br>
attached to each other by means of the damping element 7 .<br>
The thickness of the damping element 7 is chosen such that a<br>
gap S remains between the support plate 6 and the base plate 5<br>
once the screws 12 have been tightened. Thereby, the thickness of<br>
the shoulder 13a of the anchor nuts 13 is adjusted to the excess<br>
thickness of the damping element 7, with the result that it is<br>
avoided that the two plates 5, 6 are bent upon tightening the<br>
screws 12. Preferably, the gap S is filled with a pottant or at<br>
least sealed along its edge to prevent any dust, fluids, chips or<br>
similar from penetrating into the gap S.<br>
Furthermore, Fig. 2 shows the elastically resilient disk 10<br>
fixed to the bottom of the pallet 2 and provided with a plurality<br>
of groove-like recesses, which correspond to the centering pins 9<br>
of the chuck 1 as far as shape and position is concerned and which<br>
serve for determining the position of the pallet 2 with regard to<br>
the chuck 1 in X- and Y-directions. For positioning the pallet 2<br>
in Z-direction, distance pins are provided (not shown in Fig. 2),<br>
preferably attached to the pallet 2. As is known in the art, the<br>
pallet 2 is clamped to the chuck 1 by means of clamping balls 23<br>
engaging a shoulder of the clamping pin 19 of the pallet 2.<br>
The damping element 20 located between the base plate 17 and<br>
the support plate 18 is attached by means of adhesive. To this<br>
end, the damping element 20 is glued both into the recess 21 of<br>
the base plate and into the recess 22 of the support plate. Also<br>
in this case, a small gap remains between the two plates 17, 18,<br>
but amounting only to a few tenths of a millimeter. Again, the gap<br>
is preferably filled with a pottant or at least sealed along its<br>
edge. This alternative possibility of fixing the damping plate 2 0<br>
shows the advantage that no further connection exists between the<br>
two plates 17, 18 that could have an adverse impact on the damping<br>
properties. It is understood that the kind of fixing the damping<br>
element can be chosen to meet the different demands of a particu-<br>
lar application.<br>
Even if both the chuck 1 and the pallet 2 are provided with a<br>
damping element 7, 20 in the embodiment shown in the drawings and<br>
explained herein above, it may be sufficient, depending on the<br>
particular application, to provide only the chuck 1 with a damping<br>
element 20, or to provide only the pallet 2 with a damping element<br>
7. Moreover, the damping characteristics of the damping elements<br>
7, 20, consisting of a plurality of steel chips, compacted to a<br>
compressed composite of metal chips by high pressure, can be var-<br>
ied. As parameters influencing the damping characteristics of the<br>
damping elements 7, 20, the size and the thickness of the steel<br>
chips, the size and the thickness of the entire composite, the ma-<br>
terial of the chips, and the pressure applied to form the compos-<br>
ite can be named.<br>
