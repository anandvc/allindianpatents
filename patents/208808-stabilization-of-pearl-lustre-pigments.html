				<td>Stabilization of pearl lustre pigments<br>
The invention relates to aftercoated pearl lustre pigments and to a process for preparing them. The invention further relates to the use of these pigments.<br>
EP 0 632 109 BI discloses pearl lustre pigments which for use in coating compositions are subjected to an aftertreatment in order to enhance their stability.<br>
The  pearl  lustre  pigments  known  from  EP 0 632 109 possess the following general layer sequence: the first "layer"  is formed by the substrate,  e.g. mica,  the second layer is a metal oxide layer,  e.g.  titanium dioxide or iron (III) oxide, and these two layers form the  base  pigment.  Atop the  calcined base pigment, beginning with a third layer, the aftercoating, as it is known, is applied. The third layer comprises oxides, hydroxides  and/or  oxide  hydrates  of  silicon  or aluminium,   the   fourth   layer   comprises   oxides, hydroxides and/or oxide hydrates of silicon, aluminium, zirconium and/or cerium,  and is different from the third   layer,   and  the   fifth   layer   comprises organofunctional  coupling  agents,  e.g.  silanes  or zirconium aluminates.<br>
Despite the stabilizing aftercoating of layers three to five described above, the pearl lustre pigments, especially those based on mica and coated in the second layer with iron (III) oxide, are unsuitable for use in all fields, since under extreme stresses even higher stability of the pigments would be necessary.<br>
Similar comments apply, in particular, to the micabased pearl lustre pigments coated in the second layer with titanium dioxide or other metal oxides, such as chromium oxide, zirconium dioxide, tin dioxide or zinc oxide; although they are in many cases more stable than<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
the iron(III) oxide-coated micas, they likewise cannot be used without restrictions.<br>
The aftercoated pearl lustre pigments known from the prior art, furthermore, possess the disadvantage that their orientation in coating films is not optimal; in other words, an improvement in the parallel alignment of the pigments with respect to the film coat would be desirable in order to enhance the lustre properties.<br>
One of the objects of the invention was to increase the stability of such pigments and to provide pigments which possess improved orientation within coating films.<br>
This object has been achieved in accordance with the invention by the provision of pigments having the following layer sequence:<br>
a  first  layer,  consisting  of  a  platelet-shaped<br>
substrate,<br>
a  second layer,<br>
comprising one or more metal oxides,<br>
the first and second layers forming a calcined<br>
base pigment, a third layer, comprising the corresponding<br>
uncalcined oxide, hydroxide or oxide hydrate of<br>
the oxide of the second layer, a fourth layer, comprising oxides, hydroxides and/or<br>
oxide hydrates of silicon or aluminium, a fifth layer, comprising oxides, hydroxides and/or<br>
oxide hydrates of silicon,  aluminium,  zirconium<br>
and/or  cerium,  this  layer  differing  from  the<br>
fourth layer, and a sixth layer, comprising one or more organofunctional<br>
coupling agents.<br>
The third layer in this sequence adopts the function of an adhesion promoter and embraces preferably from 0.1<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
to 10% by weight, more preferably from 1 to 5% by weight, based on the base pigment.<br>
Suitable platelet-shaped substrates for the base pigment are the substrates specified in EP 632 109 81, such as mica, kaolin or glass, for example. Particular preference is given,  however,  to mica as the base<br>
substrate.<br>
Suitable metal oxides of the second layer are, for example, iron(III) oxide and/or titanium dioxide or other metal oxides, such as chromium oxide, zirconium dioxide, tin dioxide or zinc oxide, and the oxides may also be present in mixtures. Particularly high improvements over the pearl lustre pigments known from EP 632 109 Bl are achieved in the case of the iron(III) oxide-coated substrates.<br>
Suitable coupling agents are the coupling agents disclosed in EP 632 109 Bl. They include, in particular, silanes, zirconium aluminates, zirconates or titanates, the silanes preferably possessing the structure Y-(CH2)n-SiX3 in, which Y is an organofunctional group, e.g. an amino, methacrylic, vinyl and/or epoxy group, and X is a silicon-functional group which following its hydrolysis reacts with active sites of an inorganic substrate or by condensation with other silicon compounds. The group in question may comprise, for example, an alkoxy group.<br>
In addition to these substantially hydrophilic coupling agents, it is also possible to use hydrophobic silanes, especially the aryl-, alkyl- and fluoroalkylsubstituted di- and trimethoxysilanes. These include, for example, phenethyltrimethoxysilane, propyltrimethoxysilane, butyltrimethoxysilane, isobutyltrimethoxysilane, hexyltrimethoxysilane, octyltrimethoxysilane, 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecyltrimethoxysilane and (3, 3, 3-trifluoropropyl)methyldimethoxysilane.<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
A further object was to provide a process for obtaining the pearl  lustre pigments of the invention.<br>
This object has been achieved by the provision of a multistage process in which the calcined, platelet-shaped substrate coated with one or more metal oxides is suspended in water, heated at from 25 to 100°C, preferably from 40 to 80°C, and adjusted to a pH of from 3 to 11, preferably from 5 to 9, in a first stage one or more water-soluble metal salts are added which correspond to the calcined metal oxides of the metal oxide coating of the platelet-shaped substrate, these salts are deposited in whole or in part as oxide, hydroxide and/or oxide hydrate, followed by heating at from 30 to 100°C, preferably from 40 to 75°C, and adjustment to a pH of from 3 to 9, preferably from 6 to 7, in a second stage a water-soluble silicate and/or aluminium salt is added, and is deposited in whole or in part as oxide, hydroxide and/or oxide hydrate, in a third stage, by adding at least one water-soluble silicate, aluminium salt, cerium salt and/or zirconium salt at a pH in the range from 3 to 9, preferably from 6 to 7, the corresponding oxides, hydroxides or oxide hydrates thereof are deposited, it being necessary for these to differ from those of the second stage, and in a fourth stage at least one organic coupling agent is added and is deposited at a pH of from 3 to 9, preferably from 6 to 8.<br>
As calcined platelet-shaped substrates coated with metal oxides it is possible to use the substrates already mentioned above with the abovementioned metal oxide coatings, which are available commercially under the designation Iriodin® (manufacturer; B. Merck, Darmstadt).<br>
A suitable water-soluble silicate is preferably sodium silicate; suitable  water-soluble  aluminium  salts,<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
cerium salts and zirconium salts are, in general,	all<br>
water-soluble  salts  of  these  metals,  although	the<br>
readily obtainable halides and halide hydrates,	for<br>
example, are appropriate.<br>
Coupling reagents used are preferably those mentioned above.<br>
The aftercoating process of the invention may be carried out as described above in one operation without isolating and working up the pigment after the first precipitation reaction (first stage). However, it is also possible to isolate the pigment after the first stage, i.e., after the application of the adhesion-promoting layer.<br>
The pearl lustre pigments coated in accordance with the invention are employed in particular in connection with the pigmenting of inks, such as printing inks, for example, and plastics, such as polymer films, for example, and also coating compositions, such as paints, for example. However, they are also employed in other areas in which the abovementioned improved properties play a part, such as"' in the pigmentation of cosmetics, for example.<br>
In the text below, the invention is illustrated with reference to examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Different pearl lustre pigments were aftercoated by means of the aftertreatment process of the invention.<br>

The suspension is adjusted to a pH of 9.0 using 2.5% NaOH (all stated pH values are determined using appropriate pH indicator paper).<br>
Over the course of approximately 30 minutes, a solution of 18.66 g of FeCl3 in 74.64 g of deionized water (corresponding to a 3% FeCl3 solution) is added dropwise to the suspension. The pH falls over the course of 5 minutes to 3.2 and is kept constant at this level using 10% sodium hydroxide solution. After the endpoint has been reached, the pigment suspension is adjusted to a pH of 5.0 and is subsequently stirred for approximately 15 minutes.<br>
Subsequently, over the course of 30 minutes, a solution of 2.7 ml of sodium silicate (370 g of Si02 per litre) in 150 ml of deionized water is added dropwise to the pigment suspension. The pH.is kept constant using 2.5% hydrochloric acid. After the end of the addition, stirring is continued at 40°C for 15 minutes. Thereafter the pH is adjusted to 6.5 over the course of 10 minutes using 2.5% hydrochloric acid and the suspension is subsequently stirred at 40°C for 15 minutes. Then 1-35 g of sodium sulfate, 2.30 g of aluminium chloride hexahydrate and 1.10 g of cerium(II) chloride heptahydrate, as solids, are added to the suspension, the pH dropping to 4.0.<br>

dried at 110°C for approximately 16 h.<br>
The modified pigment thus obtained is suspended in<br>
