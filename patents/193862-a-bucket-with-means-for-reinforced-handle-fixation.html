				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to a vessel provided with a bucket handle.<br>
Vessels provided with different types of handles are well known. These handles are usually fitted towards the mouth of the vessel and one or two handles are usually provided For relatively small vessels such as buckets that are usually lifted up by a single operator a single bucket handle stretching across the vessel and capable of hinged movement to both sides of die vessel is preferred Aluminium and iron buckets having the above type of handle generally have the rigid bucket handle provided with hinged fitting on to two suspension blocks provided on opposite sides of the vessel towards the top. The suspension blocks are generally fitted to the cup shaped bucket through rivets. Riveting is the preferred form of fitting not only because it is economical but also because the generally thin walled bucket sidewall does not readily lend itself to efficient and quick welding, Ilie above method of fitting the two suspension blocks by rivets works well enough for GI buckets and ths riveted suspension blocks are usually damaged only when the whole bucket is damaged. But the same cannot be said of aluminium buckets having a single rigid handle provided with hinged fitting on to two suspension blocks that are riveted to the vessel wall. It is a common sight to see many of these old buckets with loosened or lost suspension blocks as the aluminium riveting does not stand for too long the heavy duties to which these buckets are put to. For smaller metal vessels provided with such a hinged bucket handle the riveted joints getting weak is not so much of a problem as they are not usually put to rough use. For larger vessels with a thick sidewall and generally two handles lifted by two operators together, the riveted (or welded) joints are very strong and the above problem does not usually arise. Vessels having a relatively thin side wall and a bucket handle are provided with an annularly disposed thickened or rolled out edge, lip or bulge at the top to give structural strength to the vessel and it is for this type of vessels the invention is particularly aimed at. Similar problems exist for plastic buckets also. The object of this invention is to provide a means whereby the forces acting through the handle are efficiently distributed around the vessel, said means also preventing deformation of the vessel and detachment of its handle.<br>
Accordingly this invention provides a vessel provided with a rigid bucket handle stretching across the vessel and capable of hinged movement, said handle being provided towards its two ends with means for hinged mounting on opposite sides of the vessel towards the top of the latter, characterized in that a suspension bracket is provided on the vessel externally, means provided for locating said suspension bracket on to the vessel and means provided for hinged mounting of said bucket handle towards its two ends on to the said suspension bracket, said suspension bracket stretching between the two attached ends of the said bucket handle along the circumference of the<br><br>
vessel towards the top at least on one side of the vessel and/or as a sling under and across ttie oase of the vessel and dimensioned to abut on to the said base of the vessel.<br>
The invention is particularly valuable for vessels having an outwardly inclined vessel wall towards the top and/or an outward lip* bulge, thickened, folded or rolled out edge towards the top, said suspension bracket provided around the vessel towards the top being dimensioned to abut on to the said outwardly jutting top edge of the vessel and/or on to the said outwardly inclined vessel wall towards the top of the vessel. The suspension bracket is generally U shaped (for the suspension bracket passing under the base of the vessel) or is horizontal C shaped or ring shaped (for the suspension brackets provided around the vessel towards the top) and stretches between the two hingedly mounted ends of the bucket handle. For the suspension bracket provided around the vessel towards the top the suspension bracket is preferably vertically rigid and at least to a less extent also horizontally rigid so as to bear the stresses transmitted through the said handle. This vertically rigid suspension bracket preferably comprises a strap members) disposed lengthwise along the circumference of the vessel and breadth wise vertically along the vessel wall. This shape of the suspension bracket has the minimum weight The strap members comprising the suspension bracket are usually fixed to the metal vessel through rivets. So as to give additional strength at the point of suspension an additional suspension strip with a hole through which the handle is passed is provided adjacent to (external or internal to) the said spaced projection of the suspension bracket (having a hole for suspending the tip of the handle), said additional suspension strip being riveted or welded on its two sides to the suspension bracket and /or on to the vessel wall. In the popular model of die metal bucket having two holed suspension blocks fixed to the vessel wall externally through rivets, the holed projections of the suspension blocks extending above the top edge of the vessel, the suspension blocks are joined together integrally, directly (one over the other) or through a joining member to form the reinforced bucket according to the invention. The metal suspension blocks (which are usually produced by casting) are generally thicker than the vessel wall and therefore amenable to easy welding. Therefore the suspension blocks may be integrally joined together by welding a vertical U shaped, horizontal C shaped or ring shaped joining raember(s) on to the said suspension blocks^ Riveting is the preferred form of direct joining for metal vessels and is also preferred for the indirect joining through a joining member(s). The invention limits itself to a bucket with a rigid vessel wall and having a hingedly attached rigid bucket handle and having a volume capacity ranging between 2 litres and 100 litres- these buckets are usually made of metal or plastic, the plastic buckets being usually provided with a metal suspension bracket and a metal handle.<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein:<br><br>
Fig.l:   is die pictorial view of a bucket W8&amp;A with<rc handle according to the invention></rc>
Fig.2;   is the sectional plan of the bucket shown in Fig.l, the section passing through the horizontal<br>
plane X-X (just below the rolled out top edge of the bucket) shown in Fig.l;<br>

plane X-X shown in Fig.3;	% ♦<br>
Fig.5: is the sectional plan of another bucket £tteri with** handle according to the invention, the<br>
bucket and its section being similar to the one shown in Figs.3 to 4;<br>
Fig.6: is the sectional plan of a part of another bucket according to die invention, die bucket and its<br>
section being similar to die one shown in Figs. 3 and 4;<br>
Fig.7: is the side elevation of another bucket according to the invention;<br>
* Fig.8: is the bottom view of the base of the bucket shown in Fig.7.<br>
■*    As shown in the figures the vessel V (a bucket) provided with a rigid bucket handle H stretching across the vessel is provided with hinged mounting at its two ends on to the suspension bracket S provided externally on the vessel. The vessel V has an outwardly turned lip D at the top that gives structural strength to die mouth of die vessel. The hinged mounting of die handle H is effected by passing die two ends of the rigid handle H through holes L provided on the suspension bracket S diereby transmitting die load on to die vessel through die suspension bracket. In die embodiments illustrated die suspension bracket is vertical U shaped or ring shaped but it may also be horizontal C shaped, extending between the two ends of the handle H. Metal buckets are illustrated in Figs.l to 8 and die means for locating the suspension bracket on to the vessel is through rivets R.<br>
In the bucket shown in Figs. 1 to 2, the handle H is suspended through two oppositely placed holed projections of the suspension blocks B, B, said holed projections extending above die top edge of die vessel. The suspension bracket S comprises of die two horizontal C shaped suspension blocks B3 with the limbs of the C directly (one over the other) joined togetiier and fixed to the vessel wall through rivets R. Two rivets R are provided on each side for fixing tiie limbs of die two Cs that meet each other so as to provide an efficient interlock. The handle blocks according to this embodiment are usually made by casting and are usually thicker than the vessel wall. Therefore instead of riveting, the limbs of the two Cs that meet each other may also be welded together.<br>
In die bucket shown in Figs.3 to 4, strap like suspension blocks having projections positioned spaced from the vessel wall on opposite sides of the vessel are provided with holes L disposed below die top edge of die vessel, die ends of the handle H being suspended dirough tiie said holes. It is customary to provide small outward projections at the ends of die handle H (as shown in die<br><br>
figures), said outward projections being dimensioned to abut from the inside on to the edges of the said holes L. The suspension bracket S in this embodiment comprises a single horizontal C shaped strap embracing the vessel with the limbs of the C joined together and fixed to the vessel wall through rivets R. Two spaced rivets are provided for fixing the two limbs of the C together so as to provide an efficient interlock The suspension bracket is also riveted to the vessel wail by rivets placed adjacent to the suspension holes L as in conventional buckets. In the bucket shown in Fig.5, die two suspension blocks B, B disposed on opposite sides of the vessel are joined together by the straps T, T and the blocks along with the vertically rigid straps are fixed to the vessel wall through rivets R. For aluminium buckets relatively thick aluminium straps T, T may also be welded to the conventional short handle blocks (provided with holed projections extending above the top of the vessel) to constitute the suspension bracket as the short aluminium handle blocks which are produced by casting are usually very thick. This modification of die conventional aluminium bucket is a preferred embodiment according to the invention.<br>
The bucket shown in Fig. 6 is similar to the one shown in Figs.3 to 4 except that the additional suspension strip A (with a hole through which the handle is passed) is provided external to the stepped projection of the suspension bracket S, said suspension strip A being riveted on its two sides to the suspension bracket S and to the vessel wall through the rivets R. The strip A is similar to the stepped suspension strap of existing buckets. Such suspension strips A may also be provided beneath (internal to) die stepped projections of die suspension bracket S. By using diick suspension strips A and a thin suspension bracket S the efficiency of the bucket can be increased widiout compromising on the weight of the bucket.<br>
Figs.7 and 8 illustrate a bucket in which the suspension bracket S is vertical U shaped This suspension bracket would provide for the hinged mounting of die handle. The handle H passing dirough die holes L on die bracket S is omitted in the bucket shown in Figs.7 to 8. The suspension bracket is provided as a sling under and across the base E of the vessel and is dimensioned to abut on to the said base E of the vessel. The suspension bracket in diis case is strap shaped and is fixed to die vessel through rivets R provided towards the top of the vessel. Additional  means to locate die suspension bracket on to the base of the vessel may also be provided. The stress on the rivet joints R fixing die bracket to die vessel would be minimized as die suspension bracket is fixed abutting on the base E of the vessel.<br>
In the embodiments illustrated in Figs.l to 6 the ring shaped suspension bracket S is dimensioned to abut on to the outwardly jutting top edge D of the vessel and/or on to the outwardly inclined vessel wall towards die top. In die bucket shown in Fig. 7 to 8, the suspension bracket is<br><br>
dimensioned to abut on to the base of the vessel. The invention has been explained with reference to metal buckets and is particularly relevant for buckets made of aluminium. But it can also be readily applied to vessels made of synthetic materials such as plastic and the ubiquitous plastic buckets can also be so reinforced The plastic bucket provided with a metal suspension bracket and a metal handle can be expected to bear heavier loads, A bucket with rigid walls having a bucket handle (provided with hinged attachment) has not so far been reinforced with a vertical U shaped, horizontal C shaped or horizontal ring shaped suspension bracket and the provision of such a suspension bracket considerably increases the longevity of the bucket The bucket according to the invention has a volume capacity ranging between 2 litres and 100 litres.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
