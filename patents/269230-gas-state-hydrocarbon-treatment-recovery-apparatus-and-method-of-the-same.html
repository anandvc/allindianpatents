GAS-STATE HYDROCARBON TREATMENT/RECOVERY APPARATUS AND <br>
METHOD OF THE SAME<br><br>
Technical Field<br><br>
 [0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus and method of the same contained in a gas emitted into the atmosphere, and more particularly to an apparatus for treating a gasoline vapor that leaks when gasoline is injected and method of the same.<br><br>
Background Art<br><br>
 [0002]<br>
In a conventional method of removing gas-state hydrocarbon by an adsorption/desorption agent, there is a method arranged such that a gas (exhaust gas containing about 40 vol% of a gasoline vapor) generated from an exhaust gas generating source is fed to a condenser from an exhaust gas feeding pipe by a blower or the pressure of the gas, after the gasoline vapor is partly liquefied in the condensers, air containing a gasoline vapor that is not liquefied is fed to an adsorption tower, and a treated exhaust gas that has finished an absorption process is emitted into the atmosphere from a top of the adsorption tower (which is an adsorption tower after it is switched to a desorption process) through an outlet pipe as air containing 1 vol% or less of a gasoline vapor (clean gas).<br><br>
[0003]On the other hand, in the adsorption tower after the absorption process, a purge gas is supplied through a purge gas feeding pipe and sucked by a vacuum pump, resulting in desorption. A part of the clean gas, which is emitted from the top of the adsorption tower in an adsorption operation, is used as the purge gas, and the vacuum pump is operated to keep the pressure in the adsorption tower to 100 to 300 Torr.<br><br>
After the desorbed purge exhaust gas containing a gasoline vapor is mixed with air containing a gasoline vapor generated from the exhaust gas generating source, the exhaust gas is fed to the condensers, a part of it is liquefied in the condensers, and a gasoline vapor in the purge exhaust gas is recovered as a liquid (gasoline liquid).<br><br>
[4]	<br>
With the above arrangement, the gasoline vapor can be almost entirely recovered as the liquid gasoline, and the concentration of the gasoline vapor emitted from the adsorption towers is made to a level which is sufficiently low to prevent air pollution (refer to, for example. Patent Document 1).<br><br>
[0005]	<br>
Patent Document 1: Japanese Patent Application Laid-Open Publication No. 2006-198604 (pages 4 to 8, Fig. 2, pages 9 to 16, and Fig. 10)<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
In the method of recovering a gasoline vapor by providing the first and second condensers and two adsorption towers disclosed in Patent Document 1, since an apparatus arrangement becomes complicated as well as respective equipment has bad controllability, it cannot be said that the method is practically usable as a system.<br><br>
Further, since only a slight amount of gasoline is liquefied in the second condenser disposed behind the first condenser, the amount of recovered gasoline is small in comparison with a cost of installation of the second condenser and energy consumed by the second condenser. Thus, there still remains a room for improving recovery efficiency of gasoline.<br><br>
 [0007]<br>
Further, since water in the air is mixed into the first condenser, when a cooling temperature is set equal to or lower than the freezing point, water is frozen in the first condenser and the first condenser is closed. Thus, the cooling temperature of the first condenser must be set equal to or higher than the freezing point. However, butane, pentane, and the like as main components of a gasoline vapor are not liquefied at the set temperature and flow into the adsorption towers as they are, a time until the gasoline vapor leaks from the adsorption towers is shortened, from which a problem arises in that the switching time of the adsorption towers is made short. On the contrary, to prevent the switching time of the adsorption towers short, it is necessary to increase the size of the adsorption towers.<br>
that is, it is necessary to increase the amount of an adsorption agent filled in the adsorption towers, which causes increase in size of the adsorption towers.<br><br>
 [0008]<br>
An object of the present invention, which was made to solve the above problems, is to provide a gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus which is small in size and less expensive, and capable of efficiently liquefying gasoline contained in a gasoline vapor and a method.

As a result, the gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus, which is highly reliable and highly efficient, can be realized.<br><br>

[25]	<br>
The valve B1 is connected to the gasoline injection system 1 as well as connected to the purge gas outlet pipe 17 between the gasoline vapor suction pump 2 and the refrigerator 6 and opened in association with the operation of the gasoline injection system 1. The valve B2 is connected to the gas/liquid separator 9 and the gasoline vessel 12 and opened when the gasoline liquid recovered by the gas/liquid separator 9 is supplied to the gasoline vessel 12. The desorption valves B3 are disposed to the respective branched purge gas outlet pipes 17 and opened when the purge gas is caused to flow therethrough by being subjected to an open/close control. Note that in the following description, a desorption valve B3 provided onto the purge gas outlet pipe 17 connected to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 is called a desorption valve B3'. [0026]<br>
The adsorption outlet valves B4 are provided onto respective pipes connecting the adsorption/desorption tower 7, the adsorption/desorption tower 8, and the pressure controller 13 and causes the air containing a gasoline vapor to pass therethrough after the air is absorbed by the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 by being subjected to an open/close control. Note that, in the following description, an adsorption valve B4 provided onto a pipe connected to the adsorption/ desorption tower 8 is called an adsorption outlet valve B4'. The mass flow controllers B5 are provided onto the respective purge gas inlet pipes 16 across the purified air outlet pipe 15 and control the gas amount of the purge gas by being subjected to an open/close control. Note that, in the following description, a mass flow controller B5 provided onto a purge gas inlet pipe 16 connected to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 is called a mass flow controller B5'. [0027]<br>
The adsorption inlet valves B6 are disposed to the respective branched gasoline vapor feeding pipes 14 and guide the air containing a gasoline vapor to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 or the adsorption/desorption tower 8 by being subjected to an open/close control. Note that in the following description, an adsorption inlet valve B6 disposed to a gasoline vapor feeding pipe 14 connected to the adsorption/desorption tower 8 is called an adsorption inlet valve B6' . The heat medium supply control valve B7 is interposed between the liquid circulating pump 10 and the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 and adjusts the amount of the heat medium supplied from the heat medium reservoir 4 to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 by being subjected to an open/close control. [0028]<br>
The three-way valve CI is connected to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 2 0, the heat medium reservoir 4, and the three-way valve C2 and changes a flow destination of the heat medium by being subjected to a switch control. The three-way valve C2 is connected to the adsorption/desorption tower 7, the adsorption/desorption tower 8, and the three-way valve CI and changes the flow destination of the heat medium by being subjected to a switch control. The three-way valve C3 is connected to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20, the liquid circulating pump 10, and the three-way valve C4 and changes the flow destination of the heat medium by being subjected to a switch control.

Note that a not shown controller such operations as opening and closing of the respective valves, switching of the flow paths of the respective three-way valves, and controlling of the refrigerator 6.<br>
[29]	<br>
Next, an operation of the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 100 will be described. When the gasoline injection system 1 operates, the valve B1 opens in association with the operation, and the gasoline vapor suction pump 2 operates . When the gasoline vapor suction pump 2 starts to operate, a gasoline vapor (about 40 vol% at room temperature) in the vicinity of the gasoline injecting portion of the gasoline injection system 1 is sucked into the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 100 and fed to the condenser pipe 3 after it is pressurized and compressed to, for example, about 0.2 to 0.4 MPa. The condenser pipe 3 is disposed in the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 and cooled by the heat medium stored in the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20. Ordinarily, the inside of the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 is kept to about 0°C to 5°C, and when the gasoline vapor passes through the condenser pipe 3, water contained in gasoline and gas is partly condensed and separated into a gas (gasoline vapor) and a liquid (gasoline) through the gas/liquid separator 9.<br>
Incidentally, under the conditions of a pressure of 0.3<br>
MPa, a cooling temperature of 5°C, and a gas flow rate of 100 L/min, which are the operating conditions of the condenser pipe 3, the concentration of the gasoline vapor becomes about 10 vol%. Note that, as can be found from a saturated concentration diagram of gasoline vapor, the concentration of saturated gasoline vapor is about 10 vol% at the pressure of 0.3 MPa and the temperature of 5°C, and the concentration of the gasoline vapor does not theoretically become 10 vol% or less. Further, the concentration of the gasoline vapor can be reduced at an outlet of the condenser pipe 3 by reducing temperature. However, when a set temperature is reduced below the freezing point, the water contained in the gas is frozen in the condenser pipe 3 and pipe clogging of the condenser pipe 3 occurs. Thus, it is preferable to set the set temperature of the condenser pipe 3 about 0°C to 5°C. [0031]<br>
Further, when a gasoline injecting time reaches a certain period of time, the valve B2 is opened. With this operation, the gasoline liquid stored in a lower portion of the gas/liquid separator 9 is returned to the gasoline injection system 1 through the gasoline vessel 12. Thereafter, when a predetermined time passes, the valve B2 is closed, and the gasoline liquid is stored again in the lower portion of the gas/liquid separator 9. At the time, provision of the gasoline vessel 12 prevents the gasoline vapor from flowing into the gas/liquid separator 9 to thereby prevent reduction of an adsorption breakthrough time (reduction of switch timing) of<br>
the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the<br>
adsorption/desorption tower 8 caused by a high concentration gasoline vapor flowing into the adsorption/ desorption tower 7 or the adsorption/desorption tower 8.<br>
[32]	<br>
That is, in the gasoline vessel 12, a predetermined amount of the gasoline liquid is stored in the lower portion, and the gasoline liquid separated by the gas/liquid separator 9 flows into the gasoline vessel 12 from a bottom and flows upward. As a result, the gasoline vessel 12 has such a structure that the gasoline vapor is caused to stay in an upper portion. By this structure, even if the valve B2 is opened, the gasoline vapor does not flow into the gas/liquid separator 9 against a flow of the gasoline liquid so that a high concentration gasoline vapor is prevented from being fed to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 or the adsorption/desorption tower 8.<br>
[33]	<br>
Subsequently, about 10 vol% of the gasoline vapor, which is not treated in the condenser pipe 3, is fed to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 or the adsorption/desorption tower 8 and treated therein. Fig. 1 shows a case where the adsorption/desorption tower 7 acts as the adsorption tower and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 acts as the desorption tower. Accordingly, the desorption valve B3 is in an open (black) state, the desorption valve B3' is in a closed (void) state, the adsorption outlet valve B4 in an open (black) state, the adsorption outlet valve B4' is in a closed (void) state, the adsorption inlet valve B6 is in an open (black) state, and the<br>
adsorption inlet valve B6' is in a closed (void) state.<br>
[34]	<br>
After the adsorption/desorption tower 7 performs an absorption treatment for an arbitrary time, it is used as the desorption tower. In this case, the adsorption/desorption tower 7 is used by closing the desorption valve B3, opening the desorption valve B3', closing the adsorption outlet valve B4, opening the adsorption outlet valve B4' , closing the adsorption inlet valve B6, and opening the adsorption inlet valve B6'. Further, on the completion of desorption of gasoline in the adsorption/desorption tower 7, the adsorption/desorption tower 7 is used as the adsorption tower again, and the adsorption/desorption tower 7 is used to repeat the above operations time-sequentially. Switching of adsorption and desorption is controlled by switching the desorption valve B3 and the desorption valve B3', the adsorption outlet valve B4 and the adsorption outlet valve B4', and the adsorption inlet valve B6 and the adsorption inlet valve B6' .<br>
[35]	<br>
In Fig. 1, the gasoline vapor passes through the gasoline vapor feeding pipe 14 and is fed to the adsorption/desorption tower 7. An absorbing agent for adsorbing gasoline vapor is encapsulated in the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8. Silica gel is used as the adsorption agent of gasoline vapor, and, in particular, simple silica gel or simple synthesize zeolite having a pore diameter of 4 to 100 angstroms or a mixture of them is effective. A gasoline component is adsorbed and removed by that the gasoline vapor passes through the adsorption agent and the gasoline vapor is changed into clean air having 1 vol% or less of a gasoline concentration and emitted into the atmosphere through the purified air discharge pipe 15.<br>
[36]	<br>
Further, the purified air discharge pipe 15 is provided with the pressure controller 13 disposed thereto which controls the pressure of the clean air emitted into the atmosphere to a regulation value. When the clean air is emitted into the atmosphere, the pressure controller 13 keeps the pressure in the adsorption/desorption tower 7 acting as the adsorption tower to the regulation value. In the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 100 according to the embodiment 1, since the gasoline vapor is adsorbed using a high pressure (about 0.3 MPa) exhaust gas in the condenser pipe 3, an adsorption capacity is greatly improved as compared with a case where the gasoline vapor is adsorbed at a normal pressure.<br>
[37]	<br>
The adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/ desorption tower 8 are cooled to a predetermined temperature at all times by the heat medium supplied by the liquid circulating pump 10 regardless of the roles of adsorption and desorption of a gasoline vapor. That is, a cooling system of the condenser pipe 3, the adsorption/desorption tower 7, and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 is operated and controlled at all times so that the system is kept to be at a set temperature. This is because, since the adsorption agent filled in the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 is cooled by the heat transmitted from fin tube heat exchangers installed in the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8, a certain degree of a cooling time is indispensable and response to the need of instant operation cannot be satisfied.<br>
[38]	<br>
Further, this is because, since provision of the refrigerator 6 having a large cooling capability to achieve cooling in a short time adversely affects an installation cost to provide, the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus cannot be provided at a low cost. By setting the temperature in the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 to be lower, the adsorbing capacity of the adsorption agent can be increased by lowering, which allows reduction of the amount of use of the adsorption agent. Further, it can be prevented that a gasoline vapor is desorbed from the adsorption agent filled in the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 by an increase of the temperature of the adsorption agent in the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 when recovery of the gasoline vapor is stopped. This prevents an increase in the pressure in the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8.<br>
Next, a gasoline vapor desorption process will be described. When the gasoline adsorbed to the adsorption agent filled in the adsorption/desorption tower 8 operating as the desorption tower is desorbed, the gasoline is desorbed from the adsorption agent by sucking a gas from the adsorption/desorption tower 8 through the purge gas outlet pipe 17 by driving the suction pump 11. In doing this, the desorption valve is opened (black), and the desorption valve B3' is closed (void). Although an adsorption/desorption tower acting as an adsorption tower in adsorption operates in a high pressure state of 0.3 MPa, since the pressure in the adsorption/desorption tower is reduced below the atmospheric pressure in desorption by the suction pump 11, the gasoline adsorbed by the adsorption agent of the desorption tower is desorbed by the pressure difference. [0040]<br>
The desorbed gasoline vapor is returned to the condenser pipe 3 in Fig. 1, and then returned to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 again after gasoline is condensed and recovered again. All the amount of gasoline is condensed and recovered in the condenser pipe 3 while the operation is repeated. Note that, in desorption, a desorbing speed can be increased by increasing the temperature in the adsorption/desorption tower 8 . However, energy consumed by the refrigerator 6 and the heating means such as a heater is increased as well as the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 cannot be switched in a short time by fluctuating the temperature. Accordingly, it is effective to perform the desorption at the same temperature as that in adsorption without increasing the temperature in the desorption.<br>
[41]	<br>
Since the desorbing method making use of only the pressure difference resulting from the suction by the suction pump 11 is not so efficient, it is effective to introduce the purge gas from the outside. Accordingly, in the embodiment 1, a part of the clean gas exhausted into the atmosphere from the adsorption/desorption tower 7 is fed to the adsorption/desorption tower 8 by the purge gas inlet pipe 16 and used as the purge gas. The gas flow rate of the purge gas is controlled by the mass flow controller B5 and the mass flow controller B5'.<br><br>
In this case, a state that a regulated amount of gas can be flown by opening the mass flow controller B5 (black) is achieved and a state that no gas is flown by closing the mass flow controller B5' (void) is achieved. Note that, in the embodiment 1, since a water content in the gas is sufficiently reduced in the condenser pipe 3 in a previous stage, the water contained in purge gas does not almost adversely affect the adsorption agent in the adsorption/<br>
desorption tower 8. As a result of absorbing test, it was found that when the flow rate of the purge gas was set to 15 to 25 L/min, the pressure in the adsorption tower could be set to 15 to 30 kPa and a gasoline vapor could be efficiently desorbed.<br>
In gasoline injection facilities such as a gasoline stand, gasoline is injected at random times. Therefore, it is preferable to operate the gasoline vapor suction pump 2 during a limited time in which gasoline is injected and to recover a gasoline vapor in the vicinity of the gasoline injection system 1 from a view point of reducing power consumption. Further, the suction pump 11 is operated in association with the operation of the gasoline vapor suction pump 2. Accordingly, a gasoline vapor condensing operation by the condenser pipe 3, a gasoline vapor adsorbing operation by the adsorption/desorption tower 7, and a gasoline vapor desorbing operation by the adsorption/desorption tower 8 are performed intermittently. The system control as described above can reduce energy consumption in a state that the gasoline injection system 1 is not operated, thereby the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 100, which saves energy, can be realized. [0044]<br>
Finally, a cooling control method of the condenser pipe 3, the adsorption/desorption tower 7, and the adsorption/ desorption tower 8 will be described. As described above, it is preferable to set the temperature of the heat medium stored in the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 at from about 0°C to about 5°C to prevent the water contained in the gas from being frozen in the condenser pipe 3. On the other hand, to reduce the adsorption tower size as small as possible, it is preferable to reduce the temperature of the adsorption agent as small as possible (for example, below the freezing point) . Accordingly,<br>
it is considered that gasoline can be recovered highly efficiently as compared with a conventional method by setting the condenser pipe 3, the adsorption/desorption tower 7, and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 at different cooling temperatures.<br>
[45]	<br>
That is, it is considered that when a different supply amount of the heat medium, which is cooled to a predetermined temperature using the refrigerator 6 and the heat exchanger 5 is set to the condenser pipe 3, the adsorption/desorption tower 7, and the adsorption/desorption tower 8, the condenser pipe 3 and the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/ desorption tower 8 can be controlled to a different temperature and thus gasoline can be recovered efficiently. By controlling the three-way valves CI to C4 as flow path switching means, it is possible to supply the different amount of the heat medium to the condenser pipe 3, the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8.<br>
[46]	<br>
First, a cooling control method of the adsorption/ desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 will be described. The heat exchanger 5 is installed in the heat medium reservoir 4, and the heat medium is stored so that the heat exchanger 5 is sufficiently dipped in the heat medium. When the refrigerator 6 operates, the heat mediiom in the heat medium reservoir 4 is cooled to a predetermined temperature through the heat exchanger 5. At the time, it is preferable to measure<br>
the temperature of the heat medium and to control the operation of the refrigerator 6 by a signal of the measured temperature. The heat medium cooled to the predetermined temperature is supplied to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 by the liquid circulating pump 10. After the heat medium supplied to the adsorption/ desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 applies its cold heat to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8, the heat medium is returned into the heat medium reservoir 4 again. [0047]<br>
As described above, the adsorption agent in the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 is cooled to a predetermined temperature. The heat medium is supplied to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 having a large heat capacity by the liquid circulating pump 10 at all times regardless of the operation of the gasoline injection system 1 and regardless of the role of adsorption and desorption of a gasoline vapor. Since an intermittent flow of a load can be also sufficiently coped with by this operation, the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 100, which is highly reliable, can be realized. The cooling temperature of the adsorption agent is preferably as low as possible judging from adsorption characteristics, and the cooling temperature of the heat medium is also preferably as low as possible to realize the low cooling temperature of the adsorption agent.<br>
However, since a decrease of the temperature of the heat medium increases the viscosity of the heat medium, the energy consumption of the liquid circulating pump 10 is increased. Further, since the efficiency of the refrigerator 6 for cooling the heat medium is lowered, the energy consumption of the refrigerator 6 is increased. Accordingly, it is preferable to set the cooling temperature of the adsorption agent to -20°C to 0°C. From what has been described above, the adsorption efficiency of the adsorption agent can be increased by setting the cooling temperature of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 to -2 0°C to 0°C. As a result, the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 100, which is compact and can efficiently liquefy and condense gasoline, can be obtained.<br>
[49]	<br>
Next, a cooling control method of the condenser pipe 3 will be described. Likewise the case of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8, the heat medium, which is cooled to a predetermined temperature, is supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 by the liquid circulating pump 10 through the heat medium supply control valve B7. In the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20, the heat medium stored in the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 is mixed with the heat medium supplied from the heat medium reservoir 4. The heat medium is returned into the heat medium reservoir 4 again after it is deprived of heat generated from the condenser pipe 3. At the time, the temperature of an outlet gas of the condenser pipe 3 is measured by the temperature measuring unit 19, the heat medium supply control valve B7 is opened and closed so that the temperature becomes below the freezing point, and the amount of the heat medium supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 is controlled.<br>
[50]	<br>
As described above, the air containing gasoline vapor flowing in the condenser pipe 3 is cooled to a predetermined temperature higher than the freezing point. With this operation, a gasoline vapor can be efficiently liquefied without freezing the water in a gas. As described above, although the heat medium, which is cooled by the liquid circulating pump 10, is constantly supplied to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8, the heat medium is supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 by the liquid circulating pump 10 in association with the operation of the gasoline injection system 1. That is, since the condenser pipe 3 is composed of metal, it conducts heat promptly and is cooled relatively promptly. Thus, the heat medium is supplied by the liquid circulating pump 10 in association with the operation of the gasoline injection system 1 until the gas temperature at an outlet of the condenser pipe 3 reaches a predetermined value.<br>
[51]	<br>
Note that, although the example is shown in which the amount of the heat medium is supplied to the condensing pipe<br>
cooling vessel 20 by opening and closing the heat medium supply control valve B7 in the embodiment 1, the flow rate of the heat medium itself may be controlled. With this operation, the temperature of the heat medium in the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 can be more sophisticatedly controlled. From what has been described above, since occurrence of a freeze in the condenser pipe 3 can be prevented by setting the cooling temperature of the condenser pipe 3 to a temperature equal to or higher than the freezing point, the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 100, which is highly reliable and can efficiently recover gasoline, can be obtained. [0052]<br>
Incidentally, since the gasoline injection system 1 operates intermittently, when a gasoline injection is finished, the operation of the gasoline injection system 1 stops. In this case, the valve Bl, the valve B2, the desorption valves B3, the adsorption outlet valves B4, the mass flow controllers B5, and the adsorption inlet valves B6 are totally closed to prevent the gasoline adsorbed by the adsorption agent from being desorbed by the reduction of pressure in the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and emitted into the atmosphere. Further, as described above, since the heat medium is constantly supplied to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 at all times and the absorption agent is cooled, the pressure in the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 is not increased by desorption of a gasoline vapor.<br>
Further, in this case, an increase of the pressure may be eased by opening the desorption valve B3 and the desorption valve B3', which are located below the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8, , respectively, and moving the gasoline vapor adsorbed to a lower portion of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 to a lower portion of the adsorption/esorption tower 8 as well as making the pressure of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 equal to the pressure of the adsorption/desorption tower 8. With this operation, since an increase of the pressure in the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 100 can be prevented while reducing the energy consumption as much as possible even in a state that the gasoline injection system 1 is not operated, the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 100, which is high reliable, can be realized.<br>
[54]	<br>
In the embodiment 1, the amount of the heat medium supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 is controlled by measuring the gas temperature of the outlet of the condenser pipe 3 by the temperature measuring unit 19. However, the amount of the heat medium supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 may be controlled by measuring the pressure difference of gasoline vapor between the outlet and an inlet of the condenser pipe 3 by a differential manometer 21 according to an embodiment 2 to be described later. In this case, it is sufficient to control the supply amount of the heat medium so that the pressure difference measured by the differential manometer 21 becomes a predetermined pressure. Further, although the amount of the heat medium supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 is controlled by measuring the gas temperature at the outlet of the condenser pipe 3 by the temperature measuring unit 19 in the embodiment 1, the temperature of the heat medium may be measured in a portion, through which the heat medium is supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20, by the temperature measuring unit 19.<br>
[55]	<br>
Further, when the temperature in a portion, in which the heat medium stored in the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 is mixed with the heat medium supplied by the liquid circulating pump 10, is measured, a temperature control, by which approximately the same performance as that when the gas temperature in the condenser pipe 3 is measured can be obtained, can be realized. However, since the temperature is measured in the portion in which the heat media having a different temperature are mixed, the temperature of the heat media must be measured in a state that the temperatures of the heat media violently change. It is, therefore, difficult to determine that heat media reach a set temperature as compared with the case of measuring the gas temperature in the condenser pipe 3, and this method is inferior to the method of measuring the gas temperature in the condenser pipe 3.<br>
[56]	<br>
Embodiment 2<br>
Fig. 2 is an overall arrangement view showing a flow of a gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus according to an embodiment 2 of the invention. An arrangement and an operation of the gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus (hereinafter, simply called a gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 200) will be described with reference to Fig. 2. The gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 200 liquefies and recovers gasoline contained in a gasoline vapor emitted into the atmosphere when gasoline is injected likewise the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus according to the embodiment 1. As regards the embodiment 2, points different from those of the embodiment 1 are mainly described. The same portions as those of the embodiment 1 are denoted by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will not be repeated here. [0057]<br>
The embodiment 1 describes the case for controlling the amount of the heat medium supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 by measuring the gas temperature at the outlet of the condenser pipe 3 by the temperature measuring unit 19 as an example. The embodiment 2 describes, as an example, a case where the amount of the heat medium supplied to a condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 is controlled by measuring the pressure difference between an inlet and an outlet of the condenser pipe 3 using a differential manometer 21 and comparing the value with a set value. The differential manometer 21 measures the pressure difference of a gasoline vapor between the inlet and the outlet of the condenser pipe 3 from the pressure of the gasoline vapor in the inlet side of the condenser pipe 3 and<br>
the pressure of the gasoline vapor in the outlet side of the condenser pipe 3. The temperature difference information measured by the differential manometer 21 is sent to a controller, not shown, as a signal.<br>
[58]	<br>
With this operation, it can be directly detected that a pressure loss increases in the condenser pipe 3 because water in a gas is frozen in the condenser pipe 3 and ice is attached to the inside of the condenser pipe 3. Accordingly, since the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 200 can more accurately control the amount of the heat medium supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20, the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 200, which can liquefy and recover gasoline highly efficiently, can be provided. Note that the temperature measuring unit 19 of the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 100 according to the embodiment 1 can be installed into the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 200 in combination therewith. With this arrangement, since the amount of the heat medium supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 can be more accurately controlled, gasoline can be liquefied and recovered highly efficiently.<br><br>
Embodiment 3<br>
Fig. 3 is an overall arrangement view showing a flow of a gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus according to an embodiment 3 of the invention. An arrangement and an operation of the gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus (hereinafter, simply called a gasoline vapor recovery<br>
apparatus 300) will be described with reference to Fig. 3. The gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 300 liquefies and recovers gasoline contained in a gasoline vapor emitted into the atmosphere when gasoline is injected similarly to the gasoline vapor recovery apparatuses according to the embodiments 1 and 2. As regards the embodiment 3, points different from those of the embodiments 1 and 2 will mainly be described. The same portions as those of the embodiments 1 and 2 are denoted by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will not be repeated here. [0060]<br>
In the embodiments 1 and 2, the case where the condenser pipe 3 is provided in the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 was described as an example. However, in the embodiment 3, a gas/liquid separator 9 and a pipe for connecting the condenser pipe 3 and the gas/liquid separator 9 are disposed in a second heat medium cooling vessel 31 as a heat medium vessel in addition to the condenser pipe 3. In this structure, the condenser pipe 3 and the pipe connecting the gas/liquid separator 9 and the condenser pipe 3 are cooled by supplying a cooled heat medium to the second heat medium cooling vessel 31, so that a gasoline liquid, which is liquefied by the condenser pipe 3, may be prevented from being evaporated again until it reaches the gas/liquid separator 9.. That is, a function as a condenser device for liquefying the gasoline vapor is executed by the condenser pipe 3 and the second heat medium cooling vessel 31. [0061]<br>
with this arrangement, the gasoline vapor can be efficiently recovered as well as the gasoline vapor removed in an adsorption/desorption tower 7 and an adsorption/desorption tower 8 can be reduced, which accordingly reduces an adsorption agent to be used. From what has been described above, the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 300, which saves energy and is compact, can be provided. Although there is shown, as an example, the case where a temperature measuring unit 19 is installed in the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 300, a differential manometer 21 similar to that of the embodiment 2 may be installed in place of or together with the temperature measuring unit 19. [0062]<br>
Embodiment 4<br>
Fig. 4 is an overall arrangement view showing a flow of a gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus according to an embodiment 4 of the invention. An arrangement and an operation of the gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus (hereinafter, simply called a gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 400) will be described with reference to Fig. 4. The gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 400 liquefies and recovers gasoline contained in a gasoline vapor emitted into the atmosphere when gasoline is injected similarly to the gasoline vapor recovery apparatuses according to the embodiments 1 to 3. In the embodiment 4, points different from those of the embodiments 1 to 3 are mainly described. The same portions as those of the embodiments 1 to 3 are denoted by the same reference<br>
numerals, and description thereof will not be repeated here.<br>
[63]	<br>
In the embodiment 4, a heat medium used for cooling an adsorption/desorption tower 7 and an adsorption/desorption tower 8 can be directly supplied to a condensing pipe cooling vessel 20. That is, the embodiment can control a case where after the heat medium is supplied to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 by a liquid circulating pump 10, the heat medium is directly returned to a heat medium reservoir 4 through a heat medium return valve B8 and a case where the heat medium is directly supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 through a heat medium supply control valve B7. The heat medium return valve B8 is connected to the heat medium supply control valve B7, a three-way valve CI and a three-way valve C2 and interposed between a three-way valve C5, which is interposed between the three-way valve CI and the three-way valve C2, and the three-way valve CI.<br>
[64]	<br>
With this arrangement, since the temperature of the heat medium supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 can be increased by the heat generated in the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the temperature difference between the heat medium which originally exists in the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 and the heat medium supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 can be reduced, the gas temperature in a condenser pipe 3 can be controlled more accurately. Accordingly, the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 400, which can highly<br>
efficiently liquefy gasoline, can be provided. Note that, although the case where a temperature measuring unit 19 is installed in the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 400 is shown as an example, a differential manometer 21 similar to that of the embodiment 2 may be installed in place of or together with the temperature measuring unit 19.<br>
[65]	<br>
Embodiment 5<br>
Fig. 5 is an overall arrangement view showing a flow of a gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus according to an embodiment 5 of the invention. An arrangement and an operation of the gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus (hereinafter, simply called a gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 500) will be described with reference to Fig. 5. The gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 500 liquefies and recovers gasoline contained in a gasoline vapor emitted into the atmosphere when gasoline is injected similarly to the gasoline vapor recovery apparatuses according to the embodiments 1 to 4. Note that, in the embodiment 5, points different from those of the embodiments 1 to 4 will be mainly described. The same portions as those of the embodiments 1 to 4 are denoted by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will not be repeated here.<br>
[66]	<br>
The embodiment 5 is different from the embodiment 4 in that a temperature adjuster 41 is interposed between a heat medium supply control valve B7 and a condensing pipe cooling vessel 20. With this arrangement, since the temperature of a heat medium supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 can be made higher than that of the heat medium emitted from outlets of an adsorption/desorption tower 7 and an adsorption/desorption tower 8 by the temperature adjuster 41 and the temperature difference between the heat medium which originally exists in the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 and the heat medium supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 can be reduced, the gas temperature in a condenser pipe 3 can be controlled more accurately. From what has been described above, the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 500, which can highly efficiently liquefy gasoline, can be provided. Note that, although the case where a temperature measuring unit 19 is installed in the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 500 is shown as an example, a differential manometer 21 similar to that of the embodiment 2 may be installed in place of or together with the temperature measuring unit 19. [0067]<br>
Embodiment 6<br>
Fig. 6 is an overall arrangement view showing a flow of a gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus according to an embodiment 6 of the invention. An arrangement and an operation of the gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus (hereinafter, simply called a gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 600) will be described with reference to Fig. 6. The gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 600 liquefies and recovers gasoline contained in a gasoline vapor emitted into the atmosphere when gasoline is injected similarly to the gasoline vapor recovery apparatuses according to the embodiments 1 to 5. Note that, in the embodiment 6, points different from those of the embodiments 1 to 5 will be mainly described. The same portions as those of the embodiments 1 to 5 are denoted by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will not be repeated here. [0068]<br>
The embodiment 6 is different from the embodiments 1 to 5 in that the condenser pipe 3 and the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 are replaced with a condensing heat exchanger 52 and a condenser vessel 51 for accommodating the condensing heat exchanger 52. That is, a function as a condenser device for liquefying a gasoline vapor is achieved by the condensing heat exchanger 52 and the condenser vessel 51. It is most suitable to use a fin tube heat exchanger as the condensing heat exchanger 52 in that the fin tube heat exchanger has a small pressure loss and can efficiently cool a gas containing a gasoline vapor. Further, a type of the condenser vessel 51 is not particularly limited as long as it is a vessel which can accommodate the condensing heat exchanger 52. [0069]<br>
An operation of the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 600 will be briefly described. When a gasoline vapor suction pump 2 starts to operate as a gasoline injection system 1 operates, a gasoline vapor is sucked and fed to the condenser vessel 51 in which the condensing heat exchanger 52 is accommodated. The<br>
gasoline vapor fed to the condenser vessel 51 flows in the condenser vessel 51 and is liquefied on a surface of the condensing heat exchanger 52. A heat medium is supplied to the condensing heat exchanger 52 by a liquid circulating pump 10 through a heat medium supply control valve B7. The gasoline vapor fed to the condenser vessel 51 is cooled by the heat medium.<br>
[70]	<br>
At the time, the amount of the heat medium supplied to the condensing heat exchanger 52 is controlled by opening and closing the heat medium supply control valve B7 by measuring the gas temperature of an outlet of the condenser vessel 51 by a temperature measuring unit 19 as described above. With this operation, freezing of water in a gas on the surface of the condensing heat exchanger 52 and closing of gas flow paths between fins of the condensing heat exchanger 52 can be prevented. From what has been described above, the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 600, which is highly reliable and can efficiently recover gasoline, can be provided. Note that, although the case where a temperature measuring unit 19 is installed into the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 600 is shown as an example, a differential manometer 21 similar to that of the embodiment 2 may be installed in place of or together with the temperature measuring unit 19. Further, a heat medium return valve B8 similar to that of the embodiment 4 may be disposed.<br>
[71]	<br>
Embodiment 7<br>
Fig. 7 is an overall arrangement view showing a flow of<br>
a gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus according to an embodiment 7 of the present invention. An arrangement and an operation of the gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus (hereinafter, simply called a gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 700) will be described with reference to Fig. 7. The gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 700 liquefies and recovers gasoline contained in a gasoline vapor emitted into the atmosphere when gasoline is injected similarly to the gasoline vapor recovery apparatuses according to the embodiments 1 to 6. Note that, in the embodiment 7, points different from those of the embodiments 1 to 6 will be mainly described. The same portions as those of the embodiments 1 to 6 are denoted by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will not be repeated here. [0072]<br>
The embodiment 7 is different from the embodiment 6 in that metal particles 53 are filled in a condensing heat exchanger 52 including a condenser vessel 51. Aluminum, copper, and the like, which have good heat conduction and are not corroded by gasoline vapor and the like are suitable as the metal particles 53. With this arrangement, since a gasoline vapor can be efficiently cooled in the condenser vessel 51, the gasoline vapor can be efficiently liquefied. Further, the since structure of the condenser vessel 51 can be made to be the same structure as that of an adsorption/<br>
desorption tower 7 and an adsorption/desorption tower 8, common vessel portions can be used by filling them with a substance composed of an adsorption agent or the metal particles 53.<br>
[73]	<br>
From what has been described above, the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 700, which is less expensive and which can high efficiently liquefy gasoline, can be provided. Note that, although the case where a temperature measuring unit 19 is installed into the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 700 is shown as an example, a differential manometer 21 similar to that of the embodiment 2 may be installed in place of or together with the temperature measuring unit 19. A heat medium return valve B8 similar to that of the embodiment 4 may be disposed. Further, the metal particles 53 may be composed of any material as long as the material has good heat conduction and is not corroded by gasoline vapor and the like, and the metal particles 53 are not limited to aluminum and copper.<br><br>
[74]	<br>
Embodiment 8<br>
Fig. 8 is an overall arrangement view showing a flow of a gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus according to an embodiment 8 of the invention. An arrangement and an operation of the gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus (hereinafter, simply called a gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 800) will be described with reference to Fig. 8. The gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 800 liquefies and recovers gasoline contained in a gasoline vapor emitted into the atmosphere when gasoline is injected similarly to the gasoline vapor recovery apparatuses according to the embodiments 1 to<br>
7. Note that, in the embodiment 8, points different from those of the embodiments 1 to 7 are mainly described. The same portions as those of the embodiments 1 to 7 are denoted by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will not be repeated here.<br><br>
[75]	<br>
In the embodiments 1 to 7, the amount of the heat medium supplied to the condensing pipe cooling vessel 20 is controlled by measuring the gas temperature of the outlet of the condenser pipe 3 by the temperature measuring unit 19 (or the differential manometer 21) while constantly supplying the heat medium to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8. However, in the embodiment 8, a heat medium is supplied only to the adsorption/desorption tower 7, which operates as an adsorption tower, as well as the supply amount of the heat medium to the adsorption/desorption tower 8, which operates as a desorption tower, is restricted by controlling a second heat medium supply control valve B9 and a third heat medium supply control valve BIO, which are heat medium supply control valves, also to the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8.<br><br>
[76]	<br>
The second heat medium supply control valve B9 is installed onto a pipe between a three-way valve C4 and the adsorption/desorption tower 7, and the third heat medium supply control valve BIO is installed onto a pipe between the three-way valve C4 the adsorption/desorption tower 8, respectively. With this arrangement, since the temperature of the adsorption/desorption tower 8 operating as the desorption tower can be raised and a gasoline vapor can be efficiently desorbed from the adsorption/desorption tower 8, the gasoline vapor can be sufficiently adsorbed when the roles of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 are switched. Accordingly, the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 800, which can control the temperatures of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 formed in small size and can highly efficiently liquefy and recover gasoline, can be provided. <br><br>
[0077]<br>
As to a case of one set of an condensing portion (a condenser pipe 3 and a condensing pipe cooling vessel 20) and two sets of the adsorption/desorption towers (the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8), the embodiment 8 shows the case where the temperature of the condensing portion and the temperatures of the adsorption/desorption towers are individually controlled by controlling the amounts of the heat media supplied to the condensing portion and the adsorption/desorption towers. However, the amounts of the heat media supplied to a plurality of the condensing portions and a plurality of the adsorption/desorption towers may be controlled by the same method. By doing this, the temperatures of the plurality of condensing portions and the plurality of adsorption/ desorption towers can be individually controlled, which allows gasoline to be efficiently liquefied.<br><br>
[78]	<br>
Although the case where a temperature measuring unit 19 is installed in the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 800 is shown as an example, a differential manometer 21 similar to that of the embodiment 2 may be installed in place of or together with the temperature measuring unit 19. A heat medium return valve B8 similar to that of the embodiment 4 may be provided. Further, a condensing heat exchanger 52 may be employed in place of the condenser pipe 3 likewise the embodiments 6 and 7. In this case, a condenser vessel 51 may be filled with metal particles 53.<br><br>
[79]	<br>
Embodiment 9<br>
Fig. 9 is an overall arrangement view showing a flow of a gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus according to an embodiment 9 of the invention. An arrangement and an operation of the gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus (hereinafter, simply called a gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 900) will be described with reference to Fig. 9. The gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 900 liquefies and recovers gasoline contained in a gasoline vapor emitted into the atmosphere when gasoline is injected similarly to the gasoline vapor recovery apparatuses according to the embodiments 1 to 8. Note that, in the embodiment 9, points different from those of the embodiments 1 to 8 are mainly described. The same portions as those of the embodiments 1 to 8 are denoted by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will not be repeated here. [0080]<br>
The embodiment 9 is different from the embodiments 1 to 8 in that only the pressure in a condenser pipe 3 is increased by arranging a second pressure controller 61 on a gas outlet of a gas/liquid separator 9. Since the second pressure controller 61 is arranged on the gas outlet of the gas/liquid separator 9, the pressure in the condenser pipe 3 can be set to a higher level. With this arrangement, the concentration of a gasoline vapor in an outlet of the condenser pipe 3 can be further reduced, and the concentration of gasoline supplied to an adsorption/desorption tower 7 and an adsorption/desorption tower 8 can be reduced, which allows reduction of size of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8. Note that the pressure in the gas/liquid separator 9 can be also increased by the second pressure controller 61. <br><br>
[0081]<br>
Since the condenser pipe 3 is a pipe wound spirally, it need not be treated as a pressure vessel and the pressure thereof can be increased. In contrast, since the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 are pressure vessels, they must have a pressure resistant structure to increase the pressure thereof, which accordingly increases a cost of vessels. Accordingly, the cost of the apparatus can be reduced by increasing the pressure of only the condenser pipe<br>
3 and setting the inside pressure of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 to 0.3 MPa or less at which they are not treated as pressure vessels. From what has been described above, the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 900, which are less expensive, small in size, and which can high efficiently liquefy gasoline, can be provided. <br><br>
[0082]<br>
Further, according to the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 900, provision of a second pressure controller 61 as a pressure control valve behind the gas/liquid separator 9 allows the inside pressure of the condenser pipe 3 as a condenser device and the inside pressure of the gas/liquid separator 9 to be increased. Accordingly, since the saturated vapor concentration of organic hydrocarbon such as butane and pentane, which has a high boiling point and is difficult to be liquefied, can be reduced and organic hydrocarbon such as butane and pentane, which has a low boiling point, can be efficiently liquefied by the condenser pipe 3, the efficiency of recovery of a gasoline vapor can be improved. Further, according to the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 900, since the pressure withstanding property of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 need not be set excessively high by keeping the pressure of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/ desorption tower 8, whose amount of adsorption is not increased depending upon the amount of pressure, to a predetermined pressure or less, a cost can be reduced.<br>
Although the case where a temperature measuring unit 19 is installed in the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 900 is shown as an example, a differential manometer 21 similar to that of the embodiment 2 may be installed in place of or together with the temperature measuring unit 19. Also, a heat medium return valve B8 similar to that of the embodiment 4 may be provided. Further, a condensing heat exchanger 52 may be employed in place of the condenser pipe 3 similarly to the embodiments 6 and 7. In this case, a condenser vessel 51 may be filled with metal particles 53.<br><br>
[84]	<br>
Embodiment 10<br>
Fig. 10 is an overall arrangement view showing a flow of a gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus according to an embodiment 10 of the present invention. An arrangement and an operation of the gas-state hydrocarbon treatment/recovery apparatus (hereinafter, simply called a gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 1000) will be described with reference to Fig. 10. The gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 1000 liquefies and recovers gasoline contained in a gasoline vapor emitted into the atmosphere when gasoline is injected similarly to the gasoline vapor recovery apparatuses according to the embodiments 1 to 9. Note that, in the embodiment 10, points different from those of the embodiments 1 to the embodiment 9 will be mainly described. The same portions as those of the embodiments 1 to 9 are denoted by the same reference numerals, and description thereof will not be repeated here.<br><br>
[85]	<br>
The embodiment 10 is different from the embodiments 1 to 9 in that an integrating flow meter 71 is disposed to a purified air discharge pipe 15 for feeding the air emitted from an adsorption/desorption tower 7 or an adsorption/ desorption tower 8 into the atmosphere. With this arrangement, the integrated amount of the gas emitted from the adsorption/desorption tower 7 or the adsorption/desorption tower 8 can accurately be measured, thereby to allow accurate switching of adsorption/desorption tower 7 or the adsorption/desorption tower 8. Accordingly, there is an advantage in that the apparatus can be made small in size in its entirety by minimizing the capacities of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 and that the life of the apparatus can be increased by an increase of life of valves and the like by increasing a switching time of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8.<br><br>
[86]	<br>
Thus, according to the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 1000, since the integrating flow meter 71 is placed on the purified air outlet pipe 15 connected to outlets of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8, the total amount of the air passing through the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8 can be definitely determined. As a result, reversal of the functions of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8, that is, timing, at which an adsorption tower and a desorption tower are switched, can be made apparent without providing an expensive gasoline concentration meter. Further, it is also possible to make the apparatus small in size in its entirety by minimizing the capacities of the adsorption/desorption tower 7 and the adsorption/desorption tower 8.<br><br>
 [0087]<br>
Although the case where a temperature measuring unit 19 is installed in the gasoline vapor recovery apparatus 1000 is shown as an example, a differential manometer 21 similar to that of the embodiment 2 may be installed in place of or together with the temperature measuring unit 19. Further, a heat medium return valve B8 similar to that of the embodiment 4 may be provided. Further, a condensing heat exchanger 52 may be employed in place of the condenser pipe 3 likewise the embodiments 6 and 7. In this case, a condenser vessel 51 may be filled with metal particles 53. Further, a second pressure controller 61 similar to that of the embodiment 9 may be provided.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
