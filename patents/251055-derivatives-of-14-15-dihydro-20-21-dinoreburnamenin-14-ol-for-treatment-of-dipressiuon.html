1.	DERIVES OF 14.15-DIHYDRO 2P.21-PINOREBHJRNAMENIN-14-     OL, AND APPLICATIONS THEREOF<br><br>
2. (A)	BIOCORTECH	<br>
(B)	FRANCE	<br>
(C)	28, Rue Du Docteur Roux,<br>
	F-75015, Paris, France.	<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br>
1<br><br>
The purpose of the invention is new derivatives of 14,15-dihydro 20,21-dinoreburnameninl4-ol, and their applications as a drug for Human.<br>
Depression is one of the most frequent psychological problems, m France, the proportion of depressive people is 14.9%, including one third of whom are not treated medically. One woman out of five is affected. The prevalence of declared depression has increased by a factor of 6 since 1970. The proportion of depressive persons increased between 1992 and 1997, particularly among the young from 20 to 29 years old (+65%). Therefore, it is particularly important to find treatments better adapted to depression, particularly since some patients may not respond to classical antidepressants.<br>
Derivatives of 20,21-dinoreburnamenin, including 14,15-dihydro 20,21-dmoreburnameninl4-ol, are already known for their vaso-expanding properties, particularly cerebral, and for their activity in regulation of tyrosine hydroxylase in the locus coeruleus (Bourde et al., Neurochem. Int., 23 (6), 567-574, 1993). They are used for cerebral vasculopatbies and for all syndromes caused by alteration of cerebral circulation. These derivatives and their first known therapeutic application were described in patent application FR 2 381 048, published on September 15, 1978. This patent application was described in the additive certificate application FR2 433 528 published on March 14,1980.<br>
More particularly, application FR 2 381 048 describes derivatives of 20,21-dinoreburnamenin and their preparation process. The pharmacological properties of these compounds are also described: these compounds are valuable cerebral oxygenators and vasoregulators that in particular increase cerebral flow in the cerebral microcirculation. Application FR 2 433 528 also describes the process for preparation of a particular isomer derived from 20,21-dinoreburnamenin, and the isomer obtained by this process.<br>
Application WO 89/04830, published on June 1st, 1989, describes new substitute derivatives of 20,21-dmoreburnamenin, the process for their preparation and their application as a medicine particularly as-an antidepressant.<br>

Depression is a pathological psychic condition combining a stressful mood change and slowing of intellectual activity and motricity. It is a morbid condition, more or less long term, characterised by a certain sadness and reduction of the energy tonicity. A bipolar depression is characterised by alternating phases: marked dejection and inertia in the first phase, euphoria and hyperactivity in the second phase.<br>
The main symptoms used to diagnose depression in a person are depressive mood, marked reduction of interest or pleasure, problems in feeding, sleep problems, agitation or slowed psychomotrieity, tiredness or loss of energy, lack of self-esteem, or an excessive feeling of culpability, a reduction of the ability to think or concentrate, or uncertainty, morbid thoughts (60% of cases) suicidal thoughts (in 15% of cases).<br>
Causes of depression include: 1/ The hereditary factor<br>
Persons whose close relatives suffer from or have suffered from depression are most likely to be affected. They have a 15% risk of developing depression, while persons whose close relatives are not depressive only have 2 to 3% risk of developing a depression. 2/ The biochemical factor<br>
Current research on depression applies to neurotransmitters. It has thus been noticed that a serotonin deficiency or unbalance caused sleep loss and reduced appetite, and also mat a reduction in noradrenalin has an effect on loss of energy, loss of pleasure. 3/ Environmental factors<br>
Children who have experienced the loss of a loved one such as their parents are more likely to develop depression later in their life. Difficulties in relations, communication problems and family, professional or other conflicts may also contribute to solitude, alienation and result in depression. Financial difficulties and other tensions can also have an important impact<br>
Seasonal factors must not be neglected: the depression rate is higher during months in which sunshine is lowest. Seasonal depression only occurs during the period of the year during which days are shortest, thus it occurs in winter and disappears in spring. Symptoms include tiredness, dejection, lack of vitality and loss of interest, problems with concentration and libido, sudden desire for anything sweet, an increased<br>
3<br><br>
need for sleep or increased weight during the winter. This is what is sometimes called winter depression. 2% of all adults in central Europe are affected by seasonal depression and women are affected 4 times more frequently than men.<br>
Depression is often accompanied by other psychological problems or it may accompany another psychological problem. Acute panic attacks and obsessions are the most frequent problems.<br>
Schizophrenia is a chronic psychosis characterised by psychic dissociation or a discordance that disturbs the course of thought (it becomes hermetic and chaotic), it changes behaviour (which becomes strange, autistic) and upsets affectivity (archaic and paradoxical), associated with an abstract and symbolic delirium that creates themes of influence fed by auditory and cenesthesic hallucinations, and experienced in a depersonalisation atmosphere.<br>
Maniac-depressive diseases (bipolar depression) and schizophrenia, which are two mental diseases, have the same genetic origin: the expression of various genes involved in some brain cells and in the placement of the myelin (that propagates electrical signals) would be reduced. Although these two diseases have a different clinical progress, they share some symptoms and similar medicines are often used to treat them.<br>
Prior art includes two main types of treatment for depression and schizophrenia: treatment by medicine and psychotherapies. Treatment by medicines that consists of using antidepressants, is appropriate in all forms of depression. Antidepressants act on the equilibrium of neurotransmitters, Psychotherapies are helpful for patients, but cannot be the only treatment. There are other forms of treatments such as behavioural and cognitive therapies (particularly for neurotic depression), sismotherapy or electroshock (used as a last resort).<br>
The progress of depression is very variable and depends on many parameters: etiology, personality of the patient, etc.<br>
If no treatment is given, it often arises that a depression can last 6 months or more, occasionally ending in the extreme termination of suicide. Up to 15% of patients with a serious depression disorder commit suicide. A relapse is observed in about 60% of all cases after treatment.<br>
Depression may be diagnosed using the DSM IV criteria (Diagnostic and<br>
4-<br><br>
Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th edition, American Psychiatric Association Publisher; Washington DC)); the DSM IV is a diagnostic and statistical baseline for mental disorders, produced by the American Psychiatry Association. According to me DSM IV criteria, severe depression that is the severe and most common form of depression and for which only 10 to 25% of patients search for treatment, is characterised by one or several episodes of mood change or loss of interest for at least two weeks accompanied by at least four additional symptoms of depression; these symptoms may for example be a change in appetite, weight, sleep or psychomotricity activity; reduction of energy, a feeling of reduced self-esteem, or culpability, difficulty in thinking, concentrating, making decisions, or recurrent thoughts of death, or ideation of plans or attempts to commit suicide.<br>
Major depressions include Treatment Resistant Depressions (TRD), and also Major Recurrent Depressive Disorders (MRDD), that are associated with hypomaniac episodes.<br>
Classical antidepressants currently and frequently marketed belong to the following main classes: tricyclic antidepressants (TCA), monoamin: oxidase inhibitors (MAO) (MAOIs), selective serotonin recapture inhibitors (SSRIs), serotonin and noradrenalin recapture inhibitors (SNDRIs), noradrenalin and selective serotonin antidepressants (NASSAs) and serotonin receptor modulators.<br>
We still need to have compounds capable of treating depression, major depression disorders in a patient who may be resistant to a treatment using the classical antidepressants mentioned above. This is the purpose of the invention described and claimed below.<br>

Process for preparation of compounds with formula (I): according to the invention,<br>
compounds such as those defined by the formula (1) may be prepared from 14,15<br>
dmydro-20,21-dinoreburnameninl4iol by the following processes.<br>
1) Preparation of 14,15 dmydror20.21-dmorebumameoini14-ol:<br>
The 14,15 diydro-20,21-dmoreburnameninl4-ol compound is prepared by<br>

using a reducing agent; the result obtained is two pairs of diastereoisomers [(3α, 14α), (3α, 14β)] and [(14α, 16α), (14β, 16α)] of 14,15 dmydro-20,21-dmoreburnamenin 14-ol, or a mix of them, and if required the reaction product is treated by a mineral or organic acid to form a salt from the product.<br>
Products with formula (II) and (II) can be prepared for example as described in French patent application under number FR 2 190 113, The racemic mix of compounds with formula (II) may be separated by split<br>
One of the two enantiomers with formula (II) can be reduced to obtain a pair of diastereoisomers (±) of 14,15 dihydro-20,21-dinoreburnameninl4-ol or mixes of them in very variable proportions of the two diastereoisomers. The experiment described in French patent application published under number FR 2 623 503 shows that in practice only one of the two diastereoisomers is obtained (see example B).<br>
Used compounds with formula (II) may be in racemic or optically active form. Reduction compounds of 14,15 dmydro-20,21-dinoreburnameninl4-ol obtained from the product with formula (II) are obviously obtained in the corresponding stereochemical form.<br>
Compounds with formula (II) may be used in the form of one of their additive salts with mineral or organic acids. If this is the case, the products of 14,15-dihydro-20,2I-dinoreburnameninl4-ol may be obtained in salified or non-salified form depending on the chosen operating conditions.<br>
Racemic or optically active mixes of compounds of 14,15 dihydro-20,21-dinoreburnameninl4-ol may also be prepared as indicated in French patent application published under number FR 2381 048 and in the French additional certificate application under number FR 2 433 528.<br>
17<br><br>
In the preferred embodiments of the invention, the process described above is made as follows.<br>
The reducing agent used may be a hydride, particularly a mixed hydride for example such as mixed lithium and aluminium hydride, sodium and aluminium diethylhydride, sodium hydrobpride, lithium hydroboride, diisobutyl-aluminium hydride. The reduction reaction is carried out within an organic solvent or a mix of solvents, for example such as an ether like ethylic ether, tetrahydrofurane, or an aromatic hydrocarbon such as toluene, benzene, xylene. The reduction reaction may be carried out at a temperature varying from 20°C to the reflux temperature of the reaction medium. It is advantageously performed at ambient temperature. In the case in which a metal hydride is used as the reducing agent, 14,15 (iihydro-20,21-dinoreburnamenin 14-ol is released from the intermediate complex formed with the hydride, according to current practice, by the addition of an aqueous alkaline solution, for example such as a solution of sodium hydroxide.<br>
Reduction of compound (II) trans 3a leads to the compound (+) (3α, 14α) 14,15-dihydro 20,21-dinorebumamenin14-ol. Reduction of compound (II) trans 16a can lead to the compound (-) (14β, 16α) 14,15-dihydro 20,21-dmorebumameninl4-ol.<br>
These compounds can be treated by an acid, for example hydrochloric acid to obtain the (-) (3α, 14β) 14,15rdihydro 20,21-dinoreburnamenin l4-ol and (+) (14α, 16α) 14,15-dihydro 20,21-dmorebumameninl4-ol majority forms respectively (see following diagram and Figure 2).<br>

Example 10; Pharmacological protocol<br>
The molecules were selected as a function of their ability to:<br>
1)	activate expression of the protein in the Locus Caeruleus (LC) of a Balb/c mouse;<br>
2)	their capacity to reveal a significant population of cells in which the phenotype of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) is restored by the treatment<br>
The content of TH protein is measured after direct transfer of coronal sections of the frozen brain on nitrocellulose filters. Precise sampling of the protein distribution, revealed by quantitative immunochemistry, was thus done every 80 um (thus defining each anatomic interval). Quantification was done by using a range of brain homogenates containing an increasing quantity of the TH protein.<br>
The number of immunopositive cells for TH is determined starting from coronal brain sections fixed by immunohistochemistry using the same anatomic sampling.<br>
These analyses are carried out with animals treated by an excipient and with mice treated by a single intraperitoneal injection (20 mg/kg in 100 ul) of the molecule to be tested. The animals are sacrificed three days after the injection.<br>
A typical result is shown on the attached figure 1. It clearly shows that the increase in induction of the TH gene takes place in a specific level of the nucleus. The content of TH protein was determined 3 days after a single injection to treated mice and control mice. The quantity of TH protein was determined in each anatomic interval along the caudorostral axis. Each bar represents the average value ± sem of the control group (black bars) and the treated group (cross-hatched bars). In the figure, the asterisk « * » means that the result is significant (p

vivo considering their capacity to induce an increase in the expression of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the Locus Caeruleus (LC) of mice of the inbred Balb/c variety. This genetic model was previously validated as being capable of revealing the capacity of a molecule administered by a peripheral method, to make "dormant" noradrenergic cells appear (Ref. 1 and 2), Table 2 below contains examples of the results of this screening.<br><br>

For each of the examples presented in this description, the animals in control groups and the treated animals were injected with 100 ul of the vehicle or a single dose of 20 mg/kg of product by intraperitoneal (i.p.) method. The animals were sacrificed three days after injection, their brain was taken out, frozen and Cut into 20 um frontal sections. In the region containing the LC, sampling was done at 80 um intervals and the sections were transferred directly onto nitrocellulose filters (Ref. 3). The TH was determined by immunochemistry. The results represent the average ± sem obtained on the entire structure in each of the groups treated. They are expressed as a percent of the average value found in the corresponding control group ** p 
Complementary results were obtained among the examples mentioned using the compound with formula (Iel) for which acute or sequential administration shows up a significant increase in the population of noradrenergic cells of the locus caeruleus as shown in the figure below:<br>
The results in Figure 2 show the posterior - anterior distribution of the number of cells containing TH in the LC determined by immunohistochemistry obtained in a<br>
30 <br>
control group of Balb/c mice and in a group of mice treated by the molecule with formula (Iel). Each bar represents the average obtained in each 80 um anatomic interval in each experimental group ±sem. ***^ indicates p 
This phenomenon may be stabilised by an appropriate sequential treatment (for example: one 20 mg/kg i.p. injection every 3 days for 15 days, see Figure 2). Under these conditions, the increase in the number of positive supernumary TH cells that appeared in the LC is still maintained for 24 days after the treatment stopped.<br>
At the same time as cells reappear in the LC, a very significant increase in the density of noradrenergic fibres can be seen in the prefrontal cortex (Figure 3) among the animals treated by compound (Iel).<br>
The results in Figure 3 show the distribution of positive TH fibres on a prefrontal cortex sample of the Balb/c mouse. At left: in a control mouse, the typical orientation (parallel to the surface of the cortex) of noradrenergic fibres identified using an irnmunocytochemical reaction related to the presence of TH protein, is noticed in the molecular layer of the prefrontal cortex. At right: the figure shows the increase in the density of positive TH fibres identified in the same cerebral region after a sequential treatment (5 i.p. injections of the molecule (Iel); 20 mg/kg every three days). The animals were sacrificed three days after the last injection. The dashed lines mark the limit of the molecular layer of the prefrontal cortex.<br>
It was also demonstrated that:<br>
-	the molecule (Iel) is active by mouth<br>
-	this activity is dose dependent by intra-peritoneal (i.p.) method and by oral (p.o.) method. 50% effective (DE50) doses are 0.5 and 1.5 mg/kg respectively. The molecule in the preferred example is thus 30 times more active than its direct synthesis precursor with formula (1) (see Ref. 4,5 and 6).<br>
Two enantiomer pairs were separated during synthesis of the molecule (Ie). The enantiomer pair with formula (Iel) was separated into two pure products (Iela and<br>
31<br><br>
Ielb). The compound (Ielb) is twice as active as the form (Iela) and is thus the preferred form.<br>
The inventors also demonstrated that compounds with formula (I), the radical R of the compound (T) can also represent a hydrogen atom with a double bond between carbon 14 and carbon 15, and particularly the compound (Iel) has another innovative activity: activation of the expression of hypocretins in a specific population of lateral hypothalamus cells that under normal physiological conditions express these peptides in the balbc/c only slightly, or not at all. This property is shared with its direct synthesis precursor, the compound with formula (1). Table 3 below illustrates this type of result<br>

The distribution of cells expressing hypocretins in the lateral hypothalamus is studied here with posterior - anterior sampling in consecutive 80 um thick intervals. The cells are identified by immunocytochemistry using specific antibodies. The two molecules studied were administered by i.p. method with a single dose of 20 mg/kg. The animals were sacrificed three days after injection. A population of about a hundred supernumary cells is thus identified at the posterior third of the cerebral core.<br>
The behavioural activity test, the Tail Suspension Test (TST) validated by antidepressants (Ref. 7) in the Balb/c variety, was also done for the molecule in the preferred example (lelb) at a dose of 1 mg/kg i.p. The experiment given as an example was carried out three days after a single injection and the effect was compared with the effect of imipramine (30 mg/kg i.p. 30 minutes before the test) (see Table 4 below).<br><br>

Table 4<br>
The immobilisation time measured during a 6-minute period is significantly reduced three days after a single injection of the compound (lelb), the active isomer of racemic (lei). The results are the average for n animals.<br>
A receptorial profile done "in vitro" on 74 receptors and channels at a concentration of 10 micromoles x&gt;f compound (Iel) indicates that it has no interaction with the voltage dependent Na, K and Ca and SK+Ca channels, nor with catecholamine transport systems, a moderate affinity link may be suspected for the Ml and 5HT5A receptors.<br>
A study of the biodistribution of the molecule (Iel) 45 minutes after i.p. and os administration at high doses (20 and 60 mg/kg respectively) shows mat:<br>
after i.p. administration of compound (Iel) in the presence of compound (1), (synthesis precursor) is undetectable.<br>
after p.o. administration at the same time, the compound (Iel) represents 89% of the cerebral concentration and compound 1 represents only 11%.<br>
33<br><br>
for compound (Iel), the cerebral concentration/hepatic concentration ratio is identical in the two administration methods (0.41 and 0.49 respectively).<br>
These results demonstrate that the compounds according to this invention, in which the radical R of compound (I) can also represent a hydrogen atom with a double bond between carbon 14 and carbon 15 and in particular the preferred compound (Iel) and more particularly (Ielb), are specifically responsible for the observed effects described above and that their cerebral biodistribution is favourable.<br>
In conclusion, the compounds according to this invention, in which the radical R of the compound (I) may also represent a hydrogen atom with a double bond between carbon 14 and carbon 15, and in particular the preferred compound (Iel) and more particularly (lelb), are capable of inducing a plasticity phenomenon into the brain that enables resurgence of a quiescent population of noradrenergic cells of the cerulean complex in the brain of Balb/c mice. This phenotypical awakening is associated with an increase in the noradrenergic innervation of the prefrontal cortex in this genetically pure mutant line of mice mat has a low density of this front innervationr A preferred compound was identified. It is activated by os. It is thirty times more active than its<br>
■\ ■-	~-  ■■:■<br>
direct chemical precursor that has similar properties. These compounds according to this invention, in which the radical R of compound (I) can also represent a hydrogen atom with a double bond between carbon 14 and carbon 15, are also capable of long-term activation of a specific population of neurons expressing hypocretins in the lateral hypothalamus.<br>
Considering the potential efficiency of this family on central noradrenergic mediation, particularly prefrontal, and on hypocretinergic neurons for which implications in the sleep - wake cycle and animal depression models are known (Ref. 8, 9). Considering the particular controls applied in man by noradrenergic neurons in control of the humour (Ref. 10,11) and cognitive phenomena (Ref. 12). Considering the direct evidence of functional frontal and pre-frontal deficits in several psychiatric and neurological pathologies, previously observed deficits in the locus caeruleus in severe depression (Ref. 10,11,12) and in major degenerative syndromes such as Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease (Ref. 12,13). Since there is a large number of patients<br>
34 <br>
resistant to currently available therapies, the compounds according to this invention in which the radical R of compound (I) can represent also a hydrogen atom with a double bond between carbon 14 and carbon 15 and in particular, the preferred compound (Iel) and more particularly (lelb) are useful for the prevention or treatment of depressive syndromes and particularly major depressions, resistant depressions like those defined in DSM4 (Ref. 14, 15, 16) and for normalisation of the negative symptoms of bipolar depressions (Ref. 17) and schizophrenia (Ref. 18). This type of molecule is also useful for the treatment of symptomatic frontal disorders in their cognitive components (Mild Cognitive Impairment (Ref. 9); pre-demential and demential conditions related to Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease (Ref. 20)) or behaviour disorders including hypoactivity, attention problems, characterial problems (of the Attention deficit-Hyperactivity (ADHD) type (Ref. 21)), and in sleep problems particularly in hypoactivity or characterised hypersomnia (narcolepsia).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
