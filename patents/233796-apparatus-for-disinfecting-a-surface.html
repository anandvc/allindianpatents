				<td>Apparatus for Disinfecting a Surface<br>
This invention relates to apparatus for use in the disinfection of surfaces<br>
and in particular to disinfect wounds using a high concentration aqueous ozone<br>
and also to methods and apparatus for producing a high concentration aqueous<br>
solution of ozone.<br>
Wounds can be divided into two basic categories, acute and chronic.<br>
Acute wounds are caused when damage occurs to external intact skin tissue.<br>
This includes surgical wounds, bites, burns, cuts, abrasions, lacerations and<br>
more traumatic crush or gunshot wounds. Chronic wounds are associated with<br>
endogenous mechanisms connected to a predisposed condition that eventually<br>
damages the dermal tissue. Chronic wounds often result when the supply of<br>
oxygen and nutrients (perfusion) to tissues is impaired. Reduced arterial supply,<br>
venous drainage or metabolic diseases can cause chronic wound. Leg ulcers,<br>
foot ulcers and pressure sores are all examples of chronic wounds.<br>
Hunt et al (Hunt, T.K. And Hopt, H.W. 1997, Wound healing and<br>
infection - what surgeons and anaesthesiologists can do, Surg. Clin. North<br>
America. Vol.77, p587-606) state that acute wounds will heal rapidly if<br>
blood perfusion is maximised, thus providing the cells of the immune<br>
system the oxygen and nutrients necessary to ward off infection. Oxygen<br>
is an integral requirement for cell growth, division and wound healing<br>
Grief et al (Grief R., Akca, O., Horn, E., Kurz, A., and Sessler, D.J. 2000.<br>
Supplemental perioperative oxygen to reduce the incidence of<br>
surgical wound infection. The New England Journal o f Medicine. Vol<br>
342, pl61-167). It is also critical for the respiratory<br>
burst of Polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs), which produce<br>
potent anti-microbial compounds. As well as providing the<br>
energy for metabolic reactions and hence infection defence<br>
mechanisms, oxygen also plays a major role in determining<br>
the oxidation - reduction potential of tissues. Bakker<br>
(Bakker, D.J. 1998. Severe trauma and infections.<br>
Anaesthesia. Vol 53, p65-67). Wound microbiology and<br>
associated approaches) identifies that a low redox potential<br>
favours the growth of anaerobic bacteria. Bowler et al<br>
(Bowler, P.G. Duerden, D.I., and Armstrong, D.G. 2001.<br>
Wound microbiology and associated approaches to wound<br>
management. Clinical Microbiology Reviews. Vol 14, No 2,<br>
p244-269) state that a low redox potential will facilitate<br>
the development of synergistic aerobic/anaerobic<br>
populations.<br>
Wounds often have a diverse array of microflora. The<br>
primary pathogens involved in the infection of chronic and<br>
acute wounds are thought to be Staphylococcus aureus,<br>
Pseudomonas aeruginosa and beta-hemolytic streptococci.<br>
These pathogens are aerobic or facultative. However,<br>
anaerobic pathogens are often overlooked in wound infection<br>
investigations, because they reside deep within the dermal<br>
tissue. Anaerobic micro-organism isolation, identification<br>
and collection are time consuming and labour intensive.<br>
Bowler et al (referred to above) investigated and conclude<br>
that there is correlation between the incidence of anaerobic<br>
pathogens and the prevalence of infection. Bascom (Bascom,<br>
J.U. 1996. Pilonidal care: anerobes as visible villans.<br>
European Journal of Surgery. Vol 162, p351)reports that<br>
anaerobic bacteria are the true causative micro-organisms of<br>
wound infection and that improved oxygenation of wounds is<br>
required to minimise infection.<br>
The polymicrobial nature of wounds has been widely<br>
published, however Staphylococcus aureus is considered to be<br>
the most problematic bacterium in traumatic, surgical and<br>
burn wound infections Bowler et al (referred to above),<br>
Tengrove et al (Tengrove, N.J., Stacey, M.C. McGechie, D.F.<br>
and Mata, S. 1996. Qualitative bacteriology and leg ulcer<br>
healing. Journal of wound care. Vol 5, p277-280) report<br>
that when four or more bacterial groups are present within a<br>
leg ulcer, the likelihood of healing is significantly<br>
reduced. This finding promotes the hypothesis that microbial<br>
synergy occurs within wounds increasing the net pathogenic<br>
effect and severity of the infection. Oxygen consumption by<br>
aerobic bacteria induces tissue hypoxia and lowers the redox<br>
potential, which provides a more favourable habitat for<br>
anaerobic organisms. Nutrients produced by one micro-<br>
organism may encourage the growth of potentially pathogenic<br>
co-habiting micro-organisms. Some anaerobes are able to<br>
impair host immune cell function and hence provide an<br>
advantage for themselves and other co-habiting micro-<br>
organisms. Bowler (Bowler, P.G. 2002. Microbiology of acute<br>
and chronic wounds. Facing the challenge of wound<br>
management in the 21st Century. Master Misericordiae<br>
University Hospital) states that micro-organisms are able to<br>
aid each other within a wound. Micro-organisms (especially<br>
in biofilms) use a communication mechanism called Quorum<br>
sensing. This is a cell density dependent form of<br>
communication, facilitating survival in a new harsh<br>
environment. They release signalling molecules informing<br>
each other of "survival tips" (i.e. produce a specific<br>
morphological change or a specific defensive chemical).<br>
Debridement is an integral part of wound healing. The<br>
removal of dead and unhealthy tissue is essential to<br>
minimise the habitat available for microbial colonisation<br>
and allow new tissue formation. Debridement is achieved<br>
through physical removal of tissue using a sharp instrument<br>
or the application of saline or sterile water. The<br>
management of bite wounds involves high pressure irrigation<br>
to reduce microbial load.<br>
Historically ozone has been used to disinfect wounds in<br>
its gaseous form or dissolved within oil. Direct ozone gas<br>
application, intravenous injection, rectal insufflation or<br>
autohemo-ozonotherapy are all known methods of medical ozone<br>
application. Reference should be made to the following<br>
Patent Publications for details of such treatments: RU-<br>
2178699, FR-2784388, US-6073627.<br>
Aqueous Ozone Hypotheses<br>
1. Disinfection<br>
1.1. Ozone is highly reactive and decomposes through<br>
the formation of free radicals to form molecular oxygen.<br>
Free radicals have an unpaired electron in their outer<br>
orbital making them highly unstable and reactive. These free<br>
radicals comprise hydroxyl, superoxide or ozonide radicals.<br>
Ozone micro-organism attack is primarily on the cellular<br>
membrane, with damage subsequently occurring to other cell<br>
sites. The proposed mechanism of action is thought, in large<br>
part, to relate to the olefinic bonds within the micro-<br>
organism cell membrane being attacked by ozone to form an<br>
ozonide or other decomposition product. The ozonide reacts<br>
with enzymes, sulfhydryl groups and aldehydes, releasing<br>
peroxyl compounds. The peroxyl compounds further damage<br>
proteins, DNA and other structures. The cell is lysed and<br>
the cytoplasm dispersed. In essence, the aqueous ozone would<br>
be used to reduce the microbiological organisms within the<br>
wound.<br>
1.2. Aqueous ozone will be particularly effective against<br>
anaerobic bacteria due to their lack of anti-oxidants and<br>
other oxidation defence systems. Aerobic bacteria produce<br>
anti-oxidants such as superoxide dismutase to prevent<br>
cellular damage caused through respiration using oxygen.<br>
Anaerobic bacteria do not use oxygen to respire and hence<br>
have not evolved advanced anti-oxidants. The removal of<br>
anaerobic bacteria will reduce the likelihood of infection<br>
Bowler (referred to above).<br>
1.3. Free radical based oxidation is random and hence it<br>
will be extremely difficult for a micro-organism to develop<br>
resistance to aqueous ozone. Free radical based disinfection<br>
does not involve target site specificity. Free radicals will<br>
be effective against all micro-organisms, with the killing<br>
rate being dependent on, among other things, the prevalence<br>
of anti-oxidants within different microbial species.<br>
1.4. A sufficiently long contact period will remove all<br>
micro-organisms from a wound bed, creating a sterile<br>
environment.<br>
2. Debridement<br>
2.1. Aqueous ozone is not cell specific and will attack the<br>
wound tissue as well as the micro-organisms. Unhealthy or<br>
dead tissue is less well perfused than healthy tissue and as<br>
such does not contain as much anti-oxidant or enzymatic<br>
agents (superoxide, dismutase, glutathione, macrophage,<br>
etc). The unhealthy tissues will mount a far weaker defence<br>
against the free radical attack than the healthy tissues and<br>
hence will be more prone to damage/rupture/removal than<br>
healthy tissues. Hence, the aqueous ozone will provide a<br>
quasi-selective chemical debridement system, creating an<br>
improved healing environment.<br>
3. Moist healing environment<br>
3.1. The application of aqueous ozone will provide a moist<br>
healing environment (in conjunction with 1.4.). A moist<br>
healing environment is. critical to wound healing Winter<br>
(Winter, G.D. 1962. Formation of scab and the rate of<br>
epithelization of superficial wounds in the skin. Nature.<br>
Vol 193, p293-294).<br>
4. Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS)<br>
4.1. Aqueous ozone produces Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) as<br>
decomposition intermediaries. The ROS produced will<br>
complement the bodies own natural defence system in which<br>
polymorphonucleocytes (PMNs) produce ROS to remove micro-<br>
organisms. The aqueous ozone healing system is biomimetic,<br>
providing a "booster" when the bodies own PMNs have been<br>
overwhelmed by infection.<br>
4.2. Aqueous ozone will act as an ROS generator in poorly<br>
perfused ischemic tissues. The lack of perfusion inhibits<br>
the body's own production of ROS through a deficiency in<br>
nutrient/oxygen/energy. The aqueous ozone artificially<br>
creates the body's natural infection removal mechanism.<br>
4.3. ROS will support the formation of blood vessels<br>
(angiogenesis) and stimulate collagen production (Sen, C.K.,<br>
Khanna, S., Babiar, B.M., Hunt, T.K., Ellison, E.C., and<br>
Roy, S. 2002. Redox control of wound repair. JCB (paper in<br>
press) Manuscript M203391200).<br>
4.4. Micro-organisms communicate through quorum sensing,<br>
which is facilitated through the release of signalling<br>
molecules. ROS may actively oxidise these signalling<br>
molecules reducing synergistic survival effects. This<br>
mechanism would be important in reducing any biofilm<br>
formation.<br>
5. Oxygenation<br>
5.1. Aqueous ozone decomposes to water and oxygen. The<br>
decomposition reaction takes place within the wound<br>
providing surface application of oxygen to cells and<br>
produces a hyperoxic environment. Anaerobic bacteria cannot<br>
survive in a hyperoxic environment, reducing infection.<br>
5.2. A hyperoxic environment produced through aqueous ozone<br>
application can provide a source of oxygen to poorly<br>
perfused tissues (ischemic), which may improve wound<br>
healing.<br>
5.3. Cytokines and growth factors show an improved<br>
mechanistic action in a hyperoxic environment, which can be<br>
facilitated through the use of aqueous ozone application<br>
equipment.<br>
5.4. The aqueous ozone application equipment contains an<br>
oxygen concentrator that can be used to provide high<br>
pressure sterile oxygen to a wound. Oxygen is critical to<br>
the wound healing process. The equipment allows the<br>
application of oxygen to the wound via a high pressure jet<br>
or through the use of a hyperbaric chamber around the wound<br>
area.<br>
6. Acute wound response<br>
6.1. Research has identified that inflicting an acute wound<br>
within a chronic wound can induce a wound healing response.<br>
The cellular oxidation caused by aqueous ozone application<br>
may induce an acute wound type response within a non-healing<br>
chronic wound.<br>
Qzonated water<br>
Ozonated water is widely used to kill bacteria and<br>
other micro-organisms. However, when generating and<br>
dissolving ozone in water it is usual to expect levels of<br>
under 1ppm.<br>
WO-A-0020343 discloses an apparatus for producing an<br>
aqueous ozone solution to disinfect animal house feed water.<br>
The process requires pressurisation of the contactor to<br>
facilitate ozonation.<br>

dissolution of gasses in liquids. The method uses a<br>
plurality of nozzles sized and sited to produce micro-fine<br>

ozone gas. The treatment is based upon the application of<br>
gas to the wound.<br>
US-A-4375812 discloses a method for treating burn<br>
injuries with aqueous ozone involving submerging the<br>

It is an object of the present invention to produce a<br>
high concentration ozone solution capable of rapid<br>
disinfection and to provide a method and apparatus for<br>
applying a high concentration ozone solution to a surface to<br>
be disinfected and in particular to a human or animal wound.<br>
This invention discloses an apparatus for disinfecting<br>
surfaces and in particular human and animal wounds, although<br>
described in the context of a wound surface the scope of the<br>
invention covers all types of surfaces, comprising a<br>
reservoir for accumulating ozonated water and means to<br>
deliver ozonated water from the reservoir to a nozzle having<br>
one or more jets for delivering a spray of ozonated water on<br>
to the surface to be treated. The nozzle has an encircling<br>
shroud and means are provided for withdrawing ozonated gas<br>
liberated at the nozzle from around the nozzle. A<br>
collection tray is provided which is located under the<br>
surface/wound to be treated to receive ozonated water<br>
flowing from the treatment region. The base of a catchment<br>
tray can contain a number of holes through which used<br>
solution is drawn out of the tray by a pump which causes the<br>
solution to pass through a catalyst to break down any<br>
residual ozone contained in the solution.<br>
The following is a description of some specific<br>
embodiments of the invention, reference being made to the<br>
accompanying drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic illustration of a system for<br>
generating and applying ozonated water to a wound;<br>
Figure 2 illustrates a first modification to the<br>
system;<br>
Figure 3 illustrates a second modification;<br>
Figures 4 to 10 illustrate a spray head for the<br>
apparatus; and<br>
Figures 11 to 15 illustrate a catchment tray and limb<br>
support for a patient to be treated.<br>
Referring firstly to Figure 1 of the drawings, the<br>
apparatus for performing the invention comprises three main<br>
components: an apparatus for generating a concentrated<br>
aqueous solution of ozone indicated at 10; an apparatus for<br>
spraying the ozone solution onto a surface of a limb to be<br>
treated indicated at 11; and an apparatus for supporting a<br>
limb to be treated and for collecting solution which flows<br>
off the treated limb for disposal indicated at 11a. A<br>
control system (not shown) is provided for the whole<br>
apparatus comprising a programmable logic computer which<br>
interfaces with the controllable elements of the apparatus<br>
to control the operation of the apparatus.<br>
The aqueous ozone generator 10 comprises a contactor 12<br>
which is connected to a reservoir of water 13 via a pump 14<br>
and solenoid controlled valve 15. Figure 2 shows an<br>
alternative arrangement in which mains water is supplied via<br>
a pressure restriction valve. The pump 14 is activated and<br>
solenoid valve 15 is opened to transfer water from the<br>
reservoir into the contactor 12 until a sufficient level is<br>
reached to activate a water level sensor 16. The sensor<br>
activates a relay sending a signal back to the PLC, which<br>
turns off a pump 14 and closes a solenoid valve 15.<br>
The contactor has a conduit 17 extending from an<br>
upwardly facing inlet 18 adjacent the top of the contactor<br>
through a pump 19 and a differential pressure injection 20<br>
(such as a Mazzei injector as disclosed in US-A-5863128) and<br>
thence to an outlet 21 into the contactor adjacent the<br>
bottom of the contactor. The pump 19 is activated taking in<br>
water through the inlet 18, circulating through the<br>
differential pressure injector 20 and returning it to the<br>
contactor via the nozzle outlet 21. The nozzle serves two<br>
functions. Primarily it provides the back pressure required<br>
by the differential injector and secondly, it increases the<br>
gas/liquid mixing within the contactor.<br>
An oxygen supply 22, preferentially using an oxygen<br>
concentrator, supplies dry oxygen gas through a throttle<br>
valve 23 and a pressure regulator 24 to an ozone generator<br>
25. The valve and regulator can be located either before or<br>
after the ozone generator. The ozone generator can utilise<br>
ultra violet, proton exchange membrane or corona discharge<br>
based production methods, but preferentially is an air<br>
cooled corona based ozone generator.<br>
The ozone generator is activated and a solenoid valve<br>
26 is opened. Ozone is drawn through the differential<br>
pressure injector 20 where it contacts the water. The<br>
gas/liquid mixture stream is forced through the outlet<br>
nozzle 21 and into the contactor 12. Ozone gas bubbles move<br>
up through the contactor and exit at an outlet 27 into a<br>
pipe 28.<br>
The pipe 28 is angled downwardly towards the outlet so<br>
that any condensation that occurs within the pipe runs back<br>
down through the outlet and into the contactor 12.<br>
Any ozone gas which reaches pipe 28 passes through a<br>
destruct device 30, where it is broken down into oxygen. A<br>
heating element 30a is activated heating ozone destruct unit<br>
30. A temperature sensor 30b is linked back into the<br>
programmable logic computer (PLC), which controls the<br>
heating process and maintains the destruct unit 30 at a<br>
constant temperature between 40 and 80°C, but preferentially<br>
60°C. The destruct 30 is heated, which prevents moisture<br>
forming within the destruct itself. The oxygen gas which<br>
exits destruct 30 passes into manifold 31. The oxygen gas<br>
is drawn from the manifold by a fan 32 and into a secondary<br>
ozone destruct device 32a. The oxygen gas exits the<br>
secondary ozone destruct device from where it is directed<br>
onto the ozone generator 25 referred to earlier where it<br>
aids in cooling the unit.<br>
Returning to the ozonation process in the contactor,<br>
inlet 18 to the re-circulation system has an upturned end<br>
and is shaped to prevent ozone gas bubbles being sucked into<br>
the re-circulation system. The agueous ozone concentration<br>
is monitored by a dissolved ozone sensor 33 linked into the<br>
PLC. When the dissolved ozone concentration reaches the<br>
desired level, set by the operator, the PLC switches off the<br>
oxygen concentrator and the ozone generator and closes<br>
solenoid controlled valve 26. Pump 19 is switched off and a<br>
pump 34 activated for delivering the aqueous solution of<br>
ozone to the spray system 11. A solenoid valve 35 is opened<br>
and the solution moves along the pipe where the pressure is<br>
restricted to between 40 and 100 mbar, but preferentially 70<br>
mbar, by a pressure and flow regulator 36.<br>
The aqueous ozone solution is delivered to one end of<br>
an inner conduit 37 of a pair of concentric conduits 37,38.<br>
The other end of conduit 37 has a spray head 39 for delivery<br>
of multiple jets of aqueous ozone.<br>
The spray head is illustrated in Figures 4 to 10 and is<br>
designed and constructed so as to produce a series of jets,<br>
preferentially in an interlocking fan configuration. The<br>
spray system although appearing simple has a number of<br>
important features. When high concentration ozone solution<br>
is forced through an aperture a pressure differential is<br>
created and causes the ozone gas dissolved in the stream to<br>
come out of solution into the atmosphere (due to ozone's<br>
vapour pressure). The higher the pressure differential the<br>
greater the amount of gas liberated to atmosphere. The<br>
legal atmospheric limit for ozone is 0.1ppm, which is very<br>
low. Hence the spray head has been developed to use "jet<br>
holes" 41 (see Figures 7 and 10) that are sufficiently small<br>
to use low quantities of solution (facilitating the small<br>
size of the unit) and yet have a large enough diameter to<br>
prevent an excessively high pressure differential being<br>
created that liberates too much ozone gas from the solution.<br>
The pressure at which the ozone solution is supplied to the<br>
head is also a factor and tests have indicated that a level<br>
around 70 mbar is the most suitable. Higher pressures mean<br>
more ozone gas is liberated to atmosphere and also causes<br>
the jets to be too powerful "drilling" bugs down into the<br>
surface of the wound.<br>
As the solution exits the spray head 39, the pressure<br>
drop causes ozone gas to come out of solution. An<br>
overlapping arrangement of the jets as can be seen in Figurs<br>
4 and 5 minimises the surface to Volume area of the outer<br>
edges of the spray cone, thus reducing the amount of ozone<br>
gas that is liberated from the solution. Ozone will rapidly<br>
decompose in air and hence the reduced surface to volume -<br>
ratio is critical in preventing the decomposition of the<br>
ozone solution as it is travelling from the spray head to<br>
the wounds surface. The jets operate at very low pressures<br>
to minimise the amount of ozone gas that escapes from<br>
solution and also to ensure that micro-organisms are not<br>
driven down into the wound bed. The spray head is located<br>
within a head attachment (further referred to as the "cone<br>
head") 40, shaped to match the dimensions of the "jet cone"<br>
produced by the spray head. The length of the cone head is<br>
dependent upon the pressure of the jets, but is<br>
preferentially 125mm. The inside of the cone head is<br>
maintained at a negative pressure to the atmosphere by the<br>
fan 32 connected to the manifold 31. Any ozone gas released<br>
from solution in the spraying process is drawn back through<br>
outer conduit 38 into the manifold and subsequently passed<br>
through a secondary ozone destruct 32a, where it is<br>
decomposed to oxygen.<br>
In use the cone head 40 is positioned over a wound to<br>
be decontaminated/healed. The distance from the wound<br>
surface to the edge of the cone head is dependent on the<br>
pressure of the jets but is preferentially 10mm.<br>
The patient whose wound is to be disinfected/healed can<br>
be bed-ridden or mobile. A collection tray 43 which will be<br>
described in greater detail below is placed under the<br>
patient's appendage on which the wound is located. The<br>
catchment tray contains a jointed support mechanism (not<br>
shown) that takes the weight of the patient's appendage<br>
during the treatment. The support mechanism can be rigid or<br>
flexible, but preferentially comprises of a removable padded<br>
concave or convex support, located upon a knuckle joint to<br>
facilitate horizontal rotation. This in turn is located on a<br>
stem fixed to the collection device by means of a joint 47<br>
that allows the stem to move in an arc in the vertical<br>
plane. Preferentially this is a pin joint. The catchment<br>
tray has a removable insert 48 that has holes 49 in it to<br>
allow the used solution to drain to the base of the tray.<br>
This insert 48 will preferentially be a 'Vee' with a series<br>
of holes 49 that allow the solution to drain through but<br>
retain any large biological material flushed off the wound<br>
in the disinfection process. The catchment tray has side<br>
flanges 50 upon which the spray head system is mounted.<br>
The spray head 39 is fixed to a mounting and support<br>
device (not shown) that securely holds the spray cone in<br>
position above the wound. This mounting device can comprise<br>
of a wide range of structures to retain the head in its<br>
required position, typically either a mechanical or<br>
electromagnetic device to provide attachment to a flexi-<br>
rigid conduit upon which the spray head is clamped.<br>
The base of the catchment tray 43 contains a number of<br>
holes 51 through which the used solution is drawn out of the<br>
tray. A pump 52 creates a negative pressure within vessel<br>
53 coupled to the tray (see Figure 1) causing the liquid in<br>
the collection tray to be drawn into the vessel 53. The gas<br>
removed from vessel 53 by pump 52 is directed into manifold<br>
31, where it passes through the secondary catalyst 32a. Any<br>
residual ozone gas released by the used solution is<br>
decomposed here.<br>
The solution is applied to the wound for a period of<br>
time determined by the operator and programmed into the PLC<br>
at the start of the treatment. Once the required duration<br>
has past, the PLC closes valve 35 and continues to operate<br>
fan 32 and pump 52 for a defined period of time to clear the<br>
catchment tray of solution. During this period valve 60 is<br>
opened and the solution within the contactor is pumped into<br>
vessel 53, until level, switch 61 in the contactor is<br>
activated. Pump 34 is turned off and valve 60 is closed.<br>
After this period has passed the pump 52 and fan 32 are<br>
switched off.<br>
The inlets and outlets of vessels comprise of quick<br>
connect couplings to facilitate their ease of removal and<br>
attachment. At the end of the treatment, vessel 53 is<br>
disconnected and the water contained within it poured<br>
straight to drain.<br>
Figure 3 shows an alternative arrangement of the<br>
apparatus, whereby vessel 53 is removed and the contents of<br>
the catchment tray are pumped directly to drain via a pump.<br>
The excess solution remaining in the contactor is pumped<br>
directly to drain as opposed to vessel 53. This solution can<br>
pass through a carbon filter 65 within the waste pipe line<br>
to destroy any ozone that may remain.<br>
The system is described operating with tap water taken<br>
from a domestic or commercial supply. The invention does not<br>
preclude the use of a filtered or conditioned water supply.<br>
Such a water supply will have an effect of speeding up the<br>
ozonation process, but is not the preferred water supply of<br>
use due to the reduction in portability filtration systems<br>
present.<br>
The ability to capture and destroy as much as possible<br>
of any aqueous ozone gas released to atmosphere from any<br>
aqueous ozone solution is paramount to the successful<br>
operation of any unit. The following apparatus is directed<br>
to that objective.<br>
Figure 7 is an illustration of the nozzle 39 and<br>
encircling shroud 40 for the nozzle for applying ozonated<br>
water to a patient's wound or other surface; and Figures 11<br>
to 15 illustrate the catchment tray supporting the area of<br>
the patient's limb or body to be treated and for recovering<br>
ozonated water which flows off the area of the patient being<br>
treated.<br>
Aqueous ozone is created by dissolving ozone gas into<br>
liquid. The saturated, vapour pressure of ozone is &gt;760mmHg<br>
at 25 C, which means that ozone will actively diffuse out of<br>
the liquid into the atmosphere. Ozone has a legal exposure<br>
limit of 0.1 ppm and hence this poses a problem when a high<br>
concentration aqueous ozone solution is exposed to the<br>
atmosphere (the ozone teadily comes out of solution and the<br>
concentration in the atmosphere rises above the 0.1ppm<br>
limit).<br>
The rate at which the ozone gas liberates from the<br>
liquid is highly dependent on temperature and pressure. The<br>
higher the temperature the more ozone comes out of solution<br>
and the lower the pressure the more ozone comes out of<br>
solution.<br>
The aqueous ozone solution is produced at atmospheric<br>
pressure. It is then placed under increased pressure as it<br>
is pumped to the spray head. When it is under pressure<br>
(i.e. in the pipe from the pump to the spray head) no ozone<br>
comes out of solution, because of the fact that it has been<br>
put under increased pressure. When it reaches the spray<br>
head, it is suddenly exposed to normal atmospheric<br>
conditions (i.e. a drop in pressure occurs) and hence a<br>
proportion of the ozone contained in the liquid stream is<br>
released to atmosphere. There is a pressure differential<br>
created across the aperture(s) in the spray head. The size<br>
of this pressure differential determines the amount of ozone<br>
gas that is released from the liquid as it exits the spray<br>
head. The release of ozone gas has two consequences, the<br>
first has already been explained, ozone gas is toxic and<br>
hence raises the atmospheric concentration above the legal<br>
exposure limit. The second is that the concentration of the<br>
aqueous ozone fluid drops. The purpose of the system is to<br>
apply a high concentration solution to the wound, hence the<br>
amount of concentration loss due to ozone gas liberation<br>
needs to be minimised.<br>
Experiments were conducted using spray heads with<br>
varying sized apertures combined with alternating pressures<br>
from the pump. It was found that a 0.5mm diameter aperture<br>
is the most effective size, combined with a liquid pressure<br>
of 70mbar. 0.2mm diameter apertures produced a pressure<br>
differential that was too large and liberated a substantial<br>
amount of ozone gas, dropping the solution concentration<br>
from 20ppm down to 12ppm. A 0.75mm diameter aperture<br>
allowed too much liquid through the head. Too much liquid<br>
will cause a wound to macerate and hence would inhibit<br>
rather than aid the healing process.<br>
The 0.5mm diameter aperture still allows a proportion<br>
of the ozone gas to escape from the liquid, due to the<br>
change in pressure. The concentration drops from 20ppm to<br>
17ppm. The ozone gas that escapes to the atmosphere has to<br>
be dealt with; otherwise over a period of time the<br>
cumulative effect would raise the ozone concentration above<br>
0.1ppm. To that end the spray head is surrounded by an<br>
extraction system 38,40, so that as the ozone gas is<br>
liberated on exiting the spray head it is immediately taken<br>
back into the machine in the extract air stream.<br>
The use of an extract system dictates the design and<br>
shape of the spray pattern exiting the spray head. The<br>
implementation of an extract system means that ozone gas is<br>
continually being stripped from the surface of the air borne<br>
aqueous liquid from the spray head to the wound.<br>
The amount of ozone gas being removed can be limited by<br>
reducing the surface to volume ratio of the spray cone. The<br>
optimal spray configuration is one that has a very small<br>
surface area exposed to the extract air stream, whilst<br>
providing a large surface impact area. The spray head has a<br>
series of interlocked jets (see Figures 4 and 5) that<br>
produce a dual fan effect. This may or may not be the most<br>
optimal configuration for the spray pattern.<br>
The extract "shroud" 40 is intended to be a consumable<br>
item (i.e. it can be quickly replaced between patients).<br>
As explained earlier, ozone gas actively diffuses out<br>
of aqueous solution. When aqueous ozone is sprayed on to a<br>
wound or other organic surface, a large proportion of the<br>
ozone is broken down on the surface. However, the waste<br>
run-off liquid still contains ozone, which, as previously<br>
described, will actively enter into the atmosphere. The<br>
catchment tray has two main "concepts" that allow it to<br>
function.<br>
The first of these relates to the catchment tray 43<br>
which is basically a tray that has a solid plastic insert<br>
48, which is angled in an inverted V shape. A series of<br>
holes 49 (e.g. four cm apart are drilled along the apex of<br>
the V. The insert allows aqueous ozone solution to pass<br>
through the holes, but capture any gas released in the gap<br>
underneath the insert preventing it from escaping to<br>
atmosphere.<br>
The second concept of the catchment tray is a catalyst<br>
break down arrangement. A pair of six inch fans 70 are<br>
mounted horizontally above the waste liquid collection area<br>
71. Below each fan is a bed 72 of ruthenium pellets or<br>
other catalytic material, through which the fans draws air.<br>
As can be seen in Figure 11 the fans draws in air (and<br>
hence any atmospheric ozone, as ozone is heavier than air)<br>
through the holes in the V shaped insert. The air passes<br>
over the aqueous ozone liquid drawing off any ozone gas that<br>
may be coming out of the solution. This ozone air mix is<br>
then drawn through a catalyst, which converts it into<br>
oxygen. The oxygen is released into the atmosphere.<br>
Thus the system takes a number of previous systems<br>
(ozone generator, oxygen concentrator, differential pressure<br>
injector) and combines them in such a way as to produce a<br>
portable and highly mobile unit that is able to produce very<br>
high aqueous ozone concentrations (&gt;20ppm).<br>
Previous aqueous ozone based disinfection systems have<br>
been based on large less-portable systems or on mobile<br>
systems that can only produce low concentration aqueous<br>
ozone solutions (5ppm). The concept of applying ozone to<br>
wounds is not novel, however the theories developed based on<br>
the inventors research and understanding of biological<br>
systems and their modes of interaction with aqueous ozone is<br>
novel. The development of an effective system to apply high<br>
concentration aqueous ozone to a human (or animal) without<br>
endangering the patient through exposure to ozone gas is<br>
novel and inventive. The invention incorporates an aqueous<br>
ozone delivery system that delivers the high concentration<br>
solution to the wound surface whilst minimising the amount<br>
of ozone gas released from that solution. The design of the<br>
spray configuration, the pressure requirements and the spray<br>
head enclosure design are all novel in regard to minimising<br>
ozone gas release. The use of an extraction system to remove<br>
ozone gas from the wound area is novel, as is the design,<br>
which incorporates the aqueous ozone delivery conduit and<br>
ozone gas extract into a single pipe system.<br>
The catchment tray also incorporates other important<br>
design features. The perforated insert tray is designed to<br>
allow aqueous ozone solution to pass through to the bottom<br>
of the tray. Ozone gas is heavier than air and hence will<br>
remain at the bottom of the tray. The insert 48 functions to<br>
trap the ozone gas in the bottom of the tray away from the<br>
patient. Waste solution within the tray is removed by a<br>
peristaltic pump and fan system, therefore removing the<br>
ozone gas as well as the waste solution. The arrangement<br>
has been designed so that all sources of ozone gas are<br>
extracted back to a single manifold at the input to the<br>
systems main fan, which forces the gas through a catalytic<br>
destruct. The design of the system is novel and inventive in<br>
that a single catalyst is used as a final destruct for gas<br>
coming from three individual sources. Further, the<br>
catalytically reacted gas is directed to and exhausted over<br>
the surface of the ozone generator, which is preferentially<br>
an air-cooled (as opposed to water-cooled) generator.<br>
The primary catalytic destruct is novel and inventive.<br>
Catalytic destructs are designed to operate with dry gas<br>
supplies, as water poisons most catalysts. The design of the<br>
system allows the catalyst to destroy wet ozone gas, without<br>
damaging the catalyst.<br>
The apparatus allows the user to determine the<br>
concentration of the solution that is to be applied to the<br>
surface (preferentially ranging from 1 - 21ppm). The user<br>
is able to select the aqueous ozone concentration required<br>
at the start of the cycle. The user is also able to select<br>
the duration for which the solution is to be applied to the<br>
surface.<br>
