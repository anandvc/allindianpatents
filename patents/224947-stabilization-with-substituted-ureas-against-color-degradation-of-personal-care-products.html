DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now it has been found that certain types of unsaturated organic materials in personal care compositions can be preserved against degradation into visible color species. Materials requiring stabilization are those with at least one olefinic double bond such as<br>
5	 the C10-C50 terpenoids and the C12 -C48 unsaturated fatty compounds. The latter include fatty alcohols, fatty acids, fatty acid salts, fatty acid glycerides, fatty acid esters and combinations thereof. Color inhibition is achieved through use of substituted ureas.<br>
By the term personal care composition is meant any product applied to a human body for improving appearance, cleansing, odor control or general aesthetics. Non-limiting <br>
10 	examples of personal care compositions include leave-on skin lotions and creams, shampoos, conditioners, shower gels, toilet bars, antiperspirants, deodorants, dental products, shave creams, depilatories, lipsticks, foundations, mascara, sunless tanners and sunscreen lotions.<br>
An important element of the present invention is the color stabilization agent. This is a <br>
15     substituted urea having general structure (I)<br>
O R1R2NCNR3R4<br>
20	I<br>
wherein R1,R2 and R3 are selected from the group consisting of hydrogen, C1-C6 alkyl, (R5)nOH, and mixtures thereof; R5 is methylene, ethylene, propylene or combinations thereof, and n ranges from 1 to 6; and R4 is (R5)nOH.<br>
Illustrative species of the substituted urea are hydroxymethyl urea, hydroxyethyl urea, <br>
25     hydroxypropyl urea; bis(hydroxymethyl) urea; bis(hydroxyethyl) urea; bis(hydroxypropyl)<br>
urea; N,N'-di-hydroxymethyl urea; N.N'-di-hydroxyethyl urea; N.N'-di-hydroxypropyl urea;<br>
N.N.N'-tri-hydroxyethyl   urea;   tetra(hydroxymethyl)   urea;   tetra(hydroxyethyl)   urea;<br>
tetra(hydroxypropyl) urea; N-methyl-N'- hydroxyethyl urea; N-ethyl-N'-hydroxyethyl urea;<br>
N-hydroxypropyl-N'- hydroxyethyl urea and N,N'-dimethyl-N-hydroxyethyl urea. Where <br>
30     the term hydroxypropyl appears, the meaning is generic for either 3-hydroxy-n-propyl, 2-<br><br>
WO 2005/079740<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013959<br><br>
-3-<br>
hydroxy-n-propyl, 3-hydroxy-i-propyl or 2-hydroxy-i-propyl radicals. Most preferred is hydroxyethyl urea. The latter is available as a 50% aqueous liquid from the National Starch &amp; Chemical Division of ICI under the trademark Hydrovance.<br>
Amounts of the substituted urea may range from 0.01 to 20%, preferably from 0.1 to 10%,<br>
5  	more preferably from 1 to 8%, and optimally from 3 to 6% wAv of the composition.<br>
Components of the personal care compositions susceptible to color degradation are materials which have at least one olefinic bond, and particularly those with at least 2, 3 or 4 olefinic bonds. Especially susceptible to color producing bodies are those compounds where the olefin bond is conjugated with other olefin, alkyne or aromatic pi bonded systems.<br>
Unsaturated fatty acid or alcohol derivatives may be susceptible to color body formation. By the term fatty is meant an alkyl chain length from C12 to C48, most often from C12 to C24. Typical fatty acids of this category are oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid, ricinoleic acid, elaidic acid, petroselenic acid, erucic acid, palmitoleic acid, myristoleic acid and 12-hydroxyoleic acid. Most common of the aforementioned fatty acids are oleic acid, linoleic acid, linolenic acid and ricinoleic acid. Exemplative unsaturated fatty alcohols include oleyl alcohol, linoleyl alcohol, linolenyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. Among the salts are the sodium, ammonium, potassium and triethanolammonium fatty acid salts. Illustrative but not limiting are salts such as sodium oleate, potassium oleate, ammonium oleate, triethanolammonium oleate, sodium linolenate, potassium linolenate, ammonium linolenate and triethanolammonium linolenate. Longer chain unsaturated fatty acids are illustrated by a group generically known as conjugated linoleic acids.<br>
Conjugated linoleic acids (referred to as CLA) are illustrative of polyunsaturated compounds of the present invention susceptible to color body formation. These comprise a group of positional and geometric isomers of linoleic acid in which various configurations of cis and trans double bonds at positions (6,8), (7,9), (8,10), (9,11), (10, 12) or (11, 13) are possible. Thus, twenty-four different isomers of CLA exist. Conjugated is a term meaning adjacent pairs of double bonds forming an extended pi orbital system.<br><br>

Gfycerides are a further category of the unsaturated fatty compounds. These may be mono- di- or tri- glycerides. One, two or three of the fatty acid chains esterified to the glycerol are unsaturated. Nonlimiting examples of glycerides include sunflower seed oil, soybean oil, olive oil, cotton seed oil, groundnut oil, shea nut oil, palm oil, cocoa butter, illipe, borage and borage seed oil, coriander seed oil, linseed oil, safflower oil, triglycerides with conjugated linoleic acid residues and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
10<br><br>
Terpenoids are another category of unsaturated organic materials according to the present invention. Terpenoids may be further divided into classes such as alcohols, ethers, aldehydes, acetals, acids, ketones, ester and terpene compounds that contain hetero atoms such as nitrogen or sulphur. The tables which follow describe illustrative but not limiting examples.<br><br>

Another subclass of the terpenoids category are the sterols.   Examples are betulin (betulinic acid and alcohol), cholesterol, sitosterol, ergosterol. stigmasterol, and linosterol.<br>
Amounts of the unsaturated material which may lead to color formation may range from <br>
35      0.0001 to 20%. usually from 0.001 to 10%, more usually from 0.1 to 5% w/w.<br><br>

Advantageously but not necessarily the amount of the substituted urea relative to the unsaturated material ranges in weight from 10,000:1 to 1:100, preferably from 1,000:1 to 1:10, more preferably from 500:1 to 1:5, optimally from 100:1 to 10:1.<br>
5     	Certain types of unsaturated material of the present invention can be characterized by an Iodine Value ranging from 20 to 300, preferably from 30 to 200, optimally from 50 to 150. Iodine Values are often associated with fatty compounds such as the fatty acids, fatty alcohols, fatty acid salts and fatty acid glycerides.<br>
10	Compositions of this invention will also include a cosmetically acceptable carrier. Amounts of the carrier may range from 1 to 99.9%, preferably from 70 to 95%, optimally from 80 to 90% by weight of the composition. Among the useful carriers are water, saturated emollients, saturated fatty acids, saturated fatty alcohols, humectants, thickeners and combinations thereof.   The carrier may be aqueous, anhydrous or an<br>
15	emulsion. Preferably the compositions are aqueous, especially water and oil emulsions of the W/O or O/W or triplex W/O/W variety. Water when present may be in amounts ranging from 5 to 95%, preferably from 20 to 70%, optimally from 35 to 60% w/w.<br>
Emollient materials may serve as cosmetically acceptable carriers.   These may be in the form of silicone oils, synthetic esters and hydrocarbons. Amounts of the emollients may<br>
20   	  range anywhere from 0.1 to 95%, preferably between 1 and 50% by weight of the composition.<br>
Silicone oils may be divided into the volatile and non-volatile variety. The term "volatile" as used herein refers to those materials which have a measurable vapor pressure at ambient temperature. Volatile silicone oils are preferably chosen from cyclic <br>
25 	(cyclomethicone) or linear polydlmethylsiloxanes containing from 3 to 9, preferably from 4 to 5, silicon atoms.<br>
Non-volatile silicone oils useful as an emollient material include polyalkyl siloxanes, polyalkylaryl siloxanes and polyether siloxane copolymers. The essentially non-volatile polyalkyl siloxanes useful herein include, for example, polydimethyl siloxanes with<br>
30	 viscosities of from 5 x 10-6 to 0.1 m2/s at 25°C. Among the preferred non-volatile emollients useful in the present compositions are the polydimethyl siloxanes having viscosities from 1 x 10-5 to 4 x 10-4 m2/s at 25°C.<br><br>
WO 2005/079740<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/013959<br><br>
Another class of non-volatile silicones are emulsifying and non-emulsifying silicone elastomers. Representative of this category is dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer available as Dow Coming 9040, General Electric SFE 839, and Shin-Etsu KSG-18. Silicone waxes such as Silwax WS-L (dimethicone copolyol laurate) may also<br>
5    	 be useful.<br>
Among the ester emollients are:<br>
1) Alkyl esters of saturated fatty acids having 10 to 24 carbon atoms. Examples thereof include behenyl neopentanoate, isononyl isonanonoate, isopropyl myristate and octyl stearate.<br>
10     2)       Ether-esters such as fatty acid esters of ethoxylated saturated fatty alcohols.<br>
3)	Polyhydric alcohol esters. Ethylene glycol mono and di-fatty acid esters,<br>
diethylene glycol mono- and di-fatty acid esters, polyethylene glycol (200-6000)<br>
mono- and di-fatty acid esters, propylene glycol mono- and di-fatty acid esters,<br>
