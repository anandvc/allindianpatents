TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] This disclosure relates generally to conferencing<br>
systems and more specifically to an apparatus, method, and<br>
computer program for providing instant messages related to<br>
a conference call.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Audio and video conferencing systems are becoming<br>
more popular in the United States and around the world. In<br>
a conventional conferencing system, one participant<br>
communicates audio signals to other participants (often<br>
through a multipoint conferencing server or other unit) and<br>
receives audio signals from the other participants<br>
(indirectly through the server). The participants may also<br>
exchange video images allowing the participants to see one<br>
another.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0003] This disclosure provides an apparatus, method,<br>
and computer program for providing instant messages related<br>
to a conference call.<br>
[0004] In one aspect, a call conferencing apparatus,<br>
method, and computer program detect one or more events that<br>
are related to a conference call. The apparatus, method,<br>
and computer program then send one or more instant messages<br>
to one or more participants associated with the conference<br>
call .<br>
[0005] In a particular aspect, the one or more events<br>
could include a participant joining the conference call, a<br>
participant exiting the conference call, a participant<br>
failing to log into the conference call correctly, a<br>
participant transferring to another communication device<br>
during the conference call, a beginning of the conference<br>
call, and an end of the conference call.<br>
[0006] Other technical features may be readily apparent<br>
to one skilled in the art from the following figures,<br>
descriptions, and claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0007] For a more complete understanding of this<br>
disclosure and its advantages, reference is now made to the<br>
following description, taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
[OOO8] FIGURE 1 illustrates an example conferencing<br>
system according to one embodiment of this disclosure;<br>
[OOO9] FIGURE 2 illustrates an example media application<br>
server according to one embodiment of this disclosure; and<br>
[0010] FIGURE 3 illustrates an example method for<br>
providing instant messages related to a conference call<br>
according to one embodiment of this disclosure.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[OOll] FIGURE 1 illustrates an example communication<br>
system IOC according to one embodiment of this disclosure.<br>
The system 100 shown in FIGURE 1 is for illustration only.<br>
Other embodiments of the system 100 may be used without<br>
departing from the scope of this disclosure.<br>
;0012j A problem with conventional conferencing systems<br>
is that the participants often cannot easily determine when<br>
different events occur. For example, conventional<br>
conferencing systems simply produce an audible &gt;Nbeep" or<br>
other noise that alerts the other participants in a<br>
conference call that a new participant has joined. The<br>
other participants are then often forced to ask who joined<br>
the conference call. Similarly, conventional conferencing<br>
systems simply produce an audible beep when a participant<br>
leaves a conference call. To identify the participant who<br>
left, each remaining participant typically needs to say<br>
that he or she did not leave, and by process of elimination<br>
the participant who left is identified. This is typically<br>
inconvenient for the conference call participants.<br>
[0013] In the illustrated example, the system 100<br>
includes one or more communication devices 102a-102d, a<br>
network 104, and a media application server ("MAS") 106.<br>
[0014] The communication devices 102a-102d represent<br>
devices used by users or subscribers during communication<br>
sessions. Communication sessions represent data<br>
conversions or conversations between devices or<br>
applications ever a network. For example, each<br>
communication device 102a-102d represents an input/output<br>
cevice that could include a microphone and a speaker to<br>
capture and play audio information. A communication device<br>
I02a~102d could also include a camera and a display to<br>
capture and present video information. A communication<br>
device 102a~102d could further represent a portable<br>
computing device for sending and receiving text or other<br>
messages.<br>
[0015] During a communication session, one or more of<br>
the devices 102 communicate with the MAS 106 over the<br>
network 104. As an example, a communication device 102 may<br>
transmit audio information to the MAS 106 and receive audio<br>
information from the MAS 106. Each communication device<br>
102 may be constructed or configured from any suitable<br>
hardware, software, firmware, or combination thereof for<br>
transmitting or receiving audio, video, or other<br>
information.<br>
[0016] The system 100 shown in FIGURE 1 illustrates<br>
various embodiments of the communication devices 102. For<br>
example, the communication device 102a represents a<br>
wireless mobile station that communicates with the network<br>
104 through a mobile switching center ("MSC") 108. The<br>
communication device 102b represents a wired Internet<br>
Protocol ("IP") telephone that communicates directly with<br>
the network 104. An example of a suitable device is an<br>
12004 Internet Telephone, commercially available from<br>
Nortel Networks o-f Brampton, Ontario, Canada. The<br>
communication device 102c represents a personal computer,<br>
such as a desktop computer or a laptop computer. The<br>
communication device 102d represents a wireless device,<br>
such as a Blackberry or personal digital assistant. One or<br>
more of ':hese devices 102a-102d may include video<br>
functionality, such as when the communication device 102a<br>
includes a video camera or when the communication device<br>
102c is coupled to a web camera 110.<br>
 [0017] While this represents several embodiments of the<br>
communication devices 102, other or additional<br>
communication devices 102 may be utilized in the system 100<br>
of FIGURE 1. By way of illustration in FIGURE 1, each of<br>
the communication devices I02a-102d is different. It will<br>
be understood, however, that the communication devices 102<br>
in the system 100 may include or represent the same or<br>
similar type of device or other combination of<br>
communication devices.<br>
[0018] The network 104 is coupled to the communication<br>
devices 102, the MAS 106, and the mobile switching center<br>
108. In this document, the term "couple" refers to any<br>
direct or indirect communication between two or more<br>
components, whether or not those components are in physical<br>
contact with each other. The network 104 facilitates<br>
communication between components of the system 100. For<br>
example, the network 104 may communicate Internet Packets<br>
("IP"), frame relay frames, Asynchronous Transfer Mode<br>
("ATM") cells, Ethernet, X.25, frame relay, or other<br>
suitable information protocols between network addresses or<br>
devices. The network 104 may include one or more local<br>
area networks ("LANs"), metropolitan area networks<br>
("MANs"), wide area networks ("WANs"), all or portions of a<br>
global network such as the Internet, or any other<br>
communication system or systems at one or more locations.<br>
[0019] The media application server ("MAS") 106 is<br>
coupled to the network 104. The MAS 106 supports<br>
communication sessions between communication devices 102 in<br>
the system 100. For example, the MAS 106 may receive from<br>
one cr multiple communication devices 102 requests to<br>
establish 01 join a conference call. The MAS 106 may also<br>
transmit/receive audio or video information to/from each<br>
communication device 102 involved in the conference call.<br>
[0020] The MAS 106 may be constructed or configured<br>
using any hardware, software, firmware, or combination<br>
thereof fcr supporting communication sessions in the system<br>
100. As an example, the MAS 106 could include one or more<br>
processors 112 that execute instructions and one or more<br>
memories 114 that store instructions and data used by the<br>
processors 112. The processor(s) 112 is generally<br>
understood to be a device that drives a general-purpose<br>
computer. It is noted, however, that other processor devices<br>
such as microcontrollers, Field Programmable Gate Arrays<br>
(FPGAs), or Application Specific Integrated Circuits (ASICs)<br>
can be used as well and achieve the benefits and advantages<br>
described herein. An example MAS 106 is shown in FIGURE 2,<br>
which is described below and in co-pending U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial No. 10/610,511 entitled "DISTRIBUTED<br>
CALL SERVER SUPPORTING COMMUNICATION SESSIONS IN A<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM AND METHOD," filed on June 30, 2003,<br>
and which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
[0021] Communication session(s) established and managed<br>
by the MAS 106 can include additional communication devices<br>
other than the communication devices 102a-102d. For<br>
example, a communication device 102e is shown coupled to<br>
the network 104 through a public telephone network, such as<br>
a public switched telephone network ("PSTN") 116. The<br>
communication device 102e may include a conventional analog<br>
or digital telephone or some other type of communication<br>
device. Ir. embodiments where the PSTN 116 and the network<br>
104 use different or incompatible protocols to communicate,<br>
a gateway 118 may be used that is coupled to the network<br>
104 and the PSTN 116 to facilitate communication between<br>
the networks. The gateway 118 functions to translate<br>
between the different protocols used by the network 104 and<br>
the PSTN 116. Although one PSTN 116 is shown in FIGURE 1<br>
coupled to the network 104, other or additional types of<br>
public or private networks may be coupled to the network<br>
104.<br>
[C022] The communication devices 102 and tne MAS 106<br>
could support suitable standards or protocols used to set<br>
up, maintain, and terminate communication sessions between<br>
end users. As examples, the communication devices 102 and<br>
the MAS 106 could communicate audio, video, or other<br>
information using the Realtime Transfer Protocol ("RTF")<br>
over User Datagram Protocol ("UDP"), the International<br>
Telecommunication Union - Telecommunications ("ITU-T")<br>
H.263 standard (video CODEC), the G.711 and G.729 audio<br>
CODEC standards, and other or additional standards or<br>
protocols. Other CODECS, such as Moving Picture Experts<br>
Group-4 ("MPEG-4"), Digital Video Express ("DIVX"), and<br>
Windows Media Video ("WMV"), can be supported by the MAS<br>
106. In addition, signaling messages sent between the<br>
communication devices 102 and the MAS 106 may include or<br>
conform with the Session Initiation Protocol ("SIP"), which<br>
is an application layer protocol for the establishment,<br>
modification, and termination of conferencing and telephony<br>
sessions over IP-based networks. As will be appreciated,<br>
other or additional protocols and configurations may be<br>
used .<br>
[0023; In one aspect of operation, the MAS 106 includes<br>
one or more processes, such as software applications<br>
providing an activity, a function, or a systematic sequence<br>
of operations that produces a specified result, for<br>
handling conference calls. In this document, the phrase<br>
"conference call" refers to a communication session<br>
involving more than two participants.<br>
[0024] During a conference call, the MAS 106 generates<br>
and communicates one or more instant messages to various<br>
participants who use or have access to one or more<br>
communication devices 102. In this document, the phrase<br>
"instant message" refers to a message that is transmitted<br>
from a source to a destination for presentation at the<br>
destination at the time it is received by the destination.<br>
The instant messages sent to a participant in a conference<br>
call may be received and presented through one or more<br>
communication devices 102 associated with the participant.<br>
For example, the contents of an instant message could be<br>
presented to a participant by displaying the contents on a<br>
display screen of a communication device 102 or by playing<br>
an audio version of the contents through a speaker of the<br>
communication device 102.<br>
[0025] The instant messages sent to one or more<br>
participants in a conference call could contain any<br>
information related to the conference call. For example, a<br>
conference call is typically associated with a chairperson<br>
responsible for managing the conference call. The<br>
chairperson may or may not be the first participant to<br>
initiate or join a conference call. When the chairperson<br>
joins the conference call, the MAS 106 may communicate an<br>
instant message to the chairperson identifying the number<br>
of participants who have already joined the conference<br>
call. The instant message could also identify the names of<br>
the participants who have already joined the conference<br>
call. In addition, some of the participants who joined a<br>
conference call could also leave the conference call before<br>
the chairperson joins the call. The instant message sent<br>
to the chairperson could identify the number or names of<br>
the participants who have joined and left the conference<br>
call before the chairperson joined.<br>
[0026] As another example, when a new participant joins<br>
an existing conference call, an instant message identifying<br>
the new participant could be sent to one or more of the<br>
other participants already participating in the call.<br>
Similarly, when a participant leaves a conference call, an<br>
instant message identifying the exiting participant could<br>
be sent to one or more of the participants still<br>
participating in the call. In this way, one, some, or all<br>
of the participants in a conference call can easily<br>
identify who joins or leaves a conference call. As<br>
particular examples, the instant message identifying a new<br>
participant: or an ex-iting participant could be sent only to<br>
the chairperson or to all other participants.<br>
[0027] AS yet another example, before a conference call<br>
begins, tne MAS 106 may be informed who will be<br>
participating in the conference call. The chairperson or<br>
any other person could identify the participants who will<br>
participate in the call. When the conference call actually<br>
starts, such as when the chairperson joins the call, the<br>
MAS 106 could send to all of the identified participants an<br>
instant message indicating that the conference call has<br>
begun. Similarly, when the conference call ends, the MAS<br>
106 could send to the chairperson or to all of the<br>
identified participants an instant message indicating that<br>
the conference call has ended.<br>
[0028] As still other examples, in some embodiments, a<br>
conference call may end automatically when a specified<br>
amount of time elapses after the chairperson leaves the<br>
conference call. In these embodiments, when the<br>
chairperson leaves the • conference call, the MAS 106 sends<br>
an instant message to the other participants indicating<br>
that the conference call is ending soon. Also, in some<br>
embodiments, a participant may attempt to join a conference<br>
call but fail to provide the proper access code. In these<br>
embodiments, when a participant provides an improper access<br>
code, the MAS 106 sends an instant message to the<br>
chairperson identifying the participant, the correct access<br>
code, and the incorrect access provided by the participant.<br>
The chairperson may then take any suitable action, such as<br>
sending an instant message to the participant identifying<br>
the correct access code. Further, in some embodiments, a<br>
participant in a conference call may transfer the call from<br>
one of the participant's communication devices 102 to<br>
another communication device 102. When this occurs, the<br>
MAS 106 sends an instant message to the chairperson<br>
indicating that the participant has transferred devices<br>
102. In addition, in some embodiments, when the conference<br>
call ends, the MAS 106 sends to the participants an instant<br>
message containing a survey, such as a survey with predefined<br>
survey questions. The participants may respond<br>
with instant messages containing answers to the survey<br>
questions, and the MAS 106 tabulates the answers and sends<br>
an instant message with the survey results to the<br>
chairperson.<br>
[0029] This has described several examples of the<br>
instant messages that may be communicated to one or more<br>
participants before, during, or after a conference call.<br>
Instant messages containing other or additional contents<br>
could be sent at any suitable time to any or all of the<br>
participants without departing from the scope of this<br>
disclosure.<br>
 [0030] In some embodiments, an instant message for a<br>
particular participant is sent to a specific communication<br>
device 102 associated with that participant. In other<br>
embodiments, an instant message for a particular<br>
participant is sent to some or all communication devices<br>
102 associated with that participant.<br>
[0031] In particular embodiments, such as when the SIP<br>
protocol is used in the system 100, a communication device<br>
102 registers with the MAS 106 and is associated with a<br>
participant. When an instant message is generated for a<br>
participant, the instant message is sent to all registered<br>
communication devices 102 for that participant. By<br>
communicating the instant message to all registered<br>
communication devices 102 for a participant, the<br>
participant may be more likely to receive the instant<br>
message on at least one device.<br>
[0032] Although FIGURE 1 illustrates one example of a<br>
communication system 100, various changes may be made to<br>
FIGURE 1. For example, varying jcommunication devices 102,<br>
networks 104, and servers 106 could be used in the system<br>
100. Also, the functionality of MAS 106, described above<br>
as being implemented on a server, could be implemented on<br>
any other computing device, such as a desktop computer or a<br>
laptop computer. In addition, FIGURE 1 illustrates one<br>
operational environment in which the various features of<br>
the MAS 106 may be used. These features could be<br>
implemented in any other suitable operating environment.<br>
[0033] FIGURE 2 illustrates an example media application<br>
server 106 according to one embodiment of this disclosure.<br>
The MAS 106 illustrated in FIGURE 2 is for illustration<br>
Dnlv. Other embodiments of the MAS 106 could be used<br>
without departing from the scope of this disclosure. Also,<br>
while FIGURE 2 illustrates the MAS 106 operating in the<br>
system 100 of FIGURE 1, the MAS 106 may operate in other<br>
suitable systems.<br>
[0024] In the illustrated example, the MAS 106 includes<br>
a media conductor 202, a media controller 204, two media<br>
processors ("MPs") 206a-206b, and a content store 208.<br>
[0035] The media conductor 202 processes signaling<br>
messages received by the MAS 106. In some embodiments, the<br>
communication devices 102 communicate the signaling<br>
messages directly (or via a gateway, which serves as an<br>
entrance/exit into a communications network) to the MAS<br>
106. In other embodiments, the communication devices 102<br>
communicate signaling messages indirectly to the MAS 106,<br>
such as when a Session Initiation Protocol ("SIP")<br>
application server 210 (that received a request from a<br>
communication device 102) sends the signaling messages to<br>
the media conductor 202 on behalf of the communication<br>
device 102. The communication devices 102 may communicate<br>
directly with the SIP application server 210 or indirectly<br>
through a gateway, such as gateway 118. The media<br>
conductor 202 processes the signaling messages and<br>
communicates the processed messages to the media controller<br>
204. As particular examples, the media conductor 202 may<br>
implement SIP call control, parameter encoding, and media<br>
event package functionality.<br>
[0036] The media controller 204 manages the operation of<br>
the MAS 106 to provide services to the communication<br>
devices 102. For example, the media controller 204 may<br>
receive processed SIP requests from the media conductor<br>
202, where the requests involve conference or other calls.<br>
The controller 204 may 'then select the media processor 206<br>
to handle each of the calls, support audio/video capability<br>
negotiations, enforce licenses controlling how the MAS 106<br>
can be used, and control negotiations based on the<br>
licenses. The negotiations could include identifying the<br>
CODEC or CODECs to be used to encode and decode audio or<br>
video information during a call.<br>
[0037] The media processors 206a-206b handle the<br>
exchange of audio or video information between<br>
communication devices 102 involved in a conference or other<br>
call. For example, a media processor 206 could receive<br>
audio and video information from one communication device<br>
102 involved in a call, process the information as needed,<br>
and forward the information to at least one other<br>
communication device 102 involved in the call. The audio<br>
and video information may be received through one or more<br>
ports 212, which couple the media processors 206 to the<br>
network 104. The ports 212 may represent any suitable<br>
structure operable to facilitate communication between the<br>
MAS 106 and the network 104. In some embodiments, each of<br>
the media processors 206 represents a software application<br>
for specific media processing, such as interactive voice<br>
response ("IVR") media or conference media, which is<br>
executed on the MAS 106 hardware platform via the operating<br>
system.<br>
[0038] In this example embodiment, each media processor<br>
206 provides different functionality in the MAS 106. For<br>
example, ir. some embodiments, the media processor 206a<br>
provides IVR functionality in the MAS 106. As particular<br>
examples, tne media processor 206a supports a voice mail<br>
function that can record and play messages or an autoattendant<br>
function that provides a menu and directs callers<br>
to particular destinations based on their selections. The<br>
media processor 206b provides conferencing functionality in<br>
the MAS 106, such as by facilitating the exchange of audio<br>
and video information between communication devices 102.<br>
[0039] The content store 208 provides access to content<br>
used by the various components of the system 100. For<br>
example, in some embodiments, the content store 208<br>
provides access to stored voice mail messages and access<br>
codes used to initiate or join conference calls. The<br>
content store 208 also provides access to any other or<br>
additional information. In other embodiments, the content<br>
store 208 is replaced by a conventional database or other<br>
data storage facility.<br>
[0040] A Java 2 Enterprise Edition TJ2EE") platform 214<br>
is coupled to the MAS 106. The J2EE platform 214 allows<br>
the MAS 106 to retrieve information used to provide<br>
subscriber services in the system 100. For example, the<br>
J2EE platform 214 may provide audio announcements used by<br>
the IVR media processor 206a. The J2EE platform 214<br>
represents one possible apparatus used to provide audio or<br>
other information to the MAS 106. Any other or additional<br>
device or apparatus may be used to provide the information<br>
to the MAS 106.<br>
[0041] In a particular embodiment, various components of<br>
the MAS 106 represent software processes executed by the<br>
processor 112 of the MAS 106. While the components 202-208<br>
have been described as being executed by a MAS 106, the<br>
software processes could be executed by other computing<br>
devices such as a desktop computer. In other embodiments,<br>
the various components of the MAS 106 may be implemented in<br>
other ways, such as in hardware.<br>
[0042] In the illustrated example, the conference media<br>
processor 206b implements the conferencing functionality<br>
described above. For example, the media conductor 202<br>
receives signaling messages indicating that two or more<br>
communication devices 102 wish to engage in a conference<br>
call. The controller 204 receives the requests and causes<br>
the conference media processor 206b to establish the<br>
conference call. The conference media processor 206b then<br>
receives audio or video information from each communication<br>
device 102 and forwards the information to the other<br>
communication devices 102.<br>
[0043] During a conference call, the MAS 106 generates<br>
and communicates one or more instant messages to one or<br>
more of the participants. In a particular embodiment, the<br>
media controller 204 generates the instant messages. The<br>
instant messages are then converted into SI? format by the<br>
media conductor 202, which communicates the instant<br>
messages to one or more communication devices 102. The<br>
instant messages may be sent directly to the communication<br>
devices 102 by the media conductor 202 or indirectly<br>
through the SIP application server 210.<br>
[0044] Although FIGURE 2 illustrates one example of a<br>
media application server 106, various changes may be made<br>
to FIGURE 2. For example, any number of media processors<br>
206 could be used in the MAS 106. Also, the functional<br>
divisions shown in FIGURE 2 are for illustration only.<br>
Various components can be combined or omitted or additional<br>
components can be added according to particular functional<br>
designations or needs. In addition, while the components<br>
202-208 have been described as being executed by a server,<br>
the components 202-208 may be executed by other hardware<br>
platforms, such as a desktop computer or a laptop computer. [0045] FIGURE 3 illustrates an example method 300 for<br>
providing instant messages related to a conference call<br>
according to one embodiment of this disclosure. For ease<br>
of explanation, the method 300 is described with respect to<br>
the MAS 106 of FIGURE 2 operating in the system 100 of<br>
FIGURE 1. The method 300 may also be used by other suitable<br>
devices or in any other suitable system.<br>
[0046] The MAS 106 detects a participant joining or<br>
initiating a conference call at step 302. This may<br>
include, for example, the media conductor 202 receiving one<br>
or more signaling messages, such as SIP messages, from a<br>
communication device 102. This may also include the media<br>
controller 204 determining that the signaling messages<br>
indicate a conference call is desired.<br>
[0047] The MAS 106 determines whether the participant<br>
joining or initiating the conference call is the<br>
chairperson of the call at step 304. This may include, for<br>
example, the MAS 106 determining whether, based on<br>
registration information provided by the participant's<br>
communication device 102, the participant is the<br>
chairperson of the conference call. The chairperson may be<br>
identified based on any suitable criteria. For example,<br>
the participant may enter a code identifying the<br>
participant as the chairperson. A participant could also<br>
be identified ahead of time as the chairperson of a<br>
conference call.<br>
[0048] If the participant is the chairperson, the MAS<br>
106 sends the chairperson an instant message identifying<br>
the number and names of any other participants who have<br>
already joined the conference call at step 306. This may<br>
include, foi example, the media controller 204 generating<br>
the instant message and the media conductor 202 converting<br>
the instant message into SIP format. As part of the<br>
instant message, the MAS 106 may or may not identify the<br>
names and number of participants who joined and then exited<br>
the conference call. In various embodiments, the instant<br>
message could identify only the number of participants who<br>
have joined, on^y the names of participants who have<br>
joined, cr both. Other information could also be included,<br>
such as the telephone number or location of each<br>
participant. The number and names may or may not include<br>
the chairperson. By sending this instant message, the<br>
chairperson can easily identify the status of the<br>
conference (such as who is there and whether everybody has<br>
joined) without needing to ask each participant to identify<br>
himself or herself.<br>
[0049] The MAS 106 also sends an instant message to all<br>
participants who should be involved in the conference call<br>
indicating chat the conference call has started at step<br>
308. This may include, for example, the MAS 106 sending an<br>
instant message to each participant in a list of<br>
participants for the conference call. This may or may not<br>
include the MAS 106 sending the instant message to the<br>
chairperson. In this example, the MAS 106 determines that<br>
the conference call has "begun" when the chairperson joins<br>
the call. In other embodiments, other or additional<br>
criteria could be used to determine when a conference call<br>
officially begins, such as when a specified number of<br>
participants have joined.<br>
[00501 Whether or not the new participant is the<br>
chairperson, the MAS 106 sends an instant message<br>
identifying the new participant to one or more other<br>
participants at step 310. This may include, for example,<br>
the MAS 1C6 sending an 'instant message identifying the new<br>
participant to the chairperson only (if the new participant<br>
is not the chairperson) or to all other participants who<br>
nave already joined the conference call. In this way, at<br>
least one of the participants already in the conference<br>
call can easily identify the new participant.<br>
[0051] At some point during the conference call, the MAS<br>
106 detects a participant leaving the conference call at<br>
step 312. This may include, for example, the media<br>
conductor 202 detecting a signaling message from a<br>
communication device 102 terminating a link to the MAS 106.<br>
When the MAS 106 detects this event, the MAS 106 sends an<br>
instant message to one or more of the other participants<br>
identifying the participant who left at step 314. This may<br>
include, for example, the MAS 106 sending an instant<br>
message identifying the exiting participant to the<br>
chairperson only or to all other participants who are still<br>
in the conference call. In this way, at least one of the<br>
participants in the conference call can easily identify the<br>
participant who left.<br>
[0052] Eventually, the MAS 106 detects an end to the<br>
conference call at step 316. This may include, for<br>
example, the MAS 106 determining that the chairperson or<br>
all participants have exited the conference call. The MAS<br>
106 then sends an instant message to one or more of the<br>
participants indicating that the conference call has ended<br>
at step 318 , This may include, for example, the MAS 106<br>
sending an instant message to the chairperson only, to all<br>
participants who joined the conference call, or to all<br>
participant5 who were expected to participate in the<br>
 [0053] Although FIGURE 3 illustrates one example of a<br>
method 300 for providing instant messages related to a<br>
conference call, various changes may be made to FIGURE 3.<br>
For example, FIGURE 3 illustrates the MAS 106 generating<br>
instant messages in response to detecting five different<br>
events (chairperson joins, conference begins, another<br>
participant joins, participant leaves, conference ends).<br>
The MAS 1C 6 could send instant messages when other or<br>
additional events are detected (conference ending soon,<br>
participant provided incorrect pass code, etc.). Also,<br>
while steps 306-310, 314, 318 show a single instant message<br>
being sent oy the MAS 106, the MAS 106 could send multiple<br>
instant messages containing the described content during<br>
each step. Further, the order of events shown in FIGURE 3<br>
is for illustration only. The MAS 106 could detect the<br>
events in a different order, such as when a participant<br>
leaves the conference call before the chairperson joins.<br>
Moreover, an instant message could be sent to one, some, or<br>
all of the communication devices 102 associated with a<br>
participant who should receive the message. In addition,<br>
the MAS 106 may "send" an instant message in different ways<br>
depending on the communication device 102 that will receive<br>
the message. As a particular example, a text message could<br>
be sent to communication devices 102 having a display,<br>
while an audio version of the text could be sent to<br>
communication devices 102 that lack a display.<br>
