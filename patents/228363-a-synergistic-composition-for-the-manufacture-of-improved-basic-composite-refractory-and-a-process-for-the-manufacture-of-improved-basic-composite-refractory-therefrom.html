				<td>The present invention relates to a synergistic composition for the<br>
manufacture of improved basic composite refractory and a process for the<br>
manufacture of improved basic composite refractory therefrom.<br>
The present invention particularly relates to a synergistic composition and a<br>
process for the manufacture of basic composite refractory brick / block with<br>
improved thermal shock resistance and hot strength from the novel<br>
synergistic composition consisting of reactive preformed magnesium<br>
aluminate spinel in basic sintered magnesite refractory composition.<br>
Basic composite refractory in the shape of bricks / blocks are used as<br>
refractory lining in converters and ladles of iron and steel industries, rotary<br>
kilns of cement manufacturing units, checker work of regenerators of glass<br>
tank furnaces.<br>
Production of iron and steel is governed by the quality of refractory and so<br>
iron and steel manufacturers are in continuous search for improved quality<br>
refractory lining . Basic process of steel making has enhanced the use of<br>
basic refractories and increased the scope of further improvement in quality<br>
for basic refractories. This has emphasized extensive work on magnesite<br>
refractories, the only basic refractory available.<br>
Excellent resistance against basic slag as well as low vulnerability to attack<br>
by iron oxide and alkalis has made magnesite bodies an essential refractory<br>
lining material for electric arc furnaces, basic oxygen furnaces, glass tank<br>
checkers and flow control devices for continuous casting of steel. But these<br>
refractories are not suitable for applications requiring severe thermal<br>
fluctuations due to its poor resistance against thermal shock. High thermal<br>
expansion and brittle bonding phase (mainly silicate) in conventional<br>
magnesite refractories are main drawbacks. Hence the development of basic<br>
refractory with better bonding and thermal shock resistance is a time demand<br>
requirement.<br>
Using of fine reactive alumina to form magnesium aluminate spinel is a<br>
development on these refractories. Spinel has very high thermal shock<br>
resistance and corrosion resistance and improves the drawbacks of<br>
magnesite refractories. But the addition of fine alumina in magnesite body<br>
causes spinel formation, which is associated with 5% volume expansion as<br>
referred by E. Rayshkeistch, "Oxide Ceramics", page 257-74, Academic<br>
Press, New York, 1960, which can cause cracking of the matrix phase and<br>
deteriorate the final properties.<br>
Reference may be made to G. R. Eusner and D. H. Hubble, "Technology of<br>
spinel bonded periclase brick", Journal of the American Ceramic Society,<br>
Vol 43, No. 6 page 292-6 (1960), wherein the use of 8-10 wt% fine alumina<br>
in magnesite brick is described.<br>
Another reference can be made to S. C. Cooper and T. A. Hudson,<br>
"Magnesia-magnesium aluminate spinel as a refractory", Transactions and<br>
Journal of the British Ceramic Society, 81, p 121-8 (1982), wherein is<br>
described a process of making magnesia-magnesium aluminate spinel<br>
refractory co-clinker and further use of the co-clinker for brick development.<br>
Still another reference may be made to Aksel and others, "Investigation of<br>
thermal shock resistance in model magnesia spinel refractory material", IV<br>
Ceramic Congress Proceedings book - 1999, page 193-9, Elsevier Science,<br>
Tokyo; wherein it is described that extent of interlinking of the thermal<br>
expansion mismatch (between spinel and magnesia) microcracking is due to<br>
addition of spinel and this finally imparts resistance against crack initiation<br>
and propagation.<br>
Yet another reference may be made to Videtto of Kaiser aluminium<br>
corporation, US Patent No. 4126479, wherein the development of spinel<br>
bonded magnesite brick was claimed without any undue expansion using 4 -<br>
15% alumina fines. The product consists of 60 to 80 percent refractory<br>
aggregate coarser than 44 micron size and 40 to 20 percent of material finer<br>
than 44 micron made of 15 to 25 percent fine magnesia and 4 to 15 percent<br>
fine alumina (size less than 5 micron). The said composition was heated to at<br>
least at 1400°C.<br>
A further reference may be made to Nazirizadeh and Naefae of Didier<br>
Werke AG, in US Patent No. 4729934, wherein it has been claimed that<br>
refractory shapes, consisting essentially of 82 to 90 weight percent MgO and<br>
18 to 10 weight percent A\2Oit were fired in the temperature range of 1450°C<br>
to 1600°C. The refractory shapes were reported to show refractoriness under<br>
load of more than 1740°C and shrinkage of 3 to 5% at 1400°C after 24 hrs<br>
under a compressive load of 0.2 N/mm2. The said product was suggested for<br>
cement rotary kiln applications.<br>
The main drawbacks of the hitherto known prior art are:<br>
1. Presence of brittle bond between magnesia grains and high thermal<br>
expansion of the conventional magnesite refractory resulted in very<br>
poor resistance against thermal fluctuations.<br>
2. Use of fine alumina in matrix phase to form spinel in situ during firing<br>
causes cracking due to spinel formation and deteriorates mechanical<br>
characteristics.<br>
3. Making of magnesia-spinel co-clinker requires high temperature<br>
firing. Hence use of such co-clinker for brick making is costlier.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a synergistic<br>
composition for the manufacture of improved basic composite refractory,<br>
which obviates the drawbacks as mentioned above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a synergistic<br>
composition consisting synthetic reactive preformed magnesium aluminate<br>
spinel powder.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
manufacture of improved basic composite refractory from the novel<br>
synergistic composition of the present invention, which obviates the<br>
drawbacks as mentioned above.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to significantly improve the<br>
thermal shock resistance and hot strength of the basic composite refractory<br>
without affecting the other properties.<br>
From hitherto known prior art details it is ascertained that conventional basic<br>
composite refractory bricks / blocks have poor thermal shock resistance due<br>
to the brittle bond present as silicates. Improvement of bond character by<br>
using purer grade raw material and using alumina fines to produce spinel<br>
bond can improve spalling characteristics as well as the high temperature<br>
properties, but formation of spinel phase by reaction between added alumina<br>
fines and fine magnesia of basic refractory causes expansion during reaction<br>
and subsequent cracking of the refractory produced, thus deteriorating the<br>
refractory qualities.<br>
In the present invention there is provided a novel synergistic composition<br>
consisting of synthetic reactive preformed magnesium aluminate spinel in<br>
basic magnesite refractory composition and a process for the manufacture of<br>
basic composite refractory with improved thermal shock resistance and hot strength. This is achieved by the inventive step of incorporating a reactive preformed spinel in basic magnesite refractory composition (purity of magnesia &gt;98%) and selecting a composition of spinel and magnesia that leads to an improved basic composite refractory.<br>
The reactive preformed spinel does not react further during firing and rules out any chance of expansion and associated crack formation. Further, during firing the spinel makes diffusion bonding with magnesite (not brittle like glassy bonding as in the case of conventional magnesite refractories), which results in improved thermal shock resistance and hot strength in the basic brick so produced.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a synergistic composition for the manufacture of improved basic composite refractory, which comprises sintered magnesia in the range of 60 - 95 wt% and milled synthetic reactive preformed magnesium aluminate spinel in the range of 5-40 wt%.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the particle size distribution of the composition is within the range of 5 No. BS (British standard) to 10 No. BS: 30 wt%., within the range of 10 No. BS to 30 No. BS: 20 wt%, within the range of 30 No. BS to 60 No. BS: 5 wt%, within the range of 60 No. to 150 No. BS: 15 wt% and particle size less than 150 No. BS: 30 wt%. In another embodiment of the present invention the particle size distribution of the 60 95 wt% sintered magnesia is within the range of 5 No. BS to 10 No. BS: 30 wt%., within the range of 10 No. BS to 30 No. BS: 20 wt%, within the range of 30 No. BS to 60 No BS: 5 wt%, within the range of 60 No. to 150 No. BS: 5 to 15 wt% and particle size less than 150 No. BS: 0 to 30 wt%.<br><br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the particle size distribution<br>
of the 60 - 95 wt% sintered magnesia is such as 5 # BS to 10 # BS: 30 wt%.,<br>
10 # BS to 30 # BS: 20 wt%, 30 # BS to 60 # BS: 5 wt%, 60 # to 150 # BS:<br>
5 to 15 wt% and less than 150 # BS: 0 to 30 wt%.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention the sintered magnesia<br>
used is such as sea water magnesia, dead burnt magnesia of purity above<br>
98%.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the synthetic reactive<br>
preformed magnesium aluminate spinel consists of MgO in the range of<br>
20 to 40 wt% and A12O3 in the range of 60 to 80 wt%.<br>
The novel composition of the present invention, for the manufacture of<br>
improved basic composite refractory, is not a mere admixture but a<br>
synergistic mixture having properties which are distinct and different from<br>
the mere aggregation of the properties of the individual ingredients. Further,<br>
there is no chemical reaction in the said novel synergistic composition.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for the manufacture of<br>
improved basic composite refractory from the synergistic composition of the<br>
present invention, which comprises mixing sintered magnesia in the range of<br>
60 - 95 wt% and milled synthetic reactive preformed magnesium aluminate<br>
spinel in the range of 5 - 40 wt% to obtain a homogenous mixture of the<br>
synergistic composition, adding to the said mixture 4 to 8 wt% green binder<br>
and mixing thoroughly, pressing the resultant mixture under an uniaxial<br>
pressure in the range of 600 to 1500 kg/cm2 to obtain pressed shapes, drying<br>
the pressed shapes at a temperature in the range of 110 ± 10°C for a period<br>
of 16 to 24 hours and firing the dried pressed shapes at a temperature in<br>
range of 1450°C to 1650°C for a period in the range of 2 to 8 hours, allowing<br>
the fired shapes to cool naturally.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention the synthetic reactive preformed<br>
magnesium aluminate spinel consisting of MgO in the range of 20 to 40 wt%<br>
and A12O3 in the range of 60 to 80 wt% is preformed by calcination at a<br>
temperature in the range of 1200°C to 1500°C for a soaking period in the<br>
range of 2 to 6 hours.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the synthetic reactive<br>
magnesium aluminate spinel is made using magnesia sources such as sea<br>
water magnesium hydroxide, commercial magnesium hydroxide.<br>
In still another embodiment of the present invention the synthetic reactive<br>
magnesium aluminate spinel is made using alumina sources such as<br>
commercial grade hydrated alumina, aluminium hydroxide.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention milled synthetic<br>
preformed reactive magnesium aluminate spinel is obtained by milling in a<br>
conventional mill such as attrition mill, ball mill, vibro mill, for a period in<br>
the range of 2 to 6 hours, in the presence of liquid such as isopropyl alcohol,<br>
acetone, hexane.<br>
In a further embodiment of the present invention the green binder used for<br>
pressing is such as polyvinyl alcohol, dextrin, glycol.<br>
The steps of the process of the present invention comprises:<br>
1. Mixing magnesium hydroxide and hydrated alumina in a pot mill for<br>
30 to 60 minutes to obtain a composition with MgO in the range of 20<br>
to 40 wt % and A12O3 in the range of 60 to 80 wt%.<br>
2. Calcining the mixture obtained in step-1 , at a temperature in the range<br>
of 1200°C to 1500°C with a soaking period in the range of 2 to 6<br>
hours to form synthetic reactive preformed magnesium aluminate<br>
spinel.<br>
3. Milling the preformed spinel in a liquid for a time period in the range<br>
of 2 to 6 hours to obtain milled synthetic reactive preformed<br>
magnesium aluminate spinel<br>
4. Preparing a homogenous mixture of the synergistic composition<br>
comprising: sintered magnesia in the range of 60 - 95 wt% and milled<br>
synthetic reactive preformed magnesium aluminate spinel in the range<br>
5. Adding 4 to 8 wt% green binder to the mixture obtained in step-4, and<br>
mixing thoroughly, pressing the resultant mixture under an uniaxial<br>
pressure in the range of 600 to 1500 kg/cm2 to obtain pressed shapes.<br>
6. Drying the pressed shapes at a temperature in the range of 1 10 ± 10°C<br>
for a period of 16 to 24 hours<br>
4. Firing the dried products at a temperature in the range of 1450°C to<br>
1650°C with a soaking period in the range of 2 to 8 hours.<br>
5. Allowing the fired products to cool naturally to obtain improved basic<br>
composite refractory.<br>
The specific inventive step in the present invention is the incorporation of<br>
preformed magnesium aluminate spinel to obtain a synergistic composition<br>
consisting of sintered magnesia and milled synthetic reactive preformed<br>
magnesium aluminate spinel. This synergistic composition is used for the<br>
manufacture of improved basic composite refractory. This step of<br>
preformation of spinel rather than producing spinel by reaction of individual<br>
ingredients like magnesia and alumina at high temperature during the<br>
refractory manufacturing process eliminates the formation of cracks and<br>
deterioration of other properties of the refractory. In general practice of<br>
magnesia - spinel refractory manufacturing a holding time at the<br>
spinellisation temperature is required to smoothen the spinel formation<br>
reaction and to reduce the chances of cracking. In the present invention such<br>
holding period is eliminated and this makes the firing schedule easier and<br>
economical. Thus there is provided a synergistic composition consisting of<br>
preformed spinel and sintered magnesia which is processed to manufacture<br>
improved magnesia spinel refractory in the shape of bricks / blocks.<br>
The invention is described with the help of the following examples for<br>
illustration of the novel synergistic composition and the process for the<br>
manufacture of improved basic composite refractory. However, the<br>
examples should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
The sintered magnesia spinel composite basic brick / blocks prepared as<br>
described in the following examples were characterized by determining:<br>
1. Bulk density (BD), apparent porosity (AP) and volumetric shrinkage<br>
(VS).<br>
2. Reversible thermal expansion (RTE).3.	Hot strength (HMOR) at a temperatures of 1000°C, 1200°C and 1400°C.<br>
4.	Retainment of cold strength (R-CMOR) after different number of thermal cycles, each thermal cycle comprises of 10 mins of heat at 1000°C and 10 mins of air quenching.<br>

4. Reversible thermal expansion (RTE): 1.51 to 1.97 %.<br>
5. Hot strength (HMOR): 245 to 472 Kg/cm2.<br>
6. Retainment of cold strength (R-CMOR): 392 to 550 Kg/cm2.<br>
From the above it is clearly seen that the synergistic composition of the<br>
present invention for the manufacture of improved • basic composite<br>
refractory bricks provides a retained cold strength, after 5 cycles of thermal<br>
shock at 1000°C, of the order of 550 kg/cm2. This is a distinct improvement<br>
in the retained cold strength of 256 kg/cm2 of only magnesite composition.<br>
Further, the hot strength at 1400°C of more than 400 kg/cm2 is obtained as<br>
against less than 150 kg/cm2 for magnesite bodies.<br>
The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
(i) Improved thermal shock resistance of the order of 550<br>
Kg/cm2, as against 256 Kg/cm2 in the case of conventional<br>
magnesite composition,<br>
(ii) Improved hot strength of more than 450 Kg/cm2, as against<br>
150 Kg/cm2 in the case of conventional magnesite<br>
composition.<br>
(iii) Low reversible thermal expansion,<br>
(iv) Increased densification.<br>
(v) Firing schedule easier and economical.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
