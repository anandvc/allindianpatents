				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td> <br><br>
This invention relates to a mechanical device for piston engines, such that there develops larger power rotations, when compared to that of crankshaft engines, that are presently popular.<br>
In the known art, the crank shaft is having its power generating spark and fuel expansions at 2 degrees to 8 degrees {please see Figure No (a)}. That is when sine 2 to sine 8, at which the power generating leverages factors is at extremely low levels. These inefficient domains, are common with all crank shaft engines, and major part of the energy contents in the molecular fuels, are wasted as radiator heat and exhaust gas temperature heat. When the crankshaft reaches 45 degrees, the major part of the expansions have already taken place, as shown with fig. 3(b).<br>
The object of this invention, is to device a device, for obviating the above said defects and to give piston engines , greatly improved mechanical and consequent fuel efficiencies. Thus if it is possible to conceive engines that work in the 45 degrees to 135 degrees, then there- by we can have the improved mechanical leverage functions. Thus we can have over all, greatly improved fuel efficiencies that can be made effective.<br>
Disclosure of the invention in the following lines.<br>
This invention relates to a device for generating automotive power with specially fabricated engine, which runs with ordinary fuel like petrol, diesel oil etc.<br>
To propose a device and then present concepts for engine, that has certain power gaining mechanical advantages and scientific capabilities.<br>
The prior art with petrol or diesel engines is around 100 years old principle, for which many innovations with carburetor etc. are there.<br>
Still, the very old crankshaft principle, is there with all engine concepts and their performances. Improvements in the prior art can have clarity, when the old methods, having certain limitations are understood properiy or even decoded.<br>
The crank-shaft mechanism, has its firing instant, occurring at 2 degrees to 3 degrees shift, to the " vertical ", so as to give rotating " moment ", that is for circular motion. At that instant, for engine, the Sine 3 " Value is 0.0 523. That is 5.23 percent of the ignition force is having the conversion factor, and the remaining 94.77 percent is transforming in to radiator heat. This reduction factor improves as the angle value improves and when reaches 90 degrees, the efficiency factor is 1 or 100 percent. Thus for every piston stroke, the net efficiency is the average between 3 degrees efficiency and the 90 degrees efficiency. This crankshaft angle factor {see Fig 3 (a) and (b) }is the<br><br>
main limitation, especially when the power is at the maximum, that is at the firing instance.<br>
Improvements made in the prior art can be visualised in the following ways.<br>
Since the important limitation is with the mechanism of the crankshaft. The figures in the drawings left with this complete specification, (especially fig. 1), schematically illustrate, by the way of example, which is an embodiment of the device according to this invention.<br>
Four Pistons Structural Details<br>
All conventional four-cylinder piston engines, have four strokes for each cycle and then re-cycles from the 5-th to the 8-th on wards. Further the piston rod and crankshaft rod are the same. Fig 1 shows the schematic details with one piston. When there are four pistons connecting one central crankshaft, the piston crankshaft details are shown with Fig 2. Also when there are four pistons, the details are four times repeated performances, as that of one piston, with a phase change in rotation angle of 180 degrees, from the previous. Hence for simplicity for drawings, only one-piston details are shown in Fig 1.<br>
For each stroke, the crank shaft angular change is 0 to 180 degrees, which is the firing expansion power generating stroke, 180 to 360 degrees is the exhaust of burned fuel, 360 to 540 degrees is the fuel mixture absorption and 540 to 720 degrees is the fuel mixture compression stroke. Thus the four strokes are effected in two rounds, where 360 degrees circular motion is one round and 2 x 360 = 720 degrees is the four strokes circular motion.<br>
In the new device, the operation of the piston rod and crankshaft rod are separated with one each rod for piston and crankshaft. In these ways, in the new device, the piston moves with its piston rod up and down( please see Fig.1 and letters El and E2 ). While the crankshaft have its up and down motion, combined with circular motion ( please see Fig.1 and letters S1, T4, R and angles 90, 135, 275, 315 etc ). In these ways the two separated, but correlated motions, we have improved "firing angle start" for piston. Thus we eliminate the in efficient firing domain, 3 degrees to 45 degrees in the present engine device. Consequence is the large power saving, which other wise has its effect through major engine hear loss.<br>
Improvements With This Invention.<br>
With Fig.1 there are two ways of bifurcation of piston rod and crankshaft rod, compared to with the existing engines, as a combined single piston crank shaft rod. In<br><br>
the two ways of this patent design, one is the piston rod coupling to crank shaft at E1 to E2. This is the power generating part of the crankshaft, through cylinder PI to P2. Second is the circular motion affecting part of the crankshaft. With these changes in crankshaft, the power generating part of the piston stroke move up and down in the angular range 45 degrees to 135 degrees only. This is also shown with Fig.3 (b) part.<br>
Method Of Performance.<br>
The hundred years old "Ford model" crankshaft is the present prevailing crankshaft performances. For this old way, the firing angle is around 3 degrees to five degrees. For this sine 3 is 0.0523, that is 5.23 percent, which is the energy conversion factor, at that instant. When the angle rotation reaches 90 degrees, sine 90 is one or conversion factor is 100 percent. But by that time, the major expansion of the fuel energy has already taken place. When fuel energy is at its peak at three degrees, the low efficiency factor 5.23 creates the remaining 94.44 percent age (that is 100 -5.23 ) as radiator heat.<br>
So it is the aim of this patent device to make the piston start working for power generation at larger angles, nearer to 90 degrees (100 percent efficient domain ). From Fig.1 , it is clear that when the piston position P1 is effective, two scientific factors are incorporated.<br>
1)	The compression for spark plug firing is at its maximum.<br>
2)	The crankshaft - piston contact E1 is at 45 degrees. The stay- lever contact point P2 - T1 makes it possible for the piston rod, while the spring S allows the 315 degrees to 360 degrees to 45 degrees movement for the crank shaft rod (shown by the pair of dotted lines at 315 degrees).<br>
Point O at the center of the circle, in Fig 1, the main shaft rod is connecting the repeated crankshaft arrangements. Though point O , also Fig.2 points 0-0, the four cylinder repeats the engine performance, as shown in Fig.2 .<br>
At E2 (Fig. 1) and at 135 degrees , the piston rod and shaft rod disengage, when the piston starts slowing down for upward motion and the shaft goes through 135 to 180 degrees movements after which, its reverse motion starts at 180 degrees. When it comes to 315 degrees, the piston is its upward motion, very near to the spark plug point P1 and effects stay with the lever point T1-P2. At the angular point 315 degrees, the shaft continues its "upward circular" motion to 360 degrees and starts back to 45 degrees. Thus one piston firing motion expansion (45 to 135 degrees ) and back to 135 to 45 degrees are completed.<br><br>
This process is repeated with all other three pistons connected through 0-0 points with 180 degrees phase changes. Consequently the 4-cylider improved power generation at the main shaft point O-O ( Fig. 2) is achieved.<br>
Having the major power saving possibilities achieved, with the 3 degrees firing angle to 45 degrees eliminated, then it is evident that large power saving, for the same quantity of mechanical work, at the crank shaft point 0-0 (Fig.2 ).<br>
The utmost modification, with the mechanism is that, the four pistons work in the efficiently improved angles 45 degrees to 135 degrees, for which Sine 45 is having value 0. 7071. That is corresponding to the efficiency factor 70.71 percent, for the lowest and then the highest efficiency factor is 100 percent for the 90 degrees. The net efficiency is the average between these lowest and this highest. Thus the improvement in the efficiencies for this device is occuning between angles 3 degrees to 45 degrees, and that conrespond to the ratio of 70. 71 percent to 5.23 percent, for the relevant factors. Coherencies of the working components, with this invention can be explained with the help of the Fig.1, Fig. 2 and Fig 3 of this complete specification.<br>
Cylinder Diameter and Shaft Length.<br>
In the present day engine designs, cylinder diameter and shaft length are not independent, on the contrary, to effect longer shaft length, the cylinder diameter also is to be larger. Hence is essential to have larger piston surface contact perimeter and area. On the contrary if the shaft length is separated, form the cylinder piston rod as in the present patent application, we can have less piston diameter, for the same power generation, of the engine and hence less piston surface contact (claim 2.)<br>
The device aforesaid will now be described by reference to these three drawings, left with this complete specification.<br>

For simplicity with drawing, only one of the multiple pistons of the engine system, is shown in the piston crankshaft arrangement with Fig.1.<br>
With these explanations for the details of the drawings, the working details of the invention, that is the piston engine, is especially easy to project.<br>
Working details of the invention .<br>
The figure 1, is drawn with correct proportionality, while Fig.2 is not drawn in that respect. In the Fig.1 the crankshaft lever positions are very relevant and hence, the proportionality lengths are followed.<br><br>
The main importance with this invention is to separate the cylinder piston arrangement with crankshaft, through a roller bearing mechanism. These help to have larger lever lengths, independent of the cylinder. That is in the conventional, piston -crank - shaft couplings, the diameter of the piston decides the crankshaft length.<br>
The figure 1, represents the complete details of the mechanism of the invention. In this Fig. 1 , the cylinder is having a roller slide on its side, on which the connected shaft and arm, goes through; ;360 degrees rotations. With the use of the main spring S , the piston with its linear motion, couples the shaft arm, through angular range 45 degrees to 135 degrees ( Fig. 1). This figure represents one cylinder only, of the multiple cylinder engine, for simplicity of drawing. Further there is nothing technically important to project, when the cylinder number is increased.<br>
Fig. 2, represents the top view of the four cylinders, with shaft in unison, at 90-degree position.<br>
Since at 45 degrees, is the starting point for firing {Fig. 3 ; ( b )} and 45 degrees to 135 degrees is the piston power engaging angular range, ( Fig. 1 ), with 4 pistons for the crank-shaft, can effectively power shaft always with driving force. With 5 pistons for crank-shaft, 45 degrees to 135 degrees range can be changed to 54 degrees to 126 degrees, improved efficiency, than 4 cylinder crank-shaft (claim 1 and claim 3).<br>
This consequently has the effect that power-bearing piston always linearly with direction of force of piston. Hence piston sideways friction is less than, slanting coupling piston- shafts of the ordinary engines (claim 2 ).<br>
Since the lever length is independent of the cylinder diameter, it is possible to have piston cylinders with less diameter and larger displacement, resulting greater compression ratio possible. This larger displacement of piston, also means large mechanical advantage of the coupling crankshaft length. Consequently larger compression ratio means larger mechanical advantage also. Claims 1 to 2 results with the practical possibility of improved "mileage", which is of the very major expectation of the aims of engine designing (claim 3).<br>
Since the usual crank shaft angle, of less efficient firing angle is eliminated, less radiator heat is produced. Due to the fact that power piston motion is completely vertical, suitably designed spring action can be effected, while the piston reverses direction from bottom point. That is spring S2 in Fig. 1 .<br>
In the motion of the piston and crankshaft, mechanically there are two types of mass and energy considerations.<br><br>
a ) The inertial load that goes with the circulating motion and with it, the larger the load, it helps to smoothen the circular motion. That is the velocity of motion will be carried further through those angles, when power input is not present even without reduction. But the inertial load preferably slows down the engine accelerating initiatives. In the present case, crankshaft and connecting rods (partly) effect, with the inertial load.<br>
b) The " frequency " load goes with the oscillatory motion. In the present case it comprises the mass of the piston, main spring, the sliding rollers' masses and partly the crank- shafts connecting rods. The ways these are optimised, are part of the technology improvement characteristics, which carries certain amount of mathematics also. Since our aim is to give more importance to fundamental concepts, the mathematical details are not given preferences.<br>
Experimental data for improved efficiency can be worked out. Without giving extensive mathematical details, it can be straight forward expected, that the improved efficiency for this device, is with the ratio of Sine of the angle 45 ° and 3 ° as given by 70. 71 / 5. 23 and this factor gets averaged to the 90 ° efficiency. It must be recollected that the present engines in commercial use, are result of 100 years' pragmatic experiences and in that context, the present newly presenting device is having great potentialities to improve upon, its performances.<br>
The terms and expressions in this specifications are of description and not of limitation. It is cleariy understood, that the various modifications for inculcating this fundamental mode of this device which are possible and are without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.<br><br><br>
I claim: -<br>
1	)       An internal combustion engine comprising 4 or more cylinders, crank shaft<br>
having 360 degrees circular motion, a piston anrangement, a means to connect the crank shaft with the piston arrangement characterize in that piston arrangement is connected to 45 degree part of the crank shaft motion.<br>
