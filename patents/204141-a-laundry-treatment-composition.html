COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10,rule 13)<br>
Title of the invention<br>
A LAUNDRY TREATMENT COMPOSITION<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br>
The following specification describes the nature of this invention (and the manner in which it is to be performed)<br><br><br>
A Laundry Treatment composition<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to laundry treatment compositions for laundry cleaning or treatment products, comprising an ingredient for deposition onto fabric during a washing, rinsing or other treatment process.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Repeated washing of garments, particularly those comprising cotton or other cellulosic fibres, causes gradual loss of material from individual fibres and the loss of whole fibres from the fabric.  These processes of attrition result in thinning of the fabric, eventually rendering it semi-transparent, more prone to accidental tearing and generally detracting from its original appearance.<br>
Hitherto, there has been no way of minimising this kind of damage except by employing less frequent washing and use of less harsh detergent products and/or wash conditions, which obviously tends to less effective cleaning.<br>
In laundry cleaning or treatment products, it is essential for some ingredients to be deposited onto and adhere to the fabric for them to deliver their beneficial effects. Typical examples are fabric conditioners or softeners. Nevertheless, the benefits coriferred by. such conventional materials do not include rebuilding the fabric.<br><br><br>
It has been found possible to include in laundry products, agents which deposit cellulose or cellulose-like materials onto the fabric to at least partially replace the lost material of the fibre.<br>
WO-A-99/14245 discloses laundry detergent compositions containing cellule sic based polymers, to., provide appearance, and integrity benefits to fabrics.  These polymers are cellulosic polymers in which the saccharide rings have pendant oxygen atoms to which substituents XR' are bonded, i.e. they are attached to the rings via an ether linkage. The groups VR' can be hydrogen, lower alkyl or alkylene linkages terminated by carboxylic acid, ester or amide groups.  Optionally, up to five alkyleneoxy groups may be interspersed between the groups are the respective oxygen atom.  At least some of these groups may undergo a chemical change such as hydrolysis,- in the wash liquor.  However no such change would result in an increased affinity for the fabric.  On the contrary, because the "ester" group is configured with the carbonyl group closer to the polysaccharide, than the. oxygen atom. (i-e,,.. esters, of carboxyalkyl groups), any hydrolysis will result in free acid substituents which will actually result in an increase in solubility and therefore, a decrease in affinity for the fabric.<br>
WO-A-99/14295 discloses structures analogous to those described in WO-A-99/14245 but in one alternative, the substituents 'R' together with the oxygen on the saccharide ring, constitute pendant half-esters of certain dicarboxylic acids. A single example of such a material is given.  The<br><br>
dicarboxylic acid half-esters would tend to hydrolyse in thf wash liquor and thereby increase affinity of the material for a cotton fabric.  However, first, this mechanism of action or behaviour is not mentioned.  Second, the hydrolysis rate of such dicarboxylic acids half esters is not as great as that of esters of monocarboxylic acids (which are not disclosed: or claimed in WO-A-99/14295). Third, the degree of substitution for this variant is specified as being from 0.001 to 0.1.  This is so'low as to make the enhancement of fabric affinity too low to be worthwhile for this mechanism of action.  Fourth, the structures described and claimed insofar as they have such half ester substituents, must also have substituents of the type which are carboxyalkyl groups or esters thereof, i.e. of the type also described in .WO-A-99/14245.  In the latter (ester) case, these would hydrolyse to the free acid form. The degree of substitution of the latter (0.2 to 2)   is considerably higher than for the half-ester groups and the resultant increase in solubility would easily negate any enhanced affinity for the fabric by hydrolysis of the half-ester groups. .<br>
Our copending patent application no. WO 00/18860 discloses compositions comprising a water soluble or water dispersible rebuild agent for deposition onto fabric during a treatment process,, wherein the rebuild agent undergoes during the treatment process, a chemical change by which the affinity of the rebuild agent for the fabric is increased.  According to one aspect, the chemical change occurs in groups covalently bonded to be pendant to the polymeric backbone of the rebuild agent via an ester linkage, the ester-linked<br><br>
groups being selected from monocarboxylic acid esters.  In a second aspect, the backbone comprises cellulose units or other p-1,4 linked polysaccharide units, the average degree of substitution of the total  of all groups pendant on the saccharide rings of the backbone being from 0.3 to 3.0.  A preferred fabric rebuild agent is "cellulose monoacetate" which is used to. denote.. a.cetates with.a. degree of substitution of 1 or less.<br>
Detergent compositions containing the rebuild agents are stated to give pH of the wash liquor from 7 to 10.5 for a main wash detergent.  Many of the examples of the disclosure employ cellulose monoacetate with a degree of substitution of acetate groups of 0.48 or 0.50. .<br>
The present inventors have now discovered that cellulose monoacetate of a given narrow range of degree of substitution and molecular weight, when used in a detergent composition which §ives a wash liquor of pH in the range 9.5 to 11.0 more prefetably 10 to 11 gives particularly improved deposition..<br>
Definition of the invention<br>
A laundry treatment; composition comprising a water-soluble or water-dispersible rebuild agent for deposition onto a fabric during a treatment process wherein the rebuild agent undergoes during the treatment process, a chemical change by which change the affinity of the rebuild agent for the fabric is increases,   said chemical  change occurring in or to acetate ...groups covalently bonded to be pendant on a<br><br>
polymeric bakcbone of the rebuild agent and which backbone comprises cellulose units or other (3-1,4 linked polysaccharide units, the average degree of substitution of the acetate groups pendant on the saccharide rings of the backbone being from 0.55 to 0.70, the weight average molecular weight of the rebuild agent being in the range 12,000 to 2.0, Q00, the p.H. of. an aqueous, solution of the laundry treatment composition at 20°C at a concentration of lg of composition p§r litre of water being in the range 9.5 to 11.0, provided that the laundry treatment composition, does not comprise cellulose acetate of average molecular weight 10,000, which comprises acetate groups covalently bonded to  the  cellulose backbone, with a degree of substitution of 0.5§ 0r 0.65, the disclaimed composition comprising linear alkyl benzene sulphonate and a nonionic surfactant comprising a C13-C15 alcohol ethoxylated with 7 moles, of ethylene oxide per mole of alcohol, the weight ratio of anionic surfactant to said ethoxylated alcohol nonionic surfactant of the disclaimed composition being 1:1.<br>
Throughout this specification, "average.degree of. substitution" refers to the number of substituted pendant groups per saccharide ring, averaged over all saccharide rings of the rebuild agent.  Each saccharide ring prior to substitution has three -OH groups and therefore, an average degree of substitution of 3 means that each of these groups on all molecules of the sample, bears a substituent.<br>
According to a second aspect, the present invention provides a method of rebuilding a  fabric to replace  fibre loss due to<br><br>
washing, the process comprising treating the fabric with a composition according to the present invention.<br>
The exact mechanism by which the rebuild agents exert their effect is not fully understood.  Whether or not they can repair thinned or damaged fibres is not known.  However, they are capable of replacing lost fibre -weight with deposited and/or bonded material, usually of cellulosic type.  This can provide one or more advantages such as repair or rebuilding of the fabric, strengthening of the textile or giving it enhanced body-or smoothness, reducing its transparency, reducing fading of colours, improving the appearance of the fabric or of individual fibres, improved comfort during garment wear, dye transfer inhibition, increased-stiffness, anti-wrinkle, effect and ease of ironing.<br>
Without being bound by any particular theory or explanation, the inventors have conjectured that the mechanism of deposition is as follows.<br>
Cellulose is substantially insoluble.in water.  Attachment of the acetate groups causes disruption of the' hydrogen bonding between rings of the cellulose chain, thus increasing water solubility or dispersibility.  In the treatment liquor, it is believed that the ester groups are hydrolysed, causing the affinity for the fabric to increase and the polymer to be deposited on the fabric.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the .Invention.<br>
The Rebuild. Agent<br>
The weight average molecular weight (M„J of the rebuild agent (as determined by GPC) is in the range 12,000 to 20,000, preferably 15,000 to 20,000.<br>
By water-soluble, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms an isotropic solution oh  addition to water or another aqueous solution.<br>
By water-dispersible, as used herein, what is meant is that the material forms a finely divided suspension on addition to water or another aqueous solution.  Preferably, though, the term "water-dispersible" means that the material, in water at pH 7 and at 25°C, produces a solution or a dispersion having long-term stability.<br>
By an increase in the affinity of the material for the fabric upon a chemical change, what, is meant is that at s.ome time during the treatment process, the amount of material that has been deposited' is greater when the chemical change is occurring or has occurred, compared to when the chemical change has not occurred and is not occurring, or is occurring more slowly, the comparison being made with all conditions being equal except for that change in the conditions which is necessary to' affect the rate of chemical change.<br><br>
Deposition includes adsorption, cocrystallisation, entrapment and/or adhesion.<br>
The Polymeric Backbone<br>
The polysaccharide may be straight or branched.  Many naturally occurring polysaccharides have at least some degree of branching, or at any rate, at least some saccharide rings are in the form of pendant side groups (and therefore are not in themselves counted in the, degree of substitution)- on a main polysaccharide backbone.<br>
A polysaccharide comprises a plurality of saccharide rings which have pendant hydroxyl groups. The pendant groups can be bonded chemically or by other bonding mechanism, to these hydroxyl groups by any means described hereinbelow.  The "average degree of substitution" means the average number of pendant groups per saccharide ring for the totality of polysaccharide molecules in the sample and is determined for all saccharide rings whether they form part of a linear backbone or are themselves, pendant, side, groups in the polysaccharide.<br>
Other polymeric backbones suitable as according to the present invention include those described in Hydrocolioid Applications, A. Nussinswitch, Blackie 1997.<br>
Pendant Groups which undergo the Chemical Change<br>
In the case of the first aspect of the invention, the chemical, change which causes the increased fabric affinity<br><br>
will usually be hydrolysis.  In the case of the second aspect of the invention it is preferably lysis, for example hydrolysis or, perhydrolysis or else it is preferably bond-cleavage, optionally catalysed by an enzyme or another catalyst.  Hydrolysis of ester-linked groups is most typical.  However, preferably this change is not merely protonation or deprotonation, i.e. a pH induced effect.<br>
The chemical change occurs in or to a group covalently bonded to a polymeric backbone, especially, the loss of one or more such groups.  These group (s) is/are pendant on the backbone.  In the case of the first aspect.of the invention these are ester-linked groups based on monocarboxylic acids.<br>
Preferred for use in the invention are cellulosic polymers of formula (I):-<br><br><br>
(I)<br><br>
wherein the  groups R are H or CH3CO.<br><br>
Synthetic Routes<br>
Those rebuild agents according to the present invention which are not commercially available may be prepared by a number of different synthetic routes, for example:-<br>
(1)	polymerisation of suitable monomers, for example,<br>
enzymatic polymerisation of saccharides, e.g. per S. Shoda,<br>
■&amp; S. Kobayashi, Makromol. Symp. 1995, BS_,   179-184 or oligosaccharide synthesis by orthogonal glycosylation e.g. per H. Paul sen, Angew. Chem. Int. Ed. Engl. 1995, 3_4, 1432-14 34.;<br>
(2)	derivatisation of a polymeric backbone (either naturally occurring, especially polysaccharides, especially beta-1,4-linked polysaccharides,•especially cellulose, mannan, glucomannan, galactomannan, xyloglucan; or synthetic polymers) up to the required degree of substitution with acetate groups using a reagent (especially acetic acid halide, acetic anhydride or acetic acid) in a solvent which either dissolves the backbone, swells the backbone, or does not swell the backbone but dissolves or swells the product;<br>
(3)	hydrolysis of polymer acetate down to the required degree of substitution; or<br>
(4)	a combination of any two or more of routes (l)-(3).<br>
The degree and pattern of substitution from routes (1) or (2) may be subsequently altered by partial removal of functional groups by hydrolysis or solvolysis or other<br><br>
cleavage.  Relative amounts of reactants and reaction times can also be used to control the degree of substitution.  In addition, or alternatively, the degree of polymerisation of the backbone may be reduced before,' during, or after the derivatisation with functipnal groups.  The degree of polymerisation of the backbone may be increased by further polymerisation or by cross- .linking- agents before.,, during., or after the derivatisation step.<br>

The main wash compositions may include a fabric softening agent and rinse-added fabric softening compositions may include surface-active compounds, particularly non-ionic surface-active compounds, if appropriate.<br>
The detergent compositions of the invention may contain a' surface-active compound (surfactant) which may, be chosen from soap and non-soap anionic, cationic, non-ionic,     '*•.. amphoteric and zwitterionic surface-active compounds and mixtures thereof. Many suitable surface-active compounds are available and are fully described in the literature, for example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents",'Volumes I and II, by Schwartz', Perry and" B'erch.<br>
The preferred detergent-active compounds that can be used are soaps and synthetic non-soap anionic and non-ionic compounds.<br>

from, 0 wt% to 30 wt%, more preferably 1 wt% to 25 wt%, most preferably from 2 wt% to 15 wt%.<br>
The compositions of the invention may contain other anionic surfactants in amounts additional to the percentages quoted above.  Suitable anionic surfactants are well-known to those skilled in the art.  Examples include primary and secondary alkyl sulphates, particularly Cs-Cis primary alkyl sulphates; alkyl ether sulphates; olefin sulphonates; alkyl xylene sulphonates; dialkyl sulphosuccinates; and fatty acid ester sulphonates. Sodium salts are generally preferred.<br>

The choice of surface-active compound (surfactant) , and the amount present, will depend on the intended use of the detergent composition. In fabric washing compositions, different surfactant systems may be chosen, as is well known to the skilled formulator, for handwashing products and for products intended for use in different types of washing machine.<br>
The total amount of.surfactant present will also depend on the intended end use and may be as high as 60 wt%, for example, in a composition for washing fabrics by hand. In compositions for machine washing of fabrics, an amount of from 5 to 40 wt% is generally appropriate.  Typically the compositions will comprise at least 2 wt% surfactant e.g. 2-60%, preferably 15-40% most preferably 25-35%.<br>

Treatment Process<br><br>
Treatment of the fabric with the rebuild agent can be made by any suitable method such as washing, soaking or rinsing of the substrate.<br>
Typically the treatment will involve a washing or rinsing method such as treatment in the main wash or rinse cycle of a. washing, machine and involves contacting the fabric with an aqueous medium comprising the composition of the present invention.<br>
The present invention will now be explained in more detail by way of the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1; Preparation of Cellnlose "Monoacetate"<br>
This was prepared by the methods of WO 91/16359.<br>
Example 1<br>
340 ml of.acetic acid and 60 ml of water are heated to 80°C in a reactor; 63 g of cellulose triacetate are dissolved in this acetic solution.  The reaction medium is mixed with 140 ml of methanol.<br>
The reaction mixture, placed in an inert atmosphere, is maintained at a pressure of 6 bar at 150°C for 4 h.  A further 100 ml of methanol are added, the mixture being maintained at the same pressure and temperature for 8 h.<br><br>
After cooling, the cellulose acetate is precipitated by the addition of acetone, then recovered by filtration and washing.<br>
The degree of substitution and the molecular weight are determined by NMR analysis of the proton and gel permeation chromatography.<br>
The cellulose acetate thus prepared has a. degree of substitution of 0.55 and a molecular weight of 14,000.  The product is soluble in water. .<br>

Examples 11 and Comparative Example ft,<br><br>
Method<br>
100% cotton fabric was mercerised, bleached, woven, not dyed and previously desized by washing in lg/1 Synperonic A7 -f 4.5g/l sodium carbonate at 95°C, followed by rinsing in de-ionised water at 95CC.  The fabric was cut up into 22cm x 22cm squares.  Threads running parallel to the edges were removed to a depth of 1cm, in an-' attempt to prevent' the loss of threads during the washes.  The weight of each square was ~7g and each cloth was to be washed separately. Therefore 70ml of liquor gave a liquor:cloth ratio of 10:1<br>
Two formulations were made up.  The formulation of Example 11 contained a sodium carbonate based buffer to give a final wash liquor pH of 10.5.  Comparative Example A comprised a phosphate based buffer to give a wash liquor at<br><br>
a dosage level of lg composition per litre of water of pH 7.<br>
All cloths were, pre-washed in the appropriate, formulation, without cellulose acetate, at 40°C and for 30 minutes to condition the cloths to the pH.<br>
Three rinses were then performed. After rinsing the cloths were squeezed out and hung .in the test room at 20°C and 65% humidity for 24 hours to dry and equilibrate. After 24 hours the cloths were weighed.<br>
The cloths were then subjected to repeated wash and dry cycles as follows. To each of four bottles were added water (70 ml, 40°C).  To two of the bottles was added the formulation of Example 11 (0.039g) and to the other two was added the composition of Comparative Example A (0.049g). This gave equal quantities of surfactant and cellulose acetate and equal ionic strength.<br>
The cellulose; acetate, .used in, Example 11, As.obtained hy. the method of Example 1 and had a degree of substitution of 0.58 and a weight average molecular weight determined by GPC of 16200.<br>
To each of the bottles was then added one of the appropriately conditioned cloths. The cloths were washed with gentle agitation for 30 minutes at 40°C.  Three rinses where then performed.  After rinsing the cloths were squeezed out and allowed to dry.  In all, each cloth was<br><br>
subjected to 15 wash/dry cycles. After wash numbers 1, 6, 10 and 15, the cloths were allowed to equilibrate at 20°C and 65% humidity for 24 hours and then weighed.  From the weights of each of the cloths, the percentage weight gain of each cloth ( the rebuild) was calculated.  The values are set out in Table 1 below.  It is clear that cloths washed. pH 10.5 show a substantially greater -rebuild than, those'washed at pH 7.0.<br>
