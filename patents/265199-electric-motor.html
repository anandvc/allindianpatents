				<td>Electric Motor Description<br>
The invention relates to an electric motor.<br>
Motors with ventilation/fans for self-ventilation and appropriate fan hoods are known. The fan hoods cannot be stacked and require in the warehouse a lot of space. The fan hoods of the state-of-art of technology are designed as round hoods. In axial direction therefore they are designed as rotational bodies.<br>
Connection boxes of motors are known in which bore holes are made from the inner side. The wall thickness is correspondingly chosen large and therefore a lot of material is necessary for the housing of the motor. As a consequence, the motor is heavy and cost-intensiv <br>
Even in the area of cooling ribs, bore holes are known for the seating of screws, for instance, for screw fitting a type Shield. These bore holes are made in massive material accumulation, which is so large or geometrically disadvantageous that they negatively influence the effectiveness of the flow of cool air along the ribs. Therefore the invention is based on the task to further develop an electrical motor which is stable and environment-friendly.<br>
According to the invention, this objective is achieved in the form of the electric motor with the characteristics given under claim 1.<br><br>
Significant properties of the invention of the electro motor are that the electric motor is provided with a fan and a relevant fan hood, where the fan hood has wavy embossings. The advantage therein is that the wavy embossings enhance the stiffness of the hood and thus the motor itself becomes stable. Further, noise generation is lesser and therefore the environmental emission, especially with reference to noise is reduced.<br>
The wavy/undulated embossings represent deviations from the round-form, known to the state-of-the-art of technology. Thus, the most effective inherent/natural oscillation/vibration moves to a higher frequency range. Under advantageous examples with eight waves, that is heightening and deepenings on the circumference, the heavily represented main inherent vibration frequency that is basic vibration multiplies itself by eight times. The motor still generates however oscillations in the range of 0 to 50 Hz or even 300 Hz with its laminated stack and its winding. The energy share which the fan hood/cover radiates with its displaced basic oscillation in this area decreases substantially.<br>
Under an advantageous design, the fan hood has on its circumference in the circumferential direction heightening and deepenings alternating with each other in the shape of wavy embossings. What is advantageous here is that the fabrication can be done through deep-drawing or even injection moulding process in a cost-effective manner and the design is shapely with simultaneous effect of enhancing the stiffness and decreasing the noise level. Under an irregular distancing or interval of the heightenings and deepenings the generation of noise can further be reduced. Under the following invention, the interval of the waves, that is, heightenings and deepenings is carried out uniformly in the circumferential direction. However, this interval, which can also be referred to as the period-length, decreases in axial direction away from the motor. The entire contour narrows itself therefore towards the fan grill, which is located at the front<br><br>
end side of the hood for the purpose of sucking air. Through this narrowing, the oscillation behaviour can be further suppressed and the stability/strength of the hood further enhanced. Additionally the hood has a beautiful shape and makes an attractive impression.<br>
Under an advantageous design, a stacking edge is visualized on the fan hood. What is advantageous here is that the fan hoods can be stored in the warehouse in a space saving manner. Further, the stacking edge also acts to enhance the stiffness. The stacking edge further limits the wavy embossings. The advantage here is that the oscillation propensity is reduced because the stacking edge interrupts the course of the fan hood in axial direction almost discontinuously, because it limits the embossings. Also as a result the mainly prevalent inherent oscillation frequencies increase themselves.<br>
It has been especially shown that through the narrow space proximity of the stacking edge and the embossings, the stacking edge and the wavy embossings interact in such a manner that the strength of the fan hood is advantageously improved.<br>
Further advantages emerge from the sub-claims:<br>
Reference List:<br>
1.	Flange<br>
2.	Cooling Rib<br>
3.	Almond-shaped swelling/thickening<br>
4.	Fan Hood/Cover<br>
5.	Bottom part of the Jointing or Junction Box<br>
6.	Upper part of the Jointing or Junction Box 20. Cam<br><br>
30.	Cable Screw Jointing<br>
31.	Stacking Edge<br><br>
32.	Commutator Module as option<br>
33.	Fastening Bolts as option<br>
34.	Clamping Board<br>
35.	Device for connecting Circuit Protector/Breaker 80. Drill/Bore Hole in Cam<br><br>
100.	Heightening<br>
101.	Deepening<br>
The invention is explained below on the basis of drawings:<br>
In figures 1 to 6, an invention-based electric motor is shown in different views. The bottom part of the relevant connection box is shown in figure 7 and 8, also in different views.<br>
The motor is designed as an electric motor and has a flange 1 with which an additional drive device such as a gear or mixing attachment can be connected.<br>
On its Stator housing, the motor has cooling ribs 2 which have partially almond shaped thickening. The fan hood 4 is proposed on the side opposite to the flange 1. The connection box which can also be referred to as a clamping box consists of a connection box bottom part 5 and a connection box upper part 6 to serve as a lid or cover, which can be jointed to the former in a detachable manner. The bottom part 5 has cam 20 on its outer side opposite to the stator housing of the motor, which represents material accumulation for bringing about a drill/hole.<br>
Because of the fact that the parts of the motors, especially those parts of the motor which constitute the housing, are designed as far as possible with saving of material in mind, locating a drill in the housing with absurd stability<br><br>
is not simple. Therefore, the cam 20 offers material accumulation in which the drill hole 80 can be made from the inner side of the bottom part of the junction box. The form of the cam is like the fins of the shark. The cams are located in the bottom of the junction box, directed towards the motor. Without inclined side, the stability/strength is not adequately large. The shark fin shaped shape enables, with a marginally more material than necessary in the case of the drill 80, a very high stability. An additional surface which would run inclined, would increase the material consumption further, and would not have however resulted in any correspondingly larger stability-enhancing effect. The drill hole 80 is designed as a precast blind hole. Only the material around the drill hole 80 is used so that minimum quantity of material is consumed, whereby only one side with inclination was proposed for enhancing the stability under minimal material consumption.<br>
The bottom part of the connection box 5 incorporates in its housing wall cables screw joints 30 for drawing of cables. The circuit breaker covered by these is connected to the circuit breaker connection 43.<br>
The optional commutator module 40 Is fastened with the use of the fastening bolts 41 in the bottom part of the connection box.<br>
The clamping board 42 serves at least for connecting the supply lines drawn through the cable screw joints 30 with the winding wires of the stator.<br>
The fan hood 4 has on its circumference in the circumferential direction heightening 100 and deepenings 101 alternating with one another, that is, wavy embossings in the circumferential direction in the suction area of the fan hood. In this manner, radiation of noise is decreased and additionally the stability of the fan hood 4 is enhanced. The fan hood 4 has in addition a surrounding stacking edge 31.   With the use of this stacking edge 31, the<br><br>
hoods 4 can be stored in the warehouse with savings of space. The stacking edge also acts to provide further stiffness to the fan hood 4.<br>
The almond shaped swellings 3 are designed for the purpose of thickening the cooling ribs on the stator house for the purpose of attaching the type shield, i.e. display shield for rated capacities or for instance, on the other side for the attachment of a footboard on which the motor can be mounted. The almond-shaped swellings 3 are arranged therefore within one level. Especially, four of them each respectively belong together. The almond-shape is designed in such a way that it hinders in a least possible way the flow of the cool air between two neighbouring cooling ribs. For this purpose, they are somewhat in the shape of a flow-line or running correspondingly in the shape of almonds along the cool ribs. The cool ribs in these areas are therefore only minimally thickened. Advantageously, therefore the motor gets better cooling than in the state-of-the-art of technology. This is because there is no thickening, which hinders the airflow between two cool ribs along the cool ribs. None of the thickenings connect two neighbouring cooling ribs.<br>
The drill holes are designed as blind holes in keeping with the other invention-based design examples.<br>
Those accumulated thickenings, which can be used for fastening the foot plate, have in yet another invention-based design examples, a cone shaped deepenings in the area of the drill hole to act as centering help during the tightening of the fastening bolts.<br>
Instead of the commutator module 40, in other invention-based design examples, also different electronic circuits can be connected such as motor starter or gentle-starting devices or converter and control circuits, or connecting devices such as terminal strips or holding devices such as mounting rails or similar devices.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
