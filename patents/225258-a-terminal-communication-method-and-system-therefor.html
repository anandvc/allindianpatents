				<td>A TERMINAL COMMUNICATION METHOD AND<br>
SYSTEM THEREFOR<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a terminal communication method and<br>
system therefor, and particularly to a terminal communication system which enables<br>
a plurality of communication terminals to perform communication with other terminals<br>
through a network, and each communication terminal performs local communication<br>
with other communication terminals without a network.<br>
Background Art<br>
Electronic commerce, such as, ordering books or reserving tickets, is<br>
generally performed in daily life by transmitting a request from a portable<br>
terminal through the Internet. In electronic commerce, a goods order is<br>
transmitted to a virtual store, more specifically, to a server connected to the<br>
Internet. Then, goods, such as tickets, are mailed to an orderer or to a store,<br>
such as a convenience store. In the case of a store, an orderer needs to visit a<br>
store to obtain the tickets.<br>
Electronic commerce is performed through a communication network, such<br>
as the Internet, which any number of people can communicate, therefore, a<br>
sender (E.g. a user ) and a receiver (E.g. a server ) must be identified to<br>
prevent impersonation. To this end, a two-way authentication system utilizing<br>
a public key encryption system is known. In an authentication process, a<br>
sender transmits a public key to a certificate authority. Then, a certificate<br>
authority generates an encrypted public key by encrypting a public key with a<br>
secret key of a certificate authority, and returns to a sender, a certificate<br>
including an encrypted public key. A receiver also obtains a certificate from<br>
the certificate authority.<br>
Then, a sender and a receiver exchange a certificate with each other over<br>
the Internet before transmitting money data or personal data and the like, and<br>
decrypt the exchanged certificate by utilizing a public key of the certificate<br>
authority to perform two-way authentication. That is to say, two-way<br>
authentication in electronic commerce is performed by exchanging a<br>
certificate over the Internet.<br>
When two-way authentication is performed successfully, electronic<br>
commerce can be performed. Then, a receiver transmits goods to a sender, and<br>
collects money from a sender when electronic commerce is performed<br>
successfully.<br>
On the other hand, electronic commerce is also performed without two-way<br>
authentication. For example, electronic commerce utilizing a service terminal<br>
installed at store, such as a convenience store is well-known. In this case, a<br>
service terminal is connected to a communication network; and functions as a<br>
kind of a vending machine. When a user operates a service terminal and<br>
inserts coins equivalent to services, such information is notified to a server<br>
through a communication network; and services, such as issue of concert<br>
tickets, and download of game software are performed under control of a<br>
server. Then, a user is able to obtain concert tickets, game software and the<br>
like from a service terminal.<br>
So far, two modes of electronic commerce have been described, but while<br>
each have their advantages, they each also have their disadvantages.<br>
In the first example of electronic commerce, transmission and reception of<br>
information is performed through a communication network; thus, a user is<br>
able to obtain goods without using actual money(coins). However, a portable<br>
telephone itself has no function to issue tickets or the like, and a user is<br>
therefore only able to obtain goods by mail and the like. Accordingly, a user<br>
must wait for a period of time to obtain goods.<br>
In the second example of electronic commerce, a user has only to visit a<br>
store to obtain desired goods, as the goods are issued or provided from a<br>
service terminal directly. However, in this electronic commerce, neither<br>
two-way authentication between a user and a server, and nor transmission and<br>
reception of money data is performed. Accordingly, a user is not able to obtain<br>
goods without paying money.<br>
In electronic commerce, the means such as, two-way authentication through<br>
a communication network, and transmission and reception of money<br>
information, are not utilized, because it is difficult to protect a user and<br>
receiver (a goods provider) by the above means. That is to say, a user feels<br>
insecurity in inputting authentication information, money information and the<br>
like into a service terminal which is not authenticated; and a receiver also feels<br>
insecurity in providing goods by relying on authentication information, money<br>
information and the like provided by a service terminal user who is not<br>
identified.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
In view of the foregoing, it is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
means which makes electronic commerce possible through a service terminal<br>
without inconvenience (E.g. using money ).<br>
Specifically, the present invention makes electronic commerce possible<br>
between a portable terminal, which a user carries, and a service terminal by<br>

Best Mode for Performing the Invention<br>
The embodiments will now be described with reference to the drawings.<br>
The following embodiments describe examples of the present invention, but<br>
are not to be taken as limiting; and the scope of the present invention is open<br>
to a variety of modifications.<br>
1. First Embodiment<br>
1-1. Configuration of the first embodiment<br>
1-1-1. Overall configuration of a terminal communication system"<br>
Fig. 1 is a block diagram explaining the overall configuration of a terminal<br>
communication system according to a first embodiment of the present<br>
invention. As shown in this figure, the terminal communication system is<br>
comprised of communication network NET 1, local certificate authority CA,<br>
IP(Internet Provider) server 20, gateway server 30, mobile communication<br>
network NET2, portable terminal MS, and service terminal T. In the figure,<br>
one portable terminal MS and one service terminal T are described, however,<br>
the number of portable terminal MS and one service terminal T is greater than<br>
one in reality.<br>
Communication network 1A functions as a line for data communication, for<br>
example and may be the Internet or a private line. Local certificate authority<br>
CA and IP server 20 are connected to communication network 1A. Mobile<br>
communication network IB is comprised of a plurality of base stations,<br>
exchange stations, and subscriber process device (not shown here); and<br>
performs radio communication with portable terminal MS. Gateway server 30<br>
is a computer system installed at a gate relay exchange station to connect<br>
communication network 1A and mobile communication network IB each<br>
other. According to the present embodiment, data communication between<br>
communication network 1A and mobile communication network IB is<br>
performed by functions of gateway server 30.<br>
Portable terminal MS can communicate with IP server 20 through mobile<br>
communication network IB, gateway server 30, and communication network<br>
1A. Also, service terminal T can communicate with local certificate authority<br>
CA through communication network 1A. Portable terminal MS and service<br>
terminal T can then perform one to one local communication without the need<br>
for a network.<br>
In resource including a communication application, URL corresponding to<br>
resources is installed. IP server 20 abstracts URL including a GET request<br>
obtained from communication network 1A, and returns resources<br>
corresponding to URL, to communication network 1 A.<br>
Portable terminal MS may be a portable telephone, PDA(Personal Digital<br>
Assistants) and the like if it is a portable terminal which is possible to carry, in<br>
this case, portable terminal MS is a portable telephone. Then, while portable<br>
terminal MS performs data and sound communication through mobile<br>
communication network 1B, portable terminal MS also performs data<br>
communication with service terminal T by infrared radiation. Further, portable<br>
terminal MS has a WWW (World Wide Web) browser, therefore, a portable<br>
terminal MS user can view a page of IP server 20 (resource). Also, WWW<br>
browser installed in portable terminal MS has a viewer function for Java<br>
applet; and when portable terminal MS views a WWW page, Java applet<br>
designated by tag may be downloaded and performed by WWW browser.<br>
Additionally, portable terminal MS also functions to perform various<br>
applications downloaded from IP server 20.<br>
Service terminal T is usually installed at a store such as a convenience store,<br>
or in a station yard; and issues concert or train tickets, or transmits game<br>
programs, music data and the like to portable terminal MS. Also, service<br>
terminal T has interface to perform data communication with IP server 20 or<br>
local certificate authority CA, and further has infrared radiation interface to<br>
perform one to one local communication with portable terminal MS.<br>
In the embodiment, the following electronic commerce will be performed<br>
by the above described descriptions. Firstly, IP server 20 transmits transaction<br>
data (E.g. money data, issue data for issuing tickets, obtainment data for<br>
obtaining game programs, or coupon data worth for exchanging with goods.)<br>
in response to a request from portable terminal MS. Upon transmission of the<br>
transaction data to portable terminal MS, a billing process to a portable<br>
terminal MS user is usually performed. Next, a portable terminal MS user<br>
visits a store where service terminal T is installed, and performs<br>
communication for electronic commerce with service terminal T by portable<br>
terminal MS. In the communication, transaction data is transmitted from<br>
portable terminal MS to service terminal T, and service terminal T provides<br>
goods, more specifically, a process for issuing tickets and the like is performed<br>
if transaction data is authenticated.<br>
Two means will be described according to the system of the present<br>
invention to perform such safe electronic commerce.<br>
A. Means that portable terminal MS confirms that service terminal T is the<br>
authenticated terminal.<br>
B. Means that transaction data owned by IP server 20 is transmitted to<br>
authenticated portable terminal MS, and the transaction data is transmitted<br>
from authenticated portable terminal MS to service terminal T.<br>
Firstly, A Means will be described. Local certificate authority CA has a<br>
function to perform a digital signature; and local certificate authority CA has a<br>
pair of its own public key and secret key. Also, when local certificate authority<br>
CA obtains a request from a reliable person, local certificate authority CA<br>
issues an electronic certificate to the person. In more detail, a local certificate<br>
authority CA holder, a IP server 20 holder and a service terminal T holder<br>
constitute multiple persons each of who, in the operation of the present<br>
embodiment, are connected confidentially; and a community, for providing<br>
services with a portable terminal MS user, is configured. Local certificate<br>
authority CA issues a certificate to a claimant on condition that the certificate<br>
claimant is authorized as a member of the community.<br>
Also, local certificate authority CA is a certificate authority which has a tree<br>
layer structure. In the tree layer structure, a certificate authority is authorized<br>
by a host certificate authority; and has a route certificate showing a certificate<br>
authority is authorized by host certificate authority. The route certificate is<br>
issued by host certificate authority. Then, when certificate authority authorizes<br>
lower certificate authority, certificate authority issues to lower certificate<br>
authority, a certificate showing lower certificate is authorized by certificate<br>
authority and its own route certificate.<br>
In fig. 1, service terminal T is under control of local certificate authority CA.<br>
Accordingly, local certificate authority CA issues server certificate Cs which<br>
service terminal T is authorized by local certificate authority CA, and its own<br>
route certificate Cr.<br>
A message and a message digest are included in server certificate Cs. Firstly,<br>
the following information is included in a message :<br>
(1) Version number : This shows a certificate version.<br>
(2) Serial number : This is a number uniquely assigned to each certificate<br>
issued by local certificate authority CA.<br>
(3) Signature algorism : This is an encrypted algorism utilized when local<br>
certificate authority CA applies a signature to a certificate. For example,<br>
SHA-1 as hash algorism, RSA as means of encryption and so on.<br>
(4) Subject : This is information regarding a person to be certified, such as,<br>
a person's name, a company name, and a country code.<br>
(5) Validity : This shows a period of time for which a certificate is valid.<br>
(6) Signer : This is the name of local certificate authority CA, company name,<br>
country code and the like.<br>
(7) Public key KEYP1 : This is the public key for local certificate authority<br>
CA.<br>
The information above comprises the detailed contents included in a<br>
message. The message is encrypted by secret key KEYS1 of local certificate<br>
authority CA and may be decrypted by public key KEYP1 of local certificate<br>
authority CA.<br>
A message digest is the generated information that message is compressed<br>
by a hash function, and compressed message is encrypted by secret key KEY<br>
S1 of local certificate authority CA.<br>
IP server 20 has functions to perform communication by a public key<br>
encryption system, and digital signature; and is comprised of a pair of public<br>
key KEYP2 and secret key KEYS2. Also, IP server 20 is authenticated by<br>
local certificate authority CA; and has a certificate. The certificate includes<br>
route certificate Cr issued by local certificate authority CA. Further, a<br>
management body for IP server 20 is the same as that used for local certificate<br>
authority CA, for example, it may be a convenience-store chain which<br>
manages convenience stores.<br>
Portable terminal MS obtains public key KEYP1 of local certificate<br>
authority CA from IP server 20 when obtaining transaction data from IP server<br>
20. Then, portable terminal MS requests a certificate obtained from local<br>
certificate authority CA, to service terminal T when portable terminal MS and<br>
service terminal T performs digital communication for electronic commerce,<br>
and portable terminal MS confirms authenticity of service terminal T by<br>
public key KEYP1 when the certificate is transmitted. Then, portable terminal<br>
MS performs communication for electronic commerce with service terminal T<br>
only in the case authenticity of service terminal T is confirmed.<br>
Next, B Means will be described. In the embodiment, portable terminal MS<br>
transmits outside, transaction data obtained from IP server 20 only by utilizing<br>
a communication application downloaded from IP server 20, and a<br>
communication application transmits transaction data outside after confirming<br>
whether a communication partner is authenticated service terminal T. For<br>
example, it may be performed by following procedures. Firstly, IP server 20<br>
transmits to portable terminal MS, communication application including<br>
transaction data, public key KEYP1 of local certificate authority CA, and each<br>
routine for process for obtaining a server certificate from communication<br>
partner, performing authentication of server certificate by utilizing public key<br>
KEYP1, and transmitting transaction data to communication partner when an<br>
authentication result, which communication partner is authenticated, is<br>
obtained. Then, portable terminal MS performs communication application.<br>
For example, communication application is a Java applet. In general, Java<br>
applet is limited to communicate only with a source performing a download<br>
when communication is performed through a network, however, local<br>
communication with service terminal T is not communication through a<br>
network, and local communication is consequently beyond the above limit.<br>
Thus, portable terminal MS communicates with service terminal T by<br>
performing communication application, and transmits transaction data to<br>
service terminal T only in the case authenticity of service terminal T is<br>
confirmed. According to the above method, transaction data is only<br>
transmitted to service terminal T which is confirmed to be authenticated in the<br>
performing process of communication application. That is to say, illegal<br>
copying of transaction data is prevented.<br>
Next, configuration of portable terminal MS will be described with<br>

(AP storage area) 114a, general-purpose storage area 114b. Communication<br>
application downloaded from IP server 20 is stored. Route certificate Cr and<br>
transaction data downloaded from IP server 20, secret key KEYS4, and public<br>
key KEYP4 are stored in general-purpose storage area 114b. Also, when<br>
communication application is performed, CPU 111 generates random numbers,<br>
common key KEYX by utilizing random numbers, and stores common key<br>
KEYX in general-purpose storage area 114b.<br>
Next, configuration of service terminal T will be described with reference to<br>
fig. 3. As shown in fig. 3, service terminal T according to the embodiment is<br>
comprised of system control unit 200, infrared interface unit 210,<br>

through communication network 1A. Service terminal T performs<br>
transmission and reception of various data with IP server 20 by the data<br>
communication.<br>
System control unit 200 is comprised of CPU, ROM, and RAM (not shown<br>
here); and functions as the nerve center controlling each unit of service<br>
terminal T. Also, a communication application in accordance with public key<br>
encryption system, secret key KEYS3 and public key KEYP3 which are<br>
utilized while performing a communication application, and the like are stored<br>
in Hard disk 250.<br>

function.<br>
1-2. Operation of the first embodiment<br>
Fig. 4 is a sequence diagram explaining an example of an operation of the<br>
system.<br>
In the embodiment, IP server 20 and service terminal T are authenticated by<br>
local certificate authority CA in advance for performing safe electronic<br>
commerce. Process for Step 1 to Step 4 in fig. 4 corresponds to the above one.<br>
The process has only to be completed by the time a portable terminal MS user<br>
starts electronic commerce.<br>
Firstly, IP server 20 transmits to local certificate authority CA,<br>
authentication request REQ1 requesting a certificate that IP server 20 is a<br>
authenticated server. (Step S1) Authentication request REQ1 includes public<br>
key KEYP2 and holder information INF2. Holder information INF2 is text<br>
data showing that a public key KEYP2 holder is IP server 20.<br>
Next, when local certificate authority CA confirms that IP server is<br>
authenticated, local certificate authority CA encrypts public key KEYP2 of IP<br>
server 20 and holder information INF2 by utilizing secret key KEYS 1 which<br>
local certificate authority CA holds, and generates public key certificate C2.<br>
Local certificate authority CA returns to IP server 20, authentication response<br>
RES 1 including public key certificate C2 and route certificate Cr. (Step S2) IP<br>
server 20 transmits route certificate Cr to portable terminal MS if necessary.<br>
On the other hand, service terminal T transmits server certificate issue<br>
request REQ2 to local certificate authority CA to certify that service terminal<br>
T is authenticated. (Step S3) Server certificate issue request REQ2 includes<br>
public key P3 of service terminal T and holder information INF3. Holder<br>
information INF3 is text data showing that a public key KEYP3 holder is<br>
service terminal T.<br>
Next, when local certificate authority CA obtains server certificate issue<br>
request REQ2, local certificate authority CA issues server certificate Cs<br>
described above by encrypting public key KEYP3 and holder information<br>
INF3, and transmits to service terminal T, as server certificate issue response<br>
RES2 with route certificate Cr. (Step S4) When server certificate Cs is<br>
decrypted by public key KEYP1 of local certificate authority CA, service<br>
terminal T obtains public key KEYP3 and holder information INF3.<br>
In this case, local certificate authority CA issues server certificate Cs only<br>
to service terminal T under control of local certificate authority CA. For<br>
example, a portable terminal MS user may access local certificate authority<br>
CA to request authentication with his/her own PC, however, local certificate<br>
authority CA refuses the request, which is not from service terminal T, for<br>
issuing server certificate Cs. Accordingly, a user cannot obtain server<br>
certificate Cs.<br>
This description solely concerns IP server 20 authentication and service<br>
terminal T authentication by local certificate authority CA.<br>
Next, electronic commerce performed by a request from portable terminal<br>
MS will be described. Firstly, when portable terminal MS accesses IP server<br>
20 through communication network 1A and mobile communication network<br>
1B, and transmits download request REQ3 to IP server 20 (Step 5), IP server<br>
20 returns download response RES3 to portable terminal MS. (Step 6)<br>
Download response RES3 includes public key KEYP1 of local certificate<br>
authority CA, route certificate Cr, a communication application for performing<br>
communication with service terminal T by infrared radiation, and transaction<br>
data, such as coupon data. A communication application permits to transmit<br>
transaction data from portable terminal MS only in the case specified server<br>
certificate Cs is confirmed; and public key KEYP1 is utilized to confirm<br>
server certificate Cs.<br>
Further, portable terminal MS may request IP server 20 to transmit public<br>
key certificate C2 before transmitting transaction data. Then, portable terminal<br>
MS may verify public key certificate C2 obtained from IP server 20 by<br>
utilizing public key KEYP2 of IP server 20 obtained from another safe route;<br>
encrypt billing data attached to public key certificate C2 by utilizing public<br>
key KEYP2; and transmit encrypted billing data to IP server 20.<br>
Next, when a user visits a store, and operates portable terminal MS to start a<br>
communication application obtained at Step S6, portable terminal MS starts<br>
performing one to one local communication with service terminal T by<br>
utilizing infrared radiation. In this local communication, firstly, portable<br>
terminal MS transmits server authentication request REQ4 to service terminal<br>
T (Step 7); and service terminal T returns server authentication response RES4<br>
to portable terminal MS. (Step 8) Server certificate Cs is included in server<br>
authentication request REQ4.<br>
Then, portable terminal MS performs server authentication process. (Step 9)<br>
Firstly, portable terminal MS decrypts server certificate Cs by utilizing public<br>
KEYP1 of local certificate authority CA, and abstracts a message digest and a<br>
message. Secondly, portable terminal MS compresses the message using a<br>
hash function, and generates a message digest for comparison. Thirdly,<br>
portable terminal MS compares a decrypted message digest with the message<br>
digest for comparison, and determines whether the messages are identical.<br>
Fourthly, in the case that they are identical, portable terminal MS authenticates<br>
that service terminal T is authenticated, and starts performing data<br>
communication. If not, portable terminal MS finishes data communication<br>
since service terminal T is not authenticated.<br>
The above authentication process is performed on the basis of public key<br>
KEYP1 of local certificate authority CA; and it is important that public key<br>
KEYP1 is designated by a communication application. Thus, IP server 20<br>
permits to transmit transaction data, which portable terminal MS has<br>
downloaded from IP server 20, only to service terminal T authenticated by<br>
specified certificate authority (In this case, local certificate authority CA) on<br>
the basis of a communication application.<br>
According to authentication method utilizing certificates on the Internet,<br>
various certificate authorities exist; and communication is usually performed<br>
when a communication partner is authenticated by any certificate(s). However,<br>
illegal copying of transaction data issued from IP server 20 could be made in<br>
the above authentication method. For example, a portable terminal MS user<br>
obtains a certificate from certificate authority by utilizing his/her PC, and<br>
transmits transaction data to the PC from portable terminal MS. In this case,<br>
portable terminal MS would transmit transaction data to the PC by confirming<br>
the certificate as the PC obtains the certificate issued by certificate authority.<br>
When transaction data is transmitted to the PC in this manner, illegal copying<br>
of transaction data would be performed easily. To prevent illegal copying of<br>
transaction data, in the embodiment, local certificate authority CA limits a<br>
partner to give server certificate Cs; and a communication application permits<br>
to transmit transaction data only to specified service terminal T by confirming<br>
server certificate Cs with public key KEYP1. That is to say, transaction data is<br>
not transmitted to service terminal T which is not authenticated, and therefore<br>
illegal copying of transaction data can be prevented.<br>
Next, when service terminal T is confirmed to be authenticated, portable<br>
terminal MS performs data communication with service terminal T. (Step 10)<br>
Data communication will be performed according to following procedures.<br>
Firstly, CPU 111 of portable terminal MS generates random numbers to<br>
generate common key KEYX. Secondly, CPU 111 encrypts common key<br>
KEYX on the basis of public key KEYP3 of service terminal T attached to<br>
server certificate Cs to generate encrypted common key KEYX'. Thirdly,<br>
portable terminal MS transmits encrypted common key KEYX' to service<br>
terminal T. Fourthly, service terminal T decrypts encrypted common key<br>
KEYX' by utilizing secret key KEYS3 to abstract common key KEYX.<br>
Fifthly, portable terminal MS and service terminal T performs encryption<br>
communication by utilizing common key KEYX.<br>
In this case, coupon data and personal data are transmitted from portable<br>
terminal MS to service terminal T, if a third person tries to intercept such data,<br>
such data is encrypted by common key KEYX, therefore, it is very difficult for<br>
a third person to interpret such data. Then, service terminal T transmits music<br>
data and game program to portable terminal MS; or issues concert tickets on<br>
condition that service terminal T obtains transaction data issued by IP server<br>
20.<br>
According to the present embodiment, it is possible to prevent<br>
impersonation of service terminal T and illegal copying of transaction data as<br>
service terminal T is authenticated on the basis of server certificate Cs issued<br>
by local certificate authority CA in local communication performed between<br>
portable terminal MS and service terminal T.<br>
Further, in a case service terminal T is installed in an underground shopping<br>
center where radio waves can not penetrate, portable terminal MS performs<br>
local communication with service terminal T to obtain server certificate Cs.<br>
Therefore, portable terminal MS transmits transaction data only to<br>
authenticated service terminal T.<br>
In addition, a management body for IP server 20 is the same as that used for<br>
local certificate authority CA; that is to say, a certificate certifying a<br>
communication partner for communication, and data utilized for<br>
communication are issued by the same source. Accordingly, according to the<br>
embodiment, communication is performed with a communication partner<br>
authenticated by the source for issuing a certificate, and by utilizing data<br>
obtained from the source for issuing data, therefore, security is improved.<br>
2. Second embodiment<br>
Next, a second embodiment of the present invention will be described with<br>
reference to the drawings. In a terminal communication system according to<br>
the first embodiment, data communication gets started between portable<br>
terminal MS and service terminal T on condition that portable terminal MS<br>
authenticates service terminal T. On the other hand, in a terminal<br>
communication system according to the second embodiment, portable terminal<br>
MS and service terminal T perform two-way authentication. The overall<br>
configuration of terminal communication system in the second embodiment is<br>
the same as that of terminal communication system in the first embodiment in<br>
fig. 1, and therefore explanation will be omitted.<br>
In the embodiment, local certificate authority CA issues a certificate to<br>
portable terminal MS as well as service terminal T. Certificate, issued to<br>
portable terminal MS, includes client certificate Cc and route certificate Cr.<br>
Client certificate Cc is the certificate for certifying that portable terminal MS<br>
is authenticated; and includes a message encrypted by secret key KEYS 1 and<br>
a message digest.<br>
Fig. 5 is a sequence diagram explaining an example of an operation of a<br>
terminal communication system according to a second embodiment of the<br>
present invention. A process executed between authentication request REQ1<br>
to server certificate response RES2 (Step I to Step 4) is the same as that of the<br>
first embodiment of terminal communication system in fig. 4.<br>
In the embodiment, portable terminal MS needs to obtain client certificate<br>
Cc from local certificate authority CA since service terminal T authenticates<br>
portable terminal MS. As a result, portable terminal MS transmits client<br>
certificate issue request REQ5 to local certificate authority CA. (Step 21)<br>
Client certificate issue request REQ5 includes public key KEYP4 of portable<br>
terminal MS, holder information INF4 and the like. Holder information INF4<br>
is text data showing that a public key KEYP4 holder is portable terminal MS,<br>
for example, it may be a telephone number for portable terminal MS and<br>
identification number.<br>
When local certificate authority CA obtains client certificate issue request<br>
REQ5, local certificate authority CA issues client certificate Cc, to which a<br>
digital signature is applied, by utilizing secret key KEYS1 which local<br>
certificate authority CA holds, and transmits to portable terminal MS, client<br>
certificate issue response REQ6 including client certificate Cc and route<br>
certificate Cr. (Step 22)<br>
Then, when portable terminal MS accesses IP server 20, and transmits<br>
download request REQ6 (Step 23), IP server 20 transmits download response<br>
RES6 to portable terminal MS. (Step 24) Download response RES6 includes<br>
transaction data such as coupon data described in the first embodiment, a<br>
communication application, and public key KEYP1 of local certificate<br>
authority CA.<br>
A process executed between server authentication request REQ4 to server<br>
authentication (Step 7-Step 9) is the same as that described in the first<br>
embodiment. After completion of server authentication process (Step 9),<br>
service terminal T transmits client authentication request REQ7 to portable<br>
terminal MS (Step 25); and portable terminal MS returns client authentication<br>
response RES7 including client certificate Cc, to service terminal T. (Step 26)<br>
Next, service terminal T performs client authentication process. (Step 27)<br>
Firstly, service terminal T decrypts client certificate Cc by utilizing public key<br>
KEYP1 of local certificate authority CA, and abstracts a message digest and a<br>
message. Secondly, service terminal T compresses a message using a hash<br>
function, and generates a message digest for comparison. Thirdly, service<br>
terminal T compares a decrypted message digest with the message digest for<br>
comparison, and determines whether the messages are identical. Fourthly, in<br>
the case that they are, service terminal T authenticates that portable terminal<br>
MS is authenticated, and starts performing data communication. Fifthly, in the<br>
case that they are not identical, service terminal T cuts data communication<br>
since portable terminal MS is not authenticated. The same data<br>
communication operation performed in the first embodiment is performed<br>
only in the case that portable terminal MS is confirmed to be authenticated.<br>
(Step 10)<br>
As described above, according to this embodiment, portable terminal MS<br>
and service terminal T perform two-way authentication in one to one local<br>
communication; therefore, impersonation of service terminal T and portable<br>
terminal MS is prevented.<br>
In addition, server certificate Cs and client certificate Cc, both of which are<br>
utilized for authentication, are issued by the same source (Local Certificate<br>
Authority CA), therefore, verification for local certificate authority CA need<br>
not be carried out by utilizing a certificate issued by a host certificate authority.<br>
Thus, a server authentication process and client authentication process are<br>
simplified.<br>
3. Modifications<br>
The first and second embodiments are described above, however, the<br>
present invention is not limited to the embodiments; and may be performed in<br>
various modifications described below.<br>
(1) According to the embodiments described above, portable terminal MS<br>
and service terminal T perform communication by infrared radiation, a<br>
communication system on the basis of IrDA (Infrared Data Association) may<br>
be applied besides that using infrared radiation. Also, communication is<br>
performed by radio transmission. In this case, a communication antenna with a<br>
base station may be used as one for radio communication with service<br>
terminal T. Further, Bluetooth, performing close distance radio communication<br>
by utilizing 2.4Ghz band, may be applied as a radio communication system.<br>
(2) According to the embodiments described above, IP server 20 and local<br>
certificate authority CA are described as a separate unit, however, IP server 20<br>
and local certificate authority CA may be a combined unit. That is to say, if a<br>
server for authenticating service terminal T and a server for distributing a<br>
communication application and coupon data are managed by the same body,<br>
there is no problem that if it is physically configured by one server, or two<br>
servers.<br>
(3) According to the embodiments described above, data communication<br>
between portable terminal MS and service terminal T (Step 10 in fig. 4 and fig.<br>
5) is performed by utilizing SSL (Secure Socket Layer), however, a digital<br>
signature for transmission and reception of transaction data may be utilized.<br>
Two modes described below are provided in digital signature system .<br>
The first mode is that IP server 20 generates transaction data encrypted by<br>
its own secret key KEYS2, transmits it to portable terminal MS; and portable<br>
terminal MS performs data communication with service terminal T by<br>
utilizing encrypted transaction data. In this case, a digital signature is applied<br>
to transaction data by IP server 20, therefore, service terminal T is able to<br>
confirm whether transaction data is definitely generated by IP server 20 by<br>
public key KEYP2 of IP server 20 obtained in advance.<br>
The second mode is such that portable terminal MS and service terminal T<br>
give a digital signature to transaction data to be transmitted each other. For<br>
example, when a concert ticket is issued, firstly, portable terminal MS<br>
generates identification data, and date and time data showing transaction date<br>
and time along with money data and coupon data as a message. Secondly,<br>
portable terminal MS compresses a message on the basis of hash function to<br>
generate a message digest. Thirdly, portable terminal MS encrypts a message<br>
digest on the basis of secret key KEYS4 of portable terminal MS. Fourthly,<br>
portable terminal MS generates random numbers to generate a session key,<br>
and encrypts a message with a session key. Fifthly, portable terminal MS<br>
encrypts the session key on the basis of public key KEYP3 of service terminal<br>
T to generate an encrypted session key. Sixthly, portable terminal MS<br>
transmits an encrypted message digest, encrypted message, and encrypted<br>
session key to service terminal T.<br>
Service terminal T which have obtained the above messages will decrypt<br>
the messages according to the following procedures. Firstly, service terminal T<br>
decrypts encrypted session key on the basis of secret key KEYS3 of service<br>
terminal T to obtain a session key. Secondly, service terminal T decrypts<br>
encrypted message on the basis of session key. Thirdly, service terminal T<br>
compresses decrypted message by hash function to generate a message digest.<br>
Fourthly, service terminal T decrypts encrypted message digest on the basis of<br>
public key KEYP4 of portable terminal MS. Fifthly, service terminal T<br>
compares decrypted message digest with message digest generated by hash<br>
function, and determines whether both messages are identical. Sixthly, if the<br>
both ones are identical, service terminal T authenticates that the messages are<br>
surely transmitted from portable terminal MS.<br>
Further, when transaction data is transmitted from service terminal T to<br>
portable terminal MS, the same procedures will be performed.<br>
(4) According to the second embodiment described above, service terminal<br>
T performs client authentication process after portable terminal MS performs<br>
server authentication process at first, it may be performed that portable<br>
terminal MS performs server authentication process after service terminal T<br>
performs client authentication process at first. Specifically, in a sequence<br>
diagram shown in fig. 5, process for Step 7 to Step 9 may be performed after<br>
process for Step 25 to Step 27.<br>
(5) According to the embodiments described above, portable terminal MS<br>
performs data communication with service terminal T by utilizing coupon data<br>
issued by IP server 20, however, the present invention is not limited to the<br>
above mode, transaction data issued by the other server is utilized as well. For<br>
example, IP server 20 is the server which manages a convenience store, and<br>
other server, which manages other convenience store, is also provided. Further,<br>
a host server which manages each server for each store (That is to say, a server<br>
which manages a convenience store chain) is provided; and it is supposed that<br>
a host server issues common transaction data for each IP server 20. In this case,<br>
portable terminal MS may be configured to obtain transaction data from a host<br>
server, and authenticated by utilizing a client certificate which a host server<br>
issues.<br>
(6) According to the embodiments described above, transaction data is<br>
transmitted from server to service terminal T through portable terminal MS,<br>
however, scope of application of the present invention is not limited to such<br>
distribution of transaction data.<br>
The present invention may be applied for distribution of specified data<br>
except for transaction data, such as music data, image data, or text data.<br>
For example, the following system may be performed. A server<br>
authenticates a communication partner, and transmits to portable terminal MS,<br>
a communication application for transmitting music data. Portable terminal<br>
MS performs a communication application. Portable terminal MS obtains an<br>
encrypted server certificate from service terminal T, and authenticates<br>
authenticity of service terminal T in the process of performing a<br>
communication application. Then, an authentication result which service<br>
terminal T is authenticated, that is to say, only in the case encrypted server<br>
certificate is decrypted, portable terminal MS transmits music data to service<br>
terminal T. Service terminal T playbacks music data only once.<br>
According to such a program, illegal copying of music data is prevented.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, when one to one<br>
direct communication is performed between portable terminal MS and service<br>
terminal T, safety of electronic commerce and the like are improved by<br>
preventing impersonation, and the present invention further prevents illegal<br>
copying of transaction data which portable terminal MS obtained from<br>
specified server.<br>
