PROPULSION MECHANISM FOR ENDOSCOPIC SYSTEMS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an apparatus useful in medical and non-medical applications to introduce accessory devices into collapsible and non-collapsible, body cavities or canals, pipes, lumens and other generally tubular spaces or environments. More particularly, the invention relates to a propulsion system for endoscopic systems. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
An endoscope is any instrument used to obtain a view of the interior of a patient's body using a variety of means to capture and transmit the view to an observer. Endoscopes can also be used to perform a variety of diagnostic and interventional procedures such as biopsies and other small surgical procedures. Examples of endoscopes include: a colonoscope used within the colon, a gastroscope used inside the stomach, and a bronchoscope used within the trachea and bronchi. Endoscopes are often inserted into body cavities or lumens via natural orifices but can also be inserted into incisions to gain access to areas of the body where no natural entrance exists.<br>
Traditional endoscopes consist of a rigid or flexible rod or shaft with a means of collecting and transmitting an image from inside the patient's body. The rod or shaft is inserted and pushed to the location of interest. The rod or shaft typically surrounds a number of pathways used to house fiber optic cables and route instruments, catheters, devices, gasses, liquids and other substances in and out of the area of interest.<br>
Traditional endoscopes require a minimal rigidity for successful insertion and work well when the body cavity or canal, or other lumens having curves and turns. However, when it is constricted, convoluted and consists of many curves, as is the case with the colon, it can be difficult or impossible to push the endoscope to its desired location. Steerable articulating endoscopes are often used to make navigation of turns easier; however, the increased friction associated with each additional turn limits the number of turns that can be -  navigated successfully and ultimately limits the distance an endoscope can be introduced into the patient's body. In addition, the increased force required to complete more turns and corners raises the risk of complications such as bowel perforation as well as the discomfort and pain experienced by the patient. It would be useful to have an apparatus for endoscopic medical procedures that can navigate in such environments and can overcome the physical and procedural limitation of traditional endoscopes. It would further be useful if such an apparatus were self-propelled.<br><br>
Endoscopic devices may also be utilized in non-medical or commercial and industrial applications to obtain views from or introduce instruments or devices into generally tubular spaces or environments such as lumens, sections of pipe or other structures, which may have a number of curves and turns. Such tubular spaces or environments may be partially occluded or have buildup on their interior surfaces and thus present a irregular internal shape or diameter. To navigate through such spaces and environments, it would be useful to have a device or apparatus that can adapt to the internal shape or diameter of the space or environment into which it is introduced and of further use if the apparatus were self-propelled.

Figure 14 is a cross-sectional view of a bladder 104 in accordance with an exemplary embodiment of the present invention. Bladder 104 comprises a flexible material 106. The<br><br>
movement of flexible material 106 is illustrated with arrows in figure 14. With reference to Figure 14, an exterior portion of bladder 104 can be viewed as moving in one direction while an interior portion of bladder 104 is moving in the opposite direction. The result is that the entire shape can move along its central axis while the external material rolls around itself. Thus, the flexible material may be described as circulating around and through the frame in a continuous motion from inside the central cavity long is central axis to the outside where the exterior surface of the flexible material travels along in contact with the interior surface of a generally tubular space or environment or other lumen. A travel direction of bladder 104 is labeled TD in figure 14. This motion is well adapted to travel within a generally cylindrical or tubular space, even a collapsible one, such as exists with the colon or rectal canal. The entire object moves with minimal to no slipping because its exterior surface remains in relatively constant or continuous contact with the interior of the space while the interior surface of the flexible materials moves forward in the direction of travel as shown.<br>
Figure 15 is an additional cross-sectional view of bladder 104 shown in.ihc previous figure. In the embodiment of figure 15, bladder 104 is traveling a in second travel direction TD that is generally opposite the travel direction shown in the previous figure. The movement of flexible material 106 of bladder 104 is illustrated with arrows in figure 15. With reference to Figure 15, an exterior portion of bladder 104 can be viewed as moving in one direction while an interior portion of bladder 104 is moving in the opposite direction.<br>
In some exemplary embodiments of an apparatus in accordance with the present invention, a frame is formed of a support structure and a series of at least two sets of interlocking rollers or skids located on the support structure. The support structure is located within the interior volume of the enclosed ring. The rollers or skids are located so as to maintain the flexible material of the enclosed ring between them. To further accommodate folds and wrinkles in the flexible material the rollers or skids may be suspended and may apply force to the flexible material and the matching rollers or skids. Embodiments of possible suspension mechanisms are illustrated in the figures.<br>
The ends of support and housing structures may be tapered for some applications. Embodiments of the invention having tapered ends are well-suited, but not necessary for medical applications and procedures, e.g., colonoscopy or rectal examination. However, such tapering is not necessary for all applications, particularly those involving spaces or environments of large dimension. The tapered ends of the support and housing structures may serve a number of functions, including, but not limited to allowing the two structures to<br><br>
fit and work together without sliding apart; presenting a smooth and gradual surface to over which the flexible material travels, and easing the apparatus' through constrictions and its passage around curves and comers.<br>
The series of at least two sets of interlocking rollers or skids are located on the support and housing structures or in the case where only a support structure is utilized, the rollers or skids are located on the support structure. A set of rollers or skids may be comprised of one or more roller, one or more skid or combination thereof located on one or more of the structures. A set may be formed of a single roller or skid, a pair of adjacent rollers or skid, a single roller or skid on one structure and a pair comprised of two or more rollers, two or more skids or a combination of both on the other, and other variations and combinations of rollers and skids located in corresponding aligned position on each structure. The rollers or skids are interlocked in two directions, along and across the apparatus' central axis. The interlocking is done in such a way as to maintain a generally constant or fixed distance between the support and housing structures, so that they are in a generally fixed spatial relationship. As shown in the figures, the flexible material of the enclosed ring passes between the rollers or skids. This helps to prevent the toroid's flexible material from being compressed between the two structures except where it interacts with the rollers or skids. When powered, the rollers engage the flexible material and provide a motive, directional force to the flexible material which allows the apparatus to move in a forward or backward direction. With the exterior surface of the enclosed ring contacting and conforming to the interior surface or surfaces of a generally tubular space or environment* the powering of the rollers moves the flexible material as illustrated in the figures. This movement of the flexible material provides the self-propulsion for the apparatus.<br>
If unpowered, the rollers or skids provide a means of facilitating the motion of the flexible material between the support and housing structures, for example when the apparatus is initially being introduced. When propelled, preferably, only the rollers on the advancing side of the apparatus are powered. This will tend to keep the flexible material from wrinkling, kinking and bunching-up by pulling the flexible material through the toroid's central cavity instead of pushing it. However, the apparatus can be operated with the rearward roller {rearward relative the direction of motion) being powered or both forward and rearward rollers being powered.<br><br>
The fluid-filled toroid is also well adapted to the numerous curves, comers and constrictions found in body cavities and lumens. As one part of the shape is squeezed or pushed the liquid or gas is displaced and accommodated by the flexibility of the bladder.<br>
The apparatus may include an accessory tube, such as a flexible tube, connected to the apparatus and leading outside the patient or other space into which it is introduced. For example, as the apparatus enters and travels within the patient, the tube remains connected and is pulled by the device. It can also be pushed or pulled as a means of moving the inside a patient or other space. The accessory tube can be a single pathway or conduit or may contain multiple pathways or conduits which can be used to insert a variety of accessory devices into the patient or to connect such devices to external support devices know to those skilled in the art, including but not limited to computers, analytical or diagnostic equipment or other electronic equipment appropriate to the given application.<br>
Various types of accessory devices can be utilized with or mounted to the apparatus. Such accessory devices include, but are not limited to, endoscopes, cameras, fiber optic cables, electronic communication cables, lasers, surgical instruments, medical instruments, diagnostic instruments, instrumentation, sensors, stent catheters, fluid delivery devices, drug delivery devices, electronic devices, tools, sampling devices, assay devices, other accessory devices, and combinations thereof.<br>
The material requirements for the various components of the invention can be fulfilled by a number of substances. For medical applications, all materials must possess a high degree of biocompatibility and be capable of withstanding sterilization methods know to those skilled in the art, such as radiation, steam or chemical vapor.<br>
The fluid located inside the enclosed ring or bladder may be a liquid, such as a light oil, water, saline solution, lubricant; a gas, such as air, nitrogen, or carbon dioxide; or a combination thereof. Preferably, for medical or veterinary application or use, the fluid will be non-toxic. For the enclosed ring or bladder the flexible material should be a material with puncture, rupture and abrasion resistance characteristic as appropriate to the conditions of the interior surface of the space or environment into which the apparatus will be introduced. The flexible material may also posses a textured surface that would assist its motion against the surface of the lumen it traverses. Other characteristics to be considered in the selection of suitable materials, for example, softness, flexibility and conformability.   The toroid's material must also be capable of being sealed into an enclosed ring or closed bladder by some<br><br>
means such as heat sealing, an adhesive or a chemical bond. A variety of polymeric or plastic materials can be used as the flexible material.<br>
The support and housing structures may be formed of either a semi-flexible or semirigid material such as a polymer or a rigid material, such as stainless steel, a composite material or combinations thereof. The rollers or skids will require a material or group of materials that is high in strength and capable of being formed into very small parts. The roller material must also provide a sufficiently high degree of friction (not slip) against the flexible material without damaging it while the skids must provide a sufficiently low degree of friction (slip) against the flexible material without damaging it. The surfaces of the support and housing structures may be comprised of one or more materials that reduce or eliminate friction caused by the motion of the flexible material across the surfaces of the support and housing structures.<br>
For applications of a non-medical nature, the materials required must retain most properties described above but do not necessarily require biocompatibility or sterilization tolerance. The materials used for the invention in non-medical applications will require sufficient durability and compatibility to suit the environment in which they are to be used.<br>
Though a number of applications and uses of the apparatus of the invention have been identified herein above, additional applications and uses include, but are not limited to, inspection of difficult to reach pipes, tubes and caverns by carrying a camera or other optical, electrical or mechanical inspection device; transporting remotely controlled tools for use in difficult to reach locations; routing or pulling cable, wires, rope, etc. through long narrow passages; pushing or pulling material through a pipe by taking advantage of the invention's ability to conform to the shape of its environment allowing it to provide a seal between the spaces on either side, i.e. the invention could facilitate emptying a pipe of material without mixing it with air or other material on the other side of the invention. Many of these applications would work equally well if the device was self-propelled or simply pushed or pulled from the outside.<br>
While exemplary embodiments of this invention and methods of practicing the same have been illustrated and described, it should be understood that various changes, adaptations, and modifications might be made therein without departing from the spirit of the invention and the scope of the appended claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
