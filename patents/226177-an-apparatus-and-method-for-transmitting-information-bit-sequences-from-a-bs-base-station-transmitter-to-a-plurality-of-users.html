				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a transmission apparatus and method for<br>
use in a mobile communication system based on an OFDM (Orthogonal<br>
Frequency Division Multiplexing) scheme, and more particularly to a transmission<br>
apparatus and method for supporting a multiple access scheme on the basis of the<br>
OFDM scheme.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
Recently, mobile communication systems have developed from mobile<br>
systems for providing a user with voice signals to a wireless packet<br>
communication system for providing the user with high-speed and high-quality<br>
wireless data packets, such that anyone can use a variety of data services and<br>
multimedia services. The third-generation mobile communication system is<br>
classified into an asynchronous 3GPP (3rd Generation Partnership Project), and a<br>
synchronous 3GPP2, each of which are being standardized for implementing<br>
high-speed and high-quality wireless packet communication services. For<br>
example, an HSDPA (High Speed Downlink Packet Access) standardization is in<br>
progress in the 3GPP, and a IxEV-DV (lxEvolution Data and Voice)<br>
standardization is in progress in the 3GPP2. The IxEV-DV standardization for<br>
the downlink is "IS-2000 Release C". Presently, the standardization of the<br>
uplink is in progress, and the uplink is being standardized under the title "IS-2000<br>
Release D". The aforementioned standardizations are needed for users or<br>
subscribers to receive high-speed (more than 2Mbps) and high-quality wireless<br>
data packet transmission service in the third-generation mobile communication<br>
systems. A fourth-generation mobile communication system is needed for users<br>
or subscribers to receive higher-speed and higher-quality multimedia<br>
communication services.<br><br>
Technical solutions for providing high-speed and high-quality wireless data<br>
packet services require improved software capable of developing more diverse<br>
and abundant contents and improved hardware capable of developing wireless<br>
access technology, which can provide users with excellent services and has high<br>
spectrum efficiency.<br>
The aforementioned improved hardware, from among the technical<br>
solutions, will firstly be described.<br>
The high-speed and high-quality data service available in wireless<br>
communication is generally deteriorated by channel environments. Channel<br>
environments for wireless communication are frequently changed by a variety of<br>
factors, for example, white noise, variation in reception signal power, shadowing,<br>
movement of a Subscriber Station (SS), a Doppler effect caused by a frequent<br>
change in speed, and interference caused by other users or a multi-path signal.<br>
Therefore, in order to provide the aforementioned high-speed wireless data packet<br>
service, technology improvements over the second-generation or third-generation<br>
mobile communication systems, and which improves adaptive capacity for<br>
channel variation, is required. Although a high-speed power control scheme for<br>
use in the conventional system enhances adaptive capacity for such channel<br>
variation, the 3GPP and the 3GPP2 which are currently processing a high-speed<br>
data packet transmission system standard commonly utilize an Adaptive<br>
Modulation and Coding (AMC) scheme and a Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request<br>
(HARQ) scheme.<br>
The AMC scheme changes a modulation scheme and a code rate of a<br>
channel encoder according to a variation in the downlink channel. In this case,<br>
downlink channel quality information can generally be obtained by measuring a<br>
Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) of a signal using the SS functioning as a terminal<br>
receiver. The SS transmits the channel quality information to a BS (Base<br>
Station) through an uplink. The BS predicts the downlink channel conditions on<br>
the basis of the downlink channel quality information, and prescribes an<br>
appropriate modulation scheme and a code rate for a channel encoder on the basis<br>
of the predicted downlink channel condition. Therefore, an Adaptive<br>
Modulation and Coding (AMC) system adapts a high-order modulation scheme<br>
and a high code rate to an SS (Subscriber Station) having an excellent channel.<br><br>
However, the AMC system adapts a low-order modulation scheme and a low code<br>
rate to an SS having a relatively inferior channel. Typically, the SS having the<br>
excellent channel may be positioned in the vicinity of the BS, and an SS having<br>
the relatively inferior channel may be positioned at a cell boundary. The<br>
aforementioned AMC scheme can largely reduce an interference signal as<br>
compared to a conventional scheme dependent on a high-speed power control,<br>
resulting in the improvement of system performance.<br>
If an unexpected error occurs in an initial transmission data packet, the<br>
HARQ scheme requires retransmission of the data packet to compensate for the<br>
erroneous packet. In this case, a predetermined link control scheme is adapted to<br>
the compensation process of the erroneous packet, and is considered to be equal to<br>
the HARQ scheme. The HARQ scheme is called a Chase Combining (CC)<br>
scheme, and is classified into a Full Incremental Redundancy (FIR) scheme and a<br>
Partial Incremental Redundancy (PIR) scheme. The CC scheme transmits all of<br>
the packets during a retransmission operation in the same manner as in an initial<br>
transmission process. In this case, a reception end combines the retransmission<br>
packet with the initial transmission packet to increase reliability of a coded bit<br>
received in a decoder, such that the reception end can obtain an overall system<br>
performance gain. In this case, if two equal packets are combined with each<br>
other, an effect similar to that of an iterative coding occurs, and a performance<br>
gain of about 3dB can be attained on average.<br>
The FIR scheme retransmits a packet composed of only redundant bits<br>
generated from a channel encoder, instead of retransmitting the same packet, such<br>
that the FIR scheme can improve a coding gain of a decoder included in the<br>
reception end. That is, the decoder uses both initial transmission information<br>
and new redundant bits during a decoding process, resulting in an increased<br>
coding rate. As a result, the decoder's performance can also be improved. It is<br>
well known in coding theory that a performance gain obtained by a low coding<br>
rate is greater than a performance gain obtained by an iterative coding rate.<br>
Therefore, when considering only the performance gain, the FIR scheme provides<br>
better performance than that of the CC scheme.<br>
The PIR scheme transmits a data packet which is composed of a<br>
combination of information bits and new information bits during a retransmission<br><br>
time. The PIR scheme combines the information bits with the initial transmission<br>
information bits during a decoding process, such that it can obtain an effect<br>
similar to that of the C scheme. Also, the PIR scheme performs the decoding<br>
process using the redundant bits, such that it can obtain effects similar to those<br>
of the FIR scheme. The PIR scheme has a coding rate greater than that of the<br>
FIR scheme, such that it's the PIR scheme performance is considered to be<br>
intermediate between individual performances of the FIR and C schemes.<br>
However, the HARQ scheme must consider a variety of factors related to<br>
performance and system complexity (e.g., a buffer size and a signaling etc.),<br>
such that it is difficult to determine either one of the factors.<br>
Provided that the AMC scheme and the HARQ scheme use independent<br>
techniques capable of improving the adaptive capacity for a channel variation or<br>
are combined with each other, system performance can be greatly improved. In<br>
other words, if a modulation scheme suitable for the downlink channel conditions<br>
and a coding rate of the channel encoder are determined by the AMC scheme, a<br>
data packet corresponding to the determined information is transmitted.<br>
However, although the aforementioned two schemes are used, the principal<br>
problem encountered in radio communication, i.e., the lack of radio resources, is<br>
incapable of being solved. In more detail, multiple access - based technology<br>
having a superior spectrum efficiency must be developed to maximize subscriber<br>
capacity and to enable high-speed data transmission request for a multimedia<br>
service.<br><br>
The publication ("Multicarrier CDMA with Adaptive Frequency Hopping for Mobile<br>
radio Systems". By Chen discloses an apparatus for transmitting information bit<br>
sequences from a BS (Base Station) transmitter to a plurality of users,<br>
comprising:<br>
a plurality of channelizers for dividing a single frame of information bit sequences<br>
to be transmitted to individual users into a plurality of division times according to<br>
a given time interval, dividing the information bit sequences within the plurality<br>
of division times, spreading the divided information bit sequences using different<br>
Walsh codes, combining the spread information bit sequences into a single<br>
sequence associated with the individual users, and outputting the single<br>
sequence (page 1853, column 1, last full paragraph); and<br>
a frequency hopper for dividing the single sequence, distributing the spread<br>
information bit sequences over a plurality of bandwidths capable of mapping -<br>
processing the spread information bit sequences with sub-carrier frequencies,<br>
and preventing each of the bandwidths from overlapping with time-frequency<br>
cells given by the given time interval (page 1583, column 2, first full paragraph).<br>

communication device and a method which are provided to effectively utilize<br>
limited resources using the orthogonal code jump multiplexing technique when<br>
activity of synchronized channels, which hold orthogonal characteristics, is low.<br>
In addition, by diffusing or not diffusing according to the jump pattern which a<br>
transceiver gives to a user removing an unnecessary channel assigned and<br>
return processes, waste by unnecessary controlling signal transmission and a<br><br>
buffer capacitance and data transfer delay, which are small compared to buffer<br>
capacitance as in a first communication station, are reduced.<br>
Song relates to a statistic multiplexing scheme and apparatus utilizing an<br>
orthogonal code jump method in a wire/wireless communication system which is<br>
synchronized through a single medium and a plurality of communication<br>
channels which exist together. D does not disclose the characteristic of the<br>
present invention having a strong characteristic of selecting fading, rather than a<br>
multiplexing scheme on the basis of an OFDM (Orthogonal Frequency Division<br>
Multiplexing) scheme, through a characteristic if a CDMA scheme and a<br>
frequency jump.<br>
EP 1039683 an orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) based spread<br>
spectrum multiple access system in which the entire bandwidth is divided into<br>
orthogonal tones, and all of the orthogonal tones are reused in each cell. To<br>
reduce peak-to-average ratio at the mobile transmitter, each voice user is<br>
allocated preferably a single one, but no more than a very small number, of the<br>
orthogonal tones for use in communicating with the base station. Data users are<br>
similarly allocated tones for data communication, however, the number of tones<br>
assigned for each particular data user is a function of the data rate for that user.<br>
The tone assignment for a given user is not always the same within the available<br>
band, but instead the tones assigned to each user are hopped over time. More<br>
specifically, in the downlink, the tones assigned to each user are change<br>
relatively rapidly, e.g., from symbol to symbol, i.e., the user fast "hops" from one<br>
tone to another. However, in the uplink, preferably slow hopping is employed to<br>
allow efficient modulation of the uplink signal which necessitates the employing<br><br>
of additional techniques, such as interleaving, to compensate for the reduction in<br>
the intercell interference averaging effect. For data communication power control<br>
is employed in the uplink and/or downlink so that the transmission rate is<br>
increased, e.g., by increasing the number of symbols transmitted per tone per<br>
unit time or the coding rate, as a function of allocated power per tone and the<br>
corresponding channel attenuation.<br>

enhanced uplink during soft handoff using the information. A next step includes<br>
transmitting to a serving base station on an enhanced uplink channel at the data<br>
rate determined from the determining step.<br>

due to a multipath propagation, and a frequency-selective fading phenomenon can<br>
also be easily observed even in a transmission band. Therefore, in order to<br>
implement the high-speed wireless multimedia service, an OFDM scheme having<br>
very strong resistance to the frequency-selective fading phenomenon is better than<br>
the conventional CDMA scheme, such that many developers are recently<br>
conducting intensive research into the OFDM scheme.<br>
Typically, the OFDM scheme enables sub-channel spectrums to maintain<br>
mutual orthogonality therebetween, and also enables the sub-channel spectrums to<br>
be overlapped with each other, resulting in excellent spectrum efficiency. Also,<br>
the OFDM scheme implements a modulation process using an IFFT (Inverse Fast<br>
Fourier Transform), and implements a demodulation process using an FFT (Fast<br>
Fourier Transform). For example, the multiple access scheme based on the<br>
OFDM scheme may be determined to be an OFDM scheme for assigning some<br>
part of an overall sub-carrier to a specific user. The OFDM scheme does not<br>
require a spreading sequence for bandwidth spreading. The OFDM scheme can<br>
dynamically change the set of sub-carriers assigned to a specific user according to<br>
fading characteristics of a wireless transmission path, and this operation of the<br>
OFDM scheme is typically referred to as "dynamic resource allocation" or<br>
"frequency hopping".<br>
The multiple access scheme requiring the spreading sequence is classified<br>
into a spreading scheme in a time domain and a spreading scheme in a frequency<br>
domain. The spreading scheme in the time domain performs spreading of a user<br>
signal in the time domain, and controls the spreading signal to be<br>
mapping-processed with a sub-carrier. The spreading scheme in the frequency<br>
domain performs demultiplexing of a user signal in the frequency domain,<br><br>
controls the demultiplexing signal to be mapping-processed with a sub-carrier,<br>
and distinguishes user signals using orthogonal sequences.<br>
The following multiple access scheme according to the present invention<br>
can implement a characteristic of the multiple access scheme based on an OFDM<br>
scheme, a characteristic of the CDMA scheme, and a characteristic of the<br>
frequency hopping scheme which has very strong resistance to the frequency<br>
selective fading. It should be noted that the aforementioned new multiple access<br>
scheme is called a Frequency Hopping-Orthogonal Frequency Code Division<br>
Multiple Access (FH-OFCDMA) scheme.<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagram illustrating an exemplary utilization of time-frequency<br>
resources in accordance with the present invention. In Fig. 1, the abscissa is the<br>
time domain, and the ordinate is the frequency domain.<br>
As to the multiplex access scheme capable of supporting K users by<br>
properly utilizing time-frequency resources, reference numeral 101 is a<br>
time-frequency resource assigned to a first user, reference numeral 102 is a<br>
time-frequency resource assigned to a second user, reference numeral 103 is a<br>
time-frequency resource assigned to a third user, and reference numeral 104 is a<br>
time-frequency resource assigned to a K-th user. The time-frequency resource<br>
assigned to every user is determined by a predetermined bandwidth and a<br>
predetermined time. The bandwidth may be assigned according to category<br>
information of services required by each user. For example, a wide bandwidth is<br>
assigned to a user who has requested a service (e.g., a high-speed packet data<br>
service, etc.) requiring a large amount of time-frequency resources. However, a<br>
narrow bandwidth is assigned to a user who has requested a service (e.g., a voice<br>
service, etc.) requiring a small amount of time-frequency resources. The<br>
aforementioned bandwidth assignment means that time-frequency resources can<br>
be differentially assigned to individual users. In Fig. 1, in comparison with the<br>
second user, the remaining users are each assigned a relatively wide bandwidth.<br>
Particularly, the widest bandwidth is assigned to the K-th user from among all of<br>
the users. In the case of comparing the time-frequency resources 101 assigned to<br>
the first user with the time-frequency resources 103 assigned to the third user, a<br>
relatively large amount of time resources are assigned to the first user rather than<br>
the third user. If the widest bandwidth is assigned to the K-th user, this means<br><br>
that the K-th user currently uses a service requiring much more time-frequency<br>
resources as compared to the remaining users.<br>
The bandwidths BW1, BW2, BW3, and BWk can be represented by the<br>
following Equations 1 to 4.<br>
BW1<br>
n1 = M1 x m 	(1)<br>
where M1 is the number of sub-channels assigned to the first user, m is the<br>
number of sub-carriers comprised of a single sub-channel, and n1 is a total number<br>
of sub-carriers assigned to the first user.<br>
BW2<br>
n2 = M2xm 	(2)<br>
where M2 is the number of sub-channels assigned to the second user, and m<br>
is the number of sub-carriers comprised of a single sub-channel, and n2 is a total<br>
number of sub-carriers assigned to the second user.<br>
BW3<br>
n3 = M3 x m 	(3)<br>
where M3 is the number of sub-channels assigned to the third user, and m is<br>
the number of sub-carriers comprised of a single sub-channel, and n3 is a total<br>
number of sub-carriers assigned to the third user.<br>
BWk<br>
nk = Mk x m 	(4)<br>
where Mk is the number of sub-channels assigned to the k-th user, and m is<br>
the number of sub-carriers comprised of a single sub-channel, and nk is a total<br><br>
number of sub-carriers assigned to the k-th user.<br>
As can be seen from the aforementioned Equations 1 to 4, the bandwidth is<br>
determined by multiplying the number (nk) of overall sub-carriers assigned to the<br>
k-th user by the bandwidth fsc of respective sub-carriers. The number nk of all<br>
sub-carriers assigned to the k-th user is determined by multiplying the number<br>
(Mk) of sub-channels assigned to the k-th user by the spreading factor, which is<br>
equal to the product of the sub-carriers which comprise the k-th sub-channel.<br>
Therefore, if the number of sub-channels assigned to a user is adjusted, a<br>
bandwidth usable by the user can also be adjusted. In this case, the above<br>
operation in which the bandwidth is assigned considering both service<br>
requirements and available time-frequency resources of a corresponding user is<br>
called a scheduling algorithm. Although the present invention does not disclose<br>
an embodiment of the scheduling algorithm, it is not limited to any a specific<br>
embodiment of the scheduling algorithm, and as such may employ any kind of<br>
scheduling algorithms.<br>
The bandwidth assignment for every user must be performed within a total<br>
bandwidth BWT predetermined in a frequency domain. The number (M) of all<br>
sub-carriers available in the total bandwidth BWT and the number (nk) of<br>
sub-carriers assigned to respective users can both be represented by the following<br>
Equation 5:<br><br>
Fig. 2 is a block diagram of a transmitter for use in a mobile<br>
communication system of a multiple access scheme in accordance with the present<br>
invention. A detailed configuration of a transmitter for supporting the<br>
aforementioned time-frequency resource utilization shown in Fig. 1 is shown in<br>
Fig. 2. It is assumed that the transmission of signals (d1, d2,..., dk) associated<br>
with the K users is shown in Fig. 2 in the same manner as in Fig. 1. Also, it is<br><br>
assumed that the signals (d1, d2,..., dk) associated with the K users have already<br>
been channel-encoded and data-modulated. For reference, in the case of<br>
classifying users in the following description, k is indicative of an arbitrary user<br>
from among all the users, and K is indicative of a total number of users. For<br>
example, if 10 users exist, K is 10, and k is adapted to determine an arbitrary user<br>
from among 10 users.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, the signals (d1, d2,..., dk) associated with respective<br>
users are transmitted to corresponding time delay controllers 201, 211, and 221.<br>
In more detail, a sequence d1 of the first user signal is transmitted to the first time<br>
delay controller 201, a sequence d2 of the second user signal is transmitted to the<br>
second time delay controller 211, and a sequence dK of the Kth user signal is<br>
transmitted to the K-th time delay controller 221. The time delay controllers<br>
201, 221, and 221 can adjust a relative start point in the time domain of the<br>
time-frequency resource for every user. For example, assuming that the<br>
assignment of the tirrie-frequency domain for every user is established as in Fig. 1,<br>
the first time delay controller 201 will adjust a relative start point in the time<br>
domain of the first time-frequency resource 101 assigned to the first user. After<br>
the time delay controllers 201, 211, 221 output signals for every user, which adjust<br>
a relative start point, the signals for every user are transmitted to Serial/Parallel<br>
(S/P) converters 202, 212, and 222 corresponding to the time delay controllers<br>
201, 211, and 221, respectively. The S/P converters 202, 212, and 222 output the<br>
signals for every user in parallel in the form of sequences equal to the<br>
predetermined number of branches (n1; n2,..., nk). The number of different<br>
branches (n1≠ n2 ≠,..., ≠nK) may be assigned to the S/P converters 202, 212,<br>
and 222, or the number of same branches (n1= n2 =... =nK) may also be assigned<br>
to the S/P converters 202, 212, and 222. In this case, signals for every branch<br>
generated from the S/P converters 202, 212 and 222 have durations which<br>
increase by the predetermined number of branches (n1, n2,..., nk) as compared to <br>
a corresponding entry signal. The output signals of the S/P converters 202, 212,<br>
and 222 are transmitted to channelizers 203, 213, and 223. The channelizers<br>
203, 213, and 223 are spread in a time domain while being classified according to<br>
entry signals equal to the predetermined number of branches. Thereafter, the<br>
spread signals are summed, such that a single spread signal is created. Detailed<br>
descriptions of the channelizers 203, 213, 223 will be given with reference to Fig.<br>
3. The output signals of the channelizers 203, 213, and 223 are transmitted to<br><br>
the S/P converters 204, 214, and 224. The S/P converters 204, 214, and 224<br>
convert the signal to a parallel signal, and output the output signals of the<br>
channelizers 203, 213, and 223 in the form of sequences equal to the<br>
predetermined number of branches (n1, n2,..., nk). In this case, signals for every<br>
branch generated form the S/P converters 204, 214, and 224 are set to a duration<br>
which is greater than that of a corresponding entry signal by the predetermined<br>
numbers of branches (n1, n2,..., nk). Therefore, user signals generated from the<br>
S/P converters 204, 214, and 224 through the S/P converters 202, 212, and 222<br>
and the channelizers 203, 213, and 223 may be considered to be signals processed<br>
by a CDMA scheme. The number of branches (n1, n2,..., nk) predetermined for<br>
respective S/P converters 202, 212, and 222 at a first end is equal to the number of<br>
branches (n1, n2,..., nk) predetermined for respective S/P converters 204, 214, and<br>
224 at a second end, as shown in Fig. 2, but it should be noted that the present<br>
invention is not limited to the above embodiment shown in Fig. 2. For example,<br>
the number of branches (n1, n2,..., nk) predetermined for respective S/P<br>
converters 202, 212, and 222 at the first end may be different from the number of<br>
branches (n1, n2,..., nk) predetermined for respective S/P converters 204, 214, and<br>
224 at the second end.<br>
Output signals of the S/P converters 204, 214, and 224 are transmitted to a<br>
frequency hopper 231. The frequency hopper 231 can dynamically change the<br>
set of sub-carriers assigned for every user according to fading characteristics of a<br>
wireless transmission path. In more detail, the frequency hopper 231 may be<br>
considered to be a configuration capable of hopping a frequency of a signal to be<br>
transmitted. The time-frequency resource utilization example shown in Fig. l<br>
may be accompanied by fading characteristics encountered at a specific time.<br>
The time delay controllers 201, 211, and 221 are separated from the frequency<br>
hopper 231 in Fig. 2. However, the frequency hopper 231 may include the time<br>
delay controllers 201, 211, and 221 if needed, such that it can adjust the time<br>
delays for every user signal. In this case, the time delay controllers 201, 211, and<br>
221 may be omitted. Although the present invention does not describe a detailed<br>
frequency hopping pattern needed for the frequency hopper 231, a variety of<br>
frequency hopping patterns available for the frequency hopper 231 can be<br>
proposed within a predetermined range in which there is no overlapping of the set<br>
of sub-carriers assigned for every user.<br><br>
The output signal of the frequency hopper 231 is transmitted to an Inverse<br>
Fourier Transform (IFT) unit 232. The IFT unit 232 converts the output signal<br>
of the frequency domain into another signal of the time domain, and outputs the<br>
signal of the time domain. The IFT unit 232 may adapt the OFDM scheme to a<br>
signal to be transmitted. The transmission signal converted into the time-domain<br>
signal by the IFT unit 232 is transitioned to a Radio Frequency (RF) band, and is<br>
then transmitted to a target.<br>
Fig. 3 is a detailed block diagram of each channelizer 203, 213, or 223 of<br>
Fig. 2 in accordance with the present invention. It is assumed that the following<br>
description relates to the K-th channelizer 223 for the K-th user signal.<br>
Referring to Figs. 2 and 3, the K-th user signal is converted into nk<br>
sequences using the S/P converter 222. The first sequence n(k,1) from among nk<br>
sequences (n(k,2), n(K,2).... n(K,K) is transmitted to a first spreading unit 302, and is<br>
multiplied by an orthogonal sequence W0, such that it is spread. The second<br>
sequence n(K,2) from among the nk sequences (n(k,1), n(k,2),...., n(K,K)) is transmitted<br>
to a second spreading unit 303, and is multiplied by an orthogonal sequence W1,<br>
such that it is spread. The n-th sequence n(K,n) from among the nk sequences<br>
(n(K,1), n(K,2)..., n(K,K)) is transmitted to an n-th spreading unit 304, and is<br>
multiplied by an orthogonal sequence Wn-1, such that it is spread. If the<br>
aforementioned spreading using different orthogonal sequences for every entry<br>
sequence is performed, interference does not occur in the entry sequences. The n<br>
spreading signals generated from the first to n-th spreading units 302, 303, and<br>
304 are transmitted to an adder 305. The adder 305 sums the spreading signals,<br>
and outputs a sequence of a single spreading signal. The spreading signal<br>
generated from the adder 305 is transmitted to a scrambler 306. The scrambler<br>
306 receives a scrambling sequence as another entry signal, and multiplies the<br>
spreading signal by the scrambling sequence, and outputs a scrambled signal.<br>
The scrambler 306 prevents interference from being generated due to the<br>
frequency hit phenomenon wherein a corresponding signal is overlapped with an<br>
output signal of a nearby BS (Base Station) in a frequency domain under cellular<br>
environments. The scrambler 306 is introduced as a method for improving<br>
reception performance of the corresponding signal. If the influence of an<br>
interference signal transmitted from the nearby BS is negligible, the scrambler<br>
306 may be omitted if needed. Fig. 3 depicts a detailed configuration of the<br><br>
channelizer 223 associated with m sequences (i.e. first sequences) to be<br>
transmitted over the same sub-channel from among the nk sequences (n(K,1), n(K,2),<br>
..., n(K,K)) equal to the output signals of the S/P converter 222 of Fig. 2. In more<br>
detail, Fig. 3 depicts some parts of the channelizer 223 of Fig. 2. The remaining<br>
sequences from among the nk sequences (n(K,1), n(K,1),..., n(K,K)) equal to the output<br>
signals of the S/P converter 222 of Fig. 2 are grouped in n units. The n grouped<br>
sequences are channelized as in Fig. 3, and are transmitted over different<br>
sub-channels.<br>
As can be seen from the description of the transmitter shown in Figs. 2 and<br>
3, the multiple access method according to the present invention can implement a<br>
characteristic of the multiple access scheme based on an OFDM scheme, a<br>
characteristic of the CDMA scheme, and a characteristic of the frequency hopping<br>
scheme which has very-strong resistance to the frequency selective fading.<br>
Fig. 4 is a diagram illustrating an example of effectively using the<br>
time-frequency resource in accordance with the present invention. In Fig. 4, a<br>
unit square is comprised of a predetermined number of sub-carriers, and is<br>
referred to as a Time-Frequency Cell (TRC) having the same duration as the<br>
OFDM symbol interval. A plurality of sub-carriers are assigned to the TFC.<br>
Data corresponding to respective sub-carriers assigned to the TFC is processed by<br>
the CDMA scheme, and is then processed by the OFDM scheme using the<br>
respective sub-carriers. In the case of using the CDMA scheme, data is spread<br>
by a predetermined channelization code prescribed for every sub-carrier, and the<br>
spread data is scrambled by a prescribed scrambling code. In Fig. 4, a Frame<br>
Cell (FC) is defined as a time-frequency domain having both a bandwidth fFC<br>
equal to a predetermined multiple (e.g., 32 times) of the TFC, and a frame<br>
duration equal to a predetermined multiple (e.g., 16 times) of the TFC. If the FC<br>
is adapted to the present invention, the measurement result of wireless<br>
transmission is not frequently reported during the application time of the AMC<br>
technology.<br>
Fig. 4 depicts two different sub-channels contained in a single FC, i.e. a<br>
sub-channel A and a sub-channel B. The two different sub-channels may be<br>
assigned to different users, respectively, or may also be assigned to one user.<br>
The respective sub-channels are frequency-hopping-processed by a predetermined<br><br>
frequency interval according to a change in time. This means that sub-channels<br>
assigned to respective users are dynamically changed according to fading<br>
characteristics varying with time. Fig. 4 depicts an example of a certain pattern<br>
of the frequency hopping pattern. However, the present invention is not always<br>
limited to the exemplary pattern of Fig. 4, as the frequency hopping pattern of the<br>
present invention can be defined in various ways as needed.<br>
In the case of using the AMC technology, an SS (Subscriber Station)<br>
measures a current state of a wireless transmission path at predetermined time<br>
intervals, and reports the measurement result to a BS (Base Station). Upon<br>
receipt of the wireless transmission path state information from the SS, the BS<br>
changes the AMC scheme. The changed AMC scheme is reported to the SS.<br>
Then, the SS transmits a signal to a desired target using the modulation and<br>
coding schemes as changed by the BS. The present invention reports the<br>
wireless transmission path state information in FC units, such that it can reduce<br>
load encountered by the AMC technology. The FC can be properly adjusted.<br>
according to the amount of overhead information encountered by the AMC<br>
technology. For example, if a large amount of overhead information exists, the<br>
FC is widened. If a small amount of overhead information exists, the FC is<br>
narrowed.<br>
A transmitter for providing a specific user with a service can generally use<br>
a plurality of sub-channels. QoS (Quality of Service) and the number of<br>
simultaneous users must be considered in order to use the plurality of<br>
sub-channels.<br>
Fig. 5 is a block diagram of forward channels capable of providing a<br>
high-speed wireless multimedia service in accordance with the present invention.<br>
In more detail, a forward channel for an FH-OFCDMA(Frequency<br>
Hopping-Orthogonal Frequency Code Division Multiple Access) scheme<br>
indicative of a multiple access scheme proposed by the present invention is<br>
defined as a "FORWARD FH-OFCDMA CHANNEL" in Fig. 5. The<br>
"FORWARD FH-OFCDMA CHANNEL" may be comprised of a pilot channel, a<br>
synchronous (sync) channel, a preamble channel, a traffic channel, and a shared<br>
control channel, or may also be comprised of only the preamble channel. An<br>
example of the "FORWARD FH-OFCDMA CHANNEL" will be described with<br><br>
reference to Figs. 6 and 7. The pilot channel may allow an SS to acquire a BS,<br>
or may be adapted to perform channel estimation. The sync channel may allow<br>
the SS to acquire BS information and timing information. The preamble channel<br>
is basically adapted to perform frame synchronization, or may also be adapted to<br>
perform channel estimation. The traffic channel is adapted as a physical channel<br>
for transmitting information data. Although the preamble channel is separately<br>
denoted in Fig. 5 to establish frame synchronization, the preamble information<br>
transmitted over the preamble channel may be transmitted as a preamble of a<br>
frame transmitted over the traffic channel if needed. The shared control channel<br>
is used as a physical channel for transmitting control information needed for<br>
receiving the information data transmitted over the traffic channel.<br>
Fig. 6 is a detailed block diagram of an exemplary transmitter which<br>
implements the channel configuration of Fig. 5. Transmitters of individual<br>
channels shown in Fig. 5 are shown in Fig. 6.<br>
The transmitters of individual channels will hereinafter be described with<br>
reference to Fig. 6.<br>
Regarding a transmitter for transmitting user data over the traffic channel,<br>
a sequence of coded bits of the k-th user is generated from a channel encoding<br>
process (not shown), and is then transmitted to a modulator 601. The modulator<br>
601 modulates the coded bits using a QPSK, 16QAM, or 64QAM modulation<br>
scheme, and outputs modulation symbols. In the case of using the AMC scheme,<br>
the modulation scheme used by the modulator 601 is determined by the BS<br>
according to current wireless transmission path state information. A plurality of<br>
modulation symbols generated from the modulator 601 each have a complex<br>
value.<br>
The modulation symbols generated from the modulator 601 are transmitted<br>
to the rate matcher 602. A sequence repeat process or a symbol punching<br>
process is applied to the modulation symbols received in the rate matcher 602.<br>
In more detail, the rate matcher 602 fabricates the modulation symbols to match a<br>
transmission format of a packet transmitted over a radio channel, and outputs the<br>
fabrication result. In this case, the transmission format includes the number of<br>
modulation symbols capable of being transmitted via a single frame. The<br><br>
modulation symbol sequence generated from the rate matcher 602 is transmitted<br>
to a first demultiplexer 603, The first demultiplexer 603 demultiplexes the<br>
modulation symbol sequence, and outputs modulation symbol sequences for every<br>
sub-channel by the predetermined number of branches. The number of branches<br>
corresponds to the number (Mk) of sub-channels used for a k-th user service, and<br>
Mk may be determined to be a number from 1 to 16. The reference character 'k'<br>
a number between 1 and K, and the reference character 'K' is defined as the<br>
number of maximum service available users. In this case, the modulation<br>
symbol sequences for every sub-channel, which are generated for every branch<br>
using the first demultiplexer 603, have predetermined durations. However, this<br>
is not related to the duration of the modulation symbol sequence received in the<br>
first demultiplexer 603.<br>
Upon receipt of modulation symbol sequences for every sub-channel from<br>
the first demultiplexer 603, a maximum of Mk sub-channel transmitters is needed<br>
to transmit the received modulation symbol sequences over different<br>
sub-channels. Therefore, Fig. 6 depicts Mk sub-channel transmitters. Although<br>
the sub-channel transmitters are different from each other with respect to the<br>
reception modulation symbol sequences, they perform the same operation, such<br>
that the following description will relate to only one sub-channel transmitter for<br>
the convenience of description. One or more sub-channels may be assigned to<br>
traffic channels of respective users, such that one or more sub-channel<br>
transmitters may also be adapted to transmit data over the traffic channels of the<br>
respective users.<br>
The modulation symbol sequences for every sub-channel, which have been<br>
received from the first demultiplexer 603, are transmitted to a corresponding<br>
second demultiplexer from among Mk second demultiplexers 604 and 614. For<br>
example, a modulation symbol sequence corresponding to the first sub-channel<br>
from among the modulation symbol sequences for every sub-channel, which have<br>
been received from the first demultiplexer 603, is transmitted to a second<br>
demultiplexer 604. The second demultiplexer 604 demultiplexes the modulation<br>
symbol sequence corresponding to the first sub-channel, and outputs a plurality of<br>
modulation symbol sequences for every sub-carrier. The number of modulation<br>
symbol sequences for every sub-carrier is equal to the number 'm' of sub-carriers<br>
contained in only one sub-channel. In this case, the modulation symbol<br><br>
sequences for every sub-carrier each have a predetermined duration which is<br>
greater than of the number of modulation symbols for every sub-channel by 'm'<br>
times. The modulation symbol sequences for every sub-carrier, which have been<br>
received from the second demultiplexer 604, are transmitted to a channel divider<br>
605. The channel divider 605 spreads the modulation symbol sequences for<br>
every sub-carrier using an orthogonal sequence having a predetermined length<br>
'm', and outputs the spread modulation symbol sequences. In this case, the<br>
modulation symbol sequences for every sub-carrier will be spread by different<br>
orthogonal sequences. Output sequences, in chip units, which have been spread<br>
according to individual sub-carriers by the channel divider 605, are transmitted to<br>
an adder 606. The adder 606 sums the output sequences for every sub-carrier in<br>
chip units, and outputs the added result in the form of a single sequence. The<br>
output sequence of the adder 606 is transmitted to a scrambler 607. The<br>
scrambler 607 multiplies a scrambling code generated from a scrambling<br>
sequence generator 613 by the output sequence of the adder 606, and outputs a<br>
scrambled sequence. The aforementioned components from the second<br>
multiplexer 604 receiving the modulation symbol sequence to the scrambler 607<br>
generating the scrambled sequence may be equal to components needed for signal<br>
processing corresponding to the CDMA scheme.<br>
The scrambled sequence is transmitted to a mapping unit 608. The<br>
scrambled sequence received in the mapping unit 608 is mapping-processed with<br>
sub-carriers comprising a first sub-channel assigned to the scrambled sequence.<br>
The mapping unit 608 may perform a frequency hopping function capable of<br>
dynamically changing sub-carriers comprising the sub-channel according to<br>
fading characteristics of the wireless transmission path.<br>
Although the aforementioned description does not disclose a detailed<br>
example, it is obvious that sub-channel transmitters corresponding to the<br>
remaining sub-channels other than the first sub-channel can output data to<br>
individual sub-channels in the same manner as in the aforementioned sub-channel<br>
transmitter.<br>
Secondly, as to the pilot channel transmitter for transmitting a pilot signal<br>
(i.e. unmodulated signal) over a pilot channel, the unmodulated signal is<br>
transmitted to a pilot tone position determination unit 621. The pilot tone<br><br>
position determination unit 621 determines a sub-carrier position at which a pilot<br>
tone is to be inserted. Therefore, the pilot tone will be inserted into the<br>
determined sub-carrier position.<br>
Thirdly, as to the synch channel transmitter for transmitting information<br>
data over a sync channel, the information data is transmitted to a channel encoder<br>
631. The channel encoder 631 encodes the information data of the sync channel,<br>
and outputs the encoded information data. The encoded information data is<br>
transmitted to a modulator 632. The modulator 632 modulates the encoded<br>
information data according to a predetermined modulation scheme, and outputs<br>
the modulation result in the form of sync channel data.<br>
Fourthly, as to the shared channel transmitter for transmitting control<br>
information over a shared control channel, the control information is transmitted<br>
to the channel encoder 641. The channel encoder 641 encodes the control<br>
information of the shared control channel, and outputs the encoded control<br>
information. The encoded control information is transmitted to a modulator 642.<br>
The modulator 642 modulates the encoded control information according to a<br>
predetermined modulation scheme, and outputs the modulation result in the form<br>
of shared control channel data.<br>
Fig. 7 depicts a configuration for the FORWARD FH-OFCDMA<br>
CHANNEL in accordance with the present invention. An input end "A" shown<br>
in Fig. 7 is connected to an output end "A" shown in Fig. 6, such that a transmitter<br>
of the present invention can be implemented. Therefore, output signals of the<br>
transmitter of Fig. 6 are transmitted to the input end "A" of Fig. 7. The output<br>
signals are comprised of traffic channel data, pilot channel data, sync channel<br>
data, and shared control channel data, which are generated from each sub-channel.<br>
Referring to Fig. 7, the output signals of Fig. 6 are transmitted to input<br>
terminals of a Time Division Multiplexer (TDM) through the input terminal "A".<br>
A preamble channel signal is also transmitted to other input terminals of the TDM<br>
701. The TDM 701 TDM-processes the output signals of Fig. 6 and the<br>
preamble channel signal, and outputs the TDM-processing result. Referring<br>
back to Fig. 4, a single FC is comprised of 16 TFCs in a time domain. The TDM<br>
701 selects/outputs the preamble channel in a first TFC from among the 16 TFCs,<br><br>
and selects/outputs the output signals in the remaining 15 TFCs other than the first<br>
TFC. Output signals corresponding to either the preamble channel signal or the<br>
remaining channel signals, having been generated from the TDM 701, are<br>
transmitted to an IFT (Inverse Fourier Transform) unit 702. The IFT unit 702<br>
IFT-processes its own input signal from among the output signals which<br>
correspond to either the preamble channel signal or the remaining channel signals,<br>
such that it converts a frequency-domain signal into a time-domain signal. The<br>
output signal of the IFT unit 702 is transmitted as "FORWARD FH-OFCDMA<br>
CHANNEL" of the present invention.<br>
As apparent from me above description, in the case of using a multiple<br>
access scheme and time-frequency resource utilization according to the present<br>
invention, time-frequency resources can be effectively used, and spectrum<br>
efficiency can be maximized. Therefore, it is expected that the present invention<br>
will effectively provide a high-speed wireless multimedia service satisfying the<br>
objectives of the next-generation mobile communication system.<br>
Also, the present invention can implement a characteristic of the multiple<br>
access scheme based on an OFDM scheme, a characteristic of a CDMA scheme,<br>
and a characteristic of a frequency hopping scheme which has very strong<br>
resistance to the frequency selective fading.<br>
Although the preferred embodiments of the present invention have been<br>
disclosed for illustrative purposes, those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
various modifications, additions and substitutions are possible, without departing<br>
from the scope and spirit of the invention as disclosed in the accompanying<br>
