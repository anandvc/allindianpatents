				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to a recombinant protein useful for inhibiting anthrax toxin. The invention also provides a method for inhibition of anthrax toxin action using the new molecule. The main utility of the invention is to develop a candidate molecule for anthrax toxin inhibition and for providing a method for inactivation of toxic activity of a toxin of the nature of anthrax toxin. This molecule has potential for use as a therapeutic agent in neutralizing anthrax toxin action in individuals infected with Bacillus anthracis<br>
Related Prior art<br>
Anthrax is a bacterial disease caused by Bacillus anthracis. The disease primarily affects<br>
herbivores but humans can also get infected while dealing with such animals. B. anthracis is a potential agent of bio-terrorism. Main symptoms comprise dizziness, fever, edema followed by death. The toxic action of anthrax has been attributed to anthrax toxin produced by the bacterium. The toxin can be resolved into three distinct protein components protective antigen (PA), lethal factor (LF) and edema factor (EF). The combination of EF and PA (edema toxin) produces skin edema, while LF and PA (Lethal toxin) are lethal to animals. The three proteins are individually non-toxic. EF is a calcium and calmodulin dependent adenylate cyclase that acts by increasing the intracellular cAMP levels in eukaryotic cells and LF is a Zn.sup.2+ dependent metalloprotease that leads to increase in IL-1 and TNF-.alpha, production by susceptible cells and cleaves several MAP Kinase Kinases (MKK 1, 2 and 3) (Leppla, 1999). According to the current model of anthrax toxin action, PA binds to anthrax toxin receptor present on cell surface and gets proteolytically activated by cell surface proteases to PA63. This allows oligomerization and binding of LF/EF. The toxin complex is internalized by receptor mediated endocytosis and is exposed to acidic pH inside the endosome. This change in pH triggers both membrane insertion by PA63 and translocation of LF/EF into the cytosol (Leppla, 1999).The main object of the invention is to provide a novel molecule for anthrax toxin inhibition.<br>
Another object is to provide a method for inactivation of toxic activity of a toxin of the nature similar<br>
to that of anthrax toxin.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to provide a therapeutic agent for use in neutralizing anthrax<br>
toxin action in individuals infected with Bacillus anthracis.<br>

Reagents:<br>
Biochemicals and reagents were purchased from Sigma Chemical Co., St. Louis, USA.<br>
Bacterial culture media was purchased from Difco Laboratories, Becton Dickinson, Delhi,<br>
India. The enzymes and chemicals for DNA manipulations were obtained from New England<br>
BioLabs, USA.   3H-Leucine were obtained from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech, Piscataway,<br>
NJ, USA.<br>
The Chinese Hamster Ovary cell line (CHO-K1) and J774A.1 macrophage cell line were<br>

serum and 50 |J.g/ml gentamicin sulfate (Life Technologies, Inc., USA) at 37 °C in a CO2<br>
incubator.<br>
EXAMPLE 2:<br>
Construction of the mutant PA gene: Mutation in the PA gene was constructed in the plasmid pYS5 (Singh et al., 1989).   A non-mutagenic oligonucleotide primer corresponding to nucleotides 2169-2200 and spanning the unique HindIII site was used for PCR with a mutagenic primer corresponding to nucleotides<br><br>
2785-2860 encompassing the unique PstI site and containing the desired mutations at<br>
nucleotides 2792-2851 (nucleotide numbering is according to Welkos et al., 1988). PCR was<br>
performed in a 100 ul tube at the following conditions:<br>
94 °C: 1 min.<br>
94 °C: 30 sec<br>
55 °C: 1 min<br>
72 °C: 1 min<br>
72 °C: 10 min<br>
4°C:1h<br>
The constituents of the reaction were:<br>
1 OX PCR buffer: IX<br>
Template DNA: 0.5 µg<br>
Forward primer: 0.5 µM<br>
Reverse Primer: 0.5 µM<br>
dNTPs: 20 µM<br>
Taq DNA polymerase: 2.5 U/µl<br>
The amplified PCR product was digested with PstI and Hindlll as describer below:<br>
1 OX Buffer:1X<br>
Template: 10 µg<br>
PstI: 10 U<br>
HindIII:10U<br>
and purified on a 1% low melting point agarose gel. The DNA sample was dissolved in 6X<br>
sample buffer (final concentration 1X), loaded on low melting point agarose gel and run at<br>
50V. The plasmid pYS5 was digested with the same enzymes, purified on agarose gel and<br>
ligated to the mutant fragment. The DNA sequence of the mutant PA gene was verified by<br>
DNA sequencing of at least 200 base pairs spanning the mutated region.<br>
EXAMPLE 3:<br>
Expression and purification of recombinant protein PA-I:<br>
The plasmid carrying the desired sequence was transformed into E. coli dam dcm strain SCS110. Unmethylated plasmid DNA was purified and used to transform B. anthracis<br><br>
BH441. B. anthracis was transformed by adding 2 µg of DNA into electrocompetent cells and exposing them to a voltage of 1.5 kV and resistance of 200 Ω The transformed culture was grown overnight and the cell supernatant was concentrated using concentrator and the protein analyzed using SDS-PAGE.<br>
EXAMPLE 4:<br>
Molecular weight determination:<br>
The molecular weight of PA-I was determined by SDS-PAGE (Laemlli, 1970). The protein sample (2 µg) was dissolved in 5X SDS dye (final concentration 1X) and run on the 10 % gel. The molecular weight of PA-I was found to be equal to that of native PA (83 kDa) as determined by SDS-PAGE using appropriate molecular weight standards (Figure 1).<br>
EXAMPLE 5: Cytotoxicity assay : To study the cytotoxicity, varying concentrations of PA and PA-I were added to J774A.1 cells together with LF (1.0 µg/ml) and incubated for 3 h at 37°C.    At the end of the experiment, cell viability was determined using MTT assay (Singh et al., 1994).   The result showed that the mutant PA protein PA-I is completely non-toxic to J774A.1 cells (Figure 2).<br>
EXAMPLE 6:<br>
Inhibition of the activity of native PA by PA-I Inhibition of activity of native PA by PA-I was investigated by mixing of the mutant PA protein and native type PA at varying ratios resulted in alterations in the cytotoxic activity of the toxin containing the native protein (PA plus LF). When the mutant and native PA were present at equimolar concentrations, complete inhibition in protein synthesis of CHO-Kl cells was observed. A significant inhibition could be detected when the ratio of PA-I to PA was 1:4. These data suggest that the PA-I inhibits native PA mediated cellular intoxication (Figure 3).<br>
EXAMPLE   7:<br>
Inhibition of pore forming ability of native PA by PA I:<br>
Recombinant protein (PA-I) and the native protein (PA) were mixed together   (2 µg/ml each)<br>
at the neutral pH and incubated with CHO-Kl cells preloaded with 86Rb+ at 4 °C.  After 2 h,<br>
the cells were washed to remove unbound proteins and incubated with isotonic buffer of pH<br><br>
5.0 or 7.0 for 30 min. at 37 °C. Whereas native PA released 62% of the radiolabel from cells, equimolar mixture containing PA and PA-I showed insignificant release of 86Rb+. The results suggest that there is complete inhibition of channel forming ability of PA by PA-I (Figure 4). The capacity of PA-I to dramatically alter the channel forming ability of native PA provides evidence that these two species can interact to form dysfunctional hetero-oligomeric structures<br>
EXAMPLE 8:<br>
In vivo inhibition of anthrax toxin activity: Animal experiments were performed to test the efficacy of PA-I to act as a dominant negative inhibitor of lethal toxin action in vivo (that is in equimolar concentration with respect to native PA. Native lethal toxin (40 ug PA + 8 jag LF) resulted in the death of male Fischer 344 rats in approximately 60 min. (Table 1), whereas a 1:1 mix containing native PA and PA-I (40 ug PA + 40 ug PA-I + 8 ug LF) protected rats and no symptoms were evident even after 48 h. Equimolar ratio of native PA and PA-D resulted in the death of rats within 70 minutes.<br>

Advantages<br>
Main advantage of the invention is in providing a novel recombinant candidate molecule which is a dominant negative inhibitor which inhibitis anthrax toxin action, can be valuable for treatment of anthrax toxin action. Use of Bacillus anthracis as a bioweapon has become the bane of the defence establishments in various countries. The recombinant protein also has<br><br>
good potential for use as therapeutic agent for neutralizing anthrax toxin action in individuals infected with Bacillus anthracis. The invention also provides a method for inactivation of toxic activity of a toxin of the nature similar to that of anthrax toxin.<br>

Native PA plus the recombinant protein in equimolar ratio in combination with lethal factor (LF) thereby leading to complete inhibition of native toxin activity. Main utility of the invention is to develop a candidate molecule for anthrax toxin inhibition and for providing a method for inactivation of toxic activity of a toxin of the nature of anthrax toxin.
