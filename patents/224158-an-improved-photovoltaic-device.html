				<td>PHOTOVOLTAIC DEVICE<br>
The invention relates to a photovoltaic device with a front side exposed to a<br>
radiation and an opposite backside for convening radiation energy into electric<br>
energy with a coating unit<br>
Photovoltaic electric power generators are normally fixed and aligned to the<br>
direction of Incident primary sunlight. Occasionally, the systems have also been<br>
equipped w th a uniaxial or biaxial solar tracking unit, or sunlight concentrators<br>
have been used.<br>
In particular when using light concentrators, there is the problem that the<br>
attainable efficiency deteriorates at elevated temperatures of the photovoltaic<br>
device. The reason for that resides in that the electrons liberated by incident light<br>
photons are partially thermallv recombined so that the useful outer current flow of<br>
the photovoltaic module is reduced.<br>
This problem is solved in the prior art by providing on the backside of the<br>
photovoltaic modules, in like manner as in electric components, heat-conducting<br>
sheets to improve the heat emission.<br>
In the event of higher temperatures, the photovoltaic modules are activeiy cooled<br>
by conducting a coolant across the backside of the modules,<br>
The processes for active as well as passive heat dissipation are, however,<br>
structurally complex and thus only rarely applied.<br>
The invention is thus based on the object to so improve a photovoltaic device of<br>
this type as to exhibit a higher efficiency.<br>
The object is attained by providing the cooling unit with a liquid medium arranged<br>
between the front side and the radiation source.<br>
In order to prevent a reduction of radiation incident on the photovoltaic device, to<br>
date only cooling units have been proposed which are arranged on the backside<br>
of the photovoltaic device. The invention is based on the recognition that a<br>
cooling unit implemented with a liquid medium can also be arranged on the front<br>
side of the photovoltaic device. The liquid medium can hereby be so selected<br>
that the useful range of the solar spectrum for the photovoltaic effects is not, or<br>
only insignificantly absorbed by the liquid medium, while the radiation energy in<br>
the regions which are of secondary importance for the photovoltaic effects are<br>
absorbed by the liquid medium. The liquid medium thus permits passage of<br>
radiation energy useful for photovoltaic effects and absorbs the remaining<br>
radiation energy.<br>
It has been shown that liquids consisting substantially of water are particularly<br>
superior as liquid medium. Depending on the employed photovoltaic module, it is,<br>
however, also possible to use oils, alcohols or similar substances. These media<br>
are advantageously mixed with substances which optimize the filter characteristic<br>
in a solution or suspension.<br>
A simple photovoltaic device is attained by circulating the liquid medium between<br>
front side and radiation source as a result of differences in gravity between warm<br>
and cold medium. This arrangement known under the name thermosiphon<br>
includes a process water reservoir having a lower region with a cold water outlet.<br>
From here, cold water flows into the lower region of the photovoltaic device and<br>
rises within the photovoltaic device to its upper end from where the water flows<br>
back again to the reservoir. As warm water enters the reservoir at a higher<br>
location, a temperature gradient forms in the water reservoir, with cold water at<br>
the bottom and warmer water in the upper zone. Heated water can be withdrawn<br>
directly from the reservoir. Preferred however is the disposition of a process<br>
water heat exchanger in the reservoir to heat cold process water to the desired<br>
process water temperature.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment, the cooling unit includes a pumpjpr<br>
the liquid medium. This permits a flow of the liquid medium through the cooling<br>
unit to thereby continuously dissipate heat.<br>
Advantageously, the cooling unit includes a thermostat for controlling the pump.<br>
This enables a combination of a sufficient cooling with an effective warm water<br>
recovery. The temperature adjusted at the thermostat and the pump output are<br>
determined by the required warm water temperature and the demanded cooling<br>
action.<br>
Particularly good cooling actions can be realized when conducting the liquid<br>
medium directly across photovoltaic elements. The efficiency can be increased<br>
when conducting the liquid medium first across the backside and then across the<br>
front side of the photovoltaic device. The still cold medium is thereby heated on<br>
the backside of the device and absorbs further heat energy on the front side of<br>
the device. In this way, an effective cooling of the photovoltaic device is realized<br>
on the one hand, and a liquid medium at relatively high temperature is made<br>
available for further utilization.<br>
Further increase of the efficiency are implemented through several cooling units<br>
in parallel or serial relationship. A preferred embodiment provides for the<br>
arrangement of a further cooling unit at a distance to the front side. While this<br>
distanced cooling unit serves mainly as selective filter, a direct placement of the<br>
cooling unit on the photovoltaic modules allows at the same time filter effects and<br>
a cooling of the modules.<br>
Particular filter characteristics can be realized with the selection of the cooling<br>
medium. It has been shown as advantageous to arrange between the liquid<br>
medium and the radiation source a selective radiation-transparent layer. On the<br>
one hand, this selective radiation-transparent layer serves the conduction of the<br>
fluid, and, on the other hand, the combination of radiation-transparent layer and<br>
liquid medium produces a filter characteristic which is suited to the solar<br>
spectrum to be exploited for photovoltaic effects.<br>
It has been shown as advantageous to preferably coat the radiation-transparent<br>
layer on the side facing the radiation source in selective areas radiation-<br>
transparent. The selection of different coating materials and processes, too, has<br>
an impact on the filter characteristic to attain an optimal characteristic curve of<br>
the filter in a positive manner.<br>
Extensive series of tests have shown that a plate or a film of a fluoropoiymer as<br>
radiation-transparent layer yields particularly good results. Especially, films of<br>
fluoropoiymer are good for manufacture and useful for conduction of liquid<br>
coolant and as radiation filter. Good results have also been realized with acryl,<br>
polycarbonate and glass because these materials offer a high transparency in<br>
the incident spectrum and are mechanically stable as well as weather-resistant<br>
and waterproof. This can be implemented in a cost-efficient manner, for example,<br>
with double webbed acryl (PMMA) plates and double webbed polycarbonate<br>
plates.<br>
Advantageously, the radiation-transparent layer forms an envelope which<br>
surrounds the liquid medium. This envelope thus represents a closed component<br>
which is usable as filter and can easily be exchanged.<br>
The various described embodiments are applicable for non-concentrated as well<br>
as for concentrated radiation.<br>
Explanations and exemplified embodiments of the described invention are<br>
illustrated in the drawing and will be explained in detail hereinafter.<br>
It is shown in<br>
Fig. 1 the relative intensity of the solar spectrum over the wavelength and the<br>
transparency of a water layer of a thickness of 5 cm and a fluoropolymer<br>
film of a thickness of 100 microns over the wavelength,<br>
Fig. 2 a single layer photovoltaic device,<br>
Fig. 3 a cutaway view of a photovoltaic module,<br>
Fig. 4 the temperature distribution over the layer thickness of the photovoltaic<br>
module shown in Fig. 3,<br>
Fig. 5 a double-layer photovoltaic device and<br>
Fig. 6 a double-layer photovoltaic device with concentrator and pre-cooler.<br>
Fig. 1 shows on the left ordinate 1 the relative intensity, on the right ordinate 2<br>
the radiation transparency x in percent and on the abscise 3 the wavelength in<br>
nanometer. Plotted in this coordinate system are the solar spectrum 4 and the<br>
area 5 of this spectrum 4, useful for photovoltaic effects. The transmission of a<br>
water layer of a thickness of 5 cm is elucidated by line 6, and line 7 shows the<br>
transmission of a fluoropolymer film of a thickness of 100 microns.<br>
This illustration shows that the 5 cm thick water layer allows passage of almost<br>
the entire radiation of the spectral range useful for photovoltaic effects and<br>
absorbs only the longer wave radiation. The film allows almost unaltered<br>
passage of the radiation across the entire spectral region and absorbs a portion<br>
of the radiation only in the short-wave range. A photovoltaic module disposed<br>
beneath the water layer is thus exposed to nearly the entire radiation useful for<br>
photovoltaic effects whereas the longer wave radiation is absorbed by the water<br>
layer and leads to a heating of the water.<br>
This effect is utilized in the photovoltaic device shown in Fig. 2. Hereby, a water<br>
layer 11 flows across the photovoltaic module 10 which is thus cooled. The water<br>
layer 11 is enveloped by a transparent film 12 so that water is directed into this<br>
film 12. A pump 13 pumps the water from a reservoir (not shown) through the<br>
photovoltaic device 14 to a reservoir 15 from which water can be withdrawn from<br>
outlet 17 in controlled doses via the valve 16. The heating coil 18 permits a after-<br>
heating of the water, when the heating of water generated by the photovoltaic<br>
device is not sufficient.<br>
Disposed at the photovoltaic device 14 is a temperature probe 19 which controls<br>
the pump 13 in such a manner that heated fluid is pumped into the reservoir 15<br>
and fresh, cool fluid flows into the arrangement, whenever the temperature probe<br>
19 has reached a defined, adjustable limit temperature.<br>
The described filter 11, 12 is selective as it permits passage of radiation of only<br>
certain wavelength. It is, however, also recuperative because it recovers<br>
recuperatively the heat flow occurring on the surface of the photovoltaic<br>
module 10 by means of essentially two mechanisms. On the one hand, this is the<br>
heat exchange realized by the direct contact of the fluid with the hot surface of<br>
the module. On the other hand, the module surface radiates with a radiation<br>
sninea according to the Wien's displacement law in dependence on the<br>
temperature to the long wave range. This radiation is absorbed in accordance<br>
with the invention by the filter fluid, the water, and converted into heat.<br>
During cooling in accordance with the present invention, the long wave photons<br>
which cannot trigger a photo effect are converted into heat already before<br>
reaching the module, whereas in conventional photovoltaic devices they are<br>
absorbed in the module and the generated heat flux must be withdrawn through<br>
the module. The advantage of the photovoltaic device according to the invention<br>
thus resides in the particular intense exposure of the uppermost layer, i.e. the<br>
side facing the radiation, to a cooling action. This is especially relevant because<br>
in a photovoltaic module - as shown in Fig. 3 - the light quanta 20 of the<br>
radiation 21 are absorbed in the uppermost layer 22 of the photovoltaic<br>
module 23 of the layer thickness d so that a temperature gradient is created, as<br>
indicated in Fig. 4 by line 24. The line 24 shows the linear temperature profile<br>
between the bottom side 25 of the photovoltaic module 23 with the<br>
temperature Tu and the top side 26 of the photovoltaic module 23 with the<br>
temperature T0 This representation again clearly shows that the front side<br>
cooling according to the invention of the module is especially advantageous<br>
because it acts directly on the hottest surface of the module 23.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a further development of the photovoltaic device shown in Fig. 2. In<br>
this photovoltaic device 30, a first fluid layer 32 flows across the radiation-distal<br>
side of the photovoltaic module 31 and a second fluid layer 33 flows across the<br>
radiation-proximal side. A pump 34 transports a water stream 35 along the<br>
backside 36 of the photovoltaic module 31 in the first layer 32, and the water<br>
cools hereby the backside of the photovoltaic module 31. A deflection device 37<br>
guides the water stream 35 at the lower end of the photovoltaic module 31<br>
around the module to the upper side 38 where it flows in the second layer 33<br>
along the upper side 38 upwards. Water further heated on the front side then<br>
flows in a reservoir 39 and from there via a valve 40 to the outlet 41.<br>
The water-carrying layer 32 on the backside may either be a coiled pipe of<br>
suitable geometry in good heat contact with the backside, or a whole-area plate<br>
heat exchanger. To minimize heat losses to the outside, the entire arrangement<br>
is supplemented by an opaque heat insulation 42 as well as second transparent<br>
covering 43. The second transparent covering 43 is arranged at a distance to the<br>
transparent fluoropolymer film 44. The control 45 permits a desired<br>
adjustment of the temperature increase of the cooling fluid. The temperature<br>
desired at outlet 17 depends on the application at hand, and may lie at 30 °C, for<br>
example for a swimming pool heater, while shower water requires about 40 °C.<br>
Both these typical types of use of solar-heated warm water find application in<br>
moderate latitudes in particular during the summer half-year. As the mean<br>
photovoltaic module temperature during this season lies above 50 °C, the system<br>
according to the invention provides not only for electric power and warm water<br>
but also increases at the same time the power efficiency.<br>
According to the invention, a surface element which to date was able to generate<br>
electric power at about 10% efficiency from the available radiation can be used to<br>
make a module which generates current and warm water at an overall efficiency<br>
of about 60%.<br>
Fig. 6 shows that the system according to the invention is basically applicable<br>
also for photovoltaic arrangements with sunlight concentration. Especially in<br>
cases of increased energy density on the surface of the module, the described,<br>
favorable selective and recuperative heat extraction mechanisms have an even<br>
stronger impact.<br>
When using a photovoltaic device, shown in Fig. 5, for concentrated radiation,<br>
the energy content of the long wave, photovoltaically non-useful part of the solar<br>
spectrum is used to heat water to a relative low temperature. When the coolant<br>
stream is heated to higher temperatures, the efficiency of the photovoltaic<br><br>
module is decreased.<br>
Thus, the photovoltaic device, shown in Fig. 6, is proposed for concentrated<br>
radiation. This photovoltaic device 50 includes essentially the concentrator lens<br>
51, the pre-cooler 52 and the cooled photovoltaic element 53. The concentrator<br>
lens 51 may also be replaced by a different concentrator optics, such as, for<br>
example, a mirror system. The photovoltaic module 53 has a configuration which<br>
corresponds to the photovoltaic device 30 shown in Fig. 5. The pre-cooler 52<br>
serves as pre-filter which includes in case of a linear concentrator a transparent<br>
cuboid of the dimension of the focal line at this location. In case of spot-like<br>
concentrator, a transparent flat hollow cylinder is used of the dimension of the<br>
focal sport at this location.<br>
A fluid flows through the hollow cuboids or hollow cylinders 54 and has besides<br>
the selectivity, illustrated in Fig. 1, a boiling point which is as high as possible so<br>
that the system pressure remains low. In the case at hand, water is used with<br>
respective additives. This water is heated in the hollow cuboid or hollow cylinder<br>
54 by the radiation 55 concentrated by the lens 51 to temperatures in the range<br>
of about 100 °C. When the predetermined temperature has been reached, the<br>
temperature probe 56 acts on the pump 57 so that a new fluid stream can be<br>
pumped into the cavity 54. As a consequence, very high temperatures are<br>
generated in the focal spot of the lens 51 and used for heating of a selectively<br>
radiation-transparent fluid.<br>
The device 50 is thus capable to produce electric power 60, process water heat<br>
61 and high-temperature process heat 62 from primary incident energy 59. The<br>
energy of the high-temperature heat may hereby be converted, for example via<br>
suitable thermodynamic machines, into mechanical work or additional electric<br>
power.<br>
The quantity of warm water produced at the photovoltaic devices 53 may,<br>
however, further heated in the pre-filter 52 by making a connection between the<br>
line end 61 and the pump 57.<br>
The described photovoltaic devices are based on the correct selection of the fluid<br>
and the transparent material for the sheathing. In the area of the liquid, there are<br>
many options ranging from water via oils, alcohols etc.. As photovoltaic modules<br>
of different configuration (e.g. silicon, GaAs, ZnS etc.) can be used, the selective<br>
filter must be matched to the respectively required photovoltaically active spectral<br>
region. This matching is, optionally, realized in a relative precise manner through<br>
filter characteristic curves of the transparent sheathing materials and/or liquids.<br>
The filter properties can be varied by selectively coating the enveloping materials<br>
themselves and admixing additives to the liquids.<br>
In the described exemplified applications, a commercially available fluoropolymer<br>
film of a thickness of 100 microns was used. This film is chemically inert,<br>
environmentally neutral and is flexible to process. Care should be taken, when<br>
using films, that a suitable mechanical support or channel-like subdivision of the<br>
water-carrying layer is used to prevent a pillow-shaped bulging in order to form a<br>
relatively even thickness of the water layer across the entire area.<br>
Photovoltaic elements are normally covered on their surface with a glass sheet or<br>
plastic sheet in order to protect the active photovoltaic area against mechanical<br>
impacts. When using a sheathing for conducting liquids, which bears upon the<br>
active photovoltaic area, the use of a further covering of the photovoltaic<br>
elements may be omitted as the water conducting elements assume the function<br>
of a protective surface. For example, so-called dual web plates can be used to<br>
guide the liquid upon the photovoltaic elements and to protect the photovoltaic<br>
elements at the same time. Of course, conventionally used glass plates may also<br>
be provided with liquid-pervious channels which extend in the plate plane, or may<br>
allow as double plate a liquid-guiding layer.<br>
In the described exemplified embodiments, water was used as selective fluid.<br>
Water is cheap and environmentally neutral. When using additives for water, the<br>
use of a heat exchanger is required for generating process water. The<br>
temperatures of the produced amount of warm water may, however, be so set<br>
that water without additives can be used. As a consequence, the use of a heat<br>
exchanger may be omitted.<br>
