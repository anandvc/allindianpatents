The invention relates to mobile phone in particular. The invention relates to the incorporation of CD ( Compact Disc ) player with recorder and a radio also. The object of the invention is to incorporate the facility of CD ( Compact Disc ) player with recorder to watch the videos, to hear the audios and also to record the memories, online functions, external inputs etc.,. and to incorporate a radio also to hear the audio in the mobile phone. The CD player with recorder of the mobile phone can be designed suitably and it can be of a small size, and be incorporated in any convenient part for the operations of the user. The Compact Disc should be designed suitably and CD can be small size which should be accepted by the CD player with recorder. The CD player with recorder can be VCD, DVD, MPS etc.,. The idea of using CD player with recorder to watch the videos, to hear the audios and also to record the memories, online functions, external inputs etc.,. in the mobile phone is thought of by the inventor for the first time and such a novel concept is no where knovra. In order to incorporate this principle there is a need for technological changes in the existing mobile phone. Therefore the entire circuitry of the known mobile phone is changed.<br>
It is primary object of invention to invent a mobile phone which incorporates CD player with recorder and a radio also.<br>
It is another object of invention to invent a mobile phone which incorporates CD player with recorder and a radio also which incorporate novel technology.<br>
The specialty of the invention is the incorporation of facility of CD player with recorder to watch the videos, to hear the audios and also to record the memories, online functions, external inputs etc.,. and to incorporate a radio also to hear the audio in the mobile phone.<br><br>
Now the invention is clear from the following description. The nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed clearly and fully described in the following pages of description.<br>
The salient features of the invention is described in detail with reference to various figures showing essential aspects of the invention. Each figure of the drawing illustrates certain features which are as follow,<br>
Fig. 1 show the block diagram of CD player with recorder and a radio also in the mobile phone.<br>
Fig. 2 ( a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h5i,j ) shows in detail provisions for arranging CD player with recorder in the mobile phone.<br>
The mobile phone contains CD player with recorder, Radio, CPU, Memory, LCD, Keyboard and RF as shown in fig. 1. The CD player with recorder is connected to the Cental Processing Unit ( CPU ). The CD player with recorder can be VCD, DVD, MPS etc.,. The CPU that sends / receives of commands / signals for the CD player with recorder. The CPU is used to control the operation of the device. The CPU has several input and output pins for the CD player with recorder functions. The CPU send the commands to operate the CD player with recorder. The CPU sends the data to be stored in the compact disc.<br>
The memories viz. inbox, outbox, phone numbers, video and audio etc.,. which are in the memory IC can be recorded or copied to the compact disc. The live online functions viz. video camera recording, camera shots, television program, voice recording and e-mail etc.,. can be directly recorded or copied in the compact disc. The external inputs viz. memories that are in other<br><br>
mobile phones, all programmes of televisions, the data or files from computers etc.,. can be copied or recorded to the compact disc through socket or interface. The external inputs viz. memories from other mobile phones can be copied or recorded through interface or infrared. The Memory is connected to the CPU and the memory can read and write messages and for storing information. The memory capacity of the compact disc which is reading the data, files in the compact disc and also write or record the programmes, messages etc.,. should be sufficient. The CD player with recorder are designed to read and write huge memories in the compact disc and it is also named eg: MPCD which can be incorporated in the mobile phone. The LCD is connected to the CPU for display the characters, messages and pictures. The output of the CD player with recorder can be watched on the LCD display of the mobile phone and also can be watched on the television, computer etc.,. through socket or interface. The operation of the CD player with recorder is provided by appropriate keys in the mobile phone. The Keyboard is connected to the CPU ( Central Processing Unit) for inputting data's like letters, numbers, and commands. The CD player with recorder commands viz. slow, still, pause, forward, reverse, play, stop, record etc.,. can be operated by appropriate keys in the mobile phone. The Transreceivers ( RF ) are designed, suitable for transreceiving the mobile signals and radio signals. The suitable power supply for the operation of the CD player with recorder and radio is obtained from the battery of the mobile phone.<br>
The radio can be FM, AM etc.,. Either the audio of the radio or the audio of the mobile phone can be heard through the speaker and / or the headphones of the mobile phone.<br>
A facility of switching circuit is arranged inside the earphone socket of the mobile phone to hear the audio of the radio or the audio of the mobile phone through the speaker and the headphone at a time in a mobile phone.<br><br>
A suitably designed stereo loudspeaker system having woofer speaker is used for amplifying the audio of the radio, video, telephone call etc.,. in the mobile phone. The said loudspeaker has a plurality of speaker.<br>
The CD player with recorder of the mobile phone can be designed suitably and it can be of a small size, and be incorporated in any convenient part for the operations of the user. The Compact Disc should be suitably designed and CD can be small size which should be accepted by the CD player with recorder. The Compact Disc can be inserted in the CD player with recorder by open / close door type (lid) or disc receiving type.<br>
The CD (Compact disc) can be fixed / arranged, which may be a door type (lid ) or a disc receiving type, on the rear side of the upper part of the mobile phone as shown in fig. 2 (a,b).<br>
