				<td>DESCRIPTION DIAMINE DERIVATIVES<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to novel compounds which inhibit activated blood coagulation factor X (hereinafter abbreviated as "FXa") to exhibit a potent anticoagulant effect and can be orally administered, and anticoagulants or agents for preventing and/or treating thrombosis or embolism, which comprise such a novel compound as an active ingredient.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Hypercoagulable state is one of the pivotal factors that account for unstable angina, cerebral infarction, cerebral embolism, myocardial infarction, pulmonary infarction, pulmonary embolism, Buerger's disease, deep venous thrombosis,-disseminated intravascular coagulation syndrome, thrombus formation after artificial valve replacement, reocclusion after angioplasty and thrombus formation during extracorporeal circulation. Therefore, there is a demand for development of excellent anticoagulants which have good dose responsiveness, long duration, low risk of hemorrhage and little side effects and fast onset of sufficient effects even by oral administration (Thrombosis Research, Vol. 68, pp. 507-512, 1992).<br>
Based on the research of anticoagulants worked through<br><br>
various mechanism of action, it is suggested that FXa inhibitors are promising anticoagulants. A blood coagulation system comprises a series of reactions in which a great amount of thrombin is produced through an amplification process by multi-stage enzyme reactions to form insoluble fibrin. In an endogenous system, activated factor IX activates factor X on a phospholipid membrane in the presence of activated factor VIII and calcium ions after multi-stage reactions subsequent to activation of a contact factor. In an exogenous system, activated factor VII activates factor X in the presence of a tissue factor. More specifically, the activation of the factor X into FXa in the coagulation system is a crucial reaction in the formation of thrombin. The activated factor X (FXa) limitedly decomposes prothrombin to produce thrombin in the both systems. Since the produced thrombin activates coagulation factors in the upper stream, the formation of thrombin is further amplified. As described above, the coagulation system in the upper stream of FXa is divided into the endogenous system and the exogenous system, thus production of FXa cannot be sufficiently suppressed by inhibiting the enzymes involved in the coagulation system in the upper stream of FXa, leading to production of thrombin. Since the coagulation system comprises self-amplification reactions, inhibition of the coagulation system can be more efficiently achieved by inhibiting FXa in the upper stream of thrombin than the inhibition of the product; namely, thrombin (Thrombosis Research, Vol. 15,  pp. 617-629, 1979). Another<br>
excellent point of FXa inhibitors is a great difference between an effective dose in a thrombosis model and a dose which allows elongation of bleeding time in an experimental hemorrhagic model. From this experimental result, FXa inhibitors are considered to be anticoagulants having low risk of hemorrhage.<br>
Various compounds have been reported as FXa inhibitors. It is generally known that antithrombin III and antithrombin III dependent pentasacchrides can not inhibit prothrombinase complexes which play a practical role in the thrombus formation in a living body (Thrombosis Research, Vol. 68, pp. 507-512, 1992; Journal of Clinical Investigation, Vol. 71, pp, 1383-1389, 1983; Mebio, Vol. 14, the August number, pp. 92-97). In addition, they do not exhibit effectiveness by oral administration. Tick anticoagulant peptide (TAP) (Science, Vol. 248, pp. 593-596, 1990) and antistasin (AST) (Journal of Biological Chemistry, Vol. 263, pp. 10162-10167, 1988) isolated from mites or leeches, which are bloodsuckers, also inhibit Fxa and exhibit anti-thrombotic effects against venous thrombosis and arterial thrombosis. However, these compounds are high-molecular weight peptides and are not effective by oral administration. As described above, development of antithrombin III independent low-molecular weight FXa inhibitors which directly inhibit coagulation factors and which can be orally administered has been conducted.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a novel compound which has a potent FXa-inhibiting effect and exhibits an anti-thrombotic effect quickly, sufficiently and persistently by oral administration.<br>
The present inventors have investigated synthesis and pharmacological effects of novel FXa inhibitors. As a result, diamine derivatives, salts thereof, and solvates and N-oxides thereof, which exhibit potent FXa-inhibiting effect and anticoagulant effect, have been found. It has also been found that these compounds promptly, persistently and potently inhibit FXa and exhibit potent anticoagulant effect and anti-thrombotic effect by oral administration, and are hence useful as prophylactics and remedies for various diseases based on thromboembolism, thus leading to completion of the present invention.<br>

The preparation process of the diamine derivatives (1) according to the present invention will hereinafter be described. [Preparation Process 1]<br>
A compound represented by the general formula (1), a salt thereof, a solvate thereof, or an N-oxide thereof can be prepared in accordance with, for example, the following process:<br>
wherein Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, R1 and R2 have the same meanings as defined above, and T1 represents a carbonyl group.<br>
A mixed acid anhydride, acid halide, activated ester or the like, which is derived from carboxylic acid (3), may react with diamine (2), giving compound (4). The resultant compound (4) may react with carboxylic acid (5) under the same conditions, giving compound (1) according to the present invention.  In the above reaction steps, reagents and conditions, which are generally used in peptide synthesis, may be applied. The mixed acid anhydride can be prepared by, for example, reaction of a chloroformate such as ethyl chloroformate or isobutyl chloroformate with carboxylic acid (3) in the presence of a base. The acid halide can be prepared by treating carboxylic acid (3) with an acid halide such as thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride. The activated ester includes various kinds of esters. Such an ester can be prepared by, for example, reaction of a phenol such as p-nitrophenol, N-hydroxybenzotriazole, or N-hydroxysuccinimide with carboxylic acid (3) using a condensing agent such as N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide or l-ethyl-3-(3-<br>
dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride. The activated ester can also be prepared by reaction of carboxylic acid (3) with pentafluorophenyl trifluoroacetate or the like, reaction of carboxylic acid (3) with I-benzotriazolyloxytripyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphite, reaction of carboxylic acid (3) with diethyl cyanophosphonate (Shioiri method), reaction of carboxylic acid (3) with triphenylphosphine and 2,2'-dipyridyl disulfide (Mukaiyama method) or the like. The thus-obtained mixed acid anhydride, acid halide or activated ester of carboxylic acid (3) may react with diamine (2) at -78°C to 150°C in the presence of a proper base in an inert solvent, giving compound (4). Thus-obtained compound (4) may react with a mixed acid anhydride, acid halide or activated ester of carboxylic acid (5) under the same conditions, giving compound (1) according to the present invention. The reagents and reaction conditions in the reaction of compound (4) with carboxylic acid (5) are the same as those in the reaction of diamine (2) with carboxylic acid (3).<br>
As specific examples of the base used in each of the above mentioned steps, may be carbonates of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as sodium carbonate and potassium carbonate, alkali metal alkoxides such as sodium ethoxide and potassium butoxide, alkali metal hydroxides such as sodium hydroxide and potassium hydroxide, and hydrides of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals, such as sodium hydride and potassium hydride; organic metal bases exemplified by<br>
alkyllithium such as n-butyllithium, and dialkylaminolithium such as lithium diisopropylamide; organic metal bases exemplified by bis(silyl)amine, such as lithium bis(trimethylsilyl)amide; and organic bases such as pyridine, 2,6-lutidine, collidine, 4-dimethylaminopyridine, triethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, diisopropylethylamine and diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene (DBU).<br>
Examples of the inert solvent used in this reaction include alkyl halide type solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform and carbon tetrachloride, etheric solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, 1,2-dimethoxyethane and dioxane, aromatic solvents such as benzene and toluene, and amide solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide, N,N-dimethylacetamide and N-methylpyrrolidin-2-one.  In addition to these solvent, a sulfoxide solvent such as dimethyl sulfoxide or sulfolane, a ketone solvent such as acetone or methyl ethyl ketone, or the like may be used in some cases. [Preparation Process 2]<br>
Compound (1) according to the present invention can also be prepared in accordance with the following process:<br>
wherein Q1, Q2, Q3, Q4, R1 and R2 have the same meanings as defined above, T1 represents a carbonyl group, Boc represents a tert-butoxycarbonyl group, and Boc-ON represents 2-(tert-butoxycarbonyloxyimino)-2-phenylacetonitrile.<br>
As described above, diamine (2) is treated with Boc-ON (6) to prepare compound (7) in which one of 2 amino groups has been protected with tert-butoxycarbonyl group. The resultant compound (7) reacts with carboxylic acid (5) and affords compound (8). Compound (8) is successively treated with an acid to give compound (9) . Compound (9) then reacts with the carboxylic acid (3), giving compound (1) according to the present invention. Compound (7) can be prepared by a<br>
reaction at -10°C to 40°C in the presence of triethylamine in a solvent such as dichloromethane. Reaction of compound (7) with the mixed acid anhydride, acid halide or activated ester of the carboxylic acid (5) is carried out using the same reagents and reaction conditions as those described in<br>
Preparation Process 1, whereby compound (8) can be prepared. The resultant compound (8) is treated with trifluoroacetic<br>
acid or the like at -20°C to 70°C, whereby amine (9) can be prepared.  In the reaction of the resultant amine (9) with carboxylic acid (3), the same reagents and conditions as those described in Preparation Process 1 may be used.<br>
By the way, the tert-butoxycarbonyl group of compound (7) may be replaced by other amino-protecting groups.  In this case, reagent (6) is also changed to other reagents, and reaction conditions and the like according to the reagents must be used. As examples of other protecting groups for amino groups, may be mentioned alkanoyl groups such as an acetyl group, alkoxycarbonyl groups such as methoxycarbonyl and ethoxycarbonyl groups, arylmethoxycarbonyl groups such as benzyloxycarbonyl, p-methoxybenzyloxycarbonyl and p- or o-nitrobenzyloxycarbonyl groups, arylmethyl groups such as benzyl and triphenylmethyl groups, aroyl groups such as a benzoyl group, and arylsulfonyl groups such as 2,4-dinitrobenzenesulfonyl and o-nitrobenzenesulfonyl groups. These protecting groups may be chosen for use according to the nature and the like of the compound of which amino group is to be protected. Upon leaving such a protecting group, reagents and conditions may be employed according to the protecting group. [Preparation Process 3]<br>
Compound (1) according to the present invention can be prepared by reacting diamine (2) with sulfonyl halide (10)<br>
and then condensing the  reaction product with carboxylic  acid (5) .<br>
wherein Q1, Q2, Q3, QA, R1 and R2 have the same meanings as defined above, T1 represents a sulfonyl group, and X represents a halogen atom.<br>
Diamine (2) reacts with sulfonyl halide (10) at -10°C to 30°C in the presence of a base such as triethylamine in an inert solvent, giving compound (4).
