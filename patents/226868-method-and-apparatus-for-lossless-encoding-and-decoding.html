METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR LOSSLESS ENCODING AND<br>
DECODING<br>
Technical Field<br>
[1 ]	Apparatuses and methods consistent with the present invention relate to encoding<br>
and decoding of moving picture data, and more particularly, to a lossless moving<br>
picture encoding and decoding by which when intra prediction is performed for a block of a predetermined size, by using a pixel in (he block to be predicted, a compression ratio is increased.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	According to the H.264 standard set up for encoding and decoding moving picture<br>
data, a frame includes a plurality of macroblocks, and encoding and decoding arc performed in units of macroblocks, or in units of sub blocks which arc obtained by dividing a macroblock into two or four units. There are two methods of predicting the motion of a macroblock of a current frame to be encoded: temporal prediction which draws reference from macroblocks of an adjacent frame, and spatial prediction which draws reference from an adjacent macroblock.<br>
[3]	Spatial prediction is also referred to as intra prediction. Intra prediction is based on<br>
the characteristic that when a pixel is predicted, an adjacent pixel is most likely to have a most similar value.<br>
|4]	Meanwhile, encoding can be broken down into lossy encoding and lossless<br>
encoding. In order to perform lossless encoding of moving pictures, a predicted pixel value calculated by motion prediction is subtracted from a current pixel value. Then, without discrete cosine transform (DCT) or quantization, entropy coding is performed and (he result is output.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[5]	In the conventional method, when lossless encoding is performed, each pixel value<br>
in a block to be predicted is predicted by using a pixel value of a block adjacent to the block to be predicted, and therefore the compression ratio is much lower than that of lossy encoding.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[6]	The present invention provides a lossless moving picture encoding and decoding<br>
method and apparatus by which when intra prediction of a block with a predetermined<br>
size is performed, the compression ratio is increased by using a pixel in a block to be predicted.<br><br>

picture encoding method including: predicting each of pixel values in an M x N block<br>
to be predicted by using a pixel in the MxN block closest to the pixel value in a<br>
prediction direction determined by an encoding mode: and entropy coding a difference<br>
between (he predicted pixel value and the pixel value to be predicted.<br>
[8]	When the block to be predicted is a luminance block or a G block, the M x N block<br>
may be any one of a 4 x 4 block, an 8 x"8 block, and a 16 x 16 block, and when it is any one of a chrominance block, an R block, and a B block, (he M x N block may be an 8 x 8 block.<br>

Horizontal mode, DC mode, Diagonal_Down_Lcft, Diagonal_Down_Righl, Vertical_Right, Horizontal_Down, Vertical_Left, and Horizontal_Up, which arc H.264 intra 4x4 luminance encoding modes.<br>
[10]	For any one of a chrominance block, an R block and a B block, the encoding modes<br>
may be Vertical mode, Horizonlal mode, and DC mode, which arc H.264 intra MxN chrominance encoding modes.<br>
[11]	According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a lossless<br>
moving picture decoding method including: receiving a bitstream obtained by performing entropy coding based on prediction values, each predicted by using a closest pixel in a prediction direction determined according to an encoding mode, in an MxN block which is a prediction block unit; entropy decoding the bitstream; and losslessly restoring an original image according to the decoded values.<br>
[l2]	According lo still another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
lossless moving picture encoding apparatus including: a motion prediction unit which<br>
predicts each of pixel values in an M x N block (o be predicted by using a pixel in Ihc<br>
MxN block closest lo the pixel value in a prediction direction determined by an<br>
encoding mode; and an entropy coding unit which performs entropy coding on a<br>
difference between Ihe predicted pixel value and the pixel value to be predicted.<br>

mode, in an M x N block which is a prediction block unit, and performs entropy<br>
decoding on the bilslream; and a moving picture restoration unil which losslessly<br>
restores an original image according lo the decoded values.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>

particular, when only intra prediction mode is used, the compression ratio is much<br><br>

higher than in the conventional method.<br>

[33]	In order lo explain exemplary embodiments of the present invention, first, defining<br>
a prediction value and a residual value will now be explained.<br><br>

WO 2005/122592	PCT/KR2OO5/001683<br>
[34]	Assuming that the position of a pixel on the top left comer is x=0, y=0, p[x. y|<br>
indicates a pixel value on a relative position (x, y). For example, in FIG. 3A, the position of pixel a is expressed as |0, 0|, the position of pixel b is as |1, 0|, the position of pixel c is as |2, 0|, (he position of pixel d is as |3, 0|, and the position of pixel c is as [0, 1|. The positions of the remaining pixels f through p can be expressed in the same manner.<br>
[35]	A prediction value when a pixel is predicted by the original H.264 method without<br>
modifying the prediction method is expressed as predL| x, y |. For example, the prediction value of pixel a in FIG. 3A is expressed as predL|0, 0|. In the same manner, the prediction value of pixel b is predL|1, 0|, the prediction value of pixel c is predL[2, 0], the prediction value of pixel d is predL|3, 0], and the prediction value of pixel e is predL|0, 1|. The prediction values of the remaining pixels f through p can be expressed in the same manner.<br>
[36]	A prediction value when a pixel is predicted from adjacent pixels according to the<br>
present invention is expressed as predL|x, y |. The position of a pixel is expressed in the same manner as in predL[x, y]. The residual value of position (i, j) obtained by subtracting the pixel prediction value at position (i, j) from the pixel value at position (i, j) is expressed as rij . The pixel value of position (i, j) restored by adding the pixel prediction value at position (i, j) and the residual value at position (i, j) when decoding is performed, is expressed as u .<br>
[37]	The present invention will now be described more fully with reference to the ac-<br>
companying drawings, in which exemplary embodiments of the invention are shown.<br>
[38]	Referring to FIG. 1 showing an encoding apparatus according to an exemplary<br>
embodiment of the present invention, if an image is input, motion prediction is performed. In the present invention, pixels of a luminance block and a G block are obtained by performing 4x4 intra prediction and pixels of a chrominance block, an R block, and a B block arc obtained by performing 8x8 intra prediction. Accordingly, a motion prediction unit 110 performs 4x4 intra prediction for pixels of a luminance block and a G block in a macroblock to be predicted and 8x8 intra prediction for pixels of a chrominance block, an R block, and a B block. Calculation of predicted pixel values when 4x4 intra prediction and 8x8 intra prediction are performed will be explained later. A mode selection unit 120 selects one optimum mode among a variety of prediction modes. That is, when 4x4 intra prediction and 8x8 intra prediction are performed, one mode is selected from among a plurality of available encoding modes. Generally, one mode is selected according to a rate-distortion (RD) optimization method which minimizes rate-distortion. Since (here is no distortion in the lossless encoding of the present invention, one encoding mode is determined through optimization of rates.<br><br>
WO 2005/122592	PCT/KR2005/001683<br>
[39]	An entropy coding unit 130 entropy-codes a difference value output from the<br>
motion prediction unit 110, that is, the difference between a pixel value in a macroblock of a current frame desired to be encoded and a predicted pixel value, and outputs (he result. Entropy coding means a coding method by which less bits arc assigned to more frequent data and more bits arc assigned to less frequent data such that the compression ratio of data is increased. The entropy coding methods used in the present invention include context adaptive variable length coding (CAVLC), and context-based adaptive binary arithmetic coding (CABAC).<br>
Mode for Invention<br>
[40]<br>
[41]	FIG. 2 is a diagram showing intra prediction modes for a 4 x 4 block in H.264.<br>
[42]	Intra prediction of pixels in a luminance block and a G block is performed in units<br>
of 4 x 4 blocks. There are nine types of 4 x 4 intra prediction modes corresponding to different prediction directions, including: Vertical mode (mode 0), Horizontal mode (mode 1), DC mode (mode 2), Diagonal_Down_Left (mode 3), Diagonal_Down_Righl (mode 4), Verlical_Righ( (mode 5), Horizontal_Down (mode 6), Vcrtical_Lefl (mode 7), and Horizonlal_Up (mode 8). The arrows in FIG. 2 indicate prediction directions. Calculation of a pixel in each mode will now be explained in more detail.<br>
[43]	FIG. 3A illustrates pixel prediction of a luminance block and a G block in Vertical<br>
mode (mode 0).<br>
[44]	Pixel a 302 is predicted from pixel A, which is an adjacent pixel in the vertical<br>
direction, and pixel c 304 is predicted not from pixel A adjacent to the block 300 to be predicted but from pixel a 302 which is adjacent to pixel e 304 in the block 300. Also, pixel i 306 is predicted from pixel c 304 and pixel m 308 is predicted from pixel i 306.<br>
|45]	In (he same manner, pixel b is predicted from pixel B, pixel f from pixel b, pixel j<br>
from pixel f, pixel n from pixel j, pixel c from pixel C, pixel g from pixel c, pixel k from pixel g, pixel o from pixel k, pixel d from pixel D, pixel h from pixel d, pixel 1 from pixel h, and pixel p from pixel 1. Here, prediction means to output the difference (residual value) of pixel values and (o entropy code (he difference. That is, for pixels a, e, i, and m in the block 300 to be predicted, residual values (a - A), (e - a), (i - e), and (m - i), are output and entropy coded, respectively. The pixel prediction method in Vertical mode (mode 0) can be expressed as the following equation: <br>
[46]<br>
preri4x4L.[x,y] = p[x-1 ,y], x, y = 0, ..., 3<br>

Horizontal mode (mode 1).<br>
[48]	Pixel a 312 is predicted from pixel 1, which is an adjacent pixel in the horizontal<br>
direction, and pixel h 314 is predicted not from pixel 1 adjacent to the block 300 to be predicted but from pixel a 312 which is adjacent to pixel b 314 in the block 300. Also, pixel c 316 is predicted from pixel h 314 and pixel d 318 is predicted from pixel c 316.<br>
[49]	In the same manner, pixel c is predicted from pixel J, pixel f from pixel c, pixel g<br>
from pixel f, pixel h from pixel g, pixel i from pixel K, pixel j from pixel i, pixel k from pixel j, pixel 1 from pixel k, pixel m from pixel L, pixel n from pixel m, pixel o from pixel n, and pixel p from pixel o. The pixel prediction method in Horizontal mode (mode 1) can be expressed as the following equation:<br>
[50]<br>
pred4x4L•[x,y] = p[x-1 ,y], x, y = 0, ..., 3<br>
|5l]	FIG. 3C illustrates pixel prediction of a luminance block and a G block in<br>
Diagonal_Down_Left mode (mode 3).<br>
[52]	Pixel a 322 is predicted from pixel B that is an adjacent pixel in the diagonal<br>
direction indicated by an arrow in FIG. 3C, and pixel e 324 is predicted from pixel b that is a pixel adjacent to pixel e 324 in the arrow direction in the block 300. Also, pixel i 326 is predicted from pixel f and pixel m 328 is predicted from pixel j.<br>
|53]	In this manner, pixel b is predicted from pixel C, pixel c from pixel D, pixel d from<br>
pixel E, pixel f from pixel c, pixel g from pixel d, pixel h from pixel d, pixel j from pixel g, pixel k from pixel h, pixel 1 from pixel h, pixel n is from pixel k, pixel o from pixel 1, and pixel p from pixel 1. The pixel prediction method in Diagonal_Down_Left mode (mode 3) can be expressed as the following equation:<br>
[54]<br>
if x=3, y≠0, predL•[x,y] = p[x1,y-1], else,     predL• [x,y] = p[x+1 ,y-1]<br>
[55]	Also, when a pixel is predicted in Diagonal_Down_Left mode (mode 3), prediction<br>
can be performed by using an appropriate filler for pixels in prediction directions. For example, when 1:2:1 filler is used, pixel a 322 is predicted from (A + 2B + C + 2)/4 which is formed using pixel values located in the diagonal direction indicated by arrows in FIG. 3C, and pixel e 324 is predicted from (a + 2b + c + 2)/4 which is<br><br>
WO 2005/122592	PCT/KR2OO5/0016K3<br>
formed using pixel values located adjacent to pixel e 324 in the diagonal direction in the block 300. Also, pixel i 326 is predicted from (e + 2f + g + 2 )/4 and pixel in 328 is predicted from (i + 2j + k + 2)/4.<br>
[56]	In  the same manner, pixel b is predicted from (B + 2C + D + 2), pixel c from (C +<br>
2D + E + 2)/4, pixel d from (D + 2E + F + 2)/4, pixel I from (b + 2c + d + 2)/4, pixel g from (c + 2d + d + 2) / 4, pixel h from (d + 2d + d + 2) / 4, pixel j from (f + 2g + h + 2) / 4, pixel k from (g + 2h + h + 2) / 4, pixel I from (h + 2h + h + 2) /4, pixel n from (j + 2k + 1 + 2) / 4, pixel o from (k + 21 + 1 + 2) / 4, and pixel p from (I + 21 + 1 + 2) / 4.<br>
[57]	FIG. 3D illustrates pixel prediction of a luminance block and a G block in<br>
Diagonal_Down_Right mode (mode 4).<br>
[58]	Pixel a 322 is predicted from pixel X that is an adjacent pixel in the diagonal<br>
direction indicated by an arrow in FIG. 3D, and pixel f 334 is predicted from pixel a that is a pixel adjacent to pixel f 334 in the arrow direction in the block 300. Also, pixel k 336 is predicted from pixel f and pixel p 338 is predicted from pixel k.<br>
[59|	In this manner, pixel b predicted from pixel A, pixel c from pixel B, pixel d from<br>
pixel C, pixel e from pixel 1, pixel g from pixel b, pixel h from pixel c, pixel i from pixel J, pixel j from pixel e, pixel 1 from pixel g, pixel is from pixel K, pixel n from pixel i, and pixel o from pixel j. The pixel prediction method in Diagonal_Down_Right mode (mode 4) can be expressed as the following equation:<br>
|60|<br>
pred4x4L.[x7y] = p[x-l,y-l], x, y = 0, ..., 3<br>
[61]<br>
[62]	Also, when a pixel is predicted in Diagonal_Down_Right mode (mode 4),<br>
prediction can be performed by using an appropriate filter for pixels in prediction<br>
directions. For example, when 1:2:1 filter is used, pixel a 332 is predicted from (I + 2X<br>
+ A + 2)/4 which is formed using pixel values located in the diagonal direction<br>
indicated by arrows in FIG. 3D, and pixel f 334 is predicted from (l+2a+b+2)/4 which<br>
is formed using pixel values located adjacent to pixel f 334 in the arrow direction in the<br>
block 300. Also, pixel k 336 is predicted from (c + 2f + g + 2)/4 and pixel p 338 is<br>
predicted from (j + 2k + 1 + 2)/4.<br>
[63]	In the same manner, pixel b is predicted from (X + 2A + B + 2)/4, pixel c from (A +<br>
2B + C + 2)/4, pixel d from (B + 2C + D + 2)/4, pixel e from (J + 21 + a + 2)/4, pixel g from (a + 2b + c + 2)/4, pixel h from (b + 2c + d + 2)/4, pixel i from (K + 2J + e + 2)/4, pixel j from (J + 2e + f + 2)/4, pixel 1 from (f + 2g + h + 2)/4, pixel m from (L + 2K + i + 2)/4, pixel n from (K + 2i + j + 2)/4, and pixel o from (i + 2j + k + 2)/4. <br>

located in the diagonal direction at an angle of 22.5° from vertical, as indicated by arrows in FIG. 3E, and pixel c 344 is predicted from (I + a + 1 )/2 which is formed using: pixel values located adjacent to pixel c 344 in (he arrow direction at an angle of 22.5" from vertical, in the block 300.

blocks adjacent to the block 300.<br>
[85]	So far, prediction of luminance block and G block pixels with a 4 x 4 block size has<br>
been described as examples. However, when the size of a luminance block is 8 x 8 or 16 x 16, the luminance pixel prediction method described above can also be applied in the same manner. For example, when the mode for an 8x8 block is Vertical mode, as described with reference to FIG. 3A, each pixel is predicted from a nearest adjacent pixel in the vertical direction. Accordingly, the only difference is that the size of the block is 8 x 8 or 16 x 16, and except that, (he pixel prediction is the same as in Vertical mode for a 4 x 4 block.<br>
[86]	Meanwhile, in addition to pixels formed with luminance and chrominance, for a red<br>
(R) block and a blue (B) block among R, green (G), and B blocks, the pixel prediction method for a chrominance pixel described below can be applied.<br>
[87|	Next, calculation of pixels for a chrominance block, an R block, and B block will<br>
now be explained in detail with reference to FIGS. 4A through 4C.<br>
[88]	Prediction of pixels of a chrominance block, an R block, and a B block is performed<br>
in units of 8 x 8 blocks, and there arc 4 prediction modes, but in the present invention, plane mode is not used. Accordingly, in (he present invention, only DC mode (mode 0), Horizontal mode (mode 1) and Vertical mode (mode 2) are used.<br>

c3, d3, e.3, f3, g3, h3, i3, j3, k.3,13, m.3, n3, o.3, and p3 arc predicted from (M + N + O + P + 2)/4 and pixels a4, b4, c4, d4, c4,14, g4, h4, i4, j4, k4,14, m4, n4, o4, and p4 are<br>

|96|	It is described above (hat pixel prediction is performed by using adjacent pixels in<br>
each of 4 x 4 block units in luminance block and G block prediction and is performed by using adjacent pixels in each of 8 x 8 block units in chrominance block, R block, and B block prediction. However, the prediction method is not limited lo the 4x4 block or 8 x 8 block, and can be equally applied to blocks of an arbitrary size M x N. That is, even when a block unit lo be predicted is an M x N block, a pixel value lo be predicted can be calculated by using a pixel closes! to the pixel value in a prediction direction in the block.<br>
[97]	FIG. 5 illustrates a prediction method when encoding and decoding are performed<br>
in (he above modes.<br>
[98]	Referring lo FIG. 5, another method for obtaining a residual by pixel prediction will<br>
now be explained. In the conventional encoder, in order to obtain a residual value, a pixel in an adjacent block is used. For example, in Vertical_mode of FIG. 3A, in the conventional method, pixels a 302, e 304, i 306, and m 308 are predicted all from pixel A, and therefore, residual values are r = a-A, r = e-A, r = i-A, and r = m-A. In the<br>

present invention, by using thus obtained conventional residual values, new residual values are calculated. Then, the new residual values arc r'   = r , r'   = r -r , r"   = r -r ,<br>
and r'   = r -r. At this time, since the new residual values r'   r'   r'   and r'   arc r'   = a-<br>

[99|	Accordingly, the motion prediction unit 110 of the encoding apparatus of the<br>

invention, and performs decoding according lo an entropy decoding method such as CAVLC or CABAC. In the frontmost part of the received bitstream, a flag indicating that pixel values are predicted according lo the present invention can be set. As an example of this flag, there is a lossless_qpprimc_y_7xro_flag in H.264.<br>
[ l02]	By using this flag, information that pixel values arc predicted according lo the<br>

[105]	As described above, motion prediction is performed in a variety of intra prediction<br>
modes provided according to modified prediction methods, and an optimum mode is<br>
determined in operation S7I0. Also, without using the modified prediction methods, a block is formed by using residual values newly generated from residuals obtained by the conventional prediction method, and then, motion prediction under the intra prediction encoding mode can be performed. The optimum mode can be performed by RD optimization, and because lossless is encoding is used in the present inveniion, one encoding mode is determined by rate optimization. In the determined encoding mode, motion prediction is performed in operation S720. Then, the resulting value is entropy coded and output in operation S730.<br>
[106]	Decoding is performed in the reverse of the order of the encoding. That is, the<br>
cnlropy coded bitstream is inputl, and entropy decoded. Then, based on encoding mode information and flag informal ion, pixel values are restored according to the pixel prediction value calculation method of the present invention, and moving pictures are output.<br>
