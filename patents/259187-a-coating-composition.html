				<td>COATING COMPOSITION AND COATED ARTICLE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD The present invention relates to a coating composition that can form a coating film having excellent oxygen barrier properties. The present invention further relates to a coated article having excellent corrosion resistance, which is produced using the coating composition.<br>
BACKGROUND ART Among coating compositions, cationic electrodeposition coating compositions are particularly excellent in terms of coating workability, and are capable of forming a coating film with excellent corrosion resistance. Therefore, cationic electrodeposition coating compositions have been widely used as undercoating compositions for conductive metal products requiring the above properties, such as automobile bodies.<br>
To improve the safety of automobiles during collisions, the tubular portions, etc. of recent automobile bodies often have structures in which reinforcing members overlap each other. When electrodeposition coating is carried out, the current density of such portions becomes low, which makes it difficult to form an electrodeposition coating film; accordingly, only a thin film is formed thereon, or such portions remain uncoated. Furthermore, with such a structure, corrosion products (e.g., water, salts) easily accumulate, thus accelerating corrosion and reducing the strength of the automobile.<br>
Improved corrosion resistance, particularly resistance to corrosion from exposure, has thus become an important object to be achieved. However, if the amount of plasticizer in the coating composition is reduced to improve the corrosion resistance of a cationic electrodeposition coating composition, the obtained coating film becomes too hard, and the coating composition may be unsatisfactory in terms of film thickness<br>
retention over time, electrodeposition coatability on alloyed hot-dip galvanized steel plates, the finish, etc.<br>
Patent Document 1 discloses a gas barrier cationic electrodeposition coating composition comprising: a blocked isocyanate; and a polyamine resin composition obtained by reacting a specific epoxy resin with an amine compound containing an active hydrogen, the epoxy resin having a glycidyl ether moiety derived from resorcinol or a glycidylamine moiety derived from m-xylenediamine, the coating film formed after curing the resin composition containing at least 30 wt.% of "a specific skeletal structure containing an aromatic ring and nitrogen". The gas barrier cationic electrodeposition coating resin composition of Patent Document 1 has excellent corrosion resistance, and particularly excellent resistance to corrosion from exposure. These properties are achieved by "a specific skeletal structure containing an aromatic ring and nitrogen in the coating film" formed after curing the resin composition. However, the gas barrier cationic electrodeposition coating resin composition is insufficient in terms of electrodeposition coatability on alloyed hot-dip galvanized steel plates. Patent Document 1: Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication No. 2004-59866<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION PROBLEM TO BE SOLVED BY THE INVENTION An object of the present invention is to provide a coating composition that can form a coating film having excellent oxygen barrier properties.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a coated article produced by applying the coating composition as a cationic electrodeposition coating composition, the coated article having excellent corrosion resistance, particularly excellent resistance to corrosion from exposure, excellent electrodeposition coatability on alloyed hot-dip galvanized steel plates, and an excellent finish.<br>
MEANS FOR SOLVING THE PROBLEM<br>
As a result of extensive research to achieve the above objects, the present inventors found that a coating composition comprising: a modified epoxy resin (A) containing a benzene diether structure, which is obtained by reacting diglycidyl ether (al) with at least one phenol (a2) selected from resorcinol, hydroquinone, and catechol; and a crosslinking agent (B) can form a coating film having excellent oxygen barrier properties. The inventors have accomplished the present invention based on this finding.<br>
The present invention provides the following coating compositions and coated articles.<br>
Item 1. A coating composition comprising a modified epoxy resin (A) and a crosslinking agent (B), wherein said modified epoxy resin (A) contains a benzene diether structure represented by Formula (1)<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
(1) which resin is obtained by reacting diglycidyl ether (al) with at least one phenol (a2) selected from resorcinol, hydroquinone, and catechol.<br>
Item 2. A coating composition according to Item 1 wherein the modified epoxy resin (A) is an amino-group-containing modified epoxy resin (Al) containing an amino-group-containing compound. Item 3. A coating composition according to Item 1 or 2 wherein the crosslinking agent (B) is a compound containing a m-xylylene structure in the molecule. Item 4. A coating composition according to any one of Items 1 to<br>
3	comprising 0.1 to 100 parts by mass of a layered pigment (C)<br>
per 100 parts by mass of the total of the modified epoxy resin<br>
(A) and crosslinking agent (B) on a solids basis.<br>
Item 5. A coating composition according to any one of Items 1 to<br>
4	which is a cationic electrodeposition coating composition.<br>
Item 6. A coated article produced by applying the coating composition of any one of Items 1 to 5.<br>
EFFECT OF THE INVENTION The coating film formed using the coating composition of the invention has excellent corrosion resistance, and particularly excellent resistance to corrosion from exposure. When the coating composition is used as a cationic electrodeposition coating composition, a coated article having excellent electrodeposition coatability (pinhole resistance) on alloyed hot-dip galvanized steel plates and an excellent finish can be provided.<br>
The coating film formed using the coating composition of the invention is excellent in inhibiting the permeation of corrosion products (e.g., water, oxygen ion, chlorine ion) and is thus effective for enhancing corrosion resistance, particularly resistance to corrosion from exposure.<br>
More specifically, compared to conventional bisphenol A type epoxy resins, the modified epoxy resin (A) that has at least one member selected from resorcinol, hydroquinone, and catechol as a phenol (a2) has a more flexible and denser molecular structure, can be easily produced, and is excellent in coating stability. Therefore, a coated article with an excellent finish can be provided over time.<br>
Among the modified epoxy resins (A), amino-containing modified epoxy resins (Al) have a narrow molecular weight distribution, and amino groups dispersible in water are localized at the molecular ends of the resins. Therefore, amino-containing modified epoxy resins (Al) achieve excellent performance even with a small amount of neutralizer (high water dispersibility even with a small amount of neutralizer and good emulsion stability after being dispersed in water), and can form a coating film with excellent electrodeposition coatability (pinhole resistance) on alloyed galvanized hot-dip steel plates. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION A feature of the coating composition of the present<br>
invention is that the composition contains a modified epoxy resin (A) and a crosslinking agent (B) as resin components. The details are described below. Modified Epoxy Resin (A)<br>

(Formula Removed) <br>
and the structure is obtained by reacting diglycidyl ether (a1) with at least one phenol (a2) selected from resorcinol, hydroquinone, and catechol. Diglycidyl Ether (al):<br>
Diglycidyl ether (al) is a compound containing two epoxy groups in one molecule, and is obtained by reacting a difunctional phenolic compound with epichlorohydrin.<br>

(Formula Removed) <br>
In Formula (2), n is preferably an integer of 0 to 2.<br>
The epoxy resin usually has a number average molecular weight (Note 1) of 400 to 100,000, preferably 600 to 60,000, and even more preferably 800 to 20,000, and usually has an epoxy equivalent of 180 to 70,000, preferably 240 to 40,000, and more preferably 300 to 15,000.

Phenol (a2):<br>
Examples of phenols (a2) include hydroquinone, catechol, and resorcinol.<br>
Phenols (a2) are compounds particularly effective for imparting satisfactory corrosion resistance, satisfactory electrodeposition coatability (pinhole resistance) on alloyed hot-dip galvanized steel plates, and a satisfactory finish. Among the coating properties, hydroquinone is preferable from the viewpoint of corrosion resistance, particularly resistance to corrosion from exposure. The above compounds can be used singly or in a combination of two or more.<br>

From the viewpoint of corrosion resistance and electrodeposition coatability on alloyed galvanized steel plates, the mixing ratio of diglycidyl ether (al) to phenol (a2) is preferably such that the amount of diglycidyl ether (al) is 50 to 90 mass%, and preferably 60 to 85 mass%, and the amount of phenol (a2) is 10 to 50 mass%, and preferably 15 to 40 mass%, based on the total mass of these components, calculated as solids. Other polyphenol compounds may be optionally added can be used according to the desired coating properties. Thus, the obtained modified epoxy resin (A) has an epoxy equivalent of 500 to 3,000,<br>
and preferably 800 to 2,500. Amino-group-containing Modified Epoxy Resin (Al)<br>
The modified epoxy resin (A) used in the coating composition of the invention may be an amino-group-containing modified epoxy resin (Al) containing an amino-group-containing compound (a3), which is preferably used as a resin component of cationic electrodeposition coating compositions.<br>
The amino-group-containing compound (a3) is a component for imparting cationic properties to introduce an amino group to a modified epoxy resin. A compound having at least one active hydrogen capable of reacting with an epoxy group is used as the amino-group-containing compound (a3).<br>
Examples of the amino-group-containing compound (a3) that can be used for this purpose include mono- or di-alkylamines such as monomethylamine, dimethylamine, monoethylamine, diethylamine, monoisopropylamine, diisopropylamine, triisopropylamine, monobutylamine and dibutylamine; alkanolamines such as monoethanolamine, diethanolamine, mono(2-hydroxypropyl)amine, di(2-hydroxypropy1)amine, tri(2-hydroxypropyl)amine, monomethylaminoethanol and monoethylaminoethanol; alkylenepolyamines such as ethylenediamine, propylenediamine, butylenediamine, hexamethylenediamine, tetraethylenepentamine, pentaethylenehexamine, diethylaminopropylamine, diethylenetriamine and triethylenetetramine; and ketimine compounds of these polyamines; alkyleneimines such as ethyleneimine and propyleneimine; and cyclic amines such as piperazine, morpholine and pyrazine.<br>
To obtain satisfactory corrosion resistance and satisfactory electrodeposition coatability on alloyed hot-dip galvanized steel plates, the proportion of the amino-group-containing compound (a3) in the amino-group-containing modified epoxy resin (A1) is 10 to 50 mass%, and preferably 15 to 45 mass%, based on the total mass of the amino-group-containing modified epoxy resin (A1), calculated as solids.<br>
Crosslinking agent (B):<br>
The coating composition according to the present invention can be prepared using a crosslinking agent (B), such as a polyisocyanate compound, a blocked polyisocyanate compound, or an amino resin, with a modified epoxy resin (A), to produce a thermosetting coating composition.<br>
The polyisocyanate compound used as the crosslinking agent (B) may be a known compound. Examples of such compounds include aromatic, aliphatic, or alicyclic polyisocyanate compounds, such as (o-, m-, p-)tolylene diisocyanate, (o-, m-, p-)xylylene diisocyanate, phenylene diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-2,2'-diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-2,4'-diisocyanate, diphenylmethane-4,4'-diisocyanate, crude MDI [polymethylene polyphenyl isocyanate], bis(isocyanatemethyl)cyclohexane, tetramethylene diisocyanate, hexamethylene diisocyanate, methylene diisocyanate, and isophorone diisocyanate; cyclopolymers or biuret compounds of these polyisocyanate compounds; and combinations thereof.<br>
Among these, a xylylene diisocyanate compound, particularly an m-xylylene diisocyanate compound is preferably used as a compound of the coating composition to provide a coating film with enhanced oxygen barrier properties.<br>
The blocked polyisocyanate compound is a product obtained by an addition reaction between a polyisocyanate compound and a blocking agent, and has blocked isocyanate groups. The blocked polyisocyanate compound is stable at room temperature. However, when the blocked polyisocyanate compound is heated to a baking temperature of the coating film (usually about 100 to about 200°C) , free isocyanate groups may be reformed by release of the blocking agent.<br>
Examples of such blocking agents include oxime compounds such as methyl ethyl ketoxime and cyclohexanone oxime; phenolic compounds such as phenol, para-t-butylphenol and cresol; aliphatic alcohols such as n-butanol and 2-ethylhexanol; aromatic alkyl alcohols such as phenylcarbinol and methylphenylcarbinol;<br>

Examples of aldehydes used in the reaction include formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde, acetaldehyde, benzaldehyde, and the like. Compounds obtained by etherifying a methylolated amino resin as mentioned above with an appropriate alcohol can also be used as amino resins. Examples of alcohols that can be used for etherification include methyl alcohol, ethyl alcohol, n-propyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, 2-ethylbutanol, and 2-ethylhexanol.<br>
The mixing ratio of the modified epoxy resin (A) to the crosslinking agent (B) in the coating composition of the invention is such that the amount of modified epoxy resin (A) is usually 50 to 85 mass%, preferably 55 to 80 mass%, and even more preferably 55 to 78 mass%, and the amount of crosslinking agent (B) is usually 15 to 50 mass%, preferably 20 to 45 mass%, and more preferably 22 to 45 mass%, based on the total mass of these components, calculated as solids. The amount of xylylene diisocyanate compound is usually 0.1 to 30 mass%, preferably 1 to 20 mass%, and more preferably 5 to 15 mass%, based on 100 parts by mass of the total of the modified epoxy resin (A) and crosslinking agent (B), calculated as solids. The molar ratio of NCO groups derived from the crosslinking agent (B) to OH groups derived from the modified epoxy resin (A) is an NCO group/OH group ratio in the range of 0.7 to 1.1, and preferably 0.8 to 1.0.<br>
The coating composition of the invention may contain, in addition to the modified epoxy resin (A) and the crosslinking agent (B), pigments such as color pigments, rust preventive pigments, and extender pigments. Such pigments can be dispersed as fine particles in a paste and incorporated as a pigment-<br>
dispersed paste into the coating composition.<br>
Such a pigment-dispersed paste can be produced by adding and dispersing a resin for pigment dispersion, a neutralizer, and a pigment using a dispersion mixer, such as a ball mill, sand mill, and or pebble mill.<br>
Examples of such pigments include color pigments such as titanium oxide, carbon black, and red iron oxide; extender pigments such as clay, mica, baryta, calcium carbonate, talc, and silica; rust preventive pigments such as aluminum phosphomolybdate, aluminium tripolyphosphate, and zinc oxide (zinc flower); and the like.<br>
Among such extender pigments, the use of layered pigment (C) in a specific amount is particularly preferable to improve oxygen barrier properties. For example, at least one compound selected from montmorillonite, beidellite, nontronite, saponite, hectorite, stevensite, and bentonite may be used as the layered pigments (C). Such a layered pigment (C) functions as a barrier against corrosion-promoting substances (such as O2, Cl~, Na+) in the coating film, and also retains corrosion promoting substances therein.<br>
The coating composition preferably contains the layered pigment (C) in an amount of 1 to 100 parts by mass, and particularly 5 to 50 parts by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of the total of the modified epoxy resin (A) and crosslinking agent (B), calculated as solids.<br>
The coating composition may contain a bismuth compound to inhibit corrosion and prevent rusting. Examples of bismuth compounds that can be used include bismuth oxide, bismuth hydroxide, basic bismuth carbonate, bismuth nitrate, bismuth silicate, organic acid bismuth, and the like. The coating composition may contain an organic tin compound, such as dibutyl tin dibenzoate, dioctyl tin oxide, or dibutyl tin oxide to improve the curability of the coating film. The resin for pigment dispersion may be a known compound, and examples thereof include hydroxyl group-containing resins containing hydroxyl groups and<br><br>
cationic groups, surfactants, and the like. Cationic Electrodeposition Coating Composition<br>
The cationic electrodeposition coating composition containing an amino-group-containing modified epoxy resin (Al) as the modified epoxy resin (A) can be prepared in the following manner. Various additives such as surfactants and surface conditioners and an organic solvent are optionally added to the amino-group-containing modified epoxy resin (Al) and the crosslinking agent (B), and the mixture is fully mixed to prepare a resin composition. A water-soluble organic carboxylic acid or the like is then added to produce a water-soluble or water-dispersible emulsion of the resin composition.<br>
In general, the resin composition can be neutralized with known acids. Acids such as acetic acid, formic acid, lactic acid, and mixtures thereof are particularly preferable. Subsequently, a paste for pigment dispersion is added to the emulsion, and water is added for adjustment to prepare a cationic electrodeposition coating composition.<br>
The coating composition of the invention is preferably used for coated articles requiring corrosion resistance, particularly resistance to corrosion from exposure, and can be used as a corrosion protective coating composition that is applied by electrostatic coating, roll coating, electrodeposition coating, etc.<br>
Examples of substrates to which the coating composition of the invention is applied include cold rolled steel sheets; alloyed hot-dip galvanized steel sheets; electrogalvanized steel sheets; electrolytic zinc-iron double-plated steel sheets; organic composite-plated steel sheets; aluminum materials; magnesium materials; and such metal sheets whose surface are further washed optionally by alkaline degreasing or like processes, and then surface-treated with phosphate or chromate.<br>
In particular, the cationic electrodeposition coating composition containing an amino-group-containing modified epoxy<br>
resin (A1) and a crosslinking agent (B) has good corrosion resistance, and can provide a coated article with excellent electrodeposition coatability on alloyed hot-dip galvanized steel sheets, and an excellent finish. Therefore, the cationic electrodeposition coating composition can be used for any items made of metal, such as automobile bodies, two-wheeled vehicle parts, household appliances, and other instruments.<br>
Cationic electrodeposition coating can be performed by preparing a bath of an electrocoating composition with a pH of 5.5 to 9.0 and a solids content of 5 to 40 wt.% achieved by dilution with deionized water or the like, and applying a current at a voltage of 100 to 400 V to the bath adjusted to a temperature in the range of 15°C to 35°C using a substrate to be coated as a cathode. After the electrodeposition coating, the coated substrate is fully washed with water, such as ultrafiltrate (UF filtrate), reverse osmosis permeate (RO water), industrial water, pure water, or the like to remove an excess of the cationic electrodeposition coating composition.<br>
The thickness of the electrodeposition coating film, although not particularly limited, is usually in the range of 5 to 40 µm, and preferably 12 to 30 µm, when dried. The electrodeposition coating film is baked and dried by heating with a dryer, such as an electric hot air dryer or a gas hot air dryer, at a temperature on the coated surface of 110°C to 200°C, and preferably 140°C to 180°C, for 10 to 180 minutes, and preferably for 20 to 50 minutes. The coating film can be cured by baking and drying.<br>
