				<td>The present invention relates to a process for manufacturing high   voltage   terminal  insulator  for  A.C.   motors.   More particularly, the invention relates to insulators for motors used in highly inflammable environments viz. petrochemical plants, oil refineries gas pipe lines,etc. These terminal insulators should be flame proof, explosion proof and able to withstand high fault currents.<br>
Background of the Inventions<br>
Existing  terminal  insulators for AC motors  are  basically inorganic based ceramic insulators. The electrical rating of these insulators is limited to only 6.6 kV, 300 MVA fault level currents.  These insulators are fragile in nature and need careful handling.  Their mechanical strength is weak and while  assembling on  the AC motors, chances of breakage are more.  Process cycle for making  these  insulators takes  long  duration  because  it involves  various steps  like  moulding,  firing  at temperatures of  about 850 degree centigrade, pre stage  machining,  sintering and final  machining  to  the  required   dimensions. Dimensional<br>
tolerance   is  poor   and  there  is   high   shrinkage   while<br>
 manufacturing. Density of ceramic insulator is.3.69 gm/cm3.<br>
Some of the important properties of ceramic insulators are  given below.<br>
Rating	6.6 kV,300 MVA fault level<br>
Nominal insulation level      7 kV<br>
Proof voltage	13 kV<br>
Impulse .voltage	60 kV<br>
Partial discharge inception<br>
&amp; extinction voltages        4.2 kV<br>
Short time current rating	26 k A, 0.25 sec<br>
Continuous current rating	240 Amp<br>
Max temperature rise	100 degree C<br>
Type of protection	Flame proof and Explosion proof<br>
Summary of the Inventions<br>
The main object of the present invention is to overcome the drawbacks in the conventional ceramic insulators like poor impact strength, poor dimensional tolerance and higher cost of manufacture. This object is achieved by making the insulators for AC motors from essentially organic and inorganic based materials. Brominated epoxy resin, an organic material is used with inorganic fillers like Aluminium trihydrate and Silica.<br>
The present invention thus provides a process for manufacturing high voltage terminal insulators for AC motor*, comprising the steps of mixing brominated epoxy resins with inorganic fillers in a first chamber; keeping a hardner material<br>
in    second chamber maintaining said first and said second chamber<br>
 under vacuum at a temperature of about 650C blending the filler<br>
mixed brominated epoxy resins with said hardner for making a homogenous material; providing a sleeve in the center of a mould, and a ring for fixing the insulator to the motor terminal box; moulding said homogeneous material in the mould into an insulator<br>
of required dimensions; curing the mould  with the material under<br>
pressure at a temperature of about 1400C; keeping the cured<br>
insulator in an air circulating oven at a temperature of about<br>
1300C for further curing and cohesive bonding of resin and the<br>
hardner,  and  inserting a copper rod through the  insulator  for<br>
providing electrical connection between the motor and the power<br>
supply.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The present invention will now be described with help of the accompanying drawings wherein<br>
Fig. 1 shows geometry and shape of the insulator;<br>
Fig. 2 shows the sleeve of the terminal insulator;<br>
Fig. 3 shows the  mild steel ring of the terminal insulator;<br>
Figs. 4(a), 4(b) show  the copper rod used with the terminal insulator;<br>
Fig. 5  shows the epoxy body of the  insulator  in  cross section.<br>
Detailed Description of the Inventions<br>
Brominated  epoxy resin in thoroughly mixed with filler*,like aluminium  trihydrate  and silica powder for about 8 hours  in  a chamber which  is maintained under vacuum of 5 tor  and  at  a temperature  of  about 65 degrees C. The vacuum maintained is of 5 tor. A hardner is also kept in another chamber maintained under the  same  conditions.  This operation of maintaining the vacuum and  temperature  in  both  the chambers for  about  8  hours  is necessary to remove any dissolved gases present in the materials. After this operation, the filler mixed resin and the hardner are blended to  get  a  homogeneous material.<br>
The hardner used is carboxylic acid anhydride. For 100 parts by weight of brominated epoxy resin, 135 parts each of fillers aluminium trihydrate and silica powder are added and 65 parts by weight  of  carboxylic acid anhydride is used. For  moulding  of this material into an insulator of the present invention a mould is fabricated from MS material to the required dimensions of the insulator  shown  in  Fig.  1.<br>
As shown  in Fig. 2, a sleeve 2 comprising a brass tube 21 and glass fabric 22 is arranged at the center of the mould. These are placed in position to achieve the required reinforcement  and the mechanical strength.<br>
A steel ring cm •how in Fig. 3 in also provided • an interface between the terminal box of the motor and the insulator a« shown in Fig. 1, so that the insulator gets tightly fixed with the terminal box of the motor.<br>
The homogenous material which will be in semi-solid state, is pumped into the mould under pressure of 3 atm. The temperature of the mould is constantly maintained at about 1400C and pressure of 3 atm. Under these conditions of temperature and pressure, the material is kept in the mould for 4 hours for curing.<br>
The cured insulator is then removed from the mould and kept in an air circulating oven at a temperature of 130 degrees C  for 8 hours. This operation of further curing is necessary to help in a cohesive bonding of the resin and the hardner.<br>
A  copper rod 3, as shown Fig. 4, which is not an  integral part  of  the  epoxy body insulator 5  is  inserted  through  the insulator to serve as an electrical connection between the motor and  the  power  supply. The said copper  rod  has  fasteners  to connect  for  the  power  supply at one  end  and  provision  for<br>
connecting  cables from motor at the other end. Since the  copper<br>
 rod 3 is not an integral part of the insulator, this arrangement<br>
facilitates easy assembly, maintenance and replacement.<br>
Crocs  section  of  this new product  i.e.  the  epoxy body terminal insulator for high voltage AC motors is shown in Fig. 9.<br>
The process of manufacturing terminal insulators described hereinabove using the described composition of materials results in a new insulator capable of meeting the requirements of higher rating AC motors. The new terminal insulator of the present invention is flameproof and explosion proof. Apart from the improved electrical properties, another added feature of this new<br>
insulator is that, it has a less weight to volume ratio.  Density<br>
 of  epoxy  terminal  insulator is 2.0  gm/cm .  Laboratory  tests<br>
carried  out   show  that the terminal insulator of  the  present invention has the following properties.<br><br>
