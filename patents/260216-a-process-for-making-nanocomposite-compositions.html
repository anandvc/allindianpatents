				<td>NANOCOMPOSITE COMPOSITIONS AND PROCESSES FOR MAKING THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The present invention is directed towards low-permeability nanocomposite compositions, preferably elastomeric nanocomposite compositions comprising an intercalated nanoclay, and more particularly to compositions comprising a halogenated copolymer in combination with a clay intercalated with a multifunctional intercalant, which intercalant comprises a cationic moiety and an anionic moiety. The compositions may also comprise a filler such as carbon black and may form air barriers such as tire innerliners.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] Tubeless tires require compositions having high air retention. Bromobutyl and chlorobutyl rubbers are the polymers of choice for air-retention in tubeless tires. Similarly, brominated poly(isobutylene-co-p-methylstyrene) (BIMS), such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,162,445 and 5,698,640, is typically used when heat resistance is of importance. The selection of ingredients for the commercial formulations of elastomers depends upon the balance of properties desired and the application end use. For example, in the tire industry, processing properties of the green (uncured) compound in the tire plant versus in-service performance of the cured rubber tire composite, and the nature of the tire, i.e. bias versus radial tire, and passenger versus truck versus aircraft tire, are all important considerations that must be balanced.<br>
[0003] One method to alter product properties and improve air barrier properties is to add clay to an elastomer to form a "nanocomposite". Nanocomposites are polymer systems containing inorganic particles with at least one dimension in the nanometer range. Some examples of these are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 6,060,549, 6,103,817, 6,034,164, 5,973,053, 5,936,023, 5,883,173, 5,807,629, 5,665,183, 5,576,373, and 5,576,372. A common type of inorganic particle used in nanocomposites are phyllosilicates, an inorganic substance from the general class of so called "nano-clays" or "clays". Ideally, intercalation should<br><br>
take place in the nanocomposite, wherein the polymer inserts into the space or gallery between the clay surfaces. Ultimately, it is desirable to have near complete exfoliation, wherein the polymer is fully dispersed or intercalated with the individual nanometer-size clay platelets. Due to the general enhancement in air barrier qualities of various polymer compositions when clays are present, there is a desire to have a nanocomposite with low air permeability. [0004] Nanocomposites have been formed using brominated copolymers of isobutylene and p-methylstyrene. See, for example, Elspass et. al., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,807,629, 5,883,173, and 6,034,164. Further improvement in the uncured and cured properties of these elastomeric compositions can be achieved by the use of processing aids. For example, resins and oils (or other "processing aids") such as naphthalenic, paraffinic, and aliphatic resins may be used to improve the processability of elastomeric compounds. However, increased processability often comes at the price of a loss of air impermeability and an increase in undesirable effects of various other properties. Yet another possible negative impact is the release of processing aids into the final product, and the effect degradation products have on the overall properties of the matrix.<br>
[0005] In order to produce nanocomposites, organoclays must be exfoliated. Exfoliation of organoclays may be accomplished using an intercalant. At least partially intercalated organoclays may also be produced through solution based ion-exchange reactions that replace sodium ions that exist on the surface of particular clays, e.g., sodium montmorillonite, with alkyl or aryl ammonium compounds. One of the deficiencies of this method is the limited thermal stability of the amines. Another deficiency is the lack of chemical bonding between the clay and the polymer matrix the clay is distributed in. These deficiencies often lead to poor mechanical properties and reduced processing characteristics. [0006] One method to improve the organoclay performance is to use functionalized polymers to treat the clay. This approach has been limited to materials that are soluble in water or to materials that can be incorporated into the polymerization reaction. This approach has been used to prepare nylon nanocomposites, using for example, oligomeric and monomelic caprolactam as<br><br>
the modifier. Polyolefm nanocomposites have utilized maleic anhydride grafted polyolefins to achieve some success in the formation of nanocomposites. [0007] For example, it is known to utilize exfoliated-clay filled nylon as a high impact plastic matrix, such as disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 6,060,549 to Li et al. In particular, Li et al. disclose a blend of a thermoplastic resin such as nylon and a copolymer of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and a para-methylstyrene and a para-(halomethylstyrene), the blend also including nylon containing exfoliated-clays that are used as a high impact material. Further, Japanese Unexamined Application P2000-160024 to Yuichi et al. discloses a thennoplastic elastomer composition which can be used as an air barrier. The nanocomposite in Yuichi et al. includes is blend similar to that disclosed in Li et al.<br>
[0008] Nanocomposites have also been formed using brominated copolymers of isobutylene and para-methylstyrene. See, for example, Elspass et. al., U.S. Pat. No. 5,807,629, U.S. Pat. No. 5,883,173, and U.S. Pat. No. 6,034,164. It has been found that the efficiency of clay exfoliation is increased by increasing bromination level of the polymeT. Unfortunately, these copolymers are very reactive and it is difficult to achieve high levels of functionalization without undue added vulcanization. Optimal performance in many applications requires the minimum level of vulcanization that yields acceptable physical properties, in that way aging and durability of the compositions are maximized.<br>
[0009] Thus, there is still a problem of achieving a nanocomposite suitable for an air barrier, in particular, an air barrier incorporating the copolymer (or "interpolymer") of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin and a para-methylstyrene and a para-(halomethylstyrene). Enhancement of processability properties of such copolymers tends to result in copolymers having poor air barrier properties. What is needed is an exfoliated nanocomposite of a halogenated copolymer of a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin, a para-methylstyrene and a para-(halomethylstyrene), having both air barrier properties and improved processability properties.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0022] For the purposes of this invention and the claims thereto and for ease of reference when a polymer is referred to as comprising a monomer, the monomer is present in the polymer in the polymerized form. For purposes of this disclosure, the term oligomer refers to compositions having 2-40 mer units and the term polymer refers to compositions having 41 or more mer units. A mer is defined as a unit of an oligomer or polymer that originally corresponded to the monomer(s) used in the oligomerization or polymerization reaction. For example, the "mer" of polyethylene would be ethylene. For simplicity, when polymers are referred to, the reference may also apply to oligomers, unless specifically specified otherwise. Accordingly, the term polymer and oligomer may be referred to interchangeably herein unless otherwise specified. In addition, unless otherwise stated, the term "polymer" and "interpolymer" may include both homopolymers (i.e., a polymer comprising essentially one monomer), and/or a copolymer (i.e., a polymer comprising more than one monomer). [0023] Throughout, limiting ranges are disclosed for various physical properties and component compositions. It is noted that throughout, any lower range end may be combined with any upper range end of the same property to provide a particular range for any disclosed physical and/or compositional property.<br>
[0024] The term "phr" is parts per hundred rubber, and is a measure common in the art wherein components of a composition are measured relative to the major elastomer component, based upon 100 parts by weight of the elastomer or elastomers.<br>
[0025] As used herein, in reference to Periodic Table "Groups", the new numbering scheme for the Periodic Table Groups are used as in HAWLEY'S CONDENSED CHEMICAL DICTIONARY 852 (13th ed. 1997). [0026] The term "elastomer", as used herein, refers to any polymer or composition of polymers consistent with the ASTM D1566 definition. The term "elastomer" may be used interchangeably with the term "rubber", as used herein. [0027] The present invention includes nanocomposite compositions of halogenated elastomers and at least partially exfoliated clays treated with a<br><br>
multifunctional intercalant and a cationic surfactant. The multifunctional intercalant preferably comprises a cationic moiety separated from an anionic moiety by at least 1, preferably at least 4 carbon atoms. Preferably, the anionic moiety of the multifunctional intercalant is capable of reacting with the functionalized interpolymer (e.g., the halogenated elastomer) to form any type of chemical bond or a physical interaction (e.g., ionic, coordination, covalent, van der Waals forces, or the like) between the two, and the cationic moiety of the multifunctional intercalant is capable of reacting with the clay to form any type of chemical bond or physical attraction between the two, thus interacting the clay. The functionalized interpolymer is preferably a halogenated elastomer, which comprises C4 to C7 isoolefin derived units, para-methylstyrene derived units and para-(halomethylstyrene) derived units in one embodiment, and comprising C4 to C7 isoolefin derived units, multiolefin derived units, and halogenated multiolefin derived units in another embodiment. The nanocomposite can also include other cross-linking agents, thermoplastics, secondary rubbers, other additives, or other "general purpose rubbers" as described herein.<br>
Functionalized Interpolymer<br>
[0028] The functionalized interpolymer comprises a functionalized elastomer, which may be interchangeably referred to herein merely as an interpolymers and/or a random elastomeric copolymer. By functionalized, it is meant the interpolymer comprises one or more functional group(s) which include halogen or some other functional group which may be incorporated by nucleophilic substitution of benzylic halogen with other groups such as carboxylic acids; carboxy salts; carboxy esters, amides and imides; hydroxy; alkoxide; phenoxide; thiolate; thioether; xanthate; cyanide; cyanate; isocyanide, amino and mixtures thereof. Functional groups are preferably bromine, chlorine, or iodine, with bromine being most preferred.<br>
[0029] The functionalized interpolymers preferably comprise C2-C8 olefin monomer, an alkylstyrene monomer, and a functionalized alkylstyrene monomer. In a preferred embodiment, the olefin comprises a C4 to C7 isomonoolefin, such as<br><br>

[0030] In an embodiment, the functionalized interpolymer comprises at least 80%, more preferably at least 90% by weight of the para-isomer. functionalized interpolymers include those wherein at least some of the alkyl substituents groups present in the styrene monomer units contain benzylic halogen or some other functional group. In another embodiment of the invention, the functionalized interpolymer is a random elastomeric copolymer of ethylene or a C3 to C6 α-olefin and a para-alkylstyrene comonomer, preferably para-methylstyrene containing at least 80%, more preferably at least 90% by weight of the para-isomer, and also including functionalized interpolymers wherein at least some of the alkyl substituents groups present in the styrene monomer units contain benzylic halogen, preferably benzylic bromine, or some other functional group. Preferred materials may be characterized as functionalized interpolymers containing the following monomer units randomly spaced along the polymer chain<br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
, lower alkyl, preferably C1 to C7 alkyl and primary or secondary alkyl halides and X is a functional group or a leaving group such as halogen. Preferably R and R1 are each hydrogen. Up to 60 mol % of the para-substituted styrene present in the functionalized interpolymer structure may be the functionalized structure (2) above in one embodiment, and in<br>
another embodiment from 0.1 to 5 mol %. In yet another embodiment, the amount of functionalized structure (2) is from 0.4 to 1 mol %.<br>
[0031] The functional group X may be halogen or some other functional group which may be incorporated by nucleophilic substitution of benzylic halogen with other groups such as carboxylic acids; carboxy salts; carboxy esters, amides and imides; hydroxy; alkoxide; phenoxide; thiolate; thioether; xanthate; cyanide; cyanate; amino and mixtures thereof. X is preferably bromine, chlorine, or iodine, with bromine being most preferred. These fiinctionalized isomonoolefin copolymers, their method of preparation, methods of functionalization, and cure are more particularly disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 5,162,445. [0032] Most useful of such functionalized materials are elastomeric random interpqlymers of isobutylene and para-methylstyrene containing from 0.5 to 20 mol % para-methylstyrene wherein up to 60 mol % of the methyl substituent groups present on the benzyl ring contain a bromine or chlorine atom, preferably a bromine atom (para-bromomethylstyrene), as well as acid or ester functionalized versions thereof.<br>
[0033] In a preferred embodiment, the functionality is selected such that it can react or form polar bonds with functional groups present in the matrix polymer, for example, acid, amino or hydroxyl functional groups, preferably when the polymer components are mixed at high temperatures.<br>
[0034] These functionalized interpolymers preferably have a substantially homogeneous compositional distribution such that at least 95% by weight of the polymer has a para-alkylstyrene content within 10% of the average para-alkylstyrene content of the polymer. Desirable functionalized interpolymers are also characterized by a narrow molecular weight distribution (Mw/Mn) of less than 5, more preferably less than 2.5, a preferred weight average molecular weight in the range of from 200,000 up to 2,000,000 and a preferred number average molecular weight in the range of from 25,000 to 750,000 as determined by gel permeation chromatography.<br>
[0035] The functionalized interpolymers may be prepared by a slurry polymerization of the monomer mixture using a Lewis acid catalyst, followed by halogenation, preferably bromination, in solution in the presence of halogen and a<br>
radical initiator such as heat and/or light and/or a chemical initiator and, optionally, followed by electrophilic substitution of bromine with a different functional moiety.<br>
[0036) Preferred functionalized interpolymers include so-called "BIMS" polymers comprising brominated polymers that generally contain from 0.1 to 10 mol %, more preferably 0.1 to 5 mol% of bromomethylstyrene groups relative to the total amount of monomer derived units in the polymer. In another embodiment, the amount of bromomethyl groups is from 0.2 to 3.0 mol %, and from 0.3 to 2.8 mol % in yet another embodiment, and from 0.4 to 2.5 mol % in yet another embodiment, and from 0.3 to 2.0 in yet another embodiment, wherein a desirable range may be any combination of any upper limit with any lower limit. [0037] Expressed another way, preferred functionalized interpolymers contain from 0.2 to 10 wt % of bromine, based on the weight of the polymer, from 0.4 to 6 wt % bromine in another embodiment, and from 0.6 to 5.6 wt % in another embodiment, are substantially free of ring halogen or halogen in the polymer backbone chain. In one embodiment of the invention, the functionalized interpolymer is a copolymer of C4 to C7 isoolefin derived units (or isomonoolefin), para-methylstyrene derived units and para-(halomethylstyrene) derived units, wherein the para-(halomethylstyrene) units are present in the functionalized interpolymer from 0.4 to 3.0 mol % based on the total number of para-methylstyrene, and wherein the para-methylstyrene derived units are present from 3 wt % to 15 wt % based on the total weight of the polymer in one embodiment, and from 4 wt % to 10 wt % in another embodiment. In another embodiment, the para-(halomethylstyrene) is para-(bromomethylstyrene). [0038] The nanocomposite of the present invention may also include a functionalized interpolymer comprising a halogenated butyl rubber component, either alone, or with another functionalized interpolymer. In one embodiment of the invention, the functionalized interpolymer comprises a halogenated copolymer of a C4 to C6 isoolefin and a multiolefin. In another embodiment, the functionalized interpolymer comprises a blend of a polydiene or block copolymer, and a copolymer of a C4 to C6 isoolefin and a conjugated, or a "star-branched" butyl polymer.   The functionalized interpolymer useful in the present invention<br>
can thus be described as a halogenated elastomer comprising C4 to C7 isoolefm derived units, multiolefin derived units, and halogenated multiolefln derived units, and includes both "halogenated butyl rubber" and so called "halogenated star-branched" butyl rubber.<br>
[0039] In one embodiment, the functionalized interpolymer comprises a halogenated butyl rubber, comprising a brominated butyl rubber, and in another embodiment a chlorinated butyl rubber. General properties and processing of halogenated butyl rubbers are described in THE VANDERBILT RUBBER HANDBOOK 105-122 (Robert F. Ohm ed., R. T. Vanderbilt Co., Inc. 1990), and in RUBBER TECHNOLOGY 311-321 (Maurice Morton ed., Chapman &amp; Hall 1995). Butyl rubbers, halogenated butyl rubbers, and star-branched butyl rubbers are also described by Edward Kresge and H. C. Wang in 8 KIRK-OTHMER ENCYCLOPEDIA OF CHEMICAL TECHNOLOGY 934-955 (John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. 4th ed. 1993).<br>
[0040] Accordingly, the functionalized interpolymer may comprise a halogenated rubber component which may include, but is not limited to, brominated butyl rubber, chlorinated butyl rubber, star-branched polyisobutylene rubber, star-branched brominated butyl (polyisobutylene/isoprene copolymer) rubber; isobutylene-bromomethylstyrene copolymers such as isobutylene/meta-bromomethylstyrene, isobutylene/para-bromomethylstyrene, isobutylene/chloro-methylstyrene, halogenated isobutylene cyclopentadiene, and isobutylene/para-chloromethy-styrene, and the like; halomethylated aromatic interpolymers as in U.S. Pat. No. 4,074,035 and U.S. Pat. No. 4,395,506; isoprene and halogenated isobutylene copolymers, polychloroprene, and the like; and mixtures of any of the above. Some embodiments of the halogenated rubber component are also described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,703,091 and 4,632,963.<br>
[0041] More particularly, in one embodiment of the brominated rubber component of the invention, a halogenated butyl rubber is used. As used herein, "halogenated butyl rubber" refers to both butyl rubber and so-called "star-branched" butyl rubber, described herein. The halogenated butyl rubber is produced from the halogenation of butyl rubber. Preferably, the olefin polymerization feeds employed in producing the halogenated butyl rubber of the<br>
invention are those olefinic compounds conventionally used in the preparation of butyl-type rubber polymers. The butyl polymers are prepared, by reacting a comonomer mixture, the mixture having at least (1) a C4 to C6 isoolefm monomer component such as isobutylene with (2) a multiolefm, or conjugated diene, monomer component. The isoolefm is in a range from 70 to 99.5 wt % by weight of the total comonomer mixture in one embodiment, and 85 to 99.5 wt % in another embodiment. The conjugated diene component in one embodiment is present in the comonomer mixture from 0.5 to 30 wt % in one embodiment, and from 0.5 to 15 wt % in another embodiment. In yet another embodiment, from 0.5 to 8 wt % of the comonomer mixture is conjugated diene.<br>
[0042] The isoolefm is a C4 to C6 compound such as isobutylene, isobutene 2-methyl-1-butene, 3-methyl-1-butene, 2-methyl-2-butene, and 4-methyl-l-pentene. The multiolefm is a C4 to C14 conjugated diene such as isoprene, butadiene, 2,3-dimethyl-l ,3-butadiene, myrcene, 6,6-dimethyl-fulvene, cyclopentadiene, hexadiene and piperylene. One embodiment of the butyl rubber polymer of the invention is obtained by reacting 92 to 99.5 wt % of isobutylene with 0.5 to 8 wt % isoprene, or reacting 95 to 99.5 wt % isobutylene with from 0.5 wt % to 5.0 wt % isoprene in yet another embodiment.<br>
[0043] Halogenated butyl rubber is produced by the halogenation of the butyl rubber product described above. Halogenation can be carried out by any means, and the invention is not herein limited by the halogenation process. Methods of halogenating polymers such as butyl polymers are disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,631,984, 3,099,644, 4,554,326, 4,681,921, 4,650,831, 4,384,072, 4,513,116 and 5,681,901. In one embodiment, the halogen is in the so called II and III structures as discussed in, for example, RUBBER TECHNOLOGY at 298-299 (1995). In one embodiment, the butyl rubber is halogenated in hexane diluent at from 40 to 60°C using bromine (BR2) or chlorine (C12) as the halogenation agent. The halogenated butyl rubber has a Mooney Viscosity of from 20 to 70 (ML 1+8 at 125°C) in one embodiment, and from 25 to 55 in another embodiment. The halogen wt % is from 0.1 to 10 wt % based in on the weight of the halogenated butyl rubber in one embodiment, and from 0.5 to 5 wt % in another embodiment.<br>
In yet another embodiment, the halogen wt % of the halogenated butyl rubber is from 1 to 2.2 wt %.<br>
[0044] In another embodiment, the halogenated butyl or star-branched butyl rubber may be halogenated such that the halogenation is in the primary allylic position. This is typically achieved by such means as free radical bromination or free radical chlorination, or by such methods as secondary treatment halogenated rubbers, such as by heating the rubber, to form the allylic halogenated butyl and star-branched butyl rubber. Common methods of forming the allylic halogenated polymer are disclosed by Gardner el al. in U.S. Pat. No. 4,632,963; U.S. Pat. No. 4,649,178; U.S. Pat. No. 4,703,091. Thus, in one embodiment of the invention, the halogenated butyl rubber is such that the halogenated multiolefin units are primary allylic halogenated units, and wherein the primary allylic configuration is present to at least 20 mol % (relative to the total amount of halogenated multiolefin) in one embodiment, and at least 30 mol % in another embodiment. This arrangement can be described as follows (3), wherein X is a halogen, desirably chlorine or bromine, and q is at least 10 mol % based on the total moles of halogen in one embodiment, and at least 30 mole % in another embodiment, and from 25 mol % to 90 mol % in yet another embodiment:<br><br>

Other suitable intercalants include exfoliating additives include those which can be covalently bonded to the interlayer surfaces. These include polysilanes of the structure — Si(R5)2R6 where R5 is the same or different at each occurrence and is selected from alkyl, alkoxy or oxysilane and R6 is an organic radical compatible with the functionalized interpolymer of the composition. Processes for intercalating layered silicates, include those disclosed in U.S. Pat. Nos. 4,472,538, 4,810,734, and 4,889,885, as well as WO92/02582.<br>

achieve exfoliation of the clay such that an improved air retention as measured by the permeability testing described herein is achieved in the compositions of the present invention relative to comparative examples. For example, the multifunctional intercalant may be present from 0.1 to 20 phr in one embodiment, and from 0.2 to 15 phr in yet another embodiment, and from 0.3 to 10 phr in yet another embodiment. The multifunctional intercalant may be contacted with the clay of the composition at any stage; for example, the multifunctional intercalant may be added to the functionalized interpolymer, followed by addition of the clay, or may be contacted with the functionalized interpolymer and clay mixture; or the multifunctional intercalant may be first contacted with the clay under appropriate pH conditions, followed by contacting with the functionalized interpolymer or other additives, fillers, rubbers, curatives, and the like.<br>
[0064] Contacting of the multifunctional intercalant with the clay is conducted under conditions which result in intercalation or "exfoliation" of the layered platelets of the clay, preferably as a consequence of a reduction of the ionic forces holding the layers together and introduction of molecules between layers which serve to space the layers at distances of greater than 4 A, preferably greater than 9 A. This separation allows the layered silicate to more readily polymeric material between the layers and facilitates further delamination of the layers when the intercalate is subjected to shear through mixing, milling, or otherwise blending with matrix functionalized interpolymer material to provide a uniform dispersion of the exfoliated layers within the functionalized interpolymer matrix of the composition.<br>
Intercalation Modifier<br>
[0065] Compositions of the present invention include at least one functionalized interpolymer as described above that has been contacted by any suitable means with an at least one partially exfoliated clay. The at least partially exfoliated clay is produced through combination of the clay with a multifunctional intercalant comprising a cationic moiety separated from an anionic moiety by at least 1, preferably at least 4 carbon atoms. Accordingly, processes of the present invention may further comprising the step of contacting the multifunctional<br><br>
intercalant with the clay, and/or contacting the at least partially intercalated clay with the functionalized interpolymer in the presence of an intercalation modifier, wherein the intercalation modifier is a surface active agent such as a surfactant, a block copolymer, a wetting agent, an emulsifying agent, or a combination thereof. [0066] The addition of the intercalation modifier preferably functions to improve exfoliation of the clay, and/or provide a more uniform dispersion of the at least partially exfoliated clay within the functionalized interpolymer matrix. [0067] Examples of intercalation modifiers include ionic and non-ionic surfactants including block copolymers, wetting agents, emulsifying agents, and the like. A wide range of such surfactants is available and can be selected readily by those skilled in the art from "The Handbook of Industrial Surfactants," 2nd Edition, Gower (1997), which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety for all purposes. There is no restriction on the type or chemical class of surfactant that can be used.

Examples of such accelerators and vulcanizing agents include di-ortho-tolylguanidine salt of dicatechol borate, m-phenylene bis maleimide, 2, 4, 6-trirnercapto-5 triazine, zinc diethyl dithiocarbamate, and other dithiocarbamates, dipenta-methylene thiuram hexasulfide, alkylated phenol disulfide, phenol formaldehyde resin, brominated alkyl phenol formaldehyde resin, diphenyl phenylene diamine, salicyclic acid (o-hydroxy benzoic acid), wood rosin (abietic acid), and tetramethyl thiuram disulfide in combination with sulfur, stearic acid, diphenyl guanidine (DPG), tetramethylthiuram disulfide (TMTD), 4,4'-dithiodimorpholine (DTDM), tetrabutylthiuram disulfide (TBTD), 2,2'-benzothiazyl disulfide (MBTS), hexamethylene-l,6-bisthiosulfate disodium salt dihydrate, 2-(morpholinothio) benzothiazole (MBS or MOR), compositions of 90% MOR and 10% MBTS (MOR 90), N-tertiarybutyl-2-benzothiazole sulfonamide (TBBS), and N-oxydiethylene thiocarbamyl-N-oxydiethylene sulfonamide (OTOS), zinc 2-ethyl hexanoate (ZEH), and N,N'-diethyl thiourea.<br>
[0082] Acceleration of the cure process may be accomplished by adding to the composition an amount of the accelerant. The mechanism for accelerated vulcanization of natural rubber involves complex interactions between the curative, accelerator, activators and polymers. Ideally, all of the available curative is consumed in the formation of effective crosslinks which join together two or more polymer chains and enhance the overall strength of the polymer matrix.

Method of Producing<br>
{0085] The method by which the inventive compositions are produce may include the following steps, wherein the steps are listed in no particular order unless specifically recited as such.<br>
[0086] The components of the present composition are contacted with each other to form an intimate mixture, blend, composition, or the like of components. For ease of reference, such contacting is simply referred to herein as blending. Blending of the components may be carried out by combining the polymer components and the at least partially intercalated clay in any suitable mixing device such, as a Banbury® mixer, Brabender® mixer or preferably a mixer/extruder and mixing at temperatures in the range of 120°C up to 300°C under conditions of shear sufficient to allow the clay intercalate to become uniformly dispersed within the functionalized interpolymer to form the nanocomposite composition of the present invention.<br>
[0087] In an embodiment, a process for preparing a nanocomposite composition comprises the steps of:<br>
a)	contacting the multifunctional intercalant comprising a cationic moiety separated from an anionic moiety by at least 1 carbon as described above, with a clay at a temperature and for a period of time sufficient to produce an at least partially intercalated clay; and<br>
b)	contacting the at least partially intercalated clay with a functionalized interpolymer as described above at a temperature, and for a period of time sufficient to produce the inventive nanocomposite composition.<br>
[0088] In an embodiment, step a) contacting the multifunctional intercalant comprising a cationic moiety separated from an anionic moiety by at least 1 carbon as described above, with a clay is preferably preformed at a temperature of<br><br>
from 20 to 120°C, more preferably from 30 to 90°C, with40 to 70°C being more preferred.<br>
[0089] Step a) is also preferably conducted for a period of time of I minute to 24 hours, preferably 0.5 to 8 hours (hrs.), with 1 to 4 hrs. being more preferred. [0090] In an embodiment, step b)contacting the at least partially intercalated clay with a functionalized interpolymer as described above at a temperature, and for a period of time sufficient to produce the inventive nanocomposite composition, is preferably preformed at a temperature of from 40 to 140°C, more preferably from 60 to 120°C, with 80 to 100°C being more preferred. [0091] Step b) is also preferably conducted for a period of time of 1 minute to 24 hours, preferably 0.5 to 8 hrs., with 1 to 4 hrs. being more preferred. [0092] In an embodiment, the contacting of the multifunctional intercalant with the clay recited in step (a) may be conducted at a pH wherein the cationic moiety of the multifunctional intercalant is positively charged. Accordingly, the contacting of the multifunctional intercalant with the clay is preferably conducted at an acidic pH (i.e., pH less than 7.) Thus addition of an acid may be included in step (a) wherein the contacting of the multifunctional intercalant with the clay occurs. A preferred pH for contacting the multifunctional intercalant with the clay is a pH of 6 or less, preferably 5 or less, preferably 4 or less, preferably 3 or less, preferably 2 or less, preferably 1 or less. Preferred acids include both Bronsted acids and Lewis acids, including mineral acids (e.g., HC1, HBr, HI, and/or HF), sulfuric acid, sulfonic acids, sulfamic acids, phosphoric acids, phosphorous acids, combinations thereof, and the like.<br>
[0093] The multifunctional intercalant is contacted with the clay at a temperature and for a period of time sufficient to allow at least a portion of the cationic moiety of the multifunctional intercalant to exchange with sites on the clay. The multifunctional intercalant may be first at least partially dissolved in a solvent, such as water, an organic solvent, or a combination thereof, where it may then be combined with an acid an mixed. One particularly preferred class of solvents includes low molecular weight alcohols (e.g., (C1-C6 alcohols, preferably methanol (MeOH), ethanol (EtOH), isopropanol (iPrOH), propanol (PrOH), and butanol (BuOH.)   The acidified multifunctional intercalant mixture or solution<br><br>
thereof may also be heated as necessary to insure a charged cationic moiety is present (e.g., to protonate the amine functionality of the multifunctional intercalant.)<br>
[0094] A second modifier in the form of a surfactant may also be added to the multifunctional intercalant solution or mixture either prior to addition of the clay, along with the addition of the clay, or after addition of the clay. In an embodiment, a surfactant, preferably a neutral or a cationic surfactant, most preferably a cationic surfactant is added to the multiftmctional intercalant solution (and/or mixture) along with or subsequent to the acid, but preferably before addition of the clay. The mixture may then be heated, mixed, shaken, or the like to produce an intimate mixture of the multifunctional intercalant, the acid and the second modifier.<br>
[0095] The second modifier (the intercalation modifier, e.g., the surfactant) is preferably present in the mixture at or above the critical micelle concentration of the particular surfactant or surfactants in the particular solution. The multifunctional intercalant solution may then be combined with the clay, preferably a Na+ form clay such as Cloisite Na+. The clay may first be slurried in a solvent such as water, an alcohol, an organic solvent, or a combination thereof prior to being contacted with the multifunctional intercalant. The combined multifunctional intercalant, clay, and optional solvents), acid(s) and second modifiers) may then be blended and/or heated for a period of time sufficient to produce an at least partially intercalated clay, also referred to herein as an at least partially exfoliated clay. In another embodiment, the intercalation modifier is present in the nanocomposite composition at greater than 0.1 wt%, preferably at greater than 0.5 wt%, with greater than 1 wt% being more preferred. [0096] The at least partially intercalated clay (the modified clay) may then be separated from the solvent, washed with a solvent and/or dried, and/or milled for subsequent addition to the functionalized interpolymer and optionally in combination with other additives.<br>
10097] The functionalized interpolymer may then be contacted with the at least partially intercalated clay. In an embodiment, the functionalized interpolymer may be at least partially dissolved in an appropriate solvent, and the<br><br>
modified clay added thereto. Preferred solvents include hydrocarbon solvent, including aliphatic hydrocarbons (e.g., pentane, hexane, and the like), aromatic solvents including benzene, toluene, xylene, and the like, and combinations thereof. The modified clay may be added as a solid, or in a slurry or other mixture along with a solvent. The modified clay and the fiinctionalized interpolymer may then be contacted (e.g., mixed, blended, kneaded, and/or the like) for a period of time, and at a temperature sufficient to produce the inventive nanocomposite composition.<br>
[0098] In a preferred embodiment, the modified clay and the fiinctionalized interpolymer are blended for a period of time, and at a temperature sufficient to produce chemical bonds between the anionic moiety of the multifunctional intercalant, and the halogen substituents of the functionalized interpolymer. For example, a carboxylate functional group of the multifunctional intercalant may react with a halogen atom on a phenyl ring of the functionalized interpolymer to produce an ester linkage between the multifunctional intercalant and the functionalized interpolymer, and thus may form a linkage between the modified clay to which the cationic moiety of the multifunctional intercalant is attached and/or bonded to, and the functionalized interpolymer.<br>
[0099] In a preferred embodiment, the at least partially intercalated clay and the functionalized interpolymer are blended for a period of time, at a temperature, and at a pH sufficient to produce the inventive nanocomposition. Preferably, the modified clay and the functionalized interpolymer are contacted at a pH of greater than 7, preferably greater than 8, preferably greater than 9, preferably greater than 10. As such, a basic material, such as NaOH, KOH, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate, and/or the like, may be added to the step wherein the at least partially intercalated clay and the functionalized interpolymer are contacted.

X-ray diffraction of the samples may be determined according to the d-spacing of the clay and/or the nanocomposite composition. Accordingly, The distance between the layers of the clay is the so-called " dlOO d-spacing". A d-spacing (dlOO) of greater then 20 Angstroms being indicative of an exfoliated clay.

Test Methods<br>
[00113] Oxygen transmission rate was measured using a MOCON OxTran Model 2/61 operating under the principle of dynamic measurement of oxygen transport through a thin film as published by R. A. Pasternak et al. in 8 JOURNAL OF POLYMER SCIENCE: PART A-2 467 (1970). The units of measure are mm.cc/m2 day. Generally, the method is as follows: flat film, or rubber samples are clamped into diffusion cells which are purged of residual oxygen using an oxygen free carrier gas. The carrier gas is routed to a sensor until a stable zero value is established. Pure oxygen or air is then introduced into the outside of the chamber of the diffusion cells. The oxygen diffusing through the film to the inside chamber is conveyed to a sensor which measures the oxygen diffusion rate. [00114] Air permeability was tested by the following method. Thin, vulcanized test specimens from the sample compositions were mounted in diffusion cells and conditioned in an oil bath at 65° C. The time required for air to permeate through a given specimen is recorded to determine its air permeability. Test specimens were circular plates with 12.7-cm diameter and 0.38-mm thickness. The error (2a) in measuring air permeability is ±0.245 (X108) units. Other test methods are described in Table 2.<br>
Permeability measurement:<br>
[00115] Permeability testing proceeded according to the following description. All examples were compression molded with slow cooling to provide defect free pads. A compression and curing press was used for rubber samples. Typical thickness of a compression molded pad is around 0.38 mm using a Carver press, 2" diameter disks were then punched out from molded pads for permeability<br><br>
testing. These disks were conditioned in a vacuum oven at 6O0C overnight prior to the measurement. The oxygen permeation measurements were done using a Mocon OX-TRAN 2/61 permeability tester at 40oC under the principle of R. A. Pasternak et. al. in Vol. 8 Journal of Polymer Science: Part A-2 467 (1970) as discussed above. Disks thus prepared were mounted on a template and sealed with vacuum grease. A steady flow of oxygen at 10 mL/min was maintained on one side of the disk, while a steady flow of nitrogen at 10 mL/min was maintained on the other side of the disk. Using the oxygen sensor on the nitrogen side, increase in oxygen concentration on the nitrogen side with time could be monitored. The time required for oxygen to permeate through the disk, or for oxygen concentration on the nitrogen side to reach a constant value, is recorded and used to determine the oxygen gas permeability.<br>
X-ray Analysis<br>
[00116] X-Ray testing proceeded according to the following description. X-ray data was collected on two different goniometer configurations. A D/MAX Rapid 2-dimensional detector microdiffraction system, with SAXS beam stop and point source was used for one set of data, and an Ultima III line source system with SAXS attachment in parallel beam mode was used for the second set of data. The intensity versus d-spacing plots shown in Figures 1-6 are from the parallel beam point source with SAXS attachment instrument. For this data, the sample was prepared by cutting various sections at different angles with respect to the sample surface in order to decrease effects of preferred orientation, and the parallel beam was used to illuminate the entire sample area.<br>
