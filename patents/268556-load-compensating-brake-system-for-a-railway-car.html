				<td>The present invention relates, in "eneral, to brake systems for railway cars and, more particularly, this invention relates to a railway car brake system having an integrated car load compensating arrangement.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Brake systems for railway car double axle wheel trucks generally include<br>
brake shoes mounted on opposite ends of a pair of brake beams which are positioned between<br>
the axles. These brake beams are movable away from each other in order to bring such brake<br>
shoes into engagement with the wheel treads.	Customarily, these prior art type brake<br>
systems include a cylinder and piston for actuating the brake shoes into factional engagement with the wheels. The cylinder and piston can either be mounted on the railroad car which the wheel truck supports, "car mounted", or can be mounted on the wheel truck, "truck mounted." In both cases, a multiple lever system interconnects the piston and the brake beams for proper operation of the brakes.<br>
As is well known in the railway industry, one of the major problems arising in all railway car brake systems is that the load imposed by the cars on their respective wheel trucks can vary considerably from car to car and t -nek to truck. Thus, in a single train consist, some of the cars may be fully loaded, some partially loaded, and some empty. Conditions may exist where one end of a car is loaded differently than the other end which poses different requirements for braking systems mounted at each truck.<br>
Consequently, if uniform pressure is applied to the pneumatic means, i.e., the piston/cylinder, for the wheels of all the cars, the braking effect will be much higher on partially loaded and empty cars than on fully loaded cars. Obviously, as would be expected, this situation is undesirable.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a railway vehicle brake system equipped with a control device engageable with a predetermined portion of such railway car for compensating braking force in response to a load carried by such railway car. The control device includes a sensor mechanism engageable with a truck bolster or a movable car structure for sensing a vertical position thereof corresponding to a load carried by the railway car. There is a control valve engageable with the sensor mechanism which generates a fluid pressure signal responsive to such load. A pneumatic actuator engageable with a<br><br>
predetermined brake beam disposed on such truck assembly and connected to such control valve. This pneumatic actuator generates a predetermined braking force responsive to the fluid pressure signal and further responsive to the load carried by the railway car as sensed by the sensor mechanism. In a first embodiment, the fluid pressure signal is responsive to a railway car carrying an empty load and a load greater than such empty load. The control valve being a directional flow control valve, generates a first fluid pressure signal corresponding to such empty load and a combination of such first fluid pressure signal and a second fluid pressure signal corresponding to a load greater than the empty load. Accordingly, the pneumatic actuator is adapted with a first actuating means receiving such first fluid pressure signal for generating a braking force corresponding to the railway car carrying an empty load and a second actuating means receiving such second fluid pressure signal substantially simultaneous to such first actuating means receiving such first fluid pressure signal and resulting in generation of a braking force corresponding to the load being greater than the empty load. In a second embodiment, the control valve is a metering flow control valve and generates a pressure fluid signal incrementally proportional to the load carried by such railway car. Accordingly, the pneumatic actuator receives a proportionally adjusted fluid pressure and generates corresponding proportionally adjusted braking force. Such predetermined braking force may be proportionally adjusted to variations in the load carried by the railway car.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, one of the primary objects of the present invention to provide a brake system for wheel trucks of the railway car which automatically compensates for different loads carried by the railway car and imposed on the trucks.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a brake system for wheel trucks of the railway car which insures uniform braking forces for different car loads.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide a simple, light weight truck mounted brake system for wheel trucks which uses standard truck components and brake beams, provides high braking efficiency, and includes automatic slack adjustment for brake shoe wear in addition to compensating for car loading.<br>
Although a number of objects and advantages of the present invention have been described in some detail above, various additional objects and advantages of the brake cylinder of the present invention will become more readily apparent to those persons who are skilled in the art from the following more detailed description of the invention, particularly,<br><br>
such detailed description is taken in conjunction with both the attached drawing figures and with the appended claims.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a perspective view of a prior art type truck mounted brake assembly;<br>
FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a prior art type car mounted brake assembly;<br>
FIG. 3 is a schematic representation for a brake system having a car load compensation arrangement according to one embodiment of the present invention;<br>
FIG. 4 is a schematic representation for a brake system having a car load compensation arrangement according to another embodiment of the present invention; and<br>
FIG. 5 is a schematic representation for a brake system having a car load compensation arrangement according to yet another embodiment of the present invention. DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PRESENTLY PREFERRED AND VARIOUS ALTERNATIVE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Prior to proceeding with the more detailed description of the invention, a description of a car mounted and truck mounted braking system and their functioning should provide helpful in understanding the present invention. Also, it should be noted that for the sake of clarity, identical components which have identical functions have been identified with identical reference numerals throughout the several views illustrated in the attached drawing figures.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1 there is shown a truck assembly, generally designated 10, for a railway car 2. Such truck assembly 10 comprises a pair of side frames, one of which is shown as 12, a wheel and axle set 14, at each end of the truck side frames 12 and a partially shown truck bolster member 16 movably attached to such truck side frames 12. Generally, in operation, side frames 12 remain stationary with respect to the wheel and axle set 14, while the bolster member 16 is allowed to move vertically in response to a load carried by the railway car 2. When the load of such railway car increases, the bolster member 16 moves downwardly until the maximum load is reached. A.S the load decreases, the bolster member 16 moves upwardly and returns to its original vertical position, as the entire load is removed form the railway car 2.<br>
Disposed within the truck assembly 10 is an example of a truck mounted brake assembly, generally designated 20. This particular type of truck mounted brake assembly 20 includes a pair of brake beams 22 and 24 substantially parallel to such bolster member 16, a strut member 25 secured to each of the brake beams 22 and 24 and a brake head 30 attached to each end of each of the brake beams 22 and 24. Each of the brake heads 30 carry a brake<br><br>
shoe 32 thereon and arc positioned for engagement with a respective railway car wheel 15 during a brake application.<br>
The truck mounted brake assembly 20 further includes a pneumatic actuator 34 connected to such brake beams 22 and 24 with a pair of force transmitting members 36 and 38, each passing through a respective one of a pair of openings (not shown) in the bolster, with force transmitting member 36 being a well known slack adjuster, and a pair of force transmitting levers 40 and 42. During a braking situation wherein a force is applied by the pneumatic actuator 34, these force transmitting members 36 and 38 and force transmitting levers 40 and 42 transmit and deliver braking forces to the brake beams 22 and 24 and, consequently, to the brake heads 30 and brake shoes 32 mounted thereon.<br>
In a particular reference to FIG. 2 there is shown a car mounted brake assembly, generally designated 50, for a railway car 2 having a pair of truck assemblies 10 disposed at each end thereof. The car mounted brake assembly 50 includes a pneumatic actuator 52, a slack adjuster 54 and two pairs of brake beams 22 and 24 mounted at each end of the car mounted brake assembly 5O These brake beams 22 and 24 are actuated by the pneumatic actuator 52 via a series of levers and linkages.<br>
Brake levers are used throughout the braking system to transmit, increase, or decrease braking force, as well as to transfer or change direction of force. There are two basic categories of levers. The first category is body levers such as a cylinder lever 56 and a rulcrumed lever 58. The second category of levers is truck levers, such as live lever 60 and dead lever 62. Truck lever connections, or bottom rods 64, are provided which can extend through the truck 1I. This rod 64 is used to transfer the force from the live lever 60 to the dead lever 62. A top rod 66 connects the truck levers 60 and 62 with the body levers 56 and 58 and a center rod 68 connects the two body levers 56 and 58. Thus, during a braking situation, a force is applied by the pneumatic actuator 52 and these levers and rods transmit and deliver braking forces to the brake beams 22 and 24 and, consequently, to the brake heads 30 and brake shoes 32 mounted thereon.<br>
The fluid pressure to the actuators 34 of FIG. 1 and 52 of FIG. 2 is provided cither by the brake hose 4 or by the emergency reservoir 6.<br>
In the first embodiment of the present invention, best shown in FIG. 3, there is means, generally designated 100, for sensing a load on the railway car 2 and generating at least one control signal responsive to such load. Preferably, such means 100 is a valve means which includes a linearly movable means 110 cooperating with a predetermined portion 3, vertically movable, of the railway car 2 or the movable bolster member 16 to sense a vertical<br><br>
position thereof and means, generally designated 120, attached directly to the side frame 12 or to an intermediate member (not shown) attached to such side frame 12 and engageable with or conncctablc to such sensor means 110 (o generate at least one control signal responsive to the position of such predetermined portion 3 or the bolster member 16.<br>
It will be appreciated that the mounting of the sensor means 110 and signal generating means 120 may be reversed without affecting operation of the present invention.<br>
Preferably, the sensor means 110 is provided with a member, such as roller 112, attached to one end thereof for minimizing factional forces during the movement of such predetermined vertically movable portion 3.<br>
In further reference to FIG. 3, the signal generating means 120 is a directional flow control valve operable between a first flow condition and a second flow condition and biased for movement into one of the first and second flow conditions by a bias spring 122. Flow control valve 120 has an inlet port 124 connected to a source of fluid pressure, such as brake pipe 4, .and a pair of outlet ports 126 and 128 for generating a fluid pressure signal. In the first flow condition, only the first outlet port 126 is enabled to pass the fluid pressure which enters the valve through the inlet port 124 while the second outlet port 128 is allowed to vent to outside through a vent port 130. In the second flow condition, the fluid pressure exits the flow control valve 120 through both outlet ports 126 and 128 while the vent port 130 is blocked.<br>
In the first embodiment of the present invention, either the brake system 20 of FIG. 1 or the brake system 50 of FIG. 2 is provided with an actuator, generally designated 140, which is a cylinder 140 having a housing 142 with a first chamber 144 and a second chamber 146 sealed therebetween and separated by rigidly held partition 147. A first piston 148, disposed within the first chamber 144, and a second piston 150, disposed within the second chamber 146, arc rigidly attached to a common rod 152 for reciprocal movement therewith. One end of the rod 152 is attached to the force transmitting lever 40 of FIG. 1 or the body lever 56 of FIG. 2. A spring means 154 having a predetermined spring rate is engageable with one of the rod 152, first piston 148, second piston 150 and any combination thereof for limiting the brake force being generated by each of the brake shoes 32 and for returning such first piston 148 and second piston 150 into an initial non-actuated position.<br>
The first chamber 144 has an inlet port 156 connectable to the first outlet port 126 of the control valve 120 via the first control line 158 and the second chamber 146 has an inlet port 160 connectable to the second outlet port 128 of the control valve 120 via the<br><br>
second control line 162, Both first and second chambers 144 and 146 respectively are vented to atmosphere through their respective outlet ports 164 and 166.<br>
In operation, when the railway car 2 is empty, the flow control valve 120 will be in the first flow condition and will pass fluid pressure, upon initiation of the braking sequence, through the first output port 126 thus generating a first control fluid pressure signal received at the inlet port 156 of the first chamber 144 through the first control line 158. Subsequently, fluid pressure will be generated at one surface of the first piston 148. The resulting movement of the first and second pistons 148 and 150 respectively will enable actuator 140 to generate a first predetermined braking force responsive to the first flow condition of the flow control valve 120 which will be transferred by the rod 152 to a linkage within the brake system and further to each of the brake shoes 32, wherein the first predetermined braking force will be sufficient to ce-se movement of the railway car 2 having no load. Advantageously, the predetermined spring rate of the spring means 154 is selected to resist further movement of the first and second pistons 148 and 150, respectively, prevent an additional braking force being generated by each of the brake shoe 32 and return first and second pistons 148 and 150, respectively, to an initial position during a brake release sequence.<br>
As the load of the railway car 2 increases, its structure will move downwardly causing movement of the sensor means 110 enabling the flow control valve 120 to switch into a second flow condition. In such second flow condition, the fluid pressure will be passed through the first outlet port 126 and through the first control line 158 generating a first control fluid signal received at the inlet port 156 of the first chamber 144 of the actuator 140 and, simultaneously, the fluid pressure will be passed through the second outlet port 128 generating a second control fluid pressure signal received at the inlet port 160 of the second chamber 146 of the actuator 140. Subsequently, the actuator 140 will generate the fluid pressure at one surface of each of the first and second pistons 148 and 150 respectively. It will be appreciated that such actuator 140 will genetate a second predetermined braking force sufficient to cease movement of the railway car 2 carrying a load. It will be understood that such second predetermined braking force will be greater than the first predetermined braking force responsive to railway car 2 carrying an empty load.<br>
In a second embodiment of the present invention, best shown in FIG. 4, either the brake system 20 of FIG. 1 or the brake system 50 of FIG. 2 is provided with an actuator, generally designated 180, comprising a first air spring actuator 182 having an inlet port 184 connectable to first outlet port 126 of the flow control valve 120 via the first control line 158.<br><br>
Such first air spring actuator 182 is disposed within a second air spring actuator 188 which has an inlet port 190 coruiectable lo the second outlet port 128 of the flow control valve 120 via the second control line 162. The first and second air spring actuators 182 and 188 are attached to a rigidly disposed mounting means 194 at one end and to a push rod 196 at a distal end.<br>
In operation, when the railway car 2 is at its empty load weight, the flow control valve 120 will be in the first flow condition and will pass fluid pressure, upon initiation of the braking sequence, through the first output port 126 through the first control line 158 resulting in generation of a first control fluid signal received at the inlet port 184 of the first air spring actuator 182 which causing it to generate a first predetermined braking force sufficient to cease movement of the railway car 2 carrying no load.<br>
The downward movement of the structure of the railway car 2 will cause upward movement of the sensor means 110 enabling the control valve 120 to switch into a second flow condition. In such second flow condition, the fluid pressure will be passed from the first outlet port 126 to the first control line 158 generating a first control fluid signal received at the inlet port 184 of the first air spring actuator 182 and, simultaneously, the fluid pressure will be passed from the second outlet port 128 generating a second control fluid signal received at the inlet port 190 of second air spring actuator 188 which will generate a second predetermined pressure responsive to the second position of the flow control valve 120 and, more particularly, such actuator 180 will generate a second braking force by each of the brake shoes 32 sufficient cease movement of the railway car 2 carrying a load.<br>
Alternatively, such actuator 180 may be a brake cylinder with a dual piston arrangement as taught in U.S. Patent No. 6,269,916 to Daughcrty, Jr and owned by assignee of the present invention. The teaching of U.S. Patent No. 6,269,916 is incorporated into this document by reference thereto.<br>
In a third embodiment of the present invention, best shown in FIG, 5, there is a means, generally designated 200, for sensing a load on the railway car 2, which includes linearly movable sensor means 210 cooperating with a predetermined portion 3, vertically movable, of the railway car 2 to sense the positio.. of such predetermined portion 3 and means, generally designated 220, attached to a rigid structure and engageable with such sensor means 210 to generate at least one control signal proportional to the position of such predetermined portion 3.<br>
In such embodiment, the signal generating means 200 is a metering control valve 200 including a housing 222, a stem 224 mounted for linear reciprocal movement<br><br>
within the housing 222 arid conncctable to means 210 at one end. The other end of the stem 224 is adapted with a seat means 226 engageable with an orifice 228. There is an inlet port 230 connected to the source of fluid pressure, such as brake pipe 4, and an outlet port 232 having a connection with cither the actuator 34 of the brake system 20 of FIG. 1 or the actuator 52 of the brake system 50 of FIG. 2. A spring means 234 is provided to bias the scat means 226 for cooperation with the orifice 228.<br>
The incremental variation in a load carried by the railway car 2 will move the stem 224 and incrementally vary the passage of the fluid pressure received at the inlet port 230 through the orifice 22 &amp; thus providing a predetermined fluid pressufiTSrflie outlet port 232 which is proportional to the load of the railway car 2.<br>
Advantageously, the use of a metering control valve 220 enables utilization of the currently used pneumatic actuators thus-providing for cost advantage in controlling the braking force at the brake shoe.<br>
Those skilled in the art will readily understand that each truck mounted brake assembly 20 of FIG. 1 may be equipped with.£.oM0<rneans of fig. or thescj>^oAjneans 200 of FIG. 5 providing for independent control of the braking forces at each truck assembly 11 which is advantageous in conditions where a load at one end of the railway car 2 is different than the load at the other end of the railway car 2.<br>
Although the present invention has been shown in terms of the car load sensing means directly contacting a vertically movable portion of such railway car structure or the bolster member of the truck assembly, it will be apparent-to these skilled in the art, that the present invention may be applied to other non-contact sensing means well known in the art which are either integral to the signal generating means or disposed remotely therefrom and connected thereto. For example, the sensing means may be a welF known optical or ultrasonic non contact sensor sensing at least one target and producing an electrical signal which is received by a control valve having an electrically operable actuation means.<br>
Furthermore, the signal geTTeTating means may be adapted to generate an electrical signal in applications using an electrically operable device, for example such as an electrically actuated valve or an electrically driven motor, to initiate and generate braking force.<br>
Additionally, although the present invention has been shown in terms of a well known-IMX.RTM. or UBX.R1M. type of truck mounted braking system (TMX.RTM. and UBX.RTM are registered trademarks of Westinghouse Airbrake Company, the assignee of the present invention), Ihe present invention may be applied to other types of brake systems,<br><br>
for example, a disk type brake system employed to individually apply brake force to each wheel in response to receiving a supply of fluid pressure.<br>
Thus, the present invention has been described in such full, clear, concise and exact terms as to enable any person skilled in the art to which it pertains to make and use the same. It will be understood that variations, modifications, equivalents and substitutions for components of the specifically described embodiments of the invention may be made by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as set forth in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
