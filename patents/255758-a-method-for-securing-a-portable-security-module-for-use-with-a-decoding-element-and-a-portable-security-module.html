				<td>Background of Invention<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The invention relates generally to portable security modules adapted to<br>
descramble scrambled audiovisual information.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] Transmission of encrypted data is well-known in the field of pay TV<br>
systems, where scrambled audiovisual information is usually broadcast by<br>
terrestrial emitters, satellite or through a cable network to a number of<br>
subscribers, each subscriber possessing a decoder or receiver/decoder capable of<br>
descrambling the scrambled audiovisual information for subsequent viewing.<br>
[0003] In a typical system, the scrambled audiovisual information may be<br>
descrambled using a control word. In order to try to improve the security of the<br>
system, the control word is usually changed every ten seconds or so. Every 10<br>
seconds, each subscriber receives, in an ECM (Entitlement Control Message), the<br>
control word necessary to descramble the scrambled audiovisual information so<br>
as to permit viewing of the transmission.<br>
[0004] The control word itself is encrypted by an exploitation key and transmitted<br>
in encrypted form in the ECM. The scrambled audiovisual information and the<br>
encrypted control word are received by a decoder, which in the case of a paid-up<br>
subscriber, has access to the exploitation key stored on a portable security<br>
module, e.g., a smart card, inserted in the decoder. The encrypted control word is<br>
decrypted using the exploitation key by the smartcard. The smartcard transmits<br>
the control word to the decoder. The scrambled audiovisual information is<br>
descrambled using the decrypted control word by the decoder. The decoder is<br>
indeed powerful enough to provide a real-time descrambling of the scrambled<br>
audiovisual information.<br>
[0005] The exploitation key is itself periodically changed, e.g. every month or so.<br>
An EMM (Entitlement Management Message) is monthly received by the<br>
decoder and is transmitted in the smartcard. The EMM contains the exploitation<br>
key in an encoded form. A group key assigned to the smartcard enables to<br>
decode the encoded exploitation key.<br>
[0006] The decoder hence regularly sends command messages to the smartcard.<br>
[0007] The command message may be an ECM, i.e. the decoder transmits to the<br>
smartcard a control word in an encrypted form. The smartcard decrypts the<br>
control word using the exploitation key. The transmitting of the control word<br>
typically occurs every 10 seconds.<br>
[0008] If a viewer person zaps from a first channel to a second channel, the<br>
decoder transmits to the smartcard a second control word in an encrypted form<br>
after a transmitting of a first control word in an encrypted form. The first control<br>
word and the second control word respectively correspond to the first channel<br>
and to the second channel. The smartcard may hence receive Entitlement Control<br>
Messages more frequently than every 10 seconds due to the zapping of channels.<br>
[0009] The command message may also be an EMM, i.e. the decoder transmits to<br>
the smartcard an exploitation key in an encoded form, or any other command<br>
message from the decoder.<br>
[0010] FIG. 1 schematically illustrates a smartcard according to prior art The<br>
smartcard 11 is activated by a receiving of a message, e.g. an Entitlement Control<br>
Message ECMn from a decoder (not represented): the decoder acts as a master<br>
and the smartcard 11 as a slave. A processing unit 12 of the smartcard only<br>
executes the command messages received from the decoder. The smartcard 11<br>
comprises a parameters memory, e.g. an EEPROM 13, into which parameters are<br>
stored. The processing unit 12 may check that the parameters stored into the<br>
EEPROM 13 are correct. The parameters may be for example a size of the<br>
Entitlement Control Messages to be received. The processing unit may check that<br>
the received Entitlement Control Message ECMn has a proper size before<br>
decrypting an encrypted control word contained in the received Entitlement<br>
Control Message ECMn.<br>
[0011] A smartcard is generally intended to communicate with a single decoder.<br>
However, a fraudulous user may attempt to set up a server between a single<br>
smartcard and a plurality of decoders. The server may be a splitter that<br>
communicates with the plurality of decoders directly, e.g. via an electrical wire.<br>
The server may also be a Control Word server that communicates with the<br>
plurality of decoders via a network, e.g. an Internet network.<br>
[0012] FIG. 2 schematically illustrates an example of a splitter configuration<br>
according to prior art.<br>
[0013] A first decoder 24A continuously receives a first scrambled audiovisual<br>
information ECW1(m1) corresponding to a first channel. A second decoder 24B<br>
continuously receives a second scrambled audiovisual information ECW2(m2)<br>
corresponding to a second channel. The first decoder 24A and the second<br>
decoder 24B respectively allow to provide a real-time descrambling of the first<br>
scrambled audiovisual information ECW1(m1) and of the second scrambled<br>
audiovisual information ECW2(m2).<br>
[0014] The first scrambled audiovisual information ECW1(m1) and the second<br>
scrambled audiovisual information ECW2(m2) are respectively descrambled using<br>
a first control word CW1 stored in a first memory 25A of the first decoder 24A<br>
and a second control word CW2 stored in a second memory 25B of the second<br>
decoder 24B.<br>
[0015] At each cryptoperiod, i.e. every 10 seconds for example, the first decoder<br>
24A and the second decoder 24B respectively receive a first Entitlement Control<br>
Message ECM1 and a second Entitlement Control Message ECM2.<br>
[0016] In a splitter configuration, the first decoder 24A and the second decoder<br>
24B respectively transmit the first Entitlement Control Message ECM1 and the<br>
second Entitlement Control Message ECM2 to a single server e.g. a splitter 22<br>
during a single cryptoperiod.<br>
[0017] The splitter 22 forwards one of the transmitted Entitlement Control<br>
Messages, e.g. ECM1, to a single portable security module, e.g. a smartcard 21.<br>
Using an exploitation key stored into a smartcard memory 26, the smartcard<br>
decrypts the corresponding control word, e.g. CW1, upon receiving of the<br>
forwarded Entitlement Control Message (ECM1). The corresponding control<br>
word CW1 is transmitted to the splitter 22. Once the splitter 22 receives the<br>
transmitted control word CW1, the splitter 22 forwards a distinct entitlement<br>
control message among the transmitted Entitlement Control Messages, e.g.<br>
ECM2, to the smartcard 21. The smartcard decrypts the corresponding control<br>
word, e.g. CW2, upon receiving of the forwarded Entitlement Control Message<br>
(ECM2). The corresponding control word CW2 is transmitted to the splitter 22.<br>
[0018] The splitter 22 forwards the decrypted control words CW1 and CVV2<br>
respectively to the first decoder 24A and to the second decoder 24B.<br>
[0019] The server allows a plurality of decoders to descramble scrambled<br>
audiovisual information with a single smartcard.<br>
[0020] Summarizing, a paid-up subscriber generally possesses a single portable<br>
security module, e.g. a smartcard. However, a server as described for the setup of<br>
the fraudulous user, e.g. a splitter or a Control Word server, allows a plurality of<br>
decoders to descramble scrambled audiovisual information with a single<br>
smartcard. It is hence possible for the paid-up subscriber to provide an access to<br>
audiovisual information dedicated to the paid-up subscriber to one or more<br>
unauthorized users that do not possess any smartcard.<br>
[0021] There is a need for a method allowing to discourage a use of a server in a<br>
splitter configuration. However, a regular paid-up subscriber possessing a<br>
decoder that communicates directly with a smartcard should not encounter<br>
problems.<br>
[0022] A first method may consist in implementing a slowing software into<br>
smartcards, wherein the slowing software allows to slow down a processing of<br>
each smartcard. The smartcards may hence not be able' to decrypt more than one<br>
control word during a cryptoperiod, e.g. 10 seconds.<br>
[0023] A second method may consist in emitting Entitlement Control Messages at<br>
shorter cryptoperiods, e.g. every 3 seconds.<br>
[0024] Both the first method and the second method allow to restrict processing to<br>
a single ECM per cryptoperiod. As a consequence the server will generally fail to<br>
synchronize communications between a plurality of decoders and a single<br>
smartcard. Only a single decoder may function correctly with the single<br>
smartcard.<br>
[0025] However, if a regular paid-up subscriber possessing a single decoder zaps<br>
from one channel to an other channel at a relatively high zapping rate, the<br>
smartcard may also fail to decrypt a plurality of received ECM per cryptoperiod.<br>
The regular paid-up subscriber may hence be prevented from zapping between<br>
various offered audiovisual information. Typically, a screen of the regular paid-<br>
up subscriber may turn blank at a zapping action even if the subscriber is a<br>
regular paid-up subscriber.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
[0026] In a first aspect, the invention provides a method for securing a portable<br>
security module for use with a decoding element, the portable security module<br>
and the decoding element allowing to descramble scrambled audiovisual<br>
information. The method comprises processing at the portable security module<br>
Entitlement Control Messages (ECMs) received at the portable security module<br>
to allow the descrambling of the scrambled audiovisual information. The method<br>
further comprises analyzing at the portable security module a sequence of ECMs,<br>
the sequence of ECMs comprising a new ECM and a previous ECM received at a<br>
previous time, the ECMs of the sequence being received at the portable security<br>
module at distinct times, the analyzing being performed at the receiving of the<br>
new ECM. An error register is incremented at the analyzing upon a determined<br>
result of the analyzing and a penalty applied to the portable security module<br>
depending on a value of the error register by introducing a dead time at the<br>
processing so as to slow down the processing.<br>
[0027] In a first preferred embodiment, the ECMs are replaced with Entitlement<br>
Management Messages (EMMs).<br>
[0028] In a second preferred embodiment, the dead time has a duration that<br>
depends on a value of the error register.<br>
[0029] In a third preferred embodiment, the duration of the dead time is shorter<br>
than a maximum time value. The maximum time value is high enough to prevent<br>
the portable security module from processing more than one Entitlement Control<br>
Message during a single cryptoperiod.<br>
[0030] In a fourth preferred embodiment, each Entitlement Control Message<br>
comprises a channel identifier. The channel identifier is associated to a<br>
determined channel. The analyzing of the sequence of ECMs comprises<br>
comparing the channel identifier of the new ECM and the channel identifier of<br>
the previous ECM.<br>
[0031] In a fifth preferred embodiment, each Entitlement Control Message<br>
comprises a first encrypted Control Word and a second encrypted Control Word.<br>
The first Control Word allows to descramble the scrambled audiovisual<br>
information during a first cryptoperiod and the second Control Word allows to<br>
descramble the scrambled audiovisual information during a second cryptoperiod<br>
distinct from the first cryptoperiod. The analyzing of the sequence of ECMs<br>
comprises comparing a second Control Word of the previous ECM to a first<br>
Control Word of the new E C M.<br>
[0032] In a sixth preferred embodiment, the analyzing of the sequence of ECMs<br>
comprises comparing a determined content of a first ECM of the sequence of<br>
ECMs to a second determined content of a second ECM of the sequence of<br>
ECMs.<br>
[0033] In a seventh preferred embodiment, a reset dead time is introduced upon a<br>
reset at each processing of the Entitlement Control Messages. The reset dead<br>
time has a duration that depends on a number of Entitlement Control Messages<br>
received at the portable security module after the reset. The duration is equal to a<br>
first reset time value at a first processing immediately following the reset. The<br>
first reset time value is smaller than the maximum time value.<br>
[0034] In an eighth preferred embodiment, the nature of a further reset is evaluated<br>
according to an intermediate group of intermediate command messages. The<br>
intermediate group comprises the command messages received after a previous<br>
reset preceding the further reset.<br>
[0035] In a ninth preferred embodiment, the number of the intermediate ECMs is<br>
counted. The number of the intermediate ECMs is compared to a reset threshold<br>
number. A result of the comparing allows to evaluate the nature of the further<br>
reset. A reset error register is incremented upon the further reset if the further<br>
reset is evaluated as suspicious. The portable security module is blocked if the<br>
reset error register has a value that is higher than a reset errors threshold.<br>
[0036] Preferably, the portable security module is a smartcard and the decoding<br>
element is a decoder.<br>
[0037] In a second aspect the invention provides a portable security module for use<br>
with a decoding element, wherein the portable security module and the decoding<br>
element allow to descramble scrambled audiovisual information. The portable<br>
security module comprises receiving means to receive Entitlement Control<br>
Messages (ECMs) and processing means to process an ECM received at the<br>
portable security module so as to allow the descrambling of the scrambled<br>
audiovisual information. The portable security module further comprises a<br>
command message memory into which a previous ECM received at a previous<br>
time may be stored, and analyzing means to analyze a sequence of ECMs, the<br>
sequence of ECMs comprising a new ECM and the previous ECM, the ECMs of<br>
the sequence being received at the portable security module at distinct times, and<br>
the analyzing being performed at each receiving of a new ECM. The portable<br>
security module further comprises comparing means to compare the new ECM<br>
and the previous ECM of the sequence of ECMs, an error register, incrementing<br>
means to increment the error register depending on a result of the comparing, and<br>
delaying means to introduce a dead time at each processing so as to slow down<br>
the processing.<br>
[0038] In a tenth preferred embodiment, the delaying means also allow upon a<br>
reset to introduce a reset dead time at each processing following the reset. The<br>
reset dead time has a duration that depends on a number of processing following<br>
the reset. The duration is equal to a first reset time value at a first processing<br>
immediately following the reset.<br>
[0039] In an eleventh preferred embodiment, the portable security module further<br>
comprises a count register allowing to store a number of intermediate ECMs. The<br>
intermediate ECMs are received at the portable security module after a previous<br>
reset The portable security module further comprises a flag. The flag has a value<br>
that depends on a result of a comparing of the count register to a reset threshold<br>
number. A reset error register is incremented depending on the value of the flag<br>
upon a further reset. Blocking means allow to block the portable security module<br>
according to a value of the reset error register.<br>
[0040] In a twelfth preferred embodiment, the ECMs are replaced by Entitlement<br>
Management Messages (EMMs).<br>
[0041] In a third aspect, the invention provides a software for use within a portable<br>
security module. The software allows to implement the method of the first aspect<br>
of the present invention.<br>
[0042] In a fourth aspect, the invention provides a method for securing a portable<br>
security module. The method comprises downloading a software according to the<br>
third aspect of the present invention at manufacturing.<br>
[0043] In a fifth aspect, the invention provides a method for securing a portable<br>
security module. The method comprises downloading a software according to the<br>
third aspect of the present invention. The downloading comprises receiving at the<br>
portable security module at least one configuration message from the decoding<br>
element.<br>
[0044] Other aspects and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the<br>
following description and the appended claims.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
[0054] Overview of the invention<br>
[0055] FIG. 3 illustrates an example of a portable security module according to the<br>
present invention. A portable security module 31, e.g. a smartcard, is intended to<br>
be used with a decoding element (not represented), e.g. a decoder. The portable<br>
security module and the decoding element allow to descramble scrambled<br>
audiovisual information. The portable security module 31 receives a plurality of<br>
messages, e.g. Entitlement Control Messages. The portable security module<br>
allows to process each received Entitlement Control Message ECMn+1 so as to<br>
extract a Control Word CWn+1 to be sent to the decoder.<br>
[0056] Similar to the portable security module from prior art, the smartcard 31<br>
according to the present invention may comprise a processing unit 32 that only<br>
processes the Entitlement Control Messages or other messages received at the<br>
portable security module. The portable security module 31 may comprise a<br>
parameters memory, e.g. an EEPROM 33, into which parameters are stored. The<br>
processing unit 32 may check that the parameters stored into the EEPROM 33<br>
are correct.<br>
[0057] The portable security module 31 of the present invention comprises<br>
analyzing means 35 to analyze a sequence of command messages (CMn+1, CMn).<br>
The command messages of the sequence (CMn+1, CMn) are received at the<br>
portable security module 31 at distinct times.<br>
[0058] Typically, the analyzing is performed each time that a new command<br>
message CMn+1 is received. The sequence of command messages comprises the<br>
new command message CMn+1 and a previous command message CMn. that may<br>
for example be received immediately before the new command message CMn+1.<br>
The sequence of command messages may further comprise at least one further<br>
command message.<br>
[0059] The analyzing may comprise comparing a determined content of the<br>
command messages of the sequence of command messages (CMn+1, CMn). An<br>
error register 37 may be incremented upon a determined result of the comparing.<br>
[0060] The smartcard of the present invention hence allows to extract information,<br>
e.g. a value of the error register 37, the extracted information being relative to<br>
command messages that are received before the new command message CMn+1.<br>
A penalty may be applied to the smartcard 31 depending on a value of the error<br>
register 37. Such a method according to the present invention allows, unlike the<br>
first method and the second method, to avoid to harm a regular paid-up<br>
subscriber possessing a single decoder that zaps from a channel to an other at a<br>
relatively high zapping rate.<br>
[0061] The smartcard 31 may further comprise a command message memory 36<br>
into which at least one command message among the sequentially received<br>
messages may be stored. The command message memory 36 may be distinct<br>
from a central processing unit 34 that comprises the processing unit 32 and the<br>
analyzing means 35.<br>
[0062] Alternatively, the command message memory may be for example a part of<br>
the analyzing means : typically, the command message memory may be a single<br>
register of the analyzing means or of any other processing means.<br>
[0063] The analyzing means 35 may be an hardware device distinct from the<br>
processing unit 32, as represented on FIG. 3. Preferably, the analyzing means are<br>
an analyzing software that is implemented into the smartcard. The central<br>
processing unit comprises a processing software and an analyzing software.<br>
[0064] FIG. 4 illustrates an example of an algorithm to be executed by a smartcard<br>
according to the present invention. The smartcard receives a message. The<br>
received message may be a command message, e.g. an ECM, an EMM, or any<br>
other determined message. When a new command message CMn+1 is received<br>
(box 401), an analyzing of a sequence of command messages is performed.<br>
Typically, the new command message CMn+1 is compared to a previous<br>
command message CMn received at an earlier time (box 402). The comparing of<br>
the new command message CMn+1 to the previous command message CMn may<br>
consists in comparing a determined portion of each command message (CMn<br>
CMn+1), e.g. an identifier. The comparing may also consist in comparing an<br>
extracted information of each command message (CMn, CMn+1), e.g. a control<br>
word decrypted by the smartcard<br>
[0065] An error register error_reg may be incremented according to a result of the<br>
comparing (box 403). The algorithm further comprises introducing a dead time t<br>
at each processing of the Entitlement Control Messages received at the smartcard<br>
(box 404). Such a dead time penalty allows to slow down the smartcard. In the<br>
method of the present invention, the dead time r has a duration that depends on a<br>
value of the error register errorjreg. Typically, a duration of the dead time r<br>
increases with the value of the error register error_reg.<br>
[0066] In a case of a splitter configuration, the smartcard receives more than one<br>
ECM per cryptoperiod. The smartcard processes each received ECM so as to<br>
allow a descrambling of the scrambled audiovisual information. However, if the<br>
analyzing detects a problem at each cryptoperiod, e.g. every 10 seconds, the error<br>
register errorjreg may have a relatively high value. The dead time r hence has a<br>
relatively high duration, which may prevent the smartcard from processing more<br>
than one ECM at each cryptoperiod, thus disrupting a descrambling of a plurality<br>
of broadcasted audiovisual programs with a single smartcard.<br>
[0067] In a case of a regular paid-up subscriber possessing a regular decoding<br>
system, the regular paid-up subscriber may generate, when zapping from a<br>
channel to another, a few increments of the error register errorjreg. As a<br>
consequence, the dead time t is introduced as a penalty, but the dead time t has a<br>
relatively small duration. Such a short dead time allows the smartcard to process<br>
a single regular ECM from a single decoder during a cryptoperiod. The method<br>
according to the present invention only disrupts the descrambling with a non-<br>
authorized configuration, e.g. the splitter configuration.<br>
[0068] The value of the dead time t may be stored in a RAM memory. If, in the<br>
case of the non-authorized configuration, the descrambling is disrupted, an<br>
unauthorized user may reset the smartcard, so as to reset the value of the dead<br>
time r and allow an usual descrambling. The algorithm may hence comprise that<br>
the value of the dead time t is incremented by a reset dead time x_reset (box 406)<br>
upon a reset of the smartcard (box 405), The reset dead time x_reset may have a<br>
duration that depends on a number of ECM received at the smartcard following<br>
the reset. At a first processing that immediately follows the reset, the duration of<br>
the reset dead time T_reset may be equal to a first reset time value that is<br>
relatively high. The unauthorized user that resets the smartcard thus fails to<br>
obtain the regular descrambling.<br>
[0069] In addition to the slowing down of the smartcard, the applying a penalty<br>
may comprise a blocking of the smartcard As the smartcard analyses previous<br>
command messages, it is possible to adapt the penalty from the introduction of a<br>
relatively small dead time to the blocking of the card,<br>
[0070] Furthermore, a hacker may attack the smartcard with a high number of<br>
attack messages so as to extract essential parameters. In prior art, the smartcard<br>
fails to provide the analysis of the sequence of command messages. By providing<br>
an analysis of the sequence of command messages that are received at previous<br>
times, the method of the present invention allows to detect such an attack. The<br>
attack messages may indeed be relatively similar and the error register error_reg<br>
may have a relatively high value if an adequate analysis is performed. The<br>
penalties applied to the smartcard, e.g. the introducing of the dead time r or the<br>
blocking of the smartcard, may slow down or stop the attack.<br>
[0071] Analysis of a sequence of ECMs<br>
[0072] FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B illustrate an example of a sequence of command<br>
messages received by a portable security module according to the present<br>
invention. The illustrated sequence comprises two successive Entitlement<br>
Control Messages. The sequence of command messages of FIG. 5A is received<br>
by a portable security module, e.g. a smartcard, being used in a regular<br>
configuration. The sequence of command messages of FIG. 5B is received by a<br>
smartcard being used in a splitter configuration, or by a smartcard being used in a<br>
regular configuration if a regular paid-up subscriber zaps from a determined<br>
channel / to a second channel j substantially after the receiving of a previous<br>
Entitlement Control Message ECMn.<br>
[0073] The Entitlement Control Messages (54n, 54n+1) of both FIG. 5A and FIG.<br>
5B comprise a first encrypted control word (52n, 52n+1). The smartcard allows to<br>
decrypt the first encrypted control word (52n, 52n+1). The first Control Word<br>
CWi[1] extracted from the previous Entitlement Control Message ECMn allows a<br>
descrambling of scrambled audiovisual information of the determined channel i<br>
during a first cryptoperiod.<br>
[0074] In a first embodiment of the present invention, the Entitlement Control<br>
Messages (54n, 54n+1) further comprise a second encrypted control word (53n,<br>
53n+1). The smartcard allows to decrypt the second encrypted control word (53n,<br>
53n+1). The second Control Word CWi[2] extracted from the previous Entitlement<br>
Control Message ECMn allows a descrambling of scrambled audiovisual<br>
information of the determined channel 1 during a second cryptoperiod distinct<br>
from the first cryptoperiod. The second cryptoperiod may immediately follow the<br>
first cryptoperiod.<br>
[0075] In the case of the regular configuration, as illustrated in FIG. 5A, if the<br>
regular paid-up subscriber watches only programs of the determined channel, the<br>
second Control Word CWj[2] extracted from the previous Entitlement Control<br>
Message ECMn is similar to a first Control Word CWi[2] of the new Entitlement<br>
Control Message ECMn+1.<br>
[0076] In the case of a zapping substantially between the receiving of the previous<br>
Entitlement Control Message ECMn and the receiving of a further Entitlement<br>
Control Message ECM'n+1, as illustrated in FIG. 5B, the smartcard receives as a<br>
further Entitlement Control Message an Entitlement Control Message ECM'n+1<br>
that is associated to the second channel j that is distinct from the determined<br>
channel i. The second Control Word CWj[2] extracted from the previous<br>
Entitlement Control Message ECMn is hence different from to the first Control<br>
Word CWj[l] of the new Entitlement Control Message ECM'n+1.<br>
[0077] In the case of a splitter configuration, as illustrated in FIG. 5B, the<br>
smartcard receives Entitlement Control Messages from a plurality of decoders,<br>
each decoder allowing to descramble a flow of scrambled audiovisual<br>
information of a corresponding channel. If for example the splitter allows the<br>
smartcard to communicate with two decoders, the two corresponding channels<br>
are likely to be distinct as distinct users may not always watch same TV<br>
programs.<br>
[0078] If the corresponding channels are distinct, the Control Words allowing to<br>
descramble scrambled audiovisual information from each corresponding channel<br>
are distinct Therefore the second Control Word CWj[2] extracted from the<br>
previous Entitlement Control Message ECMn is hence different from to the first<br>
Control Word CWj[1] of the new Entitlement Control Message ECM'n+1.<br>
[0079] In the first embodiment, an analyzing of the sequence of command<br>
messages consists for example in comparing the second Control Word extracted<br>
from the previous Entitlement Control Message to the first Control Word of the<br>
new Entitlement Control Message. Such analysis may be performed at each<br>
receiving of a new Entitlement Control Message, or periodically.<br>
[0080] The previous Entitlement Control Message to which the new Entitlement<br>
Control Message is compared may be received immediately before the new<br>
Entitlement Control Message. Alternatively, in particular in a case of a double<br>
streaming, the previous Entitlement Control Message may be chosen according<br>
to a predetermined order.<br>
[0081] In a second embodiment of the present invention that is also illustrated in<br>
FIG. 5A and 5B, the received Entitlement Control Messages (54n, 54n+1)<br>
comprise a channel identifier (51n, 51n+1). The channel identifier 51n of the<br>
previous Entitlement Control Message 54„ is associated to the determined<br>
channel that the first control word CWi[1] allows to descramble.<br>
[0082] In the case of the regular configuration, as illustrated in FIG. 5A, if the<br>
regular paid-up subscriber does not zap substantially between the receiving of the<br>
previous Entitlement Control Message ECMn and the receiving of a new<br>
Entitlement Control Message ECMn+1, the scrambled audiovisual information<br>
from the determined channel only is descrambled. The channel identifier 51n of<br>
the previous Entitlement Control Message ECMn is hence similar to the channel<br>
identifier 51n+1 of the new Entitlement Control Message ECMn+1.<br>
[0083] In the case of a zapping substantially between the receiving of the previous<br>
Entitlement Control Message ECMn and the receiving of a further Entitlement<br>
Control Message ECM'n+1, as illustrated in FIG. 5B, the smartcard receives as a<br>
further Entitlement Control Message an Entitlement Control Message ECM'n+1<br>
that is associated to the second channel j that is distinct from the determined<br>
channel i. The channel identifier 51n of the previous Entitlement Control<br>
Message ECMn is hence different from the channel identifier 51n+1 of the new<br>
Entitlement Control Message ECM'n+1.<br>
[0084] In the case of a splitter configuration, also illustrated in FIG. 5B, the<br>
smartcard probably receives Entitlement Control Messages associated to at least<br>
two distinct channels, as explained in an above paragraph. The channel identifier<br>
51n of the previous Entitlement Control Message ECMn is thus different from the<br>
channel identifier 51n+1 of the new Entitlement Control Message ECM'n+1.<br>
[0085] In the second embodiment, an analyzing of the sequence of command<br>
messages consists for example in comparing the channel identifier of the<br>
previous Entitlement Control Message to the channel identifier of the new<br>
Entitlement Control Message. Such analysis may be performed at each receiving<br>
of a new ECM, or periodically. The previous Entitlement Control Message to<br>
which the new Entitlement Control Message is compared may be received<br>
immediately before the new Entitlement Control Message.<br>
[0086] In a case of a double stream, the second embodiment allows to detect no<br>
change of channel identifier in the regular configuration and at least one change<br>
of channel identifier in the splitter configuration. In this latter configuration,<br>
during a cryptoperiod, the smartcard receives at least:<br>
[0087] - a first ECM A associated to a first decoder and to a first stream;<br>
[0088] - a second ECM A' associated to the first decoder and to a second stream;<br>
[0089] - a third ECM B associated to a second decoder and to the first stream;<br>
[0090] - a fourth ECM B' associated to the second decoder and to the second<br>
stream.<br>
[0091] The first ECM, the second ECM, the third ECM and the fourth ECM may<br>
be received in the following order. A, A', B, B'. The analyzing detects at least<br>
one change of channel identifier. The analyzing detects at least three changes of<br>
channel identifier if the ECM, the second ECM, the third ECM and the fourth<br>
ECM are received in the following order: A, B, A', B'.<br>
[0092] In the case the double streaming in the regular configuration without<br>
zapping, only the first ECM A and the second ECM A' are received and no<br>
change of channel identifier is detected. In this latter case, a method according to<br>
the first embodiment of the present invention detects a change between the<br>
second Control Word of the previous Entitlement Control Message and the first<br>
Control Word of the new Entitlement Control Message. It is necessary to take<br>
into consideration the double streaming in the analyzing: the previous<br>
Entitlement Control Message is chosen according to a predetermined order. The<br>
second embodiment allows to avoid such a precaution.<br>
[0093] However, if a hacker attacks the smartcard with a high number of attack<br>
Entitlement Control Messages that are relatively similar, the method according to<br>
the first embodiment allows to detect a high number of changes between the<br>
second Control Word of the previous Entitlement Control Message and the first<br>
Control Word of the new Entitlement Control Message. The method of the<br>
second embodiment may detect no change in the channel identifiers.<br>
[0094] As illustrated in FIG. 5A and FIG. 5B, the received Entitlement Control<br>
Messages may comprise both the channel identifier (51n, 51n+1) and the second<br>
encrypted Control Word (53n, 53n+1). The comparing of the first embodiment and<br>
the comparing of the second embodiment may both be performed as an analyzing<br>
of the sequence of command messages.<br>
[0095] The analyzing may be performed on any other messages received at the<br>
smartcard, e.g. EMMs or reset messages. The analyzing may consist in<br>
comparing a determined content, e.g. a channel identifier, or an extracted<br>
information, e.g. a Control Word, of two command messages. If the compared<br>
determined contents/extracted information are different, an error register may be<br>
incremented. A penalty may be applied depending on a value of the error<br>
register. The applying a penalty typically comprises introducing a dead time at<br>
each processing of an Entitlement Control Message.<br>
[0096] Dead times management<br>
[0097] FIG. 6A illustrates a possible sequence of values of an error register in a<br>
portable security module according to the present invention.<br>
[0098] FIG. 6B illustrates a possible sequence of values of a duration of a dead<br>
time in a portable security module according to the present invention. The dead<br>
time sequence of FIG. 6B corresponds to the error register sequence of FIG. 6A.<br>
[0099] Both sequences are plotted as a function of a number of Entitlement Control<br>
Messages received after a reset.<br>
[00100] The illustrated sequences may be observed in a splitter configuration, or in<br>
a high zapping behavior of a regular paid-up subscriber. An analyzing of the<br>
received Entitlement Control Messages allows to detect differences in compared<br>
determined contents/extracted information of the sequentially received<br>
Entitlement Control Messages. During a first phase 61 following the reset, the<br>
error register is hence regularly incremented, e.g. at each receiving of one<br>
Entitlement Control Message.<br>
[00101] In the example illustrated in FIG. 6A and FIG. 6B, the dead time has a<br>
duration equal to zero if the value of the error register is smaller than a minimum<br>
threshold value C_min_thr, so as to avoid to harm the regular paid-up subscriber<br>
that zaps from one channel to an other channel.<br>
[00102] During a second phase 62, the value of the error register becomes equal to<br>
the minimum threshold C_min_thr; the duration of the dead time is hence non<br>
null and increases with the value of the error register. However, the duration of<br>
the dead time remains smaller than a maximum time value t_max corresponding<br>
to a maximum threshold value C_max_thr of the error register. The maximum<br>
time value t_max is high enough to prevent the smartcard from processing more<br>
than one Entitlement Control Message during a single cryptoperiod. In a case of<br>
a double streaming, wherein a given decoder sends a given number of<br>
Entitlement Control Messages at each cryptoperiod, the maximum time value<br>
t_max has a value that is high enough to prevent the processing of the given<br>
number of Entitlement Control Messages from a plurality of decoders. Typically,<br>
the smartcard may process only one given number of Entitlement Control<br>
Messages per cryptoperiod.<br>
[00103] If the dead time has a duration that is substantially equal to the maximum<br>
time value, the smartcard fails to allow the descrambling of a plurality of<br>
scrambled audiovisual information from a plurality of decoders. At least one<br>
unauthorized user, or a paid-up subscriber that shares its smartcard with the<br>
unauthorized user(s), may see a screen turn blank.<br>
[00104] A regular paid-up subscriber that zaps a lot from a channel to an other<br>
channel may generate an increase of the dead time and may see the screen turn<br>
blank during one cryptoperiod after an additional zapping. The regular paid-up<br>
subscriber may attribute the blank screen to a broadcast problem and may try to<br>
watch another channel, thus increasing the value of the error register. In the<br>
example illustrated in FIG. 6A, the value of the error register may always be<br>
below a maximum value C_max, so as to avoid over-punishing the smartcard.<br>
However, parameters such a the maximum time value t_max, the minimum<br>
threshold value C_min_thr etc. may be judicially chosen so as to avoid the<br>
regular paid-up subscribers to see the screens turn blank.<br>
[00105] The error register may go on increasing during a third phase 63 even if the<br>
duration of the dead time is equal to the maximum time value t_max, particularly<br>
in the case of the splitter configuration.<br>
[00106] The error register may be based on a circular principle: early increments<br>
that are generated by old Entitlement Control Messages are erased. For example,<br>
a circular register having a determined size may be used to evaluate the error<br>
register. Each time the analyzing is performed, binary values of the circular<br>
register are left shifted. The binary value at a former location at a left end of the<br>
circular register is hence erased. A new binary value that depends on a result of<br>
the analyzing is written at a now empty location at a right end of the circular<br>
register. Typically, a '1' may be written if a difference between compared<br>
determined contents/extracted information of the analyzed Entitlement Control<br>
Messages is detected, and a '0' may be written if not.<br>
[001071 The error register may have a value that equals a sum of the binary values<br>
of the circular register. The value of the error register is hence always smaller or<br>
equal to a maximum that corresponds to the size of the circular register : if equal,<br>
all the locations of the circular register are filled with '1'. The maximum may be<br>
the maximum value C_max represented in FIG. 6A.<br>
[00108] The value of the error register may also decrease if differences between the<br>
compared determined contents/extracted information of the analyzed Entitlement<br>
Control Messages are no longer detected, as represented in FIG. 6A. The<br>
decreasing may be due to various reasons. In the case of a splitter configuration,<br>
the unauthorized users may turn their decoders off. The regular paid-up<br>
subscriber may no longer zap etc.<br>
[00109] Alternatively, the error register may be a single integer that is incremented<br>
or decremented depending on a result of the analyzing of the sequence of<br>
command messages.<br>
[00110] As long as the value of the error register is higher than a decrease threshold,<br>
e.g. the maximum threshold value C_max_thr, the duration of the dead time<br>
remains equal to the maximum time value t_max.<br>
[00111] When, at a fourth phase 64, the value of error register becomes smaller than<br>
the maximum threshold value C_max_thr, the duration of the dead time begins<br>
decreasing.<br>
[00112] In the case of the splitter configuration, if the unauthorized user keeps his<br>
decoder on at the third phase 63, the duration of the dead time remains at the<br>
maximum time value t_max. If the unauthorized user turns his decoder on at the<br>
fourth phase 64, the error register starts to increase again (not represented<br>
sequence).<br>
[00113] The unauthorized user may also reset the smartcard at the third phase so as<br>
to reset the value of the duration of the dead time. The value of the duration of<br>
the dead time and the value of the error register may indeed be stored in a<br>
volatile memory that is erased upon a reset.<br>
[00114] FIG. 6C illustrates an example of a sequence of values of a duration of a<br>
dead time of a portable security module according to the present invention. The<br>
sequence is plotted as a function of a number of Entitlement Control Messages<br>
received after a reset. Unlike the example sequence illustrated in FIG. 6B, the<br>
example sequence of FIG. 6C has a non-null value immediately after the reset A<br>
reset dead time may be introduced at each processing of one Entitlement Control<br>
Message after the reset. The reset dead time has a duration that depends on a<br>
number of Entitlement Control Messages received at the smartcard after the<br>
reset. The duration of the reset dead time is equal to a first reset time value<br>
t_reset_max at a first processing that immediately follows the reset and<br>
decreases with the number of received Entitlement Control Messages.<br>
[001151 The introducing of the reset dead time and the introducing of the dead time<br>
may be implemented in a single software program : a total dead time may be<br>
equal to a sum of the reset dead time that may be read in an EEPROM and of the<br>
dead time that is evaluated from a circular register stored in a volatile memory.<br>
[00116] The smartcard processing is hence slowed down by the reset dead time<br>
upon a reset.<br>
[00117] The first reset time value t_reset_max is preferably smaller than a<br>
maximum time value t_max of the dead time, so as to avoid harming a regular<br>
paid-up subscriber after a regular reset, e.g. a reset due to a power cut.<br>
[00118] As the first reset time value t_reset_max is smaller than the maximum time<br>
value t_max, an unauthorized user may try to reset the smartcard every time the<br>
descrambling of the scrambled audiovisual information fails to function<br>
correctly. A hacker may even generate a reset of the smartcard at each<br>
cryptoperiod or so, in order to allow a correct descrambling or for an attack<br>
purpose.<br>
[00119] Smartcard blocking<br>
[00120] FIG. 7 illustrates an example of an algorithm to be implemented in a<br>
portable security module according to the present invention. The algorithm of<br>
FIG. 7 allows to evaluate a nature of a further reset according to an intermediate<br>
group of intermediate command messages. The intermediate group comprises a<br>
sequence of command messages, e.g. Entitlement Control Messages, received<br>
after a previous reset preceding the further reset.<br>
[00121] When a message is received at the smartcard, the smartcard tests whether<br>
the message is an ECM or not (box 71). If the message is an ECM, the smartcard<br>
processes the Entitlement Control Message, e.g. the smartcard decrypts an<br>
encrypted control word comprised within the Entitlement Control Message. A<br>
number of intermediate command messages is counted by incrementing a count<br>
register nb_ECM after each processing (box 72).<br>
[00122] The number of intermediate command messages is compared to a reset<br>
threshold number nb_ECM_min (box 73). A result of the comparing allows to<br>
evaluate the nature of the further reset: if the count register nbJECM equals the<br>
reset threshold number nb_ECM_min, a flag that has a NOK value, e.g. '0', after<br>
each reset (box 75) is set to an OK value, e.g.' 1' (box 74).<br>
[00123] If the count register nb_ECM is higher than the reset threshold number<br>
nb_ECM_min, the flag already has an OK value. If the count register nb_ECM is<br>
smaller than the reset threshold number nb_ECM_min, the flag has a NOK value.<br>
The value of the flag hence indicates whether the number of intermediate<br>
command messages is higher than the reset threshold number nbECM min or<br>
not. The value of the flag is stored in a non-volatile memory. When the further<br>
reset occurs (box 76), the value of the flag is read and is compared to the NOK<br>
value (box 77).<br>
[00124] If the value of the flag is OK, i.e. if the smartcard has received more than<br>
the reset threshold number nb_ECM_min of Entitlement Control Messages since<br>
the previous reset, the further reset is evaluated as regular. The flag is reset to the<br>
NOK value again (box 75) and the smartcard waits for a new message (box 78).<br>
Each new ECM is processed (box 72) and the flag keeps the NOK value until a<br>
reset threshold number nb_ECM_min of Entitlement Control Messages is<br>
received and processed, as described in a previous paragraph.<br>
[00125] If the value of the flag is NOK, i.e. the number of intermediate command<br>
messages is smaller than the reset threshold number nb_ECM_min since the<br>
previous reset, the further reset is evaluated as suspicious. A reset error register<br>
nb_reset_off is incremented (box 79) and its value is compared to a reset errors<br>
threshold reset_max (box 710).<br>
[00126] If the value of the reset error register nb_reset_off equals the reset errors<br>
threshold resetjnax, the smartcard is blocked (box 711). If the value of the reset<br>
error register nb_reset_off is smaller than the reset errors threshold reset_max,<br>
the smartcard waits for a message (box 78) and further counts intermediate<br>
command messages. The value of the reset error register nb_reset_off may not be<br>
higher than the reset errors threshold resetjnax, since the smartcard is blocked<br>
when the value of the reset error register nb_reset_off equals the reset errors<br>
threshold reset_max.<br>
[00127] Such algorithm allows to penalize an unauthorized user that resets the<br>
smartcard each time the scrambled audiovisual information is incorrectly<br>
descrambled, or that automatically resets the smartcard after a small number of<br>
cryptoperiods.<br>
[00128] The algorithm also allows to block a smartcard that receives attacks<br>
commands with a reset between them.<br>
[00129] Parameters such as the reset errors threshold resetmax, the reset threshold<br>
number nb_ECM_min etc. may have adequate values that are adapted to possible<br>
behaviors of a regular paid-up subscriber, of an unauthorized user and of a<br>
hacker.<br>
[00130] Any other algorithm for managing penalties may be applied on the<br>
smartcard: for example, the smartcard may be blocked when the value of the<br>
error register reaches a limit value, the limit value being higher than the<br>
maximum threshold value C_max_thr.<br>
[00131] The analyzing of the sequence of command messages may preferably<br>
consist in comparing a new Entitlement Control Message to a previous<br>
Entitlement Control Message. Alternatively, EMMs, reset messages, or any other<br>
message received at the smartcard may be analyzed. The analyzing of the<br>
sequence of command messages may also consists in counting a number of<br>
intermediate command messages between two resets so as to evaluate a nature of<br>
a previous reset<br>
[00132] The analyzing may preferably be a combination of the described above<br>
analyses : for example, each new Entitlement Control Message is compared to a<br>
previous Entitlement Control Message and a number of Entitlement Control<br>
Messages between two resets is counted, so as to reinforce a securing of the<br>
smartcard. An other example of a combination of the described above analyses<br>
consists in comparing each new ECM to a previous ECM, each new EMM to a<br>
previous EMM, and each new other command message to a previous other<br>
command message. Both the ECMs, the EMMs and the other command<br>
messages may be counted to evaluate resets. Preferably three distinct counting<br>
means are implemented, so as to provide a complete understanding of a behavior<br>
of a user and hence apply an adequate penalty.<br>
[00133] Preferably the penalty that is applied on the smartcard allows to disrupt the<br>
processing of the ECMs. The penalty may also allow to disrupt an EMM<br>
processing, a receiving of messages at the smartcard, or any other action of the<br>
smartcard.<br>
[00134] A software that allows to implement the method according to the present<br>
invention is also comprised within the scope of the present invention.<br>
[00135] The software may be downloaded at a manufacturing of the portable<br>
security module. Alternatively, at least one configuration message is received at<br>
the portable security module when already in use by a subscriber, thus allowing<br>
to download the software. Both methods are comprised within the scope of the<br>
present invention.<br>
[00136] While the invention has been described with respect to a limited number of<br>
embodiments, those skilled in the art, having benefit of this disclosure, will<br>
appreciate that other embodiments can be devised which do not depart from the<br>
scope of the invention as disclosed herein. Accordingly, the scope of the<br>
invention should be limited only by the attached claims.<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
A method for securing a portable security module for use with a decoding element, the<br>
portable security module and the decoding element allowing to descramble scrambled<br>
audiovisual information are disclosed. The method comprises processing at the portable<br>
security module Entitlement Control Messages (ECMs) received at the portable security<br>
module to allow the descrambling of the scrambled audiovisual information; analyzing at the<br>
portable security module a sequence of ECMs, the sequence of ECMs comprising a new ECM<br>
and a previous ECM received at a previous time, the ECMs of the sequence being received at<br>
the portable security module at distinct times, the analyzing being performed at the receiving<br>
of the new ECM; incrementing an error register upon a determined result of the analyzing,<br>
wherein the error register is incremented when the previous ECM and the new ECM do not<br>
match; and applying a penalty to the portable security module depending on a value of the<br>
error register by introducing a dead time at the processing so as to slow down the processing.</td>
