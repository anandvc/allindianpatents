				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a solar poultry housing structure for commercial poultry rearing in cold arid zones.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
In a large country for example, India huge variations in climatic conditions exist which range from hot humid to harsh cold arid conditions. The temperatures in a large country vary from forty (summers) to minus twenty eight (winters) degrees. The humidity varies in the regions from 36% to 65%. As such the increment of activities like animal husbandry, in absence of favorable climate is less. As on date most of the poultry farming is limited to the periods of favorable temperatures, which lasts for just 3 to 4 months. The availability of the fresh meat becomes less as the winter's progress including the availability of poultry and poultry products becomes negligible. More over, three is no specific breed of poultry products available in the cold arid region, and locals are forced to rear varieties adapted to tropical zones in the temperate climatic conditions, without any adequate, well defined and scientifically designed infrastructure. As such most of the poultry rearing practices are confined to rearing of poultry in small underground sheds which do not cater for proper ventilation and hygienic conditions, resulting in increased incidence of various diseases in the poultry. The requisite temperature in such structures is maintained by using artificial means of heating which is unsafe and uneconomical. These factors have cumulatively rendered the poultry production in such regions redundant.<br>
The climatic conditions in regions such as Ladakh make the conventional poultry rearing a difficult venture in the region. This is specifically because rearing of poultry requires maintenance of specific managemental conditions like temperature, ventilation, humidity besides hygiene and biosecurity. The conventional rearing of poultry in small underground houses or over ground houses does not meet the managemental conditions, thus resulting in uneconomical rearing practices which tend to be unhygienic. Further, maintenance of proper temperature and ventilation in such houses in also not possible.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to propose a solar based poultry<br>
housing device which creates and maintains an hygienic and viable conditions for<br>
poultry rearing in cold arid zones.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to propose a solar based poultry<br>
housing device which provides condusive and conventional conditions required<br>
for poultry rearing.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose a solar based poultry<br>
housing device which provides a configuration capable of ample trapping of solar<br>
energy in day times, which is used to heat the housing device in day time<br>
including retaining the heat at the night time.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to propose a solar based poultry<br>
housing device which has a ventilation means to create draft of air to ventilate<br>
the housing device.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to propose a solar based poultry<br>
housing device which provides a rat proofing means for safety of the breeds. A still further object of the present invention is to propose a solar based<br>
poultry housing device which eliminates  the  requirement of artificial<br>
heating  in  winters  and  the  regular  pest-control  exercise   to  prevent<br>
diseases.<br>
A still another object of the present invention is to propose a solar based<br>
poultry housing device which is economic and entails less maintenance<br>
cost.<br>

A foot-path in the floor space is provided between the two doors. An additional single door in each room is arranged so as to facilitate an internal commutation between the plurality of room-like structures. The opening of the single door facilitates easy movement of the poultry birds from one room to another. By keeping the single door closed, the device can be divided into four independent units which can be utilized at the time of brooding or disease outbreak for segregation of birds.<br>
The corners of the room-like structures are rounded to prevent smothering of the birds due to huddling. A plurality of ventilators are provided on the three outside walls of the device. Each of the ventilators is provided with a wire mesh to prevent entry of animals like cats, dogs or rodents. Two glass shutters at either end of the device are provided for the ventilation, which can be individually opened for closed. An exhaust fan with speed regulator in each ventilator is arranged to facilitate ventilation by creating a draft of air when required. The ventilators are provided at a height of approximately 1 foot from the floor level to ensure ventilation at bird level. Each room-like structure is provided with atleast two such ventilators.<br>
The floor of the device is made of concrete. The floor is insulated underneath with a thick layer of an insulating material, to prevent heat dissipation to the surrounding land through conduction. The wall and the floor meet each other at a curve instead of an angle which facilitates easy washing and drainage of the floor.<br>
Each room-like structures is internally provided with a layer of reflecting GI sheet. The inside surface of the GI sheet, which faces the wall is painted black. This GI<br>
sheet reflects back the heat to the center of the room at the bird level. Also it provides for a surface which is easily disinfected. Smooth joints have been provided in the rooms to prevent presence of crevices.<br>
