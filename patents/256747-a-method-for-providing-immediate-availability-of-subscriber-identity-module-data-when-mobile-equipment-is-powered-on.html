				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention, in general relates to the field of telecommunication, more particularly mobile communication. It relates to the mobile equipment in which SIM (hereinafter referred to as SIM / USIM) is used. The invention covers SIM as well as the device in which it is used it e.g. ME (hereinafter referred to as UE/ME/PDA), PDA, etc. More particularly, the present invention relates to a method for enabling immediate availability qf SIM data at UE power on by caching SIM data to ME.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The SIM contains data [i.e. EFPLMNsei, EFPLMNWACT, EFOPLMNWACT, EFSMS, EFADN, EFFDN, EFNETPAR, EFOPL, EFPNN and Phone book related files, etc.], which is required for the operation of ME to obtain services from the network. It also contains information which is directly used by the user e.g. phonebook.<br>
Data like phonebook, EFPLMNWACT, EFOPLMNWACT etc, does not change frequently on these SIM cards. Whenever the ME requires data, the same is read from the SIM card.<br>
***: The SIM vendor/operator/ME vendor can give the list of Such EF’s which can be copied on to ME’s memory . EFPLMNsei, EFPLMNWACT, EFOPLMNWACT, EFSMS, EFADN, EFFDN, EFNETPAR, EFOPL, EFPNN and Phone book related files, etc. such EF will be referred as data from here on.<br>
$: ME’s memory here refers to any memory where the data is not erased, even after removal of the battery/power and the access to this data should be faster when compared to access from the SIM. For example, flash memory and Non-volatile memory etc.<br><br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
Following are the problems identified with the existing standard<br>
a)	During UE power ON, it takes time to read the large data from the SIM card and hence delays access to the NW services and phone book to the user.<br>
b)	While reading the data from SIM card, ME drains the battery.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The data which does not change frequently on the SIM card is copied on the ME’s memory [i.e., Flash memory, Non volatile memory, etc.] for fast access &amp; to avoid battery drain. Whenever ME requires SIM data, it can be read from ME’s memory.<br>
Occasionally data on the SIM card can change. For ME to detect this change the SIM card shall have EF “last Used IMEI” and ME should have last used ICCID of the SIM card.<br>
The EF “last Used IMEI” shall be updated by SIM itself [using SIM Application Toolkit]. The ME shall read this EF. If the EF “last Used IMEI” has invalid IMEI number (all bytes set to OxFF) then ME shall read the data from SIM card.<br>
The following conditions should be matched to copy the SIM data from ME’s memory.<br>
1.	The EF “last Used IMEI” on the SIM card should match the IMEI of the ME<br>
2.	The last ICCID stored on ME should match the ICCID of SIM<br>
Accordingly, the present invention comprises a method enabling immediate availability of SIM data at UE power on by caching SIM data to ME comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	reading the ICCID stored on a SIM card;<br>
(b)	checking if the ICCID stored in ME and in said SIM card are the same;<br><br>
(c)	reading EF- last used IMEI from said SIM card if the ICCID stored in the ME and in said SIM card are the same;<br>
(d)	reading the data from the said SIM card and updating the ME’s memory with the new values if the ICCID stored in ME and in said SIM card are different;<br>
(e)	checking if the IMEI stored in ME and IMEI in EF -last used IMEI” are the same after reading EF- last used IMEI from said SIM;<br>
(f)	reading the data from ME’s memory if the IMEI stored in ME and IMEI in EF are the same;<br>
(g)	checking whether reading the data from ME’s memory for immediate usage if the IMEI stored in ME and IMEI in EF are different;<br>
(h) reading the data from ME’s memory if the data is for immediate usage;<br>
and (i) reading the data from SIM card and updating the ME’s memory with the<br>
new values.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 depicts the flowchart for control flow on the ME side.<br>
Figure 2 explains the behavior of SIM card.<br>
Figure 3 refers to the scenario where a EF is changed because of OTA SMS.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with<br><br>
reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 depicts the flowchart for control flow on the ME side. The flowchart depicts the necessary checks to be made by the ME before reading the data from the ME’s memory.<br>
IRead ICCID stored on SIM card<br>
2.Compare ICCID stored in ME &amp; in SIM<br>
3-Same ICCID, Read EF- last used IMEI from SIM<br>
4.Different ICCID, Read the data from SIM card and update the ME’s memory<br>
with the new values<br>
5.Compare IMEI stored in ME &amp; IMEI in EF -”last used IMEI”<br>
6.Same IMEI, Read the data from ME’s memory<br>
7.Different IMEI, Read the data from ME’s memory for immediate usage?<br>
8. Yes, Read the data from ME’s memory for immediate usage<br>
9.Read the data from SIM card and update the ME’s memory with the new values<br>
Figure 2 explains the behavior of SIM card. The state machine explains how the last used IMEI is made available to the UE. During SIM initialization the ME sends the terminal profile to SIM card. The terminal profile provides information whether the proactive command- “Provide local info [IMEI]” is supported by the ME or not. In case the proactive command is not supported then, the SIM card overwrites the EF’s “last used IMEI” and “current used IMEI” with invalid values Oxffffff. In case the provide local info [IMEI] is supported by ME, then Sim card issues the provide<br><br>
local indo [IMEI] command to UE, On receipt of this command, UE sends the IMEI of the device. Sim card updates the “Last Used IMEI” with the contents of field “Current used IMEI”, then Sim card updates the “Current used IMEI” field with the given values of the UE.<br>
Figure 3 refers to the scenario where an EF is changed because of OTA SMS.<br>
1.SIM receives OTA which is supposed to change some EF<br>
2. Updates the EF mentioned in OTA as per the new values<br>
3.Updates EF “current used IMEI” with invalid value “FFFF”<br>
4.Sends the Refresh command to ME &amp; waits for the Terminal response Proper TR received<br>
5. Yes, Update EF “current used IMEI” with IMEI of the ME in use<br>
6.No, Nothing to be done. Keep the EF “current used IMEI” with invalid values<br>
On application of the method proposed herein, the time to read the data from ME’s memory is lesser than the time taken to read the data from SIM card. This gives enhanced user experience. The user will be able to see the data very quickly e.g. When UE is powered ON, user will be able to see the Phonebook very quickly. The battery drain will also be reduced<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the<br><br>
applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from.<br><br>
