				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING ALKYLENE DERIVATIVE AMD METHOD FOR<br>
REGENERATING CATALYST FOR PRODCUCING ALKYLENE DERIVATIVE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing an alkylene derivative such as an alkylene<br>
glycol or an alkylene carbonate. Particularly, it<br>
relates to a process for producing an alkylene glycol<br>
such as ethylene glycol, which comprises reacting an<br>
alkylene oxide such as ethylene oxide, with water in the<br>
presence of carbon dioxide by means of a quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide and/or bromide catalyst, or a process<br>
for producing ethylene carbonate or the like, which<br>
comprises reacting an alkylene oxide with carbon dioxide.<br>
Especially, it relates to a method for efficiently<br>
recovering the quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or<br>
bromide catalyst from this reaction system and recycling<br>
it for use.<br>
In the present invention, an alkylene glycol means<br>
an alkylene glycol having from about 2 to 10 carbon atoms<br>
such as ethylene glycol or propylene glycol, and an<br>
alkylene carbonate means an alkylene carbonate having<br>
from about 2 to 10 carbon atoms, such as ethylene<br>
carbonate or propylene carbonate.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Ethylene glycol is produced in a large scale by-<br>
reacting ethylene oxide directly with water for<br>
hydrolysis. However, in this method, in order to<br>
suppress formation of a byproduct such as diethylene<br>
glycol or triethylene glycol during the hydrolysis, it is<br>
required to use water in large excess over the<br>
stoichiometrical amount to ethylene oxide. Accordingly,<br>
it is necessary to remove the large excess amount of<br>
water by distillation of the formed ethylene glycol<br>
aqueous solution, and there is a problem that a large<br>
amount of energy is required to obtain purified ethylene<br>
glycol.<br>
As a method to solve such a problem, a method has<br>
been proposed wherein ethylene oxide is reacted with<br>
water in the presence of carbon dioxide, to produce<br>
ethylene glycol. This reaction is a two step reaction<br>
wherein ethylene carbonate is formed by a reaction of<br>
ethylene oxide with carbon dioxide, and the ethylene<br>
carbonate is hydrolyzed. In this two step reaction,<br>
water is present in the reaction system, whereby the<br>
reaction may proceed even in the same reactor, but in<br>
order to complete the reaction of the second step, a<br>
further reactor may be provided for the later step. In<br>
the hydrolysis of ethylene carbonate, diethylene glycol<br>
or triethylene glycol will not substantially be formed as<br>
a byproduct, and accordingly, the hydrolysis can be<br>
carried out with water in an amount slightly in excess of<br>
the stoichiometrical amount, whereby the cost required<br>
for removing water from the formed ethylene glycol<br>
aqueous solution can be substantially reduced. Further,<br>
carbon dioxide will be formed by the hydrolysis of<br>
ethylene carbonate formed by the reaction of ethylene<br>
oxide with carbon dioxide, and such carbon dioxide may be<br>
recycled for reuse.<br>
Further, in this method, it is also possible to<br>
produce ethylene carbonate by suppressing the formation<br>
of ethylene glycol by reducing the amount of water in the<br>
starting material by lowering the temperature as a<br>
reaction condition.<br>
Thus, various types of catalysts have been proposed<br>
for the production of ethylene glycol and/or ethylene<br>
carbonate from ethylene oxide. One of preferred<br>
catalysts is an organic phosphonium salt, and<br>
particularly preferred is a quaternary phosphonium iodide<br>
or bromide (JP-B-55-47617). Further, as a co-catalyst,<br>
an alkali metal carbonate may be used in combination with<br>
such an organic phosphonium salt (JP-A-12-12 8814).<br>
Whereas, ethylene oxide as raw material is produced<br>
by oxidation of ethylene, and in such a case, in order to<br>
improve the selectivity for the oxidation reaction, a<br>
chlorohydrocarbon such as ethyl chloride is supplied as a<br>
selectivity-adjusting agent to the redaction system (JP-A-<br>
2-1045,79).<br>
As mentioned above, the method for producing<br>
ethylene glycol or ethylene carbonate by reacting<br>
ethylene oxide with water or carbon dioxide in the<br>
presence of carbon dioxide, is an industrially<br>
advantageous method free from a problem of byproducts,<br>
but has a problem that the reaction efficiency<br>
deteriorates when the reaction is continued.<br>
The present inventors have studied the cause for<br>
such deterioration of the reaction efficiency and as a<br>
result, have found that it is the cause that the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide or bromide catalyst in the<br>
reaction system is converted to a chloride having a low<br>
catalytic activity. In fact, by the operation of the<br>
apparatus for about one year, about 2 0 wt% of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide or bromide catalyst in the<br>
reaction system was found to be converted to a quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride.<br>
The reason for the conversion of the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide or bromide to the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride was considered to be such that a<br>
chlorine compound contained as an impurity in ethylene<br>
oxide as raw material would be introduced into the<br>
reaction system. Namely, as mentioned above, in the<br>
process for producing ethylene oxide, a chlorohydrocarbon<br>
is supplied as a selectivity-adjusting agent to the<br>
reaction system in order to improve the selectivity for<br>
the reaction, and chlorine contained in this<br>
chlorohydrocarbon remains as a chlorine compound in the<br>
product ethylene oxide even via a purification system,<br>
and such a chlorine compound is included in the process<br>
for producing ethylene glycol or ethylene carbonate. It<br>
is considered that by the chlorine compound introduced as<br>
included in the product ethylene oxide, the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide or bromide will be converted to the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride, although the details of<br>
such reaction mechanism are not clearly understood.<br>
Accordingly, in the process for producing ethylene<br>
glycol or ethylene carbonate, it is necessary to separate<br>
and remove from the reaction system the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride having a low reactivity derived from<br>
the catalyst, so as to let only the highly active<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide or bromide remain. However,<br>
heretofore, it has not been ascertained even that the<br>
decrease of the reaction efficiency with time is caused<br>
by the conversion with time to the chloride. Further,<br>
there has been no study made with respect to a method for<br>
separating the quaternary phosphonium chloride from the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide or bromide as the catalyst<br>
in the reaction system, or a method for converting the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride to the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide or bromide.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>

and/or bromide is added to a mixture comprising a<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride and a quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide and/or bromide, obtained from the<br>
reaction step, to have the quaternary phosphonium<br>
chloride converted to a quaternary phosphonium iodide<br>
and/or bromide, which is precipitated in water, and<br>
recovered and recycled to the reaction step.<br>
(19) A process for producing an alkylene derivative,<br>
which comprises a reaction step of reacting an alkylene<br>
oxide and carbon dioxide by means of a quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide and/or bromide as a catalyst to form<br>
an alkylene carbonate, characterized in that an iodide<br>
and/or bromide is added to a mixture comprising a<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride and a quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide and/or bromide, obtained from the<br>
reaction step, to let chlorine derived from the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride precipitate as an<br>
inorganic chloride in an organic solvent, whereby the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide is recovered<br>
and recycled to the reaction step.<br>
In the present invention, when the reaction solution<br>
containing the catalyst in a high concentration and/or<br>
the catalyst solution, is mixed with water, the iodide or<br>
bromide will precipitate, while the chloride derived from<br>
the catalyst will remain as dissolved in the liquid.<br>
Namely, each of the iodide, bromide and chloride is<br>
highly soluble in an alkylene glycol or an alkylene<br>
carbonate, but the iodide or bromide has a low solubility<br>
in water, while the chloride has a high solubility in<br>
water. By subjecting the precipitated quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide or bromide to solid-liquid separation,<br>
it is easily possible to separate and. recover the<br>
catalyst.<br>
In the present invention, the catalyst may be<br>
precipitated, for example, as follows.<br>
(1) The reaction solution containing the catalyst and/or<br>
the catalyst solution, is mixed with water and then<br>
cooled.<br>
(2) From the reaction solution containing the catalyst<br>
and/or the catalyst solution, at least a part of the<br>
alkylene glycol, is removed, followed by mixing with<br>
water.<br>
In such a case, cooling operation is not necessarily<br>
required. However, in order to lower the solubility of<br>
the catalyst, it is preferred to carry out the cooling.<br>
The quaternary phosphonium iodide or bromide thus<br>
recovered, can be recycled to the reaction step for reuse.<br>
On the other hand, in the separated liquid after<br>
recovery of the quaternary phosphonium iodide or bromide<br>
by solid-liquid separation, a quaternary phosphonium<br>
chloride as a chlorine salt, is contained. This<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride may be converted to a<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide or bromide by e.g. ion<br>
exchange, and then recovered, or recycled in a solution<br>
state to the reaction step for reuse.<br>
Further, in the present invention, by adding an<br>
iodide and/or bromide to a mixture comprising a<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride and a quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide and/or bromide, obtained from a<br>
reaction step of reacting an alkylene oxide with water or<br>
carbon dioxide in the presence of carbon dioxide by means<br>
of a quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide<br>
catalyst, it is possible to convert the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride in the mixture to an iodide and/or<br>
bromide. Thus, the already present quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide and/or bromide, and the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide and/or bromide formed by the reaction<br>
of the quaternary phosphonium chloride with an iodide<br>
and/or bromide, can be precipitated in water and<br>
recovered as precipitates.<br>
In the following, the mixture comprising the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride and the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide and/or bromide, to which the iodide<br>
and/or bromide is added to convert the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride to a quaternary phosphonium iodide<br>
and/or bromide, may sometimes be referred to as "the<br>
mixture to be treated". Further, in the following, the<br>
liquid flowing out from the reactor, or the liquid<br>
withdrawn from the reactor, may sometimes be referred to<br>
simply as "the reaction solution", and the liquid in<br>
which the catalyst is concentrated by separating water<br>
and the alkylene glycol or the alkylene carbonate from<br>
the reaction solution by distillation, may sometimes be<br>
referred to simply as "the catalyst solution".<br>
The present invention may be applicable directly to<br>
the reaction solution containing the catalyst, withdrawn<br>
from the reaction step for an alkylene glycol or an<br>
alkylene carbonate, as the mixture to be treated.<br>
However, as another method, it may be applied to a liquid<br>
after precipitating and recovering e. part of the catalyst<br>
by adding water to a liquid-form catalyst solution or a<br>
solid-form residue after removing by distillation a part<br>
or all of the alkylene glycol or the alkylene carbonate<br>
as the solvent in the reaction solution (hereinafter, the<br>
recovery operation by precipitating a part of the<br>
catalyst by adding water to such a catalyst solution or a<br>
solid-form residue, may sometimes be referred to as "the<br>
pre-recovery"). By such pre-recovery treatment, the<br>
concentration of the quaternary phosphonium chloride in<br>
the mixture to be treated, can be increased, and it is<br>
possible to increase the conversion to and the recovery<br>
of the quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide.<br>
Namely, the quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or<br>
bromide has a lower solubility in water than the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride. Accordingly, by such<br>
addition of water, most of the quaternary phosphonium<br>
iodide and/or bromide will be precipitated, while most of<br>
the quaternary phosphonium chloride will be dissolved in<br>
water. By such pre-recovery treatment, the concentration<br>
of the quaternary phosphonium chloride in the mixture to<br>
be treated can be increased, and it is possible to<br>
increase the conversion to and the recovery of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide.<br>
Further, as another method, at the time of carrying<br>
out the above-mentioned pre-recovery, instead of adding<br>
water to the catalyst solution or the solid-form residue,<br>
an aqueous solution having an iodide and/or bromide<br>
dissolved, may be used, whereby the recovery rate of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide may be<br>
increased.<br>
In either method, when an iodide and/or bromide is<br>
added to the quaternary phosphonium chloride dissolved in<br>
water, the quaternary phosphonium chloride is<br>
precipitated in the form of the iodide and/or bromide,<br>
and in the solution, the chloride corresponding to the<br>
added compound remains as dissolved. Accordingly, the<br>
precipitated product is subjected to solid-liquid<br>
separation, whereby the quaternary phosphonium chloride<br>
can easily be separated and recovered in the form of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide.<br>
The quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide<br>
thus recovered may be recycled for use to the reaction<br>
step for the alkylene glycol or the alkylene carbonate.<br>
Further, according to the present invention, by<br>
adding an iodide and/or bromide to a mixture comprising a<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride and a quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide and/or bromide, obtained from such a<br>
reaction step or from the above recovery step, to let<br>
chlorine derived from the quaternary phosphonium chloride<br>
precipitate as an inorganic chloride in the organic<br>
solvent, it is possible to recover the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide and/or bromide.<br>
Namely, by adding an iodide and/or bromide to a<br>
mixture comprising the quaternary phosphonium chloride<br>
and the quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide,<br>
obtained from the reaction step of reacting an alkylene<br>
oxide with water or carbon dioxide in the presence of<br>
carbon dioxide by means of a quaternary phosphonium<br>
iodide and/or bromide catalyst to form an alkylene glycol<br>
or an alkylene carbonate, it is possible to have the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride in such a mixture<br>
converted to a quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or<br>
bromide. On the other hand, by letting chlorine derived<br>
from the quaternary phosphonium chloride precipitate as<br>
an inorganic chloride having a low solubility in an<br>
organic solvent, in the organic solvent and separating<br>
the precipitated inorganic chloride, it is possible to<br>
recover the quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide<br>
dissolved in the organic solvent.<br>
In the following, such an operation to let chlorine<br>
derived from the quaternary phosphonium chloride<br>
precipitate as an inorganic chloride in an organic<br>
solvent may sometimes be referred to as "the operation to<br>
precipitate an inorganic chloride". Further, the mixture<br>
comprising a quaternary phosphonium chloride and a<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide, to which an<br>
iodide and/or bromide is to be added to let chlorine of<br>
the quaternary phosphonium chloride precipitate as an<br>
inorganic chloride, may also be referred to as "the<br>
mixture to be treated".<br>
The separated liquid after converting the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride to the iodide or bromide and letting<br>
chlorine derived from the chloride precipitate as an<br>
inorganic chloride in the organic solvent and separating<br>
the inorganic chloride, contains the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide and/or bromide dissolved in the<br>
organic solvent. Accordingly, by removing the organic<br>
solvent in the separated liquid by evaporation, the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide can be<br>
recovered in the form of a solid. The recovered<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide may be<br>
washed with water, if desired, and then, it may be, as it<br>
is or after being dissolved in a proper solvent, recycled<br>
for use in the reaction step for an alkylene glycol or an<br>
alkylene carbonate.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Now, the practical mode of the process for producing<br>
an alkylene glycol of the present invention is described<br>
in detail.<br>
In the following, the present invention is described<br>
mainly with respect to a case where it is applied to a<br>
reaction to produce ethylene glycol from ethylene oxide<br>
by means of a quaternary phosphonium iodide catalyst, but<br>
the present invention is by no means restricted thereto.<br>
For example, the present invention is suitably applicable<br>
also to the production of various alkylene glycols, such<br>
as the production of propylene glycol from propylene<br>
oxide.<br>
Further, the present invention is likewise<br>
applicable to a case where a quaternary phosphonium<br>
bromide is employed as the catalyst, or to a case where a<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide and a quaternary<br>
phosphonium bromide are used in combination as catalysts.<br>
Further, as mentioned above, the present invention<br>
is also applicable to a reaction to produce an alkylene<br>
carbonate such as ethylene carbonate, in a manner similar<br>
to such, a process for producing alkylene glycol by<br>
changing the reaction conditions to lower the reaction<br>
temperature to suppress the production of an alkylene<br>
glycol such as ethylene glycol. Further, it can also be<br>
applied to a reaction wherein both the alkylene carbonate<br>
an the alkylene glycol are the desired products.<br>
Further, in the following, a method is also<br>
exemplified wherein an iodide is added to the mixture to<br>
be treated, to have a quaternary phosphonium chloride<br>
converted to a quaternary phosphonium iodide for recovery.<br>
Instead of the iodide, a bromide may be added to have the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride converted to a quaternary<br>
phosphonium bromide for recovery, or an iodide and a<br>
bromide may be added in combination to have the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride converted to a quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide and a quaternary phosphonium bromide,<br>
for recovery.<br>
Further, in the following, a method may be<br>
exemplified wherein an inorganic iodide is added to the<br>
mixture to be treated to have a quaternary phosphonium<br>
chloride converted to a quaternary phosphonium iodide,<br>
and at the same time, chlorine derived from a quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride is precipitated as an inorganic<br>
chloride. Instead of the iodide, a bromide may be added<br>
to have the quaternary phosphonium chloride converted to<br>
a quaternary phosphonium bromide, and at the same time to<br>
let chlorine derived from the quaternary phosphonium<br>
chloride precipitate as an inorganic chloride, or an<br>
iodide and a bromide may be added in combination to have<br>
the quaternary phosphonium chloride converted to a<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide and a quaternary<br>
phosphonium bromide and at the same time to let chlorine<br>
derived from the quaternary phosphonium chloride<br>
precipitate as an inorganic chloride.<br>
As quaternary phosphonium catalysts which may be<br>
used in the present invention, the compounds disclosed in<br>
JP-B-58-22448 may be mentioned. Typical ones may, for<br>
example, be triphenylmethylphosphonion iodide,<br>
triphenylpropylphosphonium iodide,<br>
triphenylbenzylphosphonium iodide and<br>
tributylmethylphosphonium iodide. Such a quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide catalyst is preferably supplied to the<br>
reaction system so that it will be from 0.001 to 0.05<br>
time by mol to ethylene oxide. Further, when a<br>
quaternary phosphonium bromide catalyst is to be employed,<br>
a bromide catalyst corresponding to the above quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide catalyst may be employed, and its<br>
suitable amount is equal to the quaternary phosphonium<br>
iodide catalyst.<br>
In the present invention, an alkali metal carbonate<br>
may be coexistent as a co-catalyst in the reaction system,<br>
whereby the efficiency for the formation of ethylene<br>
glycol may be increased. To let the alkali metal<br>
carbonate be coexistent in the reaction system, a<br>
hydroxide, carbonate or bicarbonate of an alkali metal<br>
such as sodium or potassium, preferably potassium, may be<br>
added, and when any one of the alkali metal compounds is<br>
added, it will be present in the form of a carbonate in<br>
the reaction system. In this case, an alkali metal<br>
carbonate, preferably potassium carbonate, is preferably<br>
incorporated so that it will be from 0.01 to 1 in a molar<br>
ratio to the quaternary phosphonium iodide.<br>
The amount of water to ethylene oxide may be reduced<br>
to the stoichiometrical amount or lower than that<br>
depending upon the reaction system. However, it is<br>
preferably used in an amount of from 1.0 to 10.0 times by<br>
mol to ethylene oxide. Further, with carbon dioxide, a<br>
sufficient effect can be obtained in an amount of at most<br>
equimolar to ethylene oxide, and under a usual condition,<br>
it is employed in an amount of from 0.1 to 5.0 mols per<br>
mol of ethylene oxide. However, such a ratio is not<br>
necessarily strictly limited.<br>
The reaction temperature varies depending upon the<br>
type of the alkylene oxide, the type of the catalyst, the<br>
composition of the reaction solution at the initial stage<br>
of the reaction, etc., but, the reaction is usually<br>
carried out within a range of from 50 to 180°C. The<br>
pressure varies depending upon the amount of carbon<br>
dioxide, the reaction temperature, etc., and it may<br>
further vary depending upon the progress of the reaction,<br>
but it is carried out usually within a range of from 0.5<br>
to 5.0 MPa.<br>
The type of the reactor is not particularly limited,<br>
so long as it is one whereby the gas-liquid reaction can<br>
be smoothly carried out. Further, the number of reactors<br>
and the retention time, are selected so that the desired<br>
conversion can be attained. Further, in a case where<br>
ethylene glycol is to be produced, a reactor may be added<br>
as the case requires to hydrolyze ethylene carbonate in<br>
the reaction solution.<br>
From the reaction solution discharged from the<br>
reactor, water and the majority of ethylene glycol are<br>
separated by distillation. The remained liquid (the<br>
catalyst solution) containing the catalyst will be<br>
recycled to the reactor so that the catalyst will be used<br>
again for the reaction.<br>
MODE FOR EFFICIENTLY RECOVERING THE QUATERNARY<br>
PHOSPHONIUM IODIDE OR BROMIDE CATALYST FROM THE REACTION<br>
SYSTEM AND RECYCLING IT FOR REUSE<br>
In a case where the catalyst is to be recovered from<br>
the reaction solution discharged from the reactor, the<br>
catalyst concentration is thin, and the catalyst can<br>
hardly be precipitated, as it is, and accordingly, it is<br>
preferred to remove water and ethylene glycol contained<br>
in the reaction solution to increase the catalyst<br>
concentration, followed by mixing (the catalyst after<br>
removal of ethylene glycol) again with water.<br>
In a case where the catalyst solution is used for<br>
recovery of the catalyst, it is possible to recover the<br>
catalyst by mixing the solution as it is with water, but<br>
it is preferred to further remove the contained ethylene<br>
glycol by distillation, followed by mixing with water to<br>
recover the catalyst, in order to increase the recovery<br>
rate of the catalyst.<br>
Namely, in this reaction, at least part of the<br>
reaction solution or the catalyst solution is withdrawn<br>
from such a reaction step, and water and the alkylene<br>
glycol, or the alkylene glycol, is removed so that the<br>
molar ratio of the alkylene glycol to the catalyst<br>
contained in the solution be at most 2 0 times when the<br>
molar ratio is higher than that, preferably at most twice,<br>
followed by mixing with water again.<br>
In a case where the molar ratio of the alkylene<br>
glycol to the catalyst contained in the solution is lower<br>
than 2 0 times by mol, water may simply be mixed to have<br>
the catalyst precipitated and recovered.<br>
When the liquid withdrawn from the reaction step is<br>
to be mixed with water, there may be a case where cooling<br>
is required to let the quaternary phosphonium iodide<br>
precipitate. Namely, the. solubility of the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide in water or ethylene glycol will be<br>
smaller as the temperature is lower.<br>
The reaction solution withdrawn from the reaction<br>
step is usually at a level of from 100 to 180°C. It is<br>
preferred to cool the reaction solution so that the<br>
temperature of the solution after being mixed with water<br>
becomes at most 3 0°C, preferably at a level of from 0 to<br>
2 0°C, whereby the quaternary phosphonium iodide can be<br>
precipitated more efficiently. Whether or not such<br>
cooling is required, is determined depending upon the<br>
temperature of the reaction solution and the temperature<br>
and amount of water to be mixed.<br>
Further, to ensure the precipitation, it is<br>
preferred not only to carry out the cooling but also to<br>
add or preliminarily incorporate seed crystals, whereby<br>
the effect for precipitation under a stabilized condition<br>
will be large.<br>
Further, if at least a part, preferably the majority,<br>
of the product ethylene glycol is removed from the liquid<br>
withdrawn from the reaction step, for example, if<br>
ethylene glycol (which may contain water) is removed so<br>
that the catalyst concentration will be at least 40 wt%,<br>
followed by mixing such a liquid with water, the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide can be precipitated without<br>
necessity to carry out cooling, but it is still preferred<br>
to cool it to a level of at most 4 0°C, whereby the<br>
precipitation can efficiently be carried out.<br>
The amount of water to be mixed, varies depending<br>
upon the amount of the quaternary phosphonium iodide in<br>
the reaction solution, the amount of ethylene glycol, the<br>
amount of the chloride, cooling or not cooling, the<br>
recovery efficiency of the desired quaternary phosphonium<br>
iodide, etc., but if the amount is too small, filtration<br>
tends to be difficult, and the efficiency to dissolve the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride tends to deteriorate. On<br>
the other hand, if the amount is too large, the amount of<br>
the quaternary phosphonium iodide contained in the liquid<br>
phase after separating the quaternary phosphonium iodide,<br>
tends to increase. Usually, the amount of water to be<br>
added in one treatment is suitably determined within a<br>
range of at least 0.1 time by weight, preferably from 0.1<br>
to 5 times by weight, to the liquid to be treated.<br>
The liquid phase after separated from the solid can<br>
be used again as water for washing the reaction solution,<br>
the catalyst solution or the catalyst separated from<br>
ethylene glycol. In such a case, if it is used<br>
repeatedly as water for washing, the concentration of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride contained in the water<br>
for washing will increase, whereby the concentration of<br>
the quaternary phosphonium chloride contained in the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide to be recovered, will<br>
increase, and accordingly, after it is used for washing<br>
from once to five times, it is replaced with fresh water<br>
for washing.<br>
A method wherein washing of the reaction solution is<br>
carried out a plurality of times to gradually change to<br>
water for washing having a low concentration of<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride, may also be carried out<br>
without any problem.<br>
In a specific embodiment of this operation, cooled<br>
water or a slurry of quaternary phosphonium iodide is<br>
preliminarily put in a vessel, and the reaction solution<br>
or the catalyst solution and water are continuously or<br>
batch-wise supplied thereto, and the mixture thereby<br>
obtained is continuously or batch-wise withdrawn, whereby<br>
it is possible to recover the precipitate contained<br>
therein, by filtration.<br>
Further, in order to separate ethylene glycol from<br>
the reaction solution, an operation of separating<br>
ethylene glycol by distillation under reduced pressure,<br>
may be carried out. Water may also be separated together<br>
with ethylene glycol.<br>
The precipitate thus obtained by mixing the reaction<br>
solution with water, is usually a highly active<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide catalyst having an iodide<br>
content of at least 90 wt% and a chloride content of at<br>
most 10 wt% and can effectively be recycled to the<br>
reaction step for reuse.<br>
Further, the separated liquid after separating the<br>
precipitate of the quaternary phosphonium iodide,<br>
contains the chloride i.e. the quaternary phosphonium<br>
chloride. Such a quaternary phosphonium chloride can be<br>
converted to a quaternary phosphonium iodide, for example,<br>
by a method wherein the separated liquid is subjected to<br>
dehalogenation treatment with an OH type anion exchange<br>
resin, followed by neutralization with hydrogen iodide,<br>
or chlorine ions are directly exchanged to iodine ions by<br>
an anion exchange resin substituted by iodine. Thus, the<br>
catalyst can be regenerated, and the regenerated catalyst<br>
thus obtained may also be effectively recycled to the<br>
reaction step for reuse.<br>
In an application of the present invention, a part<br>
of the reaction solution may be continuously or<br>
intermittently withdrawn from the reactor which is<br>
continuously operated, followed by recovery of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide catalyst, and the recovered<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide catalyst may be recycled to<br>
the reactor. In such a case, the amount of the reaction<br>
solution and/or the amount of the catalyst solution, to<br>
be withdrawn for the recovery of the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide catalyst, is not particularly limited.<br>
However, in order to remove the chloride and to maintain<br>
the reaction efficiency at a high level within a range<br>
not to excessively increase the recovery cost of the<br>
catalyst, it is preferred to withdraw the reaction<br>
solution continuously or intermittently for treatment,<br>
when the weight ratio of the chloride to the iodide in<br>
the reactor becomes within a range of from 0.01 to 1.0.<br>
The amount of withdrawal is not particularly limited, but<br>
preferably about 0.1 to 100 wt%, based on the amount of<br>
the reaction solution or the amount of the catalyst<br>
solution.<br>
EMBODIMENT IN WHICH THE QUATERNARY PHOSPHONIUM CHLORIDE<br>
IN THE REACTION SYSTEM IS CONVERTED TO A QUATERNARY<br>
PHOSPHONIUM IODIDE AND/OR BROMIDE, WHICH IS RECOVERED AND<br>
RECYCLED TO THE REACTION SYSTEM FOR REUSE<br>
The ratio or composition of the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride and iodide contained in the mixture<br>
to be treated comprising the quaternary phosphonium<br>
chloride and iodide, according to the present invention,<br>
varies depending upon the ratio of chlorine to iodine in<br>
the process for producing ethylene glycol, the breeding<br>
position, or the subsequent treatment as mentioned below<br>
(e.g. the presence or absence of the pre-recovery<br>
operation). The existing ratio and concentrations of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride and iodide in the mixture<br>
to be treated, are not particularly limited. However,<br>
the higher the ratio of the chloride to the iodide and<br>
the concentration of the chloride, the better from the<br>
viewpoint of the efficiency of the recovery operation.<br>
Namely, the quaternary phosphonium chloride to the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide in the mixture to be<br>
treated is preferably at least 1/20, more preferably at<br>
least 1/10, by molar ratio, and the concentration of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride in the mixture to be<br>
treated is preferably at least 0.1 wt%, particularly<br>
preferably at least 1 wt%.<br>
As specific examples for application of the present<br>
invention, the following respective methods may be<br>
mentioned for each of the method for obtaining the<br>
mixture to be treated and the method for adding the<br>
iodide. They will be sequentially described, but it<br>
should be understood that the present invention is by no<br>
means restricted to the following methods.<br>
APPLICATION EXAMPLE I<br>
As a liquid containing the catalyst, a part of the<br>
liquid in the process for producing ethylene glycol is<br>
withdrawn. So long as it is a liquid containing the<br>
catalyst present in the process, there is no particular<br>
limitation as to the position at which it is withdrawn.<br>
As mentioned above, the reaction for forming ethylene<br>
glycol from ethylene oxide is a two step reaction<br>
comprising a reaction of ethylene oxide with carbon<br>
dioxide to form ethylene carbonate, and the hydrolysis of<br>
the ethylene carbonate to form ethylene glycol.<br>
Accordingly, in a case where this reaction is carried out<br>
by reactors provided in two steps in series, the liquid<br>
from this production process may be withdrawn from either<br>
reactor or may be withdrawn from both reactors.<br>
In a case where the liquid is withdrawn at the<br>
outlet of the reactor, in order to increase the recovery<br>
rate of the quaternary phosphonium iodide in the later<br>
step, it is preferred that the concentrations of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride and iodide in the mixture<br>
to be treated, are high. Accordingly, in such a case, it.<br>
is preferred to distil off water, ethylene glycol or<br>
ethylene carbonate as the solvent for concentration. The<br>
distillation may be carried out by a distillation column,<br>
but a simple evaporator may otherwise be used.<br>
Preferably, the concentration is carried out until the<br>
concentration of the quaternary phosphonium iodide in the<br>
mixture to be treated becomes at least 1/2 0 time by mol<br>
of the solvent. Taking the heat resistance of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium salt into consideration, it is<br>
preferred to carry out this concentration operation by<br>
distillation under reduced pressure, preferably at most<br>
400 Torr (53.2 Pa), preferably at a temperature of from<br>
60 to 210°C.<br>
The highly concentrated catalyst solution obtained<br>
by concentration of the reaction solution by distillation<br>
contains a quaternary phosphonium iodide and a quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride formed by chlorination of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide in the process for<br>
producing ethylene glycol. Here, the catalyst solution<br>
may be one having the reaction solution taken out of the<br>
process and concentrated, or may be a catalyst solution<br>
withdrawn from a distillation column for separating the<br>
catalyst solution from water, ethylene glycol and<br>
ethylene carbonate, in the process.<br>
As the iodide to be used for recovering the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide, any iodide may be used so<br>
long as it is an ionic compound which may be dissociated<br>
in water and which is ion exchangeable with the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride, and it may be suitably<br>
selected by a person skilled in the art. However, from<br>
the viewpoint of the solubility, toxicity, price, etc.,<br>
an alkali metal salt such as a sodium salt or a potassium<br>
salt, or hydroacid may, for example, be preferred.<br>
The inorganic iodide may be any iodide so long as it<br>
is an ionic compound which can be dissociated in water<br>
and which can be ion exchanged with the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride. However, from the viewpoint of the<br>
solubility, toxicity and price, an alkali metal salt such<br>
as a sodium salt or a potassium salt, is preferred.<br>
The amount of the iodide to be added, may be at<br>
least equivalent to the quaternary phosphonium chloride<br>
present in the mixture to be treated. A preferred range<br>
is from 0.5 to 10 mols, more preferably from 1 to 5 mols,<br>
per mol of the quaternary phosphonium chloride present in<br>
the mixture to be treated. If the iodide is added more<br>
than necessary, the recovery rate may be increased, but<br>
the excess iodide will be loss.<br>
The iodide may be added in the form of solid or an<br>
organic solvent solution or an aqueous solution. However,<br>
in an industrial operation, it is preferably a liquid<br>
from the viewpoint of the handling, and accordingly, it<br>
is preferably added in the form of an organic solvent<br>
solution or an aqueous solution.<br>
In the case of the aqueous solution, the amount of<br>
water may be an amount sufficient to dissolve the iodide,<br>
and such an amount depends on the iodide to be used. For<br>
example, in a case where potassium iodide is to be used,<br>
the saturated solubility in water is 60%, and water may<br>
be added so that the potassium iodide concentration in<br>
the mixture to be treated will be at most this level.<br>
Usually, it is added in the from of an aqueous solution<br>
having a concentration of from 1 to 60 wt%.<br>
The apparatus for adding the iodide to the mixture<br>
to be treated may be a container of any form, but it is<br>
preferred to employ a vessel having a stirring device to<br>
accelerate the ion exchange reaction..<br>
By this operation, the quaternary phosphonium<br>
chloride present in the mixture to be treated will be<br>
converted to a quaternary phosphonium iodide, which will<br>
be precipitated in water together with the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide already present in the mixture to be<br>
treated. The temperature for precipitation is preferably<br>
a low temperature, whereby remaining of the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide in water will be less. The<br>
precipitation is preferably carried out at a temperature<br>
of from 0 to 3 0°C.<br>
The precipitated quaternary phosphonium iodide will<br>
be subjected to filtration for recovery. The method for<br>
the filtration is not particularly limited, and not only<br>
usual filtration by means of a filter, but also<br>
centrifugal separation may, for example, be used.<br>
The quaternary phosphonium iodide recovered in the<br>
form of a solid, may sometimes contains about 10 wt% of<br>
the quaternary phosphonium chloride and the added iodide.<br>
At such a concentration, it may be recycled to the<br>
reaction step for ethylene glycol, as it is. However, if<br>
necessary, it may be washed with water to increase the<br>
purity of the quaternary phosphonium iodide, before<br>
recycling for reuse. Water after used for washing<br>
contains the quaternary phosphonium iodide, and may be<br>
used for next washing or may be reused as water to<br>
dissolve the above-mentioned iodide to be added to the<br>
mixture to be treated.<br>
The recovered quaternary phosphonium iodide may, for<br>
example, be dissolved in ethylene glycol and as such, may<br>
be recycled to the reaction system.<br>
In the forgoing, an embodiment was described wherein<br>
a quaternary phosphonium chloride is converted to a<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide, which is recovered. This<br>
operation can be carried out also in an organic solvent.<br>
In the following, an embodiment will be described wherein<br>
an operation to precipitate an inorganic chloride is<br>
carried out in an organic solvent, whereby a quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride is converted to a quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide, which is recovered.<br>
In the highly concentrated catalyst solution<br>
obtained, ethylene glycol and/or ethylene carbonate is<br>
present as a solvent. Accordingly, to such a catalyst<br>
solution, the inorganic chloride-precipitating operation<br>
of the present invention may be applied, but it is also<br>
effective to add another organic solvent in which the<br>
solubility of the inorganic chloride formed by the<br>
addition of the iodide, is low. Further, it is preferred<br>
that ethylene glycol and/or ethylene carbonate in the<br>
highly concentrated catalyst solution is further removed<br>
to obtain a solid containing substantially no solvent,<br>
which is re-dissolved in another organic solvent, whereby<br>
the solubility of the inorganic chloride may be further<br>
decreased so that the precipitation efficiency will be<br>
improved.<br>
As the organic solvent to be used here, it is<br>
preferred to have a high ability to dissolve the<br>
quaternary phosphonium salt while it has a low ability to<br>
dissolve the inorganic chloride. As a preferred solvent,,<br>
an aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbon, a ketone, an<br>
alcohol, a nitrile, an amide, a urea, compound or a<br>
carbonate may, for example, be mentioned.<br>
Among them, the alcohol may, for example, be ethanol,<br>
1-propanol, 2-propanol, 1-butanol, 2-butanol, 2-methyl-l-<br>
propanol, 1,1-dimethylethanol, 1-pentanol, 2-pentanol, 3-<br>
pentanol, 3-methyl-1-butanol, 2-methyl-l-butanol, 1,1-<br>
dimethyl-1-propanol, 1-hexanol, 2-hexanol, 3-hexanol, 2-<br>
methyl-1-pentanol, 4-methyl-2-pentanol, 1-heptanol, 2-<br>
heptanol, 3-heptanol, 4-heptanol, 1-octanol, 2-octanol,<br>
2-ethyl-l-hexanol, 1-nonanol, 2-nonanol, 1-decanol, 1-<br>
undecanol, 1-dodecanol, 1,6-hexanediol, cyclopentanol,<br>
cyclohexanol, benzyl alcohol or phenethyl alcohol.<br>
The aliphatic halogenated hydrocarbon may, for<br>
example, be methylene chloride, chloroform, 1,2-<br>
dichloroethane, 1,1,1-trichloroethane, 1,1,2-<br>
trichloroethane, 1,2-dichloropropane, 1,3-dichloropropane,<br>
1,2,3-trichloropropane, 1,4-dichlorobutane or 1,6-<br>
dichlorohexane.<br>
The nitrile may, for example, be acetonitrile,<br>
propionitrile, butyronitrile, adiponitrile or<br>
benzonitrile. The amide may, for example, be<br>
dimethylformamide or dimethylacetamide. The urea<br>
compound may, for example, be tetramethylurea or 1,3-<br>
dimethylimidazolidin-2-on. The ketone may, for example,<br>
be acetone, methyl ethyl ketone or methyl isopropyl<br>
ketone. The carbonate may, for example, be ethylene<br>
carbonate, propylene carbonate or butylene carbonate.<br>
As the organic solvent, one of them may be used<br>
alone, or two or more of them may be used in combination<br>
as a mixture. The amount of the organic solvent to be<br>
added, is not particularly limited, but it is usually<br>
from 1 to 10 times by weight to the sum of the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride and iodide in the mixture to be<br>
treated.<br>
For example, sodium iodide is soluble in acetone<br>
very well, and such is a good combination. Further,<br>
potassium iodide is soluble in ethylene glycol very well,<br>
and such a combination is also good. However, in this<br>
case, it is not necessarily required that the iodide is<br>
completely soluble in the organic solvent. Even if the<br>
saturated soluble amount of the iodide is very small,<br>
after added to the mixture to be treated, the iodide will<br>
be consumed by the reaction with the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride, and the dissolution will further<br>
proceed to supplement the consumption. Consequently, the<br>
amount, beyond the solubility will be reacted to form an<br>
inorganic chloride. Required for the selection of the<br>
iodide and the organic solvent is that there is a<br>
difference in the mol solubility to the organic solvent<br>
between the iodide and the inorganic chloride to be<br>
formed by the reaction of this iodide with the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride. As such a combination, butanol or<br>
ethylene glycol to potassium iodide may be mentioned as<br>
an example.<br>
The apparatus for adding the iodide to the mixture<br>
to be treated may be a container of any form, but it is<br>
preferred to employ a vessel having a stirring device in<br>
order to accelerate the ion exchange reaction.<br>
By this operation, the quaternary phosphonium of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride present in the mixture to<br>
be treated will be converted to a quaternary phosphonium<br>
iodide, while chlorine will be precipitated as an<br>
inorganic chloride. The precipitation temperature is not<br>
particularly limited and may be determined in view of the<br>
dependency of the inorganic chloride on the dissolution<br>
temperature, the boiling point or viscosity of the<br>
organic solvent to be used, and the solubility of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium salt. Usually, the precipitation<br>
is carried out at a normal temperature of from 0 to 50°C,<br>
The reaction of the iodide with the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride will swiftly proceed when the<br>
viscosity of the solvent is low. However, in a case<br>
where the solvent has a high viscosity, or the solubility<br>
of the iodide is low, it is preferred to prolong the<br>
mixing time. Preferably, the reaction will be completed<br>
in from about 1 minute to 3 hours. By this operation,<br>
the quaternary phosphonium of the quaternary phosphonium<br>
chloride in the organic solvent will be converted to the<br>
iodide at a conversion of at least 9 0%, and at the same<br>
time, an inorganic chloride will be precipitated.<br>
The precipitated inorganic chloride is removed by<br>
filtration. The method for the filtration is not<br>
particularly limited, and not only filtration by means of<br>
a usual filter, but also centrifugal separation or the<br>
like may be applied.<br>
In the filtrate after separation of the inorganic<br>
chloride by filtration, a quaternary phosphonium iodide<br>
as the catalyst is dissolved. Accordingly, by removing<br>
the organic solvent from this filtrate by evaporation,<br>
the quaternary phosphonium iodide and, when added in an<br>
excess amount, the iodide, will be recovered in the form<br>
of a solid. Removal of the organic solvent may be<br>
carried out by a usual evaporator. Such removal of the<br>
organic solvent by evaporation is preferably carried out<br>
at a temperature of at most 200°C, if necessary, under<br>
reduced pressure, taking the heat resistance of the<br>
recovered quaternary phosphonium iodide into<br>
consideration, as mentioned above.<br>
The purity of the quaternary phosphonium iodide thus<br>
recovered is at a level of at least. 90% excluding the<br>
iodide added in an excess amount and the remaining<br>
solvent, and therefore, it can be recycled to the<br>
reaction step for reuse, as it is or as dissolved in a<br>
suitable solvent such as ethylene glycol. However,<br>
preferably, the recovered solid is washed with water to<br>
remove the remaining iodide and the solvent, before being<br>
recycled to the reaction step for reuse. For such<br>
washing with water, washing water may be added to the<br>
recovered solid to form a slurry, which may be subjected<br>
to filtration or centrifugal separation. In such a case,<br>
the amount of washing water to be added is preferably<br>
made to be at most twice by weight to the recovered solid,<br>
taking the dissolution loss in the washing water into<br>
consideration.<br>
As another method for removing the inorganic<br>
chloride in the above process, it is possible that<br>
without subjecting the inorganic chloride to filtration,<br>
removal of the solvent is carried out by a similar<br>
operation, and then, the above-mentioned washing with<br>
water is carried out to have the inorganic compound<br>
dissolved in water and removed.<br>
The following process may be mentioned as another<br>
embodiment of the present invention.<br>
APPLICATION EXAMPLE II<br>
In Application Example I, a pre-recovery is carried<br>
out wherein water is added to and mixed with a highly<br>
concentrated catalyst solution wherein the concentration<br>
of a quaternary phosphonium iodide is at least 1/2 0 time<br>
by mol to ethylene glycol or which is concentrated to<br>
such a concentration, followed by cooling to have the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide selectively precipitated<br>
and recovered. Here, the amount of water to be added is<br>
optional, but if it is too small, no adequate<br>
precipitation effect can be obtained, and therefore it is<br>
necessary to add at least 0.1 time by weight of the<br>
dissolved quaternary phosphonium iodide. The upper limit<br>
of the amount of water to be added, is not particularly<br>
limited, but in order not to increase the treating volume<br>
excessively, the amount is preferably adjusted to be at<br>
most about 5 times by weight to the dissolved quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide. The temperature for this<br>
precipitation operation is preferably low, whereby the<br>
remaining amount of the quaternary phosphonium iodide in<br>
water will be small. The operation is preferably carried<br>
out at a temperature of from 0 to 3 0°C.<br>
In the aqueous solution remaining after the recovery<br>
of the precipitated quaternary phosphonium iodide, an<br>
unprecipitated quaternary phosphonium iodide and a<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride will be present. Such an<br>
aqueous solution remaining after the recovery of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide may be used as the mixture<br>
to be treated, and it may be concentrated as the case .<br>
requires, and then an iodide is added to carry out the<br>
conversion of the quaternary phosphonium chloride to a<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide, and precipitation. It is<br>
preferred to carry out the concentration so that the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride concentration in the<br>
mixture to be treated prior to addition of the iodide<br>
becomes to be at least 1 wt%, from the viewpoint of the<br>
conversion efficiency of the quaternary phosphonium<br>
chloride and the recovery efficiency of the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide.<br>
The type of the iodide to be added, and the<br>
concentration and method for addition, the method for<br>
filtration of the precipitate, the subsequent treatment,<br>
etc. may be the same as in the above-mentioned<br>
Application Example I.<br>
However, in this case, water is already present in<br>
the system, and the iodide may be added in a solid form,<br>
whereby the amount of water to be used will consequently<br>
be reduced, and the dissolution loss of the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide in waste water can be reduced.<br>
Further, after carrying out the pre-recovery, the<br>
inorganic chloride precipitation operation can be carried<br>
out by using, as the mixture to be treated, one obtained<br>
by evaporating and removing preferably at least 90%, more<br>
preferably at least 99%, of water in the aqueous solution<br>
containing the quaternary phosphonium chloride and iodide.<br>
Namely, such a mixture to be treated is dissolved in an<br>
organic solvent in an amount of from 1 to 10 times by<br>
weight to the sum of the quaternary phosphonium chloride<br>
and iodide in the mixture to be treated, and an iodide is<br>
added thereto. The type of the iodide to be added, the<br>
concentration and method for addition, the method for<br>
filtration of the precipitate, the subsequent treatment,<br>
etc., may be the same as in the above-described process<br>
of Application Example I.<br>
Further, in this process, it is possible to add an<br>
aqueous iodide solution instead of water added to<br>
precipitate the quaternary phosphonium iodide in the<br>
highly concentrated catalyst solution, and in such a case,<br>
addition of the iodide in the later stage will be<br>
unnecessary.<br>
In either case, by removing the organic solvent from<br>
the organic solvent solution after subjecting the<br>
precipitate of the inorganic chloride to solid-liquid<br>
separation, it is possible to further recover the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide, which may be re-used<br>
together with the previously recovered quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide.<br>
The following process may be mentioned as a still<br>
another embodiment.<br>
APPLICATION EXAMPLE III<br>
In Application Example I, the highly concentrated<br>
catalyst solution wherein the concentration of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide is at least 1/2 0 time to<br>
ethylene glycol or which is concentrated to such a<br>
concentration, is further concentrated, and at least 90%<br>
of the solvent is distilled off. In such a case, the<br>
residue (the distillation residue) will solidify as it is<br>
cooled. The solidified residue may be washed with a<br>
suitable amount of water, whereby the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride in the residue may be eluted to the<br>
water side and removed. Also in such a case, the<br>
temperature of water for washing is preferably low, as<br>
the dissolution amount of the quaternary phosphonium<br>
iodide in the water for washing will be small. Washing<br>
is carried out preferably at a temperature of from 0 to<br>
3 0°C.<br>
The amount of the water to be used for washing is<br>
not particularly limited. However, taking the washing<br>
efficiency and the loss of the quaternary phosphonium<br>
iodide in waste water into consideration, it is<br>
preferably from 0.5 to 10 times by weight to the solid<br>
residue to be washed. Water to be used for washing is<br>
not required to be pure water, and it is possible to use<br>
recycled water within the process. Further, it may be<br>
repeatedly recycled for use. Especicilly, an aqueous<br>
solution containing the quaternary phosphonium iodide is<br>
preferred, since the dissolution loss of the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide in water can thereby be reduced.<br>
In water after washing, the eluted quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride and a slight amount of dissolved<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide will be present.<br>
This may be used as a mixture to be treated, and as<br>
mentioned above, it is concentrated as the case requires,<br>
and then an iodide is added to carry out conversion of<br>
the quaternary phosphonium chloride to the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide, and precipitation. Also in this case,<br>
the concentration of the quaternary phosphonium chloride<br>
in the mixture to be treated before adding the iodide, is<br>
preferably at least 1 wt%, and the type of the iodide to<br>
be added, the concentration and method for addition, the<br>
method for filtration of the precipitate, the subsequent<br>
treatment, etc., may be the same as in the above-<br>
mentioned process of Application Example I.<br>
Also in this case, water is already present in the<br>
system, and the iodide may be added in a solid form,<br>
whereby the amount of water to be used will be<br>
consequently reduced, and it is possible to reduce the<br>
dissolution loss of the quaternary phosphonium iodide in<br>
waste water.<br>
Further, in the above-mentioned process wherein the<br>
washing operation is carried out, water after washing is<br>
used as a mixture to be treated, and an iodine is added<br>
thereto, the aqueous iodide solution may be used as water<br>
for washing, as a mode for carrying out the process as<br>
shortened. In this case, the concentration of the<br>
aqueous iodide solution to be used, nay be a<br>
concentration such that the concentration of the iodine<br>
in water after washing will be the concentration in the<br>
above-mentioned added and mixed state.<br>
The inorganic chloride precipitation operation can<br>
be carried out by using, as the mixture to be treated,<br>
one obtained by evaporating and removing preferably at<br>
least 90%, more preferably at least 99%, of water in this<br>
aqueous solution containing the quaternary phosphonium<br>
chloride and iodide. Namely, this mixture to be treated<br>
is dissolved in an organic solvent in an amount of from 1<br>
to 10 times by weight to the sum of the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride and iodide in the mixture to be<br>
treated, and an iodide is added thereto.<br>
The type of the iodide to be added, the<br>
concentration and method for addition, the method for<br>
filtration of the precipitate, the subsequent treatment,<br>
etc. may be the same as in the above-described process of<br>
Application Example I.<br>
Further, also in this process, an aqueous iodide<br>
solution may be used instead of water for washing, and in<br>
such a case, addition of the iodide at a later stage will<br>
be unnecessary.<br>
In either case, by removing the organic solvent from<br>
the organic solvent solution after subjecting the<br>
precipitate of the inorganic chloride to solid-liquid<br>
separation, it is possible to further recover the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide, which may be reused<br>
together with the previously recovered quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide.<br>
Further, a highly concentrated catalyst solution<br>
wherein the concentration of the quaternary phosphonium<br>
iodide is at least 1/20 time to the ethylene glycol or<br>
which is concentrated to such a concentration, may be<br>
further concentrated, and after distilling off at least<br>
90% of the solvent, the solution may be maintained at a<br>
temperature of at least 9 0°C, whereby the liquid state<br>
can be maintained. Water is added thereto, followed by<br>
cooling to from 0 to 40°C, whereby it is possible to<br>
precipitate the quaternary phosphonium iodide. Otherwise,<br>
the above-mentioned concentrated residue may be<br>
continuously supplied alone or together with water to the<br>
already existing cool water or slurry, to carry out.<br>
precipitation. Also in this case, in the aqueous<br>
solution remaining after separation and recovery of the<br>
precipitated quaternary phosphonium iodide, an<br>
unprecipitated quaternary phosphonium iodide and chloride<br>
will be present.<br>
This may be used as a mixture to be treated, and as<br>
mentioned above, after concentrating it as the case<br>
requires, an iodide may be added to carry out conversion<br>
of the quaternary phosphonium chloride to the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide, and precipitation.<br>
Also in this case, the concentration of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride in the mixture to be<br>
treated prior to the addition of the iodide is preferably<br>
at least 1 wt%, and the type of the iodide to be added,<br>
the concentration and method for addition, the method for<br>
filtration of the precipitate, the subsequent treatment,<br>
etc. may be the same as in the above-described process of<br>
Application Example I.<br>
Thus, also in this case, water is already present in<br>
the system, and the iodide may be added in a solid form,<br>
whereby the amount of water to be used is consequently<br>
reduced, and the dissolution loss of the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide in waste water can be reduced.<br>
Further, as a mode to carry out the above process as<br>
shortened, it is also possible to use an aqueous iodide<br>
solution as heated, instead of water.<br>
The inorganic chloride precipitation operation may<br>
be carried out by using, as the mixture to be treated,<br>
one obtained by evaporating and removing preferably at<br>
least 90%, more preferably at least 99%, of water in this<br>
aqueous solution containing the quaternary phosphonium<br>
chloride and iodide. Namely, such a mixture to be<br>
treated is dissolved in an organic solvent in an amount<br>
of from 1 to 10 times by weight to the sum of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride and iodide in the mixture<br>
to be treated, and an iodide is added thereto.<br>
The type of the iodide to be added, the<br>
concentration and method for addition, the method for<br>
filtration of the precipitate, the subsequent treatment,<br>
etc. may be the same as in the above-described process of<br>
Application Example I.<br>
Also in this process, it is possible to use an<br>
aqueous iodide solution instead of waiter, and in such a<br>
case, addition of an iodide in the later stage will be<br>
unnecessary.<br>
In all embodiments, it is also possible to apply the<br>
present invention to the quaternary phosphonium chloride<br>
and iodide still remaining in the separated liquid after<br>
solid-liquid separation of the inorganic chloride<br>
precipitated by adding an iodide. Namely, it is also<br>
possible to repeatedly carry out addition of the iodide<br>
and removal of the inorganic chloride until the desired<br>
recovery rate is reached.<br>
In the application of the present invention, at<br>
least a part of the reaction solution and/or the catalyst<br>
solution is continuously or intermittently withdrawn from<br>
the reaction process which is continuously operated, and<br>
after carrying out concentration and/or pre-recovery as<br>
the case requires, conversion of the quaternary<br>
phosphonium chloride to a quaternary phosphonium iodide<br>
and recovery of the quaternary phosphonium iodide, are<br>
carried out, and the recovered quaternary phosphonium<br>
iodide catalyst may be recycled to the reactor. In such<br>
a case, the amount of the reaction solution and/or the<br>
catalyst solution withdrawn to recover the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide is not particularly limited. However,<br>
in order to maintain the reaction efficiency at a high<br>
level by removing the quaternary phosphonium chloride<br>
within a range not to excessively increase the cost for<br>
the recovery of the catalyst, it is preferred to<br>
continuously or intermittently withdraw the reaction<br>
solution and/or the catalyst solution for treatment when<br>
the weight ratio of the quaternary phosphonium chloride<br>
to the iodide in the reactor becomes within a range of<br>
from 0.01 to 1.0. The amount for the withdrawal is not<br>
particularly limited, but it is preferably within a range<br>
of from about 0.1 to 100 wt%, based on the amount of the<br>
reaction solution or the catalyst solution in the<br>
respective system.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Now, the present invention will be described in<br>
further detail with reference to Examples. However, it<br>
should be understood that the present invention is by no<br>
means restricted to such Examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1-1<br>
Into a first reactor pressurized to 2.0 MPa by<br>
carbon dioxide for a retention time of 1 hour at 100°C, 5<br>
parts by weight/hr of tributylmethylphosphonium iodide as<br>
a catalyst, 0.8 part by weight/hr of potassium carbonate,<br>
and 78 parts by weight/hr of the starting material<br>
ethylene oxide aqueous solution (60 wt%), were supplied<br>
to obtain a reaction solution comprising ethylene<br>
carbonate and ethylene glycol (EG). This solution was<br>
transferred in its entire amount to a second reactor for<br>
a retention time of 2 hours under a pressure of 0.5 MPa<br>
at a temperature of 150°C to have the contained ethylene<br>
carbonate hydrolyzed to obtain 66.5 parts by weight/hr of<br>
an aqueous solution of ethylene glycol, containing the<br>
catalyst.<br>
The obtained reaction solution was distilled by a<br>
vacuum distillation column having a bottom temperature of<br>
14 0°C under a pressure of 11 kPa (80 mmHg) to obtain a<br>
dehydrated liquid from the bottom, and the liquid was<br>
further subjected to a vacuum evaporator operated at<br>
140°C under a pressure of 8 kPa (60 mmHg) to evaporate<br>
the majority of ethylene glycol and to recover 13 parts<br>
by weight/hr of a catalyst solution having the catalyst<br>
concentrated, from the bottom of the evaporator. The<br>
recovered catalyst solution was recycled as a catalyst to<br>
the first reactor for reuse. The composition of the<br>
catalyst solution after the continuous operation for 1<br>
year was as follows:<br>
Composition of the Catalyst Solution<br>
Ethylene glycol: about 59 wt%<br>
Iodide (quaternary phosphonium iodide): about 33 wt%<br>
Chloride (quaternary phosphonium chloride):<br>
about 6 wt%<br>
Potassium carbonate: about 2 wt%<br>
After the above composition was reached, the<br>
operation was changed so that a part of this catalyst<br>
solution was withdrawn at a rate of 0.02 part by<br>
weight/hr. The withdrawn catalyst solution (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "withdrawn liquid A") was supplied to a<br>
flush vessel, and under conditions of 3 Torr (400 Pa) and<br>
12 8°C, about 93 wt% of ethylene glycol contained in the<br>
liquid was removed.<br>
The liquid after the removal of ethylene glycol<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "concentrated liquid A") was<br>
maintained at 95°C, and a 3 wt% potassium iodide aqueous<br>
solution was added, and the mixture was cooled to 20°C<br>
with stirring and mixing, whereupon it was left to stand<br>
for 1 hour. The potassium iodide added here was<br>
equimolar to the chloride in the concentrated liquid A,<br>
and the amount of water used was equal weight to the<br>
concentrated liquid A.<br>
The precipitate was separated by a vacuum filter and<br>
analyzed, whereby the composition of this precipitate was<br>
as follows. This indicates that it was possible to<br>
efficiently separate 90 wt% of the iodide and chloride in<br>
the withdrawn liquid A, as the quaternary phosphonium<br>
iodide catalyst.<br>
Composition of Precipitate<br>
Water: about 18 wt%<br>
Ethylene glycol: about 2 wt%<br>
Iodide (quaternary phosphonium iodide): about 80 wt%<br>
Chloride (quaternary phosphonium chloride):<br>
about 2 wt%<br>
Potassium carbonate: at most 1 wt%<br>
This precipitate was dissolved in ethylene glycol<br>
and recycled to the reactor.<br>
Thus, the operation was continued while recovery and<br>
recycling of the catalyst were carried out, whereby it<br>
was possible to continue the operation efficiently<br>
without a problem of a decrease in the reaction<br>
efficiency in the process for production of ethylene<br>
glycol.<br>
EXAMPLE 1-2<br>
In Example 1-1, instead of the potassium iodide<br>
aqueous solution, distilled water in the same amount as<br>
the concentrated liquid A, was added to the concentrated<br>
liquid A after separation and removal of ethylene glycol,<br>
and a similar operation was carried out to have a solid<br>
precipitated.<br>
The precipitate was separated and analyzed, whereby<br>
it was confirmed that this precipitate contained 94 wt%<br>
of the iodide and about 13 wt% of the chloride in the<br>
withdrawn liquid A, and it was possible to efficiently<br>
separate the quaternary phosphonium iodide catalyst from<br>
the chloride.<br>
In the liquid separated from the precipitate<br>
(hereinafter referred to as "separated liquid A"), about<br>
6 wt% of the iodide and about 87 wt% of the chloride in<br>
the withdrawn liquid A were dissolved. To such a<br>
separated liquid A, potassium iodide in an amount of 1.2<br>
times by mol to the chloride in the liquid was added in<br>
the form of a 50 wt% aqueous solution, and the mixture<br>
was left to stand still at 20°C for 1 hour. The<br>
precipitate was separated and analyzed, whereby it was<br>
confirmed that in this precipitate, it was possible to<br>
efficiently separate 50 wt% of the chloride in the<br>
withdrawn liquid A as the quaternary phosphonium iodide<br>
catalyst.<br>
EXAMPLE 1-3<br>
The separated liquid A obtained in Example 1-2 was<br>
distilled, and 50 wt% of water in the separated liquid A<br>
was distilled off for concentration. To such a<br>
concentrated liquid, potassium iodide in an amount of 1.2<br>
times by mol to the chloride in the liquid was added in<br>
the form of a 50 wt% aqueous solution, and the mixture<br>
was left to stand still at 2 0°C for 1 hour. The<br>
precipitate was separated and analyzed, whereby it was<br>
confirmed that in this precipitate, it was possible to<br>
efficiently separate about 7 5 wt% of the chloride in the<br>
withdrawn liquid A as the quaternary phosphonium iodide<br>
catalyst.<br>
EXAMPLE 2-1<br>
Into a first reactor pressurized to 2.0 MPa by<br>
carbon dioxide for a retention time of 1 hour at 100°C, 5<br>
parts by weight/hr of tributylmethylphosphonium iodide as<br>
a catalyst, 0.8 part by weight/hr of potassium carbonate,<br>
and 7 8 parts by weight/hr of a starting material ethylene<br>
oxide aqueous solution (60 wt%), were supplied to obtain<br>
a reaction solution comprising ethylene carbonate and<br>
ethylene glycol (EG) . This solution was in its entire<br>
amount transferred to a second reactor for a retention<br>
time of 2 hours, under a pressure of 0.5 MPa at a<br>
temperature of 150°C to have the contained ethylene<br>
carbonate hydrolyzed to obtain 66.5 parts by weight/hr of<br>
an aqueous solution of ethylene glycol, containing the<br>
catalyst.<br>
The obtained reaction solution was distilled by a<br>
vacuum distillation column at a bottom temperature of<br>
140°C under a pressure of 11 kPa (80 mmHg) to obtain a<br>
dehydrated liquid from the bottom, and the liquid was<br>
further subjected to a vacuum evaporator operated at<br>
140°C under a pressure of 8 kPa (60 mmHg) to evaporate<br>
the majority of ethylene glycol and to recover 13 parts<br>
by weight/hr of the catalyst solution having the catalyst,<br>
concentrated, from the bottom of the evaporator. The<br>
recovered catalyst solution was recycled as a catalyst to<br>
the first reactor for reuse. The composition of the<br>
catalyst solution after a continuous operation for 1 year,<br>
was as follows.<br>
Composition of the Catalyst Solution<br>
Ethylene glycol: about 59 wt%<br>
Iodide (quaternary phosphonium iodide): about 3 3 wt%<br>
Chloride (quaternary phosphonium chloride):<br>
about 6 wt%<br>
Potassium carbonate: about 2 wt%<br>
After the above composition was reached, the<br>
operation was changed so that a part of this catalyst<br>
solution was withdrawn at a rate of 0.02 part by<br>
weight/hr. The withdrawn catalyst solution (hereinafter<br>
referred to as "withdrawn liquid A") was supplied to a<br>
flush vessel, and about 93 wt% of ethylene glycol<br>
contained in the liquid was removed under conditions of 3<br>
Torr (40 0 Pa) and 12 8°C. The liquid after removal of<br>
ethylene glycol (hereinafter referred to as "concentrated<br>
product A") was maintained at 9 5°C, and water in the same<br>
amount as the concentrated product A was added, and the<br>
mixture was cooled to 2 0°C with stirring and mixing,<br>
whereupon it was left to stand still for 1 hour.<br>
The precipitate (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"precipitate A") was separated by a vacuum separator, and<br>
the obtained filtrate (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"filtrate A") was analyzed, whereby the composition of<br>
this filtrate A was as follows and was one containing<br>
about 8 0 wt% of the chloride in the withdrawn liquid A.<br>
Composition of Filtrate A<br>
Water: about 7 8 wt%<br>
Ethylene glycol: about 7 wt%<br>
Iodide (quaternary phosphonium iodide): about 1 wt%<br>
Chloride (quaternary phosphonium chloride):<br>
about 10 wt%<br>
Potassium carbonate: 4 wt%<br>
On the other hand, the above precipitate A was<br>
analyzed, whereby the composition of the precipitate A<br>
was as follows, and this was one containing about 98 wt%<br>
of the iodide in the above withdrawn liquid A.<br>
Composition of Precipitate A<br>
Water: about 16 wt%<br>
Ethylene glycol: about 1 wt%<br>
Iodide (quaternary phosphonium iodide): about 80 wt%<br>
Chloride (quaternary phosphonium chloride):<br>
about 2 wt%<br>
Potassium carbonate: at most 1 wt%<br>
Water and ethylene glycol contained in the filtrate<br>
A were removed by means of an evaporator operated at<br>
140°C. Along with the removal of water and ethylene<br>
glycol, the pressure was reduced, and finally, 5 Torr<br>
(660 Pa) was maintained for 3 0 minutes. By this<br>
operation, the amount of water and ethylene glycol<br>
contained in the distillation residue became at most 10<br>
wt%. To the residue after thus removing water and<br>
ethylene glycol, acetone in the same amount by weight was<br>
added. Then, the obtained liquid was transferred to a<br>
vessel equipped with a stirrer, and sodium iodide in an<br>
amount of 1.2 times by mol to the contained chloride was<br>
added in the form of a solid, followed by stirring at<br>
room temperature for 1 hour. The precipitate formed by<br>
this inorganic chloride precipitation operation was<br>
separated by a vacuum filter and analyzed, whereby in<br>
this precipitate, sodium chloride corresponding to at<br>
least 98 wt% of the chloride in the filtrate A, was<br>
present.. On the other hand, the filtrate obtained by<br>
this solid-liquid separation (hereinafter referred to as<br>
"filtrate B") was introduced into an evaporator operated<br>
under 5 Torr (660 Pa) at 110°C, and substantially all<br>
amounts of acetone and ethylene glycol in the filtrate B<br>
were evaporated, and the obtained solid was mixed with<br>
water in the same amount by weight and washed, followed<br>
by solid-liquid separation by a vacuum filter. The<br>
obtained solid (hereinafter referred to as "solid B") was<br>
analyzed and found to have the following composition.<br>
Composition of Solid B<br>
Water: about 17 wt%<br>
Ethylene glycol: at most 1 wt%<br>
Iodide (quaternary phosphonium iodide): about 81 wt%<br>
Chloride (quaternary phosphonium chloride):<br>
at most 1 wt%<br>
Sodium iodide: about 1 wt%<br>
One having this solid B and the above precipitate A<br>
combined, contains about 9 8 wt% of the iodide and the<br>
chloride in the withdrawn liquid A, as the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide, which was dissolved in ethylene<br>
glycol in the same amount by weight and recycled to the<br>
reactor for reuse.<br>
Thus, while recovery and recycling of the catalyst<br>
were carried out, the operation was continued, whereby it<br>
was possible to continue the operation efficiently<br>
without a problem of a decrease in the reaction<br>
efficiency in the process for producing ethylene glycol.<br>
EXAMPLE 2-2<br>
In Example 2-1, to the concentrated product A after<br>
separation and removal of ethylene glycol, n-butanol in<br>
the same amount by weight was added as an organic solvent<br>
for dissolution. This solution was transferred to a<br>
vessel equipped with a stirrer, and potassium iodide in<br>
the same molar amount as the chloride contained in the<br>
liquid, was added, followed by mixing at room temperature<br>
for 2 hours.<br>
The precipitate was separated by a vacuum filter and<br>
analyzed, whereby in this precipitate, potassium chloride<br>
corresponding to at least 95 wt% of the chloride<br>
contained in the concentrated product A, was present.<br>
On the other hand, the filtrate was introduced into<br>
an evaporator operated under 5 Torr (660 Pa) at 110°C,<br>
and substantially all amounts of butanol and ethylene<br>
glycol in the filtrate were evaporated. The obtained<br>
solid was mixed with water in the same amount by weight<br>
and washed, followed by solid-liquid separation by a<br>
vacuum filter. The obtained solid was analyzed and found<br>
to have the following composition, and it was one<br>
containing about 9 5 wt% of the iodide and the chloride in<br>
the withdrawn liquid A in the form of the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide.<br>
Composition of Solid<br>
Water: about 18 wt%<br>
Ethylene glycol: 2 wt%<br>
Iodide (quaternary phosphonium iodide): about 80 wt%<br>
Chloride (quaternary phosphonium chloride):<br>
at most 1 wt%<br>
Potassium iodide: at most about 1 wt%<br>
This solid was dissolved in ethylene glycol in the<br>
same amount by weight and recycled to the reactor for<br>
reuse.<br>
Thus, while recovery and recycling of the catalyst<br>
were carried out, the operation was continued, whereby it<br>
was possible to continue the operation efficiently<br>
without a problem of a decrease in the reaction<br>
efficiency in the process for producing ethylene glycol.<br>
COMPARATIVE EXAMPLE 1<br>
In Example 1-1, 100 g of the dehydrated reaction<br>
solution was withdrawn from the bottom of the vacuum<br>
distillation column. The ratio of ethylene glycol to the<br>
catalyst contained therein was 87%. Water in the same<br>
amount by weight was added thereto, and the mixture was<br>
cooled to 0°C, but no precipitate was formed.<br>
EXAMPLE 1-4<br>
To the filtrate obtained in Example 1-2, potassium<br>
iodide in an amount of 1 time by mol to the chloride in<br>
the liquid, was added in the form of a 50 wt% aqueous<br>
solution, and the mixture was left to stand still at 20°C<br>
for 1 hour. The precipitate was sepcirated and analyzed.<br>
As a result, it was confirmed that in this precipitate,<br>
it was possible to effectively separate about 87 wt% of<br>
the chloride in the filtrate, as the quaternary<br>
phosphonium iodide catalyst.<br>
INDUSTRIAL APPLICABILITY<br>
According to the present invention, in a process for<br>
producing an alkylene derivative, such as an alkylene<br>
glycol such as ethylene glycol, or an alkylene carbonate<br>
such as ethylene carbonate, which comprises reacting an<br>
alkylene oxide such as ethylene oxide with water or<br>
carbon dioxide, in the presence of carbon dioxide, by<br>
means of a quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide<br>
catalyst, it is possible to efficiently recover the<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide or bromide catalyst from<br>
the reaction system and to recycle it for use, or it is<br>
possible to convert the quaternary phosphonium chloride<br>
formed in the reaction system, efficiently to a<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide, which can<br>
be recycled to the reaction system for reuse. Thus, it<br>
is possible to prevent accumulation in the system of the<br>
quaternary phosphonium chloride having a low catalytic<br>
activity and at the same time to convert it to a<br>
quaternary phosphonium iodide and/or bromide having a<br>
high catalytic activity and to recycle it for use,<br>
whereby it is possible to maintain the catalytic activity<br>
in the system at a high level and to carry out the<br>
reaction to form the alkylene derivative constantly and<br>
effectively over a long period of time.<br>
The present invention is based on Japanese Patent<br>
Application No. 2003-031391 (filed on February 7, 2003),<br>
