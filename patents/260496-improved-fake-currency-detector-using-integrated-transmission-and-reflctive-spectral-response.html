				<td>IMPROVED FAKE CURRENCY DETECTOR USING INTEGRATED TRANSMISSION AND REFLECTIVE SPECTRAL RESPONSE<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to the development of an improved system for automatic detection of authenticity of currency notes by measuring reflected and transmitted components of incident energy. The system involves the use of UV-visible along with optional near infra red light source, Photodetectors and associated sensing circuitry. The present invention relates to the use of photoelectric signal generated by photodetectors from the reflected and transmitted energy received from a currency note to verify its authenticity under UV-visible along with optional near infra red illumination. The process involves measurement of energy reflected and transmitted as photoelectric signals from a currency note in at least three optical wavebands by suitably located photodetectors and the electronic signal processing to distinguish between a genuine currency from a fake one for ultimate LED indicator display and audio-visual alarms, hence the detection of fake currency note.<br>
Background and Prior Art to the Invention<br>
Presently available currency detectors can be classified into two categories, namely viewer type and automated type. All the viewer type instruments rely on subjective visual assessment of authenticity. Few of the viewers display a magnified view of micro-features under visible light. In some the viewers, a currency note is illuminated by UV light to display fluorescent security features like fibres, UV fluorescent printed pattern. Most automatic type detection systems are currency counters also. The verification in some automated type systems is based on UV measurement of fluoresced/reflected UV radiation from a narrow strip of the currency note; the data are collected by moving the note across a detector and measuring the energy from a small area at a time i.e. by scanning and sampling technique. The measured energy is converted into an electrical signal. Data acquired from a genuine currency notes is set as reference. Any deviation of the measured signal from this reference value is indicative of counterfeit. The few of the automatic verifiers measure reflected/fluoresced UV light from UV fluorescent security feature(s). Some currency verifiers are based on scanning a part of the printed pattern and looks for inconsistent locations of the small dots of the printing material. With the advent of technology, art<br><br>
of counterfeiting is also progressing rapidly. Earlier, fake currencies were produced either by colour scanning followed by high-resolution printing (alternatively colour photocopying) or by crude printing on non-security papers. The today's bank notes incorporate several security features like intaglio printing, optically variable ink (OVI) features, and UV fluorescent features including fluorescent fibres. Clever counterfeiters are now attempting to duplicate these features including fluorescent properties of the paper. A very thin line of demarcation now exits between a counterfeit currency note and an authentic one. At least two different modes of verification are imperative to assess the authenticity. The visual and UV fluorescent security features incorporated in a currency note vary from country to country and also denomination dependent. The judgement of authenticity of a currency note relying either on visual assessment or on rapid opto-electronic detection 'on-the-fly' technique based on scanning the light reflected or transmitted from a narrow zone may likely to yield misleading conclusions. A suitable apparatus providing the combination of integrated reflected as well as transmitted energy, received from a large area of a currency note, measurement facilities in at least three different wavebands both for the reflected and transmitted components, in static condition of the currency note, which can be adopted for the currencies from various countries of different denominations or in various physical conditions of the note to be inspected is not available.<br>
Analysis of prior art<br>
The following basic principles are used to verify the genuineness of a currency note:<br>
i     Visually observing the UV fluorescent features, printed or embedded, of the<br>
currency note<br>
ii Reading the magnetically recorded code by a magnetic sensor iii Assessing the quality of print by studying the mis-registration iv Assessing the currency paper quality by measuring the quantum of UV light<br>
reflected/transmitted v     Assessing the currency paper quality by measuring the quantum of UV light<br>
fluoresced<br>
vi     Assessing a electronically recorded image vii     Multifunctional apparatus for discrimination and authentication<br>
All the above cited prior arts rely on one of these principles - variations are in the techniques of data collection and the area of the currency note from where data are collected. The drawbacks of the prior arts are discussed below. The paper used in currency notes has cotton based fibres as the base material that shows very little UV fluorescent property. Other types of paper convert incident UV radiation into visible light. The amount of UV light reflected and fluoresced are complimentary as higher is the quotient of fluorescence, less is the amount reflected and vice versa. So, the measurement one or the other provides similar information. Transmittance also depends on fluorescence since, if large fluorescence will reduce the transmitted components. Accordingly, principles mentioned under (iii) and (iv) above are some similar in nature, data interpretations. All the existing prior arts employing the principals (ii) and (iii) differ in the measurand, and technique of scanning and the zone of data acquisition. These have common limitations. The drawbacks of the all the prior arts are discussed below, apparatuses are classified in accordance with their principle of operation.<br>
Visually observing the printed or embedded UV fluorescent features Prior arts listed in the patent US5942759 and US2001054644 belongs to this category. These are basically viewers where in the operator exposes the currency note to UV radiation and looks for the presence or absence of printed or embedded UV fluorescent features like serial no., floral or other patterns, thread and fibres etc. These instruments rely on two dimensional image capabilities of human eye and data processing power of the brain. Drawbacks are:<br>
•	Decision is subjective and needs a priori knowledge about an authentic<br>
currency note identical in all respect, except physical conditions, to the one<br>
under verification.<br>
•	It is practically impossible to stock standard samples either as images in the<br>
brain or physically corresponding currency notes of different denominations<br>
from various countries.<br>
Modern counterfeits incorporate many UV fluorescent printed features to fool an operator relying on visual inspection only. Viewer types are not relevant to the present invention.<br>
Magnetic Sensor based equipment<br>
Prior arts listed in the patent US4464787 and US5874742 fall under this category. The drawbacks are:<br>
•	Magnetic code readers are basically currency discriminators - magnetic code<br>
can be duplicated easily and hence not a reliable method of authentication<br>
•	Currency  notes  from  many  countries  do  not  contain  magnetic  codes.<br>
Genuineness of currency notes from these countries can not be assessed.<br>
•	Magnetic code of a currency note may be wiped out due to accidental<br>
exposure to strong magnetic field, magnetic sensor based instruments would<br>
fail to authenticate such a note.<br>
•	Some machines scan the currency note to determine its dimensions for hence<br>
authentication. Dimensional data is unreliable.<br>
These apparatuses are also not closest prior art.<br>
Instruments based on assessing the quality of print by studying the mis-registration Prior arts listed in the patent US4482971 belong to this category. Currency notes counterfeited by high resolution scanning and printing or colour photocopying process. The instruments scan and look for presence of small dots of printing ink inconsistent with the printed pattern. The main drawback is:<br>
•	Modern counterfeited currency notes are printed  in sophisticated notes<br>
duplicating most of the processes employed to print authentic currency notes<br>
without any discernable mis-registration error. These types of notes cannot be<br>
authenticated by studying the mis-registration error.<br>
These apparatuses are also not closest prior art.<br>
Instruments based on of the quantum of UV light fluoresced/reflected/transmitted<br>
energy measurement<br>
Prior arts listed in the patent US4482971 and FR2710998 belongs to this category. All<br>
of these scan a narrow zone, sampling a small area at a time, while the currency note<br>
moves below or over the photodetector. Measurand is either the reflected or<br>
transmitted or fluoresced component of incident UV light (there is only one patent,<br>
FR2710998, which measures transmitted energy and the rest measure the reflected<br>
energy). UV light is either blocked (fluorescent measurement) or rest of the optical<br>
spectrum is blocked only UV light is allowed to pass (UV reflectance/transmittance<br>
measurement) by a filter. The drawbacks are:<br>
•	Measured fluoresced/reflected/transmitted energy data corresponding to UV<br>
region of the spectrum alone cannot reliably characterize the paper quality.<br>
Cleverly       counterfeited       currency       notes       can       mimic       UV<br>
fluoresce/reflection/transmission coefficient sufficiently close to that of a<br>
currency paper.<br>
•	The source is kept very close to the moving currency note, so the data are<br>
collected from a very small area. The measured energy from each small<br>
sampled area is either compared to a reference data (collected from similar<br>
type authentic currency note) or summed up to compare with similar data<br>
collected from a reference sample. Soiling and or mutilations of the currency<br>
under authentication would cause substantial amount of data distortion to<br>
reliably assess authentication.<br>
•	It is known that an accidentally washed genuine note in certain detergent<br>
develops UV fluorescent quality. Such a note would be indicated as a<br>
counterfeit.<br>
•	This principle needs motion of the currency note, and performs only first order<br>
verification during stacking/counting of unsoiled notes of similar type. It is not<br>
a compact and cheap system.<br>
•	Some apparatuses measure the fluorescent energy emanated from certain<br>
printed features, e.g. thread. These need accurate placement of the said<br>
feature(s)   under  the  photodetector.   Since  currency  notes  of different<br>
denominations from different countries contain UV sensitive features at<br>
different locations, instruments based on measuring UV fluorescence (by any<br>
printed pattern) can be usefully employed for US Dollars only, as all US<br>
Dollars have same size and are reasonably similar.<br>
There is only one patent US4618257 which uses multiple sources emitting different waveband to illuminate a very small zone of the currency note under verification and a single detector collects the energy for each waveband in sequential manner. Since the data corresponds to a small zone, local physical condition, like soiling, mutilation etc. would severely affect the proper authentication process. Assessing a electronically recorded image<br>
The patent US20030169415 uses a CCD camera to record the image and by trichromatic colour analysis technique judges the authenticity. The drawbacks are:<br>
•	Soiling, mutilation, physical damage etc. would lead to erroneous results<br>
•	Expensive and complex<br>
•	Basically designed for passport and similar kinds of documents.<br>
Multifunctional apparatus for discrimination and authentication<br>
US20030081824A1, claims for an improved fake currency detector using different<br>
kinds of sensor output. A brief description of is principle of operation and drawbacks<br>
are given below:<br>
A multifunctional apparatus is using multiple magnetic and optical sensors. The magnetic sensors scan and generate a magnetic code. Optical sensors scan the currency note in terms reflected energy in two wave bands. Colour matching scheme is also has been claimed to be employed. The two types filters used are used, namely UV pass and UV blocking. UV blocking visible pass filter is made a combination of two filters namely a blue filter passing 320nm to 620nm with a peak at 450nm and a yellow filter passing 415 to 2800nm. So, the visible light sensor sees 415nm to 620nm i.e. it senses blue to a small part of red colour. The drawbacks are:<br>
•	Authentication is largely dependent on magnetic and optical  scanning.<br>
Currency notes of many countries do not have any magnetic code.<br>
•	In many countries, old notes have threads which do not contain any special<br>
optical feature. Such notes would be identified as fake, even if genuine.<br>
•	The optical authentication is based on thread parameters. Currency notes of<br>
many countries, including India, have different series of same denomination<br>
with a wide variation in thread locations. The tolerance limit of 0.05 inch<br>
permissible in the patent application would reject authentic currency notes.<br>
•	A genuine note accidentally discoloured due to bleaching etc. would be<br>
indicated as fake.<br>
•	The principle used can not properly authenticate genuine currency notes<br>
having no fluorescence feature (text or thread), such as Asoka pillar Indian<br>
currency series of Rs.50 and Rs.100 denomination notes, still in wide<br>
circulation in India.<br>
•	The optical authentication is based on printed image pattern and thread data.<br>
Clever counterfeiter can duplicate printed patterns.<br>
•	The apparatus can not detect NIR sensitive features likely to incorporate in the<br>
currency notes of various countries.<br>
•	The apparatus is complex, expensive and not portable.<br>
Another prior art US4618257 incorporates two LEDs positioned at such angles that they illuminate a common target area and a broad band photo detector to measure the light reflected from the target area. As the currency note is transported under the LEDs, each of the LEDs is switched on sequentially with a pre-determined 'on-time' and 'delay time'. The preferred LED pair is comprised of one narrow band red LED and the other narrow band green LED having peak emission wavelengths of 630nm and 560nm respectively. The patent suggests the alternative use of yellow or infrared LED. The measured signals in terms of voltages are compared with the corresponding reference values stored in a memory. The drawbacks of this apparatus are:<br>
•	It does not collect any data corresponding to the reflectance or fluorescence of<br>
UV or blue colour. Reflectance information is confined to only about half of<br>
the optical spectral range of 350 to 750nm. Our experiment has shown, as<br>
explained later in Example 1, that UV-blue reflectance property of a currency<br>
note is a strong indicator of its genuineness due to the very basic nature of the<br>
currency paper.<br>
•	Due to various reasons including local conditions of a currency note, reflected<br>
data from a small area may not be the true representative of the bulk<br>
properties.<br>
•	The apparatus collects data from a specified small target area making it highly<br>
position sensitive particularly in case of currency notes of varied sizes.<br>
All known automated currency verifiers require transport mechanism, and cannot operate in stationary condition of the document under. These verifiers pick up one document from a stack of multiple numbers of similar documents, transport it from one place to other and verify authenticity on the fly by scanning it. Such systems are suitable basically for currency note, but can not properly handle documents like bank draft, security bond and other bank instruments where each document is likely very different from the other in shape, size and other similar parameters. There is no patent sealed or filed till date wherein one off a kind documents like, bank drafts, security bonds and other bank instruments and security documents which require manual feeding, can be authenticated by automatic detection mode.<br>
There is no patent sealed or filed till date, which embodies automatic opto-electronic detection techniques using at least three optical wavebands to generate transmittance and reflectance/fluorescence data by measuring both transmitted and reflected energy. There is no patent sealed or filed till date, which embodies automatic opto-electronic detection technique using more than one optical wavebands to obtain transmittance and reflectance/fluorescence data by spatially integrating energy received from a large area of the document under verification.<br>
There is no known prior art claiming to authenticate polymer based currency notes. The present invention circumvents the drawbacks of existing prior arts by providing two independent methods of verification and more than one optical band to detect authenticity in automatic mode in a stationary condition of the of the document under authentication by performing large area spatial and temporal integrations simultaneously. However, the techniques and the system can also be adopted in a currency note counting machine by collecting dynamic data at various scanning points. The present invention provides an apparatus that can be used to authenticate paper and polymer based currency note, bank drafts, security bonds and other bank instruments and security documents without any need to modify system hardware.

Summary of the Invention<br>
A currency genuineness detection system using plurality of opto-electronic sensors with both transmission and reflective (including fluorescence) properties of security documents is developed. Both detection sensing strategies utilise integrated response of the wide optical band sensed under UV visible along with optional near infra red light illumination. A security document is examined under static condition. A window signal signature is thus possible from photodetectors responses for various kinds of<br><br>
documents of different denominations, kinds and country of origin. A programmable technique for checking the genuineness of a security document is possible by feeding a unique code of the currency under examination.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Security documents of various kinds like, currency notes, bank instruments, passport, visa, security bonds etc. can be authenticated by the present invention. However, for brevity, the words currency note are used in following description and these words by no means restrict the applicability of the system.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 show the front view and block diagram of the invention respectively. All the walls, the ceiling and floors are so constructed that no stray light reaches any of the photodetectors from outside. The three LEDs la, Ib &amp; Ic are fitted to the front panel to indicate the status of inspection. In no note condition, system diagnostics is continuously performed and a yellow LED marked "Ready" glows indicating proper functioning. The insertion of a currency note makes either of LEDs marked "Pass" or "Fake" glow depending upon authenticity. A digital display 2 shows the programmable unique code provided to each type (including the nature and country of origin) whose reference values are stored as firmware. The code is appropriately chosen at the time of examination of the currency by the apparatus. A UV fluorescent tube light 3a mounted such a height that it fully illuminates a suitably placed currency note. An additional compact near infra red source 3b can be mounted by the side of the fluorescent tube. There are two Sensor Heads 4a and 4b for reflection and transmission sensing respectively. Each sensor head consists of at least three photodetector-band pass filter combination (5b as shown in the inset of Figure 2) with built-in amplification with a lower cut-off wavelength of 350nm (for example<br><br>
UDT455HS), and they are closely spaced together. Sensor heads 4a and 4b are so positioned that each receives light from at least half the area, in case the document is of large size other wise from the total surface area of the document under authentication 6, one above the note for reflection sensing and the other one below it for transmission sensing. The band pass characteristics of each filter are different but together they cover UV visible along with optional near infra red spectrum. These photodetectors generate electrical signals corresponding to the received light energy. The filters used in sensor head 4a may or may not be similar to those used in sensor head 4b. During verification, the document 6 is inserted in a specified manner between two glass plates, 7a and 7b. One side of each glass plate 7a and 7b is a ground surface. Glass plates 7a and 7b are fixed between sensor heads 4a and 4b such that the their ground surfaces facing sensor heads 4a and 4b and the note 6 is evenly illuminated all over, at the same time sensor heads 4a and 4b receive reflected/transmitted light from at least half of the note 6. The currency note is held in place in the gap 10, between glass plates 7a and 7b. The gap 10 is so adjusted that the document can be easily and smoothly inserted at the same time it tends to flatten out the gross unevenness due to folding etc. Proper adjustment of the gap 10 keeps the surface of a note 6 flat and also blocks stray light from creeping on to sensor heads 4a and 4b. The UV source 3, sensors 4a and 4b, processing electronics 8, glass plates 7a and 7b and other associated electronic circuitry 8, are enclosed in an enclosed box 9, having a ceiling, floor, two side walls and a front panel. A narrow slit 10, in the front panel allows a currency note to be inserted between 7a and 7b. Width and depth of the box is such that it can accommodate different kinds of documents from different countries. To cut-down stray light due to internal reflections, both the edges of glass plate 7a are painted dull black through the depth direction such that about 84mm of the central part remains clear for transmission and reflection measurements. Switch 11 puts on/off the power supply from mains.<br>
Figure 3 shows the block diagram of the electronic sub-system. For brevity only three photodetectors in a single sensor head is shown. The number is only indicative and not restrictive. As mentioned earlier, sensor heads 4a and 4b provide three signals each, thus generating six analog signals. A multiplexer 12, and A/D converter 13 combination lets a microcontroller 14 sample all these signals acquired for further processing. These are normalized for reliable authentication as explained later. Reference data generated from various currency notes data are stored in the memory<br><br><br>
unit 15 as firmware for authentication. In addition, country and currency specific weights also form a part of another firmware 16. The user has a provision to programme the sensitivity and the desired currency code through keys 17 (not shown). In operation audio visual alarms 18 provide the result of authentication. The following is a mathematical analysis of the working of the present invention. Figure 4 shows the ray diagram. When a currency note is placed under a broad source of light every point on it receives incidence radiation from different source points at different angles. Any point on the active area of a sensor head 4b, placed at height z would receive transmitted light flux dF corresponding to a waveband of dλ from an elementary areadx.dy 19 of the security document 6, given by the following equation:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
And 4b would generate an electrical signal     λ given by:<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
where,<br>
k(λ):  A  wavelength  dependent  constant of proportionality  indicating energy<br>
conversion efficiency of the photodetector and filter combine<br>
tλxy: Transmittance corresponding to wavelength  λ at P(x, y)<br>
b(,λ x, y) : Incident energy- depends upon the source type and its location<br>
(x, y) : coordinates of the centre point P of the elementary area taking the foot of the<br>
normal drawn from the detector surface to the plane of security document as the<br>
origin.<br>
The electrical signal generated by a point on the detector surface corresponding to<br>
waveband of (λ1-λ2) is given by,<br>
(Equation Removed)<br>
The inner integration is performed over the waveband while two outer integrals correspond to the area viewed by the photodetector when a security document is placed inside the built in dark chamber of the present invention. Equation (1) gives<br><br>
signal generated by a point on the photodetector. Actual signal measured would be sum the signals of all points on the active area of the photodetector. It would enhance the signal level only, for brevity, not shown in the equation.<br>
The non-uniform illumination term b(λ,x,y) remains reasonably high within the limits of the integration, if the angles subtended by the extreme points of the source are not large at any point of the part of the security document under inspection. In the present invention this achieved by not keeping the broad source close to the security document. Also, tixy is the average value of transmittance over the waveband and is<br>
also a function of local conditions like soiling/mutilation and the type and amount of printed matter. Placed at a distance of 50mm or more, the 4b would receive sufficient light flux from at least half the area of a document under authentication 6. The process of spatial integration reduces the effect of aberration, due to local perturbations, to an insignificant level. Consequently, the measured signal S is truly indicative of the average transmittance of the document material corresponding to the selected waveband.<br>
In the present invention 5b, coupled with a specific optical wavelength filters, simultaneously and independently measure spectral transmittance in the three selected optical wave bands. Signals Sj, 82, 82 from each photodetector are given by,<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Where, t,1,x,y, t,2,x,y, t,3,x,y are the average transmittance values corresponding to the<br>
three optical filters 5b.<br>
The unit-less voltage ratio sets [S,/(Si+S2+S3), S2/(S]+S2+S3), S3(Si+S2+S3)], [Si/S2, 81/83,, SyS^and many similar algebraic variants (using viz. squares of various voltages) form feature sets that characterize the document material in terms of its transmitting properties in three wavebands. Similar set of data, [Sri/(Sri+Sr2+Sr3),S2/(Sr1i+ś2+Sr3), ś3/ś1+ś2+ś3)] or [S1t/S2. S1/ś3. ś2/ś3] corresponding to the reflected/fluoresced energy characterize the document material in terms of its spectral reflectance properties. The choice of such sets is dependent upon the class of documents under examination. For currency, the former of the above explained sets is preferred. The normalised spectral transmitting and reflecting properties would uniquely define the document of any nature and kind from any country and efficiently distinguish between the genuine and fake ones. For experiments conducted chosen wavebands were UV blue, yellow and red and corresponding ratios (percentages) of the individual to total response were computed.<br>
Figure 5 shows the system software flow-chart where in three photodetectors for reflection and three photodetectors for transmission measurements are shown numbers are only indicative and not restrictive. Omitting the usual diagnostics at power-on and a user selection of the currency under examination, a stage is reached where the system is in operation and examining the currency of interest with appropriate code of the document. With this information, it is in detection mode. It can detect not only genuineness but add to self-diagnosis linked with various sensors and source modules along with associated circuitry. As a routine, it senses the presence of the document 6 and the sensor signals in the overall working range. Only if the normal behaviour is observed by the sensors 4a and 4b and the associated circuitry, the routine progresses further to acquire data for processing. In such condition, the microcontroller 14 instructs the multiplexer 15 for scanning six inputs which are converted into digital form by the A/D Converter 13. The voltage readings are normalised by ratios suggested later in Equation 4a,b and c to form various percentages. Various sets (=n) can be formed depending upon the choice of features to be used. In this manner, since there are three bands and two sensor heads 4a&amp;b (w=6), we get a maximum of 6« normalised features (Xi in percentage form) to be used for detection. Our data in various tables given later shows only a single normalisation (n=l) with various colour band readings normalised to the total of the six (three from transmission and three from reflection) readings. The next step provides various outputs (O/ =1 or 0) for each of these feature values using Reference Database 15. The results so obtained are weighted as per the Weight Matrix 16 suited for a series of documents to generate a score value to provide minimum errors of detection. Finally, a user selectable Sensitivity level using keypad 17 is provided for acceptability of the detection. Using these levels, a strict or loose score is used to<br>
detect the genuineness and accordingly audio-visual alarm 18 is set for "Pass" or<br>
"Fake" situation. In either case, the loop continues to sense the presence of note and<br>
accordingly generate the genuineness result.<br>

Having given the principle of the currency sensing automatically, we now provide the<br>
schematic design of the system which allows genuine currency paper's properties to<br>
be used for testing its authenticity.<br>
The special characteristics of the instrument and where it can be used are as follows:<br>
A system useful for sensing currency detection automatically.<br>
A system claimed herein wherein two sets of optoelectronic sensors are used and<br>
integrated response under UV light is used.<br>
A system useful for testing multiple countries' currency in a programmed manner<br>
based on quantitative measurement of reflective and transmission properties for<br>
automatic detection.<br>
A system allowing standard photo detectors to be used.<br>
The invention is described in detail in the examples given below which are provided<br>
by way of illustration and therefore should not be considered to limit the present<br>
invention in any manner. In all the examples cited below, a set of three standards<br>
filters (Blue, Yellow and Red) KL1500 from Schott have been used. The raw signal<br>
values 51, 52, and S3 were normalised by dividing each of them by the sum factor<br>
(S1+S2+S3), converted into a percentage readings. Hence only one normalised set<br>
(n=1) was used. The same approach is applied for both transmission and reflection<br>
sensing. Also the currency specific weight matrix 16 had no special weighting as all<br>
weights had equal values.<br>
Example 1<br>
For experimental testing of the proposed apparatus, a fake Indian currency note of denomination 'A' (Series-2) was checked. Table I shows, that the yellow and red band reflection readings of the fake note were within the acceptable range, showing the note as genuine. However, all transmission and the blue band reflection readings of the fake note clearly identified it to be fake.<br>
Example 2<br>
For experimental testing of the proposed apparatus, a fake Indian currency note of denomination 'B' (Series-2) was checked. Table II shows that the blue and yellow band reflection readings were out of the permissible range, while the red band indicated genuineness. The experiment shows that confirmation of a majority rule is essential for currency verification particularly for cleverly counterfeit notes incorporating all UV visible security features.<br>
Example 3<br>
For experimental testing of the proposed apparatus, a fake Indian currency note of denomination value 'A" Series-1 (old series, which did not contain any UV fluorescent feature but still in circulation) was checked. All the reflection data failed to identify it as a fake. However, all transmission data for all the bands were well beyond the permissible range. It concludes that properly weighted all reflection and transmission data is imperative to verify authenticity of a currency note.<br>
Example 4<br>
For experimental testing of apparatus, a number of genuine Indian currency notes of denomination 'A', 'B' and 'C' under moderate usage were verified. The results show that the "majority rule of acceptance" using the reference data given in Table I-III, identified all the notes as genuine.<br>
Example 5<br>
For experimental testing of apparatus, a moderately used genuine Indian currency note of denomination 'A' Series-2, was subjected to application of a commercial detergent. The same note was inspected for its authenticity. The measured blue, red and yellow wave band reflection readings were 14.7%, 41.035% and 44.265%. From Table I, it can be seen that the blue band readings was beyond the permissible range while the other two were within the permissible range. It shows that "majority rule of acceptance" of the apparatus identifies a genuine currency note as genuine even though it had accidentally acquired UV fluorescent properties of a fake currency note.<br>
Example 6<br>
For experimental testing of apparatus, five soiled but genuine Indian currency notes of denomination 'A' were tested for their responses in three wave bands. The notes were then thoroughly cleaned by laboratory grade alcohol. The wave band responses of the cleaned notes were measured with those of the unsoiled conditions. It was found that the readings did not vary much. This shows that the instrument is insensitive to the physical conditions of the note.<br>
Example 7<br>
The invented technique can be extended to the polymer based currency without any need to modify the apparatus. For experimental testing of the proposed apparatus, polymer based currency notes of three countries were used, taking two currency notes of same denomination from each country. For an elaborate judgement, both sides of both notes were used for checking the suitability of the apparatus in different conditions. Table IV shows all (yellow, red and blue) bands of both transmission and reflection readings. In different rows, the readings are very close to indicate that different notes provide a repeatable evidence for checking genuineness. Also, transmission characteristics in the three bands show sufficient evidence with close similarity within same currency and detectable dissimilarity among different currencies. However, for precise authentication, reflection readings are required to be complimented by the transmission readings.<br>
