7.     ABSTRACT OF  THE  INVENTION  (to  be  given  along  with  complete specification on separate page)<br><br>
METHOD OF SELECTING A REFERENCE PICTURE Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to encoding and decoding a moving picture.<br>
Background Art<br>
Moving picture coding systems compensate for motion using motion vector information. In the case of moving picture coding system that uses multiple reference pictures, reference picture index information as well as motion vector information is required for motion compensation. The reference picture index is a value that is used to distinguish multiple reference pictures from each other. A coder transfers the reference picture index to a decoder. The decoder selects the reference picture as indicated by the reference picture index, and performs motion compensation using the selected reference picture.<br>
Generally, scanning methods for images are classified into either progressive scanning or interlaced scanning. In the case of the progressive scanning, an image of one frame consists of data that are sampled at the same time. In case of the interlaced scanning, an image of one frame consists of data that are sampled at different times, and the samples are alternated line by line.<br>
The interlaced image of a frame is usually divided into two fields called a top field and a bottom field. In the interlaced scanning, one frame is divided into two field images. In this specification, an image is treated based on a unit of a picture. A frame or a field may be referred to as a picture.<br>
Three coding methods for an interlaced moving picture are proposed. A first 'coding method is a field picture coding method which performs a coding process considering each field as an independent picture at a picture or slice level. A second coding method is the frame picture coding method  which performs a coding process after combining two<br>
2.<br><br>
PCT/KR 2004/0 00 44 1PEA/KR 27 042005.<br>
fields into one frame at a picture or slice level. A third coding method is a frame picture coding method with frame/field macroblock, which performs a coding process by combining two fields .into one frame and selecting a frame<br>
     5 		mode- or a field mode at a macroblock level. .<br>
     In' the third coding method, two vertically adjacent<br>
macroblocks are bound into a pair and the coding is performed<br>
in unit of a macrobiock pair. In FIG. 1, numbers assigned in<br>
the. macrobiock pairs indicate macrobiock addresses that are<br>
10   used to distinguish, the macroblocks from each other.<br>
Here, a frame macrobiock- is a macrobiock which is coded<br>
at upper .and lower macroblocks of the macrobiock pair in-<br>
units of a frame.- In. other words, each macrobiock is coded<br>
in units of a frame- after two fields are combined into one<br>
15   frame.<br>
Meanwhile, a field macrobiock is a macrobiock that is .<br>
coded at upper and lower, macroblocks of macrobiock pairs in<br>
units of a field.  The macrobiock pair is divided into top<br>
and bottom field components . and each  field  is  coded<br>
    20   	independently.   At this time, the macrobiock pairs are<br>
rearranged 'so**"that the' upper" and lower macroblocks may<br>
' respectively contain only a top field component and only, a<br>
bottom. field component. The .upper macrobiock is called a top<br>
field macrobiock and the lower macrobiock is called a bottom<br>
25   field macrobiock.<br>
A reference buffer for storing multiple reference pictures is configured in units of a frame. In the frame picture coding, all reference pictures are considered .as units of a frame in which two fields are combined into one 30 frame, and one picture among the reference frame ..pictures is used- for motion .compensation. Accordingly, values are allocated to the reference picture indexes .in units of a frame.<br>
.The reference picture ' index for a P frame is obtained<br>
35   by sorting all -the reference frames -in an order reverse to a<br>
coding order and then sequentially allocating an index, which<br>
.. is increased by one, to -the- sorted reference 'frames.  The<br>
3<br><br>
PCT/KR 2004/O 00445 1PEA/KR 2 7.012005.<br>
reference picture index for a. B frame 'is classified into a list 0 and a list 1, and is determined based on a display order of the reference frame.<br>
First, in case of the reference frame list 0, indexes<br>
   5 are allocated in a reverse order to the reference frame-s<br>
     whose display order lags behind the B frame, and then, the<br>
     remaining indexes are allocated in the display order to the<br>
     reference frames whose display order leads the B frame. In<br>
     case ' of the reference, frame, list 1, in contrast to the<br>
 10  reference frame list 0, indexes are allocated in the display<br>
     order to the reference, frames whose display order leads the B-<br>
     frame, and then, the remaining indexes are allocated in a<br>
     reverse order to the reference frame whose display order lags<br>
     behind the B frame.  FIG. 2   shows a reference picture index<br>
 15  for a P frame when a size of the reference buffer is '5, and<br>
     FIG. 3 shows the reference picture index lists 0 and 1 for a.<br>
     B frame.	.<br>
In the field picture coding,  the fields  of all reference       pictures are considered as independent pictures and <br>
20	one of ;. the reference, field- pictures is used for motion     compensation.  Accordingly,  values are allocated to the -reference: picture indexes in units of a field. At. this time, ' life reference fields are combined in the unit of a frame, and then, the reference picture indexes in each field of the P <br>
25	frame are sorted in an order reverse to a coding order of the frame.  Then, index values that are increased by one are alternately allocated in an order- that starts from a reference field having parity equal to a current picture to a . reference field having parity different from the current <br>
30	 picture,  while visiting the sorted reference frames in sequence .<br>
' In addition, in the case of the reference picture index lists 0 	and. 1 for each field of a B frame, all the reference fields are combined in units of a frame and then a reference<br>
35	 frame is sorted- in the same manner as the method of determining reference frame index of. a B frame. Thereafter, the indexes that; are increased- by one are ' alternately<br><br>

1PEA/KR 2 7.0 4 2005.<br>
allocated in an order that starts from a reference field having parity equal to a current picture to a reference field having parity different from the current picture,  while visiting the sorted reference frames. in sequence. <br>
5    FIG, 4-   shows reference picture indexes of top and bottom .fields of a P frame when a size of a reference buffer is 5, and FIG. 5 shows reference picture index lists 0 and 1 of top and bottom fields of a B frame that can be used as a reference. <br>
10	In order to improve coding efficiency, the moving picture coding system using multiple reference pictures provides a function of reordering the reference picture indexes before decoding a picture or a slice. The reference picture indexes are arbitrarily reordered so as to enhance<br>
15	the coding efficiency after determining an initial reference    picture index for the frame and field pictures. FIG. 6 shows a result of determining an initial reference picture index for a P frame and arbitrarily 'reordering" indexes according to the above-described method. <br>
20	     When . the moving picture  coding system using the     multiple reference pictures codes  an' interlaced moving, picture into a frame; picture having frame/field macroblocks, all the reference pictures for the frame macroblock are considered as a frame unit and one of the reference frame <br>
25  	. pictures must be used for motion compensation. In addition,     all the reference pictures for the field macroblock are considered as independent pictures, and one of the reference field pictures must be used for motion compensation.<br>
Accordingly, in. the frame picture coding that selects<br>
30   the frame/field coding modes at the macroblock level, it is<br>
necessary to allocate values- to. the reference picture index<br>
in frame unit or field unit according to the coding mode of<br>
each macroblock.<br>

Detail Description  of Example Embodiments<br>
15	Hereinafter,       example      embodiments      of      the      present<br>
invention    will    be    described"'. in    detail    with    reference    to. accompanying drawings.    .<br>
	As    stated   previously,    moving   picture   .coding;   systems,<br>
compensate   for   motion   using   motion   vector   information.      In<br>
20	the case of  a moving picture  coding system that; uses multiple<br>
	reference pictures, reference picture index information as<br>
well as', motion vector information is used for motion<br>
compensation. ' The reference, picture index is a value that is<br>
used, to distinguish multiple reference pictures from . each<br>
25	other.     A   coder' transfers   the   reference   picture   index   to   a<br>
decoder.. The decoder selects the reference picture as indicated by the reference picture-index, and performs motion compensation using  the selected reference  picture.<br>
When an interlaced moving picture is coded into a frame  <br>
30 .	picture having frame/field macroblocks, a moving picture coding system using multiple reference pictures performs a motion compensation from. a reference frame in order for frame coding in the frame macroblock. In other words, the reference pictures may be considered as a frame unit. The 35 moving picture' coding system, however, performs a motion compensation from a reference .field in order for a field coding    in    the., field   macroblocks.        In    other    words,     the<br>
8<br><br>
PCT/KR -2004/OO0 445 <br>
PEA/KR 2 7.0 4.2005.<br>
reference  pictures .may  be considered as a field unit.<br>
Accordingly, the frame pictures having frame/field macroblock use indexes having different structures at the macroblock level. For example,., the frame macroblock uses a  reference picture index of a frame unit and the field macroblock uses a reference picture index of a field unit. It should be considered that the reference picture indexes may be reordered at a picture or slice level.<br>
Therefore, the frame picture having frame/field  macroblocks should consider the reference picture in a frame unit at a picture or slice level and have the reordered reference picture indexes of a frame unit. The reference . picture index may be determined according to a coding mode of macroblock based on the reference picture indexes of the    frame unit'at the macroblock level.<br>
The present invention provides an embodiment of a method for determining reference picture indexes in a. frame picture having frame/field macroblocks. The method includes .a process of: determining reference; picture indexes at a  '.picture (or slice) level and a process of determining reference picture indexes at a macroblock level..<br>
[1]   Determination (or Initialization)  of Reference Picture Indexes at a Picture (or Slice) Level<br>
The reference pictures may be. considered in a frame- . unit at a picture or slice level and reference picture indexes of frame unit are calculated.<br>
In the method of determining a' reference picture index for a P 'frame, reference frames are sorted in an order reverse to a coding order and indexes are allocated while <br>
30-  visiting the' sorted reference frames in sequence.<br>
Reference picture indexes .for a B frame are determined based on a display order of the reference frames. First, in case of a reference frame list 0, . indexes are allocated in a reverse order to reference frames whose display orders lag  behind the B frame and the remaining indexes are allocated in. the display order to reference frames- whose display ordex lead the B frame.<br>
9<br><br>
PCT/KR 2004/O 00445 IPEA/KR 2 J.04.2095.<br>
In case of a reference frame list 1, in contrast to the reference frame list 0, indexes are- allocated in the display order to reference frames whose display orders are higher than the B frame and the remaining indexes are  allocated in a reverse order to 'reference frames whose display orders are lower than the B frame.<br>
In this and the other embodiment described below, in order. to improve coding efficiency, the moving picture coding system using multiple reference pictures may provide' a  function of reordering the reference picture indexes before decoding a picture or a slice The reference picture indexes are arbitrarily reordered so as to enhance the coding, efficiency after determining an initial reference picture index for the frame and field pictures^ When the reference    picture indexes are reordered so as to enhance a coding<br>
efficiency, the reference picture "indexes of a frame unit may  be reordered.<br>
[2]. Determination -(or reordering) of Reference Picture Index at Macroblock Level ]<br>
The reference picture index is modified according to the coding mode of the macroblock while performing a coding. in unit of a macroblock pair with respect to the reference picture indexes of a frame unit, which are obtained at the picture (or slice) level. This .process will be described    below. .<br>
[2.1] Case of Frame Macroblock<br>
       Since motion compensation may be performed to frame<br>
macroblocks from a reference frame, the reference picture<br>
index may  be a frame unit.   Accordingly,  the reference<br>
30'   picture indexes of a frame unit, which are obtained at the<br>
picture (or slice) level, are used.<br>
A reference frame stored In a . reference buffer may be<br>
configured with a field pair having parities (e.g., top and<br>
bottom) opposite to each other.. .  FIG. 7 shows reference<br>
35   picture indexes for a frame macroblock in a P frame and a B<br>
frame when a size of the reference buffer is 5.<br>
[2.2] Case of Field Macroblock.<br><br><br>
PCT/KR 2004/0 0 0 44 IPEA/KR 2 7.04.2005.<br>
Since	motion compensation- may be performed<br>
to field macroblocks from a reference field, the reference picture index may be a field unit.  In this case, a field pair having parities opposite to each other is also present    in the reference buffer.  Accordingly, each 'reference frame is . divided into two. fields while sequentially visiting the reference frame according to the reference picture indexes of a frame unit, which are obtained at the picture (or slice) level.  Then,  the  reference  picture indexes  are  newly    allocated to each field.  The reference picture indexes for two fields of each reference frame are allocated in various methods (Cases 1 to 4). (Case 1]<br>
Regardless of the top and bottom field macroblocks of a  current field macroblock, a lower index is allocated to the top reference field and a higher index is allocated to the bottom reference field when sequentially visiting the reference frames- in an order  of. the reference picture indexes/ which are obtained at. the picture (or slice) level.  In other words, the top and bottom reference field indexes may be given by. the equation below.<br>
Top .reference field index = 2 x picture index of reference frame<br>
Bottom reference field index = 2 x picture index of    reference frame + 1<br>
FIG. -8  shows  reference picture, indexes for' field macroblocks of a P frame and a B frame. (Case 2)<br>
Regardless of the top and bottom field macroblocks of a    current field macroblock, a lower index is allocated to the bottom reference field and a higher index is allocated to the top reference field while sequentially visiting the reference frames in an order of the reference picture indexes, which are obtained at the picture (or slice) level.      In other words, the top and bottom reference field  • indexes may be. given by an equation below.<br>
Top reference field index . - 2 x picture 'index of<br>

Bottom reference field index = 2 x picture index of reference frame<br>
FIG.  9  shows reference picture indexes  for field    macroblocks of a P frame and a B frame. {Case 3J<br>
Indexes that are increased by one are alternately .<br>
allocated " to reference fields, starting from the reference<br>
field having a parity equal to the current field to the<br>
10   reference field having a parity different from the current<br>
field,  while sequentially visiting the reference frames<br>
according to a reference picture index order of the picture<br>
(or slice) level.  FIGs. 10 and 11 show reference picture<br>
 indexes for the. field macroblocks' of a P frame and a B frame.<br>

Regardless of the top and bottom field macroblocks of a current field macroblock, a lower index is allocated to reference field close' to the current ' field in view of time and a higher index is allocated to reference field farther  from the current field, in view- of time, while sequentially visiting the reference frames in an  order of the reference picture indexes of the picture (or slice) level. .<br>
In other words, the . reference field indexes may be given by the equation below. <br>
Reference field index close to the current field = 2 x picture index of reference frame<br>
Reference field index far from the current field - 2 x picture index of reference frame + 1<br>
In FIG. 12, there are shown reference picture indexes    for a field macroblock of a P frame and a B' frame..<br>

Abstract<br>
The present invention relates to a method for coding a moving picture in a moving picture coding system using multiple reference picture. According to the method for  coding an interlaced moving picture into a frame picture having frame/field macroblock, a reference picture index of the frame macroblock is determined at a' macroblock level by determining the reference picture index of frame unit at a picture {or slice) level and respectively allocating a lower<br>
10 	index and a higher index to a top reference field and a bottom reference field while sequentially visiting the reference frames according to an order of reference picture index of frame unit, the top and bottom field indexes being giving by an equation: top reference field index = 2 x<br>
15 	picture index of reference frame; and bottom reference field index  2   x  picture index of reference frame + 1.<br>
