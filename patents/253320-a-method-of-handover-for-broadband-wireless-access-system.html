				<td>Technical Field<br>
[1]	The present invention relates to a method of maintaining data service continuity in<br>
broadband (wideband) wireless (radio) access systems, in particular, to a method of es-<br>
tablishing IP addresses of a mobile station for maintaining data service continuity<br>
during handover or in idle mode.<br>
Background Art<br>
[2]	In general, in a broadband wireless (radio) accesssystem, an idle mode for a<br>
mobile (or fixed) terminal (e.g., mobile station, mobile subscriber station (MSS), user<br>
terminal, user equipment (UE), etc.) is supported in order to minimize power<br>
consumption. In idle mode, a 'paging zone' is defined as the entire region that is<br>
handled by a plurality of bases station called a 'paging group' and all base station<br>
included within the same paging zone have the same paging cycle value<br>
(Paging_Cycle) and paging offset value (Paging_Offset).<br>
[3]	The terminal may request to the base station for changing into idle mode, and the<br>
base station delivers its paging zone identification (Paging-group ID) and the paging<br>
cycle and paging offset associated thereto to the terminal to allow that terminal to<br>
change into idle mode state. During the idle mode, the terminal can determine whether<br>
to maintain or end its idle mode based upon the paging that is delivered in broadcast<br>
format from the base station at each paging period.<br>
[4]	Additionally, when there is traffic (e.g., data, packets, etc.) mat needs to be<br>
delivered by the terminal in idle mode, the terminal may end its idle mode at any time.<br>
Also, when a terminal in idle mode does not receive paging within a set period of time<br>
due to reasons such as moving into another paging zone, losing synchronization, etc.,<br>
then the terminal ends its idle mode.<br>
[5]	Hereafter, the procedures of a terminal transitioning into idle mode and a related art<br>
method of establishing an IP address when downlink data exists will be explained.<br>
[6]	However in Figure 1, a method of delivering downlink traffic (data) received by<br>
the terminal to a registered base station (BS), namely, from a previous base station<br>
(Serving BS) to a new base station (Target BS), is not defined in the related art. Also,<br>
even if a method of delivering data between base stations is defined, when the terminal<br>
re-establishes an IP address, the delivered data would be useless from the point of view<br>
' of an application program in the terminal.<br>
[7]	For example, in Figure 1, .if a terminal in idle mode moves into a paging zone and<br><br>
. is within a zone of another base station BS#3, when downlink data arrives at the base<br>
station BS#1 that performed registration release for initially transitioning to the idle<br>
mode, the base station BS#3 informs the terminal to perform network entry through a<br>
paging message.<br>
[8]	Then the data needs to be delivered from the base station BS#1 of which the<br>
terminal initially transitioned into idle mode to the base station BS#3 that currently<br>
received paging, but the related art does not define a method of such delivery.<br>
[9]	Also, even if the above described problem is resolved, as shown in Figure 2, in the<br>
related art, because me terminal performs IP address establishment (or re-<br>
establishment) upon receiving paging when there is downlink traffic (data), the<br>
received data is useless from me point of view of the terminal.<br>
[10]	Accordingly, among the above-described operations in the related art, when there<br>
is traffic (data) that needs to be delivered to the terminal in idle mode, a method of<br>
receiving data without the terminal performing the IP establishment procedures is not<br>
defined.<br>
[11]	Meanwhile, when performing handover in a broadband wireless access system, the<br>
terminal releases the connection with the base station that-is in service (Serving BS),<br>
and performs handover to the.targeted base station (Target BS) to which handover is to<br>
be made. When the terminal performs handover, a mobile terminal handover indicator<br>
(MOB_HO_IND) is delivered to the Serving BS, and if the handover indicator type<br>
(HO_IND_type) value is '00', this means mat the Serving BS is released (Serving BS<br>
Release).<br>
[12]	In the related art, if the handover indicator type (HO_IND_type) value is '00',<br>
Serving BS releases all connections and the state machine of the medium control layer<br>
(MAC) related to the terminal and the MAC PDUs (Protocol Data Units) can be<br>
ignored. Also, it is defined that the Serving BS can deliver the MAC state machine and<br>
MAC PDUs to the target base station (Target BS) for service continuity, or may be<br>
ignored by a request through a backbone message of the target base station. However,<br>
the particular operations that need to be performed for the terminal to receive such<br>
have not yet been specified.<br>
[13]	Accordingly, the present invention defines the operations for receiving data<br>
delivered by the previous base station to the target base station after the terminal has<br>
moved.<br>
[ 14]	Figures 3 and 4 depict two examples of performing handover by a mobile terminal.<br>
As shown in Figures 3 and 4, in the handover procedures according to a request of the<br>
terminal or a request of the base station, after me terminal performs initialization<br>
procedures for handover, a handover indicator (e.g., a MOB_HO_Indication) is<br>
transmitted to the base station (Serving BS) that is currently receiving service, and the<br><br>
relationship (connection) with the base station BS#1 receiving the service is released.<br>
Thereafter, the remaining procedures for accessing the target base station BS#3,<br>
namely, raging procedures and initial network entry, are performed by the terminal.<br>
[15]	Figure 5 depicts a format of a handover indicator (MOB_HO_Indication). When<br>
releasing the relationship (connection) with the base station BS#1 receiving service,<br>
the HO-IND-type is set as '00'.<br>
Disclosure of Invention<br>
Technical Problem<br>
[ 16]	However, as in the idle mode of me related art, if the serving base station delivers<br>
data to the target base station when the terminal performs handover, if the terminal diat<br>
moved re-establishes the DP address during data reception, me received data become<br>
useless. Namely, as shown in Figure 2, regardless of whether there is data being<br>
delivered after handover, the terminal immediately performs IP address establishment,<br>
and even if the delivered data is sent to the terminal, such data is useless from the point<br>
of view of the application program in the terminal. Thus, in such case, the time when<br>
IP address establishment should be performed needs to be clearly defined, but the<br>
related art fails to do so.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
[17]	To address the related art problems, data continuity should be maintained when<br>
handover for a mobile terminal is performed (of when the terminal changes its<br>
operation mode), while IP address establishment also needs to be appropriately<br>
performed to ensure proper communications between the terminal and the network for<br>
a broadband (wideband) wireless (radio) access system.<br>
[18]	In a broadband (wideband) wireless (radio) access system, when a mobile or fixed<br>
terminal in idle mode has downlink data to be received or when handover is performed<br>
while receiving such data, the IP address establishment procedures are deferred<br>
(delayed) to allow such data to be properly delivered between the base stations.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of handover for broadband<br>
wireless access systems, the method comprising: determining diat handover for a mobile<br>
station is necessary while a session connection exists between end users; notifying from a<br>
first point of attachment to a second point of attachment that the session is to be<br>
maintained by the second point of attachment after handover; performing handover<br>
procedures by a mobile station to associate with the second point of attachment;<br>
informing from the second point of attachment to the mobile station mat a mobile stadon<br>
downlink data pending element exists; and delaying Internet Protocol addressing after<br>
receiving the downlink data is pending element, if the Internet Protocol addressing needs<br>
to be changed.<br><br>
The present invention also provides a method of handover for broadband wireless<br>
access systems, the method comprising: detennining that handover is necessary while a<br>
session connection exists between end users; informing by a mobile station to a new point<br>
of attachment, to perform old point of attachment release with data forwarding indication;<br>
notifying from an old point of attachment to the new point of attachment that me session<br>
is to be maintained by the new point of attachment after handover; performing handover<br>
procedures by the mobile station to associate with the new point of attachment;<br>
informing from the new point of attachment to the mobile station, that a mobile station<br>
downlink data pending element exists; and delaying Internet Protocol addressing after<br>
receiving the downlink data pending element, if Internet Protocol addressing needs to be<br>
changed.<br>
The present invention further provides a method of maintaining data reception<br>
during mobility in broadband wireless access systems, the method comprising:<br>
performing handover with a first base station and a second base station, while receiving<br>
downlink data from the first base station; receiving an indication mat the second base<br>
station will forward additional downlink data related to the downlink data previously<br>
received from the first base station; delaying Internet Protocol address establishment until<br>
the additional downlink data is received; and receiving the additional downlink data from<br>
the second base station.<br>
The present invention still further provides a method of maintaining data<br>
transmissions during mobility in broadband wireless access systems, the method<br>
comprising: performing handover for a mobile station with a first base station and a<br>
second base station, while sending downlink data from the first base station to the mobile<br>
station; sending an indication to the mobile station that the second base station will<br>
forward additional downlink data related to the downlink data previously sent from the<br>
first base station; and sending the additional downlink data from the second base station<br>
to the mobile station which delayed Internet Protocol address establishment until the<br>
additional downlink data is completely received.<br><br>

Mode for Invention<br>
[35]	The preferred exemplary embodiments of the present invention will now be<br>
explained. However, those skilled in the art would understand that the features of the<br>
present invention should not be limited to only the embodiments described herein.<br>
[36]	The present invention is related to the research and development being conducted<br>
by various IEEE working groups, such as IEEE 802.16, and thus the concepts and<br>
teachings involved therein are applicable to the features of the present invention. Ad-<br>
ditionally, as various efforts are being made to implement the interworking of different<br>
types of networks and communication technologies, such as achieving compatibility<br>
between IEEE networks and cellular networks (such as, a third generation (3G)<br>
networks), it can be clearly understood that the present invention may also have ap-<br><br>
plicability in achieving such compatibility.<br>
[37]	Considering the communication protocols related to wireless (radio) access<br>
systems, at the network layer, to allow proper data packet communication via the<br>
Internet, an Internet Protocol (IP) provides the necessary addressing and routing in-<br>
formation for the packets. Here, each device (e.g., user terminal, mobile handset,<br>
wireless connectivity device, etc.) connected via the Internet requires the establishment<br>
of a unique IP address in order for that device to be properly identified and dis-<br>
tinguished from other devices.<br>
[38]	The Internet Protocols referred to as IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6)<br>
have been developed. By employing 32-bit addresses, IPv4 has been found to have<br>
limitations because of the increasing popularity of Internet communications, whereby<br>
each device connected with the Internet needs its own unique IP address. As such,<br>
because the availability of 32-bit addresses would soon be exhausted, an enhancement<br>
was developed, namely, IPv6, which employs 128-bit addresses.<br>
[39]	However, the fact that a user terminal may have mobility (e.g., mobile terminals)<br>
makes IP address establishment more difficult. For example, to support mobility, a<br>
user terminal may undergo handover, whereby the terminal being served by one base<br>
station that covers a certain region, moves to a new location and needs to be served by<br>
a different base station that covers that new location. In other words, the mobile station<br>
that is part of a first subnet (i.e., a portion of the network)"moves into a second subnet<br>
(i.e., another portion of the network). Another example would be when a user terminal<br>
changes its state of operation into a receiving mode from an idle mode, which is an<br>
example of a power-saving operation mode that is important because a user terminal<br>
having mobility should conserve its limited battery power.<br>
[40]	In such handover or idle mode change situations described above, IP address es-<br>
tablishment must be performed at the appropriate time such that seamless data<br>
reception can be received by the user terminal.<br>
[41]	To address the related art problems, in a broadband (wideband) wireless (radio)<br>
access system in which a mobile terminal in idle mode moves into a region of a second<br>
base station that is within a paging zone of a first base station, a method of establishing<br>
an IP address of the mobile terminal according to the present invention comprises:<br>
when downlink data arrives at the first base station, the first base station delivers the<br>
downlink data to the second base station through a first message; the second base<br>
station informs the mobile terminal through a second message that there is data to be<br>
delivered; and delaying IP address establishment in order to allow data reception at the<br>
mobile terminal according to the second message.<br>
[42]	Preferably, the first message is a data delivery message. Preferably, the IP address<br>
establishment method of the terminal further comprises a step of transmitting a data<br><br>
transmission stop message by the first base station to the second base station after IP<br>
address establishment is complete. Preferably, the second message is a registration<br>
response message or a ranging response message. In this case, the registration response<br>
message includes a parameter that delays IP address establishment of the terminal by<br>
informing that data to be delivered exists.<br>
[43]	To achieve the above-identified purpose, in a broadband wireless access system in<br>
which a mobile terminal receiving downlink data moves into a region of a second base<br>
station that is within a paging zone of a first base station, a method of establishing an<br>
IP address of the mobile terminal according to the present invention comprises: asking<br>
whether me first base station can deliver downlink data to the second base station, by<br>
delivering a handover indicator from the mobile terminal to the first base station; the<br>
first base station informs the mobile terminal as to whether data delivery is possible via<br>
a data delivery indicator, and delivers the downlink data to the second base station; and<br>
performing IP address re-establishment procedures after receiving the downlink data<br>
from the second base station upon receiving the data delivery indicator.<br>
[44]	Preferably, if the first base station cannot explicitly inform about data delivery<br>
capability or if a data delivery indicator is not received within a certain amount of time,<br>
the mobile terminal performs initial network entry, waits for a certain amount of time<br>
for receiving downlink data arrival, and then performs IP address re-establishment<br>
procedures.<br>
[45]	To achieve the above-identified purpose, in a broadband wireless access system in<br>
which a mobile terminal receiving downlink data moves into a region of a second base<br>
station that is within a paging zone of a first base station, a method of establishing an<br>
IP address of the mobile terminal according to the present invention comprises:<br>
delivering by the mobile terminal a delivery indicator to the first base station;<br>
delivering by the first base station downlink data to the second base station via the data<br>
delivery indicator; informing by the mobile terminal that there is data to be delivered<br>
by the second base station to the mobile terminal via a first message; and receiving the<br>
downlink data from the second base station after delaying IP address re-establishment<br>
for a certain amount of time according to the first message.<br>
[46]	Preferably, the first message is a registration response message or a ranging<br>
response message.<br>
[47]	In a broadband (wideband) wireless (radio) access system, as a first embodiment,<br>
the present invention proposes a method of delivering data between base stations when<br>
there is downlink data to be received by a fixed/mobile terminal in idle mode, and a<br>
method of deferring (or delaying) IP address establishment procedures when the<br>
mobile terminal changes to receiving mode for data reception.<br>
[48]	Namely, the present invention defines the procedures for delivering data to a<br><br>
current base station after the data arrives at the base station that performs the initial idle<br>
mode transition procedures, when a mobile terminal transitions to idle mode and<br>
moves from a region of a base station that performed the transition procedures into a<br>
region of another base station. Also, if the IP address changes when me terminal<br>
receives the message delivered by me above procedure, such data would be useless and<br>
thus the present invention defines the procedures such that the IP address establishment<br>
procedures are not performed in the above situation.<br>
[49]	In another embodiment, the present invention provides a method of delivering data<br>
between base stations when handover is performed during data reception and a method<br>
of deferring the IP address establishment procedure while data is received after the<br>
mobile terminal moves to a new location.<br>
[50]	Namely, in a broadband wireless access system, the present invention provides a<br>
method in which, during handover of a mobile terminal, the base station currently in<br>
service (Serving BS) delivers the data being received by the mobile terminal to a target<br>
base station (Target BS) to which handover is to be made through a backbone network<br>
in order to guarantee service continuity after handover.<br>
[51]	Also, the present invention provides a method that can delay (defer or postpone)<br>
the IP address establishment procedure while the mobile terminal receives data that<br>
was delivered to the new base station from a previous base station after performing<br>
handover.<br>
[52]	Additionally, the present invention provides a method that allows a mobile terminal<br>
to perform handover by explicitly knowing whether the data currently being explicitly<br>
received may be received after moving, and defines the message delivered from the<br>
serving base station to a target base station.<br>
[53]	Also, the present invention, when the mobile terminal completes handover, defines<br>
a message indicating that data delivery should be stopped because handover has been<br>
completed, which the target base station sends to the serving base station.<br>
[54]	First, a method of delivering data between the base stations and delaying (deferring<br>
or postponing) the IP address allocation of the terminal according to the first<br>
embodiment of the present invention will be explained as follows.<br>
[55]	When handover is performed, the serving BS may discard MAC SDUs (service<br>
data units) associated with the MSS or forward the MAC SDUs for service con-<br>
tinuation. However, the MSS should decide whether or not the MAC SDUs will be<br>
forwarded to the target BS depending on the traffic type. Thus, the present invention<br>
proposes a new method for MSS to request the serving MS release with data<br>
forwarding. To achieve this, the present invention proposes that the MOB-HOTND<br>
message format be modified by adding one HO_IND_type for the MSS to decide on<br>
service continuation by forwarding MAC SDUs associated with the MSS, as shown in<br><br>
Figure 5.<br>
[56]	In case of data forwarding, if the MSS re-establishes IP connectivity after<br>
handover, the forwarded data become useless due to the IP address change. Therefore,<br>
the MSS should defer IP re-establishment if there exists forwarded data from the<br>
serving BS.<br>
[57]	If the BS decides whether or not to forward the data and the MSS does not know of<br>
this decision, the MSS requests Serving BS release by sending a MOB_HO_IND MAC<br>
Management message with the HO_IND_type value indicating serving BS release and<br>
the BS decides whether or not to forward the data for the MSS to the target BS.<br>
[58]	Because the MSS does not know whether the serving BS decides to forward the<br>
MSS's data to the target BS, the MSS waits for any forwarded data for some pre-<br>
defined time after handover. If data is received from the new BS within the pre-defined<br>
time and the destination is an old IP address, the MSS may choose to defer the IP<br>
address re-establishment until the session ends. If the MSS chooses to finish the<br>
session, it establishes IP connectivity to acquire a new IP address.<br>
[59]	The new BS may send a Stop_Data_Forwarding backbone message to the old BS<br>
when the MSS re-established IP connectivity. When the serving BS receives the<br>
Stop_Data_Forwarding backbone message, the BS may close all connections and<br>
discard state macnines and MAC SDUs associated with the MSS.<br>
[60]	If the MSS can request the serving BS release with data forwarding explicitly, the<br>
MSS does not need to wait for a pre-defined time to check whether there is any<br>
forwarded data to be received after handover. In this case, the BS indicates the MSS<br>
 with its capability of data forwarding. If the MSS receives, an indication that data<br>
forwarding is supported, the MSS defers re-establishment of IP connectivity, and if the<br>
MSS receives an indication that data forwarding is not supported, the MSS re-<br>
establishes the IP connectivity without waiting for a pre-defined time after handover.<br>
[61]	The new BS may send a Stop_Data_Forwarding backbone message to the old BS<br>
when the MSS re-established IP connectivity. When the serving BS receives the<br>
Stop_Data_Forwarding message, the BS may close all connections and discard state<br>
machines and MAC SDUs associated with the MSS.<br>
[62]	If the MSS, which can request data forwarding explicitly, requests the serving BS<br>
release by sending a MOB_HO_IND MAC Management message with the<br>
HO_IND_type value indicating serving BS release, the MSS does not care whether the<br>
data is forwarded to the target BS or not. This MSS initiates IP re-establishment as<br>
soon as handover is finished and registers with the new BS.<br>
[63]	After the handover request/response handshake has completed, the MSS may begin<br>
the actual handover (HO). At some stage during the HO process, the MSS terminates<br>
service with the serving BS with or without the option of data forwarding. This is ac-<br><br>
complished by sending a MOB-HO-IND MAC Management message with the<br>
HO_IND_type value indicating serving BS release for without data forwarding or with<br>
the HO_IND_type value indicating serving BS release with data forwarding for<br>
forwarding data to the target BS.<br>
[64]	If the HO_IND_type field specifies Serving BS release, the BS may close all<br>
connections and discard MAC state machines and the MAC PDUs associated with the<br>
MSS, and if the HO_IND_type field specifies Serving BS release with data<br>
forwarding, it may retain the connections, the MAC state machine, and the MAC<br>
PDUs associated with the MSS to be forwarded to the Target BS for service con-<br>
tinuation until the Target BS requests for the Serving BS to stop forwarding over a<br>
backbone. The Target BS may buffer the forwarded data and deliver to the MSS when<br>
the MSS's handover is successfully finished, and at that time, send s backbone message<br>
to tell the Serving BS to stop forwarding.<br>
[65]	The MSS may request the forwarding of currently receiving data by sending a<br>
MOB_HO_IND MAC Management message with the HO_IND_type value indicating<br>
serving BS release with data forwarding. This request is made if the MSS wants to<br>
receive the currently receiving data through the serving BS for service continuation<br>
and IP re-establishment is deferred after handover until the currently receiving data<br>
procedure finishes. Upon reception of the HO_IND_type of serving BS release with<br>
data forwarding, the serving BS shall send MOB_FWD__IND to the MSS on the basic<br>
CID indicating whether the BS can forward the data or not. If the action code in<br>
MOB_FWD_IND indicates 'data forwarding hot supported', the MSS re-establishes the<br>
IP address as soon as handover is complete, and if the action code indicates 'data<br>
forwarding supported', then the MSS defers IP re-establishment and receives the<br>
forwarded data. When the MSS re-establishes IP connectivity during the receiving of<br>
forwarded data, the BS may send a backbone message to request the old BS to stop<br>
forwarding data.<br>
[66]	In the first embodiment of the present invention, the following messages are<br>
defined:<br>
[67]	 *Data delivery message: A message used by the serving base station when<br>
delivering the received data when the mobile terminal does not move to the target base<br>
station.<br>
[68]	* Data delivery stop message: A message sent by the target base station to the<br>
previous base station for requesting the stopping of data transmission by the mobile<br>
terminal.<br>
[69]	* Registration response message: A message that additionally includes a parameter<br>
to defer (delay or postpones) IP address establishment by informing mat there is a<br>
message (data) to be delivered to the mobile terminal, when the mobile terminal<br><br>
performs registration procedures.<br>
[70]	* Ranging response message: A message that additionally includes a parameter to<br>
defer IP address establishment by informing that there is a message to be delivered to<br>
the mobile terminal, when the mobile terminal performs ranging procedures.<br>
[71 ]	Figures 6 through 9 respectively depict examples of the above-described four types<br>
of messages, and the parameters used for each message are only examples and thus<br>
may be changed accordingly.<br>
[72]	Here, the data delivery message shown in Figure 6 may also be referred to as a<br>
'MSS-Data-Forwarding Message,' which is a message sent from the Serving BS to the<br>
Target BS to forward the MMS's MAC SDUs during HO. This message is typically<br>
used when the MSS requests the Serving BS to release the Serving ZBS with data<br>
forwarding. Preferably, the transmission of this message shall be stopped upon<br>
reception of a Stop-Data-Forwarding message, explained below.<br>
[73]	The data delivery stop message shown in Figure 7 may also be referred to as a<br>
'Stop-Data-Forwarding Message,' which is a message senffrom the Target BS to the<br>
Serving BS in order to make the Serving BS stop forwarding the MSS's MAC SDUs.<br>
[74]	Hereafter, with reference to Figure 10, a method of data delivery between base<br>
stations and delaying (deferring or postponing) IP address allocation (establishment) of<br>
the terminal according to the first embodiment will be explained.<br>
[75]	Procedures for Delivering Data between Base Stations<br>
[76]	If the mobile terminal transitions to idle mode, and the mobile terminal moves from<br>
a base station region at which the mobile terminal performed the idle mode transition<br>
procedures into a different base station region, when data arrives at the base station<br>
(Serving BS: BS#1) that performed the initial idle mode transition procedures, this<br>
base station (BS#1) informs the other base stations (BS#2 and BS#3) that downlink<br>
data arrived at a mobile terminal (MSS) having a particular MAC (medium access<br>
control) address.<br>
[77]	Then, all base stations (BS#2 and BS#3) within the same paging zone establishes<br>
an action code to an enter network by using a MAC address for paging the mobile<br>
terminals. The mobile terminals (MSS) receiving the paging perform network entry<br>
procedures, and the base station (Target BS: BS#3) with which this network entry<br>
procedure is performed, informs that a mobile terminal paging to its paging zone exists<br>
to the base station (Serving BS) that receives the above data.<br>
[78]	Accordingly, the base station (BS#1) delivers the data to the base station (BS#3)<br>
that had a mobile terminal perform network entry. Here, the data is delivered by<br>
including it in a data delivery message, which is a backbone message.<br>
[79]	Deferring IP Address Establishment when performing Network Entry<br>
[80]	When the mobile terminal performs network entry because it has data to be<br><br>
received, the mobile terminal must defer (delay or postpone) IP address establishment<br>
by the following two situations.<br>
[81]	First, upon network entry according to an operation code (e.g., enter network) of<br>
paging, after being in idle mode, the IP address establishment is deferred (delayed or<br>
postponed).<br>
[82]	Second, when the base station explicitly performs registration procedures or raging<br>
procedures, the fact that there is data to be delivered is informed to the mobile terminal<br>
through a registration response message or a ranging response message, and the mobile<br>
terminal defers (delays or postpones) IP address establishment.<br>
[83]	Also, the mobile terminal can establish the IP address during data reception, and<br>
when the IP address is established, the base station that is receiving data transmits a<br>
data transmission stop message, which is a backbone message, to the base station that<br>
is delivering the data.<br>
[84]	Thereafter, a method of delivering data between base stations and deferring<br>
(delaying or postponing) allocation (establishment) of the IP address of the mobile<br>
terminal according to the second embodiment of the present invention will now be<br>
explained as follows. The following messages are defined by the first embodiment of<br>
the present invention.<br>
[85]	* Handover indicator: This indicator requests explicit informing of whether or not<br>
delivery is possible for the data being currently received.<br>
[86]	* Data delivery indicator: This indicator allows the base station to inform the<br>
mobile terminal as to whether data delivery is possible.<br>
[87]	* Data delivery message: This message is used when the serving base station<br>
delivers to the target base station, the data that would have been received by me mobile<br>
terminal when it would not have moved.<br>
[88]	* Data transmission stop message: This message is used when the target base<br>
station request to the previous base station that the transmission of data of the mobile<br>
terminal should be stopped.<br>
[89]	* Registration response message: This message further includes a parameter that<br>
defers IP address establishment by informing that a message to be delivered to the<br>
mobile terminal exists, when the mobile terminal performs registration procedures.<br>
[90]	* Ranging response message: This message further includes a parameter that defers<br>
IP address establishment by informing that a message to be delivered to the mobile<br>
terminal exists, when the mobile terminal performs ranging procedures.<br>
[91 ]	The formats of the handover indicator and the data delivery indicator are each<br>
depicted in Figures 5 and 11 A, respectively. The formats of each of the above-<br>
identified four types of messages are depicted in Figures 6 through 9, respectively.<br>
Here, the parameters used for each message are only examples and thus may be<br><br>
changed accordingly.<br>
[92]	In Figure 11, a MOB_FWD JND_Message_Forrnat is shown as an example of a<br>
data delivery indicator. The BS sends this message to indicate its data forwarding<br>
capability when an MSS sends a MOB_HO_IND MAC Management message with the<br>
HO_.IND_type value indicating serving BS release with data forwarding. Action code<br>
00 is sent in order to indicate to MSS that the BS can forward data to the target BS, and<br>
01 is sent when the BS cannot support data forwarding.<br>
[93]	Figure 12 depicts an example of Registration Response (RNGJR.SP) message<br>
encodings according to the present invention.<br>
[94]	Referring to Figure 12, during handover (HO), the Target BS may notify the MSS,<br>
through Bit#7, about a MSS downlink (DL) data pending element of the HO Process<br>
Optimization TLV item in the RNG-RSP, of post-HO re-entry MSS DL data pending.<br>
Upon MSS successful re-entry at the Target BS (which has now become the new<br>
Serving BS), and after the new Serving BS completes the reception of any HO pending<br>
MSS DL data retained and forwarded, the MSS may re-establish IP connectivity and<br>
the new Serving BS may send a backbone message to request the old Serving BS or<br>
other network entity to stop forwarding any pre-HO pending MSS DL data.<br>
[95]	Hereafter, a method of delivering data between base stations and deferring<br>
(delaying or postponing) IP address allocation (establishment) of the mobile terminal<br>
according to the second embodiment will be explained with reference to Figures 12<br>
through 15. Here, it should be noted that in Figures 12 through 15, the step of releasing<br>
the terminal (MSS) is depicted prior to the initial MMS data forwarding step.<br>
However, the box showing the 'MMS release' step is depicted as dotted lines to<br>
indicate that the particular location of this step in the overall procedures may be<br>
changed as desired or if necessary. For example, the MSS release step may be<br>
performed near the end of the overall procedures instead of in the initial steps if doing<br>
so would be more advantageous.<br>
[96]	. Also, in Figures 12 through 14, it should be noted that the data forwarding steps<br>
can continue to be performed until the Serving BS receives a message indicating that<br>
data forwarding should be stopped (Stop-Data-Forwarding) from the Target BS.<br>
[97]	Furthermore, as the features of the present invention have been described for<br>
delivering (forwarding) data between base stations, it can be understood that such data<br>
forwarding (delivery) may be performed directly between base stations or via an in-<br>
termediary network element, such as an access gateway. In other words, as shown in<br>
Figure 2, a portion of the network (e.g., a backbone) may include at least two base<br>
stations directly connected together or at least two base stations connected to each<br>
other via a gateway (or other network element).<br>
[98]	When Base Station cannot Explicitly inform the Terminal about Data Delivery<br><br>
Capability<br>
[99]	Figure 13 depicts an IP address establishment when the base station cannot<br>
explicitly inform me mobile terminal as to whether or not data delivery is possible!<br>
[100]	Referring to Figure 13, if there is data currently being received, the mobile terminal<br>
sets the HO_IND_type of the MOB-HO-IND to '00' (= Serving BS release) and<br>
transmits, or sets '11' (= Serving BS release with data forwarding) and can transmit to<br>
the base station (BS#1). If the HO_IND_type is '00', the mobile terminal performs<br>
handover without expecting to receive an explicit data delivery indicator from the base<br>
station,<br>
[101]	In this case, the terminal cannot know whether the previous base station (BS#1)<br>
can deliver data to the new base station (BS#2). Accordingly, after handover, the<br>
mobile terminal re-establishes an IP address after waiting for a certain amount of time<br>
to see if there is any data to be delivered from the previous base station (BS#1). If there<br>
is data delivered during the certain amount of time, the mobile terminal can put off<br>
(delay, defer or postpone) IP address establishment while receiving such data, may<br>
stop data reception at any time, decide to receive data through a new path, and when IP<br>
re-establishment takes place, the new base station (BS#2) detects this and delivers a<br>
data transmission stop message to the previous base station (BS#1).<br>
[102]	Upon receiving the above-identified data transmission stop message, the previous<br>
base station stops the message that is being transmitted, releases (cancels) the state<br>
machine of the MAC with respect to the mobile terminal that moved and thereafter<br>
ignores the MAC SDUs delivered from an upper layer.<br>
[103]	Figure 14 depicts an IP address establishment when a base station does not provide<br>
an explicit data delivery message.<br>
[ 104]	Referring to Figure 14, if the mobile terminal transmits the HO_IND_type as ' 11',<br>
this means that the mobile terminal expects that the base station will explicitly inform<br>
whether data delivery should be made or not, and if a data delivery indicator is<br>
received from the base station, then the mobile station operates in the same manner as<br>
when the base station can explicitly inform whether or not data delivery is possible, as<br>
shown in Figure 15.<br>
[105]	However, if the base station does not support the data delivery indicator, the<br>
mobile station waits for a certain amount of time, and if the data delivery indicator is<br>
not received from the base station, the subsequent operations are performed in the<br>
same manner as when the HO_IND_type is '00'.<br>
[106]	When Base Station can Explicitly inform the Terminal about Data Delivery<br>
Capability<br>
[107]	Figure 15 depicts an IP address establishment when the base station can explicitly<br>
inform the mobile terminal about whether or not data delivery is possible.<br><br>
[108]	As shown in Figure 15, when the mobile terminal has data currently being<br>
received, the HO_IND_type of the MOB-HO-IND can be transmitted upon being set to<br>
'11' (= Serving BS release with Data Forwarding) in order to receive from the base<br>
station, an explicit indicator that indicates whether or not data delivery is possible. If<br>
the base station (BS#1) supports the HO_IND_type of the handover indicator<br>
(MOB-HO-IND), then the base station (BS#1) transmits a data delivery indicator<br>
(MOB-FWD-IND) to the mobile station. Accordingly, the mobile station receiving the<br>
data delivery indicator (MOB-FWD-IND) performs the IP address re-establishment<br>
procedures after receiving the data being currently received..<br>
[109]	When Informing new Base Station about whether or not Data to be Delivered<br>
Exists<br>
[110]	Figure 16 depicts an example of the procedures for the service base station<br>
transmitting an indicator and delivering data according to the request of an explicit<br>
indicator of the mobile station.	<br>
[111]	Referring to Figure 16, when the mobile station that was receiving data moves, and<br>
when the new base station (BS#2) receives from the previous base station (BS#1)<br>
delivery data for the terminal to be handed over, the new base station (BS#2) informs<br>
this fact to the mobile terminal when performing the ranging procedures after the<br>
mobile terminal is handed over or when performing the registration procedures such<br>
that the mobile terminal defers IP address establishment.<br>
[112]	As described above, when the mobile terminal moves from a first base station zone<br>
in which initial idle mode transition was made into a second base station zone and<br>
attempts to receive data, the present invention defines the procedures for delivering the<br>
received data from the first base station to the second base station, and defines a<br>
method for the mobile terminal to defer the IP address establishment procedures in<br>
order to receive the above-identified data, in order to achieve the effect of efficiently<br>
performing data delivery.<br>
[113]	Also, the present invention has the effect of providing the mobile terminal with a<br>
method of delivering data between base stations after handover, and by delaying IP<br>
address re-establishment when the mobile terminal receives the data that was delivered<br>
from the previous base station to the new base station, such that service continuity can<br>
be guaranteed.<br>
[114]	As the present invention has been described above with respect to wireless access<br>
technologies, it can be clearly understood that various wireless access technologies<br>
currently under development (such as WiMax, WiBro, Wi-Fi, etc.) can also benefit<br>
from the features and teachings of the present invention, which are applicable because<br>
of the similarities involved in wireless communications involving user terminal<br>
mobility, handovers and idle mode operations.<br><br>
[115]	The foregoing description of the preferred embodiments is provided to enable any<br>
person skilled in the art to make or use the present invention. Various modifications to<br>
these embodiments will be readily apparent to those skilled in the art, and the generic<br>
principles defined herein may be applied to other embodiments. Thus, the present<br>
