Ink Jet Recording Medium<br>
This invention relates to ink jet recording media, in particular to ink jet coating layers that comprise certain copolymers or cooligomers that comprise monomer units derived from at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of the acrylate and acrylamide monomers, at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of the amine containing ethylenically unsaturated monomers and at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of the polyacrylates of polyols. The copolymers or cooligomers are neutralized with acid, for example prior to or during the coating formulation.<br>
Ink jet printing technology is used for example for presentation (transparency), graphic arts, banners and signage, engineering drawing and home office applications. The performance requirements for ink jet recording media used for these applications include efficient ink absorption, fast drying, good colorfastness, high image resolution, archivability and curl performance.<br>
The individual layers that receive ink jet ink images are referred to as ink jet media or ink jet receivers. Ink jet media may simply consist or cellulosic fiber paper or of cellulosic fibers and a filler in order that inks may be absorbed in the space between fibers.<br>
Ink jet recording papers may also be of the coated type, which consists for example of a paper (or support), an ink-receptive layer or ink-absorbing layer or layers, and optionally a protective coating layer. The ink-receptive layer is the ink-receiving or image drying layer. Thin protective coating layers are typically employed to provide physical protection for the underlying layer or to protect the image. Protective layers may reduce tackiness, provide a glossy appearance, and like other layers, offer an ink-receptive surface that may serve as a carrier for specific components of the ink.<br>
A barrier layer between a paper support and the ink receptive layer or layers is also typically employed.<br>
Attempts have been made to employ certain polymers or blends of polymers as components of ink jet recording media. In general, blends are used to find the proper balance of ink absorption, dry time and image permanence.<br><br>

It has been found that certain copolymers or cooligomers, which copolymers or cooligomers comprise monomer units derived from at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of the acrylate and acrylamide monomers, at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of the amine containing ethylenically unsaturated monomers and at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of the polyacrylates of polyols, provide for superior ink jet media when incorporated therein. The amine sites of the copolymers or cooligomers are at least partially neutralized with acid prior to film casting the<br><br>
coating formulation.  The ink jet media, which receives ink jet ink, is provided excellent dye wash fastness, fast dry times, high gloss and excellent lightfastness.<br>
The present invention relates to an ink jet recording media system that comprises a support and one or more coating layers thereon, wherein at least one coating layer comprises a copolymer or cooligomer that comprises monomer units derived from at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of the acrylate and acrylamide monomers, at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of the amine containing ethylenically unsaturated monomers and at least one monomer selected from the group consisting of the polyacrylates of polyols. The copolymer or cooligomer is at least partially neutralized with acid.<br>
For the purposes of this invention, the terms "ink jet media", "ink jet recording media" or "ink jet media system" or "ink jet recording media system" refers to the entire composition which receives the ink jet ink, or likewise also refers to any individual layers or combinations of individual layers of the entire composition. These terms also refer to these compositions after printing with Inkjet ink, that is, further comprising Inkjet ink.<br>
The term "ink receptive layer" means the ink-receiving or image-forming layer. The ink receptive layer can be considered as a sponge layer intended for the absorption of the ink.<br>
The term "protective coating layer" means a top coating layer of the ink jet media system, or overcoat layer, that may be employed to provide specific properties as outlined above. Protective coating layers are typically thin in comparison to the ink-receptive layer. The protective coating layer is the outermost layer, and must allow for ink penetration or may be applied in a subsequent lamination step.<br>
The term "support" refers to the base substrate of the ink jet media, for example paper itself. The present supports are naturally occurring materials or are synthetic.<br>
The term "monomer units derived from" means the starting monomer is reacted into, and thus is part of, the finished copolymer or cooligomer. Each individual reacted monomer molecule is a "monomer unit" when part of a copolymer or cooligomer.<br><br>
The present copolymers or cooligomers are prepared by free radical polymerization techniques, which techniques are well known to those skilled in the art. For instance, the present copolymers or cooligomers are emulsion copolymers or cooligomers, prepared by the methods described in U.S. 2002/0127376, the disclosure of which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
The present copolymers or cooligomers are at least partially neutralized with acid. This pH adjustment, or "combination with acid" or "neutralization with acid" or "addition of acid" may be performed at any stage. For example, the neutralization with acid is performed at any stage during the preparation of the copolymer or cooligomer, the formulation of the coating resin, or the preparation of the ink jet media. The acid partially or completely neutralizes the amine sites of the copolymers or cooligomers.<br>
Advantageously the acid, for example acetic acid, may be ultimately removed from the ink jet media upon drying. Drying takes place for instance upon heating or at ambient temperature.<br>
For example, the present copolymers or cooligomers are formulated into media coating formulations (coatings). The coating formulations are adjusted with acid to a pH of from about 3 to about 7. For instance, the pH of the present coating formulations is from about 3 to about 6, from about 4 to about 7, or from about 4 to about 6. The coating formulations comprise for example the emulsion copolymer or cooligomer, water and other ingredients. That is, the coating formulations are for example aqueous coating formulations (aqueous coatings). That is to say, the coating layers comprising the present neutralized copolymers or cooligomers exhibit said pH limits prior to drying or curing.<br>
Acids that are convenient to employ for neutralization of the copolymers or cooligomers are for example mineral acids, such as sulfuric or hydrochloric acids, or organic acids, such as carboxylic acids or sulfonic acids. For example, the acid employed for neutralization is acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, lactic acid, and the like.<br><br>
Volatile acids like acetic acid may be removed (may evaporate) from the ink jet media upon drying. This "removal" of the neutralization acid is observable for instance by surface reflective IR spectroscopy.<br>
For example, when volatile acids are employed, greater than about 80 mol% of the neutralization acid is ultimately removed from the ink jet media. For instance, greater than about 90%, about 95% or greater than about 98 mol% of the volatile acid is ultimately removed. The acid is removed upon drying or curing of the ink jet media with heat or at ambient temperature.<br>

The Encad and Epson printers are piezo printers. The Hewlett Packard printer is a thermal printer. Unless otherwise noted, ratios and levels are in weight percent. The following media resin compositions are prepared:<br><br><br>
The control resin is a 50/50 (w/w) copolymer of MMA/DMAEMA.<br>
The polymers are prepared according to conventional free radical polymerization techniques, for example according to the disclosure of U.S. 2002/0127376.<br>
MMA =	Methyl methacrylate<br>
DMAEMA =        Dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate<br>
RS10AE =	Steareth 10 mole ethoxylate allyl ether<br>

Example 1<br>
Wash Fastness<br>
Resin media coating formulations are prepared as below. The control and the polymers of sample G, E and J are supplied at 30% solids in water.<br>
Control, G, E (30% solids) 50 g	J (30% solids)    33.3 g<br>
Distilled Water	45 g	Distilled Water    40 g<br>
Ethanol	5g	Ethanol	10 g<br>
The formulations are adjusted to pH 5 with acetic acid.<br>
The solutions/suspensions of media resins are applied to a polyester (PET) sheet using the appropriate draw down bar to generate a 15 gsm (grams per square meter) coating after drying in an oven at 200°F.<br>
Green, blue, and red blocks are printed onto the coated sheets using a HP 990 Cxi printer. The prints are mounted on a stainless steel frame and submerged, printed side up, in distilled water at room temperature for 10 minutes. The prints are then removed, held vertically to drain excess water, then placed horizontally to dry. Optical density and L, a, b color of the dry prints are recorded. Little change in optical density and L, a, b color is desireable. Results are below.<br><br><br>
A second set of prints prepared as above are likewise submerged in distilled water at room temperature for 10 minutes. The prints are then removed, held vertically to drain excess water, and subjected to rubbing at constant pressure using a crock meter fitted with a cotton pad. The number of double rubs needed to remove all color is recorded. Results are below.<br><br>
Image Quality. Dry Time<br>
A third set of prints prepared as above are tested with a piezo printer. This shows the high performance of the present copolymers when used with a piezo printer where inks have a high glycol content.<br>
A step wedge plot (a series of color blocks with increasing print densities, 10%, 20% etc.) of blue, green, red, and black is printed using an Epson 890 printer and the coating's performance is judged in terms of dry time (smudge resistance versus time and image transfer after dry time) and print quality (ink coalescence for secondary colors). Dry time is good and little to no coalescence is observed for any color.<br><br>
Example 2<br>

The formulations are adjusted to pH 5-6 with acetic acid and applied to polyethylene coated paper sheet using the appropriate draw down bar to generate a 20 gsm (grams per square meter) coating after drying.<br>
Using an Encad 700 printer with GS+ inks, a 4 block pattern of black, cyan, magenta.and yellow is printed on each fully dried formulated sheet  Dry time is measured using a BYK Dry Time Recorder at 67°F/25% relative humidity.<br><br>
Dry times for the formulations containing polymers of the present invention are outstanding.<br><br>
Light Fastness<br>
Coated papers are prepared as above. Color sqares of yellow, magenta and cyan at both 50% and 100% optical densities are printed onto the coated papers using the HP 970 Cxi printer. L,a,b color is then recorded before and after 48 hours of exposure in an Atlas Ci65 Xenon WeatherOmeter, inner and outer borosilicate filters, 50°C, 50% RH, irradiance 0.35 wm2 at 340 nm.<br><br>
The light fastness of the prints on coating formulations containing polymers of the present invention are outstanding.<br>
Example 3<br>
Gloss<br>
Media coating formulations are prepared as below:<br>
resin   (30% solids in water)	25g<br>
acrylamide copolymer (20% solids in water) 75g<br>
glycerin	0.7g<br>
The acrylamide copolymer is a copolymer of a 60/15/25 weight ratio of acrylamide/N.N-di-methyl-N-methacryloyloxyethyl-N-(3-sulphopropyl) ammonium betaine/methoxy PEG 350 methacrylate.<br>
The formulations are adjusted to pH 3 with acetic acid and applied to polyethylene coated paper sheet using the appropriate draw down bar to generate a 20 gsm (grams per<br><br>
square meter) coating after drying. The resulting sheets have the look and feel of photographic paper with little to no difference in gloss when compared to polyethylene coated paper likewise coated with the acrylamide copolymer alone. Results are below.<br><br>
Dry Time<br>
Resin formulations and coated sheets are prepared as above.<br>
Using a HP 970 Cxi printer, a 4 block pattern of black, blue, green,and red at 100% print density is printed on the coated sheets. Dry time is recorded as the time required until no visible transfer is observed when subjected to rubbing with a tissue. Results are below.<br><br>

Resin formulations and coated sheets are prepared as above.<br>
A resin formulation with resin G is also prepared with an added 1.5 weight percent of tris^^.e^-tetramethyM^-dihydroxypiperidine) citrate salt (NOH salt).<br>
A fully formulated, commercial, state of the art ink jet paper, tlford photoglossy paper, is also employed.<br><br>
Color sqares of yellow, magenta and cyan at both 50% and 100% optical densities are printed onto the coated sheets of the present invention and the Itford photoglossy paper using the HP 970 Cxi printer. L, a, b color is then recorded before and after 48 hours of exposure in an Atlas Ci65 Xenon WeatherOmeter, inner and outer borosilicate filters, 50°C, 50% RH, irradiance 0.35 wm2 at 340 nm. Results are below.<br><br>

i<br>
Effect of removing acid<br><br>
The coating is drawn down onto a clear polyester substrate (PET). The emulsion polymer is diluted with distilled water to 15% n.v. and solubilized with acetic acid. The resultant pH is 4.7.<br>
A 60 RDS Meyer bar is used to apply the polymer and the coating is dried at 90°C for the periods of time specified in the table. Red, green and blue prints are printed on an HP 5550 desktop printer at 65°F and 7% RH (relative humidity).<br><br>
The samples are each mounted to stainless steel supports and submerged in room temperature distilled water for 10 minutes. The prints are held vertically to allow the excess water to drain off.<br>
A cotton swab is used to rub the print. The average number of rubs required to remove the printed inks are recorded in the table above.<br>
The results show that sequential removal of the volatile components in a coating of a polymer composition of the present invention improves the wet rub resistance of a printed image made thereon.<br><br><br><br><br>
