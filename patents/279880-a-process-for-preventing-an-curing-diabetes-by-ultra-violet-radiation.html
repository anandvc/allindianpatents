				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION:<br>
The invention relates to a process for preventing and curing diabetes by ultra violet<br>
radiation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Vitamin D has been recently brought into focus as essential element in human health<br>
as far as its role as a catalyst for calcium absorption is concerned. Vitamin D has<br>
been considered, in recent times, to be a protection against chronic diseases such as<br>
cancer, osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease sclerosis, etc. In fact, there is also<br>
increasing evidence that Vitamin D is helpful in preventing/treatment of Type-I<br>
diabetes and controlling Type-II diabetes.<br>
The humans get Vitamin D through not only sunlight (UV B radiation) but by<br>
various foods which contains Vitamin D such as certain kinds of fish, egg, etc. or by<br>
Vitamin D supplements in the shape of tablets or fortified milk products. Also there<br>
are some UV B light generating machines, which are used for the generation of extra<br>
Vitamin D in the case of skin diseases treatment. In some countries such as Canada<br>
such machines are even approved for insurance reimbursements for skin patients.<br>
The present invention is to delineate and develop a process for application of UVB<br>
light radiation, under optimum conditions on the diabetes patients for its prevention<br>
and cure.<br>
Also the devices or machines such as: Vitamin D photo therapy equipments or any<br>
such device used for treatment of other diseases through UV could be attempted for<br>
prevention/cure of all types of diabetes when used under the optimum established in<br>
the current invention.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTIONS:<br>
An object of this invention is to propose a process for preventing and curing diabetes<br>
by way of generating extra Vitamin D using UV B/UV photo radiation.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a process for controlling the onset of<br>
progression of Type-I and Type-II using UV B/UV photo radiation generated from<br>
phototherapy devices resulting in generating Vitamin D.<br>
Yet another object of the invention is to propose a process of applying artificial<br>
(through lamps) UV B/UV photo radiation of intensity between 290 to 311 nm<br>
(narrowband) for an exposure time of 5 to 6 minutes on the patient body to prevent<br>
or cure diabetes.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for treatment of all types of<br>
diabetes by generation of Vitamin D from ultra violet light radiation, when applied<br>
on human bodies under optimum conditions.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION:<br>
According to the invention there is provided a process for treatment of diabetes by<br>
UV A/UV B broadband/narrowband radiation with an intensity varying between<br>
290 to 311 nm for a time period between 5 to 6 minutes on human body. The said<br>
radiation when applied on human body accelerates generation of Vitamin D, which<br>
in turn prevent or/and cure diabetes. According to the literature such radiation has<br>
the capacity of increasing the "25-dihydroxyvitamin D" and "25 D" and is<br>
measurable through blood tests. Various sources have also suggested that the<br>
deficiency of Vitamin is one of the major reasons for non-absorption of insulin in<br>
humans. In other words, in the case of Type-I and Type-II diabetes person activity<br>
form of receptors such as 25-D 3 have been identified in both beta cells and immune<br>
cells and Vitamin D deficiency has been shown to impair insulin syntheses and<br>
secretion in humans.<br>
The current invention also provides a process for use UV A/UV B broadband and<br>
narrowband radiation or any photo therapy device with controlled intensity and<br>
exposure time for prevention as well as curing of diabetes.<br>
The importance of exposure of UV B narrowband is especially of importance in this<br>
procedure. The UV B (311 nanometer) although occurs in natural sunlight but is not<br>
available in substantial volume because the stratosphere normally filters of sunlight<br>
wavelengths which are less than 290 to 300 nanometers. The risk of erythema during<br>
a UV B radiation exists in a normal UVB, but narrowband is being suggested, which<br>
substantially prevents erythema. With this precaution the use of UVB in generating<br>
Vitamin D in human skin through artificial light of the lamps and thereby increasing<br>
the absorption/enhancement of Vitamin D leading to better control of glyceamia<br>
and secretion of insulin is advised as a process and such link between artificial<br>
generation of UVB narrowband radiation (which minimizes the risk of erythema)<br>
leading to control of diabetes is the claim made in the present application.<br>
The following example illustrates the exact process of treatment of diabetes by<br>
controlled ultra violet radiation, when applied on human body:<br>
(i) A portable unit of UV lamp with a controlled device was considered<br>
as the source of UV radiation, which has a spectrum akin to natural<br>
sunlight to find if it could enhance 25-hydroxy Vitamin D [23 (OH)<br>
D] levels in the proven cases of diabetes mellitus Type-II.<br>
(ii) Two persons were subject to UV light sessions at 295 nm, of 5<br>
minutes each for 10 weeks at the rate of three times per week.<br>
(iii) Serum 25 (OH) D levels measured was increased from the beginning<br>
of 21 ±3 ng/ml to 27±4 ng/ml at the end of 10 weeks.<br>
(iv) UV radiations which are generally known to be a surrogate to<br>
sunlight for enhancing D3 (Vitamin D) levels, once used through a<br>
controlled process mechanism as explained above, improve<br>
glycaemia and secretion of insulin in patients of Type-II Diabetes,<br>
with established deficiency of Vitamin D.<br>
(v) The process that defines the above relationship is through the<br>
relationship of Vitamin D receptors and Vitamin D binding proteins<br>
in pancreas and the observed linkage to insulin stabilization and<br>
secretions.<br>
The following table further substantiates the innovative process and<br>
effect of the treatment:<br>
Period of treatment kept constant: 5 minutes each for 10 weeks at<br>
the rate of three times per week<br>
