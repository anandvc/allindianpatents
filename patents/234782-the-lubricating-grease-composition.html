(See Section 10)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
THE LUBRICATING GREASE COMPOSITION<br><br><br><br>
INDIAN OIL CORPORATION LTD. of the address: G-9, Ali Yavar Jung Marg, Bandra(East) Mumbai-40005l(lndia).<br>
The following specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it has to be performed:<br><br><br><br>
1501<br><br>
3^<br>
MUM 5 DEC 2005<br><br>
Field of invention:<br>
This invention relates to the development of mixed base complex greases in which Titanium complex grease is one component and Lithium, Aluminium complex, sulphonate complex, clay or Lithium complex grease is the other component along with additives. Novel process for preparing these greases disclosed in this invention , has given synergistic effect in physico-chemical and performance characteristics. Best emerged combination in these mixed base have been observed to exhibit improved properties in shelf life, at high temperature application, extreme pressure, anti-wear properties.<br>
Back ground of the invention:<br>
In prior art, metallic soaps, their complex soaps and mixed soaps of Na -Al, or Li -Ca have generally been reported as thickeners in lubricating grease industry. Use of mixed base soap is an upcoming trend. The use of mixed soaps provides added advantage in actual application areas because of mixed characteristics of both the soaps.<br>
Polishuk in 'Brief history of lubricating greases' described different type of mixed base greases viz, Al-Ca, Al-complex-clay base, Ba-Al base, Al-complex-Na base, Ca-Al, Ca-Pb, Li-Ca (US Patent Nos: 2379245, 2332247, 2209500, 3595789) etc. Some of the mixed base greases prepared by many researchers could not get commercial appreciation may be due to compatibility of two soaps, antagonistic effect of two different soaps or commercially not viable. Polishuk reported (US 3620975) preparation of Al-complex-clay base grease for passenger car application which consist of stearic acid 2.1%, benzoic acid 1.2%, a derivative of Al-alkoxide 5.0%, Baragel clay 1% and additives. This grease was reported to perform better in wheel bearing application. Zimmer and Morway (U.S. 2062346) prepared Ca-Al base grease by use of Ca-Soap 12%, Al-Soap 10-15%, Glycerine 1% and mineral oil (300 SUS @ at 100°F) and reported to be improved in adhesive and water resistant properties. Morway and Ramsden (US 3223633) reported Li-Ca greases for channeling application which was consisting of LiOH (4.1%) , hydrofol acid 51 (15%), hydrated lime (2.0%), Azelaic acid (3.0%), acetic acid (3.0%). This grease was reported to have penetration 245 and drop point over 450° F. Over a period of time Li-Ca base grease became more popular probably because of their excellent water resistance characteristics and commercial reasons.<br>
2<br><br>
It was found interesting to note hereinto that majority of soap or complex soap thickeners of commercial significance for formulating lubricating greases are either metals derived from alkali or alkaline earth metals. Also metallic soap thickener from transition metal elements viz titanium for formulating, lubricating greases have been reported in US Patent 5387351 of the Applicants herein. However, the mixed thickener base greases of transition metal like Titanium with other metallic soaps have at all not been reported in literature. However it expected if mixed soaps based on Titanium as one of the component is formed, may exhibit high performance properties.<br>
