PYRANONE PROTEASE INHIBITORS<br>
i application is a contimiation-in-part of prior provisional application U.S.S.N.<br>
244,434 filed October 31,2000.<br>
ACKGRQUNP OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to unique oral dosage formulations of 5,6-<br>
dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrones compounds. In particular, the present invention relates to a<br>
substantially alcohol-free and propylene glycol-free, microemulsion formulation of 5,6-<br>
dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone protease inhibitors, which formulation substantially<br>
improves bioavailability and stability at room temperature.<br>
Background of the Related Art<br>
Since the identification of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) in<br>
the early 1980s, AIDS and its devastating consequences have become a subject of intense<br>
coverage in the press and study in the scientific literature. It is widely held that such<br>
syndrome is due to infection with a retrovirus commonly referred to as the human<br>
immunodeficiency virus (HTV). From its identification nearly twenty years ago until<br>
today, AIDS has progressed from a medical curiosity affecting only a small population to<br>
a problem of major proportion. Millions of people in the United States alone are believed<br>
to be seropositive for HIV.<br>
The first drug approved for the treatment of HIV infected individuals was<br>
zidovudine (AZT) on March 20, 1987. Zidovudine or AZT was approved to treat AIDS<br>
patients with recent initial episodes of pneumocystis carinii pneumonia, carinii pneumonia<br>
or patients infected with the virus and having an absolute CD4 lymphocyte count of less<br>
than 200/mm3 in the peripheral blood. AZT is believed to work by inhibiting viral reverse<br>
transcriptase, an enzyme necessary for human immunodeficiency virus replication.<br>
In a very short period of time, the number of approved anti-retroviral drugs<br>
has increased from one drug with modest activity to twelve with substantial potency. The<br>
approved anti-retroviral drugs represent three classes: the nucleoside analog reverse<br>
transcriptase inhibitors; the non-nucleoside analog reverse transcriptase inhibitors; and the<br>
protease inhibitors. Highly active anti-retroviral therapy (known as "HAART") almost<br>
invariably includes a protease inhibitor in combination with one or more drugs from the<br>
other classes. Protease inhibitors as a class demonstrate potent anti-retroviral activity.<br>
The first protease inhibitor was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug<br>
Administration ("U.S. FDA") in 1995, and such class of drugs can be said to have<br>
revolutionized the treatment of HIV infection. The protease inhibitors may be<br>
characterized as having converted what was once considered to be a uniformly fatal<br>
disease to a more treatable, chronic infectious disease. Presently there are five protease<br>
inhibitors approved by the U.S. FDA: amprenavir, indinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir and<br>
saquinavir.<br>
Retroviral proteases are enzymes essential for maturation of viral particles<br>
to their infectious stages. Inhibition of the proteases, or their absence or non-functionality,<br>
results in the virus being unable to efficiently replicate, thereby preventing the production<br>
of infective viral particles. For example, the retroviral protease "gag-protease," one of the<br>
smallest enzymes yet characterized (consisting of only 99 arnino acids and demonstrating<br>
homology to aspartyl proteases such as pepsin and renin) is responsible for the correct<br>
proteolytic cleavage of the precursor proteins that are produced from the genome regions<br>
coding for the "group specific antigens" ("gag"). The protease is believed to be encoded<br>
by the "pol" region of the viral genome, which also contains regions for reverse<br>
transcriptase and integrase. Gag-protease cleaves the major core protein p24 of HJV-1<br>
and HIV-2 preferentially N-terminally of proline residues; for example, in the divalent<br>
residues Phe-pro, Leu-Pro or Tyr-Pro. During cleavage, the structural proteins of the virus<br>
core are liberated. In sum, gag-protease is needed for processing HIV-fusion polypeptide<br>
precursors permitting maturation of the gag and gag/pol fusion polypeptides, including<br>
capsid and replicative enzymes (e.g., reverse transcriptase, integrase).<br>
A number of highly potent HIV protease inhibitors have been described in<br>
the literature. By protease inhibitors it is meant a group of compounds that inhibit<br>
aspartate proteases of viral origin and which are useful in the prophylaxis or treatment of<br>
viral infections caused by retroviruses, such as HIV in mammals. Protease inhibitors can<br>
be said to have revolutionized the treatment of HIV infection in that combination therapy<br>
using such compounds with inhibitors of viral DNA polymerase reverse transcriptase can<br>
result in the apparent complete suppression of virus replication. Resistance to protease<br>
inhibitors is believed to be the result of mutations within the retroviral protease coding<br>
domain. Unfortunately, with respect to the five currently approved protease inhibitors in<br>
the United States, most of these mutations are able to contribute to cross-resistance<br>
(Swanstrom et al., Pharmacol. Ther., 86(2): 145 - 170 (2000)).<br>
HIV protease inhibitors may be peptidemimetic or non-peptideminietic in<br>
nature.<br>
Compounds of a reduced peptidic nature, or non-peptidic nature, generally<br>
show improved pharmacokinetic profiles over their peptidic counterparts. Peptidic HTV<br>
protease inhibitors frequently demonstrate low bioavailability and rapid excretion owing<br>
to rapid gastrointestinal breakdown. In general, non-peptidic compounds have better<br>
bioavailability and are not excreted as rapidly.<br>
Presently available non-peptidic proteinase inhibitors may be characterized<br>
as hydrophobic and/or lipophilic in character. Because of such solubility characteristic,<br>
i.e., poor aqueous solubility, conventional solid and liquid pharmaceutical preparations<br>
containing these inhibitors may not be absorbed in a satisfactory manner. Of the various<br>
factors that can affect the bioavailability of a drug when administered orally (which<br>
include aqueous solubility, drug absorption through the gastrointestinal tract, dosage<br>
strength and first pass effect), aqueous solubility is often found to be among the most<br>
important factors. Poorly water soluble compounds often exhibit either erratic or<br>
incomplete absorption, and thus produce a less than desirable response.<br>
5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone compounds are known to be potent<br>
inhibitors of retroviral proteases. They are thus useful in inhibiting the replication of the<br>
human immunodeficiency virus (strains of HTV-1 or HTV-2 and/or human T-cell leukemia<br>
viruses (HTLV-I or HTLV-H) and in preventing AIDS. Such protease inhibitors,<br>
however, generally demonstrate extremely poor aqueous solubility. For example, the free<br>
acid form of the 5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone sulfonamide compound, tipranavir, has<br>
an extremely low aqueous solubility of about 10 j-ig/ml at a pH of from about 6 to about <br>
Nearly 15 capsules per dose, twice a day, of the disodium salt (4.5 grams) must be taken in<br>
order to achieve a therapeutic drug level. Attempts to identify other salts of such<br>
compounds in solid forms, which would substantially improve aqueous solubility, have<br>
not been successful. Formulations of salts of these compounds generally are prone to<br>
precipitation of the parent free-acid in the gastrointestinal tract.<br>
Many attempts have been made to improve the bioavailability of nonpeptidic<br>
protease inhibitors in general, and 5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone peptidase<br>
inhibitors in particular. There is an art-recognized need for developing improved oral<br>
dosage forms of HIV protease inhibitors, which will have suitable oral bioavailability,<br>
stability and side effects profiles. Given the low solubility of many non-peptidic protease<br>
inhibitors in free and salt form, a number of efforts have been undertaken to deliver the<br>
drug in so-called "emulsified" formulations, that is, formulations containing the drug, a<br>
hydrophilic phase, and a lipophilic phase. Such strategy may be borrowed from a similar<br>
strategy undertaken with respect to solubilization of cyclic poly-N-methylated<br>
undecapeptides of the cyclosporin class, the bioavailability of which were significantly.<br>
improved by mixing them in an emulsion comprising a lipophilic phase of medium-chain<br>
fatty acid triglycerides, a hydrophilic surfactant such as Cremophor RH 40 (BASF Corp.),<br>
and propylerie glycol (See, EP Patent No. 0 539 319 Bl). So-called SEDDS (selfemulsifying<br>
drug delivery system) formulations use high lipid and surfactant content to<br>
adequately disperse the drug upon mixing with an aqueous medium.<br>
International Application No. PCT/IJS97/20794 (WO 98/22106) to Abbott<br>
Laboratories discloses an oral liquid SEDDS pharmaceutical composition which is said to<br>
improve the oral bioavailability of HIV protease inhibitors, including certain protease<br>
inhibitors of the 5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone class. Such composition comprises a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable emulsified composition comprising a long-chain fatty acid<br>
composition, or a mixture of a pharmaceutically acceptable long-chain fatty acid and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable alcohol, and optionally a surfactant (such as Cremophor EL,<br>
BASF Corp.). Preferred compositions comprise ethanol or propylene glycol or both. It is<br>
stated that it is preferred that the long-chain fatty acid composition comprises from about<br>
40 to about 70 percent by weight of the total solution, the surfactant from about 5 to about<br>
10 percent by weight of the total solution, and ethanol or propylene glycol comprises from<br>
about 1 to about 15 percent by weight of the total solution. A study in beagles and<br>
humans demonstrates that, for at least five HIV protease inhibitors, improved mean<br>
bioavailability is seen over the free base and bis-toxylate salt of the HIV protease inhibitor<br>
ritonavir.<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,484,801 to Abbott Laboratories covers a pharmaceutical<br>
composition with an HIV protease inhibiting compound in a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
organic solvent which composition has: (a) a solvent selected from propylene glycol and<br>
polyethylene glycol (in an amount of from about 10 percent to about 50 percent by weight<br>
of the total solution) or (b) a solvent selected from polyoxyethyleneglycerol, triricinoleate,<br>
polyethylene glycol 40 hydrogenated castor oil, fractionated coconut oil, polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitan monocleate and 2-(2-ethoxyethoxy)ethanol (in an amount of from about 5<br>
percent to about 35 percent by weight of the total solution) or (c) a mixture thereof, and<br>
ethanol or propylene glycol (in an amount of about 5 percent to about 45 percent by<br>
weight of the total solution).<br>
International Application No. PCT/EP96/02431 (WO 96/39142) and U.S.<br>
Patent No. 6,008,228 to F, Hoffmann-La Roche AG teach a pharmaceutical composition<br>
which is also said to improve the bioavailability of protease inhibitors. The composition<br>
includes a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier comprising monoglycerides of mediumchain<br>
fatty acids, which preferably include monoglycerides of saturated Ce to Ci2 fatty<br>
acids and have an acid value of less than or equal to about 2.5. It is said that it is preferred<br>
that the ratio of monoglycerides of medium chain fatty acid to the protease inhibitor be<br>
about at least 1.5.<br>
International Patent Nos. PCT/US95/0529 to UpJohn, mat discloses the<br>
usefulness of 5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone compounds to treat retro viral infections,<br>
does not recognize the inherent bioavailability problems of such compounds. The patent<br>
teaches that such compounds may be prepared in conventional compressed tablets (mixing<br>
the compounds with conventional ingredients such as talc, magnesium stearate, etc.), as<br>
disodium salts, or prepared in conventional syrups and elixirs.<br>
International Patent Applications PCT/US98/14816 (WO 99/06043),<br>
PCT/US98/14817 (WO 99/06044), PCT/US98/14818 (WO 99/06024), and U.S. Patent<br>
No. 6,121,313 to Pharmacia &amp; UpJohn Company teach self-emulsifying formulations<br>
containing alkaline active compounds which are said to provide for improved oral<br>
bioavailabilty of such compounds. The patents disclose compositions including a mixture<br>
of diglyceride and monoglycerides or basic amines along with one or more<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable surfactants and solvents which are said to provide increased<br>
absolute oral bioavailabilities. A preferred surfactant is Cremophor EL or Cremophor<br>
RH40, and a preferred solvent is propylene glycol or a mixture comprising propylene<br>
glycol and 95% (v/v) ethanol.<br>
With respect to 5,6-dihydro~4-hydroxy-2-pyrone protease inhibitors,<br>
PCT/US9S/14816 teaches that the solvent used may comprise polypropylene glycol,<br>
propylene glycol, polyethylene glycol, glycerol, ethanol, triacetin, dimethyl isosorbide,<br>
glycolfurol, propylene carbonate, water, dimethyl acetamide or a mixture thereof. The<br>
preferred solvent for such compounds is said to be propylene glycol or a mixture<br>
comprising propylene glycol and 95% (v/v) ethanol. In a mixture of propylene glycol and<br>
ethanol, propylene glycol is said to be in an amount of from about 50% to about 95%. The<br>
surfactants found useful with such compounds are disclosed to be non-ionic surfactants<br>
including Polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil (e.g. Cremophor RH40), Polyoxyl 35 castor<br>
oil (eg. Cremophor EL or Cremophor EL-P), polysorbates, Solutol HS-15, Tagat TO,<br>
Peglicol 6-oleate, polyoxyethylene stearates, saturated polyglycolyzed glycerides, or<br>
poloxaniers. The preferred surfactants for such emulsified compositions are specified to<br>
be Cremophor RH40 or Cremophor EL. When amines are employed in the composition it<br>
is disclosed that such should comprise lower alkylamines such as ethanolamine,<br>
diethanolamine, triethanolamine, dimethylamino-ethanol, tris (hydroxymethyl)<br>
aminomethane or ethylenediamine; quaternary ammoniums such as choline hydroxide;<br>
and basic amino acids such as arginine, lysine or guanidine. The preferred lower<br>
alkylamine is dimethylaminoethanol or tris(liydroxymethyl) aminomethane. When a<br>
mixture of diglyceride and monoglyceride is included in the composition, such mixture<br>
preferably comprises a ratio of from about 9:1 to about 6:4 by weight (diglyceride:<br>
monoglyceride) wherein the diglyceride and monoglyceride are mono- or di- unsaturated<br>
fatty acid esters of glycerol having sixteen to twenty-two carbon atom chain length. A<br>
typical pyranone composition of the invention is said to comprise from 1 to 40 percent of<br>
the drug, from about 5 to 35 percent of diglyceride and monoglyceride mixture, and from<br>
about 10 to about 50 percent "by weight of the pharmaceutically acceptable solvent. A<br>
basic amine may be optionally added in an amount of from about 0.1 to about 10 percent<br>
by weight of the total composition.<br>
Among the 5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrones known to have protease<br>
inhibitory activity, the 5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone sulfonamide class has in<br>
particular been found to demonstrate high protease inhibitory activity (Turner et al., J<br>
Med. Chem., 41(3): 3467 - 3476 (1998)). One in particular has shown excellent potency<br>
against the viral aspartate proteases of a variety of HIV type 1 laboratory strains and<br>
clinical isolates, including those resistant to the reverse transcriptase inhibitors zidovudine<br>
and delavirdine — the non-peptide compound HIV protease inhibitor, tipranavir, (6R)-3-<br>
[{(lR)-l-[3-( {[5-(trifluoromethyl)(2-pyridyl)]sulfonyl} amino)phenyl]propyl }-4-hydroxy-<br>
6-(2-phenylethyl)-6-propyl-5,6-dihydro-2H-pyran-2-one (also published under the<br>
designations U-140690 and FNU-140690):<br>
Formula IV<br>
Tipranavir (Formula IV) (M.W. = 602.98) is known to be highly active<br>
against HIV-1 variants resistant to the peptidomimetic protease inhibitors (Poppe et al.,<br>
Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 41(5): 1058 - 1063 (1997)). In vitro studies with the<br>
drug demonstrate a Ki value of about 8 pM (i.e., high enzymatic inhibition) and an IC90<br>
value of about 100 nM in antiviral cell culture (Turner et al., J. Med. Chem., 41(18): 3467<br>
- 3476 (1998)). It has a Log P of about 6.1, and pKas at 6.2 and 8.2. It is hypothesized<br>
that tipranavir binds in a flexible matter to the protease active site, making it a better<br>
protease inhibitor than the other presently available protease inhibitors (Larder et al.,<br>
LAP AC 3rd International Workshop on HIV Drug Resistance and Treatment Strategies,<br>
June 23 - 26 (1999)).<br>
In an in vitro culture study of 134 clinical isolates with a wide range of<br>
resistance to currently available peptidomimetic protease inhibitors, it was determined that<br>
of 105 viruses with more than tenfold resistance to three or four proteinase inhibitors, and<br>
an average of 6.1 mutations in the protease enzyme gene, ninety percent were susceptible<br>
to tipranavir (Larder et al., AIDS, 14(13): 1943 - 1948 (2000)). In another study,<br>
tipranavir has been shown to retain sustained antiviral activity against isolates resistant to<br>
indinavir, ritonavir and nelfinavir, three presently available protease inhibitors (Rusconi et<br>
al., Antimicrob. Agents Chemother., 44(5): 1328 -1332 (2000). Similar sustained activity<br>
has also been reported with respect to saquinavir resistance (Larder et al., IAPAC 3rd<br>
International Workshop on HIV Drug Resistance and Treatment Strategies, June 23 - 26<br>
(1999)).<br>
5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone protease inhibitors, and in particular the<br>
5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone sulfonamide inhibitors, such as tipranavir, have been<br>
found to be particularly difficult to formulate into oral dosage forms. Numerous attempts<br>
have been undertaken to formulate such drugs into a reasonably bioavailable oral product.<br>
Tipranavir, for example, forms highly hygroscopic salts, reducing the stability of the drug.<br>
The innovator of tipranavir, after numerous years of attempting to define an optimal oral<br>
formulation, currently produces an emulsified formulation comprising the drug, a<br>
lipophilic phase comprising a mixture of diglycerides and monoglycerides, a surfactant, a<br>
basic amine, and an aqueous phase comprising propylene glycol and alcohol, all packaged<br>
in a soft gelatin capsule. Such formulation while providing good oral bioavailabilty of the<br>
drug suffers from a number of drawbacks including: a tendency of the capsules to soften<br>
and to stick to one another over time; a noticeable decrease in bioavailability after<br>
encapsulation in a soft gelatin capsule; a need to refrigerate the formulation until use to<br>
prevent change in capsule composition; and the requirement of complicated manufacturing<br>
processes which must be employed to produce consistent capsule fills, especially due to<br>
the highly volatile nature of ethanol.<br>
There is a need therefore, for improved oral formulations of protease<br>
inhibitors in general, more particularly of 5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone protease<br>
inhibitors, and yet more particularly of 5,6-dihydro-4-hydroxy-2-pyrone sulfonamide<br>
protease inhibitors such as tipranavir.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention discloses improved oral formulations of pyranone<br>
protease inhibitors and processes for manufacturing such formulations. Such formulations<br>
provide for improved solubilization, stability and/or bioavailability of the pyranone drug<br>
and permit less onerous manufacturing processes to be undertaken in the fill process and<br>
allow the capsules to be stored at room temperature. In particular, advantageous oral<br>
dosage formulations of tipranavir are provided.<br>

It has been discovered that much of the difficulty with present day<br>
pyranone protease inhibitor oral formulations pertains to the use of ethanol and propylene<br>
glycol in the formulation. As discussed above with respect to prior art disclosures, while<br>
other solvents have been suggested to find utility in forming a microemulsion of pyranone<br>
protease inhibitor compounds, the incorporation of ethanol and propylene glycol into such<br>
microemulsion formulations has long been thought to be preferred and to lead to an<br>
optimal formulation. These solvents, while very good in forming emulsions of pyranone<br>
protease inhibitors, have been discovered to migrate into the gelatin shells surrounding<br>
such microemulsion formulations, thereby causing a change in the phase composition of<br>
the formulation, the solubility of the drug, and adversely affecting the structural integrity<br>
of the capsule. As a result, the capsules become sticky at room temperature and therefore<br>
require refrigerated storage condition.<br>
Novel self-emulsifying formulations have been discovered which do not<br>
require the inclusion of ethanol or propylene glycol in the formulation. As these<br>
formulations are particularly stable at room temperature, a greatly improved<br>
pharmaceutical, preparation for oral administration of pyranone protease inhibitors is<br>
disclosed. Such formulation offers patients taking pyranone protease inhibitors the ability<br>
to free their activities from, places within the reach of facilities offering adequate<br>
refrigeration. Furthermore, such formulation shows a significantly more consistent<br>
bioavailability profile than present day formulations which use significant amounts of<br>
ethanol or propylene glycol in their formulations.<br>
The present invention concerns a formulation that is substantially free of<br>
significant amounts of ethanol and propylene glycol (preferably less than about 0.5%,<br>
more preferably less than about 0.1%, alone or in combination) that provides for a<br>
significantly more stable formulation of pyranone protease inhibitors and in particular<br>
sulfonamide pyranone protease inhibitors such as tipranavir. Such formulations comprise<br>
from about 1 to about 40 percent by weight of total composition pyranone protease<br>
inhibitor, from about 5 to about 35 percent by weight of the total composition of a<br>
lipophilic phase, preferably a mixture of diglycerides and monoglycerides, from about 20<br>
to about 60 percent by weight of the total composition surfactant, and about 10 to about 40<br>
percent by weight of the total composition of a polyethylene glycol having an average<br>
molecular weight of greater than about 300 but less than 600, and from about 0.1 to about<br>
10 percent by weight of the total composition of one or more basic amines.<br>
Surprisingly, it has been determined by the present inventor that<br>
polyethylene glycols having an average molecular weight of greater than about 300 but<br>
less than 600 (preferably about 400) may be used in self-emulsifying microemulsion<br>
formulations to solubilize pyranone protease inhibitors, in particular sulfonamide<br>
pyranone protease inhibitors, without the need for alcohol or propylene glycol, and that<br>
such polymers do not migrate into or adversely affect gelatin capsules.<br>
Presented with numerous alternative possibilities for formulating the<br>
pyranone protease inhibitors without alcohol or propylene glycol, numerous<br>
rnicroemulsion phase studies were undertaken using various combinations of materials to<br>
determine workable formulations having clinically significant bioavailabilities. After<br>
numerous failed attempts, it was discovered that certain polyethylene glycols, of<br>
appropriate molecular weight, could effectively replace propylene glycol and/or ethanol<br>
used in conventional pyranone protease inhibitor formulations. Such alteration is<br>
relatively cheap and effective, and was surprisingly found to significantly improve the<br>
bioavailabilty and stability.<br>
In one embodiment, there is disclosed a pharmaceutical composition<br>
substantially free of alcohol and propylene glycol comprising a pyranone compound of<br>
formula I, II or [II as a pharmaceutically active agent, one or more pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable surfactants; and a polyethylene glycol having a mean molecular weight of<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention overcomes many of the problems associated with the<br>
less than desirable stability and formulation characteristics of pyranone protease<br>
inhibitors. The present invention provides novel formulations of pyranone protease<br>
inhibitors that significantly improve the solubility and bioavailabilty of such protease<br>
inhibitors in oral dosage forms.<br>
Dissolution performance is an important consideration in any oral<br>
formulation. Formulation, however, must also take into account the need for<br>
economically practicable methods to produce a wide range of oral potencies that are<br>
physiochemically stable. Further, components of any formulation must possess<br>
satisfactory processing properties. The present invention provides for the economical<br>
production and processing of physiochemically stable oral dosage forms of pyranone<br>
protease inhibitors having improved bioavailability.<br>
Compounds of Formulas I, II, III, and TV of this application are disclosed<br>
and claimed in International Patent Application No. PCT/US95/05219 and may be<br>
prepared according to the procedures described in International Patent Application No.<br>
WO 95/30670, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein in their entirety by<br>
reference. By "pyranoae protease inhibitor" is meant any compound defined by Formulas<br>
I, II, III and IV which inhibit retroviral protease,<br>
The self-emulsifying formulation of the present invention refers to a<br>
composition comprising a pyranone protease inhibitor, a lipophilic phase, a hydrophilic<br>
phase preferably with polyethylene glycol, one or more pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
surfactants and a basic amine in the amount from 0.1% to about 10% by weight of total<br>
composition. By "self-emulsifying formulation" it is meant a concentrated composition<br>
capable of generating emulsions or micioemulsions upon mixing with sufficient aqueous<br>
media. The emulsions or microemulsions generated from the present invention are<br>
solutions comprising a hydrophilic phase and lipophilic phase. Microemulsions are also<br>
characterized by their thermodynamic stability and small average droplet size, generally<br>
less than about 0,15 microns.<br>
By "basic amine" is meant lower alkylarnines such as, for example,<br>
ethanolamine, diethanolamme, triethanolamine, dimethylaminoethanol, tris(hydroxymethyl)<br>
aminomethane or ethylenediamine; quaternary ammoniums such as, for example,<br>
choline hydroxide; basic amino acids such as, for example, arginine, lysine or guanidine.<br>
The preferred lower alkylamiae is dimethylaminoethanol or tris(hydroxymethyl}<br>
aminomethane.<br>
By the term "pharmaceutically acceptable surfactant" is meant to include<br>
non-ionic surfactants, including Polyoxyl 40 hydrogenated castor oil sold under the trade<br>
name, among others, Cremophor RH40; Polyoxyl 35 castor oil sold under the trade name,<br>
among others, Cremophor EL or Crernophor EL-P (BASF Corp.); Polysorbates; Solutol<br>
HS-15; Tagat TO; Peglicol 6-oleate; Polyoxyethylene stearates; saturated polyglycolyzed<br>
caprylic-capric glycerides sold under the trade name, among others, Labrasol (Gattefosse,<br>
Westwood NJ); saturated polyglycolyzed glycerides; or poloxamers, all of which are<br>
commercially availableThe preferred surfactant is Cremophor EL.<br>
By "lipophilic component" or "lipophilic phase" is meant to include any<br>
number of components exhibiting lipid-like properties, and high solubility in lipids, and<br>
includes triglycerides of caprylic/capric acid, sold under the trade name, among others, of<br>
Captex 300 (Abitec, Columbus OH), trans-esterification products of kernel oil and PEG<br>
(or unsaturated polyglycolyzed glycerides obtained by partial alcoholyisis of apricot<br>
kernel oil consisting of glycerides and PEG esters), known under the trade name, among<br>
others, of Labrafil M 1944 CS (Gattefosse, Westwood, NJ); mono- and di- glycerides of<br>
caprylic and capric acid in glycerol, known under the trade name, among others, as<br>
Capmul MCM (Abitec, Columbus OH); and fractionated oil (such as coconut oil)<br>
containing caprylic-capric acids triglycerides, known under the trade name, among others,<br>
asMiglyo!812.<br>
By the term "monoglyceride" is meant a fatty acid ester of glycerol having<br>
structural formula HOCH2-CH(OH)-CH2(O2CR) or HOCH2-CH(02CR)-CH2OH, wherein<br>
R is a mono-saturated or di-saturated alkyl group having eight to ten carbon atoms. By the<br>
term "diglyceride" is meant a fatty acid ester of glycerol having structural formula<br>
HOCH2-CH(O2CR) -CH2(O2CR)- or (RC02)CH2-CH(OH)-CH2(O2CR), wherein R is<br>
mono-saturated or di-saturated alkyl group having eight to ten carbon atoms. A mixture of<br>
diglyceride and monoglyceride may be prepared by mixing individual diglyceride and<br>
monoglyceride in appropriate relative proportion and/or by partial hydrolysis of<br>
triglyceride, or transesterifcation reaction of trigrycerides, diglycerides with glycerol.<br>
By polyethylene glycol or PEG is meant a polymer having the general<br>
formula HOCH2(CH2)CH2)mCH2OH, where m represents the average number of<br>
oxyethylene groups. The number which follows PEG indicates the average molecular<br>
weight of the polymer. Commercially, PEG may be obtained from the Union Carbide<br>
Corp., among other sources.<br>
In a particularly advantageous composition of the present invention with<br>
respect to the composition of Formula IV (tipranavir), there is provided a PEG-based selfemulsifying<br>
vehicle containing between about 10 percent to about 40 percent PEG 400<br>
(more preferably about 15 percent to about 30 percent PEG 400), between about 20<br>
percent to about 60 percent Cremophor EL (more preferably about 35 percent to about 50<br>
percent Cremophor EL), between about 5 percent to about 35 percent Capmul MCM<br>
(more preferably between about 7 percent to about 15 percent Capmul MCM), and<br>
between about 0.1 percent to about 10 percent basic amine.<br>
It has been noted that conventional self-emulsifying formulations of<br>
pyranone protease inhibitors comprising propylene glycol and/or alcohol stored for<br>
periods of time in soft gelatin capsules exhibit slower and less complete dispersion in<br>
aqueous medium, and an approximately 40 percent decrease in dissolution compared to<br>
comparable freshly made formulations. It has also been noted that the bioavailability of<br>
these drags in humans is lower than that of a bulk solution of similar formulation that is<br>
filled into gelatin capsules immediately before administration. It was hypothesized that<br>
such effects could be attributable to solvent in the formulation migrating into the capsule.<br>
Initial studies were undertaken to alter the gelatin formulation of the<br>
capsule to prevent migration of solvents from the emulsifying formulation into the<br>
capsule. Such attempts were not successful. Studies were then undertaken to determine if<br>
the propylene glycol and alcohol solvents used in conventional formulations could be<br>
replaced in whole or part with another solvent.<br>
Microemulsion phase diagrams were constructed for systems containing<br>
various lipophilic phases, hydrophilic phases, and surfactants. After numerous studies it<br>
was determined that a number of pyranone protease inhibitors, including tipranavir, were<br>
soluble in polyethylene glycols within a defined average molecular weight range, and<br>
could be used to replace propylene glycol and ethanol found in conventional<br>
microemulsion formulations of such drugs.<br>
Fig. 1 is a phase diagram of a microemulsion comprising Cremophor EL as<br>
the surfactant, Capmul MCM as the lipophilic phase and, as in conventional formulations<br>
of pyranone protease inhibitors, propylene glycol as. the hydrophilic phase at different<br>
concentration ratios with respect to one another. As can be seen, such composition<br>
provides a stable microemulsion over a wide array of concentrations of each component.<br>
As propylene glycol is soluble in the capsule surrounding the formulation, however, the<br>
point defining the formulation in the phase diagram can vary considerably over time as<br>
more propylene glycol is removed from the emulsion. Consequently, the solubility of the<br>
drug in the formulation can change considerably over time.<br>
Fig. 2 is a phase diagram of a microemulsion comprising Cremophor EL as<br>
the surfactant, Capmul MCM as the lipophilic phase, and PEG-400 as the hydrophilic<br>
phase again at different concentration ratios with r&amp;spect to one another. The phase<br>
diagram employing PEG-400 (rather than propylene glycol as in Fig. 1} can be<br>
characterized as similar to that of that seen in Fig. 1.<br>
Studies undertaken to determine the effect of the lipophilic phase on the<br>
phase stability of the microemulsion of Fig. 2, suggest that it is preferred that the<br>
lipophilic phase comprise a mixture of medium chain mono- and di- glycerides, such as<br>
found in Caprnul MCM. Fig. 3 is a phase diagram of a microemulsion comprising<br>
Cremophor EL as the surfactant, PEG 4-00 as the hydrophilic phase, and Labrafil-M-1944<br>
CS as the lipophilic phase at different concentration ratios with respect to one another.<br>
Labrafil-M-1944 is a trans-esterification product of kernel oil and PEG, that is,<br>
unsaturated polyglycolyzed glycerides obtained by partial hydrolysis of apricot kernel oil,<br>
consisting of glycerides and PEG esters. The stability of the microemulsion over a wide<br>
range of concentrations of components was found to be more limited than the<br>
microemulsion system of Fig. 2 which employed Capmul MCM as the lipophilic phase.<br>
Capmul MCM is a mono- and di- glyceride mixture ofcaprylic/capric acid in glycerol.<br>
Slight improvement in the stability of the microemulsion of Fig. 2 was<br>
found by employing Labrasol as the surfactant rather than Cremophor EL. Fig. 4 is a<br>
phase diagram of a microemulsion comprising Labrasol as the surfactant, PEG 400 as the<br>
hydrophilic phase, and Capmul MCM as the lipophilic phase, at different concentration<br>
ratios with respect to one another. While Labiasol provided improved stability, Labrasol<br>
suffers from the disadvantage that its long term safety for oral use in humans has not yet<br>
been demonstrated.<br>
Fig. 5 is a graph of the in vitro dissolution of tipranavir from two selfemulsifying<br>
formulations set forth in Table 1 and Table 2. The formulation set forth in<br>
Table 2 differs from that in Table 1 in the replacement of the alcohol and propylene glycol<br>
with PEG 400.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
In vitro dissolution of the formulation of Table 2 (using PEG 400 instead of alcohol and<br>
propylene glycol as hydrophilic solvent as used in the formulation of Table 1), was found<br>
to be nearly identical to that of the formulation of Table 1 when such formulation was<br>
freshly filled into the soft gelatin capsules. In vitro dissolution of the formulation of Table<br>
2, on the other hand , was found to be substantially better over dissolution time than that<br>
of the Formulation of Table 1 when the formulation of Table 1 was refrigerated in the soft<br>
gelatin capsules at 4°C for 14 months.<br>
The self-emulsifying formulation of Table 2 was found to offer exceedingly<br>
good stability at room temperature as well as under refrigeration, whether stored in<br>
hydrophilic or lipophilic soft gel capsules kept in induction-sealed HDPE bottles.<br>
Fig. 6 is a graph of the in vitro dissolution of tipranavrr from the<br>
formulation as set forth in Table 2 encapsulated in a hydrophilic soft gel capsule and<br>
stored in induction-sealed HDPE bottles, after storing for different periods of time at<br>
different temperatures and/or relative humidities. All three preparations depicted, those<br>
kept for 3 months at 5°C, those kept at room temperature (25°C) for Smonths at 60%<br>
relative humidity, and those kept at 30°C for 3 months at 70% relative humidity, resulted<br>
in nearly identical dissolution profiles.<br>
Fig. 7 is a graph of the in vitro dissolution of tipranavir from the<br>
formulation as set forth in Table 2 encapsulated in a lipophilic soft gel cap, after storing<br>
for different periods of time at different temperatures and/or relative humidities. Nearly<br>
identical patterns as seen with the formulation encapsulated in hydrophilic soft gel<br>
capsules were discerned. The formulation of Table 2 when stored in lipophilic soft gel<br>
capsules demonstrated remarkable stability in dissolution profile when stored in inductionsealed<br>
HDPE bottles for 3 months at 5°C or 30°C at a relative humidity of 70%.<br>
Example 1 - Preparation of a PEG-Based Tipranavir SEDDS Formulation<br>
455 mg of Cremophor EL, 75 mg of Capmul MCM, and 173 mg of PEG<br>
400 were added to a mixing vessel and mixed (700 rpm) together while adding 2 mg of<br>
propyl gallate as an antioxidant. Mixing was continued until the solution was clear, then<br>
15 mg of Tris (predissolved in water in a 1:2 ratio) was added. Mixing was continued at<br>
high speed (1600 rpm) as tipranavir (250mg) was added to the solution. When the<br>
tipranavir was completely dissolved, mixing was subsequently stopped and the solution<br>
allowed to stand for de-gassing.<br>
Example 2 - Bioavajlability of PEG-Based Tipranavir Self-Emulsifying Formulation<br>
Male beagle dogs were used for the in vivo oral bioavailability study. A<br>
PEG-based tipranavir formulation as set forth in Table 2 was compared in dogs to the<br>
propylene glycol/ethanol formulation as set forth in Table 1 after encapsulation in soft<br>
gelatin capsules.. The bioavailability of the two formulations is found to be statistically<br>
the same.<br>
Further stability studies have been conducted with the formulation set forth<br>
in Table 2 in standard soft gelatin capsules. Such studies have shown that the formulation<br>
of the present invention presents less impurities and so appears to be more stable than the<br>
formulation set forth in Table 1 in standard soft gelatin capsules. Additionally, the soft<br>
gelatin capsules having the self-emulsifying formulation according to the present<br>
invention were not sticky at six months, 30° C and 70% relative humidity.<br>
While the invention has been described with respect to preferred<br>
embodiments, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that various changes and/or<br>
modifications can be made to the invention without departing from the spirit or scope of<br>
the invention as defined by the appended claims. All documents cited herein are<br>
