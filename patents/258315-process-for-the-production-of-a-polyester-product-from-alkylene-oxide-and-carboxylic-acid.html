				<td>Process for the Production of a Polyester Product from Alkylene Oxide and Carboxylic Acid<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process to produce a polyester product from alkylene oxide and carboxylic acid. More specifically this invention relates to a process to produce polyethylene terephthalate (PET) from ethylene oxide and terephthalic acid (TPA). Even more specifically, this process relates to a process to produce PET by reacting terephthalic acid and ethylene oxide in the presence of a catalyst and a solvent to form a partially esterified terephthalic acid product. The partially esterified terephthalic acid product is further reacted with a minimal amount of ethylene glycol to produce PET.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Thermoplastic polyesters are step growth polymers that are useful when made at high molecular weights. The first step in a common method of producing a polyester or copolyester, such as polyethylene terephthalate, is an esterification or ester-exchange stage where a diacid, typically terephthalic acid, or a diester, typically dimethylterephthalate, reacts with an appropriate diol, typically ethylene glycol, to give a bis(hydroxyalkyl)ester<br><br>
and some oligomers. Water or alcohol is evolved at this stage and is usually removed by fractional distillation.<br>
Pursuant to the goal of making polyethylene terephthalate and other polyesters, a great deal of patent literature is dedicated to describing processes for preparing terephthalic acid/ethylene glycol mixtures suitable as starting materials. In general, these inventions describe specific mixing schemes with a purified terephthalic acid solid and liquid ethylene glycol as starting materials. Additionally, there is a substantial body of literature devoted to producing a purified terephthalic acid in the powder form that is suitable for use in producing PET.<br>
In the present invention, a process to produce polyethylene terephthalate from ethylene oxide and terephthalic acid is provided. Terephthalic acid and ethylene oxide are reacted to form a partially esterified terephthalic acid product. The partially esterified terephthalic acid product for example is subsequently reacted with ethylene glycol in a conventional polyethylene terephthalic process or through the use of a pipe reactor to produce polyethylene terephthalate.<br>
The use of ethylene oxide can be a preferred method over using ethylene glycol. In addition, less heat input can be required during esterification using ethylene oxide versus using ethylene glycol. The polycondensation step can be conducted in one or more stages and can be completed with ethylene glycol addition, if needed, in order to increase the rate and to control the mole ratio. Suitable catalysts and additives can be<br><br>
added prior to or during polycondensation. Possible catalysts include compounds based on Sb, Ge, Ti, Al, Sn and Zr or combinations thereof.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
In one embodiment of this invention, a process to produce a partially esterified carboxylic acid product is provided. The process comprises contacting in a reactor zone at least one carboxylic acid with at least one alkylene oxide in the presence of a solvent and at least one basic catalyst to produce said partially esterified carboxylic acid product; wherein said alkylene oxide is present in a molar ratio ranging from about 0.5:1 to less than 1:1 alkylene oxide to carboxylic acid.<br>

Preferably, the solvent is oligomeric polyesters, xylene or toluene.<br>
A basic catalyst results in a pH greater than 8 when 1 gram of the catalyst is dissolved in 100 ml of water. Examples of suitable basic catalysts include, but are not limited to, primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, benzyltrialkyi ammonium hydroxide, alkyl/aryl ammonium hydroxide salts and tetraalkyl ammonium hydroxide salts. The basic catalyst can be triethylamine, tributylamine, trimethylamine, tripropylamine, tributylamine, diisopropylamine, diisopropylethylamine, tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide, benzyltrialkyi ammonium hydroxide, tetraalkyl ammonium hydroxide or mixtures thereof. Preferably, the basic catalyst is selected from the group consisting of triethylamine and tributylamine. Most preferably, the basic catalyst is triethylamine.<br><br>
The carboxylic acid, alkylene oxide, solvent and basic catalyst can be charged to the reactor zone separately or mixed in any combination. Preferably, the basic catalyst and ethylene oxide are added in the presence of the carboxylic acid. For the reactor zone, there are no special limitations in the form of construction thereof. However, the reactor zone is subject to an arrangement that allows contact of the alkylene oxide, carboxylic acid, solvent and basic catalyst at the given process conditions. Generally the reactor zone comprises at least one reactor. Preferably, the reactor zone comprises a plug flow reactor where the ending temperature is about 180°C to about 280°C in order to obtain high reaction rates and near complete conversion of ethylene oxide. Side products such as diethylene glycol(DEG), may be controlled by addition of small amounts of water, and water may be used to insure complete reaction of the ethylene oxide.<br>
The reaction of the carboxylic acid, akylene oxide, solvent, and basic catalyst in the reactor zone is conducted at a temperature of about 120°C to about 280°C. Preferably, the reaction is conducted at a temperature of about 180°C to about 280°C. Generally, the reaction is conducted at a pressure of about 100 psi to about 1500 psi. Preferably, the reaction is conducted at a pressure of about 300 psi to about 1500 psi. Most preferably the reaction is conducted at a pressure of about 500 psi to about 1200 psi. In a preferred embodiment of this invention, the reactor zone comprises at least one reactor operated at a pressure such that a<br><br>
substantial portion of the alkylene oxide is in liquid phase. Substantial portion is defined as 90 wt%.<br>

In the embodiment when the alkylene oxide is ethylene oxide and the carboxylic acid is terephthalic acid and the solvent is toluene, the triethylamine is present in a concentration of about 0.5 to about 5 percent by weight based on the weight of the terephthalic acid. Preferably, the triethylamine is present in a concentration of about 1 to about 5 percent by weight. Most preferably, the triethylamine is present in a concentration of about 1 to about 3 percent by weight. In this embodiment the partially esterified carboxylic acid product is known as a partially esterified terephthalic acid product. The conversion of terephthalic acid to a partially terephthalic acid product is defined as the percent conversion of the acid groups in the terephthalic acid to ester groups. Typically, the conversion is between about 8% to about 60%. Preferably, the conversion is about 30% to about 50%. Most preferably, the conversion is about 40% to about 50%.<br>
The partially esterified carboxylic acid product can be subsequently used to produce a polyester product. This can be accomplished by transferring the partially esterified carboxylic acid product to a conventional<br><br>
type polyester process where esterification and oligomerization can be continued. As used herein, "conventional" process or apparatus with respect to polyester processing refers to a non-pipe reactor or process, including, but not limited to, a continuous stirred tank reactor (CSTR) process or apparatus, a reactive distillation, stripper, or rectification column process or apparatus, or tank with internals, screw, or kneader process or apparatus.

Step (b) can be conducted in one of more stages and can be completed with ethylene glycol added. Suitable catalysts and additives can also be added prior to or during polycondensation. Typical catalysts are compounds containing antimony(lll) or titanium (IV). The ethylene glycol<br><br>
that is not reacted into the polyester product can be recycled to an earlier part of the process.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
This invention can be further illustrated by the following examples of preferred embodiments thereof, although it will be understood that these examples are included merely for purposes of illustration and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention unless otherwise specifically indicated.<br>
Example 1: Use of Different Basic Catalyst:<br>
Toluene (400g), terephthalic acid (40 g) and a basic catalyst were added to a one liter Hastelloy autoclave. The autoclave was purged and pressurized to 100 psi with nitrogen. The autoclave was heated to 260°C, and the pressure was then adjusted to 500 psi with nitrogen. Ethylene oxide (11.5 g) was added at one time to the autoclave from another pressure vessel which was maintained at 700 psi of nitrogen. The temperature of the reaction was maintained at 260°C for 30 minutes to produce the partially esterified terephthalic acid product. Then the partially esterified TPA product was cooled to ambient temperature. The resulting partially esterified product was filtered and the solid esterified TPA was weighed. The conversions for each of the examples are given in the Table 1 and were measured by 1H NMR. A 50% conversion of terephthalic acid would mean approximately a 100% yield based on ethylene oxide.<br><br>
(Table Removed)<br>
The choice of basic catalyst has a significant effect on the conversion of the TPA. The best catalyst for this process would be the one that gives the best conversion while providing a product with low DEG and low b*. The b* is one of the three-color attributes measured on a spectroscopic reflectance-based instrument. A Hunter Ultrascan XE instrument is typically the measuring device. Positive readings signify the degree of yellowness (or absorbance of blue light), while negative readings signify the degree of blueness.<br>
In general, the tertiary amines (triethylamine, triphenylamine, triethanolamine, diisopropyethyleamine, trimethylamine, tributylamine, and dimethyldodecylamine) in the examples above under these conditions give<br>
the best results. However, within these, there are clear differences. Trimethylamine, the least hindered amine gives the highest conversion, but also gives high color and DEG. Diisopropylethylamine, the most hindered amine in the group, gives very low conversion and high DEG. Triethanolamine, a hydroxyl-containing amine, also gives high color and DEG. The weakest base of this group, triphenylamine, gives almost no conversion. The moderately hindered aliphatic tertiary amines, triethylamine, tributylamine and dimethyldodecylamine, gave the best results with triethylamine being the best overall catalyst under these conditions. The unhindered primary amine, benzylamine, gave reasonable conversion, but had very high DEG, and the hindered secondary amine, diisopropyamine, gave poor conversion. The tertiary ammonium hydroxide base, benzyltrimethylammonium hydroxide, gave good conversion, but relatively high DEG, It appears that the successful catalyst here has to be moderately hindered and fairly basic to give the desired properties of high conversion, low DEG and low b*.<br>
Example 2: PET Oligomer prepared and converted to polymer<br>
Terephthalic acid (60 g), toluene (600 g) and triethylamine (1.8 g) were added to a one liter Hastelloy autoclave. The autoclave was purged and pressurized to 500 psi with nitrogen. The autoclave was heated to 200°C, and the pressure was then adjusted to 1500 psi with nitrogen. Ethylene oxide (15.7 g) was added at one time to the autoclave from<br>
another pressure vessel which was maintained at 1700 psi of nitrogen. The temperature of the reaction was maintained at 200°C for 30 minutes and cooled to ambient temperature. A solid esterified TPA was recovered by filtration. Table 2 shows the yield, conversion, b* and mol %DEG of the oligomer formation.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
A second example using Sb as the catalyst was completed using the same stages as shown in Table 3.   Antimony oxide was dissolved in EG (3 g) and added to the oligomer. The antimony concentration in the polymer was<br>
calculated to be 250 ppm. Polyethylene terephthalate was produced having the properties shown in Table 4.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Clearly, a high inherent viscosity(IV) PET can be prepared from the partially esterified TPA product produced with ethylene oxide.<br>
Example 3: Using Different Temperatures, Pressures And amounts of Et3N:<br>
Toluene (400g), terephthalic acid (40 g) and triethylamine were added to a one liter Hastelloy autoclave. The autoclave was purged and pressurized to with nitrogen. The autoclave was heated to the specified temperature and the pressure was increased to the desired level. Ethylene oxide (about 11.5 g) was added at one time to the autoclave from another pressure vessel. The reaction temperature was maintained for 30 minutes and then the autoclave cooled to ambient temperature. The resulting partially esterified TPA product stream was filtered and the solid was weighed. The conversions for each of the examples are given in the table below.<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Good conversions of esterified TPA were obtained in this entire range of 150-260°C, 1-3 wt% triethylamine, and 500-1500 psi. The highest conversion with this experiment were obtained in the range of 175-200°C. At higher triethylamine levels the percent conversion was relatively insensitive to pressure. The most desirable temperatures from the point of view of continuing to make polymer from the oligomer is in the range of 250 to 280°C because that is the common range for the early part of the PET production process.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
