				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the improvement of<br>
flavour in black tea and brewed liquor. The green leave shoots<br>
of tea bush processed by withering, rolling, fermentation and firing<br>
is referred to as bl ack tea. The brewed infusion from black tea<br>
is referred to as beverage tea.<br>
The quality of tea could not be heretobefore ascertained with much<br>
precision due to lack of knowledge on the processing technology and<br>
consequently therefore the improvement of flavour of the tea by<br>
modifications in the processing technology was not known in the art.<br>
However, extensive research in the field of process optimisation<br>
during manufacturing have demonstrated that leaf withered for about<br>
20 h at controlled humidity and oxygen saturated atmosphere of 20-<br>
25 cfm per kg. of green leaves were superior to those manufactured<br>
from fresh harvest. It has generally been accepted that more rapid<br>
air circulation will increase dessication and reduce respiration loss<br>
of stored leaf shoots. Low oxygen and high carbon dioxide levels<br>
which is detrimental to quality of tea could be avoided by proper<br>
ventilation in the factory layout. Post harvest quality of black tea<br>
depends on physiological age of tea shoots, withering time,<br>
temperature, humidity, the type of mechanical injury and conditions<br>
of fermentation, etc.. So long black tea manufacture is a batch<br>
process suggesting that technology and determination of quality are<br>
not unique. Furthermore, value added tea is expected to serve for<br>
an improved product likely to have additional market. This would<br>
result in the production of flavoured teas and bottled teas for<br>
perspective buyers.<br>
Characteristics of various varieties of tea flavour for the genuineness<br>
of the beverage is now known. It has also been estimated that<br>
the orthodox tea grown in hilly regions contains a three times higher<br><br>
amount of volatiles than does plain region orthodox tea. Moreover,<br>
the content of monoterpene alcohols is about five times higher in<br>
tea grown in hilly region as compared to tea grown in plain region.<br>
Records of volatiles and non-volatile flavoury compounds clearly<br>
indicate that biosynthetic as well as degradative reactions in the<br>
lipid fractions of the tea leaf shoots are mostly responsible for<br>
flavour of tea.<br>
Polyphenols such as catechins as also caffeine are important for<br>
contributing to bitterness and astringency property of tea. The com-<br>
ponents of essential oil in fresh leaves and volatile compounds<br>
developed during the manufacturing process form the characteristic<br>
tea flavour and aroma.<br>
Browning is the most characteristic reaction that take place during<br>
fermentation process of black tea manufacturing. Presence of important<br>
phenolic compounds found to be in the following portions :<br>
Catechins 5%, theaflavin 1-2%, thearubigin 15%. Theaflavins are bright<br>
orange in colour and formed by oxidation of catechins by polyphenol-<br>
oxidase during fermentation. Thearubigins are complex formed from<br>
polyphenols and proteins and are dark reddish in colour. Theaflavins<br>
contribute to the quality and brightness of the colour of black tea<br>
liquor, but mout feel is due to the heterogeneous thearubigins.<br>
Further such typical chemical flavour constituents/or essential oils<br>
extracted from black teas, species teas/or herbal teas and from<br>
may fruits and spices were reported to be similar. The compounds<br>
included are linalool derivatives, aliphatic and aromatic aldehydes,<br>
alcohols, etc.. In tea grade, it is also customary to blend and<br>
and recondition teas for better taste quality of consumers.<br>
However, the process of withering known in the tea industry have<br>
been found to play a vital role in improvement of flavour of tea<br>
in so far as that the process of withering and rolling is accompanied<br><br>
by release of flavoury compound from non -volatile precursors. It<br>
is of importance to note that the higher content of fresh and floral<br>
notes has been attributed to hydrolytic action of various enzymes<br>
and subsequent release of essential and characteristic aroma and<br>
flavours is amply highlighted. The present invention is the outcome<br>
of a modification in the processing technology in so far as the<br>
direction of utilising the release of flavour in the process of<br>
withering and rolling of tea leaves is concerned. The present<br>
invention utilises processing conditions alongwith additional flavoury<br>
compounds such as carotenes and essential oils to the advantage<br>
for imparting an added flavour to the black tea and/or the brewed<br>
liquor.<br>
It is thus an object of this invention to provide for a process for<br>
the improvement in the flavour of black tea or brewed liquor by<br>
utilising the process extrudes of tea processing technology.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide for a method of<br>
improvement in the f lavour of tea by a process that would be less<br>
expensive as compared to the improvement that the flavour renders<br>
to the quality of tea.<br>
Another object of this invention is to provide for an improvement<br>
in the product quality of black tea and/or brewed liquor.<br>
Another object of this invention is to utilise the withering conditions<br>
of tea manufacture to the advantage in so far as improvement in<br>
flavour and quality of tea is concerned. This objective is directed<br>
to assure aroma and flavour quality of such tea/beverages by proper<br>
analysis of volatile and non-volatile compounds.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for a<br>
process of manufacturing consumer acceptable value added teaa (other<br>
than traditional black tea/or brewed liquor).<br><br>
A further object of the present invention is directed towards<br>
providing technical know-how for manufacturing flavoury teas in a<br>
continuous process by oscillated withering and efficient damage of<br>
leaf cells by CTC methods.<br>
The method of the invention discloses a process for improvement<br>
in flavour of tea and/or breewed liquor by controlled withering of<br>
the tea leaves/shoots comprising :-<br>
i) spreading said leaf shoots on withering trough;<br>
ii) passing a slow drought of warm air, preferably maintaining a<br>
hygrometric difference of about 3 -4 C between the inlet and outlet<br>
end of the warm air in said trough;<br>
iii) processing said leaf shoots for atleast 8 hours by conventional<br>
CTC techniquess;<br>
iv) fermenting the process leaf shoots and subsequnetly firing at<br>
higher temperature for drying; said process stages consisting of<br>
withering to firing being controlled preferably in the temperature<br>
range of 32 C to 90 C with optional addition of flavoury compounds<br>
such as herein described at anyone of the following stages :-<br>
a)	during said withering and rolling;<br>
b)	after said CTC processing;<br><br>
c)	prior to said step of firing at the end of the fermentation<br>
depending upon the required colour and flavour of tea; and<br>
d)	during CTC processing or while conventional reconditioning of<br>
tea.<br>
The process of the invention thus takes into consideration the higher<br>
content of fresh and floral notes attributive to the hydrolytic action<br>
of various enzymes and the subsequent release of essential and<br>
characteristic volatile flavours. The present invention suggests an<br>
improvement in the quality of tea produced by adjustment in the<br><br>
withering conditions during manufacturing of the harvested leaf<br>
shoots. The present invention further discloses a process by which<br>
an improvement in the product quality of the tea can be achieved<br>
even without the use of any foreign chemicals for such improvement<br>
in flavour by suitable modifications in the withering condition.<br>
It has been found that the flavour of teas is basically attributed<br>
to the high ratio of terpenoids to non-terpenoids. In normal<br>
withering conditions where differenciation can be made by nose from<br>
fresh leaf and withered leaf where conditions providing terpenoids<br>
were retained better than those in over withered conditions.<br>
Terpenoid to non-terpenoid ratios is therefore higher in normal<br>
withered manufactured teas than those in over withered teas. It is<br>
such ratio of the terpenoid to non-terpenoid contained after the<br>
withering of the tea leaves that can determine the flavour of the<br>
final product. The storage time for effecting such chemical withering<br>
for improvement in flavour of tea was about 8-12 hours if little<br>
heat is applied alongwith air flow.<br>
In the present invention, the process for improvement in flavour<br>
of tea and/or brewed liquor is attributed to the fact that by a<br>
controlled withering process, the constituents of the tea is varied<br>
to a desired proportion by suitable conversion of the constituents<br>
of the leaf shoots into characteristic flavoury compounds by<br>
controlled hydrolytic action. In this regard, the present invention<br>
proceeds for a suitable temperature range within which the process<br>
of withering till firing may be controlled. Also, the process of the<br>
invention takes into consideration alongwith the withering temperature<br>
the hygrometric difference between incoming and outgoing warm air<br>
passed through the withering trough for the purpose of withering<br>
and cooled air during rolling and fermentation under high humid<br>
conditions of the tea leaves.<br><br>
The non-terpenoids consisted mainly of fatty acid mostly alkenals<br>
and alkenols etc . The terpenoids on the other hand are mainly<br>
linalool and their oxides.<br>
Apart from such terpenoid to non-terpenoid ratio, other factors that<br>
contribute towards colour and flavour of black tea are beta-carotene,<br>
lutein, violaxanthine and neoxanthine which are the major carotenoids<br>
of tea. Although a decrease is seen in all these four carotenoids<br>
during processing, only beta-carotene and lutein mostly undergo<br>
oxidative changes during withering into characteristic volatile<br>
flavoury compounds of tea. Some important character imparting<br>
compounds of black tea, such as geranylacetone, damascenones, beta-<br>
cyclocitral, theaspirone and dihydroactinidiolide, etc. (about 10%<br>
of total volatiles) are supposed to be the degraded products of<br>
carotenoids.<br>
Characteristic flavoury volatile compounds like linalool and geraniol<br>
also occurring as clycosides becomes free during withering, rolling<br>
etc stages of tea manufacture.<br>
The production of flavour volatiles especially linalool derivatives<br>
is considerably accelerated due to slight higher withering<br>
temperature of leaf shoots compared to air.<br>
The volatile n-hexenal, trans-2-hexenal, 1-genten-3-01, etc. are<br>
formed from the fatty acids released from linolenic, linoleic and<br>
palmitic acids. The impact of green flavour due to alkenals,<br>
alkenols, etc. essential but more pronounced when fresh tea leaf<br>
is processed for black tea. The presence of higher amounts of trans-<br>
2-hexenal and depression of linalool is found to be one of the<br>
reasons why unwithered tea is less fragrant than withered tea.<br>
However, improvement in the unwithered tea can be brought about<br>
by spraying of flavoury compounds and/or aromatic plants/herbs<br><br>
thereby improving the flavour of tea. The addition of natural flavour<br>
volatiles of ginger, lemonpeel, cinnamon bark and leaf have been<br>
considerable significance as natural flavour additives.<br>
A particular working example of the process for improvement of<br>
black tea and brewed liquor as supposed to be disclosed by way<br>
of the present invention is discussed hereunder :-<br>
EXAMPLES IDENTIFYING PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS OF THE PROCESS<br>
OF THE INVENTION<br>
Fresh leaf shoots are plucked and sprayed in a six inch thick layer<br>
on a withering trough; a slow drought of warm air at about 30oC<br>
was passed over said spreaded leaves maintaining a hygrometric<br>
difference of 2 C between the inlet and outlet end of said trough<br>
during the passage of warm air ppassed therethrough;<br>
processing said leaf shoots for 8 hours by conventional CTC<br>
techniques;<br>
fermenting by conventional means - the thuus processed leaf shoots<br>
and subsequent firing at 90oC for drying (approximately 90oC).<br>
The leaf shoots thus processed were found to have additional flavour<br>
and aroma content not known in the processes presently known in<br>
the art.<br>
Further to the said processing steps carried on, additional further<br>
improvement in the aroma and flavour content during such improved<br>
processing of leaf shoots can be attained by following any one of<br>
the optional roots of adding aroma/f lavoury constituents during the<br>
processing of the leaf shoots as detailed hereunder :-<br>
(a) About 30 kgs. of freshly plucked tea leaves were divided into<br>
three lots and spread over a" withering trough, air was blown at<br>
773 ft3/min for a period of 6,8, and 10h, and hygrometric difference<br>
was maintained at about 60 F. In a separate lot, 5 kgs. of green<br><br>
leaf shoots was placed on a hasslan cloth for natural withering for<br>
about 24h. After withering, the leaves from each lot were rolled<br>
separately in a Little Ciant Roller for 30 mins. and then passed<br>
through the CTC machine three times.<br>
(b)	Another 15 kgs. of withered leaves was divided into three lots<br>
and passed through the CTC machine after mixing with 0, 2% and<br>
4% (W/W) lemon peels and then fermented for 1 hr. 20 mins.. The<br>
fermentation was stopped by heating for 30 mins. with a blast of<br>
hot air at 180-210 F to obtain black tea with 3% moisture content.<br>
(c)	In a specific embodiment,	1 kg. of the withered and rolled<br>
leaf shoots were additionally	treated by spraying of 1 gm. of an<br>
aqueous of beta-carotene and	fermented in the usual manner. The<br>
colour and flavour profile of	such tea were found to be superior<br>
to the conventionally processed	tea.<br>
(d)	110 cc of extract solution of flavoury compounds comprising of<br>
cinnamon leaf/cinnamon bark/ginger in the proportion of 0.1 mg.<br>
percent was sprayed thoroughly on 5 kgs. of black tea leaf as<br>
processed by the method of the invention just after fermentation<br>
and allowed to dry in a conventional manner, the flavour and aroma<br>
content of the black tea thus produced was found to be of superior<br>
quaIity.<br>
(e)	5 gms. of tejpat (cinnamon leaf containing 80% eugenol) was<br>
boiled with water and the extract sprayed over	600	gms.	of<br>
fermented tea processed by the method of the invention. The product<br>
showed improved flavour content.<br>
(f)	Raw cinnamon leaf, cinnamon bark, lemon peel, ginger of about<br>
1% dry weight were blended during CTC processing of the leaf shoots<br>
as per the present invention,	the	product	obtained	showed<br>
improvement in genuine flavour and aroma content.<br><br>
Further, the present invention also provides for improvement in<br>
colour and flavour profile of black tea by spraying on the withered<br>
rolled plucked leaves beta-carotenes in water with subsequent<br>
fermentation of the same. The product obtained by the process has<br>
a quality wherein the percentage of total organic soluble solids,<br>
caffeins and minerals (ash, amino acid contents) were significantly<br>
more in adequately withered leaves within the fresh shoot moved<br>
teas. The withering process under conventional techniques are<br>
disadvantageous in that the crude fibre does not appear to get<br>
solubilized adequately into phenolic acids thereby affecting '.he<br>
organoleptic properties as well as brewed tea. A higher amount of<br>
linalool and decreased amount of hexanals were characteristics of<br>
good flavoury teas made from withered leaves and carotenes spread<br>
teas. The biogenesis of aroma compound during processing enhanced<br>
the quality of brewed tea.<br>
Additionally, the present invention also discloses that addition of<br>
essential oils (ppm level) from fresh aromatic plants and herbs such<br>
as cinnamon leaf, lemon peel, jasmin flower, etc. were shown to<br>
have improved flavour quality of black teas especially in monsoon<br>
seasons. It is to be noted that a process of the invention involves<br>
optional addition of aqueous solutions of flavoury compounds such<br>
as beta-carotenoids, solicyclic acids, cinnamaldehyde, etc. by<br>
spraying the same over the leaf shoots at any one of the following<br>
stages of processing :-<br>
a) during rolling; b) after CTC cuts; c) prior to the step of firing<br>
at the end of the fermentation and d) during CTC processing/recon-<br>
ditioning stages of tea manufacturing depending upon the required<br>
colour and flavour of tea.<br>
Furthermore, ambiguous assessment of the overall quality of black<br>
tea and brewed liquor by testing panels have been serving the<br><br>
industry but the actual way of assessing is by applied sensory<br>
method where the effect of chemical/attributes are being evaluated<br>
during sensory organs.	Thus, alternate means of bio-chemical<br>
assessment have been used while optimising manufacturing processes<br>
of black tea.<br>
It may be mentioned that various other embodiments of the process<br>
in so far as applying optional foreign additives during the process<br>
of manufacturing of improved flavour tea of the present invention<br>
would be possible without deviating from the scope and spirit of<br>
the present invention.<br><br>
