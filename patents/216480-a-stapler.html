				<td>Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a stapler, in which the stapling operation can be performed by driving a staple through sheets of paper, etc., with a comparatively small force.<br>
Related Art<br>
Staplers are known without the need of listing a specific example. Atypical stapler includes three members, i.e., an operation frame, a staple magazine and a base frame which are all pivotally attached together at their rear ends.    In operation, the staples stored in the staple magazine are pressed against a staple receiving board, which is disposed at the front end of the base frame and driven, one by one, into sheets of paper by means of a staple pressure lower piece, which is disposed at the front end of the operation frame.    In order to facilitate this stapling operation in a stapler of the known construction through the operation frame, a handle frame is disposed at the outer side of the operation frame.    This handle frame is provided at an intermediate part of its rear end in the back and forth direction of the handle frame with a pin.    This pin is brought into engagement with a slot which is formed in an intermediate part of the operation frame so that the handle frame is linked to the operation frame. At the time of stapling operation achieved by pressing the front end of the<br><br>
handle frame, the control frame is pivotally rotated under the effect of lever action serving the pin part as a point of action.    Owing to this construction, the pressing force to the front end side of the handle frame is exhibited greatly on the operation frame side and therefore, the driving operation (stapling operation) of the staple can be performed with a comparatively small force (for example, see Japanese Patent Apphcation Laid-Open No. 2002-28877).<br>
However, the above-mentioned conventional techniques have the following problems.    Since the operation frame is pivotally rotated by moving the pin, which is disposed at the handle frame side, through the slot, which is formed at the operation frame side, the pin and the edge part of the slot are mutually pressed against each other and deformed.    This deformation causes the pressing force applied to the staple to be reduced, thus resulting in deterioration of the original function which the stapler inherently has.<br>
The present invention has been accomplished in view of the above problems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is, therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a unique stapler which is capable of obviating the above-mentioned problems and in which stapling operation can be performed by driving a staple through sheets of paper, etc., with a comparatively small force.<br>
To achieve the above object, according to the present invention, there is provided a stapler comprising a base frame, a support element<br><br>
erected from a rear end of the base frame, an operation frame pivotally attached at a rear end part thereof directly or indirectly to the support element through a main shaft, a staple pressure lower plate disposed at the operation frame, and the staple pressure lower plate being lowered to drive staples stored in a staple magazine, one by one, between the operation frame and the base frame in accordance with rotation of the operation frame so that sheets of paper sandwichingly retained between the base frame and a staple receiving board are stapled, the stapler further comprising a handle frame disposed at an upper part of the operation frame and pivotally attached at a rear end part thereof to the support element such that the rear end part is located at an upper part of the main shaft, and an intermediate element one end of which is pivotally attached to an intermediate part in the back and forth direction of the handle frame and the other end of which is pivotally attached to the operation frame.<br>
The above and other objects, characteristic features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art by the following description of the preferred embodiment of the invention, as illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be described in detail with reference to the accompanying drawings.<br>
In a first preferred embodiment of FIGS. 1 through 6, reference numeral 1 denotes a base frame which is provided at a front end thereof with a staple receiving board 2 and at a rear end.    A pair of support elements la are erected from a rear end of the base frame 1 in such a manner as to oppose to each other.    A staple magazine 4 and an operation frame 5 are pivotally attached at rear ends thereof to the support elements la through a main shaft 3, and a handle frame 6 is pivotally attached at a rear end thereof to the support elements la through support shafts 7 which are disposed at an upper part of the main shaft 3.<br>
A paper receiving frame 8, which has an element 8a disposed at a rear end thereof and assembled to the base frame 1, is assembled to the rear<br><br>
end of the base frame 1 such that a front end of the paper receiving frame 8 is elevated about the element 8a as its fulcrum.    A vertical hole 10 is formed at a front end of the paper receiving frame 8,    The staple receiving board 2, which is disposed at the base frame 1 and provided at an upper surface thereof with a staple guide groove 2a, is engaged with the vertical hole 10.    Afirst spring 11 is disposed at the front side, which is on the side of the staple receiving board 2, of the paper receiving frame 8, so that the front ends of the base frame 1 and the paper receiving frame 8 are biased in a mutually separating and opening direction, i.e., in a direction toward which the front end of the paper receiving frame 8 is moved upward. Owing to this arrangement, as shown in FIG. 1, when no pressing action is acted on the paper receiving frame 8 by the staple magazine 4, the guide groove 2a part of the staple receiving board 2 is located at an intermediate position of the vertical groove 10.<br>
Reference numeral 12 denotes a regulation frame which is engaged with and assembled to the base frame 1 at a lower side of the paper receiving frame 8.    The regulation frame 12 is biased by a second spring 13, which is interposed between the rear end of the regulation frame 12 and the element 8a on the rear end side of the paper receiving frame 8, so that the frame element 12a on the front end side is located immediately under a front end element 8b of the paper receiving frame 8 so as to bear and regulate the downward movement of the front end element 8b.<br>
The regulation frame 12 includes a pair of erection elements 12b which are opposed to each other through the rear end of the paper receiving frame 8.    Aprojection element 14 disposed at the erection element 12b is<br><br>
engaged with a slanted slot 16 which is formed at a leg element 15a of a linkage member 15.    The projection element 14 is pressed by the edge part of the slanted slot 16 at the time of downward movement of the regulation frame 12 along the projection element 14 engaged with the slanted slot 16, and the regulation frame 12 is moved backward against the biasing force of the second spring 13.    As a result, the frame element 12a of the regulation frame 12 is escaped from the front end element 8b of the paper receiving frame 8.<br>
The linkage member 15 is fixed to the staple magazine 4 with its generally groove-like main frame 15Aholding an intermediate part of the staple magazine 4,    The leg element 15a is projected from the underside of the main frame 15A, and the projection element 14 is engaged with the slanted slot 16 so that the main frame 15A is linked to the regulation frame 12.    The main frame 15Ais provided at a rear end of its upper side with a pressure receivmg element 15b projecting from the upper edge of the staple magazine 4.    The pressm-e receiving element 15b includes an arcuate front edge 15b".    Apresser rod 17, which is disposed at an intermediate part of the operation frame 5, is moved downward along the front edge 15b".    At that time, the presser rod 17 presses the front edge 15b".    As a result, the linkage member 15 provided with the pressure receiving element 15b is moved downward.    Then, due to engagement between the projection element 14 and the slanted slot 16, the regulation frame 12 is moved backward against the biasing force of the second spring 13 in the manner as previously mentioned.<br>
The staple magazine 4 is of the known construction (but of course.<br><br>
different from the present one in the respect that the linkage member 15 is assembled to the intermediate part) in which the staple is fed into an outlet port 19    formed at its front end by a press feeding element 18 which is slidingly fitted thereto, and a gap formed between the staple magazine 4 and the base frame 1 is retained by a return spring 20 which is interposed between the rear part of the staple magazine 4 and the rear part of the base frame 1.    The operation frame 5 is of the known construction comprising a main frame 5A provided at its front end with a staple pressure lower plate<br>
21	and an auxiliary frame 5B disposed at the inner side of the main frame<br>
5A, a second return spring 22 having a stronger spring property than the<br>
return spring 20 being interposed between the main frame 5A and the<br>
auxiliary frame 5B.    The presser rod 17 for press contacted with the front<br>
end edge 15b" of the pressure receiving element 15b of the linkage member<br>
15 disposed at the staple magazme 4 side is mounted on the intermediate<br>
part of the main frame 5 A, and one end of the intermediate element 22 is<br>
pivotally assembled by serving this presser rod 17 as a pivot.<br>
The intermediate element 22 is formed by connecting side elements<br>
22	a to the center element 22b in such a maimer as oppose to each other.<br>
One ends of the side elements 22a is pivotally attached to the operation<br>
frame 5 through the presser rod 17 in the manner as previously mentioned<br>
with the intermediate part of the operation frame 5 (main frame 5A)<br>
interposed between the side elements 22a, and the other ends of the side<br>
elements 22a is disposed backward and upward (at the time of use as a<br>
stapler) of the presser rod 17, and the rear ends (basal ends) are interposed<br>
between the side elements 6b of the handle frame 6, which is pivotally<br><br>
attached to an upper part of the support element la of the base frame 1 through the support shaft 7.<br>
The handle frame 6 comprises a center element 6a and a pair of side elements 6b which are opposed to each other in the longitudinal direction (back and forth direction) with the center element 6a disposed therebetween.    Rear ends (basal ends) of the side elements 6b are pivotally attached to the corresponding support elements la of the base frame 1 through support shafts 7 which are coaxially arranged and carried on an intermediate element 22 which is interposed between the intermediate part and the operation frame 5 with their intermediate parts slanted backward and upward.    The front ends of the side elements 6b are located in such a manner as to be separated from the operation frame 5.<br>
When the front end of the handle frame 6 is pressed downward in the direction of the base frame 1 about the support shafts 7, the handle frame 6 presses downward the presser rod 17 through the pivot 23 and the intermediate element 22.    Since the presser rod 17 is attached to the main frame 5Aof the operation frame 5, the main frame 5A tends to tumingly move downward about the main shaft 3.    However, the first spring 11 is smaller in spring property than the second return sprmg 13, the operation frame 6 including the main frame 5 A and the staple magazine 4 are tumingly moved downward about the main shaft before the main frame 5A is moved downward alone    Simultaneous with this turning downward movement, the linkage member 15 disposed at the staple magazine 4 is also moved downward and the slanted slot 16 part formed at the leg element 15a of the linkage member 15 is also moved downward.    The slanted slot 16<br><br>
part presses the projection element 14 with a pre-designed angle of inclination.    The regulation frame 12 provided with the projection element 14 is moved backward against the biasing force of the second spring 13, and a clearance is formed immediately under the front end element 8b of the paper receiving frame 8.    In that condition, the front end side of the staple magazine 4 pressed down by the presser rod 17 presses down the paper recei\"ing frame 8, and the front end side of the paper receiving frame 8 is moved downward against the biasing force of the first spring 11, so that the guide groove 2a part of the staple receiving board 2 disposed at the base frame 1 is relatively projected to the upper end position of the vertical hole 10 of the paper receiving frame 8.    By means of the continuous turning operation of the handle frame 6 about the support shaft 7, the turning downward movement of the staple magazine 4 which is press contacted with the paper receiving frame 8 is regulated, and at the same time, the operation frame 5 continues to turn about the main shaft 3 and move downward against the biasing force of the second return spring 20. As a result, the staple pressure lower plate 21 drives out the staple stored in the staple magazine 4 through the outlet port 19, and presses the staple penetrated through the sheets of paper sandwichingly held between the paper receiving frame 8 and the staple magazine 4 against the staple receiving board 2, so that the staple is folded in a horizontal posture.    By doing so, the stapling operation of the sheets of paper is conducted,    in a series of this operation, by pressing down the front end side of the handle frame 6 in the direction of the base frame 1 where the staple magazine 4, etc. are interposed, the handle frame 6 is turned about the support shaft 7<br><br>
on the rear end (basal end) side as a fulcrum.    This pressing down (turning) operation is exhibited at the pivot 23 part as a point of action. By this so-called principle of a lever, a small pressing force given to the handle frame 6 is exhibited as a large press-down force applicable to the operation frame 5, etc.    This makes it possible to perform the stapling operation easily.<br>
FIG. 6 shows a state in which staples are loaded in the staple magazine 4.    In that state, the pivot 23 of the handle frame 6 is engaged with the concave groove 24 formed at the upper surface of the operation frame 5 so that the turning of the handle frame 6 about the support shaft 7 is regulated.<br>
In the illustration, reference numeral 26 denotes a resin cover of the base frame 1, and 26" denotes a resin cover of the handle frame 6.<br>
In the first preferred embodiment shown in FIGS. 1 through 6, the present invention is applied to a portable stapler.    In the second preferred embodiment shown in FIGS. 7 and 8, the present invention is applied to a desktop stapler.    In this second preferred embodiment, a pair of large and small support elements 81a, 81a" are erected in opposing relation at the rear end side of a base frame 81 which is provided with a staple receiving board 80,    A support frame 83 is pivotally attached at a rear end thereof to the rear side small support element 81a" through a first main shaft 82, and an operation frame 84 is pivotally attached at a rear end thereof to an intermediate upper location of the support frame 83 through a second main shaft 82",    The handle frame 86 is pivotally attached at a rear end thereof to the upper end part of the large support element 81a through a support<br><br>
shaft 85 which is located at an upper part of the first and second main shafts 82, 82".<br>
As shown, the support element 81a is disposed at an intermediate position in the back and forth direction of the base frame 81, and the support shaft 85 to which the handle frame 86 is assembled is disposed at a location offset to the center in the back and forth direction of the base frame 81, so that the pressing load generated at the time of turning operation of the handle frame 86 about the support frame 85 is received by the center side of the base frame 81.    By doing so, the movement of the base frame 81 is regulated so that the turning operation can be performed without interference.<br>
The support frame 83 is retained in its horizontal posture by a first return spring 87 which is interposed between the support frame 83 and the base frame 81 at the rear end of the support frame 83, and a staple magazine 88 is assembled to its undersurface side such that the staple magazine 88 can be withdrawn forwardly of the support frame 83 at the time of loading the staples.    A staple pressure lower plate 89, which is brought into and out of a staple outlet port (not shown) of the staple magazine 88, is disposed immediately above the staple outlet port.<br>
The staple pressure lower plate 89 is fixedly attached to a pressure lower plate holder 89A which is supported by movably (relatively) fitting a pin 91 in an arcuate cutout 90 formed at the operation frame 84.    The pressure lower plate holder 89A allows a guide pin 94, which is supported on an upper end on the front end side of the support frame 83, to penetratingly engaged with a vertical long slot 93 formed at an intermediate<br><br>
part thereof, so that the pressure lower plate holder 89A can vertically move at a predetermined position.    When the operation frame 84 is turned about the second support shaft 82" as a fulcrum against a second return spring 95 (having a larger resilient force than the first return spring 87) which is interposed between the support frame 83 and the operation frame 84, the edge part of the arcuate cutout 90 presses down the pin 91 while moving along the pin 91.    As a result, the holder 89A is moved downward and at the same time, the staple pressure lower plate 89 is moved downward to drive out the staple stored in the staple magazine 88.<br>
The operation frame 84 is formed by arranging an auxiliary frame 84B which comprises side elements 84B" connected in such a manner as to oppose the center elements 84B" at the inner side of a main frame 84A which comprises side elements 84A" connected in such a maimer as to oppose to the center elements 84A" and fixedly attaching the center elements A", 84B" to each other.    The side elements 84" of the auxiliary frame 84B are provided with the arcuate cutout 90 and linked to the pressure lower plate holder 89A or the staple pressure lower plate 89 through the pin 91, and the other end of the second return spring 95 whose one end is locked to the pressure receiving element 96 disposed at the operation frame 84 is lockingly attached to the center element 84B" part.<br>
In such a manner as to interposing the intermediate part of the upper part of the support frame 83 between one ends of the side elements 84A" of the operation frame main frame 84A, the one end pivotally attached to the support frame 83 through the second support shaft 82" in a maimer as previously mentioned.    One end an intermediate element 97 is pivotally<br><br>
attached to the other end part which corresponds to the one end as a pivot part through a connection shaft 98.<br>
The intermediate element 97 is formed, as in the case with the intermediate element 22 of the first preferred embodiment, by connecting the side elements 97a, 97a to the center element 97b in such a manner as to oppose to each other.    One ends of the side elements 97a are pivotally attached, in a manner as previously mentioned, to the operation frame 84 through the connection shaft 98 with the front end part of the operation frame 84 interposed between the side elements 97a, and the other ends of the side elements 97a are pivotally attached to an intermediate part between the side elements 86a of the handle frame 86 through the connection shaft 98".<br>
The handle frame 86 comprises the side elements 86a and the center element 86b to which the side elements 86a are opposed along the longitudinal direction (back and forth direction), and the rear end part i (basal end part) is pivotally attached to the upper end parts of the support elements 81a through the support shaft 85 in the manner as previously mentioned.<br>
When the front end side of the handle frame 86 is pressed down in the direction of the basal frame 81 about the support shaft 85, the handle frame 86 presses the second return spring 95 so that the operation frame 84 is tumingly moved downward about the second main shaft 82" through the intermediate element 97.    Since the first return spring 87 is smaller in spring property than the second return spring 95, the support frame 83 to which the staple magazine 88 is assembled is turned about the first main<br><br>
shaft 82 as a fulcrum under the pressure of the second return spring 95, and the front end on the outlet port side of the staple magazine 88 is moved downward to overlap with the staple receiving board 80 so that the sheets of paper as an object to be stapled are sandwichingly held therebetween. Then, by continuous press-down operation of the handle frame 86, the second return spring 95 is contracted and the operation frame 84 pressed against the intermediate element 97 is turned about the second main shaft 82" as a fulcrum.    In accordance with the turning operation of the operation frame 84, the edge part of the cutout 90 formed at the operation element 84 presses down the pin 91, and the holder 89A provided with the pin 91 is moved downward.    Then, the staple pressure lower plate 89 attached to the holder 89A is moved downward to drive out the staple stored in the staple magazine 88 so that the sheets of paper sandwichingly held between the front end of the staple magazine 88 and the staple receiving board 80 are stapled.    In a series of this operation, by pressing down the front end side of the handle frame 86 in the direction of the base frame 81 where the staple magazine 88, etc. are interposed, the handle frame 86 is turned about the support shaft 85 on the rear end (basal end) side as a fulcrum.    This pressing down (turning) operation is exhibited at the pivot part as a point of action between the front end side and the support shaft 85,    By this so-called principle of a lever, a small pressing force given to the handle frame 86 is exhibited as a large press-down force applicable to the operation frame 84, etc.    This makes it possible to perform the stapling operation more easily compared with a stapler which is provided with the operation frame having no handle frame 86.<br><br>
Since the present invention is constructed in the manner as hereinbefore described, the pressing force given to the handle frame is exhibited to the stapling operation as a large force.    Thus, the stapling operation can be performed comparatively easily.<br>
Moreover, since the pressing operation with respect to the handle frame is exhibited to the staple pressure lower plate through the linkage mechanism, a highly durable product can be provided without a need of undue force applied to the component members.<br>
Although this invention has been described in its preferred form with a certain degree of particularity, it is understood that the present disclosure of the preferred form has been made only by way of example and that numerous changes in the details of construction and arrangement of parts may be resorted to without departing from the spirit and the scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.<br><br><br>
