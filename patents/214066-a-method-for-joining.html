				<td>A METHOD FOR JOINING<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
1. Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a movable belt that may be used in a belt separation apparatus<br>
to separate a particle mixture based on charging of the particles, and more specifically to an improved<br>
belt and a method of belt construction.<br>
2. Discussion of Related Art<br>
Belt separator systems (BSS) are used to separate the constituents of particle mixtures based<br>
on the charging of the different constituents by surface contact (i.e. the triboelectriG effect). Fig. 1<br>
shows a belt separator system 10 such as is disclosed in commonly-owned US Pat Nos. 4,839,032<br>
(Indian Patent no. 172753) and 4,874,507, which are hereby incorporated by reference in their<br>
entirety. One embodiment of belt separator system 10 includes parallel spaced electrodes 12 and<br>
14/16 arranged in a longitudinal direction to define a longitudinal centreline 18, and a belt 20<br>
traveling in the longitudinal direction between the spaced electrodes, parallel to the longitudinal<br>
centreline. The belt 20 forms a continuous loop which is driven by a pair of end rollers 22, 24. A<br>
particle mixture is loaded onto the belt 20 at a feed area 26 between electrodes 14 and 16. Belt 20<br>
includes counter-current traveling belt segments 28 and 30 moving in opposite directions for<br>
transporting the constituents of the particle mixture along the lengths of the electrodes 12 and 14/16.<br>
As the only moving part, the belt 20 is a critical component of the BSS. The belt 20 moves at<br>
high speed, for example, about 40 miles an hour, in an extremely abrasive environment. The two belt<br>
segments 28, 30 move in opposite directions, parallel to centreline 18, and thus if they come into<br>
contact, the relative velocity is about 80 miles an hour. Related art belts were previously woven of<br>
abrasion resistant monofilament materials. These belts were quite expensive and lasted only about 5<br>
hours. The mode of failure was typically longitudinal wear stripes due to longitudinal wrinkling, that<br>
would wear longitudinal holes in the belt such that it would fall apart and catch on itself. The strands<br>
would also wear where they crossed and flexed in moving through the separator. The Applicant has<br>
made attempts to improve such belts with different materials and different weaves in an attempt to<br>
find a woven material with a longer life. These attempts were unsuccessful.<br>
Belts which are currently used in the BSS 10 are made of extruded materials which<br>
have better wear resistance than the woven belts and may last on the order of about 20<br>
hours. The extrusion of such belts is described in commonly-owned US Patent 5,819,946<br>
entitled "Separation System Belt Construction," which is herein incorporated by reference.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, there is illustrated schematic drawing of a section of a belt 40<br>
such as is currently used in the BSS of FIG. I. Control of the geometry of the belt is<br>
desirable, but is difficult to achieve with extruded belts.<br>
One example of the belt used in the BSS may comprise a structure formed of<br>
machine direction strands 42, i.e., strands that are disposed along a horizontal length of the<br>
belt in a direction of movement of the belt (indicated by arrow 41), and cross direction<br>
strands 46, i.e., strands that are substantially perpendicular to the machine direction<br>
strands, as illustrated in FIG. 2. The cross direction strands 46 may be made with a<br>
specific shape of a leading edge 43 of the belt The machine direction strands 46 carry the<br>
load, i.e., a mixture of constituents, and simultaneously withstand the flexing of passing<br>
over the end rollers (see FIG. 1,22,24) at a rate of approximately 6 rollers per second.<br>
The extrusion process by which belts for the BSS are currently made is necessarily<br>
a compromise of a number of factors including the choice of the polymer used, the choice<br>
of additives, the extrusion equipment, the temperatures used for the extrusion process and<br>
the extrusion rate. According to one example, the operation of the extrusion process for<br>
the current manufacture of extruded belts is as follows. A proper mix of a base polymer<br>
and additives (preferably pre-compounded together) is fed into an extrusion machine,<br>
where the mechanical action of a screws heats the material to a temperature where it is<br>
plastic, and the extrusion machine moves the plastic down a barrel and into a die. The die<br>
has a circular cross section, and has a number of grooves parallel to an axis which<br>
corresponds to the continuous machine direction strands 42. Each cross direction strand<br>
46 is produced by moving an inner part of the die so that a circumferential groove which is<br>
filled with material empties and so forms the cross direction strand 46. Control of the<br>
geometry of the belt is mostly accomplished by adjusting the instantaneous extrusion rate<br>
during the formation of each individual cross direction strand 46. Material that ends up in<br>
the cross direction strand is not available for the machine direction strand and vice versa.<br>
It may be difficult therefore, to avoid changes in the machine direction strand cross section<br>
while changing the extrusion rate to adjust the cross strand geometry. After the web of<br>
machine direction strands and cross direction strands is formed as a circular section, it is<br>
cooled, for example, through immersion in a water bath and slit and flattened to form a flat<br>
web.<br>
Fatigue strength is an important aspect of the belt to be used in a BSS. For good<br>
fatigue strength, stress concentrations at changes in cross section of the strand should be<br>
avoided. Maintaining uniformity of cross section is difficult however, and thus fatigue life<br>
of extruded belts is often problematic.<br>
Conveyer belts are widely used for conveying materials, and conventional<br>
conveying belts are well developed. Usually conveyor belts are constructed.of an<br>
elastomeric material with reinforcing cords of fabric. A usual practice is to use continuous<br>
solid belts without perforations. Such belts are not suitable for the present application<br>
because of the need for material to pass through the belt in the BSS.<br>
Control of the belt geometry is also important as is described in commonly-owned<br>
US Patent 5,904,253, also herein incorporated by reference. Referring to FIG. 3, which is<br>
an enlarged portion of the BSS of FIG. 1, the directions of the counter-travelling belt<br>
segments 28,30 are shown by arrows 34 and 36, respectively. As illustrated in FIG. 3,<br>
one example of a desired geometry of the belt 40, is that of an acute angle 44 on the<br>
leading edge 43 (see FIG. 2) of the cross direction strands 46.<br>
In the current practice of extrusion, the geometry of the leading edge is controlled<br>
by adjusting the polymer composition, the additives used, and the extrusion conditions.<br>
Changing these parameters also has effects on the other properties of the belt and on its<br>
performance in the BSS. In addition, in an extrusion process, the polymers that can be<br>
used to make such belts are limited. There are a number of polymers that cannot be<br>
extruded and so are not options for belt manufacture by extrusion. In addition, large<br>
amounts of extrusion additives are needed to achieve desired belt properties through an<br>
extrusion process. However, the presence of many additives complicates the extrusion<br>
process and can pose compatibility problems, especially for food grade applications.<br>
Many of the additives needed for dimension control also act as plasticizers and increase<br>
the rate of creep and decrease wear resjstance of the belt Often changing one property in<br>
one way will have an adverse effect on other properties.<br>
Thus known methods of manufacture of belts for BSS are subject to the limitations<br>
of the extrusion process, which limits the materials which can be used for belt<br>
construction, and compromises the geometry that can be obtained. Current belts do not<br>
have the desired long wear life, good fatigue strength, and ease of manufacture that is<br>
desired.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Certain materials, such as thermoplastic materials that contain polymerization<br>
products of at least one olefinic monomer, thermoplastics and thermoplastic elastomers are<br>
materials that have properties suited to BSS belts. One example of a potentially useful<br>
thermoplastic material is nylon, another is ultra high molecular weight polyethylene<br>
(UHMWPE). UHMWPE is one example of an excellent material which has properties<br>
that make it ideal for BSS belts. It is extremely abrasion resistant, e.g., about an order of<br>
magnitude more resistant than the next best material in similar service, it has a low<br>
coefficient of friction, is non-toxic, is an excellent dielectric, and is readily available.<br>
Unfortunately it cannot be extruded and so belts cannot be manufactured of it using known<br>
extrusion techniques.<br>
UHMWPE melts at 138 degrees Celsius. The melting point is determined optically<br>
when the opaque white material becomes completely clear. The viscosity of melted<br>
UHMWPE is so high that it does not flow when melted, and articles retain their shape<br>
even when completely melted. The extreme viscosity of UHMWPE when molten results<br>
in considerable delay in the formation of crystalline domains on cooling of the molten<br>
UHMWPE, and thus the crystallization of UHMWPE is not instantaneous. Like all<br>
polymer materials, UHMWPE has a high coefficient of thermal expansion. It also<br>
expands considerably on melting. This expansion and contraction during and after thermal<br>
cycling presents substantial difficulties in the thermal processing of UHMWPE.<br>
Conventional mold materials of construction, such as metals, have much lower thermal<br>
expansion than UHMWPE. Consequently, shrinkage during cooling of UHMWPE sets up<br>
significant thermal strains between the mold materials, UHMWPE sections at different<br>
temperatures, and even between UHMWPE sections with different degrees of crystallinity.<br>
The degree of crystallinity is a factor in determining the density and hence the volume of<br>
any particular portion of a UHMWPE part.<br>
According to one example of a method of manufacturing UHMWPE articles,<br>
UHMWPE is synthesized as a powder. The powder may be compression molded, at high<br>
temperature and pressure, into thick billets which may be skived, while hot, into sheets of<br>
the desired thickness. UHMWPE is molded as thick billets because the gradients in<br>
temperature, crystallinity, density and hence specific volume are small, relative to the<br>
dimensions of the billet, leading to small thermal strains. In a thick billet, the ratio of the<br>
stress on the molded surface to the contraction stress of the bulk of the material is<br>
relatively low. By contrast, thin sections have a higher ratio and are more likely to either<br>
fail through cracking or to yield asymmetrically, resulting in built-in stresses.<br>
According to one example, BSS belts are thin, for example, on the order of 1/8 of<br>
an inch and are about 45 inches wide. A length of material used to form a BSS belt may<br>
be approximately 60 feet. Sheets of UHMWPE are commercially available in sheet sizes<br>
of 4 feet by 8 feet or 4 feet by 10 feet. Thus, a BSS belt may be formed by joining<br>
together several such sheets, as is discussed below in more detail. Alternatively, a BSS<br>
belt may be formed of a single sheet of UHMWPE, the ends of which may be joined<br>
together to form continuous belt. In yet another example, several narrow sheets may be<br>
joined along a length of the sheets to form a wide composite sheet, the ends of which may<br>
then be joined together to form a continuous belt.<br>
Welding, or joining, together of pieces of UHMWPE is not practiced to any<br>
significant extent in the related art, largely because of the difficulty of dealing with the<br>
thermal strains that result. Thus while UHMWPE is widely used for abrasion protection<br>
of steel surfaces, it is used as individual sheets which are mechanically fastened to the<br>
protected steel surface. When conventional heat sealing type equipment is used to attempt<br>
the welding of UHMWPE using techniques that are suitable for other polymers, the results<br>
are not satisfactory. The weld zone becomes liquid, indicated by it becoming clear, and<br>
two liquid pieces will adhere if pressed together. However, when the article is cooled the<br>
heat-affected zone contracts substantially which results in substantial warping of the sheet.<br>
The warping increases as the article continues to crystallize, and often sheets will crack as<br>
they cool. For example, the heated material accommodates the thermal strain by<br>
deforming plastically when it is hot Then, as the cooling material contracts, it becomes<br>
too stiff to deform plastically and so it either warps or cracks. Sheets can be seen to be flat<br>
immediately after removal from a welding device and cooled to room temperature, only to<br>
warp a day later due to continued crystallization and shrinkage.<br>
The stiffness of UHMWPE is also a sensitive function of the degree of<br>
crystallization. Less crystalline material is softer and has a lower modulus. However, as<br>
the belt for a BSS is operated, the material is flexed many times a second. This flexing<br>
has a tendency to cause the material of the belt to further crystallize, resulting in further<br>
dimensional and stiffness changes.<br>
Belts for a BSS move at high speed, for example, on the order of 20 meters per<br>
second, through a narrow gap. At this speed, the belt can be quickly destroyed if it catches<br>
on something or hits a piece of tramp material. Warping of the belt which causes it to<br>
deviate from the plane of the electrodes is unacceptable because the belt then pushes<br>
against the electrode and the other segment of belt traversing between the electrodes of the<br>
BSS, which increases the load and also can lead to the belt "catching" on itself or on the<br>
openings in the electrode where the feed is introduced. The belt "catching" can result in a<br>
catastrophic failure of the belt. The belt may also become completely severed<br>
longitudinally into two independent pieces. When the two remaining segments of belt<br>
continue to operate in the BSS, an undesirable situation is created because there is a<br>
stagnant stationary region between the two moving pieces where conductive material can<br>
build up and cause a shorting of the high voltage electrodes.<br>
In order to avoid the belt catching on the openings, warping of the belt must be<br>
kept to less than half the width of the gap 31 (see FIG. 3) between the electrodes 12,16.<br>
Applying tension to the belt might be thought to straighten out any warp. However,<br>
virtually every material will warp if sufficient tension is applied. All materials have a<br>
certain Poisson"s ratio which requires that when a material is stretched in one direction it<br>
contracts in all transverse directions. For example, a thin belt material cannot support this<br>
compressive load across its width and so it buckles, resulting in longitudinal wrinkles.<br>
One failure mode that has been observed in certain woven belts is longitudinal wrinkling<br>
leading to the parts of the belt that protrude being worn away. Wearing away of warped<br>
sections of the belt is not acceptable in most BSS applications.<br>
In theory, heating and cooling entire belt sections at a time might make welding the<br>
belt sections together possible. In practice however even that approach is problematic.<br>
What causes the warping is gradients of thermal expansion leading to differential thermal<br>
strains leading to differential stresses in the material. Thermal expansion of the material is<br>
due to both the temperature change and to the phase change. The phase change is not<br>
entirely uniform and isotropic. Thus a uniform temperature applied to the entire belt<br>
sections would not necessarily produce equal expansion and contraction of the material.<br>
Above the melting point the material is viscoelastic, where the stress depends on the strain<br>
rate. In addition, heating and cooling entire belt sections at one time would require a very<br>
large mold and because the belt is desirably quite thin, the belt would likely crack when<br>
cooled in contact with a rigid metal mold.<br>
The warping that occurs when welding two sheets of material together derives<br>
from irreversible deformation mat occurs during the heating and cooling cycle.<br>
UHMWPE must be heated to well above the melting point to achieve sufficient mobility<br>
for the surface molecules to interdiffuse and form a strong bond upon cooling. The<br>
UHMWPE expands during heating, the total volume change being on the order of 10%,<br>
and the yield stress of the hot material is much lower than the unheated material. Cool<br>
material near the heat affected zone restrains the hot material which yields. As the hot<br>
material cools, it shrinks, and as it becomes cooler and stiffer the yield stress increases and<br>
it is able to exert sufficient stress on the unheated material to cause deflection or<br>
deformation. Making the welded zone thinner causes the accumulated stress in the heated<br>
material during cooling to exceed the strength of the cooling material and it fails by<br>
cracking. Making the weld very thin also reduces the strength of the weld.<br>
Deformation or warp of the belt made from UHMWPE is determined by the<br>
contraction of the heat affected zone and the buckling of the surrounding material. The<br>
amount of any warpage is dependent on the total strain, which depends on the total length<br>
of the weld. For example, in a 40 inch wide belt, a 10% strain (resulting from a 10%<br>
change in volume as discussed above) results in plus 2 inches of deformation- for cold<br>
material and minus 2 inches of deformation for hot material. There is some yielding of the<br>
hot material, but even a 2.5% length change (1 inch in 40) results in substantial warpage.<br>
The warpage out of the plane of thebelt may be a critical parameter for BSS belts, and<br>
depends on the wavelength of the warp. If the warp is taken up as a single sine wave, the<br>
total out of plane deformation can be calculated approximately by:<br>
where d = deformation and ? - wavelength.<br>
Thus, if the wavelength of the sine wave is 80 inches (twice the length of the 40<br>
inch weld), equation 1 yields a total deformation, d, of 4.5 inches. This is far too much to<br>
be accommodated in most systems, because if, in order to avoid the belt catching on<br>
openings as discussed above, warping of the belt must be kept to less than half the width<br>
of the. gap between the electrodes, a deformation of 4.5 inches means that the gap width<br>
between the electrodes should be at least 9 inches. This is too wide a separation of the<br>
electrodes for efficient operation of the BSS. By contrast, if the same percentage strain is<br>
taken up with a warpage wavelength of 2 inches, the out of plane deformation, d, given by<br>
equation 1 is now 0.1 inches. This amount is less than the usual gap between the<br>
electrodes of the BSS. In practice much of this deformation is taken up plastically and<br>
elastically so the actual warpage may be much less than 0.1 inches.<br>
As mentioned above, the wavelength of the deformation determines the magnitude<br>
of the out of plane protrusion of the belt/sheet. The part of the sheet that experiences<br>
compressive thermal strain buckles because the compression load is greater than the<br>
critical load mat can be resisted without buckling. The critical load mat produces buckling<br>
is lowest at the longest wavelength deformation and increases rapidly as the wavelength<br>
decreases. This critical load can be calculated using Buler"s column formula:<br>
where E is the modulus of the material, A is the moment of inertia of the column<br>
and L is the length of the weld.<br>
Strain accumulates between the heat affected and non-heat affected zones of<br>
welded sections of the belt formed of UHMWPE, and causes deformation. The<br>
wavelength of the warp deformation may be controlled by setting the boundary conditions<br>
for stress and strain to zero at the ends of the weld bycreating free edges. Short welds<br>
result in a higher critical load for buckling and at this higher load, more of the thermal<br>
strain is accommodated through non-buckling deformation. If the welds are made short,<br>
all of the warp will be accommodated within the welds, and the wavelength will then be at<br>
most twice the length of the weld (one half a sine wave). Thus, by making the welds short<br>
(on the order of 1 inch) the out of plane component of any warpage will be small.<br>
Therefore, one aspect of a sheet welding method of the invention is to provide<br>
openings, for example, cuts in the sections of, for example, UHMWPE, to be welded such<br>
that the length of weld is relatively short, and so that the heat affected zone is within the<br>
area bounded by the openings. This allows the thermal strains to be taken up elastically in<br>
the heat affected and non-heat affected material. For example, sheets that have been<br>
joined by the process of this invention may be on the order of 10 feet long, or 120_inches.<br>
The heat affected zone is on the order of 1.2 inches wide, or approximately 1% ofjhe<br>
sheet length. Welding of the UHMWPE sheets under these conditions does produce holes<br>
in the belt, however in BSS"s most of the belt is open area and additional openings around<br>
a joint are not detrimental. Any warpage in the resultant welded sheets is very small and<br>
does not protrude beyond the plane of the belt. It is to be appreciated that individual<br>
small sheets can be so joined to form composite sheets, and a single sheet or a composite<br>
sheet can be joined to itself to form an endless loop.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, there is illustrated a portion of one example of the edges of a<br>
sheet prepared for welding according to the present invention. It is to be appreciated that<br>
joining may be accomplished by thermal welding, and also by other methods of plastic<br>
welding known to those of skill in the art, such as ultrasonic, dielectric, infrared. As<br>
discussed above, openings 50 are formed in each of a first sections (or sheet) 52 and a<br>
second section (or sheet) 54 of UHMWPE that are to be joined to form a belt. It is to be<br>
understood that the sections 52 and 54 of UHMWPE may be different sheets that are to be<br>
joined together, or may be edges of a same sheet or a composite sheet that are to be joined<br>
to form a continuous belt. Openings 50 are made in the sheet prior to the formation of the<br>
join. The openings 50 in the material at the join serve two purposes. First, space is<br>
provided where the material is removed by the cuts to accommodate the free.expansion of<br>
the UHMWPE as it expands during the heating. Second, adjacent join sections 56 (tabs<br>
of material) are decoupled from each other so that the thermal strain in one section that<br>
results during cooling and contraction does not add to an adjacent section, and so<br>
accumulate along a long length of the join. Accommodating the expansion on heating and<br>
allowing contraction on cooling prevents thermal strains from accumulating across the<br>
width of the belt and causing warpage of the belt during the welding process.<br>
Lines 58 and 60 demarcate the extent of the heat affected zone during a joining<br>
process. It can be seen that the openings 50 extend past the heat affected zone so that the<br>
heat affected zone is within the area bounded by the openings. This allows me thermal<br>
strains to be taken up elastically in the heat affected and non-heat affected material, as<br>
discussed above. In the illustrated example, the openings have rounded surfaces. It is<br>
desirable to prevent stress concentration at the base of the opening, and so it may be<br>
desirable to use a rounded cutter to form the opening, however, other shaped openings<br>
may be used as well. According to one example, the width of the belt (sections of material<br>
to be joined) may be approximately 40 inches, and the tabs of material 56 that form the<br>
material of the weld are approximately 1 inch wide. The width of the openings 50 is not<br>
critical, so long as material from adjacent tabs 56 does not expand across the opening 50<br>
during the welding process and upset the stress and strain free edge boundary condition.<br>
Breaking the weld up into a number of shorter weld segments with open space (i.e.,<br>
the openings 50) between them, as illustrated, also has the advantage that the open spaces<br>
act as crack terminators. Cracks readily propagate through a solid material because the<br>
stress is concentrated at the tip of the crack. An opening sufficiently large that the stress<br>
of the crack can be distributed elastically around the opening is an effective crack<br>
terminator.<br>
A critical parameter of BSS belts may be their uniformity of thickness and the lack<br>
of protrusions from the surface which can catch on openings in the electrodes or on the<br>
confronting section of the belt as the belt traverses with the BSS. As discussed above,<br>
making the joint between sheets of a multiplicity of short welds addresses the warpage<br>
problem, but the joining procedure should also not generate protrusions. A butt weld, e.g.,<br>
a weld of planar surfaces, does not have sufficient strength to withstand normal tensile<br>
loads in an operating BSS and there is a discontinuity in material stiffness across such a<br>
joint. During passage over the multiple rollers of the separator (at a rate of approximately<br>
6 per second), the joint is subjected to multiple cycles of positive and negative bending.<br>
This cyclical back and forth bending results in failure of the joint in a butt weld In<br>
contrast, a joint made by simply overlapping material may result in excess thickness of the<br>
joint and the belt. Constraining the thickness by confining the weld between heated<br>
platens may cause the excess material to extrude out. UHMWPE does not deform<br>
plastically in these cases, instead, the material cracks. The cracks provide for stress<br>
concentrations which have the potential to propagate into the bulk material.<br>
Discontinuities in temperature history can also cause discontinuities in degree of<br>
crystallinity and hence discontinuities in material modulus. Such discontinuities in<br>
modulus can also lead to stress concentration and cracking.<br>
Accordingly, to avoid the above-described problems, a weld joint preparation<br>
exhibiting tapering of the sections to be joined, may used according to one embodiment of<br>
the invention. FIG. 5 illustrates a cross-section of a weld according to an embodiment of<br>
the invention. As shown in FIG. 5, each of the tabs of material 56 (see FIG. 4) may be<br>
tapered with an angle 70. In one embodiment, substantially matching angles may be<br>
formed on each of the two sheets (or edges) to be joined, such that when the sheets are<br>
placed together with a slight overlap, the substantially matching angled edges fit together,<br>
as shown. The tapering of the join is of particular importance. This tapering allows any<br>
discontinuity in modulus which occurs in the welded material to be spread out over a<br>
longer space and so reduces any tendency for stress concentration.<br>
A large percentage of open area is desirable in a BSS belt, and a "strong" belt is<br>
also desirable. Thus, there is a need to optimize a tradeoff between these two features.<br>
The strength of the welded joint depends on the cross section of that joint. The strength of<br>
the heat affected material at the weld is lower than that of the bulk material. However,<br>
much of the bulk material is removed to provide for the open area that is necessary for<br>
proper BSS operation. The weld therefore, need only be as strong as the weakened<br>
material of the remainder of the belt This may be accomplished by using a larger cross<br>
section for the welds man for the remainder of the belt. Increasing the area of the weld<br>
allows the joint to develop the full strength of the material even though the weld itself has<br>
lower strength. Using a tapered joint, such as illustrated in FIG. S, also reduces the<br>
discontinuity in material properties that can lead to stress concentration and eventual<br>
failure.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 5, the weld may be produced by machining the two ends<br>
52,54 to be joined in matching acute angles, as discussed above. In one example, the<br>
angle may be less than approximately 30 degrees. The smaller the angle the larger the<br>
cross section of the weld. The tensile load on the belt is transferred by shear through this<br>
weld. In one example, an angle (70) of 15 degrees has been used and has worked well.<br>
This angle increases the cross section of the joined area for the transfer of the tensile load<br>
by shear by about 4 times the cross section of the unmachined material. In another<br>
example, a range of 10 to 45 degrees may be used. if the angle is too large, there is<br>
limited overlap, and the accuracy required for the edge preparation may become excessive.<br>
Similarly, when the angle gels too small, the sections become very thin and the weld width<br>
may become excessive.<br>
The strength of the joint exceeds that of the bulk material even if the strength of<br>
the weld is 1/3 that of the base material. However the joint does represent a weakened<br>
portion of the belt and care needs to be taken that Mure does not start at one point and<br>
propagate through fatigue to other regions. This is accomplished by ensuring that the open<br>
segments are sufficiently open that the excess material can freely expand during the<br>
welding process and by ensuring mat there are no surface defects in the heat affected<br>
material such as surface cracks which may initiate propagating fatigue cracks. If any such<br>
cracks do form during the welding process, it is desirable to machine away the cracked<br>
material before using the belt<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, there is illustrated a flow diagram of one embodiment of a<br>
method for manufacturing a belt, according to aspects of the invention. As discussed<br>
above, in a first step 200, one or more sheets of thermoplastic sheet may be provided that<br>
are to be joined together. In one example, two or more sheets may be joined to provide a<br>
larger composite sheet, that may ultimately formed into a continuous belt Opposing<br>
edges of either a single sheet or a composite sheet may be joined to form a continuous<br>
belt The following method applies to either me joining of separate sheets or of opposing<br>
edges of a same sheet<br>
In a next step 202, the edges to be joined may be tapered, and the openings 50 (see<br>
FIG. 4) formed (step 204), as discussed above. The weld of the edges may be begun to be<br>
produced, m steps 206 and 208, by orientating the two ends of the sheets 52, 54 in a<br>
welding machine which presses the machined ends of the sheets together with flat platens<br>
76,78 such mat they overlap, as shown in FIG. 5. The space between the platens may be<br>
controlled by the introduction of spacer elements 72 and 74, in Step 210. When<br>
sufficiently rigid platens are used, the spacers can be disposed at the ends, as shown. If<br>
less rigid platens are used, the spacers may be inserted along an interior, for example in<br>
the open space provided by openings 50 between the tabs of material 56 (sce FIG. 4). The<br>
location of these spacers is illustrated in FIG. 7 which shows an end view of the sheets 52,<br>
54 between the platens 76,78. The spacer elements 72,74 may have a thickness that is<br>
substantially equal to a thickness of the belt, and are made of a material that does not<br>
soften at the temperatures used.<br>
The platens 76,78 are then closed, as indicated in step 212, and pressure is applied<br>
to the platens, and transferred through the platens to the sheets 52,54. In a next step 214,<br>
the platens are heated either electrically or more conveniently with a circulating hot fluid.<br>
Pressure is maintained on the weld during the heating and cooling cycle. In one example,<br>
the temperature is increased to approximately 395 F (or 202 degrees C) and is held for<br>
about 30 minutes. The heating is then stopped, and cooling fluid is circulated to cool the<br>
weld to near ambient temperature. The weld is cooled so that it does not deform on being<br>
removed from the weld machine. The belt should be kept in a reasonably flat<br>
configuration for some time after the weld is made while the UHMWPE continues to<br>
crystallize. The glass transition temperature for polyethylene is 153 K. Above that<br>
temperature it will continue to crystallize over time.<br>
As discussed above, in one embodiment, the plastic is brought to welding<br>
temperature by direct contact with heated platens. Alternate methods of heating are<br>
known, such as heating by ultrasonic or infra red radiation. Alternate methods can be used<br>
provided that the temperature of the material during welding is controlled and that<br>
pressure is applied to ensure that the thickness of the joint is substantially equal to that of<br>
the parent material.<br>
Using a tapered weld also allows the weld to be subjected to significant pressure<br>
during the welding process. Sometimes, the two pieces to be welded do not align exactly,<br>
and there is a slight "interference" fit 81, as shown in FIG. 5. During the welding process,<br>
the material is held between two heated platens 76,78. The platens provide a reference<br>
surface and determine the thickness of the weld. Providing for overlap ensures that there<br>
is sufficient material at the weld and that some material may flow to the open spaces<br>
provided. The degree of overlap can be quantified by comparing the thickness of the joint<br>
before welding (dimension 80) to that of the parent material (dimension 82). The sum of<br>
the dimension of the parent material (82) and the overlap (81) equals that of the thickness<br>
before welding (80). The fractional degree of overlap is (80-82)/82. To express the<br>
fractional degree of overlap as a percentage, the fractional value is multiplied by 100. In<br>
one example, the overlap is approximately 10%. In another example, an overlap of 60%<br>
was used and has worked well, but other values may be used as well. The overlap also<br>
serves to reduce the degree of accuracy required in the machining of the mating surfaces.<br>
It may be particularly important that the molten surfaces be pressed together during the<br>
welding process. If in the machining process, there is an inaccuracy in the surfaces such<br>
that they are not in contact, those surfaces will not form a satisfactory weld. By providing<br>
for overlap, a single fixed flat platen and a single movable flat platen can be used to press<br>
the surfaces together.<br>
It is to be appreciated that the heating and cooling cycle is important, both in the<br>
temperatures reached and the time at different temperatures. It has also been found that<br>
edge effects are important in the heat transfer to and from the belt during the welding<br>
process. These edge effects can be overcome by using a sacrificial material at the edge of<br>
the belt which may later be cut off of the belt and discarded, to move the edge effect from<br>
the belt edge into a disposable member. Conveniently this member can also be a spacer<br>
that controls the spacing of the platens to that of the desired thickness of the belt.<br>
A potential failure mode is the unpeeling of the weld. The belt is subjected to<br>
significant shear on one surface where it contacts the electrodes at tens of meters per<br>
second. Peeling back with wear of the exposed piece and sometimes with the protruding<br>
piece catching on a feed port can lead to catastrophic failure of the belt The incidence of<br>
such a failure mode may be reduced by choosing the orientation of the weld overlap such<br>
that the thin tapered portion of the weld is on the trailing edge of the belt. With this<br>
orientation there is no tendency for the edge to peel back and for a failure of the weld to<br>
initiate and propagate across the joint. The orientation of the weld edges is seen in FIG. 5<br>
relative to the leading edges of the cross strands 46. The belt may be installed in the<br>
machine with surface 88 facing an electrode and surface 90 facing another section of belt.<br>
The direction of travel of the belt with respect to stationary electrodes would then be as<br>
shown by arrow 92.<br>
Producing a belt in this manner from machined sheets of UHMWPE allows for the<br>
profiles discussed in U.S. Patent 5,904,253, herein incorporated by reference, to be<br>
utilized. One example of a convenient method is to use a multi-axis machine tool. With<br>
this device, a sheet is loaded onto a table and a cutter head is moved across the sheet and<br>
each opening in the belt may be cut individually. Through the proper choice of cutting<br>
tool, the holes can have the desired leading edge and trailing edge features as desired. It is<br>
to be appreciated that the desired leading edge geometry can be obtained through forming<br>
means such as molding, punching, machining, water jet cutting, laser cutting, and the like.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 6, in a step 216 of this embodiment of the method of<br>
manufacturing the belt, the total length of the joined sections may be evaluated to<br>
determine whether it is sufficiently long to form a complete belt for the desired<br>
application. If not, additional sheets may be welded by repeating steps 208-214 as<br>
indicated by step 218, to form a composite sheet of a desired length. Opposing edges of<br>
the composite sheet may then be joined together to form a continuous belt, as indicated in<br>
steps 220-224.<br>
The belt manufacturing method disclosed herein can also be utilized to produce<br>
belts for other applications. In many other applications, holes in the belt may be<br>
undesirable. As described above, according to one embodiment, material at the weld may<br>
be removed to break-up the weld into short independent sections. After this is done and<br>
the weld is made, the holes can be filled in with material to give a hole-free belt It may<br>
be desirable, however, to allow for stress distribution around the welds and for the welds<br>
to remain structurally independent. One way of doing this is to fill the holes with a low<br>
modulus material, such as thin polyethylene film or foam. The foam is easily deformed<br>
and will accommodate substantial thermal strains generated during the welding.<br>
With the capability of welding sheets of UHMWPE into continuous endless belts,<br>
flexibility in belt geometry can be achieved. The sheets can be held on a table and holes<br>
can be machined in the sheet. There is complete flexibility in selecting the geometry of<br>
the cross direction strands and the machine direction strands. The machine direction<br>
strands can be designed to have excellent fatigue life and the cross direction strands can<br>
have excellent separation geometry. The method of manufacture and materials described<br>
herein can thus be used to achieve longer life belts which are amenable to better geometry<br>
control. Producing BSS belts in this manner also allows for additional features to be<br>
incorporated.<br>
It is to be appreciated that the BSS belt is used in a difficult environment. Flyash<br>
is abrasive and is often filled with tramp material. Stones, welding rod, bolts, gloves,<br>
refractory, and all manner of tramp material has been found in flyash, and numerous belt<br>
failures have resulted from tramp material. If the foreign object is larger man the gap<br>
between the electrodes, the object will not enter the machine but will remain hung up at a<br>
feed point until it gets ground up or until the belt is destroyed. In one embodiment of a<br>
belt of the invention, periodic strong transverse elements may be provided in the belt An<br>
illustration of a portion of a belt showing such strength elements 100,101,102,103 is<br>
shown in FIG. 8. The belt can get hung up at one of these strong elements and be stopped<br>
so that the machine can be opened and cleared of the tramp material. According to one<br>
example, the strong elements may be provided by periodically omitting machining holes<br>
106 in the belt. Often it is useful to have this increased strength segment 100 as part of the<br>
weld. The belt may be seen to be torn in the lengthwise direction until the tear reaches a<br>
weld where the tear is terminated. Belts can then survive several such events occurring at<br>
different positions on the belt whereas with prior belts, a single event would result in a<br>
lengthwise tear the entire length of the belt and so destroy it It is to be appreciated that<br>
these imporforate regions can be grouped as in a line either lengthwise, for example, along<br>
an edge 104. Alternatively, a strength member 101 may be provided as an imporforate<br>
section across a width of the belt, or diagonally (e.g. region 102, or they can be randomly<br>
disposed (e.g. regions 103), or disposed in a regular pattern.<br>
Having thus described various illustrative embodiments and aspects thereof,<br>
modifications, and alterations may be apparent to those of skill in the art. For example,<br>
the sheet welding method disclosed herein may be used to weld materials other than<br>
UHMWPE, such as high density polyethylene nylon, polyester, and that thermoplastic<br>
sheet includes both perforated and imporforate sheets of any thermoplastic material. Such<br>
modifications and alterations are intended to be included in this disclosure, which is for<br>
the purpose of illustration and not intended to be limiting. The scope of the invention<br>
should be determined from proper construction of the appended claims, and their<br>
equivalents.<br>
