The present invention pertains to a process for inhibiting the fouling of a substrate in a marine fouling environment.<br>
Man-made structures such as boat hulls, buoys, drilling platforms, oil production rigs, and pipes which are immersed in water are prone to fouling by aquatic organisms such ^ as green and brown algae, barnacles, mussels, and the like. Such structures are commonly of metal, but may also comprise other structural materials such as concrete. This fouling is a nuisance on boat hulls, because it increases frictional resistance during movement through the water, the consequence being reduced speeds and increased fuel costs. It is a nuisance on static structures such as the legs of drilling platforms and oil production rigs, firstly because the resistance of thick layers of fouling to waves and currents can cause unpredictable and potentially dangerous stresses in the structure, and, secondly, because fouling makes it difficult to inspect the structure for defects such as stress cracking and corrosion. It is a nuisance in pipes such as cooling water intakes and outlets, because the effective cross-sectional area is reduced by fouling, with the consequence that flow rates are reduced. The commercially most successful methods of inhibiting fouling have involved the use of anti-fouling coatings containing substances toxic to aquatic life, for example tributyltin chloride or cuprous oxide. Such coatings, however, are being regarded with increasing disfavour because of the damaging effects such toxins may have if released into the aquatic environment. There is accordingly a need for non-fouling coatings which do not contain markedly toxic materials.<br>
It has been known for many years, for example as disclosed in GB 1,307,001 and US 3,702,778 that silicone rubber coatings resist fouling by aquatic organisms. It is believed that such coatings present a surface to which the organisms cannot easily adhere, and they can accordingly be called non-fouling -<br><br>
rather than anti-fouling coatings. Silicone rubbers and silicone compounds generally have very low toxic properties. Silicone rubber coatings have, however, gained little commercial acceptance, it is difficult to make them adhere well to the substrate surface that is to be protected, and mechanically they are rather weak and liable to damage.<br>
It is known to use fluorinated polymers for fouling control in anti-fouling or non-fouling coating compositions.<br>
In JP 04-045170 a fluorinated silicone resin is disclosed which is obtained by grafting a fluorine-containing acrylate to a silicone resin having olefinically unsaturated bonds in its terminal groups.<br>
In JP 61-043668 a coating composition having antifouling properties is disclosed which is prepared by compounding an alkyd resin with a polymer prepared by reacting a fluorine-containing monomer with an acrylate polymer. In JP 06-322294 a corrosion protecting antifouling coating is disclosed comprising a film forming resin and an organopolysiloxane having oxyalkylene groups and perfluoroalkyi groups,<br>
Fluorinated polymers are also known for other uses.<br>
In JP 06-239876 a fluorinated polymer having excellent wetting properties is disclosed that Is used in an adhesive. In US4,900,474 a perfluoroether group-containing organopolysiloxane is disclosed that is used as a silicone antifoamer.<br>
None of the fluorinated polymers that are known in the art have found wide application in antifouling coating compositions,- since their anti-fouling/foul release properties are not sufficient and/or their mechanical properties do not make these compositions suited fo,r use on various kind of structures that are immersed in water. In particular, the mechanical properties should be such that it applied as a coating composition for a boat hull, said coating composition should have sufficient strength and abrasion resistance to have a service life of several years.<br><br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a new antifouling coating<br>
composition with very good anti-fouling/foul release properties and sufficient<br>
mechanical strength and a process for inhibiting the fouling of a substrate in a<br>
marine fouling environment wherein this new antifouling coating composition is<br>
used. This process comprises forming on a substrate, before exposure of the<br>
substrate to a marine fouling environment, a coating comprising a curable<br>
fluorinated resin of the general formula:	.<br>

alkyl groups;<br>
-	RF is a group having an average molecular weight by number between 350<br>

c)	-CH20-CH2-CH(OH)CHrS-(CH2)q<br>
L can also be a trivalent group. In this case in formula (1) -L-W becomes -L-<br>
(W)2.    ,<br>
Preference is given to a compound wherein L is A) with m = 1, n = 0-5, and q -<br>
1-3.<br>
Further preference is given to R' being selected from one of the following<br>
structures:<br>
1)	-(CF2O)a-{C2F4O)b-, wherein a'/b' is between 0,2 and 2, a' and b* being integers giving the above molecular weight;<br>

Good results in foul release and/or mechanical strength were found for a coating composition comprising the fluorinated resin of formula (I) that is obtainable by reacting a silicon compound, as defined below, with bifunctional<br><br>
perfluoropolyethers having -OH or -COOR end groups, with R=H or 01-C3 of the general fonnula:<br>
H-(OCH2CH2)n-OCH2-CF2-O-R1- CF2- CH2O-(CH2CH2O)n-H     (II)<br>
or ROOC- CF2-O-RR- CF2-COOR     (III) wherein RF and n have the meaning as defined before. These compounds are commercially available from Ausimont under the names Fomblin® ZDOL ZDEAL,.   ZDOL-TX.   However,   it   is   also   possible   to   use   bifunctional perfluoroethers having other end groups, e.g., epoxy groups<br>
Examples of suitable silicon compounds which can be reacted with the above bifunctional perfluoropoiyether precursors are compounds of the general formula<br>
R3-Si-(R4)3 (IV) wherein R3 is a group capable of coupling the silicon compound to the fluorinated polyether and the R4 groups each independently have the meaning of an ether or ester group, preferably a group including a straight-chain or branched alky! moiety having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms. For example, a silicon compound in which R3 is an isocyanate-functional group can be coupled to a fluorinated polyether having at least two functional groups selected from hydroxyl, amine, or carboxylic acid-functional groups. A silicon compound in which R3 Is an amine-functional group can be coupled to a fluorinated polyether having at least two functional groups selected from carboxylic acid ester or epoxy-functional groups. A silicon compound in which R3 is a thiol-functional group can be coupled to a fluorinated polyether having at least two epoxy-functional groups.<br>
Examples of preferred Silicon compounds are alkoxyalkyisilyl isocyanates, alkoxysilyl   alkyl   isocyanates,   alkoxy   silanes,   alkoxyalkyl   siianes,    and alkoxyalkyisilyl mercapto-, amino-, and glycidyl-functional compounds, such as 3- methyldimethoxy silylpropyl isocyanate, 3-trimethoxy silylpropyl isocyanate,<br><br>
3-triethoxy silylpropyl isocyanate,<br>
3-mercaptopropyl trimethoxy silane,<br>
3-mercaptopropyl methyldimethoxy siiane,<br>
3-aminopropyl trimethoxy silane,<br>
3-aminopropyl triethoxy siiane, and<br>
3-glycidoxypropyl trimethoxy silane.<br>
The thus obtained fiuorinated resins are also the subject of the present<br>
invention.<br>
In general, good results in both anti/non-fouling properties and mechanical strength are found when the fiuorinated resin has a Tg in the range from -120 to 20oC and a surface energy in the range from 10 to 25 mN/m. In general, mechanical properties improve when the Tg of the resin is increased, foul release properties improve when the Tg of the material is lowered. So, for each fiuorinated resin an optimum balance has to be found between mechanical properties and foul release properties by tuning the Tg of the resin. This tuning can, e.g., be done by varying the length of the Rf segment or the W segment<br>
	■	"	"	T	.	—^^<br>
A coating composition can be prepared by mixing the fiuorinated resin, a curing catalyst, for example a condensation catalyst, optionally a co-catalyst, optionally a crosslinker for the resin, a reactive or non-reactive fluid additive, solvents, fillers, pigments and/or thixotropes.<br>
Examples of catalysts that may be used include the carboxylic acid salts of various metals, such as tin, zinc, iron, lead, barium, and zirconium. The salts preferably are salts of long-chain carboxylic acids, for example dibutyltin dilaurate, dibutyltin dioctoate, iron stearate, tin (II) octoate, and lead octoate. .Further examples of suitable .catalysts include organobismuth and organotitanium compounds and organo-phosphates such as 2-ethyl-hexyl hydrogen phosphate. Other possible catalysts include. chelates, for example dibutyltin acetoacetonate. Further, the catalyst may comprise a halogenated organic acid, which has at least one halogen substituent on a carbon atom<br><br>
which is in α-position relative to the acid group and/or at least one halogen substituent on a carbon atom which is in p-position relative to the acid group, or a derivative which is hydrolysable to form such an acid under the conditions of the condensation reaction.<br>
The presence of a cross-linker for the resin is only necessary if the resin cannot be cured by condensation. This depends on the functional groups that are present in the fluorinated resin, In general, when the fluorinated resin comprises alkoxy groups, the presence of a cross-linker is not necessary. If the fluorinated resin comprises alkoxy-silyl groups, in general the presence of a small amount of a condensation catalyst and water is sufficient to achieve full cure of the coating after application. For these compositions, normally atmospheric moisture is sufficient to induce curing and as a rule it will not be necessary to heat the coating composition after application.<br>
The crosslinker that is optionally present can be a cross-linking agent comprising a functional silane and/or one or more oxime groups. Examples of such cross-linking agents are presented in W099/33927. Mixtures of different cross-linkers can also be used<br>
Examples of reactive or non-reactive fluid additives that can be used in the coating composition according to the present invention are non- or monofunctional fluorinated polyethers. These compounds can be represented by the following structure:<br>
T.O-CFY-O-Rf-CFY-(L)k^-Ti     (V) wherein<br>
-	k is an integer 0 or 1,<br>
-	T is selected from -CF3, -C2F5, -C3F7. CF2CI, C2F4CI, C3F6CI,<br>
-	Ti = -O-T when k=O.T1=W when k is 1.<br>
and wherein Rf, Y, and L have the meaning as defined before.<br><br>
Commercial products are available from Ausimont, e.g. Fomblin® Y25. Other unreactive oils such as silicone oil, especially methyl-phenyl silicone oil, petrolatum, polyolefin oil, or a polyaromatic oil can also be used. The proportbn of these reactive or non-reactive fluid additives may be in the range of from 0 to 25% by weight based on the total weight of the coating composition.<br>
Examples of solvents that can be used in the coating composition according to the present invention include polar solvents or mixtures thereof, such as methyl isobutyl ketone or butyl acetate. Non-polar solvents or mixtures thereof, for example xylene, can be used as co-solvents<br>
Examples of fillers that can be used in the coating composition according to the<br>
present invention are barium sulphate, calcium sulphate, calcium carbonate,<br>
silicas or silicateg (such as talc, feldspar, and china clay), aluminium<br>
paste/flakes, bentonite or other clays. Some fillers may have a thixotropic effect<br>
on the coating composition. The proportion of fillers mav be in the range of from<br>
0 to 25% by weight	based on the total weight of the coating composition.<br>
Examples of pigments that can. be used in the coating composition according to<br>
the present invention are black iron oxide and titanium dioxide. The proportion<br>
of pigments may be in the range of from 0 to 10% by weight, based on the total weight of the coating composition.<br>
The coating composition can be applied by normal techniques, such as brush, roller or spray (airless and conventional). To achieve proper adhesion to the substrate it is preferred to apply the anti/non-fouling coating composition to a primed substrate. The primer can be any conventional primer/sealer coating system. Good results were found, in particular with respect to adhesion, when using a primer that comprises an acrylic siloxy-functional polymer, a solvent, a<br>
thixotropic agent, filler, and, optionally, a moisture scavenger. Such a primer is disclosed in WO 99/33927, -<br><br>
It is aiso possible to apply the coating composition in the process according to the present invention on a substrate containing an aged anti-fouling coating layer. Before the coating composition is applied to such an aged layer, this old layer is cleaned by high-pressure water washing to remove any fouling. The primer disclosed in WO 99/33927 can be used as a tie coat between the aged coating layer and the coating composition according to the present invention. In general, low-surface energy coatings such as coatings comprising silicones or fluoropolymers do not provide a sound base for application of the coating composition according to the present invention, not even after the application of a tie-coat, since the adhesion between the aged coating layer and the freshly applied coating layer in general is insufficient<br>
After the coating has been cured, it can be immersed immediately and gives immediate anti-fouling and fouling release protection.<br>
As indicated above, the coating composition used in the process according to the present invention has very good anti-fouling and foul release properties in combination with a high mechanical strength. This makes these coating compositions very suitable for use as anti-fouling or non-fouling coatings for marine applications, The coating can be used for both dynamic and static structures, such as boat hulls, buoys, drilling platforms, oil production rigs, and pipes which are immersed in water. The coating can be applied on any substrate that is used for these structures, such as metal, concrete, wood or fibre-reinforced resin.<br>
The coating compositions used in the process according to the present invention are preferably applied as high solids formulations. These compositions comprise less than 30% by weight of solvent, preferably less than 20%, still more preferably less than 10%, These formulations belong to the class of. solventless coatings.  Such coatings have minimal environmental<br>
impact in view of their low solvent content<br><br>
The combination of low (ambient) temperature curing of the resins and high solids content of the coating composition makes the coating compositions according to the present invention suitable for application in the open field.<br>
The invention will be elucidated with reference to the following examples. These are intended to illustrate the invention, but are not to be construed as limiting in any manner the scope thereof.<br><br>

The coating compositions of Examples 4-8 were applied to wood substrates bearing an anti-con-osive undercoat and coating primers as disclosed in WO 99/33927. The coating formulations were applied by brush and roller to give a layer of average dry film thickness in the range from 25 to 75 µm. For static anti-fouling assessment the coated substrates were immersed in a marine estuary known for its weed, slime, hard-shelled and soft-bodied animal fouling. After one season (February - October) the accumulated fouling was significantly less than that of control substrates not coated with the compositions and maintained under the same conditions over the same period of time. Any fouling on the substrates with the compositions of Examples 4-8 could be removed easily by light rubbing or low-pressure water jet. Accumulated fouling on the control substrates immersed over the same period could not be removed in a similar way.<br>
For these coating compositions the following quantitative fouling properties were found:<br><br><br>
