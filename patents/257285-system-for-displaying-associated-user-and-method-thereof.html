System for Displaying Associated-User and Method thereof<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to instant messaging in internet, and particularly to, a system for displaying associated-user, method and computer-readable medium thereof.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
At present, Instant Messenger (IM) for communication, entertainment or obtaining information, has been accepted by more and more people. The IM becomes an indispensable part of people's life, which is not only used for entertainment, but also used for work and life of people.<br>
At an IM client, associated-user information (e.g., good friend information) as well as prompt information of an instant message is usually displayed via a window. In the window, each associated-user is usually listed by a list. When an instant message comes, a user is prompted by a rocking head-image, or a prompt of an arriving instant message is provided by an IM dialog window popping out directly.<br>
In addition, when the IM client is minimized, it is displayed as a small icon in a prompt bar of operating system. The prompt of the arriving instant message is provided by a rocking small icon, or the prompt of the arriving instant message is provided by an IM dialog window popping out directly.<br>
However, when information of the associated-user is displayed at the IM client, the IM client is displayed in a limited space and fixedly located in a desktop of computer. So the user cannot acquire the information of the associated-user timely and comprehensively. For example, only the associated-user's static image list can be displayed, the special associated-users can not be highlighted. When the instant message is received by the IM client, the prompt to the user is not enough in the IM client, and several inquiries should be performed to determine which associated-user sends the instant message. If the IM client is minimized, when instant messages from multiple associated-users come, since only one icon is rocking, it is difficult to tell how many instant messages come and which associated-user sends the instant message respectively. Some special associated-users can not be displayed in a highlighted way, when the user<br><br>
has to communicate with a certain associated-user, the user has to open a list of associated-user at the IM client, find the associated-user needing communication, and chck the icon of the associated-user. It is clear that the above mentioned way for communication is complicated and tedious. Furthermore, the display of the associated-user is constrained in the list of associated-users at the IM client, dynamic information such as the associated-user's virtual image cannot be displayed, and the dynamic information of the associated-user can not be displayed in or between interactions of the users.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Fig.l is a block diagram illustrating structure of a system for displaying associated-user in a first embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the system includes an icon creating unit 11 and a message prompting unit 12. An associated-user virtual image is displayed and a prompt for arrival of instant message is provided via combining the system with the IM client and using modules at the IM client (alternatively the system may be an independent software). The IM client refers to a program running on a computer or a mobile terminal (e.g. mobile telephone).<br>
When an associated-user is dragged out of a list of associated-users at the IM client, Icon creating unit 11 creates a floating icon for the associated-user being dragged out. The floating icon is displayed on all windows of operating system. In this embodiment, the list of associated-users refers to a list for displaying all associated-users at the IM client. And the associated-user may be a friend, a group or a contact of user logging in the IM client. The logging-in user and any one of its associated users can send instant messages to each other via a message dialog window for communication.<br><br>
The process of dragging refers to the dragging via a mouse. And icon crating unit 11 creates the floating icon for each associated-user dragged out of the list of associated-user. Thus, a plurality of floating icons may be provided simultaneously on a desktop of the operating system, and each floating icon corresponds to an associated-user.<br>
The floating icon may be consistent with associated-user image in the list of associated-user at the IM client, alternatively the floating icon can be provided independently. The floating icon, not limited to a static picture, may be a virtual image (e.g. avatar). In addition, the floating icon may show information such as personal data of associated-user.<br>
When an instant message from associated-user is received by the IM client, message prompting unit 12 changes a displaying mode of the floating icon. For example, message prompting unit 12 makes the floating icon begin to rock, change in color or displaying picture. Certainly, only when the instant message of the associated-user corresponding to floating icon is received by the IM client, the displaying mode of the floating icon is varied. However the instant message from any irrelevant user does not affect the displaying of the floating icon.<br>
As shown in Fig.2, icon creating unit 11 in Fig.l further includes a moving subsystem 111, a creating subsystem 112 and a locating subsystem 113.<br>
Moving subsystem 111 is employed to drag the associated-user out of the list of associated-user at the IM client. Moving subsystem 111 performs the process of dragging via a mouse action. At first, the mouse is moved to the location where icon of the corresponding associated-user in the list is, the left key of the mouse is pressed down, and then the mouse is moved. The user can drag any associated-user in the list via moving subsystem 111.<br>
Creating subsystem 112 is employed to create the floating icon. The floating icon corresponds to the associated-user dragged by moving subsystem 111 out of the list. And each floating icon corresponds to one associated-user in the list.<br><br>
Locating subsystem 113 is employed to locate the floating icon at a designated place in the desktop of operating system. In this embodiment, locating subsystem 113 implements the process of locating via a mouse which moves the floating icon.<br>
Fig.3 is a schematic illustrating structure of a system for displaying associated-user in the second embodiment of the present invention. In this embodiment, the system includes a window opening unit 23, an icon creating unit 21 and a message prompting unit 22. Window opening unit 23 is employed to open the instant message window corresponding to the associated-user when the floating icon is triggered. The triggering condition includes, for example, a mouse double clicking.<br>
In addition, when the floating icon is dragged back to the list of associated-user, the system may also include an icon erasing unit 24 for erasing the floating icon, so that the original displaying mode is recovered.<br>
Fig.4 is a flowchart illustrating a method for associated-user displaying in the third embodiment of the present invention. The method includes the following steps.<br>
Step S41: when an associated-user is dragged out of a list of associated-users, a floating icon is created for the associated-user, and the floating icon is displayed on desktop of operating system. In this embodiment, the associated-user may be a friend, a group or a contact of a user at the IM client. The logging-in user and any one of its associated users can send instant messages to each other via a message dialog window for communication.<br>
The step S41 may be performed a plurality of times; a floating icon is created for each associated-user dragged out of the list of the associated-users. Thus, a plurality of floating icons may be provided simultaneously on the desktop of the operating system, and each floating icon corresponds to an associated-user respectively.<br>
The floating icon may be consistent with associated-user image in the list of associated-user at the IM client, alternatively the floating icon can be provided independently. The floating icon, not limited to a static picture, may be a virtual image (e.g. avatar). In addition, the floating icon may show information such as personal data of associated-user.<br><br>
Step S42: when an instant message from the associated user is received by the IM client, a displaying mode of the floating icon is changed. For example, the floating icon is changed to be rocking, the floating icon is changed in color, or the floating icon changes the displayed picture.<br>
Fig.5 is a schematic in detail illustrating the process in Fig.4 of creating the floating icon (step S41), the process of creating the floating icon further includes the following steps,<br>
Step S51: an associated-user is dragged out of a list of associated-users. In this embodiment, mouse action is used for the process of dragging.<br>
Step S52: a floating icon corresponding to the associated-user dragged out of the list is created. A plurality of floating icons may be created; each floating icon corresponds to one associated-user in the list.<br>
Step S53: the floating icon is located at a designated place in desktop of operating system. In this embodiment, mouse action is used for the process of locating so that the floating icon is moved.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the above mentioned method also includes the step of: when the floating icon is triggered, opening an instant message window corresponding to the associated-user.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the above mentioned method also includes the step of: erasing the floating icon when the floating icon is dragged back to the list of associated-users at the IM client.<br>
Further, the embodiment of the present invention also provides a computer-readable medium which stores the computer program product for implementing the displaying of associated-user. In this embodiment, the computer program product includes computer program code portions configured to perform one or more steps of the inventive method and to realize one or more parts and/or functions of the inventive units in the above embodiments, when the computer program code portions are run on a computing device. For example, computer program code parts, when run on the computing device, may realize one or more parts and functions of one or more of the icon creating unit, the<br><br>
messaging prompting unit and the window opening unit. Preferably, the computer-readable medium is a read-only memory (ROM), a random-access memory (RAM) or a flash memory.<br>
