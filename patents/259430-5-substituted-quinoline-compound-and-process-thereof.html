				<td>5-Substituted Quinoline and Isoquinoline Derivatives, a Process for Their Production and Their Use as Anti-Inflammatory Agents<br>
This application claims the benefit of the filing date of U.S. Provisional Application Serial No. 60/628,550 filed November 18, 2004 which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
The invention relates to 5-substituted quinoline and isoquinoline derivatives, a process for their production and their use as anti-inflammatory agents.<br>
From the prior art WO03/082827, anti-inflammatory agents of general formula <br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
are known, whereby the Q-radical comprises quinoline and isoquinoline derivatives. In the experiment, these compounds show dissociations of actions between anti-inflammatory actions and undesirable metabolic actions and are superior to the previously described, nonsteroidal glucocorticoids or have at least just as good an action. Moreover, these compounds have improved selectivity compared to other steroid receptors.<br>
It has now been found, surprisingly enough, that compounds of formulas (Ila) and (lib) are especially active and are dissociated with respect to side effects and are preferably suitable for local administration.<br>
This invention therefore relates to compounds of general formulas (Ila) and (lib)<br><br><br><br><br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
R1 and R2, independently of one another, can be a hydrogen atom, a Ci-3-alkyl group, a halogen atom, a cyano group, a Ci-3-alkoxy group or a hydroxy group,<br>
as well as their racemates or separately present stereoisomers and optionally their physiologically compatible salts or their prodrugs.<br>
The designation halogen atom or halogen means a fluorine, chlorine, bromine or iodine atom. A fluorine, chlorine or bromine atom is preferred.<br>
The C1-C3-alkyl groups and the C1-C5-alkyl groups can be straight-chain or branched and stand for a methyl, ethyl, n-propyl, iso-propyl, n-butyl, iso-butyl, tert-butyl or n-pentyl, 2,2-dimethylpropyl, 2-m++9ethylbutyl or 3-methylbutyl group.<br>
A methyl or ethyl group is preferred.<br>
Radicals R1 and R2 preferably mean hydrogen, C1-3-alkyl, halogen or hydroxy. Especially preferred are hydrogen, methyl, chlorine and hydroxy.<br>
Thus, a special subject of the invention relates to compounds of general formulas lla and Mb, in which R1 and R2, independently of one another, preferably mean hydrogen, C1-3alkyl, halogen or hydroxy.<br><br>
Compounds of formulas I and lib, in which R1 and R2, independently of one another, mean hydrogen, methyl, chlorine or hydroxy, are especially preferred.<br>
One special aspect of this invention are the compounds of general formula Ha. The term "local" comprises any possible administration of the compounds according to the invention that makes possible direction penetration of the active ingredient at the site of action.<br>
The compounds of general formulas (Ha) und (lib) according to the invention can be present as different stereoisomers because of the presence of asymmetry centers. Both the racemates and the separately present stereoisomers belong to the subject of this invention.<br>
The separately present stereoisomers, i.e., (+)-enantiomers and (-)-enantiomers, in particular of Examples 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 11 and 12, are a special subject of this invention.<br>
The compounds according to the invention, if they contain a hydroxy group in opposition to the quinolinyl- or isoquinolinyl-nitrogen atom, are also distinguished by the presence of a keto-enol-tautomerism. In terms according to the invention, both forms are part of the subject of the invention, even if, e.g., in the experimental part, only one of the two tautomeric forms has been cited.<br>
In particular, subjects of this invention are:<br>

The process for the production of the compounds of WO98/54159, WOOO/32584 and WO02/10143 can also be used for the production of the compounds according to the invention. For the linkage of the quinoline or isoquinoline group that is characteristic of the compounds according to the invention, the following process steps can be implemented:<br>
Title compounds (IIa) and (IIb) can be synthesized by, for example, reductive amination of the compound of formula (III) with 5-aminoquinolines or 5-<br><br>
aminoisoquinolines, whereby, e.g., sodium borohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride are <br>
considered to he reducing agents in the presence of an acid<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The synthesis of aldehyde is accomplished, for example, starting from compound (IV) (WO0032584) by cleavage of the methyl ether, allylation of the resulting phenol (V), rearrangement of allyl ether (VI) to (VII), dihydroxylation and glycol cleavage of the double bond with formation oflactol (VIII), reduction of lactol to diol (IX), ring closure to dihydrobenzofuran (X), reduction of ester to alcohol (XI), which finally is oxidized to aldehyde (III).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br><br>
The above-cited esters are preferably ethyl esters but can be esters of type -COOR3, whereby RJ means C1-C5-alkyl.<br>
A special subject of the invention is the production of compounds of general formulas (IIa) and (IIb), by the aldehyde (III) being reacted under conditions of reductive amination, optionally in two stages, with a 5-aminoquinoline derivative or a 5-aminoisoquinoline derivative<br><br><br>
 (Figure Removed)<br><br>
whereby R1 and R2 have the meanings that are indicated for the compounds of formulas Ilaand lib in claim 1.<br>
Another subject of the invention is the production of aldehyde (III), which can be obtained by reduction of the compound of general formula X - used as a chiral compound or as a racemate - in which R3 means C1-C5-alkyl, according to methods that are known to one skilled in the art to form alcohol (XI) and subsequent oxidation also according to methods of one skilled in the art to form aldehyde, or by reduced reduction, according to methods known to one skilled in the art, of ester X directly to the aldehyde.<br>
Another subject of the invention is the process for the production of the compound of general formula X, which can be obtained by Friedel-Crafts alkylation of 5-fluoro-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran and then subjected to an enantiomer separation.<br>
An alternative process for the production of the compounds of formulas Ha and lib is performed as follows:<br>
Isobutene is reacted with use of a Lewis acid catalyst, for example TiCU, Ti(OR3)4, TiCI2(OR3)2, TiBr2(OR3)2, PdCl4, Pd(OR3)4, PdCl2(OR3)2, PdBr2(OR3)2, ZnCl2, XnBr2, A1C13, AlBr3, AIEtCl2, Al Me2Cl, Cu salts, e.g., Cu(OTf)2, CuCl2, CuBr2,<br><br>
Tfb, chiral catalysts, such as, e.g., (BTNOL)2TiCl2, (BINAP)2TiCl2, (BINOL)2PdCl2, (BINAP)2PdCl2, (BINOL)2TiBr2, (BrNAP)2TiBr2, (BINOL)2PdBr2, (BINAP)2PdBr2, preferably FeCl3, whereby R3 means C1-C5-alkyl, with trifluoroethyl pyruvate to form 2-hydroxy-4-methyl-2-trifluoromethylpent-4-enoic acid ethyl ester XII. This reaction product is then reacted in an additional reaction step with 5-fluoro-2,3-dihydrobenzofuran to obtain a compound of formula (X). Reduction of the ester to alcohol (XI) and subsequent oxidation to aldehyde (III) or reduction of ester (X) to aldehyde (III) according to methods that are common to one skilled in the art develop with the aldehyde the direct precursors for the compounds of general formulas Ha and lib, which then can be obtained by reaction of aldehyde (III) with the corresponding quinolinamine or isoquinolinamine under conditions of reductive amination, as already described in the prior art. In the stage of ester (XII) or ester (X), an enantiomer separation can be performed. Also, alcohol (XI) is suitable for an enantioiner separation. A separate insertion of the chiral esters then leads to the enantiomer-pure compounds of general formulas Ha and lib.<br>
Another subject of the invention is a process for the production of compounds of general formula XII, in which R3 means C1-C5-alkyl, by isobutene being reacted with use of a Lewis acid catalyst with trifluoroalkyl pyruvate and the reaction product being separated into the enantiorners.<br>
As solvents for the reaction of isobutene with trifluoroethyl pyruvate, for example, CH2C12, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and diethyl ether are suitable.<br>
A special aspect of the invention is the use of chiral Lewis acid catalysts for the process according to the invention.<br>
One aspect of the invention is that the enantiomer separation is carried out in any stage of the synthesis using column chromatography on a chiral phase. The separation<br><br>
in the stage of the compound of formula Ha or lib is a special aspect of the invention. The enaritiomer separation in the stage of ester XII or X is another important aspect of the invention.<br>
Another aspect of the invention is the separation of suitable racemic intermediate stages of the synthesis using chiral adjuvants. The racemic intermediate stages can be converted either with chiral adjuvants, e.g., bases into diastereomeric salts, or with chiral adjuvants into diastereomers, which then are subjected to a diastereomer separation. The chiral auxiliary reagent is then cleaved again and can be recovered.<br>
Suitable chiral auxiliary reagents are known to one skilled in the art and can be found in, for example, the book "Chiral Auxiliaries and Ligands in Asymmetric Synthesis" by J. Seyden-Penne, Wiley Verlag, New York (1995).<br>
Suitable intermediate stages for the separation of racemic intermediate stages are, for example:<br>
a)	All precursors that have at least one alcohol function; in this connection, chiral<br>
acids are suitable as auxiliary reagents.<br>
b)	Aldehyde precursors, such as, e.g., aldehyde (II), which is obtained after<br>
reduction of the ester to alcohol (XI) and subsequent oxidation to aldehyde (III)<br>
or reduction of ester (X) to aldehyde (III); other ester precursors in addition<br>
optionally also can be converted into the aldehydes for enantiomer separation.<br>
In this respect, auxiliary reagents are chiral diols that then form diasteromeric<br>
ketals, which can be separated and then cleaved again.<br>
c)	All acids that optionally can be obtained from the ester precursors by cleavage of<br>
the existing ester function or by oxidation of compounds of lower oxidation<br>
stages according to methods that are known to one skilled in the art;<br>
Chiral alcohols or chiral amines can be used here as auxiliary reagents.<br><br>
d)  All precursors that contain an ester function can be converted by re-esterification into diastereomeric esters and then can be treated as described under c). If the compounds according to the invention are present as racemic mixtures, they can be separated into the pure, optically active forms according to the methods of racemate separation that are familiar to one skilled in the art. For example, the racemic mixtures can be separated into pure isomers by chromatography on an even optically active carrier material (CHIRALPAK AD ). Suitable precursors are compounds of general formulas III, IV, V, VI, VII, VIII, IX, X and XL<br>
It is also possible to esterify the free hydroxy group in a racemic compound of general formulas (Ha) and (lib) or a suitable precursor with an optically active acid and to separate the diastereoisomeric esters that are obtained by fractionated crystallization or by chromatography and to saponify the separated esters in each case to the optically pure isomers. As optically active acid, for example, mandelic acid, camphorsulfonic acid or tartaric acid can be used. The auxiliary reagent optionally can be recovered as known to one skilled in the art.<br>
Thus, a special subject of the invention is a process, as represented in one of the two above-described alternatives, which is characterized in that the diastereomer separation is performed in any suitable stage by esterification of an alcohol function with a chiral acid, separation of diastereomers and saponification with or without recovery of the chiral auxiliary reagent.<br>
In the case that the compounds of general formulas (IIa) and (IIb) are present as salts, this can be, for example, in the form of hydrochloride, sulfate, nitrate, phosphate, pivalate, rnaleate, fumarate, tartrate, benzoate, mesylate, citrate or succinate.<br>
Prodrugs are defined as compounds that are optionally changed only slightly compared to the claimed compounds, lie within or outside the range of equivalence of<br><br>
me claims, and are cleaved into the compounds that are claimed by metabolism in the organism or by contact with the organism. The prodrugs are subject to at least one biotransformatory step until the claimed compounds are released, which then exert their pharmacological effect.<br>
The binding of the substances to the glucocorticoid receptor (GR) and other steroid hormone receptors (mineral corticoid receptor (MR), progesterone receptor (PR) and androgen receptor (AR)) is examined with the aid of recombinantly produced receptors. The binding experiments are with extracts from Sf9 cells, which had been infected with baculoviruses that contain the coding sequences for the respective steroid hormone receptor. In comparison to the reference substance [ H]-dexamethasone, the substances show a high to very high affinity to GR.<br>
Moreover, the quinolines and isoquinolines of formulas (Ha) and (lib) that are described here show a high selectivity for the glucocorticoid receptor.<br>
The GR-mediated inhibition of the transcription of cytokines, adhesion molecules, enzymes and other pro-inflammatory factors is considered to be an essential molecular mechanism for the anti-inflammatory action of glucocorticoids. This inhibition is produced by an interaction of the GR with other transcription factors, e.g., AP-1 and NF-kappa-B (for an overview, see Cato, A. C. B. and Wade, E., BioEssays 18, 371-378, 1996).<br>
The compounds of general formulas (IIa) and (IIb) according to the invention inhibit the secretion of the cytokine IL-8, induced by lipopolysaccharide (LPS), in the human monocyte cell line THP-1. The concentration of the cytokines was determined in the supernatant by means of commercially available ELISA kits. (Efficiency of dexamethasone = 100%); Example 1, ICso = 5.9 nmol (74% efficiency); Example 10,<br><br>
ICso -21 nmol (86% efficiency); Example 11, ICso = 8.5 nmol (61% efficiency); prednisolone, ICso -- 13 nmol (96% efficiency).<br>
The anti-inflammatory actions of the compounds of general formulas (Ila) and (IFb) were tested in the animal experiment by tests in the croton-oil-induced inflammation in rats and/or mice (J. Exp. Med. (1995), 182, 99-108). To this end, croton oil in ethanolic solution was applied topically to the animals' ears. The test substances were administered locally at the same time. After 16-24 hours, the ear weight was measured as a measurement for the inflammatory edema, the peroxidase activity as a measurement for the invasions of granulocytes and the elastase activity as a measurement for the invasion of neutrophilic granulocytes. In this test, the compounds of general formulas (Ila) and (lib) inhibit the three above-mentioned inflammation parameters after local administration.<br>
One of the most frequent undesirable actions of a glucocorticoid therapy is the so-called "steroid diabetes" [cf. Hatz, H. J., Glucocorticoide: Immunologische Grundlagen, Pharmakologie und Therapierichtlinien [Glucocorticoids: Immunological Principles, Pharmacology and Therapy Guidelines], Wissenschaftliche Verlagsgesellschaft mbH, Stuttgart, 1998].   The reason for this is the stimulation of gluconeogenesis in the liver by induction of the enzymes that are responsible for this and by free amino acids that are produced from the degradation of proteins (catabolic action of glucocorticoids), A key enzyme of the catabolic metabolism in the liver is the tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT). The activity of this enzyme can be determined photometrically from cell cultures of treated rat hepatoma cells. The cells are treated for 24 hours with the test substances, and then the TAT activity is measured. The compounds of general formulas (IIa) and (IIb) induce the trysoinaminotransferase in this test to a slight extent (efficiency of dexamethasone = 100%); Example 1, ECso = 3.7<br><br>
nmol (93% efficiency); Example 10, ECso = 10 nmol (92% efficiency); Example 11, EC.so : 4.0 nmol (86% efficiency); prednisolone, ECso = 2.6 nmol (103% efficiency).<br>
Another undesirable action that occurs especially after local therapy is the induction of a skin atrophy, which leads to the skin's loss of thickness, elasticity, and ultimately the mechanical resistance of the skin. The potential of a substance to induce skin atrophy can be determined in rats. The animals are treated for 18 days daily and locally in equieffective dosages with the test substances. By means of a skin fold thickness measurement, the reduction of the skin thickness over the treatment time can be tracked.<br>
In comparison to clobetasol propionate, which, at a concentration of 0.01% (maximum anti-inflammatory action is achieved), results in a 65% reduction of the skin thickness, only a 41 % reduction can be determined in Example 1 at a concentration of 0.1% (maximum anti-inflammatory action is achieved).<br>
This advantage can also be seen relative to the substances from the application WO 03/082827; for example, the eutomer of Example 36, already at a concentration of 0.06% (maximum anti-inflammatory action), induces a 60% reduction in skin thickness.<br>
