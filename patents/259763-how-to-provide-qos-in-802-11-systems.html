				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to how to provide QoS in 802,11 systems.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network protocol enables wireless communications between access points and mobile terminals within a cell. IEEE 802.11 provides two methods for accessing the access points by the mobile terminal. The distributed coordination function (DCF) enables a number of units to simultaneously contend for access to the network. The point coordination function (PCF) allows an access point to control access to the network. While existing access points can distribute bandwidth between mobile terminals within a cell using the point coordination function, currently most 802,11 products do not support the polling mechanism that is used in the point coordination function. This leaves a system that may only be used to control downlink traffic and has very restricted possibilities with respect to QoS.<br>
The IEEE 802.11 standard presently provides no explicit support for quality of service (QoS). A new standard is currently being worked on that would provide QoS support. However, this update is far from being implemented and support for QoS will not exist for a long time. Thus, there is a need for a system that will support systems having no QoS abilities and For systems that may partially support QoS and for providing some type of differentiated quality of service support within the existing 802.11 infrastructure for devices that do not support the polling mechanism of the point coordination, function.<br>
Apart from the IEEE 802.11 Wireless LAN protocol used by the end user of the wireless terminal, the IP, the UDP, the RTP (Real-Time Transport Protocol}<br>
and the TCP protocol are well known protocols. SUMMARY<br>
A method for providing quality of service in a 802.11 wireless local area network, comprising the steps of processing received data from at least one mobile terminal (MT, N4TI, MT2 25, 25a) using a quality of service proxy; characterized in that providing a differentiated quality of service operation to at least one selected mobile terminal, the method comprising the steps of receiving a frame via the quality of service proxy from the at least: one mobile terminal; and discarding the received frame.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
Referring now to the drawings, and more particularly to Fig  1, there is illustrated an example of a network environment that uses the I1IEE 802.1 1 wireless local area network standard.  A wireless LAN system 10 typically consists of a number of cells 15 each having at least one access point (A.P) 20 within each cell 15. Mobile terminals (MT) 25 can associate with a particular access point 20 and obtain access to the services provided by the access point 2') connecting to a wired network (not shown). The access points 20 and mobile terminals 25 are sometime:; referred to as stations (STAs).  In the following, I he term "station" or "STA." is used when referring to both access points and mobile terminals rather than when each of these are referred to individually.<br>
As mentioned previously, the IEEE 802.1 1 standard provides Iwo methods for accessing the wireless medium, namely, the distributed coordination funtion (DCF) and the point coordination function (PCF). The distributed coordination function is a carrier sense multiple access with collision avoidance scheme were all STAs simultaneously contend for access to the wireless medium. 'I he STAs listen to the wireless medium for a specified amount or time and when it is not busy, an STA begins transmitting. When collisions occur, a back off mechanism is used to reduce the risk of further collisions. There is in principle no way to predict when a transmission of a certain frame will occur or how much bandwidth a certain STA will obtain since access to the wireless medium is dependent on the amount of contention from other STAs in a cell.  It is also not possible, to differentiate between STAs since all STAs contend using the same rules irrespective of the type or amount of data for transmission.<br>
The point coordination function enables an access point 20 fo issue a contention free period (CFP) providing the access point 20 control over the wireless medium. This is illustrated in Fig. 2 wherein a beacon 30 t'/ansmitted by The access point 20, establishes the contention free period 35 within a particular odl.  The contention free period 35 ends upon expiration of a CFP maximum duiatiou period or upon transmission of a CF-end frame 40 by the access point 20.   The contention period 45 is then in effect wherein the distributed coordination function is used for communications until a next beacon 50 is transmitted by an access point '20. During the contention free period 35 the access point 20 car; transmit downlink (AP to MT) but the mobile terminals 25 are not allowed to transmit: uplink (MT to AP) traffic unless they are polled by the access point 20. Thus, using die point coordination function, the access point 20 has control over both the uplink and downlink scheduling.<br>
Since there is no support in IEEE 802.1 1 for explicit distribution of bandwidth between mobile terminals 25 in a cell, there is a need to use some type quality of service proxy 26 (Fig. 1) l.o act as an intermediate between peers thai act in quality of service functions. The quality ot service proxv 26 may be situated in the access point 20, in an intermediate note such as a router. Tins solution may cause the mobile terminals 25 to experience different bandwidth, delay, packet eaor rate etc, but the 802.11 layers within the mobile terminal will not be aware of any quality of service differentiation.<br>
Several possible implementations of a proxy are available.   With respect lo the following discussions, references will be made between preferred users and regular users with respect to corresponding mobile terminals 25   A preferred user, for example, has a more expensive subscription with a WLAN provider than a regular user and will thus receive preferred treatment within a cell 15.   A distinction may also be made between different types of categories, of data, e.g._ high priority and low priority, but for purposes of the following discussion, reference will only be made to the user. The access point 20 can use the MA' address of the mobile terminals 25 to distinguish between users and/or IEEE<br>
S02. IQ-tags to distinguish between traffic categories.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 3, there is illustrated a first embodiment when s proxy 26 is implemented within the access point 20. Upon reception of s frame 60 from ,1 regular mobile terminal 25 during a contention period, the access point 20 discards the frame at 65 without transmitting an acknowledgment message to the regular mobile terminal 25 user. When the mobile terminal 25 does not receive an acknowledgment for transmission of the frame, the mobile terminal 25 will increase its contention window at 70 and retransmit the frame from the mobile terminal 25 to the access point 20 at 75. The larger contention window implies a longer back off time. The back off time determines the time during which the wireless medium has lu be idle before an STA is allowed to transmit. Within a cell 15 having a lot of contention, this will cause the total contention to decrease, and mobile terminals 25 that have not increased their contention window, including all preferred mobile terminals, will have an advantage in accessing the wireless medium.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 4, there is illustrated an alternative embodiment ol an implementation of a proxy 26 wherein upon receipt of a frame 80 a I the access point 20 from a regular mobile terminal 25 during the contention period, the access point 20 acknowledges at 85 the received frame as normal to the mobile terminal 25 but: discards the frame at 90 and does not forward the frame to a wired network connected to the access point. This acts ;o decrease the pace at which higher layers of the protocol transmit the data. This decreases the pace at which data is transmitted by a TCP sender. This also reduces the amount of data transmitted onio the wireless medium by the regular mobile terminal and because of that the other mobile terminals, including the preferred mobile terminals, will experience less contention.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 5, there is illustrated yet a further embodiment for implementation of a proxy, wherein upon reception of a frame 95 from a regular mobile terminal 25 during a contention period, the access point 20 forwards the received frame at 100 to a wired local area network 105 but pie-veuls transmission<br>
of an acknowledgment back to the regular mobile terminal sender 25. The response will be essentially the same as that described with respect 1.0 Pig. 3, wherein the mobile terminal 25 will increase its contention window ar 1 10 and retransmit the frame to the access point 20 at 11.5. The difference between this and-tlie example of Fig. '? will be noticeable on the higher layers, for example, un the RTT estimates of the TCP layers.<br>
Each time an access point 20 begins a contention free period 35 as described above with respect to Fig. 2, all mobile terminals 2.5 within a cell set their network allocation vector (NAV) to protect the wireless medium during the contention free period. As described above, the contention free period ends when the CFP maximum duration expires or when the access point 20 transmits a CF End frame to the broadcast address. The mobile terminals 25 will, upon reception of a CF-End frame, reset, their network allocation vector and open the. wireless medium to DCF contention.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 6, in order to provide quality of service, the access point 20 may transmit unicast CF frames addressed to preferred mobile terminals 25. This will cause the mobile terminals that receive the CF End frames !.o reset, their network allocation vector and start using distributed coordination function.   If only selected mobile terminals receive unicasl CF-End frames, while all other mobile terminals still have their network allocation vector set and are prevented from transmitting, the selected mobile terminals will have privileged access to (he wireless medium.<br>
The beacon is sent periodically at times denoted by the Target Beacon Transmit Time (TBTT). At each TBTT, an access point 20 must wait for the wireless medium to become idle prior to transmitting the beacon 180.  Thus, as illustrated in Fig. 6, at the occurrence of TBTT 120, the network allocation vectors are set for all mobile terminals associated with a particular access point 20. Absent any further actions, the NAV will be set for each of I he mobile terminals 25 for the entire period of time indicated at 125. If the access point 20 transmits a unicast CF-End frame to mobile terminal 1 at 130. Mobile terminai 1 resets its NAV and then<br><br>
uses the distributed coordination function for time period ' 'M .  When access point 20 transmits a unicast CF-End frame to mobile terminal 2 ai 140, both mobile terminal 1 and mobile terminal 2 use the distributed coordination function at N5. Prior to transmission of the broadcast CF-End frame at 1.50, only mobile terminal ! and mobile terminal 2 are using the distributed coordination function and hence have easier access to the wireless medium.  All other mobile terminals 25 arc only-able to communicate with the access point 20 when polled.  After the broadcast, the end frame is transmitted at 150 and all mobile terminals may begin using the distributed coordination function for time period I 55 until a next beacon 100 is received.<br>
Referring now to Figs. 7-9, a further embodiment of a proxy is illustrated wherein during a contention period, the network allocation vector i;i used to piotect. the wireless medium for the duration of a frame exchange sequence. An STA thai receives a frame that is not addressed to the STA is required lo update its NAV value using the value in the duration /ID field 165 as shown in Fig. 7 of the received frame.<br>
An access point 20 may give prioritized access to a given mobile terminal 25 by transmitting a frame to the mobile terminal with a value in ths duration/ID field 165 indicates a time period that is larger than required.   Thus, as shown in Fig. 8, when an access point 20 transmits a frame to the first mobile terminal 25a, the one or more STAs also receiving the frame set their network allocation value m accordance with the received value.  Since the intended recipient mobile terminal 25a of the frame does not update its NAV, and the extended NAV will not affect the mobile terminal 25a to which the frame has been, addressed.  The address mobile terminal 25a will have priority access for the duration of the NAV<br>
This mobile terminal 25a will have sole access to the wireless medium for as long as the extended NAV lasts, as illustrated in Fig. 9. The time T denotes the time during which all other mobile terminals have set their NAV and mobile terminal 25a has exclusive access to the wireless medium. The regular NAV denotes the NAV that would have been set by standard usage of the duration field.<br>
Extended NAV denotes the NAV as set by the above proposed proxy.   The time T in Figure 9 should be longer than DIPS + CW*slot_time to guarantee that the DCF mechanism in mobile terminal 25a can start a transmission during.time period T. CW is the contention window, DIPS is the DCF interframe spacing and slot_time.is the 802.11 'SlotTime. This described system would provide an implicit polling of the mobile terminal 25a.<br>
Fig. 10 shows one protocol stack 200 of a mobile terminal and the corresponding protocol stack 210 at the AP, and a protocol stack of a peer end user 200 located at the wired LAN 220. As it can be seen the AP 210 utilizes one type of MAC and physical layer for the wired side 250 and the 802.11 MAC and physical layer 260 for the wireless side. It can also be seen that the. IP layer as well as the TCP layer are transparent through the AP 210.<br>
In the following embodiment the QoS Proxy modifies the ToS (Type of Service) field in the IP version 4 header, as seen in Fig. 1 L Prior to transmitting, or relaying, a received IP datagram the QoS Proxy modifies the TcS field. For a preferred user the QoS Proxy will modify the ToS field to indicate a high QoS class, whilst for a regular user the QoS Proxy will modify the ToS field to indicate a low QoS class. The ToS field is currently used for negotiating bandwidth properties such as delay and throughput according to DiffServ mechanism, RFC (Informational) no. 2475, which is implemented in many routers, By adjusting the'. ToS field the packets from the terminal 200 will be subject to a lower service level towards peer 220. It is also possible to enhance the service for given terminal 200 by adjusting the ToS field correspondingly. It should be noted that the QoS proxy will recalculate the checksum of IP datagrams in order to reflect the manipulated ToS field and still allow checksum operations to be carried out.<br>
Similar to the implementation above, where EP version 6 is used, the QoS Proxy modifies the Traffic Class field in the IP version 6 header, see Fig. 12. For a preferred user the QoS Proxy will modify the Traffic Class field to indicate a high<br>
QoS class, whilst for a regular user the QoS Proxy will modify the Trafic Class field to indicate a low QoS class.<br>
In another embodiment: the QoS Proxy will deliberately delay IP datagram or drop IP datagram lor regular users, i.e. users of a low QuS al.iocal.ion. The deliberate delaying of IP datagrams will have the effect that the pace by which the-higher layers of the sending end which delivers IP datagrams to the IP protocol; e.g. TCP, will decrease the transmitting pace. The increasing round trip time foi regular, i.e. low QoS, users will result in a shorter round trip lime for preferred users, i.e. high QoS users.<br>
The effect of dropping IP datagrams may result in a retransmission from the higher layer of the sending end user and in a decreased pace by which the higher layer of (he sending end user delivers IP datagrams to the !P protocol. This will also cause benefits for the preferred users.<br>
By combining the mechanisms of modifying the ToS field. Traffic Class field, deliberately delaying IP datagram and deliberately chopping IP datagrams, a powerful toolbox: is given to the QoS Proxy. The behavior of the QoS Proxy may be determined by the higher layer protocol above the IP layer, E.g. regular n.sers using TCP may be given precedence over regular users using KTP. or I..JDP, or any combination thereof.<br>
It can also be noted that the behavior of the QoS Proxy may be determined according to the lower layer statistics. For instance the IEEE -802. 11 Busy/Idle threshold may determine the delay of IP datagram such that il the Busy/Idle threshold is high more IP datagram are delayed compared to when the Busy/Idle threshold is lower.<br>
In another embodiment the QoS Proxy will split flic TCP connection that spans from the wireless mobile terminal via the A.P to e.g. a peer entity in the wiml LAN into 2 TCP connections. The split will occur in the QoS Proxy and result in 2 TCP connections. The QoS Proxy will then relay TCP segment: floating back, and forth from the wireless mobile terminal, and as seen from both end users act as any other peer TCP sender or receiver.<br>
Similar to the case where the QoS Proxy modifies the Too field in the IP version 4 header, (he QoS Proxy can modify the window field in the TCP header, see Fig. 13.<br>
The window field determines an upper limit to the amount of outstanding data for the sender and consequently an upper limit to its' packet transmission rate-By increasing the window field for preferred users and/or decreasing the window field for regular users, the preferred users may perceive a higher throughput of tin-TCP layer and thus an increased QoS.<br>
It can be noted that apart, from actually changing the window field when relaying a TCP segment, the QoS Proxy could also influence- the communicufing end users to change the window field. This coiild for example be done by explicitly controlling links towards the end users.<br>
It is believed that the operation and construction of the present, invention will be apparent from the foregoing description and, while the invention shown and described herein has been characterized as particular embodiments, changes and modifications maybe made therein without departing from the invention as defined in the following claims.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
