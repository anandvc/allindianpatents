The present invention relates to an armature coil conductor arraying apparatus and method which is used, e.g., when assembling an armature of an engine starter, to align and array a plurality of armature coil conductors into such a condition as enabling the conductors to be inserted to slots   of   an  armature   core.<br>
Description  of   the  Related   Art<br>
Fig. 5 is a schematic view showing a prior art cutting apparatus for a coil conductor. Referring to Fig. 5, an armature coil conductor, i.e., a coil conductor 2, housed in a bobbin 1 is drawn out of the bobbin 1 by feed rollers 3 through a predetermined distance and is stopped there. An insulating coating on an outer periphery of the coil conductor 2 is then stripped off by a helical reamer 4 over a length of 2L. After that, the coil conductor 2 is cut by a cutter 5 at the center of the stripped length of 2L. As shown in Fig. 6, therefore, the coil conductor 2 after being cut has opposite end portions in each of which the insulating   coating  is   stripped  off   over   a   length  of   L.<br>
The    cut    coil    conductors    2    are   each   bent    into   a    U-form <br>
(hairpin     form),      as     shown     in     Fig.      7.	The     bent     coil<br>
conductors 2 are set in a coil twist tool 6 in a radial pattern, shown in Fig. 8, along an entire circumference. At this time, one linear portion of each coil conductor 2 is inserted  to   a   groove   in   an   inner  twist   tool   7   and  the   other<br><br>
linear portion is inserted to a groove in an outer twist tool 8. After that, an air cylinder 9 is operated to move a rack 10 for rotating a gear 11 held in mesh with the rack 10. With rotation of the gear 11, the inner twist tool 7 is rotated relative to the outer twist tool 8 and all the coil conductors 2 are shaped at a time. Then, by operating the air cylinder 12 so as to push back the rack 10 a little, unsteady motion between the inner and outer twist tools 7, 8 and the coil conductors 2 is eliminated, and changes in shape of the coil conductors 2 due to springbucks are corrected.<br>
Next, as shown in Fig. 9, the coil conductors 2 are<br>
inserted to slots (not shown) of an armature core 13. Then,<br>
projected portions of the coil conductors 2 extending<br>
through the armature core 13 are shaped, and the end<br>
portions of the coil conductors 2 where the insulating<br>
coatings have been stripped off are connected to a<br>
commentator     14.	The     slots     of     the     armature     core     13     are<br>
provided with egual intervals therebetween in the circumferential direction, and are each divided into an inner peripheral part and an outer peripheral part by an insulating material (not shown). The coil conductors 2 are each arranged such that one linear portion, i.e., an inner leg, is inserted to the inner peripheral part of one slot and the other linear portion, i.e., an outer leg, is inserted to the outer peripheral part of another slot in a position circumferentially shifted by a predetermined number of   slots   from  the   slot  to  which  the   inner   leg   is   inserted.<br>
However,      the      above-mentioned     prior      art     method      for shaping  and  aligning  the   coil   conductors   2   by  the   coil   twist<br><br>
tool 6 has had a difficulty in shaping all the coil conductors 2 into a predetermined form because the plurality of hairpin-like coil conductors 2 are twisted at a time. Also, a recess (not shown) is often formed in, e.g., an outer periphery of a coil end 2a to receive a ring (not shown) which serves to prevent the coil end 2a from expanding by centrifugal force. But such a recess is hard to form by twisting and requires a separate step for its formation, which means the need of much time and labor. Further, an apparatus and a method for combining and arraying the coil conductors 2 completely shaped into such a condition as enabling the coil conductors to be inserted to the slots of the armature core 13 have not yet been proposed.<br>
SUMMARY   OF   THE   INVENTION<br>
In view of solving the problems as set forth above, an object of the present invention is to provide an armature coil conductor arraying apparatus and method which can use coil conductors of a’ desired shape and which can surely and smoothly   settle   and   array  the   coil   conductors.<br>
An armature coil conductor arraying apparatus of the present invention comprises a cylindrical coil guide tool having a plurality of inner insertion holes which are provided with equal intervals therebetween in the circumferential direction and to which inner legs as one linear portions of substantially U-shaped coil conductors shaped into a predetermined form are inserted, and a plurality of outer grooves provided radically outwardly of the    inner    insertion    holes    in   respective    outer    peripheries<br><br>
thereof; a cylindrical holder provided radially outwardly of the coil guide tool and being rotatable about an axis of the coil guide tool; and a plurality of guide members mounted to an inner peripheral surface of the holder with equal intervals therebetween in the circumferential direction for pressing and guiding outer legs as the other linear portions of the coil conductors and rotating the coil conductors about the inner legs so that the outer legs are inserted to the   outer   grooves,   when   the  holder   is   rotated.<br>
An armature coil conductor arraying method of the present invention comprises the steps of holding inner legs as one linear portions of a plurality of substantially U-shaped coil conductors shaped into a predetermined form on the same circumference with intervals therebetween, and pressing outer legs as the other linear portions of the coil conductors in the same circumferential direction at a time, for thereby rotating the coil conductors about the inner legs .<br>

DETAILED   DESCRIPTION   OF   PREFERRED   EMBODIMENT<br>
An embodiment of the present invention will hereinafter be described with reference to the drawings. Fig. 1 is a schematic view showing an armature coil conductor arraying apparatus according to one embodiment of the present invention,   and  Fig.   2   is   a   sectional   view  of   Fig.    1.<br>
An arraying apparatus 21 of the present invention is<br>
disposed above a magazine (arraying tool) 20 for housing<br>
coil conductors 2 in a radial pattern, which have been<br>
shaped into such a predetermined form as enabling the coil<br>
conductors 2 to be directly inserted to slots of the<br>
armature     core     13      (Fig.     9)  .	The     coil     conductors     2     are<br>
supported by a coil pusher 22 of the magazine 20. The coil<br>
pusher 22 is vertically movable by an air cylinder (not<br>
shown).	The    magazine     20     has    an    annular     space     defined<br>
between two concentric cylinders for housing the shaped coil conductors 2 which are held therein such that their legs are inserted to axial grooves defined in inner and outer cylindrical   walls.<br><br>
A   cylindrical   inner   coil   holder   23    is   provided   at   the<br>
center     of     the     arraying    apparatus     21.	Along     an    outer<br>
periphery of the inner coil holder 23, as shown in Figs. 3 and 4, there are provided inner insertion holes, i.e., inner grooves 23a each having a U-shaped cross-section, to which the inner legs (one linear portions) of the coil conductors 2 are inserted, with equal intervals therebetween in the circumferential direction. First chamfers 23b for smoothly guiding distal end portions of the inner legs of the coil conductors 2 into the inner grooves 23a are defined at edge portions   of   the   inner  grooves   23a.<br>
The inner coil holder 23 is surrounded by a cylindrical outer coil holder 24. The outer coil holder 24 is rotatable with respect to the inner coil holder 23 so as to assume respective states shown in Figs. 3 and 4. Along an outer periphery of the outer coil holder 24, outer grooves 24a to which the outer legs (the other^ linear portions) of the coil conductors 2 are inserted are provided with equal intervals therebetween in the circumferential direction. Further, second chamfers 24b are defined in an end face of the outer coil holder 24 for smoothly guiding the distal end portions of the inner legs of the coil conductors 2 into the inner grooves 23a in the state where the second chamfers are combined  with   the   inner   grooves   23a   as   shown   in   Fig.   3.<br>
A coil guide tool 25 is made up by the inner and outer coil holders 23, 24. A cylindrical holder 26 is provided radially outwardly of the coil guide tool 25. The holder 26 is attached to a stationary member 27 through a bearing 28 to be rotatable about an axis of the coil guide tool 25. A plurality   of    guide   members,    i.e.,    settling   plates    29,    are<br><br>
mounted to an inner peripheral surface of the holder 26 with equal intervals therebetween in the circumferential direction. The settling plates 29 are inclined with respect to the radial direction so that, when the holder 26 is rotated clockwise in Fig. 1, the outer legs of the coil conductors 2 are guided by the settling plates 29 while sliding  radially   inwardly  therealong.<br>
An arc-shaped gear 30 having teeth formed along its<br>
outer periphery is fixed to an outer periphery of the holder<br>
26.	Held     in     mesh     with     the     gear     30     is     a     rack     32<br>
reciprocatingly    movable     by     an     air     cylinder     31     as     rack driving   means.<br>
Operation of the illustrated embodiment will be<br>
described      below.	The      coil      conductors      2      cut      into     a<br>
predetermined size are each previously pressed into a predetermined shape suitatple for insertion to the armature core 13. Also, the coil conductors 2 each have a recess formed in its coil end for fitting of the above-mentioned ring. The thus- shaped coil conductors 2 are set in the magazine 20 one by one in a radial pattern. At this time, the inner legs of the coil conductors 2 are arranged in the magazine   20  while   being   positioned   in  place.<br>
When a required number of coil conductors 2 are set in the magazine 20, the magazine 20 is moved to a position below the arraying apparatus 21. Then, the coil conductors 2 are raised by the coil pusher 22 and, simultaneously, the arraying apparatus 21 is lowered, causing the inner legs of the coil conductors 2 to be inserted to the inner grooves 23. On this occasion, the outer coil holder 24 is in a position   shown   in   Fig.   3   where   the   second   chamfers   24b   face<br><br>
the inner grooves 23a, for smooth insertion of the inner legs. Further, upon the insertion of the inner legs to the inner grooves 23a, the outer legs of the coil conductors 2 are each arranged between the settling plates 29 adjacent to each  other.<br>
After that, the outer coil holder 24 is rotated a half pitch with respect to the inner coil holder 23 by an appropriate driving mechanism (not shown)■ such as a gear mechanism or a link mechanism, bringing the inner grooves 23a and the outer grooves 24a into an opposed state as shown in Fig. 4. The rack 32 is then moved by driving the air cylinder 31. The gear 30, the holder 26 and the settling plates   29   are   thereby   rotated   together   as   one  piece.<br>
With the rotation, the outer legs of the coil conductors 2 are pressed by respective inclined side surfaces of the settling plates 29, rotated about the corresponding inner legs, and then settled into the outer grooves 24 of the outer coil holder 24. Finally, each of the outer legs comes into the outer groove 24a shifted from the position of the inner leg of the same coil conductor 2 by a predetermined number of grooves in the circumferential direction, and is prevented from slipping out of the outer groove 24 by being pressed by a distal end portion of the corresponding settling plate 29. It is desired that the settling plate 29 be formed of an elastic member such as a leaf spring for less   strict   demand   for   dimensional   errors.<br>
The coil conductors 2 settled and arrayed by the arraying apparatus 21 are inserted to the slots of the armature   core   13,   followed   by  carrying  to   the  next   step.<br>
Afforriinn    tn    thp    arravinn    anngratus    21    described    above.<br><br>
the coil conductors 2 previously shaped into a predetermined form can surely and smoothly be settled in place. In other words, the coil conductors 2 can be shaped into a desired shape  and  held  in  the  same   shape.<br><br><br><br>
