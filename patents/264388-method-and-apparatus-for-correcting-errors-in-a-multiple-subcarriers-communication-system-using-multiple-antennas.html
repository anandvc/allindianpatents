				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CORRECTING ERRORS IN A MULTIPLE<br>
SUBCARRIERS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM USING MULTIPLE ANTENNAS<br>
[DESCRIPTION]<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a method for correcting errors in a multiple antenna<br>
system based on a plurality of sub-carriers to perform an automatic repeat request scheme,<br>
and a transmitting and receiving apparatus supporting the same.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
Recently, as information communication services have been popularized, a variety of<br>
multimedia services has appeared, and high-quality services have appeared, a demand for a<br>
wireless communication service is rapidly increasing. In order to actively cope with such a<br>
tendency, it is necessary to increase capacity of a communication system and improve<br>
reliability in data transmission. A method of increasing communication capacity in a<br>
wireless communication environment may include a method of finding a new available<br>
frequency band and a method of increasing he efficiency of a restricted resource. As the<br>
latter method, multiple-antenna transmission/reception technologies of mounting a plurality<br>
of antennas in a transceiver to additionally ensure a space for using a resource, thereby<br>
obtaining a diversity gain or transmitting data via each of the antennas in parallel to increase<br>
transmission capacity are attracting much attention and are being actively developed.<br>
Among the multiple-antenna transmission/reception technologies, a general structure<br>
of a multiple-input multiple-output (MEMO) system based on an orthogonal frequency<br>
division multiplexing (OFDM) will now be described with reference to FIG. 1.<br><br>
In a transmitter, a channel encode 101 adds redundant bits to transmission data bits<br>
to reduce influence due to a channel or noise, a mapper 103 converts data bit information into<br>
data symbol information, a serial-to-parallel converter 105 converts data symbols into parallel<br>
data symbols to be carried in a plurality of sub-carriers, and a multiple-antenna encoder 107<br>
converts the parallel data symbols into spac 3-time signals. A multiple-antenna decoder 109,<br>
a parallel-to-serial converter 111, a demapper 113, and a channel decoder 115, which are<br>
included in a receiver, perform the inverse functions of the multiple-antenna encoder 107, the<br>
serial/parallel converter 105, the mapper 103 and the channel encoder 101, respectively.<br>
In a multiple-antenna OFMD system, a variety of technologies of increasing<br>
reliability in data transmission are required. Examples of the technologies include space-<br>
time code (STC), cyclic delay diversity (CDD), antenna selection (AS), antenna hopping<br>
(AH), spatial multiplexing (SM), beamforming (BF), and precoding. Hereinafter, main<br>
technologies will be described in more detail.<br>
The STC is a scheme for obtaining the spatial diversity gain by successively<br>
transrnittmg same signals through different antennas in a multiple antenna environment. The<br>
following determinant represents a basic timo-space symbol used in a system having two<br>
transmitting antennas.<br><br>
In the above determinant, row represents antennas and column represents time slots.<br>
The cyclic delay diversity (CDD) is to abtain a frequency diversity gain at a receiver<br>
by allowing all antennas to transmit OFDM signals at different delay values or different sizes<br>
when a system having a plurality of transmitting antennas transmits the OFDM signals. FIG<br>
2 illustrates a transmitter of a multiple antenna system which uses a cyclic delay diversity<br><br>
(CDD) scheme.<br>
After the OFDM symbols are separately transmitted to each of the antennas through<br>
a serial-to-parallel converter and a multipie antenna encoder, they are added with a cyclic<br>
prefix (CP) for preventing interchannel interference and then transmitted to the receiver. At<br>
this time, a data sequence transmitted to the first antenna is transmitted to the receiver as it is<br>
but a data sequence transmitted to the next antenna is cyclic-delayed by a certain bit and then<br>
transmitted to the receiver.<br>
Meanwhile, if the aforementioned cyclic delay diversity scheme is implemented in a<br>
frequency domain, the cyclic delay can be expressed by the product of phase sequences. In<br>
other words, as shown in FIG 3, data sequences in the frequency domain are multiplied by<br>
predetermined different phase sequences (phase sequence 1 to phase sequence M) which are<br>
differently set according to the antennas, find are subjected to an inverse fast Fourier<br>
transform (IFFT), thereby being transmitted to the receiver. This is called a phase shift<br>
diversity scheme.<br>
According to the phase shift diversity scheme, a flat fading channel can be changed<br>
to a frequency selective channel, and frequency diversity gain or frequency scheduling gain<br>
can be obtained through channel coding. In other words, as shown in FIG 4, if a phase<br>
sequence is generated using cyclic delay of a great value in the phase shift diversity scheme,<br>
since a frequency selective period becomes short, frequency selectivity becomes high, and<br>
after all, the frequency diversity gain can be obtained through channel coding. This is mainly<br>
used in an open loop system.<br>
Also, if a phase sequence is generated using cyclic delay of a small value in the<br>
phase shift diversity scheme, since a frequency selective period becomes long, a closed loop<br><br>
system allocates a resource to the most excellent channel area to obtain a frequency<br>
scheduling gain. In other words, as shown in FIG 4, if a phase sequence is generated using<br>
cyclic delay of a small value in the phase ;shift diversity scheme, a certain sub-carrier area of<br>
a flat fading channel has a great channel size and other sub-carrier areas have a small channel<br>
size. In this case, if an orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) system<br>
which allows a plurality of users transmits a signal through sub-carrier having a great channel<br>
size for each user, a signal to noise ratio (SNR) may increase.<br>
Meanwhile, the precoding scheme includes a codebook based precoding scheme<br>
which is used when feedback information is finite in a closed loop system and a scheme for<br>
quantizing and feeding back channel information. In the codebook based precoding scheme,<br>
an index of a precoding matrix which is previously known to a transmitter/receiver is fed<br>
back to the transmitter to obtain SNR gain.<br>
FIG 5 illustrates the configuration of a transmitter/receiver of a multiple antenna<br>
system which uses the codebook based precoding scheme. The transmitter and the receiver<br>
have finite precoding matrixes P1 to PL The receiver feeds back an optimal precoding<br>
matrix index l to the transmitter by using channel information, and the transmitter applies a<br>
precoding matrix corresponding to the fed-back index to transmission data X1 to XMt. Table<br>
1 illustrates an example of the codebook which is applicable when 3-bit feedback information<br>
is used in an IEEE 802.16e system which supports a spatial multiplexing rate of 2 and has<br>
two transmission antennas.<br>
[Table 1]<br><br><br>
Meanwhile, examples of improving reliability in data transmission in a wireless<br>
communication environment include an Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) scheme and a<br>
hybrid ARQ (HARQ) scheme. These schemes will now be described in detail.<br>
An orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system and its similar<br>
system define resource blocks defined in a time-frequency domain and use the resource<br>
blocks as a single unit In a downlink, a base station allocates at least one resource block to a<br>
specific user equipment in accordance with a given scheduling rule and transmits data<br>
through a corresponding resource block. Also, in an uplink, if the base station selects a<br>
specific user equipment in accordance with a given scheduling rule and allocates a resource<br>
block to the corresponding user equipment, the corresponding user equipment transmits data<br>
to the base station through the allocated resource block. At this time, if frame loss or damage<br>
occurs in the data transmitted to the downlink or the uplink, the ARQ or the HARQ is used to<br>
correct corresponding errors.<br>
Examples of the HARQ scheme include channel-adaptive HARQ/channel-non-<br>
adaptive HARQ and chase combining schme/incremental redundancy scheme. In the<br>
channel-non-adaptive HARQ, frame modulation or the number of available resource blocks<br><br>
for retransmission is performed as it is derennined during initial transmission. The channel-<br>
adaptive HARQ varies the above parameters depending on the current channel status. For<br>
example, according to the channel-non-adaptive HARQ, if a transmitting side transmits data<br>
by using eight resource blocks in case of initial transmission, the transmitting side retransmits<br>
the data by using eight resource blocks even in case of retransmission. According to the<br>
channel-adaptive HARQ, even though the transmitting side transmits data by using eight<br>
resource blocks in case of initial transmission, the transmitting side retransmits the data by<br>
using resource blocks more than or less than eight resource blocks depending on the channel<br>
status.<br>
Furthermore, the HARQ scheme caa be classified into a chase combining scheme<br>
and an incremental redundancy scheme depending on which packet is transmitted during<br>
retransmission. According to the chase combining scheme, as shown in FIG 6, the<br>
transmitting side retransmits a packet having the same format as that used for initial<br>
transmission or same data symbols in different, formats during second or third transmission if<br>
errors occur in the packet used for the initial transmissioa The HARQ scheme is similar to<br>
the ARQ scheme in that the receiving side transmits NCK message to the transmitting side if<br>
the receiving side cannot demodulate a packet. However, the HARQ scheme is different from<br>
the ARQ scheme in that the receiving side stores a frame which is previously received in a<br>
buffer for a certain time period and if a corresponding frame is retransmitted, combines the<br>
retransmitted frame with the previously received frame to improve a receiving success rate.<br>
The incremental redundancy scheme is different from the chase combining scheme in that a<br>
packet having a format different from that of the packet used for initial transmission can be<br>
retransmitted, In other words, as shown in FIG 7, additional parity part of a channel code is<br>
only retransmitted during the second or third retransmission to reduce a channel coding rate,<br><br>
thereby correcting packet errors.<br>
In addition, the HARQ scheme can be classified into synchronous HARQ and<br>
asynchronous HARQ depending on whether retransmission performed after transmission<br>
failure of initial data is performed in accordance with a given timing.<br>
Since the aforementioned multiple; antenna related scheme and the ARQ related<br>
schemes have been developed independently, synergy effect according to combination of the<br>
schemes have not been obtained. In this regard, a time-space symbol based HARQ has been<br>
suggested. The time-space symbol based HARQ is used in a multiple antenna system.<br>
According to the time-space symbol based HARQ, as shown in FIG 8, a data transmission<br>
rate increases through a bell labs layered space time (BLAST) scheme during initial<br>
transmission, and if errors occur in symbols S1 and S2 of a specific time slot, a time-space<br>
symbol is applied to the symbols of the corrssponding time slot and then retransmission is<br>
performed to improve transmission reliability.<br>
However, the aforementioned time-space symbol based HARQ has several problems.<br>
First, the time-space symbol based HARQ has limitation in that it is based on a flat fading<br>
channel whose change speed is relatively slow. Second, if multiple codewords are used, it is<br>
inefficient in that retransmission of all codewords is required even though errors occur only<br>
in some of the codewords. Third, flexibility is deteriorated in that initial transmission should<br>
be performed by a spatial multiplexing scheme such as BLAST. Finally, since the adaptive<br>
ARQ such as incremental redundancy canno: be used for the time-space based HARQ,<br>
efficient error correction cannot be performed.<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention is directed to a method for correcting errors in a<br><br>
multiple antenna system based on a plurality of sub-carriers and a transmitting/receiving<br>

shift based precoding matrix phase shifted at a predetermined phase angle, initially<br>
transmitting each sub-carrier symbol to a receiver in a packet unit by using the phase shift<br>
based precoding matrix, reconstructing the phase shift based precoding matrix to reduce a<br>
spatial multiplexing rate if a negative reception acknowledgement (NACK) is received from<br>
the receiver, and retransmitting the initially transmitted sub-carrier symbol by using the<br>
reconstructed phase shift based precoding matrix. The method may further include applying<br>
offset information fed back from the receiver to the precoding matrix.<br>

receiving apparatus may further include an offset application module applying offset<br>
information fed back from the receiver to the precoding matrix.<br>
In the above aspects, the number of columns corresponding to the reduced spatial<br>
multiplexing rate is selected from the determined phase shift based precoding matrix so that<br>
the precoding matrix is reconstructed to consist of the selected columns only.<br>
Furthermore, if errors occur only in some of the initially transmitted packets, the<br>
retransmitting step includes retransmitting some packets where errors occur but does not<br>
transmit a new packet until retransmission is completed. Also, the retransmitting step may<br>
include retransmitting some packets where errors occur and transmit a new packet. In both<br>
cases, the retransmitting step is performed through antennas other than those through which<br>
the packets where errors occur are transmitted. Also, the retransmitting step may include<br>
selecting antennas having excellent channel status.<br>
Furthermore, the initial transmitting step includes transmitting different sub-carrier<br>
symbols to each antenna, and if errors occur in all of the initially transmitted packets, the<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Reference will now be made in detail to the preferred embodiments of the present<br>
invention, examples of which are illustrated in the accompanying drawings.<br>
The present invention relates to a method for correcting errors in a multiple antenna<br>
system and a transmitting/receiving apparatus supporting the same, which can be applied to a<br>
frequency selective channel whose change is frequent in addition to a flat fading channel, can<br>
be applied to both a single codeword structure and a multi codeword structure, and to which<br><br>
adaptive ARQ can be applied. To this end, in the present invention, a phase shift based<br>
precoding scheme is used, which can reconstruct or change a precoding matrix depending a<br>
spatial multiplexing rate and various kinds of offset information, and if NACK signal is<br>
arrived from a receiver due to transmission errors, there are suggested a first method of<br>
performing retransmission after reconstructing a precoding matrix to reduce the spatial<br>
multiplexing rate and a second method of performing retransmission after changing a<br>
precoding matrix by using predetermined oifset information fed back from a receiver.<br><first embodiment></first>
As described above, cyclic delay diversity or phase shift diversity is advantageous in<br>
that it can be applied to both an open loop system and a closed loop system depending on a<br>
cyclic delay value and can simply be implemented. However, a problem occurs in that a data<br>
transmission rate is reduced due to a spatial multiplexing rate of 1. Also, although codebook<br>
based precoding is advantageous in that efficient data transmission can be performed by<br>
feedback of index, problems occur in that the codebook based precoding is not suitable for a<br>
mobile environment in which channel change is frequent and that memory use increases as a<br>
codebook should be provided at both sides c f a transmitter/receiver. Accordingly, the present<br>
invention suggests a phase shift based preceding method, which can easily change precoding<br>
matrixes depending on circumstances and has advantages of phase shift diversity and<br>
precoding, and a method for correcting errors, which includes ARQ scheme.<br>
Hereinafter, the phase shift based precoding method and the ARQ scheme of the first<br>
method based on the phase shift based precoding method will be described. Subsequently, a<br>
transmitting/receiving apparatus which supports the ARQ scheme of the first method will be<br>
described.<br>
Phase shift based precoding method<br><br>
A phase shift based preceding matrix P suggested in the present invention may be<br>
generalized and expressed as follows.<br>
[Equation 1]<br><br>
where,  denotes a complex weighted value determined<br>
by a sub-carrier index k, Nt denotes the number of transmitting antennas or virtual antennas<br>
(value equal to a spatial multiplexing rate, Nt=R), and R denotes a spatial multiplexing rate.<br>
The complex weighted value may vary depending on OFDM symbols which are multiplied<br>
by the antennas and the index of the corresponding sub-carrier.<br>
Meanwhile, me precoding matrix P of Equation 1 is preferably designed by a unitary<br>
matrix in order to reduce the loss of channel capacity in a multiple antenna system. In order<br>
to check a condition for configuring the unitary matrix, the channel capacity of the multiple<br>
antenna system is expressed by Equation 2.<br>
. [Equation 2]<br><br>
where, H denotes an NrxNt sized multiple antenna channel matrix and Nr denotes the<br>
number of receiving antennas. Equation 3 is obtained by applying the phase shift based<br>
precoding matrix P to Equation 2.<br>
[Equation 3]<br><br><br>
As can be seen from Equation :t, in order to eliminate the loss of the channel<br>
capacity, PPH should become an identity matrix. Accordingly, the phase shift based<br>
precoding matrix P should satisfy Equation 4.<br>
[Equation 4]<br><br>
In order to allow the phase shift based precoding matrix P to become the unitary<br>
matrix, two types of conditions, that is, a power constraint condition and an orthogonality<br>
constraint condition, should be satisfied simultaneously. The power constraint condition<br>
allows the level of each column of the matrix to become 1, and the orthogonality constraint<br>
condition allows the respective columns of the matrix to have orthogonal characteristics.<br>
These are respectively expressed by Equations 5 and 6.<br>
[Equation 5]<br><br>
[Equation 6]<br><br><br>
Next, an example of the generalize equation of a 2x2 phase shift based precoding<br>
matrix is provided, and equations for satisfying the two constraint conditions are obtained as<br>
follows.- Equation 7 shows a generalized equation of a phase shift based precoding matrix<br>
when the number of transmitting antennas is 2 and a spatial multiplexing rate is 2.<br>
[Equation 7]<br><br>
where, αi and βi (i=l, 2) are real numbers, θi (i=1, 2, 3,4) denotes a phase value, and<br>
k denotes a sub-carrier index of an OFDM signal. In order to implement the precoding<br>
matrix with the unitary matrix, the power constraint condition of Equation 8 and the<br>
orthogonality constraint condition of Equation 9 should be satisfied.<br>
[Equation 8]<br><br>
[Equation 9]<br><br>
where, a mark * denotes a conjugate complex number. An example of a 2x2 phase<br><br>
shift based precoding matrix which satisfies Equations 7 to 9 is as follows.<br>
[Equation 10]<br><br>
where, θ2 and θ3 have a relationship expressed by Equation 11 according to the<br>
orthogonality constraint.<br>
[Equation 11]<br><br>
The precoding matrix may be stored in the memories of the transmitter and the<br>
receiver in a codebook form, and the codebook may include a variety of precoding matrixes<br>
generated using different finite values θ2. The values θ2 may properly be set depending on<br>
the channel status and the presence of the feedback information. If the feedback<br>
information is used, the values θ2 are set to small values, and, if the feedback information is<br>
not used, the values θ2 are set to large values whereby a high frequency diversity gain can be<br>
obtained.<br>
Meanwhile, the spatial multiplexing rate may be set to be smaller than the number of<br>
antennas depending on the channel status even though the phase shift based precoding matrix<br>
is generated as shown in Equation 7. In this case, the generated phase shift based precoding<br>
matrix may newly be reconstructed by selecting a number of specific columns corresponding<br>
to the current spatial multiplexing rate (reduced spatial multiplexing rate) from the generated<br>
phase shift based precoding matrix. In other words, a new precoding matrix applied to a<br>
corresponding system is not generated whenever the spatial multiplexing rate varies but the<br>
original phase shift based precoding matrix is used as it is, wherein a specific column of the<br><br>
corresponding precoding matrix is selected to reconstruct the precoding matrix.<br>
For example, the preceding matrix of Equation 10 sets the spatial multiplexing rate<br>
of 2 in a multiple antenna system having two transmitting antennas. However, the spatial<br>
multiplexing rate may be lowered to 1 for :;ome reason. In this case, a specific column of the<br>
matrix shown in Equation 10 may be selec:ed to perform precoding. If the second column is<br>
selected, the phase shift based precoding matrix is equal to Equation 12 below, which<br>
becomes the same format as the cyclic delay diversity scheme of two transmitting antennas<br>
according to the related art.<br>
[Equation 12]<br><br>
Although the example of the system having two transmitting antennas has been<br>
described, application of the present invention can be expanded to a system having four<br>
transmitting antennas. In other words, after the phase shift based precoding matrix is<br>
generated in the system having four transmilting antennas, a specific column may be selected<br>
depending on the variable spatial multiplexiting rate to perform precoding. For example, FIG. 9<br>
illustrates that the related art spatial multiplexing and cyclic delay diversity are applied to a<br>
multiple antenna system having four transmitting antennas and a spatial multiplexing rate of<br>
2, and FIG 10 illustrates that the phase shift based precoding matrix of Equation 10 is applied<br>
to the above multiple antenna system.<br>
Referring to FIG 9, a first sequence S1 and a second sequence S2 are transferred to a<br>
first antenna and a third antenna, and the first sequence  and the second<br><br>
sequence  which are phase-shifted at a predetermined level are transferred to<br>
a second antenna and a fourth antenna. Accordingly, it is noted that the spatial multiplexing<br>
rate becomes 2.<br>
By contrast, referring to FIG. 10,  is transferred to the first<br>
i antenna,  to the secoad antenna, <br>
to the third antenna, and   to the fourth antenna.<br>
Accordingly, since the system of FIG. 10 has an advantage of the cyclic delay diversity<br>
scheme along with an advantage of the precoding scheme as cyclic delay (or phase shift) is<br>
performed for four antennas by using a singl s precoding matrix.<br>
The aforementioned phase shift based precoding matrix for each spatial multiplexing<br>
rate for the two-antenna system and the four- antenna system is expressed as follows.<br><br>
In Table 2, θi(i = 1, 2, 3) denotes a phase angle according to a cyclic delay value,<br><br>
and K is a sub-carrier index of OFDM. In Table 2, each of the four types of the precoding<br>
matrixes can be obtained by a specific part of a precoding matrix for the multiple antenna<br>
system having four transmitting antennas and a spatial multiplexing rate of 2 as shown in FIG.<br>
11. Accordingly, since the codebook does not need each precoding matrix for the four types,<br>
memory capacity of the transmitter and the receiver can be saved. The aforementioned phase<br>
shift based precoding matrix can be expanded to a system having M number of antennas (M<br>
is a natural number greater than 2) and a spatial multiplexing rate of N (N is a natural number<br>
greater than 1) by the same principle.<br>
Although the procedure of configuring the phase shift based precoding matrix<br>
having four transmitting antennas and the spatial multiplexing rate of 2 has been described as<br>
above, the phase shift based precoding may be generalized by Equation 13 below for a<br>
system having Nt number of antennas (Nt is a natural number greater than 2) and a spatial<br>
multiplexing rate of R (R is a natural number greater than 1). Hereinafter, the generalized<br>
phase shift based precoding will be referred to as generalized phase shift diversity (GPSD).<br>
[Equation 13]<br><br>
where, denotes a GPSD matrix for the kth sub-carrier of a MMO-<br>
OFDM signal having Nt number of transmitting antennas and a spatial multiplexing rate of R,<br>
and   is a unitary matrix (second matrix) which satisfies<br><br>
  and is used to allow a phase shift matrix (first<br>
matrix) to become a unitary matrix. In Equation 13, a phase angle can be<br>
obtained as follows in accordance with a delay value of Tj(t), i=l,...,Nt.<br>
[Equation 14]<br><br>
where, Nm denotes the number of sub-carriers of an OFDM signal.<br>
An example of a generation equation of a GPSD matrix is as follows when the<br>
number of transmitting antennas is 2 and a 1 -bit codebook is used.<br>
[Equation 15]<br><br>
In Equation 15, since a value β is easily determined if a value a is determined,<br>
information of the value a is obtained in such a manner that two types of values a are<br>
determined and their information is fed back by a codebook index. For example, the value a<br>
is previously determined between the transmitter and the receiver that a is equal to 0.2 if a<br>
feedback index is 0 while a is equal to 0.8 if a feedback: index is 1.<br>
A predetermined precoding matrix for obtaining SNR gain can be used as an<br>
example of the second matrix. When Walsh code is used as the precoding matrix, a<br>
generation equation of the phase shift based precoding matrix P is as follow.<br><br>
[Equation 16]<br><br>
Equation 16 is based on a sysfem having four transmitting antennas and a spatial<br>
multiplexing rate of 4. In this case, the second matrix is properly reconstructed to select a<br>
specific transmitting antenna or tune the spatial multiplexing rate.<br>
Equation 17 shows that the second matrix is reconstructed to select, two antennas in a<br>
system having four transmitting antennas.<br>
[Equation 17]<br><br>
Also, Table 3 shows a method for reconstructing the second matrix suitable for a<br>
spatial multiplexing rate when the spatial multiplexing rate varies depending on time or<br>
channel status.<br>
[Equation 18]<br><br><br>
Although Equation 18 shows that first column, first and second columns, and first to<br>
fourth columns of the second matrix are selected depending on the multiplexing rate, any one<br>
of first, second, third and fourth columns may be selected if the multiplexing rate is 1 while<br>
any two of the first, second, third and fourth columns may be selected if the multiplexing rate<br>
is 2.<br>
Meanwhile, the second matrix may be provided in the transmitter and the receiver in<br>
the codebook form. In this case, index information of the codebook is fed back from the<br>
receiver to me transmitter, and the transmitter selects a unitary matrix (latter half matrix) of<br>
the corresponding index from its codebook and then constructs a phase shift based precoding<br>
matrix by using Equation 13 above.<br>
Furthermore, the second matrix may be changed periodically so that carriers<br>
transmitted to one time slot have different precoding matrixes for each frequency band.<br>
Meanwhile, a cyclic delay value for the phase shift based precoding could be a value<br>
previously determined in the transmitter and the receiver or a value transmitted from the<br>
receiver to the transmitter through feedback. Also, although the spatial multiplexing rate R<br>
may be a value previously determined in the transmitter and the receiver, the receiver may<br>
calculate the spatial multiplexing rate by checking the channel status and feed back the<br>
calculated value to the transmitter. Alternatively, the transmitter may calculate and change<br>
the spatial multiplexing rate by using channel information fed back from the receiver.<br>
The expanded type of the aforementioned phase shift based precoding can be<br>
expressed as follows.<br>
[Equation 19]<br><br><br>
In Equation 19 above, D1 is used to change a channel, and D2 is used to equalize a<br>
channel between respective streams. Also, WN,XR and VRxR denote unitary matrixes.<br>
Now, a procedure of performing ARQ for error correction using the aforementioned<br>
phase shift based precoding will be described. It is assumed that initial transmission is<br>
performed using a precoding matrix having two transmitting antennas and a spatial<br>
multiplexing rate of 2 in a multiple codeword (MCW) structure. However, as described above,<br>
a precoding matrix for a system having M number of antennas (M is a natural number greater<br>
than 2) and a spatial multiplexing rate of N (N is a natural number greater than 1) may be<br>
used, and a single codeword (SCW) structure may be used.<br>
In the multiple codeword structure, a plurality of packets may be transmitted<br>
simultaneously through spatial multiplexing. Packet transmission can be performed by two<br>
types of cases. That is, the former case corresponds to the case where errors occur in all<br>
packets even though i number of packets (i is a natural number greater than 2) have been<br>
transmitted, and the latter case corresponds to the case where errors occur in j number of<br>
packets (j is a natural number smaller than i) even though i number of packets have been<br>
transmitted. First of all, the former case will be described.<br>
As shown in FIG. 12, a precoding matrix having a spatial multiplexing rate of 2 is<br>
used during initial transmission, and if NACK signal is arrived from the receiver due to<br>
transmission packet errors, the precoding matrix is reconstructed such that the first column or<br><br>
the second column is selected from the precoding matrix during initial transmission to obtain<br>
the spatial multiplexing rate of 1. Then, ARQ is performed. If the spatial multiplexing rate is<br>
lowered, the transmission power can be increased, whereby transmission reliability can be<br>
improved. At this time, transmitting antennas used for retransmission can be selected as those<br>
having excellent channel status referring to channel quality information transmitted from the<br>
receiver.<br>
Next, if errors occur in some of the transmitted packets like the latter case, two types<br>
of ARQ schemes can be considered. In case of the first type, only packets in which errors<br>
occur are retransmitted, and a spatial resource for normal packets is not used for<br>
retransmission. This type is called a blanking method. According to the blanking method, a<br>
new packet is not transmitted until j number of packets in which errors occur are restored by<br>
ARQ. In case of the second type, j number of packets are retransmitted and at the same time a<br>
new packet is transmitted through a spatial resource for the other packets. This type is called<br>
a non-blanking method.<br>
-Multiple antenna based ARQ scheme in blanking method<br>
1.	Antenna hopping ARQ scheme<br>
Antennas, other than transmitting antennas used for initial transmission are selected<br>
for retransmission.<br>
2.	Antenna selection ARQ scheme<br>
Transmitting antennas for retransmission are selected through transmitting antenna<br>
related information fed back from the receiver. Alternatively, transmitting antennas are<br>
randomly selected through direct channel estimation at the transmitter to perform<br>
retransmission.<br>
3.	Phase shift diversity ARQ scheme<br><br>
The spatial multiplexing scheme 01 the phase shift diversity scheme is used during<br>
initial transmission, and a phase shift based precoding method having a spatial multiplexing<br>
rate corresponding to the number of packets in which errors occur is used during<br>
retransmission.<br>
In other words, as shown in FIG. 13, the spatial multiplexing scheme having a<br>
spatial multiplexing rate of 2 is used during initial transmission. If errors occur in the<br>
transmission packets, retransmission is performed in such a manner that the first column or<br>
the second column is selected from the phase shift based precoding matrix of the two-<br>
transmitting antenna system to reconstruct the precoding matrix having a spatial multiplexing<br>
rate of 1. Also, as shown in FIG. 14, the phase shift diversity scheme having a spatial<br>
multiplexing rate of 2 is used during initial transmission. If errors occur in the transmission<br>
packets, retransmission is performed in such a manner that the first column or the second<br>
column is selected from the phase shift bused precoding matrix of the two-transmitting<br>
antenna system to reconstruct the precoding matrix having a spatial multiplexing rate of 1.<br>
Alternatively, retransmission is performed by changing itransmitting antennas even though the<br>
phase shift based precoding matrix is used.<br>
4. Hybrid ARQ scheme<br>
If errors occur in j number of packets, the antenna hopping ARQ scheme or the<br>
phase shift diversity ARQ scheme is used. If errors occur in all packets, the time-space<br>
symbol based HARQ of FIG. 8 is used. FIG 15 illustrates the procedure of performing the<br>
phase shift diversity ARQ scheme when errors occur in some packets and performing the<br>
time-space symbol based HARQ when errors occur in all packets.<br>
- Multiple antenna based ARQ scheme in non-blanking method<br>
1. Antenna hopping ARQ scheme<br><br>
Antennas other than transmitting antennas used for initial transmission are selected<br>
to perform retransmission. FIG 16 illustrates the procedure of hopping antennas for<br>
retransmission when packets are transmitted through the phase shift diversity scheme.<br>
2.	Phase shift diversity ARQ scheme<br>
The spatial multiplexing scheme or the phase shift diversity scheme is used for<br>
initial transmission. The phase shift based precoding method is used for retransmission,<br>
wherein the position of each column in the precoding matrix is varied. FIG. 17 illustrates the<br>
procedure of exchanging respective columns of the phase shift based precoding matrix during<br>
retransmission when packets are transmitted through the phase shift diversity scheme.<br>
3.	Hybrid ARQ scheme<br>
If errors occur in j number of packets, the antenna hopping ARQ scheme or the<br>
phase shift diversity ARQ scheme in the non-blanking method is used. If errors occur in all<br>
packets, the time-space symbol based HARQ of FIG. 8 is used.<br>
At least any one of channel-adaptive HARQ/channel-non-adaptive HARQ, chase<br>
combining scheme/incremental redundancy scheme, and synchronous HARQ/asynchronous<br>
HARQ may be used as the aforementioned ARQ scheme.<br>
Transmitting and receiving apparatus which supports first method<br>
FIG 18 is a block diagram illustrating internal configuration of a transmitting and<br>
receiving apparatus which supports the first method. The transmitting and receiving apparatus<br>
includes an input module 1801 selecting a desired function or inputting information, a display<br>
module 1803 displaying various kinds of ir.formation for operating the transmitting and<br>
receiving apparatus, a memory module 1805 storing various programs required for the<br>
operation of the transmitting and receiving apparatus and data to be transmitted to the<br>
receiver, a wireless communication module 1807 receiving an external signal and<br><br>
transmitting data to the receiver, an audio processor 1809 converting a digital audio signal<br>
into an analog audio signal, amplifying the signal and outputting the amplified signal through<br>
a speaker SP or amplifying the audio signal from a mike MIC and converting the signal into a<br>
digital signal, and a controller 1811 controlling entire driving of the transmitting and<br>
receiving apparatus.<br>
The configuration of the wireless communication module 1807 will be described in<br>
more detail. FIG 19 illustrates the configuration of a single codeword (SCW) OFDM<br>
transmitter included in the wireless communication module 1807, and FIG 20 illustrates the<br>
configuration of an MCW OFDM transmitter included in the wireless communication module<br>
1807. Also, since the receiver corresponding to the transmitter includes modules having<br>
inverse functions of the respective modules of the transmitter, its detailed description will be<br>
omitted.<br>
In the SCW OFDM transmitter, a channel encoder 1910 adds redundant bits to<br>
transmission data bits to prevent the transmiiision bits from being distorted in a channel, and<br>
performs channel encoding by using an encoding code such as LDPC code. An interleaver<br>
1920 performs interleaving through code bit parsing to minimize loss due to instantaneous<br>
noise in data transmission, and a mapper 1930 converts the interleaved data bits into OFDM<br>
symbols. This symbol mapping can be performed through phase modulation such as QPSK or<br>
amplitude modulation such as 16QAM, 8QAM and 4QAM. Afterwards, the OFDM symbols<br>
are carried in carriers of a time domain throngh a precoder 1940, a subchannel modulator (not<br>
shown), and an IFFT 1950, sequentially, and then transmitted to a radio channel through a<br>
filter (not shown) and an analog converter 1960. Meanwhile, the MCW OFDM transmitter<br>
has the same configuration as that of the SOW OFDM transmitter excluding that OFDM<br>
symbols are arranged in parallel for each channel and then transmitted to a channel encoder<br><br>
2010 and an interleaver 2020.<br>
Precoding matrix determination modules 1941 and 2041 determine the first<br>
precoding matrix for sub-carriers of the first index, and phase shifts the first precoding matrix<br>
to determine precoding matrixes for the other sub-carriers. In the present invention, precoding<br>
is performed using a unitary matrix of (the number of transmitting antennas) x (spatial<br>
multiplexing rate) size, wherein the unitary :natrix is provided for each index of sub-carriers.<br>
The unitary matrix for the first index is phase shifted to obtain unitary matrixes of the other<br>
indexes. This will be described in more detail.<br>
In other words, the precoding matrix determination modules 1941 and 2041 select a<br>
random precoding matrix in a codebook previously stored in a memory (not shown) and<br>
determines the selected precoding matrix as a precoding matrix (first precoding matrix) for<br>
sub-carrier of the first index. In this case, the first precoding matrix may also be selected<br>
depending on predetermined policies, channel status, etc.<br>
Subsequently, the first precoding matrix is phase shifted at a predetermined size to<br>
generate a second precoding matrix for sub-carrier of the second index. At this time, the size<br>
of the shifted phase may be set depending on the current channel status and/or the presence of<br>
feedback information from the receiver. The second precoding matrix is phase shifted at a<br>
predetermined size to generate a third precoding matrix for sub-carrier of the third index. In<br>
other words, the procedure of generating the second precoding matrix is repeated in the<br>
procedure of generating the third precoding matrix to the last precoding matrix.<br>
Precoding matrix reconstruction modules 1942 and 2042 are previously set in the<br>
memory from each precoding matrix generated in the precoding matrix generation modules<br>
1941 and 2041 or reconstruct the precoding matrixes depending on information reported from<br>
a controller 1811. In this case, reconstruction of the precoding matrixes may vary depending<br><br>
on types of ARQ schemes supported by the transmitting and receiving apparatus. In other<br>
words, reconstruction of the precoding mairixes may be performed in such a manner that a<br>
specific column of the precoding matrix is selected to lower the spatial multiplexing rate or<br>
the position of each row or column of the prxoding matrix is exchanged.<br>
Precoding modules 1943 and 2043 perform precoding by substituting OFDM<br>
sequence of the corresponding sub-carrier for the reconstructed precoding matrix.<br>
In addition, if the transmitting and receiving apparatus supports any one of the<br>
antenna hopping ARQ scheme, the antenna selection ARQ scheme, the phase shift diversity<br>
ARQ scheme, and the hybrid ARQ scheme in the blanking method or any one of the antenna<br>
hopping ARQ scheme, the phase shift diversity ARQ scheme, and the hybrid ARQ scheme in<br>
the non-blanking method, the transmitting and receiving apparatus may further include any<br>
one or more of a spatial multiplexing module (not shown), a phase shift diversity module (not<br>
shown), and a time-space symbol module (non shown).<br>
The controller 1811 reports various kinds of information for changing or<br>
reconstructing the precoding matrix depending on the ARQ scheme supported by the<br>
transmitting and receiving apparatus to the precoding matrix reconstruction modules 1942<br>
and 2042 or updates spatial multiplexing rate information stored in the memory so that the<br>
precoding matrix reconstruction modules 1942 and 2042 are operated referring to the updated<br>
information.<br><second embodiment><br>
In the aforementioned first method, a corresponding precoding matrix is changed<br>
such that phase value offset and/or sub-carrier index offset information, which is fed back<br>
from the receiver or randomly set in the transmitter, is applied to the phase shift based<br>
precoding matrix before reconstruction to lower the spatial multiplexing rate, whereby a	<br>
precoding matrix optimized for retransmission can be obtained. Hereinafter, the procedure of<br>
changing the precoding matrix by allowing the system having four antennas and a spatial<br>
multiplexing rate of 2 to apply phase value offset and/or sub-carrier index offset to the phase<br>
shift based precoding matrix in Table 2 will be described in accordance with embodiments. In<br>
this case, it will be apparent to those with ordinary skill in the art to which the present<br>
invention pertains that the improved phase shift based precoding method of the present<br>
invention is not limited to the following embodiments and is applicable to a system having M<br>
number of antennas (M is a natural number greater than 2) and a spatial multiplexing rate of<br>
N (N is a natural number greater than 1).<br><first feedback embodiment><br>
in this embodiment, as shown in FIG. 21 A, sub-carrier index offset Noffset is fed back<br>
from the receiver and then applied to the phase shift based precoding matrix.<br>
As shown in FIG 21B, it is noted that a channel area (area allocated for a solid line<br>
sine wave) initially allocated to sub-carrier of index k is relatively poorer than the other areas.<br>
Accordingly, the receiver checks the channel status; of the resource allocated to the<br>
corresponding sub-carrier, sets a proper offset Noffset and. feeds back the set offset Noffset to the<br>
transmitter. The transmitter applies the fed-back oflset Noffset to the existing phase shift based<br>
precoding matrix so that the corresponding sub-carrier moves to the optimized channel area<br>
(area allocated for a dotted line sine wave). J\sx equation of the phase shift based precoding<br>
matrix to which the fed-back index offsetNoffset has been applied can be expressed as follows.<br>
[Equation 20]<br><br><br>
When Equation 19 is applied to the generalized phase shift diversity scheme, the<br>
following Equation 21 can be obtained.<br>
[Equation 21]<br><br>
Also, when Equation 19 is applied to the expanded phase shift diversity scheme, the<br>
following Equation 22 can be obtained.<br>
[Equation 22]<br><br><second feedback embodiment><br>
In this embodiment, as shown in FIG 22A, either a proper phase value θ or a phase<br><br>
value offset θoffset which is the difference between a previous feedback phase value and the<br>
optimized phase value is fed back from the receiver and then applied to the phase shift based<br>
precoding matrix. Also, a value previovsly determined depending on the number of<br>
retransmission times may be used as the phase value offset θoffset.<br>
As shown in FIG. 22B, it is noted that a channel area (area allocated for a solid line<br>
sine wave) initially allocated to sub-carrier of index k having a phase of θ0 is relatively poorer<br>
than the other areas. Accordingly, the receiver checks the channel status of the resource<br>
allocated to the corresponding sub-carrier, sets a proper offset 0, compares the set offset 0<br>
with the fed-back phase value θ0, and feeds back the result offset θoffset which is the difference<br>
value to the transmitter. The transmitter apples the fed-back offset θoffset to the existing phase<br>
shift based precoding matrix so that the corresponding sub-carrier moves to a channel area<br>
(area allocated for a dotted line sine wave) which is relatively more excellent than before. An<br>
equation of the phase shift based precoding matrix to which the fed-back offset θoffset has been<br>
applied can be expressed as follows.<br>
[Equation 23]<br><br>
Meanwhile, if the receiver checks the status of the channel allocated to the<br>
corresponding sub-carrier, sets an optimized phase value θ, and directly feeds back the set<br>
value to the transmitter, the transmitter may newly generate the phase shift based precoding<br>
matrix based on the fed-back phase value.<br><br>
When Equation 23 is applied to :he generalized phase shift diversity scheme, the<br>
following Equation 24 can be obtained.<br>
[Equation 24]<br><br>
Also, when. Equation 23 is applied to the expanded phase shift diversity scheme, the<br>
following Equation 25 can be obtained.<br>
[Equation 25]<br><br>
The offset θoffset of Equations 24 and 25 may be fed back from the receiver.<br>
Alternatively, a previously determined value may be used as the offset θoffset depending on the<br>
number of retransmission times.<br><third feedback embodiment><br>
In this embodiment, as shown in FIG 23A, a proper phase value © and a sub-carrier<br>
index offset are fed back from the receiver. Alternatively, a phase value offset θoffset which is<br>
the difference between the previous feedback phase value and the optimized phase value and<br><br>
a subcarier index offset Noffset are fed back from the receiver. Thus, the resultant values are<br>
applied to the phase shift based precoding matrix.<br>
As shown in FIG. 23B, it is noted that a channel area (area allocated for a solid line<br>
sine wave) initially allocated to sub-carrier of index k having a phase of do is relatively poorer<br>
than the other areas. Accordingly, the receiver checks the channel status of the resource<br>
allocated to the corresponding sub-carrier, sets a phase value 9 for an optimized status and a<br>
sub-carrier index offset Noffset, feeds back an offset value θoffset which is the difference<br>
between the phase value 9 and the previojs feedback phase value do and the sub-carrier<br>
index offset Noffset to the transmitter. Then, the transmitter adds the fed-back offset values<br>
θoffset and Noffset to the existing phase shift based precoding matrix so that the corresponding<br>
sub-carrier moves to the optimized channel iarea (area allocated for a dotted line sine wave).<br>
An equation of the phase shift based precoding matrix to which the fed-back offset values<br>
θoffset and Noffset have been applied can be expressed as follows.<br>
[Equation 26]<br><br>
When Equation 26 is applied to the generalized phase shift diversity scheme, the<br>
following Equation 27 can be obtained.<br>
[Equation 27]<br><br><br>
Also, when Equation 28 is applied to the expanded phase shift diversity scheme, the<br>
following Equation 28 can be obtained.<br>
[Equation 28]<br><br><fourth feedback embodiment></fourth>
In this embodiment, a sub-carrier index of the phase shift based precoding matrix is<br>
used as a sub^carrier index offset Noffset fed back from the receiver.<br>
The receiver checks the channel status of the resource allocated to a random sub-<br>
carrier or a predetermined sub-carrier, sets a proper offset Noffset, and feeds back the set offset<br>
to the transmitter. Then, the transmitter applies the fed-back offset value Noffset to the existing<br>
phase shift based precoding matrix for all sub-carriers regardless of types of sub-carriers (or<br>
index of sub-carriers) so that all sub-carrit;rs move to the optimized channel area (area<br>
allocated for a dotted line sine wave), In other words, since the frequency domain having the<br>
greatest channel size is equally applied to all sub-carriers, system performance can be<br><br>
improved. An equation of the phase shift based precoding matrix to which the fed-back index<br>
offset Noffset has been applied can be expressed as follows.<br>
[Equation 29]<br><br>
In this case, the sub-carrier index offset Noffset is a fixed value, and serves as<br>
information for the greatest channel size at the receiver.<br>
When Equation 29 is applied to the generalized phase shift diversity scheme, the<br>
following Equation 30 can be obtained.<br>
[Equation 30]<br><br>
Also, when Equation 29 is applied to the expanded phase shift diversity scheme, the<br>
following Equation 31 can be obtained.<br>
[Equation 31]<br><br>
In the second method of the present invention, if NACK signal is arrived from the<br>
receiver due to errors occurring in trans nission packets, the existing phase shift based<br>
precoding matrix is changed to any one among the matrixes of the first to fourth feedback<br>
embodiments by using various kinds of oifset information fed back from the receiver and<br>
then packet retransmission is performed using the changed precoding matrix. Hereinafter, the<br>
main configuration of the transmitting and receiving apparatus which supports the second<br>
method will be described.<br>
Transmitting and receiving apparatus which supports second method<br>
In this transmitting and receiving apparatus, an input module, a display module, a<br>
memory module; a wireless communicatio 1 module, a speaker SP, a mike MIC, an audio<br>
processor, a controller, and a channel encoder, an interleaver, a mapper, a precoder, a<br>
subchannel modulator, an IFFT, a filter, and an analog converter which are included in the<br>
wireless communication module, and a preceding matrix determination module and a<br>
precoding module which are included in the precoder are the same as those of the<br>
transmitting and receiving apparatus which supports the first method. Accordingly, an offset<br>
application module (not shown) provided in the precoder instead of the precoding matrix<br>
reconstruction module will now be described.<br>
The offset application module applies phase value offset information fed back from<br>
the receiver and/or sub-carrier index offset information to the precoding matrix reconstructed<br><br>
by the precoding matrix reconstruction module to finally complete any one among the<br>
matrixes of the first to fourth feedback embodiments if the transmitting and receiving<br>
apparatus of the present invention is operated in a closed loop system. If the transmitting and<br>
receiving apparatus of the present invention is operated in an open loop system, the offset<br>
application module applies phase value offset information and/or sub-carrier index offset<br>
information, which is randomly given from the transmitter.<br>
Meanwhile, a personal digital assistant (PDA), a cellular phone, a personal<br>
communication service (PCS) phone, a global system, for mobile (GSM) phone, a wideband<br>
CDMA (WCDMA) phone, or a mobile broadband system (MBS) phone may be used as the<br>
transmitting and receiving apparatus of the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention the multiple antenna related scheme is combined<br>
with the ARQ related scheme to simulfaneously improve speed and reliability in data<br>
transmission. Also, the present invention can be applied to a frequency selective channel,<br>
allows error processing of a multiple codeword, and can apply adaptive ARQ without being<br>
limited to the specific multiple antenna transmission method.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that the present invention can be<br>
embodied in other specific forms without departing from the spirit and essential<br>
characteristics of the invention. Thus, the above embodiments are to be considered in all<br>
respects as illustrative and not restrictive, the scope of the invention should be determined<br>
by reasonable interpretation of the appended claims and all change which comes within the<br>
equivalent scope of the invention are included in the scope of the invention.<br>
