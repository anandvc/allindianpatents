				<td>Novel nitriflcation inhibitors, and the use of polyacids which contain a nitrification inhibitor for the treatment of inorganic fertilizers<br>
The invention relates to the use of inorganic or organic polyacids for the treatment of inorganic fertilizers.<br>
In particular, the invention relates to the use of polyacids as a mixture with at least one nitrification inhibitor for the treatment of inorganic fertilizers, the use of selected pyrazole derivatives as nitrification inhibitor in inorganic fertilizers, and as stabilizers of liquid manure or liquid fertilizer formulations, and the corresponding treated inorganic fertilizers per se. Moreover, the present invention relates to pyrazole derivatives which can be used as nitrification inhibitors in inorganic fertilizers, and as stabilizers of liquid manure or liquid fertilizer formulations.<br>
In order to make available to plants in agriculture the nitrogen needed by them, ammonium compounds are mainly employed as fertilizers.<br>
Ammonium compounds are converted microbially to nitrates in the soil in a relatively short time (nitrification). Nitrates, however, can be washed out of the soil. The portion washed out is in this case no longer available for plant nutrition, so that for this reason rapid nitrification is undesirable. For better utilization of the fertilizer, nitrification inhibitors are therefore added to the fertilizer. A known group of nitrification<br><br>
inhibitors are pyrazole compounds.<br>
A problem in the use of pyrazole compounds as nitrification inhibitors is their high volatility. During the storage of fertilizer preparations containing pyrazole compounds, a continuous loss of active compound occurs due to evaporation. The pyrazole compounds must therefore be formulated in a nonvolatile form by means of suitable measures.<br>
To fix the pyrazole compounds, these were converted, for<br>
example, into transition metal complexes such as zinc complexes. This is<br>
described, for example, ingles 4 522 642. The volatility of the active<br>
compounds can thus be reduced. [For environmental protection reasons, the<br>
widespread application of zinc, copper or manganese to the soil is,	I<br>
however, undesirable. Complexes of alkali metals or alkaline earth metals which are environmentally tolerable, are not adequately stable, however, and hydrolyze in the aqueous environment.!<br>
It has furthermore been attempted by neutralization of the pyrazole compounds with mineral acids, such as phosphoric acid or hydrochloric acid, to decrease their volatility. DE-A-4 128 828 describes the use of nitrates and phosphates of 3-methylpyrazole for the coating of fertilize  3 635 690 also describes the stabilization of pyrazole derivatives by mineral acids, such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid and phosphoric acid. These acidic salts of the pyrazole comÂ¬pounds, however, are increasingly susceptible to hydrolysis and for this reason cannot be employed for all applications^}<br>
DE-A-4 128 828 further describes the sealing of the coated fertilizer with wax or oil. In the case of hygroscopic active compound salts, however, this process does not lead to a satisfactory resistance to hydrolysis.<br>
Formulations of pyrazoles with polymeric auxiliaries have ftirthermore been employed. Thus DE 260 486 describes formulations of<br><br>
pyrazoles in urea-formaldehyde condensates. The incorporation of the active compounds into the polymer matrix, however, suppresses the mobility of the active compounds in the soil. In this application form, therefore, the finely divided formulation and fertilizer must be thoroughly mixed with the soil to be fertilized. Otherwise the nitrification inhibitor remains on the surface of the earth with the polymer matrix. The need to mix formulation, fertilizer and soil, however, is laborious.<br>
It is an object of the present invention Ito provide inorganic fertilizers which contain a nitrification inhibitor whose content does not significantly change during storage and application of the fertilizer, and which remains in the ground after application of the fertilizer and can display its action therej Furthermore, new nitrification inhibitors shall be provided.<br>
We have found that this object is achieved by use of inorganic or organic polyacids for the treatment of inorganic fertilizers. In this case, the^ Seated inorganic fertilizer contains a nitrification inhibitor which is present in the inorganic fertilizer or on its surface. The nitrification inhibitor can furthermore also be employed as a mixture with the polyacid and then passes into this during the treatment of the inorgamc fertilizer employed according to the invention, preferably onto the surface thereof.<br>
The use of inorganic or organic polyacids for the treatment of inorgamc fertilizers which contain nitrification inhibitors leads to an improved fixation of the nitrification inhibitors in the inorganic fertilizer. The volatility of the nitrification inhibitor is greatly reduced in this case, so that the storage stability of the treated inorganic fertilizer increases. Loss of nitrification inhibitor during a storage period or on application to the soil is avoided.<br>
In addition, the treatment according to the invention and the treated inorganic fertilizer thus obtained have the advantage of ecological acceptability. They contain no toxic substances, such as, for example.<br><br>
zinc, copper or manganese, which in relatively large amounts very severely restrict environmental tolerability and can lead to soil contamination.<br>
The treatment according to the invention can furthermore be carried out in a cost-efficient and ecologically tolerable manner. As a result of the treatment according to the invention, the amount of nitrificaÂ¬tion inhibitors in the inorganic fertilizer can be reduced because of the decreased volatility, which leads to decreased costs and to a better envu-onmental tolerability of the fertilizers according to the invention. The object is furthermore achieved by the use of compounds of the general formula<br><br><br>
K2<br><br>
where the radical R^ is a hydrogen atom, a halogen atom or a Cj^-alkyl<br>
radical, the radical R^ is a Cj^-alkyl radical and the radical R-" is H or<br>
a radical -CH2OH, where if R^ is H the salt of the compounds with<br>
phosphoric acid can also be employed,<br>
as nitrification inhibitors. Preferably the compound used is 3,4-dimethyl<br>
pyrazole, 4-chloro-3-methylpyrazole or a phosphoric acid addition solt<br>
thereof.<br>
Polyacids<br>
According to the invention, inorganic or organic polyacids are used for the treatment of the inorganic fertilizers.<br>
In this case, all suitable inorganic or organic polyacids can be used which decrease the tendency of nitrification inhibitors to evaporate.<br><br>
Inorganic polyacids which can be used according to the invention are isopolyacids or heteropolyacids, in particular polyphosphoric acids or polycyclic acids. The polyphosphoric acids, for example, have the general formula Hn+2Pn03n+i" " J"sing an integer of at least 2, preferably at least 10.<br>

In the case of monoalkyl dicarboxylates, the number of C atoms specified relates to the dicarboxylic acid structure, the alkyl group in the ester radical, independently thereof, can have from 1 to 20 C atoms, in particular from 1 to 8 C atoms. Suitable appropriate monoethylenically unsaturated dicarboxylic anhydrides are maleic anhydride, itaconic anhydride, citraconic anhydride and mixtures thereof. Acrylic acid, methacrylic acid, maleic acid, itaconic acid and maleic anhydride are preferably employed. Acrylic acid is particularly preferably employed.<br>

Any desired suitable nitrification inhibitors can be employed in the inorganic fertilizers according to the invention.<br>
The polyacids used according to the invention are particularly advantageously employed for the treatment of inorganic fertilizers which contain these volatile nitrification inhibitors, in particular pyrazole comÂ¬pounds.  "Pyrazole compounds" is understood as meaning all pyrazole compounds which have a nitrification-inhibiting action, such as are also described, for example, in the publications US 3 635 690, US 4 522 642 and DE-A-4 128 8-28 mentioned at the beginning in the discussion of the prior art, whose contents with respect to the pyrazole compounds described there are hereby included.<br>

For preparation of the N-hydroxymethylpyrazoles, the corresponding pyrazoles are reacted with formalm solution in methanol. Excess solvent is then evaporated, the compounds being obtained as solids. For the preparation of 3,4-dimethyl-pyrazole reference is made to Noyce et al., Jour, of Org. Chera. 20, 1955, 1681 to 1682.<br>

The invention is further described below by means of examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Preparation of N-hydroxymethyI-3,4-dimethyIpyrazole<br>
96 g (1.0 mol) of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole in 50 ml of methanol were dissolved in 100 g (1.0 mol) of formalin solution (30%) at room temperature. Water and methanol were then evaporated. The title<br><br>
compound remained as a white solid (yield 95%).<br>
Preparation of N-hydroxymethyl-4-chloro-3-methylpyrazole<br>
116 g (1.0 mol) of 4-chloro-3-methylpyrazole in 50 ml of methanol were dissolved in 100 g (1.0 mol) of formalin solution (30%) at room temperature. Water and methanol were then evaporated. The title compound remained as a white solid (yield 95%).<br>
Preparation of 3,4-dimethylpyrazolium dihydrogen phosphate<br>
96 g (1.0 mol) of 3,4-dimethylpyrazole were dissolved in 115 g (1.0 mol) of phosphoric acid (85%) at room temperature. The water contained in the phosphoric acid was evaporated. After a few hours, the title compound crystallized out from the oil initially present (yield 98%).<br>
Preparation of 4-chloro-3-methylpyrazolium dihydrogen phosphate<br>
116 g (1.0 mol) of 4-chloro-3-methylpyrazole were dissolved in 115 g (1.0 mol) of phosphoric acid (85%) at room temperature. The water contained in the phosphoric acid was evaporated. After a few hours, the title compound crystallized out of the oil initially present (yield 98%).<br>
Preparation of the nitrification-inhibited inorganic fertilizers<br>
The carrier fertilizer used was ammonium sulfate nitrate (ASN). 2 g of pyrazole were dissolved in a little water, and if desired (see Table I) the solution was mixed with a stoichiometric amount of phosphoric acid (1:1) and with from 1 to 10 g of polyacrylic acid or polyphosphoric acid. 2 g of the carrier fertilizer in the form of granules were prewarmed to approximately 50Â°C and slowly sprayed onto a turntable with the mixture containing the pyrazole compound. To accelerate the drying, drying was carried out with hot air, either at the<br><br>
end of the spraying or after interruption of the spraying.<br>
Investigation of the storage stability<br>
The storage stability of the treated inorganic fertilizers was determined in a rapid test in which the nitrification-inhibited inorganic fertilizers were stored in a ventilated warming cabinet for 4 weeks at 30 "C, from 40 to 50% relative atmospheric humidity and approximately 1.2 m/s air velocity. The concentration of nitrification inhibitor on the inorganic fertilizer was determined before and after storage and the loss of nitrification inhibitor determined in percent. Approximately 10 to 30 g of treated inorganic fertilizer were stored in each case. The concentration of pyrazole compound as nitrification inhibitor in this case was from 0.05% by weight to 0.2% by weight at the start of the investigation, based on the treated inorganic fertilizer. The losses obtained for different pyrazole compounds are shown in Table I below.<br><br><br><br>
Coating with the polyacid according to the invention leads to a significantly reduced loss of nitrification inhibitor.<br>
Demonstration of the biological effect of the nitrification inhibitors - field test -<br>
The biological effectiveness of 4-chloro-3-methylpyrazole (4 Cl-3MP) and 3,4-dimethylpyrazole (3,4-DMP) in comparison with DCD and the control was tested in multiple field tests in different environments by means of the features "nitrate content in the basis of the stem", "NO3-and NH4-N-content in the soil" as well as "grain produce".<br>
The standard methods used in agricultural tests were applied to the laying-out, probing, harvesting and evaluation of the field tests.<br>
The analysis of the plant and soil samples followed standard procedures. The remaining measures undertaken in the production, e.g. plant protection, were in accordance with good agricultural practice and were applied uniformly.<br>
A biologically effective nitrification inhibitor is characterized preferably in that the soil to which it is applied shows lower amounts of NO3-N and higher amountes of NH4-N compared to a comparitive test (here: supporting fertilizer is ammonium sulfate salpeter without nitrification inhibitor) in a time period of up to 8 weeks after application (compare table 1),<br>
As a consequence of this treatment the nitrate consumption of the plants is reduced (compare N03-content in the basis of the stem of rape plants, table 2) and the produce is enhanced (compare grain produce of winter wheat, tables 3a and 3b). Table 4 shows the description of the location of the field tests.<br>
In the following table 1 the results are summarized. It is evident that all three nitrification inhibitors have good biological effectiveness<br><br>
compared to the control. 4 CI-3 MP and 3,4-DMP show an effectiveness as good as or better than that of DCD, using reduced amounts of the active substance. Further examples relating to selected nitrification inhibitors are shown in table 5.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
