[Document Name] Specification<br>
[Title of the Invention] INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE<br>
[Technical Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an internal<br>
combustion engine where a combustion chamber is formed<br>
between a cylinder block and a cylinder head opposite to a<br>
top portion of a piston slidably fitted in the cylinder<br>
block, and an intake path extends from an inlet pipe<br>
separately or integrally connected to the cylinder head to<br>
the cylinder head and communicates with an intake valve<br>
port that opens to the top surface of the combustion<br>
chamber to be opened/closed with the intake valve.<br>
[Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
Such internal combustion engine is disclosed in, for<br>
example. Patent Document 1.<br>
[Patent Document 1] JP-A No. 2005-133548<br>
[Disclosure of the Invention]<br>
[Problem to be solved by the Invention]<br>
[0003]<br>
In the internal combustion engine as disclosed in<br>
Patent Document 1, a downward protruding portion is formed<br>
on the top surface of an intake path in a mounting position<br>
of a fuel injection valve to reduce a fuel spraying space<br>
with the fuel injection valve to thereby avoid abrupt<br>
change in intake path area, reduction in flow rate of an<br>
intake air, and reduction in filling efficiency. To<br><br>
further improve power of the internal combustion engine, it<br>
is unnecessary to increase a flow rate as well as secure<br>
enough amount of intake air flowing through the intake path.<br>
[0004]<br>
The present invention has been accomplished in view<br>
of the above circumstances.  It is accordingly an object of<br>
the invention to provide an internal combustion engine that<br>
secures enough amount of intake air and increases a flow<br>
rate in a balanced manner to improve a filling efficiency<br>
to increase power.<br>
[Means for solving the Problem]<br>
[0005]<br>
To attain the above object, the invention as<br>
described in Claim 1 is an internal combustion engine<br>
including: a combustion chamber formed between a cylinder<br>
block and a cylinder head opposite to a top portion of a<br>
piston slidably fitted in the cylinder block; and an intake<br>
path extending from an inlet pipe separately or integrally<br>
connected to the cylinder head        _j-_.,_^       and<br>
communicating with an intake valve port that opens to the<br>
top surface of the combustion chamber to be opened/closed<br>
with the intake valve, wherein the intake path is provided<br>
with a pair of throttle portions arranged with an interval<br>
in an air flow direction of the intake path and an<br>
expanding portion positioned between the throttle portions.<br>
[0005]<br>
Further, the invention as described in Claim 2 is the<br>
internal combustion engine as described in Claim 1, wherein<br><br>
a fuel injection valve for injecting a luei LV   LUC<br>
expanding portion is attached to the cylinder head or the<br>
inlet pipe.<br>
[0007]<br>
Further, the invention as described in Claim 3 is the<br>
internal combustion engine as described in Claim 1 or 2,<br>
wherein the expanding portion corresponds to a connection<br>
portion between the cylinder head and the inlet pipe<br>
separate from the cylinder head.<br>
[0008]<br>
Further, the invention as described in Claim 4 is the<br>
internal combustion engine as described in any one of<br>
Claims 1 to 3, wherein the throttle portions are provided<br>
to a bent portion of the intake path formed in<br>
substantially U shape in section as viewed in a projected<br>
plan orthogonal to an axial line of a crank shaft and<br>
parallel to a cylinder axial line.<br>
[Effects of the Invention]<br>
[0009]<br>
According to the invention as described in Claim 1, a<br>
cross-sectional area of the intake path is sequentially<br>
changed such as reduced, expanded, reduced, and expanded.<br>
Thus, it is possible to increase an intake flow rate due to<br>
reduction in cross-sectional area and increase an intake<br>
air amount due to expansion in cross-sectional area in a<br>
balanced manner.  As a result, filling efficiency is<br>
improved to increase power.<br>
[0010]<br><br>
Further, according to the invention as described in<br>
Claim 2,   a fuel is injected from the fuel injection valve<br>
to the expanding portion of the intake path, so it is<br>
possible to suppress change in intake air flow rate due to<br>
nozzle arrangement of the fuel injection valve as much as<br>
possible.<br>
[0011]<br>
Further, according to the invention as described in<br>
Claim 3, even if the cylinder head and the inlet pipe are<br>
separate members, the expanding portion corresponds to a<br>
connection portion between the cylinder head and the inlet<br>
pipe, so a connection port diameter can be set relatively<br>
large, and parts can be easily processed and assembled.<br>
[0012]<br>
Further, according to the invention as described in<br>
Claim 4, the intake path can be made compact and a cross-<br>
sectional area of the intake path can be largely changed.<br>
[Best Modes for carrying out the Invention]<br>

case 36 joined to a rear portion of the inner case 34.  A<br>
transmission chamber 37 for accommodating the V~belt type<br>
continuously variable transmission 29 is formed between the<br>
inner case 34 and the outer case 35, and a gear chamber 38<br>
for accommodating the reducing gear train 30 is formed<br>
between the inner case 34 and the gear case 36.<br>
[0021]<br>
The V-belt type continuously variable transmission 29<br>
is composed of a drive pulley 39 attached to one end of the<br>
crank shaft 26 inserted to the transmission chamber 37 from<br>
the crankcase 20, a driven pulley 40 attached to an output<br>
shaft 42 rotatably supported by the inner case 34, the<br>

parallel to the crank shaft 26, and an endless V belt 41<br>
transmitting a torque from the drive pulley 39 to the<br>
driven pulley 40.<br>
[0022]<br>
The drive pulley 39 includes a fixed semi-pulley 43<br><br>
fixed to the crank shaft 26, and a movable semi-pulley 44<br>
that can change a distance from the fixed semi-pulley 43,<br>
and the movable semi-pulley 44 is driven in the axial<br>
direction due to centrifugal force acting on a weight 46<br>
provided between a lamp plate 45 fixed to the crank shaft<br>
26 and the moveable semi-pulley 44.<br>
[0023]<br>
Further, the driven pulley 40 includes an internal<br>
cylinder 47 coaxially surrounding an output shaft 42 in a<br>
relatively rotatable manner, an external cylinder 4 8<br>
slidably fitting the internal cylinder 47 such that the<br>

axial line, a fixed semi-pulley 49 fixed to the internal<br>
cylinder 47, a movable semi-pulley 50 fixed to the external<br>
cylinder 48 opposite to the fixed semi-pulley 49, a torque<br>
cam mechanism 51 provided between the internal cylinder 47<br>
and the external cylinder 48 to apply component force in<br>
the axial direction between the semi-pulleys 49 and 50 in<br>
accordance with a difference in relative rotational phase<br>
between the movable semi-pulley 50 and the fixed semi-<br>
pulley 49, and a coil spring 52 for elastically biasing the<br>
movable semi-pulley 50 toward the fixed semi-pulley 49.<br>
The V belt 41 is stretched between the fixed semi-pulley 49<br>
and the movable semi-pulley 50.<br>
[0024]<br>
A centrifugal clutch 53 that can transmit a torque as<br>
the engine rpm exceeds the preset rpm is provided between<br>
the internal cylinder 47 of the driven pulley 40 and the<br><br>
output shaft 42.  A coil spring 52 surrounding the external<br>
cylinder 48 is provided between the drive plate<br>
constituting the centrifugal clutch 53 and coaxially and<br>
relatively rotatably joined to the internal cylinder 47 and<br>
the movable semi-pulley 50.<br>
[0025]<br>
A distance between the fixed semi-pulley 49 of the<br>
driven pulley 40 and the movable semi-pulley 50 is<br>
determined based on a relation among force generated by the<br>
torque cam mechanism   51 in the   axial direction, elastic<br>
force generated by the coil spring 52 in the axial<br>
direction, and force of the V belt 41 acting to increase a<br>
distance between the fixed semi-pulley 49 and the movable<br>
serai-pulley 50.  If the movable serai-pulley 44 is brought<br>
close to the fixed semi-pulley 43 and thus, a radius of the<br>
V belt 41 wound around the drive pulley 39 increases, in<br>
the drive pulley 39, a radius of the V belt 41 wound around<br>
the driven pulley 45 is reduced.<br>
[O026]<br>
One end of the vehicle shaft 55 of the rear wheel WR<br>
is inserted to the transraission case 30 after air-tightly<br>

is provided between the rear portion of the inner case   34<br>
of the transmission case 31 and the rear portion of the<br>
left-sided seat rail portion 14d in the vehicle frame F.<br>
[0028]<br>
Further, an outer rotor 58 is fixed to the other end<br>
of the crank shaft 26 rotatably passed through the right<br>
semi-crankcase 20R of the crankcase 20, and an inner stator<br>
59 surrounded by the outer rotor 58 to constitute a<br>
generator 60 together with the outer rotor 58 is fixed to a<br>
right cover 51 fastened to the right semi-crankcase 20R to<br>
cover the generator 60.<br>

cylinder head 22 and the head cover 23.  A cam shaft 89 of<br>
the valve system 88 is supported to the cylinder head 22<br>
rotatably about the axial line parallel to the crank shaft<br>
26.<br>
[0039]<br>
Referring also to Fig. 6, a torque from the crank<br>
shaft 26 is transmitted to the cam shaft 89 through a<br>
timing transmission mechanism 90 at a reduction gear ratio<br>
of 1/2.  The timing transmission mechanism 90 includes a<br>
cam drive sprocket 91 provided to the crank shaft 26<br>
between the right semi-crankcase 20R and the generator 60,<br>
a cam driven sprocket 92 fixed to the cam shaft 89, and an<br>
endless cam chain 93 stretched over the sprockets 91 and 92.<br>
A cam chain chamber 94 for moving the cam chain 93 extends<br>
from the crankcase 20 to the cylinder block 21 and up to<br>
the cylinder head 22.<br>
[0040]<br>
A cam chain guide 95 comes into contact with an outer<br>
periphery of the stretched cam chain 93 between the cam<br>
drive sprocket 91 and the cam driven sprocket 92.  A<br>
projection 96 of the cam chain guide 95 formed near the cam<br>
driven sprocket 92 is interposed between the cylinder block<br>
21 and the cylinder head 22, and an end portion of the cam<br>
chain guide 95 on the cam drive sprocket 91 side is fitted<br>
and supported to a supporting portion 97 formed in the<br><br>
right semi-crankcase 20R of the crankcase 20.<br>
[0041]<br>
Further, a chain tensioner 99 comes into contact with<br>
an   outer  periphery of the sagging cam  chain 93 between the<br>
cam drive sprocket 91 and the cam driven sprocket 92, and<br>
the end portion on the cam drive sprocket 91 side is<br>
supported to the tensioner rotatably about a spindle 98<br>
provided to the right semi-crankcase 20R.  The cylinder<br>
block 21 is provided with a tensioner lifter 100 that comes<br>
into contact with the chain tensioner 99 from the opposite<br>
side of the cam chain 93.<br>
[0042]<br>
Here, in the right case 60R of the crankcase 20, a<br>
breather chamber 101 communicating with an upper portion of<br>
the cam chain chamber 94 on the crankcase 20 side is formed,<br>
and a breather pipe 105 coramiinicating with the breather<br>
chamber 101 is attached to the right semi-crankcase 20R.<br>
The breather chamber 101 communicates with an upper portion<br>
of the cam chain chamber 94 on the crankcase 20 side<br>
through the inlet 103 located below the breather chamber<br>
101.  A maze 102 for separating oil mist from a blow-by gas<br>
introduced from the inlet 103 is defined in the breather<br>
chamber 101.<br>
[0043]<br>
Referring also to Fig, 7, a protruding wall 104<br>
provided at the inlet 103 that opens to the cam chain<br>
chamber 94 of the breather chamber 101 and extending<br>
orthogonally to the moving direction of the cam chain 93 is<br><br>
integrally protruded from the right semi-crankcase 20R of<br>
the crankcase 20 toward the cam chain 93 side.<br>
[0044]<br>
Here, a drive sprocket 107 for accommodating and<br>
holding an oil pump 106 for pumping oil and driving the oil<br>
pump 106 is provided closer to the center portion in the<br>
axial direction of the crank shaft 26 than the cam drive<br>
sprocket 91 in the crankcase 20.  The endless chain 109 is<br>
stretched around a driven sprocket 108 provided on the oil<br>
pump 106 side and the drive sprocket 107.<br>
[0045]<br>
Referring back to Fig. 2, a cool air introducing port<br>
110 for cooling the V-belt continuously variable<br>
transmission 29 with external air is provided in a portion<br>
corresponding to the drive pulley 39 of the outer case 35<br>
in the transmission case 31.  Further, a fan 111 for<br>
sucking air from the cool air introducing port 110 to the<br>
transmission chamber 37 is integrally formed on the outer<br>
edge surface of the fixed semi-pulley 43 of the drive<br>
pulley 39.<br>
[0046]<br>
An outside air introducing duct 112 for introducing<br>
the outside air to the cool air introducing port 110 is<br>
attached to the outer case 35 of the transmission case 31,<br>
and a path formation portion 112a connected to the air<br>
cleaner 64 to introduce the outside air to the air cleaner<br>
54 as shown in Fig. 1 is integrally formed in the outside<br>
air introducing ducr 112.<br><br>
[0047]<br>
The outside air introducing duct 112 has a cover 113<br>
that surrounds the cool air introducing port 110 and comes<br>
into contact with the outer case 35, and a filter element<br>
115 is endlessly wound around a support frame 114<br>
integrally formed in the cover 113.  Thus, an inner are of<br>
the outside air introducing duct 112 is segmented into a<br>
cleaning chamber 116 defined in the filter element 115 and<br>
communicating with the cool air introducing port 110 and an<br>
uncleaning chamber 117 defined outside the filter element<br>
115.  The uncleaning chamber 117 is open to the outside.<br>
[0048]<br>
Next, operations of the embodiment are described.  The<br>
breather chamber 101 is formed in the right semi-crankcase<br>
20R of the crankcase 20.  The breather chamber communicates<br>
with the upper portion of the cam chain chamber 94 on the<br>
crankcase 20 side, the cam chain chamber extending from the<br>
crankcase 20 to the cylinder block 21 and up to the<br>
cylinder head 22 to stretch the cam chain 93.  The<br>
protruding wall 104 is formed at the inlet 103 that opens<br>
to the cam chain chamber 94 of the breather chamber 101.<br>
The protruding wall 140 extends orthogonally to the<br>
movement direction of the cam chain 93 in the cam chain<br>
chamber 94 and is provided to the right semi-crankcase 20R<br>
of the crankcase 20 to protrude toward the cam chain 93<br>
side.<br>
[0049]<br>
Accordingly, at the time of stretching the cam chain<br><br>
93 under such conditions that the axial line of the crank<br>
shaft 26 is the vertical direction, the cam chain 93 can be<br>
placed and held on the protruding wall 104 near the cam<br>
drive sprocket 91.  As a result, the assembly of the cam<br>
chain 93 is facilitated, and assembly efficiency is<br>
enhanced.  Moreover, the protruding wall 104 also functions<br>
as a barrier against a blow-by gas introduced to the<br>
breather chamber 101 from the crankcase 20, so an effect of<br>
separating oil mist from the blow-by gas is increased.<br>
[0050]<br>
Further, in the crankcase 20, the oil pump 106 for<br>
pumping oil is accommodated and fixed, the drive sprocket<br>
107 for driving the oil pump 106 is provided closer to the<br>
central portion in the axial direction of the crank shaft<br>
26 than the cam drive sprocket 91.  Even if the drive<br>
sprocket 107 is placed inside the cam drive sprocket 91, it<br>
is possible to prevent the cam chain 93 from reaching the<br>
drive sprocket 107 side with the protruding wall 104.<br>
Hence, assembly efficiency is improved.  In addition, the<br>
protruding wall 104 effectively prevents leakage of oil<br>
from the drive sprocket 107 to the breather chamber 101.<br>
[0051]<br>
Further, the intake paths 70 communicating with the<br>
intake valve ports 71 provided in the cylinder head 22 to<br>
open to the top surface of the combustion chamber 62 extend<br>
from the inlet pipe 68 to the cylinder head 22.   In the<br>
intake paths 70, a pair of throttle portions 70a, 70b,<br>
arranged with an interval in an air flow direction of the<br><br>
intake paths 70 and an expanding portion 70c positioned<br>
between the throttle portions 70a, 70b, are formed.<br>
[0052]<br>
Accordingly, a cross-sectional area of the intake<br>
paths 70 is sequentially changed such as reduced, expanded,<br>
reduced, and expanded in the air flow direction.  Thus, it<br>
is possible to increase an intake flow rate due to<br>
reduction in cross-sectional area and increase an intake<br>
air amount due to expansion in cross-sectional area in a<br>
balanced manner.  As a result, filling efficiency is<br>
improved to increase power.<br>
[0053]<br>
Further, the fuel injection valve 79 for injecting a<br>
fuel to the expanding portion 70c is provided to the inlet<br>
pipe 68, and a fuel is injected from the fuel injection<br>
valve 79 to the expanding portion 70c of the intake paths<br>
70, so it is possible to suppress change in intake air flow<br>
rate due to nozzle arrangement of the fuel injection valve<br>
79 as much as possible.<br>
[0054]<br>
Further, since the expanding unit 70c corresponds to<br>
the connection portion between the cylinder head 22 and the<br>
inlet pipe 68 connected to the cylinder head 22, even if<br>
the cylinder head 22 and the inlet pipe 68 are separate<br>
members, a connection port diameter can be set relatively<br>
large, and parts can be easily processed and assembled.<br>
[0055]<br>
Further, the throttle portions 70a, 70b, are provided<br><br>
to a bent portion of the intake paths 70 formed in<br>
substantially U shape in section as viewed in a projected<br>
plan orthogonal to an axial line of the crank shaft 26 and<br>
parallel to a cylinder axial line, so the intake paths 70<br>
can be made compact and a cross-sectional area of the<br>
intake paths 70 can be largely changed by arranging the<br>
throttle portions 70a, 70b, in the bent portion.<br>
[0056]<br>
The embodiment of the present invention is described<br>
above, but the present invention is not limited to the<br>
above embodiment, and various modifications and changes can<br>
be made without departing from the scope of the invention.<br>
[0057]<br>
For example, the above embodiment describes the<br>
example where the cylinder head 22 and the inlet pipe 68<br>
are separate members, but the present invention is<br>
applicable to an internal combustion engine where the<br>
cylinder head 22 and the inlet pipe 68 are integrated.<br>
