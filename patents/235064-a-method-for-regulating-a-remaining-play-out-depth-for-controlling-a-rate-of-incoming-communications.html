				<td>A METHOD FOR REGULATING A REMAINING PLAY-OUT DEPTH OF A<br>
PLAY-OUT BUFFER IN A DESTINATION MOBILE UNIT AND A DEVICE<br>
FOR CONTROLLING A RATE OF INCOMING COMMUNICATIONS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a method for regulating a remaining play-out<br>
depth of a play-out buffer in a destination mobile unit and a device for controlling a<br>
rate of incoming communications and generally to two-way communication systems<br>
and more particularly to call management procedures within these systems.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Systems and methods for transmitting voice communications in a<br>
wireless manner are well known. In a wireless system, a sender at a source mobile<br>
unit may send a communication to a recipient at a destination mobile unit. The<br>
communication will usually be transmitted from the source mobile unit to the<br>
destination mobile unit across a wireless infrastructure.<br>
[0003] Typically, a voice coder (vocoder) at the source mobile unit is used to<br>
encode the communication to be transmitted, for example, into a sequence of frames.<br>
Before transmission to the destination mobile unit, the communication is often stored<br>
in a buffer or buffers within the infrastructure. Then, after the infrastructure locates<br>
the destination mobile unit, the infrastructure transmits the communication to the<br>
destination mobile unit. At the destination mobile unit, the communication can be<br>
stored in a "play-out" buffer. After a sufficient amount of voice data has been stored<br>
(or "queued") in the play-out buffer, the communication may then be sent to a<br>
vocoder at the destination mobile unit, where the message is decoded and converted<br>
into a format that enables the communication to be presented to the intended recipient,<br>
for example, as an audible signal at a speaker.<br>
[0004] One problem that arises in many of the above-mentioned systems is<br>
maintaining the audio quality and minimizing the delay of the voice messages played<br>
to the recipient. To achieve optimum audio quality and minimize delay, it is preferred<br>
that a continuous (or substantially continuous) stream of data flow from the play-out<br>
buffer to the vocoder at the destination mobile unit. However, if transmission errors,<br>
for example, frame erasures (FERs), occur between the source mobile unit and the<br>
infrastructure or from the infrastructure to the destination mobile unit, it is known that<br>
the play-out buffer will become empty (or nearly empty) while buffers in the<br>
infrastructure remain full (or nearly full). In other words, a large amount of<br>
information stored in the buffer in the infrastructure will only slowly drain to the play-<br>
out buffer. As the destination mobile unit waits for a sufficient amount of data to<br>
become available in the play-out buffer, a significant delay in the presentation of the<br>
voice message to the recipient and a possible degradation of signal quality may occur.<br>
[0005] Changing the vocoder rate may affect play-out buffer usage and<br>
previous systems have allowed for the alteration of vocoder rate based upon general<br>
measures of network congestion. This capability has not particularly improved the<br>
situation noted above. In fact, significant audio delays may still occur within these<br>
systems.<br>

[0011] Skilled artisans will appreciate that elements in the figures are<br>
illustrated for simplicity and clarity and have not necessarily been drawn to scale. For<br>
example, the dimensions of some of the elements in the figures may be exaggerated<br>
relative to other elements to help to improve understanding of various embodiments<br>
of the present invention. Also, common but well-understood elements that are useful<br>
or necessary in a commercially feasible embodiment are typically not depicted in<br>
order to facilitate a less obstructed view of these various embodiments of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Detailed Description of the Preferred Embodiments<br>
[0012] Pursuant to many of these embodiments, a system and method for<br>
controlling the operating characteristics of a buffer in a mobile unit is provided. At<br>
least one communication from a source mobile unit may be received in a play-out<br>
buffer at a destination mobile unit. The play-out buffer may have an associated play-<br>
out depth, which relates to the amount of data present in the play-out buffer or the<br>
amount of time that the target could continue to play audio before running out of<br>
audio, if the target were to stop receiving audio. The communications received at the<br>
play-out buffer may be played to a recipient at the destination mobile unit. The<br>
remaining play-out depth of the play-out buffer in the destination mobile unit may be<br>
determined. An indication may be formed and sent to the source mobile unit when<br>
the remaining play-out depth of the play-out buffer in the destination mobile unit<br>
reaches a predetermined threshold.<br>
[0013] Pursuant to a preferred embodiment, the communications from the<br>
source mobile unit to the destination mobile unit are encoded at a coding rate and<br>
transmitted to the destination mobile unit. The source mobile unit receives the<br>
indication transmitted from the destination mobile unit and then adjusts the coding<br>
rate of the communications sent from the source mobile unit to the destination mobile<br>
unit as a function, at least in part, of the indication received from the destination<br>
mobile unit or send the actual size of the play-out buffer.<br>
[0014] Pursuant to another preferred approach, the source mobile unit includes<br>
a vocoder and the coding rate of the source mobile unit is altered by adjusting the<br>
coding rate of this vocoder. In one embodiment, the indication is in the form of a<br>
real-time transport protocol (RTP) header. In another embodiment, the indication is<br>
in the form of a negative acknowledgment message (NAK). Conveniently, the NAK<br>
may be generated at either the destination mobile unit or within the infrastructure.<br>
[0015] Thus, the operating characteristics of the play-out buffer in the<br>
destination mobile unit are controlled by adjusting the coding rate of a vocoder in the<br>
source mobile unit. Advantageously, the information is communicated from the<br>
destination mobile unit to the source mobile unit quickly and in real-time so that<br>
effective adjustments can be made to the coding rate at the source mobile unit. These<br>
real-time adjustments minimize or eliminate audio-delay or audio-quality problems at<br><br>
the destination mobile unit created when the play-out buffer at the destination mobile<br>
unit is emptied (or nearly emptied) of data.<br>
[0016] Referring initially to FIG. 1, a system for controlling the operating<br>
characteristics of a buffer at a destination mobile unit preferably includes a source<br>
mobile unit 102, a wireless infrastructure 104, and a destination mobile unit 106. The<br>
source mobile unit 102 is communicatively coupled to the wireless infrastructure 104<br>
via a communication channel 108. The wireless infrastructure 104 is<br>
communicatively coupled to the destination mobile unit 106 via a communication<br>
channel 110 and optionally by a supplemental communication channel 112. The<br>
system of FIG. 1 may provide any type of telecommunication services. In one<br>
example, the system may provide Dispatch (DC) over Service Option (SO) 33 packet<br>
data services as is known in the art.<br>
[0017] The source and destination mobile units 102 and 106 may be any type<br>
of wireless communication device. For example, they may be any cellular phone,<br>
pager, personal digital assistant or any combination of these devices that is capable of<br>
transmitting and receiving information in a wireless manner. In addition, the mobile<br>
units 102 and 106 may conform to any standard or group of standards. In one<br>
example, the mobile units 102 and 106 may conform to the CDMA-2000 group of<br>
standards.<br>
[0018] The wireless infrastructure 104 may be any type of telecommunication<br>
infrastructure that is used to establish wireless communication sessions between<br>
different mobile units. For example, the wireless infrastructure 104 may include<br>
switches, routers, base stations, buffers, servers, and control units that transmit and<br>
route any type of communication between mobile units. The wireless infrastructure<br>
104 may conform to any standard or group of standard. In one example, the wireless<br>
infrastructure 104 may conform to the CDMA-2000 group of standards.<br>
[0019] The communication channels 108,110, and 112 may be any<br>
communication mechanism used to communicate any type of information between<br>
two points. In one example, they may include multiple channels, for example, traffic<br>
and control channels, as specified by the Radio Link Protocol (RLP) and the CDMA<br>
2000 group standards or by the Radio Link Control (RLC) and the 3GPP group of<br>
standards. Preferably, the communication channels 108, 110, and 112 support two-<br>
way communication.<br>
[0020] In one example of the operation of the system of FIG. 1, at least one<br>
communication is received at the destination mobile unit 106 from the source mobile<br>
unit 102. For example, the communication may be a voice communication, which has<br>
been encoded into a series of frames at a coding rate by a vocoder at the source<br>
mobile unit 102. The communication can be transmitted from the source mobile unit<br>
102 to the infrastructure 104 via the communication channel 108 and from the<br>
infrastructure 104 to the destination mobile unit 106 via the communication channel<br>
110.<br>
[0021] The destination mobile unit 106 may include a play-out buffer, which<br>
has an associated play-out depth. The play-out depth may be a measure of the<br>
amount of remaining space left in the play-out buffer or the amount of time that the<br>
target could continue to play audio before running out of audio, if the target were to<br>
stop receiving audio. The communication may be received at the play-out buffer and<br>
played to a recipient at the destination mobile unit 106.<br>
[0022] In a preferred approach, the destination mobile unit 106 determines the<br>
remaining play-out depth of the play-out buffer. An indication may be formed at the<br>
destination mobile unit 106 and sent to the source mobile unit 102 when the<br>
remaining play-out depth of the play-out buffer in the destination mobile unit 106<br>
reaches a predetermined threshold. The indication may use an existing construct, for<br>
example, an RTP header or NAK, to indicate that the rate of the vocoder should be<br>
adjusted by a predetermined amount. In another example, the construct may itself<br>
carry information containing the remaining play-out depth of the play-out buffer and<br>
the vocoder rate may be adjusted accordingly. Other examples of indications are<br>
possible.<br>
[0023] In one example, the indication is sent from the destination mobile unit<br>
106 to the infrastructure 104 via the communication channel 110 and from the<br>
infrastructure 104 to the source mobile unit 102 via the communication channel 108.<br>
In another example, the indication is sent from the destination mobile unit 106 to the<br>
infrastructure 104 via the supplemental communication channel 112 and from the<br>
infrastructure 104 to the source mobile unit 102 via the communication channel 108.<br><br>
In another example, a NAK may be generated by the infrastructure 104 upon<br>
determining that an expected frame has not been received. In this case, it is assumed<br>
that a transmission error has occurred and the vocoding rate should be adjusted. Thus,<br>
in this example, an indication need not be formed in the destination mobile unit 106,<br>
but may be generated (in the form of the NAK) in the infrastructure 104 and sent to<br>
the source mobile unit 102.<br>
[0024] The source mobile unit 102 may receive the indication. After<br>
analyzing the indication, the source mobile unit 102 may adjust the coding rate of the<br>
vocoder. For example, if the indication received is a NAK, then this NAK is analyzed<br>
to determine if the NAK originated because of a request for retransmission for a frame<br>
that was originally sent more than a threshold number of seconds in the past. A NAK<br>
received for a frame that was originally sent a longer time than the threshold can<br>
imply that the play-out buffer is low.<br>
(0025] The rate may be adjusted by a predetermined amount, for instance,<br>
decreased by more than 50 percent, or, if the indication includes the remaining play-<br>
out depth, by an appropriate amount based upon this depth. The change in coding rate<br>
causes information to drain from buffers in the infrastructure to the play-out buffer.<br>
[0026] Thus, the operating characteristics of the play-out buffer in the<br>
destination mobile unit 106 are controlled by adjusting the coding rate of a vocoder in<br>
the source mobile unit 102. Adjustments, can be made to the coding rate of the<br>
vocoder at the source mobile unit quickly and in real-time. By doing so, audio-delay<br>
and audio-quality problems at the destination mobile unit 106 may be reduced,<br>
avoided, or eliminated altogether.<br>
[0027] Referring now to FIG. 2, one example of a corresponding method is<br>
described. In this example, a source mobile unit transmits communications to a<br>
destination mobile unit via a wireless infrastructure. At step 202, the source mobile<br>
unit transmits a voice message to the infrastructure. For example, the source mobile<br>
unit may send a voice message including a plurality of frames of information over a<br>
traffic channel (TCH) that has been set up between the source mobile unit and the<br>
destination mobile unit.<br>
[0028] At step 204, the infrastructure receives the voice message. For<br>
example, the infrastructure may place the message in a re-sequencing queue. At step<br><br>
206, the frames may be re-sequenced. Re-sequencing the frames may be needed<br>
because the frames arrived out-of-order, as is the case when a frame is erased and<br>
needs to be retransmitted.<br>
[0029] At step 208, the frames may be placed in a transmission buffer in the<br>
infrastructure for transmission to the destination mobile unit. At step 210, the<br>
infrastructure sends the voice message to the destination mobile unit. For example,<br>
this may be accomplished over a standard wireless traffic channel.<br>
[0030] At step 212, the frames are received at the destination mobile unit and<br>
placed in a play-out buffer. At step 214, it may be determined whether the play-out<br>
depth of the play-out buffer has reached a predetermined threshold. At step 216,<br>
assuming the predetermined threshold has been reached, an indication is formed at the<br>
destination mobile unit and, at step 218, is sent from the destination mobile unit to the<br>
infrastructure. The indication may be sent via a standard communication channel or a<br>
supplemental communication channel.<br>
[0031] At step 220, the indication may be sent from the infrastructure to the<br>
source mobile unit. In one example, the information may be communicated from the<br>
destination mobile unit to the infrastructure via an RTP header or NAK. If the<br>
indication received is a NAK, then this NAK is analyzed to determine if the NAK<br>
originated because of a request for retransmission for a frame that was originally sent<br>
more than a threshold number of seconds in the past.<br>
[0032] Alternatively, a NAK may be generated by the infrastructure upon<br>
determining that an expected frame has not been received. In this case, it is assumed<br>
that a transmission error has occurred and the vocoding rate should be adjusted. Thus,<br>
in this example, an indication need not be formed in the destination mobile unit as<br>
described above, but may be generated (in the form of the NAK) in the infrastructure<br>
and sent to the source mobile unit.<br>
[0033] At step 222, the source mobile unit may receive the indication, analyze<br>
the indication, and determine an adjustment for the vocoder within the source mobile<br>
unit. At step 224, the vocoder rate of the source mobile unit may be adjusted based<br>
upon the indication.<br>
[0034] Referring now to FIG. 3, one example of a destination mobile unit<br>
suitable to support such actions is described. The mobile unit includes a terminator<br><br>
module 302 (including a RLP code unit 304 and re-sequencing queue 306), a play-out<br>
buffer 308, an indication register 310, a controller 312, a vocoder 314, a speaker 316,<br>
and a transceiver 318. The terminator module 302 is coupled to the transceiver 318<br>
and the controller 312. The controller 312 is coupled to the play-out buffer 308 and<br>
the indication register 310. The indication register 310 is coupled to the transceiver<br>
318. The play-out buffer 308 is coupled to the vocoder 314. The vocoder 314 is<br>
coupled to the speaker 316.<br>
[0035] The terminator module 302 includes the RLP code unit 304 and the re-<br>
sequencing queue 306. As is known in the art, the RLP code unit 304 controls the<br>
types of messages entering the re-sequencing queue 306. The re-sequencing queue<br>
306 assembles the frames received in the proper sequence. For example, the frames<br>
may be received out-of-order and the re-sequencing queue can assemble the frames in<br>
the proper order.<br>
[0036] The play-out buffer 308 may be any type of storage device that can<br>
store any type of data. For example, the play-out buffer 308 can be a standard buffer<br>
that holds voice frames. The play-out buffer 308 may have an associated play-out<br>
depth. The play-out depth may be a measure of how much data is in the play-out<br>
buffer 308 at the specified time or the amount of time that the destination mobile unit<br>
must wait to queue a voice message to the recipient or the amount of time that the<br>
target could continue to play audio before running out of audio, if the target were to<br>
stop receiving audio.<br>
[0037] A predetermined threshold may be determined for the play-out depth<br>
of the play-out buffer 308. If this threshold is reached, the play-out buffer has<br>
reached the play-out depth indicating that the amount of data in the play-out buffer<br>
308 has reached a lower threshold or the amount of time that the target could continue<br>
to play audio before running out of audio, if the target were to stop receiving audio,<br>
has reached a threshold.<br>
[0038] The indication register 310 can be used by the controller 312 to form<br>
an indication. The indication may take any number of forms. For example, it may be<br>
in the form of an RTP header. The indication can be used to indicate that the play-out<br>
buffer has reached the predetermined depth and that the coding rate of the vocoder<br>
should be adjusted. Alternatively, the indication may be generated as a NAK. Other<br><br>
forms of indications are possible. In addition, the indication may include the<br>
remaining play-out depth of the play-out buffer.<br>
[0039] The controller 312 may be any type of processor that is capable of<br>
executing computer instructions stored in a memory. The controller 312 may form<br>
the indication in the indication register 310, monitor the play-out-buffer 308 for the<br>
situation where the predetermined threshold is reached, and send the indication to the<br>
infrastructure (via the transceiver 318) when required.<br>
[00401 The vocoder 314 may be any type of audio processor that is capable of<br>
transforming analog speech signals into digital signals and converting digital signals<br>
into speech. For example, the vocoder 314 may receive data in a digital format and<br>
transform this data into electrical signals representing speech so that the speaker 316<br>
can play the voice message (represented by the message) in an audible format to a<br>
recipient.<br>
[0041J The speaker 316 can be any type of electrical or electronic device that<br>
can play electrical signals representing speech to the recipient. In one example, the<br>
speaker 316 is of the type commonly used in cellular phones.<br>
[0042] The transceiver 318 may be any type of device that is capable of<br>
receiving data transmitted in a wireless manner or transmitting data over a wireless<br>
communication channel. For example, the transceiver 318 may include an antenna,<br>
which may both receive data over a wireless channel and transmit data over a wireless<br>
channel.<br>
[0043] In one example of the operation of the mobile unit of FIG. 3, voice<br>
messages are received at the transceiver 318. The voice messages may be sent<br>
through the RLP code unit 304, which regulates which messages are allowed to enter<br>
the system. Next, the re-sequencing queue 306 may place the frames of the messages<br>
in the proper sequence. For example, if frames were numbered 1-6, but received in<br>
the order 1,3, 4, 5, 6, and 2, then the re-sequencing queue places the frames in the<br>
correct order (i.e., 1,2,3,4,5,6).<br>
[0044] The play-out buffer 308 may then receive the voice message. The<br>
play-out buffer 308 then may transmit the messages to the vocoder 314. The vocoder<br>
314 transforms the frames into an electrical signal. The electrical signal is preferably<br>
sent to the speaker 316, such that the recipient at the destination mobile unit can hear<br>
the voice message.<br>
[0045] The controller 312 may monitor the play-out depth of the play-out<br>
buffer 308. If the play-out depth reaches a predetermined value, then the controller<br>
312 may form an indication in the indication register. In one example, the indication<br>
can be in the form of an RTP header. Other examples and forms of indications are<br>
possible. The indication may then be sent to the transceiver 318 where the indication<br>
is transmitted to the infrastructure. After receipt, the infrastructure can transmit the<br>
indication to the source mobile unit.<br>
[0046] The transmission from the transceiver 318 can be accomplished over<br>
traffic channels as is known in the art. Alternatively, the transmission from the<br>
transceiver 318 may occur via a supplemental channel between the destination mobile<br>
unit and the infrastructure.<br>
[0047] Referring now to FIG. 4, one example of a source mobile unit suitable<br>
to support the above-mentioned actions is described. The mobile unit includes a<br>
microphone 402, a vocoder 404, an input buffer 406, a transceiver 408, a controller<br>
410, and a storage register 412. The microphone 402 is coupled to the vocoder 404.<br>
The vocoder 404 is coupled to the input buffer 406. The input buffer 406 is coupled<br>
to the transceiver 408. The transceiver 408 is coupled to the storage register 412. The<br>
storage register 412 is coupled to the controller 410. The controller 410 is coupled to<br>
the vocoder 404.<br>
[0048] The microphone 402 may be any device that receives human audio<br>
input and converts this into an electrical signal. In one example, the microphone may<br>
be any standard microphone used with a cellular phone.<br>
[0049] The vocoder 404 may be any type of audio processor that is capable of<br>
transforming analog speech signals into digital signals and converting digital signals<br>
into speech. For example, the vocoder 404 may receive data in an analog electrical<br>
signal and transform the signal into a digital, encoded format for transmission across a<br>
wireless network.<br>
[0050] The input buffer 406 may be any type of data storage device that stores<br>
information in any form. For example, the input buffer 406 may receive and store<br>
encoded voice frames from the vocoder 404.<br><br>
[0051] The transceiver 408 may be any type of device that is capable of<br>
receiving data transmitted in a wireless manner or transmitting data over a wireless<br>
communication channel. For example, the transceiver 408 may include an antenna,<br>
which may both receive data over a wireless channel and transmit data over a wireless<br>
channel.<br>
[0052] The controller 410 may be any type of device that executes computer<br>
instructions stored in a memory. For example, the controller 410 may analyze the<br>
contents of the storage register 412 to see if an indication exists in the storage<br>
register 412. The controller 410 may then determine whether to decrease or increase<br>
the coding rate of the vocoder 404 based upon the received indication in the storage<br>
register 412. If the indication includes the remaining play-out depth of the buffer, the<br>
controller 410 can determine the amount of adjustment to the vocoding rate. Other<br>
functions may be performed by the controller 410, as well.<br>
[0053] The storage register 412 may be any type of storage device that is used<br>
to hold any type of information. For example, the storage register 412 may hold the<br>
indication after the indication is received at the transceiver 408.<br>
[0054] In one example of the operation of the mobile unit of FIG. 4, a sender<br>
at the source mobile unit speaks a voice message into the microphone 402. The<br>
message may be received and encoded via the vocoder 404 at a coding rate. The<br>
message can be placed in the input buffer 406 in preparation for transmission. When<br>
ready, the controller 410 may transmit the message via the transceiver 408.<br>
[0055] In addition, the transceiver 408 may receive an indication. The storage<br>
register 412 may receive and store the indication received from the transceiver 408.<br>
For example, the indication may be in the form of a NAK or an RTP header. When<br>
an indication is received, the controller 410 may extract the indication from the<br>
storage register 412 and analyze the indication. The controller 410 may then adjust<br>
the coding rate of the vocoder 404 as required by or derived from the indication (or<br>
information included in the indication). For example, the coding rate may be reduced<br>
by one-half upon receipt of any RTP header or NAK. In another example, the RTP<br>
header may include information relating to the size of the play-out buffer. The<br>
controller 412 may extract this information and adjust the coding rate as required.<br>
[0056] Referring now to FIG. 5, one example of a wireless infrastructure<br>
suitable to support such actions is described. The wireless infrastructure includes a<br>
transceiver 502, an RLP terminator unit 504 (including and RLP code unit 506 and an<br>
RLP re-sequencing queue 508), controller 510, output buffer 512, transceiver 514,<br>
and an input buffer 516. The transceiver 502 is coupled to the RLP terminator unit<br>
504. The RLP terminator unit 504 is coupled to the controller 510. The controller<br>
510 is coupled to the output buffer 512, input buffer 516, and transceiver 502. The<br>
input buffer 516 is coupled to the transceiver 514.<br>
[0057] The transceiver 502 may be any type of device that is capable of<br>
receiving data transmitted in a wireless manner or transmitting data over a wireless<br>
communication channel. For example, the transceiver 502 may include an antenna,<br>
which may both receive data over a wireless channel and transmit data over a wireless<br>
channel.<br>
[0058] The RLP terminator unit 504 includes the RLP code unit 506 and the<br>
RLP re-sequencing queue 508. The RLP code unit 506 may regulate the flow of<br>
information into the re-sequencing queue 508. The RLP re-sequencing queue 508<br>
may place the frames of the messages in the proper sequence. For example, if frames<br>
were numbered 1-6, but received in the order 5,4,6,3,2,1, then the re-sequencing<br>
queue 508 may place the frames in the correct order (i.e., 1,2,3,4,5,6).<br>
[0059] The controller 510 may be any type of processor that routes<br>
information within the infrastructure. The controller 510 may perform other functions<br>
as well. In one example, the controller is a chat server as is known in the art.<br>
[0060] The input buffer 512 and output buffer 516 may be any type of data<br>
storage devices that store information in any form. For example, the output buffer<br>
512 may store frames of the voice message before the frames are transmitted from the<br>
infrastructure to the destination mobile unit. In another example, the input buffer 516<br>
may store an indication as received from the destination mobile unit (via the<br>
transceiver 514).<br>
[0061 ] The RLP transceiver 514 may be any type of device that transmits<br>
and/or receives voice messages in a wireless fashion. For example, the transceiver<br>
514 may include an antenna. In one example, the transmitter 514 may be omitted and<br>
transmissions may occur from the transceiver 502.<br><br>
[0062] In one example of the operation of the infrastructure of FIG. 5, voice<br>
messages may be received at the transceiver 502. The voice messages may be<br>
received by the RIP code unit 506 (within the RLP terminator unit 504). After the<br>
RLP code unit 506 places the messages into the re-sequencing queue 508 (within the<br>
RLP terminator unit 504), the re-sequencing queue 508 may place the frames in the<br>
correct sequence, if the frames were received out-of-sequence. The re-sequencing<br>
queue 508 may send the frames to the controller 510.<br>
[0063] The controller 510 can route the messages from the RLP terminator<br>
unit 504 to the output buffer 512. When ready for transmission, the controller 510<br>
initiates transmission and the messages are sent from the output buffer 512 to the<br>
transmitter 514. The frames may then be transmitted to the destination mobile unit.<br>
[0064] In another example of the operation of the infrastructure of FIG. 5, an<br>
RTP header may be received at the transceiver 514. The RTP header may be routed<br>
through the infrastructure, for example, by the controller 510, and can be transmitted<br>
to the source mobile unit via the transceiver 502.<br>
[0065] Alternatively, a NAK may be generated by the infrastructure, for<br>
instance, by the controller 510, upon determination that an expected frame has not<br>
been received. In this case, it is assumed that a transmission error has occurred and<br>
the vocoding rate should be adjusted. Thus, in this example, an indication need not be<br>
formed in the destination mobile unit as described above, but may be generated (in the<br>
form of the NAK) in the infrastructure and sent to the source mobile unit.<br>
[0066] While there have been illustrated and described particular<br>
embodiments of the present invention, it will be appreciated that numerous changes<br>
and modifications will occur to those skilled in the art, and it is intended in the<br>
appended claims to cover all those changes and modifications which fall within the<br>
true spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
