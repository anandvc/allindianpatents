"A METHOD FOR RECOVERING CARBON DIOXIDE FROM A GAS<br>
  STREAM AND AN APPARTUS THEREOF<br>
PRAXAIR TECHNOLOGY, INC., Technology Licensors, a corporation organized and existing under the laws of the State of Delaware, United States of America, of 39 Old Ridgebury Road, Danbury, State of Connecticut 06810-5113, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a method for recovering carbon dioxide from a gas stream and an apparatus thereof.<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates generally to the production of carbon dioxide.<br>
Background Art<br>
Carbon dioxide has a large number of uses.  For example, carbon dioxide is used to carbonate beverages, to chill, freeze and package seafood, meat, poultry, baked goods, fruits and vegetables, and to extend the shelf-life of dairy products.  It is an important environmental component in industrial waste and process water treatment as a replacement for sulfuric acid to control pH levels.  Other uses included drinking water treatment, an environmentally-friendly pesticide and an atmosphere additive in greenhouses to improve the growth of vegetables.<br>
Generally carbon dioxide is produced by purifying a waste stream which is a by-product of an organic or inorganic chemical process.  The waste stream comprises carbon dioxide and water soluble contaminants from the chemical process, and the carbon dioxide must be cleaned of these contaminants prior to recovery.  The cleaning results in the loss of some of the carbon dioxide.<br>
As the demand for carbon dioxide continues to increase, more effective and efficient carbon dioxide cleaning systems are desirable in order to cost effectively improve the recovery of the carbon dioxide.<br><br>
Accordingly it is an object of this invention to provide a system which can effectively process a crude carbon dioxide feed stream which contains water soluble contaminants in a more efficient manner than that possible with conventional carbon dioxide processing systems thereby improving the recovery of the carbon dioxide.<br>

Brief Description Of The Drawing<br>
The sole Figure is schematic representation of one particularly preferred embodiment of the invention wherein the feed stream additionally comprises light contaminants and multiple compression and pressure reduction stages are employed.<br>
Detailed Description<br>
The invention will be described in detail with reference to the Drawing.  Referring now to the Figure, gas stream 20 comprises generally from about 90 to 99 mole percent carbon dioxide and up to about 1.0 mole percent water soluble contaminants along with water vapor.  In the embodiment of the invention illustrated in the Figure, gas stream 20 also comprises light contaminants, typically in a concentration up to about 5 mole percent.<br>
Crude carbon dioxide gas stream 20 is cooled in heat exchanger 1 by indirect heat exchange with a suitable fluid such as forced air, cooling water or a liquid refrigerant, and then passed in stream 21 into phase separator 2 wherein it is separated into a gas portion and a liquid water portion.  The gas portion is passed as feed or gas stream 22 to compressor 5 wherein it is compressed to a pressure generally within the range of from about 4 to 6 atmospheres to produce compressed gas stream 23.<br>
Compressed gas stream 23 comprising carbon dioxide, water vapor and water soluble contaminants as well as light contaminants is cooled in aftercooler 6 by indirect heat exchange with a suitable fluid such as forced air, cooling water or a liquid refrigerant.  The<br><br>
resulting two-phase fluid is passed in stream 24 into phase separator 7 wherein it is separated into a carbon dioxide-richer gas stream 25, which also contains water soluble contaminants and light contaminants, and also into remaining liquid which is primarily water.<br>
Carbon dioxide-richer gas stream 25 is passed to compressor 9 wherein it is further compressed to a pressure generally within the range of from about 15 to 25 atmospheres to produce further compressed gas stream 26.  Further compressed gas stream 26 comprising carbon dioxide and water soluble contaminants as well as light contaminants is cooled in aftercooler 10 by indirect heat exchange with a suitable fluid such as forced air, cooling water or a liquid refrigerant.  The resulting two-phase fluid is passed in stream 27 into phase separator 11 wherein it is separated into further carbon dioxide-richer gas stream 28, which also contains water soluble contaminants and light contaminants, and also into further remaining liquid which is primarily water.<br>
Carbon dioxide-richer gas stream 28 is passed into the lower portion of absorption column 13 and flows up the absorption column.  Water 29 is pressurized by passage through mechanical pump 15 to a pressure sufficient for introduction into the top of absorption column 13, generally within the range of from 250 to 370 pounds per square inch absolute (psia). Pressurized water 30 is directed through flow/pressure control valve 14 and then as stream 31 is passed into the upper portion of absorption column 13 and down the absorption column.<br><br>
Absorption column 13 is a vertically oriented vessel generally having random or structured packing as the column internals, i.e. vapor/liquid contact elements, although the column internals may also comprise trays.  The column internals serve to facilitate contact between the descending water and the rising gas.  As the water descends within absorption column 13 in countercurrent flow to the ascending gas, water soluble contaminants are passed from the rising gas into solution within the descending water so that the descending water is progressively enriched in the water soluble contaminants and the rising gas is progressively depleted of the water soluble contaminants.  In addition, some carbon dioxide from the rising gas is absorbed into the downflowing water. This results in the production of cleaned carbon dioxide at the top of column 13 and contaminant-bearing water which also contains some carbon dioxide gas absorbed therein at the bottom of column 13.<br>
The cleaned carbon dioxide is withdrawn from the upper portion of column 13 in stream 32 and, if desired, may be recovered directly.  The embodiment of the invention illustrated in the Figure is a particularly preferred embodiment wherein the cleaned carbon dioxide undergoes additional processing steps prior to recovery.  In the embodiment illustrated in the Figure, gas stream 32 is further cleaned of any remaining water soluble contaminants as well as of water vapor picked up in the countercurrent upflow within column 13 by passage through adsorber 16 which may comprise one or more beds of activated carbon and/or silica.  If desired, as illustrated in the<br><br>
Figure, the resulting further cleaned and dried gas 33 may be passed from adsorber 16 to refrigerative means 18 wherein it is cooled and any remaining water is condensed and removed.<br>
As mentioned earlier, in the embodiment of the invention illustrated in the Figure the feed gas also contains light contaminants.  In this case the cleaned and dried carbon dioxide gas stream may be passed as stream 34 into a distillation column, illustrated in representational fashion in the Figure as element 19, wherein it is separated by rectification into purified carbon dioxide 35 and light contaminant top vapor 36. The purified carbon dioxide 35 is recovered as a fluid comprising from about 99.9 to 99.999 mole percent carbon dioxide.<br>
The contaminant-bearing water  is withdrawn from the lower portion of column 13 in stream 37.  Further remaining liquid is withdrawn from phase separator 11 in stream 38, passed through valve 12 and as stream 39 combined with stream 37 to form combined stream 40. Stream 40 is passed through pressure reducing device 17 which in the embodiment illustrated in the Figure is an expansion valve.  Pressure reducing device 17 could be other pressure reducing means such as a turboexpander. As contaminant-bearing water stream 40 passes through pressure reducing device 17, its pressure is reduced, generally to be within the range of from 4 to 6 atmospheres, and in the process carbon dioxide gas, which had been absorbed into the contaminant-bearing water, is released resulting in the generation of  two phase stream 41 comprising contaminant-bearing water and gaseous carbon dioxide.  Two-phase stream 41 is<br><br>
passed into phase separator 7 wherein the released gaseous carbon dioxide in stream 41 is passed into the carbon dioxide-richer stream for eventual passage into absorption column 13 and ultimately for recovery.  In this way, some carbon dioxide in the original gas stream 20, which would otherwise have been lost as a consequence of the cleaning process, is recaptured and recovered thus improving the recovery of carbon dioxide in the cleaning system.<br>
The contaminant-bearing water combines with remaining liquid in phase separator 7 and is passed out from phase separator 7 in stream 42 and through pressure reducing device 8, such as an expansion valve or turboexpander, wherein its pressure is reduced generally to be within the range of from 1 to 2 atmospheres.  In the process remaining carbon dioxide gas still absorbed within the contaminant-bearing water is released resulting in the generation of two phase stream 43 comprising contaminant-bearing water and gaseous carbon dioxide.  Two phase stream 43 is passed into phase separator 2 wherein the released gaseous carbon dioxide in stream 43 is passed into the gas forming gas stream 22 for eventual passage into absorption column 13 and ultimate recovery, thus further improving the carbon dioxide recovery.  The residual contaminant-bearing water is combined with the liquid portion of stream 21 in phase separator 2, withdrawn from phase separator 2 in stream 44, passed through valve 33 and as stream 45 passed to capture means, e.g. chemical sewer, 4 for ultimate disposal.<br>
With the practice of this invention recovery of carbon dioxide from any given crude carbon dioxide feed<br><br>
stream can be increased by from 0.5 to 1.0 percent over conventional systems which clean a crude carbon dioxide gas stream of water soluble contaminants.<br>
Although the invention has been described in detail with reference to a certain particularly preferred embodiment, those skilled in the art will recognize that there are other embodiments of the invention within the spirit and the scope of the claims.<br><br>
