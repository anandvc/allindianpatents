Tn	Novel Process for amorphous Atorvastatin calcium<br>
p<br><br>

Filed of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a novel process for the preparation of amorphous atorvastatin calcium salt. The atorvastatin calcium chemically known as (pR, 5R)-2-(4-Fluorophenyl)-p,5-dihydroxy-5-(l-methylethyl)-3-phenyI-4"[(phenylamino)carbonyl]-lH-pyrrole-1-heptanoic acid calciimi salt represented by the following compound of formula-1,<br>
Formula- 1<br>
Atorvastatin is a member of the class of drugs called statins. Statin drugs are currently the most therapeutically effective drugs available for reducing low density lipoprotein (LDL) particle concentration in the blood stream of patients at risk for cardiovascular disease. A high level of LDL in the blood stream has been linked to the formation of coronary lesions which obstruct the flow of blood and can rupture and promote thrombosis.<br>
The statin drugs interfere with the synthesis of cholesterol and other sterols in the liver by competitively inhibiting the 3-hydroxy-3-methyl-glutaryl-coenzyme. A reductase enzyme (HMG-CoA reductase). HMG-CoA reductase catalyses the conversion of HMG to mevalonate, which is the rate determining step in the biosynthesis of cholesterol, and so, its inhibition leads to a reduction in the concentration of cholesterol in the liver. Very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) is the biological vehicle for transporting cholesterol and triglycerides form the liver to peripheral cells. VLDL is cataboliszed in the peripheral cells which release fatty acids which may be stored in adopcytes. The VLDL is converted to intermediate density lipoprotein (IDL), which is either removed by an LDL receptor, or is converted to LDL, Decreased production of cholesterol leads to an increase in the number of LDL receptors and corresponding reduction in the production of LDL particles<br><br>
by metabolism of IDL. Atorvastatin calcium marketed under the brand name LIPITOR® by Pfizer, Inc.<br>
Background of the Invention:<br>
Atorvastatin was first disclosed in US patent number 4,681,893. The atorvastatin hemi-calcium salt is disclosed in US patent number 5,273,995. This patent teaches that the hemi-calcium salt is obtained by crystallization from a brine solution resulting from the transposition of the sodium salt with calcium chloride and further purified by recrystallisation from a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane. The main drawback of this process is the recrystallisation from a mixture of ethyl acetate and hexane leads to the solvated crystalline solids.<br>
US patent number 6613916 discloses a process for the preparation of amorphous atorvastatin calcium, which comprises of dissolving atorvastatin in a freely soluble solvent like lower molecular weight alcohol, ketone or ester and precipitating amorphous atorvastatin with a solvent in which atorvastatin is insoluble or slightly soluble, such as ether.<br>
US patent number 6646133 discloses a process for the preparation of amorphous atorvastatin calcium, which comprises of dissolving crude amorphous atorvastatin calcium in a lower alkanol containing C2-C4 carbon atoms or a mixture by heating and isolated the amorphous atorvastatin calcium precipitated by cooling.<br>
US patent number 6274470 discloses a process for the preparation of amorphous atorvastatin calcium, which comprises of dissolving in tetrahydroflxran or toluene or mixtures thereof and isolating amorphous form.<br>
International publication WO 2002/43732 discloses processes for the preparation of amorphous atorvastatin calcium, which comprises of treating any form of atorvastatin calcium with acetone at room temperature to reflux temperature for between a few hours to 25 hours, followed by drying in oven, or by sonicating any form of atorvastatin hemi-calcium in acetonitrile. This patent also discloses process for the preparation of amorphous form via ball milling of any crystalline form.<br>
International publication WO 2002/057228 discloses a process for the preparation of amorphous atorvastatin calcium comprises of dissolving a mixture of amorphous and<br><br>
crystalline atorvastatin in non-hydroxylic solvent followed by the addition of a suitable non-hydroxylic solvent to precipitate the product which is then isolated.<br>
International publication WO 2002/059087 discloses a process for the preparation of amorphous atorvastatin hemi-calcium salt in which atorvastatin in the form of either the lactone or a hydroxyl and carboxylic acid protected form in a non-hydroxylic solvent is converted to free hydroxyl, free acid and then treated with water followed by a solvent immiscible or slightly miscible with water.<br>
International publications WO 2002/083637 and WO 2002/083638 discloses a process for the preparation of amorphous atorvastatin calcium starting from diol protected tertiary butyl ester.<br>
Intemational publication WO 2003/018547 discloses a process for the preparation of amorphous atorvastatin calcium comprises of hydrolyzing the lactone form of atorvastatin with aqueous alkali or alkaline earth metal base, extracting with organic solvent, adding the same to an anti-solvent to precipitate the product and isolated by filtration.<br>
Intemational publication WO 2003/099785 discloses a process for the preparation of amorphous atorvastatin calcium, which comprises of dissolving form I or a mixture of crystalline and amorphous atorvastatin calcium in a solvent consisting of aliphatic acyclic ketone, filtering the solution and removing the solvent at 40 to 50°C under vacuimi.<br>
Intemational publication WO 2003/093233 discloses a process for the preparation of amorphous atorvastatin calcium, which comprises of dissplving atorvastatin calcium in an organic solvent miscible with water, gradually adding said solution to water while stirring, and filtering followed by the vacuum drying.<br>
Intemational publication WO 2003/068739 discloses a process for the preparation of amorphous atorvastatin calcium, which comprises of precipitating amorphous atorvastatin from the solution containing atorvastatin calcium with C5-C12 hydrocarbons.<br>
Intemational publication WO 2003/078379 discloses a process for the preparation amorphous atorvastatin calcium, which comprises of dissolving the crystalline and amorphous atorvastatin in a hydroxylic solvent followed by freeze drying or spray drying.<br><br>
Amorphous atorvastatin produced as per the prior art process is not stable more over the known process lacking of reproducibility.<br>
