				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a magnetic subsystem for modular electric equipment<br>
and electric circuit breaker.<br>
Circuit-breakers for line protection generally consist of a modular box in plastic mould, a<br>
circuit between two terminals and comprising a bimetallic thermostatic release to protect<br>
the line from overloads and, an electromagnetic unit between the binding post and a<br>
fixed contact, for cutting-off the magnetic release mechanism, often grouped along with<br>
these two components to form a magnetic subsystem.<br>
The magnetic release mechanism consists mainly of a coil with a moving core, linked<br>
with a striker for breaking the circuit, in case of excess current, by opening a moving<br>
contact operating along with a fixed contact.<br>
In most cases the release mechanism consists, specifically, of an induction coil mounted<br>
length-wise in a magnetic frame and wound around a moving core, to which a striker is<br>
linked, a tension spring placed between the cores to complete the assembly. This spring<br>
serves mainly to return the moving core to its open position, <br>
placing striker in the idle position, that is to say, at the distance of a mechanical lock<br>
enabling to open the contacts by changing the moving contact.<br>
The frame consists of a sheet of magnetic material, which is generally wound around<br>
the coil for correctly channeling the electric field patterns produced, when a current is<br>
passed through the coil. During assembly of the circuit breaker, the magnetic<br>
subsystems mounted in a single unit are then placed in a portion of the plastic mould of<br>
the box.<br>
It can be inferred from the function of these magnetic subsystems, that they are the<br>
essential components of the circuit breakers, and hence utmost care should be taken<br>
regarding their design, including numerous tests to prove the validity of proposed<br>
solutions. The main function being linked to the extremely high excess currents, some of<br>
these are naturally carried out under different configurations of short-circuit, or at the<br>
least, with current strengths many times their nominal value, based on which the<br>
performance of the magnetic subsystems are measured.<br>
During these periods of functioning under extreme conditions, one of the specifically and<br>
rigorously controlled parameters is the pulling force of the contacts. The purpose of<br>
these controls and the resulting adjustments is to improve the release conditions of the<br>
mechanical lock by an improved control of an electromagnetic release mechanism and<br>
the conveyed force of the striker.<br>
Heating of the various parts of the magnetic subsystem is also a sensitive parameter,<br>
for which tests under nominal or slightly higher intensity are carried out with a view to<br>
reduce it as much as possible.<br>
Thus it is known how to make magnetic subsystems on modular electronic equipment of<br>
the circuit-breaker type, which consists of: -<br>
an induction coil<br>
a moving magnetic core<br>
- a striker moving with the moving core<br>
an elastic return device required for the movement of the striker.<br>
Magnetic subsystems having a fixed guide roller, in which the moving core linked to the<br>
striker, as well as a fixed magnetic core, are known.<br>
While taking into account the functional parameters, particularly those pertaining to<br>
safety and which ensure reliability of pulling away in case of excess current, it becomes<br>
difficult to change any of the parameters without affecting the other functional<br>
parameters.<br>
One objective of the present invention is to reduce the number of components<br>
constituting this magnetic subsystem and to simplify them to facilitate assembly, while<br>
still preserving the reliability of this magnetic subsystem.<br>
Another objective of this invention is to improve the performance of this magnetic<br>
subsystem without increasing its size, so as to facilitate its integration on modular<br>
electric equipment.<br>
As per the invention, the moving core is housed in a moving support driven by a moving<br>
core, integral with the striker.<br>
Thus we have a moving mechanical subsystem with a simplified configuration whose<br>
assembly into the frame is also simplified.<br>
According to one embodiment, the moving support and the striker are made in one<br>
piece, say in plastic material.<br>
For example the moving support is a cylindrical part, one of whose ends in a rod<br>
constituting the striker. Thus the number of magnetic subsystem components is reduced<br>
and we have a relatively simple assembly, considering that it is enough to introduce the<br>
moving core into the roller of the moving support so as to obtain the moving magnetic<br>
subsystem.<br>
Furthermore, the moving core is devoid of any chamfer, drilled hole or spot facing, thus<br>
increasing its polar surface area. Also, the stage of integrating the striker on the moving<br>
core is not necessary.<br>
For instance the elastic return device is mounted between the moving support and the<br>
magnetic frame. This elastic return device consists of, for example, a flexible strip. The<br>
positioning of this elastic return device avoids all interaction between the magnetic<br>
electric field patterns generated in the air gap. The performance of the magnetic<br>
subsystem is thus improved and its assembly in the frame is simplified by its<br>
configuration.<br>
Following this example, the magnetic subsystem contains a device for guiding the striker<br>
by translatory movement.<br>
The guiding device contains, for example, an opening in the frame, passing through the<br>
striker.<br>
Guiding the translatory movement of the striker indirectly results in guiding the<br>
translatory movement of the moving support and thereby, the moving mechanical<br>
subsystem. No further guiding mechanism is necessary, thus contributing to reduction in<br>
the number of parts constituting the magnetic subsystem as per this invention.<br>
According to another embodiment, the guiding device contains an opening, maintained<br>
in a fixed core and passing through the striker.<br>
The magnetic core, for example, is fixed to be integral with the frame.<br>
According to an embodiment, the frame is made of magnetic material, constituting an<br>
additional fixed magnetic element.<br>
As per an embodiment for the magnetic subsystem according to this invention, a part of<br>
the frame, facing the polar face of the moving magnetic core, constitutes the fixed<br>
additional magnetic element.<br>
The magnetic subsystem as per this invention thus offers the advantage of being<br>
adaptable to various constraints, both from the structural and the functional aspects.<br>
According to one embodiment, the induction coil is a coil with out-of joint turns. The<br>
number of turns may be reduced advantageously in as much as the polar surface of the<br>
magnetic core is increased.<br>
The absence of contact between adjacent turns also obviates the necessity of coating<br>
them with electric insulating enamel, thus contributing to reduction of the manufacturing<br>
cost of such an induction coil, without however affecting the performance of the<br>
magnetic subsystem.<br>
According to an embodiment, the induction coil's ends widen tangentially the coil turns.<br>
Such a configuration enables to avoid bending operations on these ends and thereby<br>
reduces the manufacturing cost of such an induction coil.<br>
The present invention finds its application particularly in the domain of electric circuit<br>
breakers, incorporating a magnetic subsystem as described above.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to a magnetic subsystem for modular<br>
electric equipment of the circuit breaker type, comprising an induction coil; a moving<br>
magnetic core; a striker moving along with the moving core; an elastic return device<br>
required for the displacement of the striker characterised in that the moving core is<br>
housed in a moving support, driven by the moving core and integral with the striker.<br>
The present invention also relates to an electric circuit-breaker comprising: a<br>
fixed contact, to which the first end of the induction coil is connected, a binding post<br>
connecting to the subsystem, to which the first end of the induction coil is connected, a<br>
magnetic subsystem conforming to one of the claims 1 to 14.<br>
Other features and advantages will also emerge from the detailed description<br>
given below, without being limited to this, with references to the accompanying<br>
drawings as follows:-<br>

invention.<br>

conforming to this invention.<br>
- Figure 8 represents a circuit breaker incorporating a magnetic subsystem<br>
• conforming to this invention.<br>
The magnetic subsystem, represented for example in figure 1, consists of a magnetic<br>
frame (1), made from a magnetic material as well as an induction coil (2) to be mounted<br>
length-wise in the frame (1).<br>
The frame (1) enables to at least partially channelise the magnetic electric field patterns<br>
generated by an electric current passing through the induction coil (2).<br>
According to another embodiment, the frame (1) may be non magnetic.<br>
The magnetic subsystem also consists of a moving magnetic core (3) made of magnetic<br>
material, for example steel. The core (3) has a practically cylindrical form with two polar<br>
faces (4) and (5).<br>
A striker (6) moving along with the moving core (3) is also provided and it enables to<br>
break an electric contact while it moves from an idle position to an active one.<br>
An elastic return device is provided in such a manner as required by the displacement of<br>
the striker (6). Thus, while the flow of electric current in the induction coil (2) is<br>
interrupted, the elastic return device (7a, 7b) brings the striker (6) automatically back to<br>
its idle position and the electric contact can be closed once again.<br>
A fixed contact (8), to which is connected a first end (2a) of the induction coil (2), is<br>
integral with the frame (1). A contact pad (9) is advantageously attached to the fixed<br>
contact (8).<br>
A binding post (10) for connecting to the magnetic subsystem, to which a second end<br>
(2b) of the coil (2) is connected, is also provided.<br>
The magnetic subsystem represented in figure (2) has an air gap (11) between the polar<br>
face (5) of the moving core (3) and an internal face (12) of the frame (1), with (5) and<br>
(12) facing each other. A part of the frame (1) facing the polar face (5) of the moving<br>
magnetic core (3) then constitutes a fixed magnetic core.<br>
In this embodiment, the air gap (11) partially separates the magnetic core from the<br>
magnetic coil (2).<br>
The moving core (3) is also simplified in form, which is for example, cylindrical.<br>
The binding post (10) extends advantageously over the magnetic part (10a) covering<br>
the length of the coil (2) and helps channelise partly the magnetic electric field patterns<br>
generated by the induction coil (2). Thus the frame (1) and also the magnetic part, (10a)<br>
together delimit a housing in which the magnetic coil (2) is inserted.<br>
According to the embodiment represented in figure 7, the magnetic subsystem<br>
comprises a fixed magnetic core (3a) integral with the frame (1) and through which the<br>
striker (6) passes. The air gap (11) is localised between the polar faces opposite each<br>
other, the moving core (3) and the fixed core (3a). The air gap (11) occupies then the<br>
inside volume delimited by the magnetic coil (2). The fixed core (3a) is fitted on the<br>
frame (1) by any known means, mainly by forced mounting or welding.<br>
The moving core (3) is housed in a moving support (13) driven by the above said<br>
moving core (3), integral with the striker (6). Thus a moving magnetic subsystem is<br>
obtained, moved by the flow of excess current in the induction coil (2). The dimensions<br>
of the moving core (3) and the air gap (11) are chosen based on the force necessary for<br>
enabling the striker (6) to pull away a moving contact (8a) resting on the contact pad (9)<br>
and break the electric circuit in the induction coil (2). Once the electric circuit is broken in<br>
the induction coil (2), the elastic return device helps the moving mechanical subsystem,<br>
that is, the moving core (3) and the moving support (13), with the striker (6) return to its<br>
idle position.<br>
It is advantageous to make the moving support (13) and the striker (6) as an integrated<br>
unit, for example with plastic material or any other insulating material. The moving<br>
support (13) is a cylindrical unit, whose one end terminates in the striker rod (6). The<br>
manufacture of such moving support (13) by injection is very simple and its dimensions<br>
are chosen in such a manner as to be integral with the moving core (3) by means of a<br>
simple fitting operation. Other known technical processes of the gluing type may also be<br>
used to make the moving core (3) integral with the moving support (13).<br>
The elastic return device is mounted between the moving support (13) and the magnetic<br>
frame (1). This elastic return device is for example characterised by a flexible strip (7a)<br>
having openings for passage of the positioning plugs (1a), adequate numbers of these<br>
are available on the frame (1).<br>
In the embodiment shown in figure 2 or 7, it is evident that the striker (6) passes through<br>
the opening (1b) maintained in the frame (1). This opening (1b) constitutes a means of<br>
producing a translatory movement of the striker (6) and indirectly, a translatory<br>
movement of the moving mechanical subsystem, this being connected to the frame (1)<br>
through the elastic return device. In the embodiment shown in figure 7, the fixed core<br>
(3a) engaged in the opening (1b), serves as a guiding unit for the striker (6).<br>
The induction coil (2) advantageously has out-of-joint turns. Considering that the polar<br>
face (5) is relatively important and that it should not have any recess, chamfer or bore<br>
which may alter the magnetic electric field patterns, the reduction in the number of turns<br>
around the moving core (3) helps maintain, rather improve, the performance of the<br>
magnetic subsystem.<br>
Besides, the separation or the absence of contact between adjacent turns obviates the<br>
need for any enamel type of insulation coating on the turns.<br>
The ends (2a) and (2b) of the induction coil (2) spread tangentially the turns of the coil<br>
(2). The bending operation of these ends (2a, 2b) is eliminated. Thus the cost price of<br>
such an induction coil (2) is reduced for more than one reason.<br>
The elastic return device may also be made with an elastic strip (7b) integral with the<br>
moving support (13), as shown in the example on figures 3 to 5. The elastic strip (7b)<br>
extends on the outside of the moving support roller (13) in the form of an outer rim. This<br>
then rests on a side face (1a) of the frame (1). During movement of the moving support<br>
(13), the elastic strip (7b) is distorted and then resumes its initial form once the electric<br>
current circuit is broken in the induction coil (2), bringing it back to its idle position on the<br>
striker (6).<br>
According to another embodiment of this invention, the magnetic subsystem, as shown<br>
in the example on figure (6), the elastic return device consists of an elastic washer (7c)<br>
positioned in the air gap (11). The elastic washer (7c) rests on the inner face (12) of the<br>
frame (1) and on one of the ends of the moving support (13). During the movement of<br>
the moving support (13), the elastic washer (7c) is compressed. Once the electric circuit<br>
in the induction coil (2) is broken, this elastic washer (7c) made of plastic or metallic<br>
material or foam, resumes its initial position and brings the moving support (13) back to<br>
its open position corresponding to the idle position of the striker (6).<br>
In another embodiment, the frame (1) is non magnetic and no fixed magnetic core is<br>
linked to this frame (1). The movement of the moving core (3) is obtained by means of a<br>
given location zone with magnetic electric field patterns of maximum density, towards<br>
which it is moved. Such a movement is sufficient to activate the striker (6).<br>
Figure (8) represents a partially sectioned view for clarity, of a circuit breaker (15)<br>
according to this invention. The circuit breaker (15), incorporating a magnetic subsystem<br>
as per this invention, comprises a modular box (16) provided with fasteners (17), for<br>
example a support of the rail type of mounting (not shown in the figure).<br>
The circuit breaker (15) has an activating unit of the changing lever type (18), helping<br>
move the moving contact (8a) between an open and a closed position (refer figure 8) of<br>
the electric connection with fixed contact (8).<br>
In case of excess current, the striker (6) acts on a mechanical lock (19) known in the<br>
trade, which displaces the moving contact (8a) for opening the electric connection with<br>
the fixed contact (8). This opening operation breaks the electric circuit between the<br>
binding posts (10) of the circuit-breaker and automatically brings the lever (18) to the<br>
position corresponding to the separation of fixed contact (8) and moving contact (8a),<br>
with the help of the mechanical lock (19).<br>
The mechanical lock (19) may be put to action by breaking the circuit, either by means<br>
of the striker (6) or a bimetal thermostatic release incorporated in the circuit breaker (15)<br>
(not shown in the figures).<br>
