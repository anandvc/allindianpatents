COSMETIC W/O EMULSIONS WITH INORGANIC SUNSCREEN STABILIZED WITH CONJUGATED LINOLEIC ACID<br>
HINDUSTAN UNILEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 and having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai -400 020, Maharashtra, India<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br>
WO 2007/073909	PCT/EP2006/012248<br>
1<br>
COSMETIC W/O EMULSIONS WITH INORGANIC SUNSCREEN STABILIZED WITH CONJUGATED LINOLEIC ACID<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
5     The invention concerns cosmetic emulsion compositions formulated with inorganic sunscreens stabilized against color and viscosity degradation.<br>
Sunscreen compositions are commonly used during outdoor work or leisure.   They protect exposed  skin against sunburn,  cancer and even  photoaging.     In general  sunscreen 10     preparations are formulated as creams, lotions or oils containing as active agent an ultraviolet radiation absorbing or at least reflecting chemical compound.<br>
The ideal sunscreen formulation should be non-toxic, non-irritating to skin tissue and capable of convenient application in a uniform continuous film. The sunscreen active agent as well as the 15     composition into which it is formulated should be sufficiently chemically and physically stable. An acceptable shelf life is required for extended storage.<br>
Chromophoric organic sunscreen agents are generally the most effective. Unfortunately many of these organic actives cause adverse allergic reactions.  It is therefore desirable to minimize 20     the level of such materials.<br>
Inorganic ultrafine particulate compounds such as zinc oxide and titanium dioxide have been employed as sunscreen agents. Illustrations of this technology are found in US 5 215 749 and US 5 188 831, both to Nicoll et al. Inorganics are not known as sensitizers generating allergic 25 reactions. However the stability of such formulations is a noticeable problem. Adverse effects include viscosity builup and discoloration under extended storage conditions. These adverse consequences can be particulariy pronounced in emulsions which are of the oil continuous variety.<br>
30 Accordingly there remains a need to uncover inorganic sunscreen particulate containing formulations of increased storage stability, particularly compositions resistant to significant changes in viscosity and color.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
35     A cosmetic composition is provided which is a water-in-oil emulsion including:<br>
(i)       from about 0.1 to about 30% by weight of a water-in-oil emulsifying silicone surfactant; (ii)       from about 0.1 to about 30% by weight of a titanium dioxide sunscreen<br>
agent; and (iii)      from about 0.1 to about 10% of a conjugated iinoleic acid.<br><br>
WO 2007/073909<br><br>

PCT/EP2006/012248<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Now it has been found that a water-in-oil cosmetic composition containing conjugated linoieic acid can impart both viscosity and color stability to formulations containing sunscreen grade 5 titanium dioxide particulates. Ordinarily unsaturated compounds, of which CLA is an example, would themselves be expected to be unstable and color body producing. It was therefore surprising to note that CLA had the exact opposite effect in oil continuous emulsions that suspended titanium dioxide. Only small amounts of CLA were needed to achieve the stabilization results.<br>
10<br>
Conjugated Linoieic Acid<br>
Conjugated linoieic acid (hereinafter referred to also as CLA) comprises a group of positional and geometric isomers of linoieic acid in which various configurations of cis and trans double bonds at positions (6,8), (7,9), (8,10), (9,11), (10,12) or (11,13) are possible. Thus twenty-four<br>
15      different isomers of CLA exist<br>
The invention also includes derivatives of the free acid which thus comprise conjugated linoieic acid moieties. Preferable derivatives include those derived from substitution of the carboxyl group of the acid, such as esters (e.g. retinyl esters, triglyceride esters, monoglyceride esters, 20 diglyceride esters, phosphoesters), amides (e.g. ceramide derivatives), salts (e.g. alkali meta! and alkali earth metal salts, ammonium salts), and/or those derived from substitution of the C18 carbon chain, such as alpha hydroxy and/or beta hydroxy derivatives.<br>
In the case of triglyceride ester derivatives, all positional isomers of CLA substituents on the 25 glycerol backbone are included. The triglycerides must contain at least one CLA moiety. For example, of the three esterffiable positions on the glycerol backbone, the 1 and 2 positions may be esterified with CLA and by another lipid at position 3 or as an alternative, the glycerol backbone could be esterified by CLA at the 1 and 3 positions with another lipid at position 2.<br>
30 Wherever the term "conjugated linoieic acid  or "CLA" is used in this specification it is to be understood that the derivatives thereof comprising CLA moieties are also included.  CLA moieties" refers to CLA fatty acyl portion(s) of a CLA derivative.<br>
The isomers of greatest interest in the present cosmetic compositions are cis 9, trans 1 llinoleic 35     add and trans 10, cis12 linoieic acid. Hereinafter the term "9,11-linoIeic acid" or "10,12-linoleic acid" shall mean preferentially these two main isomers, but will include lesser amounts of the remaining isomers, particularly when obtained or derived from a natural source.<br><br>
WO 2007/073909<br><br>
PCT7EP2006/012248<br><br>
3 In accordance with the present invention, 9,11 linoleic acid and 10,12 finoleic acid are formulated into cosmetic preparations either as the free acid, as individual chemical derivatives, or as combinations of free acid and derivative.<br>
5 By "c9, t11 and t10, c12 isomer enriched CLA" is meant that at least 30% by weight of the total CLA (and/or CLA moieties) present in the composition is in the form of the cis 9, trans 11 and trans 10, cis 12 isomers. Preferably, at least 40%, most preferably at least 50%, by weight of the total CLA and/or CLA moieties present in the composition, is in the form of the aforementioned isomers. 10<br>
The amount of the CLA present in emulsions of this invention may range from about 0.1 to about 10% by weight of the composition. More preferably the amount is from about 0.5% to about 5%, and most preferably from about 1% to about 3%.<br>
15 Mixed isomers of CLA are prepared by high temperature alkali treatment of safflower oil, generating CLA with equal amounts of the c9, t11 and t10, d2 CLA Isomers. CLA enriched in the c9, t11 CLA is separated from the mix by selective esterification with lauryi alcohol using Geotrichum Candidum as a catalyst The enriched c9, t11 CLA is hydrolyzed and converted to the triglyceride. After the esterification step and separation the remaining CLA free acids are<br>
20      enriched in t10, c12 CLA.<br>
Commercially CLA is available as Clarinol® A-80 and A-95 from Loders-Croklaan, Channahon, Illinois and Neobee® CLA 80 and 90 from Stepan, North Field, Illinois.<br>

WO 2007/073909	PCT/EP2006/012248<br>
5<br>
Amounts of the titanium dioxide sunscreen agent may range from about 0.1 to about 30%, preferably from about 0.5 to about 15%, more preferably from about 1 to about 10% by weight of the composition.<br>
5     Dispersed Aqueous Phase<br>
The compositions of the presert  invention comprise from abou\ 5% \o about 90%, more preferably from about 30% to about 75%, and even more preferably from about 45% to about 60% of a dispersed aqueous phase. In emulsion technology, the term "dispersed phase" means that the phase exists as small particles or droplets suspended in and surrounded by a 10 continuous phase. The dispersed phase is also known as the internal or discontinuous phase. The dispersed aqueous phase is a dispersion of small aqueous particles or droplets suspended in and surrounded by the continuous silicone phase described hereinbefore.<br>
The aqueous phase can be water, or a combination of water and one or more water soluble or 15     dispersible ingredients. Non-limiting examples of such optional ingredients include thickeners, acids, bases, salts, chelants, gums, water-soluble or dispersible alcohols and polyols, buffers, preservatives and colorants.<br>
Optional Components 20     The composition of the present invention may contain a variety of other ingredients that are conventionally used in given product types provided that they do not unacceptably alter the benefits for the invention.<br>
A component of the present invention may be a crosslinked silicone (organopolysiloxane) 25 elastomer. No specific restriction exists as to the type of curable organopolysiloxane composition that can serve as starting material for the crosslinked silicone elastomer. Examples in this respect are addition reaction-curing organopolysiloxane compositions which cure under platinum metal catalysis by the addition reaction between SiH-containing diorganopolysiloxane and organopolysiloxane having silicon-bonded vinyl groups; 30 condensation-curing organopolysiloxane compositions which cure in the presence of an organotin compound by a dehydrogenation reaction between hydroxy! terminated diorganopolysiloxane and SiH-containing diorganopolysiloxane; condensation-curing organopolysiloxane compositions which cure in the presence of an organotin compound or a titanate ester, by a condensation reaction between a hydroxy! terminated diorganopolysiloxane 35 and a hydrolyzable organosilane (this condensation reaction is exemplified by dehydration, alcohol-liberating, oxime-liberating, amine-Iiberating, amide-liberating, carboxyHiberating and ketone-liberating reactions); peroxide-curing organopolysiloxane compositions which thermally cure in the presence of an organoperoxide catalyst, and organopolysiloxane compositions<br><br>
WO 2007/073909<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/012248<br><br>
6 which are cured by high-energy radiation, such as by gamma-rays, ultraviolet radiation, or electron beams.<br>
Addition reaction-curing organopolysiloxane compositions are preferred for their rapid curing 5     rates and excellent uniformity of curing.    A particularly preferred addition reaction-curing organopolysiloxane composition is prepared from:<br>
an organopolysiloxane having at least 2 lower alkenyl groups in each molecule; an organopolysiloxane having at least 2 silicon-bonded hydrogen atoms in each molecule; and a platinum-type catalyst<br>
10<br>
The crosslinked siloxane elastomer may either be an emulsifying or non-emulsifying crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer or combinations thereof. The term "non-emulsifying," as used herein, defines crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer from which polyoxyalkylene units are absent.  The term "emulsifying," as used herein, means crosslinked<br>
15 organopolysiloxane elastomer having at least one polyoxyalkylene (e.g. polyoxyethylene or pofyoxypropylene) unit.<br>
Particularly useful emulsifying elastomers   are polyoxyalkylene-modified elastomers formed from divinyl compounds, particularly siloxane polymers with at least two free vinyl groups, 20     reacting with Si-H linkages on a polysiloxane backbone.    Preferably the elastomers are dimethyl polysiloxanes crosslinked by Si-H sites on a moieculariy spherical MQ resin.<br>
Preferred silicone elastomers are organopolysiloxane compositions available under the INCI names of dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer, dimethicone crosspolymer and 25 Polysilicone-11. Ordinarily these materials are provided as a 1-30% crosslinked silicone elastomer dissolved or suspended in a dimethicone fluid (usually cydomethicone). For purposes of definition "crosslinked silicone elastomer" refers to the elastomer alone rather than the total commercial compositions which also include a solvent (eg. dimethicone) earner.<br>
30 Dimethicone/vinyl dimethicone crosspolymers and dimethicone crosspolymers are available from a variety of suppliers including Dow Coming (9040, 9041, 9045, 9506 and 9509), General Electric (SFE 839), Shin-Etsu (KSG-15, 16, 18 [dimethicone/phenyl vinyl dimethicone crosspolymer]), and Grant Industries (Gransil™ line of materials), and lauryl dimethiconeArinyl dimethicone crosspolymers supplied by Shin-Etsu (e.g. KSG-31, KSG-32, KSG-41, KSG-42,<br>
35     KSG-43 and KSG-44).<br>
Other suitable commercially available silicone elastomer powders include vinyl dimethicone/methicone silesquioxane crosspolymers from Shin-Etsu sold as KSP-100, KSP-101, KSP-102, KSP-103, KSP-104, KSP-105, and hybrid silicone powders that contain a<br><br>
WO 2007/073909	PCT/EP2006/012248<br>
7<br>
fluoroalkyl group or a phenyl group sold by Shin-Etsu as respectively KSP-200 and KSP-300. Also of use is Dow Coming 5-7070, a silicone amino elastomer emulsion with INCI name of silicone quatemium-16/glycidoxy dimethicone crosspolymer (and) trideceth-12.<br>
5 The crosslinked silicone elastomers may range in concentration from about 0.01 to about 30%, preferably from about 0.1 to about 10%, optimally from about 0.5 to about 2% by weight of the cosmetic composition. These weight values exclude any solvent such as cyclomethicone found in commercial "elastomer" silicones such as the Dow Coming products 9040 and 9045. For instance, the amount of crosslinked silicone elastomer in 9040 and 9045 is between 12 and 10     13% by weight<br>
Most preferred as the silicone elastomer is DC 9045 which has a D5 cyclomethicone swelled elastomer particle size (based on volume and calculated as spherical particles) which averages about 38 micron, and may range from about 25 to about 55 micron.<br>
15<br>
The compositions may include from about 1 % to about 80%, by weight of the composition, of a suitable earner for the crosslinked organopolysiloxane elastomer component described above. The carrier, when combined with the cross-linked organopolysiloxane elastomer particles serves to suspend and swell the elastomer particles to provide an elastic, gel-like network or<br>
20     matrix.  The carrier for the crosslinked siloxane elastomer is liquid under ambient conditions, and preferably has a low viscosity to provide for improved spreading on the skin.<br>
Concentrations of the earner may range from about 5% to about 60%, more preferably from about 5% to about 40%, by weight of the composition.<br>
25<br>
These liquid carriers may be organic, silicone-containing or fluorine-containing, volatile or non¬volatile, polar or non-polar, provided that the liquid carrier forms a solution or other homogeneous liquid or liquid dispersion with the selected cross-linked siloxane elastomer at the selected siloxane elastomer concentration at a temperature of from about 28°C to about 250°C,<br>
30     preferably from about 28°C to about 78°C.   The term "non-polar" typically means that the material has a solubility parameter below about 6.5 (calfan3)05.<br>
The non-polar, volatile oil tends to impart highly desirable aesthetic properties to the compositions of the present invention. Consequently, the non-polar, volatile oils are preferably 35 utilized at a fairly high level. Non-polar, volatile oils particularly useful in the present invention are silicone oils; hydrocarbons; and mixtures thereof. Examples of preferred non-polar, volatile hydrocarbons include polydecanes such as isododecane and isodecane (e.g., Permethyl-99A which is available from Presperse Inc.) and the c7-8 through C12.15 isoparaffins (such as the Isopar Series available from Exxon Chemicals). Particularty preferred volatile silicone oils are<br><br>
WO 2007/073909<br><br>
PCT/EP2006/012248<br><br>
8 cyclic volatile silicones wherein the repeating unit ranges from about 3 to about 5; and linear silicones wherein the repeating unit ranges from about 1 to about 7. Highly preferred examples of volatile silicone oils include cyclomethicones of varying viscosities, e.g. Dow Coming 200, Dow Coming 244, Dow Coming 245, Dow Coming 344 and Dow Coming 345, (commercially 5 available from Dow Coming Corp.); SF-1204 and SF-1202 Silicone Fluids, GE 7207 and 7158 (commercially available from G.E. Silicones) and SWS-03314 {commerciany available from SWS Silicones Corp).<br>
Compositions of the present invention may also contain C1-20 alpha- and beta- hydroxy 10 carboxylic acids and salts thereof. The salts are preferably alkaline metal, ammonium and O.12 alkanolammonium salts and mixtures thereof. The term "alpha-hydroxycarboxylic acids" includes not only hydroxy acids but also alpha- ketoacids and related compounds of polymeric forms of hydroxyacid.<br>
15 Alpha-hydroxyacids are organic carboxylic acids in which one hydroxy! group is attached to the alpha carbon adjacent the carboxy group. The generic structure is as follows:<br><br>
20 where Ra and Rb are H, F, CI, Br, alkyl, aralkyl or aryl group of saturated or unsaturated, isomeric or non-isomeric, straight or branched chain or cyclic form, having 1 to 25 carbon atoms, and in addition Ra and Rb may carry OH, CHO, COOH and alkoxy groups having 1 to 9 carbon atoms. The alpha-hydroxyacids may be present as a free acid or in lactone form, or in a salt form with an organic base or an inorganic alkali.  The alpha-hydroxyacids may exist as<br>
25     stereoisomers as D, L, and Dl_ forms when Ra and Rb are not identicaL<br>
Typical alkyl, aralkyl and aryl groups for Ra and Rb include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, pentyl, octyl, lauryl, stearyl, benzyl and phenyl.    Most preferred among the alpha-hydroxyacids are glycolic acid, iactic acid, alpha-hydroxycaprylic acid, gluconolactone and 30      combinations thereof.<br>
Among the beta-hydroxycarboxylic acids, the most prominent and useful is salicylic acid.<br>
Amounts of the hydroxy carboxylic acids may range from about 0.01 to about 15%, preferably 35     from about 0.1 to about 12%, more preferably from about 1 to about 8%, optimally from about 2 to about 8% by weight of the total cosmetic composition.<br>
Humectant may be incorporated into compositions of the present invention.   Humectants are normally polyols.  Representative polyols include glycerin, diglycerin, polyalkylene glycols and<br><br>

9<br>
more preferably alkylene polyols and their derivatives including propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol, polypropylene glycol, polyethylene glycol and derivatives thereof, sorbitol, hydroxypropyl sorbitol, hexytene glycol, 1,2-butylene glycol, 1,2,6-hexanetriol, isoprene glycol, 2-methyl-1,3-propanediol, ethoxylated glycerol, propoxylated glycerol and mixtures thereof. Amounts of the 5 humectant may range from about 0.01 to about 30%, preferably from about 0.1 to about 15%, optimally from about 2 to 10% by weight of the composition.<br>

Color Comparison Test<br>
5 Color was evaluated by the Hunter Lab method. Intrinsic optical properties of the formulas were tested using a Hunter Lab LabScan XE (Hunter Associates Laboratory, inc. Reston, Virginia) using a standard sample cup port plate. The equipment settings used were:<br>
Spectral Performance:	Wavelength Range: 400 -700nm<br>
10	Wavelength Internal: 10nm<br>
Bandpass: 10nm equivalent triangular Photometric Range: 0 -150%<br>
The LabScan XE 0/45 spectrophotometer in the port-up orientation is then configured for a 15     1.75-inch area of view with UV filter set to nominal.   Once the instrument is standardized following the procedure specified in the instrument manual and commercially supplied computer software, the sample is prepared for color (a*, b*. and L*) measurement.<br><br>
WO 2007/073909	PCT/EP2006/012248<br>
16<br>
The black plastic ring is placed within the sample cup that is then filled with product to a level above the ring. The ceramic disk is then placed on top of the sample with the white portion facing the sample until it rests firmly on top of the plastic ring. This disk provides a white background to direct light that has traveled through the sample back to the detector. The goal 5 is to have the sample appear smooth and opaque through the bottom of the sample cup. Next, the sample is placed on the sample cup port plate and covered with the opaque cover. This cover provides a light trap to exclude interference of external light on the sample measurements. The average of three readings is used for a single color measurement representing the color of the batch. Tiie color lab is presented by the Hunter lab color space a*,<br>
10 b*, and L*. Term a* is green-red space, term b* is blue-yellow space, and term L* is black-white space. For example, a large L* value means more white, and smaller b* value means more blue. The overall color difference from the standard sample is then determined by the value of dE*. dE* can be obtained by configuring the instrument to display it when specifying your settings or it can be calculated as follows:<br>
15<br>
20 <br>
The greater the value of dE, the greater the degree of color change from the control. Conversely, low values of dE indicate that the overall color of the sample is closer to that of the control.<br>
