FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of (±)-trans-4-aryl-3-hyroxymethyl-l-methylpiperidines. The (±)-trans-4-aryl-3-hyroxy methyl-1-methylpiperidines prepared by the process of the present invention have the general formula-I, wherein X = H, F, Me, OMe.<br><br>
The compound of the formula-I wherein b represents fluorine is a key intermediate used in the synthesis of (-)-trans-4-p-fluorophenyl-3-(35,45-methylenedioxyphenoxymethyl)-piperidine, a compound also known as paroxetine of the formula-II. Paroxetine, commercially available in the market as an anti-depressant inhibits 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) re-uptake.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
For the first time compounds of the formula-I where X has the meanings given above were disclosed in the US patent no 3,912,743. Subsequently the compound of formula-I where b represents fluorine was also disclosed in the US patent no 4,007,196. Process disclosed in these patents is based on a Grignard reaction in which arecoline (methyl N-methyl-12,5,6-tetraydropiperidine-3-carboxylate) and 4-fluorophenylmagnesium bromide are reacted together to get methyl N-methyl-4-fluorophenylpiperidine-3-carboxylate,<br><br>
which was reduced using lithium aluminum hydride to get the required compound of formula-lb. The main disadvantage in this process is arecoline is very irritant and harmful to the persons involved in the usage. Also, arecoline is not readily commercially available and is very expensive. Moreover, the Grignard reagent used namely 4-fluorophenylmagnesium bromide, in the process is not selective towards 1,4-addition and a 1,2-addition product can also form as a major impurity. Separation of these mixtures may thus involve complex purification. Therefore, the process may not be suitable for commercialization.<br>
In the US patent no 4,902,801 a process for the preparation of compound of the formula-I where X has the meanings given earlier is described. This process involves the reduction of the intermediate of the formula-Ill by lithium aluminum hydride (Scheme-I). Lithium aluminum hydride is very expensive and a hazardous chemical. Also, another drawback<br><br>
in this process is that the N-methylamidomalonic acid esters required in the process are not commercially available. Preparation of these esters is a low yielding process due to formation of by-product N-methylmalonamide, which will also participate in preparation of compound of formula-Ill. All of this leads to high manufacturing costs of the process.<br>
The intermediate compound of the formula-Ill was also made (according to the patent no EP 374,675) by addition of malonic acid esters to 4-substituted-N-methaylcinnamamide<br><br>
(Scheme-II). According to this variant free methylamine has to be used in making the cinnamamide and also there are no major advantages over the above-mentioned process.<br><br>
Compound of the formula-I where b represents fluorine was also prepared (Scheme-Ill) by reducing trans-4-p-fluorophenyl-6-oxopiperidine-3-carboxilic acid esters of the formula-V, wherein R is alkyl and subsequent N-methylation or by N-methylation of compound of the formula-V and subsequent reduction (as disclosed in EP 802,185, ES 96 00,369, EP 812827, and WO 98 53,824).<br><br>
For the reduction of nitrile group present in compound of the formula-V by hydrogenation, elevated hydrogen pressure is needed (as disclosed in EP 812,827), which also involves use of platinum oxide. This makes the process disadvantageous as the risk<br><br>
of defluorination is possible during hydrogenation. Also, the use of platinum oxide increases the cost of production. The reductive cyclization step involves the generation of cis/trans mixture. The undesired cis-compound needs to be isomerized by doing an additional step. All these operations make the above-mentioned processes economically not viable for commercial production of compound of formula-I b where b represents fluorine.<br>
Compound of the formula-I b where b represents fluorine was also prepared (Scheme-IV) by the reduction and N-methylation of a compound of the formula-VIII (as disclosed in WO 00 26,187). Compound of formula-VIII is prepared by Michael addition of malonate esters to cinnamonitrile, followed by reductive cyclization. This process is similar to the process known for the preparation of compound of formula-VI, which involves costly reagents like platinum on carbon, high pressure ammonia reaction, etc. Also the conversion of compound of formula-VIII to compound of formula-I involves lithium aluminum hydride reduction, which is very expensive and hazardous as mentioned above. Therefore the process is not economically viable for commercial production of compound of formula-I or paroxetine of formula-II.<br><br>
This process involves the conversion of the compound of the formula-V making it industrially not viable for preparation of compound of formula-I b where b represents fluorine or paroxetine of the formula-II.<br><br>
In the recent patent WO 02 053537 a novel process for the preparation of compound of formula-I b where b represents fluorine is disclosed via a Mannich reaction and a Knoevenagel condensation to build the tetrahydropyridine ring (Scheme-V),<br><br>
The main disadvantage of this process is that it involves the usage of alkyl 3-halo-3-oxopropionate to make the intermediate compound of the formula-XL This particular reagent is not easily accessible on a commercial scale. Also, the process uses lithium aluminum hydride in the last step of the synthesis. Handling of lithium aluminum hydride on commercial scale is not safe and also leads to high manufacturing costs.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
Keeping in view of the difficulties in commercialization of the above-mentioned processes for the preparation of compound of formula-I b where b represents fluorine, and recognizing the importance of this compound as an important intermediate in the synthesis of paroxetine, we aimed to develop a simple and economical and general process for the preparation of compounds of the formula-I where X has the meanings given above.<br><br>
We observed that a promising approach for development of such a process is to (a) avoid the usage of costly reagents like, lithium aluminum hydride (b) avoid the usage of difficult to handle intermediates/reagents (c) use readily and easily available raw materials (d) avoid the formation of cis-isomer in the process itself. Such an approach would meet the requirements of the costs, safety, and ecology of the production of compounds of the formula-I where X has the meaning given above, particularly pharmaceutical^ active substance like, paroxetine of the formula-II<br>
The process of the present invention for preparing the compounds of formula-I where X have the meanings given earlier is illustrated in the following Scheme-VI:<br><br><br>
The compound of the formula-XIII shall be prepared by two routes as shown in Scheme-VII.<br><br>
In route A, Mannich salt of the formula-XVIII is reduced to the corresponding known hydroxy compound of the formula-XIV by literature procedures. N-Demethylation of the compound of the formula XVI can be done by converting it into a urethane derivative and hydrolysis of the urethane derivative to get the required compound of the formula-XIII.<br>
In route B, Mannich salt derived from N-benzylmethylamine is reduced to the corresponding hydroxy compound. Finally, N-debenzylation can be done under mild<br><br>
heterogeneous hydrogenation condition to get the required compound of the formula-XIII.<br>
The secondary amine of the formula-XIII can be reacted with acrylic acid esters to give the corresponding N-alkylated derivative of the formula-XIV. The hydroxy group present in compound of the formula-XIV can be converted as a leaving group X5 (X5 = methanesulfonyl-, toluenesulfonyl-, benzenesulfonyl, or a halogen group) to get a compound of the formula-XV.<br>
The compound of the formula-XVI can be prepared by generation of an anion a to the ester carbon present in compound of the formula-XV and cyclizing through displacement of the leaving group X. The ester group present in compound of the formula-XVI can be reduced with a simple reagent like sodium borohydride to get the desired compound of the formula-I where X has the meanings given earlier.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the compound of the formula-XVII (X = Me, OMe) is condensed with paraformaldehyde or aqueous formaldehyde and methylbenzylamine through Mannich reaction to get the novel compound of formula-XXI (X = Me, OMe). The reaction can be carried out in a polar alcoholic or aqueous solvent. The secondary amine can be employed in the form of its inorganic or organic salt or as a free base. The suitable inorganic or organic are hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, propionic acid, oxalic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, adipic acid, etc. When the amine is used in free base form at least one equivalent of organic or inorganic acid is used along with the solvent.<br>
In the second step, the known dimethylamine derived Mannich salt (compound of the formula-XVIII) is converted to the known hydroxy compound of formula-XIX by known processes. The hydroxy compound thus obtained can be de-methylated using methyl or ethyl chloroformate to get the corresponding urethane derivative of the formula-XX. The<br><br>
urethane derivative can be hydrolyzed using alkali to get the secondary amine of the formula-XIII.<br>
The Mannich salt obtained from N-benzylmethylamine (compound of the formula-XXI), can be neutralized and reduced in situ with sodium borohydride to get the hydroxy compound of the formula-XXIL The reduction can be done in alcoholic solvent. This can be converted to the secondary amine of formula-XIII by direct hydrogenation in the presence of a metal catalyst under mild hydrogenation. The hydrogenation can be done in an alcoholic solvent like methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, etc.<br>
The secondary amine derivative of the formula-XIII is reacted with an alkyl ester of acrylic acid to get the corresponding tertiary amine derivative of the formula-XIV. The reaction can be done in an aromatic solvent (benzene, toluene, xylene, etc.), in a hydrocarbon solvent (hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, etc.), or in an ether solvent (dimethyl ether, diisopropyl ether, methyl isobutyl ether, methyl tert-butyl ether, etc.).<br>
The hydroxy group present in compound of the formula-XIV can be converted to its mesylate or tosylate. Alternatively, it can be reacted with thionyl chloride or excess mineral acid (HBr or HC1) to get the corresponding halide as the hydrogen halide salt. The sulfonate derivatives or the halide salts of compound of the formula-XV can be reacted with a strong base (NaH, n-butyl lithium, lithium diisopropyl amide, etc.) in a dipolar aprotic solvent to get the cyclic derivative of the formula-XV. In case of halide-hydrogen halide salts at least two equivalents of base is used to carryout the cyclization step.<br>
The cyclized compound of the formula-XV can be reduced using sodium borohydride under various conditions (sodium borohydride/borontrifluoride-etherate, sodium borohydride/t-butanol/methanol, reflux; t-butanol/acetic acid, etc.), vitride, sodium/ethanol, lithium tris-(t-butoxy)aluminum hydride, lithium aluminum hydride, etc., to get the required compound of the formula-I where X has the meanings given earlier.<br><br>
The medium of the reaction can be an alcoholic solvent (for sodium borohydride), aromatic solvent for vitride, and an ether solvent for lithium reagents.<br>
