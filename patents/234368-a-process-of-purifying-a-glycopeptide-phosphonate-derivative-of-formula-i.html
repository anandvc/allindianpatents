PROCESS FOR PURIFYING GLYCOPEPTIDE PHOSPHONATE<br>
DERIVATIVES<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Application No. 60/314,712, filed on August 24,2001; the entire disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is directed to purification of novel phosphonate derivatives of glycopeptide antibiotics and related compounds. In particular, this invention is directed to purification of glycopeptide phosphonate derivatives by resin chromatography methods.<br>
Background<br>
Glycopeptides (e.g. dalbaheptides) are a well-known class of antibiotics produced by various microorganisms {see Glycopeptide Antibiotics, edited by R. Nagarajan, Marcel Dekker, Inc. New York (1994)). These complex multi-ring peptide compounds are very effective antibacterial agents against a majority of Gram-positive bacteria. Although potent antibacterial agents, the glycopeptides antibiotics are not used in the treatment of bacterial diseases as often as other classes of antibiotics, such as the semi-synthetic penicillins, cephalosporins and lincomycins, due to concerns regarding toxicity.<br>
In recent years, however, bacterial resistance to many of the commonly-used antibiotics has developed (see J. E. Geraci et aL, Mayo Clin. Proc. 1983, 55, 88-91; and M. Foldes, J. Antimicrob. Chemother. 1983,11,21-26). Since glycopeptide antibiotics are often effective against these resistant strains of bacteria, glycopeptides such as vancomycin have become the drugs of last resort for treating infections<br><br>
caused by these organisms. Recently, however, resistance to vancomycin has appeared in various microorganisms, such as vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), leading to increasing concerns about the ability to effectively treat bacterial infections in the future (see Hospital Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee, Infection Control Hospital Epidemiology, 1995,17, 364-369; A. P. Johnson et al., Clinical Microbiology Rev., 1990, 3,280-291; G. M. Eliopoulos, European! Clinical Microbiol., Infection Disease, 1993, 12, 409-412; and P. Courvalin, Antimicrob. Agents Chemother, 1990, 34,2291-2296).<br>
A number of derivatives of vancomycin and other glycopeptides are known in the art. For example, see U.S. Patent Nos. 4,639,433; 4,643,987; 4,497,802; 4,698,327; 5,591,714; 5,840,684; and 5,843,889. Other derivatives are disclosed in EP 0 802 199; EP 0 801 075; EP 0 667 353; WO 97/28812; WO 97/38702; WO 98/52589; WO 98/52592; and in J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 1996,118, 13107-13108; J. Amer. Chem. Soc, 1997,119, 12041-12047; and J! Amer. Chem. Soc, 1994,116, 4573-4590.<br>
The preparation of glycopeptide antibiotics generally includes a purification step. Methods suitable for purifying gylcopeptides, particularly vancomycin and related compounds, are described, for example in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,440,753, 4,845,194,4,874,843, 5,149,784, 5,258,495, and 5,853,720. Other methods are disclosed in WO 91/08300 and WO 93/21207.<br>
Despite the above referenced disclosures, a need currently exists for novel glycopeptide derivatives having effective antibacterial activity and an improved mammalian safety profile. In particular, a need exists for glycopeptide derivatives which are effective against a wide spectrum of pathogenic microorganisms, including vancomycin-resistant microorganisms, and which have reduced tissue accumulation and/or nephrotoxicity. Further, in order for these novel derivatives to be useful, there is a need for effective methods of purifying said compounds which recover the product in a highly pure form suitable for pharmaceutical product synthesis.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>

A method for preparing a glycopeptide which is substituted at the C-terminus with a substituent that comprises one or more phosphono groups, comprises coupling<br><br>
a corresponding starting glycopeptide wherein the C-terminus is a carboxy group with a suitable phosphono containing compound.<br>
A method for preparing a glycopeptide which is substituted at the R-terminus with a substituent that comprises one or more phosphono groups, comprises coupling a corresponding starting glycopeptide wherein the R-terminus is unsubstituted with a suitable phosphono containing compound. When the starting glycopeptide is substituted at the vancosamine amino terminus, such a method can further optionally comprise preparing the starting glycopeptide by reductively alkylating a corresponding glycopeptide wherein the vancosamine amino terminus is the corresponding amine.<br>
A method for preparing a glycopeptide that is substituted at the C-terminus, comprises derivatizing a corresponding starting glycopeptide wherein the C-terminus is a carboxy group. A method for preparing a glycopeptide which is substituted at the R-terminus, comprising derivatizing a corresponding starting glycopeptide wherein the R-terminus is unsubstituted (i.e. a hydrogen)<br>
In addition, a method for preparing a compound of formula I, wherein R is -OH, R5 is -CH2-NH-Ra-P(0)(OH)2, R19 is hydrogen and R20 is -Ra-Y-Rb-(Z)X or -Rf, and Ra, Rb, Rf, Y, Z and x are as defined herein, or salt thereof comprises the following steps:<br>
(a)	reductively alkylating a compound of formula I, wherein R is -OH and R5, R19 and R20 are hydrogen, or a salt thereof, with an aldehyde of the formula HC(0)-Ra'-Y-Rb-(Z)x or HC(0)Rf wherein Ra&gt; and Rf represent Ra and Rf, respectively, minus one -CH2- group, to form a compound of formula I wherein R is -OH, R5 and R19 are hydrogen and R20 is -Ra-Y-Rb-(Z)X or -Rf, or salt thereof; and<br>
(b)	reacting the product from step (a) with formaldehyde and H2N-Ra-P(0)(OH)2 to form a compound of formula I wherein R3 is -OH, R5 is -CH2NH-Ra-P(0)(OH)2, R19 is hydrogen and R20 is -Ra-Y-Rb-(Z)X or -Rf, or salt thereof<br>
Preferred glycopeptide compounds of formula I are shown in Table I below wherein R19 is hydrogen.<br><br><br><br><br>
The phosphono compounds described herein have been found to unexpectedly exhibit reduced tissue accumulation and/or nephrotoxicity when administered to a mammal While not wishing to be bound by theory, it is believed that the phosphono moiety serves to increase the overall negative charge of the glycopeptide under physiological conditions thereby facilitating excretion from the mammal after administration. The unexpected increase in excretion of the present phosphono compounds may be responsible for the reduced tissue accumulation and/or reduced<br><br>
nephrotoxicity observed for these compounds relative to the corresponding compounds that lack the phosphono functionality.<br>
According to embodiments of the present invention, phosphono derivatives of glycopeptides are purified by resin chromatography using resins based on copolymers of polystyrene and divinyl benzene. A wide variety of useful polystyrene resins are provided commercially, for example by TosoHaas (Montgomery, PA), Rohm &amp; Haas (Philadelphia, PA), Mitsubishi Chemical Industries Ltd. (Tokyo, Japan); and Dow Chemical Co. (Midland, MI).<br>
The resins are typically composed of porous beads with a characteristic size in the range of between about 20 \xm and about 800 |nm having pores with diameters in the range of between about 50 A and about 1000 A.<br>
The purification method of the present invention comprises:<br>
contacting a first acidified aqueous solution comprising a glycopeptide phosphonate derivative and a polar organic solvent, with a polystyrene divinyl benzene resin;<br>
eluting the contacted resin with a second acidified aqueous solution comprising a polar organic solvent to form an eluate; and<br>
isolating the purified glycopeptide phosphonate derivative from the eluate.<br>
As used here, the term "polar organic solvent" includes methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, acetonitrile, acetone, n-propyl alcohol, n-butyl alcohol, isobutyl alcohol, methyl ethyl ketone, tetrahydrofuran, and like solvents, which have appreciable water solubility, or are miscible with water. Preferred polar organic solvents are methanol, ethanol, isopropyl alcohol, and acetonitrile.<br>
Suitable acids for the acidification of the first and second aqueous solutions include acetic acid, trifluoroacetic acid, hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid and like acids. For the present invention, acetic acid and hydrochloric acid are preferred.<br>
The purified product is isolated by methods known in the art, such as lyophilization, or precipitation followed by evaporation and/or filtration. Optionally, the isolation process includes a first concentration step in which the eluate is processed using a resin, preferably a polystyrene divinyl benzene resin, to form a<br><br>
solution with a higher concentration of purified product, from which the product is isolated.<br>
In one purification method, the resin is loaded onto a column and the eluate collected in fractions, which are monitored by thin layer chromatography (TLC) and high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) for the presence of the glycopeptide. Fractions containing a product concentration and purity higher than a desired threshold are pooled prior to isolating the product. Using the present method, phosphono glycopeptide samples with purity in excess of 80% have been obtained.<br>

General Synthetic Procedures<br>
The glycopeptide compounds can be prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred process conditions (i.e., reaction temperatures, times, mole ratios of reactants, solvents, pressures, etc.) are given, other process conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvent used, but such conditions can be determined by one skilled in the art by routine optimization procedures.<br>
Additionally, as will be apparent to those skilled in the art, conventional protecting groups may be necessary to prevent certain functional groups from undergoing undesired reactions. The choice of a suitable protecting group for a particular functional group as well as suitable conditions for protection and deprotection are well known in the art. For example, numerous protecting groups,<br><br>
and their introduction and removal, are described in T. W. Greene and G. M. Wuts, Protecting Groups in Organic Synthesis, Third Edition, Wiley, New York, 1999, and references cited therein.<br>
In the following reaction schemes, the glycopeptide compounds are depicted in a simplified form as a box "G" that shows the carboxy terminus labeled [C], the vancosamine amino terminus labeled [V], the "non-saccharide" amino terminus (leucine amine moiety) labeled [N], and optionally, the resorcinol moiety labeled [R] as follows:<br><br>
A glycopeptide compound which is substituted at the C-terminus with a substituent that comprises one or more (e.g. 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5) phosphono (-PO3H2) groups, can be prepared by coupling a corresponding glycopeptide compound wherein the C-terminus is a carboxy group with a suitable phosphono containing compound. For example, a glycopeptide compound wherein the C-terminus is a carboxy group can be coupled with a phosphono containing amine, alcohol, or thiol compound to form an amide, an ester, or a thioester, respectively.   For example a glycopeptide compound of formula I wherein R3 is a nitrogen linked moiety comprising one or more phosphono groups can be prepared by coupling a corresponding glycopeptide compound of formula I wherein R is hydroxy with the requisite phosphono-containing amine to form the formula I wherein R3 is a nitrogen linked moiety comprising one or more phosphono groups.<br>
A glycopeptide compound which is substituted at the C-terminus with a substituent that comprises one or more (e.g. 1,2, 3,4, or 5) phosphono (-PO3H2) groups, and wherein the vancosamine amino terminus (V) is substituted, can be prepared by first reductively alkylating the corresponding glycopeptide compound wherein the vancosamine amino terminus (V) is the free amine (NH2) and then<br><br>
coupling the corresponding glycopeptide compound with the requisite phosphono containing compound (e.g. phosphono containing amine, alcohol, or thiol).<br>
By way of illustration, a glycopeptide compound, such as vancomycin, can first be reductive alkylated as shown in the following reaction:<br><br>
where A represents Ra minus one carbon atom and Ra, Rb, Y, Z and x are as defined herein. This reaction is typically conducted by first contacting one equivalent of the glycopeptide, i.e., vancomycin, with an excess, preferably from 1.1 to 1.3 equivalents, of the desired aldehyde in the presence of an excess, preferably about 2.0 equivalents, of a tertiary amine, such as diisopropylethylamine (DIPEA) and the like. This reaction is typically conducted in an inert diluent, such as DMF or acetonitrile/water, at ambient temperature for about 0.25 to 2 hours until formation of the corresponding imine and/or hemiaminal is substantially complete. The resulting imine and/or hemiaminal is typically not isolated, but is reacted in situ with a reducing agent, such as sodium cyanoborohydride, pyridine borane, or the like, to afford the corresponding amine. This reaction is preferably conducted by contacting the imine and/or hemiaminal with an excess, preferably about 3 equivalents, of trifluoroacetic acid, followed by about 1 to 1.2 equivalents of the reducing agent at ambient temperature in methanol or acetonitrile/water. The resulting alkylated product is readily purified by conventional procedures, such as precipitation and/or reverse-phase HPLC. Surprisingly, by forming the imine and/or hemiaminal in the presence of a trialkyl amine, and then acidifying with trifluoroacetic acid before contact with the reducing agent, the selectivity for the reductive alkylating reaction is greatly improved, i.e., reductive alkylating at the amino group of the saccharide (e.g., vancosamine) is favored over reductive alkylating at the N-terminus (e.g., the leucinyl group) by at least 10:1, more preferably 20:1.<br><br>
The above process is a significantly improvement over previous methods for selectively alkylating an amino saccharide group of a glycopeptide antibiotic.  A method for alkylating a glycopeptide that comprises a saccharide-amine comprises:<br>
combining an aldehyde or ketone, a suitable base, and the glycopeptide, to provide a reaction mixture;<br>
acidifying the reaction mixture; and<br>
combining the reaction mixture with a suitable reducing agent, to provide a glycopeptide that is alkylated at the saccharide-amine. Preferably, the glycopeptide comprises at least one amino group other than the saccharide-amine.<br>
Preferably, the reductive alkylating at the saccharide-amine is favored over reductive alkylating at another amino group of the glycopeptide by at least about 10:1; and more preferably, by at least about 15:1 or about 20:1.<br>
The reductive alkylating process is typically carried out in the presence of a suitable solvent or combination of solvents, such as, for example, a halogenated hydrocarbon (e.g. methylene chloride), a linear or branched ether (e.g. diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran), an aromatic hydrocarbon (e.g. benzene or toluene), an alcohol (methanol, ethanol, or isopropanol), dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO), N,N-dimethylformamide, acetonitrile, water, l,3-dimethyl-3,4,5,6-tetrahydro-2(lH)-pyrimidone, tetramethyl urea, N,N-dimethylacetamide, diethylformamide (DMF), 1-methyl-2-pyrrolidinone, tetramethylenesulfoxide, glycerol, ethyl acetate, isopropyl acetate, N,N-dimethylpropylene urea (DMPU) or dioxane. Preferably the alkylating is carried out in acetonitrile/water, or DMF/methanol.<br>
Preferably the reduction (i.e. treatment with the reducing agent) is carried out in the presence of a protic solvent, such as, for example, an alcohol (e.g. methanol, ethanol, propanol, isopropanol, or butanol), water, or the like.<br>
The reductive alkylating process of the invention can be carried out at any suitable temperature from the freezing point to the reflux temperature of the reaction mixture. Preferably the reaction is carried out at a temperature in the range of about 0 °C to about 100 °C. More preferably at a temperature in a range of about 0 °C to about 50 °C, or in a range of about 20 °C to about 30 °C.<br><br>
Any suitable base can be employed in the reductive alkylating process of the invention. Suitable bases include tertiary amines (e.g. diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine or triethylamine) and the like.<br>
Any suitable acid can be used to acidify the reaction mixture. Suitable acids include carboxylic acids (e.g. acetic acid, trichloroacetic acid, citric acid, formic acid, or trifluoroacetic acid), mineral acids (e.g. hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, or phosphoric acid), and the like. A preferred acid is trifluoroacetic acid.<br>
Suitable reducing agents for carrying out reductive alkylating process of the invention are known in the art. Any suitable reducing agent can be employed in the methods of the invention, provided it is compatible with the functionality present in the glycopeptide. For example, suitable reducing agents include sodium cyanoborohydride, sodium triacetoxyborohydride, pyridine/borane, sodium borohydride, and zinc borohydride. The reduction can also be carried out in the presence of a transition metal catalyst (e.g. palladium or platinum) in the presence of a hydrogen source (e.g. hydrogen gas or cyclohexadiene). See for example,, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Fourth Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1992), 899-900.<br>
The glycopeptide derivative resulting from the reductive alkylating is then coupled with a phosphono containing amine (R -H) to form an amide bond. This reaction is illustrated by the following reaction:<br><br>
where R3 is a nitrogen-linked group that comprises one or more phosphono groups. In this reaction, the glycopeptide derivative is typically contacted with the amine in the presence of a peptide coupling reagent, such as PyBOP and HOBT, to provide the amide. This reaction is typically conducted in an inert diluent, such as DMF, at a temperature ranging from about 0°C to about 60°C for about 1 to 24 hours or until the coupling reaction is substantially complete. Subsequent deprotection using conventional procedures and reagents affords the compound of this invention.<br><br>
If desired, the amine coupling step described above can be conducted first to provide an amide, followed by reductive alkylating and deprotection to afford the compound of the invention.<br>
If desired, the glycopeptide compounds can also be prepared in a step-wise manner in which a precursor to the -Ra-Y-Rb-(Z)X group is first attached the glycopeptide by reductive alkylating, followed by subsequent elaboration of the attached precursor using conventional reagent and procedures to form the -Ra-Y-Rb-(Z)x group. Additionally, ketones may also be employed in the above-described reductive alkylating reactions to afford a-substituted amines.<br>
Any glycopeptide having an amino group may be employed in these reductive alkylating reactions. Such glycopeptides are well-known in the art and are either commercially available or may be isolated using conventional procedures. Suitable glycopeptides are disclosed, by way of example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,067,099; 3,338,786; 3,803,306; 3,928,571; 3,952,095; 4,029,769; 4,051,237; 4,064,233; 4,122,168; 4,239,751; 4,303,646; 4,322,343; 4,378,348; 4,497,802; 4,504,467; 4,542,018; 4,547,488; 4,548,925; 4,548,974; 4,552,701; 4,558,008; 4,639,433; 4,643,987; 4,661,470; 4,694,069; 4,698,327; 4,782,042; 4,914,187; 4,935,238; 4,946,941; 4,994,555; 4,996,148; 5,187,082; 5,192,742; 5,312,738; 5,451,570; 5,591,714; 5,721,208; 5,750,509; 5,840,684; and 5,843,889. Preferably, the glycopeptide employed in the above reaction is vancomycin.<br>
As illustrated in the following scheme, a phosphono containing aminoalkyl sidechain at the resorcinol moiety of a glycopeptide, such as vancomycin, can be introduced via a Mannich reaction (in this scheme, the resorcinol moiety of the glycopeptide is illustrated for clarity). In this reaction, an amine of formula NHRR' (wherein one or both of R and R' is a group that comprises one or more phosphono groups), and an aldehyde (e.g. CH2O), such as formalin (a source of formaldehyde), are reacted with the glycopeptide under basic conditions to give the glycopeptide derivative.<br><br><br>
Compounds of the invention comprising a sulfoxide or sulfone can be prepared from the corresponding thio compounds using conventional reagents and procedures. Suitable reagents for oxidizing a thio compound to a sulfoxide include, by way of example, hydrogen peroxide, peracides such as 3-chloroperoxybenzoic acid (MCPBA), sodium periodate, sodium chlorite, sodium hypochlorite, calcium hypochlorite, tert-butyl hypochlorite and the like. Chiral oxidizing reagents, (optically active reagents) may also be employed to provide chiral sulfoxides. Such optically active reagents are well-known in the art and include, for example, the reagents described in Kagen et al., Synlett., 1990, 643-650.<br>
The aldehydes and ketones employed in the above reactive alkylating reactions are also well-known in the art and are either commercially available or can be prepared by conventional procedures using commercially available starting materials and conventional reagents (for example see March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Fourth Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York (1992), and references cited therein).<br>
The phosphono substituted compounds (e.g. the phosphono substituted amines, alcohols, or thiols) are either commercially available or can be prepared by conventional procedures using commercially available starting materials and reagents. See for example, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Jerry March, 4th ed, 1992, John Wiley and Sons, New York, page 959; and Frank R. Hartley (ed.) The Chemistry of Organophosphorous Compounds, vol. 1-4, John Wiley and Sons, New York (1996). Aminomethylphosphonic acid is commercially available from Aldrich Chemical Company, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.<br><br>
Additional details and other methods for preparing the compounds of this invention are described in the Examples below.<br>
Purification Methods<br>
The present invention provides methods of purifying the phosphono derivatives of glycopeptides described above by resin chromatography using resins based on copolymers of polystyrene and divinyl benzene. Numerous examples of such resins, which are characterized by porous beads with a pore size of from about 30 A to about 1000 A, are provided commercially. For the present invention, a preferred pore size of the resin is from about 50 A to about 1000 A. An exemplary list of resins useful in methods of the present invention is given in Table II below, including manufacturer, pore diameter, and bead size.<br><br><br>
In an exemplary purification method, a polystyrene resin, such as a resin listed in Table II, is prepared by wetting in excess water and washing with water, optionally acidified, and/or with an aqueous solution of a polar organic solvent, optionally acidified, and loaded onto a chromatographic column. The sample of glycopeptide to be purified is dissolved in acidified water containing a polar organic solvent. The pH of the sample solution is preferably between about 2 and 5. A small portion of the sample solution is removed and used as a standard for HPLC analysis.<br>
The sample solution is loaded onto the column and eluted with a second acidified aqueous solution of a polar organic solvent, which is collected from the column in fractions. Preferably, the second acidified aqueous solution is at a concentration of about lOmM acid and is proportionally in a ratio of from about 1:4 to about 1:15 polar organic solvent:water.<br>
Each fraction is monitored for presence of sample by thin layer chromatography. When no further sample is observed in the eluate, an elutant solution that is higher in organic content is used to wash the remaining sample from the column. The column is regenerated by washing with acidified polar organic solvent and with acidified water.<br>
Fractions containing sample are analyzed by HPLC for sample concentration and purity. The fractions containing a sample concentration that is higher than a desired threshold are pooled and the purified product is isolated from the eluate. As described in the examples, the purified product can be recovered from the eluate by lyophilizing the pooled fractions.<br>
Alternatively, the purified product can be isolated from the eluate by precipitation and filtration. For example, an excess of a polar organic solvent, such as acetonitrile, can be added to the eluate producing a solid precipitate of the purified product, which is then filtered.<br>
Optionally, a solution that is more concentrated in the purified product than the eluate can be formed from the eluate in a first step of the isolation process. The product is then isolated from the more concentrated solution. For example, a more concentrated solution can be formed by adding NaCl to the combined eluate fractions, loading the resulting solution onto a chromatographic column containing a polystyrene divinyl benzene resin, such as the resins described above, and eluting<br><br>
with a solution containing a higher concentration of polar organic solvent than the concentration of the organic solvent in the prior chromatographic step. Alternatively, a more concentrated solution can be formed in a batch process using a polystyrene divinyl benzene resin by adding the resin to the eluate at low temperatures such that the product is absorbed onto the resin; filtering the resin, and desorbing the glycopeptide from the resin with a room temperature aqueous polar organic solution.<br>
As described in Example 4 below, using the present method, samples with an initial concentration of phosphonated glycopeptide that is between 67 and 74 % have been purified to a concentration that is between about 83 and 94 %.<br>
While the purification method has been described using column chromatography, as known in the art the sample solution may be contacted with the resin in alternative arrangements, such as using a batch processing vessel.<br>

General Procedure A Reductive Alkylating of Vancomycin<br>
To a mixture of vancomycin (1 eq.) and the desired aldehyde (1.3 eq.) in DMF<br>
was added DIPEA (2 eq.). The reaction was stirred at ambient temperature for 1-2<br>
hours and monitored by reverse-phase HPLC. Methanol and NaCNBH3 (1 eq.) were<br>
added to the solution, followed by TFA (3 eq.). Stirring was continued for an<br>
additional hour at ambient temperature. After the reaction was complete, the<br>
methanol was removed in vacuo. The residue was precipitated in acetonitrile.<br>
Filtration gave the crude product which was then purified by reverse-phase HPLC. If<br>
desired, other glycopeptides antibiotics may be used in this procedure.<br>
General Procedure B Synthesis of 2-(Decylthio)acetaldehyde<br>
Under nitrogen, to a suspension of potassium carbonate (27 g, 200 mmol) in acetone (100 ml) was added decyl bromide (10 ml, 50 mmol) and mercaptoethanol (4.4 ml, 63 mmol). The suspension was stirred at room temperature for 2 days, then partitioned between water and 80% hexane/ethyl acetate. The organic phase was washed with 2N sodium hydroxide, dried over magnesium sulfate, and the volatiles removed under vacuum to give 2-(decylthio)ethanol (10.2 g, 47 mmol) as a colorless liquid that was used without further purification.<br>
Under nitrogen, 2-(decylthio)ethanol (50 g, 230 mmol), N,N-diisopropylethylamine (128 ml, 730 mmol) and methylene chloride (400 ml) were cooled to -40 °C. To this solution was added, over 15 minutes, a solution of sulfur trioxide pyridine complex (116 g, 730 mmol) in dimethyl sulfoxide (600 ml) and methylene chloride (200 ml). After addition, the mixture was stirred a further 15 minutes at -40 °C, then 600 ml ice water as added. The mixture was removed from the cooling bath, 1 L water was added, and the liquids partitioned. The organic phase<br><br>
was washed with 1 L of 1 N hydrochloric acid, and dried over magnesium sulfate. Filtration gave 600 ml liquid, which was diluted with 600 ml hexane and passed through 200 ml silica. The silica was washed with 100 ml 50% methylene chloride/hexane, then 300 ml methylene chloride. The combined organics were concentrated in vacuo to give 2-(decylthio)acetaldehyde (48 g, 220 mmol) as a colorless liquid that was used without further purification.<br>
General Procedure C Synthesis of Nvan-2-(Decylthio)ethyl Vancomycin<br>
Procedure A: Under nitrogen, vancomycin hydrochloride hydrate (1 g, 0.64 mmol) was added to 2-(decylthio)acetaldehyde (139 mg, 0.64 mmol) in N,N-dimethylformamide (8 ml). A^jV-diisopropylethylamine (336 uL, 1.9 mmol) was added and the suspension stirred vigorously for 2.5 hours, over the course of which all the vancomycin dissolved. Solid sodium cyanoborohydride (60 mg, 0.96 mmol) was added, followed by methanol (5 ml) and trifluoroacetic acid (250 uL, 3.2 mmol). The reaction was stirred for 55 minutes at room temperature and analyzed by reverse phase HPLC. The product distribution based on uv absorption at 280nm was as follows:<br>

4.0	0.5<br>
Procedure B: Under nitrogen, to a solution of 2-(decylthio)acetaldehyde (crude, 48 g, 220 mmol) in A^-dimethylformamide (1.4 L) was added solid vancomycin hydrochloride hydrate (173 g, 110 mmol) followed by N,N-diisopropylethylamine (58 ml, 330 mmol). The suspension was stirred vigorously at room temperature for 2 hours, in the course of which time all the vancomycin fully dissolved, then trifluoroacetic acid (53 ml, 690 mmol) was added. The solution was<br><br>
stirred a further 90 minutes, then solid sodium cyanoborohydride (10.5 g, 170 mmol) followed by methanol (800 ml) were added. After three hours the reaction was analyzed by reverse-phase HPLC. The product distribution based on uv absorption at 280nm was as follows:<br>
Elution time (miri)	Area %	Product<br>
2.0	15	vancomycin<br>
3.2	77	Nvan-2-(decylthio)ethyl vancomycin<br>
3.3	3<br>
3.4	0.5	Nleu-2-(decylthio)ethyl vancomycin<br><br>
4.0	0.8      Nvan, Nlcu-bis-[2-(decylthio)ethyl] vancomycin<br>
4.1	4<br>
The reaction mixture from either of the above procedures was poured into water (7 L), resulting in a slightly cloudy solution. The pH of the solution was adjusted to 5 with saturated sodium bicarbonate, resulting in the formation of a white precipitate. This precipitate was collected by filtration, washed with water then ethyl acetate and dried under vacuum to afford Nvan-2-(decylthio)ethyl vancomycin, which was used without further purification.<br>
Procedure C: A solution of vancomycin hydrochloride (3.0 g, 2.1 mmol) in ACN/H2O (1:1, 30 ml) was treated with diisopropylethylamine (0.54 g, 0.72 ml, 4.2 mmol) followed by 2-(decylthio)acetaldehyde (0.91 g, 4.2 mmol) at 25 °C. After 30 min, the reaction mixture was treated with TFA (1.92 g, 1.29 ml, 16.8 mmol) followed by NaCNBH3 (0.132 g, 2.1 mmol). After 5 to 10 minutes, the crude product Nvan-2-(decylthio)ethyl vancomycin is precipitated in acetonitrile (300 ml).<br><br>

Purification of Compound 11<br>
(Formula I wherein R3 is -OH; R5 N-(phosphonomethyl)-<br>
aminomethyl; R19 is hydrogen, and R20 is -CH2CH2-NH-(CH2)9CH3)<br>
2 g of Amberlite XAD 1600 was combined with an excess of HPLC grade water for 4 hours. The excess water was removed, and the resin was washed successively with (1) excess HPLC grade water; (2) excess 10 mM Acetic Acid in methanol; (3) excess 10 mM acetic acid in 50/50 v/v ACN/water; (4) excess 5/95 v/v acetic acid/water; and (5) excess 10/90 v/v acetic acid/water.<br>
The resin was loaded onto a 1 cm internal diameter column (Omnifit #56001) fitted with a 20 psi back pressure regulator (Upchurch P-791,) a peristaltic pump (Ranin Dynamax Model RP-1) and a fraction collector (BioRad 2110), adjusted to provide a flow rate of elutant solution of 1 bed volume per hour, yielding 1ml fractions.<br>
The sample was prepared by dissolving 50 mg of crude compound 11 in 5 ml of 10/90 v/v acetic acid/water. The solution was sonicated for 5 minutes, and loaded onto the column at the 1 bed volume/hour flow rate. Twenty microliters of the loading solution was diluted 1:50 v/v with water and used as a standard for HPLC analysis.<br>
The loaded sample was eluted with 10 mM acetic acid in 17.5/82.5 v/v ACN/water. Each fraction was collected and tested for the presence of sample by thin layer chromatography (TLC). Each fraction was spotted onto the TLC plate (EM Science #15341) and compared to reference spots from the loading solution to confirm the presence of compound 11. Fractions were collected until compound 11 was no longer detected by TLC. The elutant solution was then switched to 10 mM acetic acid in 50/50 v/v ACN/water in order to wash off any remaining sample still on the column. The wash-off fractions were also tested by TLC for the presence of sample. Once the sample was no longer seen in the wash off, fraction collection was ended. The column was then washed in 5 bed volumes each of 10 mM acetic acid in methanol, 10 mM acetic acid in 50/50 v/v ACN/water, and 10/90 v/v acetic acid/water.<br>
Each fraction was vortexed, and diluted 1:10 with water into auto sampler<br><br>
vials. The auto sampler vials were vortexed and analyzed on a Varian HPLC system with ultraviolet detection at 214 nm. 20 microliters of each diluted fraction was injected onto a room temperature Zorbax Bonus-RP, 4.6 X 150 mm column.   The sample was eluted off the column with a 7 minute gradient from 82% A (5/95 v/v ACN/water 0.1% TFA) 18%B (95/5 ACN/water, 0.1% TFA) to 60%A/40%B.<br>
Fractions that contained more than 89% pure compound 11 were pooled. The pooled fractions were lyophilized overnight on a VirTis benchtop lyophilizer, and weighed to determine yield. The solid compound 11 was dissolved in 10/90 v/v acetic acid/water and diluted to 100 micrograms/milliliter in water. The 100 microgram/ml pure compound 11 was analyzed with the above HPLC method to verify its purity. The corrected yield is determined from the following formula: % yield compound 11 =     [(mg purifiedWo compound 11 in purified)]     x 100%<br>
[(mg crude loaded)(% compound 1 lin crude)] As shown below in the first line of Table III, the starting concentration of 74 % compound 11 was purified to a concentration of 90 % at a 59 % yield.<br>
Examples 5-13 Purification of Compound 11 with Multiple Resins and Elutant Solutions<br>
Compound 11 was purified by the process of Example 4 using a variety of resins and elutant solutions. Results are listed below in Table III.<br><br><br><br>
