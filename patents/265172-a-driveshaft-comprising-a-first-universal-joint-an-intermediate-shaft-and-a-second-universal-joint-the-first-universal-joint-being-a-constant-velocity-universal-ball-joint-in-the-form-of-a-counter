Driveshaft comprising a counter track joint<br>
featuring a delimited axial displacement path<br>
Description<br>
The invention relates to a driveshaft comprising a first<br>
universal joint, an intermediate shaft and a second<br>
universal joint, wherein the first universal joint is a<br>
constant velocity universal ball joint in the form of a<br>
counter track joint.<br>
Counter track joints of the type used as a first universal<br>
joint are described in DE 100 60 120 Al, and it is assumed<br>
that an axial displacement path has to be delimited as a<br>
function of the control angles occurring. In their axial<br>
central position, counter track joints of said type are<br>
free from axial forces and are therefore suitable for<br>
disconnecting lower vibrations in the driveline. However,<br>
if an axial displacement takes place under torque load,<br>
axial forces are built up, so that axial vibrations may be<br>
transmitted. If the axial displacement path is too long,<br>
the advantage of no axial forces or low axial forces is<br>
lost. It is therefore the object of the present invention<br>
to propose a driveshaft comprising a joint of said type<br><br>
2<br>
which can effectively contribute towards disconnecting<br>
vibrations in drivelines.<br>
The above-mentioned objective is achieved by providing a<br>
driveshaft comprising a first universal joint; an<br>
intermediate shaft; and a second universal joint, wherein<br>
the first universal joint is a constant velocity universal<br>
ball joint in the form of a counter track joint comprising<br>
an outer joint part with first and second outer ball tracks,<br>
an inner joint part with first and second inner ball tracks,<br>
wherein first outer ball tracks, together with first inner<br>
ball tracks, form first pairs of tracks which widen in a<br>
first axial direction Ril and wherein second outer ball<br>
tracks, together with second inner ball tracks, form second<br>
pairs of tracks which widen in a second axial direction Ri2;<br>
balls which are guided in the pairs of tracks and whose<br>
ball centres Z are positioned on a pitch circle radius PCR<br>
around a joint centre M; a ball cage with circumferentially<br>
distributed cage windows, in which ball cage the balls are<br>
held in a common central plane E and, when the joint is<br>
articulated, are guided on to the angle-bisecting plane,<br>
wherein between the outer joint part and the ball cage on<br>
the one hand and between the ball cage and the inner joint<br>
on the other hand there are provided axial clearances which<br>
permit a relative axial displacement between the outer<br>
joint part and the inner joint part.<br>
More particularly, it is proposed that the ratio between<br>
the total axial displacement S and the pitch circle radius<br>
PCR of the balls - when the joint is in the aligned<br>
condition - ranges between 0.01 and 0.09 (0.01 
0.09). If this axial displacement path referring to the<br>
joint size is observed, the axial forces resulting in the<br><br>
3<br>
operating range of the joint are prevented from becoming to<br>
high.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the ratio between the<br>
total axial displacement S and the pitch circle radius PCR<br>
of the balls - when the joint is in the aligned condition -<br>
is less than 0.05 (S/PCR 
particularly low if the differences between the opening<br>
angles of the pairs of tracks are relatively small. It is<br>
therefore proposed that when the joint is in the aligned<br>
condition, in the end positions of the relative axial<br>
displacement between the outer joint part and the inner<br>
joint part, the respective smaller opening angle a or (3 of<br>
the first pairs of tracks or of the second pairs of tracks<br>
is smaller than 8° (a 
the opening angle of the pairs of tracks can be such that,<br>
when the joint is in the aligned condition, in a central<br>
position of the relative axial displacement path between<br>
the outer joint part and the inner joint part, in which the<br>
opening angles a and (3 of the first pairs of tracks and of<br>
the second pairs of tracks are identical in size, both<br>
opening angles a and (3 are smaller than 8° (a 
More particularly, it is proposed that at the first<br>
universal joint, the inner face of the outer joint part,<br>
the outer face of the inner joint part as well as the outer<br>
face and the inner face of the ball cage are each faces of<br>
spherical portions, wherein the radial clearance COR<br>
between the outer joint part and the ball cage, and the<br>
radial clearance CIR between the ball cage and the inner<br>
joint part each, ranges between 0.015 and 0.20 mm. This<br>
measure allows the production of the first universal joint<br>
of this type to be advantageously simplified because those<br><br>
4<br>
surfaces which, in a joint of this type, do not have a<br>
guiding function, but only serve as axial stops, can be<br>
produced simply by a forming operation or by a simple<br>
turning operation. More particularly, it is proposed that,<br>
at the outer joint part, after the forming operation<br>
providing the necessary excess dimension needed for<br>
machining purposes, the inner spherical guiding face for<br>
the ball cage is only soft-turned and subsequently hardened,<br>
whereas the ball tracks are only hardened and ground after<br>
the forming operation. The guiding face and the ball tracks<br>
can be hardened by induction hardening in one single<br>
operation.<br>
It  is  further proposed as  an advantageous  dimensioning<br>
measure that the axial clearance BC of the balls in the<br>
cage windows ranges between -0.03mm (press fit) and 0.1 mm<br>
(clearance fit).<br>
According to a further preferred dimensioning measure, it<br>
is proposed that at the first universal joint, the radial<br>
ball clearance BO of the balls in the pairs of tracks<br>
ranges between -0.03 mm (press fit) and 0.08 mm (clearance<br>
fit). This range of values, like the above-mentioned range,<br>
applies to joints of all standard sizes in the automotive<br>
industry.<br>
A preferred track design of the respective first universal<br>
joint is described in claims 7 to 12 to which reference is<br>
hereby made. In this way it is ensured that large<br>
articulation angles become possible at the first universal<br>
joint and that, even at such large articulation angles,<br>
irrespective  of the  axial  displacement position,  it  is<br><br>
5<br>
possible to maintain good ball control conditions as a<br>
result of the track forces and thus a reliable control of<br>
the first universal joint. Said track design has so far<br>
only been proposed for fixed joints without the possibility<br>
of achieving an axial displacement (DE 103 37 612 Al).<br>
The first universal joint can preferably be provided with<br>
six balls or with eight balls.<br>
As far as the design of the second universal joint of the<br>
inventive driveshaft is concerned, it is proposed that the<br>
second universal joint is an axial plunging joint, more<br>
particularly in the form of a tripode joint, a VL plunging<br>
joint or an XL plunging joint or a DO plunging joint.<br>
Alternatively, it is proposed that the second universal<br>
joint is provided in the form of a fixed joint, more<br>
particularly in the form of a Cardan joint, an AC joint, a<br>
UF-joint or a counter track joint. As far as the latter<br>
alternative is concerned it is additionally proposed that<br>
the intermediate shaft is an axial plunging unit, so that<br>
even a driveshaft composed in this way can accommodate<br>
substantial changes in length. In ail the above-mentioned<br>
variants, any vibrations axially introduced into the<br>
driveshaft can be disconnected in the first universal joint<br>
provided in the form of a displaceable counter-track joint<br>
via the low-force axial displaceability of same to an<br>
extent which cannot be achieved by prior art joints and<br>
axial plunging units.<br>

the drawings and will be described below.<br><br>

The illustrations of Figure 1 will be described jointly<br>
below. An inventive counter track joint 11 comprises an<br>
outer joint part 12 with a formed-on base 13,  an inner<br><br>
9<br>
joint part 14 with an inserted shaft 15, pairs of tracks<br>
consisting of first outer ball tracks 16 and first inner<br>
ball tracks 17 which open in a central joint plane E in a<br>
first direction Ril towards the base 13, as well as second<br>
pairs of tracks consisting of second outer ball tracks 18<br>
and second inner ball tracks 19 which open in a central<br>
joint plane E in a second axial direction Ri2 towards the<br>
shaft 15. A plurality of first and second pairs of tracks<br>
16, 17 is distributed around the joint circumference. The<br>
opening angle of the first pairs of tracks 16, 17 in the<br>
central plane E has been given the symbol a; the opening<br>
angle of the second pairs of tracks 18, 19 in the central<br>
plane E has been given the symbol (3. In the pairs of tracks<br>
there are accommodated first balls 20i and second balls 2O2<br>
which are held in a ball cage 21 with circumf erentially<br>
distributed cage windows 22 in a common central plane E.<br>
There is also shown the central axis A of the aligned joint,<br>
which central axis A intersects the central plane E in the<br>
joint centre M. When torque is transmitted, forces Fl are<br>
applied to the first balls 20i towards the base 13, with<br>
second forces F2 being applied to the second balls 202<br>
towards the shaft 15. In the illustrated central position<br>
of the joint, the forces Fl and F2 are identical because<br>
the angles a, (3 are identical in size, so that the sum of<br>
all axial forces FC applied to the ball cage 21 equals zero.<br>
As can be seen in illustrations c) and d), the ball cage 21<br>
comprises a radial clearance and thus also an axial<br>
clearance both relative to the outer joint part 12 and to<br>
the inner joint part 14, with the entire axial clearance<br>
between the outer joint part 12 and the inner joint part 14<br>
being referred to as "S". In the embodiment illustrated,<br>
the outer joint part 12 comprises a spherical inner face 23<br><br>
10<br>
and the inner joint part 14 a spherical outer face 24.<br>
Furthermore, the ball cage 21 comprises a spherical outer<br>
face 25 and a spherical inner face 26.<br>
In Figure 2, details identical to those shown in Figure 1<br>
have been given the same reference numbers. Therefore,<br>
reference is made to the preceding description. The<br>
individual illustrations of Figure 2 will be described<br>
jointly below. The joint is shown in a position in which<br>
the inner joint part 14 is displaced relative to the<br>
central plane E referring to the outer joint part 12 by the<br>
axial displacement path S2 in the first direction. As a<br>
result of said displacement, the opening angle a of the<br>
first pairs of tracks 16, 17 becomes smaller, whereas the<br>
opening angle (3 of the second pairs of tracks 18, 19<br>
becomes greater. As a result, during the transmission of<br>
torque, the axial forces Fl applied to the first balls 20i<br>
become smaller and the axial forces F2 applied to the<br>
second balls 2O2 become greater. The sum of the axial forces<br>
FC is thus not equal to zero and extends towards the shaft<br>
15. In this position, the cage and thus the joint as a<br>
whole can no longer be displaced in an axially force-free<br>
way.<br>
In Figure 3, details identical to those shown in Figures 1<br>
and 2 have been given the same reference numbers. Therefore<br>
reference is made to the preceding description. In<br>
illustration b), the joint is shown in the axial section in<br>
the central axial position according to Figure lc. The<br>
enlarged detail shows that the inner joint part 14<br>
comprises the axial clearances Sli and S2i relative to the<br>
ball cage 21. Furthermore, it can be seen that the ball<br><br>
11<br>
cage 21 comprises the axial clearances Slo and S2o relative<br>
to the outer joint part 12. As a result, the maximum<br>
displacement path SI shown in illustration a) in one<br>
direction, corresponds to the sum of Sli and Slo, and the<br>
maximum displacement path S2 in the opposite direction<br>
shown in illustration c) corresponds to the sum of S2i and<br>
S2o. In the respective end positions, the ball cage 21<br>
abuts the inner joint part 14 and/or the outer joint part<br>
12. The total displacement path S is obtained as the sum of<br>
51	and S2, with "S" referring to the displacement of the<br>
inner joint part 14 relative to the outer joint part 12<br>
from one abutment to the other abutment.<br>
In Figure 4, details identical to those shown in Figures 1<br>
to 3 have been given the same reference numbers. To that<br>
extent, reference is made to the preceding description. The<br>
illustrations a) , b) and c) largely correspond to<br>
illustrations a), b) and c) of Figure 3. Illustration b) ,<br>
in addition, shows the pitch circle radius PCR of the balls<br>
from the central axis A to the ball centre 7 of the aligned<br>
joint. There is given the inventive range for the design<br>
conditions between the maximum displacement path S = SI +<br>
52	and the pitch circle radius PCR with 0.01 
In Figure 5 any details identical to those shown in Figure<br>
1 to 4 have been given the same reference numbers. To that<br>
extent, reference is made to the description of same. The<br>
illustration to Figure a) corresponds to the illustration<br>
according to Figure 4b. In the enlarged detail according to<br>
Figure b), there are given the radial clearances CIR<br>
between the outer ball face 24 of the inner joint part 14<br>
and the inner ball face 26 of the ball cage 21, as well as<br><br>
12<br>
the radial clearances COR between the outer ball face 25 of<br>
the ball cage 21 and of the inner ball face 23 of the outer<br>
joint part 12. There are also given the ranges of said<br>
clearances as 0.015 
with said values referring to millimetres.<br>
In Figure 6, any details identical to those shown in<br>
Figures 1 to 5 have been given the same reference numbers.<br>
To that extent, reference is made to the description of<br>
same. The illustration to Figure a) corresponds to the<br>
illustration according to Figure 4b, with the illustration<br>
b) showing an enlarged detail. Illustration b) shows the<br>
radial play BO of the ball in one pair of tracks 16, 18 as<br>
well as the axial play BC of the ball 20i in the cage window<br>
22, with the values for BC having been given as -0.03 


Figure 7 shows an inventive counter track joint with six<br>
pairs of tracks 16, 17; 18, 19 and thus six balls 20 in a<br>
longitudinal section and in a plan view. First and second<br>
pairs of tracks alternate around the circumference.<br>
Identical details have been given the same reference<br>
numbers as in the previous Figures 1 to 6. To that extent,<br>
reference is made to the respective descriptions.<br>
Figure 8 shows an inventive counter track joint with eight<br>
balls 20, with one longitudinal section A-A extending<br>
through first pairs of tracks 16, 17 and one longitudinal<br>
section B-B extending through second pairs of tracks 18, 19.<br>
First and second pairs of tracks alternate around the<br>
circumference. Identical details have been given the same<br><br>
13<br>
reference numbers as in the previous Figures 1 to 6. To<br>
that extent, reference is made to the respective<br>
descriptions.<br>
Figure 9 shows the joint according to Figure 7 with opening<br>
angles a and (3 of the first pairs of tracks which open in<br>
the first direction Ril and in the second direction Ri2<br>
respectively. Details regarding the track centre lines of<br>
the ball tracks - as shown in Figure 10 - analogously also<br>
refer to the joint according to Figure 8. The centre line<br>
M16 of the illustrated first outer ball tracks 16 in the<br>
outer joint part 12 consists of an arch with a first radius<br>
R2 with a centre 02 which is arranged on the longitudinal<br>
axis A with an axial offset relative to the central plane E<br>
towards the base; of a continuously adjoining arch with a<br>
smaller radius R3, whose centre 03 comprises the same axial<br>
offset towards the base as the centre 02 of R2; as well as<br>
of an arch with a counter radius Rl whose centre 01<br>
comprises an axial offset relative to the central plane E<br>
in the opposite direction relative to the centres 02, 03 of<br>
the arches with the radii R2, R3, i.e. towards the opening<br>
end, and whose centre 01 is positioned outside a circle<br>
with the radius R2 around the centre 02. It can be seen at<br>
the inner joint part that the centre line M17 of the<br>
illustrated first inner ball tracks 17 extends mirror-<br>
symmetrically relative to the centre plane E, i.e. it is<br>
composed of arches with the radii R2' , R3' and Rl' around<br>
the centres 02' , 03' , 01' identically, but mirro-<br>
symmetrically. The centre line Ml8 of the second outer ball<br>
track 18 comprises an arch with a first radius R5, whose<br>
centre 05 is positioned on the longitudinal axis A, with an<br>
axial offset which is opposed to the offset of the centre<br><br>
14<br>
02 of the arch with the radius R2, i.e. towards the opening<br>
end. The arch with the radius R5 is followed, towards the<br>
opening end, by an arch with the counter radius R4 whose<br>
centre 04 is positioned outside a circle with the radius R5<br>
around the centre 05 and which comprises an axial offset<br>
towards the central plane E, which axial offset extends in<br>
the same direction. It can be seen that the centre line M19<br>
of the second inner ball track 19 in the inner joint part<br>
14 extends mirror-symmetrically relative to the centre line<br>
M18 of the second outer ball tracks 18, i.e. it is composed<br>
of arches with the radii R5' and R4' around the centres 05',<br>
04', but mirror-symmetrically relative to the centre plane<br>
E. The first outer ball tacks 16 and the first inner ball<br>
tracks 17, in the central plane E, form the opening angle<br>
a which opens in the first direction Ril, whereas the<br>
second outer ball tracks 18 and the second inner ball<br>
tracks 19 in the central plane form the opening angle (3<br>
which opens in the opposite direction, i.e. in direction<br>
Ri2. When said inventive joint is axially displaced, which<br>
becomes possible as a result of the inventive cage<br>
clearance, the opening angles vary in opposite directions,<br>
with the joint changing from the position which is free<br>
from axial forces into positions in which there occur<br>
returning forces.<br>
The term "axial offset" has the same meaning as the term<br>
"axial distance" and "axial offset" respectively.<br>
Figures	11 to 18 each show an inventive driveshaft which,<br>
in the	form of the first universal joint,  comprises a<br>
counter	track joint 11 of the above-described type similar<br>
to the	embodiment according to Figure 7;  furthermore an<br><br>
15<br>
intermediate shaft 31 (Figures 11 to 15) and an<br>
intermediate shaft with an integrated axial displacement<br>
unit 91 (Figures 16 to 18) as well as, finally, a second<br>
universal joint in the form of an axially plunging joint<br>
(Figures 11 to 14) and a second universal joint in the<br>
form of a fixed joint (Figures 15 to 18), respectively. The<br>
details of the first universal joint 11 have been given the<br>
same reference numbers as in the preceding Figures. To that<br>
extent, reference is made to the preceding description. The<br>
intermediate shaft 31 is connected via a plug-in connection<br>
to the components of the first universal joint 11 and of<br>
the second universal joint. The same applies to the multi-<br>
part intermediates shaft with an integrated plunging unit<br>
91 which comprises a sleeve portion 92 with inner shaft<br>
toothing 93 as well as a plug-in journal 94 and,<br>
furthermore, a journal portion 95 with outer shaft toothing<br>
96 which, in an axially plunging way, engages the inner<br>
shaft toothing 93.<br>
A double arrow VI at the second universal joint indicates<br>
the introduction of excitation forces into the second<br>
universal joint. A further double arrow V2 at the<br>
intermediate shaft 31, 91 indicates the transfer of said<br>
vibrations towards the first universal joint 11. In the<br>
detail relating to the first universal joint 11, a third<br>
double arrow V3 finally refers to the disconnection of the<br>
vibrational excitation in the first universal joint 11,<br>
wherein the inner joint part does not transmit any<br>
substantial forces to the outer joint part of the counter<br>
track joint which is thus held in a vibration-free<br>
condition.<br><br>
16<br>
The balls 20i, 202 of the first universal joint 11 are<br>
illustrated with arrows for forces which axially extend in<br>
opposite directions, which forces symbolise the resulting<br>
freedom from axial forces.<br>
Hereafter, only the respective second universal joints will<br>
be described.<br>
Figure 11, shows an AAR tripode joint 41 as the second<br>
universal joint which comprises an outer joint part 42 with<br>
three circumferentially distributed guiding tracks 43, a<br>
tripode star 44 with circumferentially distributed tripode<br>
arms 45 as well as rotatable roller assemblies 46 pivotably<br>
held on the tripode arms. The inner joint part 44 is<br>
axially displaceably held in the outer joint part 42, with<br>
the roller assemblies 46 being in rolling contact, and it<br>
is angularly movable relative to said outer joint part 42.<br>
Figure 12 shows a GI tripode joint 51 as the second<br>
universal joint which comprises an outer joint part 52 with<br>
three circumferentially distributed guiding tracks 53, a<br>
tripode star 54 with circumferentially distributed tripode<br>
arms 55, as well as rollers 56 which are rotatably<br>
supported on the tripode arms. The inner joint part 54 is<br>
axially displaceably held in the outer joint part 52, with<br>
the rollers 56 carrying out a rolling movement, and can be<br>
articulated relative to said outer joint part 52.<br>
Figure 13 shows a VL or XL plunging joint 61 as the second<br>
universal joint which comprises an outer joint part 62 with<br>
longitudinally extending outer ball tracks 63 which<br>
intersect the longitudinal axis, as well as an inner joint<br><br>
17<br>
part 64 with longitudinally extending inner ball track 65<br>
which intersect the longitudinal direction in the opposite<br>
direction, with there being provided torque transmitting<br>
balls 66 which are guided in outer ball tracks 63 and inner<br>
ball tracks 65 and which, in turn, are held by a cage 67 in<br>
a common plane. The cage 67 comprises an axial clearance<br>
relative to the inner joint part 64 and is guided in an<br>
inner cylindrical guiding face 68 of the outer joint part<br>
62. In this way, the inner joint part 64 is held so as to<br>
be axially displaceable and articulatable relative to the<br>
outer joint part 62.<br>
Figure 14 shows a DO plunging joint as second universal<br>
joint which comprises an outer joint part 72 with axially<br>
extending outer ball tracks 73 as well as an inner joint<br>
part 74 with axially extending inner ball tracks 75. In<br>
pairs of outer ball tracks 73 and inner ball tracks 75<br>
there are guided torque transmitting balls 76 which, in<br>
turn, are held by a cage 77 in a common plane. The cage 77<br>
is held in an inner cylindrical guiding face 78 of the<br>
outer joint part 72 so as to be axially displaceable and<br>
articulatable, and on an externally spherical guiding face<br>
79 of the inner joint part 74 so as to be articulatable<br>
only, so that, in this way, the inner joint part 74 is<br>
axially displaceably and articulatably guided relative to<br>
the outer joint part 72.<br>
In the driveshaft according to Figure 15 there is shown a<br>
cardan joint or Hooke's joint 81 as second universal joint.<br>
It comprises a first joint yoke 82 and a second joint yoke<br>
83 which is rotated by 90° relative to said first joint yoke<br>
82.  The axial plunging unit is not  shown,  but can be<br><br>
18<br>
assumed to be arranged in the interrupted part of the<br>
intermediate shaft 31.<br>
Figure 16, as second universal joint, shows an AC joint<br>
(angular contact joint) which comprises an outer joint part<br>
102 with outer circularly curved ball tracks 103 and an<br>
inner joint part 104 with inner circularly curved ball<br>
tracks 105. In the pairs of tracks consisting of identical<br>
outer ball tracks 103 and inner ball tracks 105, which form<br>
opening angles pointing towards the intermediate shaft,<br>
there are accommodated torque transmitting balls 106 which<br>
are held by a ball cage 107 in a common plane. The ball<br>
cage 107 is pivotably held and axially supported in an<br>
inner spherical guiding face 108 of the outer joint part<br>
102. An axial displacement between the two joints 11, 101<br>
can take place inside the axial plunging unit 91.<br>
Figure 17, as second universal joint, shows a UF joint<br>
(undercut-free joint) with an outer joint part 112 with<br>
outer axially undercut-free ball tracks 113 and an inner<br>
joint part 114 with inner axially undercut-free ball tracks<br>
115, wherein, in pairs of outer ball tracks 113 and inner<br>
ball tracks 115 forming angles pointing to the intermediate<br>
shaft, there are held balls 116 which, in turn, are held by<br>
a ball cage 117 in a common plane. The ball cage 117 is<br>
pivotably held and axially supported in an inner spherical<br>
guiding face 118 of the outer joint part 112. The joint is<br>
thus a fixed joint, so that the axial displacement has to<br>
take place between the first universal joint 11 and the<br>
second universal joint 111 inside the axial plunging unit<br>
91.<br><br>
19<br>
In Figure 18, the second universal joint is provided as<br>
counter track joint 11' which, in this case, is provided in<br>
the form of a fixed joint without the possibility of an<br>
axial displacement. The details have been given the same<br>
reference numbers as in the case of the first universal<br>
joint 11. The axial displacement between the first<br>
universal joint 11 and the second universal joint 11' can<br>
take place inside the axial plunging unit 91 in the way<br>
already described.<br><br><br>
