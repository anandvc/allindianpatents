AMENDMENT AND REMARKS PURSUANT TO PCT ARTICLE 34<br>
Sir:<br>
Please substitute pages 22-28 attached herewith for original pages 22-28. Please consider the amendments contained in the substitute sheets as well as the remarks below in the International Preliminary Examination to be conducted pursuant to the Demand filed herewith.<br>
RESPONSE TO REMARKS OF THE INTERNATIONAL SEARCHING AUTHORITY:<br>
The Examiner has stated that a copy of the claimed priority document has not been fur¬nished, therefore making it impossible to validate die priority claim. A copy of the "Notification Concerning Submission or Transmittal of Priority Document" issued on 7 October 2004 by the In¬ternational Bureau confirming receipt of the priority document on 27 September 2004. It is be¬lieved that the Examiner has made an error and that validation of the priority date should be made.<br>
The Examiner has cited published US application no. US2002/187536 (hereinafter Dl), is¬sued U.S. Patent No. 4,439,420 (hereinafter D2), U.S. Patent No. 3,957,662 (hereinafter D3), jour¬nal publication entitled "Studies on the promoting effects of medium chain fatty acid salts on the nasal absorption of insulin" (hereinafter D4) against the present application, and U.S. Patent No. 6,610,653 (hereinafter D5).<br>
Claim 1 has been revised as follows:<br>
1. A fatty acid salt composition comprising fatty acid salt particles having a size distribution wherein the particles are from about 1 to about 1,000 microns in diameter, wherein the fatty acid salt comprises a fatty acid component selected from the group consisting of butyric acid, caoroic acid, caprvlic acid, capric acid, lauric acid, mvristic acid, palmitic acid. palmitoleic acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid, aloha-linolenic acid, gamma- linolenic acid, arachidic acid, gadoleic acid, arachidonic acid.

TRII\598756vl	1<br>
The modification recites a specific group of fatty acids, which excludes the stearates described in the cited references.<br>
Claim 11, which was objected to for lack of inventive step has been revised to render it an inde¬pendent claim:<br>
11.	A fatty acid salt composition comprising fatty acid salt particles having The fatty aoid salt composition of olaim 1 whoroin tho portioloa have a an average particle size distribution of from about 5 to about 500 microns in diameter.<br>
Claim 11 recites particle sizes that are outiside the range of the particle sizes described in the ref¬erences.<br>

TRll\59875«vl	2<br>
18.	The fatty acid salt composition of claim 4 17 wherein the particles have a size distribution an average particle size of from about 20 to about 80 mi¬crons in diameter.<br>

25.	The fatty acid salt composition of claim 8 H wherein tho partiolc3 have a size distribution from about 5 to about 500 miorons in diameter at least about 90% of the particles are from about 1 to about 1.000 microns in di¬ameter.<br>
26.	The fatty acid salt composition of claim 8 25 wherein the particles have a siao distribution an average particle size of from about 20 to about 80 mi¬crons in diameter.<br>
27.	The fatty acid salt composition of claim 9-1_1 wherein tho particles have a size distribution from about 5 to about 500 miorons in diameterjitjeast about 95% of the particles are from about 1 to about 1.000 microns in di¬ameter.<br>
28.	The fatty acid salt composition of claim 9 27 wherein the particles have a size distribution an average particle size of from about 20 to about 80 mi¬crons in diameter.<br>
29.	The fatty acid salt composition of claim 40 J_1 wherein tho particles have a sizo distribution from about 5 to about 500 miorono in diameter at least about 99% of the particles are from about 1 to about 1.000 microns in di¬ameter. <br>
30.	The fatty acid salt composition of claim 40 29 wherein die particles have a oize diotribution an average particle size of from about 20 to about 80 microns in diameter.<br>
Claims 31-36 have been revised to recite that the pharmaceutical composition is a "solid oral dos¬age form," as follows:<br>
31.	A pharmaceutical composition comprising in a solid oral dosage form2:<br>
(a)	the fatty acid salt composition of claims 1, and<br>
(b)	a biologically active agent.<br>
32.	A pharmaceutical composition comprising in a solid oral dosage form:<br>
(a)	the fatty acid salt composition of claims 5, and<br>
(b)	a biologically active agent.<br>
33.	A pharmaceutical composition comprising in a solid oral dosage form:<br>
(a)	the fatty acid salt composition of claims 10, and<br>
(b)	a biologically active agent.<br>
34.	A pharmaceutical composition comprising in a solid oral dosage form:<br>
(a)	die fatty acid salt composition of claims 11, and<br>
(b)	a biologically active agent<br>
35.	A pharmaceutical composition comprising in a solid oral dosage form:<br>
(a)	the fatty acid salt composition of claims 15, and<br>
(b)	a biologically active agent<br>
36.	A pharmaceutical composition comprising in a solid oral dosage form:<br>
(a)	die fatty acid salt composition of claims 20, and<br>
(b)	a biologically active agent<br>
This limitation excludes D4 which relates only to nasal delivery. In fact, D4 teaches away from the oral delivery of proteins and peptides:<br>
"It is well known that the hormone [insulin] is poorly absorbed after oral ad¬ministration because of its degradation by gastrointestinal proteases and its<br>
poor permeability through gastrointestinal mucosa due to its high molecular weight"1<br>
D4 then proceeds to propose an altrenative route of administration for insulin - the nasal route - and proposes sodium cap rate, sodium caprylate and sodium laurate as promoters of absorption af¬ter nasal administration. As stated by the authors, "In die present study, we investigated the pro¬moting effect of medium chain fatty acid sodium salts on nasal absorption of insulin in rats."4 Nothing in D4 teaches or suggests the use of fatty acid salts in the size range claimed by the appli¬cants in the preparation of a "solid oral dosage form."<br>
Further, it is noted that none of Dl, D2 or D3 mention the use of fatty acid salts for delivery of proteins or peptides, much less the use of fatty acid salts of die size ranges recited by the appli¬cants for the oral delivery of proteins and peptides. One of skill in die art would not simply as¬sume that these small molecule formulations would also be useful in the oral delivery of proteins and peptides, as evidenced by die fact the D4 teaches away from the oral delivery of proteins and peptides.<br>
New claims 75-78 have been added further emphasizing die oral delivery aspect of the invention by reciting that the pharmaceutical composition is provided in a solid oral dosage form that is a tablet5 (claim 75 and 77, which depend from claim 1) or a capsule6 (claim 76 and 78, which de¬pend from claim 11).<br>
The Examiner did not identify support in the cited references for the rejection of claims 37-45. Consequently, the applicants respectfully request the Examiner to withdraw the rejections of these claims.<br>
Claims 46-74 all depend from claim 31 and are novel and inventive for the reasons discussed above, in addition to die specific limitations of these claims. Thus, for example, the cited refer¬ences do not teach or suggest the use of medium chain fatty acids having the particle sizes claimed by the applicants in a solid oral dosage form (see claims 46 and 47). Nor do die cited references further teach die use of use of medium chain fatty acids having the particle sizes claimed by the applicants in a solid oral dosage form with a biologicallally active agent comprising a conjugated, pegylated or unconjugated polypeptide drug or prodrug (see claims 48-52). <br>
Further, die cited references do not teach or suggest the use of a formulation as recited in claim 31 with the specific calcitonin drugs recited in claims S3-SS or the specific insulin drugs recited in claims 56-62.<br>
Further, the cited references do not teach the specific molecular weight limitations of the drug, as recited in claims 63-65.<br>
It is noted that the treatment method claims (66-68) were not examined; however, these claims are retained in the application for examination in those countries in which such claims are allowable.<br>
Finally, the cited references do not teach or suggest tablets having the specific dissolution rates re¬cited in claims 69-74.<br>
In conclusion, the objections raised by the Examiner in die Written Opinion are overcome by the amendments and arguments presented herein, and the Examiner is respectfully requested to issue a clean International Preliminary Examination Report. <br>
