The special features of this Chair are that, it gives complete flexibility to suit individual preference, such as height and size of the seat and height and dimensions of the foot rest along with restricted heights for the chair wheels through which it distributes the body weight evenly.<br>
Another inventory features of this Chair is provided with lower moveable handle fixed at a lower level to support the elbow at 90 degrees angle and it is allowed to move forward and backward and rotates at 360 degrees well above the seat level by the lengthy contour slot given in the wooden handle with a rounded metal washer attached to the stud. Under this said moveable handle the accessories are attached in a fixed position preferably to suit the body movement and the height of the person and it also can be made to expand the surface area for the backrest.<br>
Another feature of this Chair that the right arm handle is higher than the left arm handle and it is fixed at a higher level than the table height. The said higher arm handle is given a downward slope on the surface area for easy operation on the key-board.<br>
Another feature of this invention embodies a telescopic sleeve Pole consists of two cylindrical parts such as inner sleeve and outer sleeve. The inner sleeve is provided with a longitudinal slot to align the stopper handle along with a marking scale. The said pole consists of a rectangular wooden piece curved on all corners to rest the three parts of the hand. Further, the pole is vertically fixed on the inner side of the three horizontal cross bars by allowing a clearance in<br><br>
the front side of the chair to make it more close to the body to lean against the said Pole. Besides, it is closely in parallel to the front left vertical leg piece. By adjusting the telescopic sleeve Pole, the Chair can be pushed right under the table to save space in the room.<br>
Another feature of the Chair is provided with an additional seat that acts as cross bar on the right side of the chair to accompany a child of 6 to 10 year to sit along with the tutor at the rear.<br>
Another feature of the Chair is to provide easy operation for a child of three years whose body structure is so small can easily monitor the screen at a close range where the child"s legs are put in between the two vertical leg pieces in order to sit under the lower arm handle which is kept at a very low level accompanying a cross bar just over the child"s lap and in turn it prevents the child from falling by sitting along with the cross bar partly acts as a seat. This way, it enables the child to touch the screen to point out pictures with the tutor seated at the rear.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide sufficient room in the Chair where the two arm handles are integrally fixed on either side of the chair. As there is no back-rest it allows the operator to sit on all four directions.<br>
The invention provides a Computer Chair comprising four vertical leg pieces situated at the corners of the rectangular shaped Chair connected and fixed to two wooden cross bars constituting the footrests on either sides and two other cross bar perpendicular thereto at the same level, four such horizontal cross bars In the middle of the Chair in a rectangular form, two of those horizontal cross bars supporting the seat of the Chair and two of the other cross bars accompanying as supporting seats, two of the vertical leg pieces on the left side of the Chair ending with a horizontal cross bar, upon which is made a contour slot for fixing a pliable lower left arm thereupon, by means of a metal stud bolt nut screwed upon a round metal washer, the lower left arm serving the purpose of the occupant to lean left hand thereupon and thereby to transfer body mass, the left side of the Chair having a telescopic sleeve, comprising inner and outer sleeves, running parallel to the left vertical leg and adjoining thereto on the front side of the Chair, carrying a metal plate on top with a flat<br><br>
rectangular wooden piece fixed thereupon, thereby providing for the occupant to hold and to rest upon the telescopic sleeve, the other two vertical leg pieces on the right side of the Chair ending with supporting horizontal cross bars, to which is fixed the right higher arm, facilitating resting thereupon, the four vertical leg pieces each having at its base a wheel attached thereto for maneuvering the Chair.<br>

The said lower arm handle rotates approximately 18 cms well above the seat level and moves forward close to the key-board. Provision is also made to raise or lower the said lower arm handle by attaching the accessories in a fixed position over the wooden cross bar (Figure No.1 (No.4). In turn the said cross bar is rigidly fixed on top of the two short wooden vertical leg pieces (Figure No.1 (No. 8) each vertical leg piece Dimensions 5.3cms x 4cms for<br><br>
length of 56cms). And the said accessories are attached preferably to suit the body movements and the height of the person seated on the chair and it also can be made to expand the surface area (Figure No.3 (No.2) for the backrest. These adjustments are made according to one"s need. Further, this lower arm handle being kept so low able to supports the left elbow at 90 degrees angle. This way It distributes the body weight evenly.<br>
The right Higher arm is a wooden handle (Figure No1. (No. 19) surface area 20cms X 45cms and thickness 2cms) integrally fixed on top of the two vertical leg pieces (Figure No.1 (No. 13) One number of the said leg piece has a dimensions 5.3cms x 4cms for a length of 69.25cms and the other one has a dimensions 5.3cms x 4cms for a length of 70cms). The short wooden leg piece is fixed in front and the other one is fixed at the back and over this the handle is integrally fixed to give a marginal slope to the surface area of the higher arm handle which being kept at a higher level than the table height. The said handle is permanently fixed along with the cross bar (Figure No.1 (No. 16) supporting the said two leg pieces. In this position, the front portion of the higher arm handle not exceeding 78.5cms (Figure No.2 height shown as No.2) from the ground. And the said slope is mainly given for the easy operation on the key¬board. Further, this right handle gives adequate support for the vertebral column by putting the legs on either side of the chair facing the lower arm handle and in turn the higher arm handle acts as a back-rest (Figure No.1.

And the foot-rest being kept so low to suit the leg movements while moving the feet from the foot-rest to the floor and back again. To achieve this objectives, the foot-rest is alleviated just Scms from the ground shown in the (Figure No.2 the distance shown as No.3) and this is meant only for those who use chapels or bear foot and for high heel shoes reduce the foot rest height to that extent by laying the carpet in the foot area. These dimensions and height of the footrest preferably to have free movements for the legs for permitting long spell of operation on the key-board.<br><br>
Additional seat space for a child (Figure No.1. (No.15) and in turn it acts as a cross bar Dimensions 37.5cms and on the inner side 29cms x 10cms x 3cms) has been provided to assist a 6 to 10 years child to operate the keyboard on the table by putting his two legs in between the two vertical leg pieces (Figure No.1 (No. 13) on the right side of the Chair, facing the higher arm handle, and the child can rest his two hands by the support of the higher arm handle. And the tutor at the rear can give proper guidance to the child. This way it allows both of them to view the monitor directly, while sitting on the Chair.<br>
Further, it assists a 3 to 5 years old child whose body structure being so small, can sit-up in between the two vertical leg pieces (Figure No.1 (No.8) on the left side of the Chair under the moveable lower arm handle which is fixed to the cross bar (Figure No.1 (No.4). Under the said handle of the cross bar at a different level another cross bar (Figure No.1 (No.7) is quite large in its surface area on the inner side of the frame and it being aligned with the seat level partly act as an additional seat. In turn the lower arm wooden handle of the cross bar prevent the child from falling, while the child points out the pictures on the screen. In this mode of operation, precise bolts and nuts are to be attached to the accessories fixed with a submerge nut under the said cross bar surface supporting the said handle. Thereby it avoids hurting the child"s leg. And with the tutor seated at the rear, enable both of them to have a clear view of the key-board as well as the monitor on the table. The Chair provides easy operation to both of them.<br>
This Chair has been provided with four chair wheels (Figure No.1 (No.9) fixed at the bottom of the chair, out of which two act as a stopper wheels. The chair wheels height are restricted to a bare minimum where it should not exceed more than 4.5cms and smaller the wheels can ensure the height of the footrest.<br>
The seat is made horizontally narrow (Figure No.1 (No. 17) dimensions 43cms x 37.5cms x 2cms) and its surface area is almost flat and the distance between the floor and the height of the seat is approximately 47cms shown in the (Figure No.2 (No.4) can give equal support for the legs and it can easily accommodate of any persons height 5ft 3 inches to 5.ft 10 inches and the rest<br><br>
can be adjusted by the cushion height of the seat. Persons of below height 5ft 2 inches reduce height of the seat in proportion to the chair. The seat is fixed to the two horizontal wooden cross bars (Figure No.1 (No.14) in turn they are fixed to the four vertical leg pieces along with two horizontal wooden cross bars (Figure No.1 (Nos.7 &amp; 15) fixed in the same plane of the seat level that allows the child to sit in between the two vertical leg pieces. The seat has some specialty in sitting on this designed Chair where the tail end of the vertebral column just falls out side the seat when two legs are put simultaneously either on the front side or on the rear side of the Chair as there is no back-rest.<br>
Further, two arms handles are fixed on either side of the Chair gives room to sit in all four directions as there is no backrest.<br>
The height of the moveable adjustable arm of the Chair is so low and therefore ensure the table height to be minimum 73cms and maximum allowed 76cms by readjusting the telescopic sleeve pole to the lowest level one can incorporate the Chair to save space in the room.<br>
Accessories<br>
