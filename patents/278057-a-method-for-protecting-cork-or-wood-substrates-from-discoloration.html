Color Stabilization of Cork and Colored Woods by the Combined Use of Inorganic and Organic UV-Absorbers<br>
The instant invention relates to a method for the color stabilization of cork and specific dark woods by the combined use of a small amount of inorganic UV-absorbers and an excess of organic UV-absorbers in a protective coating. A further aspect of the invention is the use of such a UV-absorber combination for the color stabilization of cork and specific colored woods.<br>
For example cork panels are typically used in kitchens and bathrooms for flooring. They are typically covered by coatings to protect them from humidity, mechanical impacts and light. These colored cork specimens are very sensitive to UV and visible light. Light causes a bleaching of the initial coloration, resulting in an unwished whitish/grayish appearance. This effect is also known for other colored or dark wood species, such as beech, alder, meant, oak, cherry, teak, nut, redwood, mahogany, eucalyptus, American beech, durian, red cedar, leeched tree, champak,  , Taiwan ash, camphor tree, zebra wood, machos, rosewood, rain tree and ironwood.<br>
The problem can not be solved by the single use of organic UV absorbers, such as benzophenone, benzotriazole or triazine UV absorbers which protect only in the UV-A and UV-B region. The visible light still bleaches the natural colorants in the cork/wood species.<br>
UV absorbers for the visible area, which screen a part of the visible light, are in general pigments. However, when pigments are used alone they have to be used in an effective amount and thereby impart their inherent color and opacity to the coating.<br>
WO 2005/005114 suggests a pretreatment of wood in general with specific hydroxy or nitrify groups containing tetramethylpiperidines and applying then a coating over the wood panels, which contains transparent inorganic oxides. However the amounts of transparent oxides needed are too high and impart an undesired color to the substrate. Cork and specific dark wood species are not mentioned.<br>
The present invention provides a solution for this problem. It has been found that combinations of organic UV-Absorbers and small amounts of transparent inorganic oxides, such as iron oxides, micronized titanium dioxide, zinc oxide, cerium oxide or carbon black<br>
 <br>
 <br>
show synergistic effects in terms of color stabilization after light exposure without essentially affecting the initial color.<br>
One aspect of the instant invention is a method for protecting cork or wood substrates from discoloration wherein the wood substrate is selected from the group consisting of beech, alder, meant, oak, cherry, teak, nut, redwood, mahogany, eucalyptus, American beech, durian, red cedar, leeched tree, champa, rubbenA/ood, Taiwan ash, camphor tree, zebra wood, macho, rosewood, rain tree and ironwood; comprising, applying to the cork or wood substrate a coating, which coating contains<br>
a)	an organic UV-absorber selected from the group consisting of the hydroxybenzophenone, hydroxyphenylbenzotriazole, oxanilide and hydroxyphenyltriazine UV-absorbers or mixtures thereof; and<br>
b)	an inorganic UV-absorber selected from the group consisting of transparent iron oxide, transparent titanium dioxide, transparent zinc oxide, transparent cerium oxide and carbon black or mixtures thereof; wherein<br>
the weight ratio of organic UV-absorber to inorganic UV-absorber is from 1000:1 to 10:1.<br>
For instance the substrate is selected from the group consisting of beech, alder, meant, oak, cherry, teak, nut redwood and mahogany.<br>
For example the substrate is cork or alder.<br>
Preferably the substrate is cork.<br>
Typically the substrate is in the form of a panel or board, which is used in indoor applications, such as flooring. It is, however, also possible to use it in outdoor applications.<br>
Preferably the inorganic UV-absorber is a transparent iron oxide or carbon black or a mixture thereof.<br>
The inorganic pigments may be present, for example, in the form of nano-particles.<br>
 <br>
The iron oxides typically have a yellow, red or brown shade. The crystal forms are typically of goethite, hematite structure or mixtures thereof. The particle size is typically 50-100 nm in length, 10-20 nm wide and 2-5 nm thick. The specific surfaces measured according to BET are usually higher than 60 m; / g.<br>
Alternatively titaniumdioxide may be used, preferably as retile structure.<br>
In general iron oxides are preferred.<br>
The transparent inorganic pigments are items of commerce. They are produced and sold for example under the trade name Sicotrans® by BASF, under the trade name Hombitec RM® by Sachtleben, under the Tradename Rhodigard® W 200, Rhodigard® S 100 by Rhoda and under the trade name ZinClear® by Advanced Powder Technology Pty Ltd.<br>

 <br>
<br>
 <br>
<br>
 <br>
Specific examples for oxamides are for example 4,4'-dioctyloxyoxanilJde, 2,2'-diethoxyoxanilide, 2,2'-dioctyloxy-5,5'-di-tert-butoxanilide, 2,2'-didodecyloxy-5,5'-di-tert-butoxanilide, 2-ethoxy-2'-ethyloxanilide, N,N'-bis(3-dimethylaminopropyl)oxamide, 2-ethoxy-5-tert-butyl-2'-ethoxanilide and its mixture with 2-ethoxy-2'-ethyl-5,4'-di-tert-butoxanilide, mixtures of o- and p-methoxy-disubstituted oxanilides and mixtures of o- and p-ethoxy-disubstituted oxanilides.<br>
The above mentioned UV-absorbers are largely items of commerce and for example known as Tinuvin® 109, 171, 326, 327, 328, 350, 360, 384, 400, 405, 411 or Chimassorb® 81 from Ciba Specialty Chemicals or Cyasorb® 1164 from Cytech Inc.<br>
In many cases it may be of advantage to use a combination of UV-absorbers from different classes, such as for example a benzophenone UV-absorber with a benzotriazole UV-absorber or a hydroxyphenyltriazine UV-absorber with a benzotriazole UV-absorber. If such a combination is used, the weight ratio between both UV-absorbers is for example from 1:5 to 5:1, for instanc from 1:3 to 3:1, particularly 1:1.5 to 1.5:1.<br>
When a water based coating is applied the organic UV-absorber is advantageously in the form of concentrated aqueous polymer dispersion with a particle size of less than 1000 nm, prepared by heterophase radical polymerization of ethylenically unsaturated monomers in the presence of the UV-absorber. Such preparations are, for example, described in WO 05/023878.<br>
Principally a variety of coatings may be applied, for example, those listed below:<br>
a)	Crosslinked polymers derived from aldehydes on the one hand and phenols, ureas and melamines on the other hand, such as phenol/formaldehyde resins, urea/formaldehyde re¬sins and melamine/formaldehyde resins.<br>
b)	Drying and non-drying alkyd resins.<br>
c)	Unsaturated polyester resins derived from copolyesters of saturated and unsaturated dicarboxylic acids with polyhydric alcohols and vinyl compounds as crosslinking agents, and also halogen-containing modifications thereof of low flammability.<br>
 <br>
c;;<br>
d)	Crosslinkable acrylic resins derived from substituted acrylates, for example epoxy acry-lates, urethane acrylates or polyester acrylates.<br>
e)	Alkyd resins, polyester resins and acrylate resins crosslinked with melamine resins, urea resins, isocyanates, isocyanurates, polyisocyanates or epoxy resins.<br>
f)	Crosslinked epoxy resins derived from aliphatic, cycloaliphatic, heterocyclic or aromatic glycidyl compounds, e.g. products of diglycidyl ethers of bisphenol A and bisphenol F, which are crosslinked with customary hardeners such as anhydrides or amines, with or without accelerators.<br>
In principal the coating is solvent based or water based and contains a binder, which is selected from the group consisting of alkyd resins, modified alkyd resins, alkyd urethane resins, alkyd silicone resins, autocrosslinking or non-autocrosslinking acrylic resins, polyester resins, drying oils, phenolic resins and nitrocellulose or mixtures thereof.<br>
Typical examples of organic solvents, which may suitably be used for the coating compositions are aliphatic, aromatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, alcohols, esters, ketones or chlorinated hydrocarbons.<br>
Water/solvent mixtures are typically mixtures of water and lower alcohols, glycols or glycol ethers.<br>
The coating may also be a radiation-curable, solvent-free formulation of photopolymerisable compounds. Illustrative examples are mixtures of acrylates or methacrylates, unsaturated polyester/styrene mixtures or mixtures of other ethylenically unsaturated monomers or oligomers.<br>
Preferably the coating is water based and contains an acrylic or methacrylic resin.<br>
For example the amount of organic UV-absorber is from 0.5% to 5%, in particular from 0.5% to 3% by weight based on the weight of the total binder formulation.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
For instance the amount of inorganic UV-absorber is from 0.002% to 0.5%, in particular from 0.01 to 0.3% by weight based on the weight of the total binder formulation.<br>
The coating can be applied to the cork or wood substrate by conventional techniques, for example by spreading, brushing, dipping, deluging or spraying.<br>
The coating may contain an additional stabilizer selected from the group consisting of a sterically hindered amine light stabilizer, a phosphite or phosphonite and sterically hindered phenolic antioxidant or mixtures thereof. Examples are given below<br>
