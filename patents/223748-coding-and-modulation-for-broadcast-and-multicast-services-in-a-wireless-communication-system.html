				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>Techniques for transmitting data in a wireless communication system are described. Physical channels to be sent in a super-frame are identified and allocated time slots in the super-frame. The coding and modulation for each physical channel are selected based on its capacity. The data for each physical channel is selectively encoded based on an outer code rate, e.g., for a Red-Solomon code, and further encoded based on an inner code rate, e.g., for a Turbo code. The encoded data for each physical channel is mapped to modulation symbols based on a selected modulation scheme. The modulation symbols for each physical channel are further processed (e.g., OFDM modulated) and multiplexed onto the time slots allocated to the physical channel. Data to be sent using another radio technology (e.g., W-CDMA) is also processed and multiplexed onto time slots allocated for this radio technology.</td>

I.        Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119<br>
[0OO1]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
Serial No. 60/577,083, entitled "FLO-TOD physical layer," filed June 4,2004, assigned to the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
I.	Field<br>
[0002]	The present invention relates generally to communication, and more specifically<br>
to techniques for transmitting data in a wireless communication system.<br>
II.	Background<br>
[0003]	Wireless communication systems are widely deployed to provide various<br>
communication services such as voice, packet data, multi-media broadcast, text messaging, and so on. These systems may be multiple-access systems capable of supporting communication for multiple users by sharing the available system resources. Examples of such multiple-access systems include Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) systems, Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) systems, Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) systems, and Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiple Access (OFDMA) systems. A CDMA system may implement Wideband CDMA (W-CDMA), cdma2000, and so on. W-CDMA is described in documents from a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project" (3GPP). cdma2000 is described in documents from a consortium named "3rd Generation Partnership Project 2" (3GPP2). 3GPP and 3GPP2 documents are publicly available.<br>
[0004]	W-CDMA and cdma2000 employ direct sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA), which<br>
spectrally spreads a narrowband signal over the entire system bandwidth with a spreading code. DS-CDMA has certain advantages such as ease of supporting multiple access, narrowband rejection, and so on. However, DS-CDMA is susceptible to frequency selective fading, which causes intersymbol interference (ISI). A complicated receiver with an equalizer may be needed to combat the intersymbol interference.<br><br>
WO 2005/122458	PCT/US2005/0J9529<br>
3<br>
[0005]	A   wireless   communication   system   may   send   multicast   and  broadcast<br>
transmissions that are variable in nature. A multicast transmission is a transmission sent to a group of terminals, and a broadcast transmission is a transmission sent to all terminals within a broadcast coverage area. For example, the multicast and broadcast transmissions may have variable data rates that change over time. Furthermore, the number of transmissions and/or the types of transmissions to be sent may change over time. For this system, it is challenging to allocate and utilize the available system resources for the transmissions in an efficient manner.<br>
[0006]	There is therefore a need in the art for techniques to send variable transmissions<br>
in a wireless communication system.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007]	Techniques for efficiently allocating system resources to physical channels and<br>
for processing and transmitting the physical channels in a wireless communication system are described herein. These techniques may be used for various types of transmissions such as unicast, multicast, and broadcast transmissions and for various services such as Enhanced Multimedia Broadcast/Multicast Service (E-MBMS).<br>
[0008]	According to an embodiment of the invention, an apparatus is described which<br>
includes a controller and a processor. The controller identifies at least one physical channel to be sent in a super-frame comprised of multiple time slots. The controller allocates at least two time slots in the super-frame to each physical channel and selects the coding and modulation for each physical channel, e.g., based on the capacity of the physical channel. The processor processes (e.g., encodes and modulates) the data for each physical channel based on the coding and modulation selected for that physical channel. The processor further multiplexes the processed data for each physical channel onto the at least two time slots allocated to that physical channel.<br>
[0009]	According to another embodiment, a method is provided in which at least one<br>
physical channel to be sent in a super-frame comprised of multiple time slots is identified. At least two time slots in the super-frame are allocated to each physical channel. Coding and modulation are selected for each physical channel. The data for each physical channel is processed based on the coding and modulation selected for that physical channel. The processed data for each physical channel is men multiplexed onto the at least two time slots allocated to that physical channel.<br><br>

[0010]	According to yet another embodiment, an apparatus is described which includes<br>
means for identifying at least one physical channel to be sent in a super-frame<br>
comprised of multiple time slots, means for allocating at least two time slots in the super-frame to each physical channel, means for selecting coding and modulation for each physical channel, means for processing the data for each physical channel based on the coding and modulation selected for that physical channel, and means for multiplexing the processed data for each physical channel onto the at least two time slots allocated to that physical channel.<br>
[0011]	According to yet another embodiment, an apparatus is described which includes<br>
a controller and a processor. The controller identifies at least one physical channel to be received in a super-frame comprised of multiple time slots. The controller determines at least two time slots allocated to each physical channel and also determines the coding and modulation used for each physical channel. The processor demultiplexes received data for each physical channel from the at least two time slots allocated to that physical channel. The processor further processes the received data for each physical channel based on the coding and modulation used for that physical channel.<br>
[0012]	According to yet another embodiment, a method is provided in which at least<br>
one physical channel to be received in a super-frame comprised of multiple time slots is identified. At least two time slots allocated to each physical channel are determined. The coding and modulation used for each physical channel are also determined. Received data for each physical channel is demultiplexed from the at least two time slots allocated to that physical channel. The received data for each physical channel is then processed based on the coding and modulation used for that physical channel.<br>
[0013]	According to yet another embodiment, an apparatus is described which includes<br>
means for identifying at least one physical channel to be received in a super-frame comprised of multiple time slots, means for determining at least two time slots allocated to each physical channel, means for determining the coding and modulation used for each physical channel, means for demultiplexing received data for each physical channel from the at least two time slots allocated to that physical channel, and means for processing the received data for each physical channel based on the coding and<br>
modulation used for that physical channel.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0026]	The word "exemplary" is used herein to mean "serving as an example, instance,<br>
or illustration." Any embodiment described herein as "exemplary" is not necessarily to be construed as preferred or advantageous over other embodiments.<br>
[0027]	FIG. 1 shows a wireless communication system 100 with multiple base stations<br>
110 and multiple terminals 120.    A base station is generally a fixed station that<br>
communicates with the terminals and may also be called a Node B, an access point, a<br>
base transceiver subsystem (BTS), or some other terminology. Each base station 110<br>
provides communication coverage for a particular geographic area. The term "cell" can<br>
refer to a base station and/or its coverage area depending on the context in which the<br>
term is used. Terminals 120 may be dispersed throughout the system. A terminal may<br>
be fixed or mobile and may also be called a mobile station, a wireless device, a user<br>
equipment, a user terminal, a subscriber unit, or some other terminology.   The terms<br>
"terminal" and "user" are used interchangeably herein.  A terminal may communicate<br>
with zero, one, or multiple base stations on the downlink and/or uplink at any given<br>
moment. The downlink (or forward link) refers to the communication link from the<br>
base stations to the terminals, and the uplink (or reverse link) refers to the<br>
communication link from the terminals to the base stations.<br>
[0028]	The transmission techniques described herein may be used for various radio<br>
technologies  such as W-CDMA,  cdma2000,  IS-856,  other versions  of CDMA,<br><br>
WO 2005/122458	PCT/US2005/019529<br>
6<br>
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM), Interleaved FDMA (IFDMA) (which is also called Distributed FDMA), Localized FDMA (LFDMA) (which is also called   Narrowband   FDMA   or   Classical   FDMA),   Global   System   for   Mobile<br>
Communications (GSM), direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), frequency hopping<br>
spread spectrum (FHSS), and so on. W-CDMA and cdma2000 utilize direct sequence<br>
CDMA (DS-CDMA), which spectrally spreads a narrowband signal over the entire<br>
system bandwidth.  OFDM, IFDMA, and LFDMA are multi-carrier radio technologies<br>
that effectively partition the overall system bandwidth into multiple (S) orthogonal<br>
frequency subbands.   These subbands are also called tones, subcarriers, bins, and<br>
frequency channels.  Each subband is associated with a respective subcarrier that may<br>
be modulated with data. OFDM transmits modulation symbols in the frequency domain<br>
on all or a subset of the S subbands. IFDMA transmits modulation symbols in the time<br>
domain on subbands that are uniformly distributed across the S subbands.  LFDMA<br>
transmits modulation symbols in the time domain and typically on adjacent subbands.<br>
The use of OFDM for unicast, multicast, and broadcast transmissions may also be<br>
considered as different radio technologies. The list of radio technologies given above is<br>
not exhaustive, and the transmission techniques may also be used for other radio<br>
technologies not mentioned above.    For clarity, the transmission techniques are<br>
specifically described below for W-CDMA and OFDM.<br>
[0029]	FIG. 2 shows an exemplary 4-tier super-frame structure 200 that may be used to<br>
transmit data, pilot, and signaling in system 100.   The transmission time line is<br>
partitioned into super-frames, with each super-frame having a predetermined time<br>
duration, e.g., approximately one second.  For the embodiment shown in FIG. 2, each<br>
super-frame includes (1) a header field for a time division multiplexed (TDM) pilot and<br>
overhead/control information and (2) a data field for traffic data and a frequency<br>
division multiplexed (FDM) pilot  The TDM pilot may be used for synchronization,<br>
e.g., super-frame detection, frequency error estimation, and timing acquisition.   The<br>
TDM and FDM pilots may be used for channel estimation. The overhead information<br>
for each super-frame may convey various parameters for the transmissions sent in that<br>
super-frame, e.g., the time slots and the coding and modulation used for each<br>
transmission.<br>
[0030]	The data field of each super-frame is partitioned into K equal-size outer-frames<br>
to facilitate data transmission, where K &gt; 1.   Each outer-frame is partitioned into N frames, and each frame is further partitioned into T time slots, where N &gt; 1 and T &gt; 1.<br><br>
WO 2t&gt;05/l 22458	PCT/US2005/019529<br>
7<br>
	Each outer-frame thus includes M = N-T time slots that are assigned indices of 1<br>
through M. In general, a super-frame may include any number of outer-frames, frames,<br>
and time slots. The super-frame, outer-frame, frame, and time slot may also be referred<br>
to by some other terminology.<br>
[0031]		FIG. 3 shows an exemplary multiplexing of W-CDMA and OFDM in a frame<br>
for a time division duplexed (TDD) system. In general, each time slot in the frame may<br>
be used for either the downlink (DL) or uplink (UL). A time slot used for the downlink<br>
is called a downlink slot, and a time slot used for the uplink is called an uplink slot.<br>
Any radio technology (e.g., W-CDMA or OFDM) may be used for each time slot. A<br>
time slot used for W-CDMA is called a W-CDMA slot, and a time slot used for OFDM<br>
is called an OFDM slot. A time slot used for the downlink with OFDM is called an E-<br>
MBMS slot. For the example shown in FIG. 3, time slot 1 is a downlink W-CDMA<br>
slot, time slots 2 through 6 are E-MBMS slots, time slot 7 is an uplink W-CDMA slot,<br>
and time slot 8 through 15 are E-MBMS slots. For each downlink W-CDMA slot, data<br>
for one or more physical channels may be channelized with different orthogonal (e.g.,<br>
OVSF) sequences, spectrally spread with scrambling codes, combined in the time<br>
domain, and transmitted across the entire W-CDMA slot. For each E-MBMS slot, L<br>
OFDM symbols may be generated for the data to be sent in that E-MBMS slot, where<br>
L &gt; 1. For example, three OFDM symbols may be sent in each E-MBMS slot, and each<br>
OFDM symbol may have a duration of about 220 microseconds (us).<br>
[0032]		For a frequency division duplexed (FDD) system that supports W-CDMA and<br>
OFDM, the downlink and uplink are transmitted simultaneously on separate frequency<br>
bands. Each time slot on the downlink may be used for W-CDMA or OFDM.<br>
[0033]		FIGS. 2 and 3 show an exemplary super-frame structure.   The transmission<br>
techniques described herein may be used with other super-frame structures and for<br>
systems utilizing other radio technologies.<br>
[0034]		Table 1 shows three exemplary frame designs for the super-frame structure<br>
shown in FIGS. 2 and 3. For these frame designs, the header field for the TDM pilot and overhead information is 40 milliseconds (ms), each super-frame includes four outer-frames (K = 4), fee frames and time slots conform to W-CDMA, and two time slots in each frame are reserved for W-CDMA. For W-CDMA, each frame has a duration of 10 ms and includes 15 time slots (T=15), each time slot has a duration of 0.667 ms and includes 2560 chips, and each chip has a duration of 0.26 microseconds (ms) for a<br><br>
WO 2005/122458	PCT/US2005/01952!)<br>
8<br>
system bandwidth of 3.84 MHz. The number of time slots per outer-frame (M) is equal to the number of time slots per frame (T) times the number of frames per outer-frame (N), or M = T x N. The maximum number of E-MBMS slots per outer-frame (V) is equal to the maximum number of E-MBMS slots per frame (13) times the number of frames per outer-frame (N), or V = 13 x N. Other frame designs with other values for K, N, T, M and V may also be used and are within the scope of the invention.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
[0035]	Each outer-frame includes M time slots that may be used for W-CDMA and<br>
OFDM, as shown in FIG. 2. Zero, one, or multiple time slots (e.g., two time slots in each frame) may be reserved for W-CDMA. The unreserved time slots may be allocated to W-CDMA and OFDM in various manners and based on various factors such as system loading, usage requirements, and so on.<br>
[0036]	FIG. 4 shows an embodiment for allocating time slots in a super-frame for E-<br>
MBMS. For this embodiment, each time slot that is not reserved for W-CDMA may be used as an E-MBMS slot. For the example shown in FIG. 4, two time slots in frame 1 of outer-frame 1 are allocated for E-MBMS, one time slot in frame 2 is allocated for E-MBMS, and so on, and three time slots in frame N are allocated for E-MBMS. The E-MBMS slots in each outer-frame may be assigned sequential indices 1 through Q, where Q is the number of E-MBMS slots in one outer-frame. The unreserved time slots may also be allocated for E-MBMS in other manners. For example, the N frames in each outer-frame of a given super-frame may contain the same set of E-MBMS slots so that each frame contains E-MBMS slots at the same slot indices. The number of E-MBMS<br><br>
WO 2005/122458	PCT/US2005/019529<br>
9<br>
slots in each outer-frame (Q) is then equal to the number of E-MBMS slots per frame<br>
(G) times the number of frames per outer-frame (N), or Q = G x N .<br>
[0037]	The system may define physical channels to facilitate transmission of data.   A<br>
physical channel is a means for sending data at a physical layer and may also be called a physical layer channel, a traffic channel, a transmission channel, and so on. A physical channel that is transmitted on the downlink using OFDM is called an E-MBMS physical channel. E-MBMS physical channels may be used to send various types of data (e.g., multicast data, broadcast data, control data, and so on) and may be used for various services (e.g., E-MBMS). A given E-MBMS physical channel may or may not be transmitted in a given super-frame.<br>
[0038]	In an embodiment, an E-MBMS physical channel that is transmitted in a given<br>
super-frame is allocated at least one time slot in at least one frame of each outer-frame in the super-frame. For this embodiment, the E-MBMS physical channel has the same slot and frame allocation for all K outer-frames of the super-frame. For example, the E-MBMS physical channel may be allocated time slot t in frame n of each outer-frame in the super-frame. In this example, the E-MBMS physical channel is allocated a total of K time slots that are evenly spaced apart by M time slots. For this embodiment, an E-MBMS physical channel is allocated an integer multiple of a minimum slot allocation. This minimum slot allocation is one time slot in each outer-frame of a super-frame. If the E-MBMS physical channel is allocated multiple times the minimum slot allocation, then the multiple time slots in each outer-frame may be adjacent to one another or distributed across the outer-frame.<br>
[0039]	The slot allocation embodiment described above provides various advantages.<br>
First, time diversity is achieved since the time slots allocated to an E-MBMS physical channel are distributed across a super-frame and are separated by M time slots. Second, the allocation of time slots to E-MBMS physical channels is simplified because of the structured manner in which time slots are allocated to E-MBMS physical channels. Third, the slot allocation may be conveyed with a small amount of overhead information. Fourth, the allocation of an entire time slot to one E-MBMS physical channel simplifies processing (e.g., coding and modulation) at a base station and a terminal for the E-MBMS physical channel. However, the time slots may also be allocated to E-MBMS physical channels in other manners (e.g., multiple E-MBMS physical channels may<br>
share one time slot or one OFDM symbol), and this is within the scope of the invention.<br><br>
WO 2005/122458	PCT/US2005/019529<br>

[0040]	In an embodiment, an E-MBMS physical channel that is sent in a given super-<br>
frame is processed based on the coding and modulation selected for that E-MBMS physical channel for the super-frame. The coding and modulation for the E-MBMS physical channel remains constant for the entire duration of the super-frame but can change from super-frame to super-frame.<br>
[0041]	In an embodiment, an E-MBMS physical channel has a configurable capacity<br>
that can change from super-frame to super-frame. The capacity of the E-MBMS physical channel is determined by (1) the number of time slots allocated to the E-MBMS physical channel and (2) the number of information bits that can be sent on the E-MBMS physical channel in one super-frame with the minimum slot allocation. The configurable capacity may be used to support variable rate coders/decoders (codecs) (e.g., audio codecs, video codecs, and so on) used to encode raw data to generate the information bits for the E-MBMS physical channel. The configurable capacity may also be used to trade off between the amount of data that can be sent for a broadcast transmission versus the coverage for the broadcast transmission.<br>
[0042]	In an embodiment, one transport block is sent on an E-MBMS physical channel<br>
in a super-frame for the minimum slot allocation. The size of the transport block is configurable and affects the capacity of the E-MBMS physical channel. The coding and modulation are selected such that the transport block can be sent in the time slots for the minimum slot allocation. Multiple transport blocks may be sent on the E-MBMS physical channel in the super-frame if the E-MBMS physical channel is allocated multiple times the minimum slot allocation.<br>

one E-MBMS physical channel in one super-frame. The processing of the transport block is described below with reference to both FIGS. 5 and 6.<br>
[0045 ]	Transport block 610 may be encoded with an outer block code, such as an (n, A:)<br>
Reed-Solomon code, (block 512) to generate an outer-encoded block 612 containing data and parity. The block coding may be selectively performed. Outer-encoded block 612 simply contains the data in transport block 610 if the block coding is omitted. The outer code rate is R0=k/n, where k and n are parameters of the outer code. A cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value is generated (block 514) based on the data and parity in<br><br>
WO 2005/122458	PCT/US2005/019529<br>
11<br>
outer-encoded block 612 and attached to the outer-encoded block to form a formatted block 614. The CRC value is used by a terminal to check whether the transport block is decoded correctly or in error. Other error detection codes may also be used instead ofCRC.<br>
0046]		Formatted block 614 may be partitioned (block 516) into one or multiple equal-<br>
sized code blocks, e.g., two code blocks 616a and 616b in FIG. 6. Each code block 616<br>
is then encoded with an inner code (block 518) to generate an encoded block 618. The inner code may be a Turbo code, a convolutional code, a low-density parity check (LDPC) code, some other code, or a combination thereof. The inner code may have a fixed code rate of 1 / Rb and may generate Rb, code bits for each input bit. For example,<br>
the inner code may be a rate 1/3 Turbo code that generates three code bits for each input bit. Rate matching (e.g., puncturing) is then performed (block 520) in accordance with rate matching parameters provided by higher layer to retain the desired number of code bits for each encoded block and to discard the remaining code bits. The inner code rate Ri is determined by the fixed code rate and the rate matching. The retained code bits for each encoded block are scrambled (block 522) with a pseudo-random number (PN) sequence to randomize the bits. The randomized bits for each encoded block are then interleaved or reordered (block 524) to generate a processed block 624. The interleaving provides time diversity.<br>
[0047]	Processed blocks 624a and 624b are then partitioned into K output blocks, e.g.,<br>
four output blocks 626a, 626b, 626c, and 626d in FIG. 6, one output block for each outer-frame. The four output blocks are mapped to the E-MBMS physical channel (block 526). The bits in each output block are mapped to modulation symbols based on a modulation scheme selected for the E-MBMS physical channel. The symbol mapping may be achieved by (1) grouping sets of 5 bits to form 5-bit binary values, where 5 = 2 for QPSK, 5 = 4 for 16-QAM, and 5 = 6 for 64-QAM, and (2) mapping each 5-bit binary value to a point in a signal constellation for the selected modulation scheme. The four blocks of modulation symbols are transmitted in four time slots allocated to the E-MBMS physical channel in four outer-frames.<br>
[0048]	The transmission of a transport block in K (e.g., four) time slots that are evenly<br>
distributed across a super-frame can provide time diversity. The transmission time interval (TTT) for the transport block is one super-frame, which may be approximately one second. This TTI is typically much longer than the coherence time interval of a<br><br>
WO 2005/122458								PCT7US2005/01952<br>
12<br>
wireless channel. Hence, the transport block is spread over multiple coherence time intervals and is likely to observe different channel conditions. The transmission of the transport block in K bursts across the super-frame facilitates data reception and may reduce battery power consumption. A terminal may wake up periodically to receive a burst in each outer-frame and may sleep between bursts to conserve battery power. Each burst is sent in one time slot and may be as short as 0.667 ms. In contrast, a transport block may be sent continuously in a TTI of 80 ms for W-CDMA. The shorter TTI for W-CDMA results in less time diversity. Furthermore, the continuous transmission of the transport block in W-CDMA may result in higher battery consumption since a terminal is awake for the entire TTI of 80 ms (which is much longer than 4x0.667 ms) to receive the transport block.<br>
[0049]	In an embodiment, the transport block size for an E-MBMS physical channel is<br>
configurable and given in number of information bits. The number of modulation symbols that can be sent on the E-MBMS physical channel for the minimum slot allocation may be fixed by system design. For each transport block size, the coding and modulation are selected such mat all of the information bits in the transport block can be sent in the modulation symbols available for the minimum slot allocation.<br>
[005O]	Each transport block size is associated with a spectral efficiency that may be<br>
given in units of information bits per modulation symbol. The spectral efficiency (Seff) is approximately equal to the outer code rate (R0) times the inner code rate (Ri) times the number of bits per modulation symbols (E), or Stsf=R0-Rl-B = R-B, where R is the overall code rate and is the product of the outer code rate and the inner code rate, or R = RoR.. The approximation in the spectral efficiency is due to the fact that the CRC<br>
is not taken into account.<br>
[0051]	The coding and modulation may be performed in various manners.   In an<br>
embodiment, a set of code rates is supported for the outer code, and one of the supported outer code rates is selected for each transport block. The supported outer code rates may include an outer code rate of 1.0, which means that the outer code is omitted. A set of modulation schemes is also supported, and one of the supported modulation schemes is selected for each transport block. For a given transport block size, an inner code rate and a modulation scheme are selected for each outer code rate so that the transport block can be sent in the available modulation symbols.<br><br>
WO 2005/122458	PCT/US2005/019529<br>
13<br>
[0052]	The system may support a set of transport block (TB) formats, which may also<br>
be referred to as modes, rates, transport block sizes, and so on. Each supported TB format may be associated with a specific data rate, a specific spectral efficiency, a specific inner code rate, a specific modulation scheme, a specific transport block size, and a specific number of code blocks. The outer code rate may be specified independently. The outer code rate selection influences the parameters for the TB format such as the inner code rate, the modulation scheme, and the number of code blocks.<br>
[00531	Table 2 shows an exemplary set of TB formats for frame design 2 in Table 1.<br>
Table 2 assumes that the minimum slot allocation is four time slots in a super-frame. Table 2 further assumes that 2331 modulation symbols can be sent in each time slot, e.g., 777 modulation symbols/OFDM symbol x three OFDM symbols/time slot. This may be achieved by a design with 1024 total subbands, 136 guard subbands, 888 usable subbands, 128 pilot subbands distributed across the 1024 total subbands, 777 usable data subbands, and 111 usable pilot subbands. The supported outer code rates are (16, 16), (16,14), and (16,12), and the supported modulation schemes are QPSK, 16-QAM, and 64-QAM. For each transport block size, an inner code rate and a modulation scheme are selected for each different outer code rate to achieve the desired spectral efficiency for that transport block size. For a given transport block size and modulation scheme, the inner code rate increases as the outer code rate decreases.<br>

[0054]	Table 3 shows an exemplary set of TB formats for frame design 3 in Table 1.<br>
Table 3<br><br>
[0055]	Tables 2 and 3 show some exemplary TB formats and outer code rates.   In<br>
general, any number of TB formats and outer code rates may be used. A TB format may also be associated with any set of parameters.<br>
[0056]	A Turbo code and an (n, k) Reed Solomon code may be employed as the inner<br>
code and the outer code, respectively, to capture time diversity and improve performance. In theory, it is preferable to perform Turbo coding over an entire TO, which is one super-frame for an E-MBMS physical channel. The Turbo code may be<br><br>

15<br>
used alone without the outer code and, with sufficient interleaving, is capable of<br>
exploiting the time diversity in the system. However, from a practical point of view,<br>
there are typically restrictions imposed by the decoder buffer size. In these cases, the<br>
length of Turbo coded blocks/packets may be limited (e.g., to approximately 5000 bits),<br>
and time diversity may be collected with the outer code. The outer code may or may<br>
not be used for any given E-MBMS physical channel in any given super-frame. A<br>
primary role of the outer code is to assist in collecting time diversity. Collecting time<br>
diversity is further facilitated by the super-frame structure shown in FIG. 2 since a<br>
transport block is sent in K bursts that are distributed over an entire super-frame and<br>
hence has a relatively long TTI. <br>
|0057]		FIG. 7 shows transmission of transport blocks with different sizes on two E-<br>
MBMS physical channels x and y in one super-frame. For the example shown in FIG.<br>
7, a small transport block (e.g., with 1000 bits) is sent on E-MBMS physical channel x<br>
and is encoded based on the outer and inner code rates applicable for this transport<br>
block to generate a single encoded block. This encoded block is further processed and<br>
modulated based on the applicable modulation scheme (e.g., QPSK) to generate four<br>
output blocks, which are sent in four time slots allocated to E-MBMS physical channel<br>
x. A larger transport block (e.g., with 4000 bits) is sent on E-MBMS physical channel y<br>
and is encoded based on the outer and inner code rates applicable for this transport<br>
block to generate two encoded blocks. These encoded blocks are further processed and<br>
modulated based on the applicable modulation scheme (e.g., 64-QAM) to generate four<br>
output blocks, which are sent in four time slots allocated to E-MBMS physical channel<br>
y. As shown in FIG. 7, different capacities are achieved for E-MBMS physical channels<br>
x and y even though both E-MBMS physical channels are allocated the minimum<br>
number of time slots.<br>
[0058]		The coding and modulation design described herein allows different data rates or<br>
transport block sizes to be used for an E-MBMS physical channel for the minimum slot allocation, as shown in FIG. 7. This flexible capacity allows the E-MBMS physical channel to support variable codec rates for multi-media data sent on the E-MBMS physical channel. This flexible capacity also allows for a tradeoff between source rate and coverage for the minimum slot allocation. The coding and modulation design also maintains a constant data rate for the E-MBMS physical channel regardless of (1) whether or not the outer code is used and (2) the selected outer code rate. The constant data rate simplifies the allocation of system resources to streams at a higher layer. The<br><br>
WO 2005/122458	PCT7US2005/019529<br>
16<br>
	outer code may optionally be used to collect time diversity.  A small number of outer<br>
code rates may be supported to simplify the block coding.<br>
[0059]		Tables 2 and 3 and FIGS. 5 and 6 show a specific embodiment for performing<br>
	coding and modulation. The coding and modulation may also be performed in other<br>
manners. For example, a transport block may be partitioned into K code blocks that<br>
may be sent in K time slots for K outer-frames of a super-frame, one code block in each<br>
time slot. The information bits for the transport block may be sent in code block 1 and<br>
possibly code block 2. Each remaining code block may contain additional redundancy<br>
information. A terminal observing good channel conditions may be able to decode the<br>
transport block based on fewer than K code blocks, and may be able to go to sleep until<br>
the next super-frame. For outer code rate (16,12), the parity bits generated by the block<br>
code may be sent in the last code block, which is transmitted in the last outer-frame.<br>
The terminal does not need to receive this code block if the transport block is already<br>
decoded correctly and can sleep through the last outer-frame.<br>
[006O]		In an embodiment, an E-MBMS physical channel may be transmitted with or<br>
without layered coding, which is commonly called hierarchical coding. Layered coding may be used to send a base stream and an enhancement stream on one E-MBMS physical channel.   The base stream may carry information intended for all terminals within a broadcast coverage area, and the enhancement stream may carry additional information intended for terminals observing better channel conditions.  With layered coding, the base stream is encoded based on the outer and inner code rates selected for the base stream, and the enhancement stream is encoded based on the outer and inner code rates selected for the enhancement stream. The encoded data for the two streams may be independently mapped to modulation symbols, which may be appropriately scaled and combined to generate output symbols for transmission on the E-MBMS physical channel.  Alternatively, the encoded data for the two streams may be jointly mapped to modulation symbols based on a signal constellation for a joint modulation scheme. In any case, the resultant symbols are sent on the E-MBMS physical channel. The base stream is typically sent using more transmit power and/or more robust outer and inner code rates to allow for reception by all terminals. The enhancement stream may be sent using less transmit power and/or less robust outer and inner code rates.  A terminal can process a received signal and recover the base stream sent on the E-MBMS physical channel.   The terminal can then estimate the interference due to the base<br><br>
WO 2005/122458	PCT/US2005/019529<br>
17<br>
	stream, subtract the estimated interference from the received signal, and process the<br>
interference-canceled signal to recover the enhancement stream.<br>
[0061]		FIG. 8 shows a process 800 for transmitting data in a super-frame.  E-MBMS<br>
physical channels to be sent in the super-frame are initially identified (block 812). Time<br>
slots in the super-frame are allocated to the E-MBMS physical channels (block 814).<br>
Each E-MBMS physical channel may be allocated an integer multiple of the minimum<br>
slot allocation, which may be K time slots for K outer-frames of the super-frame. The<br>
capacity or transport block size for each E-MBMS physical channel is determined, e.g.,<br>
based on the amount of data to send and/or the desired coverage for the E-MBMS<br>
physical channel (block 816). The coding and modulation for each E-MBMS physical<br>
channel are selected based on the transport block size for the E-MBMS physical channel<br>
(block 818).<br>
[0062]		The data for each E-MBMS physical channel is processed based on the coding<br>
and modulation selected for the physical channel.    This processing may include<br>
selectively encoding the data for each E-MBMS physical channel based on an outer<br>
code rate, e.g., for a Reed-Solomon code (block 820), and further encoding the outer-<br>
encoded data based on an inner code rate, e.g., for a Turbo code, to generate encoded<br>
data for the E-MBMS physical channel (block 822). The outer code rate and the inner<br>
code rate for each E-MBMS physical channel are determined by the overall code rate<br>
for the E-MBMS physical channel.   The encoded data for each E-MBMS physical<br>
channel is mapped to modulation symbols based on a modulation scheme for the E-<br>
MBMS physical channel (block 824).   The modulation symbols for each E-MBMS<br>
physical channel are further processed (e.g., OFDM modulated) and multiplexed onto<br>
the time slots allocated to the E-MBMS physical channel (block 826). Data to be sent<br>
using another radio technology (e.g., W-CDMA) is also processed (e.g., encoded,<br>
interleaved, and modulated) (block 828) and multiplexed onto time slots allocated for<br>
this radio technology (block 830).<br>
[0063]		FIG. 9 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of base station 110 and<br>
terminal 120. At base station 110, a transmit (TX) data processor 910 receives and processes traffic data to be sent with W-CDMA and generates encoded data for W-CDMA.   A W-CDMA modulator 912 processes the W-CDMA encoded data and<br>
generates a W-CDMA waveform for each W-CDMA slot The processing by W-CDMA modulator 912 includes (1) mapping the encoded data for each W-CDMA physical channel to modulation symbols, (2) channelizing the modulation symbols for<br><br>

each physical channel with an orthogonal sequence, (3) scrambling the channelized symbols for each physical channel with a scrambling code, and (4) scaling and summing the scrambled data for all physical channels. A TX data processor 920 receives and processes traffic data to be sent using OFDM and generates data and pilot symbols. Data processor 920 may be implemented as shown in FIG. 5. An OFDM modulator 922 performs OFDM modulation on the data and pilot symbols, generates OFDM symbols, and forms an OFDM waveform for each E-MBMS slot. A multiplexer (Mux) 924 multiplexes W-CDMA waveforms onto W-CDMA slots, multiplexes OFDM waveforms onto E-MBMS slots, and provides an output signal. A transmitter unit (TMTR) 926 conditions (e.g., converts to analog, filters, amplifies, and frequency upconverts) the output signal and generates a modulated signal that is transmitted from an antenna 928.<br>
[0064]		At terminal 120, an antenna 952 receives the modulated signal transmitted by<br>
base station 110 and provides a received signal to a receiver unit (RCVR) 954. Receiver unit 954 conditions, digitizes, and processes the received signal and provides a stream of samples to a demultiplexer (Demux) 956. Demultiplexer 956 provides samples in W-CDMA slots to a W-CDMA demodulator (Demod) 960 and provides samples in E-MBMS slots to an OFDM demodulator 970. W-CDMA demodulator 960 processes the received samples in a manner complementary to the processing by W-CDMA modulator 912 and provides symbol estimates. A receive (RX) data processor 962 processes (e.g., demodulates, deinterleaves, and decodes) the symbol estimates and provides decoded data for W-CDMA. OFDM demodulator 970 performs OFDM demodulation on the received samples and provides data symbol estimates. An RX data processor 972 processes the data symbol estimates and provides decoded data for OFDM. In general, the processing at terminal 120 is complementary to the processing at base station 110.<br>
[0065]	Controllers 930 and 980 direct the operation at base station 110 and terminal<br>
120, respectively. Memory units 932 and 982 store program codes and data used by controllers 930 and 980, respectively. Controller 930 and/or a scheduler 934 allocates time slots for the downlink and uplink, determines whether to use W-CDMA or OFDM for each time slot, and allocates time slots to E-MBMS physical channels. Controller 930 also generates various controls to direct the coding and modulation for the E-MBMS physical channels.<br><br>

[00661		FIG. 10 shows a block diagram of an embodiment of W-CDMA TX data<br>
 	 processor 910.  Data for each transport channel (TrCH) is provided in transport blocks<br>
to a respective processing section 1010.   Within each section 1010, a CRC value is<br>
generated for each transport block and attached to the transport block (block 1012).<br>
CRC encoded blocks are serially concatenated and then partitioned into equal-sized<br>
code blocks (block 1014). Each code block is encoded with a coding scheme (e.g., a<br>
convolutional code or a Turbo code) or not encoded at all (block 1016).  Radio frame<br>
equalisation may be performed to pad the input bit sequence so that the output can be<br>
segmented into an integer number of data segments of equal size (block 1018). The bits<br>
are then interleaved across 1, 2, 4 or 8 (10 ms) radio frames to provide time diversity<br>
(block 1020). The interleaved bits are segmented and mapped onto 10 ms TrCH radio<br>
frames (block 1022). Rate matching is then performed on the bits in accordance with<br>
rate matching parameters provided by higher layer (block 1024).<br>
[0067]			The TrCH radio  frames  from  all  processing  sections   1010  are   serially<br>
multiplexed into a coded composite transport channel (CCTrCH) (block 1032).   Bit<br>
scrambling is then performed to randomize the bits (block 1034).   If more than one<br>
physical channel is used, then the bits are segmented among the physical channels<br>
(block 1036). The bits in each radio frame for each physical channel are interleaved to<br>
provide additional time diversity (block 1038).  The interleaved physical channel radio<br>
	frames are then mapped to the proper physical channels (block 1040).<br>

switch 1122 is in the 'up' position. Then, for each input bit in a code block, adder 1124<br>
performs modulo-2 addition of the input bit with the output bit from adder 1128c and<br>
provides the result to delay element 1126a. Adder 1128a performs modulo-2 addition<br>
of the bits from adder 1124 and delay element 1126a. Adder 1128b performs modulo-2<br>
addition of the bits from adder 1128a and delay element 1126c and provides parity bit z.<br>
Adder 1126c performs modulo-2 addition of the bits from delay elements 1126b and<br>
1126c. After all input bits in the code block have been encoded, switch 1122 is moved<br>
to the 'down' position and three zero (0) bits are provided to constituent encoder 1120a,<br>
Constituent encoder 1120a then encodes the three zero bits and provides three tail<br>
systematic bits and three tail parity bits.<br>

input bits x, the first three tail systematic bits, W parity bits z, and the first three tail<br>

ABSTRACT<br>
"CODING AND MODULATION FOR BROADCAST AND MULTICAST SERVICES IN A WIRELESS COMMUNICATION SYSTEM"<br>
Techniques for transmitting data in a wireless communication system are described. Physical channels to be sent in a super-frame are identified and allocated time slots in the super-frame. The coding and modulation for each physical channel are selected based on its capacity. The data for each physical channel is selectively encoded based on an outer code rate, e.g., for a Reed-Solomon code, and further encoded based on an inner code rate, e.g., for a Turbo code. The encoded data for each physical channel is mapped to modulation symbols based on a selected modulation scheme. The modulation symbols for each physical channel are further processed (e.g., OFDM modulated) and multiplexed onto the time slots allocated to the physical channel. Data to be sent using another radio technology (e.g., W-CDMA) is also processed and multiplexed onto time slots allocated for this radio technology.<br></td>
