HAIR CARE COMPOSITIONS<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
5  This invention relates to hair care compositions, in<br>
particular rinse-off hair care compositions such as shampoos and conditioners, which incorporate water-soluble nonionic polymers.<br>
10  BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
Rinse-off hair care compositions typically comprise one or more surfactants for cleansing purposes and one or more conditioning agents, so as to provide a combination of <br>
15  cleansing and conditioning to the hair. Typically, these conditioning agents are water-insoluble oily materials, cationic polymers or cationic surfactants.<br>
A problem associated with such rinse-off hair care <br>
20  compositions is that for many consumers they do not provide a sufficient level of "wet" sensory benefits, such as improved hair feel during washing.<br>
The present inventors have found that a combination of <br>
25	certain water-soluble nonionic polymers improves wet sensory benefits significantly when they are incorporated into rinse-off hair care compositions such as shampoos. Compositions of the invention also show a surprising improvement in ease of rinsing.<br>

Water-soluble nonionic polymers have been described for example in W099/44568, which relates to the use of water-soluble nonionic polyethyleneoxide homopolymers to increase hair body and fullness when formulated in a high pH medium <br>
5  	and applied to fine hair. The described polymers have<br>
molecular weights ranging from 100,000 (PEG-2M) to 5,000,000 (PEG-115M), preferably 300,000 (PEG-7M). They are said to deposit under the hair cuticle and provide it with more surface roughness and texture.<br>

15  SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a hair care composition comprising a water-soluble, nonionic polymer of ethylene oxide and a water-soluble, nonionic cellulose ether. <br>
20<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Water-Soluble, Nonionic Polymer of Ethylene Oxide<br>
25  The hair care composition of the invention comprises a water-soluble, nonionic polymer of ethylene oxide.<br>
As used herein, "water-soluble" refers to any material that is sufficiently soluble in water to form a clear or<br>
30  translucent solution to the naked eye at a concentration of 1.0% or more by weight of the material in water at 25CC.<br><br>
WO 2006/010440<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/007237<br><br>
-   4   -<br>
Suitable polymers of ethylene oxide for use in the hair care compositions of the invention are linear homopolymers of ethylene oxide characterised by the general formula:<br>
5	H(OCH2CH2)n OH<br>
These materials are generally termed polyethyleneoxides (or alternatively, polyoxyethylenes, or polyethylene glycols).<br>
10  In the above general formula, n has an average value of at least 2000, preferably from 2,000 to 235,000 more preferably from 45,000 to 185,000, most preferably from 130,000 to 185,000.<br>
15  Suitably, the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the<br>
polymer of ethylene oxide ranges from 100,000 to 10 million daltons, preferably from 1 million to 10 million daltons, more preferably from 6 million to 10 million daltons, most preferably from 7 million to 8 million daltons.<br>
20<br>
As used herein, the weight average molecular weight (Mw) of a polymer is the summation of the number of polymer molecules and the squared sum of the individual polymer molecules' molecular weight, divided by the summation of the number of<br>
25  polymer molecules and the sum of the individual polymer molecules' molecular weight.<br>
The Mw of polyethyleneoxides corresponding to the above<br>
general formula can be determined by measuring their <br>
30  intrinsic viscosity in water at 30° C. The intrinsic viscosity, [n], is correlated to the Mw of the<br><br>
WO 2006/010440<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/007237<br><br>
-   5   -<br>
polyethyleneoxide, and can be expressed by the following equation: [n] =1.25xl0-4 Mw0.78<br>
Examples of commercially available polyethyleneoxides <br>
5  	suitable for use in the hair care compositions of the invention include, but are not limited to, those polyethyleneoxides which are sold under the tradenames POLYOX® and UCARFLOC®, and which are available from the Amerchol Corporation or its associated companies.<br>
10<br>
Specific examples of such polyethyleneoxides include POLYOX® WSR-N10 which has a Mw of 100,000 daltons; POLYOX® WSR-N80 which has a Mw of 200,000 daltons; POLYOX® WSR-N750 which has a Mw of 300,000 daltons; POLYOX® WSR-N3000 which has a M„ of<br>
15  400,000 daltons; POLYOX® WSR-205 which has a Mw of 600,000 daltons;  POLYOX® WSR-N12K which has a Mw of 1 million daltons; POLYOX® WSR-301 which has a Mw of 4 million daltons; POLYOX® WSR-303 which has a Mw of 7 million daltons; POLYOX® WSR-308 which has a Mw of 8 million daltons; UCARFLOC®<br>
20  Polymer 304 which has a Mw of 7 million daltons; UCARFLOC® Polymer 309 which has a Mw of 8 million daltons; UCARFLOC® Polymer 310 which has a Mw of 10 million daltons; and mixtures thereof.<br>
25  Of the above polyethyleneoxides, preferred are those<br>
materials with an Mw of at least 6 million daltons, more preferably from 6 million to 10 million daltons, most preferably from 7 million to 8 million daltons.<br>
30  The total amount of water-soluble, nonionic polymer of ethylene oxide (as described above) in hair care<br><br>
WO 2006/010440<br><br>
»CT/EP2005/007237<br><br>
-   6   -<br>
compositions of the invention generally ranges from 0.001 to 1%, preferably from 0.01 to 0.25%, more preferably from 0.02 to 0.2% by total weight polymer of ethylene oxide based on the total weight of the composition. Higher levels than this<br>
5  	are preferably avoided since this can impart an undesirably stringy or slimy feel to the composition.<br>
Water-Soluble, Nonionic Cellulose Ether<br>
10  The hair care composition of the invention comprises a water-soluble, nonionic cellulose ether.<br>
By "water-soluble" is meant any material that is sufficiently soluble in water to form a clear solution to <br>
15  	the naked eye at a concentration of 1.0% or more by weight of the material in water at 25°C, as described above.<br>
Preferred water-soluble nonionic cellulose ethers are methylcellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose. These<br>
20  materials are manufactured by heating cellulose fibres with caustic solution which in turn is treated with methyl chloride, yielding the methyl ether of cellulose. Methylcellulose is made using only methyl chloride. For hydroxypropyl methylcellulose, propylene oxide is used in<br>
25  addition to methyl chloride to obtain hydroxypropyl<br>
substitution on the anhydroglucose units. This substituent group, -OCH2CH(OH)-CH3, contains a secondary hydroxyl on the number two carbon. The amount of substituent groups on the<br>
anhydroglucose units influences the solubility properties of<br>
30  	the cellulose ether. Accordingly, suitable methylcelluloses and hydroxypropyl methylcelluloses for use in the hair care<br><br>

PCT/EP2005/007237<br><br>
-  7   -<br>
composition of the invention have a sufficient degree of methoxyl or methoxyl/hydroxypropyl substitution to cause them to be water-soluble as defined above.<br>
5  Methyl cellulose and hydroxypropyl methylcellulose are<br>
commercially available in a number of viscosity grades from Dow Chemical as their METHOCEL trademark series. Hydroxypropyl methylcellulose is most preferred, and is available from Dow Chemical as their METHOCEL E,F,J,K and 40-<br>
10  Series products.<br>
Generally the viscosity of the water-soluble, nonionic cellulose ether ranges from 100 to 100,000,  preferably from 4,000 to 75,000 mPa.s for a 2% aqueous solution at 20°C, <br>
15  measured by Ubbelohde tube viscometer.<br>
Examples of preferred commercially available materials are METHOCEL 40-100, METHOCEL 40-101 and METHOCEL 40-202 from Dow Chemical. <br>
20<br>
Mixtures of any of the above water-soluble nonionic<br>
cellulose ethers may also be suitable.<br>
Water-soluble nonionic cellulose ether will generally be <br>
25  	present in compositions of the invention at levels of from 0.01 to 2.0%, preferably from 0.1 to 0.5%, more preferably from 0.1 to 0.3%, by total weight of cellulose ether based on the total weight of the composition.<br><br>

PCT/EP2005/007237<br><br>
-   12   -<br>
Other sugar-derived nonionic surfactants which can be included in compositions of the invention include the C10-C18 <br>
N-alkyl (C1-C6) polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, such as the C12-C18 N-methyl glucamides, as described for example in <br>
5  	WO 92 06154 and US 5 194 639, and the N-alkoxy polyhydroxy fatty acid amides, such as C10-C18 N-(3-methoxypropyl) glucamide.<br>

5  	The total amount of surfactant (including any co-surfactant, and/or any emulsifier) in a shampoo composition of the invention is generally from 1 to 50%, preferably from 2 to 40%, more preferably from 10 to 25% by total weight surfactant based on the total weight of the composition. <br>
10<br>
Cationic Polymers<br>
Cationic polymers are preferred ingredients in a shampoo composition of the invention for enhancing conditioning<br>
15  performance.<br>
Suitable cationic polymers may be homopolymers which are cationically substituted or may be formed from two or more types of monomers.  The weight average (Mw) molecular weight<br>
20  of the polymers will generally be between 100 000 and 2<br>
million daltons.  The polymers will have cationic nitrogen containing groups such as quaternary ammonium or protonated amino groups, or a mixture thereof.  If the molecular weight of the polymer is too low, then the conditioning effect is<br>
25  poor.  If too high, then there may be problems of high extensional viscosity leading to stringiness of the composition when it is poured.<br>
The cationic nitrogen-containing group will generally be <br>
30  	present as a substituent on a fraction of the total monomer units of the cationic polymer. Thus when the polymer is not<br><br>

PCT/EP2005/007237<br><br><br>
-   14   -<br>
a homopolymer it can contain spacer non-cationic monomer units.  Such polymers are described in the CTFA Cosmetic Ingredient Directory, 3rd edition.  The ratio of the cationic to non-cationic monomer units is selected to give polymers <br>
5  	having a cationic charge density in the required range, which is generally from 0.2 to 3.0 meq/gm. The cationic charge density of the polymer is suitably determined via the Kjeldahl method as described in the US Pharmacopoeia under chemical tests for nitrogen determination.<br>
10<br>
Suitable cationic polymers include, for example, copolymers of vinyl monomers having cationic amine or quaternary ammonium functionalities with water soluble spacer monomers such as (meth)acrylamide, alkyl and dialkyl<br>
15  (meth)acrylamides, alkyl (meth)acrylate, vinyl caprolactone and vinyl pyrrolidine.  The alkyl and dialkyl substituted monomers preferably have C1-C7 alkyl groups, more preferably Cl-3 alkyl groups.  Other suitable spacers include vinyl esters, vinyl alcohol, maleic anhydride, propylene glycol<br>
20  and ethylene glycol.<br>
The cationic amines can be primary, secondary or tertiary amines, depending upon the particular species and the pH of the composition.  In general secondary and tertiary amines,<br>
25  especially tertiary, are preferred.<br>
Amine substituted vinyl monomers and amines can be polymerized in the amine form and then converted to ammonium<br>
by quaternization. 30<br><br>

PCT/EP2005/007237<br><br>
-  15   -<br>
The cationic polymers can comprise mixtures of monomer units derived from amine- and/or quaternary ammonium-substituted monomer and/or compatible spacer monomers.<br>

in which R is a hydrocarbyl chain having 10 or more carbon atoms, <br>
25   	R2 and R3 are independently selected from hydrocarbyl chains of from 1 to 10 carbon atoms, and<br>
m is an integer from 1 to about 10; and<br><br>
WO 2006/010440<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/007237<br><br>
-   21   -<br>
(ii)      an  acid.<br>
As used herein, the term hydrocarbyl chain means an alkyl or alkenyl chain. <br>
5<br>
Preferred amidoamine compounds are those corresponding to formula (I) in which<br>
R1 is a hydrocarbyl residue having from about 11 to about 24 10  carbon atoms,<br>
R2 and R3 are each independently hydrocarbyl residues,<br>
preferably alkyl groups, having from 1 to about 4 carbon<br>
atoms, and<br>
m is an integer from 1 to about 4. 15<br>
Preferably, R2 and R3 are methyl or ethyl groups.<br>
Preferably, m is 2 or 3, i.e. an ethylene or propylene group.<br>
20<br>
Preferred amidoamines useful herein include stearamido-propyldimethylamine, stearamidopropyldiethylamine, stearamidoethyldiethylamine, stearamidoethyldimethylamine, palmitamidopropyldimethylamine, palmitamidopropyl-<br>
25  diethylamine, palmitamidoethyldiethylamine,<br>

WO 2006/010440<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/007237<br><br>
-   22   -<br>
Particularly preferred amidoamines useful herein are stearamidopropyldimethylamine, stearamidoethyldiethylamine,<br>
and mixtures thereof.<br>
5  Commercially available amidoamines useful herein include: stearamidopropyldimethylamine with tradenames LEXAMINE S-13 available from Inolex (Philadelphia Pennsylvania, USA) and AMIDOAMINE MSP available from Nikko (Tokyo, Japan), stearamidoethyldiethylamine with a tradename AMIDOAMINE S<br>
10  available from Nikko, behenamidopropyldimethylamine with a tradename INCROMINE BB available from Croda (North Humberside, England), and various amidoamines with tradenames SCHERCODINE series available from Scher (Clifton New Jersey, USA).<br>

20  lactic acid, malic acid, succinic acid, and mixtures<br>
thereof.  Preferably, the acid is selected from the group consisting of acetic acid, tartaric acid, hydrochloric acid, fumaric acid, and mixtures thereof.<br>
25  The primary role of the acid is to protonate the amidoamine in the hair treatment composition thus forming a tertiary amine salt (TAS) in situ in the hair treatment composition. The TAS in effect is a non-permanent quaternary ammonium or pseudo-quaternary ammonium cationic surfactant.<br>
30<br><br>
WO 2006/010440<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/007237<br><br>
-  23   -<br>
Suitably, the acid is included in a sufficient amount to protonate all the amidoamine present, i.e. at a level which is at least equimolar to the amount of amidoamine present in the composition. <br>
5<br>
In conditioners of the invention, the level of cationic surfactant will generally range from 0.01 to 10%, more preferably 0.05 to 7.5%, most preferably 0.1 to 5% by weight of the composition.<br>
10<br>
Conditioners of the invention will typically also incorporate a fatty alcohol.  The combined use of fatty alcohols and cationic surfactants in conditioning compositions is believed to be especially advantageous, because this leads to the<br>
15  formation of a lamellar phase, in which the cationic surfactant is dispersed.<br>
Representative fatty alcohols comprise from 8 to 22 carbon atoms, more preferably 16 to 22.  Fatty alcohols are<br>
20  typically compounds containing straight chain alkyl groups. Examples of suitable fatty alcohols include cetyl alcohol, stearyl alcohol and mixtures thereof. The use of these materials is also advantageous in that they contribute to the overall conditioning properties of compositions of the<br>
25  invention.<br>
The level of fatty alcohol in conditioners of the invention will generally range from 0.01 to 10%, preferably from 0.1 to 8%, more preferably from 0.2 to 7%, most preferably from 0.3<br>
30  	to 6% by weight of the composition.  The weight ratio of<br>
cationic surfactant to fatty alcohol is suitably from 1:1 to<br><br>
WO 2006/010440<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/007237<br><br>
-  24   -<br>
1:10, preferably from 1:1.5 to 1:8, optimally from 1:2 to 1:5. If the weight ratio of cationic surfactant to fatty alcohol is too high, this can lead to eye irritancy from the composition. If it is too low, it can make the hair feel <br>
5  squeaky for some consumers.<br>
Further Conditioning Agents<br>
Compositions of the invention may comprise further <br>
10  	conditioning agents to optimise wet and dry conditioning benefits.<br>
Particularly preferred further conditioning agents are silicone emulsions.<br>
15<br>
Suitable silicone emulsions include those formed from silicones such as polydiorganosiloxanes, in particular polydimethylsiloxanes which have the CTFA designation dimethicone, polydimethyl siloxanes having hydroxyl end<br>
20  groups which have the CTFA designation dimethiconol, and<br>
amino-functional polydimethyl siloxanes which have the CTFA designation amodimethicone.<br>
The emulsion droplets may typically have a Sauter mean <br>
25  	droplet diameter (D3,2) in the composition of the invention ranging from 0.01 to 20 micrometer, more preferably from 0.2 to 10 micrometer.<br>
A suitable method for measuring the Sauter mean droplet<br>
30  diameter (D3,2) is by laser light scattering using an instrument such as a Malvern Mastersizer.<br><br>
WO 2006/010440<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/007237<br><br>
-  25  -<br>
Suitable silicone emulsions for use in compositions of the invention are available from suppliers of silicones such as Dow Corning and GE Silicones. The use of such pre-formed silicone emulsions is preferred for ease of processing and<br>
5	control of silicone particle size. Such pre-formed silicone emulsions will typically additionally comprise a suitable emulsifier such as an anionic or nonionic emulsifier, or mixture thereof, and may be prepared by a chemical emulsification process such as emulsion polymerisation, or<br>
10  	by mechanical emulsification using a high shear mixer. Preformed silicone emulsions having a Sauter mean droplet diameter (D3,2) of less than 0.15 micrometers are generally termed microemulsions.<br>
15  Examples of suitable pre-formed silicone emulsions include emulsions DC2-1766, DC2-1784, DC-1785, DC-1786, DC-1788 and microemulsions DC2-1865 and DC2-1870, all available from Dow Corning.  These are all emulsions/microemulsions of dimethiconol. Also suitable are amodimethicone emulsions<br>
20  such as DC939 (from Dow Corning) and SME253 (from GE Silicones).<br>
Also suitable are silicone emulsions in which certain types of surface active block copolymers of a high molecular <br>
25  weight have been blended with the silicone emulsion<br>
droplets, as described for example in WO03/094874. In such materials, the silicone emulsion droplets are preferably formed from polydiorganosiloxanes such as those described<br>
above. One preferred form of the surface active block 30  copolymer is according to the following formula:<br><br>
WO 2006/010440	PCT/EP2005/007237<br>
-   26  -<br><br><br><br>
5  wherein the mean value of x is 4 or more and the mean value of y is 25 or more.<br>
Another preferred form of the surface active block copolymer is according to the following formula:<br>
10<br><br>
15  wherein the mean value of a is 2 or more and the mean value of b is 6 or more.<br>
Mixtures of any of the above described silicone emulsions may also be used.<br>
20<br>
Silicone will generally be present in a composition of the invention at levels of from 0.05 to 10%, preferably 0.05 to 5%, more preferably from 0.5 to 2% by total weight of silicone based on the total weight of the composition.<br>
25<br>
Other Optional Ingredients<br>
A composition of the invention may contain other ingredients for enhancing performance and/or consumer acceptability. <br>
30  Such ingredients include fragrance, dyes and pigments, pH adjusting agents, pearlescers or opacifiers, viscosity modifiers, preservatives, and natural hair nutrients such as<br><br>
WO 2006/010440<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/007237<br><br>
-   27   -<br>
botanicals, fruit extracts, sugar derivatives and amino acids.<br>
Process 5<br>
A particularly preferred process for preparing a hair care composition of the invention comprises a first step of blending the water-soluble, nonionic polymer of ethylene oxide with a carrier liquid, so as to form a slurry in which <br>
10  the polymer is coated with the carrier liquid. The slurry is then blended with the remaining composition ingredients using agitation to disperse the coating of carrier liquid.<br>
Suitable carrier liquids may be any cosmetically acceptable<br>
15 	 material which does not dissolve the water-soluble, nonionic polymer of ethylene oxide to any significant extent. Preferred examples include glycerine, oily hydrophobic perfumes and mixtures thereof.<br>
20  Mode of Use<br>
The compositions of the invention are primarily intended for topical application to the hair and/or scalp of a human subject in rinse-off compositions, in order to provide<br>
25  cleansing while improving hair fibre surface properties such as smoothness, softness, manageability, cuticle integrity, and shine. The compositions provided by the invention are preferably aqueous shampoo compositions, used by massaging them into the hair followed by rinsing with clean water<br>
30  prior to drying the hair. Optionally, a separate<br>
conditioning formulation may be applied after rinsing and<br><br>
WO 2006/010440<br><br>
PCT/EP2005/007237<br><br>
-  28   -<br>
