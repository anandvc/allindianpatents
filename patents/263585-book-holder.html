FIG 10 is a side view showing a possible system for securing the book holder to a fixed structure, and<br>
FIG 11 is a partial top view of a possible system for locking the arms in an open position<br>
Reference is first made to FIGS 1 to 8, wherein a book holder 10 constructed m accordance with a possible embodiment is shown This book holder 10 is designed to hold a book m an open displayed manner, thereby facilitating reading and handling of the book by its user The book is held open when the book holder 10 is positioned across an edge of the book, which edge is usually the bottom or upper edge thereof This relieves the user from exerting a force on the pages of the boo"k to keep it open Books of various types, sizes and shapes can be used with the book holder 10 The book holder 10 may also have different sizes and shapes, depending on the needs This includes books with hard or soft covers and any other kinds of printed publications with pages bound or otherwise attached so as to be displayed on two or even more juxtaposed sides, for instance magazmes, brochures, catalogs, restaurant menus, etc<br>
Referring now to the embodiment of FIGS 1 to 8, the book holder 10 includes a back member 12 and two opposite displaceable arms 20 that are substantially parallel to<br><br>
WO 2005/110153	PC IVIB2005/001502<br>
6<br>
the back member 12 The back member 12 is shaped as a mostly flat part extending substantially in a transversal axis, although it is slightly curved in the transversal plane to better fit at the back of a regular paperback book The bottom edge of the book holder 10 also has a slight curve to comfortably fit in a user's hand<br>
The arms 20 of the embodiment illustrated in FIGS 1 to 8 are independently movable, meaning that one can be displaced over at least most of its full stroke or range without displacing the other Each arm 20 comprises an elongated body extending between two ends Two of the ends of the arms are positioned one over the other and the other ends are opposite free ends The arms 20 have an identical length, although it is possible to provide arms having two different lengths, if desired<br>
Each arm 20 is provided with a corresponding page pressing member 24 at the free cud thereof In the illustrated embodiment, the page pressing members 24 are m the form of tabs substantially extending in a direction parallel to the back member 12 The page pressing members 24 arc configured and disposed for engaging the opened pages of a book when a book is set in the book holder 10 Each page pressing member 24 compnses a friction lining 24a on a side facing the back member 12, which friction linings provides an mcreased friction between the page pressing members 28 and the surface of the page being engaged, thereby substantially preventing the page from sliding out Examples of friction linings include, but are not limited to, rubber pads, fabric pads, ndges made in the same material than that of the page pressing members 24, etc<br>
The arms 20 are configured and disposed to pivot about a common pivot point, which m the case of the illustrated embodiment consists of a pivot pm 26 mounted between two spaccd-apart flanges 14, 16 orthogonally projecting from a medial location at the front bottom side of the back member 12, thereby operatively connecting the arms 20 to the back member 12   The adjacent ends of the arms 20 at the center of the book holder<br><br>
WO 2005/110153	PCT/IB2005/001502<br>
7<br>
10 have a rounded shape and are designed as superposed complementary members   The pivot pin 26 extend through a hole made in each end<br>
A torsion spring 28 is nested between the flanges 14, 16 and cooperate with the arms 20 so as to bias the page pressing members 24 toward the back member 12 One branch of the spring 28 is connected to one arm 20 and the other branch of the spring 28 is connected to the other arm 20 Therefore, when a book is present in the book holder 10, the two page pressing members 24 are pressed against the pages of the book The book will then be held in position between the page pressing members 24 and the back member 12 due to the constant spring force<br>
The back member 12, the arms 20 and the page pressmg members 24 define a book receiving area to receive one of the edges of the open book In the illustrated embodiment, the uppermost flange 14 of the pair of flanges 14, 16 define a centra] support surface over which the edge of the central portion of the book will rest Each arm 20 also defines a lateral support surface 30 designed to be coplanar or substantially coplanar with the central support surface to furthei support the book<br>
The illustrated book holder 10 comprises a pair of finger-actuated levers 22 configured and disposed to be depressed for displacing the anus 20 Each lever 22 is connected to one end of corresponding arm 20, more specifically the end that is adjacent to the pivot pin 26 One lever 22 is associated with the right arm 20 and the other is associated with the left arm 20 The levers 22 are disposed in a crisscross compact configuration so that each lever 22, when depressed toward the back member 12, can pivot its corresponding arm 20 and the corresponding page pressmg member 24 in a direction opposite that of the force generated by spring 28 For example if left lever 22 is depressed toward the back member ] 2, the right arm 20 is lifted away from back member 20, creating a space between the right page pressmg member 24 and the back member 12<br><br>
WO 2005/110153	PCT/IB2005/001502<br>
8<br>
for inserting one of the sides of the edge of the book When one of the levers 22 is released, the corresponding arm 20 and .page pressing members 24 are set back to their page pressing position In the illustrated embodiment, each lever 22 is made integral with the corresponding arm 20 and also the corresponding page pressing member 24 For instance, if made of plastic, these elements can be molded in a unitary part<br>
As best shown in FIG 1, each arm 20 of the illustrated embodiment comprises a iccess 29 configured and disposed to receive a back side of the lever 22 connected to the other arm 20, thereby providing a lengthened stroke for the arms 20 This feature can also be omitted, if not desired<br>
The illustrated book holder 10 can be used either as a handheld device or as a self-supported device For instance, the book holder 10 can be used without being held by a user's hand simply by putting the open book and the associated book holder 10 on a supporting surface, with pages facing up or down It can also be provided with a system for supporting it The illustrated book holder 10 comprises a support system ui the form stabilization members pivotally connected to the back member 12 The stabilization members are configured and disposed to keep the book holder 10 m a standing position on a support surface, which surface is usually horizontal In the upstanding position, the pages of the book in the book holder 10 can define a substantially orthogonal angle with the support surface or be inclined with reference thereto so as to facilitate the reading by the user A slight angle generally provides a better stability to the standing book holder 10 The stabilization members of the illustrated embodiment comprise two substantially flat flaps 40 having a substantially vertical edge pivotally connected to a respective end of the back member 12 by means of a corresponding hinge 42 Each flap 40 comprises a surface-engaging edge 50 at a bottom side thereof The flaps 40 are movable between a closed position where they arc resting against the back side of the back member 12, and an<br><br>
WO 2005/110153	PCT/1B2005/001S02<br>
9<br>
open position where the flaps 40 are substantially orthogonal with reference to the back member 12 In the open position, the surface-engaging edges 50 of the flaps 40 allow the book holder 10 to be defining a slight inclination with reference to the support surface Each flap 40 also comprises a protrusion 46 configured and disposed to fit with interference in a corresponding hole 48 made through the back member 12, thereby releasably holding the flaps 40 in their closed position and preventing them from inadvertently moving The flaps 40 can be released from the closed position by pushing on the protrusion 46 with a finger from the front side of the back member 12 A recess can also be provided at the back side of the back member at a location adjacent to a side of the flaps 40, thereby allowing a ringer to lilt the flaps 40 and release them from tbeir closed position<br>
The book holder 10 can be provided with a system for adjusting the inclination angle between the back member 12 and the support surface FIG 9 shows an example of such system In this example, each flap 40 comprises a hinged bottom portion 44 that can be pivoted to be out of engagement with the support surface, allowing another surface-engaging edge 52 to be exposed This second edge results in that the book holder 10 is more inclined on the support surface compared to the first one<br>
The book holder 10 can further comprise a system for temporarily or even permanently securing it to a fixed structure, for instance a bathroom wall or the surface of a bath FIG 10 shows an example of such system In this example, a suction cup 60 is used to attach a stem 62, fixed to the main portion of book holder 10, to the side surface of a bath The stem 62 can be screwed in a threaded hole (not shown) or be otherwise attached to the back member 12, for instance<br>
The book holder 10 can further comprise a system for selectively locking the arms 20 in a fully open position where the book receiving area has a maximum size<br><br>
WO 2005/110153	PCT/IB2005/001502<br>
10<br>
Locking the amis 20 in their maximum open position or near their maximum position allows inserting a book in the book holder 10 without having to depress the levers 22 at the same time FIG 11 shows an example of such system In this example, i a sliding sleeve 70 is provided on one of the arms 20, near the free end of the lever 22 attached to the opposite arm 20 The sleeve 70 is configured and disposed to be slid over that lever 22 when it is fully depressed This keeps the lever 22 and that arm 20 together The second arm 20 will then be dependent on the position of the first arm 20 with reference to the back member 12 The size of the book receiving area is maximized when the dependent arms are centered It can also be maximized on one side at a time by pivoting one side until the page pressing member 24 contacts the back member 12 Therefore, the page pressing member 24 on the opposite side will have a maximum distance with reference to the back member 12 The same is true without the lockmg system Maximizing the distance between the page pressing member 24 of one side and the back member 12 allows more easily inserting a thuck side of a book To release the lockmg system, the user may simply slide the sliding sleeve 70 out of engagement with the corresponding lever 22 The user may also apply a force on the corresponding lever 22 prior to sliding the sleeve 70 so as to avoid the arms from moving too quickly due to the spring force<br>
In use, one edge of the book holder 10 is inserted in a book receiving area defined between the back member 12, the arms 20 and the page pressing members 24 Once in position, the pages of the book will be retained but turning the pages is still possible with the book holder 10 It should be noted that pages of books can be turned from the right to the left side, or from the left to the right side Books can also be pnnted with one side over another, meaning the pages can be turned from top to bottom, or from bottom to top Each time, pages are pivoted with reference to a spinal axis, which axis is generally defined by the spine of the book or the equivalent thereof    Pages arc moved with<br><br>
WO 2005/111)15.3	PCT/IB2005/001502<br>
11<br>
reference to an axis referred to the transversal axis, which axis is generally perpendicular to the spinal axis<br>
To insert an open book in the book holder 10, a user depresses one of the finger-actuated levers 22 for moving one arm 20, thereby lifting a first page pressing member 24 and creating a first space for inserting a first side of the edge of the book between the first page pressing member 24 and a back member 12 Simultaneously, or immediately after, the user depresses the other finger-actuated lever 22 for moving another arm 20, thereby lifting a second page pressing member 24 and creating a second space for inserting the second side of the edge of the book between the second page pressing member 24 and the back member 12 Subsequently, the user releases the first and the second levers 22, thereby allowing the first and the second page pressing member 24 to rest against pages of the book as they are each being biased by the spring force so that the book is being held between the page piessing members 24 and the back member 12 It should be noted that the first lever 22 can be released before or after the second lever 22 is depressed Still, the second lever 22 can be released before the first lever 22 is released<br>
To turn one or more pages of the open book set in the book holder 10, the user lifts the first page pressing member 24 from the pages of a first side of the book by applying a depressing force on the first finger-actuated lever 22 The page or pages can then move from the first side of the book towards a second side thereof Simultaneously, or once the page or pages are removed from the first side, the user lifts the second page pressing member 24 by applying a depressing force on the second finger-actuated lever 22 The page or pages taken from the first side can then be inserted onto the second side of the book Once the page or pages are turned, the user releases the depressing forces It is also possible for the users to release the depiessmg force on the first lever before applying the depressing force on the second lever<br><br>

The specific elements shown in the figures and described in detail here above are only examples of what can be used to construct a book holder as defined in the appended claims It must also be understood that these claims are intended to cover all of the generic and specific features of the book holder herein described Various equivalents, sub-combinations of elements and additional features are intended to fall within the language defined in the appended claims The following text section provides examples of some of these possible equivalents, sub-combinations of elements and additional features Other ones are also possible<br>
A friction lining can be provided on at least a portion of the front side of the back member 12 for further preventing the book mounted on book holder 10 from slipping out of place It may comprise a cushion on the bottom edge to improve comfort This cushion may be realized usmg a dual-mjection method, for instance The front side of the back member 12 may comprise a back rib forwardly projecting parallel to the spinal axis at a medial location thereof This back rib will be m contact with the spine of the book once the book is set m the book holder 10 The back member 12 may further comprise an extension stem, removable or not, upwardly projecting m the spinal axis for supporting oversized books or equivalents in the form of long and soft paper sheets The back member 12, its friction lining, or any other outer surface of the book holder 10 may be customized with text, trademarks or logos, thereby allowing the book holder 10 to be used as a promotional item<br>
The displacement of the arms 20 is not necessarily a pivot movement Arms can be moved by a linking mechanism moving them m a parallel or a semi-parallel manner with reference to the back member 12 Still, each arm 20 can be mounted on its own pivot axis The pivot movement of the arms can be realized using an arrangement that do not involve the use of a pivot pm  For instance, the end of the arms 20 can be connected to the<br><br>
WO 2005/110153	PCT/IB2005/001502<br>
13<br>
back member 12 using tabs with protrusions inserted in a corresponding hole    Other mechanisms similar mechanisms can also be devised<br>
Although the illustrated embodiment shown the arms 20 being independent, the movement of the arras 20 can be made dependent using an appropnate mechanical connection   This can be realized with the use of one or two levers 22   In the case of a book holder 10 using only one lever 22, it is possible to design the book holder 10 so that the lever 22 moves both amis 20 at the same tune or even one arm 20 for a first part of the stroke of the lever 22, then the other arm 20 for the last part of the stroke of the levei 22 The arms 20 need not necessarily have the same shape as in the illustrated embodiment For instance, the arms 20 arc not necessarily tapered<br>
The page pressing members 24 may be provided with or without a friction lining 24a Each page pressing member 24 may also be provided with a partial friction lining 24a or another convenient feature such ,as a roll having an axis parallel to the back member 12 and designed to be in contact with the pages of the open book This further facilitates, for instance, the removal of the pages from one side of the book The page pressing members 24 are not necessarily located at the free end of their conesponding arms 20 and may be located, for instance, at an intermediary location, if desired The page pressing members 24 may define an angle with reference to the back member 12 so that both arc not necessarily parallel, as shown in the illustrated embodiment Pages pressing members 24 may be made integral with the arras 20 and be less distinctive than what is shown in the illustrated embodiment They can also be pivotally connected to the arms 20 and biased by a spnng Still, the pages pressing members 24 can be made transparent so that one can read something printed or illustrated near the edge where the book holder 10 is located<br><br>

The one or the two levers 22 can be provided at the back of the book holder 10 to move the arms 20 at the front While located at the front or at the back, they can be depressed toward each other, for instance being pinched, to move the arms 20 The levers 22 would then be in a V-shaped configuration with the corresponding arm 20 This embodiment may be easier to use for some people, for instance young children Still, a third lever can be provided for a special function, for instance the function of moving the two arms 20 together, whereby the other two arms 20 are designed to move the anus 20 independently Levers 22 are not necessarily made integral with their corresponding arm 20, as in the illustrated embodiment, and they are not necessarily identical They can be designed so that they arc connected to the arms using a distinct mechanical connection, cither removable or not, such as a screw or a nvet Using only one lever 22 to move only one arm 20 is possible The other arm 20 could be moved using another mechanism or even manually<br>
The book holder 10 can be designed without the flanges 14, 16, especially the bottom flange 16 As aforesaid, other ways of connecting the arms 20 to the back member 12 can be devised The upper flange 14 could be omitted For instance, the back member 12 can be provided with an enlarged base on which the edge of the book rests The support surface 30 of the arms 20 may also be used alone to support the edge of the book<br>
Whereas a single torsion spring 28 is used in the illustrated embodiment, it is understood that more than one torsion spring can be used, for example, one torsion spring can be used for each arm 20 Other systems for biasing the arms 20 so as to urge the page pressing members 24 toward the back member 12 can be used The spring or springs may be of another type and consist, for instance, of a leaf spnng The use of an adjustable spring is another option For instance, a screw or another actuation system can be provided to wind or unwind the spring, thereby modifying the spring force   The spnng,<br><br>
WO 2005/110153	PCT/IB200S/001S02<br>
15<br>
springs or any other kind of biasing system are not necessarily nested between the two spaced-apart flanges 14, 16 They can be made visible to be provided inside the arms 20, for instance Still, the natural spring force of a bended arm 20 can also provide the required spring force for create the bias<br>
The stabilization members can be different from that of the illustrated embodiment Rotatable or otherwise movable back arms can be provided instead of flaps 40 The length of these arms can be adjustable to change the in nation angle, for instance Still, the flaps 40, arms or any kind of stabilization members can be made detachable at different location, for instance, thereby providing another way of adjusting the inclination angle Moreover, the system for releasably holding the stabilization members or flaps 40 in a closed position against the back member 12 on a side opposite the book receiving area can be different than what is shown in the illustrated embodiment This system may include a hinged lock or a locking pin for instance Other vanants can be devised as well<br>
Besides the stabilization members, the support system for the book holder 10 can also include alternative design For instance, it may comprises a suction cup, a beanbag, a soft cushion, an inflatable balloon or any similar land of portable object attached to the book holder 10 using an adjustable or fixed-length pole They can also be directly connected thereto A soft cushion can be used for reading while lying down For example, the soft cushion can be placed on the reader's chest when lying down, thereby<br>
providing a deformable base that can conform to the surface it is placed on   An adjustable<br>
pole can extend from the soft cushion and connected to book holder 10   An inflatable<br>
balloon base can similarly be used so as to provide a relatively easy mobility by being able<br>
to be deflated and packed away when traveling and inflated prior to being used    The connection of a support system with the book holder 10 can be removable, for instance<br><br>

16<br>
including a threaded bole in which a complementary threaded member can be screwed Other support systems may include a tnpod, a handle, etc to maintain the book in the desired position Furthermore, whereas attachments for book holder 10 can be connected to book holder 10 at various locations, bottom surface can provide for a relatively easy attachment For example, bottom surface can comprise a threaded member suitable for engaging a threaded member of an attachment, such as an adjustable pole of a soft cushion The support system may further include holes made through the book holder 10 and screws to be attached to a wall or other fixed structure Other support systems can be devised<br>
The locking system for keeping the arms in tbeir open position can include two sliding sleeves, one for each arm, or other kind of system For instance, it may include a built-in mechanism, such as of a ratchet type Other locking systems can be devised for that purpose<br>
The exact size and shape of the book holder 10 can be modified to accommodate various kinds of books and user's requirements One of such requirements can be to provide the book holder 10 sized to be very compact and easy to carry in a small bag, a pocket or the like, which is something possible with the book holder 10 However, other needs may dictate other designs that are not necessarily very compact<br>
Although plastic is the pnme candidate as the material for building most of the book holder 10, other materials can be used For instance, a fully or almost-fully metallic book holder 10 can be made, including shver or even gold plated<br>
Thus, while there have been shown and described and pointed out novel features of the present invention as applied to preferred embodiments thereof, it will be understood that various omissions and substitutions and changes in the form and details of the disclosed invention may be made by those skilled in the art   For example, back member<br><br>
