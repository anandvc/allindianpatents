Description<br>
LIGHT EMITTING DEVICE<br>
Technical Field<br>
The invention relates to light emitting devices and more particularly to light<br>
emitting devices including at least one light-emitting diode and phosphor, the phosphor<br>
including lead and/or copper doped chemical compounds and converting the<br>
wavelength of light.<br>
Background Art<br>
Light emitting devices (LEDs), which used to be used for electronic devices, are<br>
now used for automobiles and illumination products. Since light emitting devices have<br>
superior electrical and mechanical characteristics, demands for light emitting devices<br>
have been increased. In connection to this, interests in white LEDs are increasing as an<br>
alternative to fluorescent lamps and incandescent lamps.<br>
In LED technology , solution for realization of white light is proposed variously.<br>
Normally, realization of white LED technology is to put the phosphor on the light-<br>
emitting diode, and mix the primary emission from the light emitting diode and the<br>
secondary emission from the phosphor, which converts the wavelength. For example,<br>
as shown in WO 98/05078 and WO 98/12757, use a blue light emitting diode, which is<br>
capable of emitting a peak wavelength at 450-490 nm, and YAG group material, which<br>
absorbs light from the blue light emitting diode and emits yellowish light (mostly),<br>
which may have different wavelength from that of the absorbed light<br>
However, in such a usual white LED, color temperature range is narrow which is<br>
between about 6,000-8,000K, and CRI (Color Rendering Index) is about 60 to 75.<br>
Therefore, it is hard to produce the white LED with color coordination and color<br>
temperature that arc similar to those of the visible light. It is one of the reasons why<br>
only white light color with a cold feeling could be realized. Moreover, phosphors<br>
which are used for white LEDs are usually unstable in the water, vapor or polar<br>
solvent, and this unstableness may cause changes in the emitting characteristics of<br>
white LED.<br>

about 90.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a light emitting device in<br>
which desired color temperature or specific color coordination can be easily embodied.<br>

Best Mode<br>
Refer to the attached drawing, the wavelength conversion light emitting device is<br>
going to be explained in detail, and the light emitting device and the phosphor are<br>
separately explained for easiness of explanation as below.<br>
(Light emitting device)<br>
Fig. 1 shows a side cross-sectional view of an illustrative embodiment of a portion<br>
of a chip-type package light emitting device consistent with this invention. The chip-<br>
type package light emitting device may comprise at least one light emitting diode and a<br>
phosphorescent substance . Electrodes 5 may be formed on both sides of substrate 1.<br>
Light emitting diode 6 emitting light may be mounted on one of the electrodes 5. Light<br>
emitting diode 6 may be mounted on electrode 5 through electrically conductive paste<br>
9. An electrode of light emitting diode 6 may be connected to electrode pattern 5 via an<br>
electrically conductive wire 2.<br>
Light emitting diodes may emit light with a wide range of wavelengths, for<br>
example, from ultraviolet light to visible light. In one embodiment consistent with this<br>
invention, a UV light emitting diode and/or blue light emitting diode may be use.<br>
Phosphor, i.e., a phosphorescent substance, 3 may be placed on the top and side<br>
faces of the light emitting diode 6. The phosphor in consistent with this invention may<br>
include lead and/or copper doped aluminate type compounds, lead and/or copper doped<br>
silicates, lead and/or copper doped antimonates , lead and/or copper doped germanates,<br>
lead and/or copper doped germanate-silicates, lead and/or copper doped phosphates, or<br>
any combination thereof. Phosphor 3 converts the wavelength of the light from the<br>
light emitting diode 6 to another wavelength or other wavelengths. In one embodiment<br>
consistent with this invention, the light is in a visible light range after the conversion. P<br><br>
hosphor 3 may be applied to light emitting diode 6 after mixing phosphor 3 with a<br>
hardening resin. The hardening resin including phosphor 3 may also be applied to the<br>
bottom of light emitting diode 6 after mixing phosphor 3 with electrically conductive<br>
paste 9.<br>
The light emitting diode 6 mounted on substrate 1 may be sealed with one or more<br>
sealing materials 10. Phosphor 3 may be placed on the top and side faces of light<br>
emitting diode 6. Phosphor 3 can also be distributed in the hardened sealing material<br>
during the production. Such a manufacturing method is described in U.S. Patent No.<br>
6,482,664, which is hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
Phosphor 3 may comprise lead and/or copper doped chemical compound(s).<br>
Phosphor 3 may include one or more single chemical compounds. The single<br>
compound may have an emission peak of, for example, from about 440nm to about<br>
500nm, from about 500nm to about 590nm, or from about 580nm to 700nm. Phosphor<br>
3 may include one or more single phosphors, which may have an emission peak as ex-<br>
emplified above.<br>
In regard to light emitting device 40, light emitting diode 6 may emit primary light<br>
when light emitting diode 6 receives power from a power supply. The primary light<br>
then may stimulate phosphor(s) 3, and phosphor(s) 3 may convert the primary light to<br>
a light with longer wavelength(s) (a secondary light). The primary light from the light<br>
emitting diode 6 and the secondary light from the phosphors 3 are diffused and mixed<br>
together so that a predetermined color of light in visible spectrum may be emitted from<br>
light emitting diode 6. In one embodiment consistent with this invention, more than<br>
one light emitting diodes that have different emission peaks can be mounted together.<br>
Moreover, if the mixture ratio of phosphors is adjusted properly, specific color of light,<br>
color temperature, and CRI can be provided.<br>
As described above, if the light emitting diode 6 and the compound included in<br>
phosphor 3 are properly controlled then desired color temperature or specific color co-<br>
ordination can be provided, especially, wide range of color temperature, for example,<br>
from about 2,000K to about 8,000K or about 10,000K and/or color rendering index of<br>
greater than about 90. Therefore, the light emitting devices consistent with this<br>
invention may be used for electronic devices such as home appliances, stereos,<br>
telecommunication devices, and for interior/exterior custom displays. The light<br>
emitting devices consistent with this invention may also be used for automobiles and<br>
illumination products because they provide similar color temperatures and CRI to<br>
those of the visible light.<br>
Fig. 2 shows a side cross-sectional view of an illustrative embodiment of a portion<br>
of a top-type package light emitting device consistent with this invention. A top -type<br>
package light emitting device consistent with this invention may have a similar<br><br>
structure as that of the chip type package light emitting device 40 of Fig. 1. The top-<br>
type package device may have reflector 31 which may reflect the light from the light<br>
emitting diode 6 to the desire direction.<br>
In top -type package light emitting device 50, more than one light emitting diodes<br>
can be mounted. Each of such light emitting diodes may have a different peak<br>
wavelength from that of others. Phosphor 3 may comprise a plurality of single<br>
compounds with different emission peak. The proportion of each of such plurality of<br>
compounds may be regulated. Such a phosphor may be applied to the light emitting<br>
diode and/or uniformly distributed in the hardening material of the reflector 31. As<br>
explained more fully below, the phosphor in consistent with this invention may include<br>
lead and/or copper doped aluminate type compounds, lead and/or copper doped<br>
silicates, lead and/or copper doped antimonates, lead and/or copper doped germanates,<br>
lead and/or copper doped germanate-silicates, lead and/or copper doped phosphates, or<br>
any combination thereof.<br>
In one embodiment consistent with this invention, the light emitting device of the<br>
Fig. 1 or Fig. 2 can include a metal substrate, which may have good heat conductivity.<br>
Such a light emitting device may easily dissipate the heat from the light emitting diode.<br>
Therefore, light emitting devices for high power may be manufactured. If a heat sink is<br>
provided beneath the metal substrate, the heat from the light emitting diode may be<br>
dissipated more effectively.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a side cross-sectional view of an illustrative embodiment of a portion<br>
of a lamp-type package light emitting device consistent with this invention. Lamp type<br>
light emitting device 60 may have a pair of leads 51, 52, and a diode holder 53 may be<br>
formed at the end of one lead. Diode holder 53 may have a shape of cup, and one or<br>
more light emitting diodes 6 may provided in the diode holder 53. When a number of<br>
light emitting diodes are provided in the diode holder 53, each of them may have a<br>
different peak wavelength from that of others. An electrode of light emitting diode 6<br>
may be connected to lead 52 by, for example, electrically conductive wire 2.<br>

electrode of the light emitting diode 6 and another lead frame 74 may be connected via<br>
electrically conductive wire. Electrically conductive pate 9 may be provided between<br>
light emitting diode 6 and lead frame 74. The phosphor 3 may be placed on top and<br>
side faces of light emitting diode 6.<br>
Fig. 5 shows a side cross-sectional view of another illustrative embodiment of a<br>
portion of a light emitting device for high power consistent with this invention.<br>

light emitting diodes 6,7, phosphor 3 arranged on the top and side faces of light<br>
emitting diodes 6, 7, one or more heat sinks 61,62, and one or more lead frames 64.<br>
The lead frames 64 may receive power from a power supplier and may protrude from<br>

In the light emitting devices for high power 70, 80 in the Fig. 4 and 5, the phosphor<br>
3 can be added to the paste, which may be provided between heat sink and light<br>
emitting devices. A lens may be combined with housing 63, 73.<br>
In a light emitting device for high power consistent with this invention, one or<br>
more light emitting diodes can be used selectively and the phosphor can be regulated<br>
depending on the light emitting diode. As explained more fully below, the phosphor<br>
may include lead and/or copper doped components.<br>
A light emitting device for high power consistent with this invention may have a<br>
radiator (not shown) and/or heat sink(s). Air or a fan may be used to cool the radiator.<br>

1,450°C in a reduced atmosphere for about 4 hours may be followed. After that the<br>
material may be milled, washed, dried and sieved. The resulting luminescent material<br>
may have an emission maximum of about 494 nm.<br>
