Continental Aktiengesellschaft Description<br>
Pneumatic vehicle tire having a tire bead with a bead core and a bead filler and method for producing the pneumatic vehicle tire<br>
The invention relates to a pneumatic vehicle tire having a tire bead with a bead core and a bead filler. The invention also relates to a method for producing a pneumatic vehicle tire of this type.<br>
It is known that tires are very flexible in the sidewall region, so that they can deform considerably under a load in the vertical direction. However, the tire beads in the sidewall region must have a certain flexural rigidity in order for the tire to have good running characteristics. The flexural rigidity of the tire bead must be all the greater the greater the loading of the tire during driving, which applies in particular to the tires of commercial vehicles. To be able to ensure adequate flexural rigidity of the tire bead, pneumatic vehicle tires are provided with bead fillers which have a relatively large outer diameter. This requirement applies in particular to so-called capered bead sear tires for commercial vehicles. Previously, tapered bead seat tires were only produced on so-called two-stage tire building machines. On account of their concept, they have the disadvantage that the production process cannot ensure high production accuracy. For this reason, modern building machines are configured as single-stage tire building machines. One special aspect of the single-stage method is that the bead filler is delivered to the building machine upright and in a ready-folded state. This procedure offers the advantage that the bead filler no longer has to be turned about the bead core.<br><br>
In the single-stage tire building method, however, there is the problem that the bead filler to be applied must not exceed a certain outer diameter. On the one hand, the limitation is set by the dimensioning of the core setting device, which likewise must nor exceed a certain outer diameter. On the other hand, the prefabrication of the ready-folded bead filler is limited to a certain outer diameter. If the outer diameter were exceeded, the bead filler would bend back in the direction of the bead core on account of the high prestress. If the outer diameter of the bead filler were reduced, the running characteristics and the durability of the bead would be impaired.<br>
The invention is therefore based on the object of providing a pneumatic vehicle tire that has a highly durable bead. A further object is to provide a method for producing such a pneumatic vehicle tire.<br>
The object is achieved according to the characterizing features of claim i by the bead filler comprising at least three bead filler parts, which when joined together produce a substantially wedge-shaped cross-sectional profile. The object is also achieved by the independent method claim 11.<br>
One advantage of the bead reinforcer according to the invention is to be seen in particular in that the pneumatic vehicle tire according to the invention has a highly durable bead. In conventional single-stage tire building methods, the maximum outer diameter of the bead filler is limited. By dividing the bead filler into three beau filler parts, it is possible to provide the pneumatic vehicle tire with a bead filler that has a relatively large outer diameter. As a result, the tire has optimum running characteristics and a high mileage, since the tire bead is highly durable.<br><br>
In an advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that the inner bead filler part, arranged toward the inner side of the tire, forms a first bead filler part and the central and outer bead filler parts form a second bead filler part. By being divided in this way, it is ensured that the bead filler can be produced in a simple manner with a large outer diameter.<br>
In a further advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that the first bead filler part has a larger outer diameter than the second bead filler part. This allows the bead filler to be produced more easily.<br>
In a further advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that the second bead filler part is introduced into the tire during the tire building as a preliminary material in a state in which it is ready-folded onto the bead core. This allows the pneumatic vehicle tire to be easily produced by a single-stage tire building method.<br>
In a further advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that the outer bead filler part and the inner bead filler part comprise a soft rubber compound with a Shore A hardness of between 58 and 68.<br>
In a further advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that the central bead filler par comprises a hard rubber compound with a Shore A hardness of between, 81 and 91. The different rubber compounds of the bead filler have the effect of improving the durability of the bead and the running properties of the tire.<br>
In a further advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that the central bead filler part has a wedge-shaped profile.  The wedge-shaped profile offers<br><br>
the advantage that this bead filler part can be provided with the outer and inner bead filler parts in a simple manner.<br>
In a further advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that the inner bead filler part is connected in surface-area contact to the central and outer bead filler parts. As a result, a high-strength connection is achieved between the first bead filler part and the second bead filler part.<br>
In a further advantageous development of the invention, it is provided that the pneumatic vehicle tire is a tapered bead seat tire for commercial vehicles. In the case of these tires, a bead filler with a large outer diameter is particularly advantageous.<br>
The invention is to be explained in more detail on the basis of an exemplary embodiment.  In the drawing:<br>
Figure 1  shows  a  tire  bead  with  the  bead  filler<br>
according to the invention and Figure 2  shows the method according to the invention<br>
for producing a pneumatic vehicle tire.<br>
Figure 1 schematically shows the tire bead 1 of the pneumatic vehicle tire according to the invention with the bead filler 2. This figure concerns a radial sectional view of the pneumatic vehicle tire, in which, the bead filler 2 and the bead core 3 are represented as a cross-sectional profile, further tire components that are not explicitly represented running in the tire bead 1, such as for example carcass plies and bead reinforce is. In the figure, the tire bead 1 on the right is represented and the pressurized inner side 4 of the tire lies on the left side of the tire bead 1. The bead filler 2 is made up of three bead filler parts,  the inner bead filler part 5,  arranged toward<br><br>
the inner side 4 of the tire, the central bead filler part 6 and the outer bead filler part 7. The inner bead filler part 5 in this case represents the first bead filler part mentioned in the production method. When joined together, these bead filler parts produce a wedge-shaped profile. The bead filler parts 6 and 7 form the second bead filler part, which is prepared outside the tire building drum as a preliminary material in a state in which it is ready-folded onto the bead core. The bead filler part 5 and the bead filler part 7 consist of a rubber material with a soft rubber compound, preferably with a Shore A hardness of approximately 63, whereas the central bead filler part 6 consists of a hard rubber compound with a Shore A hardness of approximately 8 6. The height of the bead filler part 2 with the bead core 3, measured between the outer diameter of the bead filler part 2 and the inner diameter of the bead core 3, is between 110 and 150 mm, preferably approximately 130 mm. The bead filler 2 according to the invention has the overall effect of achieving better durability of the bead, whereby the pneumatic vehicle tire has a higher mileage than conventional tires.<br>
Figure 2 shows the method according to the invention. It is a so-called single-stage method, in which firstly the tire components 9 for forming the carcass are placed one after the other onto the tire building drum 8, such as for example the bead reinforcer plies and the inner tire. The designation 3 merely indicates schematically the sun ace or me tire out joining arum with the line of axial symmetry 10. All the components represented are also rotationally symmetrical in relation to the axial axis of the tire building drum. As the last tire component, the inner bead filler part is placed onto the last ply. Subsequently, a core setting device (not represented) is used to position the  bead  core  3  with  the  second  bead  filler  part<br><br>
comprising the bead filler parts 6 and 7 over the tire building drum. The core setting device is used to position the bead filler parts 6 and 7 in a ready-folded state in an upright position standing on the bead core 3. The tire components 11 are the tire components of the belt region of the pneumatic vehicle tire, which are built up separately on the belt machine. During the cambering operation, tire components of the tire carcass are united with the belt region, the first bead filler part 5 at the same time being turned up and consequently brought together with the second bead filler part, whereby the bead filler 2 represented in Figure 1 is produced. Subsequently, the pneumatic vehicle tire is completed by a conventional single-stage building method.<br><br>
