Description<br>
PROCESS FOR INCREASING PRODUCTION OF LIGHT<br>
OLEFIN HYDROCARBON FROM HYDROCARBON<br>
FEEDSTOCK<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a process for increasing the production of light olefin hydrocarbons from a hydrocarbon feedstock. More particularly, the present invention pertains to a process for increasing the production of C2-C4 light olefin hydrocarbons by integrating a process for producing an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from a hydrocarbon mixture and a process for producing a hydrocarbon feedstock which is capable of being used as a feedstock in the former process.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, naphthas, pyrolysis gasolines which are reaction products of a pyrolysis process, reformates which are reaction products of a catalytic reforming process, and fluidized catalytic cracking gasolines which are reaction products of a fluidized catalytic cracking process are used as feedstocks in processes for producing an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture and/or LPG from a hydrocarbon mixture.<br>
In connection with this, the pyrolysis process is a process for producing basic petrochemical materials, such as ethylene and propylene, as main products from naphthas as a fraction. In this process, a fraction which is rich in aromatic compounds, such as pyrolysis gasolines, is produced as a byproduct.<br>
In the catalytic reforming process, gasolines, benzene, toluene, xylene, and C9+ aromatic hydrocarbons are produced from naphthas, as a feedstock, that are heavier than those of the pyrolysis process, and a fraction which is rich in aromatic components is also produced.<br>
Furthermore, in the fluidized catalytic cracking process, a gasoline fraction, which is rich in ethylene, propylene, and aromatic components, is produced from a feedstock that is heavier than that of the catalytic reforming process.<br>
When an independent process for producing an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture and/ or LPG is conducted using the above-mentioned pyrolysis gasolines, reformates, and/ or fluidized catalytic cracking gasolines as feedstock oil, production of the LPG is conducted in conjunction with production of aromatics, thus a large portion of the imported LPG can be substituted with LPG generated as a byproduct in an area where most of the LPG is imported, such as Korea. However, there is a disadvantage in that hydrogen is used in a large amount because purge gas, which has a high content of<br><br>
hydrogen generated in the process, is used as a fuel in the process. Therefore, there remains a need for a process for increasing the utility of a non-aromatic carbon compound, which is rich in LPG and produced through a catalytic reaction, and reducing the amount of hydrogen used.<br>
Disclosure of Inyention Technical Problem<br>
Leading to the present invention, the intensive and thorough research on production of light olefin hydrocarbon, carried out by the present inventors aiming to avoid the problems encountered in the prior arts, resulting in the finding that, when a process for producing an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture and LPG from a hydrocarbon mixture and a process for producing a hydrocarbon feedstock which is capable of being used as a feedstock of the former process are integrated, it is possible to improve the productivity and efficiency of each process or of the overall process, thereby accomplishing the present invention.<br>
Therefore, it is an object of the present invention to provide a process for increasing the production of light olefin hydrocarbons by improving the productivity and efficiency of a process for producing an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture and LPG from a hydrocarbon mixture, a process for producing a hydrocarbon feedstock which is capable of being used as a feedstock in the former process, or the combined processes.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a process for recovering residual hydrogen after non-aromatic hydrocarbon compounds are hydrogenated in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
It is still another object of the present invention to provide a process for producing a mixture, which is rich in an LPG component and generated in the course of hy-drogenating non-aromatic hydrocarbon compounds of feedstock oil in the presence of a catalyst, in an LPG separating column of a process of producing a feedstock oil without an additional LPG separating column.<br>
It is yet another object of the present invention to provide a process for using ethane and an LPG component, which are generated in the course of hydrogenating non-aromatic hydrocarbon compounds of the feedstock oil in the presence of a catalyst, as a process fuel and a feedstock for a pyrolysis process.<br>

Advantageous Effects<br>
In the present invention, a process for producing an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture and LPG from a hydrocarbon mixture and a process for producing a hydrocarbon feedstock capable of being used as a feedstock in the former process are integrated. Thus, there are advantages in that it is possible to reduce the amount of hydrogen used in the process, the use of a compressor may be unnecessary depending on the type of<br><br>
process, and, if a separation device of a pyroly sis process has a surplus space, it is possible to separate LPG without an additional LPG separation device, resulting in excellent economic efficiency.<br>
Furthermore, LPG and ethane components, which are separated in the process for producing the aromatic hydrocarbon mixture and the LPG from the hydrocarbon mixture, are used as a feedstock of the pyrolysis process, thus it is possible to improve the productivity of light olefin hydrocarbons, particularly ethylene, in a pyrolysis furnace.<br>
As well, if excess LPG is exported or used as a fuel of a process, the process is integrated with a feedstock supplying process while it is not independendy used, thus it is possible to increase the utility of a non-aromatic carbon compound which is rich in LPG and produced using a catalytic reaction and reduce the amount of hydrogen used, thereby it is possible to improve the productivity and efficiency of the two processes which are integrated.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
The above and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will be more clearly understood from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates one embodiment of a procedure of increasing the production of light olefin hydrocarbons from a hydrocarbon feedstock, according to the present invention;<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates another embodiment of a procedure of increasing the production of light olefin hydrocarbons from a hydrocarbon feedstock, according to the present invention; and<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates still another embodiment of a procedure of increasing the production of light olefin hydrocarbons from a hydrocarbon feedstock, according to the present invention.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
Hereinafter, a detailed description will be given of the present invention, referring to the drawings.<br>
FIGS. 1 to 3 illustrate procedures of increasing the production of light olefin hydrocarbons from a hydrocarbon feedstock, according to preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
With reference to FIGS. 1 to 3, a hydrocarbon feedstock fraction 111, such as naphtha, which is used as a feedstock of a pyrolysis process, is fed into a pyrolysis furnace 131 and then converted into light gas components 112 through a pyrolysis reaction in the presence of steam. The components 112 are fed into a compression and<br><br>
fractionation unit 132.<br>
The hydrocarbon feedstock used in the present invention preferably includes hydrocarbons having a boiling point of 30-250°C, and may be selected from the group consisting of reformate, pyrolysis gasoline, fluidized catalytic cracking gasoline, C9+ aromatic-containing mixture, naohtha, and mixtures thereof.<br>
Hydrogen and light hydrocarbons 113 which are separated by the compression and fractionation unit 132 are fed into a cooling unit 133, and hydrogen 116 and hydrocarbons 117 are separated from each other therein. Meanwhile, separated hydrocarbons 117 are fed into a fractionation unit 135 at a rear stage to separate ethylene 118 and propylene 119, which are main products of the pyrolysis process, from ethane 120, propane 121, butane 122, and a C5 fraction 115. In connection with this, ethane 120, propane 121, and butane 122, which are produced from the fractionation unit 135, are completely or partially recycled into the pyrolysis fumace 131 so that they are used as a feedstock 126 of the pyrolysis reaction, thereby the yield of ethylene 118 and propylene 119, which are main products of the pyrolysis funace, is increased.<br>
Meanwhile, heavy hydrocarbons (C5+) 114, which are separated by the compression and fractionation unit 132, are fed into a hydrogenation and separation unit 134 in conjunction with hydrocarbons (C5+) 115, which are supplied from the fractionation unit 135, to form hydrocarbons 123 in which sulfur compounds are converted and thus removed. The resulting hydrocarbons 123 are fed into a fractionation unit 136 at a rear stage, and then separated into pyrolysis gasolines 124 and a fraction 125 containing C9+ hydrocarbons.<br>
Meanwhile, the separated pyrolysis gasolines 124 are used as a reaction feedstock component in a process for producing an aromatic hydrocarbon mixture and liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) from a hydrocarbon mixture.<br>
That is to say, the pyrolysis gasolines 124 are mixed with a hydrocarbon feedstock 11, hydrogen 22 and highly pure hydrogen 12,116, and fed as feedstock oil into a reactor 3.<br>
In coimection with this, a separate heater 2 is provided in order to increase the temperature of a hydrogen/feedstock mixture to a reaction temperature. The hydrogen/ feedstock mixture is heated to some extent 13 through heat exchange with reaction products 15 which are discharged from the reactor 3 and then fed into a heat exchanger 1, and then fed into the heater 2.<br>
The hydrogen/feedstock mixture 14 which is fed into the reactor 3 is subjected to dealkylation, transalkylation, and hydrogenation reactions in the presence of a catalyst.<br>
That is to say, a hydrocracking reaction of non-aromatic hydrocarbon compounds, and the dealkylation and transalkylation reactions of aromatic hydrocarbon compounds are simultaneously carried out in the reactor 3 to produce main basic petrochemical<br><br>
materials, such as benzene, toluene, and xylene, and byproducts, such as LPG and non-aromatic compounds.<br>
In connection with this, the catalyst, which is packed in the reactor 3 to cause the dealkylation, transalkylation, and hydrogenation reactions, is not limited as long as it is known to those skilled in the art, and, preferably, may be a catalyst disclosed in U.S. Patent No. 6,635,792.<br>
That is to say, 10-95 wt% zeolite, which is at least one selected from the group consistmg of mordenite, a beta type of zeolite, and a ZSM-5 type of zeolite and which has a silica/alumina molar ratio of 200 or less, is mixed with 5-90 wt% inorganic binder to produce a support, and platinum/tin or platinum/lead is supported on the mixture support, thereby the catalyst is created.<br>
Meanwhile, the products 15 are present in a gaseous form at a relatively high temperature after the reactions are finished, are recycled into the heat exchanger 1 before they are fed into a gas-liquid separator 4, emit heat to the hydrogen/feedstock mixture therein, and fed into a cooler 5.<br>
A product stream 17 passing through the cooler 5 is fed into the gas-liquid separator 4 at about 30-50°C, and then separated into a gaseous component and a liquid component. The gaseous component is discharged in an overhead stream 19 from the gas-liquid separator 4, and the liquid component is discharged in a bottom stream 18 therefrom. In connection with this, the gaseous component 19 includes about 60-75 mol% hydrogen and 25-40 mol% hydrocarbon components, and the hydrocarbon components include methane, ethane, and LPG, which have relatively small numbers of carbon atoms.<br>
The overhead stream 19 is fed into the compression and fractionation unit 132 of the pyrolysis process, thereby being recycled 20. In coimection with this, a portion 21 of the overhead stream 19 is separated, compressed by a compressor 6, mixed with highly pure hydrogen 12,116 which is fed to control the purity of hydrogen, and fed in conjunction with the feedstock 11 into a reaction area. Alternatively, the entire overhead stream 20 is fed into the compression and fractionation unit 132. Particularly, if the entire overhead stream 20 is fed and recycled into the compression and fractionation unit 132 of the pyrolysis process, it is unnecessary to provide the compressor 6.<br>
Meanwhile, the liquid component 18, which is discharged in the bottom stream 18 consists mostly of aromatic components, and also includes residual hydrogen and light non-aromatic components in a small amount. Accordingly, the liquid component 18 is additionally subjected to a separation and purification process, and is separated into a residual hydrogen and non-aromatic component stream, and benzene 28, toluene 29, xylene 30, and C9+ aromatic compounds, which have purity of 99 % or more, using a<br><br>
difference in boiling point in a fractionation Unit 7.<br>
Meanwhile, as shown in FIGS. 2 and 3, the residual hydrogen and non-aromatic component stream 23, which is separated by the fractionation unit 7, may be mixed with a C2-C4 paraffin hydrocarbon stream 126 which is recycled into the pyrolysis furnace 131, and then used as a feedstock of the pyrolysis furnace.<br>
Particularly, if fluidized catalytic cracking gasolines 127 are used as a feedstock, as shown in FIG. 3, the fluidized catalytic cracking gasolines 127 are fed into the hy-drogenation and fractionation unit 134 of the pyrolysis process to convert/remove sulfur and nitrogen compounds from the fluidized catalytic cracking gasolines 127 through a reaction, and thne recycle into the process.<br>
Conventionally, extra hydrogen is required in the typical hydrocracking reaction, and residual hydrogen is used as a fuel in the process. However, in the present invention, residual hydrogen is recycled into the compression and fractionation unit of the process of pyrolyzing hydrocarbons, so that recycled hydrogen is used in a corresponding amount to consumed hydrogen, and extra hydrogen is recovered, thereby improvement is achieved.<br>
Furthermore, conventionally, the non-aromatic components which are rich in ethane and LPG components are used as a process fuel or are used to produce LPG products using an additional separation device. However, in the present invention, they are recycled into the compression and fractionation unit of the process of pyrolyzing hydrocarbons and an LPG separation device is provided in a pyrolysis device, thus it is possible to achieve improvement so that LPG is separated without the additional LPG separation device. As well, if the non-aromatic components which are rich in ethane and LPG components are recycled into the pyrolysis furnace and used as a feedstock of the pyrolysis furnace, the production of light olefin hydrocarbons, such as ethylene, which are main products of the pyrolysis furnace, is increased.<br>
Additionally, gaseous products may be separated into ethane, propane, and butane through a separation device having a typical distillation column, or created in an ethane/propane/butane mixture state. Alternatively, they may be created while they contain hydrogen, and hydrogen may be recovered through an integrated process including the process for producing light olefin hydrocarbons, such as the pyrolysis process. Furthermore, there is an advantage in that, if the gaseous products are obtained in the ethane/propane/butane mixture form or as separate components and are completely or partially used as the feedstock of the pyrolysis furnace, it is possible to increase the production of light olefin hydrocarbons in the pyrolysis process.<br>
