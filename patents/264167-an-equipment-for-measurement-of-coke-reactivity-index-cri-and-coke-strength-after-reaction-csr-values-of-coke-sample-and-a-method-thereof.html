BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an equipment for carrying out CRI-CSR test to Blast<br>
Furnace coke sample for repeatable and consistent results and a method<br>
thereof. And more precisely the present invention relates to the design and<br>
development of the equipment for measurement of CRI and CSR indices of coke<br>
and the method based on typical design of a reaction vessel and furnace in<br>
particular to achieve uniform reaction conditions and other process parameters.<br>
The CRI-CSR test on coke is performed all over the world for the measurements<br>
of hot properties like Coke Reactivity Index (CRI) and Coke Strength after<br>
Reaction (CSR). The methodology of testing is already defined worldwide and<br>
followed by our country as well.<br>
2.	DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
Metallurgical coke traditionally is used in the blast furnace as a fuel to provide<br>
heat to meet the exothermic requirements of chemical reactions and melting of<br>
the slag and metal, a producer and regenerator of reducing gases for the<br>
reduction of iron oxides, and an agent to provide permeability for gas flow and<br>
support for furnace burden. Because of the many requirements placed on coke, it<br>
must meet stringent requirements of strength, size, and composition. The carbon<br>
content should be maximized. As a regenerator of reducing gas the coke should<br>
have minimum reactivity to carbon dioxide and water vapor.<br>
The purpose of the CRI test is to give insight into the ability of CO2 to react with<br>
the carbon in the coke, a necessary reaction in the blast furnace but which must<br><br>
be controlled to prevent carbon from being consumed prematurely in the indirect<br>
reduction zone of BF. The CSR test provides information about two different<br>
issues; 1) the strength of coke after reacting with CO2, and 2) the amount of dust<br>
produced by CO2- Fine dust can be detrimental in the blast furnace since it can<br>
decrease the permeability of the bed requiring increased blast pressure to force<br>
the air up through the bed.<br>
CRI-CSR test on coke is performed all over the world for the measurements of<br>
hot properties like Coke Reactivity Index (CRI) and Coke Strength after Reaction<br>
(CSR). The methodology of testing is already defined, which is followed in our<br>
country as well. However the philosophy behind this test is not available in the<br>
literature. This is indeed a matter of further investigation and research work to<br>
correctly establish the basis of the experimental procedure for evolution of CRI<br>
and CSR values of coke. Moreover the design of reaction furnace and other<br>
accessories are also not available and widely vary in design and dimensions.<br>
Coke is essentially a high carbon content, high calorific value, clean burning fuel<br>
used primarily in iron-making blast furnaces and other industrial applications. It is<br>
made from metallurgical grade coal, which is heated in the absence of air in large<br>
slotted ovens. Volatile matter is driven off, leaving fixed carbon.<br>
Repeatable experiments employing the testing equipment are very difficult to<br>
perform with representative coke samples to evaluate coke CRI and CSR values.<br>
Focus has been given on the reaction conditions like accuracy of the temperature<br>
for maintaining isothermal temperature regime, constant flow of gas all through<br>
the coke samples, hermetically sealed reaction vessel, coke packing inside the<br>
furnace etc, during design and development of the equipment.<br>
ITAGAKI SHOZO and others of NIPPON KOKAN KK in a Japanese specification<br>
JP61110057 discloses an automatic measuring apparatus for strength of coke<br>
after hot reaction to enable automatic measurement, by arranging equipments<br><br>
three- dimensionally in a sample adjuster so that, samples automatically flow in<br>
the order of process with an automatic control mechanism interlocking a sensor<br>
or the like while robots are set in a hot CO2 reaction unit to handle a series of<br>
works.<br>
Standard testing procedures for cokes to qualify them for use in blast furnaces<br>
have been developed over the years, as the science and art of blast furnace<br>
operation and the requirements of coke have become better understood. Prior to<br>
1993, standard coke tests included proximate analysis to determine chemical<br>
composition, drop shatter and tumbler tests to determine strength, and specific<br>
gravity and porosity tests to measure structural characteristics. None of these<br>
tests were performed under conditions that the coke might encounter in the blast<br>
furnace, such as a harsh chemical environment, high pressure, and high<br>
temperature. In recent years, the Japanese steel industry developed a procedure<br>
that tests coke strength and breakdown to CO2 attack under blast furnace<br>
conditions. In 1993, this test was adopted as an ASTM standard test for coke as<br>
ASTM D 5341-93 entitled Standard Test Method for Measuring Coke Reactivity<br>
Index (CRI) and Coke Strength after Reaction (CSR).<br>
The joint CSR/CRI test heats a bed of coke in a nitrogen atmosphere to 1100<br>
degree Celsius in 30 minutes, reacts the coke sample in a flow of CO2 for 120<br>
minutes with the bed temperature constant at 1100 degree Celsius, cools the<br>
sample to 100 degree Celsius, transfers the sample to a tumbler, and tumbles<br>
the sample for 600 revolutions in 30 minutes. The sample is then sieved in a [3/8]<br>
inch sieve. The CSR is calculated as the remaining portion in the sieve compared<br>
to the amount removed from the furnace.	<br><br>

problems of the prior art. Methods are provided for carrying out CRI-CSR test.<br>

descriptive matter in which there is illustrated preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
FIG. 1 is a schematic drawing of the equipment for measurement of CRI and<br>
CSR values of BF coke sample.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The equipment for measurement of CRI and CSR values of blast furnace coke<br>
sample as disclosed in the present invention as illustrated in FIGS. 1 includes<br>
CO2 cylinder (A), N2 cylinder (B), a gas drier (C), electronic controlled flow meter<br>
(D) and a gas burner (K). The reaction unit includes a hermetically sealed vessel<br>
with top (H), a coke container cage (G), a cage heating system (I), a gas pre-<br>
heater / distributor (E), a furnace (F) and a thermocouple (J). The different units<br>
and their functionalities are described in detail hereinafter. <br>
The CRI / CSR equipment has been designed, fabricated and installed in Coal<br>
Carbonization Laboratory Group of Coke and Coal Division in RDCIS. During the<br>
initial design stage, there were various problems associated with the<br>
measurement of CRI and CSR values of the coke samples. The data generated<br>
that of CRI and CSR values were very inconsistent. In view of above,<br>
stochiometric calculations, for the material balance has been done to ensure the<br>
main process parameter like quantitative requirement of gas flow, contact time,<br>
void fraction, tortuosity factor, and Reynolds criteria. The reaction vessel in which<br>
the reaction of coke carbon with CO2 is taking place has also been modified and<br>
designed to ensure proper coke - carbon dioxide (C - CO2) interaction in the<br>
stipulated time frame of two hours. The design of the reaction vessel has been<br>
done incorporating the voids (tortuosity factor) generated by the coke of +19 -21<br>
mm size. The design of the reaction vessel like diameter, length, heating zone,<br>
gas outlet zone, gas heating zone, gas pre-heater pipe, gas distributor etc. have<br>
been calculated to ensure consistent coke carbon reaction in the presence of<br>
CO2, to generate CRI and CSR values of coke.<br>
Special cage (G) has been designed to keep 200 grams of coke keeping in view<br>
the effective gas utilization with respect to CO2. No channel effect of gas is<br>
possible with the specially designed cage for 200 grams of coke mass (+19 - 21<br>
mm size) since the coke particles are placed inside the cage in a uniform manner<br>
prior to the charging of reaction vessel (H). The cage is subjected to a reaction<br><br>
vessel at 1100 degree Celsius under the flow of CO2 gas passed at the rate of 5<br>
liters per minute for a duration of 2 hours. <br>
The CO2 gas pre-heater (E) has also been designed to incorporate maximum<br>
heat transfer from the furnace to the gaseous medium at the rate of 5 liters per<br>
minute. During the reaction, the heat is rapidly transferred from bottom to the top<br>
zone of the coke bed because of the upwardly flow of heated CO2 gas. This may<br>
result in an inverse temperature gradient, where the bottom coke temperature<br>
becomes lower than the top coke particles and thus may affect the reaction<br>
kinetics drastically. This may eventually cause the bottom most coke particles to<br>
react less than that at the top. So as to avoid and minimize this effect to the<br>
extent possible, the furnace has been divided into two zones in a fashion to<br>
control the lower and upper portion of the coke bed separately through PID<br>
heating control.<br>
Heat transfer during the reaction at 1100 degree Celsius (at the coke bed) from<br>
the furnace (F), (at higher temperature than 1100 Degree Celsius) to the heating<br>
wall of the reaction vessel (H) is taking place maximum by radiation followed by<br>
convection and conduction. The rate of heat transfer from the silicon carbide<br>
heating element in the furnace has been found maximum with the specially<br>
designed heating system with cage type groove (I) on the refractory walls of the<br>
furnace. Cage type groove will facilitate less heat absorption by the refractory<br>
lining, while more heat transfer would take place towards the wall of the reaction<br>
vessel. In this way, the life of the heating elements is prolonged extensively and<br>
the heating of the reaction vessel is ensured to the maximum efficiency for<br>
obtaining consistent and uniform gas-solid reaction between coke carbon and<br>
carbon dioxide at 1100 degree Celsius.<br>
The gas flow meter fluctuations, which were taking place during the reactions is<br>
also eliminated through a specially designed electronic flow controller / meter (D)<br><br>
connected with a distributor for ensuring uniform and consistent flow during the<br>
entire period of the reaction time of preferably two hours.<br>
The weight loss of the coke during the reaction can be verified by the gas output<br>
stochiometry with the help of quantitative determination of the total gas evolved<br>
during reaction. This will ensure uniform reaction rate of carbon reaction during<br>
entire span of the test period.The reacted coke sample is weighed for calculating<br>
the weight loss of coke and the percent weight loss is termed as coke reactivity<br>
index.<br>
In addition, the furnace performance can be judged by means of indicator of the temperature located at three point, out of which one is placed in the vicinity of the coke<br>
charge inside the cage in the reaction vessel i.e. (thermocouple (J) and two<br>
numbers are connected to the furnace at the upper and the lower part of the coke<br>
bed heating zone.<br>
Thereafter the reacted coke sample is further subjected to l-type drum for<br>
measuring abrasions resistance of coke after reaction. The drum rotates at 20<br>
rpm for 30 minutes (total 600 revolutions). Coke is taken out from the drum and<br>
passed through 10 mm sieve. The percentage of +10 mm fraction of coke<br>
remained is termed as coke strength after reaction.<br>
Several experiments have been carried out with coke samples using the<br>
aforesaid equipment at SAIL premises. Repeatability has been established with<br>
three consecutive test with the same coke samples A B and C. Table 1 shows<br>
the summary of the conducted with the equipment designed for the sake of<br>
evaluating values of Blast Furnace coke. The following Example is intended<br>
solely to illustration purposes not limiting the scope of present invention.<br><br><br>
The above-described embodiments of the invention are intended to be examples<br>
of the present invention. Numerous modifications changes and improvements<br>
within the scope of the invention will occur to the reader. Those of skill in the art<br>
