				<td>Field of invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a kit for semiquantification of the level of C- reactive protein<br>
(CRP) using whole blood and its process of manufacture. The invention also relates to a process<br>
for semiquantification of the level of C- reactive protein (CRP) using whole blood using the kit<br>
of the invention.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
C- reactive protein is a homopentameric, classical acute phase plasma protein, synthesised in<br>
large amount due to tissue damage or infection. CRP level increases in most cases of<br>
inflammatory diseases, allograft rejection, malignancy, necrosis. Hence elevated CRP is a<br>
sensitive universal index of acute infection as well as noninfectious inflammation. At present<br>
time elevated CRP is used as novel clinical markers of vascular wall inflammation.<br>
Traditionally it has been used to clinically monitor infection and autoimmune disorder. Many<br>
immunochemical methods for the estimation of CRP in the human blood have been devised like<br>
capillary tube immunoprecipitation, single radial immunodiffusion, passive latex agglutination,<br>
rocket immunoelectrophoresis, nephalometric assay, imrnunofiuorornetric assay, radioimmuno<br>
assay, and ELISA using blood serum<br>
All the above methods used blood serum for determination of CRP level. They involved<br>
complicated processes of separation of the serum from the cells. Moreover they had to be done<br>
immediately and involved specially trained technical staff to handle the processing of blood and<br>
estimation of CRP levels.<br>
Objects of the Invention<br>
Thus the basic object of the present invention is to provide for a kit to measure the level of CRP<br>
in blood samples using whole blood which would avoid the prior art problems in estimation<br>
involving blood serum as discussed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide for a simple process of manufacture of a kit<br>
to measure the level of CRP in blood samples using whole blood.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide for a process of estimation of C-reactive<br>
protein (CRP) using whole blood which would be fast and convenient to carry out.<br>
A further object is to provide for a simpler method of semiquantification of CRP in the blood.<br>
Another object is to provide for a kit for semiquantification of CRP in the blood which would<br>
have a shelf life of about 6 months at about 4° C.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
Thus according to one aspect of the present invention there is provided a kit for use in semi<br>
quantification of CRP present in whole blood sample comprising :<br>
i) conjugate reagent;<br>
ii) buffer;<br>
iii) multiple well haemagglutination plate;<br>
iv) standard curve.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for manufacture<br>
of kit comprising providing<br>
i) the conjugate reagent;<br>
ii) the buffer<br>

iv) the standard curve<br>
According to further aspect of the present invention there is provided a process for semi<br>
quantification of CRP in whole blood using the kit of invention comprising:<br>
i) incubating patient's blood with various concentrations of the conjugate for agglutination<br>
of CRP<br>

Detailed Description of Invention<br>
The kit and its process of manufacture enables semiquantification of CRP in whole blood<br>
following the process of invention for the same is a simpler way than those known in the art. It<br>
avoids the separation of blood serum since the whole blood is used for the process using the kit<br>
of the invention. Moreover the kit of invention has shelf life of 6 months when maintained at 4°C<br>
which enables easy operation of the kit without maintenance of any complicated conditions.<br>
The conjugate reagent of the kit of the present invention comprises crosslinked monovalent<br>
Concanvalin A and Fab portion of anti CRP antibody present in a molar ratio of 3:1 to 1:3,<br>
preferablyl: 1 in which the monovalent Concanvalin A is a limited trypsin digestion product of<br>
tetravalent Concanvalin A and the Fab portion of anti-CRP antibody is preferably obtained from<br>
goat serum. This conjugate reagent is adapted to agglutinise CRP present in blood to be tested.<br>
The multiple well haemagglutination plate of the said kit comprises 'U' bottom wells which are<br>
preferably 96 in number.<br>
The buffer used in the kit is phosphate buffer saline having a pH of 7.4<br>
The standard curve provided with the kit comprises the end points of agglutination between<br>
various concentrations of conjugate reagent from a batch of conjugate reagent obtained from a<br>
particular lot of goat anti-CRP antibody and CRP from sample blood plotted with CRP<br>
concentration as X- axis and conjugate concentration as Y-axis.<br>
According to another aspect the process for manufacture of kit comprises preparation of the<br>
conjugate reagent by mixing monovalent Concanvalin A and Fab portion of anti CRP antibody in<br>
a molar ratio of 3:1 to 1:3, preferably 1:1 in PBS and conjugating with EDC followed by<br>
incubation for 18 hours in dark room with continuous stirring and dialyzing and centrifuging the<br>
conjugate product.<br>
The Concanvalin A provided in the conjugate reagent is prepared by limited tryptic digestion of<br>
tetravalent Con A bounded to malatmyl-affinity matrices, elution by 0.1 M to 0.5M , preferably<br>
0.2 M glucose followed by purification of monovalent Con A by gel filtration. On the other hand<br>
the Fab fragment of anti-CRP antibody provided in the conjugate reagent is prepared by<br>
purification of goat serum containing medium titre of anti-CRP antibody by ammonium sulphate<br>
fractionation and ion exchange chromatography followed by papain digestion of flow through<br>
part of chromatography containing high titre of anti-CRP separating the Fab part which is then<br>
purified by protein affinity chromatography or by gel permeation chromatography.<br>
The kit is calibrated by mixing various known concentrations of the said conjugate reagent and<br>
CRP from test blood along with fixed amount of washed RBC to note the end of agglutination<br>
between conjugate reagent and CRP. Such end points of agglutination between various<br>
concentrations of conjugate and CRP are plotted using CRP concentration as X- axis and<br>
Conjugate concentration as Y-axis to form the standard curve provided with the kit.<br>
The process for semi quantification of CRP in whole blood is based on agglutination of the<br>
whole of patient's blood with the conjugate reagent and noting the concentration of conjugate<br>
reagent at which agglutinisation occurred. From the standard curve provided with the kit the<br>
amount of CRP present in patient's blood is then detected. The level of CRP detected by this<br>
process lies between 0.5 to 60 jag/ml. Thus the amount of CRP in patient's blood is determined<br>
from the standard curve or from concentration of conjugate required for agglutination.<br>
The invention shall now be discussed with reference to non limiting examples<br>
Example 1:<br>
Process of preparation of kit<br>
As discussed above the kit of the invention comprises:<br>
conjugate reagent; buffer; multiple well haemagglutination plate; standard curve.<br>
The conjugate used in the kit is prepared by mixing monovalent Concanvalin A and Fab portion<br>
of anti CRP antibody in a molar ratio of 1:1 in PBS and conjugating with EDC followed by<br>
incubation for 18 hours in dark room with continuous stirring. The conjugated product was<br>
extensively dialysed and centrifuged at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes to remove the particulate<br>
materials and the reagent is ready.<br>
The Concanvalin A provided in the conjugate reagent is prepared by limited tryptic digestion of<br>
teravalent Con A bounded to malatmyl-affinity matrices, elution by 0.2 M glucose followed by<br>
purification of monovalent Con A by gel filtration. The Fab fragment of anti-CRP antibody<br>
provided in the conjugate reagent is prepared by purification of goat serum containing medium<br>
titre of anti-CRP antibody by ammonium sulphate fractionation and ion exchange<br>
chromatography followed by papain digestion of flow through part of chromatography<br>
containing high titre of anti-CRP separating the Fab part which is then purified by affinity<br>
chromatography or by gel permeation chromatography.<br>
The multiple well haemagglutination plate of the said kit comprises 'U' bottom wells which are<br>
preferably 96 in number.<br>
The buffer used in the kit is phosphate buffer saline having a pH of 7.4<br>
The kit is calibrated by mixing various known concentrations of the said conjugate reagent and<br>
CRP from test blood : conjugate reagent (3.48 to 4.87 mg/ml), CRP (0.48 to 62.50 µg/ml) along<br>
with fixed amount of washed RBC (5µl) to note the end of agglutination between conjugate<br>
reagent and CRP. Such end points of agglutination between various concentrations of conjugate<br>
and CRP are plotted using CRP concentration as X- axis and Conjugate concentration as Y-axis<br>
to form the standard curve provided with the kit.<br>
Example 2<br>
The process for semi quantification of CRP in whole blood is based on agglutination of the<br>
whole of patient's blood with the conjugate reagent and noting the concentration of conjugate<br>
reagent at which agglutinisation occurred. From the standard curve provided with the kit the<br>
amount of CRP present in patient's blood is then detected.<br>
i) Calibration:<br>
1-5 µl of washed RBC from healthy donor is taken and mixed with different concentration of<br>
CRP and various dilutions of conjugate reagent in a total reaction volume of 100 µl in 96 wells<br>
of the kit. The conjugate reagent used is prepared as in example 1. The mixture is incubated for<br>
45-60 minutes. For each concentration of CRP and 5µl of washed RBC the end point dilution<br>
was measured where agglutination just ended.:<br>
Table 1 provides the conjugate concentration which agglutinise various CRP concentrations<br>
Table 1<br>
The values from Table 1 were plotted and a standard curve was obtained with CRP concentration<br>
as X- axis and conjugate concentration as Y-axis.<br>
ii) Determination of CRP in patient's blood<br>
5µ1 of patient's blood sample was taken in 6 different wells of 96 well haemagglutination plate<br>
of the kit.<br>
50µl of buffer is added to the first well to serve as control.<br>
Conjugate reagent added to the other wells in an amount of 35 to 50 µl<br>
Volume of each well made up to 55µ1 with buffer<br>
Incubated for 30-45 minutes till button formation in control well<br>
Conjugate concentration is noted at which complete agglutination occurs which is 2 to 8 mg/ml.<br>
From the dilution of conjugate the CRP concentration is determined using the standard curve<br>
provided.<br>
Thus the process of semiquantification of CRP using the kit of the invention is a simple method<br>
in which whole blood is used. It is a faster method without the complication of separation of<br>
serum from whole blood. Thus the invention is directed to provide a ready kit for such<br>
semiquantification of CRP.<br>
