AMBIENT PRESSURE FUEL CELL SYSTEM EMPLOYING PARTIAL AIR<br>
HUMIDIFICATION<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
5	This application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application<br>
No. 60/451,943 filed March 3, 2003, where this provisional application is incorporated<br>
herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
10	The present invention relates to fuel cell systems operating at or near<br>
ambient pressure. In particular, the present invention relates to fuel cell systems operating<br>
at or near ambient pressure with partial air humidification, and methods of operating such<br>
systems.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
15	Fuel cells are known in the art.   Fuel cells electrochemically react a fuel<br>
stream comprising hydrogen and an oxidant stream comprising oxygen to generate an<br>
electric current. Fuel cell electric power plants have been employed in transportation,<br>
portable and stationary applications.<br>
Water management issues are critical in polymer electrolyte membrane<br>
20 (PEM) fuel cell operation. Humidification of the membrane is required to maintain optimal<br>
performance. As the water content of the membrane falls it loses the ability to transport<br>
protons, its electrical resistance increases, and fuel cell performance decreases and<br>
membrane failure may occur. To ensure adequate humidification of the membrane the<br>
reactant streams supplied to the fuel cell stack are typically humidified. At the same time,<br>
1<br><br>
WO 2004/079269	PCT/CA2004/000320<br>
In other embodiments, the present fuel cell system comprises: a fuel cell<br>
stack with fuel cells having a cathode gas diffusion barrier means; a fuel system for<br>
supplying a fuel to the stack; supply means for supplying air to the stack at near-ambient<br>
pressure; humidification means for transferring water vapor from the cathode exhaust<br>
5 stream with the air supplied to the stack; and, a coolant loop for circulating a liquid coolant<br>
through the stack.<br>
The present fuel cell system may be part of a power plant for use in<br>
vehicles; as part of a cogeneration system for stationary applications; or as part of a<br>
generator for portable power, back-up power orUPS applications.<br>
10	In  some  embodiments,   the  present  method   comprises:   supplying  a<br>
stoichiometric excess of air to the stack at near-ambient pressure; supplying a cathode<br>
exhaust stream to a humidification device; maintaining the relative humidity of the air<br>
stream below a stack inlet saturation point; maintaining the relative humidity of the cathode<br>
exhaust stream below a stack inlet saturation point; and, operating the stack at a<br>
15    temperature greater than about 75Â°C.<br>
