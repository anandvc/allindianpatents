				<td>Process for the preparation of ketlmines<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of ketimines, which are suitable as starting materials for the preparation of phamnaceutical active ingedients having antidepressant properties, for example sertraline.<br>
Processes for the preparation of ketimines are described, for example, in US-A-4 536 518 and US-A-4 855 500.<br>
The process for the preparation of ketimines disdosed in US-A-4 536 518 (columns 9/10. Example 1 (F)) comprises reaction of the ketone in an aprotic solvent, for example tetrahydrofuran. with methylamine in the presence of titanium tetrachloride, with cooling. A disadvantage of that process is the need to work vinth tetrahydrofuran, which is readily combustible, and with titanium tetrachloride, which is not innocuous from an ecological standpoint. In addition, the procedure is expensive, because the reaction is canied out with cooling. A further disadvantage of the process concerns the worthing up. The product has to be precipitated with additional hexane.<br>
The process for the preparation of ketimines disclosed in US-A-4 855 500 (columns 5/6, daim 1 ] comprises reaction of the ketone in an aprotic solvent, for example methylene chloride, toluene or tetrahydrofuran, with anhydrous methylamine in the presence of molecular sieve, with cooling.<br>
That process, too, has the disadvantage of the need to work, under anhydrous conditions, with solvents that are not innocuous from an ecological standpoint, such as methylene chloride, or with readily combustible solvents, such as tetrahydrofuran. The molecular sieve used is expensive and has to be recycled in an additional step. A further disadvantage of the process Is that the molecular sieve needs to be removed and the product has to be precipitated with additional hexane.<br>
US-A-5 019 655 describes a one-step process for the preparation of 4-dichlorophenyl-l-tetralones having a degree of purity of from 98 to 99 %, It is disclosed that a plurality of recrystallisation operations are required at the ketone stage, using large amounts of solvents, in order to achieve a degree of purity &gt; 99.5 %.<br>
The need therefore exists for the discovery of an efficient process for the preparation of Ketimines that does not have the above-listed disadvantages, especially in relation to the solvents and recrystallisation steps used.<br><br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the desired degree of purity of ketimines can t&gt;e achieved by carrying out the recrystallisation at the imine stage and using sertralone, precipitated in cnjde form, in the imine synthesis. At the same time high yields are achieved, and substantially smaller amounts of solvents are sufficient for the recrystallisation.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates to a process for the preparation of compounds of fomnula<br><br><br>
with methylamine. in a suitable solvent, to form a sertraline-imine isomeric mixture consisting of from 75 to 95 % of formula (la) and from 5 to 25 % of formula<br><br><br><br>

11 is furthermore possible for further solubilising or solubility-inhibiting additives (e.g. toluene, cyclohexane) to be added.<br>
The present process may optionally be carried out in the presence of a catalyst. Preferred catalysts for the process for the preparation of compounds of fonnula (1) are protonic acids, Lewis acids, aluminium silicates, ion exchange resins, zeolites, naturally occurring layer<br>
silicates and modified layer silicates.<br>
Protonic acids are prefered.<br>
Suitable protonic adds include, for example, acids of inorganic or organic salts, e.g. hydrochloric add; sulfuric add; phosphoric acid or sulfonic acids, for example methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid or camphor-10-sulfonic acid.<br>
A suitable Lewis acid is, for example, scandium tristriflate [Sc(0Tf)3].<br>
Suitable aluminium silicates indude, for example, those widely used in the petrochemical industry and referred to also as amorphous aluminium silicates. Such compounds contain approximately from 10 to 30 % silicon dioxide and from 70 to 90 % aluminium oxide.<br>
Suitable ion exchange resins indude, for example, styrene-divinylbenzene resins that in addition carry sulfonic add groups, e.g. Amberfite 200* and Miberiyst* from Rohm and Haas and Dowex 50* from Dow Chemicals; perfluorinated ion exchange resins, e.g. NafionH* from DuPont; and other superaddic ion exchange resins as described by T. Yamaguchi, Applied Catalysis, 61,1-25 (1990) or M. Hino etal., J. Chem. Soc, Chem, Commun. 1980. 851-852.<br>
Suitable zeolites indude, for example, those that are widely used in the petrochemical industry as cracking catalysts and that are known in the form of crystalline silicon-aluminium oxides having various crystal structures. Special preference is given to the faujasites from Union Carbide, e.g. Zeolite X", Zeolite Y* and Ultrastable Zeolite Y*, Zeolite Beta* and Zeolite ZSM-12* from Mobil Oil Co. and Zeolite Mordenit* from Norton.<br>
Suitable naturally occuning layer silicates are also called "acid earths" and indude, for example, bentonites and montmorillonites which, on an industrial scale, are broken down, ground, treated with mineral acids and caldned. Espedally suitable naturally occurring layer silicates are the Fulcat* types from Laporte Adsorbents Co., e.g. Fulcat 22A*, Fulcat 22B*, Fulcat 20*, Fulcat 30* and Fulcat 40*; and the Fulmont* types from Laporte Adsorbents Co., e.g. Fulmont XMP-3* and Fulmont XMP-4*. An espedally preferred catalyst for the process<br><br>
according to the invention is Fulcat 22B . The other Fulcat* types and Fulmont* types are likewise to be classified in that preferred group, however, because only slight differences exist between the individual types, such as, for example, the number of acid centres.<br>
Modified layer silicates are also called "pillared clays* and are derived from the above-described naturally occurring layer silicates, comprising in addition, between the silicate layers, oxides of, for example, zirconium, iron, zinc, nickel, chromium, cobalt or magnesium. That type of catalyst is widely mentioned in the literature, e.g. as described by J. Clark et a/., J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Com. 1989.1353-1354, but is manufactured by only very Jew companies. Especially preferred modified layer silicates include, for example, Envirocat EPZ-10*. Envirocat EPZG* and Envirocat EPIC* from Contract Chemicals.<br>
Special preference is given to a process for the preparation of compounds of fomiula (la) wherein the catalyst is a sulfonic acid, especially p-toluenesulfonic acid, meUianesulfonic acid orcamphor-10-sulfonic acid.<br>
The molar ratio of the amount of catalyst used to the amount of methylamine used is advantageously from 0.001:1 to 1:1, especially from 0.01:1 to 0.5:1, e.g. from 0.05:1 to 0.1:1.<br>
A molar ratio of the amount of catalyst to the amount of methylamine of 1:1 means that the methylamine can be used In the process according to the invention also in the form of a salt, e.g. methylamine hydrochloride.<br>
The reaction steps (A,) and (A2) are preferably carried out at a temperature of from 20 to ISCC, especially from 30 to 100Â°C, where appropriate under slight pressure.<br>
The proportion of starting compounds in the reaction mixture is in the range from 5 to 70 % by weight, preferably from 30 to 60 % by weight.<br>
Especially preferably, the reaction is carried out using a large molar excess of methylamine.<br>
Special preference is therefore given to a process for the preparation of compounds of formula (la) wherein the molar ratio of the amount of compound of formula (2a and 2b) to the amount of methylamine is from 1:1 to 1:1000, especially from 1:1.05 to 1:50. e.g. from<br>
1:1.5 to 1:15.<br>
The methylamine can be used in the form of methylamine gas or in the form of a solution in an appropriate solvent.<br><br>
Of special interest is a process variant in which the reaction can be carried out in pure methylamine under pressure, that compound being used simultaneously as solvent and<br>
reagent.<br>
Also of special interest is a process for (he preparation of ccwripounds of formula (la) wherein the compound is continuously crystallised out of the reaction medium to a varying extent during the preparation process and subsequently filtered off.<br>
Also of special interest is a process for the preparation of compounds of formula (la) wherein the filtrate is used in a further reaction for the preparation of compounds of formula (la). In that procedure the consumed amounts of the compound of formula (2a) and of methylamine are replenished. Preference is given to from 2 to 10 filtrate-recycling operations.<br>
The process according to the invention is accordingly suitable as a continuous process for the preparation of compounds of formula (1 a).<br>
The water formed during the pnacess can optionally be bound to an additional water binder, for example a molecular sieve or ortho ester, e.g. orthoformic acid trimethyl ester.<br>
For isolation of non-enriched sertraline-imine isomeric mixtures (reaction route A,), when the reaction is complete the solvent Is distilled off, or methylamine or other gaseous amines are released, and the residue obtained is dried.<br>
For isolation of enriched sertraline-imine isomeric mixtures (A2), the reaction mass is cooled, the suspension is filtered, and the filter cake is washed with the solvent. The product is then dried.<br>
The solvents used for recrystallisation (B) are selected from<br>
(a)	Ci-C24amines,<br>
(b)	Ci-Ci;nitriles,<br>
(c)	C2-C24carboxyiic acid esters,<br>
(d)	Cs-Cg^ortho esters,<br>
(e)	C2-C24ethers,<br>
(f)	Ci-C24alkanes, especially C6-C24a(kanes.<br>
(g)	aromatic solvents,<br>
(h)	amides,<br>
(i)      sulfoxides.<br><br><br>
Representative examples of that group of ketones include, e.g., aliphatically saturated ketones, e.g. propanone (acetone), butanone (methyl ethyl ketone) and 2-pentanone (methyl propyl ketone); cycioaliphatically saturated ketones, e.g. cyclopentanone, cyclohexanone and cycloheptanone (suberone); aliphatically unsaturated ketones, e.g. 3-buten-2-one, 1,4-pentadien-3-one, 3-pentyn-2-one; aromatic ketones, e.g. benzophenone; aromatic-aliphatic ketones, e.g. methyl phenyl ketone (acetophenone) and propiophenone; diketones, e.g. 2,3-butanedione, 2,4"pentanedione and 2,5-hexanedione; and aromatic diketones, e.g. diphenylethanedione (benzil). In an especially preferred embodiment, recrystallisation (B) is carried out from the same solvent as reaction (A,) or (Aa).<br>
The solvents employed in accordance with the invention may be used in the form of individual compounds or in the form of mixtures of two or more individual compounds from the same or different solvent groups (a) - (n).<br>
Recrystallisation (B) is preferably carried out by recrystallising the sertraline-imine isomeric mixture or the enriched sertraline-imine isomeric mixture under reflux. For that purpose the sertraline-imine obtained according to (A,) or (A2), in a suitable solvent, is introduced into a suitable reaction vessel fitted with a stirrer and a reflux condenser. The reaction mass is heated at reflux temperature in an inert gas atmosphere, with stirring, until a clear solution is obtained. The solution is cooled to the appropriate isolation temperature, the product slowly<br><br>
precipitating. The suspension is filtered, and the filter cake is washed with the solvent and dried. Isomericaily pure {&gt; 99.9 %) sertraline-imine of formula (1a) is obtained in a yield of from 80 to 90 %, having a sertralone content of from 0.1 to 0.3% (HPLC), a catalyst contamination of 
In a further process variant, recrystallisation (B) of the sertraline-imine isomeric mixture or of the enriched sertraline-imine isomeric mixture is carried out under pressure. For that purpose the sertraline-imine obtained by (Ai) or (Aa) and the solvent are introduced into a suitable pressurized reactor fitted with a stirrer. The reactor is sealed under a nitrogen atmosphere. The stirrer is started and the reaction mixture is heated at the desired reaction temperature until a clear solution is obtained. The solution is cooled to the appropriate isolation temperature, the product slowly precipitating. The suspension is filtered, and the filter cake is washed with the solvent and dried.<br>
The dissolution temperatures in the solvents selected are in the range from 30 to ISCC. preferably from 50 to 150Â°C and most preferably from 70 to 120""C.<br>
According to the boiling points of the solvents listed, recrystallisation (B) can be carried out at normal pressure under reflux, or at elevated pressure, generally in the range from 0 to 10 bar, preferably from 0 to 3 bar.<br>
The cooling gradients are In the range from 0.005 to lO^C/min., preferably from 0.05 to 10Â°C/min and most preferably from 0.1 to I^C/min..<br>
The isolation temperatures are in the range from -20 to 40*C, preferably from 0 to 25""C.<br>
The concentrations of sertraline-imine in the clear solution are in the range from 5 to 40 % by weight, preferably from 15 to 20 % by weight.<br>
Adsorbents such as activated charcoal or adsorber resins may be added during the procedure for the purpose of removing impurities that impart colour. Such substances are added in amounts of from 1 to 10 % of the clear solution and are removed, while hot, by filtration prior to the crystallisation procedure.<br>
By means of the recrystallisation, it is possible both to improve the product purity and to remove impurities that interfere with the further reaction, such as water or catalyst residues.<br>
The present invention relates also to a process for the preparation of optically pure (cis)-and/or (trans)-sertraline or enantiomerically enriched mixtures of (cis)- and (trans)-sertraline. The process comprises the following reaction steps (1) to (111):<br><br>
(I)	reaction of an isomeric mixture, consisting of from 75 to 95 % of formula (2a) and from 25 to 5 % respectively of formula {2b), to form the sertraline-imine of formula (la), corresponding to the process according to claim 1,<br>
(II)	subsequent cis-selective hydrogenation using noble metal catalysts or other catalysts based on copper or nickel, to form cis-sertraline-enriched mixtures of racemic cis- and trans-sertraline,<br>
(III)	subsequent racemate cleavage based on mandelic acid for the selective preparation of the desired enantiomerically pure cis-isomer.<br>
Starting from crude sertraline-ketone (isomeric mixture of the compounds of formulae (2a) and (2b)), sertraline-imine is prepared in accordance with the process described in claim 1. The imine is converted to cis-sertraline-enriched mixtures of racemic cis- and trans-sertraline in a subsequent cis-selective hydrogenation using noble metal catalysts or other catalysts based on copper or nickel with a wide variety of supports, e.g. carbon, Alox, aluminium oxide, silica, calcium carbonate, barium carbonate, barium sulfate etc..<br>
The desired enantiomerically pure cis-isomer can be selectively crystallised in a subsequent racemate cleavage based on mandelic acid.<br>
The optically pure amine is freed using sodium hydroxide solution and, as a hydrochloride, is converted in suitable solvents into the desired polymorphous form.<br>
The following Examples illustrate the invention further. Parts or percentages relate to weight.<br>
Example 1 : Preparation of sertraline-imine isomeric mixture in ethanol 240 g of sertralone isomeric mixture (95 % 3,4-dichlorosertralone, 5 % 2,3-dichloro-sertraione) and 800 ml of ethanol are introduced into a suitable reaction vessel fitted with a stirrer and a gas inlet. The stirrer is started, the suspension is cooled to CC and 55 g of methylamine are introduced under the level of, that is to say below the surface of, the solvent. After the addition of TO ml of methanesulfonic acid (catalyst), the reaction mass is heated up and stirred for 3 hours at SCC and for 1 hour at TO"C. At ACC the reaction mass is concentrated to dryness by evaporation under reduced pressure and the product is isolated.<br>
Yield: 248 g of sertraline-imine in crude dry form having the following composition:<br><br>
87,8 %	3,4-dichlorosertraline-imine<br>
4.6	%	2,3-dichlorosertraline-imine 4.9 %	sertralone<br>
2.6	%	methanesulfonic acid derivatives and saUs.<br>
The original ratio of isomers remains unaltered. The yield of the imine is 95 %.<br>
Where a catalyst is used, it can be removed according to customary metfiods, such as ion exchange, adsorption or recrystallisation from solvents that do not have a tendency towards isomer enrichment.<br>
Example 2 : Preparation of serfa-aline-imJne Isomeric mixture with isomer enrichment in ethanol<br>
240 g of sertratone isomenc mixture (95 % 3,4-d(Chlorosertralone, 5 % 2,3-d(chlOfD-sertralone) and 800 ml of ethanol are introduced into a suitable reaction vessel fitted with a stin-er and a gas inlet. The stiver is started, the suspension is cooled to O"C and 55 g of methylamine are mtroduced under the level of. that is to say below the surface of, the solvent. After the addition of 10 mi of methanesulfonic add (catalyst), the reaction mass is heated up and stirred for 3 hours at SCC and for 1 hour at 70Â°C. The suspension is cooled to lO"C and filtered and the filter cake is washed writh cold ethanol. TTie product is dried in vacuo at elevated temperatures.<br>
