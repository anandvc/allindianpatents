				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to the field of seismic signal processing and more specifically to the processing issues involved in orientation of multi-component detectors (a.k.a. geophones). <br>
In the area of seismic signal processing, there has been a desire to analyze both shear (S-wave) and pressure (P-wave) data. For example, it has been discovered that S-waves do not respond to some hydrocarbon structures in the manner that P-waves respond. P-waves may reflect strongly at structures that are both water-containing, and therefore not economic for drilling, and hydrocarbon-containing. S-waves, on the other hand, will reflect strongly at many of the same water-structures as P-waves, but they do not reflect strongly at many of the hydrocarbon-containing structures. Therefore, comparison of S-wave displays and P-wave displays of a given structure helps in making decisions regarding which structures should be drilled-<br>
Further, some S-waves reflect differently at certain structures than other structures, which is another indication of rock properties in which an interpreter may be interested. Therefore, comparison of S-wave displays of different types and at different orientation angles is desired by interpreters. There arc many such differences, which are known to those of skill in the art. See, e.g., J.P. DiSiena, J.E. Gaiser, and D. Corrigan, 1981, Three-Component Verlical Seismic Profiles: orientation of Horizontal Components for Shear Wave Analysis. 51st Annual International Meeting, Society of Exploration Geophysicits, Expanded Abstracts, 1991-2011; R.H. Tatham and M.D. McCormack, 1991 Mulilcomponent Seismology in Petroleum Exploration. Society of Exploration Geophysicists; J.F. Arestad, R. Windels, and T.L. Davis, 1996, Azimuthal Analysis of 3-D Shear Wave Data, Joffre Field Alberta, Canada. 66th Annual International Meeting, Society of Exploration Geophysicists, Expanded Abstracts, 1563-1566; J.E. Gaiser, P.J. Fowler, and A.R. Jackson, 1997, Challenges for 3-D Converted-Wave Processing. 67"' Annual International Meeting, Society of Exploration Geophysicists, Expanded Abstracts, 1199-1202; R.R.

International Meeting, Society of Exploration Geophysicists, Expanded Abstracts, 1206-1209; and references cited therein; all of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
One of the ways of detecting the S-waves is with the use of so-called "multi-component" detectors. These geophones have sensors oriented to receive seismic signals from two horizontal directions (the in-line and the cross-line directions) and one vertical direction. Theoretically, a signal moving along the inline axis in the positive direction will generate a positive response on the in-line geophone component. The cross-line component will not respond at all to such a signal, nor will the vertical component. Likewise, a signal moving in the cross-line axis will generate a response at the cross-line geophone, but not on the other two components. Most signals, of course, travel at an angle to the cross-line and in-line directions, and they generate cross-line and in-line components whose amplitude is dependent upon the angle of incidence of the signal to the component. This is especially true in 3D (three dimensional) surveys where the source for some of the shots is not in-line with the receiving cable.<br>
For example, referring to Fig. 1, a simplified example of a 3D multi-component survey is seen, in which there are several sources S1 - S8 located around a single receiver R. As shown, the horizontal components H1 and H2 of the receiver R are oriented differently for each of the sources S1 - S8. Fig. 1 is illustrative only. An actual 3D geometry is, of course, more complex. Fig. 2 shows example synthetic data recorded on the two horizontal components of the geophones of Fig. 1. Each source generates an exponentially tapered sine wave whose initial amplitude is one, and the direction of the particle motion is in the geophone-source plane. From these 16 traces, it is seen that the amplitudes and polarity vary from trace to trace. Therefore, the amplitudes and polarity must be adjusted before any further processing is applied. To make the proper adjustments, there must be knowledge of the orientation of the horizontal components of the geophones; and, there is a need for a simple and effective method for determining that orientation.<br>
Interpreters normally require displays of data in at least two directions (the "radial" and "transverse" directions). The data must be corrected for variations in the orientation of the horizontal components, since the amplitude of the data recorded<br>
2<br><br>
from a particular component depends upon the angle of incidence of the signal to the component's direction of reception.<br>
In positioning of the multi-component receiver cables in the survey, ideally, the in-line orientation would all be known, as would the cross-line orientation. This is somewhat practical in land surveys where care in the layout of the cable is taken. It is also somewhat possible in marine "dragged array" surveys, where the cable is dragged in a particular direction after deployment, giving the multi-component geophones substantially the same orientation. However, in ocean-bottom surveys ("OBS") in which the receiver cable is not dragged, and in vertical seismic surveys where the geophones are placed in a well bore, the orientation is more random, or perhaps even reversed, due to the twisting and coiling of the cable during deployment. Further, even where the orientation is generally known, such as in land and dragged array surveys, the orientation is not perfect, and as much as a ten percent difference can exist between any two receivers. There is a need, therefore, for determining the orientation of multi-component receivers. See, e.g., DiSiena, et al., Three-Component Vertical Seismic Profiles: Orientation of Horizontal Components for Shear Wave Analysis, 1981 Society of Exploration Geophysics Annual Meeting Papers (also incorporated herein by reference).<br>
Earlier attempts at orientation determination include the so-called "hodogram" method described in the 1981 DiSiena paper cited above, in which the amplitude of the in-line component is plotted against the amplitude of the cross-line component. A line is then best-fit to the resulting set of points, which gives the direction of the components. However, this process has been found to be time consuming, and it fails to give the polarity of the waveform. As discussed above, where the orientation of the components is unknown, as in the non-dragged OBS cable or the VSP arrays, this is a serious drawback.<br>
Another method of determining the angle is also described in the 1981 DiSiena paper, in which a mathematical rotation of the components is performed until the energy seen in one of the components is maximized. Again, such a process is time-consuming, expensive, and cannot give the polarity information needed.<br>
Accordingly, there is a need for a simple, inexpensive, and fast method for determining the orientation of horizontal components of receivers.<br>
3<br><br>
The DiSiena et al. (1981) publication describes a method for determining the orientation of the horizontal component of a multicomponent geophone in a Vertical Seismic Profile. The method assumes linear polarization of the horizontal projection of the direct arrival of from a surface impulsive source. Then the polarization direction, same as the orientation direction, can be measured by analyzing the peaks in a histogram of the orientation angle. The subsequent linear coordinate transformation aligns the horizontal projection of the P-wave energy and the shear arrivals. DiSiena et al. (1981) state that orientation of the horizontal components allows for the simultaneous analysis at any depth of the vertical and horizontal signals, the total VSP wavefield, in the consistently-oriented coordinate frame.<br>
The Tatham and McCormack (1991) book, in a section on anisotropy at pages 152-159, describes the Alford rotation technique for determining the S-wave polarization directions of S-waves in an azimuthally anisotropic earth. The technique uses mixed mode SH-SV and SV-SH and pure mode SH-SH and SV-SV seismic data components. The technique searches for an angle that minimizes the signal energy of the mixed mode components and maximizes the signal energy of the pure mode components.<br>
The Arestad et al. (1996) publiication describes polarization and azimuthal analysis of shear wave data from a three-dimensional, multicomponent survey. The Joffre field data exhibit orthorhombic anisotropic effects, as identified by analysis of azimuth limited supergathers and polarization analysis of offset shear wave volumes. An azimuthally varying outside mute was applied to stack this shear wave data within the shear wave window and preserve relative amplitudes. Arestad et al. (1996) state that increasing the number of stackable traces in the usable offset range between the very strong surface wave train on the inside and the shear wave window on the outside will increase signal to noise ratios and data fidelity.<br>
The Gaiser et al. (1997) publication presents an overview of problems in applying conventional 2-D seismic processing techniques to P to S converted-wave (P-S) data. The unique properties of P-S wavefields (asymmetric source-receiver paths, horizontal polarization, and birefringence) present problems in realistic 3-D geometries.<br>
- 3A -<br><br>
Conventional wavefield separation and wavefield datuming are not readily applicable to most 3-D surveys with irregular geometries. Since two horizontal geophone receivers are necessary to accurately record the total P-S wavefield for 3-D surveys, it is preferable that both have an equivalent response to seismic motions. Differences between in-line and cross-line horizontal geophone signals in Ocean Bottom Cable surveys may be reduced by estimating and removing relative coupling responses. By providing a wide range of propagation directions, 3-D geometries may be beneficial for measuring azimuthal anisotropy in P-S data. Azimuthal stacks in orthogonal directions may provide the necessary components for Alford rotation and layer stripping without the need for approximation used in 2-D P-S data.<br>
The Van Dok et al. (1997) publication presents a case study of processing and interpolation of P to S converted-wave (P-S) seismic data. Van Dok et al. (1997) state that surface-consistent processing methodologies developed for land 3-D P-wave data may be adapted to P-S wave data by properly separating the source and receiver terms and attempting to preserve relative variations in amplitudes and travel times between the two horizontal components. Techniques used include surface-consistent deconvolution, surface-consistent statics, and common conversion-point (CCP) binning. By limiting source to receiver propagation azimuths, multiple data volumes may be obtained for subsequent Alford rotation, layer stripping, and anisotropy analysis.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXAMPLE EMBODIMENTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to various embodiment of the invention, a statistical method is used to determine the receiver orientation angle. In one such embodiment, referring now to Fig. 1, a maximum energy method is used to determine the actual angle of one of the horizontal components with respect to line between the source and the receiver. In one specific example that is useful in an embodiment of the invention, the data (Fig. 2) for H1 and H2 as a result of the activation of source S1 (Fig. 1) arc sampled in a window. The sample window includes an event that is presumed to be representative of a signal. In practice, the direct arrival from S1 is an event that has been found to be useful. However, a signal from a calibration shot is used in alternative embodiments of the invention, and the orientation angle determined with respect to a line between the receiver and the location of the calibration shot. Other events are used according to still further embodiments (for example, other "first break" events). In any case, the event used should have substantially uniform behavior for each of the traces sampled.<br>
In the example ambodiments of the direct arrival, about a 100 ms window is useful, sampled at between about 2ms and 4ms. The amplitude within the sample for both H1 and H2 is determined by any of the processes known to those of skill in the art for determination of amplitude within a sample. The amplitude of H1 is multiplied by cos(?), where (?) represents an angle of orientation of the receiver. In one example embodiment, ? is rotated through equal samples, and the calculation performed again. At the angle ?m where the total energy for H1 and H2 is at a maximum, the angle of orientation between a line between the receiver and the source and HI is found. To find this angle, H2 is multiplied by sin(?), and the energy at a particular angle E(?) is determined by taking the sum over the time sample of Hl(t)cos(?)+H2sin(?):<br>
E(?) = S, (Hl(t)cos(?)+H2sin(?))<br>
The energy is at a maximum where the partial derivative with respect to ?is zero:<br>
(E/(?= 0<br>
19<br><br>
Therefore, the angle of orientation at which E(?) is at a maximum is: ?m=(l/2)arctan(2 St(H1(t) H2(t))/St(Hl2(t)- H22(t)))<br>
?m is, therefore, the angle between the actual orientation of the horizontal component H1 and a line between the receiver and source. The source and receiver locations are known, and, therefore, though simple trigonometry, the actual orientation angle 6r of the geophone component is determined.<br>
Since the determination of the 8m for any single source-receiver pair is dependant upon signal-to-noise ratio, and sources of error, according to this aspect of the present invention multiple traces for the same receiver R (for example from sources S1 - S8 of Fig. 1) are used. The actual orientation for the receiver R's component H1 is determined statistically from the resulting set of measurements.<br>
Such statistical determination comprises, according to some example-embodiments, averaging the angles ?ml - ?m8 (after adjustment to take into account the relative position of sources S1 - S8), taking the mean of the data, or fitting the data in a least squares method. However, simple average, mean, or least-squares methods, are prone to error from bad data. Accordingly, in another embodiment of the invention, the ?m results are placed in a Gaussian distribution, or other distribution, in order to remove anomalous results. Examples of other distributions that arc useful according to the present invention include: exponentially weighted distributions, triangle distributions, and other distributions that will occur to those of skill in the art.<br>
The number of sources used in the determination of the orientation angle 6r for a particular receiver R is determined, according to another aspect of the invention, by the geometry of the survey. For some receivers, there will be more sources at an appropriate distance than with others. Further, there will be a more even distribution of sources around some receivers than others. It is desirable, therefore, according to one embodiment of the invention, to use between two and twelve sources. Two is the minimum to allow for statistical sampling techniques (although in some embodiments, without statistical sampling, only one is used), and over twelve there is a point of diminishing returns in the tradeoff between accuracy and cost. In most surveys a number between 4 and 8 is best.<br>
20<br><br>
In determining the distance between the sources used and the receiver, according to one embodiment, sources intermediate the nearest offset and the farthest offset are used, and the direct arrival is the event around which a sample window is placed. In the intermediate offsets, the direct arrival can be separated from other events (e.g. refractions, early reflections, and ghosts) according to methods known to those of skill in the art (for example, tau-p transforms, f-k, and velocity filler).<br>
A particular advantage of this aspect of the present invention is that the orientation angle determined by the above method is accurate for all traces from the same receiver R. Therefore, according to another aspect of the invention, having determined the orientation angle ?r from a limited number of traces from receiver R, the entire data set for receiver R is processed with one ?r, according to another aspect of the present invention.<br>
In order to produce a display of data along a single plane from differently oriented horizontal components, the traces received from a particular receiver must be modified to represent the signals that would have been recorded if the particular component (H1 or H2) were oriented along that particular plane. For example, as mentioned above, many interpreters desire to see a display of data in the "radial" plane including a line between the source and receiver. At the same time, a display orthogonal to the radial plane is also desired. Therefore, to produce those displays, the data for all traces from a particular receiver R, for all the time of the recording, is multiplied by a rotation function, dependant upon the orientation angle ?r. According to one embodiment, that rotation comprises application of the following functions:<br>
H1(t)=Hl(t)cos(?r) + H2(t)sin(?r) H2'(t)= - Hl(t)sin(?r) + H2(t)cos(?r)<br>
As a result of the rotation, a display in the radial direction should show reflections corresponding to the behavior of shear waves in the surveyed geology, while a display in the orthogonal direction should show noise. In the event that the orthogonal survey appears to show structure, there is an indication that anisotropic formations exist at the earliest point in time where the structure first appears.<br>
21<br><br>
According to a further embodiment of the present invention, rotated data, whether by the process described above or some other process, is corrected to remove polarity problems. According to this aspect of the invention, the direct arrival is again sampled in a first receiver trace in a first receiver line and in a second receiver trace in the first receiver line. If the polarity of the direct arrival is different for the two traces, then the polarity of one of the traces is changed (for example, by multiplication by 1). The second trace of the first receiver line is then compared to the third trace of the first receiver line, and a modification is performed under the same conditions as described for the first two traces. The method is repeated for each receiver in the line.<br>
According to yet a further embodiment of the invention, the first receiver trace of the first receiver line is compared to a first receiver trace of a second receiver line, and a modification is performed under the same conditions as described for the first two receiver traces of the first receiver line. It has been found desirable to compare, traces from receivers close together, and preferably adjacent, to avoid offset-introduced errors from harming the polarity processing. As mentioned before, in some embodiments, the direct arrival is the portion of the trace in which the polarity is checked. However, in some embodiments, another event is checked, dependent upon which event is determined to be the most accurately detected. Further, in other embodiments, the comparison between a first trace and a second trace will be oi: one event, and the comparison of the second trace and a third trace will be of another event, again, dependent upon the consistency of the events in the data.<br>
According to another embodiment, the polarity of an entire common receiver gather, is modified, dependant upon the comparison of the polarity between a single event on two traces from different receiver gathers. For example, if the polarity of the direct arrival in a trace from receiver R1 is different from the polarity of the direct arrival in a trace from an adjacent receiver R2. Then, according to this embodiment, the entire set of traces, and all of each of the entire set of traces, not just the direct arrival, is multiplied by -1, without further comparison. Such processing increases the speed of processing greatly.<br>
According to still a further embodiment of the present invention, a process of comparing the polarity between two events is provided, in which the window of an<br>
22<br><br>
event on a first trace (for example 100ms at the direct arrival) is sampled (for example at about 4ms intervals), and the same window on a second trace is sampled at the same rate. The corresponding sample values are multiplied, and whether the result is a positive or negative number is recorded. This is performed for the entire window. The number of positive results is compared to the number of negative results. If there arc more negative results than positive, then the second trace is multiplied by -I.<br>
According to still a further embodiment of the invention, a cross-correlation between the two samples of the two traces is performed. The second trace is modified if the maximum of the cross-correlation result is negative.<br>
According to still a further embodiment, each of the samples of the window of the first trace is added to the other samples of the window of the first trace. Likewise, each of the samples of the window of the second trace is added to the other samples of the window of the second trace. The sign of the results of these additions is compared. The second trace is multiplied by -1 in the event that the sign of the result of the additions is not the same.<br>
Referring now to Figure 3, an embodiment of the invention is seen in which a system is provided for processing seismic data that has been collected with a plurality of multi-component detectors R (Fig. 1). It should be noted that the present system invention includes components, which are, in some embodiments, software, and, in other embodiments, the components comprise hardware. No distinction is made here, since those of ordinary skill in the at will be able to implement the system of the present invention in either (upon review of the following disclosure of example embodiments of the system invention). Further, the following system is illustrative, only. In many places a parallel architecture is seen. However, many components are combined in alternative embodiments of the invention. For example, there are multiple division components shown in the example below. However, in an alternative embodiment, a single division component is used, and the inputs changed. Further modifications will occur to those of skill in the art upon review of the example embodiments below.<br>
According to one embodiment, data from components Hl(t) and H2(l) is stored in a memory 1 and is accessible through data bus DB1. The data is used by the orientation angle determination component 10, which generates an angle 8m, which is<br>
23<br><br>
stored in memory 2. A receiver angle assignor 20 uses the data of memory 2 in connection with the seismic data to statistically determine the true angle 0r of each receiver R. Next, trace rotator 30 applies a rotation algorithm to the traces of the receiver R, and stores the rotated traces in memory 3. Finally, the polarity of the rotated traces from memory 3 are compared and adjusted by the Uniform Polarity Adjuster 40, and polarity-processed data are stored in memory 4.<br>
In an alternative embodiment of the invention, memory 4 and memory 3 are the same memory, and uniform polarity adjuster 40 writes over traces in memory 3 after changing their polarity, as will be seen in a specific example embodiment, below.<br>
Referring now to Figure 4, an example of orientation angle determination component 10 is seen in which time sample portions of traces Hl(t) and H2(t) from memory 1 are multiplied together by multiplier 11 (Hl(t) x H2(t)). Each trace Hl(l) and H2(t) is also squared by squaring component 13. The squared traces H12(1) and H22(t) are subtracted (Hl2(t) - H22(t)) by subtractor 15. The multiplied samples and squared samples are summed over time by summers 12 and 17. The sum resulting from summer 17 of the multiplied samples is then doubled by doubler 19, and the result from doubler 19 is divided by the sum from summer 12 by divider 16. The arctangent of the result from divider 16 is taken by arctangent component 14. The result of arctangent component 14 is then halved by divider 18. The result of divider 18 is the angle ?m of horizontal component H1 of receiver R with respect to a line between receiver R and a source (e.g. S1 of Fig. 1).<br>
Referring now to Figure 5, an embodiment of receiver angle assignor 20 is seen, in which an azimuth adjustment component 22, responsive to data of the source-receiver coordinates (stored in memory 5) adjusts the ?m(s) of each source to a uniform orientation. Next, statistical analyzer 24 determines a single ?r for the receiver, based on the statistical analysis, as described above.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 6A, example embodiments of trace rotator 30 will be described. According to this example, trace rotator 30 has as its input, ?r, and traces Hl(t) and H2(t). Through cosine component 3la and sine component 31b, the cosine and sine of 9r is taken, which are then multiplied to Hl(t) and H2(l) respectively by multipliers 32a and 32b. Further, the sine and cosine of ?r are taken and multiplied to Hl(t) and H2(t), respectively, by multipliers 32c and 32d. It should be noted that,<br>
24<br><br>
while multipliers 32a and 32b are shown in parallel, in alternative embodiments, one multiplier is used. Further, with respect to the cosine and sine components 31a and 31b, in alternative embodiments different components are used. Such components, whether software, hardware, or some combination of both, arc known to those of skill in the art.<br>
Referring again lo the embodiment shown in Figure 6A, the results of the multiplication by multipliers 32a and 32b are summed (by summer 33a) and subtracted (by subtractor 33b), resulting in rotated traces H1 '(0 (the result of the sum) and H2(t) (the result of the subtraction). Hl(t) and H2'(t), the rotated traces, are stored in memory 3. Again, the addition and subtraction are seen in parallel. However, in an alternative embodiment, the summing and subtracting are performed by a single addition component. Again, such components, whether software, hardware, or some combination of both, are known to those of skill in the art.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 6B, an example embodiment of .uniform polarity adjuster 40 is seen, in which trace selector 41 selects a reference trace it and comparison trace et to be compared. An event (for example, the direct arrival) in the two traces is compared by polarity comparer 42 which generates a signal cs to reverse the polarity of comparison trace et in the event that the polarity of traces it and et are not the same. A polarity changer 43 multiplies the comparison trace et by -I in the event that signal cs has designated the trace for polarity reversal. As before, the components are known to those of skill in the art.<br>
In the embodiment of Fig. 6B, the changed trace is then written back into memory 3, over the original trace. According to an alternative embodiment, however, (see Figure 7A) memory 3, which contains the entire trace, is not used by trace selector 41. Rather, another memory la is used, which holds only the samples of a sample window of a comparison event (e.g. the direct arrival), and polarity changer 43 operates on the entire trace from another memory location (e.g. memory 3), as seen in Figure 7B.<br>
Referring again to Figure 5, an example embodiment of azimuth adjustment component 22 is like trace rotator 30 (Fig. 6), with the exception that the input is changed from 6r to the angle between a line between the receiver R and the source. In<br>
25<br><br>
fact, according to some embodiments, the same component as used for trace rotator 30 is used.<br>
Referring still to Figure 5, examples of statistical analysis component 24 include processes and components programmed to perform those processes such as described above with respect to the method embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Further embodiments of the invention will occur to those of skill in the art which do not depart from its spirit and arc intended as being within the scope of the present invention.<br>
