DETERGENT COMPOSITIONS<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to laundry detergent compositions giving especial benefits in the laundering of white fabrics.  The compositions of the invention have been found to give improved maintenance of colour fidelity, especially of white and light-coloured fabrics, during the wash.<br>
BACKGROUND AND PRIOR ART<br>
In some countries the water supply contains a relatively high concentration of iron and this can lead to the discolouration (yellowing) of white and light-coloured fabrics on laundering due to the deposition of Fe(III) salts.   This changes the appearance and shortens the useful life of the articles.<br>
It has now been found that significantly improved maintenance of whiteness or colour fidelity may be observed if a glucoheptonate is incorporated at low levels in a laundry detergent composition.<br>
Magnesium glucoheptonate as a laundry detergent ingredient is disclosed in GB 2 016 540A (Rhone-Poulenc).<br><br><br>
Other documents disclosing glucoheptonate in laundry detergent compositions are GB 2 068 405A (Sandoz) and US 4 388 205 (Sandoz).<br>
Peroxyacid bleach particles containing glucoheptonate are disclosed in WO 96 11252A(Eka Nobel AB).<br>
The use of sodium glucoheptonate in compositions for hard surface cleaning is disclosed in US 3 956 157 (W R Grace), EP 844 301A (Unilever) and GB 2 068 405A (Sandoz).<br>
In our co-pending application No. 1153/MUM/2000 there is provided a laundry detergent composition comprising surfactant, builder, and optionally other non-bleach detergent ingredients, and also containing from 0.01 to 2.0 wt% of a water-soluble polymer comprising structural units of the formula I<br>
R2<br>
-        CH        -       C       -	(I)<br>
R-1	C   = O<br>
NH - CH - COOX CH2 â€” R3<br>
wherein R1 is H or COOX, R2 is H or CH2COOX but R1 and R2 cannot both be H, R3 is COOX, OH or CH2COOX, and each X is individually H or a solubilising cation.<br>
DEFINITION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides a laundry detergent composition comprising surfactant, builder, and optionally other non-bleach detergent ingredients, and also containing from 0.01 to 2.0 wt% of a compound of the formula I<br>
HO   - CH2   - (CH-OH)5 - COOX	( 1 )<br>
wherein X is H or a solubilising cation.<br><br>
A further subject of the invention is a method of protecting new white or light-coloured textile fabrics from colour degradation on laundering, which comprises laundering the fabrics by hand or machine in a wash liquor containing a detergent composition as defined above.<br>
A further subject of the invention is the use of a polymer as defined above in a laundry detergent composition to protect new white or light-coloured textile fabrics from colour degradation on laundering.<br>
The term "colour fidelity" is used herein to include both the true colour of coloured fabrics and the whiteness of white fabrics. The benefits of the present invention are especially applicable to white or light-coloured fabrics where iron deposition will cause the greatest deterioration in appearance.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The compositions of the invention contain as an essential ingredient a low level of a glucoheptonate of the formula I given above, preferably sodium glucoheptonate.<br>

According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the compositions of the invention may be substantially free of bleaching ingredients.<br>
The detergent composition of the invention is preferably in particulate form.  Especially preferred are powders and tablets.  However, liquid compositions are also within the scope.of the invention.<br>
Detergent ingredients<br>
The detergent compositions will contain, as essential ingredients, one or more detergent active compounds (surfactants) which may be chosen from soap and non-soap anionic, cationic, nonionic, amphoteric and zwitterionic detergent active compounds, and mixtures thereof.<br><br>
Many suitable detergent active compounds are available and are fully described in the literature, for example, in "Surface-Active Agents and Detergents", Volumes I and II, by Schwartz, Perry and Berch.<br>
The preferred detergent active compounds that can be used are soaps and synthetic non-soap anionic and nonionic compounds.<br>
Anionic surfactants are well-known to those skilled in the art.

solubilising cation (for example, compounds in which Ri is a C8.C22 alkyl group, preferably a C8-C10 or C12-C14 alkyl group, R2 is a methyl group, and R3 and R4, which may be the same or different, are methyl or hydroxyethyl groups); and cationic esters (for example, choline esters).<br>
In an especially preferred cationic surfactant of the general formula R1R2R3R4N+ X",  R1 represents a C8-C10 or C12-C14 alkyl group, R2 and R3 represent methyl groups, and R4 presents a hydroxyethyl group.<br>
Amphoteric surfactants, for example, amine oxides, and zwitterionic surfactants, for example, betaines, may also be present.<br>
Preferably, the quantity of anionic surfactant is in the range of from 5 to 50% by weight of the total composition. More preferably, the quantity of anionic surfactant is in the range of from 8 to 35% by weight.<br>
Nonionic surfactant, if present, is preferably used in an amount within the range of from 1 to 20% by weight.<br>
The total amount of surfactant present is preferably within the range of from 5 to 60 wt%.<br>
The compositions may suitably contain from 10 to 80%, preferably from 15 to 70% by weight, of detergency builder. Preferably, the quantity of builder is in the range of from 15 to 50% by weight.<br><br><br>
The detergent compositions may contain as builder a crystalline aluminosilicate, preferably an alkali metal aluminosilicate, more preferably a sodium aluminosilicate (zeolite).<br>
The zeolite used as a builder may be the commercially available zeolite A (zeolite 4A) now widely used in laundry detergent powders. Alternatively, the zeolite may be maximum aluminium zeolite P (zeolite MAP) as described and claimed in EP 384 070B (Unilever), and commercially available as Doucil (Trade Mark) A24 from Crosfield Chemicals Ltd, UK. Zeolite MAP is defined as an alkali metal aluminosilicate of zeolite P type having a silicon to aluminium ratio not exceeding 1.33, preferably within the range of from 0.90 to 1.33, preferably within the range of from 0.90 to 1.20. Especially preferred is zeolite MAP having a silicon to aluminium ratio not exceeding 1.07, more preferably about 1.00.   The particle size of the zeolite is not critical. Zeolite A or zeolite MAP of any suitable particle size may be used.<br>
Also preferred according to the present invention are phosphate builders, especially sodium tripolyphosphate. This may be used in combination with sodium orthophosphate, and/or sodium pyrophosphate.<br>

Especially preferred supplementary organic builders are citrates, suitably used in amounts of from 5 to 3 0 wt %, preferably from 10 to 25 wt %; and acrylic polymers, more especially acrylic/maleic copolymers, suitably used in amounts of from 0.5 to 15 wt %, preferably from 1 to 10 wt%. Builders, both inorganic and organic, are preferably present in alkali metal salt, especially sodium salt, form.<br>
Detergent compositions according to the invention may also suitably contain a bleach system, although, as previously indicated, non-bleaching formulations are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
The bleach system is preferably based on peroxy bleach compounds, for example, inorganic persalts or organic peroxyacids, capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution.   Suitable peroxy bleach compounds include organic peroxides such as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalts such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates, persilicates and persulphates.   Preferred inorganic persalts are sodium perborate monohydrate and tetrahydrate, and sodium percarbonate.<br><br><br>
Especially preferred is sodium percarbonate having a protective coating against destabilisation by moisture. Sodium percarbonate having a protective coating comprising sodium metaborate and sodium silicate is disclosed in GB 2 123 044B (Kao).<br>
The peroxy bleach compound is suitably present in an amount of from 5 to 35 wt%, preferably from 10 to 25 wt%.<br>
The peroxy bleach compound may be used in conjunction with a bleach activator (bleach precursor) to improve bleaching action at low wash temperatures.   The bleach precursor is suitably present in an amount of from 1 to 8 wt%, preferably from 2 to 5 wt%.<br>

The novel quaternary ammonium and phosphonium bleach precursors disclosed in US 4 751 015 and US 4 818 426 (Lever Brothers Company) and EP 402 971A (Unilever) are also of great interest. Especially preferred are peroxycarbonic acid precursors, in particular cholyl-4-sulphophenyl carbonate.  Also of interest are peroxybenzoic acid precursors, in particular, N,N,N-trimethylammonium toluoyloxy benzene sulphonate;  and the cationic bleach precursors disclosed in EP 284 292A and EP 303 520A (Kao).<br><br><br>
A bleach stabiliser (heavy metal sequestrant) may also be present.  Suitable bleach stabilisers include ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA) and the polyphosphonates such as Dequest (Trade Mark), EDTMP.<br>
The detergent compositions may also contain one or more enzymes.  Suitable enzymes include the proteases, amylases, cellulases, oxidases, peroxidases and lipases usable for incorporation ,in detergent compositions.<br>
Preferred proteolytic enzymes (proteases) are catalytically active protein materials which degrade or alter protein types of stains when present as in fabric stains in a hydrolysis reaction. They may be of any suitable origin, such as vegetable, animal, bacterial or yeast origin. Proteolytic enzymes or proteases of various qualities and origins and having activity in various pH ranges of from 4-12 are available.   Proteases of both high and low isoelectric point are suitable.<br><br>
Other enzymes that may suitably be present include lipases, amylases, and cellulases including high-activity cellulases such as "Carezyme").<br><br><br>

Other ingredients that may be present include solvents, hydrotropes, fluorescers, photobleaches, foam boosters or foam controllers (antifoams) as appropriate, sodium carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium silicate, sodium sulphate, calcium chloride, other inorganic salts, fabric conditioning compounds, and perfumes.<br>
Product form and preparation<br>
As previously indicated, the compositions of the invention may be of any suitable physical form, for example, particulates (powders, granules, tablet's) , liquids, pastes, gels or bars.<br>
According to one especially preferred embodiment of the invention, the detergent composition is in particulate form. If necessary, the glucoheptonate may be incorporated in particulate compositions in the form of granules containing an inert carrier material.<br><br><br>
Powders of low to moderate bulk density may be prepared by spray-drying a slurry, and optionally postdosing (dry-mixing) further ingredients, in which case the glucoheptonate may be either incorporated via the slurry or postdosed.   "Concentrated" or "compact" powders may be prepared by mixing and granulating processes, for example, using a high-speed mixer/granulator, or other non-tower processes.<br>
Liquid detergent compositions may be prepared by admixing the essential and optional ingredients in any desired order to provide compositions containing the ingredients in the the requisite concentrations.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The invention will now be illustrated in further detail by means of the following Examples, in which parts and percentages are by weight unless otherwise stated. In the Examples the following abbreviations are used:<br>
EDDS     Ethylenediamine disuccinate, sodium salt<br>
EDTMP    Ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonate, Ca salt: Deguest (Trade Mark) 2047 ex Monsanto<br>
NaLAS    Sodium linear alkylbenzene sulphonate<br>
SLES     Sodium lauryl ether sulphate<br>
SCMC     Sodium carboxymethyl cellulose<br><br>
EXAMPLES 1 to 3, COMPARATIVE EXAMPLES A to D<br>
Protection of new white cotton fabrics from discolouration by Fe(III) ions using sequestrants<br><br>
In this experiment, the effectivness of sodium glucoheptonate in preventing the discolouration of white cotton fabric was compared with that of two known sequestrants, EDTMP (Dequest 2 047) and EDDS.  The<br>
   experimental procedure was as follows.<br>
The sequestrants, in the concentrations indicated below, were added to 1 litre of demineralised water containing iron(III) chloride in an amount sufficient to give a Fe(III) concentration of 10 ppm, in a tergotometer pot.  The pH of   the solution was adjusted to 9.5 (Â±0.1) by adding sodium hydroxide solution.  Three 10x10 cm pieces (approximately 5 grams) of desized non-fluorescent white cotton cloth were added to provide a liquor to cloth ratio of 200:1.  A tergotometer wash was then carried out at 3 0Â°C and 90 rpm for 3 0 minutes.  The cloths were then rinsed in demineralised water and dried overnight.  Reflectance values at 420nm were taken for the cloths before and after washing, and AR at 420nm calculated to give an indication of the amount of iron deposition onto the cloth.<br>
The ideal here is for a result as close as possible to zero, indicating no deposition of iron and no visible deterioration in appearance.<br><br><br>
The concentrations for the sequestrants were chosen as follows:<br>
0.008 g/1, equivalent to 0.2 wt% of a detergent composition 5  used at a typical consumer dosage of 4 g/1.<br>
0.002 g/1, equivalent to 0.05 wt% of a detergent composition used at a typical consumer dosage of 4 g/1.<br>
)  0.0008 g/1, equivalent to 0.02 wt% of a detergent<br>
composition used at a typical consumer dosage of 4 g/1.<br>
Average changes in reflectance are shown in the following Table.<br><br>
Example	Sequestrant	Concentration<br>
Equivalent<br>
(wt%)	Average AR 42 0 nm<br>
A	EDTMP	0.20	+ 0.01<br>
B	EDTMP	0.05	- 3.27<br>
C	EDTMP	0.02	-25.59<br>
D	EDDS	0.20	-32.02<br>
1	Na glucoheptonate	0.20	+ 0.01<br>
2	Na glucoheptonate	0.05	+ 1.72<br>
3	Na glucoheptonate	0.02	-16.95<br>
EDTMP is an excellent sequestrant but has come under some scrutiny on environmental grounds because of its phosphorus content.  EDDS has been widely proposed as a zero-phosphorus replacement.<br><br><br><br>
It will be seen that sodium glucoheptonate provides a phosphorus-free alternative to EDTMP that is substantially superior to EDDS.<br>
