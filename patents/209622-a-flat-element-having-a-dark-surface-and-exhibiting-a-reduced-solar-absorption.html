Flat Element having a Dark Surface and Exhibiting<br>
a Reduced Solar Absorption<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a flat element comprising a substrate and a coating of the substrate whereby both the substrate and the surface of the flat element are pigmented coloured dark in the visible light range. In the near-infrared range the flat element has high reflection so as to reduce it becoming heated up in sunlight despite the dark pigmentation colour in the visible light range. Such a flat element finds application on all surface areas needing to be pigmented coloured dark for aesthetic or technical reasons but which should not heat up when exposed to sunlight and in cases where the dark colour is maintained even when the coating is damaged.<br>
Prior Art<br>
Surfaces which need to be coloured dark for aesthetic or technical reasons and which are exposed to sunlight have the usual nuisance tendency to become more or less heated up depending on how dense the colouration is.<br>
It is particularly in confined spaces such as e.g. in a vehicle be it an automobile, a truck, a bus or also the interiors of railcars that this solar heating up of dark surface areas is experienced as a real nuisance. The dark surface areas heat up more or less, depending on their degree of solar absorption and give off their heat into the interior of the vehicle. This heat then requires compensating with an air-conditioning system which adds to the energy consumption of the vehicle quite considerably.<br>
In any vehicle there are surface areas which for technical reasons need to be coloured dark. One good example of this is the dashboard top in an automobile. Were it coloured bright it would reflect in the windscreen and prove a nuisance to the<br><br>
driver's view ahead. This is why it naturally needs to be coloured dark. Since this surface area is located directly under the windshield it is exposed the most to solar radiation and heats up accordingly. Apart from the nuisance of this heating up the vehicle, this increase in temperature of dark surfaces also results in accelerated material fatigue of the surface areas involved.<br>
It is more for aesthetic reasons that leather seats in automobiles are mainly coloured dark grey, indeed mostly even black. When this vehicle has been standing in the sun for quite some time with the leather seats exposed to the sunlight, they heat up so much they become almost unbearably hot.<br>
Even more of a nuisance is the heating up of steering wheels in sunlight since they usually need gripping with the b'are hand without any cladding.<br>
Proposed in PCT/EP96/04703 is a means for producing coatings reflecting heat radiation. This describes a coating having a higher reflection for sunlight in the near-infrared range. The drawback in this case is that all substances result in higher reflection for sunlight in the near-infrared range need to be incorporated in a single layer.<br>
This has the result that when producing very dark or black tints the reflection for sunlight in the near-infrared range is only slightly higher since the higher the filling with reflective substances the more the reflection increases also in the visible light range.<br>
Another disadvantage is that when the coating is damaged the normal undercoat is exposed having no enhanced sunlight reflection, thus negating the effect at this location.<br>
Were the undercoat coloured white this would restore the enhanced reflection to sunlight but for aesthetic reasons this<br><br>
is not possible since everywhere where the coating becomes damaged or is no longer present the white undercoat would "grin" through.<br>
It is thus the objective of the present invention to provide a substrate which, having the same colouration in the visible light range as the coating thereon, shows a high reflection in the near-infrared range and is provided with a coating which in the visible light range is dark and in the near-infrared range is mainly transparent and/or self-reflective and which with a normal pigment fill also satisfies all mechanical requirem.ents in later application.<br>
Disclosure of the Invention<br>
In accordance with the invention this is achieved by a flat element having a dark surface and exhibiting a reduced solar absorption comprising<br>
a)	a substrate whose reflection in the visible light range from 380 to 720 nm is less than 50% and in the near-infrared range from 720 to 1500 nm exceeds 60%,<br>
b)	a coating of the substrate comprising a binder which in the spectral range of 380 to 1500 nm has a transparency exceeding 70%, and first pigments which in the visible light range from 380 to 720 nm result in a reduced reflection of the coating less than 50% and in the spectral range of the near-infrared range from 720 to 1500 nm show a transparency exceeding 50%, and/or second pigments which in the visible light range from 380 to 720 nm result in a reduced reflection of the coating less than 50% and in the spectral range of the near-infrared range from 720 to 1500 nm show a reflection exceeding 40%, preferably exceeding 50%, particularly preferred exceeding 60%.<br>
