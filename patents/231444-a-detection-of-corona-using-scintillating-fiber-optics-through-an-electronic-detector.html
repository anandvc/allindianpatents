				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a corona detector. More<br>
specifically, the invention relates to a corona detector using<br>
fibre optics.<br>
Corona is observed in high voltage systems and is the<br>
result of field intensified ionization. An ultra violet purple<br>
and blue radiation is emitted during this phenomena. Detection<br>
of corona may lead to detection of incipient failures in high<br>
voltage systems.<br>
Corona or field intensified ionization eventually causes<br>
breakdown of insulation resulting in failure of electrical<br>
equipment.<br>
Corona is a low power arc while true breakdown is a high<br>
power arc. It is primarily an alternating current phenomena.<br>
Corona discharges that recur at regular intervals are referred<br>
to as continuous corona. Examples of this are, discharges that<br>
occur every cycle of an applied AC voltage or once in every<br>
30 sec. of an applied direct voltage. The effect of corona on<br>
insulation is degradation, which will eventually lead to failure<br>
of components. Corona sets up white noise, which can have an<br>
adverse effect on communications and sensitive electronic<br>
equipments. In addition, corona deteriorates the insulation<br>
causing electrical equipment to fail prematurely. This<br>
degradation occurs through three mechanisms.<br><br>
Firstly, heat is produced and this has direct and<br>
deleterious effect on insulation especially in the case of long<br>
term exposure.<br>
Secondly, the ozone formed is a powerful oxidizing agent<br>
which acts to degrade both natural and synthetic polymer<br>
insulation, making it brittle and producing cracks.<br>
Finally, the free ions produced by the corona currents<br>
have a cutting effect on the insulating material and thus leads<br>
to the formation of carbonization tracks and eventual insulation<br>
failure.<br>
The corona problem grows more severe as voltage and<br>
frequency of the electrical system increases.<br>
Traditionally for detection, corona can be observed using<br>
ultraviolet or infrared cameras. However, the use of such devices<br>
in an enclosed systems and panels is rather inconvenient. Such<br>
devices are normally used as inspection tools. These are also<br>
very expensive devices.<br>
One object of the present invention therefore is to<br>
provide a low cost corona detector using fibre optics.<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide<br>
a corona detector which can be safely arranged inside the high<br>
voltage bus ducts or switchgear. An optical device using fibre<br>
optics can easily be accommodated inside high voltage bus ducts<br>
or switchgear.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide<br>
immunity to electric noise and insulation. The scintillating<br>
fibre used is made of flexible plastic material which is immune<br>
to electric noise and provides insulation.<br>
The present invention utilizes the property of<br>
scintillating fibres which can be used as sensor for detecting<br>
ultraviolet emission of the corona and for emitting visible<br>
light at the two ends of the fibre. Scintillating fibres are<br>
plastic fibres containing dyes for absorbing ultraviolet emission<br>
and for emanating light in visible band of the light spectrum.<br>
The corona detector using fibre optics can thus be used<br>
to detect corona and arcing for switchgear and bus ducts,<br>
transformers and other cubicle mounted electrical equipment.<br>
The scintillating fibres made from flexible plastic material<br>
can be conveniently laid within a cubicle. The optical fibre<br>
being immune to electrical noise provides insulation, and<br>
therefore it is a safe device.<br><br>
The ultraviolet radiation from a corona is sensed through<br>
the sides of the scintillating fibre, which has a scintillating<br>
efficienty of 3.4 to 7%.<br>
A light emanating end of the scintillating fibre is coupled<br>
to a light transmitting glass/plastic fibre. The other end of<br>
the transmitting fibre carries the light radiation to an<br>
electronic detection circuitry for corona detection and setting<br>
in an alarm.<br>
Thus the present invention provides a corona detector<br>
using fibre optics, comprising a scintillating fibre laid around<br>
a high voltage equipment or insulator for sensing ultraviolet<br>
emission of corona and emanating visible light to the ends<br>
of said scintillating fibre; a first end of a light transmitting<br>
fibre connected to one end of said scintillating fibre by a<br>
coupling for carrying said visible light to a second end of<br>
said light transmitting fibre; and an electronic detection<br>
circuit coupled to said second end of said transmitting fibre<br>
for receiving said visible light for detecting the ultraviolet<br>
radiation and setting in an alarm on detection of corona.<br>
The invention will now be described in detail with the<br>
help of the accompanying drawings, where<br><br>
Figure 1 shows the scintillating fibre used in the present<br>
invention;<br>
Figure 2 shows the arrangement of a mirror at one end<br>
of the scintillating fibre;<br>
Figure 3 shows the arrangement of the corona detection<br>
device of the present invention;<br>
Figure 4 shows a typical installation of a corona detection<br>
device of the present invention.<br>
Figure 5 shows in block diagram form the electronic<br>
detection circuitry of the corona detection device of Figure<br>
3.<br>
A free running scintillating fibre 1 is laid around high<br>
voltage equipment like potential transformers and current<br>
transformers, or a high voltage insulator.<br>
The scintillating fibre 1 contains dyes to absorb<br>
ultraviolet radiation from the corona and for emanating light<br>
in visible band of light spectrum.<br>
The scintillating fibre 1 can thus be used as a sensor<br>
to detect the ultraviolet radiation of the corona and emit<br>
visible light at the two ends of the scintillating fibre 1.<br>
A thin cladding 3 can be used for the core 8 of the<br>
scintillating fibre 1. This cladding 3 is with relatively lower<br>
refractive index plastic material which makes the light to be<br>
conduited efficiently to either end of the scintillating fibre<br>
1.<br><br><br>
The cladding thickness can be of the order of microns,<br>
hence it does not effect the sensitivity of detection. The ultra<br>
violet radiation sensed through the sides of the fibre is then<br>
converted into visible range of light and transmitted through<br>
the ends of the fibre. The ultraviolet radiation threshold for<br>
the detection can be varied by the electronic detection circuit.<br>
One of the light emanating ends of the scintillating fibre<br>
1	is connected toa first end of a light transmitting fibre 4<br>
of glass or plastic by coupling 5.<br>
On the other end of the scintillating fibre 1, a mirror<br>
2	can be provided which is in contact with the ight emitting<br>
phase. The light emanating from that end of the scintillating<br>
fibre 1 is reflected back by the mirror 2 into the fibre so<br>
that the entire light flux can pass through one end of the<br>
scintillating fibre only. This arrangement as shown in Fig.2<br>
enhances the sensitivity of the corona detector.<br>
This coupling 5 can be with the help of a lens 5' as shown<br>
in Fig. 3. The coupling lens 5' has the additional advantage<br>
of matching the numerical apertures of the scintillating fibre<br>
1 with those of the light transmitting fibre 4.<br>
The coupling lens 5' as shown in Fig. 3 can transfer almost<br>
complete light from the scintillating fibre into the transmitting<br><br>
fibre. The numerical aperture of the scintillating fibre is<br>
0.58 while the numerical aperture of the transmitting fibre<br>
is 0.51. Therefor, a small double convex lens can be used as<br>
coupling.<br>
The second end of this light transmitting fibre 4 carries<br>
the light radiation to an electronic detection circuit 6 for<br>
detection of corona and for setting in an alarm.<br>
In order to avoid the influence of high voltage noise,<br>
electromagnetic interference, etc, the electronic detection<br>
circuit 6 is mounted suitably away from the high voltage system.<br>
Thus, the light emitting from the scintillating fibre is<br>
transmitted to a distant location through a light piping fibre.<br>
The transmitting fibre 4 can be of plastic or glass fibre<br>
suitable for the visible operation of the light spectrum.<br>
The electronic detection circuit 6 comprises a photo<br>
detector 9 followed by amplifiers 10, a comparator 11 and<br>
a circuit for setting an alarm on detection of corona as shown<br>
in Fig. 5. The amplifier section 10 comprises three<br>
amplification stages. The comparator 11 is used for elimination<br>
of noise. Base noise level can be set in the comparator so that<br>
only signals stronger than this base noise level can be<br>
amplified. The signal is then given to the counter 13 through<br>
a buffer 12 with a provision for counting the number of pulses.<br><br>
The number of pulses can be adjusted by the user. Such<br>
a provision allows elimination of spurious signals. The counter<br>
13 is reset by an auto reset timer 15 at an adjustable time<br>
interval.<br>
The output of the counter 13 is given to a flip-flop<br>
circuitry for generating the alarm signal. After an alarm signal<br>
has been generated, it remains locked, till it is reset manually<br>
by manual reset 14, after the emergency has been satisactorily<br>
addressed.<br>
When the corona is sensed by the scintillating fibre,the<br>
electronic circuitry 6 detects the presence of corona and sets<br>
in an alarm. To avoid detection of spurious signals (noise),<br>
an automatic reset circuit is provided which prevents the sensor<br>
from sounding an alarm, if the minimum number of pulses (set<br>
by the user) does not occur during a certain period of time<br>
(say 2 minutes). The alarm is in the form of a relay contact<br>
and causes an LED display to light up. The relay contact<br>
additionally can actuate the tripping of the high tension system<br>
or any interlocking systems that may be provided for such<br>
emergencies.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
