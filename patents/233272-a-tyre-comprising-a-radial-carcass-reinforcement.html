				<td>CROWN REINFORCEMENT FOR A RADIAL TYRE<br>
The present invention relates to a tyre having a radial carcass reinforcement, which is intended to be fitted on heavy vehicles such as lorries, buses, tractors, trailers etc., and relates more particularly to the crown reinforcement of such a tyre.<br>
Generally, the radial carcass reinforcement of the tyre in question, which is formed of inextensible reinforcement elements made of metal or of aromatic polyamide, is surmounted radially by a crown reinforcement comprising a plurality of crown plies; in particular a triangulation ply formed of metallic elements which are oriented relative to the circumferential direction by a large angle of between 45° and 90°, said triangulation ply in turn being surmounted by two working plies formed of inextensible metallic reinforcement elements which are parallel to each other within each ply and are crossed from one ply to the next, forming angles of between 10° and 45° with the circumferential direction. Said working plies, which form the working reinforcement, may also be covered by at least one so-called protective ply, formed of generally metallic, extensible reinforcement elements, which are referred to as elastic elements.<br>
Cables are said to be inextensible when said cables have a relative elongation at most equal to 0.2% under a tensile force equal to 10% of the breaking load.<br>
Cables are said to be elastic when said cables have a relative elongation at least equal to 4% under a tensile force equal to the breaking load.<br>
The circumferential direction of the tyre, or longitudinal direction, is the direction corresponding to the periphery of the tyre and defined by the direction of rolling of the tyre.<br>
The transverse or axial direction of the tyre is parallel to the axis of rotation of the tyre.<br>
The radial direction is a direction intersecting and perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the tyre.<br>
The axis of rotation of the tyre is the axis around which it rotates in normal use. A radial or meridian plane is a plane containing the axis of rotation of the tyre.<br><br>
The circumferential median plane, or equatorial plane, is a plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation of the tyre and which divides the tyre into two halves.<br>
In the case of tyres for "heavy vehicles", a single protective ply is usually present and its protective elements are in most cases oriented in the same direction and at the same angle in absolute value as those of the reinforcement elements of the radially outermost and hence radially adjacent working ply. In the case of construction-vehicle tyres which are intended to travel on relatively bumpy roads, the presence of two protective plies is advantageous, the elastic elements being crossed from one ply to the next and the reinforcement elements of the radially inner protective ply being crossed with the inextensible reinforcement elements of the radially outer working ply adjacent to said radially inner protective ply.<br>
Application JP 59/118 507, with the aim of avoiding separation between crown plies, shows such a reinforcement structure with a radially outer ply on one hand formed of high-modulus textile reinforcement elements forming with the circumferential direction an angle which in absolute value is smaller than the angle formed by the elements of the radially outer working ply, and on the other hand having an axial width greater than the width of said working ply, while remaining less than the width of the radially inner working ply.<br>
Application JP 03/262 704, with the same aim, describes and shows a solution very close to the previous one as far as the axial widths of the plies and angles of the reinforcement elements of said plies are concerned. Furthermore, it specifies that the radially outermost ply has an elongation at break of at least 5%.<br>
With the aim of protecting the working plies from corrosion, and avoiding separation between the crown reinforcement and tread, document JP 04/055 104, which adopts practically the same axial widths of crown plies, advocates using reinforcement elements of aromatic polyester for the protective ply.<br>
French Patent 2 493 236, with the aim, it would seem, of solving the problems posed by travel on a rough road, advocates a structure similar to the previous ones, but with use in the radially inner and outer plies of reinforcement elements, the elongation at break of which is greater by at least 40% than the elongation at break of the reinforcement elements of the two working plies.<br><br>
The progress made in terms of length of life (number of kilometres travelled) on wear of "heavy-vehicle" tyres, and also the possibility of easy, economical subsequent retreading, requires a crown reinforcement, the resistance to separation between the edges of working plies of which is improved.<br>
Patent FR 2 800 672, in order to limit separation at the ends of working plies, claims a crown reinforcement structure in which a ply, referred to as a protective ply, has an axial width between those of the working crown plies, the reinforcement elements of the protective ply being inclined in the same direction as the reinforcement elements of the radially adjacent working ply and forming with the circumferential direction an angle greater, by at least 5°, than that of said radially adjacent working ply.<br>
In their research and in particular during research into the production of "heavy-vehicle" tyres having an increasingly long wear life (number of kilometres travelled), the inventors set themselves the task of defining a tyre crown structure which makes it possible to obtain a resistance to separation between the edges of working plies which is improved still further.<br>
This object has been achieved according to the invention by a tyre comprising a radial carcass reinforcement radially surmounted by a crown reinforcement consisting of at least one working reinforcement formed of two plies of calendered inextensible metallic reinforcement elements, of rubber mix which are parallel to each other within each ply and are crossed from one ply to the next, forming angles cti and 012 of between 10° and 45° with the circumferential direction, said working plies having axial widths L] and L2, and of at least one supplementary ply, referred to as a protective ply, of axial width L.i such that 1,2 
A cohesive rubber mix is a rubber mix which is particularly resistant to cracking.<br>
A tyre such as has been defined above according to the invention, that is to say having a crown reinforcement such as described, makes it possible to reduce still further the risks of separation between the edges of working plies and thus to improve the life of the tyre by permitting in particular retreading thereof. The layer P of rubber mixes makes it possible to obtain decoupling of said working plies, which, in combination with the supplementary ply<br><br>
referred to as a protective ply, leads to an improvement in the resistance to separation between the edges of working plies.<br>
According to an advantageous variant of the invention, the width La of the protective ply is such that L^<l in other words the protective ply has an axial width less than of radially inner working crown and therefore lies between widths two plies. during research it was demonstrated that particular preferable to avoid ends axially coinciding. such a structure would be harmful with regard separation edges></l>
Advantageously also, independently of the above relationship between the axial widths of the radially inner working crown ply and the protective crown ply, the axial width of the radially inner working crown ply is greater than the axial width of the radially outer working crown ply. In other words, the widths LI and L2 of the working crown plies advantageously satisfy the relationship: LI &gt; La.<br>
According to one preferred embodiment of the invention, the layer P, at the axially outer end of the radially outer working crown ply, has a thickness such that the radial distance d between the two working crown plies, separated by said layer P, satisfies the relationship:<br>
where fa is the diameter of the reinforcement elements of the radially outer working crown ply.<br>
The distance d is measured from cable to cable, that is to say between the cable of a first working ply and the cable of a second working ply. In other words, this distance d covers the thickness of the layer P and the respective thicknesses of the calendering rubber mixes, which is radially external to the cables of the radially inner working ply and radially internal to the cables of the radially outer working ply.<br>
More preferably still according to the invention, the radial distance between the two working crown plies, separated by the layer P, being equal to d, at the end of the radially outer working crown ply, the end of the supplementary ply, referred to as a protective ply, is separated radially from the working crown ply of width LI by the layer P by a distance d', such that: d 
 <br>
The distance d', like the distance d previously, is measured from cable to cable.<br>
Said distance d' is greater than or equal to d such that the end of the protective ply is not stressed owing to the proximity of the reinforcement elements of the radially inner working ply. The layer P of rubber mixes advantageously acts as a decoupling layer between the radially inner working ply and the protective ply.<br>
The same distance d' is preferably less than a distance corresponding to the distance d increased by four times the diameter of the reinforcement elements of the radially outer working layer; beyond such a value, the distance d' might result in difficulties in retreading operations, resulting in particular in the risk of damage to the crown reinforcement and hence in the impossibility of retreading the tyre, because usually the worn tread is removed to a thickness relatively close to the crown reinforcement, which consequently has to satisfy maximum radial positioning conditions such that it is not damaged during said removal of the worn tread.<br>
In the same manner as previously, the radial distance between the two working crown plies, separated by the layer P, being equal to d, at the end of the radially outer working crown ply, the end of the radially inner working crown ply is advantageously distant from the supplementary ply, referred to as a protective ply, by a distance d", such that d" &gt; d. Once again, and more specifically in the case of a protective ply the width L-3 of which is greater than the width LI of the radially inner working ply, the layer P of rubber mixes advantageously acts as a decoupling layer between the radially inner working ply and the protective ply, such that the ends of the reinforcement elements of the radially inner working ply are not stressed owing to the excessive proximity of the reinforcement elements of the protective ply. In other words, the reinforcement elements of the protective ply advantageously do not penetrate a circle of radius d centred on the end of the reinforcement elements of the radially inner working ply.<br>
The distance d", like the distances d and d' previously, is measured from cable to cable.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, in particular to ensure sufficient drift rigidity of the tyre, the widths of the working crown plies satisfy the relationship: 1 &gt;<br>
L2/L, &gt;2/3.<br><br>
More preferably still according to the invention, the axial width D of the layer P between the axially inner end of said layer P and the end of the radially outer working crown ply is such that: 3.fa ^ D 
More preferably still, the axial width D is greater than five times the diameter of the reinforcement elements of the radially outer working ply.<br>
One preferred embodiment of the invention provides for the reinforcement elements of the protective ply to be inclined in the same direction as the reinforcement elements of the radially adjacent working ply, forming with the circumferential direction an angle 0.3 of the same direction and greater than or equal to the angle 0.2 of the reinforcement elements of said working ply adjacent to the protective ply.<br>
Preferably, the angle 063, formed by the reinforcement elements of the protective ply with the circumferential direction, is greater than or equal in absolute value to the angle 0.2 of the elements of said radially adjacent working ply by at least 5°.<br>
More preferably still, the angular difference 0:3 - 0,2 is at most equal to 20°.<br>
If said difference is less than 5°, the resistance to separation between working plies is not improved; if the difference is greater than 20°, it is possible that the separation between the edges of the two working plies will be adversely affected, contrary to what is desired. The angle 0:3 is more advantageously less than 45°.<br>
In an advantageous variant of the invention, the crown reinforcement is finished off, radially between the carcass reinforcement and the working reinforcement, by a triangulation ply formed of inextensible metallic elements, preferably forming with the circumferential direction an angle cto of the same direction as the angle ai formed by the reinforcement elements of the radially innermost working ply and of between 45° and 90°.<br><br>
As is known per se, the addition between the working reinforcement and carcass reinforcement of what is called a triangulation ply may be advantageous, said ply being formed of metallic elements inclined greatly relative to the circumferential direction, and preferably having an axial width LO which is less than the width LI of the radially inner working crown ply.<br>
According to one advantageous embodiment of the invention, in particular intended for "heavy-vehicle" applications, the protective ply is formed of steel cables which are extensible or referred to as elastic. Such metallic reinforcement elements of the protective ply advantageously have a relative elongation at least equal to 4% at break.<br>
According to a first variant of the invention, the layer P of rubber mix is such that the modulus of said layer is identical in the different zones of said layer in contact with the calendering mixes of the two working crown plies in contact therewith.<br>
According to another variant of the invention, the layer P of rubber mixes is formed of a stack of at least two layers of rubber mixes PI and Pa of respective elasticity moduli MPi and MPa, at 10% elongation, selected advantageously such that MPi &gt; MPa, the radially outermost mixture PI being in contact with the radially outermost working crown ply. Such an embodiment of the invention permits a reduction in the stresses on the layer of rubber mix PI in contact with the radially outer working crown ply relative to the stresses on the layer of rubber mix Pa. Such an embodiment also makes it possible to improve the resistance to separation between the ends of the working crown plies.<br>
According to this variant embodiment of the invention, the axially outer end of the layer of rubber mix Pa is preferably axially internal to the end of the radially inner working crown ply, so as not to harm the resistance to separation of said end of the radially inner working crown ply. The axially inner end of said layer of rubber mix Pa is for its part advantageously axially external to the axially inner end of the layer of rubber mix P\.<br>
Another variant of the invention also provides for the layer P of rubber mixes to be formed of a stack of at least two layers of rubber mixes PI and Pa of respective elasticity moduli MPi and MPa, at 10% elongation, such that MP] 
 <br>
According to another advantageous embodiment of the invention, said tyre comprises a layer of cohesive rubber mix GB radially to the inside of the working reinforcement, the axially outer end of said layer GB being at a distance from the equatorial plane greater than<br>
Li/2.<br>
According to this other embodiment of the invention, when the crown reinforcement comprises a triangulation ply radially between the carcass reinforcement and the working reinforcement, the layer of rubber mix GB is either radially internal to said triangulation ply, or radially, at least in part between, the radially inner working crown ply and the triangulation ply, and hence advantageously in contact with the radially inner working crown ply and in contact with the triangulation ply, the latter preferably being axially narrower than the radially inner working crown ply. The tests carried out during the research have shown that such a layer of rubber mix GB also contributes to improving the resistance to separation of the ends of the working crown plies.<br>
Another advantageous embodiment of the invention further provides, in particular to limit the risks of degradation of the tyres due to the formation of cracks between the ends of the reinforcement elements of the working plies and to the propagation thereof, at least in each shoulder, a ply of reinforcement elements, advantageously of small diameter, which are parallel to each other in the ply and forming with the circumferential direction an angle of between 70 and 110°, the axially inner edge of said additional ply being radially adjacent to at least one edge of one of the plies of the crown reinforcement, and the axially outer edge of said additional ply preferably being radially internal to the edge of the ply to which the additional ply is adjacent.<br>
The edge of a ply is defined as a limited zone of the ply defined axially by one end of said ply.<br>
One advantageous embodiment of the invention provides for the reinforcement elements of the additional shoulder ply to be what is referred to as of small diameter, compared with the compacted diameter of the metallic elements of the working crown plies of the tyre, when said compacted diameter is less than 0.5 times the compacted diameter of the metallic elements of the working crown plies of the tyre.<br>
More preferably still, the compacted diameter of the reinforcement elements of the additional ply is less than 1 mm.<br><br>
The compacted diameter is the measured diameter of a reinforcement element when the cords forming it are in contact with each other.<br>
These diameters of the reinforcement elements of the additional ply allow the presence of said ply without said reinforcement elements, and more particularly their ends, being a new source of risk of degradation within the tyre.<br>
It appears that a ply of this type produced in accordance with the invention very significantly improves the resistance of the tyre to impacts affecting the shoulder.<br>
The reinforcement elements of the additional ply may be of textile or metallic type.<br>
According to one advantageous embodiment of the invention and more particularly in the case of an additional shoulder ply, the axially outer edge of which is located at least in the radially upper part of the zone of the sidewall, the reinforcement elements of said additional ply are metallic; it would appear that the tyre according to the invention then meets another requirement, because a tyre thus produced makes it possible to limit the risks of degradation due to the generation of heat appearing owing to the hysteresis of the elastomers without furthermore adversely affecting the other desired properties of the rubbers or more directly of the tyres.<br>
Said reinforcement elements are then, more preferably still, made of steel, steel being recognised as being a very good conductor of heat.<br>
The tyre according to the invention, by the presence of the additional plies located at the shoulders, permits rapid evacuation of the heat produced during travel towards the outer surface of the tyre, because the positioning of the additional plies makes it possible to conduct the heat towards the sidewall zones where the rubber mass is less great and therefore permits more rapid evacuation of heat even if the nature of the rubber is not more favourable to good conduction; the low thickness in fact enables the heat to be eliminated more rapidly, the path to be travelled being short from the heart of the rubber mass towards the outer surface. The tyre according to the invention thus makes it possible to reduce the operating temperatures which might lead to a reduction in the life of the tyres.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the additional ply has its axially inner edge adjacent radially to the outside to the edge of the protective ply.<br><br>
10<br>
According to this embodiment of the invention, the additional ply is advantageously in contact with the layer of rubber mix P which makes it possible to decouple the free ends of the reinforcement elements of the different working plies.<br>
Furthermore, the axially outer edge of the additional shoulder ply is for its part advantageously axially adjacent to the profiled element of rubber mix, one of the wings of which, as is known per se, provides the join between the carcass reinforcement and the edges of the radially innermost crown reinforcement plies, and the other wing of which passes down into the sidewall.<br>
According to this latter embodiment, the additional ply makes it possible on one hand to limit the formation and the propagation of cracks in the zones of the ends of the reinforcement elements and, on the other hand, to provide protection from the risks linked to impacts on the sidewall zones. Furthermore, the additional ply permits evacuation of the heat generated in the shoulder zone.<br>
The invention also provides for combining all the aforementioned different embodiments or at least two thereof, in particular the use of a layer P of rubber mixes consisting of a stack of at least two layers of rubber mixes PI and P2 and/or the use of a layer of rubber mix GB and/or the use of a ply of reinforcement elements of small diameter in each shoulder.<br>
Other advantageous details and characteristics of the invention will become apparent hereafter from the description of the examples of embodiment of the invention with reference to Figures 1 to 5, which represent:<br>
Figure 1: a partial view in meridian section of a diagram of a tyre according to one embodiment of the invention,<br>
Figure 2: a partial view in meridian section of a diagram of a tyre according to a second embodiment of the invention,<br>
Figure 3: a partial view in meridian section of a diagram of a tyre according to a third embodiment of the invention,<br>
Figure 4: a partial view in meridian section of a diagram of a tyre according to a fourth embodiment of the invention,<br><br>
Figure 5: a partial view in meridian section of a diagram of a tyre according to a fifth embodiment of the invention.<br>
The figures are not shown to scale in order to simplify understanding thereof.<br>
Figure 1 shows a partial diagrammatic view in meridian section of a tyre 1 of dimension 385/65.R.22.5 X. Figures 1 to 5 show only a half-view of the tyres which are extended symmetrically to the axis XX' which represents the circumferential median plane, or equatorial plane, of a tyre.<br>
The tyre 1 comprises a radial carcass reinforcement composed of a single ply 2 of inextensible metal cables, that is to say, cables which have an elongation of at most 0.2% under a tensile force equal to 10% of the breaking load. Said carcass reinforcement is anchored within each bead; said beads are not shown in Figures 1 to 5. It is surmounted, radially to the outside, by a crown reinforcement 3 comprising radially from the inside to the outside:<br>
-	a first crown ply 30 referred to as a triangulation ply, formed of inextensible metal<br>
cables made of steel, which are oriented at an angle ao, equal in the case described to 50°,<br>
-	radially surmounting said ply 30, a first working crown ply 31, formed of inextensible<br>
metal cables made of steel forming with the circumferential direction an angle 0.1 equal to 18°,<br>
the cables of the triangulation ply 30 and of the first working ply having the same direction,<br>
-radially to the outside and in contact with the working crown ply 31, a layer P of rubber mixes, referred to as decoupling rubber, covering the end of said working ply 31,<br>
-	then a second working crown ply 32 formed of metal cables identical to those of the<br>
first ply 31, and forming with the circumferential direction an angle 0:2 opposed to the angle<br>
ot] and, in the case illustrated, equal in absolute value to said angle cxi of 18°, (but possibly<br>
being different from said angle oti),<br>
-	and finally, radially to the outside of the working crown ply 32, a last ply 33 of what<br>
are called elastic metal cables made of steel, which are oriented relative to the circumferential<br>
direction by an angle 0.3 of the same direction as the angle 0:2, but greater in absolute value<br>
than said angle 0:2 of 8° since it is equal to 26°, this last ply being a what is called a protective<br>
ply.<br><br>
The axial width LI of the first working ply 31 is equal to 0.78 times the maximum axial width So of the centre section of the carcass reinforcement 2 when the tyre is mounted on its operating rim and inflated to its recommended pressure, namely 280 mm, which, for a tyre of conventional form, is less than the width of the tread, which is equal, in the case in question, to 286 mm. The axial width La of the second working ply 32 is less than the width LI, since it is equal to 212 mm. The axial width LO of the triangulation ply 30 is equal to 270 mm, which represents 0.75 So. The width Lj of the protective ply 33 is greater than the width L2 of the least wide and radially adjacent working ply 32, and equal to 260 mm and hence less than the width LI .<br>
The layer P of rubber mix ensures decoupling between the working ply 31 and the end of the radially outer working ply 32. The zone of engagement of the layer P between the two working plies 31 and 32 is defined by its thickness or more precisely the radial distance d between the end of the ply 32 and the ply 31 and by its axial width D of the layer P between the axially inner end of said layer P and the end of the radially outer working crown ply. The radial distance d is equal to 2 mm. The axial distance D is equal to 10 mm, or approximately 6 times the diameter fa of the reinforcement elements of the working ply 32, the diameter fa being equal to 1.65 mm.<br>
Furthermore, the radial distance d', such as defined previously as being the radial distance between the end of the protective ply 33 and the working crown ply 31, is equal to 3.6 mm and is hence greater than the distance d and approximately equal to d + fa.<br>
The distance d", such as defined previously as being the distance between the end of the radially inner working crown ply 31 and the protective ply, is for its part equal to 11.4 mm and hence far greater than the distance d.<br>
Figure 2 is a diagrammatic view in meridian section of a tyre 4, similar to that of Figure 1, which differs from the latter by the presence of a layer P of rubber mixes subdivided into two layers PI, Pa, the layer PI being radially external to the layer P2 and hence at least in contact with the radially outer working ply 32. As for the layer Pa, it is in contact with the radially inner working ply 31. The elasticity moduli at 10% elongation of the layers PI and Pa, respectively MP\ and MP2, are selected such that they satisfy the following relationship: MPi &gt; MPa. Such an embodiment of the tyre 4 makes it possible to reduce the stresses in the layer PI of rubber mix in contact with the working ply 32 compared with the stresses of the layer Pa<br><br>
of rubber mix in contact with the working ply 31, which makes it possible to improve still further the resistance of the crown structure to separation between the ends of the working plies.<br>
Figure 3 is a diagrammatic view in meridian section of a tyre 5, similar to that of Figure 1 and which differs therefrom by the presence of a layer of rubber mix GB radially to the inside of the working reinforcement. This layer of rubber mix GB is put in place such that the axially outer end of said layer GB is at a distance from the equatorial plane greater than L\/2, LI being the axial width of the first working ply 31. The layer GB makes it possible in particular, due to its radially inner position in contact with the end of the working crown ply 31, to improve the resistance to propagation of cracks which may appear at the end of the working ply 31.<br>
Figure 4 is a diagrammatic view in meridian section of a tyre 6, similar to that of Figure 1, which furthermore comprises a ply 7 of reinforcement elements, of small diameter, which are parallel to each other in the ply and oriented radially, the axially inner edge of said additional ply 7 being radially adjacent to at least one edge of the protective ply 33 of the crown reinforcement 3, and the axially outer edge of said additional ply being radially internal to the edge of the ply to which the additional ply 7 is adjacent. The presence of such an additional ply 7 makes it possible in particular to limit the appearance of cracks between the ends of the reinforcement elements of the working plies in particular by a mechanical and thermal protection effect as explained previously.<br>
Figure 5 is a diagrammatic view in meridian section of a tyre 8, similar to that of Figure 1 and which differs therefrom by a ply 33', referred to as a protective ply, of width L'3 such that L's &gt; LI. In this configuration, the protective ply 33' therefore has a greater width than the working ply 31; it is therefore the widest ply of the crown reinforcement. The invention advantageously provides for the distance d", defined as being the distance between the end of the radially inner working crown ply and the supplementary ply, referred to as a protective ply, to be greater than d. The layer P of rubber mixes then acts as a decoupling layer between the radially inner working ply and the protective ply, such that the ends of the reinforcement elements of the radially inner working ply are not stressed owing to the excessive proximity of the reinforcement elements of the protective ply. As explained previously, according to the invention, the reinforcement elements advantageously do not penetrate a circle of radius d<br><br>
centred on the end of the reinforcement elements of the radially inner working ply. Figure 5 shows the distance d" in the radial direction.<br>
Tyres described in accordance with Figure 1 were subjected to endurance testing using running on vehicles and under high drift stresses in comparison with control tyres, having a protective ply which is less wide than the second working ply and formed of reinforcement elements forming with the circumferential direction the same angle as the elements of said working ply.<br>
Whereas the control tyres on average covered 6,686 km, the tyres according to the invention however travelled for 11,493 km, or an increase of approximately 72%, without said tyres being adversely affected by the separations observed between the two working plies.<br>
Other tyres comprising a protective ply which is wider than the radially outer working ply but not comprising a layer of decoupling rubber mixes between the working plies were also tested. Under the same conditions as for the preceding tests, these tyres covered on average 10,595 km or 58% more than the control tyres but 8% less than the tyres according to the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
