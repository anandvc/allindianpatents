(39 of 1970) COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
(See section 10; rule 13)<br>
1.    A PHARMACEUTICAL FORMULATION OF CHROMIUM INSULIN INJECTION (SUSPENSION) AND ITS PREPARATION<br><br>
2.   (a)    L. M. COLLEGE OF PHARMACY,<br>
run by Ahmedabad Education Society, a Registered Trust at<br><br>
(b)	P.O. Box No. 4011, Navarangpura, Ahmedabad-3 80009. Gujarat State, India.<br>
(c)	Nationality: Indian<br>
The  following  specification  particularly  describes  the  nature  of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
The present invention relates to formulation of insulin containing chromium in suspension form, which is stable and to be used as antidiabetic agent and its method of preparation.<br>
A   pharmaceutical   formulation   of  chromium   insulin   injection (suspension)   comprises  porcine  insulin  as   an  active   ingredient  and chromium picolinate as second active ingredient. The State Of Art<br>
Insulin is produced by p-cells of endocrine pancreatic islets, which helps in glucose metabolism. In diabetic condition production of insulin from the P-cells of pancreatic islets is affected. So insulin therapy is given to diabetic patients since years.<br>
Trace elements play important role in altering conditions of hyperglycemias, some of the trace elements which have proven beneficial activity in diabetes are zinc, chromium, vanadium, molybdenum and selenium. Chromium, in the form of chromium chloride and chromium picolinate is widely established to have beneficial effects in diabetes in reducing hyperglycemia and also associated hyperlipidemia.<br>
Chromium (Cr), is a first-series transition element of group VI B which is present ubiquitously in water, soil and living matter (Schroeder et<br><br><br>
al., 1963). Insulin becomes inactive as chromium is depleted because chromium functions as a cofactor for insulin. It binds to the insulin receptor and potentiates many, and perhaps all, of its functions (Boyle et al., Chromium Depletion and the Pathogenesis of Diabetes and Atherosclerosis, Southern Medical Journal 70(12): 1449-1453, 1977). Principle energy sources of the body are carbohydrate (in the form of glucose), proteins and fatty acids. Chromium works with insulin to metabolize carbohydrates, fats and proteins. When chromium depletion results, the body must depend on lipid metabolism to fulfill energy requirements which causes increase production of acetyl-Co A and ketone bodies. Acetyl-Co A is key ingredient for cholesterol biosynthesis and the condition above describe leads to hypercholesterolemia (Boyle et al., Chromium Depletion and the Pathogenesis of Diabetes and Atherosclerosis, Southern Medical Journal 70(12): 1449-1453,1977).<br>
Chromium picolinate is a biologically active form of chromium. Chromium picolinate's preparation, effects and applications are described in many scientific publications. G.W. Evans and D.J. Pouchnik in J. Inorgan. Biochem.,49, 177 (1993) described chromium picolinate general preparation, chemical and biological properties, its clinical effect on insulin<br><br>
metabolism has been indicated by G. W. Evands in Int. J. Biosocial Med. Res., 11, 163 (1989) and its lipid lowering activity has been reported by R. I. Press in West. J. Med., 152, 41 (1990).<br>
Patent US2002081315 describes a composition for treating insulin-dependent diabetes, reducing body fat, improving insulin sensitivity, reducing hyperglycemia, and reducing hypercholesterolemia with at least one chromium complex and a conjugated fatty acid or conjugated fatty alcohol. Here conjugated fatty acids or conjugated fatty alcohol functions synergistically with a chromium complex to facilitate glucose uptake and usage by cells.<br>
US patent 6,143,301 discloses chromium picolinate compositions and uses thereof. The composition of inventions comprising chromic tripicolinate or chromic polyniconinate in combination with at least one of a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, an acid, a mucolyitc and a salicin-containing herb.<br>
US patent 6,323,192 relates to composition of chromic tripicolinate or chromic polynicotinate in the form of enteric-coated tablets, capsules or microbeads, optionally in combination with nicotinic acid, picolinic acid or both nicotinic acid and picolinic acid. The invention further comprises a<br><br>
cyclooxygenase inhibitor, and acid, a mucolytic, a salicin-containing herb, or combination of thereof.<br>
US patent 2002098247 depicts method of improving insulin sensitivity in a subject in need thereof including administering to a subject a pharmaceutically effective dose of alpha-lipoic acid in conjugation with at least one chromium complex.<br>
All the above stated prior inventions are used for improving insulin sensitivity. In these inventions insulin is given separately so the effect required is no up to mark. Also due to this reason cost of diabetic treatment is tremendously increased.Administration of insulin dose with other medicaments are inconvenient.<br>
Patent EP0016496 describes chromium (III) tris-acetylacetonate, as a dietary supplement and pharmaceutical agent used in conjunction with insulin therapy for treating diabetes. This composition is made for oral administration so efficiency depends upon absorption rate of chromium (III) tris-acetylacetonate and insulin which is one limitation of this invention.<br>
To overcome these limitations of insulin formulation occurred in above stated patents, there is need of formulation which reduces the<br><br>
frequent pricking episodes to patient, affordable and stable formulation that regulate metabolism of insulin.<br>
In the present invention a novel formulation of chromium insulin in suspension form is prepared and on continuous usage prevents further dose of insulin and maintain glycemic control on diabetic patients. Detail Description of invention:<br>
The main object of the present invention is formulation of chromium insulin injection (suspension) and its method of preparation.<br>
The insulin dependent diabetes mellitus patients are required to administer insulin in form of injection, tablets etc. Application of insulin injections to diabetic patients is a painful exercise, suspension of chromium insulin prepared in the present invention refrains the painful condition to patients.<br>
Porcine insulin is used as active ingredient and chromium picolinate as trace element which acts as cofactor for insulin. One another object of the present invention is development of insulin formulation which on continuous usage until the diabetic control prevents further use of insulin and maintains glycemic control.<br><br>
It is known that chromium deficiency is associated with the blood sugar irregularities of diabetes. Recent studies have demonstrated that chromium is effective in treating various types of diabetes including type-1 and type-2, gestational and steroid induced diabetes.<br>
In preparation of a novel formulation of chromium insulin injection (suspension) incorporates acetate buffer for adjusting pH, methyl paraben as preservative and water to make final volume of suspension.<br>
A novel formulation of chromium insulin injection (suspension) comprises 60-120 mg porcine insulin, 5-25 ml chromium picolinate (0.03-0.07% w/v), 5-15 ml acetate buffer, 0.1-0.2% w/v methyl paraben and water to make final volume 50 ml of suspension.<br>
Embodiment of the invention relates to process for formulation of insulin with chromium injection in suspension form, which is stable and to be useful as antidiabetic agent which involves following steps of:<br>
(a)	Porcine insulin (60-120 mg) is taken in a 100 ml beaker.<br>
(b)	To this 5-25 ml of chromium picolinate (0.03-0.07% w/v) is added gradually with stirring to get clear solution.<br>
(c)	5-15 ml of acetate buffer solution is added into step no (b) with continuous stirring and suspension is developed.<br><br>
(d)	Suspension pH is found to be 4.3-4.4.<br>
