				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for the single step isolation of alkaline protease from a fermentation broth. More particularly it relates to a process to obtain a highly active alkaline protease in a single step operation from fermentation broth using commercially available hydrophobic ligands. This finds application in food, Pharmaceuticals, detergent and leather processing industries.<br>
Alkaline protease is an industrially important enzyme, it is being used in different field such as food, Pharmaceuticals, detergent, leather processing, protein hydrolysis, peptide synthesis etc [Kiatkamjornwong S, siwarungson N, Nganbunsri A. J. Appl. Poly. Sci. 1999, 73,2273 - 2291; Miyazawa T. Amino Acids. 1999, 16 ,191 - 213; Kamini N R, Hemachander C, Mala J G S, Puvanakrishnan R. Current Science. 1999, 77, 80 -86; Matsumoto T, Furuya N, Tateda K, Miyazaki S, Ohno A, Ishii Y, Hirakata Y, Yamaguchi K. J. Medical Microbiol, 1999, 48, 765-770]. However, the reduction in production costs remains a major concern at commercial level. As the number of purification steps increase, the overall yield of the enzyme also decreases, because each step contributes some loss of the enzyme. To avoid this, there is a need to minimize purification steps which will significantly reduced the production costs of the enzyme. Affinity chromatography is one of the ideal methods to obtained highly purified enzyme in single step operation however, a specific adsorbent has to be prepared for each biological material. Its preparation and utilization may pose serious economical problems at industrial level. The hydrophobic interaction, which is general in biological systems, appears to be suitable for the chromatographic purification of biological materials [Shaltiel S.Er-el Z.Proc Natl Acad Sci USA.1973, 70 , 778-781; Kennedy R M<br>
Methods Enzymol, 1990, 182, 339 - 352. However, since its invention, it is being used in combination with other methods for the purification of enzymes. So far, only multistep purification methods are being used in the isolation of fungal as well as bacterial alkaline protease from fermentation broth. It was reported that the alkaline protease purified using 6 different steps resulted into 12 fold purification with 3.7 % yield [ Chang, H s., Kwon, T J. sanop Misaengmul Hakhoechi (Korean) . 1998, 26,427 - 434]. It was also reported that the alkaline protease was obtained using 3 different step including affinity chromatography on alpha -casein agarose gives 18.5 fold purification with 39% yield [ Hutadilok Towatana N, Painupong a, Suntinanaler P J.J. Ferment. Bioeng. 1999, 87,5, 581 - 587]. So far, no process is reported which have isolated alkaline protease in a single step operation from fermentation broth using hydrophobic ligands.<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the single step isolation of alkaline protease from a fermentation broth.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to decrease the production costs of the enzyme by minimizing the purification steps of the enzyme.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to increase the overall yield of the isolation enzyme.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an improved process for the single step isolation of alkaline protease from a fermentation broth which comprises, loading a fermentation broth containing alkaline protease preferably from fungus Conidiobolus coronatus on a bed of hydrophobic ligand preferably containing butyl and phenyl , equilibrated with a salt solution preferably ammonium sulphate having concentration ranging from 1.0 M to 2.0 M in a buffer selected from a group consisting of glycine-NaOH, borate, Tris ( hydroxy methyl) aminomethane, hydroxidechloride, phosphate and carbonate-bicarbonate, preferably carbonate-bicarbonate washing the unadsorbed by the same salt in buffer solution followed by elution at<br>
a flow rate ranging between 0.10 to 0.20 ml / min. with decreasing salt gradient from 1.5 to 0 M<br>
to obtain the final solution containing the desired product.<br>
In one of the embodiment of the present invention, fermentation broth containing alkaline<br>
protease used may be obtained from any microbial source, preferably fungus Conidiobolus<br>
coronatus.<br>
In another embodiment, the hydrophobic ligand used may be selected from commercially<br>
available hydrophobic ligands preferably butyl and phenyl.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the present invention, the buffer used for equilibration, adsorption,<br>
washing, and elution may be selected from the group consisting of glycine - NaOH , borate, Tris<br>
( hydroxy methyl) aminomethane, hydroxidechloride, phosphate and carbonate- cicarbonate,<br>
preferably carbonate-bicarbonate.<br>
In still another embodiment, the salt used for equilibration, adsorption, washing, and elution may<br>
be selected from the group consisting of salt of sodium, potassium, calcium, halides, acetates,<br>
phosphates, preferably ammonium sulphate.<br>
The process of the present invention is described by following examples, which are illustrative<br>
only and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention in any manner.<br>
Example 1<br>
Preparation of the fermentation broth, the fermentation broth was obtained by drawing a fungus Conidiobolus coronatus. As described elsewhere and used as the alkaline protease source without any pretreatment [Sutar II, srinivasan M C, Vartak H G. Biotech Lett. 1991, 13, 191 - 124]. The enzyme activity was estimated using the method described by Kunitz [ Kunitz M.J. Gen Physiol. 1947, 30, 291 - 310]. The reaction mixture ( 2 ml) contained 10 mg of Hammarsten casein (Merck FRG ) in 0.1 M carbonate- bicarbonate buffer, H 9.7 and suitably diluted enzyme. The reaction was terminated after incubation for 10 minutes at 40°C by adding 3 ml of 5% trichloroacetic acid reagent and precipitate<br>
Example 2<br>
The 2 ml fermentation broth ( 8.4 mg protein ) was loaded on the different hydrophobic ligands packed in a column. The equilibration of the column was carried out with 5 ml EB containing 2 M salt. After washing with 5 ml EB containing 2 M ammonium sulphate the desorption was carried out with 5 ml EB containing no salt. The enzyme activity and protein was estimated in collected samples. Table 1 shows the %adsorption obtained on different hydrophobic ligand.<br>
Table 1<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Example 3<br>
The 2 ml fermentation broth ( 8.4 mg/ ml protein) was loaded on the butyl hydrophobic<br>
ligands packed in a column. The equilibration of the column was carried out with 5 ml EB containing 2.0 M salt. After washing with 5 ml EB containing 2 M ammonium sulphate the desorption was carried out with 5 ml EB containing 2.0, 1.5, 1.0 0.5, and 0.0 M salt. The alkaline protease activity and protein was estimated in collected samples. The 7.86 fold purification [ activity in elution ( U/mg) / activity of feed ( U / mg)] of alkaline protease was obtained.<br>
Example 4<br>
The 1 ml fermentation broth ( 4.2 mg protein ) was loaded on the phenyl hydrophobic ligands packed in a column. The equilibration of the column was carried out with 5 ml EB containing 1.5 M salt. After washing with 5 ml EB containing 1.5 M ammonium sulphate the desorption was carried out using step-wise elution with 5 ml EB containing 1.5, 1.0 0.5, and 0.0 M salt. The enzyme activity and protein was estimated in collected samples. The 8.3 fold purification [activity in elution ( U/mg) / activity of feed ( U / mg)] of alkaline protease was obtained.<br>
Example 5<br>
The 1 ml fermentation broth ( 4.2 mg protein) was loaded on the phenyl hydrophobic ligands packed in a column. The equilibration of the column was carried out with 5 ml EB containing 1.5 M salt. After washing with 5 ml EB containing 1.5 M ammonium sulphate the desorption was carried using gradient elution at the flow rate of 0.15 ml/ min using linearly decreasing salt gradient ( 1.5→0 M) prepared in EB and the alkaline protease activity and protein was estimated in collected samples. The 19.97 fold purification [activity in elution ( U / mg) / activity of feed ( U/ mg)] with 40% yield of alkaline protease was obtained.<br>
Example 6<br>
The 1 ml fermentation broth (4.2 mg protein) was loaded on the phenyl hydrophobic ligands packed in a column. The equilibration of the column was carried out with 5 ml EB containing 1.0 M salt. After washing with 5 ml EB containing 1.0 M ammonium sulphate the desorption was carrfied using gradient elution at a flow rate of 0.3 ml/min using linearly decreasing salt gradient (1.0→0M) prepared in EB and the alkaline protease activity and protein was estimated in collected samples. The 20.23 fold purification [activity in elution (U/mg)/ activity of feed (U/mg)] of alkaline protease was obtained.<br>
