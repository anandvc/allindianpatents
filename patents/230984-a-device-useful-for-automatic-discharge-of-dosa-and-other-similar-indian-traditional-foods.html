				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a device useful for automatic scraping, rolling and discharging of dosa and other similar Indian traditional foods.<br>
The device of the present invention is particularly useful for automatic scraping, rolling and discharging of dosa of different geometrical shapes. The scraping, rolling and discharging of the dosa by using the device of the present invention are of uniform dimension and are obtained in continuous manner. The device of the present invention is therefore useful as a scraping, rolling and discharging device for dosa and other similar Indian traditional foods. Based on radial scraping, rolling and discharging mechanism, the device is proposed for the first time according to this invention. As an important traditional food in India, different varieties of dosas are produced in our country. They are more popular in India and they are considered as a delicacy and gaining popularity. One of the main problems in scraping, rolling and discharging the dosas in large scale is the inherent property of the preparation of dosa which sticks to the hot plate on which it is spread and roasted. The operation of scraping, rolling is done on the dosa-making machine (designed and developed by CFTRI) by the use of a straight edged scraper placed perpendicular to the direction of motion of the hot plate.<br>
Attempt to produce a device for automatic scraping, rolling and discharging (simultaneously) of dosa and other Indian traditional foods is the first of its kind. The present dosa making machine manufacturers are deprived of a suitable device for large-scale scraping, rolling and discharging (simultaneously) of roasted dosa. At present discharging operation of the roasted, scraped and rolled dosa from the dosa making machine is done manually. The operator uses the forceps to transfer the rolled dosa in to the tray or on to the serving plate. In case a device is made available for various operations involved in dosa scraping, rolling and discharging would result in reduction in labor and drudgery on the part of the operator and help<br>
in hygienic discharging / serving of the roasted, scraped, rolled dosas and enhance hygiene in serving of dosas. At present dosas are scraped and rolled according to the pending patent no. 1252 / DEL / 97, titled "A device useful for making dosa and other similar products" uses a scraping blade fixed to the body of the dosa making machine at an angle of 30 degrees. The scraping arrangement comprises of a tapered blade welded to a horizontal bar, which is mounted on to the vertical member of the dosa-making machine. The scraper assembly is pressed against the hot plate and bolted to the vertical member to facilitate scraping of the roasted dosas. Hitherto the process of scraping, rolling is done by a straight edged tapered scraping cum rolling blade in the dosa-making machine (developed by CFTRI). Traditionally the dosas are rolled, discharged manually by the chef / laborers. Most of the production centers are hotels, hostels, industrial canteens and residential schools. Since the processing is done manually there is a scope for unhygienic handling of the product. It is advisable that the dosas are discharged and served hot to the consumers. In order to overcome these difficulties, if a mechanism / device is made available for scraping, rolling and discharging of dosas, it would mechanize large-scale production and discharging and serving of dosas and other similar Indian traditional foods.<br>
The drawbacks of scraping, rolling and discharging in the dosa-making machine and in manual process of preparation are: It is difficult to remove the dosa from the hot plate.<br>
The operator has to stand in front of the hot plate / machine during the operational time. There is a variation in rolling radius of the dosas.<br>
Since the straight edged taper blade is provided on the hot plate, it is very difficult to vary the angle of scraping and rolling blade. The process is labor intensive and human drudgery is very high.<br>
Since the discharging and serving of the dosas are done using a spatula the process is unhygienic. The main object of the present invention is to provide a device for discharging of dosa and other similar Indian traditional foods.<br>
Another object is to provide hygiene during scraping, rolling and discharging through mechanized operation.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to reduce manual drudgery.<br>
Yet another object is to increase productivity.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a device capable of working with a wide range of batters.<br>
Still another object is to provide a device for uniform rolling radius for the dosas.<br>
In the drawing accompanying this specification, figure 1 represents an embodiment of the device for automatic scraping, rolling and discharging of dosa and other similar Indian traditional foods.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a device useful for automatic scraping, rolling and discharging of dosa and other similar Indian traditional food comprising a radial scraper (1) resting on the hot plate of the dosa making machine for scraping the prepared dosa and the radial scraper being provided with a radial diverter (2) for folding and guiding the dosa on to the chute<br>
(6) to be transferred on to the tray, and the holding bar (3) holding down the radial scraper and a radial diverter firmly on the hot plate and the holding bar is held in position by a set of fasteners (5).<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention all the parts of the device are made up of stainless steel<br>
In yet another embodiment the presents provides a device having a holding bar for positioning of scraping, rolling and discharging sub assembly.<br>
In yet another embodiment the presents provides a device having a positioning ring to position the holding bar on to the vertical bar of the dosa-making machine.<br>
In still another embodiment the presents provides a device having a chute for collecting the discharged dosas on to the tray.<br>
The following example is given by way of illustration of the present invention and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. The working of the scraping, rolling and discharging device is explained below with particular reference to dosa.<br>
The total assembly of the device for scraping, rolling and discharging of dosa is placed on the rotating hot plate of the dosa making machine.The roasted dosa prepared by using the dosa-making machine is first scraped by using the radial scraper. The radial diverter welded to the<br>
radial scraper will roll and discharged dosas. The scraped, rolled and discharged dosas are collected on to the tray kept at a convenient height through a chute hygienically. The main advantages of the present invention are:<br>
Dosa is discharged from the hot plate automatically on to the tray / serving plate. The operator need not stand in front of the hot plate / machine which reduces the manual drudgery.<br>
There is no variation in rolling radius of the dosas.<br>
Since the radial scraper is provided on the hot plate, it is very easy to maintain the roll radius of the dosas.<br>
There is no human drudgery involved. Since the discharging and serving of the dosas are done automatically, the process is hygienic.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A device useful for automatic scraping, rolling and discharging of dosa and other<br>
similar Indian traditional foods characterized in that the said device is comprised<br>
of a radial scraper (1) resting on the hot plate of the dosa making machine for<br>
scraping the prepared dosa and radial scraper being provided with a radial<br>
diverter(2) for holding and guiding the dosa on to the chute (6) to be transferred<br>
on to the tray, and the holding bar (3) holding down the radial scraper and a radial<br>
diverter family on the hot plate and the holding bar is held in a position by a set of<br>
