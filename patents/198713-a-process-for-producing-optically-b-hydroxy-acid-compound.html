				<td>The present invention relates to a process for producing an optically active alcohol. More particularly, the invention relates to a novel process suitable for the practical production of an optically active p-hydroxy acid compound useful as an intermediate for medicine or as a functional material, etc.<br>
BACKGROUND ART Conventionally known methods for synthesizing an optically active alcohol compound include 1) a method in which an enzyme such as a baker's yeast is used and 2) a method in which a metal complex is used to asymmetrically hydrogenate a carbonyl compound.  In particular, with respect to the latter method for asymmetric hydrogenation, many proposals have been made.  Known examples thereof include: (1) a method in which a carbonyl compound having a functional group is asymmetrically hydrogenated in the presence of an optically active ruthenium complex catalyst (R. Noyori, Asymmetric  Catalysis  in  Organic Synthesis, pp.56-82 (1994)); (2) a method in which a 1,3-dicarbonyl compound is asymmetrically hydrogenated with the aid of a ruthenium-diphosphine complex (Tetrahedron Asymmetry, Vol.8, pp.3327-3355 (1997)); (3) a method of asymmetric hydrogenation using a ruthenium-optically active phosphine complex (JP-B-6-99367) (the term "JP-B" as used herein<br><br>
means an "examined Japanese patent publication"); (4) a method in which the hydrogen transfer reduction reaction of a carbonyl compound is utilized in the presence of an asymmetric complex catalyst comprising ruthenium, rhodium, or iridium (Chem. Rev.,   Vol,92, pp.1051-1069 (1992))/ (5) a method in which a carbonyl compound is asymmetrically hydrogenated with the aid of a nickel complex modified with tartaric acid (Yu KagaJcu, pp.828-831 (1980), and Y. Izumi, Advances in Catalysis,  Vol.32, p.215 (1983)); (6) a method in which the asymmetric hydrosilylation reaction of a carbonyl compound is utilized (J.D. Morrison, Asyzmnetric Synthesis,   Vol.5, Chap.4 (1985), and J.   Organomet.   Chem., Vol.346, pp.413-424 (1988))/ (7) a method in which a carbonyl compound is reduced with a borane in the presence of an asymmetric ligand {J.   Chem.   Soc.,   Perkin  Trans.   I, pp.2039-2044 (1985), and J.   Am.   Chem.   Soc,   Vol.109, pp.5551-5553 (1987))/ and (8) a method in which an acetophenone compound is asymmetrically hydrogenated in the presence of potassium hydroxide, an optically active diamine, and an asymmetric ruthenium complex catalyst (J. Am.   Chem.   Soc,   Vol.117, pp.2675-2676 (1995)).<br>
However, the above-described conventional methods for synthesizing an optically active alcohol have the following drawbacks. The synthesis method using an enzyme requires a complicated procedure and is restricted in substrates usable in the reaction.  In addition, the alcohol compounds which can be obtained by the method are limited to those<br><br>
having a specific absolute configuration. On the other hand, the synthesis methods using a transition metal catalyst for asymmetric hydrogenation have problems that the rate of reaction is low and the optical purity of the optically active alcohol compound obtained by the asymmetric hydrogenation of a p-keto ester compound is insufficient, although various transition metal complex catalysts have been reported.<br>
Especially in the fields of medicines and functional materials, it is important to obtain an optically active alcohol compound having a specific absolute configuration and a high optical purity and it has hence been necessary to overcome the above-described problems of the conventional methods.<br>
Accordingly, an object of the invention is to provide a novel process in which an optically active alcohol compound having a desired absolute configuration and a high optical purity can be obtained through the asymmetric hydrogenation of a p-keto ester compound.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Under these circumstances, the present inventors made intensive investigations.  As a result, it has been found that when a p-keto ester compound is asymmetrically hydrogenated with the aid of a ruthenium metal complex having as a ligand an optically active [4,4'-bis-1,3-benzodioxol]-5,5'-diylbis(diphenylphosphine) (hereinafter also referred to as "SEGPHOS" simply), then the<br><br>
corresponding optically active alcohol having a high optical purity is obtained. As a result of further extensive studies by the present inventors, the invention has finally been completed.<br>
Accordingly the present invention provides a process for producing an optically active p-hydroxy acid compound represented by the following general formula (III):<br><br>
wherein R' represents a C1-C15 alkyl group which may have one or more substituents selected form halogen atoms, a hydroxyl group, an amino group, amino groups protected by a protective group, amino groups protected by a mineral acid or organic acid, amino groups substituted with one or more C1-C4 lower alkyl groups, a benzyloxy group, C1-C4 lower alkoxy groups, C1-C4 lower alkoxycarbonyl groups, and aryl groups or an aryl group; and R^ represents a Ci-Cg lower alkyl group, or a benzyl group which may have one or more substituents<br>
which  comprises  asymmetrically  hydrogenating  a  p-keto  ester compound represented by the following general formula (I) :<br><br>
wherein R1 and R2 are the same as defined above<br>
in the presence of 1/100 to 1/100,000 mol per mol of the p-keto ester compound (1) of atleast one ruthenium complex such as herein described comprising as a ligand an optically active tertiary diphosphine compound represented by the following general formula (II): <br><br>
wherein R3 and R4 each independently represent a C1-Cs lower alkyl groups and C1-C5 lower alkoxy groups, at a temperature ranging from 20 to 100°C and at a hydrogen pressure of from 0.1 to lOMPa for a period of 1 to 48 hours.<br>
The invention further provides a process for producing the optically active alcohol which comprises conducting the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction in the presence of a specific ruthenium complex.<br>
The invention furthermore provides a process for producing the optically active alcohol which comprises conducting the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction in the presence of a specific acid.<br>

The complexes shown above can be prepared, for example, by<br>
the method described in JP-A-10-182678 or iJP-A-11-269185.<br>
The process of the invention for preparing an optically active alcohol will be explained below. The p-keto ester compound (I) described above, as a starting material, is asjfmmetrically hydrogenated in a solvent in the presence of the ruthenitim complex, whereby an optically active alcohol can be prepared. Preferred examples of the solvent include protic solvents such as methanol, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol. Also preferred is a mixed solvent composed of one or more such protic solvents and one or more of other solvents such as tetrahydrofuran, toluene, benzene, methyl acetate, ethyl acetate, methylene chloride, and the like.  It is more preferred that the p-keto ester compound (I) be dissolved in the solvent before being subjected to asymmetric hydrogenation reaction.<br>
In order for the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction to proceed satisfactorily, the ruthenivim complex is added to the solvent in an amount of preferably from 1/100 to 1/100,000 mol, more preferably from 1/1,000 to 1/50,000 mol, per mol of the p-keto ester compound.  This asymmetric hydrogenation reaction is generally conducted for from 1 to 48 hours with stirring under the conditions of a hydrogen<br><br>
pressure of from 0.1 to 10 MPa, preferably from 1 to 5 MPa, and a temperature of from 0 to 150°C, preferably from 20 to 100°C.<br>
In the invention, the selectivity and conversion of the p-keto ester compound as a starting material can be improved by conducting the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction in the presence of an acid. Preferred examples of the acid include mineral acids such as sulfuric acid and organic acids such as methanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and benzenesulfonic acid.  In this case, such an acid is added in an amount of generally from 0.5 to 10 mole equivalents, preferably from 0.7 to 8 mole equivalents, more preferably from 0.9 to 5 mole equivalents, to the ruthenium complex.<br>
After completion of the asymmetric hydrogenation reaction, the hydrogenation product may be purified in an ordinary manner. Usable purification techniques include a method in which the solvent is removed by distillation and the resulting residue is distilled under reduced pressure, a method in which the hydrogenation product is purified by silica gel column chromatography, and a method in which the hydrogenation product is purified by recrystallization.<br>
The optically active alcohol (III) obtained by the process of the invention will be explained below. The optically active alcohol (III) corresponds to the p-keto ester compound used as a starting material. This is because the keto group of the p-keto ester compound is<br><br>
reduced to a hydroxyl group to give the optically active alcohol (III). Furthermore, either of the (R) isomer and the (S) isomer of the optically active alcohol can be obtained according to the selection of the ruthenium complex.<br>
More specifically, different ruthenium complexes behave in the manners shown by the following scheme 1.<br><br>
(Scheme 1)<br>
It has therefore become possible to freely prepare the optically active alcohol having the desired absolute configuration by selecting a ruthenium complex.<br>
Examples of the optically active alcohol include methyl 3-hydroxybutanoate, ethyl 3-hydroxybutanoate, octyl 3-hydroxybutanoate, benzyl 3-hydroxybutanoate, ethyl 4-chloro-3-hydroxybutanoate, ethyl 6-methyl-3-hydroxyheptanoate, methyl 3-hydroxytetradecanoate, ethyl 4-phenyl-3-hydroxybutanoate, ethyl 3-phenyl-3-hydroxypropionate, and ethyl 4-N-benzyloxycarbonylamino-3-hydroxybutanoate, which all are optically active.<br>
According to the invention, it has become possible to produce an optically active alcohol by the practical<br><br>
process. Namely, the invention has made it possible to efficiently produce through a simple operation an optically active alcohol having a high optical purity and a specific absolute configuration. Because of this, optically active alcohols useful as intermediates for medicines or as functional materials, etc. have become easily producible. Furthermore, by conducting the reaction in the presence of a specific acid, selectivity can be greatly improved while keeping the high optical purity almost unchanged.<br>
The invention will be explained below in more detail by reference to Examples, but the invention should not be construed as being limited to these Examples in any way. The optically active tertiary diphosphine compound used in the invention was synthesized by the method described in JP-A-2000-16997 or JP-A-10-182678. The ruthenium-optically active tertiary diphosphine complexes used were prepared by the method described in JP-A-10-182678.<br>
Among the p-keto ester compounds used in the invention, ethyl 4-benzyloxyacetoacetate was synthesized by the method described in JP-A-6-6522, while methyl benzoylacetate, dimethyl 3-oxooctanedioate, methyl 3-oxooctadecanoate, methyl 3-oxotetradecanoate, methyl 6-methyl-3-oxoheptanoate, and methyl 4-phenyl-3-oxobutanoate were synthesized by the methods described in Yuji Oikawa et al., J.   Org.   Chem.,  Vol.43, pp.2087-2088 (1978) and Heinz Thoma et al., Lxebigs Ann.   Chem.,   pp.1237-1248.<br><br>
Furthermore, methyl 4-amino-3-oxobutanoate hydrochloride was synthesized by the method described in JP-A-11-286479.<br>

EXAMPLE 1 Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Methyl Benzoylacetate<br>
Into a 1-L autoclave was introduced methanol (360 mL) in a nitrogen stream.  Then, [ {RuCl ((R)-SEGPHOS) }2 (μ-Cl)3] [Me2NH2] (82 mg: 0.1 mmol) and methyl benzoylacetate (178 g: 1.0 mol) were added. After hydrogen (4.0 MPa) was forced into the autoclave, the reaction mixture was heated to 80°C and stirred for 5.5 hours to carry out asymmetric hydrogenation reaction. After cooling, methanol was removed from the reaction mixture, and the residue was distilled under reduced pressure (94-99°C/133 Pa) to obtain 170.6 g (yield, 95.3%) of methyl (S)-3-hydroxy-3-phenylpropionate. The asymmetric yield thereof was determined with the HPLC (CHIRALCEL OD-H, 4.6 mm x 250 mm;<br><br>
hexane/isopropyl alcohol = 95/5; flow rate, 1.0 mL/min; detection wavelength, UV-254 nm), and was found to be 97.2%.<br>
EXAMPLE 2 Asymmetric Hydrogenation of Methyl 3-Oxooctadecanoate Into a 100-mL autoclave were introduced methyl 3-oxooctadecanoate (2.0 g: 6.4 mmol), methanol (6 mL), methylene chlorine (3 mL), and [{RuCl((R)-SEGPHOS)}2 (μ-Cl)3] [Et2NH2] (5.2 mg: 0.0064 mmol). After hydrogen (3.0 MPa) was forced into the autoclave, the reaction mixture was heated to 50°C and stirred for 15 hours to carry out asymmetric hydrogenation reaction and thereby obtain methyl (R)-3-hydroxyoctadecanoate.<br>
