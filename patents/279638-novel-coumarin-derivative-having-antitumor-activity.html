				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
NOVEL    COUMARIN    DERIVATIVE    HAVING    ANTITUMOR<br>
ACTIVITY<br>
Technical Field<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to a novel coumarin derivative<br>
having   antitumor   activity,   and   to   a   pharmaceutical   composition<br>
containing the same as an active ingredient, particularly to a therapeutic<br>
agent for a cell proliferative disorder.<br>
Background Art<br>
[0002] It has already been revealed that coumarin derivatives, i.e.,<br>
»<br>
compounds which have a coumarin skeleton as a core structure, and in which the skeleton is derivatized at various positions, have different pharmacological effects depending on the position at which a chemical modification occurs (Non-patent document 31). For example, warfarin, which has antithrombogenic activity, is well known as a drug having a coumarin skeleton (Non-patent document 1). Furthermore, coumarin derivatives which exert antitumor activity by acting on various different target proteins, or coumarin derivatives which inhibit proteins associated with antitumor activity have been obtained by chemical modification at different positions of the core structure. [0003] A coumarin derivative that exerts antitumor activity by inhibiting steroid sulfatase has been reported (Non-patent documents 2 to 6). This is currently in clinical testing. This compound forms a cycloalkyl group at the 3- and 4-positions of the coumarin skeleton, and has a sulfamate group at the 7-position. Its application to breast cancer is being considered from the viewpoint of pharmacological action.<br>
 [0004] Furthermore, as for coumarin derivatives which exert antitumor activity through binding to the estrogen receptor, a group of compounds having a characteristic substituent at the 4-position have been reported. Specifically, there have been reported a group of compounds having an arylalkyl group at the 4-position and having substituents at the 3- and 7-positions (Patent document 1), and a group of compounds in which a phenyl group is directly bound to the skeleton at the 4-position, and which have a phenoxy group at the 3-position (Patent document 2).<br>
Also, as for a coumarin derivative exhibiting Raf inhibitory activity and exhibiting antitumor activity in cells, a compound having a 6-pyrazinyloxy group at the 7-position has been reported (Patent document 5).<br>
[0005] In addition, known are several coumarin derivatives whose target proteins are unknown, and which are reported to exhibit antitumor activity. These include a group of compounds derived from natural sources (Non-patent documents 7 to 12), and a group of new compounds obtained by chemical synthesis (Non-patent documents 13 to 23, 32 to 34). As for the new compounds obtained by chemical synthesis, there have been reported, for example: a compound having alkoxy groups at the 5-, 6- and 7-positions of the coumarin skeleton (Non-patent document 13); a compound having an alkoxy group only at the 7-position of the coumarin skeleton (Non-patent document 14); a compound having an enone functional group at the 6- or 7-position of the coumarin skeleton (Non-patent document 15); a compound having a methyl group at the 4-position of the coumarin skeleton, and substituents at the 7- and 8-positions (Non-patent document 16); acompound having substituents at all of the 4-, 5-, 6-, 7- and 8-positions of the coumarin skeleton (Non-patent document 17); a compound in which an amide group, ester group or sulfonamide group is directly bound to the coumarin skeleton at the 3-position, and which has a substituent at the 6- or 8-position (Non-patent documents 18 and 19); a compound in which an amide group is directly bound to the coumarin skeleton at the 3-position, and which has a substituent at the 7-position (Patent document 3 and Non-patent document 20); a compound having substituents at the 6- and 7-positions of the coumarin skeleton (Nonpatent document 21); a compound having a hydroxy group at the 7-position of the coumarin skeleton, and a nitro group at an appropriate position of the 3-, 6- and 8-positions (Non-patent documents 22 and 23); and a compound having a methoxy or hydroxy group at the 7-position of the coumarin skeleton, a phenyl group at the 3-position, and a substituent at the 4-position.<br>
There have also been reported: a compound having a substituent with a nitrogen atom (diethylamino group, etc.) at the 7-position, a cyano group at the 4-position, and a heteroaryl group at the 3-position (optionally with no substituent at the 4-position) (Non-patent document 32); and a compound having a heteroaryl group at the 3-position, and a methyl group, halogen atom, nitro group, etc. at the 6-, 7- or 8-position (Non-patent document 33). There have also been reported examples of using a compound with a coumarin structure as a ligand for a Pd compound having antitumor activity in cells (Non-patent document 34). [0006] As for compounds which exhibit target protein inhibitory activity, and which are likely to have antitumor activity despite the<br>
absence of a report dealing with their antitumor activity, there have been reported coumarin derivatives exhibiting TNFa inhibitory activity (Patent document 4 and Non-patent documents 24 to 28), aromatase inhibitory activity (Non-patent document 29), MEK inhibitory activity (Non-patent document 30), or the like. In compounds mentioned in these reports, the substituents are located at the 3-, 4-, 6- or 7-position of the coumarin skeleton.<br>
[0007] As described above, although several coumarin derivatives having antitumor activity are known, few of the compounds exhibit a sufficiently high antitumor activity to put it to practical use as an anticancer drug. Therefore, more practical compounds having sufficiently high antitumor activity are still strongly sought.<br>

(Testing   example   1:   Measurement   of cell   proliferation   inhibitory<br>
activity)<br>
The cell proliferation inhibitory activities of the compounds and salts shown in Tables 1-1, 1-2 and Table 2 were measured as follows, using the human colon cancer cell line HCT116 (American Type Culture Collection, VA, USA). 2000 to 3000 cells per well of the human colon cancer cell line HCT116 was placed in a 96-well culture plate, a predetermined concentration (0.00038 uM, 0.00076 uM, 0.0015 µM, 0.0031 µM, 0.0061 µM, 0.012 µM, 0.024 µM, 0.049 µM, 0.098 µM, 0.195 µM, 0.39 µM, 0.78 µM, 1.56 µM, 3.13 µM, 6.25 µM, 12.5 µM, 25 uM or 50 µM) of the test substance was added thereto, and the mixture was then incubated at 37°C under 5% CO2 environment for 4 days. On day 4 of incubation, the Cell Counting Kit-8 solution (Dojindo Laboratories) was added, the absorbance (measurement wavelength: 450 nm; reference wavelength: 615 nm) was measured following the protocol attached to the kit, and the 50% proliferation inhibitory concentration (IC50) was calculated. The results are shown in Tables 1-1, 1-2 and Table 2. [0326] (Testing example 2: Calculation of AUC value)<br>
The AUC (area under the blood concentration-time curve) values of the compounds and salts shown in Table 2 (only compound Ij-2-16-2 is Na salt; the others are free form) were calculated by administering the test substance to an animal and measuring its concentration in plasma. As the animals, BALB/c (nu/nu) mice (4 to 6 weeks old) procured from Japan Charles River Laboratories were used<br>
after a one-week taming period. As for the test substances other than Comp. 1, 5 mg/mL of the substance solution was given at 0.2 mL/ 10 g body weight (dose of the test substance: 100 mg/kg body weight). As for Comp. 1, 10 mg/mL of the substance solution was given at 0.2 mL/ 10 g body weight (dose of the test substance: 200 mg/kg body weight). Administration of the substance solution to a mouse was performed forcibly using an oral feeding tube. Blood was collected from the eye pit 15 minutes, 2 hours, 7 hours and 24 hours after administration of the substance solution, using a hematocrit tube treated with heparin. Paraoxon (final concentration: 1 mM) was added to the collected blood as a stabilizer, the mixture was centrifiiged at 10000 rpm for 3 minutes, and plasma was separated. Lhe plasma was stored in a freezer set to -80°C until the time of measurement. The measurement was carried out as follows. 100 uL of distilled water to which the internal standard substance (a structural homolog, concentration adjusted appropriately depending on the compound used) had been added was added to 5 uL of the plasma, and then, a measurement sample was prepared through solid phase extraction processing using an Oasis HLB uElution Plate (Waters), and was analyzed by LC/MS/MS. The plasma concentration was calculated using a calibration curve prepared based on the ratio of standard substance to internal standard substance in control plasma of mice. The AUC was calculated from the data of plasma concentration of the drug by the trapezoidal method using Microsoft Excel 2003 (Microsoft).    The results are shown in Table 2.<br>
