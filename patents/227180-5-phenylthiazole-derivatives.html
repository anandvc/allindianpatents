Compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, hereinafter referred to alternatively as agents of the invention, are useful as pharmaceuticals. In particular, they exhibit inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (Pi3 kinase) enzymes, especially the gamma isoform (pllOv), which are responsible for generating phosphorylated signalling products. The inhibitory properties of compounds of formula I may be demonstrated in the following test procedures:<br>
Baculovirus expressing different fragments of PBKy fused to GST have been previously described by Stoyanova, S., Bulgarelli-Leva, G., Kirsch, C, Hanck, T., Klinger, R., Wetzker, R., Wymann, M.P. (1997) Lipid- and protein kinase activities of G protein-coupled PI 3-kinase g: structure-activity analysis and interactions with wortmannin. Biochem. J., 324:489. Residues 38-1102 of human PI3Ky are subcloned into the BamHl and EcoRl sites of the transfer vector pAcG2T (Pharmingen) to create a GST-PI3I0y lacking the first 37 residues of PI3Ky. To express the recombinant protein, Sf9 (Spodoptera frugiperda 9) insect cells are routinely maintained at densities between 3 X 105 and 3 X 10s cells/ml in serum containing TNMFH medium {Sigma). Sf9 cells, at a density of 2 X 106 are infected with human GST-PI3KyA34 baculovirus at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 1 for 72 hours. The infected cells are harvested by centrifugation at 1400 g for 4 minutes at 4Â° C and the cell pellets are frozen at -80Â° C. Both Sf9 and Sf21 cells work equally well. Sf9 cells (1X10?) are resuspended in 100 ml cold (4' C) lysis buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,1% Triton X-100,150 mM NaCI, 1 mM NaF, 2 mM DTT and protease inhibitors. Cells are incubated on ice for 30 minutes then centrifuged at 15000 g for 20 minutes at 4Â° C. Purification of the supernatant sample is carried out at 4Â° C by affinity chromatography using SEPHAROSEâ¢ agarose gel beads coupled to glutathione (from Amersham Pharmacia Biotech). A cell lysate/GST resin ratio of 50:1 is used.<br><br>
The GST resin is firstly pre-rinsed to remove ethanol preservative and then equilibrated with lysis buffer. Cell lysate (supernatant) is added (usually as 50 ml lysate to 1 ml GST resin in 5 ml tubes) and gently rotated on a mixer at 4* C for 2-3 hours. The unbound flow through sample is collected by centrifugation at lOOOg for 5 minutes at 4' C using a DENLEYâ¢ centrifuge. The 1 ml GST resin containing bound material is transferred to a 15 ml FALCONâ¢ centrifuge tube for subsequent washing and elution steps. Firstly a series of 3 cycles of washings (mixing by gentle inversion) is performed with 15 ml ice cold wash Buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM DTT) interspersed with centrifugation ai lOOOg for 5 minutes at 4' C. A final single wash step is performed with 15 ml ice cold wash Buffer B (50mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 2 mM DTT) and then centrifuged at lOOOg for 5 minutes ; 4Â° C. The washed GST resin is finally eluted with 4 cycles of 1 ml ice cold elution buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5,10 mM reduced glutathione, 2 mM DTT, 150 mM NaCl, 1 mM NaF, 50% ethylene glycol and protease inhibitors) interspersed with centrifugation at lOOOg for 5 minutes at 4Â° C. Samples are aliquoted and stored at -20Â° C.<br>
An in vitro kinase assay was established that measures the transfer of the terminal phosphate adenosine triphosphate to phosphatidylinositol. The kinase reaction is performed in a whire 9 well microtitre plate as a Scintillation Proximity Assay. Each well contains 10 nl test compound in 5% dimethylsulphoxide and 20 ul assay mix (40 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mi ethyleneglycol-aminoethyl-tetraacetic acid (EGTA), 15 ug/ml phosphatidylinositol, 12.5 uM adenosine triphosphate (ATP), 25 mM MgCh, 0.1 uCi [33P]ATP). The reaction is started by the addition of 20 ul of enzyme mix (40 mM Tris, 200 mM NaCl, 2 mM EGTA containing recombinant GST-pllOy). The plate is incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes and th
Compounds of the Examples hereinbelow have ICso values below 0.6 uM in the aforementioned assay.   For example the compounds of Examples 8, 48, 80, 138,156,165 am 178 have ICS0 values of 0.009, 0.018, 0.013, 0.005, 0.002, 0.019 and 0.040 respectively.<br><br>
Having regard to their inhibition of phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase enzymes, compounds of formula I in free or pharmaceutically acceptable salt form, hereinafter alternately referred to as "agents of the invention", are useful in the treatment of conditions which are mediated by the activation of the Pi3 kinase enzymes, particularly inflammatory or allergic conditions. Treatment in accordance with the invention may be symptomatic or prophylactic.<br>
Accordingly, agents of the invention are useful in the treatment of inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases, resulting, for example, in reduction of tissue damage, airways inflammation, bronchial hyperreactivity, remodelling or disease progression. Inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include asthma of whatever type or genesis including both intrinsic (non-allergic) asthma and extrinsic (allergic) asthma, mild asthma, moderate asthma, severe asthma, bronchitic asthma, exercise-induced asthma, occupational asthma and asthma induced following bacterial infection. Treatment of asthma is also to be understood as embracing treatment of subjects, e.g. of less than 4 or 5 years of age, exhibiting wheezing symptoms and diagnosed or diagnosable as "wheezy infants", an established patient category of major medical concern and now often identified as incipient or early-phase asthmatics. (For convenience this particular asthmatic condition is referred to as "wheezy-infant syndrome".)<br>
Prophylactic efficacy in the treatment of asthma will be evidenced by reduced frequency or severity of symptomatic attack, e.g. of acute asthmatic or bronchoconstrictor attack, improvement in lung function or improved airways hyperreactivity. It may further be evidenced by reduced requirement for other, symptomatic therapy, i.e. therapy for or intended to restrict or abort symptomatic attack when it occurs, for example anti-inflammatory (e.g. corticosteroid) or bronchodilatory. Prophylactic benefit in asthma may in particular be apparent in subjects prone to "morning dipping". "Morning dipping" is a recognised asthmatic syndrome, common to a substantial percentage of asthmatics and characterised by asthma attack, e.g. between the hours of about 4 to 6 am, i.e. at a time normally substantially distant form any previously administered symptomatic asthma therapy.<br>
Other inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases and conditions to which the present invention is applicable include acute lung injury (ALI), adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), chronic obstructive pulmonary, airways or lung disease (COPD, COAD or COLD), including chronic bronchitis or dyspnea associated therewith, emphysema, as well as exacerbation of airways hyperreactivity consequent to other drug therapy, in particular other<br><br>
inhaled drug therapy. The invention is also applicable to the treatment of bronchitis of whatever type or genesis including, e.g., acute, arachidic, catarrhal, croupus, chronic or phthinoid bronchitis. Further inflammatory or obstructive airways diseases to which the present invention is applicable include pneumoconiosis {an inflammatory, commonly occupational, disease of the lungs, frequently accompanied by airways obstruction, whether chronic or acute, and occasioned by repeated inhalation of dusts) of whatever type or genesis, including, for example, aluminosis, anthracosis, asbestosis, chalicosis, ptilosis, siderosis, silicosis, tabacosis and byssinosis.<br>
Having regard to their anti-inflammatory activity, in particular in relation to inhibition of eosinophil activation, agents of the invention are also useful in the treatment of eosinophil related disorders, e.g. eosinophilia, in particular eosinophil related disorders of the airways (e.g. involving morbid eosinophilic infiltration of pulmonary tissues) including hypereosinophilia as it effects the airways and/or lungs as well as, for example, eosinophil-related disorders of the airways consequential or concomitant to Loffler's syndrome, eosinophilic pneumonia, parasitic (in particular metazoan) infestation (including tropical eosinophilia), bronchopulmonary aspergillosis, polyarteritis nodosa (including ChurC1-Strauss syndrome), eosinophilic granuloma and eosinophil-related disorders affecting the airways occasioned by druC1-reaction.<br>
