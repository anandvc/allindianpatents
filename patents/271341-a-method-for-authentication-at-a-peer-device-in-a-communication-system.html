				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR BINDING MULTIPLE AUTHENTICATIONS<br>
Claim of Priority under 35 U.S.C. ยง119<br>
[0001]	The present Application for Patent claims priority to Provisional Application<br>
Serial No. 60/791,321, entitled  METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR BINDING MULTIPLE AUTHENTICATIONS  filed April 11, 2006, assigned to the assignee hereof, and expressly incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND Field<br>
[0002]	The present disclosure relates generally to communication, and more specifically<br>
to techniques for binding authentications.<br>
Background<br>
(0003]	Authentication is widely used to determine the true identity of a given entity, to<br>
determine whether the entity is entitled to receive a particular service, and/or for other purposes. For example, a terminal may attempt to establish communication with a wireless communication network in order to obtain a data service, e.g., Voice-over-Internet Protocol (VoIP). The identity of the terminal may be authenticated by an authentication server for the wireless network to ensure that the terminal can communicate with the network. The terminal may also be authenticated by the same or different authentication sneer to ensure that the terminal has proper subscription and can receive the requested data service.<br>
[0004]	Authentication may be performed by sending secure information from one entity<br>
and verifying this information by another entity. To prevent fraudulent attack, the secure information may be generated based on secret information (e.g.. a cryptographic key) that is known only to these two entities. The secure information may be encrypted data, a message authentication code, or some other information generated based on a cryptographic technique using the secret information.<br>
[0005]	The terminal may perform multiple authentications either sequentially or in<br>
parallel. The terminal may perfomis one authentication tar system access and another authentication for   request. The terminal may also perform device authentication<br><br>
to verify the terminal and user authentication to verify a user of the terminal. It is desirable to perform the multiple authentications in a manner such that these authentications may be tied together, if appropriate.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0006]	Techniques for binding multiple authentications for a peer are described herein.<br>
The peer may perform multiple authentications with one or more authentication servers, which may forward the results of the authentications to one or more authenticators. An authenticator is an entity that initiates and/or facilitates authentication and is typically located at the edge of a communication network. A peer is an entity that responds to an authenticator. An authentication server is an entity that provides authentication service to an authenticator.<br>
[0007]	In one design, multiple authentications for the peer may be bound based on a<br>
unique identifier (UID) for the peer. The unique identifier may be a pseudo-random number and may be exchanged securely between the peer, an authentication server, and an authenticator in order to prevent man-in-the-middle (Mitt) attack. Data for all authentications bound by the unique identifier may be exchanged securely based on one or more cryptographic keys generated by all or a subset of these authentications.<br>
[0008]	According to an aspect, an apparatus for a peer obtains a unique identifier for the<br>
peer and performs multiple authentications with at least one authentication server. The unique identifier is used to bind the maniple authentications to the peer.<br>
[0009]	According to another aspect, an apparatus for an authentication server obtains a<br>
unique identifier for a peer, performs authentication with the peer, and associates the unique identifier with the peer.<br>
 	According to yet another aspect, an apparatus for an authenticator receives<br>
results of at least one authentication between at least one authentication server and a peer. The apparatus binds the at least one authentication to the peer based on a unique identifier.<br>
[0011]	In another design, multiple levels of security (or nested security) may be used<br>
for multiple authentications for a peer. The peer may perform a first authentication with a first authentication server and obtain a first cryptographic key. The peer may also pardon a second authentication with a second authentication server and obtain a second cryptographic key. The peer may thereafter securely exchange data using the two keys.<br><br>
[0012]	According to yet another aspect, an apparatus is described which generates a<br>
first packet for data in accordance with first security information obtained from a first authentication, generates a second packet carrying the first packet in accordance with second security information obtained from a second authentication, and sends the second packet.<br>

detail below.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0022]	The techniques described herein may be used for various communication<br>
networks such as wide area networks (WANs), local area networks (LANs), wireless WANs (WWANs), wireless LANs (WLANs), etc. The terms "networks'" and "systems" are often used interchangeably. The  may be Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA) networks. Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA) networks. Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA) networks, Orthogonal FDMA (OFDMA) networks, Single-Carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) networks, etc. A CDMA network may implement a radio technology such as Wideband-CDMA (W-CDMA). cdma2000, etc. cdma2000 covers IS-2000, IS-95 and lS-856 standards. A TDMA network may implement a radio technology such as Global System for Mobile Communications (GSM). The WLANs may implement IEEE 802.11. Hyperlink. etc. These various radio technologies and standards are known in the art.    For clarity, certain aspects of the techniques are<br><br>
described using terminology defined in RFC 3748, entitled "Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP)," June 2004, which is publicly available.<br>
[00231	FIG. 1 shows a deployment 100 in which a peer 110 may perform multiple<br>
authentications. For simplicity, only logical entities related to authentication are shown in FIG. 1. A deployment may include other network entities not shown in FIG. 1.<br>
[0024]	Peer 110 may be any device such as a cellular phone, a personal digital assistant<br>
(PDA), a wireless communication device, a handheld device, a wireless modem, a laptop computer, a cordless phone, etc. Peer 110 may also be referred to as a mobile station, a station, a user equipment, a terminal, an access terminal, a subscriber unit, a mobile equipment, etc.<br>
[0025]	In the example shown in FIG. 1, the network side includes L enforcement points<br>
120a through 1201. M authenticators 130a through 130m, and N authentication servers 140a through 140n for N providers 150a through 150n, where in general L &gt; 1, M &gt; 1, and N &gt; 1. Peer 110 may communicate with enforcement point 122a. Each enforcement point 120 may communicate with one or more other enforcement points 120 and/or why one or more authenticators 130. Each authenticator 130 may communicate with one or more enforcement points 120. one or more other authenticators 130. and/or one or more authentication servers 140. FIG. 1 shows an example connection among the entities in deployment 100. These entities may also be connected in other manners, e.g.. the dashed connections may be omitted. An enforcement point is an entity that enforces or applies any authentication that a peer has completed on inbound and outbound data for the peer. The enforcement points, authenticators, and authentication servers are logical entities, and one or more of these entities may be co-located within a physical network entity. The enforcement points and authenticators may be separate network entities, as shown in FIG. 1. A single network entity may also perform the functions of different logical entities such as an enforcement point and an authenticator. The various logical entities in FIG. 1 are described in RFC 3748.<br>
[0026]	Enforcement  points   120  and  authenticators   130  may  be  implemented by<br>
different network entities in different communication networks. In a WLAN, an enforcement point may be implemented by an access point, and an authenticator may be implemented by a WLAN switch. In a cellular network, an enforcement point may be implemented by a base station, and an authenticator may be implemented by a Radio<br><br>
Network Controller (RNC). An authentication server may be implemented by an Authentication, Authorization and Accounting (AAA) server in both a WLAN and a cellular network.<br>
[0027]	FIG. 2 shows a message flow torr an authentication process 200. Peer 110 may<br>
initially send an access request to enforcement point 120a, which may forward the request to authenticator 130a (step 210). For the authentication process, enforcement point 120a may simply forward messages between peer 110 and authenticator 130a and is not shown in FIG. 2 for clarity. Peer 110 may send the access request as well as other messages to authenticator 130a using a lower layer identifier LIDpeer assigned to peer 110. A lower layer identifier may be a Medium Access Control (MAC) address or some other lower layer identifier used between a peer and an authenticator/enforcement point. Authenticator 130a may receive the access request, determine that it has no record for peer 110, and send an authentication request to peer 110 (step 212).<br>
[0028]	Peer 110 may respond to the authentication request by sending an authentication<br>
response that may include an address or identity of an authentication server to be used for authentication of peer 110. a network access identifier NAIpeer assigned to peer 110. etc. (step 216). In this example, authentication server 140a is selected by peer 110. and the authentication response may include the address of authentication server 140a (Server a). The NAIpecr may be any identifier used between peer 110 and authentication server 140a and may not need to be known by authenticator 130a. Peer 110 may thus send an anonymous authentication response and omit the NAIpeer. Authenticator 130a may receive the authentication response from peer 110 and send a peer authenticafion request to authentication server 140a, which is identified by the authentication response (step 218). Authenfication server 140a may then exchange messages with peer 110 for authentication of peer 11D or for mutual authentication (step 220). Authentication server 140a may have credentials (e.g.. a username and a password) for peer 110 and may authenticate peer 110 based on the credenfials. Similarly, peer 110 may have stored information for authentication server 140a and may authenticate the server based on the stored information. The authentication in step 220 may be performed based on any authentication scheme such as Authentication and Key Agreement (AKA), Transport Layer Security (TLS). Toiled TLS (TTLS), etc.. which are known in the art.<br><br>
[0029]	After authentication is completed, authentication server 140a may send a peer<br>
authenticated message to authenticator 130a (step 222). This message may include pertinent information such as, e.g., a cryptographic key KEYi to use for communication with peer 110, a key ID for KEY, (Keyl ID), etc. A cryptographic key is also referred to as simply, a key. Authenticator 130a may forward the pertinent information to enforcement point 120a (not shown in FIG. 2). Enforcement point 120a may use KEYi or a derived key generated from KEY| for encryption and/or integrity protection of data exchanged between enforcement point 120a and peer 110. Encryption refers to a process of randomizing data with a key such that the original data is unrecognizable and the encrypted data may be recovered with the same key or a complementary key depending on the type of cryptography. Integrity protection refers to a process of generating a message authentication code for data with a key and sending this code along with the data. The message authentication code may be used by a recipient entity to verify that the sending entity used the correct key to generate the code and that the data has not been altered. Data for the authentication, which is data that is permitted to be sent by :he authentication. may be securely exchanged using the key generated by the authentication.<br>
[0030]	FIG. 2 shows an example message flow in which authenticator 130a initiates<br>
authentication. Peer 110 may also initiate authentication. In such a case, the authentication request/response messages may be reversed in direction. In general, fewer, additional and/or different steps may be used for a message flow for authentication. Each step in the message flow may represent one or more messages sent by one entity or multiple messages exchanged between different entities.<br>
[0031]	FIG. 2 shows one authentication between peer 110 and authentication shiver<br>
140a. Peer 110 may perform maniple authentications with one or more'authentication servers, e.g.. for access and service authentications, for device and user authentications, for network access provider (NAP) and Internet service provider (ISP) authentications, etc. The multiple authentications may be performed (i) sequentially so that one authentication is completed before the next authentication is started, (ii) in parallel so that more than one authentication may be pending at a given moment, or (iii) a combination of both. The muhiple authentications may be via the same or different authenticaiors. For example, different authenticators may be used for li) different types of authentication in some architectures, (ii) for access and service authentications when<br><br>
the access and service providers are different, etc. The multiple authentications may also be with the same or different authentication servers. Multiple authentications may be especially applicable when different authentication servers need to authenticate peer 110 for different reasons, e.g., when the access and service providers are different.<br>
[0032]	In general, an authentication may or may not result in a key being generated and<br>
passed to an authenticator. When multiple authentications are performed, each authentication may generate a different key, a subset of the authentications may generate keys, or none of the authentications may generate key. When at least one authentication is not key generating, a man-in-the-middle attack may be possible.<br>
[0033]	FIG. 3  shows two authentications for peer  110 with a man-in-the-middle<br>
(MiTM) attack. Peer 110 may perform a first authentication with authentication server 140a via authenticator 130a using the LlDpeer and NAlpeer of peer 110. e.g., as described above for FIG. 2. Peer 110 may be authenticated by authentication server 140a based on valid credentials stored at server 140a for peer 110.<br>
[0034]	A MiTM attacker 112 may also perform an authentication with authentication<br>
server 140a via authenticator 130a using a lower layer identifier LIDMITM and a network access distiller NAIMJTM assigned to MiTM attacker 112. MiTM attacker 112 may be authenticated by authentication server 140a based on valid credentials stored at server '.40a for MiTM attacker 112.<br>
[0035]	Peer 110 n-^ay attempt a second authentication with authentication server 140a<br>
via authenticator 130a using the LlDpeer and Nicer of peer 110. MiTM attacker 112 may intercept the authentication response from peer 110 ior the second authentication, replace the Lisper of peer 110 with the LIDMITM of attacker 112. and forward the tampered authentication response to authenticator 130a. Authenticator 130a may have no way to detect that the authentication response from MiTM attacker 112 has been tampered and may carry out the authentication in the normal manner. MiTM attacker 112 may be authenticated by authentication server 140a and may obtain service using its LIDMITM and the NArpi..er of peer 110. Billings related to the second authentication may be redirected to peer 110. which is assigned NAlpeer-<br>
[0036]	In FIG. 3. the thirst authentication for peer 110 may generate a key, and this key<br>
may be used to authenticate data from peer 110. The first and second authentications torr peer 110 may occur sequentially or in parallel.   The second authentication for peer<br><br>
no may be either not key generating or key generating but no key is used to authenticate data from peer 110.<br>
[0037]	In an aspect, multiple authentications for a peer may be bound based on a unique<br>
identifier for the peer. The unique identifier may be exchanged securely between the peer, an authentication server, and an authenticator in order to prevent an MiTM attack. Data for all authentications bound by the unique identifier may be exchanged securely based on one or more keys generated by all or a subset of these authentications.<br>
[0038J	FIG.  4  shows  a  message  flow  for a  process  400  for  binding  multiple<br>
authentications with a unique identifier. Peer 110 may initially send an access request to authenticator 130a using the LlDpcer of peer 110 (step 410). Authenticator 130a may respond by sending an authentication request to peer 110 (step 412).<br>
[0039]	For the first authentication, peer 110 may derive a unique identifier LlDpeer for<br>
itself as described below (step 414). Peer 110 may then send an authentication response that may include the address of authentication server 140a to be used for the first authentication- the   of peer 110. etc. (step 416). The UIDpeer may be sent in a secured manner (.e.g.. using encryption and/or integrity protection) based on a key shared between peer 110 and authentication server 140a. The UIDpeer may be carried from peer 110 to authentication server 140a, e.g., via an EAP method described in RFC 3748 or some other secure method. The other information (e.g., the NAIpecr) may or may not be sent in a secured manner along with the UIDpeer-Authenticator 130a may receive the authentication response from peer 110 and send a peer authentication request to authentication server 140a (step 418).<br>
[0040]	Authentication server 140a may then exchange messages with peer 110 for<br>
authentication of peer 110 or for mutual authentication (step 420). After authentication is completed, authentication server 140a may send   a given item (e.g., multiple authentications, multiple keys, etc.) together. Binding, associating, and mapping are synonymous terms that may be used interchangeably.<br>
[0041]	After   completing   the   first   authentication,   or   in   parallel   with   the   first<br>
authentication, peer 110 may send a service request to authenticator 130a using the LIDpeer of peer 110 (step 430). Authenticator 130a may respond by sending an authentication request to peer 110 (step 432). In general, the second authentication may be triggered by peer 110 (e.g., if peer 110 knows that multiple authentications are to be performed, e.g., for device and user authentications) or by an authenticator.<br>
|0042|	For the second authentication, peer 110 may use the same UIDpeer derived<br>
previously for the first authentication. Peer 110 may send an authentication response that may include the address of authentication server 140a to be used for the second authentication, the NAIpeer and UIDpeer of peer 110, etc. (step 436). Again, the UIDpeer may be sent in a secured manner. Authenticator 130a may receive the authentication response from peer 110 and may send a peer authentication request to authentication server 140a (step 438).<br>
(0043]	Authentication server 140a may then exchange messages with peer 110 for<br>
authentication (step 440). After authentication is completed, authentication server 140a may send a peer authenticated message to authenticator 130a (step 442). This message may include pertinent information such as. e.g.. a key KEY2 to use for communication with peer 110, a key ID for KEY2. the UIDpeer of peer 110. etc. In general, KEY? may or may not be generated by the second authentication. Authenticator 130a may receive the peer authenticated message, extract the UIDpeer from the message, and recognize that this UIDpeer is already stored at authenticator 130a. Authenticator 130a may then determine that this authentication is for the same peer 110 based on the matched UIDpeer- Authcnticator 130a may bind the second authentication as well as KEY  (if generated by the second authentication) to the UIDpeer (step 444). Authenticator 130a essentially binds the first and second authentications for peer 110 to the same UIDpeer-<br>
[0044]	In the example shove in FIG. 4. peer 110 may send an access request for a<br>
different network to authenticator 130a using the LIDpeer of peer 110 (step 450). Authenticator 130a may respond by sending an authentication request to peer 110 (step 452). In general, the third authentication may be triggered by peer 110 or an authenticator and mav be for anv reason.<br><br>
[0045]	For the third authentication, peer  110 may use the same  UIDpeer derived<br>
previously for the first authentication. Peer 110 may send an authentication response that may include the address of authentication server 140n (Server n) to be used for the third authentication, the NAIpeer and UIDpeer of peer 110, etc. (step 456). Again, the UIDpeer may be sent in a secured mailer. Authenticator 130a may receive the authentication response from peer 110 and may send a peer authentication request to authentication server 140n, which is selected by peer 110 (step 458).<br>
[0046]	Authentication server 140n may then exchange messages with peer 110 for<br>
authentication (step 460). After authentication is completed, authentication server 140n may send to authenticator 130a a peer authenticated message that may include pertinent information such as, e.g., a key KEY3 to use for communication with peer 110, a key ID for Key, the UIDpeer of peer 110, etc. (step 442). In general, KEY3 may or may not be generated by the third authentication. Authenticator 130a may receive the peer authenticated message, recognize that this UIDpeer is already stored at authenticator 130a. and bind the third authentication as well as KEY3 (if generated) to the UIDpeer (step 464). Authenticator 130a essentially binds the first, second and third authentications for peer 110 to the same UIDpeer- even though these authentications were performed via different authentication servers 140a and 140n.<br>
[0047]	In general, peer 110 may parfait any number of authentications with any<br>
number of authentication servers. These multiple authentications may be performed sequentially (as shown in FIG. 4). or in parallel (not shown in FIG. 4). or a combination of both. Euclid authentication may be mutually authenticating so that peer 110 is authenticated to an authentication server and the authentication server is also authenticated to peer 110. Each authentication may or may not generate a key. Authenticator 130a may bind ail authentications and all keys with the same UIDpeer to peer 110. Only one authentication may be key generating, and all authentications bound with this authentication may securely exchange data based on the key from this one authentication.<br>
[0048]	The   UIDpeer   may   be   securely   exchanged   between   peer   110   and   each<br>
authentication server, e.g.. using encryption and/or integrity protection based on credentials known by peer 110 and the authentication server. In this case, an MiTM attacker would not be able to intercept the UIDpeer and hijack the authentication<br>
exchange.<br><br>
  design shown in FIG. 4, peer 110 sends the UIDpeer in the authentication<br>
response to authenticator 140a in steps 416. 436 and 456, and authenticator 140a forwards the UIDpeer to authentication servers 140a and 140n. Peer 110 may also send the UIDpeer at other times, e.g., in steps 420, 440, 460, etc.<br>
[0050]	In general, a UID may be derived in various manners.  In one design, peer 110<br>
generates a pseudo-random number (PRN) and uses this PRN as the UID. Different peers may independently generate different PRNs. The likelihood of two peers generating the same PRN, which is referred to as a collision, is dependent on the length of the PRN. For example, if the PRN has a length of 32 bits, then the probability of collision may be 1 /2^". In general, the PRN may be any length, e.g., 32 bits, 48 bits, 64 bits. etc. The PRN may be defined to be sufficiently long to achieve the desired probability of collision. PRNs of the same length may be used for all authentications. Alternatively, PRNs of different lengths may be for different authentications, where the PRN length for each authentication may be dependent on security requirements and/or other factors.<br>
10051]	In another design, an ID assigned to peer 110 or a pseudo version of this ID may<br>
be used as the UID. For example, the UID may be an Electronic Serial Number (ESN), a Mobile Equipment Identifier (MEID), an International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). a Mobile Identification Number (MIN). a pseudo-ESN. a temporary IMSI, or some other true or pseudo ID assigned to peer 110. In yet another design, an address assigned to peer 110 may be used as the UID. For example, the UID may be a MAC address, an IP address, etc. In general, an ID or address of any kind that is unique to a peer (or has sufficiently low probability of collision) may be used as the UID for binding authentications for the peer.<br>
[0052]	A single UID may be used for all authentications for peer 110.   All of these<br>
authentications may be bound to this single UID. The authentications for peer 110 may also be divided into multiple groups, with each group including one or more authentications. A different UID may be used for each group. All authentication(s) in each group may be bound by the UID for that group. In general, om UID may be used for all authentications to be bound together. A given UID may be used for one or more authentications.<br>
|0053)	In the design shown in FIG. 4, peer 110 may derive a UID and securely send this<br>
UID to each   server. A UID may also be generated by an entity other than<br><br>
peer 110. In another design, an authentication server may generate an UID and provide this UID to both peer 110 and an authenticator. Peer 110 may inform the authentication server for the first authentication (e.g., during step 420) that a UID has not been generated for peer 110. In response, the authentication server may generate a UID for peer 110. Peer 110 may use this UID for each subsequent authentication to be bound with the first authentication. In yet another design, an authenticator may generate a UID for peer 110.<br>
[00541	In the example shown in FIG. 4, peer 110 pilgrims multiple authentications via<br>
a single authenticator 140a, which binds all of the authentications and keys to the   remaining authenticators may pass only the UIDpeer of peer 110. If tile multiple authentications are enforced by multiple enforcement points, then each enforcement point may receive the UIDpeer of peer 110 and any associated security information for the authentication(s) to be enforced by that enforcement point. In general, each enforcement point may enforce all authentications responsible by that enforcement point based on security infuriation associated with the authentications being enforced.<br>
[0056|	The binding of multiple authentications via a single UID allows a key generated<br>
by one authentication to be used for data exchanges for another authentication. In fact, a single key generated by a since authentication may be used for all of the authentications. Data for an authentication that is non-key generating may be securely sent using a key from another authentication that is key generating. This is possible since the two authentications are bound to the same Kid and hence the same peer.<br>
[00571	Muhiple keys may be generated by the muhiple authentications.   In this case,<br>
secure data exclaimers for the multiple authentications may be achieved in various manners.  In one design, a single key may be selected from among the muhiple keys and<br><br>
used to securely send data for all authentications. In another design, the multiple keys may be used to generate a compound key, which may then be used to securely send data for all authentications. In yet another design, the data for each key-generating authentication may be securely sent using the key generated by that authentication. The data for each non-key generating authentication may be securely sent using a key from a key-generating authentication or a compound key. Data for the multiple authentications may also be securely sent in other manners.<br>
[0058]	FIG. 5 shows a design of a process 500 performed by a peer for multiple<br>
authentications with a unique identifier. A unique identifier for the peer may be obtained (block 512). Multiple authentications may be performed with at least one authentication server, with the unique identifier being used to bind the multiple authentications to the peer (block 514). The unique identifier may be derived by the peer based on a pseudo-random number, an identifier or an address assigned to the peer, etc. The unique identifier may be securely sent by the peer to each authentication server using encryption and/or integrity protection. The unique identities may also be obtained by the peer from an authentication server or an authenticator. The multiple authentications may be performed sequentially and/or in parallel and may be for access authentication, service authentication, device authentication, user authentication, NAP authentication, ISP authentication, etc.<br>
[0059J	At   least   one   cryptographic   key   may   be   obtained   from   the   multiple<br>
authentications (block 516). Data for the multiple authentications may be securely exchanged based on the at least one cryptographic key (block 518). For example, a cryptographic key may be obtained from a first authentication and used to securely exchange data for a second authentication.<br>
[0060]	FIG. 6 shows a design of a process 600 performed by an authentication server.<br>
A unique identifier for a peer may be obtained, e.g., securely received from the peer or an authenticator, or generated by the authentication server (block 612). Authentication may be performed with the peer (block 614). The unique identifier may be associated with the peer (block 616). An indication of the peer being authenticated, the unique identifier, and possibly security intonation (e.g., a cryptographic key) may be sent to an authenticator. which may use the unique identifier to bind the authentication to the peer (block 616).<br><br>
[0061]	FIG. 7 shows a design of a process 700 performed by an authenticator. Rhesus<br>
of at least one authentication between at least one authentication server and a peer may be received (block 712). The at least one authentication may be bound to the peer based on a unique identifier (block 714). At least one cryptographic key may be obtained from the results of the at least one authentication (block 716). Either the at least one cryptographic key or at least one derived key (which may be generated based on the at least one cryptographic key) and possibly the unique identifier may be forwarded to an enforcement point for the at least one authentication (block 71 (S). The at least one authentication may also be enforced by the authenticator based on the at least one cryptographic key. Results of one or more other authentications for the peer and the unique identifier may also be received from another authenticator. The at least one authentication and the one or more other authentications for the peer may be bound based on the unique identities.<br>
[0062]	In another aspect, multiple levels of security (or nested security) may be used for<br>
multiple authentications for a peer. For example, peer 110 may perform a thirst authentication (e.g.. access or device authentication) with a first authentication server and obtain a first key]. Peer 110 may also preterm a second authentication (e.g., service or user authentication) with a second authentication server and obtain a second key KE^'). Data for the desired service may thereafter be securely exchanged using the two keys KEY] and KEY:.<br>
[0063]	In general, peer 110 may person any number of authentications with any<br>
number oi authentication servers. Each authentication may or may not be key generating. A key generated by a given authentication may be used to securely exchange data for that authentication.<br>
|0064|	For nested security, the multiple authentications may be performed via one or<br>
more   and may be enforced by one or more enforcement points. Each authenticator may obtain one or more keys for one or more authentications and may bind all of the   to the peer. e.g.. based on the LID or some other ID for the peer. Each enforcement point may receive one or more keys for one or more authentications from one or more authendcators. Each enforcement point may securely exchange data with the peer using the one or more keys received by that enforcement point.<br>
[0065]	FIG. 8 shows nested security for two authentications.  Authentication 1 may be<br>
for   authentication 2 mad be access authentication.   Data for<br><br>
authentication 1 may be exchanged between peer 110 and an enforcement point for a service provider. Data for authentication 2 may be exchanged between peer 110 and an access point in an access network. The same or different enforcement points may be used for authentications 1 and 2.<br>
[0066J	Packet 1 for authentication 1 may include a header, a payload, and a trailer. The<br>
payload may carry data, which may be encrypted and/or integrity protected with a key generated by authentication 1. The header may carry a key ID of the key generated by authentication 1 and used for the data sent in the payload. The trailer may carry a message authentication code (MACl). which may be generated based on the data sent in the payload with the key generated by authentication 1. The message authentication code may be used by a recipient of the packet to verify the integrity of the data sent in the payload as well as proof of ownership of the key used by a sender of the packet.<br>
10067]	Similarly, packet 2 for authentication 2 may include a header, a payload, and a<br>
trailer. The payload for packet 2 may carry the entire packet 1. which may be encrypted and/or integrity protected with a key generated by authentication 2. The leader may carry a key ID of the key generated by authentication 2. The trailer may carry a message authentication code (MAC2) generated based on the data in the payload of packet 2 and with the key generated by authentication 2.<br>
[0068]	Peer 110 may preform:! the nested processing shown in FIG. 8 to send data for<br>
authentications 1 and 2. If a single enforcement point is used for both authentications 1 and 2. then this enforcement point may extract (e.g.. decrypt and/or verify) data from both payloads in both packets 1 and 2. If different enforcement points are used for authentications 1 and 2, then the enforcement point for authentication 2 may extract the data from the payload of packet 2, and the enforcement point for authentication 1 may extract the data from the payload of packet 1.<br>
[0069]	In another design, data is securely processed (e.g.. encrypted and/or integrity<br>
protected) with the keys generated by both authentications 1 and 2 to obtain a data packet. For example, data may be securely processed with the key generated by authentication 1 to obtain first processed data, which may be further securely processed with the key generated by authentication 2 to obtain second processed data, which may be sent in the payload of the data packet. The data packet may include a single header, which may contain the key IDs of both   The data packet may fur. her include a sinizle trailer that mad include MACl and/or MAC2.<br><br>
[0070]	FIG. 9 shows a design of a process 900 performed by a peer for multiple<br>
authentications with nested security. First and second authentications may be pardoned with at least one authentication server (block 912). The first authentication may be performed with a first authentication server, and the second authentication may be performed with the first authentication server or a second authentication server. First and second security intonation, e.g., first and second cryptographic keys, may be obtained for the first and second authentications, respectively (block 914). Thereafter, a data packet may be generated with the first and second security information obtained from the first and second authentications (block 916).<br>
[0071]	In one design, data may be securely processed (e.g., encrypted and/or integrity<br>
protected) based on the first security information (e.g.. the first cryptographic key) to obtain an initial packet. The initial packet may be securely processed based on the second security information (e.g.. the second cryptographic key) to obtain the data packet. In another design, data may be securely processed with both the first and second security information to obtain the data packet. The same secure processing (e.g., encryption and/or integrity protection) may be performed   each of the first and second security infonnation. Alternatively, one type of secure processing (e.g., encryption) may be perfonned with the first security infonnation, and another type of secure processing (e.g.. integrity protection) may be perfonned with the second security infonnation.<br>
[0072]	In   yet   another   aspect,   sequential   security   may   be   used   for   multiple<br>
authentications for a peer. For example, peer 110 may perform first authentication with a first authentication server and obtain a first key KEYi. After completing the first authentication, KEYi may be used for secure processing for each subsequent authentication. The subsequent authentications may be performed sequentially or in parallel after the first authentication.<br>

[0074]	Peer 110 may send data to enforcement point 120a. The data may be processed<br>
by processor 1010 and conditioned by transceiver 1016 to generate a modulated signal, which may be transmitted via an antenna. At enforcement point 120a, the signal from peer 110 may be received and conditioned by transceiver 1026 and further processed by processor 1020 to recover the data sent by peer 110. Enforcement point 120a may also send data to peer 110. The data may be processed by processor 1020 and conditioned by transceiver 1026 to generate a modulated signal, which may be transmitted to peer 110. At peer 110. the signal from enforcement point 120a may be received and conditioned by transceiver 1016 and processed by processor 1010 to recover the data sent by enforcement point 120a.<br>
|0075j	Processor 1010 may perform processing for peer 110 for authentication, data<br>
