				<td>BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates generally to baseband signal processing in mobile<br>
communication systems and, more particularly, but not by way of limitation, to a dualcore<br>
signal-processing approach for use in mobile terminals operating according to<br>
GSM, GPRS, or EDGE.<br>
History of Related Art<br>
In baseband signal processing for, for example, Global System for Mobile<br>
communications (GSM), General Packet Radio Service (GPRS), or Enhanced Data for<br>
GSM Evolution (EDGE) systems, there are numerous ways to implement the necessary<br>
signal-processing functionality. Different implementations are often measured with<br>
respect to four ""parameters: 1) cost (e.g., silicon size of the implementation); 2)<br>
performance (e.g., quality of employed algorithms); 3) flexibility (e.g., ability to<br>
upgrade and improve system functionality); and |) current consumption, particularly in<br>
idle mode. A system that excels in all parameters would be very attractive for<br>
implementation.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
A processing system includes a first digital signal processor adapted to perform<br>
tasks on a first time basis and a second digital signal processor adapted to perform tasks<br>
on a second time basis. The second time basis is an integer multiple of the first time<br>
basis.<br>
In a system including a plurality of digital signal processors, a processing<br>
method includes performing, by a first digital signal processor, of tasks on a first time<br>
basis and performing, by a second digital signal processor, of tasks on a second time<br>
basis. The second time basis is an integer multiple of the first time basis.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
A more complete understanding of the present invention may be obtained by<br>
reference to the following Detailed Description of Illustrative Embodiments of the<br>
Invention, when taken in conjunction with the accompanying Drawing, wherein<br>
FIGURE 1 is a dual-core (e.g., dual-DSP) system in accordance with principles<br>
of the invention; and<br>
FIGURE 2 is a multi-core (e.g., multiple-DSP) system in accordance with<br>
principles of the invention.<br>
Detailed Description of Illustrative Embodiments of the Invention<br>
Embodiment(s) of the invention will now be described more fully with reference<br>
to the accompanying Drawings. Various embodiments are described below with respect<br>
to a GSM/GPRS/EDGE implementation. The invention may, however, be embodied in<br>
many different forms, including any implementation in which a plurality of time bases<br>
are used, such as, for example, wideband code division multiple access (WCDMA),<br>
CDMA-2000, personal digital cellular (PDC), time division multiple access (TDMA), or<br>
IS-95. The invention should not be construed as limited to the embodiment(s) set forth<br>
herein. The invention should only be considered limited by the claims as they now exist<br>
and the equivalents thereof.<br>
Typical systems may be grouped into two different types: 1) hardware-based<br>
systems; and 2) digital-signal-processor (DSP) based systems. In hardware-based<br>
systems, necessary functionality is usually split into suitable blocks and implemented as<br>
hardware and control of the hardware blocks is performed by a microprocessor.<br>
In DSP-based systems, a DSP and suitable hardware accelerators are typically<br>
employed. A rationale for the DSP-based systems is a need for a DSP in an architecture<br>
of the system that is dedicated to speech processing. If GSM/EDGE modem processing<br>
is also implemented on the DSP that performs the speech processing, some resource<br>
sharing may be achieved.<br>
Hardware-based systems typically excel at current consumption, since a<br>
processing function may usually be implemented more efficiently from a currentconsumption<br>
perspective in hardware as compared to software. However, hardwarebased<br>
systems tend to be inflexible and not make full use of available system resources<br>
(e.g., an audio DSP). The inflexibility is especially serious when costs and development<br>
schedules for digital application specific integrated circuits (ASICs) in modem silicon<br>
processes are taken into account.<br>
DSP-based systems typically make better use of available system resources (e.g.,<br>
an existing DSP is available) and are more flexible than hardware-based systems. From<br>
a cost perspective, most of dedicated hardware can be removed compared to a hardwarebased<br>
system. The resultant cost improvement is, however, often offset by memory<br>
consumption of necessary additional DSP software relative to the hardware-based<br>
systems and, in some cases, also by still-necessary hardware accelerators. In the end,<br>
DSP-based systems are typically more costly than hardware-based systems; all other<br>
things being equal.<br>
DSP-based systems typically consume more current, both in idle mode and<br>
dedicated mode, than comparable hardware-based systems. Moreover, software of the<br>
DSP-based systems is typically more complex than that of hardware-based systems,<br>
since tasks with different time bases must co-exist on the same DSP.<br>
Various embodiments of the invention relate to DSP-based implementations of<br>
GSM/EDGE signal processing in which two DSP; are used instead of one and in which a<br>
functionality split is made such that slot-based tasks are performed on a first DSP and<br>
frame-based tasks are performed on a second DSP. In GSM/EDGE, data output of a<br>
speech coder is encrypted, coded, and interleaved. The data is sent as bursts in time<br>
slots of 577(as. There are 8 or 16 of these time Slots per tune-division multiple access<br>
(TDMA) frame. Slot-based tasks are typically considered higher priority than framebased<br>
tasks. Therefore, if a DSP performing a frame-based task and a slot-based task<br>
needs to be performed, the frame-based task is interrupted and a context is saved.<br>
Saving the context requires memory. In addition, a more-complex software structure is<br>
necessary in order to effect necessary interrupt processes , which generally requires<br>
more memory.<br>
A decrease in system cost may be achieved by adding a DSP due to the fact that<br>
the cost of most, if not all, realistic DSP systems is dominated by memory costs. Thus,<br>
minimizing on-chip memory often serves to reduce system costs.<br>
FIGURE 1 illustrates a dual-core (e.g., dual-DSP) system. A system 100<br>
includes a slot DSP 102. The slot DSP 102 handles GSM/EDGE slot-based task<br>
processing (e.g., equalization). The system 100 also includes a frame DSP 104. The<br>
frame DSP 104 handles GSM/EDGE frame-based task processing (.e.g., speech<br>
processing, channel encoding/decoding, interleaving/de-interleaving).<br>
In GSM/EDGE, slot-based tasks are generally tasks that are run with a same time<br>
base as physical packets sent or received on a physical radio channel. Frame-based<br>
tasks are run on an integer number of slots. In GSM/EDGE, a typical slot-based task is<br>
equalization that is done on the physical packets sent on the physical radio channel. A<br>
typical frame-based task in GSM/EDGE is channel decoding that is done by assembling<br>
four radio bursts (sent in four slots) and then performing channel decoding.<br>
The slot DSP 102 and the frame DSP 104 each have a slave interface and a<br>
master interface, random access memory (RAM), read-only memory (ROM), and a DSP<br>
core. The system 100 also includes a co-processor system 106. The co-processor<br>
system 106 includes hardware accelerators for signal-processing functions (if necessary)<br>
and blocks for system control.<br>
The system 100 also includes a microcontroller 108. The microcontroller 108<br>
runs the GSM/EDGE stack and controls the slot DSP 102 and the frame DSP 104. The<br>
system 100 also includes a direct memory access (DMA) 110 for efficient data transfers.<br>
The DMA 110 is a standalone hardware device that moves data between different<br>
memories without processor (e.g., DSP or CPU) intervention. The system 100 also<br>
includes a bus 112 for the microcontroller 108, a bus 114 for the DMA 110, and a bus<br>
116 shared by the slot DSP 102 and the frame DSP 104. Although the slot DSP 102 and<br>
the frame DSP 104 are shown as sharing the bus 116, it will be understood by those<br>
having skill in the art that each of the slot DSP 102 and the frame DSP 104 need not<br>
necessarily share the bus 116 and may instead each have a dedicated bus. Moreover,<br>
more than two DSP may be included in the system 100 as dictated by design objectives<br>
without departing from principles of the invention.<br>
The system 100 also includes an external memory interface (EMIF) 118 that<br>
handles external-memory accesses by the system 100. In another option, instead of<br>
external memory 120 as shown in FIGURE 1, compact low-cost on-chip memory, such<br>
as embedded dynamic random-access memory (DRAM), could be used, as embedded<br>
DRAM is usually less expensive than on-chip static random-access memory (SRAM).<br>
The DSP functional split between the slot DSP 102 and the frame DSP 104<br>
permits all tasks on the slot DSP 102 to be run at a first rate and all tasks run on the<br>
frame DSP 104 to be run at a second rate. An execution pattern for each of the slot DSP<br>
102 and the frame DSP 104 becomes predictable and one in which no tasks interrupt<br>
each other. Consequently, it is not necessary to have operating-system support to handle<br>
task scheduling.<br>
The fact that tasks cannot interrupt each other means that application data<br>
memory consumption may be determined by the largest individual task. In contrast, in a<br>
system with operating-system (OS) scheduling, the application data memory<br>
consumption is generally determined by the sum of the consumption of all tasks.<br>
Moreover, software execution is predictable; therefore, each of the slot DSP 102 and the<br>
frame DSP 104 is aware of what task it will rim after the present task. As a result,<br>
software of the system 100 may be stored in a cheap bulk memory, either on-chip or offchip.<br>
For example, the external memory 120 could be located on the same chip as the<br>
slot DSP 102 and/or the frame DSP 104 or could be located externally to a chip taht<br>
includes the slot DSP 102 and/or the frame DSP 104.<br>
During execution of the present task, the DSP (e.g., the slot DSP 102) may<br>
download software for the next task to be performed by the DSP into execution<br>
memory, which process is sometimes referred to as an on-demand software download.<br>
One way of performing an on-demand software download is via the DMA 110. In<br>
addition, the slot DSP 102 and the frame DSP 104 are relatively simpler to verify, since<br>
the number of combinations of tasks decreases relative to a system in which a single<br>
DSP must perform tasks at more than one rate.<br>
Memory consumption of the system 100 is decreased relative to a comparable<br>
single-DSP-based system. Data memory is reduced due to the fact that no tasks<br>
interrupt each other and program memory is reduced due to the ability to perform an ondemand<br>
software download. The memory reductions are typically much larger than<br>
additional costs incurred for the extra DSP (e.g., the frame DSP 104). Further,<br>
additional computational performance added by the extra DSP enables removal of<br>
hardware accelerators that would otherwise be necessary for a single-DSP system.<br>
A dual-core system such as the system 100 is flexible due to the<br>
programmability of the slot DSP 102 and the frame DSP 104. Moreover, software of<br>
the system 100 may be primarily stored in cheap bulk memory and downloaded to<br>
execution memory just before execution, which serves to increase flexibility of the<br>
system 100 due to the fact that, in a typical prior DSP-based systems, the bulk of the<br>
system software is stored in ROM for cost reasons.<br>
A more programmable solution typically results in an increased current<br>
consumption. However, for modern digital silicon processes, the current consumption in<br>
idle mode is dominated by leakage. The best way to combat leakage is usually to<br>
decrease the memories; therefore, a dual-DSP system such as the system 100 may use<br>
less than current than a comparable single-DSP system.<br>
FIGURE 2 illustrates a multi-core (e.g., multiple-DSP) system. A system 200<br>
includes a slot-DSP cluster 202 and a frame-DSP cluster 204. The slot-DSP cluster 202<br>
includes at least one of the slot DSP 102 and at least one of the frame DSP 104, a<br>
plurality of slot DSPs 102(l)-(n) and a plurality of frame DSPs 104(l)-(m) being<br>
illustrated in FIGURE 2. Those having skill in the art will appreciate that n and m may<br>
each be a non-negative integer chosen in accordance with design considerations.<br>
Although each of the slot DSPs 102(l)-(n) and the frame DSPs 104(l)-(m) is indicated<br>
identically in the systems 100 and 200, those having skill in the art will appreciate that<br>
DSPs with varying characteristics can be utilized without departing from principles of<br>
the invention and that the DSPs so utilized need not all be identical to one another,<br>
either within one or both of the slot-DSP cluster 202, the frame-DSP cluster 204, or the<br>
system 100 or the system 200 as a whole.<br>
As indicated above with respect to the system 100., the slot DSPs 102(l)-(n)<br>
serve to handle slot-based task processing, while the frame DSPs 104(l)-(m) handle<br>
frame-based task processing. In addition, in similar fashion to the system 100, the slot<br>
DSPs 102(l)-(n) and the frame DSPs 104(l)-(m) each have a slave interface and a<br>
master interface, RAM, ROM, and a DSP core. The system 200 also includes the coprocessor<br>
system 106 and the microcontroller 108. The system 200 also includes the<br>
DMA 110, the bus 112, the bus 114, and the bus 116. Moreover, although the slot DSPs<br>
102(l)-(n) and the frame DSPs 104(l)-(m) are shown as sharing the bus 116, it will be<br>
understood by those having skill in the art that each of the slot DSPs 102(l)-(n) and the<br>
frame DSPs 104(l)-(m) need not necessarily share a bus and may instead each have a<br>
dedicated bus. Furthermore, in similar fashion to the system 100, the system 200<br>
includes the EMIF 118 as well as the external memory 120.<br>
Those having skill in the art will appreciate that the system 200 operates in many<br>
respects in a similar fashion to that of the system 100. Thus, the discussion hereinabove<br>
relative to the system 100 and its operation is applicable to the system 200. Of course,<br>
in various embodiments of the invention, when one or both of the slot-DSP cluster 202<br>
and the frame-DSP cluster 204 is employed, additional design considerations imposed<br>
by virtue of inclusion of a plurality of DSPs within a given cluster, such as, for example,<br>
an appropriate process for sharing the DSP bus 116, must be considered.<br>
It should be emphasized that the terms "comprise", "comprises", and<br>
"comprising", when used herein, are taken to specify the presence of stated features,<br>
integers, steps, or components, but do not preclude the presence or addition of one or<br>
more other features, integers, steps, components or groups thereof.<br>
