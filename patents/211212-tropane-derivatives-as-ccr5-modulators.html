				<td>Troane derivatives<br>
This invention relates to tropane derivatives useful in the treatment of a variety of disorders, including those in which the modulation of CCR5 receptors is implicated. More particularly, the present invention relates to 3-(3-isopropyl-5-methyl-4H-1 ,2,4-triazol-4-yl)-exo-8-azabicyclo[3.2, 1 ]octane derivatives and to processes for the preparation of. intermediates used in the preparation of, compositions containing and the uses of, such derivatives. Disorders that may be treated or prevented by the present derivatives include HIV and genetically related retroviral infections (and the resulting acquired immune deficiency syndrome, AIDS), and inflammatory diseases.<br>
The compounds of the present invention are modulators, especially antagonists, of the activity of chemokine CCR5 receptors. Modulators of the CCR5 receptor may be useful in the treatment of various inflammatory diseases and conditions, and in the treatment of infection by HIV-1 and genetically related retroviruses. The name "chemokine", is a contraction of "chemotactic cytokines". The chemokines comprise a large family of proteins which have in common important structural features and which have the ability to attract leukocytes. As leukocyte chemotactic factors, chemokines play an indispensable role in the attraction of leukocytes to various tissues of the body, a process which is essential for both inflammation and the body's response to infection. Because chemokines and their receptors are central to the pathophyslology of Inflammatory and infectious diseases, agents which are active in modulating, preferably antagonizing, the activity of chemokines and their receptors, are useful in the therapeutic treatment of such inflammatory and infectious diseases.<br>
The chemokine receptor CCR5 is of particular importance in the context of treating inflammatory and infectious diseases. CCR5 is a receptor for chemokines, especially for the macrophage inflammatory proteins (MIP) designated MIP-1α and MIP-1β, and for a protein which is regulated upon activation and is normal T-cell expressed and secreted (RANTES).<br>
There has been a substantial investigation of different classes of modulators of chemokine receptor activity, especially that of the CCR5 chemokine receptor, for example, WO 98/25617 relates to substituted aryl piperazines as modulators of chemokine receptor activity.<br>
The present compounds are generally disclosed by WO 00/38680 but none is specifically exemplified therein.<br>

The compounds of the formula (I) may be prepared by the following general methods in which R1 and R2 are as previously defined for a compound of the formula (I) unless otherwise stated.<br>
1.       A compound of the formula (I) may be prepared by reacting a        compound of formula: (Formula Removed)<br><br>
with a compound of formula:<br>
R1CO2H	(III)<br>
under conventional coupling conditions.<br>
The reaction is preferably carried out in the presence of a suitable coupling agent (for example, N-benzyl-N'-cyclohexylcarbodiimide (which may be polymer-bound), or hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide methiodide), at about room temperature, in a solvent that does not adversely affect the reaction, for example, dichloromethane. Further suitable coupling conditions are described in Method 2 below.<br>
The compounds of formula (III) are either known or are prepared using conventional techniques.<br>
The compounds of the formula (II) may be prepared as shown in Scheme 1 below.<br>
2.       The compounds of the formula (I) may be prepared as shown in Scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
(Scheme 1 Removed)<br>
wherein P is a suitable protecting group such as t-butyloxycarbonyl, benzyl or benzyloxycarbonyl and the compounds of the formula (II) and (VII) are in the exo form. In a typical procedure, where P is t-butyloxycarbonyl, an amine of the formula (IV) is reacted with di-tert-butyl dicarbonate in the presence of a base acceptor such as aqueous sodium hydroxide and in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The protected amine of the formula (V) may be reduced to an aldehyde of the formula (VI) using a suitable reducing agent, e.g., using diisobutylaluminium hydride in dichloromethane at below -70°C.<br>
Reductive amination reaction of the aldehyde of the formula (VI) with an amine of the formula (in the exo form): (Formula Removed)<br>
leads to a compound of the formula (VII), The reaction may be carried out in the presence of an excess of a suitable reducing agent, e.g. sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride, in a protic solvent system e.g., acetic acid in either dichloromethane or 1,1,1-trichloroethane, at room temperature.<br>
Deprotection of a compound of the formula (VII) may be accomplished using conventional conditions. Where P is t-butyloxycarbonyl this may be achieved using trifluoroacetic acid or aqueous hydrochloric acid in a solvent such as dichloromethane or methanol at room temperature.<br>
A compound of the formula (II) prepared may be converted to a compound of the formula (I) by reaction with a compound of the formula:<br>
R1COZ (VIB)<br>
wherein Z is a carboxylic acid activating group such as chloro or 1H-imidazol-1-yl, using conventional conditions, e.g. using N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole, triethylamine and dichloromethane.<br>
Preferably, a compound of the formula (VIB) is generated in situ from a compound of the formula (III) using a carbodiimide such as 3-(3-dimethylamino-1-propyl)-1-ethylcarbodiimide or N-benzyl-N'-cyclohexylcarbodiimide-polymer bound, optionally in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate, and reacted with a compound of the formula (II). The reaction may be performed in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, tetrahydrofuran or ethyl acetate, optionally in the presence of a base such as a tertiary amine, e.g. triethylamine or N-ethyldiisopropylamine, at about room temperature.<br>
Alternatively, the acid of the formula (III) may be first activated with benzotriazol-1-yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP), bromo-tris-pyrrolidinophosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PYBrOP), or 2-fluoro-1-methylpyridinium p-toluenesulphonate (Mukaiyama's reagent) in the presence of an excess of N-methylmorpholine, triethylamine or N-ethyldiisopropylamine in a suitable solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, dichloromethane or ethyl acetate, at room temperature to provide a compound of the formula (VIB) and this is reacted with a compound of the formula (II).<br>
Alternatively, an acid chloride of formula (VIB) wherein Z is chloro may be reacted with a compound of the formula (II), optionally in the presence of a suitable base, e.g. triethylamine, N-ethyldiisopropylamine, sodium carbonate, potassium carbonate or sodium bicarbonate, and in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, THF or toluene, at room temperature.<br>
It will be appreciated that the transformation of a compound of the formula (VII) to a compound of the formula (I) via a compound of the formula (II) can be performed in a "one-pot procedure" by deprotection/coupling using similar methods to those previously described.<br>
A compound of the formula (VIA) may be prepared as shown in Scheme 2.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
(Scheme 2 Removed)<br>
wherein P1 is a suitable protecting group such as t-butyloxycarbonyl or benzyl and the compounds of the formulae (X), (XI) and (XII) are in the exo form.<br><br>
An oxime of the formula (IX) may be prepared by the condensation of a ketone of the formula (VIII) with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in the presence of a base, e.g. pyridine, and in a suitable solvent, typically ethanol. The reaction is typically carried out at the reflux temperature of the solvent.<br>
Where P1 is t-butyloxycarbonyl or benzyl, reduction of an oxime of the formula (IX) may be achieved using sodium in the presence of an alcohol, typically pentanol, or by electrochemical reduction, to provide an amine of the formula (X).<br>
An amide of the formula (XI) may be prepared by coupling the protected amine of the formula (X) with 2-methylpropanoic acid, or an activated derivative thereof. The coupling may be achieved using conventional amide bond forming techniques, such as as described in Methods 1 and 2 above. Typically, the acid may be first activated using a carbodiimide such as 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethyl-carbodiimidef optionally in the presence of 1-hydroxybenzotriazole, in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, and in the presence of a base, e.g. a tertiary amine such as triethylamine or diisopropylamine, and then reacted with the amine of the formula (X). Alternatively, the reaction may be performed using 2-methylpropanoyl chloride in the presence of a base such as sodium carbonate and a suitable solvent, e.g. dichloromethane.<br>
A triazole of the formula (XII) may be prepared in a "one-pot", two-step procedure by first coupling an amide of the formula (XI) with acetic hydrazide followed by in-situ cyclo-condensation. Typically, the amide is first activated with phosphorous oxychloride in a solvent such as chloroform and in the presence of a base, e.g. pyridine, at 0°C, then treated with acetic hydrazide in a suitable solvent, e.g. chloroform, and the reaction heated under reflux. The reaction may be driven to completion in the presence of an acid, e.g. p-toluenesulphonic acid, and in a suitable solvent such as toluene at elevated temperature (e.g., 110°C).<br>
Deprotection of the compound of the formula (XII) using standard methodology provides the amine of the formula (VIA). Typically, where P1 is<br>
benzyl, deprotection is performed by catalytic hydrogenation such as using palladium (II) hydroxide as the catalyst in a suitable solvent, e.g. ethanol, in the presence of ammonium formate at 70°C. Alternatively, the deprotection may be performed by catalytic hydrogenation using palladium-on-charcoal as the catalyst in a suitable solvent such as methanol, optionally in the presence of a suitable acid such as p-toluenesulphonic acid.<br>

An amide of the formula (XIV) may be formed by conventional amide bond formation techniques such as by first activating an acid of the formula (XIII) (wherein R3 is H) either as an acid chloride or using other procedures as described above in Methods 1 and 2, followed by reaction with the amine of the formula (VIA). Alternatively an ester of the formula (XIII) (wherein R3 is C1-C6 alkyl) may reacted directly with the amine or a metal salt thereof. Thus the acid chloride and the amine, or a salt thereof, may be reacted in the presence<br>
of an excess of a suitable base, e.g. Na2CO3, NaHCO3, K2CO3, triethylamine or N.N-diisopropylethylamine, and in a suitable solvent, e.g. dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, THF or toluene, with or without water as a co-solvent. Alternatively the acid may be activated with 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (WCDI), CDI (1,1-carbonyldiimidazole) or DCC (1,3-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide) and HOAT (1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole) or HOBT (1-hydroxybenzotriazole hydrate), and reacted with the amine in the presence of a base, e.g. triethylamine, in a solvent such as THF, dichloromethane or toluene. Also, the ester and the amine or a metal salt thereof, may reacted together in the presence of a base, e.g. triethylamine, and an optional catalyst in a solvent such as dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, THF or toluene, with or without water as co-solvent. Alternatively, the ester, the amine and an enzyme-catalyst may be reacted together in a solvent such as dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, THF or toluene, with or without water as co-solvent. Preferably, the acid chloride, the amine and Na2CO3 are reacted together in dichloromethane and water, or the acid is treated with N,N'-carbonyldiimidazole to form the imidazolide and then reacted with the amine in dichloromethane in the presence of triethylamine. The amide of the formula (XIV) may be reduced, such as by using a nucleophilic hydride reagent or an electrophilic hydride reagent, or by catalytic hydrogenation, or by using an alkyl or aryl-silane with a suitable transition metal catalyst, to provide a compound of the formula (I).

Alternatively, reduction of an ester, nitrile or acid (activated by a suitable reagent) of the formula (XV) may be achieved with a suitable transition metal catalyst, a hydrogen source and in a suitable solvent. Typical conditions include reducing the ester, nitrile or amide with an aluminium or boron hydride such as DIBAL (diisobutylaluminium hydride), Red-AI®, LiAI(O(t-Bu))3 or (Me2CHCH(Me))2BH in a solvent such as THF, dichloromethane or toluene; or reducing the acid chloride with a transition metal catalyst such as Pd/C or Pd/BaSO4, under hydrogen with a modifier such as 2,4-dimethylpyridine and in solvent such as THF or toluene. Preferred conditions include reducing the ester with DIBAL in dichloromethane or toluene.<br>
A compound of the formula (I) may be prepared by reductive amination using the aldehyde of the formula (XVI) and the amine of the formula (VIA), or salt thereof. Typically the reaction may be performed by reacting the aldehyde with 0.8-1.5 mol eq. of the amine, or salt thereof, optionally in the presence of 0.1-3 mol eq. of a protic acid, with either a reducing agent such as sodium triacetoxyborohydride or sodium cyanoborohydride, or using a catalytic transition metal catalyst such as palladium, platinum or rhodium and a hydrogen source such as molecular hydrogen or ammonium formate, in a suitable solvent such as dichloromethane, acetonitrile, toluene, ethanol or 2-propanol. Preferably the aldehyde is reacted with the tosylate salt of the<br>
amine in the presence of sodium triacetoxyborohydride and a trace of acetic acid in dichloromethane at ambient temperature.<br>

 5.       The compounds of the formula (I) may be prepared by reductive<br>
arnination of a compound of the formula (XV) wherein Y is -CN and an amine of the formula (VIA), or salt thereof. The reduction may be performed using a transition metal catalyst, optionally in the presence of an acid, and a hydrogen source, in a suitable solvent. In a typical<br>
procedure palladium-on-charcoal or platinum (IV) oxide and a solvent such as methanol, acetic acid or 2-propanol are used.<br>

A compound of the formula (I) may be prepared by asymmetric reduction of an enamide of the formula (XIX) such as by using 0.001-0.1 mol eq. of transition metal such as Rh, Ru, Pd, Pt, Ir, or Ti, 0.001-0.2 mol eq. of a chiral ligand such as BINAP (2,2-bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl), tol-BINAP (2,2-bis(di-p-tolylphosphino)-1,1'-binaphthyl), Du-PHOS (1,2-bis(2,5-dimethylphospholano)benzene) or Penn-Phos (P,P'-.1,2-phenylenebis(endo-<br>
2,5-dimethyl-7-phosphabicyclo[2,2,1]heptane), a hydrogen donor such as molecular hydrogen, phenylsilane, 2-propanol or ammonium formate, and a suitable solvent such as methanol, ethanol, acetonitrile, toluene, ethyl acetate, 2-propanol or THF, at from 0°C to the reflux temperature and optionally at an elevated pressure.<br>

A ketone of the formula (XVIII) may be converted to a racemic amine of the formula (IIA) by reductive amination under conventional conditions using ammonia, or equivalent thereof, and a reducing agent in a suitable solvent.<br>
The racemic amine of the formula (IIA) may be resolved to provide an amine of the formula (II) by standard techniques such as by using classical, kinetic or dynamic resolution techniques.<br>
The amine of the formula (II) may be converted to a compound of the formula (I) by the routes described in Methods 1 and 2.<br>
Alternatively, a racemic amine of the formula (IIA) may be converted to a compound of the formula (I) using a compound of the formula (III), or a<br>
suitable activated derivative thereof, a chiral catalyst, optionally using a catalyst for racemization of the unwanted isomer present, and a suitable<br>
solvent.<br>
The amine of the formula (II), or a metal salt thereof (i.e. a<br>
deprotonated form), may also be converted to a compound of the formula (I)<br>
by reaction with an ester of the formula:<br>
R1CO2R5 (XXIV)<br>
wherein R5 is an ester-forming group such as C1-C6 alkyl. Typically the reaction may be carried out by reacting the ester and the amine, or metal salt thereof, with an excess of a base such as triethylamine and an optional catalyst in a solvent such as dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, THF or toluene, with or without water present as a co-solvent: or by reacting the ester and the amine in the presence of an enzyme-catalyst in a solvent such as dichloromethane, ethyl acetate, THF or toluene, with or without water present as a co-solvent.<br>
All of the above reactions and the preparations of novel starting materials using in the preceding methods are conventional and appropriate reagents and reaction conditions for their performance or preparation as well as procedures for isolating the desired products will be well-known to those skilled in the art with reference to literature precedents and the Examples and Preparations hereto.<br>
A pharmaceutically acceptable salt of a compound of the formula (I) may be readily prepared by mixing together solutions of a compound of the formula (I) and the desired acid. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are useful because they have pharmacological activity in animals, including humans. More particularly, they are useful in the treatment of a disorder in which the modulation of CCR5 receptors is implicated. Disease states that may be mentioned include HIV, a retroviral infection genetically related to HIV, AIDS, or an inflammatory disease. The compounds of formula (I), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, may be administered alone or as part of a combination therapy.<br>
The compounds of this invention may be used for treatment of respiratory disorders, including adult respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), bronchitis, chronic bronchitis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, cystic flbrosis, asthma, emphysema, rhinitis and chronic sinusitis. Other conditions that may be treated are those triggered, affected or are in any other way correlated with T-cell trafficking in different organs. It is expected that the<br>
compounds of this invention may be useful for the treatment of such conditions and in particular, but not limited to the following for which a correlation with CCR5 or CCR5 chemokines has been established: inflammatory bowel disease, including Crohn's disease and ulcerative colitis, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, graft rejection, in particular but not limited to kidney and lung allografts, endometriosis, type I diabetes, renal diseases, chronic pancreatitis, inflammatory lung conditions or chronic heart failure. For a recent review of possible applications of chemokines and chemokine receptor blockers see Cascieri, MA, and Springer, M.S., The chemokine/chemokine receptor family: potential and progress for therapeutic intervention", Curr. Opin. Chem. Biol., 4(4), 420-7 (August 2000).<br>
The utility of the compounds of formula (I), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, as inhibitors of HIV infection may be demonstrated by any one or more methodologies known in the art, such as by using the HIV microculture assays described in Dimitrov et al., J. Clin. Microbiol., 28, 734-737 (1990), and the pseudotyped HIV reporter assay described in Connor et a/., Virology, 206 (2) 935-44 (1995).<br><br>
The ability of the compounds of formula (I), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, to modulate chemokine receptor activity is demonstrated by methodology known in the art, such as by using the assay for CCR5 binding following procedures disclosed in Combadiere et al., J. Leukoc. Biol., 60,147-52 (1996); and/or by using the intracellular calcium mobilisation assays as described by the same authors. Cell lines expressing the receptor of interest include those naturally expressing the receptor, such as PM-1, or IL-2 stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL), or a cell engineered to express a recombinant receptor, such as CHO, 300.19, L1.2 or HEK-293.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can be administered alone but will generally be administered in admixture with a suitable pharmaceutical excipient, diluent or carrier selected with regard to the intended route of administration and standard pharmaceutical practice.<br>
For example, the compounds of the formula (I) can be administered orally, buccally or sublingually in the form of tablets, capsules, multi-particulates, gels, films, ovules, elixirs, solutions or suspensions, which may contain flavouring or colouring agents, for immediate-, delayed-, modified-, sustained-, pulsed- or controlled-release applications. The compounds of the formula (I) may also be administered as fast-dispersing or fast-dissolving dosage forms or in the form of a high energy dispersion or as coated particles. Suitable formulations of the compounds of the formula (I) may be in coated or uncoated form, as desired.<br>
Such solid pharmaceutical compositions, for example, tablets, may contain excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sodium citrate,<br>
calcium carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate, glycine and starch (preferably com, potato or tapioca starch), disintegrants such as sodium starch glycollate, croscarmellose sodium and certain complex silicates, and granulation binders such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and talc may be included.<br><br>
General Example<br>
A formulation of the tablet could typically contain from 0.01 mg to 50mg of active compound whilst tablet fill weights may range from 50mg to 1000mg. An example of a formulation for a 10mg tablet is illustrated below:<br>
Ingredient	%wAv<br>
Compound of the formula (I) or salt	10.000*<br>
Lactose	64.125<br>
Starch	21.375<br>
Croscarmellose sodium	3.000<br>
Magnesium stearate	.   1.500<br>
* Quantity adjusted in accordance with drug activity.<br>
The tablets are manufactured by a standard process, for example, direct compression or a wet or dry granulation process. The tablet cores may be coated with appropriate overcoats.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin or HPMC capsules. Preferred excipients in this regard include lactose, starch, a cellulose, milk sugar or high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. For aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs, the compounds of the formula (I) may be combined with various sweetening or flavouring agents, colouring matter or dyes, with emulsifying and/or suspending agents and with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol and glycerin, and combinations thereof.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) can also be administered parenterally, for example, intravenously, intra-arterially, intraperitoneally, intrathecally, intraventricularly, intraurethrally, intrasternally, intracranially,<br><br>
intramuscularly or subcutaneously, or they may be administered by infusion or needleless injection techniques. For such parenteral administration they are best used in the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), if necessary. The preparation of suitable parenteral formulations under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well-known to those skilled in the art. For oral or parenteral administration to human patients the daily dosage levels of compounds of formula (I), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, will be from 0.01 to 30 mg/kg (in single or divided doses) and preferably will be in the range 0.01 to 15 mg/kg. Thus tablets will contain 1mg to 0.5g of compound for administration singly or two or more at a time, as appropriate. The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for any individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight and response of the particular patient. The above dosages are exemplary of the average case. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited and such are within the scope of this invention.<br>
Oral administration is preferred. Preferably, administration takes place shortly before an effect is required.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also be administered intranasally or by inhalation and are conveniently delivered in the form of a dry powder inhaler or an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable propellant, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, a hydrofluoroalkane such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134A [trade mark]) or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA 227EA [trade mark]), carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurised aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The<br>
pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser or nebuliser may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound, e.g. using a mixture of ethanol and the propellant as the solvent, which may additionally contain a lubricant, e.g. sorbitan trioleate. Capsules and cartridges (made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of a compound of the formula (I) and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
Aerosol or dry powder formulations are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or "puff" contains from 1µg to 10mg of a compound of the formula (I) for delivery to the patient The overall daily dose with an aerosol will be in the range of from 1µg to 20mg which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, in divided doses throughout the day.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the formula (I) can be administered in the form of a suppository or pessary, or they may be applied topically in the form of a gel, hydrogel, lotion, solution, cream, ointment or dusting powder. The compounds of the formula (I) may also be dermally or transdermally administered, for example, by the use of a skin patch. They may also be administered by the pulmonary or rectal routes.<br>
They may also be administered by the ocular route, particularly for treating inflammatory conditions or diseases of the eye. For ophthalmic use, the compounds can be formulated as micronised suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, optionally in combination with a preservative such as a benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, they may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
For application topically to the skin, the compounds of the formula (I) can be formulated as a suitable ointment containing the active compound suspended or dissolved in, for example, a mixture with one or more of the following: mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water. Alternatively, they can be formulated as a suitable lotion or cream, suspended<br>
or dissolved in, for example, a mixture of one or more of the following: mineral oil, sorbitan monostearate, a polyethylene glycol, liquid paraffin, polysorbate 60, cetyl esters wax, cetearyl alcohol, 2-octyldodecanol, benzyl alcohol and water.<br>
The compounds of the formula (I) may also be used in combination with a cyclodextrin. Cyclodextrins are known to form inclusion and non-inclusion complexes with drug molecules. Formation of a drug-cyclodextrin complex may modify the solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailabiiity and/or stability property of a drug molecule. Drug-cyclodextrin complexes are generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, e.g. as a carrier, diluent or solubiliser. Alpha-, beta-and gamma-cydodextrins are most commonly used and suitable examples are described.in WO-A-91/11172, WO-A-94/02518 and WO-A-98/55148.<br>
The compounds of formula (I), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, have the advantage that they are more selective, have a more rapid onset of action, are more potent, are more stable, are more resistant to metabolism, or have other more desirable properties than the compounds of the prior art.<br>
Included within the scope of the present invention are embodiments comprising coadministration of, and compositions which contain, in addition to a compound of the. present invention as active ingredient, additional therapeutic agents and active ingredients. Such multiple drug regimens, often referred to as combination therapy, may be used in the treatment and prevention of any of the diseases or conditions mediated by or associated with CCR5 chemokine receptor modulation, particularly infection by human immunodeficiency virus, HIV. The use of such combinations of therapeutic agents is especially pertinent with respect to the treatment and prevention of infection and multiplication of the human immunodeficiency virus, HIV, and related pathogenic retroviruses within a patient in need of treatment or one at risk of becoming such a patient. The ability of such retroviral pathogens to<br>
evolve within a: relatively short period of time into strains resistant to any monotherapy which has been administered to said patient is well known in the literature.<br>
In addition to the requirement of therapeutic efficacy which may necessitate the use of active agents in addition to the CCR5 chemokine receptor modulating compounds of formula (I), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, there may be additional rationales which compel or highly recommend the use of combinations of drugs involving active ingredients which represent adjunct therapy, i.e., which complement and supplement the function performed by the CCR5 chemokine receptor modulating compounds of the present invention. Such supplementary therapeutic agents used for the purpose of auxiliary treatment include drugs which, instead of directly treating or preventing a disease or condition mediated by or associated with CCR5 chemokine receptor modulation, treat diseases or conditions which directly result from or indirectly accompany the basic or underlying CCR5 chemokine receptor modulated disease or condition. For example, where the basic CCR5 chemokine receptor modulated disease or condition is HIV infection and multiplication, it may be necessary or at least desirable to treat opportunistic infections, neoplasms, and other conditions which occur as the result of the immune-compromised state of the patient being treated. Other active agents may be used with the compounds of formula (I), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, e.g., in order to provide immune stimulation or to treat pain and inflammation which accompany the initial and fundamental HIV infection.<br>
Thus, the methods of treatment and pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention may employ the compounds of formula (I), and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, in the form of monotherapy, but said methods and compositions may also be used in the form of multiple therapy in which one or more compounds of formula (I), or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts, are coadministered in combination with one or more known therapeutic agents such as those described in detail further herein.<br>

There is also included within the scope of the preferred embodiments of the present invention, combinations of a compound of formula (I), or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, together with a supplementary therapeutic agent used for the purpose of auxiliary treatment, wherein said supplementary therapeutic agent comprises one or more members independently selected from the group consisting of proliferation inhibitors, e.g., hydroxyurea; immunomodulators, e.g., sargramostim, and various forms of interferon or interferon derivatives; fusion inhibitors, e.g., AMD3100, T-20, PRO-542, AD-349, BB-10010 and other chemokine receptor agonists/antagonists; tachykinin receptor modulators, e.g. NK1 antagonists; integrase inhibitors, e.g., AR177; RNaseH inhibitors; inhibitors of viral transcription and RNA replication; and other agents that inhibit viral infection or improve the condition or outcome of HIV-infected individuals through different mechanisms.<br>
Preferred methods of treatment of the present invention for the prevention of HIV infection, or treatment of aviremic and asymptomatic subjects potentially or effectively infected with HIV, include but are not limited<br>
to administration of a member independently selected from the group consisting of: (i) a compound within the scope of formula (I) as disclosed herein; (ii) one NNRTI in addition to a compound of (i); (iii) two NRTI in addition to a compound of (i); (iV) one NRTI in addition to the combination of (//); and (v) a compound selected from the class of protease inhibitors used in place of a NRTI in combinations (Hi) and (iV).<br>
The preferred methods of the present invention for therapy of HIV-infected individuals with detectable viremia or abnormally low CD4 counts further include as a member to be selected: (vi) treatment according to (i) above in addition to the standard recommended initial regimens for the therapy of established HIV infections, e.g., see http://hivatis.org/trtgdlns.html. Such standard regimens include but are not limited to an agent from the class of protease inhibitors in combination with two NRTIs; and (vii) a standard recommended initial regimens for the therapy of established HIV infections, e.g., see http://hivatis.org/trtgdlns.html, where either the protease inhibitor component, or one or both of the NRTIs is/are replaced by a compound within the scope of formula (I) as disclosed herein.<br>
The preferred methods of the present invention for therapy of HIV-infected individuals that have failed antiviral therapy further include as a member to be selected: (viii) treatment according to (i) above, in addition to the standard recommended regimens for the therapy of such patients, e.g., see http://hivatis.org/trtgdlns.html; and (ix) a standard recommended initial regimens for the therapy of patients who have failed antiretroviral therapy, e.g., see http://hivatis.org/trtgdlns.html, where either one of the protease inhibitor components, or one or both of the NRTIs is/are replaced by a compound within the scope of formula (I) as disclosed herein.<br>
In the above-described preferred embodiment combinations of the present invention, the compound of formula (I) and other therapeutic active agents may be administered in terms of dosage forms either separately or in conjunction with each other, and in terms of their time of administration, either serially or simultaneously. Thus, the administration of one component agent<br>
may be prior to, concurrent with, or subsequent to the administration of the other component agent(s).<br>

difluorocyclohexanecarboxamide, prepared by the methods of Examples 4 and 6, has been found to exist in 2 polymorphic forms termed Form A and Form B. The PXRD (Powder X-Ray Diffraction) pattern simulation involving d-spacing and relative intensities were calculated from single crystal structures using the Cerius2 Diffraction-Crystal Module. The simulation parameters were:<br>
Wavelength = 1.54178 A Polarisation Factor = 0.5 Crystallite Size = 500 x 500 x 500 A Lorentzian Peak Shape<br>
The main peaks (in degrees 2-theta) of the simulated PXRD patterns are listed in the following tables.<br>
It will be appreciated by the skilled person that whilst the relative intensities of the various peaks in the tables may vary due to a number of factors including orientation effects of the crystals in the X-ray beam, the purity of the sample being examined or the degree of crystallinity of the sample, the peak positions will'remain substantially as defined in the tables.<br>
The skilled person will also appreciate that measurements taken using a different X-ray beam wavelength will result in different shifts in peak position according to the Bragg equation. Such PXRD patterns generated using different wavelengths are considered to be alternative representations of the PXRD patterns of the crystalline materials of the present invention and are thus to be embraced by the scope thereof.<br>
