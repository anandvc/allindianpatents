				<td>1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates generally to a mass flow measurement and control<br>
and more particularly, to a mass flow measurement, a Coriolis mass flow sensor<br>
and controller based on the Coriolis force effect and having an integrated flow<br>
control valve with associated sense, control and communication electronics.<br>
This invention also relates to a device and a method for determining mass flow<br>
from a Coriolis force induced phase shift.<br>
The present invention has been divided out of Indian Patent Application<br>
No. IN/PCT/2001/00505.<br>
2.	DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Mass flow measurement based on the Coriolis force effect is achieved in<br>
the following manner. The Coriolis force results in the effect of a mass moving in<br>
an established direction and then being forced to change direction with a vector<br>
component normal to the establshed direction of flow. This can be expressed by<br>
the following equation :<br>
Fc = M x Ω<br>
Where Fc (the Coriolis force vector) is the result of the cross product of M (the<br>
mass flow vector) and ω (the angular velocity vector).<br>
In a rotating system, the angular velocity vector is aligned along the axis of<br>
rotation. Using the "Right Hand Rule", the fingers define the direction of rotation<br>
and the thumb, extended, defines the angular velocity vector direction. In the<br>
case of the typical Coriolis force flow sensor, a tube, through which fluid flow is to<br>
be established, is vibrated. Often the tube is in the shape of one or more loops.<br><br>
The loop shape is such that the mass flow vector is directed in opposite directions at<br>
different parts of the loop. The tube loops may, for example, be "U" shaped,<br>
rectangular, triangular or "delta" shaped or coiled. In the special case of a straight tube,<br>
there are two simultaneous angu ar velocity vectors that are coincident to the anchor<br>
points of the tube while the mass flow vector is in a single direction.<br>
The angular velocity vector changes directions since, in a vibrating system, the<br>
direction of rotation changes. The result is that, at any given time, the Coriolis force is<br>
acting in opposite directions where the mass flow vectors or the angular velocity vectors<br>
are directed in opposite directions. Since the angular velocity vector is constantly<br>
changing due to the vibrating system, the Coriolis force is also constantly changing.<br>
The result is a dynamic twisting motion being imposed on top of the oscillating motion<br>
of the tube. The magnitude of twist is proportional to the mass flow for a given angular<br>
velocity.<br>
DE 19,605,923, GB 2,221,302, WO 92/14123 and US Patent No. 4747312<br>
disclose examples of flowmeters. Ir Coriolis flowmeters, flow measurement is achieved<br>
by measuring the twist in the sensor tube due to the Coriolis force generated by a fluid<br>
moving through the sensor tube. Typical known devices use pick off sensors<br>
comprising magnet and coil pairs located on the flow tube where the Coriolis force's<br>
induced displacement is expected to be greatest. The coil and magnet are mounted on<br>
opposing structures, for example, the magnet is mounted on the tube and the coil is<br>
mounted on the stationary package wall. The magnet will move in and out of the coil,<br>
inducing a current in the coil. This current is proportional to the velocity of the magnet<br>
relative to the coil. Since this is a ve ocity measurement, the velocity,<br><br>
and thus the signal, is at the maximum when the flow tube crosses its rest point<br>
(zero crossing). The Coriolis force induced twist causes a phase shift in the<br>
velocity signal. The phase is detected by measuring the difference in the zero<br>
crossing times between the two velocity sensors. In practice this places a large<br>
accuracy burden on the time measurement circuitry. This may limit the ultimate<br>
sensitivity of mass flow measurement by this technique.<br>
Further, the flow rate capabilities of known devices based on Coriolis<br>
technology often are limited to flow rates that are higher than desired for many<br>
applications. Moreover, existing Coriolis mass flow measuring devices only<br>
provide for mass flow sensing with no integral flow control capabilities. It has<br>
been left to the user to provide any means for controlling flow.<br>
The present invention addresses shortcomings associated with the prior<br>
art.<br>

While the invention is susceptible to various modifications and alternative<br>

drawings and are herein described in detail. It should be understood, however,<br>
that the description herein of specific embodiments is not intended to limit the<br>
invention to the particular forms disclosed, but on the contrary, the intention is to<br>
cover all modifications, equivalents, and alternatives falling within the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention as hereinafter claimed.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Illustrative embodiments; of the invention are described below. In the<br>
interest of clarity, not all features of an actual implementation are described in<br>
this specification. It will of course be appreciated that in the development of any<br>
such actual embodiment, numerous implementation-specific decisions must be<br>
made to achieve the developers' specific goals, such as compliance with system-<br>
related and business-related constraints, which will vary from one<br>
implementation to another. Moreover, it will be appreciated that such a<br>
development effort might be complex and time-consuming, but would<br>
nevertheless be a routine undertaking for those of ordinary skill in the art having<br>
the benefit of this disclosure.<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram conceptually illustrating a Coriolis mass flow<br>
sensor in accordance with aspects of the present invention. The Coriolis mass<br>
flow sensor 1 includes a flow sensor tube 2, with a drive device 3 situated<br>
relative thereto so as to vibrate the tube 2. Displacement gauges 4 are<br><br>
positioned relative to the tube 2 so as to measure the twist in the tube 2 due to<br>
Coriolis force.<br>
A typical material for the sensor tube 2 is 316L stainless steel. Reasons<br>
for using 316L stainless steel include that it is resistant to chemical attack from<br>
many substances, it is resistan' to rupture from normal process pressures, it is<br>
typically noncontaminating and can be readily formed to the desired shape of a<br>
Coriolis sensor tube. However, 316L. stainless steel is not suitable for all<br>
applications. Therefore, it is necessary that other tube materials be available to<br>
cover applications not suitable for 316L stainless steel. Known devices use<br>
silicon as an alternative materia to 316L. stainless steel. The advantage of silicon<br>
over 316L stainless steel is that sensor tubes can be made in a smaller form<br>
than can be realized by 316L stainless steel.<br>
Another consideration far material selection for the sensor tube 2 is the<br>
resistance to stress induced or enhanced corrosion. Stress is generated at the<br>
base of the bending arm where the tubes are mounted. In polycrystalline<br>
materials stress will cause impurities in the material to diffuse and concentrate at<br>
grain boundaries between the microcrystalline granular regions. This will, in<br>
many cases, weaken the bonds between the microcrystalline grains making the<br>
material to be more susceptible! to chemical attack. Single crystal materials like<br>
silicon or sapphire are less likely to be affected in this manner.<br>
Metals, like 316L stainless steel are usually polycrystalline and therefore<br>
more susceptible to this type of chemical attack to varying degrees. Amorphous<br>
materials like silica glass and several plastics also are more resistant to stress<br><br>
induced chemical attack, since they do not have a grain structure like<br>
polycrystalline materials. Tube materials that are susceptible to chemical attack<br>
may have their surfaces modified or coated in such a way as to minimize<br>
corrosion or attack at the surfaces if the use of the underlying material is<br>
otherwise attractive.<br>
Surface modification may be accomplished by ion implantation, thermal<br>
diffusion, and chemical or electrochemical reaction. The intent; here, is to<br>
remove, redistribute, or introduce elemental or molecular species that leave a<br>
chemically resistant layer at the surface. Surface coating may be accomplished<br>
by thermally activated deposition from a vapor, liquid or powder impinging on the<br>
surface at elevated temperaures. Lower temperatures may be used if the<br>
chemically reactive species is also excited or ionized by plasma or an intense<br>
photon flux as from a laser. Other materials resistant to chemical attack may be<br>
deposited by nonreactive, physical vapor deposition as accomplished by thermal<br>
or electron beam evaporation or by ion sputtering. If sputtering is accomplished<br>
using a highly energetic ion beam so that the sputtered species is chemically<br>
excited or ionized, then a chemical reaction with the surface is also<br>
accomplished, which may be desirable for certain deposited materials. Also,<br>
chemical reactions at the surface may be accomplished by accelerating the<br>
chemical species so that the kinetic energy can be used to activate or enhance<br>
the chemical reaction.<br><br>
Tube materials used for the Coriolis flow sensing tube 2 in particular<br>
embodiments of the present irvention are Austenitic and Martensitic stainless<br>
steels, high nickel alloys, Titanium and Zirconium and their alloys, particularly<br>
Titanium-Vanadium-Aluminum alloys and Zircalloy (for their high yield strength<br>
and low Young's modulus), silcon, sapphire, silicon carbide, silica glass and<br>
plastics. Tube coating materials employed in accordance with the present<br>
invention include silicon carbide, nickel, chrome, diamond, refractory carbides,<br>
refractory metal nitrides, and refractory metal oxides.<br>
Figures 2A and 2B illustrate a Coriolis mass flow sensor 1 in accordance<br>
with particular embodiments of the present invention. The Coriolis mass flow<br>
sensor 1 employs an electromagnetic drive 10 that includes an electromagnet 12<br>
driven by a signal source (not shown), which, in the embodiment illustrated,<br>
comprises a sinusoidal signal source. The electromagnet 12 is situated near a<br>
small permanent magnet 14 mounted on a sensor tube 16. The sensor tube 16<br>
is connected to a base 18 that includes first and second ports 19, so as to define<br>
a flow path from one port 19 through the flow tube 16 to the other port 19. The<br>
exemplary sensor tube 16 shown in the embodiments disclosed herein is<br>
generally "U" shaped, though o:her shapes, such as delta shaped, rectangular,<br>
coiled, or straight tubes may also be used.<br>
Figures 3A and 3B illustrate an embodiment similar to that shown in<br>
Figure 2, using an electrostatc drive. The electrostatic drive 20 includes a<br>
charge plate 22 positioned near a small dielectric plate 24 mounted on the<br>
sensor tube 16. If the tube 13 is made of dielectric material, then the charge<br><br>
plate 22 is positioned near the tube 16 and the dielectric plate 24 may be<br>
eliminated. Again, the charge plate is driven by a signal source (not shown),<br>
such as a sinusoidal signal SOL rce. A voltage applied to the charge plate 22 will<br>
produce an electric field between it and the dielectric plate 24. This will produce<br>
a surface charge on the dielectric plate 24. As the voltage polarity is rapidly<br>
changed on the charge plate 22, the resultant electric field between it and the<br>
dielectric plate 24 will alternately be attractive or repulsive causing the flow tube<br>
16 to vibrate.<br>
Figures 4A and 4B illustrate another embodiment of the Coriolis mass flow<br>
sensor 1 that employs a novel acoustic drive 30. The acoustic drive 30 includes<br>
a small speaker 32 placed nea'the tube 16. The pressure waves generated by<br>
the speaker 32 cause the tube 16 to vibrate.<br>
In Figures 5A, 5B and 5C, yet another embodiment of the Coriolis mass<br>
flow sensor 1 is illustrated. The Coriolis mass flow sensor 1 of Figures 5A, 5B<br>
and 5C uses a piezoelectric drive 40, wherein two piezoelectric stacks 42 are<br>
positioned on opposite sides of each leg of the flow tube 16, in effect creating<br>
two bimorphs on each leg 16 as shown in Figure 5. The piezoelectric and<br>
reverse piezoelectric effects would be used to either drive and/or sense the<br>
deflection of the tube 16.<br>
Mass flow measurement s achieved by measuring the twist in the sensor<br>
tube 16 due to the Coriolis force generated by a fluid moving through the sensor<br>
tube 16. For example, pick cff sensors comprising magnet and coil pairs<br>
are typically located on the flew tube 16 where the Coriolis forces induced<br><br>
displacement is expected to be greatest. The coil and magnet are mounted on<br>
opposing structures, for example, the magnet is mounted on the tube 16 and the<br>
coil is mounted on the stationary package wall. The magnet will move in and out<br>
of the coil, inducing a current in the coil. This current is proportional to the<br>
velocity of the magnet relative to the coil. Since this is a velocity measurement,<br>
the velocity, and thus the signal, is at the maximum when the flow tube 16<br>
crosses its rest point (zero crossing). The Coriolis force induced twist causes a<br>
phase shift in the velocity signal that is detected by measuring the difference in<br>
the zero crossing times between the two velocity sensors. In practice this places<br>
a large accuracy burden on the time measurement circuitry. This may limit the<br>
ultimate sensitivity of mass flow measurement by this technique.<br>
Aspects of the present nvention provide a flow measurement technique<br>
that provides for a lower flow capability, is more direct and requires less accuracy<br>
in the circuitry than typical time' based signal conditioning techniques. Referring<br>
to the embodiments illustrated in Figures 2-4, displacement of the vibrating<br>
sensor tube is measured usirg capacitive pick off sensors. Two capacitance<br>
displacement gauges 50 are positioned near the tube 16 at positions symmetric<br>
to the shape of the tube 16 so as to measure the twist in the sensor tube 16 due<br>
to the Coriolis force generated by a fluid moving through the sensor tube 16. In<br>
specific embodiments of the present invention, the capacitance displacement<br>
gauges 50 are miniaturized and surface mounted on the sensor package wall or<br>
on a sensor block inserted inside the loop of the flow sensor tube. The twist in<br>
the sensor tube 16 due to the Coriolis force results in a phase shift between the<br><br>
two signals from the capacitance displacement gauges 50. Since this is a<br>
displacement measurement, the signal is directly proportional to the<br>
displacement. The relative displacement of each side of the tube is measured as<br>
a phase shift. The gauge driver and signal conditioning electronics translate the<br>
relative displacement of the tube 16 into a high level signal which is a function of<br>
the phase shift that can be used to measure the Coriolis effect when flow is<br>
established through the tube 16.<br>
A first signal processing technique uses a lock-in amplifier with a<br>
reference signal supplied by one of the displacement gauges 50, and an input<br>
signal supplied by the other displacement gauge 50. Either gauge 50 may supply<br>
the reference or the input signal. The phase output from the lock-in amplifier is<br>
proportional to flow. Figure 6 is a functional schematic of a lock-in amplifier 52,<br>
with which such a method for measuring the Coriolis force induced phase shift in<br>
accordance with the present nvention may be implemented. The signals are<br>
moving left to right as illustrated in Figure 6. The Left input 100 and Right input<br>
102 signals are from the Left and Right displacement gauges 50 respectively.<br>
For example, the Left input 100 may be used as the reference signal. The sine<br>
out 103 is the drive signal, phase locked to the Left input 100 signal. This will<br>
drive the flow sensor tube 16 at resonance. The Right Input 102 signal is mixed<br>
with the Left/Reference Input 100 signal and its 90° phased shifted signal 104 in<br>
the two Phase Sensitive Detectors (PSDs) 106. Functionally, the PSDs 106<br>
multiply the two signals, producing a high frequency component and a DC<br>
component. The low pass filters 108 remove the high frequency component<br><br>
producing a DC voltage at the X and Y outputs 110, 112. The X output 110 is<br>
called the "in-phase" component and the Y output 112 is called the "quadrature"<br>
component of the vector signal relative to the reference signal. Each of these<br>
components is phase sensitive; however, the vector magnitude and phase<br>
components can be separated by the following relationships :<br><br>
The relationship between the outputs from the lock-in amplifier 52 and the<br>
inputs from the displacement gauges 50 is derived as follows :<br>
Consider the two signas as sine waves with arbitrary amplitudes and<br>
arbitrary phase difference. Each signal can be represented as below :<br><br>
At the bottom PSD 106 the following operation occurs :<br><br>
This signal has a DC vo tage component and an AC component at twice<br>
the frequency. The Low Pass Filter (L.PF) 108 removes the AC component<br>
leaving<br><br><br>
At the top PSD 106 the folowing operation occurs :<br>
We have a cosine multiplier since cos ωt = sin(ωt + 90°).<br><br>
Again, we have a signal with AC and DC components, which after passing<br>
through the LPF 108, results in the following :<br><br>
Calculating the magnitude, R, and the phase angle, 8, from equations 1<br>
and 2 we have :<br>
and <br>
These calculations may be executed by any suitable digital or analog processing<br>
device 120. The vector phase is proportional to mass flow.<br>
Another method in accordance with embodiments of the invention<br>
requires a dual channel lock-in amplifier with the reference signal and one input<br>
signal supplied by one of the displacement gauges 50 and a second input signal<br>
supplied by the other displacement gauge 50. The difference between the two<br>
input signals is then measured against the reference signal. The resultant phase<br>
output from the lock-in amplifier is proportional to flow. Figure 7 is a functional<br>
schematic of a dual channel lock-in amplifier 54. The signals are moving in the<br><br>
same manner and have the same definitions as in Figure 6. The Left input 100 is<br>
also used as the reference signal. As before, the sine out 103 is the drive signal,<br>
phase locked to the Left input 100 signal. in this case, the Left Input 100 signal<br>
is subtracted from the Right Input 102 signal and mixed with the Left/Reference<br>
Input 100 signal and its 90° phased shifted signal 104 in the two Phase Sensitive<br>
Detectors (PSDs) 106. The internal functions are the same as in the lock-in<br>
amplifier 52 of Figure 6.<br>
The following derivation may be used to determine the relationship<br>
between the outputs from the lock-in amplifier 54 and the inputs from the<br>
displacement gauges 52. Any suitable digital or analog processing device 120<br>
may be used to perform the calculations.<br>
Consider the two signals as sine waves with arbitrary amplitudes and<br>
arbitrary phase difference. Each signal can be represented as below :<br>
Vleft= Vref= A Sin at<br>
VrigM™B sin (ot + $)<br>
The output of the Low No se Differential Amplifier 114 in this case will be<br><br>
At the bottom PSD 106 the following operation occurs :<br><br><br>
This signal has a DC voltage component and an AC component at twice<br>
the frequency. The Low Pass Filter (LPF) 108 removes the AC component<br>
leaving<br><br>
At the top PSD 106 the following operation occurs :<br><br>
We have a cosine multiplier since cos ωt = sin (ωt + 90°).<br><br>
Again, we have a signal with AC and DC components, which after passing<br>
through the LPF, results in the following ;<br><br>
Calculating the magnitude, R, and the phase angle, θ, from equations 1<br>
and 2 we have :<br>
and <br>
θ is no longer the phase angle, but is the arctangent, a function of the<br>
phase angle and the amplitudes of the Left and Right input signals. Analysis<br>
of this equation shows that θ is a strong function of Φ. In fact, the relative<br><br>
amplitudes of the input signals can control the strength of this function. This can<br>
be illustrated in graph shown in Figure 8, in which A and B are the amplitudes of<br>
the Left and Right signals respectively. As the amplitudes are more closely<br>
matched, the sensitivity is higher for the lock-in amplifier output, 6. Even for<br>
amplitudes that are matched within 2%, the sensitivity of θ to Φ is nearly 100<br>
times that of the standard lock-in amplifier configuration.<br>
Figure 9 is a functional schematic of a dual lock-in amplifier 56 with which<br>
another exemplary method for measuring the Coriolis force induced phase shift<br>
in accordance with the present nvention is implemented. The signals are moving<br>
in the same manner and have the same definitions as disclosed above. The Left<br>
input 100 is also used as the reference signal. As before, the sine out 103 is the<br>
drive signal, phase locked to the Left input 100 signal. In this case, the Left Input<br>
100 signal is mixed with itself and its 90° phased-shifted signal in the two Phase<br>
Sensitive Detectors (PSDs) 106 in the top lock-in amplifier 58. In the bottom lock-<br>
in amplifier 60, the Right Input ' 02 signal is mixed with the Left Input 100 signal<br>
and its 90° phased-shifted signal in the two Phase Sensitive Detectors (PSDs)<br>
106. The paired outputs from the non-phase shifted PSDs 106 and phase shifted<br>
PSDs 106 are differentiated in the two Low Noise Differential Amplifiers 114. The<br>
DC components of the signals are passed by the Low Pass Filters 108 to give<br>
the usual lock-in amplifier outpu:s. The mathematics, which may be executed by<br>
any suitable digital or analog processing device 120, are the same as in the<br>
method outlined above in conjunction with Figure 7, though the order in which<br>
the operations occur is different. In the Dual Channel Lock-in technique of<br><br>
Figure 7, two high level signals, with very small differences are subtracted. The<br>
low-level signal is then multiplied with a high level signal, which can introduce<br>
noise in analog circuits or round off errors in digital circuits. In the Dual Lock-in<br>
technique of Figure 9, the high level signals are first multiplied and the resulting<br>
signals, which are close in amplitude, are then subtracted resulting in an output<br>
with lower noise.<br>
A lock-in amplifier's use is most notable with respect to measuring a low-<br>
level signal that is buried in noise of a much higher amplitude. The lock-in<br>
amplifier accomplishes this by acting as an extremely narrow bandpass filter.<br>
The signal and noise is multiplied by a reference sine and cosine wave, and then<br>
passed through a low-pass filter to remove the reference frequency. The result of<br>
the multiply/filter operations are DC signals that represent a complex vector (x +<br>
iy). The phase difference between the reference frequency and the signal of<br>
interest can be determined by atan(y/x).<br>
In terms of measuring Coriolis force, the phase difference between two<br>
signals of the same frequency is of interest. This can be accomplished using<br>
dual lock-in amplifiers, each driven with the same reference frequency as shown<br>
in Figure 10. In the functional schematic illustrated in Figure 10, Left and Right<br>
input signals 100, 102 are multiplied by reference sine and cosine waves<br>
provided by a reference frequency generator 144. The input signals 100, 102 are<br>
mixed with the sine and cosine signals in PSDs 106, then passed through fifth-<br>
order bessel IIR low pass filters 148 as described in conjunction with Figure 6,<br>
Figure 7 and Figure 9. The multiply/filter process described above is performed<br><br>
on the Left and Right input signals 100, 102 with a resulting phase difference<br>
output X, Y of each signal with respect to the reference frequency. The<br>
difference between the two output signals X, Y represents the phase difference<br>
between the two input signals 100, 102. In the case of Coriolis mass flow, this<br>
phase difference represents an indication of mass flow 152.<br>
When using lock-in amplifiers to measure the extremely small phase<br>
differences associated with Coriolis mass flow, it is necessary to adjust the<br>
reference frequency to match the signal of interest. If the reference signal is not<br>
very close to the signal of interest, a very low frequency AC signal will appear at<br>
the outputs of the low-pass fiters 148. The frequency of the Coriolis sensor<br>
changes with mass flow, temperature, density and pressure, further complicating<br>
the measurement process.<br>
The reference frequency can be adjusted accurately by processing the<br>
output vector from one of the input signals 100, 102. First, the derivative of the<br>
output vector is calculated. This may be accomplished by calculating the<br>
complex difference between two consecutive output vectors. Then, the original<br>
output vector is rotated 90 degrees and the dot product of this vector and the<br>
derivative is calculated, resulting in an error signal 150 that is provided to the<br>
reference frequency generator 144. The error signal 150 is negative, positive, or<br>
zero, if the reference frequency needs to be adjusted down, up or unchanged,<br>
respectively.<br><br>
The amount of reference frequency adjustment is dependent on the<br>
accuracy of the phase measurement, but generally, the finer the adjustment, the<br>
better the accuracy as determhed by calculating the standard deviation over a<br>
number of output samples. However, the finer adjustment (small step changes)<br>
of reference frequency will be detrimental if there are step changes in the signal<br>
frequency, as the reference frequency generator 144 will take too long reaching<br>
the intended frequency. If the signal frequency experiences frequent step<br>
changes, a PID or adaptive algorithm can be used to adjust the reference<br>
frequency in a more responsive manner.<br>
In alternative embodiments, the capacitance displacement probes 50 may<br>
be mounted on piezoelectric actuators that would, first, align the capacitance<br>
displacement probes 50 in three dimensions. Further, when used with the dual<br>
channel lock-in amplifier or dual lock-in amplifier methods disclosed herein, the<br>
piezoelectric actuators can dynamically adjust the sensitivity of the flow sensor,<br>
thereby providing an extended range of operation.<br>
Such dynamic positioning provides compensation for manufacturing<br>
variability, particularly the positioning of the flow sensor tube relative to the<br>
capacitance displacement probe. Dynamic positioning also provides<br>
compensation for dimensional shifts due to relative thermal expansion of the<br>
various components. Used in combination with the dual channel lock-in amplifier<br>
or dual lock-in amplifier, dynamic positioning allows the two displacement signals<br>
to be closely matched to provide an adjustable sensitivity to flow. A low<br>
sensitivity would be used for high flow conditions while high sensitivity would be<br><br>
used for extended low flow conditions thereby increasing the dynamic range of<br>
flow measurement.<br>
Embodiments of the present invention additionally provide improved<br>
capacitance measurement techniques, specifically, a novel geometry of the<br>
capacitance displacement probe. Normally, the displacement of an object is<br>
measured as a distance normal to the capacitance displacement probe. The<br>
displacement may also be measured as a distance tangential to the capacitance<br>
displacement probe. Referring o Figure 11, this can be accomplished by placing<br>
two plates 130 side by side with a uniform gap 132 between the plates 130 and<br>
placed near a sensor tube 134 in the plane tangential to the motion (indicated by<br>
the arrow 136) as shown in Figure 11. In one embodiment, the plates 130 will be<br>
at the same potential and the sensor tube 134 will be at ground potential. The<br>
sensor tube 134 is positioned directly over the gap 132 between the plates 130<br>
with the expected motion 136 normal to the gap so that cyclic motion of the<br>
sensing tube 134 will position the tube 134 more closely to one plate 130 than<br>
the other 130. The relative capacitance is measured between each of the plates<br>
130 and the sensor tube 134. As the sensor tube 134 moves over one plate 130<br>
or the other, the amount of area contributing to the capacitance will change and<br>
thus the relative capacitance measured.<br>
An alternative configuration has the gap 132 running diagonally across the<br>
sensor tube 134 as shown in Figure 12. This allows a less precise placement of<br>
the sensor tube 134 over the plane of the plates 130. Misalignment of the sensor<br><br>
tube 134 will cause a smaller mismatch in the signal as compared to the parallel<br>
gap 132.<br>
A further embodiment has the gap 132 in a "saw tooth" pattern as shown<br>
in Figure 13. This is an improvement over the diagonal gap 132 in that an<br>
angular misalignment of the .sensor tube 134 with respect to the gap 132,<br>
whether parallel or diagonal, will cause a difference in the rate of change of<br>
capacitance between the two plates 130. This will introduce an unwanted change<br>
in phase between the two signals. The "saw tooth" pattern will average out any<br>
angular misalignment of the sensor tube 134, providing more symmetrical<br>
signals.<br>
Figure 14, Figure 15 and Figure 16 illustrate an exemplary low flow<br>
Coriolis mass flow controller 200 in accordance with an embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The Coriolis mass flow controller 200 includes a flow sensor<br>
portion 202 and a flow control portion 204. A processor either internal or external<br>
to the mass flow controller 200 receives an indication of a set point, or desired<br>
mass flow. The set point value is compared to the actual mass flow as indicated<br>
by flow sensor portion 202 to generate an error value. The flow control portion<br>
204 includes a valve that is manipulated to adjust the flow rate and minimize the<br>
error. The implementation of particular control schemes would be a routine<br>
undertaking for one skilled in the art having the benefit of this disclosure, and<br>
thus, the specifics of such an implementation are not addressed in detail herein.<br><br>
The flow sensor portion 202, which is surrounded by an enclosure 205,<br>
includes a sensor tube 206 that is bent into a loop shape, a drive device 208 and<br>
two pick off sensors 210 positioned at opposite sides of the sensor tube 206 that<br>
measure the displacement of the sides of the sensor tube 206.<br>
In existing Coriolis devices, the sensor is typically enclosed in a welded<br>
metal housing. The sensor tube within the housing also has attached to it<br>
displacement or velocity sensors with wires connecting through feedthroughs to<br>
electronics outside the housing The sensor tube in such devices is relatively<br>
large and has a resonant frequency that is about 100 Hz. For smaller sensor<br>
tubes, as in embodiments of he present invention, the resonant frequency is<br>
somewhat higher, on the order of 200 Hz and greater. As the frequency<br>
increases, there will be an increased viscous damping effect due to the<br>
atmospheric conditions inside the sensor enclosure. By evacuating the enclosure<br>
and utilizing vacuum compatibe materials inside the enclosure, the viscous<br>
damping can be reduced or' even eliminated. Thus, in the exemplary<br>
embodiment illustrated, the sensor tube 206 is situated within a vacuum sensor<br>
housing 207.<br>
The sensor tube 206 is designed 1:o allow elastic bending orthogonal to a<br>
line connecting the legs of the tube's loop. The loop is wide enough to allow<br>
elastic twisting about the center ine of the loop. In order to measure the Coriolis<br>
force at low flows, the sensor tube 206 mass needs to be minimized. Tube sizing<br>
is critical since the tube needs to be small, yet still capable of retaining the fluids<br>
at extended pressures. It is a so preferable for the pick off sensors 210 to be<br><br>
non-contact since any contact with the tube 206 or mass loading on the tube 206<br>
may suppress the Coriolis force.<br>
Pick off sensor technologies may include capacitive, magnetic,<br>
piezoresistive and optical. Piezoresistive, strain gauge displacement sensors do<br>
contact the tube but at the base of the loop where the displacement is minimum<br>
and the strain is the highest. This would have minimal effect on the tube's<br>
vibration. Optical technologies include various laser and white light<br>
interferometric displacement techniques, triangulation techniques, multiple<br>
internal reflection and beam occultation techniques. Magnetic displacement<br>
technologies include Hall effect, eddy current, variable reluctance and<br>
magnetoresistive techniques.<br>
Capacitive pick off sensor technology is used in the illustrated<br>
embodiment because it has the sensitivity required to measure the tube<br>
displacement, it is noncontact, and would not be affected by a magnetic drive<br>
device. The capacitive pick off sensors 210 each include at least one conductive<br>
plate 300, which is connected to a given voltage potential and situated adjacent<br>
the flow sensor tube 206 so as to define a gap therebetween. The flow sensor<br>
tube 206 is connected to a voltage potential different than the conductive plate<br>
300. The capacitance between the conductive plate 300 and the flow sensor<br>
tube 206 varies due to the relative motion of the conductive plate 300 and the<br>
flow sensor tube 206 when the flow sensor tube is vibrated 206.<br><br>
In the illustrated embodiment, the conductive plates comprise first and<br>
second plates as disclosed above in conjunction with Figures 11-13. In the<br>
particular embodiment illustrated, saw-tooth shaped plates, as illustrated in<br>
Figure 13, are employed. The capacitive pick off sensors 210 are assembled into<br>
an integrated sensor block 301 sized to fit into the sensor enclosure 207,<br>
dimensionally referenced to the back wall of the enclosure 207 by press pins<br>
302. The conductive plates 300 of the capacitive pick off sensors 210 are<br>
manufactured on a multilayer printed circuit board so as to provide a guard layer<br>
to minimize parasitic capacitance and a back contact layer for soldering to the<br>
sensor block 301. Since the capacitive pick off sensors 210 are required<br>
to operate in a vacuum, low outgassing materials are used in the illustrated<br>
embodiment. Standard fiberglass materials are not vacuum compatible. Desired<br>
material characteristics include that it be vacuum compatible, solderable,<br>
bondable into multilayers with a low outgassing bond and that it have a low<br>
dielectric constant for simple guard layer design. In a specific embodiment,<br>
commercially available DRUOID is used.<br>
The sensor block 301 containing the capacitive pick off sensors 210 can<br>
be adjusted to optimize the spacing to the sensor tube 206. This is accomplished<br>
using electron discharge machined hinge plates. Tapered set screws spread<br>
gaps to effect linear and angular movement of the capacitive pick off sensors.<br>
Further, the conductive plates 300 of the capacitive pick off sensors include<br>
contact pads that allow wires to be soldered or wire bonded to a printed circuit<br>
board 303 on the front of the sensor block interconnecting the capacitive pick off<br><br>
sensors 210 with a hermeticaly sealec electrical connector that interfaces with<br>
capacitance displacement electronics outside the sensor enclosure 207.<br>
The drive device 208 drives the tube 206 into a bending mode, vibration,<br>
causing it to vibrate. In the illustrated embodiment, the drive device 208 consists<br>
of a small magnet 304 soldered on the sensor tube 206 and a small<br>
electromagnetic coil 306 to al ernately push and pull on the magnet 304. In the<br>
embodiment shown in Figure '6, a non-rare earth magnet, and more particularly,<br>
a nickel plated samarium cobalt magnet is used. The samarium cobalt magnet<br>
has a good magnetic strength to weight ratio. !n this embodiment, the magnet<br>
weighs approximately 20 mg The magnet 304 is positioned at the top, center of<br>
the sensor tube 206 so that the magnetic poles are directed parallel to the tube's<br>
preferred displacement direction.<br>
The coil 306 is located outside the sensor enclosure 207, coupled to a<br>
circuit board 209. The sensor enclosure 207 is nonmagnetic and thus<br>
transparent to the magnetic fields. The coil 306 is an open coil type as opposed<br>
to a toroid design. In this embodiment the coil 306 is a commercially available<br>
power inductor rated at least 1 mH. The center axis of the coil 306 is aligned<br>
perpendicular to the face of the magnet 304. The sensor tube 206 is driven to<br>
resonance using the signal from one of the capacitive pick off sensors as<br>
feedback to the coil drive circuit through a phase locked loop (PLL) function. The<br>
function may be implemented as an electrical circuit or in software.<br><br>
The sensor tube 206 is mounted to a base portion 212, which defines a<br>
flow inlet 214 and a flow outlet 216, such that a flow passage is provided from<br>
the inlet, through the flow sensor tube 206, through the flow control portion 204,<br>
and through the sensor flow outlet 216. The flow control portion 202 includes a<br>
meter body 222 with a valve coil 228 and coil cover 230 situated therein. A valve<br>
stem 232 and plunger 234 are situated within the valve coil 228, and a valve<br>
body 236 is connected to the meter body 222 with a seal 238 therebetween. A<br>
valve seat 240, a spring 242 and an orifice 244 are positioned within the valve<br>
body 236. End blocks 224, 225 are situated on either end of the flow control<br>
portion 204 with seals 226 provided between the meter body 222 and end block<br>
224, and between the valve body 236 and end block 225. In one embodiment,<br>
the seals 226 comprise electroformed nickel seals.<br>
In an exemplary embodiment, the Coriolis mass flow controller 200 is<br>
assembled in the following manner. The meter body 222 and sensor enclosure<br>
207, as well as a base plate 310, a center post 312 and the sensor tube 206 are<br>
assembled and held in place by a fixture that dimensionally references the<br>
sensor tube 206 to the walls of the sensor enclosure 207. The remaining parts<br>
are indexed by press pins 330. These parts are then brazed as a single unit. The<br>
magnet 304 is soldered orto the sensor tube 206. The sensor block 301 is<br>
assembled and installed into the sensor enclosure 207 using press pins 302.<br>
The press pins 302 exteng through the back of the sensor enclosure 207 by<br>
approximately 0.5 mm. A hermetically sealed connector 320 is pressed into the<br>
back opening 322 of the sensor enclosure 207. The sensor block press pins 302<br><br>
and hermetically sealed connector 320 are laser welded to provide a leak tight<br>
seal. A cover 324 is placed over the front side of the sensor enclosure 207 in a<br>
vacuum environment and e-beam welded into place, providing a vacuum tight<br>
environment.<br>
The remaining valve components and end blocks 224, 225 are then<br>
assembled with the meter body 222. The electroformed nickel seals 226 may be<br>
used, or elastomeric o-rings may be used for calibration purposes, then replaced<br>
with the nickel seals. The electronics are assembled and installed on the<br>
completed assembly. An o-ring 332 is installed on the base plate 310 and the<br>
enclosure 205 is pressed down over the o-ring seal 332. Cam locks on the base<br>
plate 310 are rotated to lock down the enclosure 205. An o-ring 334 is installed<br>
on an electronics cover cap 336. The electronics cap 336 is positioned over a<br>
user interface connector 338. The electronics cap 336 is pressed into place on<br>
the enclosure 205 affecting the o-ring seal. The assembled mass flow controller<br>
200 is then tested and calibrated.<br>
The exemplary Coriolis mass flow controller 200 has a modular design<br>
that provides several benefits;. As discussed above, the electronics packaging is<br>
designed to effect o-ring seals at the flow body (between the lower end of the<br>
enclosure 205 and base plate 310) and at the top to a user interface cap<br>
(between the upper end of the enclosure 205 and electronics cap 336). The<br>
electronics cap 336 is connected to a user interface board 340 internal to the<br>
Coriolis mass flow controller 200, which is also connected, to the sense and<br>
control electronics. The electronics cap 336 and user interface board 340<br><br>
together define the interface to tne user's electronics. This allows the flexibility to<br>
configure the interface according to the user's requirements without the need to<br>
design different sense and control electronics and enclosure for each user<br>
configuration.<br>
A variant of the user interface cap, for example, will have seals and<br>
electrical conduit to provide a device that is IP-65/NEMA 4X compliant. An<br>
example of such a device 400 is shown in Figure 18. In comparison, the<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figures 14-16 includes a connector 342 coupled to the<br>
user interface board 340. As shown n Figure 18, an electronics cap 337 is<br>
extended to provide space, for the additional components required for a<br>
particular application.<br>
Another feature of an o-ring sealed enclosure 205 is that it provides a<br>
tertiary fluid containment, the sensor tube 206 being the primary fluid<br>
containment and the sensor enclosure 207 providing the secondary containment.<br>
In the event that the-e are bubbles in the fluid being controlled, the<br>
annular opening around the plunger in a conventional valve restricts the passage<br>
of bubbles to the outlet of the valve. Bubbles will collect at the entrance of the<br>
annular opening to the point that the liquid flow will be restricted and flow control<br>
will be lost. If the annular opening is enlarged, the increased spacing of the<br>
plunger from the valve coil will reduce the field strength in the magnetic circuit<br>
and thus reduce the effective force that can be achieved in order to open or<br>
close the valve against hydraulic forces created by the fluid. Thus, in<br>
the illustrated Coriolis mass flow controller 200, a circular hole 246 is provided<br><br>
through the plunger 234. The crcular hole 246 is compatible with the shape and<br>
size of the bubbles, allowing bubbles to pass more freely through the valve. This<br>
minimizes the possibility of flow restriction caused by the bubbles. The hole 246<br>
through the center of the plunger 234 minimizes any effects on the magnetic<br>
circuit so that the force to open and close the valve against hydraulic forces is<br>
maintained.<br>
With typical existing valves, the valve plunger has a captive seat that is<br>
made from some deformable material that, when pressed against the land of the<br>
orifice, will form a seal against flow. In the case of a normally closed, solenoid<br>
type valve, the force against the seat may be generated by a spring balanced so<br>
that the solenoid action lifts he seat from the orifice land. In the case of a<br>
normally open, solenoid type valve, the force against the seat is generated by<br>
the solenoid action and is balanced so that the spring lifts the seat from the<br>
orifice when the magnetic field is removed. The seat material may be<br>
elastomeric, plastic, or a ductile metal.<br>
It is usually preferable to have elastic deformation over plastic deformation<br>
so that the seal is repeatable. Alternatively, hard materials may be used for the<br>
seat and land, but fabricated to very tight tolerances including highly matched,<br>
surfaces between the seat ana land. This is a high cost approach. The spacing<br>
between the seat and land is critical to valve operation since the magnetic force<br>
on the plunger is not linear with displacement. In the case of a normally open<br>
valve, the normal position of the plunger and thus the seat relative to the land<br>
needs to be optimized in order to, provide the maximum force when the seat is<br><br>
moved against the land, while al owing the maximum flow in the open position. In<br>
a normally closed valve, the force of the seat against the land is generated by<br>
the spring. The spring force needs to be sufficient to close against hydraulic<br>
forces, yet minimized to allow he magnetic force to lift the seat from the land<br>
sufficient distance to allow maximum flow.<br>
Existing devices may use a variety of means to adjust the spacing<br>
between the seat and land, including placing shims under the land or seat, or<br>
having a threaded adjustmen: screw n the orifice component. As shown in<br>
Figure 17 A, however, a typical threaded adjustment in the orifice does not seal<br>
between the orifice body 250 and the valve body 252, leaving a leak path 254<br>
between threads 256. Such a threaded adjustment requires that the threads 256<br>
be sealed against fluid leakage. A separate seal, such as an o-ring or gasket<br>
provides this seal.<br>
In accordance with aspects of the present invention, the orifice 244 and/or<br>
land are made of a plastic material, such as VESPEL®, which is machinable into<br>
a threaded component with a precision orifice. As shown in the exemplary<br>
embodiment illustrated in Figure 17B, the threads 256 are machined oversized so<br>
that there is an interference fit 258 between the orifice body 250 and valve body<br>
252, thus sealing, eliminating the need for a separate seal (o-ring or gasket). The<br>
orifice land now is the deformable member simplifying the design and<br>
manufacture of the valve seat 240 and plunger 234 (referring to Figures 15 and<br>
16).<br><br>
The present invention, however, is not necessarily limited to any specific<br>
valve plunger configuration. In alternative embodiments, a pump is used in place<br>
of the valve. A metering pump for example, may be used for fluid control<br>
purpose. In particular, a piezoelectric pump may be employed that includes a<br>
plurality of piezoelectric tube portions. The piezoelectric tube portions are<br>
controlled in a manner to cause different tube portions to constrict or expand,<br>
thus allowing the fluid flow to be controlled as desired.<br>
The particular embodiments disclosed above are illustrative only, as the<br>
invention may be modified and practiced in different but equivalent manners<br>
apparent to those skilled in the art having the benefit of the teachings herein.<br>
Furthermore, no limitations are intended to the details of construction or design<br>
herein shown, other than as claimed hereinafter. It is therefore evident that the<br>
particular embodiments disclosed above may be altered or modified and all such<br>
variations are considered within the scope and spirit of the invention as claimed.<br><br>
