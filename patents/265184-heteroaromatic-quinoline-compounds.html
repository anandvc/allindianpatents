				<td>HETBROAROMATIC QU1NOLINE COMPOUNDS AND THEIR USE AS PDE10 INHIBITORS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention pertains to heteroeromatic compounds that.serve es effective phosphodiestierase (PDE) inhibitors. The invention also relates to compounds which ere selective inhibitors of PDE 10. The invention further relates to Intermediates for preparation of such compounds; pharmaceutical compositions comprising such compounds; and the use of such compounds in methods for treating certain central nervous system (CNS) or other disorders. The invention relates also to methods for treating neurodegenerative and psychiatric disorders, for example psychosis and disorders comprising deficient cognition as a<br>
symptom.<br>
Background of Invention<br>
Phosphodiesterases (PDEs) are a class of intrecellular enzymes Involved In the hydrolysis of the nucleotides cyclic edenosine monophosphate (cAMP) and cyclic guanosine monophosphates (cGMP) into their respective nucleotide monophosphates. The cyclic nucleotides cAMP and cGMP are synthesized by edenylyl and guanylyl cyclases, respectively, and serve as secondary messengers in several cellular pathways.<br>
The cAMP and cGMP function as intracellular second messengers regulating e vast<br>
array of intracellular processes particularly in neurons of the central nervous system.   In<br>
neurons, this includes the activation of cAMP and cGMP-dependent kineses end subsequent<br>
phosphorylation of proteins involved in acute regulation of synaptic transmission es well es in<br>
neuronal differentiation and survival. The complexity of cyclic nucleotide signaling is indicated<br>
by the molecular diversity of the enzymes involved in the synthesis and degradation of cAMP<br>
and cGMP. There are at least ten families of adenylyl cyclases, two of guenylyl cyclases, end<br>
eleven of phosphodiesterases. Furthermore, different types of neurons ere known to express<br>
multiple   isozymes   of   each   of   these   classes,   and   there   is   good   evidence   for<br>
compartmentalization and specificity of function for different isozymes within e given neuron.<br>
A   principal   mechanism   for   regulating   cyclic   nucleotide   signaling   is   by<br>
phosphodiesterase-catalyzed cyclic nucleotide catabolism.  There are 11 known families of<br>
PDEs encoded by 21 different genes. Each gene typically yields multiple splice variants that<br>
further contribute to the isozyme diversity.  The PDE families are distinguished functionally<br>
based on cyclic nucleotide substrate specificity, mechanfsm(s) of regulation, and sensitivity to<br>
inhibitors. Furthermore, PDEs are differentially expressed throughout the organism, including<br>
in the central nervous system.    As a result of these distinct enzymatic activities and<br>
localization, different PDEs ' isozymes can serve distinct physiological functions. Furthermore,<br>
compounds that can selectively inhibit distinct PDE families or isozymes may offer particular<br>
therapeutic effects, fewer side effects, or both.<br><br>
PDE10 is identified as a unique family based on primary amino acid sequence and<br>
distinct enzymatic activity. Homology screening of EST databases revealed mouse PDE10A<br>
as trie first member of the PDE10 family of PDEs (Fujishige et al., J. Biol. Chem. 274:18438-<br>
18445, 1999; Loughney, K. et al., Gene 234:109-117, 1999).  The murine homologue has<br>
also been cloned (Soderling, S. et al., Proc. Nafl. Acad. Sci. USA 96:7071-7076,1999)and N-<br>
terminal splice variants of both the rat and human genes have been identified (Kotera, J. et<br>
al., Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 261:551-557,1999; Fujishige, K. et at., Eur. J. Biochem.<br>
266:1118-1127, 1999).   There is a high degree of homology across species.  The mouse<br>
PDE10A1 is a 779 amino acid protein that hydrolyzes both cAMP and cGMP to AMP and<br>
GMP, respectively. The affinity of PDE10 for cAMP (Km = 0.05 µM) is higher than for cGMP<br>
(Km = 3 µM).  However, the approximately 5-fold greater Vmax for cGMP over cAMP has<br>
lead to the suggestion that PDE10 is a unique cAMP-inhibited cGMPase (Fujishige et al., J.<br>
Biol. Chem. 274:18438-18445,1999).<br>
The PDE 10 family of polypeptides shows a lower degree of sequence homology as compared to previously identified PDE families and has been shown to be insensitive to certain inhibitors that are known to be specific for other PDE families. United States Patent No. 6,350,603, incorporated herein by reference.<br>
PDE10 also is uniquely localized in mammals relative to other PDE families. mRNA for PDE10 is highly expressed only in testis and brain (Fujishige, K. et al., Eur J Biochem. 266:1118-1127, 1999; Soderling, S. et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 96:7071-7076, 1999; Loughney, K. et al., Gene 234:109-117,1999). These Initial studies indicated that within the brain PDE10 expression is highest in the striatum (caudate and putamen), n. accumbens, and olfactory tubercle. More recently, a detailed analysis has been made of the expression pattern in rodent brain of PDE10 mRNA (Seeger, T.F. et al., Abst Soc. Neurosci. 26:345.10, 2000)and PDE10 protein (Menniti, F.S., Stick, C.A., Seeger, T.-F., and Ryan, A.M., Immunohistochemical localization of PDE10 in the rat brain. William Harvey Research Conference  Phosphodfesterase in Health and Disease', Porto, Portugal, Dec. 5-7,2001).<br>
A variety of therapeutic uses for PDE inhibitors has been reported including obtrusive lung disease, allergies, hypertension, angina, congestive heart failure, depression and erectile dysfunction (WO 01/41807 A2, incorporated herein by reference).<br>
The use of selected benzimidazole and related heterocyclic compounds in the treatment of ischemic heart conditions has been disclosed based upon inhibition of PDE associated cGMP activity. United States Patent 5,693,652, incorporated herein by reference. United States Patent Application Publication No. 2003/0032579 discloses a method for treating certain neurologic and psychiatric disorders with the selective PDE10 inhibitor papaverine. In particular, the method relates to psychotic disorders such as schizophrenia, delusional disorders and drug-induced psychosis; to anxiety disorders such as panic and<br><br>
obsessive-compulsive disorder; and to movement disorders including Parkinson's disease and Huntington's disease.<br>

The present invention includes all enantiomers, diastereomers, and other stereoisomers of such compounds of the Formula i, as well as racemic compounds and racemic mixtures and other mixtures of stereoisomers thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the compounds of Formula I include the acid addition and base salts thereof.<br>
Suitable acid addition salts are formed from acids which form non-toxic salts.<br>
Examples include, but are not limited to, the acetate, adipate, aspartate, benzoate, besylate,<br>
bicarbonate/carbonate, bisulphate/sulphate, borate, camsylate, citrate, cyclamate, edisyiate,<br>
esylate,   formate,   fumarate,   gluceptate,   giuconate,   glucuronate,   hexafiuorophosphate,<br>

Hemisalts of acids and bases may also be formed, for example, hemisulphate and hemicalcium salts.<br>
For a review on suitable salts, see Handbook of Pharmaceutical Salts: Properties, Selection, and Use by Stahl and Wermuth {Wiley-VCH, 2002).<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of compounds of Formula I may be prepared by one or more of three methods:<br>
(i)         by reacting the compound of Formula I with the desired acid or base; (ii)        by removing an acid- or base-labile protecting group from a suitable precursor of the compound of Formula I or by ring-opening a suitable cyclic precursor, for example, a lactone or lactam, using the desired acid or base; or<br>
(iii) by converting one salt of the compound of Formula I to another by reaction with an appropriate acid or base or by means of a suitable ion exchange column.<br>
All three reactions are typically carried out in solution. The resulting salt may precipitate out and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent. The degree of ionization in the resulting salt may vary from completely ionised to almost non-ionised.<br>
The compounds of the invention may exist in a continuum of solid states ranging from<br>
fully amorphous to fully crystalline. The term 'amorphous* refers to a state in which the<br>
material lacks long range order at the molecular level and, depending upon temperature, may<br>
exhibit the physical properties of a solid or a liquid. Typically such materials do not give<br>
distinctive X-ray diffraction patterns and, while exhibiting the properties of a solid, are more<br>
formally described as a liquid. Upon heating, a change from solid to liquid properties occurs<br>
which is characterised by a change of state, typically second order ('glass transition'). The<br>
term 'crystalline* refers to a solid phase in which the material has a regular ordered internal<br>
structure at the molecular level and gives a distinctive X-ray diffraction pattern with defined<br>
peaks. Such materials when heated sufficiently will also exhibit the properties of a liquid, but<br>
the change from solid to liquid is characterised by a phase change, typically first order<br>
('melting point).<br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in unsolvated and solvated forms. The term 'solvate' is used herein to describe a molecular complex comprising the compound of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable solvent molecules, for example, ethanol. The term 'hydrate* is employed when said solvent is water.<br>
A currently accepted classification system for organic hydrates is one that defines isolated site, channel, or metal-ion coordinated hydrates - see Polymorphism in Pharmaceutical Solids by K. R. Morris (Ed. H. G. Brittain, Marcel Dekker, 1995). Isolated site hydrates are ones in which the water molecules are isolated from direct contact with each other by intervening organic molecules. In channel hydrates, the water molecules lie in lattice channels where they are next to other water molecules. In metal-ion coordinated hydrates, the water molecules are bonded to the metal iron.<br>
When the solvent or water is tightly bound, the complex will have a well-defined stoichiometry independent of humidity. When, however, the solvent or water is weakly bound, as in channel solvates and hygroscopic compounds, the water/solvent content will be dependent on humidity and drying conditions. In such cases, non-stoichiometry will be the norm.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in a mesomorphic state (mesophase or liquid crystal) when subjected to suitable conditions. The mesomorphic state is intermediate between the true crystalline state and the true liquid state (either melt or solution). Mesomorphism arising as the result of a change in temperature is described as 'thermotropic' and that resulting from the addition of a second component, such as water or another solvent, is described as 'lyotropic'. Compounds that have the potential to form lyotropic mesophases are described as 'amphiphilic' and consist of molecules which possess an ionic (such as -COO-Na+, -COO-K+, or -SO3-Na+) or non-ionic (such as -N-N+(CH3)3) polar head group. For more information, see Crystals and the Polarizing Microscope by N. H. Hartshorne and A. Stuart, 4th Edition (Edward Arnold, 1970).<br>
Hereinafter ail references to compounds of Formula I include references to salts, solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals thereof and to solvates, multi-component complexes and liquid crystals of salts thereof.<br>
The compounds of the invention include compounds of Formula I as hereinbefore defined, including all polymorphs and crystal habits thereof, prodrugs and isomers thereof (including optical, geometric and tautomeric isomers) as hereinafter defined and isotopically-labeled compounds of Formula I.<br>
As indicated, so-called 'prodrugs' of the compounds of Formula I are also within the scope of the invention. Thus certain derivatives of compounds of Formula I which may have little or no pharmacological activity themselves can, when administered into or onto the body, be converted into compounds of Formula I having the desired activity, for example, by hydrolytic cleavage. Such derivatives are referred to as 'prodrugs'. Further information on the use of prodrugs may be found in Pro-drugs as Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14, ACS Symposium Series (T. Higuchi and W. Stella) and Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, Pergamon Press, 1987 (Ed. E. B. Roche, American Pharmaceutical Association).<br>
Prodrugs in accordance with the invention can, for example, be produced by replacing appropriate functionalities present in the compounds of Formula I with -certain moieties known to those skilled in the art as 'pro-moieties' as described, for example, in Design of Prodrugs by H. Bundgaard (Elsevier, 1985).<br>
Some examples of prodrugs in accordance with the invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
(i)        where the compound of Formula I contains a carboxylic acid functionality. (-COOH), an ester thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the carboxylic acid functionality of the compound of Formula (I) is replaced by (C1-C8)alkyl;<br><br>
 (ii) where the compound of Formula I contains an alcohol functionality {-OH), an ether thereof, for example, a compound wherein the hydrogen of the alcohol functionality of the compound of Formula I is replaced by (C1-C6)alkanoyloxymethyl; and<br>
(iii) where the compound of Formula I contains a primary or secondary amino functionality (-NH2 or -NHR where R ≠ H), an amide thereof, for example, a compound wherein, as the case may be, one or both hydrogens of the amino functionality of the compound of Formula I is/are replaced by (C1-C10)alkanoyl.<br>
Further examples of replacement groups in accordance with the foregoing examples and examples of other prodrug types may be found in the aforementioned references.<br>
Moreover, certain compounds of Formula I may themselves act as prodrugs of other compounds of Formula I.<br>
Also included within the scope of the invention are metabolites of compounds of Formula I, that is, compounds formed in vivo upon administration of the drug. Some examples of metabolites in accordance with the invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
(i) where the compound of Formula I contains a methyl group, an hydroxymethyl derivative thereof (-CH3 -&gt; -CH2OH):<br>
(ii) where the compound of Formula I contains an alkoxy group, an hydroxy derivative thereof (-OR -&gt; -OH);<br>
(iii) where the compound of Formula I contains a tertiary amino group, a secondary amino derivative thereof (-NR1R2 -&gt; -NHR1 or -NHR2);<br>
(iv) where the compound of Formula I contains a secondary amino group, a primary derivative thereof (-NHR1 -&gt; -NH2);<br>
(v) where the compound of Formula I contains a phenyl moiety, a phenol derivative thereof (-Ph -&gt; -PhOH); and<br>
(vi) where the compound of Formula I contains an amide group, a carboxyiic acid derivative thereof (-CONH2 -&gt; COOH);<br>
(vii)      where the compound contains an aromatic nitrogen atom or an tetrtiary aliphatic amine function, an N-oxide derivative thereof.<br>
Compounds of Formual I having a nitrogen atom in a tertiary amine functional group may be further substituted with oxygen (i.e., an N-oxide);<br>
Compounds of Formula I containing one or more asymmetric carbon atoms can exist as two or more stereoisomers. Where a compound of Formula I contains an alkenyl or alkenylene group, geometric cisltrans {or Z/E) isomers are possible. Where structural isomers are interconvertible via a low energy barrier, tautomeric isomerism {'tautomerism') can occur. This can take the form of proton tautomerism in compounds of Formula I containing, for example, an imino, keto, or oxime group, or so-calied valence tautomerism in compounds that contain an aromatic moiety. It follows that a single compound may exhibit more than one type of isomerism.<br>
Included within the scope of the present invention are all stereoisomers, geometric isomers and tautomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I, including compounds exhibiting more than one type of isomerism, and mixtures of one or more thereof. Also included are acid addition or base salts wherein the counterion is optically active, for example, d-lactate or /-lysine, or racemic, for example, dl-tartrate or o7-arginine.<br>
Cis/irans isomers may be separated by conventional techniques well known to those skilled in the art, for example, chromatography and fractional crystallisation.<br>
Conventional techniques for the preparation/isolation of individual enantiomers include chiral synthesis from a suitable optically pure precursor or resolution of the racemate (or the racemate of a salt or derivative) using, for example, chiral high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC).<br>
Alternatively, the racemate (or a racemic precursor) may be reacted with a suitable optically active compound, for example, an alcohol, or, in the case where the compound of Formula I contains an acidic or basic moiety, a base or acid such as 1-phenylethylamine or tartaric acid. The resulting diastereomeric mixture may be separated by chromatography and/or fractional crystallization and one or both of the diastereoisomers converted to the corresponding pure enantiomer(s) by means well known to a skilled person.<br>
Chiral compounds of the invention (and chiral precursors thereof) may be obtained in enantiomerically-enriched form using chromatography, typically HPLC, on an asymmetric resin with a mobile phase consisting of a hydrocarbon, typically heptane or hexane, containing from 0 to 50% by volume of isopropanol, typically from 2% to 20%, and from 0 to 5% by volume of an alkylamine, typically 0.1% diethylamine. Concentration of the eluate affords the enriched mixture.<br>
When any racemate crystallises, crystals of two different types are possible. The first type is the racemic compound (true racemate) referred to above wherein one homogeneous form of crystal is produced containing both enantiomers in equimolar amounts. The second type is the racemic mixture or conglomerate wherein two forms of crystal are produced in equimolar amounts each comprising a single enantiomer.<br>
While both of the crystal forms present in a racemic mixture have identical physical properties, they may have different physical properties compared to the true racemate. Racemic mixtures may be separated by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art - see, for example, Stereochemistry of Organic Compounds by E. L. Eliel and S. H. Wilen (Wiley, 1994).<br>
The present invention includes all pharmaceutically acceptable isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula I wherein one or more atoms are replaced by atoms having the same atomic number, but an atomic mass or mass number different from the atomic mass or mass number which predominates in nature.<br>
Examples of isotopes suitable for inclusion in the compounds of the invention include, but are not limited to, isotopes of hydrogen, such as 2H and 3H, carbon, such as 11C, 13C and 14C, chlorine, such as 38Cl, fluorine, such as 18F, iodine, such as 123I and 125I, nitrogen, such as 13N and 16N, oxygen, such as 15O, 17O and 18O, phosphorus, such as 32P, and sulphur, such as 35S.<br>
Certain isotopically-labelled compounds of Formula I, for example, those incorporating a radioactive isotope, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. The radioactive isotopes tritium, i.e. 3H, and carbon-14, i.e. 14C, are particularly useful for this purpose in view of their ease of incorporation and ready means of detection.<br>
Substitution with heavier isotopes such as deuterium, i.e. 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements, and hence may be preferred in some circumstances. <br>
Substitution with positron emitting isotopes, such as 11C, 1BF, 16O and 13N, can be useful in Positron Emission Topography (PET) studies for examining substrate receptor occupancy.<br>
IsotopicaJly-labeled compounds of Formula I can generally be prepared by conventional techniques known to those skilled in the art or by processes analogous to those described in the accompanying Examples and Preparations using an appropriate isotopically-labeled reagent in place of the non-labeled reagent previously employed.<br>

The compound of the invention may be administered either alone or "in combination with pharmaceutically acceptable carriers, in either single or multiple doses. Sukable pharmaceutical carriers include inert solid diluents or fillers, sterile aqueous solutions and various organic solvents. The pharmaceutical compositions formed thereby can then be readily administered in a variety of dosage forms such as tablets, powders, lozenges, liquid preparations, syrups, injectable solutions and the like. These pharmaceutical compositions can optionally contain additional ingredients such as flavorings, binders, excipients and the like. Thus, the compound of the invention may be formulated for oral, buocal, intranasal,<br><br>
parenteral (e.g. intravenous, intramuscular or subcutaneous), transdermal {e.g. patch) or rectal administration, or in a form suitable for administration by inhalation or insufflation.<br>
For oral administration, the pharmaceutical compositions may take the form of, for example, tablets or capsules prepared  by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable   excipients   such   as   binding   agents   (e.g.   pregelatinized   maize   starch, polyvinylpyrrolidone or hydroxypropyl methylcellulose); fillers (e.g. lactose, microcrystalline cellulose or calcium phosphate);  lubricants (e.g. magnesium stearate, talc or silica); disintegrants (e.g. potato starch or sodium starch glycolate); or wetting agents (e.g. sodium lauryl sulphate).   The tablets may be coated by methods well known in the art.   Liquid preparations for oral administration may take the form of, for example, solutions, syrups or suspensions, or they may be presented as a dry product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use.   Such liquid preparations may be prepared by conventional means with pharmaceutically acceptable additives such as suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, methyl cellulose or hydrogenated edible fats); emulsifying agents (e.g. lecithin or acacia); non-aqueous vehicles (e.g. almond oil, oily esters or ethyl alcohol); and preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid).<br>
For buccai administration, the composition may take the form of tablets or lozenges formulated in conventional manner.<br>
The compounds of the invention may be formulated for parenteral administration by injection, including using conventional catheterization techniques or infusion. Formulations for injection may be presented in unit dosage form, e.g. in ampules or in multi-dose containers, with an added preservative. They may take such forms as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and may contain formulating agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents. Alternatively, the active ingredient may be in powder form for reconstitution with a suitable vehicle, e.g. sterile pyrogen-free water, before use.<br>
When a product solution is required, it can be made by dissolving the isolated inclusion complex in water (or other aqueous medium) in an amount sufficient to generate a solution of the required strength for oral or parenteral administration to patients. The compounds may be formulated for fast dispersing dosage forms (fddf), which are designed to release the active ingredient in the oral cavity. These have often been formulated using rapidly soluble gelatin-based matrices. These dosage forms are well known and can be used to deliver a wide range of drugs. Most fast dispersing dosage forms utilize gelatin as a carrier or structure-forming agent. Typically, gelatin is used to give sufficient strength to the dosage form to prevent breakage during removal from packaging, but once placed in the mouth, the gelatin allows immediate dissolution of the dosage form. Alternatively, various starches are used to the same effect.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also be formulated in rectal compositions such as suppositories or retention enemas, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>
For intranasal administration or administration by inhalation, the compound of the invention is conveniently delivered in the form of a solution or suspension from a pump spray container that is squeezed or pumped by the patient or as an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurized container or a nebulizer, with the use of a suitable propellant, e.g. dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoroethane, carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurized container or nebulizer may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound. Capsules and cartridges (made e.g. from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated containing a powder mix of a compound of the invention and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
Aerosol formulations for treatment of the conditions referred to above (e.g. migraine) in the average adult human are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or "puff" of aerosol contains about 20 mg to about 1000 mg of the compound of the invention. The overall daily dose with an aerosol will be within the range of about 100 mg to about 10 mg. Administration may be several times daily, e.g. 2,3,4 or 8 times, giving for example, 1,2 or 3 doses each time.<br>
A proposed daily dose of the compound of the invention for oral, parenteral, rectal or buccal administration to the average adult human for the treatment of the conditions referred to above is from about 0.01 mg to about 2000 mg, preferably from about 0.1 mg to about 200 mg of the active ingredient of formula I per unit dose which could be administered, for example, 1 to 4 times per day.<br>
Assay methods are available to screen a substance for inhibition of cyclic nucleotide hydrolysis by the PDE 10 and the PDEs from other gene families. The cyclic nucleotide substrate concentration used in the assay is 1/3 of the Km concentration, allowing for<br>
comparisons of IC50 values across the different enzymes. PDE activity is measured using a Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA)-based method as previously described (Fawcett et al., 2000). The effect of PDE inhibitors is determined by assaying a fixed amount of enzyme (PDEs 1-11) in the presence of varying substance concentrations and low substrate, such that the IC50 approximates the Kj (cGMP or cAMP in a 3:1 ratio unlabelled to [3H]-labeled at a concentration of 1/3 Km).). The final assay volume is made up to 100µl with assay buffer 150 mM Tris-HCI pH 7.5, 8.3 mM MgCI2, 1 mg/ml bovine serum albumin]. Reactions are initiated with enzyme, incubated for 30-60 min at 30°C to give 
respective unlabelled cyclic nucleotide for PDEs 9 and 11). Plates are re-sealed and shaken for 20 min, after which the beads were allowed to settle for 30 minutes in the dark and then counted on a TopCount plate reader (Packard, Meriden, CT). Radioactivity units can be converted to percent activity of an uninhibited control (100%), plotted against inhibitor concentration and inhibitor IC50 values can be obtained using the "Fit Curve' Microsoft Excel extension.<br>
Using such assay, compounds of the present invention were determined to have an IC50 for inhibiting PDE10 activity of less than about 10 micromolar.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
Scheme 1 depicts the preparation of the pyrazole class of compounds of this invention. Alkylation of a substituted phenol with 2-methyl chloro quinoline provides the desired ether. Hydrolysis of the ester and treatment with thionyl chloride provides the desired acid chloride. Addition of O,N-dimethyl hydroxyl amine hydrochloride provides the Weinreb amide for coupling (Weinreb et a), Tet Lett., 1981, 22(39) 3815). Anion generation with 4-picoline and IDA followed by addition of the Weinreb amide affords the ketone. The ketone<br><br>
can then be treated with dimethoxymethyl-dimethyl amine at reflux to form the enaminone intermediate. Treatment with various hydrazines affords the pyrazole analogues. A variety of ratios of the two isomers were obtained. These isomers were separated via, crystallization, Biotage MPLC, preparative TLC or preparative HPLC. This reaction scheme is general for a variety of starting substituted phenols, substituted quinolines and substituted hydrazines.<br>

Alternatively, the substituted pyrazole compounds can be prepared by alkylation of the NH pyrazole. One set of conditions is the utilization of cesium carbonate as the base with an alkyl halide as the electrophile in a solvent such as dimethyl formamide. Some reactions require heating.<br>

As depicted In Scheme 3, a variety of heterocycles can be prepared from the enaminone intermediate. Pyrimidines can be prepared by heating with substituted formamides in the presence of ethanol and sodium ethoxide. Isoxazoles are prepared by heating the enaminone with hydroxyl amine in methanol/acetic acid. Only one isomer in the isoxazole case is formed. By heating with amino pyroles, amino imidazoles or amino triazoles, 6-5 bicyclic systems can be formed.<br><br>

A variety of 4-pyridyl heterocyclic replacements can be prepared according to scheme 4. Methyl heterocycles such as 3,5-dimethyl isoxazole and methyl pyridazine can be deprotated with lithium diisopropyl amide and added to a Weinreb amide (Weinreb et al, Tet Lett., 1981, 22(39) 3815) to provide the desired ketone. Sequential treatment with dimethoxymethyl-dimethyl amine and a hydrazine provides the heterocyclic pyrazoles. Pyrimidines and isoxazoles can also be prepared as described in Scheme 3.<br><br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
N-pyridyl pyrazoles can be prepared according to Scheme 5. The starting ketones are prepared by alkylation of the phenol as depicted in Scheme 1. Treatment of the ketone with dimethoxymethyl-dimethyl amine followed by addition of 4-pyridyl hydrazine {see J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45(24) 5397) provides the desired compounds. Other heterocyclic replacements for 4-pyridyl can be prepared by using the requisite hydrazine.<br>

As depicted in Scheme 6, 3-substituted-N-pyridyl pyrazoles can be prepared by literature methods, (see J. Med. Chem. 2004, 47, 2180). Treatment of the acetophenone (prepared according to scheme 1) with sodium methoxide and dimethyl oxalate provides the ester intermediate. Addition of 4-pyridyl hydrazine (see J. Med. Chem. 2002, 45(24) 5397) provides the pyrazole with an ester at the 3-position. This ester can be converted to amides by hydrolysis and coupling with amines. It can be converted to ethers by reduction to the alcohol and alkylation. Amine formation is capable by amide formation followed by reduction or conversion to the aldehyde followed by reductive amination. All of these transformations can be carried out by those skilled in the art of organic chemistry.<br>

The benzyl intermediates can be prepared by the method shown in scheme 1. The benzyl ether can be removed via treatment with hydrogen gas over a palladium catalyst such as palladium on carbon or palladium hydroxide in a variety of solvents. The phenol can then be alkylated using a benzylic chloride in acetone heating with potassium carbonate. Also Mitsunobu chemistry (Hughes, D.L., The Mitsunobu Reaction. Organic Reactions. Vol. 42. 1992, New York. 335-656.) can be applied to couple the phenol with alcohols.<br><br>

Many benzylic halides or alcohols are commericially available or are known in the literature. General ways to make these intermediates by those skilled in the art are reduction of an ester, acid or aldehyde to form an alcohol. One general procedure is the oxidation of a benylic site with selenium dioxide to provide an aldehyde that is subsequentially reduced with sodium borohydride. Benzylic halide can be formed vial halogenation (see Syn. Comm. 1995, 25(21)3427-3434).<br>

Triazole analogues can be prepared in many ways. One way is depicted in Scheme 9. Treatment of a hydrazide with dimethyl formamide dimethyl acetal to form an intermediate, which is subsequently treated with an amine or aniline with the addition of heat and acetic acid provides the 1,2,4 triazoles (see Org. Lett, 2004, 6(17), 2969-2971). The regioisomeric triazoles can be prepared by interchanging the functionality of the starting materials.<br>

The inverted ketone isomer can be prepared according to Scheme 11. (Bunting et at. JACS, 1988,110, 4008.) The starting aldehyde is coupled with a phosphonate to provide the enaminone. The enaminone is hydrolyzed to provide the desired ketone. The ketone can then be utilized according to Scheme 1,2 and 3 to provide the desired compounds<br><br>

Scheme 12 depicts a method for synthesizing a 4,5-diaryl oxazole. In the illustrated case,   4-benzyloxy-benzaldehyde   and   4-methylbenzenesulfinic   acid   are   heated   with formamide to generate a substituted formamide as shown. This transformation is known in the literature.[J. Med Chem., 2002, 45, 1697] Dehydration of the formamide in a reaction mediated by POCI3 gives a tosylmethyl isocyanate. This class of compound can be treated with  an  aldehyde  and  a  base  to  yield  an  oxazole.   In  the   illustrated   case,   the tosylmethylisocyanate is treated with isonicotinaldehyde and potassium carbonate. The product of this reaction is an oxazole possessing a 4-benzyloxyphenyl group at the 4-position of the oxazole ring, and a 4-pyridyl substituent at the 5-position. These substituents can be substituted with other aryl groups simply by utilizing different aryl-aldehydes for steps one and three of the sequence. Cleavage of the benzyloxy group is achieved by the standard method of catalytic hydrogenation, and the resultant phenol is easily alkylated by treatment with an alkyl halide, such as 2-(chloromethyl)quinoline, and cesium fluoride in DMF. The method is not limited to the illustrated case as the relative positions of the phenyl and pyridyl rings can be switched, and said rings may comprise a variety of aryl groups displaying various substitution patterns.<br>

Scheme 13 depicts a method for preparing 4,5-substituted oxazoles possessing alkyl group substitution in the 2-position of the oxazole ring. In the illustrated case, 1-{4-Benzyloxy-phenyl)-2-pyridin-4-yl-ethanone is brominated by treatment with bromine in acetic acid<br>
according to traditional methods. The resultant α-bromoketone is then treated with ammonium<br>
acetate and sodium acetate in acetic acid, which yields the methyl-substituted oxazole ring as<br>
disclosed in the patent literature (WO 9513067). The methyl group can be replaced by other<br>
alkyl groups. For example, substitution of ammonium ethanoate, sodium ethanoate, and<br>
ethanoic acid acid would yield ethyl group substitution. Cleavage of the benzyloxy group is<br>
achieved by the standard method of catalytic hydrogenation, and the resultant phenol is easily<br>
alkylated by treatment with an alkyl halide as described above. The method is not limited to<br>
the illustrated case as the relative positions of the phenyl and pyridyl rings can be switched,<br>

A compound of formula 2A wherein R1 is alkyl, benzyl, or allyl, is condensed with 4-pyridine carboxaldehyde in solvent such as toluene and is heated to reflux with a Dean-Stark apparatus attached to remove water for about 40 hours. After removal of toluene, the crude imine is mixed with tosylmethylisocyanide and a base such as potassium carbonate, in a solvent mixture of 1,2-dimethoxyethane and methanol, and is heated at reflux for about 3 hours to afford 3A.<br>
