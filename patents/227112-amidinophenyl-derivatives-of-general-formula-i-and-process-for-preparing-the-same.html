				<td>New derivatives of 2-(iminomethvl)amino-phenvl.<br>
their preparation, their use as medicaments and the pharmaceutical compositions containing them<br>
A subject of the present invention is new derivatives of 2-(iminomethyl)amino-phenyl which have an inhibitory activity on NO-synthase enzymes producing nitrogen monoxide NO and/or an activity which traps the reactive oxygen species (ROS). The invention relates to the derivatives corresponding to general formula (I) defined below, their preparation methods, the pharmaceutical preparations containing them and their use for therapeutic purposes, in particular their use as NO-synthase inhibitors and selective or non selective traps for reactive oxygen species.<br>
Given the potential role of NO and the ROS's in physiopathology, the new derivatives described corresponding to general formula (I) may produce beneficial or favourable effects in the treatment of pathologies where these chemical species are involved. In particular:<br>
•	cardio-vascular and cerebro-vascular disorders including for example artherosclerosis, migraine, arterial hypertension, septic shock, ischemic or hemorragic cardiac or cerebral infarctions., ischemias and thromboses.<br>
•	disorders of the central or peripheral nervous system such as for example neurodegenerative diseases where there can in particular be mentioned cerebral infarctions, sub-arachnoid haemorrhaging, ageing, senile dementias including Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's chorea, Parkinson's disease, Creutzfeld Jacob disease and prion diseases, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis but also pain, cerebral and bone marrow traumas, addiction to opiates, alcohol and addictive substances, erective and reproductive disorders, cognitive disorders, encephalopathies, encephalopathies of viral or toxic origin.<br>
•	disorders of the skeletal muscle and neuromuscular joints (myopathy, myosis) as well as cutaneous diseases.<br>
•	proliferative and inflammatory diseases such as for example artherosclerosis, pulmonary hypertension, respiratory distress, glomerulonephritis, portal hypertension, psoriasis, arthrosis and rheumatoid arthritis, fibroses, amyloidoses, inflammations of the gastrointestinal system (colitis, Crohn's disease) or of the pulmonary system and airways (asthma, sinusitis, rhinitis).<br>
•   organ transplants.<br><br>
•	auto-immune and viral diseases such as for example lupus, AIDS, parasitic and viral<br>
infections, diabetes, multiple sclerosis.<br>
•	cancer.<br>
•	neurological diseases associated with intoxications (Cadmium poisoning, inhalation of n-<br>
hexane, pesticides, herbicides), associated with treatments (radiotherapy) or disorders of<br>
genetic origin (Wilson's disease).<br>
•	all the pathologies characterized by an excessive production or dysfunction of NO and/or<br>
ROS's.<br>
In all these pathologies, there is experimental evidence demonstrating the involvement of NO or ROS's (7. Med. Chem. (1995) 38, 4343-4362; Free Radic. Biol. Med. (1996) 20, 675-705; The Neuroscientist (1997) 3, 327-333).<br>
Furthermore, the inventors have already described NO Synthase inhibitors, their use in previous Patents (US Patent 5,081,148; US Patent 5,360,925) and more recently the combination of these inhibitors with products having antioxidant or antiradicular properties (an unpublished Patent Application).<br>
A subject of the present invention is new derivatives of 2-(iminomethyl)amino-phenyl, their preparation and their therapeutic use.<br>

In accordance with the invention, the compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared by the process below.<br><br><br>
Preparation of the compounds of general formula (I);<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) can be prepared starting from intermediates of general formula (II), (III) or (V) according to diagram 1. (Figure Removed)<br>
The reduction of the nitro function of the intermediates of general formula (II) is generally carried out by catalytic hydrogenation in ethanol, in the presence of Pd/C, except when the molecules contain an unsaturation or a sulphur atom, this being a poison to the Pd/C. In this case, the nitro group is selectively reduced, for example, by heating the product in solution in ethyl acetate with a little ethanol in the presence of SnCl2 (J. Heterocyclic Chem. (1987), 24, 927-930; Tetrahedron Letters (1984), 25, (8), 839-842) or by using Raney Ni with hydrazine hydrate added to it (Monatshefte fur Chemie, (1995), 126, 725-732).<br>
The aniline derivatives of general formula (III) thus obtained can be condensed on derivatives of general formula (IV), for example derivatives of O-alkyl thioimidate or S-alkyl thioimidate type, in order to produce final compounds of general formula (I) (cf. diagram 1). For example, for B = thiophene, the derivatives of general formula (III) can be condensed on S-methylethiophene thiocarboxamide hydriodide, prepared according to a method in the literature (Ann. Chim. (1962), 7, 303-337). Condensation can be carried out by heating in an alcohol (for example in methanol or isopropanol), optionally in the presence of DMF at a temperature comprised between 50 and 100°C for a duration generally comprised between a few hours and overnight.<br>
The final molecules of general formula (I) are also accessible through another synthetic route passing through the intermediates of general formula (V) which carry a heterocyclic amine function protected by a protective group " Gp ", for example a 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethoxymethyl group (SEM) or by another protective group mentioned in: Protective groups in organic synthesis, 2d ed., (John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc., 1991). The reduction and condensation stages which lead to intermediates (VI) and (VII) respectively are carried out under the same conditions as those described previously. The last stage of the synthesis consists in regenerating, for example in an acid medium or in the presence of a fluoride ion, the protected heterocyclic amine function.<br>
Alternatively, the intermediates of general formula (V) can be converted directly into the intermediate of general formula (II) by release of the heterocyclic amine by treatment, for example, in an acid medium or in the presence of a fluoride ion.<br>

The intermediates of general formula (XXV.7) thus obtained can be modified, diagram 13.2, by saponification followed by decarboxylation, for example thermic, in order to produce disubstituted heterocycles of general formula (XXV.9). Release of the amine from the side chain, as described previously, allows the intermediates of general formula (XXV) to be accessed.<br>

Alternatively, the carboxylic function of the heterocycles of general formula (XXV.7), can be reduced, for example by NaBH4, in order to produce alcoholic derivatives of general formula (XXV.10), diagram 13.3, which can be alkylated in the presence of Rj,-X and a base such as K2CO3 in a solvent such as acetonitrile or DMF. Release of the amine from the side chain, as described previously, allows the intermediates of general formula (XXV) to be accessed.<br>

The thiazoles of general formula (XXV), diagram 13.4, can also be prepared in 4 stages starting from commercial sarcosinamide hydrochloride. The amine is first protected in a standard fashion in the form of tBu carbamate and the carboxamide function is converted into thiocarboxamide in the presence of Lawesson reagent. The formation of the thiazole ring is carried out by the reaction of thiocarboxamide with the intermediate of general formula (XXV.l) according to an experimental protocol described in the literature (J. Org. Chem., (1995), 60, 5638-5642). The amine function is regenerated by treatment with the intermediate of general formula (XXV.12) in a strong acid medium such as, for example, trifluoroacetic acid. (Figure Removed)<br>

Synthesis of Intermediates (XXVIII):<br>
The isoxazolines and isoxazoles of general formula (XXVIII), Diagram 17. 1, are prepared by reaction of commercial aldehydes of general formula (XX) with hydroxylamine hydrochloride. The oxime of general formula (XXVIII.l) thus obtained is activated in the form of the oxime chloride, of general formula (XXVIII. 2), by reaction with N-chlorosuccinimide in DMF before reacting with the esters of general formula (XXVIII.3) in order to produce isoxazoline derivatives or with the esters of general formula (XXVIII.4) in order to produce isoxazole derivatives according to an experimental protocol described in the literature (Tetrahedron Lett., 1996, 37 (26), 4455; J. Med. Chem., 1997, 40, 50-60 and 2064-2084). Saponification of the isoxazolines or isoxazoles of general formula (XXVIII.5) is then carried out in a standard fashion under the conditions described previously.<br>
The unsaturated esters of general formula (XXVIII.3) and (XXVIII.4), which are not commercially available, can be prepared according to methods described in the literature (J. Med. Chem., 1987, 30, 193; J. Org. Chem., 1980, 45, 5017).<br>

The syntheses of intermediates of general formula (XXIX) are described in diagrams<br>

The intermediates of general formula (XXIX) can be prepared, diagram 18.1, starting from the intermediates of general formula (XXII.3), described previously, by treatment in a strong acid medium to regenerate the heterocyclic amine function. The selective reduction of the carboxylic function in the presence of, for example, sodium borohydride in a solvent such as, for example, anhydrous THF, allows the intermediate of general formula (XXIX) carrying a primary alcohol function to be obtained without touching the nitro group (Rao, A. V. R., J. Chem. Soc. Chem. Commun., 1992,11, 859).<br>

The intermediates of general formula (XXIX) can also be prepared, diagram 18.2, starting from intermediates of general formula (XXIX.l) (R or S) the preparation of which is similar to that of the compounds of general formula (XXII.1). Condensation of the alcoholic derivatives of general formula (XXII.2) on the intermediates of general formula (XXIX.l) is also described above. Release of the heterocyclic amine is carried out in the presence of an organic solution of a strong acid, for example, trifluoroacetic acid.<br>

The amines of general formula (XXIX), diagram 18.3, are also accessible starting from the substitution of tosylated derivatives of general formula (XXIX.l) by the commercial amines of general formula (XXX). Detachment of the carbamate function from the intermediates of general formula (XXIX.3) is carried out as described previously.<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Diagram 18.3<br>
The intermediates of general formula (XXIX) can also be prepared, diagram 18.4, by reaction of the halogenated derivatives of general formula (IX) with an alcohol of general formula (XXIX.4) in the presence of a base such as for example tBuO'K in an anhydrous solvent such as THF. The intermediate of general formula (XXIX.5) thus obtained is then deprotected in a strong acid medium (HC1 or TFA).<br>
(Figure Removed)<br>
Synthesis of intermediates (XXXII):<br>
The intermediates of general formula (XXXII) can be prepared, diagram 20.1, by reaction of the halogenated derivatives of general formula (IX) with commercial l-(diphenylmethyl)-3-hydroxyazetidine (XXXII. 1) in the presence of a base such as for example NaH in an anhydrous solvent such as THF. In this case, the nitro group of the intermediate of general formula (XXXII.2) is reduced in the presence of SnCl2, as described previously, in order to produce the intermediate of general formula (XXXII.3) the amine of which is then protected in the form of a tButyl carbamate. The detachment of the diphenylmethyl protective group is then carried out in a standard fashion by hydrogenolysis in the presence of Pd(OH)2 in order to produce the intermediate of general formula (XXXII).<br>

Pharmacological study of the products of the invention<br>
Study of the effects on neuronal constitutive NO synthase of a rat's cerebellum<br>
The inhibitory activity of the products of the invention is determined by measuring their<br>
o	o<br>
effects on the conversion by the NO synthase of the [ H]L-arginine into [ H]L-citrulline according to the modified method of Bredt and Snyder (Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, (1990) 87: 682-685). The cerebellums of Sprague-Dawley rats (300g - Charles River) are rapidly removed, dissected at 4°C and homogenized in a volume of extraction buffer (HEPES 50<br><br>
mM, EDTA 1 mM, pH 7.4, pepstatin A 10 mg/ml, leupeptin 10 mg/ml). The homogenates are then centrifuged at 21000 g for 15 min at 4°C. Dosage is carried out in glass test tubes in which 100 nl of incubation buffer containing 100 mM of HEPES (pH 7.4), 2 mM of EDTA, 2.5 mM of CaCl2, 2 mM of dithiotreitol, 2 mM of reduced NADPH and 10 u.g/ml of calmodulin are distributed. 25 |il of a solution containing 100 nM of [3H]L-arginine (Specific<br>
activity: 56.4 Ci/mmole, Amersham) and 40 ^iM of non-radioactive L-arginine is added. The reaction is initiated by adding 50 |il of homogenate, the final volume being 200 |il (the missing 25 |jl are either water or the tested product). After 15 min, the reaction is stopped with 2 ml of stopping buffer (20 mM of HEPES, pH 5.5, 2 mM of EDTA). After placing the samples on a 1 ml column of DOWEX resin, the radioactivity is quantified by a liquid scintillation spectrometer. The compounds of Examples 1, 6, 7 and 8 described above show an ICso lower than 3.5 u,M. As for the compound of Example 3, it shows an ICso lower than 5uM.<br>
Study of the effects on lipidic peroxidation of the cerebral cortex of a rat<br>
The inhibitory activity of the products of the invention is determined by measuring their effects on the degree of lipidic peroxidation, determined by the concentration of malondialdehyde (MDA). The MDA produced by peroxidation of unsaturated fatty acids is a good indication of lipidic peroxidation (H Esterbauer and KH Cheeseman, Meth. Enzymol. (1990) 186: 407-421). Male Sprague Dawley rats of 200 to 250 g (Charles River) were sacrificed by decapitation. The cerebral cortex is removed, then homogenized using a Thomas potter in a 20 mM Tris-HCl buffer, pH = 7.4. The homogenate was centrifuged twice at 50000 g for 10 minutes at 4°C. The pellet is maintained at -80°C. On the day of the experiment, the pellet is replaced in suspension at a concentration of 1 g/ 15 ml and centrifuged at 515 g for 10 minutes at 4° C. The supernatant is used immediately to determine the lipidic peroxidation. The homogenate of rat's cerebral cortex (500 p,l) is incubated at 37° C for 15 minutes in the presence of the compounds to be tested or of solvent (10 \il). The lipidic peroxidation reaction is initiated by adding 50 \\\ of FeCl2 at 1 mM, EDTA at 1 mM and ascorbic acid at 4 mM. After 30 minutes of incubation at 37°C, the reaction is stopped by adding 50 |il of a solution of hydroxylated di-tertio-butyl toluene (BHT, 0.2 %). The MDA is quantified using a colorimetric test, by reacting a chromogenic reagent (R), N-methyl-2-phenylindol (650 jil) with 200 u.1 of the homogenate for 1 hour at 45° C. The condensation of an MDA molecule with two molecules of reagent R produces a stable chromophore the maximum absorbence wavelength of which is equal to 586 nm. (Caldwell et al. European J. Pharmacol. (1995) 285, 203-206). The compounds of Examples 3, 1 1, 12, 13, 14 and 15 described above all show an IC5Q lower than 30<br><br><br><br><br>
