				<td>The present invention relates to a device adapter with a base element.<br>
Device Adapter<br>
The invention relates to a device adapter having a base element, which is provided on its underside with rail receptacles for attaching and making electrical contact with bus bars and supports on its top a attachment device, which is releasably fastened by means of connecting means and has two parallel, spaced apart longitudinal strips for the connection with electrical devices or installation units.<br>
A device adapter of this type ir. cited in D3 197 55 348 C2.  With this known device adapter, longitudinal strips have been placed on its top along the long edges of a housing-like base element and have been snapped together with the base element by means of resilient snap-in tongues formed along the long - edges, which, protrude downward at the sides.  In the snapped-in state, the snap-in tongues lie in recesses cut out of the walls at the long sides.  The longitudinal strips each have rows of holes oriented perpendicularly in respect to the top of the base element, by means of which devices can be connected, possibly by means of suitable fastening elements.  To remove the longitudinal strips, it is necessary to release the snap-in tongues from their engagement position, which is connected with corresponding difficulties . <br>
A device adapter with longitudinal strips fastened laterally alcng the long sides of a base element is also shown in DE 298 11 379 U1  A mounting element for connecting devices, which can be shifted in the linear direction, has been attached to the longitudinal strips, wherein the connection can also be releasable, but .wherein no detailed statements have been made in <br>
this respect.<br>
The object of the invention is based on making available a device adapter of the type mentioned at the outset which, along with a simple construction and simple handling, offers variable mounting possibilities.<br>
This object is attained by means of the characteristics of claim 1.  In this connection it has been provided that the connecting means are embodied as protruding hook-like suspension elements formed on the underside of the longitudinal strips, which can be vertically inserted into matched receiving openings on the top of the base element and can be suspended by displacing them in the longitudinal direction in the area behind the receiving openings on their side remote from the top, and that a releasabLe arresting element is provided for arresting the longitudinal strips in their suspended position.  By these means the longitudinal strips can be mounted in a simple way on the top of the base element and can also be released.<br>
Here, advantageous embodiment variations for production and handling reside in that the suspension elements have end sections projecting in the displacement direction, or that the suspension elements have widened end sections and the receiving openings are designed as keyhole-shaped openings oriented in the longitudinal direction.  The elongated strips are dependably secured by means of the arresting element.<br>
In this case those measures contribute to simple handling, wherein the arresting element is designed as a removable peg, which can be plugged or snapped in and can be placed from the top through a matched passage in the respective longitudinal strip into a matched arresting element receptacle, which is aligned in the suspended position, or that the arresting element is designed as a snap-in element formed on the longitudinal strip or the base<br><br>
element, which engages a counter-snap-in element on the base element or the longitudinal strip.<br>
If it is provided that the two longitudinal strips attached or to be attached to the lateral edge areas of the base element are connected with each other by means of two releasable transverse strips, it is possible to pre-assemble a unit consisting of the two longitudinal strips and the transverse strips and attach it to the base element in a simple manner.<br>
Simple manufacture and handling is aided in that the transverse strips have a cross section corresponding to that of the longitudinal strips and have holding legs on the underside of the two end sections, which protrude vertically downward.<br>
Those measures further contribute to simple and rigid mounting, wherein transverse pins, oriented to face each other in matched positions, are formed on the facing insides cf the longitudinal strips, and that the transverse strips have hollow spaces for inserting the transverse pins, at least in their end sections, which extend in their longitudinal direction, are open at the ends and are matched in their cross section to the cross section of the transverse pins.<br>
If it has been furthermore provided that in the attached state the two longitudinal strips project with end sections past the front of the base element and that a support means has been installed in the angular area between the front of the base element and the underside of the longitudinal strip, possibilities for mounting also result on the protruding portion of the longitudinal strips.  In this case stability is increased by the support means.<br>
A simple stable attachment with the help of the support means results in that, on its side facing the front of the base element, the support means is provided with a holding structure which, in the attached state of the longitudinal strips, is brought into engagement with a support means receptacle which is<br><br>
complementary to it.<br>
An advantageous embodiment for the manipulation of the device adapter furthermore consists in that in the installed state an end of a longitudinal strip terminates at a defined distance in front of the respective front side of the base element, and that a handle for operating a bolt of the device adapter is arranged in the space of the base element which is left open.<br>
Simple connecting of devices or installation units is furthered in that a set-up element for connecting devices or installation units is snapped in on the top of the two parallel, spaced apart longitudinal strips, which bridges the parallel distance, is displaceable in the linear direction along the longitudinal strips and can be fixed in a selectable position on the longitudinal sides by fastening means,<br>
The invention will be explained in greater detail in what follows by means of exemplary embodiments/ making reference to the drawings.  Shown are in:<br>
Fig. 1, a device adapter with an installed attachment device in a perspective plan view,<br>
Fig, 2, the device adapter in accordance with Fig. 1 with the attachment device removed, in a perspective plan view,<br>
Fig. 3, the attachment device represented in Figs. I and 2 in a perspective plan view,<br>
Fig. 4, the attachment device in accordance with Fig. 3 in an exploded perspective representation,<br>
Fig. 5, a lateral view of the device adapter in accordance with Fig. 1 with hook elements for attaching bus bars, and<br>
Fig. 6, the device adapter in accordance with Fig. 5 with the attachment device removed.<br>
Fig. 1 shows a device adapter 1 with a base element 10 and an attachment device 20 received thereon and having two longitudinal strips 21, 24, which are arranged parallel and<br><br>
spaced apart on the longitudinal edges of the base element 10, and transverse strips 25, 26 connecting them.  A set-up element 30 in the shape of a tophat rail, which bridges the distance between the two longitudinal strips, has been placed with its base on -he top of the longitudinal strips 21, 24 for the purpose of simple attachment of devices, or installation units, and is fixed in place on the longitudinal strips 21, 24 by fastening means 32 in the form of screws, as also shown in Figs. 2, 3, 5 and 6.  Before the set-up element 30 is fixed in its final position, it is fixed in place by means of downward protruding snap-in holding elements 31 on the longitudinal strips, and can be displaced into the desired position along the longitudinal strips 21, 24.  In this case a snap-in lever (not represented) with a snap-in protrusion engages longitudinally extending teeth with inclined and steep flanks, cut into the top of the base element 10, for the temporary arrestment in the displacement position.  By means of screws, which engage holes cut into the longitudinal strips 21, 24 perpendicularly in respect to the top of the attachment device 20, or the device adapter 1, an installation unit in the form of a, connecting unit 40 has been attached to a section on the top of the longitudinal strips 21, 24, which projects past the front of the substantially cube-shaped base element 10.  Here, the holes respectively form a row of holes of a defined pattern in the longitudinal strips 21, 24.<br>
As can be seen in Figs. 2, 3, 4 and 6 in particular, downward protruding connecting elements in the form of suspension elements 22 have been formed on the underside of the at-achrner device 20, specifically on the underside of the longitudinal strips 21, 24.  Receiving openings 23, matched to the largest cross section of the suspension elements 22 and whose number and position is matched to the suspension elements 22, have been cut intc the top of the base element 10 in the vicinity of the longitudinal edges.  Shoulders are arranged on the underside of<br><br>
the receiving openings 13, behind which the hook-like end sections of the suspension elements 22 extend in the installed state of the attachment device 20.  The depth of the receiving openings 13 down to the shoulders is matched to the clear width between the underside of the longitudinal strips 21, 24 and the top of the hook elements.  For the installation of the attachment device 20, the longitudinal strips 21 with the suspension elements 22 are inserted perpendicularly in respect to the top of the base element 10 into the receiving openings 13 and are subsequently displaced in the longitudinal direction of the base element 10, so that the hook element-s, which also project in the displacement direction, are brought into their holding position. In its holding position, the attachment device 20 is fixed in place against displacement by means of an arresting element 28 on one longitudinal strip 24 or, alternatively, or. both longitudinal strips 21, 24, by means of a peg-like arresting element 28, wherein the arresting element 28 is engaged, preferably in a snapped-irt manner, with a shaft portion a arresting element receptacle 19 cut at an appropriate position into the top of the base element 10.  To this end, and as can be seen in Fig. 4 in particular, a passage 24.3 which, in the suspended state of the attachment device 20, is aligned with the arresting element receptacle 19, has been cut into the respective longitudinal strip 24.  Bores 14 have been cut next to the receiving openings 13 into the top of the base element 10, with which either the longitudinal strips 21, 24 can be additionally fixed in place, or other attachment units can be directly fixed on the top of the base element 10,<br>
As Fig. 4 further shows, on their facing sides the longitudinal strips 21, 24 have been provided with transverse Dins 24.1r 24.2 which are located aligned opposite each other for the connection of transverse strips 25, 26.  For this purpose the transverse strips 25, 26, which advantageously have the same<br><br>
cross section as the longitudinal strips 21, 24, have been provided at least in their end sections with hollow spaces 25,2, 26,2, whose cross section has been matched to the cross section of the transverse pins 24.1, 24.2.  In this way it is possible to pre- assemble the attachment device 20 prior to its mounting on the base element 10 by a simple plug-in connection, because of which the application of the attachment device 20 to -he base element 10 can be provided in a simple manner.  On their underside, the transverse strips 25, 26 have been provided with holding legs 25.1, 26.1 formed on them which, for fixation on the base element 1C, can additionally be equipped with snap-in elements and cooperate with counter-holding elements of the base element 10.<br>
As can be furthermore seen from the drawing figures, a right-angled support element 27, triangular in lateral view, has been arranged in the angular area between the end sections of the longitudinal strips 21, 24 protruding past the respective front side of the base element 10 and the end wall 18 at the front end of the base element 10, which can be provided on its sice facing the end wall 18 with a holding structure 2~&gt; A in zhe form of a rib formed on it, which is T-shaped or dovetailed in cross section and engages a complementary holding receptacle 15 in the form of an undercut T-groove arranged on the front face of the base element 10.  In the course of assembly, advantageously the holding structure 27.1 of the support element 27 is first pushed into the holding receptacle 15, and the attachment device 20 is subsequently placed on top and hooked in place.  As shown for example in Fig. 2, the connecting unit 40 can also be connected with the support; element 27 by means of fastening screws through the longitudinal strips 21. 24,<br>
As Figs. 1 and 2 furthermore show, three rail receptacles 11 have been formed on the underside of the base element 10, in which bus bars extending transversely to the base element 10, or<br><br>
to the device adapter 1, can be received.  The rail receptacles are separated from each other by means of border walls 17 extending transversely to the base element 10.  For making contact with the bus bars, contact sections 60 for making electrical contact with the bus bars are arranged in the rail receptacles 11 on the underside of the base element 10.  For attaching the device adapter 1 to the bus bars, hook elements 55 can be fixed on the border  17, as shown in Fig. 5.  For locking the device adapter 1 attached to the bus bars, a stepped locking element 70, which can be pushed back into the base element 1Q against a spring force, has been provided in at least one rail receptacle 11, as shown in Fig. 6.  The locking element 70 can be unlocked by means of a handle 50 protruding from an end section on the top of the base element 10, so that the device adapter 1 can be removed from the bus bars.  For attachment to a mounting unit, the base element 10 has at least one hook-shaped holding nears 12 on the underside of one of its end sections.<br>
In order to operate the handle 50 for the locking element 70 in a simple manner, the one longitudinal strip 21 has been shortened at the appropriate end section, so that the handle 50 can be arranged without problems in this area and can be operated.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
