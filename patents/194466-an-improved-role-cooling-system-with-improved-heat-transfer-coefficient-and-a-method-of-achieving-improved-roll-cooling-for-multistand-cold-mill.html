				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved roll cooling system and an improved method of roll cooling for enhancing roll life by improved heat transfer for Multi-Stand cold Mill. To achieve desired shape of cold rolled (CR) Strips is of vital importance during cold rolling process at Multi-Stand Cold Mill (MCM). Due to increasing requirements on the geometric quality parameters like strip thickness, width, profile and flatness of CR Strips for superior strip profile and flatness for trouble free downstream processing such as cold rolling, coating and press forming. Modern Cold Mill uses technological control system to obtain close tolerances for thickness, width, profile and flatness for the strip body as well as for the entire length.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Achieving desired shape of cold rolled strips is of vital importance during cold rolling process at Multi-Stand Cold Mill (MCM). It is essential to analyse and correct any flatness deviation that might occur by uneven thermal gradient of work rolls (thermal crown). It is therefore imperative that efficient roll cooling and lubrication systems are essential to control the thermal crown and improve the overall performance of the mill. It is known to install the mill with roll bending controlled through water based hydraulics system. In the previous hydraulic system 5% hydraulic oil is fixed with 95% water in lieu of 100% hydraulic oil. The system is also coupled with auxiliary drives of the mill like transfer car, carriage, guides, etc. Due to the use of water in the system leads to frequent jamming hydraulic piston cylinder and leakage of hoses results to improper control of roll bending system.<br>
Initially the mill was designed with same amount of coolant flow to the work rolls and back-up rolls of the mill and also each stands (5-stands) was having equal amount of coolant flow distribution. Initially all the headers are fitted with screw-in type flat jet nozzle are having two zone control with 3 nozzles at the edge zone and 6 nozzles at the central zone catering half of the central portion of the roll<br><br>
barrel length. All the five stands were catered by 4 pumps running of flow rate 5300 Ipm @ 10 bar of each pump It was resulted with higher roll surface temperature with higher thermal camber during the rolling of thinner gauge (25 mm) steel strips.<br>
It is also known to provide modified roll coolant system by putting additional 4 pumps, out of which 5 pumps adapted to run and remaining pumps kept as spare and also changing of the roll cooling header configuration. All the headers were fitted with 16 Nos. screw in type flat jet nozzle per header for more coolant discharge to the roll to control thermal camber of roll. As a result, due to the increase in number of nozzles, the coolant discharge flooded the roll with reduced impinging coolant pressure and led to poor heat transfer effect of rolls and higher premature failure (spalling) of rolls. The screw-in type nozzles also did not ensure align coolant spray onto rolls.<br>
By way of extensive studies of conventional roll cooling system presently available<br>
following deficiencies of the existing system are identified :<br>
i)	Problems of uniform and equal coolant distribution system to each stand ;<br>
ii) Non-aligned coolant spray over rolls due to the use of screw-in nozzles; iii) Use of excess number of nozzles leading to flooding and wastage of<br>
coolant emulsion ; iv) Problems of equal coolant distribution for both back-up rolls and work rolls ; v) Poor heat transfer coefficient due to low coolant impinging force and<br>
pressure; vi) Higher roll surface temperature ;<br>
vii) Higher temperature difference between the centre and edge of rolls ; viii) Higher premature roll thermal failure.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is thus the basic object of the present invention to provide for an improved roll cooling system which would avoid the above discussed drawbacks/limitations of the known cooling systems presently available.<br>
%<br><br>
Another object of the present invention is directed to provide for an improved roil cooling system which would facilitate enhancing roll life especially for multi-stand cold mills.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is directed to providing for an improved roll cooling system which would achieve the following advantageous feature/characteristics :<br>
i) Achieving optimum impact density of the coolant spray-impingement onto the roll for maximised heat transfer effect.<br>
ii) Versatility of thermal control in relation to coolant quantity, flow and placement, to cater all present and future possible rolling conditions.<br>
iii) To achieve optimum Heat Transfer Coefficient (HTC) and reduce the roll surface temperature as well as premature roll thermal failure.<br>
iv) Optimum utilisation of coolant for effective roll cooling.<br>
Yet further object is directed to provide an improved method of roll cooling using the improved system of the present invention.<br>

The modified coolant system of the invention was developed incorporating the following features :<br>
a) Designing of modified coolant system for achieving higher HTC.<br>
b) Variable coolant flow distribution onto roll surface.<br>
c) Modified coolant application header configuration retrofitting to existing system and ease of maintainability.<br>
(i) Achieving maximum HTC : The important criterion for achieving maximum HTC are proper nozzle selection and the spray condition.<br>
Nozzle Selection : To maintain nearly constant HTC on the impact area (Fig. 1), the nozzle should be as large as possible and the coolant flow density at the impact area should be nearly constant. It has been identified that the flat jet nozzles are having maximum HTC as compared to square and oval nozzle (Fig. 3). The coolant flow density at the impact areas is achieved nearly equal to the<br>
5<br><br>
width of spray in flat jet compared to other nozzles (Fig. 2) and having maximum length-width ration for the impact area (15:1) in comparison to oval nozzle (5:1) and square nozzle (1:1). Thus flat jet nozzles were identified to be suitable for achieving maximum HTC with relatively low coolant pressure and has been selected for the modified roil coolant system.<br>
Spray Condition : Basically the spray condition depended upon three basic parameters like coolant pressure, spray angle and the spray height i.e. the distance between nozzle tip and roll surface.<br>
It has been observed that with increase in coolant pressure, there was increase in HTC upto a pressure limit 15 bar (Fig. 4) but in the modified system by reducing total number of nozzles, the coolant pressure has been increased from 2.1 bar to 4 2 bar, which clearly indicated the improved HTC with the modified coolant system. It has been also identified that lesser spray distance resulted in higher HTC (Fig. 5). There is a mere change in HTC, if the spray distance increases beyond 200 mm.<br>
In the modified system, the spray distance is restricted to 183 mm for top work roll cooling header and 152 mm for bottom work roll cooling header, due to space constraint.<br>
The distance of the coolant spray should be perpendicular to the roll surface. If the impinging spray angle (ß) is more than 15°, an increasing disturbance of the coolant flow at the impact area takes place, and hence cooling efficiency decreases (Fig. 6). In the modified system the impinging spray angle has been kept at 15° for top work roll (WR) compared to 18° earlier and 25° for bottom WR compared to 30° earlier (Figs. 7 &amp; 8).<br>
(ii) Coolant flow distribution : The volume of coolant used for roll cooling varies, depending on the type of mill. However, the pressure requirements are constant and generally ranged between 3 and 7 bar. This range is perfectly acceptable for the application of coolant in cold mills, with a recommended value of approximately 5 to 6 bar. As the volume and pressure of the coolant are directly related to the impact density of the spray and in turn to the heat transfer efficiency, a minimum of 3 bar is need to achieve any thermal response to the sprays.<br>
6<br><br>
However, the benefit of increased pressure decreases rapidly above 7 bar, thereby making its use unjustified.<br>
With regard to the general aspects of roll cooling, hot rolled strip entering for stand # 1 to stand # 5 in a 5-stand cold mill, the roll cooling pattern in each of stands #1 to #4 play a vital role for controlling the strip shape. Mostly, the coolant application are neglected at these stands, and very efficient roll cooling was carried out.<br>
By optimising the aspect of the rolling process, not only with the objective of improving product quality, but for achieving significant benefits, the coolant flow distribution is optimised stand-wise in accordance with stand speed, roll force and percentage reduction pattern. In the modified system design, coolant flow distribution was varied standwise with respect to mill speed and roil force. There is a gradual increment of flow from stand #1 to stand #5 (Figs. 7 &amp; 8).<br>
(iii) Roll coolant header configuration : As discussed above the sprays are selectively provided to impinge as precisely and accurately as possible onto the roll for maximised effectiveness, which directly depends on the positioning of the headers within the mill fixtures. This optimal location has to take into account existing mill furniture, movements of entry guides and bridles and access of services coolant piping, air and electrical hoses and ease of accessibility for maintenance. A considerable amount of effort is required to complete the flow calculations on the roll coolant system. Piping must be sized and routed so as to eliminate pressure losses. Spray headers must be chambered to accommodate these flow rates without restrictions. The spray headers are zoned into three zones - centre and edge. The number of nozzles at the centre zone is just double the number of nozzles at the edge zones to maintain balanced and uniform flow rate through each nozzles, as because the inlet connections to the centre zone and two edge zones are having equal branching pipe lines of 100 NB from main delivery pipe line of 200 NB from pump-set. Both the back-up and work roll spray headers (top and bottom) are having balanced and equal flow distribution and volume on each stands.<br>
In the modified roll coolant system, the roll coolant headers (Fig. 8) are arranged taking into following considerations :<br>
7<br><br>
i)	Header location at the mill housing<br>
ii)	Nozzle configuration for spray pattern<br>
iii)	Zonal cooling of rolls<br>
iv)	Retrofitting to existing system<br>
v)	Ease of maintenance.<br>
Roll coolant headers : The top work roll coolant headers are box-type and fitted on the hold down board at the entry side of stands with three zones - centre and edge. The spray height is maintained within 183 mm. The bottom work roll coolant headers are made up from 50 NB pipe with three zones for similar flow distribution like top work roll. These headers are of fixed type having spray height of 152 mm. All the back-up roll coolant headers are made up from 50 NB pipe with three zones and are fixed type. The spray is oriented towards the bite of work roll and back-up roll to facilitate lubricity at the bite and to take out the heat from rolls.<br>
All these roll coolant headers are provided with protection plates and bottom flushing port in each zones for ease of periodic maintenance and are made retrofitting to the previous coolant supply connections.<br>
Nozzle configuration : The spray nozzles are selected of dove-tail type flat jet nozzles. The dove-tail type ensures perfectly aligned spray pattern onto the roll surface and facilitates periodic cleaning of nozzles. The nozzles are fitted on a single row to the spray header with an off-set angle of 15° in order to avoid interference of the adjacent spray and to maintain perfectly aligned herringbone spray pattern for effective cooling of rolls. The spray angle of nozzle is maintained at 60° for work rolls and 90° for the back-up rolls for more spray width coverage and helped to reduce the number of nozzles and to provide more intense cooling i.e. high flow density to work rolls.<br>
In accordance with another aspect of the invention the variable flow distribution stand-wise are being introduced with the number of nozzles which in turn depend on the inter spacing of the nozzles per header. All the back-up roll coolant header are provided with eight numbers of nozzles with 4 nozzles at centre zone and 2 nozzles at each edge zones. For stand 1 &amp; 2, 12 number of nozzles are provided<br>
8<br><br>
 on the work roll coolant header with 6 nozzles at centre zone and 3 nozzles at edge zone. For stand 3, 16 number of nozzles are provided on the work roll coolant header with 8 nozzles at the centre zone and 4 nozzles at the edge zone. For stand 4 &amp; 5, 20 number of nozzles are provided on the work roll coolant header with 10 nozzles at the centre zone and 5 nozzles at the edge zone (Fig. 10). All the nozzles are fitted to the header with a minimum overlap of 40% to maximum 70% in order to avoid dry spot running of work rolls due to nozzle choking. All the nozzles are kept of same flow rate for ease maintenance and inventory.<br>

Tests were carried out to confirm the advantages in the modified roll coolant system (Fig. 8 &amp; 9) vis-a-vis conventional roll cooling system at stands units. The system performance for a period of 6 months was evaluated and following results had been achieved.<br>
In the modified design coolant flow distribution was redistributed stand-wise (Fig. 8) to achieve optimum heat transfer effect and to avoid flooding and wastage of coolant. First redistribution was carried out by reducing the coolant flow at back-up rolls and saved coolant was used for intensive cooling at work rolls as per Table-1 hereunder for achieving higher HTC.<br>

The maximum heat is being generated at the roll-bite due to cold reduction of strip and the deformation work i.e. friction. This generated heat is taken by strip, coolant and the major part by the work rolls, this gradual heat input to the work roils are to be efficiently taken out by the roll cooling system or other-wise the work roll will be subjected to premature thermal failure. A nominal part of heat is being conducted to the back-up rolls and the frictional effect between the back-up roll and work roll generates comparatively low heat input to the back-up rolls, therefore the cooling of back-up roll is not so vigorous as the work roll. If the work roll temperature is controlled effectively, it will help to reduce the heat flow to the back-up rolls, therefore in the modified coolant system, the coolant flow distribution for back-up rolls are reduced drastically (to nearly half) and the curtailed coolant flow was distributed to work rolls for intense cooling. The total coolant flow distribution for work rolls before the modification was 10813 Ipm and after redistribution the total flow was 14500 Ipm. Similarly the total coolant flow for BUR cooling was 12390 Ipm which was reduced to 7300 Ipm after modification (Table-1).<br>
In the original design the total number of nozzles fitted in all stands were 343 numbers (Table -1). The total flow rate of emulsion in all stands were 23203 Ipm and having low emulsion pressure of 2:1 bar due to higher number of nozzles with 4 nos. of pump running resulting to low impact force and low heat transfer effect from work rolls. In the modified design, the total number of nozzles were reduced from 343 to 240 to enhance the emulsion pressure, which increases the impact<br>
11<br><br>
force of spray to improve HTC. In the modified design the coolant pressure was achieved of 4.2 bar with the 4 pumps running.<br>
The modified roll coolant headers for BUR and work rolls are erected at all the five stands of the multi-stand unit as per new system of stage-wise as per Table -2 hereunder:<br>

The spray angle of nozzles for work roll cooling header was kept at 60° for higher impact force of the coolant. The nozzles are interspaced in such a manner such that the overlap of the two adjacent spray can have atleast more than 50% in order to avoid dry spot rolling due to nozzle choking. Whereas the nozzles for back-up roll cooling header was designed with higher spray angle of 90° for the use roll cooling with lesser number of nozzles and with an overlap of atleast 40% of spray width. The number of nozzles selected for each stand were selected with respect to stand-wise speed and roll force. This redistribution of coolant has also resulted to reduce the premature work roll thermal failure from 57 nos. to 27 nos. per annum. The effective modified roll cooling system also helped to reduce the finishing coil temperature from 130°C to 110°C (avg) and also reduced the specific roll consumption from 1.98 to 1.36 Kg/T and specific rolling oil consumption from 1.33 to 0.85 lit/T as per Table - 4 hereunder:<br>
