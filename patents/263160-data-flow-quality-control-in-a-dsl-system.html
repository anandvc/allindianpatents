				<td>DATA-FLOW QUALITY CONTROL IN A DSL SYSTEM<br>
The present invention relates to a method for data-flow quality control<br>
in a Digital Subscriber Line communications system as described in the preamble<br>
of claim 1, the related receiver as described in the preamble of claim 4 and the<br>
related transmitter as described in the preamble of claim 5.<br>
Such a method and related devices are already known in the art, e.g.<br>
from the section "AOC on-//'ne adaptation and reconfiguration", pages 119-123<br>
of ITU-T Recommendation G.992.1 with titJe "Asymmetric digital subscriber line<br>
(ADSL) transceivers" published in June 1999 by the international<br>
Telecommunications Union (ITU).<br>
Therein, it is described that the transmit power in a Digital Subscriber<br>
Line system, called an ADSL-system, is distributed over all data-carriers, called<br>
sub-carriers, resulting in a certain Power Spectral Density (PSD) value for each<br>
carrier. This transmit power is attenuated by the travelling along the channel and<br>
results in a certain, reduced, receive power at the receiver. Moreover, the<br>
channel also has the characteristic to add noise to the signal. From this<br>
attenuated signal together with the added noise a Signal to Noise Ratio can be<br>
determined. Based on this Signal to Noise Ratio, the number of bits that can be<br>
transmitted on each carrier while still guaranteeing a certain maximum error-rate<br>
can be determined. This number of bits then is transmitted on each data carrier<br>
by the transmitter once the transmitter is in showtime.<br>
As the channel characteristic due to certain conditions, such as new<br>
upcoming disturbers or weather conditions and noise changes in time, the Signal<br>
to Noise Ratio of the signal changes also. Hence, due to the changing channel<br>
characteristics and noise, the current Signal to Noise Ratio may differ from the<br>
Signal to Noise Ratio that is required to transmit the previously determined<br>
number of bits per carrier while still guaranteeing a certain data-flow quality for<br>
instance a certain maximum error-rate. In order to retune the Power Spectral<br>
Density value for each carrier to a new value that fits to the changed current<br>
channel characteristics and noise on the channel without interrupting the dataflow,<br>
to guarantee a stable communication, a bit swap is performed.<br>
Because of the fact that in ADSL version 1 as described in the above<br>
mentioned ITU-T Recommendation G.992.1, the bit swap mechanism is only<br>
able to change at most 4 (normal bit swap request) or 6 (extended bit swap<br>
request) tones every second, the modem can go out of showtime before having<br>
the time to perform all the necessary bit swaps if the noise conditions on the line<br>
are changing rapidly.<br>
Furthermore, in ADSL version 2 as described in ITU-T<br>
Recommendation G.992.2 the bit swap mechanism is bigger and may include<br>
all carriers in the bit swap, which constitutes an improvement compared to the<br>
ADSL version 1. In this case however, the bit swap request message to be<br>
transferred is large and if the noise on the line is high, the probability that the<br>
received bit swap request message is corrupt is still considerably present.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a data-flow quality<br>
control method, a transmitter and a receiver of the above known type for datasignal<br>
quality control but wherein the data-flow quality control is executed in such<br>
way that the stability of the modem increases significantly.<br>
According to the invention, this object is achieved by the data-flow<br>
control method as described in claim 1, the receiver as described in claim 2 and<br>
the transmitter as described in claim 3.<br>
Indeed, by requesting the transmitter, in case the data flow quality of<br>
the data-flow received by the receiver is unsatisfactorily low, to improve the data<br>
flow quality by decreasing the bit allocation with a same amount for a plurality of<br>
data-carriers and by subsequently in response to the requesting of the receiver,<br>
the transmitter decreasing the bit allocation accordingly the data-flow quality is<br>
improved.<br>
The data flow quality may be "unsatisfactorily low" if the signal-tonoise<br>
ratio for all data-carriers or for set of data-carriers is to low, if the noise for<br>
any or for all data-carriers is too high, if an error rate is too high (at Bit level:<br>
Forward error correcting codes can report if many bits are to be corrected or if<br>
uncorrectable errors are present at; at Frame level: Cyclic redundancy check<br>
(CRC) errors on data-path level Cell level: ATM cells CRC errors detected; at<br>
Packet level: TCP CRC errors; at Application level: video decoding errors, voice<br>
delay) or if a certain dataflow quality between a digital subscriber line operator<br>
and corresponding customer or user is unsatisfactorily low according to a preagreed<br>
contract .Hence by decreasing the number of bits carried on the carriers<br>
with a same amount for all data-carriers of the plurality of data-carriers, the bitrate<br>
is adapted in a quick way, without using any calculating or reallocation<br>
mechanism as applied in the bit swap, so that the noise margin over each of the<br>
data carriers of the plurality of data-carriers is now sufficiently high for<br>
guaranteeing a stable modem behaviour while carrying a reduced number of<br>
bits per carrier. In this way the noise margin improves to such an extent and<br>
within a very short time that the modem-stability increases significantly and that<br>
the transmission of data can be executed with a significant lower probability of<br>
corrupt frames compared to the existing bit swap-method. A very short time to<br>
increase the stability is due to the fact that for each carrier of the plurality of<br>
carriers the same action is to be performed without requiring calculations to<br>
determine the action for each carrier.<br>
Moreover due to the fact that for the plurality of carriers the decrease<br>
of bit allocation is done with a single amount, the request message is significant<br>
smaller than the bit swap- message leading to a higher probability of successful<br>
transmission of this message.<br>
Furthermore in our invention the overall bitrate is decreased by the bit<br>
allocation decrease without compensating this decrease by increasing the bit<br>
allocation for other data-carriers. No reallocation is performed in our present<br>
invention.<br>
An additional characteristic feature of the present invention is<br>
described in claim 2.<br>
The same amount for decreasing the allocation for all carriers of the<br>
plurality of carriers is a predetermined amount.<br>
An additional characteristic feature of the present invention is<br>
described in claim 3.<br>
The same amount for decreasing said bit allocation for all carriers of<br>
the plurality of carriers is determined based on the dataflow quality.<br>
An additional characteristic feature of the present invention is<br>
described in claim 6.<br>
By executing a bit swap on data-carriers for transporting a data-flow<br>
from the transmitter to the receiver after the decreasing of the bit allocation for a<br>
plurality of data-carriers, this bit swap is executed for fine-tuning the power<br>
spectral density resulting from the direct bit number decrease.<br>
An additional characteristic feature of the present invention is<br>
described in claim 7.<br>
The data-flow quality is a signal-to-noise ratio.<br>
It is to be noticed that the term 'comprising', used in the claims, should<br>
not be interpreted as being restricted to the means listed thereafter. Thus, the scope<br>
of the expression 'a device comprising means A and B' should not be limited to<br>
devices consisting only of components A and B. It means that with respect to the<br>
present invention, the only relevant components of the device are A and B.<br>
Similarly, it is to be noticed that the term 'coupled', also used in the<br>
claims, should not be interpreted as being restricted to direct connections only.<br>
Thus, the scope of the expression 'a device A coupled to a device B' should not be<br>
limited to devices or systems wherein an output of device A is directly connected to<br>
an input of device B. It means that there exists a path between an output of A and<br>
an input of B which may be a path including other devices or means.<br>
The above and other objects and features of the invention will become<br>
more apparent and the invention itself will be best understood by referring to the<br>
following description of an embodiment taken in conjunction with the<br>
accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
FIG. 1 represents a Digital Subscriber line communications system;<br>
FIG. 2 represents the functional representation of the transmitter DTE<br>
and the receiver ORE as presented in FIG. 1 ;<br>
In the following paragraphs, referring to the drawings, an<br>
implementation of the data-flow quality control method, a transmitter and a<br>
receiver according to the present invention will be described. In the first<br>
paragraph of this description the main elements of the Digital Subscriber Line<br>
system as presented in FIG. 1 are described. In the second paragraph, all<br>
connections between the before mentioned elements and described means are<br>
defined. Subsequently all relevant functional means of the transmitter and<br>
receiver as presented in FIG. 2 are described followed by a description of all<br>
interconnections. In the succeeding paragraph the actual execution of the data<br>
flow quality control method is described.<br>
The essential elements of the Digital Subscriber Line communications<br>
system network of the embodiment according to the present invention are a<br>
transmitter, in this embodiment chosen to be a user terminal and a receiver here<br>
chosen to be a central office coupling the transmitter to a communications<br>
network CNW which here is chosen to be the internet. The transmitter is able to<br>
send data towards the receiver by modulating this data on a plurality of carriers<br>
according any of the Digital Subscriber Line standards, further referred to as DSL,<br>
such as the Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) and the very high bit-rate<br>
Digital Subscriber Line (VDSL) standards.<br>
In order to keep simplicity in this description it is chosen to only<br>
describe one transmitter DTE and one receiver DRE although such a Digital<br>
Subscriber Line communications network usually comprises a plurality of<br>
transmitters and receivers.<br>
The transmitter DTE is coupled over a copper twisted pair, e.g. the<br>
commonly known POTS network to the receiver DRE.<br>
The receiver DRE first comprises a data receiving part DRP that is<br>
adapted to receive a data-flow transmitted by a DSL transmitter DTE where this<br>
data-flow said data-flow being modulated onto data carriers according to a bit<br>
allocation indicative for the number of bits to be modulated on each datacarrier.<br>
This modulation may be according to any of the DSL standards. The<br>
signal analysis part SAP that is able to analyse the quality of the received dataflow<br>
that is transmitted by the transmitter DTE. The receiver DRE further<br>
comprises a Request Establishing part REP that is adapted to formulate a request<br>
for the transmitter DTE to improve the quality of the data-flow in case the quality<br>
of the data-signal is unsatisfactorily low, i.e. the signal-to-noise ratio beneath a<br>
predefined level, the increase of the noise level or even a larger amount of FECerrors,<br>
frame CRC errors, ATM CRC errors, TCP CRC errors or application errors.<br>
In the present invention this Request Establishing part REP is adapted to formulate<br>
the request to improve the quality of the data-signal by decreasing the bit<br>
allocation for a plurality of data-carriers. The Request transmitting part RTF, that<br>
after formulating the request by the Request Establishing part REP is adapted to<br>
forward this request towards the transmitter DTE.<br>
The Request Establishing part REP is coupled with an input to an<br>
output of the signal analysis part SAP. The signal analysis part SAP is coupled<br>
with an input to an output of the Data receiving part DRP. The Request<br>
transmitting part RTP in its turn is coupled with an input to an output of the<br>
Request Establishing part REP and further has an output that is at the same time<br>
an output-terminal O2 of the receiver DRE. The Data receiving part DRP has an<br>
input that is at the same time an input-terminal I2 of the receiver DRE.<br>
The transmitter DTE first comprises a data sending part DSP that is<br>
adapted to send a data flow towards an DSL receiver where this data flow is<br>
modulated onto data carriers according to a bit allocation indicative for the<br>
number of bits to be modulated on each data-carrier. This modulation may be<br>
according any of the DSL standards, and further comprises a request reception<br>
part RRP that is adapted to receive from the receiver DRE a request to improve<br>
the quality of the data-flow. Additionally the transmitter DTE comprises a request<br>
interpreting part RIP that is able to interpret the request to improve the quality of<br>
the data-flow and determine which action is to be executed. The transmitter DTE<br>
further comprises a bit allocation decreasing part BAD? that is able to decrease<br>
the bit allocation for a plurality of the data carriers in response to a request to<br>
improve the quality of a data-flow. The transmitter DTE may additionally<br>
comprise a bit swap performing part SPP that is able to perform a bit swap on<br>
data-carriers for transporting a data-flow from the transmitter to the receiver DRE<br>
after the direct decrease of said number of bits carried by a plurality of the datacarriers.<br>
The data sending part DSP has an output that is at the same time an<br>
output-terminal O, of the transmitter DTE and has an input that is coupled to an<br>
output of the direct bit decreasing part DBDP. The data sending part DSP further<br>
has an input that is coupled to an output of the bit swap performing part SPP.<br>
The request interpreting part RIP is coupled with an input to an output of said<br>
request reception part RRP. The request reception part RRP has an input that is<br>
at the same time an input-terminal I-, of the transmitter DTE. The bit allocation<br>
decreasing part BADP further is coupled with an input to an output of the<br>
request interpreting part RIP.<br>
The additional bit swap performing part SPP is coupled with an input<br>
to an output of the request interpreting part RIP.<br>
In order to explain the present invention it is assumed that due to the<br>
additional noise and external conditions, such as an upcoming new disturber, the<br>
Signal-to-Noise Ratio has decreased to such an extent that an improvement of<br>
the quality of the data-signal, is necessary in order to guarantee that the errorrate<br>
of the data-transmission remains beneath a certain predetermined<br>
maximum level. Due to this decreased Signal-to-Noise ratio the noise margin is<br>
reduced which in turn leads to a higher error rate.<br>
Alternatively the unsatisfactorily low quality may be that the signal-tonoise<br>
ratio for all data-carriers or for set of data-carriers is too low, the noise for<br>
any or for all data-carriers is too high, if an error rate is too high (at Bit level:<br>
Forward error correcting codes can report if many bits are to be corrected or if<br>
uncorrectable errors are present at Frame level: Cyclic redundancy check (CRC)<br>
errors on data-path level Cell level: ATM cells CRC errors detected; at Packet<br>
level: TCP CRC errors; at Application level: video decoding errors, voice delay)<br>
or if a certain dataflow quality between a digital subscriber line operator and<br>
corresponding customer or user is unsatisfactorily low according to a pre-agreed<br>
contract.<br>
The signal analysis part SAP of the receiver DRE analyses the quality of<br>
the received data-flow that is transmitted by said transmitter DTE. This analysis<br>
may be done for instance by measuring a signal-to-noise ratio once per time<br>
interval. In case the quality of the data-signal is beneath a predefined level, i.e.<br>
a quality-level where beneath a maximum error rate in the data-transmission is<br>
not guaranteed, due to the resulting too small noise margin, the Request<br>
Establishing part REP will formulate a request for said transmitter to improve the<br>
data-flow in case the quality of the data-flow is unsatisfactorily low, i.e. the<br>
signal-to-noise ratio for all data-carriers or the signal-to-noise ratio of a set of<br>
data-carriers is beneath a predefined level. In the present invention this Request<br>
Establishing part REP will formulate the request to improve the quality of the<br>
data-signal by decreasing the bit allocation with a same number for a plurality of<br>
the data-carriers. The Request transmitting part RTP, after formulating the request<br>
by the Request Establishing part REP then transmits this request towards the<br>
transmitter DTE over the control path CP. The request reception part RRP<br>
receives the request to improve the quality of the data-flow from the receiver<br>
DRE. The interpreting part RIP subsequently will interpret the request to improve<br>
the quality of the data-flow and determine which action is to be executed. The bit<br>
allocation decreasing part BADP then decreases the bit allocation with this same<br>
number for this plurality of the data carriers in response to the request to improve<br>
the quality of the data-flow.<br>
This same amount for decreasing the allocation for all carriers of the<br>
plurality of carriers is for instance a predetermined amount or, alternatively, this<br>
same amount for decreasing the bit allocation for all carriers of the plurality of<br>
carriers is determined based on the dataflow quality as determined.<br>
This direct bit number decrease improves the noise margin to such an<br>
extent and within a very short time that the modem-stability increases significantly<br>
and that the transmission of data can be executed with a significant lower<br>
probability of corrupt frames compared to the existing bit swap-method.<br>
Then in order to fine-tune the data-signal with an overall direct bit<br>
number decrease, the bit swap performing part SPP performs after the direct bit<br>
number decrease a bit swap on the carriers for transporting a data-signal from<br>
said transmitter DTE to said receiver DRE.<br>
.It is to be noted that the bit allocation decrease over the plurality of<br>
the data-carriers may be a bit allocation decrease over all the data-carriers in<br>
order to realise a noise margin improvement over the entire spectrum of the<br>
signal, however this also may be a transmit power increase over a subset of<br>
data-carriers, where the subset consists of more than one data carrier, in order<br>
to improve the signal ratio improvement over a predetermined part of the entire<br>
spectrum of the signal.<br>
Bit swap messages are sent from receiver to transmitter to adapt the<br>
bit loading and/or the transmit energy of the carriers to the changing line<br>
conditions.<br>
The DSL receiver may further comprise a bit swap initiating part SIP<br>
that is adapted to formulate, based on criteria such as the Signal-to Noise Ratio,<br>
a request to perform a bit swap on carriers for transporting a data-signal from<br>
the transmitter DTE to the receiver DRE and the DSL receiver additionally<br>
comprises a bit swap request transmitting part STP that is adapted to transmit a<br>
request to perform a bit swap on carriers for transporting a data-signal from the<br>
transmitter DTE to the receiver DRE.<br>
It is further also to be noted that although only one direction of data<br>
transmission is described together with the mechanism of the present invention<br>
for that direction, the present invention is also applicable for data transmission in<br>
the other direction.<br>
Furthermore it is to be noted that in our invention the overall bitrate is<br>
decreased by the bit allocation decrease without compensating this decrease by<br>
increasing the bit allocation for other data-carriers. No reallocation is performed<br>
in our present invention. A final remark is that embodiments of the present<br>
invention are described above in terms of functional blocks. From the functional<br>
description of these blocks, given above, it will be apparent for a person skilled<br>
in the art of designing electronic devices how embodiments of these blocks can<br>
be manufactured with well-known electronic components. A detailed architecture<br>
of the contents of the functional blocks hence is not given.<br>
While the principles of the invention have been described above in connection<br>
with specific apparatus, it is to be clearly understood that this description is made<br>
only by way of example and not as a limitation on the scope of the invention, as<br>
defined in the appended claims.<br><br><br><br>
