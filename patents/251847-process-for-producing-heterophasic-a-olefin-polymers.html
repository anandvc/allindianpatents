				<td>Process for producing heterophasic α-olefin polymers<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing heterophasic poly-α-olefin<br>
compositions and especially heterophasic copolymer compositions of propylene<br>
having uniform quality with desired properties, and being suitable for a wide range of<br>
applications.<br>
It is known that polypropylene polymers in particular have suitable resistance to heat<br>
and chemicals as well as have attractive mechanical properties. Further, it is known<br>
that desired properties, e.g. stiffness and impact strength properties of polypropylene<br>
can be achieved by copolymerizing propylene with ethylene or other α-olefin<br>
monomers and optionally by adding elastomeric components to the copolymer matrix.<br>
Polypropylene copolymers can thus be used as alternatives e.g. for poly(vinylchloride)<br>
(PVC). Further, polypropylene polymers are very suitable in wide range of<br>
applications.<br>
The term heterophasic copolymers of propylene is understood to include<br>
polypropylene copolymers consisting of different polymer types and may contain<br>
ethylene and/or higher α-olefins as comonomers. A heterophasic polymer generally<br>
comprises a propylene matrix part and a propylene rubber part comprising<br>
propylene/ethylene and/or a higher α-olefin copolymer. The rubber part may be called<br>
e.g. propylene-ethylene rubber or sometimes an elastomeric part of the polymer.<br>
Propylene copolymer compositions, and now also propylene heterophasic<br>
compositions, are generally prepared in a multistage polymerization process<br>
comprising one or more slurry and/or one or more gas phase reactors in the presence<br>
of a high activity, supported, Ziegler Natta catalyst system comprising a catalyst<br>
component containing a compound of a transition metal belonging to groups 4 to 6 of<br>
the Periodic Table of Elements (IUPAC 1990), and a cocatalyst compound based on an<br><br>
organic compound of a metal belonging to any of groups 1 to 3 and 13 of said Table.<br>
Typical compounds of transition metals are the chlorides, especially the tetrachlorides<br>
of titanium. Typical organometallic cocatalysts are organoaluminium compounds such<br>
as aluminium alkyl compounds and especially trialkyl aluminiums. In addition the<br>
catalyst system comprises internal and external electron donors. The external donors<br>
act as stereoregulating agents. Typical internal electron donors are dialkyl phthalates<br>
and typical external electron donors are alkyl alkoxy silanes.<br>
The Ziegler Natta catalysts commonly used are supported on an external support or<br>
carrier. Typical supports are magnesium dichloride and silica.<br>
Before use in the actual polymerization step the catalysts may be prepolymerized. The<br>
catalysts may also be modified, e.g. by using vinyl compounds.<br>
According to common knowledge, the catalyst components are supported on an<br>
external support or carrier in order to provide solid, high activity catalyst<br>
compositions. Because the catalyst component is supported on the surface of the<br>
carrier, it is advantageous for the carrier or support to be very porous and thus have a<br>
large surface area so that the final catalyst particles contain as many active sites as<br>
possible. If this is not the case, the activity of the catalyst is poor.<br>
Heterophasic propylene copolymers are produced in a multiphase polymerization<br>
process comprising at least two polymerization stages. Polymer matrix is prepared in<br>
the first stage of the polymerization process. The first stage can comprise at least one<br>
solution/liquid/slurry phase reactor and/or at least one gas phase reactor(s) or<br>
combinations thereof. Very often the first stage comprises one slurry and one gas<br>
phase reactor. Slurry reactors can be e.g. bulk reactors. Advanced heterophasic<br>
copolymers can be obtained, if one or more additional gas phase reactors, which are<br>
often referred to as rubber phase reactors, are used, combined in series with the first<br>
stage reactor(s). Copolymerizing of ethylene and/or other higher α-olefins, and<br><br>
propylene in the presence of the polymer matrix from the first stage is carried out in<br>
the rubber phase reactor(s), which step forms the se cond stage of the polymerization<br>
process. Examples of heterophasic propylene compounds and processes for producing<br>
them are disclosed in EP 991 719 and EP 459 277.<br>
It has hitherto been thought that catalysts with a porous structure, i.e. catalysts<br>
supported on an external porous carrier, are necessary and advantageous for producing<br>
heterophasic propylene copolymers. This is due to the replica effect, which means that<br>
porous catalyst particles produce porous polymer particles. In producing heterophasic<br>
polymers according to the prior art technique, it is important that the polymer matrix<br>
particles have a porous structure (which is obtained by using porous catalysts),<br>
because the rubber is formed or penetrates into the pores of the polymer matrix<br>
particles. Thus, in order to be able to produce a heterophasic polymer, i.e. polymer<br>
with rubber part, pores are needed.<br>
However, the porous structure of the catalyst and the matrix polymer particles means<br>
that the particles are not uniform, and this often leads to a breakdown of some of the<br>
bigger particles and thus to the formation of fines. Very small catalyst fragments can<br>
act as "hot catalyst particles" causing problems in the process by increasing the<br>
amount of rubbery and sticky material formation. In addition, by using the commercial<br>
supported, porous catalyst, it has been noted that if the amount of ethylene in the<br>
rubber phase is increased, stickiness problems tend to increase.<br>
It occurs, when product from the first reactor is transferred forward e.g. to the flash<br>
tank and/or to the gas phase reactor for further polymerizing or, in the rubber reactor<br>
itself or when transferring the polymer powder from the rubber reactor in pipelines to<br>
silos. The polymer product to be transferred can be "tacky" or "sticky" and adheres to<br>
the walls of the reactor and other surfaces in the flash tanks, reactors and pipelines.<br>
Stickiness causes problems to the process operability and also the polymer products.<br>
However, the possibility to vary the ethylene comonomer content in the polymer<br><br>
allows a wide range of modifications, whereby avoiding or decreasing the stickiness<br>
problems is very desired. A reduction in stickiness problems has been attempted by<br>
adding some additives, e.g. antistatic agents into the process. However, this is thought<br>
to cause some new problems.<br>
As discussed above, it has, until now, been thought necessary to use a porous catalyst<br>
in the process for producing heterophase polypropylene. This is also discussed, for<br>
example, in Macromol. chem. phys. 2001, 202, 1987-1994. However, due to the<br>
replica effect, there is a clear correlation between the porosity of the catalyst and the<br>
effectiveness of the process. Because a porous catalyst has a low bulk density, the<br>
polymer produced has a low bulk density as well. Further, a polymer with a low bulk<br>
density produced in slurry reactor correlates with the slurry density (solids<br>
concentration) of the slurry reactor, and this again effects the through-put of the<br>
process, i.e. a high bulk density catalyst is required, if a high bulk density of polymer<br>
is desired. Accordingly, the prior art catalysts used for producing heterophasic<br>
polymers, as noted above, had a high porosity and low bulk density, which caused a<br>
reduction in the bulk density of the polymer.<br>
The solid, non-supported catalyst used in the present invention has a high bulk density,<br>
as well as high activity. It has now surprisingly, and contrary to all prior art<br>
knowledge, been found that this kind of catalyst can effectively be used in producing<br>
heterophasic propylene copolymer compositions. The polymer produced has many<br>
desired properties, including high bulk density and desired rubber content. It is also<br>
possible to produce polymers with a relatively high rubber content. From a processing<br>
point of view, production can be run effectively and many of the problems of the<br>
processes of the prior art can be avoided or overcome.<br>
In US 6689846 is stated fouling to occur in gas phase reactors due to fines, i.e.very<br>
small particles containing active catalyst, which result in a tacky product and<br>
especially the fouling caused by the rubber fines in the rubber phase reactor. The<br><br>
solution provided therein to overcome fouling is to reduce static electricity and catalyst<br>
activity by using a combination of antistatic agent and catalyst killer as the antifouling<br>
agent. There is no discussion of the effect of the catalyst morphology on the stickiness<br>
or the production of heterophasic PP.<br>
WO 03/00755 of Borealis discloses the "non-porous" catalyst disclosed therein has the<br>
same or even higher catalytic activity than porous systems of the prior art.<br>
Accordingly, due to the long life of the catalyst, the catalyst is also very suitable for<br>
heterophasic polymerization. The document has no discussion of the effect of the<br>
catalyst morphology on the production of heterophasic PP.<br>
In addition to the finding that the "non-porous" catalyst has a long life enabling<br>
polymerization of the rubber, it has surprisingly found that non-porous catalyst of the<br>
invention can be used to produce rubber part in amounts which correspond to the<br>
porous catalyst conventionally used in the prior art. Moreover, when using the non-<br>
porous catalyst, even higher rubber levels can be incorporated over the prior art. This<br>
is unexpected, since the prior art has indicated that high porosity is needed in order to<br>
produce rubber.<br>
It is believed that most of the benefits of the present invention are based on the<br>
phenomena that the active material is distributed evenly through the whole catalyst<br>
particles and not only on the surface of the pores of the support material as is the<br>
situation with current commercial supported catalysts.<br>
From the processing point of view, the bulk density, which correlates to the slurry<br>
density in the first reactor, is high, leading to a higher through-put, i.e. a commercially<br>
effective process. By high "slurry density" we mean that the solid content in the<br>
reactor is high. This correlation will be discussed in more detail later in this<br>
application.<br><br>
In addition to the benefits of the bulk density, there are less stickiness problems, even<br>
where the polymerized copolymer has a high rubber content.<br>
It is an aim of the present invention to provide a novel process for preparing<br>
heterophasic α-olefin polymers, especially propylene copolymers, in at least two<br>
polymerization stages, the process comprising a first stage for forming a polymer<br>
matrix comprising a homopolymer, especially homopropylene or propylene polymer<br>
with a small amount of higher α-olefins, such as C4-C12 olefins, preferably C4-C8 a-<br>
olefins, and more preferably 1-butene, 1-pentene or 1-hexene in slurry and/or<br>
optionally in gas phase reactor(s), and additional stages for producing<br>
propylene/ethylene/optionally other α-olefin rubber in the presence of the polymer<br>
matrix from the first stage in additional gas phase reactor(s), i.e. rubber phase<br>
reactor(s) to form heterophasic propylene copolymers.<br>
A further aim of the invention is to provide a novel process for preparing heterophasic<br>
propylene copolymers using the above multistage process, which is easy to run<br>
continuously with less stickiness-problems and less uneconomical and troublesome<br>
cleaning breaks.<br>
Still a further aim is to provide a novel process for producing heterophasic propylene<br>
copolymers, which process can be run with a higher slurry phase density and thus a<br>
higher through-put. Hence, the present invention provides a more effective and thus a<br>
more economical process.<br>
Still yet another object of the present invention is to provide a heterophasic propylene<br>
polymer composition having a high rubber content. A high rubber content is<br>
understood to mean a rubber content greater than 20 wt% and up to 50 wt%.<br>
Still yet another aim of the invention is to provide a novel process for producing<br>
heterophasic propylene copolymers having uniform quality and desired properties.<br><br>
Especially essential is that a desired balance between stiffness and impact properties<br>
can be achieved by the process of the present invention.<br>
According to the present invention, there is provided a process for the production of<br>
heterophasic polyolefin compositions comprising the steps of<br>
-	in a first stage, forming a propylene polymer matrix in at least one slurry<br>
reactor and optionally in at least one gas phase reactor;<br>
-	in a second stage, copolymerizing propylene with ethylene and/or with another<br>
α-olefin in the presence of the polymer matrix in at least one gas phase reactor;<br>
characterised in that:<br>
-	the polymerization is carried out in the presence of solid, non-porous catalyst<br>
with a surface area of less than 15 m /g, the catalyst component comprising a<br>
compound of a transition metal of Group 3 to 10 of the Periodic Table, or<br>
actinide or lanthanide obtainable by a method comprising the steps:<br>
a)	forming a liquid/liquid emulsion system, which contains a<br>
homogenous solution of at least one catalyst component, said solution<br>
being dispersed in a solvent immiscible therewith and forming the<br>
dispersed phase of the liquid/liquid emulsion system;<br>
b)	solidifying said dispersed droplets to form solid catalyst particles<br>
having a predetermined size range; and<br>
c)	removing the solvent from the reaction mixture in order to obtain said<br>
solid catalyst particles<br>
and, optionally, one or more additional cocatalysts, and external donors;<br>
and wherein the polymer produced in said slurry reactor has a bulk density of at<br>
least 480 kg/m3.<br>
In accordance with the present invention heterophasic α-olefins especially propylene<br>
polymers are produced in an at least two stage polymerization process, wherein the<br>
first stage comprises the forming of the α-olefin polymer, preferably propylene matrix<br><br>
in at least one slurry reactor and optionally in at least one gas phase reactor; and the<br>
second stage comprises copolymerization of α-olefin, preferably propylene, with<br>
ethylene and/or other higher α-olefin in the presence of said polymer matrix of the first<br>
stage in at least one gas phase reactor acting as a rubber phase reactor. Preferably in<br>
the second stage propylene is copolymerized with ethylene.<br>
The catalyst system used in the process of the present invention is a high activity,<br>
stereoselective Ziegler-Natta type polymerization catalyst system comprising a solid,<br>
catalyst component, cocatalyst and external donor. However, no external support or<br>
carrier is used.<br>
Hydrogen can be added both to the bulk and gas phase reactors for controlling the<br>
molar mass of the polymer per se.<br>
The catalysts used and their preparation is described in WO publications 03/000754<br>
and 03/000755. The catalyst particles prepared have excellent morphology and good,<br>
uniform particle size distribution and due to the replica effect the polymer particles<br>
produced by using this catalyst have very good morphology properties, too.<br>
Further, as discussed above, the catalyst used in the present invention, has a non-<br>
porous structure with a very low surface area, which makes it surprising that it is so<br>
well suitable for producing heterophasic propylene copolymers.<br>
As disclosed above, the olefin polymerization catalyst component used in the present<br>
invention, comprises a compound of a transition metal of Group 3 to 10 of the Periodic<br>
Table (TUPAC), or of an actinide or lanthanide, and is prepared according to a method<br>
comprising<br>

solution of at least one catalyst component, said solution being dispersed in a<br><br>
solvent immiscible therewith and forming the dispersed phase of the<br>
liquid/liquid emulsion system,<br>

compound(s) and a cocatalyst(s). Thus the catalyst may be formed in situ from the<br>
catalyst components in said solution in a manner known in the art.<br>
A preferred process for producing an ZN olefin polymerization catalyst component in<br>

monohydric alcohols may be unsaturated, as long as they do not act as catalyst<br>
poisons.<br><br>
Preferable monohydric alcohols are those of formula R'OH in which R' is a C2-C16<br>
alkyl group, most preferably a C4-C12 alkyl group, particularly 2-ethyl-1-hexanol.<br>
Preferably, essentially all of the aromatic carboxylic acid ester is a reaction product of<br>
a carboxylic acid halide, preferably a dicarboxylic acid dihalide, more preferably an<br>
unsaturated α,β-dicarboxylic acid halide, most preferably phthalic acid dichloride, with<br>
the monohydric alcohol.<br>
The finally obtained catalyst component is desirably in the form of particles having an<br>
average size range of 5 to 200 µm, preferably 10 to 100, more preferably 15 to 50 µm.<br>
The catalyst particles are non-porous, i.e. their surface area is very small compared to<br>
prior art ZN catalysts supported on an external donor. The surface area of the catalyst<br>
used in the present invention is smaller than 15 m /g, preferable less than 10 m /g, and<br>
more preferably less than 5 m /g. The surface area is so small that it is generally not<br>
measurable by normal measurement apparatus, where the lowest measuring limit is<br>
5 m /g. This applies also to the porosity. The commercial supported catalysts normally<br>
used in the art have a surface area generally higher than 200 m /g, or even higher than<br>
300 m /g, i.e. in a totally different range. The active components of the catalysts are<br>
evenly distributed thorough the whole catalyst particles, whereas in the supported<br>
catalysts the active sites are situated only on the surface of the particles, wherefore a<br>
porous structure is needed to get activity for the catalyst.<br>
The catalyst system used in the present invention comprises a catalyst component<br>
prepared as aforesaid, in association with an alkyl aluminium cocatalyst and external<br>
donors, and is used for the polymerization of propylene optionally with other<br>
monomers, such as C2 to C12-olefms.<br>
In accordance with the present invention, the polymer matrix of the first stage<br>
preferably comprises propylene homopolymer. However, a propylene random<br>
copolymer matrix with a small amount of higher α-olefin comonomer, i.e. C4-C12,<br><br>
preferably C4-C8 α-olefin, is also possible. The amount of these comonomers is no<br>
more than 5 wt%, preferably no more than 2 wt%.<br>
In the second stage the rubber part of the polymer is formed in the presence of the<br>
polymer matrix from the first stage by polymerizing propylene with ethylene and/or<br>
another higher α-olefin. Preferably ethylene is used as comonomer.<br>
The amount of matrix component is preferably at least 50 wt%, more preferably at<br>
least 55 wt%. The upper limit may be up to 95 wt%. In some embodiments preferable<br>
ranges for the matrix component are 60 to 95 wt%, e.g. 70 to 95%, such as 80 to 90<br>
wt%. In an equally alternative embodiment the amount of the matrix component in the<br>
heterophasic polymer is 60 to 90 wt% or 60 to 80 wt%, in case higher amounts of<br>
rubber part are desired.<br>
The amount of the stage 2 polymer, i.e. the rubber part, may be up to 50 wt%, more<br>
preferably up to 45 wt%. The lower limit may be e.g. at least 5 wt%. Preferable ranges<br>
of the rubber component in some embodiments are e.g. 5 to 40 wt%, e.g. 5 to 30 wt%,<br>
such as 10 to 20 wt%. Furthermore, in a further alternative embodiments 10 to<br>
40 wt% , or even 20 to 40 wt% of rubber may be desired.<br>
It is evident that the amount of the matrix and thus the rubber part may vary<br>
considerably depending on the desired end use application.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the amount of matrix component in the heterophasic<br>
polymers of the present invention is between 50 to 95%, preferably 55 to 90%, more<br>
preferably 60 to 80% by weight of the heterophasic polymer. The amount of stage 2<br>
polymer may be in a range of 5 to 50%, preferably 10 to 45% by weight, more<br>
preferably 20 to 40 % by weight of the heterophasic polymer.<br><br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, the amount of ethylene in the rubber<br>
component is 15 to 70 wt-%, preferably 25 to 60 wt%, more preferably 30 to 50 wt%.<br>
Instrinsic viscosity (IV) of the rubber part may be 1 -6 dl/g, preferably 2-4 dl/g.<br>
As discussed above, the process of the invention is carried out in at least two stages.<br>
The first stage may comprise at least one slurry reactor, preferably a loop reactor, and<br>
optionally at least one gas phase reactor, preferably one gas phase reactor. The slurry<br>
reactor may be a bulk reactor, where the reaction medium is propylene. The second<br>
stage comprises at least one gas phase reactor, which is usually and also in this<br>
application called a rubber phase reactor.<br>
It is also possible that the first stage comprises only a bulk reactor, where the polymer<br>
matrix is formed, and the first gas phase reactor acts as a rubber phase reactor (the<br>
second stage). However, it is more usual, that the first stage comprises one bulk and<br>
one gas phase reactor. The polymer matrix is preferably formed from propylene<br>
homopolymers and the rubber phase comprises a copolymer of propylene with<br>
ethylene.<br>
As noted earlier in this application, the bulk density of the catalyst correlates with that<br>
of the polymer produced in the slurry phase, and further with the slurry density of the<br>
slurry reactor. It is well-known to anyone skilled in the art that the production capacity<br>
in the slurry reactor, e.g. loop reactor, increases as the solids concentration in the loop<br>
reactor is increased. But, for obvious reasons there is a limit to the highest amount of<br>
the solids concentration. If the process is run at too high a solids concentration<br>
(volume of polymer per volume liquid + polymer), the mixture cannot be pumped or<br>
removed, resulting in plugging of the loop. The production capacity in the loop can be<br>
increased if the density of the single polymer particles, which correlates with the bulk<br>
density of the polymer powder, is increased. The higher the density of the single<br>
polymer particles the higher the solids concentration, expressed as weight of polymer<br><br>
per weight of solid + polymer. A higher solids concentration means longer residence<br>
time in the loop and of course a higher production capacity.<br>
According to the the present invention, the bulk density of the polymers of the slurry<br>
reactor may be 480 to 560 kg/m3, preferably 490 to 540 kg/m3, and more preferably<br>
500 to 530 kg/m3.<br>
The principle of the correlation between polymer bulk density in the slurry reactor and<br>
solids concentration is shown in Figure 3.<br>
According to one embodiment of the invention the polymerization conditions for the<br>
slurry reactor of the first stage may be as follows:<br>
- the temperature is within the range of 40°C to 110°C, preferably between 60°C<br>
and 90°C,<br>
- the pressure is within the range of 20 bar to 80 bar, preferably between 30 bar to<br>
60 bar,<br>
- hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a manner known per<br>
se.<br>
The reaction mixture from the slurry (bulk) reactor is transferred to the gas phase<br>
reactor of the first stage polymerization. The polymerization conditions in the gas<br>
phase reactor may be as follows:<br>
- the temperature is within the range of 50°C to 130°C, preferably between 60°C<br>
and 100°C.<br>
- the pressure is within the range of 5 bar to 50 bar, preferably between 15 bar to<br>
35 bar, and in certain applications 25 bar to 35 bar may be used,<br>
- hydrogen can be added for controlling the molar mass in a mariner known per<br>
se.<br><br>
The polymerization conditions in the rubber gas phase reactor (the second stage) can<br>
be the same as in the gas phase reactor of the first stage.<br>
The melt flow rates, MFR, corresponding to the molecular weights of the polymer, can<br>
vary in wide ranges depending e.g. on the comonomer contents in the polymer. MFRs<br>
of the propylene polymers are measured according to ISO 1133 standard method and<br>
at 230°C, with 2,16 kg load (MFR2). The polymer composition prepared according to<br>
the present process can have a MFR2 in the range of 0.03 to 2000 g/min, preferably<br>
0.03 to 1000 g/10 min, most preferably 0.2 to 400 g/10 min.<br>
The present invention will now be described by way of example and with reference to:<br>
Figure 1 which is a plot showing ethylene distribution across a single particle in<br>
Example 8;<br>
Figure 2 which shows the eight analysis points in a slice of a single particle, the results<br>
of the analysis being disclosed in Figure 1.<br>
Figure 3 which shows the correlation between the bulk density of the polymer and the<br>
solid concentration of the slurry reactor. In the calculations underlying this figure the<br>
solid concentration, expressed as volume polymer per volume liquid + polymer, is<br>
fixed at 40%. The volume of the polymer in the calculation is based on the diameter of<br>
the particles. The only parameter that changes is density of the single polymer<br>
particles, which is expressed as bulk density in the figure; and<br>

Example 1<br>
All raw materials were essentially free from water and air and all material additions to<br>
the reactor and the different steps were done under inert conditions in nitrogen<br>
atmosphere. The water content in propylene was less than 5 ppm.<br>
The catalyst used in this example is a highly active and stereospecific Ziegler Natta<br>
catalyst (ZN catalyst). The ZN catalyst was prepared according to patent<br>
WO03/000754, Example 8, and had Ti content 2,52 w-%. The surface area of the<br><br>
catalyst was 
measurement limit, porosity was so low that it was not measurable.<br>
The polymerization was done in a 5 liter reactor, which was heated, vacuumed and<br>
purged with nitrogen before taken into use. 314 µl TEA (tri ethyl Aluminium, from<br>
Witco used as received), 46 µl donor C (cyclo hexyl methyl dimethoxy silane from<br>
Wacker, dried with molecular sieves) and 30 ml pentane (dried with molecular sieves<br>
and purged with nitrogen) were mixed and allowed to react for 5 minutes. Half of the<br>
mixture was added to the reactor and the other half was mixed with 17,2 mg ZN<br>
catalyst. After about 10 minutes was the ZN catalyst/TEA/donor D/pentane mixture<br>
added to the reactor. The Al/TI molar ratio was 250 and the AI/Do (cocatalyst/donor)<br>
molar ratio was 10. 70 mmol hydrogen and 1400 g were added to the reactor. The<br>
temperature was increased from room temperature to 70°C during 20 minutes. The<br>
reaction was stopped, after 60 minutes at 70°C, by flashing out unreacted propylene.<br>
Finally the polymer powder was taken out from the reactor and analysed and tested.<br>
The MFR of the product was 4,8 and bulk density 500 kg/m3. The details and results<br>
are seen in Table 1.<br>
Example 2<br>
This example was done in accordance with Example 1, with the difference that a<br>
different catalyst lot was used. The Ti content in the catalyst was 2,96 w-%. The<br>
surface are of the catalyst was 
The MFR of the product was 4,7 g/10 min and bulk density 510 kg/m3. The surface<br>
area of the polymer powder was 
 <br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
This example was prepared in accordance with Example 1, with the exception that a<br>
supported porous catalyst was used. The catalyst used was a typical porous 4th<br>
generation, transesterified Ziegler Natta catalyst for producing homo, random and<br>
heterophasic PP products. This type of catalysts is described in general in EP 491 566,<br>
and was prepared as follows:<br>
1100 kg of TiCl4 was fed to a reactor and cooled to -20°C. 77 kg of the MgCl2 carrier<br>
obtained by spray-crystallizing MgCl2(C2H5OH)n melt was suspended in 223 kg<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent (bp. 90-110°C) and cooled before adding it to the cold<br>
TiCl4. Controlled heating to 130°C was performed. During heating di-2-ethyl-hexyl<br>
phthalate (DOP) was added, and transesterification (DOP to DEP, diethyl phthalate)<br>
effected by keeping the mixture for 30 minutes at 130°C. The solid was separated by<br>
filtration. The procedure was repeated 3 time, each repeat adding the TiC14 to the<br>
filtered solid recovered from the previous titanation. The catalyst, resulting from the<br>
third repeat, was washed 4 times with the aliphatic hydrocarbon solvent and dried in<br>
vacuum to free flowing powder. The surface area and porosity of a catalyst produced<br>
was typically 250-300 m2/g and 0,4-0,5 g/cm3, respectively. The catalyst contained 2,1<br>
w-% titanium. The bulk density of the polymer was 470 kg/m3' Other details are<br>
shown in Table 1.<br>
Comparative Example 2<br>
This example was done in accordance with Example 1, with the exception that a<br>
porous commercially available catalyst was used. This catalyst can be described as a<br>
typical porous 4th generation Ziegler Natta catalyst for producing homo, random and<br>
heterophasic PP products. The Ti content of this catalyst was 2,4 w-%. The average<br>
catalyst particle size is 60µm. The bulk density of the polymer was 450 kg/m3 The<br>
other details are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br><br>
From comparison of homo PP produced with the compact catalyst in this invention<br>
(Example 1) with other porous catalysts (comparative Examples 1 and 2) it can be<br>
clearly seen that the catalyst of this invention gives polymers with much higher bulk<br>
densities.<br>
Example 3<br>
This example was done in accordance with Example 1, with the exception that the<br>
hydrogen amount was 700 mmol and that donor D (dicyclo pentyl dimethoxy silane)<br>
was used as external donor. The catalyst in this example contained 2,84 w-%<br>
Titanium. MFR of the polymer was 88. Other details are seen in Table 2.<br>
Example 4<br>
This example was done in accordance with Example 3, but after having flashed out<br>
unreacted propylene after the bulk polymerization step the polymerization was<br>
continued in gas phase. In the gas phase step ethylene/propylene rubber was produced.<br>
The reactor was first pressurised, up to 2 bars, and purged five times with a 0,70<br>
mol/mol ethylene/propylene gas mixture. Thereafter 50 mmol hydrogen was added.<br>
Finally the pressure was increased to 20 bar with the same ethylene/propylene mixture<br>
and temperature was increased to 70°C during 10 minutes. A sample of the gas in the<br>
reactor towards the end of the polymerization was analysed with gas chromatograph<br>
showed that the ethylene/propylene ratio in the reactor was 0,52 mol/mol. After 35<br>
minutes the reaction was stopped by flashing out unreacted propylene. The polymeric<br>
powder was free flowing both in the reactor (observed through the window) during the<br>
polymerization and after polymerization. The polymeric product was stabilised,<br>
analysed and tested. The amount of rubber (~AM part of the sample) in the product<br>
was about 28 w-% and the ethylene content in the rubber (AM/C2) was 40 w-% and<br>
intrinsic viscosity was 3,5 dl/g. Other details are seen in.<br><br>
Example 5<br>
This example was done in accordance with Example 4, with the exception that the<br>
hydrogen amount in the gas phase was 120 mmol. The amount of rubber in the<br>
product was 27 w-%, ethylene content in the rubber 39 w-% and IV of rubber 2,3. The<br>
polymeric powder was free flowing both in reactor and after reaction. Other details are<br>
seen in Table 2.<br>
Example 6<br>
This example was done in accordance with Example 5, with the exception that the<br>
ethylene/propylene ratio in the feed to the gas phase polymerization was 0,87 mol/mol<br>
The amount of rubber in the product was 37 w-%, ethylene in the rubber was 43 w-%<br>
and IV of rubber 2,7 The polymeric powder was free flowing both in reactor and after<br>
reaction. Other details are seen in Table 2.<br>
Example 7<br>
This example was done in accordance with Example 5, with the exception that the<br>
ethylene/propylene ratio in the feed to the gas phase polymerization was 1,2 mol/mol.<br>
The amount of rubber was 28 w-%, ethylene in rubber 49 w-% and IV of rubber 2,6.<br>
The polymeric powder was free flowing both in reactor and after reaction. Other<br>
details are seen in Table 2.<br><br><br><br>
Example 8<br>
This example was done in a continuously working pilot plant, comprising the<br>
following reactors in series: prepolymerizer, loop, gas phase 1 and gas phase 2. The<br>
catalyst was prepared according to patent W003/00C754 and had Ti content 3,0 w-%.<br>
The catalyst was modified with vinyl cyclo hexane according to patent WO 00/68315<br>
prior to use in the polymerization pilot.<br>
Donor D was used as external donor with Al/Do (cocatalyst/donor) molar ratio 10 and<br>
TEA was used as cocatalyst with Al/Ti molar ratio 108 in the polymerization pilot.<br>
The catalyst was activated with 10% of the TEA feed in the pipeline to the<br>
prepolymerizer and the activation time was about 15 seconds. The catalyst was flushed<br>
to the continuous prepolymerizer with propane. Propylene, external donor and the<br>
remaining 90% of the TEA feed was fed to the prepolymerizer. The hydrogen<br>
concentration was 0,2 mol-%. The temperature was 30°C, pressure 55 bar and<br>
residence time of the liquid in the prepolymerizer 16 minutes.<br>
The temperature in the loop was 80°C, pressure 55 bar, hydrogen/propylene ration 22<br>
mol/kmol and residence time 30 minutes.<br>
The temperature in the first gas phase reactor was 80°C, total pressure 27 bar,<br>
propylene partial pressure 20 bar, hydrogen/propylene ratio 150 mol/kmol and<br>
residence time 90 minutes. MFR and XS of a polymer sample taken from the first gas<br>
phase reactor was 210 g/10 minutes and 2,0 w-%, respectively.<br>
The temperature in the second gas phase reactor (rubber reactor) was 70°C, total<br>
pressure 28 bar, propylene partial pressure 14 bar, ethylene/propylene molar ratio 0,40,<br>
hydrogen/ethylene molar ratio 0.32 and residence time 90 minutes. MFR of the final<br>
product was 90g/10 min, XS 21,1 w-%, AM 20,7 w-%, ethylene in AM 33 w-% and<br>
IV of AM 1,8 dl/g. The polymeric powder was free flowing and there was no problem<br><br>
to transfer the polymer powder between reactors or 1 between rubber reactor and silos.<br>
The tensile modulus of the product was at room temperature 1250 MPa and Charpy<br>
notched impact at 0°C was 4,4 kJ/m2.<br>
Analyses of the ethylene content of a cross-section slice (ca 50 µm thick) from a single<br>
(see Figure 1) particle shows that ethylene is evenly distributed throughout the<br>
particle. Eight separate analyses of the ethylene content from a single particle<br>
(diameter 1.5 mm) were carried out as is indicated in Figure 2. The circle represents<br>
the round slice and the 8 squares represent the area of analysis in each test. The area of<br>
analysis in each test was about 0.05 x 0.05 mm. Analyses were done with infra red<br>
spectrometry. When comparing the eight spectrograms of Figure 1, it can easily be<br>
seen that the ethylene/propylene rubber is evenly distributed throughout the particle<br>
and not concentrated in the surface regions. In the latter case severe stickiness<br>
problems would be expected.<br><br>
