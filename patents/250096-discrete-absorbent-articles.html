				<td>DISCRETE ABSORBENT ARTICLES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to absorbent articles, such as, pantyliners, sanitary<br>
napkins, incontinence pads, and the like. More particularly, the present invention<br>
relates to discrete absorbent articles adapted to be worn in a perineal region of the<br>
wearer.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Disposable absorbent articles that having absorbent materials are disclosed in<br>
the literature and are commercially available. Typical disposable absorbent articles<br>
may include components such as (a) a body-faceable cover layer designed to keep the<br>
body dry, (b) an absorbent system that generally holds and contains the bulk of any<br>
bodily discharges (e.g., blood, menses, urine, etc.), and (c) a liquid-impermeable barrier<br>
layer that prevents any bodily discharges from leaking out of the absorbent article.<br>
Typically, disposable absorbent articles used as sanitary protection are white.<br>
Because the materials, e.g., fibers and films, used to make the components, e.g., cover,<br>
absorbent core and barrier, of such absorbent articles often do not have the desired<br>
color, pigments, dyes, or other color imparting materials, such as, titanium dioxide,<br>
carbon black, and the like, are added to such materials to produce the desired color.<br>
However, for example, a cover and barrier layer produced from such pigmented<br>
materials may make the article or its contour highly visible, thereby reducing<br>
discretion.<br>
For improved discretion, discrete absorbent article having one or more<br>
components or portions that are at least substantially transparent have been described in<br>
the literature. However, typically these articles offer only limited solution to the<br>
problem of discretion in that one or more portions or components of the article, as worn<br><br>
by the user are not substantially transparent, and therefore the article as a whole is not<br>
discrete. For example, these articles often include absorbent systems having materials<br>
that are white and therefore readily visible, thereby not supporting the transparency of<br>
the article.<br>
Other discrete absorbent articles previously described have a plurality of<br>
transparent components or layers, including an absorbent core that supports the<br>
transparency of the article. However, to provide absorbency, the absorbent core<br>
includes absorbent gelling materials that are in the form of granules, fibers, or sheets, or<br>
strips. These absorbent cores suffer from drawbacks. For example, fibers of absorbent<br>
gelling materials are typically not cost-effective, sheets of absorbent gelling materials<br>
are difficult to manufacture, and granules are capable of shifting during transport and<br>
use of the article.<br>
Other known methods of forming transparent articles include treating a<br>
substrate with a solution of polyacrylic acid oligomers that are crosslinked upon<br>
removal of solvent (e.g., water). Unfortunately, such solutions of polyacrylic acid<br>
oligomers are susceptible to microbial contamination, are relatively expensive, and<br>
have limited commercial availability.<br>
Furthermore, such articles are not optimized for efficient absorbency across the<br>
lateral expanse or "silhouette" of the article. Accordingly, the need exists for an<br>
absorbent article that provides user discretion and overcomes one or more of the above-<br>
mentioned drawbacks.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention provides an absorbent article having a silhouette that<br>
includes a first portion and a second portion, wherein the second portion is in opposite<br>
relation to the first portion, and a pair of opposed longitudinally extending sides<br><br>
connecting the first portion to the second portion. The absorbent article also includes a<br>
layered portion with a substantially transparent, body-faceable cover layer, and a<br>
substantially transparent liquid-absorbing coating spaced apart from the substantially<br>
transparent liquid-permeable cover layer by a substantially transparent separating layer.<br>
In another aspect of the invention, a method of forming a substantially<br>
transparent absorbent article including: providing a substrate selected from the group<br>
consisting of a liquid-impermeable barrier layer, and a separating layer; applying a<br>
coating composition to the substrate to form a substantially transparent, liquid<br>
absorbing coating thereon; and positioning the substantially transparent, liquid<br>
absorbing coating such that is spaced apart from a liquid-permeable cover layer by the<br>
separating layer, thereby forming the substantially transparent article.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
As used herein, all disclosed ranges expressly include and disclose all values<br>
between the endpoints.<br>
The absorbent articles of this invention, include, but are not limited to, sanitary<br>
napkins, pantyliners, incontinence devices, wound care articles, e.g., surgical dressings<br>
and adhesive bandages, shoe liners and the like. Figure 1 depicts an absorbent article 1,<br>
which may be, for example, a pantiliner, a sanitary napkin, an interlabial device, an<br>
adult incontinence device, or a diaper, of the present invention.<br>
The absorbent article 1 has a silhouette 3 that generally defines the expanse of<br>
the absorbent article 1. The silhouette 3 includes a first transversely-extending edge 5<br>
and a second transversely-extending edge 7 that is generally in opposite relation to the<br>
first transversely-extending edge 5. The silhouette 3 further includes a first<br>
longitudinally-extending edge 9 and a second longitudinally extending edge 11 that is<br>
generally in opposite relation to the first longitudinally-extending edge 9. The first<br>
longitudinally-extending edge 9 and the second longitudinally extending edge 11<br>
connect the first transversely-extending edge 5 and the second transversely-extending<br>
edge 7. The absorbent article optionally includes flaps (not shown in the Figures), also<br>
known as wings, tabs and the like, that are generally flexible and configured to be<br>
folded over the edges of the underwear so that the flaps anchor or secure the absorbent<br>
article to the underwear. The design of the flaps is not critical. The flaps may include<br>
extensions of either or both of a barrier layer, a cover layer (the barrier layer and cover<br>
layer are discussed in detail below), or the cover and barrier layer adhered or laminated<br>
together.<br><br>
The absorbent articles of the present invention can be of various shapes and<br>
configurations depending on the intended end use, e.g., sanitary protection, including<br>
pantyliners and sanitary napkins, surgical dressings or wipes, and the like.<br>
Additionally, the present absorbent articles can be incorporated into a disposable or<br>
limited use garment as an integral part thereof. For example, an absorbent article made<br>
according to the present invention can be a part of disposable training pants and similar<br>
garments. In one embodiment of the invention, the absorbent article is a sanitary<br>
napkin or pantiliner having a shape that is substantially rectangular, dog-bone-like, or<br>
peanut-like.<br>
Figure 2A depicts a cross-sectional view of the absorbent article of Figure 1<br>
taken through line A-A. The absorbent article 1 has a layered structure 39. In<br>
particular, the absorbent article 1 includes a body-faceable, fluid-permeable cover layer<br>
31, a substantially transparent, liquid-absorbing coating 100 spaced apart from the<br>
cover layer 31, a separating layer 41, an optional fluid-impermeable, and a garment-<br>
faceable barrier layer 35. The cover layer 31 and the barrier layer 35 may be joined or<br>
sealed to each other along a peripheral edge 13 using any method known in the art. The<br>
cover layer 31 and the barrier layer 35 may encase the separating layer 41, the coating<br>
100 as well as other layers that may be included in the article. Although not shown in<br>
Figure 1, the barrier layer 35, the cover layer 31, and optionally the separating layer 41<br>
and the coating 100 may be extended to form flaps useful (particularly for panty liners,<br>
sanitary napkins, and the like) for folding about an edge of an undergarment.<br>
The cover layer 31 is generally compliant, soft feeling, and non-irritating to the<br>
user's skin. The cover layer 31 generally functions to transport liquid away from the<br>
wearer into the absorbent article 1. In this manner, fluid and moisture are removed<br>
from contacting the wearer, thus making the wearer feel dry and comfortable. The<br><br>
cover may also possess low rewet potential, i.e., when, for example, pressure is applied<br>
to the absorbent article, absorbed liquid is not readily released and thus capable of "re-<br>
wetting" the wearer.<br>
The cover layer 31 is substantially transparent. As used herein, "substantially<br>
transparent" refers to those individual layers or articles having a structure, composition,<br>
thickness, such that between about 45 to about 100 percent of light intensity in the<br>
visible spectrum is transmitted through the thickness of the layer of material or article.<br>
Total transmittance is the ratio of total transmitted light to incident light. It is reduced<br>
by reflectance and absorbance. The cover layer 31 may be substantially or completely<br>
free of colorants such as dyes and/or pigments (e.g., titanium dioxide, among other<br>
colorants) that are typically added to plastic films and fibers in order to impart a<br>
particular color (e.g., white, black, red, blue, green, among others) thereto.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the cover layer 31 includes an<br>
interconnected network of woven and/or nonwoven fabrics formed from polyester,<br>
polypropylene, polyethylene, nylon, and/or rayon fibers or the cover layer 31. The<br>
fibers may be oriented by a carding process and thermally bonded via embossing. The<br>
cover layer 31 may include an apertured thermo-plastic film or a formed film. The<br>
fibers or other materials that make up the cover layer 31 should not collapse or lose<br>
their resiliency when subjected to body fluid. The cover layer 31 may optionally be<br>
treated with surfactant to manipulate the hydrophobicity/hydrophilicty thereof to<br>
facilitate optimal fluid transport properties. The thickness of the cover layer 31 may<br>
vary from about 0.025 mm to about 5 mm, depending on the material chosen. The<br>
basis weight of the body faceable cover layer 31 material may be between about 5 to<br>
about 150 grams per square meter (gsm). In one embodiment of the invention, the<br><br>
cover layer 31 has a basis weight less than about 75 gsm, less than about 30 gsm, or<br>
less than about 9 gsm.<br>
One suitable example of an apertured thermo-plastic film that may be used for<br>
the cover layer 31 is unpigmented apertured film X28024, available from Tredegar<br>
Corporation of Richmond, Virginia. Suitable examples of a non-woven fibrous<br>
material that may be used for the cover layer 31 include unpigmented nonwoven (9<br>
gsm), available from Shalag of Upper Tiberias, Israel, and unpigmented nonwoven (9<br>
gsm) available from Cia Provicencia Industria e Comercio of Curitiba, Brazil.<br>
Spaced apart from the cover layer 31 is a substantially transparent, liquid-<br>
absorbing coating 100. The substantially transparent, liquid-absorbing coating 100 has<br>
a high capacity for absorbing bodily exudates (e.g., urine, menstrual fluid, etc.). When<br>
these liquids move "down" from the cover layer 3, they are conveyed to the liquid-<br>
absorbing coating 100, which retains the bulk of the liquid until the absorbent article 1<br>
is discarded. The liquid-absorbing coating 100 is generally smaller (i.e., it occupies a<br>
smaller area when viewed from the top) than the barrier layer 35 and the cover layer 31.<br>
The substantially transparent, liquid absorbing coating 100 may include a<br>
material capable of absorbing aqueous liquids and a matrix 75, such as a matrix of<br>
adhesive that surrounds the liquid absorbing material. The liquid-absorbing material is<br>
capable of absorbing and trapping liquid within the liquid absorbing material but is not<br>
soluble in the liquids absorbed. The liquid absorbing material may be discrete liquid-<br>
absorbing particles 73 that are distributed substantially homogeneously in the matrix<br>
75.<br>
The amount of liquid absorbing material will define the absorbency of the<br>
material; the more aqueous liquid absorbing material added, the greater the absorbency.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the matrix 75 is a hot melt adhesive and the<br><br>
coating 100 is a homogeneous mixture of greater than about 1% by weight of the<br>
liquid-absorbing material in the matrix 75. In another embodiment of the invention, the<br>
coating 100 includes greater than about 40% by weight of the liquid-absorbing<br>
material. In another embodiment of the invention, the coating 100 includes greater than<br>
about 60% by weight of the liquid-absorbing material.<br>
The matrix 75 may include a block co-polymer. Suitable block copolymers for<br>
use in the invention include linear or radial co-polymer structures having the formula<br>
(A-B)x, wherein block A is a polyvinylarene block, block B is a poly(monoalkenyl)<br>
block, x denotes the number of polymeric arms, and wherein x is an integer greater than<br>
or equal to one. Suitable block A polyvinylarenes include, but are not limited to<br>
polystyrene, polyalpha-methylstyrene, polyvinyltoluene, and combinations thereof.<br>
Suitable Block B poly(monoalkenyl) blocks include, but are not limited to, conjugated<br>
diene elastomers such as for example polybutadiene or polyisoprene or hydrogenated<br>
elastomers such as ethylene butylene or ethylene propylene or polyisobutylene, or<br>
combinations thereof. Commercial examples of these types of block copolymers<br>
include Kraton™ elastomers from Shell Chemical Company Vector™ elastomers from<br>
Dexco, Solprene™ from Enichem Elastomers and Stereon™ from Firestone Tire &amp;<br>
Rubber Co. The matrix 75 is, in one embodiment of the invention, substantially free of<br>
water.<br>
The matrix 75 may include a tackifying resin. Suitable tackifying resins include<br>
natural and modified resins; glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of natural and modified<br>
resins; polyterpene resins; copolymers and terpolymers of natural terpenes; phenolic<br>
modified terpene resins and the hydrogenated derivatives thereof; aliphatic petroleum<br>
resins and the hydrogenated derivatives thereof; aromatic petroleum resin and the<br>
hydrogenated derivatives thereof; and aliphatic or aromatic petroleum resins and the<br><br>
hydrogenated derivatives thereof, and combinations thereof. Commercial examples of<br>
these types of resins include Foral® hydrogenated rosin ester, Staybelite® hydrogenated<br>
modified rosin, Poly-pale® polymerized rosin, Permalyn® rosin ester, Pentalyn® rosin<br>
ester, Adtac® oil extended hydrocarbon resin, Piccopale® aromatic hydrocarbon,<br>
Piccotac®, Hercotac® aromatic modified aliphatic hydrocarbon, Regalrez®<br>
cycloaliphatic resins, or Piccolyte® from Hercules, Eselementz® from Exxon Chemical<br>
aliphatic hydrocarbon and cycloaliphatic resins, Wingtack® from Goodyear Tire &amp;<br>
Rubber Co. synthetic polyterpene resins including aromatic modified versions, Arkon®<br>
partially and fully hydrogenated aromatic resins from Arakawa Chemicals, Zonatac®<br>
styrenated terpene resin, Zonarez® rosin ester and Zonester® rosin ester from Arizona<br>
Chemical and Nevtac® aromatic modified aliphatic hydrocarbon from Neville Chemical<br>
Company.<br>
Liquid-absorbing materials suitable for inclusion in the coating 100 include<br>
thermoplastic hydrogels such as superabsorbent materials or thermoplastic polymeric<br>
compositions, which are, for example, formed from a water-soluble soft segment and<br>
one or more hard segments. The hard segment may be melt processable, i.e., at use<br>
temperature the hard segments in the polymer are below their melt temperature, and at<br>
process temperature, the hard segments are above their melting point temperature and<br>
below the decomposition temperature of either the other components of the hot-melt<br>
adhesive composition. The hard segment is substantially insoluble in water, and phase<br>
separates from the soft segment. Examples of suitable hard segments include, but are<br>
not limited to polyurethane, polyamides, polyesters, polyureas, and combinations<br>
thereof. Examples of suitable soft segments include, but are not limited to polyethylene<br>
oxide, polyvinyl alcohol, polyvinyl pyrrolidone, polyacrylamide, polysaccharide,<br>
polymaleic anhydride, random copolymers of polyethylene oxide and polypropylene-<br><br>
oxide and combinations thereof. The soft and hard segments may be covalently bonded<br>
together by means of urethane, amide, ester, or secondary urea linkages or<br>
combinations thereof. Examples of aqueous liquid absorbing thermoplastic polymeric<br>
compositions which are commercially available include hydrophilic polyurethane from<br>
Tyndale Plains-Hunter Ltd. and Aquacaulk® thermoplastic polymers from Sumitomo<br>
Seika Chemicals Co., Ltd. Suitable superabsorbent materials include any of the<br>
conventional superabsorbent particles or superabsorbent fibers which are commercially<br>
available today. Examples are Aquakeep SA-70 and J-550P from Sumitomo Seika<br>
Chemicals Co., Ltd.<br>
For embodiments of the invention in which the liquid-absorbing material is<br>
present as liquid absorbing particles 73, such as superabsorbent particles, the particles<br>
73 may be present in units having a dimension/diameter less than about 150 microns.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the particles 73 have an average particle size less<br>
than about 125 microns. In another embodiment of the invention, the particles 73 have<br>
an average particle size between about 10 microns and about 75 microns. The small<br>
particle size of the liquid absorbing material results in higher surface area of the liquid<br>
absorbing particles 73 and therefore higher liquid absorbency. Furthermore, the small<br>
particle size also facilitates attaining a homogeneous mixture and ease of processing the<br>
material through conventional hot melt adhesive application equipment.<br>
The matrix 75 may include a plasticizer. Suitable plasticizers for use in the<br>
present invention include any conventional plasticizers which decrease hardness and<br>
modulus, enhance pressure sensitive tack and reduce melt and solution viscosity. It is<br>
preferred that the plasticizer be water soluble or water dispersible or alternatively be a<br>
wax-like substance such as polyethylene glycol, glycerin, glycerol, polypropylene<br><br>
glycol, butylene glycol or sorbitol. An example of a preferred plasticizer is Carbowax®<br>
polyethylene glycol from Union Carbide.<br>
The matrix 75 may include additional functional ingredients. For example, the<br>
coating 100 may include an anti-oxidant. Suitable anti-oxidants for use in the present<br>
invention include any conventional anti-oxidants, such as hindered phenols, for<br>
example, Ethanox 330w l,3,5-trimethyl-2,4,6-tris(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)<br>
benzene which is commercially available from the Ethyl Corporation.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the coating 100 includes (by weight):<br>
about 10 - about 50% block copolymer (such as block copolymer having a melt index<br>
greater than about 10), about 20 - about 80% tackifying resin (such as having a<br>
softening point less than about 105°C), greater than about 1% liquid absorbing<br>
polymer, about 0 - about 40% plasitcizer with viscosity from about 1 - about 500<br>
centipoise at application temperature, and about 0 - about 2.0% antioxidant.<br>
The coating 100 may be substantially free of fibrous material, i.e., in this case it<br>
is substantially free of fibers such as synthetic, cellulosic, and other fibers that are<br>
processed using traditional fiber processing techniques (air-laid, wet-laid, carding, and<br>
the like) and commonly used in transfer layers and absorbent cores of absorbent<br>
articles.<br>
The substantially transparent, liquid-absorbing coating 100 is spaced apart from<br>
the cover layer 31 by a substantially transparent fluid management medium, such as the<br>
separating layer 41. The separating layer 41 generally serves to separate the cover<br>
layer 41 from the liquid-absorbing coating 100. The separating layer 41 also may serve<br>
to provide lateral wicking of liquid that is transmitted through the cover layer 31,<br>
thereby providing greater utilization across the silhouette 3 of the article 1 as well as<br>
reduction of gel-blocking within the coating 100. Alternatively, or in addition to<br><br>
wicking benefits, the separating layer 41 may also serve to provide a substrate upon<br>
which the liquid absorbing coating 100 is deposited. The separating layer 41 may serve<br>
either or both of these functions in one unitized layer. Alternatively, either or both of<br>
these functions may be performed by the separating layer 41 that includes a discrete<br>
transfer layer for distributing fluid and/or a discrete insert that serves to provide a<br>
substrate upon which the liquid absorbing coating 100 may be deposited. In addition to<br>
serving either or both of the functions of fluid distribution and/or substrate, the<br>
separating layer 41 may also function to absorb and contain bodily fluids. The<br>
separating layer 41 is substantially transparent.<br>
The separating layer 41 may have a thickness in a range from about 0.5 mm to<br>
about 3.0 mm. The transfer layer may have a bulk density in a range from about 0.03<br>
g/cc to about 0.15 g/cc. Furthermore, the separating layer 41 has a basis weight that is<br>
high enough to maintain its mechanical integrity during use of the product, including<br>
when the separating layer 41 is wet with bodily exudates. The separating layer 41 may<br>
have, for example, a basis weight in a range from about 5 gsm to about 200 gsm.<br>
Generally, with other attributes (e.g., thickness, fiber denier, materials of<br>
construction, and the like) of the separating layer held constant, the transparency of the<br>
separating layer 41 decreases with basis weight. However, it is possible to maintain<br>
substantial transparency (e.g., greater than about 45%) of the separating layer 41 even if<br>
the basis weight of the transfer layer is high, by increasing the open area (i.e., the void<br>
area within the separating layer 41 that is unoccupied by fibers) in the layer. Increasing<br>
open area may be accomplished by, for example, increasing the specific gravity of the<br>
material that the fibers are formed from, decreasing the denier of the fibers, and the<br>
like. In one embodiment of the invention, the denier of the fibers in the transfer layer is<br>
between about 1.5 denier per fiber (dpf) and about 15 dpf; such as between about 6 dpf<br><br>
and about 15 dpf. These ranges of denier may be suitable, for example, when the<br>
separating layer 41 is an aggregate of polypropylene fibers having a basis weight of<br>
about 45 gsm. In one embodiment of the invention, to enhance light transmission, the<br>
separating layer 41 is free of cellulose, such as cellulose wood pulp, and the like,<br>
although this absence of cellulose is not required.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, the separating layer 41 is a transfer layer<br>
capable of distributing fluid in a direction generally parallel to the cover layer 31. As<br>
such, fluid impinging upon the cover layer 31 is spread across the silhouette 3 of the<br>
absorbent article, providing efficient management of fluid. In this embodiment of the<br>
invention, the transfer layer generally has sufficient thickness or loft to prevent fluid<br>
from penetrating through to a back surface 43 of the transfer layer before the fluid has a<br>
sufficient opportunity to spread outward. The transfer layer receives body fluid from<br>
the fluid-permeable cover layer 31 and holds it until the substantially transparent liquid-<br>
absorbing layer 100 has an opportunity to absorb it. The transfer layer is generally<br>
more dense than the cover layer 31 and has a larger proportion of smaller pores than<br>
does the cover layer 31. These attributes allow the transfer layer to contain body fluid<br>
and hold it away from the outer side of the cover layer 31, thereby preventing the fluid<br>
from re-wetting the cover layer 31 and its outer surface. However, the transfer layer is<br>
preferably not so dense as to prevent the passage of the fluid through the transfer layer<br>
and into the underlying liquid-absorbing layer 100.<br>
The transfer layer may include various materials, including, for example,<br>
fibrous webs, resilient foams, and the like. The transfer layer may include synthetic<br>
polymer materials such as single component or bicomponent fibers that include<br>
thermoplastic materials (such as polyester, polypropylene, polyethylene, polyethylene<br>
terepthalate, among others) in fiber or other forms, rayon, organic binders (such as<br><br>
copolymers of vinyl, acrylic and/or other monomers that may be coated onto<br>
thermoplastic fibers or otherwise incorporated into the transfer layer) among other<br>
materials known to the art.<br>
The transfer layer may include hydrophobic, nonabsorbent fibers that are able to<br>
accept large volumes of fluid into interfiber void spaces while the fibers themselves<br>
need not absorb any significant quantities of fluid. Likewise, open-celled foam<br>
structures that are made from nonabsorbent materials may also absorb fluid into the<br>
cells of the foam. The walls of the cells, however, need not absorb any fluid. The<br>
cumulative spaces within the transfer layer, i.e., the interfiber void spaces in the fibrous<br>
transfer layer or the open cells in the foam transfer layer, function much like a container<br>
to hold fluid.<br>
The transfer layer may be a fibrous web comprising resilient, nonabsorbent<br>
materials to provide void volume and to allow for free movement of fluid through the<br>
structure. Transfer layers that are made from webs of mostly absorbent fibers absorb<br>
the fluid as it enters the structure and do not distribute it throughout the rest of the<br>
structure as efficiently as webs containing non-absorbent materials. In one embodiment<br>
of the invention, the transfer layer includes an unpigmented apertured plastic film, such<br>
as Tredegar AF X28024, having a basis weight of, for example, about 24 gsm.<br>
The coating 100 may be coated on a bottom surface 81 of the separating layer<br>
41 as shown in Figure 2A. Alternatively, the coating 100 may be coated upon a top<br>
surface 85 of the barrier layer 35, as shown in Figure 2B.<br>
The separating layer 41 may be a multi-layer structure as shown in Figure 2C.<br>
In this embodiment of the invention, the separating layer 41 includes a transfer layer 71<br>
and an insert 51. The insert 51 acts as a substrate upon which the liquid-absorbing<br>
coating may be deposited. The insert 51 may provide additional fluid-distribution<br><br>
properties to enhance the fluid transfer or acquisition properties of the transfer layer 71,<br>
or the insert 51 may provide liquid retention (absorbing) properties to enhance those of<br>
the liquid-absorbing coating 100. While Figure 2C shows the coating 100 formed on a<br>
bottom surface 83 of the insert 51, the coating 100 may alternatively be formed on a top<br>
surface 87 of the insert 51 or a bottom surface 89 of the transfer layer 71.<br>
Note that various gaps 91 are shown in Figures 2A-2C to illustrate, even if<br>
construction adhesive is used to bond one or more of the layers together, that the<br>
various layers of the article 1 need not conform exactly to one another. These gaps 91,<br>
are substantially void of material may, for example, be on the order of about 0.05 mm<br>
to about 1.5mm as the article 1 is laid flat in an uncompressed state. Note that no gaps<br>
91 are depicted in Figures 2A-2C between the coating 100 and the surface upon which<br>
it is coated. This is because the coating 100 is generally intimately bonded to the layer<br>
upon which it is coated (i.e., its substrate) and no substantial spacing is present between<br>
the coating 100 and its substrate.<br>
The insert 51 may be a thin layer of fibrous material that retains fluid and is<br>
positioned intermediate the transfer layer 71 and the substantially transparent, liquid-<br>
absorbing coating 100 or intermediate the substantially transparent, liquid-absorbing<br>
coating 100 and the barrier layer 35. Examples of material that may be used in the<br>
construction of the insert 51 include, for example, cellulosic fibers (e.g., wood pulp,<br>
cotton or flax), synthetic fibers, superabsorbent polymers (SAP) or superabsorbent<br>
fibers, as well organic binders or other materials described above as suitable for<br>
incorporation into the transfer layer, and other materials known to the art of<br>
manufacturing absorbent core materials. The relative proportion of these materials may<br>
be varied to achieve sufficient absorbency, compressibility, and processibility. Such<br>
highloft webs may be bonded with chemical binders or by thermal means such as by<br><br>
through-air bonding. The insert 51 may be, for example, a layer of high-loft non-<br>
woven material. One suitable example includes a layer of thermal bonded network of<br>
polypropylene fibers (e.g., 45 gsm), such as is available from Polystar Industria e<br>
Comercio de Produtos Sinteticos LTDA of Salvador, Brazil. The insert 51 may be<br>
resin or thermal bonded, and flat or emboss calendared to achieve an appropriate<br>
strength. The density of the insert 51 may be in a range from about 0.08 g/cc to about<br>
0.60 g/cc.<br>
The absorbent article 1 may also include a garment faceable, liquid-<br>
impermeable barrier layer 35. The barrier layer 35 is substantially transparent and<br>
impermeable to liquids and, thus, prevents bodily fluids from soiling the clothing of the<br>
user. Suitable materials that may be incorporated into the barrier layer 35 include, for<br>
example, embossed or non-embossed polyethylene films, microporous films, and<br>
laminated tissue, among other materials. In one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
barrier layer 35 layer is a thin, flexible, fluid impermeable material, such as, a<br>
polymeric film, e.g., polyethylene, polypropylene, or cellophane, or a normally liquid<br>
permeable material that has been treated to be impermeable, such as, impregnated fluid<br>
repellent paper or non-woven material, including non-woven fabric material, or a<br>
flexible foam, such as polyurethane or cross-linked polyethylene. The garment<br>
faceable, liquid-impermeable barrier layer 35 is substantially transparent and may be<br>
free of colorants such as dyes and/or pigments. The thickness of the barrier layer when<br>
formed from a polymeric film may be about 0.025 mm to about 0.051 mm. One<br>
suitable example of material that may be used for the barrier layer 35 is Tredegar (non-<br>
shine) X28480, available from Tredegar Film Products. The barrier layer 35 may<br>
include ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA), although EVA is not required.<br><br>
The garment faceable, liquid-impermeable barrier layer 35 may be breathable,<br>
i.e., intended to allow the passage of vapor or water molecules through them while<br>
retarding, at least to a degree, the passage of fluid. Monolithic film technology<br>
provides materials that can be used to form sheets that allow vapor transmission, but<br>
are relatively impermeable to liquids. Commonly used materials are segmented block<br>
copolymers, polyvinyl alcohol, polyurethane, cellulosics and blends thereof. Other<br>
materials that may be used as impermeable barriers may be chosen from films of<br>
polypropylene, polyethylene, polyesters, polyamides, polyethylene vinyl acetate,<br>
polyvinyl chloride, and polyvinylidene chloride. Co-extruded and laminated<br>
combinations of the foregoing, wherein such combinations are permitted by the<br>
chemical and physical properties of the film, may be used. Fluid impermeable<br>
nonreticulated foams may also be used.<br>
A suitable barrier layer 35 material may be a pigment-free monolithic film made<br>
from segmented block copolymers where one block is hydrophilic and the other block<br>
hydrophobic in nature, alternative materials for monolithic films are polyvinyl alcohol,<br>
polyurethane, cellulosics and blends thereof. In one embodiment of the invention, the<br>
barrier layer 35 is made from a pigment-free and filler-free monolithic sheet made from<br>
segmented block copolymers. For example, the backsheet may be 0.8 mil,<br>
polypropylene film such as that supplied by the Edison Plastic Co. (Newport News,<br>
VA) (Code XP-766-B), a film from Filmtech. Corp. (Lehigh Valley, PA), or it may be a<br>
polyethylene film available from Tredegar Film Products of Richmond, VA (Code<br>
X28480).<br>
Note that various layers of the article 1 may be secured to one another using any<br>
suitable construction adhesive known to the art of absorbent article manufacture, to<br>
form a cohesive unit to enhance the article's stability. Such attachment or adherence<br><br>
may be by any known means, including, for example, adhesive, ultrasonics, co-<br>
embossing, thermobonding, mechanical bonding, and the like. However, it is preferred<br>
that the construction adhesive is colorless, e.g., a Gardner color of about 3 or less, and<br>
does not inhibit the light transmission, vapor transmission, or breathability of the<br>
barrier layer 35. The construction adhesive serves to hold the layers together and to<br>
minimize deformation during use. The adhesive can be applied as either a thin porous<br>
film or in a random spray, in a controlled spiral pattern, or in any other application<br>
pattern. See, for example, U.S. Patents Nos. 5,462,538; 5,681,305 and 5,885,681.<br>
In one embodiment of the invention, as shown in Figure 3, the liquid absorbing<br>
coating 100 is co-extensive with the first longitudinally-extending edge 5 and/or the<br>
second longitudinally-extending edge 7. For example, as indicated in Figure 3, the<br>
coating 100 may extend continuously from the first longitudinally-extending edge 5<br>
and the second longitudinally-extending edge 7. Furthermore, other layers that serve to<br>
absorb or transfer fluid such as the separating layer 41 (e.g., one or more of its<br>
components: the insert 51 and the transfer layer 71 may also be co-extensive with<br>
edges 5,7.<br>
Conventional articles that include superabsorbent materials (e.g.,<br>
superabsorbent polymer) positioned proximate or in contact with the edge 13 are<br>
unacceptable weakened when the superabsorbent absorbs liquid, causing a rupture of<br>
the seal along the edge 13, and delamination of the article 1 (see Comparative Example<br>
1 below). In one embodiment of the invention, the article 1 has a wet seal strength that<br>
is greater than about 80 grams/millimeter (g/mm), greater than about 100 g/mm, or<br>
greater than about 150 g/mm.<br>
Referring again to Figure 2A-2C, the absorbent article 1 may include a securing<br>
element 37 for securing the absorbent article to the inside surface of the crotch portion<br><br>
of a garment. The securing element 37 may include, for example, adhesive, mechanical<br>
attachment devices, such as, clips, laces, ties, and interlocking devices, e.g., snaps,<br>
buttons, VELCRO (available from Velcro USA, Inc., Manchester, NH), zipper, and<br>
combinations of thereof. The securing element 37 may be deposited on the barrier<br>
layer 35, as shown in Figure 2A-2C.<br>
Suitable adhesive that may be used as the securing element 37 may include<br>
pressure-sensitive adhesive, which may be applied as continuous or intermittent<br>
patches, strips, swirls, or waves, and the like. As used herein, the term pressure-<br>
sensitive adhesive refers to any releasable adhesive or releasable tenacious means.<br>
Suitable adhesive compositions, include, for example, water-based pressure-sensitive<br>
adhesives such as acrylate adhesives; emulsion or solvent-borne adhesives of<br>
polyisoprene, styrene-butadiene, or polyacrylate, vinyl acetate copolymer or<br>
combinations thereof; hot melt adhesives based on suitable block copoylmers; among<br>
other adhesive compositions now known or developed in the future in the art of<br>
absorbent article manufacture. In one embodiment of the invention, the pressure<br>
sensitive adhesive is free of colorants. The pressure sensitive adhesive may be applied<br>
to the outer surface barrier layer 35 of the absorbent article to help maintain it in place.<br>
As used herein, the term "pressure-sensitive adhesive" refers to any pigment-free<br>
releasable adhesive having a Gardner color of about 3 or less or releasable tenacious<br>
means that does not substantially decrease light transmissibility. Suitable pressure<br>
sensitive adhesives include, for example, water-based adhesives such as acrylate<br>
adhesives. Alternatively, the adhesive may be a rapid setting thermoplastic "hot melt"<br>
rubber adhesive or two-sided adhesive tape.<br>
A paper release strip that has been coated on one side, may be applied to protect<br>
the adhesive on the barrier layer prior to use. The coating on the release paper, for<br><br>
example, silicone, reduces adherence of the coated side of the release to the barrier<br>
layer adhesive. The release strip can be formed from any suitable sheet-like material<br>
that, when coated, adheres with sufficient tenacity to the adhesive to remain in place<br>
prior to use, but can be readily removed when the absorbent article prior to placement<br>
on the wearer's underpants.<br>
The article 1 has an overall thickness (measured in a relaxed, uncompressed<br>
state) that depends upon the particular use. For example, a pantiliner consistent with<br>
embodiments described herein may have a thickness greater than about 0.8 millimeters<br>
(mm). The overall thickness may be greater than 0.8 mm greater, such as greater than<br>
about 1 mm. The absorbency of the article 1 is such that the total capacity may be<br>
greater than about 2 grams. For a method of measuring total capacity, the reader is<br>
referred to U.S. patent 4,950,264, issued to the Procter &amp; Gamble Company. The<br>
article 1 as a whole (with any release strip that is present, removed) is substantially<br>
transparent, i.e., the entire article has a transparency that is greater than about 45%.<br>
The absorbent article, in the case of a pantyliner or sanitary napkin, may be<br>
applied to the crotch of underpants by removing any release strip and placing the<br>
barrier layer of the absorbent article against the inside of the crotch of the underpants.<br>
Other absorbent articles also within the scope of this invention also include wound care<br>
articles such as bandages, including adhesive bandages. Adhesive bandages usually<br>
have a barrier layer of perforated plastic or of a woven or knit fabric. The barrier layer<br>
is covered completely or partially on one side with a pressure sensitive adhesive. An<br>
absorbent core is placed in the center of and adhered to the adhesive side of the backing<br>
material. The absorbent core typically lies between a cover, which contacts the skin<br>
and prevents the absorbent from sticking to the wound, and the barrier layer.<br><br>
Alternately, absorbent articles within the scope of this invention also include shoe<br>
liners. Shoe liners usually have a non-skid backing and an absorbent.<br>
Articles of the present invention may be fabricated by a variety of methods<br>
known to the art of absorbent article manufacture. For example, individual webs<br>
(expanses of material layers that are unrolled to expose a section to be processed) of<br>
material may be provided along, for example, a conveyer. The webs may include<br>
separate webs of the barrier layer 35, the cover layer 31, and the at least one separating<br>
layer 41.<br>
A coating composition that includes, for example, liquid-absorbing polymer<br>
particles dispersed within an adhesive is coated upon one or more material layers that<br>
will constitute an absorbent article. The liquid absorbing polymer particles may have a<br>
particle size similar to those described previously. The composition may be formed,<br>
for example, by blending an adhesive that includes about 10% to about 50% of a block<br>
copolymer, and about 20% to about 80% of a tackifying resin, with greater than about<br>
1% of a liquid absorbing polymer in suitable adhesive processing equipment such as a<br>
melt mixer or extruder at a temperature above the melting points of the constituents<br>
until they are uniformly mixed. An exemplary suitable hot melt composition is code<br>
NW-1078, commercially available from HB Fuller Co., St. Paul, MR<br>
The one or more material layers to be coated are selected from the barrier layer<br>
35, the separating layer 41 (e.g., the transfer layer 71 and/or the insert 51). The coating<br>
composition may be heated from a non-flowable state to a temperature sufficient to<br>
render the composition flowable. The coating composition is deposited or formed on<br>
the one or more layers using, for example, conventional adhesive processing equipment<br>
such as a hot melt adhesive slot coating head, a hot melt adhesive swirl spray applicator<br>
(a commercial example of which is a Nordson Control Fiberization®), a hot melt<br><br>
adhesive micro fiber applicator (commercial examples of these applicators include<br>
Nordson Control Coat®, ITW Dynafiber®, J&amp;M Meltblown, and May Coating's<br>
Accufiber®), a hot melt adhesive rotary screen applicator to create a pattern coating<br>
(examples of this equipment include Nordson and Kraemer rotary screen technology).<br>
For embodiments in which the substrate is compressible (e.g., nonwoven or other<br>
fibrous substrates), a control coating apparatus may be used to deposit the coating to<br>
maintain the thickness and loft of the substrate upon which the composition is coated.<br>
The deposition of the coating composition on the substrate upon cooling to ambient<br>
temperature, results in the formation of the substantially transparent coating 100 on the<br>
substrate.<br>
The coating 100 is positioned in a spaced apart manner from the cover layer 31.<br>
The various layers are bonded together, such as by bonding the cover layer 31 to the<br>
barrier layer 35 along the edge 13. The various webs of materials may be bonded<br>
together using a suitable construction adhesive. The various webs may then be sealed<br>
together along a pattern similar to edge 13 shown in Figure 1. Application of tabs,<br>
positioning adhesive, release strips, among other films, layers, or structures may be<br>
performed as is known to the art of absorbent article manufacture.<br>
Embodiments of the invention described herein possess one or more of the<br>
following advantages: a high degree of liquid absorbency, a high degree of<br>
transparency, the ability to separately vary transparency and absorbency by varying the<br>
thickness and/or materials that are included in the coating 100, efficient utilization of<br>
the silhouette 3 of the article 1 by varying the thickness and/or materials that are<br>
included in the separating layer 41, consistent and substantially uniform absorbency<br>
due to the absorbent material being substantially immobile within the article, and<br>
improved wet seal strength. The transparent, liquid-absorbing coating 100 may enable<br><br>
the article 1 to be more transparent than conventional articles that include cellulose-<br>
based absorbent layers, because the coating 100 generally offers a higher degree of<br>
absorbency without compromising transparency. Embodiments of the invention<br>
described herein may also provide manufacturing flexibility and simplicity in that the<br>
coating 100 may be co-extensive with the edges 5, 7 without rendering the article 1<br>
vulnerable to a failure of the seal along the edge 13 during use.<br>
After the invention has been described in general hereinbefore, the following<br>
example is intended to illustrate details of embodiments of the invention, without<br>
thereby limiting it in any matter.<br><br>
EXAMPLE A<br>
Two absorbent articles were made and measured. The absorbent articles<br>
contained the following components:<br><br>
The articles (COMP 1 and EX 1) were sealed at a seal temperature of 280<br>
degrees Fahrenheit, under a pressure of 90 pounds for a dwell time of 7 seconds.<br>
Percent total transmittance was determined using a Gardner haze guard plus instrument<br><br>
model number 238 013 796K (BYK-Gardner USA, Columbia, MD), the transparency<br>
of the article was measured. A flat sample was placed in a round sample holder<br>
(approximately 60 mm diameter). Measurements were taken by placing the flat sample<br>
in the appropriate measuring ports of the instrument (haze port was used for<br>
transmittance and the haze, clarity port was used for clarity). A series of five readings<br>
were taken and averaged to obtain final measurement value. During the measurement,<br>
the narrow angle scattering was less than 2.5%. The wide angle scattering was greater<br>
than 2.5%. Total transmittance was calculated as the ratio of the total light transmitted<br>
to incident light. Total transmittance is reduced by reflectance and absorbance. The<br>
standard deviations for all measurements were less than 1.<br>
The transmittance of light through the articles was measured. The total<br>
transmittance for COMP 1 was calculated as 63.8%. The total transmittance for EX 1<br>
was calculated as 64.1%<br>
Secondly, wet seal strength was determined using an Instron Stress Strain<br>
Apparatus with charting capability. The following parameters were selected: gauge<br>
length of % inch, crosshead speed and chart speed of 12 inches per minute, fail rate of<br>
100% fail. The instrument was allowed to warm up for 20 minutes and was calibrated<br>
as per the manufacturers instructions. Test samples were prepared by cutting fourteen<br>
1" wide rectangular sections. Each section included a portion of the seal along the<br>
peripheral edge. Each sample was soaked for 15 seconds in water and placed on paper<br>
towels to remove excess moisture. The barrier layer was peeled apart from the cover<br>
layer to no less than 1/8" from the seal at the peripheral edge. The seal was placed in<br>
tension by clamping either end to the instrument, to the point of failure. Peak load was<br>
reported for each of the fourteen samples and averaged to determine wet seal strength.<br><br>
COMP 1 had a wet seal strength of 29 grams. EX 1 had a wet seal strength of 414<br>
grams.<br>
EXAMPLE B<br>
Five absorbent articles were measured for transparency. The absorbent articles<br>
are identified as follows:<br><br>
The articles identified above (Example B) were evaluated for transparency (total<br>
transmittance) as described above for Example A. COMP 2 had a total transmittance of<br>
30.5%. COMP 3 had a total transmittance of 28.0%. COMP 4 had a total<br>
transmittance of 42.5%. COMP 5 had a total transmittance of 23.4%. COMP 6 had a<br>
total transmittance of 22.0%.<br><br>
