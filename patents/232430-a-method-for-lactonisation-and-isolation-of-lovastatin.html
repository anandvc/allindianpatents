TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
"A METHOD FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF LOVASTATIN"<br>
We, LUPIN LIMITBD, of 159, CST Road, Kalina, Santacruz (East), Mumbai - 400 098, India;<br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
WO 2005/035515<br><br>
PCT/IN2OO3/0OO333<br><br>
A METHOD FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF LOVASTATTN. FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
   The present invention relates to an improved method for manufacture of Lovastatin (I) and its isolation in high purity, substantially free of impurities. <br>
5     BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
 Lovastatin or Mevinolin represented by formula (I) is a valuable hypocholesteremic drug, which inhibits biosynthesis of cholesterol by competitively inhibiting 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-coenzyme A reductase (HMG-CoA reductase). Its inhibition leads to reduction in the rate of formation of cholesterol in the human body.<br>
10<br><br>
      Lovastatin of formula (I) known chemically as (IS,3R,7S,8S,8aR)-1,2,3,7,8,8a-hexahydro-3,7Htu^ethyl-842^(2R,4R)-tetrahy<br>
15    yl]ethyl]-l-napthalenyl- (S&gt;2-methyIbutyfate is disclosed in US Patent No. 4 231 938.<br><br>
Mevinolinic Acid (II)<br>
1<br>
     Generally, Lovastatin of formula (T) is obtained through fermentation, comprising cultivating a microorganism belonging to the genus Aspergillus in an aqueous medium containing carbohydrates, yeast, inorganic salts like sodium chloride, ammonium phosphate etc assimilable by the microorganism.<br><br>
20<br><br>
 WO 2005/035515<br><br>
PCT/IN2003/000333<br><br>
The fermentation is generally carried out at ambient temperature, preferably,between 20-37°C and pH range of 6.0 to 8.0, to give mevinolinic acid of formula (II).<br>
Lovastatin (I) is obtained and isolated from the fermentation broth after lactonisation of<br>
the acid (II) in the presence of an acid.<br>
5	Several methods are known for isolation of Lovastatin (I) through lactonisation of Mevinolinic acid (II), which are summarized herein below:<br>
1.	US 4 231 938 (Monaghan R.L et al) describes a method for isolation of<br>
Lovastatin (I) from a fermentation broth which comprises obtaining Mevinolinic acid (II)<br>
by fermentation from an aqueous medium containing a microorganism known as<br>
10  Aspergillus ierreus and sources of carbon, nitrogen and inorganic salts assimilable by the microorganism The fermentation is carried out between pH 6.0 to 8.0 and temperature range of 20-37°C. The broth containing Mevinolinic acid (D) is filtered and acidified to pH 4.0 with concentrated hydrochloric acid and extracted with ethyl acetate. Evaporation of the organic layer gives impure Lovastatin (I) as syrupy oil, which is then purified by<br>
15   column chromatography on silica gel.<br>
 However, this method has little industrial application since it involves purification by chromatography.<br>
2.	BG60460A (T.G. Dimitar et al) teaches a method for isolation of Lovastatin (I),<br>
which comprises alkaline treatment of the cultured broth at pH 8.5-9.0 followed by<br>
20  filtration, acidification and extraction with an organic solvent. The organic extract after concentration is purified by ultrafiltration / reverse osmosis and finally recrystallised from ethylacetate, butyl acetate or ethanol.<br>
   The purification method involving reverse filtration or reverse osmosis, is however not attractive for industrial manufacture.<br>
25    3.  PCT Application No WO 97 / 20834 Al (Dimov I et al) describes a method for isolation of Lovastatin (I) from the culture broth which comprises treatment of the broth with an alkaline base in the presence of an anti-Oxidant and inert filler, between pH 9.5 -13.0 after which the fermentation broth is filtered and the mycelia cake is washed with a dilute solution of an alkaline base. The mixture thus obtained is acidified with a mineral<br>
30   acid between pH 2.5-4.0 to give Mevinolinic acid (II), which is filtered and dissolved in a chlorinated hydrocarbon. The acid (II) is lactonised by heating the mixture to give<br>
2<br><br>
WO 2005/035515<br><br>
PCT7IN2003/000333<br><br>
Lovastatin (I), which is then concentrated. The impure product (I) is recrystallized several times from a mixture of acetonitrile, tert-butylmethyl ether, and butyl chloride.<br>
The method, however, suffers from the following<br>
     shortcomings in that, it is lengthy involving additional unit operations of alkaline pretreatment of the culture broth<br>
5     with a base followed by acidification and filtration<br>
      to give Mevinolinic acid (II). Moreover, it utilizes  acetonitrile, which has a low flash point i.e. 2°C, which renders its use on a commercial scale a hazardous proposition.<br>
4.	US 5202029 (Hajko P et al) claims a method for purification of Lovastatin (I)<br>
using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). This method of purification is<br>
10   not suited for industrial use due to its high cost.<br>
  5.	US 5712130 (Hajko P et al) discloses a method for isolation of Lovastatin (I) by<br>
extracting the acidified fermentation broth containing Mevinolinic acid (H) with butyl<br>
acetate. The organic layer is concentrated under reduced pressure above 40°C, during<br>
which lactone formation takes place with simultaneous removal of water giving<br>
15   Lovastatin (I) with purity of 90%.<br>
 6.	US 6387258 Bl (K. Vilmos et al) describes a method of isolation and purification<br>
of statin compounds which comprises alkaline pretreatment of the fermentation broth in<br>
the presence of a hydrophobic solvent like isobutyl acetate and a de-emulsifier like<br>
dodecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride. The purified fermentation broth after acidification<br>
20    to pH between 2.0-4.5 with sulfuric acid is extracted with isobutyl acetate and the organic extract concentrated to give impure Lovastatin (I) which is purified by recrystallisation from ethanol / water mixture. The procedure is, however, lengthy involving multiple. steps of initial alkaline pretreatment, acidification, lactonisation and isolation of impure Lovastatin (I), and therefore, less attractive for industrial manufacture. It is pertinent to<br>
25   mention that the isolated yield  of Lovastatin. (I) is quite low, without alkaline pretreatment of the fermentation broth.<br>
  7; US Patent Application 2002/0156298 Al(McManus, Jet al) teaches a method for lactonisation of Mevinolinic acid (II) wherein the lactonisation is carried out with a strong mineral acid at a temperature lower than 10°C in presence of solvents like<br>
30    acetoimirile, dimethyl sulfoxide, tetrahydrofuran dioxane;<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2005/035515<br><br>
PCT/IN2003/000333<br><br>
8.	US Patent Application 5 917 058 (Y. Kumar, et al) describes a method for<br>
isolation of Lovastatin (I) using acetic acid as solvent in absence of strong acid with mild<br>
heating till 55°C.<br>
  However, isolation of Lovastatin (I) by this<br>
method is tedious since it involves<br>
5     removal of excess acetic acid by neutralization with a<br>
         base, which results in salts of acetic acid, which have to be removed thoroughly prior to crystallisation of Lovastatin (I).<br>
Another drawback is the impurity formation resulting<br>
from the esterification reaction between 3-hydroxy group of the 3-hydroxy lactone and acetic acid.<br>
9.	US Patent Application 5 939 564 (Y. Kumar, et al) teaches a method for<br>
10       lactonisation of Mevinolinic acid (II) to give Lovastatin (I) using a mild catalyst such as a<br>
pyridine salt of a mineral or organic acid for carrying out the transformation. The lactonisation is carried out in a polar alcoholic or non-alcoholic solvent at 42-45°C and the resulting Lovastatin (I) is isolated by addition of water.<br>
10.	US Patent Application 2002 / 0147351 Al (T.H.A Peters, et al) teaches a<br>
15       method for isolation of Lovastatin (I) by lactonisation of Mevinolinic acid {II) or its<br>
ammonium salt, using a lactonising agent such as methanesulfonic acid, phosphorous pentoxide, acidic ion-exchange resin, molecular sieves, acidic clay, silica gel and combinations thereof in a water miscible solvent like acetonitrile or immiscible solvent like dichloromethane at room temperature to bind water to form a insoluble complex<br>
20     which shifts the equilibrium towards lactone formation.<br>
11. PCT Application No. WO 02/00615 A2 (P. Kumar, etal) describes a method for lactonisation and isolation of Lovastatin (I) from the fermentation broth. The method comprises acidification of the broth with a mineral acid followed by lactonisation in an aqueous medium at 50-60°C. The broth is filtered and the mycelia cake extracted with an<br>
25     organic solvent, which is then concentrated to a reduced volume and subsequently filtered to give Lovastatin (I) having purity around 95%.<br>
    The method described in WO 02/00615 suffers from the following shortcomings in that, <br>
i) lactonisation of the hydroxy acid requires a long time between 20-60 hrs which is<br>
30     lengthy by any industrial manufacturing standard,<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2005/035515<br><br>
PCT/IN2003/000333<br><br>
ii)the method involves multiple unit operations, comprising initial lactonisation in an aqueous medium, followed by extraction with an organic solvent,<br>
      Moreover, it was found that replication of the method described in WO 02 / 00615 gave Lovastatin 00 with only 54% yield, which needless to mention, is not an <br>
5      attractive commercial proposition.<br>
12. US Patent Application 2003 / 0050482 Al (Lee K.H et al) relates to a method for isolation of Lovastatin (I) by lactonisation of the acid (II) or its ammonium salt in the presence of dehydrating agents like magnesium sulfate, sodium sulfate, calcium chloride, molecular sieves etc instead of an acidic medium in an inert atmosphere. Lactonisation of <br>
10    mevinolinic acid (H) is carried out at a very high temperature of 100-HQ°C. At this temperature, Lovastatin (£) is prone to degradation, giving rise to dimeric impurity, which is difficult to remove by conventional methods.<br>
  To summarise, the prior art methods for preparing Lovastatin (I) suffer from the<br>
following disadvantages:<br>
15	i)They involve sequential steps of initial alkaline pre-treatment, lactonisation of acid (II) after acidification, extraction of the lactonised product Le., Lovastatin of formula (I) with a organic solvent followed by isolation of Lovastatin of formula (I), rendering the prior art methods lengthy and tedious,<br>
ii)Formation of higher level of impurities, which are difficult to remove by<br>
20	conventional purification methods, and<br>
     iii)Utilization of expensive and highly   sophisticated purification methods such as<br>
chromatography, reverse osmosis, ultrafiltration etc, and / or use of solvents like acetonitrile having low flash points.<br>
       Regulatory authorities all over the world are becoming very stringent about the<br>
25     level of impurities in an approved drug. Especially,<br>
       there is a growing concern about the nature of impurities present in such molecules. Pharmacopoeial specification requires that the impurities such as the dimeric impurity in Lovastatin (I), which is difficult to remove by conventional methods, should be below 0.2%.<br>
       Needless, to mention most of the prior art methods do not give product <br>
30     conforming to the above mentioned criteria.<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2005/035515<br><br>
PCT/IN2003/000333<br><br>
     Therefore, there exists a need for a method for manufacture of lovastatin of the formula (I), which is not only simple, efficient, cost effective, but also gives Lovastatin (I) in high yield and purity, substantially free of impurities.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
5	     It is therefore, an object of the present invention to provide a method for the manufacture of Lovastatin of formula (I), which overcomes the shortcomings of die prior art methods.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a process for manufacture of Lovastatin (I) in high yield and purity utilising a simple, cost effective method which <br>
10    combines the steps of lactonisation and extraction with a hydrophobic solvent, thereby reducing the number of unit operations and-'time required for a single run.<br>
       Yet, another object of the invention is to reduce the time required for lactonisation of Mevinolinic acid (II) to Lovastatin (I) to approximately IS hours, as opposed to between 20-60 hours, as reported in prior art.<br>
15     A further object of the invention is to carry out the concurrent process of<br>
lactonisation and extraction of Lovastatin of formula<br>
(I)	with a hydrophobic solvent, at a temperature<br>
between 40-60°C, wherein the formation of impurities associated with elevated temperatures are minimised and gives Lovastatin (I) in higher yield and purity.<br>
Yet, a further object of the invention is isolation of Lovastatin (I) of high purity<br>
20	 by dissolving impure Lovastatin (I), in a chlorinated hydrocarbon and filtering the<br>
resinous impurities formed during lactonisation of compound (II) and fermentation of the<br>
broth. Isolating Lovastatin (I) by adding a non-polar hydrophobic solvent and distilling<br>
the chlorinated  hydrocarbon followed, by  crystallization to  give Lovastatin (I).<br>
Alternately, a mixture of a chlorinated hydrocarbon and a non-polar hydrophobic solvent<br>
25    is added to impure Lovastatin (I) and the resinous impurities filtered. Lovastatin CO (I) isolated, by distilling the chlorinated solvent followed by crystallization to give Lovastatin (I). The compound (I) is further recrystallised from an aliphatic alcohol to obtain   Lovastatin   (I)  substantially   free  from   impurities   and   conforming   to<br>
pharmacopoeial specification.<br>
30	A further object of the invention relates to optional repurification of pure Lovastatin (I) by adding a water miscible solvent and alumina to pure lovastatin (I) and<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2005/035515<br><br>
PCT/IN2003/000333<br><br>
heating the mixture between 40-60°C, filtering the mixture and isolating extra pure Lovastatin (I), substantially free from impurities and conforming to pharmacopoeial specification.<br>
     SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
5     One aspect of the present invention relates to a simple, efficient, cost effective<br>
   method for manufacture of Lovastatin (I) in good yield and purity.<br>
   Another aspect of the invention relates to a method for manufacture of Lovastatin<br>
(I) comprising,<br>
i)	   adjusting the pH of the fermentation broth containing Mevinolinic acid (II) with a<br>
10    mineral acid to pH 3.5 ±0.10.<br>
ii) heating the acidified fermentation broth or the mycelia cake in presence of a hydrophobic solvent and carrying out concurrent lactonisation, of Mevinolinic acid (II) to Lovastatin (T) and extraction of Lovastatin (I) into the hydrophobic solvent, at a temperature ranging between 40-60°C, preferably in an inert atmosphere, in a time period<br>
15    less than 20 hours.<br>
  iii) evaporating the organic layer after washing with an aqueous solution of an inorganic base followed by a water wash, and filtration to give impure Lovastatin (I), iv) isolating pure Lovastatin (I), by <br>
   a)dissolving impure Lovastatin in a chlorinated solvent or a mixture of a chlorinated<br>
20    solvent and a non-polar hydrophobic solvent, and   filtering resinous suspended impurities,<br>
b)	adding a non-polar hydrophobic solvent to the filtrate containing Lovastatin (I), if<br>
the non-polar hydrophobic solvent is not previously added and heating the<br>
mixture between 40-
25	c) fractional distillation of the filtrate to remove the chlorinated solvent and<br>
crystallization from a non-polar hydrophobic solvent to give pure Lovastatin (T), d) Lovastatin is further recrystallised from an aliphatic alcohol to give lovastatin (I), substantially   free   from   impurities   and   conforming   to   pharmacopoeial specification.<br>
30	e) ptionally, further purifying pure Lovastatin (I) thus obtained by<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2005/035515<br><br>
PCT7IN2003/000333<br><br>
f)	addition of pure Lovastatin (I) to a mixture of alumina and a water miscible solvent,<br>
g)	heating the mixture between 50-60°C, and filtering,<br>
h)	Crystallising extrapure Lovastatin (I) from the    filtrate, to give extrapure<br>
5	 Lovastatin   (I), substantially   free   from     impurities   and   conforming   to<br>
 pharmacopoeial specifications.<br>
An important finding of the present invention is<br>
that lactonisation of step (i) at a<br>
pH higher or lower than 3.5 ± 0.10 leads to formation of impurities, which eventually reduces the yield. The pH range of 3.5 ± 0.10 was found to be ideal for obtaining<br>
10   optimum yield. This observation is contrary to literature reports, which recommend a pH range from 2.0 to 4.0.<br>
      Lactonisation of Mevinolinic acid (II) with simultaneous extraction of (I) into the hydrophobic solvent minimises degradation of Lovastatin (I) in acidic medium and also shift of equilibrium in favour of lactone formation is facile, thereby reducing impurity 15 formation.<br>
   The presence of a hydrophobic solvent accelerates lactone formation contrary to prior art methods wherein the lactonisation is carried out in an aqueous medium, because of which the completion of the lactonisation reaction takes 20-60 hours.<br>
  The process of lactonisation is preferably carried put at 40-60°C, since higher <br>
20   temperature results in impurity formation, thereby decreasing the yield.<br>
      The time required for lactonisation is approximately 15 hours at 40-60°C. Prolonged time reduces the yield, presumably due to impurity formation. It is to be noted that the heating time and the benefits to be accrued thereby have not been reported in the prior art. <br>

  Mevinolinic acid of formula (II), an intermediate of Lovastatin (I) is obtained through the process of fermentation of a culture broth, which is described in US 4 231 938, US 4 049 495 and US 3 983 140.<br>
 The method practiced by the present inventors for<br>
preparing Mevinolinic acid (II)<br>
5     involves cultivating a microorganism known as Aspergillus terreus in an aqueous media containing Sources of carbon, nitrogen and inorganic salts like dextrose, sucrose, sodium acetate, citric acid assimilable by the microorganism. The fermentation is carried out at 28-30°e, maintaining a pH of 5.9-6.3 for 220-260-hrs.<br>
       The fermentation of the culture broth gives Mevinolinic acid of formula (D). A <br>
10    flow diagram of the operations for lactonisation of Mevinolinic acid (11) to Lovastatin (I) and its isolation and purification is shown in Fig. 1, the details of which are given herein below;<br>
  A. Isolation of Impure Lovastatin (I)<br>
    The: fermentation broth is cooled to a temperature<br>
      between 15 to 25°C, but<br>
15    preferably 20°C and the pH is adjusted between 3.0 to 4.0 but preferably 3.5 ±0.10 with a mineral acid. The mineral acid is selected from hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, orthophosphoric add but preferably orthophosphoric acid.  The pH at which the lactonisation is carried out is significant for the yield and quality of Lovastatin (I).<br>
       The yield of Lovastatin (I) is higher at pH 3.5 while it is lower at pH 2.0 due to <br>
20    impurity formation, which reduces the yield. The yield is the lowest at pH 4.5 as the rate of lactonisation is slow. The pH range of 3.4 to 3.6 was selected, as the yields were higher in this range.<br>
   The effect of pH on the isolated yield is shown in<br>
Figure-2.<br>
  A hydrophobic solvent selected from aromatic<br>
      hydrocarbons like toluene, xylene;<br>
25    chlorinated   solvents   like   dichloroethane,   chloroform;   but   preferably   aromatic hydrocarbon like toluene is added to the broth or the mycelia cake obtained after filtration to form a biphasic system. The mixture is heated in the range 55 ± 5°C for 12.0 hours, in an inert atmosphere free from oxygen when complete lactonisation takes place.<br>
     The rate of conversion of Mevinolinic acid (I) into Lovastatin (I) was studied, <br>
30   and it was found that unlike prior art methods, which take 20-60 hours, the present<br>
U<br><br>
WO 2005/035515<br><br>
PCT/IN2003/000333<br><br>
method required only 11 hours for the aforesaid conversion to take place. The time required for complete lactonisation is shown graphically in Figure 3.<br>
      The effect of temperature on the rate of lactonisation revealed that heating the biphasic system at higher temperatures above 85°C leads to higher amount of impurity <br>
5      formation, while lactonisation is slower at lower temperatures, i.e. below 30°C and, also layer separation is difficult.<br>
    The inert atmosphere can be nitrogen, helium, argon but preferably nitrogen.<br>
Nitrogen gas is bubbled into the reaction mixture and the mixture heated between 40-<br>
60C.	<br>
10	    Surprisingly, it has been observed that if the lactonisation is carried out in an inert atmosphere, the overall yield of isolation of 0) is increased by 4-5%. Thus, in an inert atmosphere, the yield of (T) at step (A) is 76.76%, while in the absence of nitrogen atmosphere it is 71.41%.<br>
  There is no such observation in literature about the significant effect of an inert <br>
15     atmosphere on the yield of Lovastatin (I).<br>
     The organic layer is separated and optionally<br>
the aqueous broth or the mycelia cake is again extracted with toluene and extracted at 55 ± 5°C in an inert atmosphere.<br>
Alternately, the organic layer is decanted from the mixture containing die mycelia cake, and the mycelia cake, is optionally again extracted with toluene in an inert atmosphere.<br>
20     It has been also observed that time required for lactonisation has a profound effect on the yield. The process of lactonisation and extraction is carried out for not more than 20 hours as the product has got a tendency to degrade and form impurities on prolonged heating. This is reflected in the reduced yield of impure Lovastatin (I) (Table-I)<br>

from alkali carbonates,  alkali bicarbonates, alkali hydroxides but preferably alkali<br>
bicarbonates. The alkali bicarbonates are selected from sodium bicarbonate, potassium<br>
bicarbonate  but  preferably  sodium  bicarbonate.  The  concentration  of the  alkali<br>
bicarbonates can be between 1.5-5.0% preferably 2.5% sodium bicarbonate solution.<br>
5	    The volume of sodium bicarbonate solution is<br>
        between 5.0-15.0% of the total volume of the organic<br>
        layer, but preferably 10%.<br>
   The organic layer is washed with sodium bicarbonate solution at least once followed by water washing to remove inorganic salts and impurities.<br>
         The organic layer is distilled under reduced  pressure between 30 to 45°C <br>
10      preferably 35-40°C, and the residue is crystallized from a hydrophobic solvent selected from toluene, xylene preferably toluene. The crystallized mass is filtered, washed with toluene and dried at 35-40°C under vacuum<br>
        Filtration of Lovastatin (I) slurry in toluene substantially removes non-polar<br>
impurities formed during fermentation and lactonisation of compound (II).<br>
15	    In a specific embodiment, the fermentation broth containing Mevinolinic acid of formula (IF) was cooled to 20°C and the pH of the mixture adjusted to 3,5 ±0.1 with 85% orthophosphoric acid and the broth optionally filtered.<br>
              Toluene was added to the broth or the mycelia cake. The volume of toluene added was 1.5 to 1.6 times volume by weight of the broth, preferably 1.4 times volume by <br>
20      weight of the fermentation broth.<br>
      Nitrogen gas was then bubbled into the mixture containing Mevinolinic acid of formula (II) and the mixture heated to 55 ± 5°C. The mixture was agitated at the same temperature for 12.0 hours and the organic layer separated.<br>
      The fermentation broth or the mycelia cake is optionally further extracted with <br>
25      toluene to improve the efficiency of the batch process.<br>
       The organic extracts containing Lovastatin (I) thus obtained were combined and washed with 2.5% sodium bicarbonate solution, the volume of the bicarbonate solution used was 10% of the total organic layer.    .<br>
       The organic layer was separated and washed  with water, the volume of water <br>
30      taken being 10% of the volume of the combined organic extracts.<br>

      The organic layer was distilled under reduced pressure between 35-40°C, and Lovastatin (I) was isolated from the residue by adding a organic solvent preferably toluene. The volume of toluene added is selected from between 3-8% volume of the organic layer distilled, preferably 4-6% volume of the total volume of the organic layer <br>
5     distilled. The mixture was cooled between (0±10°C) preferably (-5±1°C), stirred for a period between 2-10 hours preferably 4.0 hours and filtered. The wet cake was washed with chilled toluene (0°C) and the wet cake dried between 30-40°C. <br>
        B. Purification of Lovastatin (I)<br>
       	 Generally, Lovastatin (T) isolated after lactonisation by any method, needs further <br>
10      purification as it contains oily resinous mass, nutrients added during cultivation of the fermentation broth, and related impurities introduced during fermentation and subsequent lactonisation of the hydroxy acid (II). The product (I) thus obtained therefore needs further purification.<br>
         The present invention provides a method for purification, which purifies <br>
15      Lovastatin (I) by a simple method involving readily available solvents and which are non-hazardous for industrial use.<br>
       Impure Lovastatin (I) obtained by lactonisation of<br>
