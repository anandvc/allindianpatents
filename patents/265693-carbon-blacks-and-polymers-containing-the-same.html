CAIffiONBIACKS AND POLYMERS CONTAINING THE SAME<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] The pre^nt ixrvcation relates to covd caibon bkcjcs, as weU as polymers containing the carbon blades, and an enhancesnmt in propeardes, sadti as polym^ perfi^nnaace andthelikc.<br>
[0002} Caiboxi black is used in a number of polymear compounds, such as those found m aaylonitrlte-butadiotie-styrene (ABS) molding applicationfi. Carbon black-filled polymer compounds, sucb as carbon black-filled ABS and ABS-alloys (blends of ABS vnSx oiQier polynxQ^)&gt; are used in numerous hi^-p«xfonnaiice polymer applications where a balance of coIor» medianica] properties, and siir&amp;ce appearance is preferred. The ^e and amount of carbon black used in Ihepo^er canhavca vai^gefifectoolfaeproperdes ofihe compound. For instance^ increasing Ihe loading of carbon black can improve the cotor (e.g., the compound has higher jetnes$)» but the mechanical properties and/or sur&amp;ce ^jpearance may be degraded with hi^r loadings. Tiicre is a desire m ikt polymer industry to have a caibon biadk that can achieve comparable or better jetness» blue tone, impact str^igth^ and/or sur&amp;ce appearance (smoo&amp;ness) when compounded into a polymer, but at a loadmg ibat is lower than cuxrent conventional loadings* Adiieving equal color at a lower loading can involve u^g a cacbon blacjc with a higher sur&amp;ce area. However&gt; increasing the sur&amp;ce area of carbon black typically causes the carbon blac^ to become difGcuIt to disperse. Furlfa^, poc^ disp^ion of the carbon black reside in a loss of mechanical propeali^ and/or sur&amp;ce appearance* Thus, it would be desirable to d&amp;nlop a hi^-surfkce area carbon black fiaat can be prs&amp;nibly readily (Uspersed in polymers^ sudi as ABS, to attain an accqrtable level of various mechanical properties (such as impact resistance) and sur&amp;ce appearance.<br><br>

BRIEF DESCRIFnON OF DRAWINGS<br>
[0014]      Fig. 1 is five photogr^hs showing san^le dispersion ratings*<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION [0015]      The pres^ invention relates to novel carbon biacks; as welt as methods to make the carbon blades. The present inventi<m also rdates to use of these carbon blades in various polym inciudui but not limi aa>-styraie (ABS).<br><br>
I0pl6] WMi req^ect to the carbon black, tbe carbon black of the present invention has de^rabb morphology mi intei&amp;ciai piop^es that mdke it beneficial in various applications, such as tiie use of the carbon blade in polymer q&gt;pIications like ABS molding ^^lications. [0017] In more det2ul» in at least one embodinaent, the carbon black of fte present invention pTekrMy has one or more of tibie Mowing diree characteristics and preferably has all of the following three dmract^isdcs:<br>
(a)	an Iodine number of &amp;&gt;m about 150 to about 600 mg/g. Other ranges can include an Iodine number of jSrom about 265 to about 600 m^g, frcxn about 350 mg/g to about 600 mg/g» or from about 400 mg/g to about 600 mg/g;<br>
(b)	a DBF absozption of from about 40 to about 90 cc/lOOg. OUasr ranges can include from about SO to about 90 cc/lOOg, from about 60 to about 90 cc/lOOg, or from about 70toabout90cc/100g;<br>
(c)	a ratio of nitrogen sur^ice area/statistical thickness sur&amp;ce area of from about 125 ID about 1.70. Other ranges can include from about 1.30 to about 1-70 or fix»m about 1*40 to about 1-70.<br>
[0018] In addition, in at least one embodiment, the carbon black of frie preseid; invention has one or more of the following additional properties:<br>
(d)	a jetness value as dettimined by Tearlon L* of L7 or less, OSaar ranges can include from about 0*4 to about 1.7» or from about 0,4 to about I.l;<br>
(e)	a water spreading pressure value of 23.0 mJ/m^ or less. Other ranges mclude from about 12,0 to about 23.0 mJ/m^ or from about 12.0 to about 21.5 mJ/m^.<br>
[0019] With respect to the Iodine number, this number is measured following ASTM D1510, With respect to the DBF absorption, this property is detOTnined following ASTM D2414. Witii respect to tbe nitrogen surface area and ihe statistical tibiokness sur&amp;ce area, these measurements were made following ASTM D6S56*<br><br>
[0020] Wiai respect to the jetaess as determined by Terlon L*, this procedure uses a C3ELAB color scale. L* is a measure of &amp;e jetness of the carbon black after making an oil-based paste; a lower value is more jet The absolute L* value is used. In detennining jetness, the carbon blade was dried at 125** C for 3 hours and then conditioned in a mixer for 45 seconds. 2*0 g of Terlon #1 Oil was then added to the lower plate of a Hoover Muller, into which 100 mg of the carbon blade was slowly added witii a spatula. After gathering the matoial in the center of the lower plate, the top plal» was put in place and 4he Hoover MuUer plates spun for 50 revolutions to mix the oil and carbon blade The plates were then opened, and the process of ^fliering ifae material and spinning Ssr 50 revoludons was repeated three more times. The ^tire quantity of the paste was then smoothed onto a glass plate. The 1976 CIELAB L* value was measured in four dififerent locations on llie plate usmg a Hunter Labscan XE wifli VSI, using liie following conditions: Mode ** 0/45, Port Size = 1.2 mches, Area View = 1 inch. UV Filter -= Out, Light Souice « D65 with 10** Observer. The value reported is the median of the four absolute L* values. Simultaneously, the 1976 CIELAB b* value (bluetone) is also measured and recorded by fte Hunter Labscan in an analogous way.<br>
[0021] Water ^nreading pressure is a measure of tiie interaciion energy between the caibon black sur&amp;ce and water vapc^. The spreading pressure is measured by observmg the mass inca-ease of a sample as it adsorbs water fi-om a controlled atmosphere. In &amp;e tes^ the relative humidity (RH) of the atmosphere around die sample is mcreased from 0% (pure nitrogen) to --100% (water-saturated mtrogcaa). If the sample and atmosphere are always in equilibrium, the water spreading pressure (TIC) of the sample is defined as:<br>
vAere i? is tiie gas constant, T is fte temperature, -4 is the specific suifece area of the<br><br>
sample, T is the amount of adsorbed water on the sample (converted to moles/gm), P is the partial pressure of water in the atmosphere, and Pe is the saturation vapor pressure m the atmosphere. In practice, Hje equilibrium adsorption of water on Ae surfece is measured at cme or (prefisrably) several discrete partial pressures and the integral is estimated by the area under the curve. Alternative measurements of *e interfedal prop^es or sur^<br>
be ^ecified, e.g., by not dividing by the surfece area, or ly addmg other mtttfecial properties or surfiaoe energy terms to the water spreading pressure^ or by approximating the integral widi a small number, even possibly as few as one, data points, or nsmg other gases. [0022] The jvocedure for measming the wat^ spreading pressure is detailed m ^'Dynamic Vapor Soiption Using Water, Standard Operating Procedure", rev, 02/08/05 (incozporated in its entirety by reference herein), and is summarized here. Before analysis, 100 mg of the carbon biadk to be analyzed was dried in an oven at 123^ C for 30 minotes-Ader ensuring that the incubator in the Surface Measurement Systems DVSl Instrument (supplied by SMS Instruments, Monarch Beach, California) bad been stable at 25^ C for 2 hours, sample cups were loaded in boft fbt sample and reference chambers. The tai^et RH was set to 0% for 10 minutes to dry the cups and to establish a stable mass baselme. After disdiatging static and taring the balance, (^proTdmately S mg of carbon black was added to the cup in the sample cjiamber Afber sealing the sample chamber, the sample was allowed to equihTsrate at 0% KEi Aflaer equilftxation, ±t initial mass of the sample was recorded, TTie relative humidity of the nitrogen atmosphere was then increased sequentially to levels of approximately 5,10,20,30,40,50,60,70,78,87, and 92% RH, with the system allowed to equilibrate for 20 minutes at each RH level. The mass of water adsozbed at each hmnidity level was recorded, from which water spreadtog pressure was calculated (see above). The measurem^t was done twice on two s^arate samples and the average value is rqfjoited* [0025]      In anotibw embodiment of the present invention, the present inveotlon rdatcs to<br><br>
c«(rbon black "which is capable of achieving certaJn properties when compounded in ABS foiiowii^ a particular procedure, in more detail, in one raibodiment of the present invention, the carbon black» when compounded in ABS at a carbon black loading of 1.5 wt% or less (for instance, at a carbon black loading of OJ wt% to U oveiEBlI wei^t of the con^unded material, aciuevcs a jetness (in Hie overall compounded material), measured as confound L* of 4,6 or less (othw: jetness values for the compounded material can be e,g., 3.0 to 4,6 or 3-0 to 4.4) and tfie carbon black permits the compounded material to have one or both of the following properties:<br>
(a)	a COTipound notched izod impact strengfli of 13,600 J/m^ or greater (p&amp;ics ranges include fiom about 13^600 J/m^ to about 18,000 J/m^ frwn about 14,000 to about 17,000 JAn^) and/or<br>
(b)	a conopound dispersion ra^ in a press-out test of 4.0 or less (oth^ ranges include e,g.» fiom about 1.0 to about 4.0 or dom about 1.0 to about 3.0). The carbcm blade in this embodiment has these properties for at least one carbon blade loading level in diis range of 1,5 WLH or less.<br>
[0024]      Witii respect to these parameters that tiie carlxm black promotes in an ABS when<br>
compounded in the ABS, the following test procedures aie used.<br>
[002S]      The ABS compounds were produced in a three step compounding procedure (at<br>
times referred to as **lhe three step ABS compounding procedure*'): First, a 30% SAN<br>
masterbstch was prq}ared, which was &amp;en dUuted to 5% with ABS, before being let down<br>
to 0.50% to 1,50% Witt) additional ABS in a final mjection molding step.<br>
[0026]      Masterbatxdx Compound; The SAN masterbatch was prepared by mixing<br>
carbon black (CB), lyil 124 SAN (Density -1080 kg/m^ 230'C/3.8kg MFI» 22 ^'lOrnin),<br>
and Zinc Stearate (ZnSt) in fiie following prt^rtions by wei^t 30.0% CB, 69-5% SAJST,<br>
and 0.5% ZnSt, to give a total mass of the three componwits of 1413 g. The components<br><br>
were mixed in a Banbory JBtemal nuxer (1570 ml) with the following settings: Rotor Speed = Setting 2, lUm Pressure = 3 kg/cm^ Mtial Temperamre =* 70 ^^^<br>
« 90 s, and Feeding Factor " 75%,<br>
[00271 5% ABS Compound: lie SAN masterbatch was first ground to remove dust and small particles, 250 g of the SAN masterbatch was then mixed witii 1250 g of Cycolac GPMS500 ABS Pensity - 1050 kg/m^ 220*'C/10kg MFI - 24 g/lOmin, 23 "C Notx^ Impact (ISO180/1A) - 18000 J/m^ to produce a 5% ABS compound. This procedure was carried out on a Betol BK32 single screw esdrudw equipped with a disttibutive mixing Wd (cavity transfer mixer (CTM)) to improve it$ dispersive capabilities. The extnkte had the following temperature setting tarn the feeder to the ^fie: Zonel == ISO'^C, Zon^ ^ 185*C, Zones - IPO^'C. Zone4 =» 195^C, CIM ^ 210*'C, Die * 200X, The screw speed was 80 ipm and one pass was used durmg compounding*<br>
[0028] 050 -1-50% ABS Compound: The 5% ABS compounds were diluted to tiieir final loading in a Battenfeld BA500/200CD injection*molding machine. The total mass of material used was 600 g, with the proportions of 5% ABS compound and pure C^obac GPM5500 ABS selected to give the correct final loading. Before mjection, the ABS compounds and the ABS resin were dried for 17 hours at 80*C under vacuum. Betwe«i each sample, 500 g of pure ABS was mjected to clean the equipmcait. The esact injection molding parameters depended on the test that the part was to be subjected to (see below): [0029] Q)lor (L*) Plaques: 90 x 55 x 2 mm plaques for color analysis were prepared using the followmg temperature settings on the injection molding madiine: Nozzle = 225°Q Zonel « 235**C, Zone2 « 250*C, Zone3 ^ 250'»C, Mold ^ 60«C. The mjcction speed was 20%»<br>
[0030]      Izod Impact Bars: 63i x 12.7 x 6,4 mm bars (BO 180 Type 3) for Izod impact testing Wtt^ pr^ared u^ng Ave following tCTiperature settings on the mjection molding<br><br>
machine: Nozzle « 225*C, Zonel - 235*C, 2oiie2 - 250**C, Zone3 = 250^C, Mold = 25'C. Tlie injeoaon speed was 60%.<br>
[0031] Widi respect to Ifae jetness for ^ compound ^ conipound L* is an absohite value. L* is a measure of the jetness of tfat compound; a lower value is more jet. To measure fte compound L% sfac 90 X 55 X 2 mm color plaques with the desired loading waie p^ by injection molding as described above. All plaques were inspected to ensure that th^ bad a uniform color on the sur&amp;ce, and to diecd: tot any pips or streaks. Plaques lliat did not meet tiiese criteria were discarded. Each plaque was then tested once £br the 1976 CIELAB L* value with a DATAC01X)R SF600 ^ectrophotocolorimeter, using the following conditions: Calibration Mode - Reflectance, Specular Door - Bxclude4 Visualization -LAV (30 mm), UV * Included, Condition = % R LAV SO E UV inc., Light Source ^ D65 with 10*^ Observer^ The value reported is tiie av^age of &amp;e six plaques and is the absolute L* value^ not a diderence between the sample and a reforesice. Simuttaneousty, the 1976 CIELAB b'' value (bluctone) of &amp;e compound was measured and recorded by the Datacolor instrument in an analogous way.<br>
[0032] W&amp;i tespcct to detamining &amp;e notched Izod impact strength of tiie compounded mat^al, tiie test was generally based on the GSO 180-19S2 standard, but diSbred in the injection molding procecbire of the test bars. The ^st method is described below. [0033] Ten 63 i x 12.7 x 6A mm bars (ISO 180 Type 3) with the desired loading were prepared by iqjection molding as described above. A smgle ixotch (ISO 180 Type A) was then cut in each bar with a notchmg device (CEAST 6530). The sample was loaded with the notch feeing tiic direction of impact and tested wife a 5^ J pendulum-type hammer (CEA.ST 6545/000). If a bar showed bubbles or holes along tiie fifacture point, it was discarded. The measured impact strength of acceptable samples was recorded and the reported value is the average of the ten bars, Un-notched Izod hnpact strcfigft can be measured by following the<br><br>
same procedure but without cutting the notch in the test bar.<br>
[0034] 11K dispersion rating in the pres$-out test of &amp;e compoimded material is described below. The disperaon rating is a senii-quaatitative naeasure of carbon black diq^ersion in the compound; a lower vahie equals better 
[0035J Two 0,3 mg '^buttons" were cut from three different color plaques (pr^andon described above) yielding six buttons. Each button was placed cm a clean microscope slide and covered with anotito slide* The assembly was pressed-out at 210** C for 3 minutes, with enough pressure to obtain a 5 mm button diameter. Each butUm was eicamiaed at 200X and lOOX magnification m a light microscope* A rsSing of 1-5 was Ihen assigned to each button, with 1 corresponding to a good dispersion and 5 to a bad dispersion. In ass^mng tbe dispersion rating, good diversion implies a &amp;w black spots were visible TASTC&amp;S bad dispersion hnplies a lot of blade spots or larger aggregates. More spedlicaUy, the dispersion rating is assigned by counting the number of visible particles greater than 1 fxm in a 651 }jm X 487 pm area under lOOX magnification. The number of particles determmes the dispersion rating: 1 = 0-10 particles, 2 « 11-30 parades, 3 = 31-60 partidcs, 4 = 6M50 particles, 5 ~ more than ISO particles. The cSspersion rating of each sample is the avemge from the six buttons* Figure 1 is photographs showing an example of con^Knmds with dispersion ratings from 1 to 5.<br>
[0036] With respect to manufacturing the carbon blades^ the carbon blades can be made as follows.
