				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION<br>
CONSTRAINING STRUCTURE FOR SLIDING DOOR OF VEHICLE<br>
BACKGROLIND OF THE INVENTION AND RELATED ART STATEMENT<br>
1.	FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a constraining structure of a sliding door for a vehicle, which improves the holding strength of the sliding door against a load applied from the cabin side.<br>
2.	DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Conventionally, at the side of a vehicle body, there has been provided a sliding door that opens and closes a door opening at the side of the vehicle body by being slid in the forward and rearward directions of a vehicle.    Such a sliding door is disclosed, for example, in JP 2006-35881 A.<br>
For the above-described sliding door, a striker projecting to the door open side is provided in the vertical direction on a vertical surface of an opening end edge of the door opening, and a hook member provided with an engagement claw that is bent to the cabin side is provided on a door end surface facing to the vertical surface in correspondence to the striker.    When the door is closed, the engagement claw of the hook member is made to face the striker from the outside of vehicle.    When the door is pushed in to the cabin side by a side collision etc. of the vehicle, the engagement claw intrudes into the striker, and an internal angular part of the engagement claw engages with a distal end vertical side of the striker, by which the movement into the door opening is restrained.    Thereby, when the sliding door is pushed in to the cabin side at the time of a side collision of vehicle, the movement deformation of the sliding door to the cabin side is restrained by connecting the end edge of the sliding door to the door opening edge with a high engagement force.<br><br>
However, the above-described conventional constraining structure of a vehicular sliding door is a structure for constraining the sliding door when the sliding door is pushed in from the vehicle outside to the cabin side.    Therefore, in the case in which a load is applied to the sliding door from the cabin side to the vehicle outside, for example, when equipment. passengers, cargo, and the like on the cabin side collide with the sliding door, there arises a problem in that the movement of the sliding door cannot be restrained effectively.    Also, since a space for fixing the hook member must be secured, this constraining structure carmot be arranged in a limited space, which presents a problem in that the application of the conventional constraining structure is limited to specific vehicle types.    Furthermore, since the hook member must be provided separately to restrain the movement of sliding door, the conventional constraining structure has a disadvantage in that the number of parts is increased, which results in an increase in cost.<br>
OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances, and accordingly an object thereof is to provide a constraining structure for a vehicular sliding door, which can constrain the sliding door to effectively restrain the movement of sliding door without hindering the usual opening and closing operation of sliding door even at a place at which a space is difficult to secure when a load is applied to the sliding door toward the cabin outside.<br>
To solve the problems with the above-mentioned conventional art, the present invention provides a constraining structure of a vehicular sliding door for opening and closing a door opening in a vehicle body side surface by sliding the sliding door in the forward and rearward directions of the vehicle, wherein a striker is arranged on a vehicle body-side vertical wall surface facing the door opening so as to form a U-shaped plane as<br><br>
viewed from the vehicle body side surface side: an insertion hole through which the striker is inserted in the state in which the sliding door is closed is provided in a sliding door-side vertical wall surface; and a pair of notch parts capable of being engaged with the striker are provided on the cabin side of the insertion hole, by which the striker is engaged with the notch parts when a load is applied to the sliding door from the cabin side to the cabin outside.<br>
Also, in the present invention, a reinforcing member is provided ranging from the sliding door-side vertical wall surface to the cabin side in the range in which the insertion hole is provided.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, a through hole is provided in a surface for reinforcing the sliding door-side vertical wall surface of the reinforcing member, and the through hole is provided with an edge part formed with a pair of notch parts so as to substantially coincide with an edge part on the cabin side capable of engaging with the striker.<br>
Also, an L-shaped gusset formed with a bent piece part which comes into contact with the wall surface between a pair of notch parts provided in the wall surface located on the cabin side of the reinforcing member, and the bent piece part extends toward the cabin outside and is formed so as to have a length such that the distal end thereof does not project into the insertion hole and the through hole.<br>
Also, in the present invention, a case which forms a closed cross section by covering the insertion hole, is provided at the location of the insertion hole.<br>
As described above, the present invention provides the constraining structure of a vehicular sliding door for opening and closing the door opening in the vehicle body side surface by sliding the sliding door in the forward and rearward directions of vehicle.    The constraining structure of a vehicular sliding door in accordance with the present invention is configured so that the striker is arranged on the vehicle body-side vertical wall surface facing to the door opening so as to form the U-shaped plane as viewed from the vehicle body side<br><br>
surface side; the insertion hole through which the striker is inserted in the state in which the sliding door is closed is provided in the sliding door-side vertical wall surface; and the paired notch parts capable of being engaged with the striker are provided on the cabin side of the insertion hole, by which the striker is engaged with the notch parts when a load is applied to the sliding door from the cabin side to the cabin outside.    Therefore, at the time of normal opening and closing operation of sliding door, the striker does not interfere with a constraining part of the sliding door, so that the opening and closing operation of sliding door can be performed smoothly.    Also, the usual sliding door opening and closing locus is set so that the striker does not interfere with the constraining part of sliding door.<br>
Moreover, according to the constraining structure in accordance with the present invention, in the case in which a load directed from the cabin side to the cabin outside is applied to the sliding door, for example, when equipment, passengers, cargo, and the like on the cabin side collide with the sliding door, the striker engages with the notch part of the insertion hole constituting the constraining part of the sliding door.    Therefore, unlike the conventional art, the constraining function of the sliding door due to the striker and the notch parts can be performed without providing a hook member separately, and the movement in the vehicle width direction of the sliding door can be restrained effectively.    Also, the position in the height direction of the constraining position of sliding joor can be regulated reliably.    Therefore, an increase in the number of parts and hence an increase in cost do not occur.    Also, since a space for fixing the hook member is not needed, the constraining part of sliding door can be provided even at a limited location, so that the constraining structure in accordance with the present invention has high versatility.<br>
Also, in the present invention, the reinforcing member is provided ranging from the sliding door-side vertical wall surface to the cabin side in the range in which the insertion hole is provided.    Specifically, the through hole is provided in the surface for reinforcing the<br><br>
sliding door-side vertical wall surface of the reinforcing member, and the through hole is provided with the edge part formed with the paired notch parts so as to substantially coincide with the edge part on the cabin side capable of engaging with the striker.    Also, the L-shaped gusset formed with the bent piece part which comes into contact with the wail surface between the paired notch parts provided in the wall surface located on the cabin side of the reinforcing member, and the bent piece part extends toward the cabin outside and is formed so as to have a length such that the distal end thereof does not project into the insertion hole and the through hole.    Therefore, the constraining part of the sliding door can be reinforced, and can be held even if the sliding door moves in the rotation direction toward the cabin outside.<br>
Furthermore, in the present invention, the case which forms a closed cross section by covering the insertion hole is provided at the location of the insertion hole.    Therefore, the rigidity of the constraining part of the sliding door can be increased.    Also, water can be prevented from intruding into the inside of door, and the appearance of the door opening can be improved.<br>

In the drawings, arrow mark F indicates the vehicle front, arrow mark I indicates the direction of cabin inside, arrow mark 0 indicates the direction of cabin outside, and arrow mark P indicates the rotation direction of the shding door.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1, on a vehicle body side surface (side body) 11 of a motor vehicle 1, a plurality of doors for opening and closing door openings, described later, which serve as entrances for passengers, arc dksposed.    Specifically, on the front side of the vehicle body side surface 11, a front door 2 is arranged which is opened and closed by turning the vehicle rear side around a hinge mechanism (not shown) aiTanged at the opening end edge on the vehicle front side, and on the vehicle rear side adjacent to the front door 2, a sliding door 3 is arranged which is opened and closed by sliding along the vehicle body side surface 11 in the forward and rearward directions of vehicle.<br>
Therefore, as shown in FIGS. 2 to 4, the sliding door 3 is supported so as to be capable of being slid with respect to the vehicle body side surface 11 by an upper roller 4 provided at the front end of the upper edge on the cabin side and a lower roller 5 provided at the front end of the lower edge on the cabin side.    The upper roller 4 is rotatably attached to the distal end of an upper arm 6 projecting toward the cabin side, and is fitted in a guide rail 7 having a substantially U-shaped cross section provided on the vehicle body opening side so as to extend in the forward and rearward directions of vehicle.    Also, the lower roller 5 is rotatably attached to the distal end of a lower arm 8 projecting toward the cabin side, and is fitted in a guide rail 9 having a substantially U-shaped cross section provided on the vehicle body opening side so as to extend in the forward and rearward directions of vehicle.    The<br><br>
proximal end of the upper arm 6 is fixed to the upper edge part on the cabin side of the sliding door 3 by being tightened by screws or the like, and the proximal end of the lower arm 8 is fixed to the lower edge part on the cabin side of the shding door 3 by being tightened by screws or the like.<br>
In the case in which equipment, passengers, cargo, and the like in the cabin side collide with the inner surface of the shding door 3 at the time of side collision of the motor vehicle 1, the upper and lower guide rails 7 and 9 restrain the upper roller 4 and the lower roller 5, respectively, from coming off to the cabin outside so as to prevent the sliding door 3 from coming off.    ffowever, since the distance betw/ecn the upper and lower restraint locations is long, the upper roller 4 and the lower roller 5 may come off the upper and lower guide rails 7 and 9, respectively, in the case in which a middle part in the up and down direction of the sliding door 3 is deformed greatly.<br>
Accordingly, in the constraining structure in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, a constraining part (refer to portion C in FIG. 1 and portion D in FIG. 2) for holding the middle part in the up and down direction of the sliding door 3 and restraining the movement thereof when a load is applied to the sliding door 3 toward the cabin outside is provided in the middle part in the up and down direction of the sliding door 3.    This constraining pari is described in detail below.<br>
As shown in FIGS. 5 to 9, in the constraining structure of this embodiment, a striker 12 constituting the constraining part is provided on a vehicle body-side vertical wall surface 11a extending in the thickness direction so as to face to a door opening 10 in the vehicle body side surface 11 that is opened and closed by the sliding door 3.    The mounting position in the height direction of the striker 12 is set near the central position in the up and down direction between the upper roller 4 and the lower roller 5 provided at the upper and lower ends on the front side of the sliding door 3.    Also, as shown in FIG. 5 and FIGS. 7 to 9, the<br><br>
striker 12 is fixed by being tightened by using screws 13 so that the opening forms a U-shaped plane located on the vehicle front side as viewed from the vehicle body side surface 11 side.    A U-shaped part 12a projects toward the door opening 10, and a central bar part is arranged along the up and down direction of the vehicle.<br>
The vehicle body-side vertical wall surface 1 la to which the striker 12 is fixed constitutes the rear surface of a center pillar (B pillar), and on the back surface side thereof, a pillar reinforcement 14 is mounted.    Also, on the back surface of the pillar reinforcement 14, a retainer 15 and a retainer case 16 are arranged so as to correspond to the mounting location of the striker 12.    The striker 12 is tightened by the screws 13 together with the retainer 15 and the retainer case 16.    Therefore, at the corresponding locations of the striker 12, the vehicle body-side vertical wall surface 11 a of the vehicle body side surface 11, the pillar reinforcement 14, the retainer 15, and the retainer case 16, mounting holes through which the screws 13 are inserted are formed.<br>
Also, as shown in FIGS. 6, 7 and 9, in the constraining structure of this embodiment, in a sliding door-side vertical wall surface 3a in the thickness direction facing to the door opening 10 of the vehicle body side surface 11, an insertion hole 31 forming the constraining part is provided.    ITie insertion hole 31 is formed at the corresponding position such that the U-shaped part 12a of the striker 12 can be inserted through the insertion hole 31 in the state in which the sliding door 3 is closed, and is also formed so as to have a size and shape capable of allowing the striker 12 to be inserted through.    The insertion hole 31 basically has a rectangular shape as viewed from the front, and in the upper and lower edge parts on the cabin side of the upper and lower edge parts of an opening edge, semicircular notch parts 31a curved toward the cabin side at the same pitch as the central bar part of the U-shaped part 12a of the striker 12 are provided so as to be capable of engaging with the U-shaped part 12a of the striker 12.<br><br>
Furthermore, in the constraining structure of this embodiment, as shown in FIGS. 7 and 9, in order to reinforce the surroundings of the insertion hole 31, a Z-shaped reinforce 33 of a reinforcing member having a through hole 32 formed with notch parts 32a in the upper and lower edge parts on the cabin side like the insertion hole 31 is provided on an outside wall surface, the sliding door-side vertical wall surface 3a, and an inside wall surface ranging from the cabin outside to the cabin side.<br>
On the wall surface on which the Z-shaped reinforce 33 is located on the cabin side, an L-shaped gusset 34 of a reinforcing member formed with a bent piece part 34a that comes into contact with the wall surface between the upper and lower notch parts 32a of the through hole 32 is provided.    The bent piece part 34a extends toward the cabin outside, and is formed so as to have a length such that the distal end thereof does not project into the through hole 31 and the through hole 32.<br>
The L-shaped gusset 34 is formed by using a thick sheet of material to provide high rigidity as compared with the panel of the sliding door 3 and the Z-shaped reinforce 33. Also, in the case in which the bend height of the bent piece part 34a of the L-shaped gusset 34 is set so as to be ipproximately equal to 'ie diameter of the bar of the striker 12, the distal end of the U-shaped part 12a r  the striker   .' is brought into contact with the suriaoe of the gusset 34 along the wall surface; on the cabi;&gt; side of the sliding door 3, so that the striker 12 can be supported by not only ihc engagement part but also an extensive surface.      o give an extensive support surface to the striker 12 in this maimer, the surface arranged ah ag the wall surface on the cabin side of the L-shaped gusset 34 is preferably formed into a transverse T shape as viewed from the side as shown in FIG. 9.<br>
Also, at a location at which the insertion hole 31 of the sliding door-side vertical wall surface 3a and the through hole 32 of the Z-shaped reinforce 33 are provided, as shown in FIGS. 7 and 9, a case 35 that forms a closed cross section by covering the insertion hole 31<br><br>
and the through hole 32 from the inside of the sliding door 3 is provided.    Therefore, the case 35 is arranged in a comer part of the sliding door-side vertical wall surface 3a and the inside wall surface, and the intermediate part thereof is formed so as to have a substantially crank-shaped cross section such as to expand toward the inside of the sliding door 3.<br>
Since the configuration is such that the Z-shaped reinforce 33, the L-shaped gusset 34, and the case 35 are provided as described above, a high strength can be given to the cabin-side edge part at the opening edge of the insertion hole 31 and the cabin-side wall surface of the sliding door 3.<br>
Next, the operation of the constraining structure of the sliding door 3 in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention at the time when a load directed from the cabin side to the cabin outside is applied to the sliding door 3.<br>
As shown in FIG 7, in the normal state in which a load directed from the cabin side to the cabin outside is not applied, the end edge part of the insertion hole 31 of the sliding door 3 slides along the locus indicated by arrow mark S to open and close the door opening 10. Therefore, the sliding door 3 does not come into contact with the striker 12, so that the conventional opening and closing operation of the sliding door 3 is not impaired.<br>
On the other hand, as shown in FIG. 10, when a high load is applied from the cabin side to the cabin outside (the arrow mark O direction) and the sliding door 3 is pushed out to the cabin outside, the edge end part of the insertion hole 31 provided in the sliding door-side vertical wall surface 3 a in the thickness direction of the sliding door 3, the notch parts 32a of the through hole 32 of the Z-shaped reinforce 33, and the bent piece part 34a of the L-shaped gusset 34 engage with the central bar part of the U-shaped part 12a of the striker 12 provided on the vehicle body-side vertical wall surface 11a, so that the movement deformation of the sliding door 3 to the cabin outside is restrained.    Moreover, the sliding door 3 tends to rotate in the direction indicated by the arrow mark P, the sliding door 3 can be held by the<br><br>
constraining part.<br>
As described above, in the constraining structure of the sliding door 3 in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, in the state in which a load is applied from the cabin side to the cabin outside, whereby the sliding door 3 is pushed out to the cabin outside. and the striker 12 comes into contact "with the end edge on the cabin side of the insenion hole 31, the semicircular upper and lower notch parts 31a of the insertion hole 31 engage with the central bar part of the U-shaped part 12a of the striker 12, and the bent piece part 34a of the L-shaped gusset 34 is located between the upper and lower notch parts 31a.    Therefore, the rigidity of the constraining part of the sliding door 3 can be increased, the constraining part is not deformed easily by the load directed to the cabin outside, and the striker 12 is firmly held in the insertion hole 31, so that there is no fear that the striker 12 will come off.<br>
Also, the comer part formed by the sliding door-side vertical wall surface 3a in the thickness direction of the sliding door 3 in which the striker 12 is inserted and the wall surface on the cabin side is provided with a very high strength by the Z-shaped reinforce 3, the L-shaped gusset 34, and the case 35, so that the opening of the sliding door 3 can be constrained surely via the striker 12.    Moreover, since the constraining part on the sliding door 3 side is directly formed on the sliding door-side vertical wall surface 3a in the thickness direction of the sliding door 3, unlike the conventional art, a part for locking need not be installed separately, so that a constraining mechanism can be provided even in a Iknited space.    Also, the reinforcing member is joined to the cabin-side surface of the sliding door 3 mainly covered with a door trim, so that joining operation can be performed without paying attention to weld flaws as compared with the surface on the cabin outside that forms a design surface.<br>
Furthermore, in the constraining structure of the sliding door 3 in accordance with the embodiment of the present invention, the mounting position of the striker 12 and the forming<br><br>
position of the insertion hole 31 are set near the center in the up and down direction of the upper roller 4 and the lower roller 5 provided a the upper and lower end, respectively, on the vehicle front side of the sliding door 3.    Therefore, stress is distributed efficiently to the cabin outside by the three-point support (refer to FIG. 2).    Also, at the mounting location of the striker 12, the pillar reinforcement 14 is provided, and the striker 12 is tightenediy fixed to the vehicle body-side vertical wall smi"ace 11 a of the vehicle body side surface 11 in such a manner as to hold the pillar reinforcement 14 made of a thick sheet being held between the striker 12 and the retainer 15.    Therefore, the rigidity of the seat surface of the striker 12 is increased, so that the mounting strength can be improved (refer to FIG. 7).<br>
In addition, on the back surface side of the pillar reinforcement 14 at the mounting location of the striker 12, the retainer 15 and the retainer case 16 are arranged.    The retainer 15 is not welded to the retainer case 16, and the striker 12 is fixed to the retainer 15 by being tightened by the screws 13.    Therefore, the striker 12 can be moved by loosening the screws 13, so that the positional adjustment can be made when the striker 12 is mounted.    Such a construction is effective especially in the case in which the asserrjbling accuracy of door is unstable.<br>
The above is a description of the embodiment of the present invention.    The present invention is not limited to the above-described embodiment, and various modifications and changes can be made based on the technical concept of the present invention.<br>
For example, even if the structure on the vehicle body side surface 11 side in the above-described embodiment is provided on the sliding door 3 side, and the structure on the sliding door 3 side is provided on the vehicle body side surface 11 side, the same effect can be achieved.    That is to say, the configuration may be such that the striker 12 is provided on the sliding door-side vertical wall surface 3a, and the insertion hole 31 having the notch parts 31 a, the L-shaped gusset 34, and the like are provided on the vehicle body-side vertical wall<br><br>
surface 11 a.    In this case, the notch parts 31 a of the insertion hole 31 should be provided on the cabin outside.<br><br><br>
What is claimed is:<br>
1.	A constraining structure of a vehicular sliding door for opening and closing a door opening in a vehicle body side surface by sliding the sliding door in the forward and rearward directions of vehicle, wherein a striker is arranged on a vehicle body-side vertical wall surface facing to the door opening so as to form a U-shaped plane as viewed from the vehicle body side surface side; an insertion hole through which the striker is inserted in a state in which the sliding door is closed is provided in a sliding door-side vertical wall surface; and a pair of notch parts capable of being engaged with the striker are provided on the cabin side of the insertion hole, by which the striker is engaged with the notch parts when a load is applied to the sliding door from the cabin side to the cabin outside.<br>
2.	The constraining structure of a vehicular sliding door according to claim 1, wherein a reinforcing member is provided ranging from the sliding door-side vertical wall surface to the cabin side in the range in which the insertion hole is provided.<br>
3.	The constraining structure of a vehicular sliding door according to claim 2, wherein a through hole is provided in a surface for reinibrcing the sliding door-side vertical wall surface of the reinforcing member, and the through hole is provided with an edge part formed with a pair of notch parts so as to substantially coincide with an edge part on the cabin side capable of engaging with the striker.<br>
4.	The constraining structure of a vehicular sliding door according to claim 3, wherein an L-shaped gusset formed with a bent piece part which comes into contact with the wall surface between a pair of notch parts provided in the wall surface located on the cabin side of<br><br>
the reinforcing member, and the bent piece pan, extends toward the cabin outside and is formed so as to have a length such that the distal end thereof does not project into the insertion hole and the through hole.<br>
5.        The constraining structure of a vehicular sliding door according to any one of claims 1 to 4, wherein a case which forms a closed cross section by covering the insertion hole is provided at the location of the insertion hole.</td>
