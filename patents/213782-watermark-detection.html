				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a method of detecting a watermark in an information<br>
signal that has possibly been watermarked by modifying values of said information signal in<br>
accordance with (temporally or spatially) corresponding values of a watermark pattern. The<br>
invention also relates to an arrangement for detecting a watermark.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A prior art method as defined in the opening paragraph is disclosed in<br>
International Patent Application WO-A-98/03014. The watermark is detected by computing<br>
the correlation of the suspect information signal with an applied watermark pattern, and<br>
comparing the correlation with a predetermined threshold. If the correlation is larger than the<br>
threshold, the watermark is said to be present, otherwise it is said to be absent.<br>
OBJECT AND SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide a suitable criterion for setting the .<br>
threshold.<br>
To this end, the invention provides a method of detecting a given watermark in<br>
an information signal, comprising the steps of: computing the correlation of said watermark<br>
and said information signal for a plurality of positions of said watermark with respect to said<br>
information signal; and detecting whether at least one of the respective correlation values<br>
exceeds a given threshold; characterized in that the method comprises the step of determining<br>
the standard deviation of the respective correlation values, wherein said given threshold is a<br>
given multiple of said standard deviation.<br>
The invention exploits the insight that watermark detectors need to compute the<br>
correlation value for a plurality of (temporal or spatial) positions of the watermark with respect<br>
to the information signal (for example, an image) in practice, because the position of the-<br>
watermark with respect to image is not absolutely known and/or information is embedded in<br>
shifts of one or more watermark patterns. The detection thus yields a series of correlation<br>
values, and it is the occurrence of relative peaks in such a series which is of interest rather than<br>
absolute correlation values.<br><br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
For the sake of convenience, the watermarking scheme in accordance with the<br>
invention will be described as a system for attaching invisible labels to video contents but the<br>
teachings can obviously be applied to any other contents, including audio and multimedia. We<br>
will hereinafter often refer to this method as JAWS (Just Another Watermarking System).<br>
Fig. 1 shows a practical embodiment of the watermark embedder to provide<br>
background information. The embeddcr comprises an image source 11 which generates an<br>
image P, and an adder 12 which adds a watermark W to the image P. The watermark W is a<br>
noise pattern having the same size as the image, e.g. N, pixels horizontally and N2 pixels<br>
vertically. The watermark W represents a key K, i.e. a multi-bit code which is to be retrieved<br>
at the receiving end.<br>
To avoid that the watermark detection process needs to search the watermark W<br>
over the large N,xN2 space, the watermark is generated by repeating, and if necessary<br>
truncating, smaller units called "tiles" W(K) over the extent of the image. This "tiling"<br>
operation (15) is illustrated in Fig. 2. The tiles W(K) have a fixed size MxM. The tile size M<br>
should not be too small: smaller M implies more symmetry in W(K) and therefore a larger<br>
security risk. On the other hand M should not be too large: a large value of M implies a large<br>
search space for the detector and therefore a large complexity. In JAWS we have chosen<br>
M=128 as a reasonable compromise.<br>
Then, a local depth map or visibility mask ?(P) is computed (16). At each pixel<br>
position,?(P) provides a measure for the visibility of additive noise. The map ?(P) is<br>
constructed to have an average value equal to 1. The extended sequence W(K) is subsequently<br>
modulated (17) with ?(P), i.e. the value of the tiled watermark W(K) at each position is<br>
multiplied by the visibility value of ?(P) at that position. The resulting noise sequence W(K,P)<br>
is therefore dependent on both the key K and the image content of P. We refer to W(K,P) as an<br>
adaptive watermark as it adapts to the image P.<br>
Finally, the strength of the final watermark is determined by a global depth<br>
parameter d which provides a global scaling (18) of W(K,P). A large value of d corresponds to<br>
a robust but possibly visible watermark. A small value corresponds to an almost imperceptible<br>
but weak watermark. The actual choice of d will be a compromise between the robustness and<br>
perceptibility requirements. The watermarked image Q is obtained by adding (12)<br>
W=dxW(K,P) to P, rounding to integer pixel values and clipping to the allowed pixel value<br>
range.<br>
In order to embed the multi-bit code K in the watermark W, every tile W(K) is<br>
built up from a limited set of uncorrelated basic or primitive tiles {W,..Wn} and shifted<br>
versions thereof, in accordance with<br><br>
where "shift(W,,k,)" represents a spatial shift of a basic M*M tile W( over a vector k, with<br>
cyclic wrap around. The signs se (-1 ,+1} and the shifts k depend on the key K via an encoding<br>
function E (13). It is the task of the detector to reconstruct K after retrieving the signs si and<br>
the shifts ki. Note that each basic tile Wf may occur several times. In Fig. 1, the encoder 13<br>
generates W(K)=W1+W2-W2" where W2" is a shifted version of W2. Fig. 3 illustrates this<br>
operation.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a schematic diagram of the watermark detector in accordance with<br>
the invention. The watermark detector receives possibly watermarked images Q. Watermark<br>
detection in JAWS is not done for every single frame, but for groups of frames. By<br>
accumulating (21) a number of frames the statistics of detection is improved and therefore also<br>
the reliability of detection. The accumulated frames are subsequently partitioned (22) into<br>
blocks of size MxM (M=128) and all the blocks are stacked (23) in a buffer q of size MxM.<br>
This operation is known as folding. Fig. 5 illustrates this operation of folding.<br>
The next step in the detection process is to assert the presence in buffer q of a<br>
particular noise pattern. To detect whether or not the buffer q includes a particular watermark<br>
pattern W, the buffer contents and said watermark pattern are subjected to correlation.<br>
Computing the correlation of a suspect information signal q with a watermark pattern w<br>
comprises computing the inner product d=<q> of the information signal values and the<br>
corresponding values of the watermark pattern. For a one-dimensional information signal<br>
q={qn} and watermark pattern w={wn}, this can be written in mathematical notation as:<br>
For the two-dimensional MxM image q={qii} and watermark pattern W={Wij}, the inner<br>
product is:<br>
In principle, the vector kf by which a tile Wi has been shifted can be found by<br>
successively applying Wi with different vectors k to the detector, and determining for which k<br>
the correlation is maximal. However, this brute force searching algorithm is time consuming.<br>
Moreover, the image Q may have undergone various forms of processing (such as translation<br>
or cropping) prior to the watermark detection, so that the detector does not know the spatial<br>
location of the basic watermark pattern Wi with respect to the image Q.<br>
Instead of brute force searching JAWS exploits the structure of the patterns<br>
W(K). The buffer q is examined for the presence of these primitive patterns, their signs and<br>
shifts. The correlation dk of an image q and a primitive pattern w being shifted by a vector k<br>
(kx pixels horizontally and ky pixels vertically is:<br><br>
The correlation values dk for all possible shift vectors k of a basic pattern Wf are<br>
simultaneously computed using the Fast Fourier transform. As shown in Fig. 4, both the<br>
contents of buffer q and the basic watermark pattern W; are subjected to a Fast Fourier<br>
Transform (FFT) in transform circuits 24 and 25, respectively. These operatioris yield:<br>
i <br>
where q and w are sets of complex numbers.<br>
Computing the correlation is similar to computing the convolution of q and the<br>
conjugate of Wi. In the transform domain, this corresponds to:<br><br>
where the symbol ® denotes pointwise multiplication and conj() denotes inverting the sign of<br>
the imaginary part of the argument. In Fig. 4, the conjugation of w is carried out by a<br>
conjugation circuit 26, and the pointwise multiplication is carried out by a multiplier 27. The<br>
set of correlation values d={dk} is now obtained by inverse Fourier transforming the result of<br>
said multiplication:<br><br>
which is carried out in Fig. 4 by an inverse FFT circuit 28. The watermark pattern Wi is<br>
detected to be present if a correlation value dk is larger than a given threshold.<br>
Fig. 6A shows a graph of correlation values dk if the presence of watermark<br>
pattern W, (see Figs. 1 and 3) in image Q is being checked. The peak 61 indicates that W, is<br>
indeed found. The position (0,0) of this peak indicates that the pattern W, applied to the<br>
detector happens to have the same spatial position with respect to the image Q as the pattern<br>
W, applied to the embedder. Fig. 6B shows the graph of correlation values if watermark<br>
pattern W2 is applied to the detector. Two peaks are now found. The positive peak 62 at (0,0)<br>
denotes the presence of watermark W,, the negative peak 63 at (48,80) denotes the presence of<br>
watermark -W2". The relative position of the latter peak 63 with respect to peak 62 (or, what is<br>
similar, peak 61) reveals the relative position (in pixels) of W," with respect to W2, i.e. the<br>
shift vector k. The embedded data K is derived from the vectors thus found.<br>
The embedded information may identify, for example, the copy-right holder or<br>
a description of the content. In DVD copy-protection, it allows material to be labeled as "copy<br>
once", "never copy", "no restriction", "copy no more", etc. Fig. 7 shows a DVD drive for<br>
playing back an MPEG bitstream which is recorded on a disc 71. The recorded signal is<br>
applied to an output terminal 73 via a switch 72. The output terminal is connected to an<br>
external MPEG decoder and display device (not shown). It is assumed that the DVD drive may<br>
not play back video signals with a predetermined embedded watermark, unless other<br>
conditions are fulfilled which are not relevant to the invention. For example, watermarked<br>
signals may only be played back if the disc 71 includes a given "wobble" key. In order to<br>
detect the watermark, the DVD drive comprises a watermark detector 74 as described above.<br>
The detector receives the recorded signal and controls the switch 72 in response to whether or<br>
not the watermark is detected.<br>
The Fourier coefficients d are complex numbers, that is, they have a real part<br>
and an imaginary part, or a magnitude and a phase. The inventors have found that the<br>
reliability of the detector is significantly improved if the magnitude information is thrown<br>
away and the phase is considered only. Fig. 8 shows a preferred embodiment of the detector"s<br>
correlation circuitry. The embodiment differs from the one shown in Fig. 4 in that a magnitude<br>
normalization circuit 30 has been inserted between the multiplier 27 and the inverse Fourier<br>
Transform circuit 28. The operation of the normalization circuit comprises pointwise dividing<br>
each coefficient by its magnitude. In mathematical notation:<br>
 0)<br>
where F denotes pointwise division and abs() denotes:<br>
 (2)<br>
where R() and I() denote the real and imaginary part of the argument, respectively.<br>
Said normalization of magnitudes is referred to as Symmetrical Phase Only<br>
Matched Filtering (SPOMF). Figs. 9A and 9B illustrate the effect of SPOMF correlation. More<br>
particularly, Fig. 9A shows the correlation values dk when using linear correlation, i.e. without<br>
the magnitude normalization circuit 30. The correlation value d00, expressed in units of<br>
standard deviation of the whole matrix, amounts to 9.79. Fig. 913 shows the correlation values<br>
when using SPOMF correlation. The correlation value d00, is now 62.77 times the standard<br>
deviation. It will be appreciated that the peak in Fig. 9B can more reliably be detected than the<br>
peak in Fig. 9A.<br>
Because normalizing the magnitudes of d is equivalent to normalizing the<br>
magnitudes of both q and w, the normalization circuit 30 in Fig. 8 may be replaced by two<br>
normalization circuits after the FFT circuits 24 and 25. However, the embedded watermark<br>
will already have a reasonably white (flat) frequency spectrum because it is a pseudo-random<br>
noise pattern in practice, in which each sample is independently and identically drawn from a •<br>
normal distribution. In view hereof, normalizing the magnitude of the information signal only<br>
has been found to suffice. Fig. 10 shows such an embodiment. The magnitude normalization<br>
circuit 30 is now located between the FFT circuit 24 and the multiplier 27. In this embodiment,<br>
the magnitudes of d are not exactly, but substantially, the same.<br>
It should further be noted that the FFT and the conjugation of the applied<br>
watermark Wi (c.f. circuits 25 and 26, respectively, in Figs. 4, 8 and 10), as well as the<br>
optional normalization of the magnitudes of w, can be pre-computed and stored in a memory.<br>
This invention addresses the aspect of determining criteria for correlation values<br>
dk to be peaks. To this end we consider the decision variable dk as a stochastic variable. A way<br>
of formulating "largeness" of dk is by comparison to the standard deviation ad of d. If a<br>
particular measurement dk is larger than Tad for some suitably chosen threshold T, then we say<br>
that dk is an statistical outlier. This will be interpreted as the presence of a watermark.<br>
Experiments have shown that d can be modeled to a very good approximation<br>
as a normal distribution. This holds both for linear correlations as well as for SPOMF<br>
correlations. This allows us to associate false positive rates to the threshold T. In particular the<br>
probability that a measurement dk is larger than Tsd can be computed as erfc(T), where erfc is<br>
the error function<br>
[ <br>
A threshold value T=5 is generally considered to be safe and corresponds with a false alarm<br>
probability of 2.8x10-7.<br>
Each of the values dk can be seen as the correlation of a fixed watermark {w/j}<br>
with an image qk where qk is a shifted version of q (with cyclic wrap around). Therefore we<br>
can view the matrix dk as a matrix of instantiations of the stochastic process d. Experiments<br>
have shown that d can be modeled to a very good approximation as a normal distribution. This<br>
holds both for linear correlations as well as for SPOMF correlations. This allows us to<br>
associate false positive rates to the threshold T. In particular the p|pbability that a<br>
measurement dk is larger than Tsd can be computed as erfc(T), where erfc is the error function<br><br>
A threshold value T=5 is generally considered to be safe and corresponds with a false alarm .<br>
. probability of 2.8x10-7. The actual false alarm rate is orders of magnitudes lower due to the<br>
way watermark information K is encoded as a combination of signs and peak positions. The<br>
probability that for T=5 a legal combination of peaks and signs occurs by chance is<br>
vanishingly small.<br>
The actual false alarm rate is orders of magnitudes lower due to the way watermark<br>
information K is encoded as a combination of signs and peak positions. The probability that<br>
for T=5 a legal combination of peaks and signs occurs by chance is vanishingly small.<br>
For linear correlations as described above, it can be shown that sd can be<br>
directly expressed in terms of the standard deviation sq of the image q and the standard<br>
deviation sw of the watermark w:<br><br>
In practice, this implies that sd may be assumed to have a fixed predetermined value.<br>
The value of sd can also be estimated directly from the matrix {dk}, viz.<br><br>
The latter method of computing sd is particularly useful when the correlation values are<br>
computed using SPOMF because for SPOMF correlation there are no easy theoretical<br>
formulas for sd. With SPOMF detection, peak heights in {dk} are compared with this measured<br>
standard deviation and judged relevant if larger than 5sd.<br>
In summary, a method and arrangement for detecting a watermark in an<br>
information signal is disclosed. The method comprises the steps of computing (24-28,30) the<br>
correlation (dk) of said watermark (Wj) and said information signal (e.g. an image Q) for a<br>
plurality of positions (k) of said watermark with respect to said information signal, and<br>
detecting (29) whether at least one of the respective correlation values exceeds a given<br>
threshold. The step of detecting (29) comprises determining the standard deviation (sd) of the<br>
respective correlation values (dk), and setting the threshold to a given multiple (T) of said<br>
standard deviation. The multiple (T) is derived form a desired false alarm rate (watermark<br>
detected when there is none, or no watermark detected when there is one).<br>
