				<td>A QUINAZOLINONE COMPOUND<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to quinazolinone derivatives, which aie inhibitors of the mitotic kinesin KSP and are useful in the treatment of cellular proliferative diseases, for example cancer, hyperplasias, restenosis, cardiac hypertrophy, immune disorders and inflammation.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Interest in the medicinal chemistry of quinazoline derivatives was stimulated in the early 1950's with the elucidation of the structure of a quinazoline alkaloid, 3-[B-ke.to-<br>
gamma-(3-hydroxy-2-piperidyl)-propyl]-4-quinazolone, from an Asian plant known:<br>
for its antimalarial properties. In a quest to rind additional antimalarial agents, various<br>
substituted quinazolines have been synthesized. Of particular import was the synthesis of the derivative 2-methyl-3H&gt;tolyM-(3H)-quinazolmone. This compound, known by the name methaqualone, though ineffective against protozoa, was found to be a potent hypnotic.<br>
Since the introduction of methaqualone and its discovery as a hypnotic, the pharmacological activity of quinazolinones and related compounds has been investigated. Quinazolinones and derivatives thereof are now known to have a wide variety of biological properties including hypnotic, sedative, analgesic, anticonvulsant, antitussive and anti-inflammatory activities.<br>
Quinazolinone derivatives for which specific biological uses have been described include U.S. Patent No. 5,147,875 describing 2-(substituted phenyl)-4-oxo quinazolines with bronchodilator activity. U.S. PatentNos. 3,723,432,3,740,442, and 3,925,548 describe a class of 1 -substituted-4-aryl-2(l H)-quinazolinone derivatives useful as anti-inflammatory agents. European patent publication EP 0 056 637 Bl claims a class of 4(3H)-quinazolinone derivatives for the treatment of hypertension. European patent publication EP 0 884 319 Al describes pharmaceutical compositions of quinazolin-4-one derivatives used to treat neurodegenerative, psychotropic, and drug and alcohol induced central and peripheral nervous system disorders.<br>
-1-<br><br>
Quinazolinones are among a growing number of therapeutic agents used to treat cell proliferative disorders, including cancer. For example, PCX WO 96/06616 describes a pharmaceutical composition containing a quinazolinons derivative to inhibit vascular smoofti cell proliferation. PCT WO 96/19224 uses this same quisazolirjone<br>
5     derivative to inhibit mesengial cell proliferation. U.S. Patent Nos. 4,981,856, 5,081,124 and 5,280,027 describe the use of quinazolinone derivatives to inhibit fhymidylate synthase, the enzyme that catalyzes the methylation of deoxyuridine monophosphate to produce thymidine monophosphate which is required fee DHA synthesis. U.S. Patent Nos. 5,747,498 and 5,773,476 describe qainazolinone<br>
10     derivatives used to treat cancers characterized by over-activity oi inappropriate activity of tyrosine receptor kinases. U.S. Patent No. 5,037,829 claims (lH-azoH-ylmethyl) substituted quinazoline compositions to treat carcinomas which occur in epitn&amp;Uat cells, PCT WO 98/34613 describes a composition containing a quinazolinone derivative useful for attenuating neovascularization and for treating<br>
15     malignancies. U.S. Patent 5,187,167 describes pharmaceutical compositions comprising quinazolin-4-one derivatives which possess anti-tumor activity.<br>
Other therapeutic agents used to treat cancer include me taxanes and vinca alkaloids. Taxaaes and vinca alkaloids act on microtubules, which axe present in a variety of cellular structures. MicrotubuAes are the primary structural element of &amp;e mitotic<br>
20     spiadle. The mitotic spindle is responsible for distribution of replicate copies of we genome to each of the two daughter cells mat result from cell division. It is presumed that disruption of the mitotic spindle by these drugs results in inhibition of cancer cell division, and induction of cancer cell death. However, microtobules form other types of cellular structures, including tracks for intracellular transport in nerve processes.<br>
25     Because these agents do not specifically target mitotic spindles, fliey have side effects that limit their usefulness.<br>
Improvements m fee specificity of agents used to treat cancer is of considerable interest because of the therapeutic benefits which would be realized if the side effects associated with the administration of these agents could be reduced. Traditionally, 30     dramatic improvements in the treatment of cancer are associated with identification of therapeutic agents acting through novel mechanisms. Examples of this include not<br>
-2-<br><br>
only the taxanes, but also the camptothecin class of topoisomerase I inhibitors. Fiom both of these perspectives, mitotic kinesins are attractive targets for new anti-cancer agents.<br>
Mitotic kinesins are enzymes essential for assembly and function of the mitotic 5     spindle, but are not generally part of other microtubule structures, such as in nerve processes, Mitotic kinesins play essential roles during all phases of mitosis. These enzymes are "molecular motors" that transform energy released by hydrolysis of ATP into mechanical force which drives the directional movement of cellular cargoes along microtubules. The catalytic domain sufficient for mis task is a compact structure of<br>
10     approximately 340 amino acids. During mitosis, kinesins organize microtubules into the bipolar structure that is the mitotic spindle. Kinesins mediate movement of chromosomes along spindle microtubules, as well as structural changes in the mitotic spindle associated with specific phases of mitosis. Experimental perturbation of mitotic kinesin function causes malformation or dysfunction of the mitotic spindle,<br>
15     frequently resulting in cell cycle arrest and cell death.<br>
Among the mitotic kinesins that have been identified is KSP. KSP belongs to an evolutionarily conserved kinesin subfamily of plus end-directed microtubule motors that assemble into bipolar homotetramers consisting of antiparallel homodimers. During mitosis KSP associates with microtubules of the mitotic spindle.  20     Microinjection of antibodies directed against KSP into human cells prevents spindle pole separation during prometaphase, giving rise to monopolar spindles and causing mitotic arrest and induction of programmed cell death. KSP and related kinesins in other, non-human, organisms, bundle antiparallel microtubules and slide them relative to one another, thus forcing the two spindle poles apart KSP may also mediate in 25     anaphase B spindle elongation and focussing of microtubules at the spindle pole.<br>
Human KSP (also termed HsEg5) has been described [Blangy, et al., Cell, 83:1159-69 (1995); Whitehead, et al., Artnritis Rheum., 39:1635-42 (1996); Galgio etal., J.

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a class of novel compounds, based on a core quinazolinone structure, that are modulators of raitotic kinesins. By inhibiting or 25     modulating mitotic kinesins, but not other kinesins (e.g., transport kinesins), specific inhibition of cellular proliferation is accomplished. Thus, the present invention<br>
-6-<br><br>
capitalizes on the finding that perturbation of mitotic kdnesin function causes malformation or dysfunction of mitotic spindles, frequently resulting in cell cycle airest and cell death.   The methods of inhibiting a human KSP kinesin comprise contacting an inhibitor of the invention with a KSP kinesin, particularly human KSP kinesins, including fragments and variants of KSP. The inhibition can be of the ATP hydrolysis activity of the KSP kinesin and/or the mitotic spindle formation activity, such that the mitotic spindles are disrupted. Meiotic spindles may also be disrupted.<br>
An object of the present invention is to develop inhibitors and modulators of mitotic kinesins, in particular KSP, for the treatment of disorders associated with cell proliferation. Traditionally, dramatic improvements in the treatment of cancer, one type of cell proliferative disorder, have been associated with identification of therapeutic agents acting through novel mechanisms. Examples of this include not only the taxane class of agents that appear to act on microtubule formation, but also the camptothecin class of topoisomerase I inhibitors. The compositions and methods described herein can differ in their selectivity and are preferably used to treat diseases of proliferating cells, including, but not limited to cancer, hyperplasias, restenosis, cardiac hypertrophy, immune disorders and inflammation.<br>

Most of the compounds described herein contain one or more asymmetric centers (e.g. the carbon to which R2 and Ra' are attached) and may thus give rise to enantiomers, 5     diastereomers, and other stereoisomeric forms &amp;at may be defined, in terms of<br>
absolute stereochemistry, as (R)- or (S)-. The present invention is meant to include all such possible isomeis, including racemic mixtures, optically pure forms and intermediate mixtures. Optically active (R)- and (S)* isomers may be prepared using chiral synthons or chiral reagents, or resolved using conventional techniques. When 10     the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds or other centers of geometric asymmetry, and unless specified otherwise, it is intended that the compounds include both E and Z geometric isomers. Likewise, all tautomeric forms are also intended to be included.<br>
When desired, the R- and S-isomers may be resolved by methods known to those 15     skilled in the art, for example by formation of diastereoisomeric salts or complexes which may be separated, for example, by crystallisation; via formation of diastereoisomeric derivatives which may be separated, for example, by crystallisation, gas-liquid or liquid chromatography; selective reaction of one enantiomer with an enantiomer-specific reagent, for example enzymatic oxidation or reduction, followed 20     by separation of the modified and unmodified enantiomers; or gas-liquid or liquid chromatography in a chiral environment, for example on a chiral support, such as silica with a bound chiral ligand or in the presence of a chiral solvent It will be appreciated that where the desired enantiomer is converted into another chemical entity by one of the separation procedures described above, a further step may be 25     required to liberate the desired enantiomeric form. Alternatively, specific enantiomer may be synthesized by asymmetric synthesis using optically active reagents, substrates, catalysts or solvents, or by converting on enantiomer to the other by asymmetric transformation. An example of a synthesis from optically active starting materials is shown in Figure 4.<br>
30     In one embodiment, as wil] be appreciated by those in the art, the two adjacent R2<br>
groups may be fused together to form a ring structure. Again, the fused ring structure<br>
-13-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCT/US01/13901<br>
may contain heteroatoms and may be substituted with one or mote substitution groups "R". It should additionally be noted that for cycloalkyl (i.e., saturated ring structures), certain positions may contain two substitution groups, R and R!.<br>

Synthesis. Testing and Use<br>
The compositions of the invention are synthesized as outlined below, utilizing techniques well known in the art. For example, as described in Ager et al., J. of Med. 20     Chem., 20:379-386 (1977), hereby incorporated by reference, quinazolinones can be obtained by acid-catalyzed condensation of N-acylanthranilic acids with aromatic primary amines. Other processes for preparing quinazolinones are described in U.S. Patent applications 5,783,577, 5,922,866 and 5,187,167, all of which are incorporated by reference.<br>
25     The compositions of the invention may be made as shown in Figures 1,2,4 and 5. Compounds of formulae 1 d are made in analogous fashion to Figure 1, except mat the acyl halide in the final step is replaced by an alkyl halide.<br>
Once made, the compositions of the invention find use in a variety of applications. As will be appreciated by those in the art, mitosis may be altered in a variety of ways; that 30     is, one can affect mitosis either by increasing or decreasing the activity of a<br>
component in the mitotic pathway. Stated differently, mitosis may be affected (e.g.,<br>
-24-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCT/US01/13901<br>
disrupted) by disturbing equilibrium, either by inhibiting or activating certain components. Similar approaches may be used to alter meiosis.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the compositions of the invention are used to modulate mitotic spindle formation, thus causing prolonged cell cycle arrest in mitosis. By 5     "modulate" herein is meant altering mitotic spindle formation, including increasing and decreasing spindle formation. By "mitotic spindle formation" herein is meant organization of microtubules into bipolar structures by mitotic kinesins. By "mitotic spindle dysfunction" herein is meant mitotic arrest and monopolar spindle formation.<br>
The compositions of the invention are useful to bind to and/or modulate the activity of 10     a mitotic kinesin, KSP. In a preferred embodiment, the KSP is human KSP, although KSP kinesins from other organisms may also be used. In this context, modulate means either increasing or decreasing spindle pole separation causing malformation, i.e., splaying, of mitotic spindle poles, or otherwise causing morphological perturbation of the mitotic spindle. Also included within the definition of KSP for 15     tnese purposes are variants and/or fragments of KSP. See U.S. Patent Application "Methods of Screening for Modulators of Cell Proliferation and Methods of Diagnosing Cell Proliferation States", filed Oct. 27,1999 (U.S. Serial Number 09/428,156), hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety. In addition, other mitotic kinesins may be used in the present invention. However, the compositions of 20     the invention have been shown to have specificity for KSP.<br>
For assay of activity, generally either KSP or a compound according to the invention is non-diffusably bound to an insoluble support having isolated sample receiving areas (e.g., a microtiter plate, an array, etc.). The insoluble support may be made of any composition to which the compositions can be bound, is readily separated from<br>
25     soluble material, and is otherwise compatible with the overall method of screening. The surface of such supports may be solid or porous and of any convenient shape. Examples of suitable insoluble supports include microtiter plates, arrays, membranes and beads. These are typically made of glass, plastic (e.g., polystyrene), polysaccharides, nylon or nitrocellulose, Teflon™, etc. Microtiter plates and arrays<br>
30     are especially convenient because a large number of assays can be carried out<br>
simultaneously, using small amounts of reagents and samples. The particular manner<br>
-25-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCT/US01/1390I<br>
of binding of the composition is not crucial so long as it is compatible with me reagents and overall methods of the invention, maintains the activity of the composition and is nondifiusable. Preferred methods of binding include the use of antibodies (which do not sterically block either the ligand binding site ox activation 5     sequence when the protein is bound to the support), direct binding to "sticky11 or ionic supports, chemical crosslinking, the synthesis of the protein or agent on the surface, etc. Following binding of the protein or agent, excess unbound material is removed by washing. The sample receiving areas may then be blocked through incubation with bovine serum albumin (BSA), casein or other innocuous protein or other moiety.<br>
10     The antimitotic agents of the invention may be used on their own to modulate the<br>
activity of a mitotic kinesin, particularly KSP. In this embodiment, the mitotic agents of the invention are combined with KSP and the activity of KSP is assayed. Kinesin activity is known in the art and includes one or more kinesin activities. Kinesin activities include the ability to affect ATP hydrolysis; microtubule binding; gliding<br>
15     and polymerization/depolymerization (effects on microtubule dynamics); binding to other proteins of the spindle; binding to proteins involved in cell-cycle control; serving as a substrate to other enzymes; such as kinases or proteases; and specific kinesin cellular activities such as spindle pole separation.<br>
Methods of performing motility assays are well known to those of skill in the art 20     [See e.g., Hall, et al. (1996), Biophys. J., 71: 3467-3476, Turner et al., 1996, AnaL Biochem. 242 (l):20-5; Gittes et al., 1996, Biophys. J. 70(1): 418-29; Shirakawa et al., 1995, J. Exp. BioL 198:1809-15; Winkelmann et al., 1995, Biophys. J. 68:2444-53; Winkelmann et al., 1995, Biophys. J. 68: 72S.]<br>
Methods known in the art for determining ATPase hydrolysis activity also can be 25     used, Preferably, solution based assays are utilized. U.S. application 09/314,464, riled May 18,1999, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety, describes such assays. Alternatively, conventional methods are used. For example, Pi release from kinesin can be quantified. In one preferred embodiment, the ATPase hydrolysis activity assay utilizes 0.3 M PCA (perchloric acid) and malachite green reagent (8.27 30     mM sodium molybdate II, 0.33 mM malachite green oxalate, and 0.8 mM Triton X-l<br>
00). To perform the assay, 10 \xL of reaction is quenched in 90 [iL of cold 0.3 M<br>
-26-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCT/US01/13901<br>
PCA. Phosphate standards are used so data can be converted to mM inorganic phosphate released. When all reactions and standards have been quenched in PCA, 100 jxL of malachite green reagent is added to the relevant wells in e.g., a microtiter plate. The mixture is developed for 10-15 minutes and the plate is read at an 5     absorbance of 650 nm. If phosphate standards were used, absorbance readings can be converted to mM Pi and plotted over time. Additionally, ATPase assays known in the art include the luciferase assay.<br>
ATPase activity of ldnesin motor domains also can be used to monitor the effects of modulating agents. In one embodiment ATPase assays of ldnesin are performed in the<br>
10     absence of miciotubules. hi another embodiment, the ATPase assays are performed in the presence of microtubules. Different types of modulating agents can be detected in the above assays, hi a preferred embodiment, the effect of a modulating agent is independent of the concentration of microtubules and ATP. In another embodiment, the effect of the agents on ldnesin ATPase can be decreased by increasing the<br>
15     concentrations of ATP, microtubules or both, in yet another embodiment, the effect of the modulating agent is increased by increasing concentrations of ATP, microtubules or both.<br>
Agents that modulate the biochemical activity of K.SP in vitro may then be screened in vivo. Methods for such agents in vivo include assays of cell cycle distribution, cell<br>
20     viability, or the presence, morphology, activity, distribution, or amount of mitotic spindles, Methods for monitoring cell cycle distribution of a cell population, for example, by flow cytometry, are well known to those skilled in the art, as are methods for determining cell viability. See for example, U.S. Patent Application "Method's of Screening for Modulators of Cell Proliferation and Methods of Diagnosing Cell<br>
25     Proliferation States," filed Oct 22,1999, serial number 09/428,156, hereby incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
In addition to the assays described above, microscopic methods for monitoring spindle formation and malformation are well known to those of skill in the art (see, e.g., Whitehead and Rattner (1998), J. Cell Sci. 111:2551 -61; Galgio et al, (1996) J. Cell 30     biol., 135:399-414).<br>

The compositions of the invention inhibit the KSP kinesin. One measure of inhibition is ICso, defined as the concentration of the composition at which the activity of KSP is decreased by fifty percent Preferred compositions have ICso'a of less than about 1 mM, with preferred embodiments having IC50's of less than about 100 pM, with more 5     preferred embodiments having ICso's of less than about 10 |iM, with particularly<br>
preferred embodiments having ICso's of less than about 1 pM, and especially preferred embodiments having ICso's of less man about 100 nM, and with the most preferred embodiments having ICso's of less than about 10 nM. Measurement of ICso is done using an ATPase assay.<br>
10     Another measure of inhibition is Kj. For compounds with ICso's less than 1 jiM, the Ki or Kd is defined as the dissociation rate constant for the interaction of the quinazolinone with KSP. Preferred compounds have Ki's of less than about 100 JIM, with preferred embodiments having Kj's of less than about 10 pM, and particularly preferred embodiments having Ki's of less than about 1 uM and especially preferred<br>
15     embodiments having Kj's of less than about 100 nM, and with the most preferred embodiments having Kj's of less than about 10 nM. The Ki for a compound is determined from the IC50 based on three assumptions. First, only one compound molecule binds to the enzyme and there is no cooperativity. Second, the concentrations of active enzyme and the compound tested are known (i.e., there are no<br>
20     significant amounts of impurities or inactive forms in the preparations). Third, the enzymatic rate of the enzyme-inhibitor complex is zero. The rate (i.e., compound concentration) data are fitted to the equation:<br><br>
Where V is the observed rate, Vmax is the rate of the free enzyme, Io is the inhibitor 25     concentration, Eo is the enzyme concentration, and K<i is the dissociation constant of enzyme-inhibitor complex.></i>

Another measure of inhibition is GI50, defined as the concentration of the compound that results in a decrease in the rate of cell growth by fifty percent Preferred compounds have GIso's of less than about 1 mM. The level of preferability of embodiments is a function of their GI50: those having GIso's of less than about 20 pM 5     are more preferred; those having GIso's of 10 uM more so; those having GI50 of less than about 1 uM more so; those having GIso's of 100 nM more so; those having GI50 of less than about 10 nM even more so. Measurement of GI50 is done using a cell proliferation assay.<br>

Thus, the term "cancerous cell" as provided herein, includes a cell afflicted by any one of the above-identified conditions.<br>
5     Accordingly, the compositions of the invention axe administered to cells. By<br>
"administered" herein is meant administration of a therapeutically effective dose of the mitotic agents of the invention to a cell either in cell culture or in a patient. By "therapeutically effective dose" herein is meant a dose that produces the effects for which it is administered. The exact dose will depend on the purpose of the treatment,<br>
10     and will be ascertainable by one skilled in the art using known techniques. As is known in the art, adjustments for systemic versus localized delivery, age, body weight, general health, sex, diet, time of administration, drug interaction and the severity of the condition may be necessary, and will be ascertainable with routine experimentation by those skilled in the art. By "cells" herein is meant almost any cell<br>
15     in which mitosis or meiosis can be altered.<br>
A "patient" for the purposes of the present invention includes both humans and other animals, particularly mammals, and other organisms. Thus the methods are applicable to both human therapy and veterinary applications. In the preferred embodiment the patient is a mammal, and in the most preferred embodiment the patient is human.<br>
20     Mitotic agents having the desired pharmacological activity may be administered in a physiologically acceptable carrier to a patient, as described herein. Depending upon the manner of introduction, the compounds may be formulated in a variety of ways as discussed below. The concentration of therapeutically active compound in the formulation may vary from about 0.1-100 wt.%. The agents may be administered<br>
25     alone or in combination with other treatments, i.e., radiation, or other chemotherapeutic agents.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the pharmaceutical compositions are in a water soluble form, such as pharmaceutically acceptable salts, which is meant to include both acid and base addition salts. "Pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salt" refers to 30     those salts that retain the biological effectiveness of the free bases and that are not<br>
-31-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCT/US01/13901<br>
biologically or otherwise undesirable, formed with inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, phosphoric acid and the like, and organic acids such as acetic acid, propionic acid, glycolic acid, pyruvic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, fumaric acid, tartaric acid, citric 5     acid, benzoic acid, cinnamic acid, mandelic acid, methanesulfonic acid, ethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, salicylic acid and the like. "Pharmaceuticalry acceptable base addition salts" include those derived from inorganic bases such as sodium, potassium, lithium, ammonium, calcium, magnesium, iron, zinc, copper, manganese, aluminum salts and the like. Particularly preferred are<br>
10     me ammonium, potassium, sodium, calcium, and magnesium salts. Salts derived from phaimaceutically acceptable organic non-toxic bases include salts of primary, secondary, and tertiary amines, substituted amines including naturally occurring substituted amines, cyclic amines and basic ion exchange resins, such as isopropylamine, trimethylamine, diethylamine, triethylamine, tripropylamine, and<br>
15     ethanolamine.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions can be prepared in various forms, such as granules, tablets, pills, suppositories, capsules, suspensions, salves, lotions and the like. Pharmaceutical grade organic or inorganic carriers and/or diluents suitable for oral and topical use can be used to make up compositions containing the therapeutically-<br>
20     active compounds. Diluents known to the art include aqueous media, vegetable and animal oils and fats. Stabilizing agents, wetting and emulsifying agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure or buffers for securing an adequate pH value, and skin penetration enhancers can be used as auxiliary agents. The pharmaceutical compositions may also include one or more of the following: carrier proteins such as<br>
25     serum albumin; buffers; fillers such as microcrystanine cellulose, lactose, com and other starches; binding agents; sweeteners and other flavoring agents; coloring agents; and polyethylene glycol. Additives are well known in the art, and are used in a variety of formulations.<br>
The administration of the mitotic agents of the present invention can be done in a 30     variety of ways as discussed above, including, but not limited to, orally,<br>
subcutaneously, intravenously, intranasally, transdermally, intraperitoneally,<br>
-32-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCT/US01/13901<br>
intramuscularly, intrapulmonary, vaginalry, rectally, or intraocularly. In some instances, for example, in the treatment of wounds and inflammation, the anti-mitotic agents may be directly applied as a solution or spray.<br>
To employ the compounds of the invention in a method of screening for compounds 5     mat bind to KSP kinesin, the KSP is bound to a support, and a compound of the invention (which is a mitotic agent) is added to the assay. Alternatively, the compound of the invention is bound to the support and KSP is added. Classes of compounds among which novel binding agents may be sought include specific antibodies, non-natural binding agents identified in screens of chemical libraries, 10     peptide analogs, etc. Of particular interest are screening assays for candidate agents that have a low toxicity for human cells. A wide variety of assays may be used tor this purpose, including labeled in vitro protein-protein binding assays, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, immunoassays for protein binding, functional assays (phosphorylation assays, etc.) and the like.<br>
15     The determination of the binding of the mitotic agent to KSP may be done in a<br>
number of ways. In a preferred embodiment, the mitotic agent (the compound of the invention) is labeled, for example, with a fluorescent or radioactive moiety and binding determined directly. For example, this maybe done by attaching all or a portion of KSP to a solid support, adding a labeled mitotic agent (for example a<br>
20     compound of the invention in which at least one atom has been replaced by a<br>
detectable isotope), washing off excess reagent, and determining whether the amount of the label is that present on the solid support Various blocking and washing steps may be utilized as is known in the art<br>
By "labeled" herein is meant that the compound is either directly or indirectly labeled 25     with a label which provides a detectable signal, e.g., radioisotope, fluorescent tag, enzyme, antibodies, particles such as magnetic particles, chemiluminescent tag, or specific binding molecules, etc. Specific binding molecules include pairs, such as biotin and streptavidin, digoxin and antidigoxin etc. For the specific binding members, the complementary member would normally be labeled with a molecule 30     which provides for detection, in accordance with known procedures, as outlined<br>
above. The label can directly or indirectly provide a detectable signal.<br>
-33-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCT/US01/139Q1<br>
In some embodiments, only one of the components is labeled. For example, the kinesin proteins may be labeled at tyrosine positions using    I, or with fluorophores. Alternatively, more than one component may be labeled with different labels; using 125I for the proteins, for example, and a fluorophor for the mitotic agents.<br>
5     The compounds of the invention may also be used as competitors to screen for additional drug candidates. "Candidate bioactive agent" or "drug candidate" or grammatical equivalents as used herein describe any molecule, e.g., protein, oligopeptide, small organic molecule, polysaccharide, polynucleotide, etc., to be tested for bioactivity. They may be capable of direcfly or indirectly altering the cellular<br>
10     proliferation phenotype or the expression of a cellular proliferation sequence, including both nucleic acid sequences and protein sequences. In other cases, alteration of cellular proliferation protein binding and/or activity is screened. Screens of this sort may be performed either in the presence or absence of microtubules. In the case where protein binding or activity is screened, preferred embodiments exclude<br>
15     molecules already known to bind to mat particular protein, for example, polymer structures such as microtubules, and energy sources such as ATP. Preferred embodiments of assays herein include candidate agents which do not bind the cellular proliferation protein in its endogenous native state termed herein as "exogenous" agents. In another preferred embodiment, exogenous agents further exclude<br>
20     antibodies to KSP.<br>
Candidate agents can encompass numerous chemical classes, though typically they are organic molecules, preferably small organic compounds having a molecular weight of more than 100 and less than about 2,500 daltons. Candidate agents comprise functional groups necessary for structural interaction with proteins, particularly<br>
25     hydrogen bonding and lipophilic binding, and typically include at least an amine, carbonyl, hydroxyl, ether, or carboxyl group, preferably at least two of the functional chemical groups. The candidate agents often comprise cyclical carbon or aeterocyclic structures and/or aromatic or poryaromatic structures substituted with one or more of the above functional groups. Candidate agents are also found among biomolecules<br>
30     including peptides, saccharides, fatty acids, steroids, purines, pyrimidines, derivatives, structural analogs or combinations thereof. Particularly preferred are peptides.<br>
-34-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCTYUS01/I3901<br>
Candidate agents are obtained from a wide variety of sources including libraries of synthetic or natural compounds. For example, numerous means are available for random and directed synthesis of a wide variety of organic compounds and biomolecules, including expression of randomized oligonucleotides. Alternatively, S     libraries of natural compounds in the form of bacterial, fungal, plant and animal extracts are available or readily produced. Additionally, natural or synthetically produced libraries and compounds are readily modified through conventional chemical, physical and biochemical means. Known pharmacological agents maybe subjected to directed or random chemical modifications, such as acylation, alkylation, 10     esterification, amidification to produce structural analogs.<br>
Competitive screening assays may be done by combining KSP and a drug candidate in a first sample. A second sample comprises a mitotic agent, KSP and a drug candidate. This maybe performed in either the presence or absence of microtubules. The binding of the drug candidate is determined for both samples, and a change, or 15     difference in binding between the two samples indicates the presence of an agent capable of binding to KSP and potentially modulating its activity. That is, if the binding of the drug candidate is different in the second sample relative to the first sample, the drug candidate is capable of binding to KSP.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the binding of the candidate agent is determined through 20     the use of competitive binding assays. la this embodiment, the competitor is a<br>
binding moiety known to bind to KSP, such as an antibody, peptide, binding partner, ligand, etc. Under certain circumstances, there may be competitive binding as between the candidate agent and the binding moiety, with the binding moiety displacing the candidate agent<br>
25     In one embodiment, the candidate agent is labeled. Either the candidate agent, or the competitor, or bom, is added first to KSP for a time sufficient to allow binding, if present. Incubations may be performed at any temperature which facilitates optimal activity, typically between 4 and 40°C.<br>
Incubation periods are selected for optimum activity, but may also be optimized to 30     facilitate rapid high throughput screening. Typically between 0.1 and 1 hour will be<br>
-35-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCT/USOI/13901<br>
sufficient. Excess reagent is generally removed or washed away, The second component is then added, and the presence or absence of the labeled component is followed, to indicate binding.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the competitor is added first, followed by the candidate 5     agent Displacement of the competitor is an indication the candidate agent is binding to KSP and thus is capable of binding to, and potentially modulating, the activity of KSP. In this embodiment, either component can be labeled. Thus, for example, if the competitor is labeled, the presence of label in the wash solution indicates displacement by the agent Alternatively, if the candidate agent is labeled, the 10     presence of the label on the support indicates displacement.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the candidate agent is added first with incubation and washing, followed by the competitor. The absence of binding by the competitor may indicate the candidate agent is bound to KSP with a higher affinity. Thus, if the candidate agent is labeled, the presence of the label on the support, coupled with a 15     lack of competitor binding, may indicate the candidate agent is capable of binding to KSP.<br>
It may be of value to identify the binding site of KSP. This can be done in a variety of ways. In one embodiment, once KSP has been identified as binding to the mitotic agent, KSP is fragmented or modified and the assays repeated to identify the necessary 20     components for binding.<br>
Modulation is tested by screening for candidate agents capable of modulating the activity of KSP comprising the steps of combining a candidate agent with KSP, as above, and determining an alteration in the biological activity of KSP. Thus, in this embodiment, the candidate agent should both bind to KSP (although mis may not be 25     necessary), and alter its biological or biochemical activity as defined herein. The methods include both in vitro screening methods and in vivo screening of cells for alterations in cell cycle distribution, cell viability, or for the presence, morpohology, activity, distribution, or amount of mitotic spindles, as are generally outlined above.<br>
Alternatively, differential screening may be used to identify drug candidates that bind<br>
30     to the native KSP, but cannot bind to modified KSP.<br>
-36-<br><br>
WO 01798278	PCT/US01/13901<br>
Positive controls and negative controls may be used in the assays. Preferably all control and test samples are performed in at least triplicate to obtain statistically significant results, incubation of all samples is for a time sufficient for the binding of the agent to the protein. Following incubation, all samples are washed tree of non-5     specifically bound material and the amount of bound, generally labeled agent determined. For example, where a radiolabel is employed, the samples maybe counted in a scintillation counter to determine the amount of bound compound.<br>
A variety of other reagents may be included in the screening assays, These include reagents like salts, neutral proteins, e.g., albumin, detergents, etc which may be used 10     to facilitate optimal protein-protein binding and/or reduce non-specific or background interactions. Also reagents that otherwise improve the efficiency of the assay, such as protease inhibitors, nuclease inhibitors, anti-microbial agents, etc., may be used. The mixture of components may be added in any order that provides for the requisite binding.<br>

	Step 1: N-butvrvl anthranilic acid.<br>
To a three-necked, 500 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a thermometer,<br>
-38-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCT/US01/U901<br>
dropping funnel, and an efficient magnetic stir bar, was added anfhranilic acid (1) (0.5 mole, 68.5 g) and dimethyl formamide (250 mL). To this solution was added butyryl chloride (0.55 mole, 57.1 mL) dropwise at such a rate that the temperature of the mixture did not rise above 40°C. The suspension was stirred vigorously at room 5     temperature for at least an additional 3 h. The mixture was poured into water (2000 mL) and stirred for another 1 h. The precipitated product was collected by filtration, washed with cold water, and dried under reduced pressure over P2O5, yielding compound 2 (67.3 g, 65%).<br>
Step 2: 2-Propyl-3.1-r4H1benzoxazm-4-one.<br>
10     Compound 2 (51.8 g, 0.25 mole) was dissolved in acetic anhydride (180 mL) in a 500 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a magnetic stir bar, a Claisen-distillation head (with vacuum inlet) and a thermometer. The flask was placed in an oil bam and slowly heated to 170-180°C with vigorous stirring. The acetic acid produced was slowly distilled oft under atmospheric pressure. Monitoring the head temperature of<br>
15     the distillation unit was used to follow the progress of the transformation. The<br>
reaction mixture was then cooled to 60 °C and the excess of acetic anhydride removed by distillation under reduced pressure (ca. 20 mm Hg). The residue was afterward cooled and the product crystallized. The product was triturated with n-hexane (75 mL) and isolated by filtration to yield 2-propyl-3,l-[4H]benzoxazin-4-one (3) (29.3 g,<br>
20     62%). The above procedure gave compound 3 sufficiently pure to use directly in the next step.<br>
Step 3: 2-Propvl-3-benzvlquinazolin-4-one.<br>
Compound 3 (28.4 g, 0.15 mole) and benzylamine (17.5 mL, 0.16 mole) were<br>
refluxed in chloroform (50 ml) in a one-neck 250 mL round-bottom flask for 6 h.<br>
25     After complete consumption of compound 3, the chloroform was evaporated under reduced pressure.  Ethylene glycol (100 mL) and NaOH pellets (0.60 g) were added to the residue and the flask equipped with a Claisen-distillation head and a magnetic stir bar. The flask was immersed in an oil bath and reheated to 130-140 °C bath temperature with vigorous stirring and maintained there for 5 h while the water<br>
30     produced was removed by distillation. After completion of the reaction, the clear<br>
solution was allowed to cool to room temperature and kept overnight to precipitate the<br>

product The pHofthe suspension was adjusted to 7-8 by adding 3% aq. HO, the crystals were filtered off and washed with cold water, and then recrystallized from isopropanol (or alternatively from acetone) to provide the compound, 2-propyl-3-benzylquinazolin-4-one (compound 4) (28.0 g, 67%).<br>
5     Step 4: 2^'-bromoproDvlV3-benzvlquinazolm-4-one.<br>
To a three-neck 250 mL round-bottom flask equipped with a thermometer, dropping funnel, and efficient magnetic stir bai was added compound 4 (27.8 g, 0,10 mole), anhydrous sodium acetate (10.0 g) and glacial acetic acid (130 mL). Bromine (16.0 g, 0.10 mole) dissolved in acetic acid (10 mL) was added dropwise to the above solution 10     at 40 °C for 1-2 h. After addition was complete, the mixture was poured into water (1500 mL) and stirred for 1-2 h at room temperature. The precipitated product, 2-(T-bromopropyl)-3-benzylquinazolin-4-one (5) was isolated by filtration, washed with warm water to remove traces of acetic acid, and rinsed with a small amount of isopropanol. Drying yielded compound 5 (33.0 g, 92%).<br>
15     Step 5: 2-n'-(N.N-dimemvlethylene6^ammo&gt;prcmvll"3-beri2^1cniinazolin-4-ope. Compound 5 (10.7 g, 0.03 mole) and N,N-dimethylethylenediamine (6.6 mL, 0.06 mole) were dissolved in abs. ethanol (60 mL) and heated at reflux for 6 h. After completion of the reaction, the solvent was evaporated under reduced pressure. The residue was dissolved in dichloromethane (150 mL) and washed with 3% aq. NaOH<br>
20     solution (ca. 10-20 mL). The organic layer was dried over MgSCU and evaporated to dryness under reduced pressure. The remaining oily product was purified by flash chromatography on a short silica gel pad using an eluent of CHCl3-MeOH-aq.NH3, 90:10:0.1, to give the desired compound (5), 2-[l'-(N,N-dunethylemylenediammo)propyl]-3-ben2ylquinazolin-4-one (6) (6.0 g, 55%).<br>
25     Step 6:2-n'-fl^-4-fluorobenzovl^-fN.N-dunemvlemvlenediamino&gt;propvl1-3-benzylquinazolin-4-one.<br>
A stock solution of compound 5 (1.822 g, 5.0 mmol) was prepared in HPLC grade CHC13 (0.5 mL). A stock solution of p-flurobenzoyl chloride (160.2 mg, 1 mmol) in HPLC grade 1,2-dichloroethane (2.0 mL) was prepared in a 2.0 mL volumetric flask.<br>
30     A third solution of triethylamine (2.0 mL of 0.5 M) was prepared in HPLC grade 1,2-<br>
dichlorethane. A 100 ^L aliquot of each solution was pipetted into a glass reaction<br>

vessel using a Beckman Biomet 2000 automated liquid dispenser. The reaction mixture was shaken using a mechanical shaker, sonicated in an ultrasonic water bath, and then incubated overnight at room temperature. The mixture was diluted in CHCI3 (300 \iL) and washed with 5% aqueous NaHCO3 and water. The solvent was removed in vacuo to provide compound 6 (65%). The purity of the compound was analyzed by TLC eluted with CH2Cl2-ethanol-concentrated aqueous NH3i 100:10:1.<br>

Example 2 (solid phase synthesis of a single compound)<br>
STEP1: 1^-Diaminopropane trityl resin (Novabiochem, 1.2 mmol/g) (0.20 g, 024 mmol) was weighed into a screw-cap vial and 3 mL of a 1:1 mixture of DMF and chloroform was added. DIEA (0.130 mL, 0.72 mmol) and 2-(r-bromopropyl)-3-5     benzylquinazolin-4-one (from Example 1) (0.188 g, 0.48 mmol) were added. The vial was sealed, heated to 70 °C and shaken overnight The resin was 'filtered and washed (3 x DCM, 2 x MeOH, 1 x DCM, 2 x ether) and dried under vacuum. A 27 mg aliquot of resin was treated with 5:5:90 TFA:TES:DCM for 15 min and the mixture was filtered and evaporated, resulting in 8 mg (64% yield) of the quinazolinone-<br>
10     diamine intermediate. LCMS analysis showed &gt;80 % purity.<br>
STEP 2: The resin from Step 1 was swelled in 3 mL of DCM. DIEA (0.130 mL, 0.72 mmol) and 4-bromobenzyl bromide (0.12 g, 0,48 mmol) were added. The vial was sealed and shaken overnight. LCMS analysis of a cleaved aliquot revealed an approximate 1:1 mixture of starting material and product Another 0.130 mL of DIEA<br>
15     and 0.12 g of 4-bromobenzyl bromide were added and the mixture was shaken at 70 °C for 8 h. The resin was filtered, washed (as above), and dried under vacuum. STEP 3: The resin from Step 2 was twice shaken for 30 min with 5:5:90 TFA:TES:DCM and filtered. The filtrates were combined and evaporated, yielding 140 mg of an orange oil. This material was purified by reverse phase preparative<br>
20     HPLC (acetonitrile-water gradient) to provide 27 mg (17% for 3 steps) of the rnono-TFA salt.<br>
Example 3 ("combinatorial synthesis of multiple compounds)<br>
STEP1: 1,2-Diaminoethane trityl resin (Novabiochem, 0.95 mmol/g) (200 g, 1.9 mmol) and 1,3-Diaminopropane trityl resin (Novabiochem, 1.14 mmol/g) (2.0 g, 2.28<br>
25     mmol) were each placed in different 10 mL polypropylene fritted tubes (Bio-Rad). To each were added 4 mL of DMF, 4 mL of chloroform, 3 eq. of DIEA (1.0 mL and 1.2 mL, respectively) and 2 eq. of 2-(r-bromopropyl)-3-benzylquinazolin-4-one (from Example 1) (1.5 g and 1.8 g, respectively). The mixtures were shaken at 70 °C overnight. Each mixture was washed (3 x DCM, 2 x MeOH, 1 x DCM, 2 x ether) and<br>
30     dried under vacuum. Analysis of a cleaved aliquot revealed the presence of the appropriate quinazolinone-diamine for each in &gt;90 % purity.<br>

WO 01/98278	PCT/US01/13901<br>
STEP 2: The quinazolinone ethyl-diamine resin (105 mg, 0.10 mmol) was placed into each of the vials in the first 2 TOWS of the anay, and the quinazolinone propyl-diamine resin (88 mg, 0.10 mmol) was placed into each vial of the last 2 rows of me array. To each vial was added DIEA (0.131 mL, 0.75 mmol). Into each vial of the first 2 rows 5     of the array was added a different amine, and the additions were repeated for the last two rows of the array. The reaction block was shaken at 70 °C overnight Liquid was removed from each vial by multichannel pipette using tine-pointed gel-well tips, and the resins were washed (2 x DCM, 1 x MeOH, 1 x DCM) and dried under vacuum. STEP 3: To each vial of the array was added 2 mL of a 10:5:85 TFA:TES:DCM<br>
10     solution. The reaction block was shaken for 45 min and the mixtures were transferred to a filter block, filtered, and washed twice with 0.75 mL DCM. The solutions were evaporated to yield yellow-to-red oils. These thick oils were triturated twice with ether, dissolved in DCM and treated with 4 M HC1 in dioxane to provide the HC1 salts (unknown number of salts per compound) as tan-to-white powdery or amorphous<br>
15     solids. Analysis by LCMS showed all to be &gt;75 % pure.<br>

Intermediate A, prepared in Example 1, can be converted to an intermediate B, which, upon resolution, provides an alternative to the first five steps shown in Figure 4. The process is shown in the scheme below:<br>
-46-<br><br>
WO 01/98278<br><br>
PCT/US01/13901<br><br><br>
The R enantiomer of B can be crystallized selectively by heating a mixture of B with 1.1 equivalents of Z)-tartaric acid in a mixture of isopropanol and methanol and then 5     letting the mixture return to room temperature.<br>
Example9; X-CL.R-H<br>
Racemic intermediate B (1.5 g), dissolved in 100 mL of boiling isopropanol, was<br>
mixed with 0.8 g of D-tartaric acid in 100 mL of boiling methanol. The mixture was<br>
10     allowed to slowly reach room temperature. After standing overnight, the solid was removed by filtration and rinsed with ethyl acetate and hexanes, and allowed to air dry. The dried solid (0.8 g) was then dissolved in a boiling mixture of 50 mL of isopropanol and 50 mL of methanol and allowed to slowly cool to room temperature. After standing overnight, the resulting solid was removed by filtration and rinsed with<br>
15     ethyl acetate and hexanes, and allowed to air dry.  The dried solid was then stirred with saturated sodium bicarbonate for 30 min and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organics were dried (MgSCU), filtered and evaporated to dryness. The resulting clear oil weighed 345 mg. Chiral purity of &gt;95% was determined by conversion of a portion to the S-Mosher amide and examination of the product by 1HNMR.<br>

Induction of Mitotic Arrest in Cell Populations Treated with a Quinazolinone KSP<br>
5	Inhibitor<br>
FACS analysis to determine cell cycle stage by measuring DNA content was performed as follows. Skov-3 cells (human ovarian cancer) were split 1:10 for plating in 10cm dishes and grown to subconfiuence with RPMI1640 medium containing 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The cells were then treated with either lOnM paclitaxel,<br>
10     400nM quinazolmone 1,200nM quinazolinone2, or 0.25% DMSO (vehicle for<br>
compounds) for 24 hours. Cells were then rinsed off the plates with PBS containing 5mM EDTA, pelleted, washed once in PBS containing 1% FCS, and men fixed overnight in 85% ethanol at 4°C. Before analysis, the cells were pelleted, washed once, and stained in a solution of lOug propidium iodide and 250y.g of ribonuclease<br>
15     (RNAse) A per milliliter at 37°C for half an hour. Flow cytometry analysis was performed on a Becton-Dickinson FACScan, and data from 10,000 cells per sample was analyzed with Modfit software.<br>
-48-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCT/US01/13901<br>
The quinazolinone compounds, as well as the known anti-mitotic agent paclitaxel, caused a shift in the population of cells from a GO/G1 cell cycle stage (2n DNA content) to a G2/M cell cycle stage (4n DNA content). Other compounds of this class were found to have similar effects.<br>
5	Monopolar Spindle Formation following Application of a Quinazolinone KSP<br>
Inhibitor<br>
To determine the nature of the G2/M accumulation, human tumor cell lines Skov-3 (ovarian), HeLa (cervical), and A549 (lung) were plated in 96-well plates at densities of 4,000 cells per well (SKOV-3 &amp; HeLa) or 8,000 cells per well (A549), allowed to 10     adhere for 24 hours, and treated with various concentrations of the quinazolinone<br>
compounds for 24 hours. Cells were fixed in 4% formaldehyde and stained with auti-tubulin antibodies (subsequently recognized using fluorescently-labeled secondary antibody) and Hoechst dye (which stains DNA).<br>
Visual inspection revealed that the quinazolinone compounds caused cell cycle arrest IS     in the prometaphase stage of mitosis. DNA was condensed and spindle formation had initiated, but arrested cells uniformly displayed monopolar spindles, indicating that there was an inhibition of spindle pole body separation. Microinjection of anti-KSP antibodies also causes mitotic arrest with arrested cells displaying monopolar spindles.<br>
Inhibition of Cellular Proliferation in Tumor Cell Lines Treated with Quinazolinone<br>
20	KSP Inhibitors.<br>
Cells were plated in 96-well plates at densities from 1000-2500 cells/well of a 96-well plate (depending on the cell line) and allowed to adhere/grow, for 24 hours. They were men treated with various concentrations of drug for 48 hours. The time at which compounds are added is considered To. A tetrazolium-based assay using the reagent 25     3
tetrazolium (MTS) (LS&gt; Patent No. 5,185,450) (see Promega product catalog #G3580, CeHTiter 96® AQUMUS One Solution Cell Proliferation Assay) was used to determine the number of viable cells at To and the number of cells remaining after 48 hours compound exposure. The number of cells remaining after 48 hours was compared to<br>
-49-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCT/US01/13901<br>
the number of viable cells at the time of drug addition, allowing for calculation of growth inhibition.<br>
The growth over 48 hours of cells in control wells that had been treated with vehicle only (0.25% DMSO) is considered 100% growth and fee growth of cells in wells with 5     compounds is compared to this. Quinazolinone KSF inhibitors inhibited cell<br>
proliferation in human tumor cell lines of the following tumor types: lung (NCI-H460, A549), breast (MDA-MB-231, MCF-7, MCF-7/ADR-RES), colon (HT29, HCTI5), ovarian (SKOV-3, OVCAR-3), leukemia (Hr^60CIB), K-562), central nervous system (5F-268), renal (A498), osteosarcoma (U2-OS), and cervical (HeLa). 10     In addition, a mouse tumor line (B16, melanoma) was also growth-inhibited in the presence of the quinazolinone compounds.<br>
A Giso was calculated by plotting the concentration of compound in uM vs the percentage of cell growth of cell growth in treated wells. The GisQ calculated for the compounds is the estimated concentration at which growth is inhibited by 50% 15     compared to control, i.e., the concentration at which':<br>
100 x [(Treated^ - To) / (Controls - To)] = 50.<br>
All concentrations of compounds are tested in duplicate and controls are averaged over 12 wells. A very similar 96-well plate layout and Giso calculation scheme is used by the National Cancer Institute (see Monks, et al., J. NatL Cancer Inst. 83:757-766 20     (1991)). However, the method by which the National Cancer Institute quantitates cell number does not use MTS, but instead employs alternative methods.<br>
Calculation Of IC50:<br>
Measurement of a composition's IC5D for KSP activity uses an ATPase assay. The following solutions are used: Solution 1 consists of 3 mM phosphoenolpyruvate 25     potassium salt (Sigma P-7127), 2 mM ATP (Sigma A-3377), 1 mM IDTT (Sigma D-9779), 5 piM paclitaxel (Sigma T-7402), 10 ppm antifoam 289 (Sigma A-8436), 25 mM Pipes/KOH pH 6.8 (Sigma P6757), 2 mM MgC12 (VWR JT400301), and 1 mM EGTA (Sigma E3889). Solution 2 consists of 1 mMNADH (SigmaN8129), 0.2 mg/ml BSA (Sigma A7906), pyruvate kinase 7U/mI, Mactate dehydrogenase 10 U/ml<br>
-50-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCT/US01/13901<br>
(Sigma P0294), 100 nM KSP motor domain, 50 ng/ml mictotubules, 1 mM DTT (Sigma D9779), 5 \M paclitaxel (Sigma T-7402), 10 ppm antifoam 289 (Sigma A-8436), 25 mM Pipes/KOH pH 6.8 (Sigma P6757), 2 mM MgC12 (VWR JT4003-01), and I mM EGTA (Sigma E3889). Serial dilutions (8-12 two-fold dilutions) of the 5     composition are made in a 96-well microtiter plate (Corning Costar 3695) using Solution 1. Following serial dilution each well has 50 nl of Solution 1. The reaction is started by adding 50 f^l of solution 2 to each well. This may be done with a multichannel pipettor either manually or with automated liquid handling devices. The microtiter plate is then transferred to a microplate absorbance reader and multiple 10     absorbance readings at 340 nm are taken for each well in a kinetic mode. The<br>
observed rate of change, which is proportional to the ATPase rate, is then plotted as a function of the compound concentration. For a standard ICJO determination the data acquired is fit by the following four parameter equation using a nonlinear fitting program (e.g., Grafit 4):<br><br>
Where y is the observed rate and x the compound concentration.<br>
The quinazolinone compounds inhibit growth in a variety of cell lines, including cell lines (MCF-7/ADR-RES, HCT1 5) that express P-glycoprotein (also known as Multi-drug Resistance, or MDR4), which conveys resistance to other chemotherapeutic 20     drugs, such as pacilitaxel. Therefore, the quinazolinones are anti-mitotics that inhibit cell proliferation, and are not subject to resistance by overexpression of MDR+ by drug-resistant tumor lines.<br>
Other compounds of this class were found to inhibit cell proliferation, although GIso values varied. GI50 values for the quinazolinone compounds tested 25     ranged from 200 nM to greater than the highest concentration tested. By this we mean that although most of the compounds that inhibited KSP activity biochemically did inhibit cell proliferation, for some, at the highest concentration tested (generally about<br>
20 fiM), cell growth was inhibited less than 50%. Many of the compounds have GI50<br>
-51-<br><br>
WO 01/98278	PCT/US01/13901<br>
values less than 10 fjM, and several have GI50 values less than 1 uM. Anti-proliferative compounds that have been successfully applied in the clinic to treatment of cancer (cancer chemotherapeutics) have GISQ'S that vary greatly. For example, in A549 cells, paclitaxel GIso is 4 nM, doxorubicin is 63 nM, 5-fluorouiacil is 1 uM, and 5     hydroxyurea is 500 JIM (data provided by National Cancer Institute, Developmental Therapeutic Program, http://dtp.nci.nih.gov/). Therefore, compounds that inhibit cellular proliferation at virtually any concentration may be useful. However, preferably, compounds will have GIso values of less than 1 mM. More preferably, compounds will have GIso values of less than 20 jtM Even more preferably, 10     compounds will have GI50 values of less than 10 ^M. Further reduction in GIJO values may also be desirable, including compounds with GIso values of less than 1 uM. Some of the quinazolinone compounds of the invention inhibit cell proliferation with GI50 values from below 200 nM to below 10 nM.<br>
Example 11,<br>
15	Female nude mice weighing approximately 20 g were implanted s.c. by trocar<br>
with fragments of human tumor carcinomas harvested from s.c. growing tumors in nude mice host. When the tumors were approximately 77 mg in size, the animals were pah* matched into treatment and control groups. Each group containted 8 rumored mice, each of which was ear-tagged and followed individually throughout the<br>
20     experiment Initial doses (10 mL/kg of a 66 mM Citrate buffer, pH 5.0 / 0.9% Saline / 10% Tween 80 formulation of each test compound having a maximum concentration of 5 mg/mL) were given on Day 1 following pair matching, dosing at the levels and schedules indicated.<br>
Mice were weighed twice weekly, and tumor measurements were taken by 25     calipers twice weekly, starting on Day 1. These tumor measurements were converted to mg tumor weight by a well-known formula, W xL/2. The experiment was terminated when the control group tumor size reached an average of 1 gram. Upon termination, the mice were weighted, sacrificed and their tumors excised. Tumors were weighted and the mean treated tumor weight per group was calculated. In this 30     model, the change in mean treated tumor weight / the change in mean control tumor<br>
