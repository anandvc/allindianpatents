Device at a" spinning preparation machine as for example cleaner, opener, card or the equivalent for coverage of separated waste.<br>
The invention refers to a device at a spinning preparation machine as for example cleaner, opener, card or the equivalent for coverage of separated waste, which emerges out of separating item and is collected in a collecting equipment in which an optical measurement equipment is provided which checks the waste on their dirt share.<br>
In a known device (EP 0399315) the strikers of a cleaning roll support the fibre fluffs over cleaning bars, which are adjustable that way that through it the cleaning intensity is changeable. Below the cleaning bars a brightness sensor measures the brightness as measure for the dirt share of separated refuse (waste), which were separated through the cleaning bars and is collected in a funnel type collection equipment. In specified time interval the refuse material is sucked over a suction transport, which is assembled at lower end of collection equipment. The brightness of separated waste measured by the brightness sensor is provided in a control as signal and shown in an indicator. A disadvantage exists therein that the sensor serves only for coverage for the dirt share, a coverage of stock fibre share does not however take place. Besides it disturbs that the sensor establishes only the brightness difference, so that statements over the composition of refuse materials, particularly over the type of constituents of dirt share are not possible.<br>
The invention lies therefore at the base of the assignment to procure a device of the type described at the entry which avoids the mentioned disadvantages, allows specifically a coverage of stock material share in refuse material <br>
o  o  o 2 o  o<br><br>
2. and make possible a statement over the composition of the refuse material.<br>
The solution of this assignment takes place through the invention, which is an electronic camera assigned to the waste collection equipment which stands in combination with an electronic evaluation equipment (picture processing unit).<br>
Through the measures as per invention the automatic coverage of stock fibre share in refuse material gets in and it makes possiblea statement over the composition of refuse material. The electronic camera and the connecting picture evaluation make possible the exact knowledge of share of stock fibre in refuse material, which are brough in for adjustment of separating item. Besides the electronic picture evaluation allows the reliable statement over the composition of refuse materials (as for example over neps, peeling parts, trash, stock fibres) which permit the conclusion over the works of the machine and leads to a corresponding adjustment of machine- and work items. Therein a continuous, objective and with it staff independent assessment of separated waste takes place. On ground of corresponding pick up - and evaluation technology one is in position, to receive information over the type of waste. Particularly it is possible, to determine the stock fibre share which was separated along and if necessary to infuence. In dependence of obtained results the present machine items can be so shifted that it automatically results a predetermined and desired waste composition.

The cleaning device assembled in a closed housing as for example Truetzschler CVT 4, as per Fig.la the fibre materials (arrow F) under cleaning which is specially cotton, is led in form of fluffs. This takes place as for example through a (not represented) filling box through a conveyor belt or equivalent. The cotton wool is guided by means of pair of feed rolls 1,2 under clamp of a pin roll 3 which is laid in housing rotatable and runs opposite to the clockwise sense (arrow A). The pin roll 3 is reconnected to a trimming roller 4 which is specific with sawtooth filleting. The roll 3 has a circumferential speed of about 10 to 2im/Sec. The roll 4 has a circumferential speed of about 15 to 25 m/sec. The roll 5 has a greater circumferential speed than roll 4 and roll 6 has a greater circumferential speed than roll 5. The rolls 3 and 4 are reconnected one after the other to two further sawtooth rolls 5 or rather 6, whose directions of rotations are denoted with C or rather D. The rolls 3 to 6 have a diameter of about 150mm. to 300mm. The pin roll 3 is surrounded by housing. A separating opening 7 for exit of fibre impurities is allocated to the pin roll 3, whose size is matched or matchable with degree of dirt of cotton wool. A separating edge 12 as for example a knife is allocated to the separating opening 7. In direction of arrow A at the roll 3 further separating opening 8 and a separating edge 13 are present. A separating opening 9 and separating edge 14 are allocated to the sawtooth roll 4, a separating opening 10 and a separating edge 15 are allocated to the sawtooth roll 5, and a separating opening 11 and a separating edge 16 are allocated to the sawtooth roll 6. To each separating knife 12 to 16, a suck-off head 17 to 21 is allocated. With E the working direction of cleaner is denoted.<br>
As per Fig.lb at each suck-off head 17, 18, 19, 20, 21 a suck-off line 22, 23, 24, 25 or rather 26 is connected. The suck-off lines 22 to 26 are combined with a common suck-off<br>
o o o o 5o o<br><br><br><br>
6.<br>
equipment 7 to 11 are denoted. The direction of rotation A, B, C or rather D in each case of adjacent rolls 3,4,5 or rather 6 is different. At end of last roll 6 a pneumatic suck-off line 22 is present for the cleaned fibre materials (arrow H). The circumferential speed of respective relaid rolls is greater than the circumferential speed of respective prelaid rolls. With 23 and 26, the movable air deflector items are denoted, which are brought at the air entry opening of suck-off heads 17 to 26 and is adjustable with the amount of air sucked with it. In the wall of suck-off passage 27 a transparent disc 40 is brought in so that one can see inside the suction passage from outside.<br>
A camera 41 outside of suck-off passage 27 is allocated to disc 40, with which the waste flowing through the suction passage 40 is covered by the camera.<br>
As per Fig.2 the suck-off head 17 is assembled between both the rackwalls 28, 29 (housing walls) in doing so outside of walls 28, 29 at the ends 170a, 17b of suck-off head 17 in each case a support 30a, 30b is built, so that the suck-off head 17 enters two openings in the rack walls 28, 29. A ring shaped elastic sealing 32, as for example out of foam material surrounds the support 30. The one end area 22a of suck-off line 22 joins in the suck-off passage 27a (compare Fig. 1b), the other end area 22b of suction line 22 joins in the suction passage 27b. With 34 a fixing item, as for example a screw combination is denoted. The ends of suck-off passages 27a, 27b are connected to a common suck-off passage 44 (see Fig.4) which is combined to a suck-off source (not represented). The connection of suck-off line 22a at the suck-off head 17 and at the such-off passage 35 corresponds to the connection of suck-off line 22 to the suck-off head 17 and to the suck-off passage 27. On the external side of suck-off passages 27a, 27b in each case a transparent disc 40a or rather 40b is brought in, to the outside of whose suck-off passages 27a or rather 27b a camera 41a or rather<br><br>
7.<br>
41b is allocated, which serves to coverage of, waste material. With the arrows Q and. R the flow direction of suction flow within the suck-off head 17 is denoted.<br>
The cleaning device represented in the Figures la, lb and 2 possesses equipments with which the amount and partly also the type of waste to be separated (foreign materials, trash, neps etc.) may be adjusted or influenced. They are built as deflector blade 37 movable by motor, which are brought in area of openings - and cleaning rolls 3 to 6 before the separator knives. With the angle positioning of this blade 37 one can influence the amount and in certain amount the type of separations 1 (Fig.3). Herein it is valid that a greater opening angle has relatively much separations 1 and a smaller has correspondingly less separations. Through the fixing of desired separations 1, at the same time specially the cleaning effects of the machine on the stock material is determined. Since as rule in this type of separations 1 always also good fibre materials are separated, it holds good in the practical field to find an acceptable, compromise. That means one separates out as much bad materials as possible simultaneously with a minimum separated stock fibre share. In order to assess the separate waste material 1 and so that the possible adjustments may be matched, the waste material 1 is separated, collected and finally assessed visually according to method as per invention.<br>
As per Fig.4 the waste material 1 from the individual locations of separations is covered on each machine side and continuously sucked under vacuum and transported to a central filter - and separating unit 44. As per invention in the "waste material collection line" an optical electrical camera system 41 is integrated with corresponding illumination 42 and evaluation unit* The system is assembled thus and is in such position to cover all fibres<br>
o o o o 8o o<br><br>
8.<br>
foreign or other parts flying inside the line 44. It is further built to distinguish individual materials as well as to supply informations over their amounts and sizes. In dependence on the corresponding specifications, then automatically the machine aggregates (as for example the deflector blade, 37) influencing the waste material 1 is moved so long till the desired waste material quality is reached.<br>
Corresponding to Fig. 5 the camera 41 for example CCD camera a service-and indicator equipment 44 and two blade moving equipment 45a, 45b of the adjustment of deflector blade 37 or rather 37a are connected to an electronic control and regulating equipment 43 (machine control) as for example micro computer over a picture evaluation equipment<br>
42.<br>
In Fig. 6 and 7, 7a, 7b possible assemblies of coverage equipment within a cleaning machine are represented. In case in a machine more number of items, determining the changeable and waste material quality is present, then they show in this way as rule different basic adjustments. In case of input of a central waste material coverage equipment, the items as for example are changed proportional to basic adjustments. Basically in the equipment as per invention other changing conditions are also possible (for example cleaning roll oriented). These can be given (manually or over communication network) stored and if required, can again also be used at a later period of time. A manual change of all these values is also possible. The light sources 42a and 42b associated with the cameras 41a, 41b are used for picture-taking in transmitted light.<br>
In this way following advantages result:<br>
1.	A continuous objective and with it staff independent assessment of separated<br>
waste material takes place.<br>
2.	On ground of corresponding pick up and evaluation technology one is in the<br>
position, to receive<br><br>
9.<br>
information over the type of waste materials. Thus it is, for example possible to determine the stock fibre share,, which was separated along and if required to influence.<br>
3.	Depending on the received results present machine<br>
items (as for example deflector blade, knife) are<br>
moved  such  that  automatically  it  gives  a<br>
predetermined   and   desired   waste   material<br>
composition.<br>
4.	Further,  also  informations  over  the  size  of<br>
separated impurities can be made.<br>
5.	Informations over the consistency  and the amount<br>
of waste material are legible directly on the<br>
machine  service  display  44  and  can  be  given<br>
further  on  a  coordinated  data  covering  -  or<br>
similar system.<br>
For the case that for one machine or similar more number of coverage equipments, particularly as for example each place of separation, are input, it is advantageous as per Fig.8 to use a central evaluation equipment 46 for more number of cameras 41a, 41b to 41n. Through here it gives among others a cost optimised solution. Further only a communication link with the machine control 43 is required and many necessary functions by the cameras 41a to 41n and for evaluation can be used. With Kl to K8, M and N . suck-off air flows are denoted With I, I, and I2 the waste is denoted.        '<br>
The influences of separating item as per the invention depending on the found out waste material consistency or rather quality can be applied in all machines, which show the corresponding equipments. Particularly the cards are also to be seen here.<br>
The system can make relative good statements over the weight<br>
o o o o 10 o o<br><br>
10.<br>
of separation at corresponding specification. Thus, since as rule also the production is known, statements over the condition of stock material for separation is realisable. Since the type and size of separated particles are determined corresponding statements can be made with the help of one time empirically found  out weights.<br>
Example.<br>
For all separated particles there exists a relation between number, type, size and weight. When last relation is determined and specified, then with help of statements obtained as per invention, corresponding weight statements over type and number are possible with a sufficient exactness.<br>
If one relates these values yet on the time, then one obtaips as for example a statement over it, how, many grams per hour are separated. If, one takes now known values over the production (kg/to) yet in addition to it and puts this to the waste values in the relation, then one can obtain a percentage statement over the separated waste (as for example 3% wastes are separated).<br>
A further advantage exists therein,, that one can specify with the equipments as per invention as for example limiting values for definite parameters.<br>
Example.<br>
One receives a warning, when the separated amount is greater than X-gram.<br>
Further to this, one can guide thus automatically produced material specific statistics and determine which materials are provided with how much impurities. In this way a customer is optimum supported as for example in the selection of the right base materials for definite products.<br>
