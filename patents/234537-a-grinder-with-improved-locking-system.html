This invention relates to a grinder with improved locking system.  The grinder may particularly be a table top wet/dry grinder.<br>
Everyday Indian cooking requires dry/wet grinding of masalas, pulses and cereals. Mixies and liquidisers initially used in modem kitchens for wet and dry grinding were found inadequate mid were replaced by electrically operated stone finders. This type avoided the main drawbacks of maxi grinding and allow processing of larger quantities of food. Taste, texture and flavor of the food items cooked therewith matched the conventional food products. However, these grinders occupy large floor space, are not visually appealing, and are difficult to lift and clean. Tabletop wet grinders are developed thereafter combined utility and visual appeal.<br>
Dry and wet grinders available in the market at present have various types of locking mechanisms. One type of the popular grinders has an ann hinged at one side thereof and is locked at the other side during the process of grinding. A spring loaded locking system locks the roller shaft and exerts pressure on the grinding stones when locked. The top arm has to be pressed with considerable force to compress the spring and load. The arm gets locked in position automatically. After finding, the arm is pressed further to release the lock and is then rotated about its pivot to facilitate removal of the drum.<br>
In yet another popular model of wet/dry grinder, the base of the grinder is provided with a central rod into which the drum with  its central shaft is positioned. The roller shaft is assembled and its stem is held in position with the central shaft by a lock nut. This is also considered to be a tough operation.<br><br>
This invention has been developed in order to overcome multiple operations of loading and locking. Compression of the spring is made easy and the pillar or support on which the top arm is pivoted in the hitherto known grinders is eliminated. This avoids a major hindrance during placing and removal of the drum on to the base of the grinder. Furthermore, the grinder assembly is made very contact.<br>
The grinder according to this invention has a rotatably drum or container positioned on a base frame. The base of this drum is made of stone and has a central shaft sealingly positioned within for transmitting rotary motion from the drive means. A roller assembly consisting of at least two rollers on a roller shaft provided for positioning latched to the central shaft. A top arm is pivotably mounted on the housing member for positioning a lid tort the container thereon. One end of the top arm is provided with a coupling means to couple the roller shaft with the top arm. This coupling means is also provided with a spring loaded plunger assembly which aligns with the roller shaft when in position and holds it in place while exerting load during grinding. A partially rotatably knob member rests on a pin centrally located on the spring loaded plunger assembly housed in a housing. A spring member of the plunger assembly is comprised and decompressed when the knob is rotated in the clock-wise or anti clockwise direction to exert spring load on the roller shaft.<br>
A slider mechanism is associated with the coupling means and is located on the top arm. A hook and lock pin arrangement locks and unlocks the top arm when the knob is rotated appropriately. Thus, the locking and unlocking which is automatic and do not require any other tedious operation as seen in the existing grinders.<br><br>
The spring loaded plunger assembly may have a set of cams. The top cam is rotatable with the knob and the bottom cam moves up and down guided by the housing. Downward movement of the bottom cam compresses the spring member and creates the load for grinding. Both the top and the bottom cams have a set of gradually tapered face cams matching with each other to facilitate the up and down movement of the bottom cam. In this embodiment, after the arm is placed horizontal above the drum, the knob is rotated in the anti clockwise direction to facilitate the slider mechanisms provided on the arm to rotate the hook which locks against the pin provided therefor and further rotation of the said knob compress the spring to create load on roller shaft for finding.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the locking system used in the grinder of this invention, a compression spring is sandwiched between a top nut and a sleeve fitted with a bottom nut which butts against the bottom face of the top nut. The sleeve is fitted with the bottom nut through pins in such a way that the bottom nut can slide up and down along with the top nut, spring and the sleeve. A long pitch threaded pin is provided to facilitate movement of the top and bottom nuts by taking the sleeve along with their movements. The top nut is guided by the housing and the bottom nut is guided by the sleeve which prevent the rotation of the nuts but permits only up and down movement. The rotatably knob compresses and decompresses the spring. The top dead center of the assembly is fixed and the bottom dead center is flexible. This enables to correct the variation in the height of the roller shaft assembly due to wear of the rollers. In the resting position, the spring is supported by the long pitch threaded pin which forms an integral part of the knob through the sleeve, pins and the bottom nut. After placing the arm horizontal  above the drum, the knob is rotated to move the slider mechanism to rotate the hook for locking the arm against the lock pin.    The<br><br>
locking system moves down the sleeve till the sleeve rests on the central stem of the roller shaft. A further rotation of the knob releases the sleeve by moving the bottom and the top nuts downward slightly. This frees the bottom nut from the spring and the spring load rests on the sleeve and hence on the roller shaft. In this condition, the bottom nut will be resting on the sleeve to arrest it from moving up during  the grinding process. In this embodiment of the locking system, the compression of the spring and hence the grinding load is kept uniform or constant throughout the life of the grinder. This is because of the flexibility permissible in the downward movement of the sleeve.<br>
When the knob is rotated in the opposite direction the lop and the bottom nuts move up, picking up the sleeve from its seat on the roller shaft. This facilitates the release of a spring load, and the slider mechanism unlocks the hook from the locking pin. The arm is rotated and the drum is removed from is base.<br>
When the arm is placed horizontally above the drum, there is enough clearance between the roller shaft and the sleeve. Hence there is no spring load initially which reduces the fatigue of locking the arm. The arm may also be provided with a seating for placing the lid or cover member thereon.<br>
The grinder with improved locking system according to this invention comprises a rotatable stone based drum provided with a centrally located shaft, a roller shaft consisting of at least one pair of roller stones at one end thereof positioned latched to said central shaft, a fittable top arm pivoted MI one side of said grinder, the other end of said arm being provided with a locking system for locking said arm with said roller shaft, said locking system consisting of a housing containing a spring  loaded  plunger  assemblv  thereon,   a  partially  rotatable  knob  member<br><br>
connected to a central pin of said plunger assembly wherein partial rotation of said knob member in one direction compresses said spring loaded plunger assembly, and exert load thereon while partial rotation in the opposite direction decompresses the same to release the spring load and the said locking system consists of a slide member operably connected to a hook and lock pin assembly, means for energizing the grinder and a detachable cover member for said drum.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the figures in the accompanying drawings.<br>
