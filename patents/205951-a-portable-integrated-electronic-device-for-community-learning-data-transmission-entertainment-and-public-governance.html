THE FOLLOWING SPECIFICATION PARTICULARLY DESCRIBES AND ASCERTAINS THE NATURE OF THIS INVENTION AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT IS TO BE PERFORMED.<br><br><br>
TITLE<br>
A PORTABLE INTEGRATED ELECTRONIC DEVICE FOR COMMUNITY LEARNING, DATA TRANSMISSION, ENTERTAINMENT AND PUBLIC GOVERNANCE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of electronic devices and more specifically to a portable integrated multimedia electronic device built on convergence technology, particularly for use in, but not limited to receipt, storage and processing of digital and/or analog signals from satellites, broadcasts, telecasts, recording means and for ultra-large size display of images, for community use in the areas of education, shared learning, emergency and disaster handling, community awareness, promotional and publicity campaigns, public governance, entertainment, internet, broadcast access and so on.<br>
BACKGROUND ART:<br>
In the current economic and social scenario, there exists widespread awareness of and demand for multi-media content and its receipt, storage, processing, transmission and display on a community level. Various communities which seek and need the aforesaid include families, schooling communities, village councils and gatherings, public governance officials, investor communities, members, governing bodies, boards and councils of public bodies, communities, public and private enterprises and the like.<br><br><br>
Current technology requires use of several different, complex and expensive electronic devices and systems for the fulfillment of each of the aforesaid requirements for any or all of the said communities. Currently/* the products available for such purposes include multi-media computers, television sets, large format electronic display devices, audio players, VCD players, DVD players, game stations, projectors and special projection screens. Each of these products seeks to address one or more of the stated community requirements. Some of such products are:<br>
a).   Large field of view device for community uses.<br>
b).   Superwide angle lens for larger images.<br>
c).    Mobile entertainment systems combining projector, DVD player and hard disk drive.<br>
d). Hyperformance home theatres.<br>
e). Devices for connecting and using multiple products in conjunction.<br>
f). Combination of multimedia computer and television.<br>
Summarized below are descriptions of such products in the prior art which seek to satisfy one or more of the aforesaid community requirements:<br>
a). Large field of view device for community uses<br>
One such attempt to provide a large field of view for community presentation is disclosed in US patent 6,042,238 which teaches an invention on an image projection display system for use in large field-of-view presentation, comprising a fold-mirror image arrangement and a plurality of projection devices.     The use of this system  is  limited to<br><br><br>
simulation, leisure, computer aided design or visualization where multi¬channel displays are to be used to immerse the observer to some degree in an alternative environment. This system highlights the difficulties inherent in providing large format displays of images at affordable prices.<br>
b).   Superwide angle lens for larger images<br>
Another known device uses a superwide angle lens which projects a 60 inch image at a distance of 1.5 meters and a wider 100 inch image at a distance of 2.4 meters. [See the Hitachi website at www.hitachi.com for multimedia mobile LCD projector model CP X275].<br>
c). Mobile entertainment systems combining projector, DVD player and hard disk drive<br>
The REX mobile entertainment system - Bronze which won the Australian Design Award [see the Australian design awards website at desianaward.com.au/ADA/0101/STUDENT%2-DESIGN/610/6101 features a combination of 3 currently available products, an ultra-portable projector, a portable DVD {(digital video disc )} player, and a portable hard disk drive. But the system is not suitable for community use because it lacks a portable integration of computing, TV viewing, and interactive functions and the simplicity of operation required for community use.<br>
d). Hyperformance home theatres<br>
The HT -400 Series Home Theatre PC from Hyperformance Solutions [see www.hyperformancesolutions.com/HTPC/HT-400.htm] provides the functions of a VCR, CD player, DVD player, video scaler, video de-interlacer and personal computer in one unit which connects to the home TV.  Apart from being relatively expensive, it presents many disadvantages <br><br>
as regards community usage.<br>
e). Devices for connecting and using multiple products in conjunction<br>
The U.S Patent No. 6,522,419 granted to Ko Yoonyang features a single<br>
device to which various input and output devices can be conveniently and<br>
easily attached.     However, the teachings of	this U.S Patent No.<br>
6,522,419 suffer from the following drawbacks and disadvantages.<br>
1)	The device as disclosed in the U.S. Patent No.6, 522,419 is an aggregation of known sub-assemblies which is not sufficiently user-friendly as many connections have to be made in the front portion of the device for various input and output devices, and also the device summons on the part of the user, familiarity and knowledge of different types of connectors and cables, which cannot be expected and assumed to be available with new users, particularly in rural areas in developing countries where technology percolation is low.<br>
2)	The device involves external connection of various input and output devices and hence does not provide a portable integrated system; hence it is susceptible to damage, loss or vandalism.<br><br>
3)	The display of images is limited to large format electronic displays or the use of a separate projector for projecting the images of the output devices, which have inherent display size limitations.<br>
4)	The device is relatively expensive to procure and operate and is likely to be beyond the reach of most rural communities in India and other developing countries.<br><br><br>
5)	The device requires a special controller which may be difficult for rural and uneducated persons to operate.<br>
6)	Since the device requires a multiplicity of input and output devices the1 use of several voltage stabilizing devices and uninterrupted power supply devices would become indispensable in rural India and other locations where  power supply is  not reliable and  steady,  leading to additional complexity and overall cost increase of the device..<br>
7)	The device relies on an exclusive operating system and main program installed on a chip which limits the options for upgrading and also increases the costs of up gradation.<br>
8)	The device needs a specially devised "Integrated environmental central processing unit" in addition to the central processing units in some of the connected devices.<br>
9)	The device does not provide for a 'single' button start-up function, f). Combination of multimedia computer and television<br>
A further attempt to provide an integrated electronic device is a combination of multi-media computer and television apparatus disclosed in US Patent application publication Nos. 20020050083 and 20020021420 by M/s. Zarelius Gister and Yaniv Svi respectively. The above devices combine two expensive systems to provide a choice of displays of computer (data) signals or TV broadcast signals but are limited in their displays to the size of large format TV sets, which inherently limit their use to families. An audience of, say, 50 to 100 people would have difficulty in using such a device.<br><br><br>
SUMMARY OF PRIOR ART<br>
From the foregoing discussion with regard to the prior art devices7ahd from .<br>
an overall perspective, all the devices mentioned above:	 <br>
(i) Are susceptible to damage, loss or vandalizing in community' use (ii) Present formidable cultural and technological barriers to new users;<br>
(iii)   Present  technological   and   budgetary  challenges  for  up-gradation, maintenance and obsolescence mitigation.<br>
Apart from the above drawbacks, the above devices require large storage and usage spaces, peripheral and auxiliary devices and facilities including temperature controls, dust controls and security.<br>
Therefore, there has been a need for development of a portable integrated electronic device which combines multitude of functions as discussed above for use in receipt, storage and processing of digital and/or analog signals from satellites, broadcasts, telecasts, recording means and for ultra-large size display of images, for community use in the areas of education, shared learning, emergency and disaster handling, community awareness, promotional and publicity campaigns, public governance, entertainment, internet and broadcast access and so on.<br>

and data projector in one single, portable device, a number of advantages accrue from the synergy of the combination which are^pot available when the individual products are used alone.<br>
The advantages of synergy resulting from the combination of functions in the present invention as compared to separate products are listed below:<br>
•    As Audio Player<br>
■	The combination of hard disk storage with an audio player eliminates the need for storage of audio content on separate media (CDs/cassettes etc.) as such content can be sorted on the internal hard disk. By having all the audio content on the internal hard disk the need to separately protect and store safely a collection of CDs and Cassettes is eliminated.<br>
■	The combination of audio CD player with the computer permits all the audio content to be catalogued, ordered and stored in various combinations, and played immediately at will through software search. This saves the time required to search and play the desired content.<br>
■	The combination of audio player with the internal hard disk storage of all audio content eliminates the need for physically inserting different CDs to play such CDs; and any audio content on the hard disk can be selected and played using the remote control device.<br>
   The combination of audio player with a large format date projector and computer allows any music to be played along with dynamic visuals on the large screen, through the various media players<br><br><br>
available as software on the computer.   Hearing and seeing the music simultaneously on the large screen provides a new audio¬visual experience for the music, as compared to conventional audio players.<br>
As a Large Format Television<br>
■	The device gives large format television viewing in a size up to 300 inches, which is much larger than the commercially available large format plasma or projection television<br>
■	The device occupies very little space as compared to the huge bulk of the large format TVs. It can be kept on a shelf on the wall, so that the complete floor space is free, and results in considerable space saving.<br>
■	The combination of TV tuner and multi-media projector allows users to vary the size of the projected image depending on space availability; which is not possible with large format TVs, which have a fixed screen size and enable viewing in one size only.<br>
■	As the image is projected on any plain surface or wall, no special electronic display devices such as plasma displays or projector screens are required to be installed.<br>
■	The projected image is the flattest possible without any thickness or weight, and disappears when there is no projection, thus eliminating the need to protect an expensive display device.<br>
■	The small size of the device according to the present invention allows the device to be locked away securely when not in use, thus  <br><br>
making it easy to protect - which is an important advantage in community use situations.<br>
•	As a DVD/VCD Player<br>
■	The combination of DVD/VCD player with the data projector allows DVD/VCD content to be displayed in ultra large sizes of about 300 inches, providing movie theatre experience, which is much superior as compared to the large format projection TVs or plasma displays.<br>
■	Preferred content can be stored on the hard disk enabling it to be played at will from a distance without having to insert individual DVDs/VCDs.<br>
•	As a Gaming Station.<br>
■	The combination of the computer and projector in one unit allows<br>
games to be displayed in ultra-large size, thus providing an<br>
enhanced enveloping viewing/participatory experience while<br>
playing games. Typical genres of games such as Car and<br>
Motorcycle races, Action, Space Adventure, Thrillers all provide<br>
heightened experience when played in ultra-large size.<br>
•   As a Multimedia Internet computer<br>
■	The combination of projector and the computer in one unit allows<br>
internet and multimedia content to be shared by a large audience,<br>
allowing participatory viewing by a community of users. Group<br>
viewing in large size enables more comfortable viewing of the<br>
content together with family and friends, such as from the living<br><br><br>
room sofa or the bed; as compared to viewing on the small computer screen where one has to sit upright close to the computer.<br>
•    NEW POSSIBILITIES<br>
■	A large number of new use possibilities emerge because of the<br>
small size, portability and the ultra large projected image. Some of<br>
these are listed below:<br>
« The devices of the invention will be the only piece of equipment required for showing content to a large group of people; reducing the investment required to equip an AV [audio-visual] room for all educational situations such as schools, coaching classes, training centres, seminars , community centres etc.; thus making possible emergence of many such group learning centres at low costs. By common explanation to a large audience, substantial time and effort savings will result by not having to repeat the same content or message to smaller groups repeatedly.<br>
■	The low investment required will allow opening of small media centres/video theatres; thus resulting in new business opportunities for the small entrepreneurs.<br>
■	Being a single portable product, which can be rented easily, it will develop a rental business opportunity for the product.<br>
■	By carrying it in a vehicle, and drawing power from the battery of the vehicle; the device could function as a mobile device for promotion and awareness programmes in the remotest parts of countries and provinces where there may be no electricity supply.  <br><br>
■	By attaching a web-camera, the device will allow live video¬conferencing in the remotest areas, thus allowing better management of disaster situations etc., by allowing two sided live exchange of images and conversation. The video-conferencing in remote areas will also facilitate e-governance to better monitor and govern the situation in the field by direct viewing from the seat of governance.<br>
■	Further objects and advantages become apparent from a consideration of the drawings and the ensuing descriptions.<br>
•    BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
■	The invention is a portable integrated electronic device, comprising<br>
6 major sub-assembles, providing all the functions of an internet<br>
enabled multi-media computer; television, ultra-large image display,<br>
audio player, VCD player, DVD player, game station and a data<br>
projector in one single portable box. All components of various<br>
