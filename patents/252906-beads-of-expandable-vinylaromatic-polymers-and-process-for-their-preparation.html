				<td>BEADS OF EXPANDABLE VINYLAROMATIC POLYMERS AND PROCESS FOR THEIR PREPARATION<br>
The present invention relates to beads of expandable vinylaromatic polymers and a process for their preparation. More specifically, the present invention relates to an expandable polystyrene in the form of beads with a reduced formation of lumps and the process for its preparation.<br>
Vinylaromatic polymers, and among these, polystyrene in particular, are known products which have been adopted for a long time for preparing compact and/or expanded articles which can be used in various applicative sectors, among which the most important are household appliances, the transport and building industries, office machines, etc. A particularly interesting sector is the field of thermal insulation, where vinylaromatic polymers are essentially used m expanded form.<br>
These expanded products are obtained by swelling, in a pre-expander, beads of expandable polymer previously impregnated with an expanding agent and molding the swollen<br>
particles inside a closed mould by means of the contemporaneous effect of pressure and temperature.<br>
The swelling, or pre-expansion, of the particles is generally effected with vapour, or another gas, maintained at a temperature slightly higher than the glass transition temperature (Tg) of the polymer. During this phase, the particles tend to stick to each other and to avoid this drawback, they are treated with additives generally known as anti-lumping additives.<br>
The addition of metallic stearates, such as magnesium stearate, is known, for example. This additive is extremely effective in preventing the beads from sticking during the pre-expansion phase but results in poor adhesion in the moulding phase during the preparation of the end-products.<br>
U.S. patent 3,52 0,83 3 describes the use of lecithin, added with the expanding agent during the impregnation of the particles, as anti-lumping additive. Unfortunately, lecithin gives the end-products an unacceptable odour making their use problematical.<br>
U.S. patent 3,444,104 describes the use of calcium and silicon aluminates. The lumps, in this case, are eliminated and the adhesion remains acceptable. The density of the beads in expansion, however, is poor.<br>
U.S. patent 3,4 62,293 describes the use of a polymeric latex, for example polyethylene or SAN copolymer, deposited<br>
on the particles. The subsequent drying treatment of the latex with air, however, requires long times which make the preparation process quite unsuitable for industrial development .<br>
Finally, European patent 449,065 describes the use of oxides such as silica, alumina and titanium oxide. Although these products have a good capacity against the formation of lumps, they have the disadvantage, as specified above, of reducing the adhesion of the expanded beads during the moulding phase.<br>
There are evident disadvantages associated with these systems for avoiding the formation of lumps as they either jeopardize the adhesion of the expanded beads, or the expansion of the beads themselves or they require processes, for example drying, which are too elaborate for being conveniently used in the industrial field.<br>
The Applicant has now found a simple system for eliminating the formation of agglomerates of swollen vinylaro-matic polymer beads without jeopardizing the subsequent adhesion and/or expandability.<br>
An object of the present invention therefore relates to beads of expandable vinylaromatic polymers which comprise :<br>
a) a matrix obtained by polymerizing 50-100% by weight of one or more vinylaromatic monomers and 0-5 0% by weight of<br>
at least one copolymer!zable monomer;<br>
b)	1-10% by weight, calculated with respect to the polymer (a) , of an expanding agent englobed in the polymeric matrix;<br>
c)	2 ppm-2% by weight, calculated with respect to the polymer (a) , of an anti-lumping additive, distributed on the surface of the beads, selected from oxides of metals of groups IB and VIIIB or from mixtures consisting of oxides of metals of groups IB, I IB and VIIIB and esters of C8-C25 fatty acids with the same metals.<br>
A further object of the present invention relates to a process for the preparation of expandable vinylaromatic polymer beads which comprises:<br>
polymerizing 50-100% by weight of one or more vinylaromatic monomers and 0-50% by weight of at least one co-polymerizable monomer;<br>
englobing an expanding agent in the polymeric matrix; and<br>
distributing on the surface of the beads obtained 2 ppm-2% by weight, calculated with respect to the polymer, of an anti-lumping additive selected from oxides of metals of groups IB and VII IB or from mixtures consisting of oxides of metals of groups IB, IIB and VIIIB and esters of C8~C25 fatty acids with the same metals.<br>
According to the present invention, the vinylaromatic<br>
polymers   can   be   obtained   with   a   polymerization   process   in aqueous   suspension   or   continuous   mass.    In  particular,    the polymerization   in   suspension   of   the   vinylaromatic   monomer is   carried   out  under   conditions   and   an   the presence   of   additives  well   known  in  the   art.   In  addition  to   the   suspending agent,   selected  from insoluble  inorganic  salts,   for  example   calcium  or  magnesium  such   as   tricalcium  phosphate   or magnesium phosphate,   or  from organic   suspending  agents   such as   polyvinylpyrrolidone,    the  polymerization   is   carried   out m   the   presence   of   an   initiating   system   or    an   expanding system.<br>
The initiating system generally comprises two peroxides, one with a halving time of an hour at 85-95°C and the other with a halving time of an hour at 110-120°C. Examples of these initiators are benzoylperoxide and terbutylperben-zoate.<br>
Any expanding agent capable of being englobed in the polymeric matrix can be used in a combination with the vinylaromatic polymers object of the present invention. In general, liquid substances are used, with a boiling point ranging from 10 to 100°C, preferably from 20 to 80°C. Typical examples are aliphatic hydrocarbons, freon, carbon dioxide,   water,   etc.<br>
The expanding agent can be added to the polymer during the  polymerization  phase   in   suspension,    or,    alternatively,<br>
by impregnation of the beads produced at the end of the polymerization or by injection into the molten polymer according to the continuous mass preparation process. At the end of the addition, a polymer is obtained in the form of beads, which can be transformed to produce expanded articles with a density ranging from 5 to 50 g/1, preferably from 8 to 25 g/1, with an excellent thermal insulation capacity. In order to favour the retention of the expanding agent in the polymeric matrix, additives capable of forming bonds both of the weak type (for example hydrogen bridges) or strong type (for example acid-base adducts) , can be used with the expanding agent. Examples of these additives are methyl alcohol,  isopropyl alcohol, dioctylphthalate,  dimethyl carbonate, compounds containing an amine group, etc. These additives are generally added during the polymerization and/or englobed in the polymer together with the expanding agent.<br>
The expanding agents are preferably added during the polymerization phase and are selected from aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons containing from 3 to 6 carbon atoms, such as n-pentane, iso-pentane, cyclopentane or their mixtures; halogenated derivatives of aliphatic hydrocarbons containing from 1 to 3 carbon atoms such as, for example, dichlorodifluoromethane, 1,2,2-trifluoroethane, 1,1, 2-trifluoroethane; carbon dioxide and water.<br>
The term "vinylaromatic monomer", as used in the present description and claims, essentially refers to a product which corresponds to the following general formula:<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
wherein n is zero or an integer ranging from 1 to 5, R is a hydrogen atom or a methyl and Y is a halogen, such as chlorine or bromine, or an alkyl or alkoxyl radical having from 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of vinylaromatic monomers having the general<br>
formula defined above are: styrene, a-methylstyrene, me-thylstyrene,  ethylstyrene,  butylstyrene,  dimethylstyrene,<br>
mono-, di-,  tri-,  tetra- and penta-chlorostyrene, bromo-<br>
styrene, methoxy-styrene, acetoxy-styrene, etc. Styrene and<br>
a-methylstyrene are the preferred vinylaromatic monomers.<br>
The vinylaromatic monomers having general formula (I) can be used alone or in a mixture of up to 5 0% by weight with other copolymerizable monomers. Examples of these monomers are (meth)acrylic acid, C1-C4 alkyl esters of (meth)acrylic acid, such as methyl acrylate, methyl-methacrylate, ethyl acrylate, ethylmethacrylate, isopropyl acrylate, butyl acrylate, amides and nitriles of (meth)acrylic  acid  such  as  acrylamide,  methacrylamide,<br>
acrylonitrile, methacrylonitrile, butadiene, ethylene, di-vinylbenzene, maleic anhydride, etc. Preferred copolymeriz-able monomers are acrylonitrile and methylmethacrylate.<br>
The vinylaromatic polymer or copolymer which is obtained has a molecular weight Mw ranging from 50,000 to 250,000, preferably from 70,000 to 200,000. In general, greater details on a process for the preparation of expandable vinylaromatic polymers in aqueous solution or, more generally, on polymerization in suspension, can be found in Journal of Macromolecular Science, Review in Macromolecular Chemistry and Physics c31 (263) 215-299 (1991) or in international patent application WO 98/51734.<br>
Conventional additives, generally used with commercial materials, such as pigments, stabilizers, flame-retardant agents, antistatic agents, detaching agents, shock-resistant agents, etc., can be added to the expandable vinylaromatic polymers obtained with the process, object of the present invention. In particular, it is preferable to add mineral fillers of athermanous materials during the polymerization, such as graphite or refracting agents such as titanium dioxide, in a quantity ranging from 0.05 to 25% by weight, calculated with respect to the resulting polymer.<br>
At the end of the polymerization, substantially spherical polymer beads are obtained, with an average diameter ranging from 0.2 to 2 mm, inside which the expanding<br>
agent is homogeneously dispersed.<br>
To improve the stability of the suspension, it is possible to increase the viscosity of the reagent solution by dissolving the vinylaromatic polymer therein, in a concentration ranging from 1 to 3 0% by weight, preferably from 5 to 2 0%, calculated with respect to the monomer alone. The solution can be obtained either by dissolving a preformed polymer (for example fresh polymer or the waste products of previous polymerizations and/or expansions) in the reagent mixture or by pre-polymerizing the monomer, or mixture of monomers, in mass, in order to obtain the above concentrations, and then continuing the polymerization in aqueous suspension in the presence of the remaining additives.<br>
At the end of the polymerization, the beads are discharged from the polymerization reactor, washed and dried.<br>
The beads produced are subjected to pre-treatment generally applied to traditional materials and which essentially consists in:<br>
1.	coating the beads with a liquid antistatic agent such as amines, tertiary alkylamines, ethylene oxide-propylene oxide copolymers, etc. The purpose of this agent is to facilitate both the adhesion of the coating and also the screening of the beads prepared in suspension;<br>
2.	applying the coating to the above beads, said coating essentially consisting of a mixture of mono-, di- and<br>
tri-esters of glycerin (or other alcohols) with fatty acids; and 3.  distributing on the surface of the beads, the anti-lumping additive preferably selected from powders of oxides of iron (Fe203) , copper (CuO) and zinc (ZnO) , optionally mixed with the corresponding ester of fatty acids such as stearic acid, palmitic acid, myristic acid, etc. The anti-lumping additive is generally used in the form of powders with an average particle-size ranging<br>
from 0.1 to 5 0 urn.<br>
