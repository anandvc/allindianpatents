DESCRIPTION:<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION;<br>
The invention relates to herbal ant repellent composition for protecting a material or an area from ant infestation especially red ants, garden ants and carpenter ants in a selected quantity consisting of 35%Turmeric powder extract containing   10 % of Curcuminoid compound , 50%Neem powder extract containing 15% of liminoid compound , 10%Clove oil containing 90% of Eugenol and 5% Eucalyptus oil containing 70 % of Cineol ,sorbed on particulate sorptive substrate to obtain a controlled release system .<br>
The present invention also relates to synergistic composition comprising of Turmeric powder extract containing cucuminoid (irritant to skin and mucous membrane ) , Neem powder extract containing liminoid ( Anti-feedant) with plant essential oils namely Clove oil containing eugenol (insect attractant) and Eucalyptus oil containing cineol(irritant to tissue, sensory organ ).<br>
The present invention also relates to a herbal ant repellent composition comprises plant extracts and plant essential oils sorbed on particulate sorption substate to obtain a controlled release system. Controlled release systems, unlike the conventional formulations, facilitate a gradual and controlled discharge of the repellent, reducing the losses by evaporation and leaching and minimizing the wastage.<br>
The invention is aimed at various species of ants that poses significant economic and health problem human especially red ants, carpenter ants and garden ants.<br>
This invention related to human necessities. Further this invention relates to Herbal formulation useful as a natural ant repellent without having insecticidal effect. The herbal ant repellent composition is highly effective, cheep, eco friendly and does not pollute the atmosphere.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PRIOR ART<br>
It is well known in the art excessive and indiscriminate use of synthetic pesticides and insecticides for the last few decades has been one of the important factors for the pollution of our water, air, earth and ecosystem. With the increasing awareness of these factors, the search for natural eco-friendly pesticide and insecticide is under progress. Such products are less likely to be harm full ,biodegradable and non-polluting .Hence development of a herbal formulation useful as a natural ant repellent without having insecticidal effect will be of great use to the public.<br>
The synthetic ant repellent which are used in every house is made up of toxic chemicals like DDT, gammaxene, methylchlor, parathion, malathion, boric acid, deltamethrin, pyrethroids, chlorinated hydrocarbons, organo phosphates, carbamates etc. These products are not eco friendly in nature, highly toxic and injurious to human beings. They also possess obnoxious odor, cumulative toxicity in soil and pollutes the environment. Additionally insecticide often unintentionally destroys other beneficial species, including birds and mammals.<br>
They also cause some undesirable effect on human like head ache, giddiness, vertigo, nausea, vomiting, blurring vision, excessive sweating and salivation. There is a need for a compound<br><br>
that is relatively non-toxic to birds and mammals, but is still effective as a repellent to ants. Insecticides and insect repellent are of course well-known in the prior art, as in evidenced by the following patents.<br>
U.S. Pat Nos. 4,985,251; 4,983,390; 4,818,534; and 4,983,389- Employ absorbent organic polymers for widespread dehydration of the insects .<br>
U.S. Pat. Nos. 2,423,284 and 4,948,013, European Patent Application No. 462 347, Chemical Abstracts 119(5):43357q (1993) and Farm Chemicals Handbook, page cl02 (1987)- Use of inorganic salts as components of pesticides has also been tried.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,490,360 - directed to an insect repellent which comprises as an active component a naturally derived composition from fireflies. Although the firefly extract is designed to repel certain insects, no repellent effect is demonstrated against ants.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,707,496 - directed to an insect repellent soap composition which includes, as an active ingredient, a repellent chemical such as N,N-diethyl-metatoluamide, and an insecticide such as 3-phenoxybenzyl (.+-.), cis trans-2,2-dimethyl-3-2(3,3 dichlorvinyl) cyclopropane-1-carboxylate. The soap PG 4 is designed to have repellent properties against biting insects. This formulation contains synthetic chemicals.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 4,762,716 - directed to annonin (a synthetic chemical), a compound having insecticidal properties and not advisable to place near shelves or containers containing food items and in play grounds.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 3,647,416 discloses that bonded fertilizers may be produced in the form of a briquette using ureaformaldehyde resin as the binder. U.S. Pat. No. 3,024,098 also discloses a ureaformaldehyde based fertilizer which is prepared by compressing into agglomerates to provide briquettes or spikes with high resistances to crushing.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,174,804 a fertilizer/pesticide composition was disclosed which included a fertilizer and a pesticide admixed with a binder to form a briquette in which the fertilizer occludes the pesticide, with the briquette essentially free of water soluble materials. This briquette contains synthetic pesticide.<br>
Although many patents have claimed for the art of controlled release plant pesticides, there is no method for separate control of the release of the herbal ant repellents and it does not provide a detail on the amounts of plant constituent to be added in a particulate sorption solids.<br>
In recent times, regulatory guidelines have encouraged a search for potentially less dangerous repellent composition via stringent restrictions on the use of certain synthetic pesticides and repellent. As a result, elimination of effective pesticides and repellent from the market has limited economical and effective options for controlling pests. In addition ,there is a need for a method and a composition for treating the household to kill and repel insect pests. As an alternative, botanical pesticides and repellents are of great interest because they are natural, derived from plants that are safe to humans and the environment.<br><br>

OBJECTIVE OF THE INVENTION:<br>
A primary object of the present invention is to provide novel herbal ant repellent compositions for use against household ants like red ants, carpenter ants and garden ants and the novel herbal ant repellent compositions for the control of ants containing 35 % Turmeric powder extract containing    10%ofCurcuminoid, 50% Neem powder extract containing 15 % of liminoid, 10 % Clove oil containing 90 % of Eugenol and 5 % Eucalyptus oil containing 70 % of Cineol ,sorbed on particulate sorption substrate to obtain a controlled release system.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to prove the synergistic compositions comprising of Turmeric powder extract containing cucuminoid which is an irritant to skin and mucous membrane, Neem powder extract containing liminoid which acts as anti-feedant and the plant essential oils namely Clove oil containing eugenol is an insect attractant and Eucalyptus oil containing cineol causes tissue irritation and contact poison, which also produces temporary impairment of sensory organs of the insects.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide an improved herbal ant repellent composition wherein repellent is sorbed on, or in, a particulate sorption substrate to obtain a controlled release system which releases throughout a long period of time.<br>
It is still another object to provide a repellent composition comprises controlled release plant extracts and plant essential oils sorbed on particulate sorption substrate namely to facilitate a gradual and controlled discharge of the repellent, reducing the losses by evaporation and leaching and minimizing the wastage.<br>
It is a further object to provide a repellent which is easy to apply, a special container or a stand are not required and the repellent can be directly placed around the containers, food cupboard, and kitchen shelves, floor cots, which would hold food or food particles which would attract ants.<br>
It is still another object to provide a repellent composition and method that has a pleasant scent and that can be applied without burdensome safety precautions.<br>
It is a further object to provide a safe, non-toxic repellent composition and method that will not harm mammals or the environment. Which is beneficial in that it will allow amicable ecosystems of human and insect populations.<br>
It is still another object to provide a herbal ant repellent composition which can be inexpensively produced or employed.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION:<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a novel herbal ant repellent compositions for use against household ants like red ants, carpenter ants and garden ants and the novel herbal ant repellent compositions for the control of ants containing 35 % Turmeric powder extract containing 10 %of Curcuminoid,50 %Neem powder extract containing 15% of liminoid, 10 % Clove oil containing 90 % of Eugenol and 5 % Eucalyptus oil containing 70 % of Cineol, sorbed on particulate sorptive substrate to obtain a controlled release system .<br>
It will be appreciated by the skilled artisan that the herbal ant repellent compositions of the present invention unexpectedly exhibit excellent repellent activities using one or more U.S. F.D.A. approved plant extracts and plant essential oils, in lieu of conventional repellents which are not safe for use in households and other sensitive areas.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention relates to the use of synergistic activity between or among the constituents of Turmeric powder extract, Neem powder extract, Clove oil and Eucalyptus oil containing 10% of Curcuminoid compound , 15% of liminoid compound, 90% of Eugenol and 70 % of Cineol. Without wishing to be bound by the following theories like plant extracts and plant essential oils attack a pest's nervous system or may act as Phase I and/or Phase II drug metabolizing enzyme inhibitors and kills the insect. Alternatively, the plant extracts and plant essential oils may act via an alternative mode of action externally with out mortality.<br>
For an example Turmeric powder extract containing cucuminoid which is an irritant to skin and mucous membrane, Neem powder extract containing liminoid which acts as anti-feedant and the plant essential oils namely Clove oil containing eugenol is an insect attractant, which helps in diverting the attention of the ants towards the repellent compounds and Eucalyptus oil containing cineol causes tissue irritation, which also produces temporary impairment of sensory organs of the insects. The net effect of the repellent action of the inventive composition disclosed herein is heretofore unknown and unexpectedly superior.<br>
In this invention the plant extracts and the plant essential oils were incorporated in particulate sorption substrate to obtain a controlled release system. The term sorb is used herein to mean absorb and/or adsorb.<br>
Controlled release systems, unlike the conventional formulations, facilitate a gradual and controlled discharge of the repellent, reducing the losses by evaporation and leaching and minimizing the wastage.<br>
Use of herbal ant repellent compositions of the present invention generally results in 100% repellency on contact on a shorted duration. The control is sustained for a longer period of time due to gradual and controlled discharge of the repellent.<br>
They are advantageously employed as ant repellent agents without limitation, in uses such as, applying a repellent effective amount, or non toxic amount of the particular repellent compositions with a sorption substrate of the invention to the corresponding habitat like households, agriculture, organic farming, professional pest control, pet bedding or any other area to be protected which is under the ants manifestation.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is directed to a ant repellent composition for controlling ants comprising a mixture of plant extracts and plant essential oils which include 35 % Turmeric powder extract containing   30 % of Curcuminoid, 50 % Neem powder extract containing 20 % of liminoid, 10 % Clove oil containing 30 % of Eugenol and 5 % Eucalyptus oil containing 10 % of Cineol, sorbed on particulate sorption substrate to obtain a controlled release system.<br>
Efficacy data shows that this embodiment is highly effective, i.e. exhibited repellent and no mortality against three types of ants .The present invention is specifically directed to a repellent for ants known as social insects. The repellents of the present invention show promise as useful products to be employed against the following types of ants.<br>
(1). Garden ants (Lasius sp)<br>
(2). Fire ants/ Red ants (Murmica sp)<br>
(3). Carpenter ants (Camponotus sp).<br>
(1). Garden ants (Lasius sp)<br>
One of the most common insects invading our homes; it is an active insect and nests outside in grass, walls and under paving. It enters buildings in search of food. The Garden Ant is relatively large at 3 to 5mm long, dark brown to black in colour.They are attracted to sweet foodstuffs, which they take back to the nest and feed to the larvae and queen. Although frequently inaccessible and difficult to destroy, ant nests must be eradicated if infestations are to be successfully controlled. The nests of the Garden Ant can be located by following their trails and by looking for small piles of fine earth<br>
(2). Fire ants/ Red ants (Murmica sp)<br>
They are small, coppery-brown in colour on the head and body .Come in a variety of sizes within one nest, ranging from 2mm to 6 mm. .Can be distinguished by their aggressive behaviour, particularly near the nest. Their nests can be found underneath other objects found on the ground, such as timber, logs, rocks, pavers, bricks etc. Fire ants inflict a fiery sting, which causes a small blister or pustule to form at the site of each sting after several hours. The blisters become itchy while healing and are prone to infection if broken. Fire Ants are serious pests, they inflict a painful sting and if not eradicated will seriously affect our lifestyle.<br><br>
(3). Carpenter ants (camponotus sp).<br>
Varies depending on species, from red to black or a combination. The two most common species are black, segmented and oval in shape. All species mainly attack wood that is wet. Carpenter ants build their nests outdoors in various wood sources, including tree stumps or firewood. Even though these ants first invade wet, decayed wood, they may soon begin building paths through dry, undamaged wood. They usually come into buildings through cracks around doors, windows or through holes for wires and through wet, damaged wood. . They pose a property threat once they gain entry to a structure.<br>
HERBAL ANT REPELLANT POWDER COMPOSITION<br>
1)	Turmeric powder extract :   35%<br>
2)	Neem powder extract      :   50%<br>
3)	Clove oil	:   10%<br>
4)	Eucalyptus oil	:  05%<br>
The herbal ant repellent composition consisting of Turmeric powder extract containing 30 % of Curcuminoid compound, Neem powder extract containing 20% of liminoid compound, Clove oil containing 30% of Eugenol and Eucalyptus oil containing 10 % of Cineol, sorbed on particulate sorption substrate to obtain a controlled release system .<br>
This composition is dependent upon many factors, including the targeted ants, the carrier employed, the method and conditions of the application. Proper consideration and resolution of these factors to provide the necessary dosage of the active compound at the place to be protected are within the skill of the art. Turmeric powder, Neem powder , Clove oil and Eucalyptus oil when applied alone to an ant manifested area ,the compound failed to produce a repellent activity against all the three types of ants. A mere admixture of the compounds also failed to produce a desirable and prolonged ant repellent activity on all the three types of ants.<br>
The present invention is directed to a repellent composition for controlling ants comprising a mixture of plant extract and plant essential oils which include 35%Turmeric powder extract, 50%Neem powder extract , 10%Clove oil and 5% Eucalyptus oil with a suitable carrier. Efficacy data shows that this embodiment is highly effective, i.e. exhibited fast repellent activity and no mortality of ants at this composition .<br>
A mixture of plant essential oils and plant extracts containing higher percentage i.e. &gt; 35%Turmeric powder extract , &gt;50%Neem powder extract , &gt;10%Clove oil and &gt;5% Eucalyptus oil, exhibited fast and complete mortality against the ants, which is not a desirable effect for a novel herbal ant repellent.<br>
The herbal ant repellent composition must consists Turmeric powder extract containing 10 % of Curcuminoid compound, Neem powder extract containing 15% of liminoid compound , Clove oil containing 90% of Eugenol and Eucalyptus oil containing 70 % of Cineol .The plant extracts and plant essential oils mentioned above should contain the specified percentage of active constituents for producing a prolonged and effective repellent effect on all the three types of ants. For example, in a preferred embodiment, the present invention is<br><br>
directed to a repellent composition for controlling ants comprising a mixture of plant essential oils and plant extracts which include 10 % of Curcuminoid compound, 15% of liminoid compound , 90% of Eugenol and 70 % of Cineol sorbed on particulate sorption substrate to obtain a controlled release system .<br>
Efficacy data shows that this embodiment is highly effective, i.e. exhibited fast and prolonged repellent activity against ants. A mixture of plant essential oils and plant extracts containing lower percentage of active constituents,  i.e. 
The present invention also relates to synergistic compositions comprising of Turmeric powder extract containing cucuminoid which is an irritant to skin and mucous membrane , Neem powder extract containing liminoid which acts as anti-feedant and the plant essential oils namely Clove oil containing eugenol is an insect attractant, which helps in diverting the attention of the ants towards the repellent compounds and Eucalyptus oil containing cineol causes tissue irritation and contact poison, which also produces temporary impairment of sensory organs of the insects. The net effect of the toxicity and action of the inventive composition disclosed herein is heretofore unknown and unexpectedly superior.<br>
Controlled release systems, unlike the conventional formulations, facilitate a gradual and controlled discharge of the repellent, reducing the losses by evaporation and leaching and thus minimizing the wastage. The "sorptive substrate" on which the repellent are sorbed exhibit the ability to substantially reduce the leachability of the repellent. The term "sorb" is used herein to mean absorb and/or adsorb.<br>
The inventive ant repellent compositions of the present invention may be employed in the form of mixtures with such solid or semisolid sorptive substrates. The substrate may be of natural or semi synthetic origin, with which the active compound is mixed or formulated to facilitate its application and control the discharge of the repellent.<br>
The term " sorptive substrate" as used herein means an inert material non toxic, on reactive, should protect the dispersed repellent powder from environment alteration by keeping the repellent powder intact on to the treated surface. Sorptive substate must have an ability to absorb, adsorb, or both, liquid repellents. Sorptive substate must also have an ability to release the repellent in a controlled manner on a applied surface.<br>
A typical sorptive solids of this invention comprise of Bentonite .An alternative sorptive solids substrate may be diatomous earth ,silica gel, starch, activated carbon, and paper waste when applying to a larger surface area.<br>
The solid ant repellent may be moistened with water .The moistened herbal ant repellent when applied alone or mixed with a substrates may be effectively used as ant repellent on all the three types of ants.<br>
In this invention Curcuminoid alcoholic extract is mixed with  particulate sorptive solids at the ratio 1:5 and dried at 40° C for lhour. Liminoids aqueous extract is mixed with  particulate sorption solids at the ratio 1:5 and dried at 40° C for lhour. Eucalyptus oil is mixed with particulate sorptive solids at the ratio 1:3 and dried at 20°C for 30 minute . Clove oil are mixed with particulate sorption solids at the ratio 1:3 and dried at 20°C for 30 minute.<br><br>
The "sorptive semisolid substrate" on which the repellent are sorbed exhibit the ability<br>
to substantially reduce the leachability of the repellent.<br>
A typical sorptive semi solids of this invention comprise of white soft paraffin for<br>
keeping the repellent powder intact to the applied area which could be applied with a<br>
spreader .An alternative sorptive semisolid substrate may be lanolin. The semisolid ant<br>
repellent when applied as such may be effectively used as ant repellent on all the three<br>
types of ants.<br>
In this invention Curcuminoid alcoholic extract is mixed with particulate sorptive semi<br>
solids substrate at the ratio 1:3 .Total liminoids aqueous extract is mixed with<br>
particulate sorptive semi solids substrate at the ratio 1:3 .<br>
Eucalyptus oil is mixed with particulate sorptive semi solids substrate at the ratio 1:2 .<br>
Clove oil is mixed with particulate sorptive semi solids substrate at the ratio 1:2 .<br>
The exact proportion and the type of sorption may be varied. The amount of sorptive solids may be varied over a substantial range depending upon the type and amount of repellent employed.<br>
The repellent activity and the toxicity of the herbal ant repellent were compared with that of the commercially available synthetic repellent namely Boric acid ant bait.<br>
The herbal ant repellent compositions is effective against different species of ants as mentioned above and it will be understood that the ants exemplified and evaluated in the working Examples herein is representative of such a wider variety.<br>
A herbal ant repellent spray of the same composition is under investigation.<br>
The following examples are presented to illustrate the invention and to facilitate a clearer understanding of the invention. It should be understood, however, that while the examples indicate preferred embodiments, they are not intended to limit the invention in any way. There are changes and modifications within the spirit and scope of the invention which will become apparent to those skilled in the art from this detailed description.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

EXAMPLE-1<br>
TOXICITY STUDY OF HERBAL ANT REPELLENT:<br>
To determine the level of toxicity of the herbal ant repellent on ants, a toxicity experiment had been conducted. All the three ants were placed in sealed plastic perforated containers that contain a sand substrate. In three sets of containers the sand was treated with herbal ant repellent Sample-I,Sample-II, Sample-Ill at levels of Ig/lOg. Ten ants of each selected category were added to each container. The fourth container was a control with no herbal repellent powder. The fifth container was a standard with 20% Boric acid powder and the sixth container was also standard, commercially available 18% boric acid granular bait Bushwhacker®. Daily counts of dead ants over a 24 hours period was made to determine mortality for each treatment. Based on these results a dose-response curve was generated from which reveals that six grams of herbal ant repellent powered Sample-II is an effective repellent with no toxic effect on all the tree types of ants under study.<br>
The number of ants found with in the area treated with herbal ant repellent and Boric acid powder after the first 15 minutes was compared using a dose response curve. Data for both the number of live and dead ants (expressed as percent of the total) during the 24 hours of the experiment and cumulative percentage mortality were analyzed. To test for effectiveness of herbal ant repellent after the passage of time, the above experiment was repeated twice with in 60 days as the above experiment. In our laboratory study it was also observed that all three types of ants in the area treated with herbal ant repellent powder were not killed with in 24 hours.<br>

EXAMPLE-m	REPELLENCY STUDY<br>
Repellencv activity of the herbal ant repellent;<br>
The ant bio-activity of Herbal ant repellent compositions for the control of ants containing 35 % Turmeric powder extract containing 10 %ofCurcuminoid, 50% Neem powder extract containing 15 % of liminoid, 10 % Clove oil containing 90 % of Eugenol and 5 % Eucalyptus oil containing 70 % of Cineol was tested using a standard commercially available product Boric acid granular bait ,Bushwhacker®.This method for screening compounds was faster than the method described in Example II. Plastic containers with two compartments were specially designed for the study. Each rectangular container (15x5&gt;
Ants were collected the day before beginning the experiment from colonies from the herbal garden.PSG College of Pharmacy, Cimbatore. For each container, 20 workers were placed in the nest area (Compartment A) in a small Petri dish (3.5 cm diameter) with the lid closed<br>
initially.<br>
For each type of ants, three replicates were established for each of the following treatments: a control (only sand), Standards(Bushwhacker® 18% boric acid granular bait ),Sample II(Herbal ant repellent powder of lg/lOOg of sand). The plastic containers were kept closed with lids in a thermostatic chamber at 27° C. for 24 hours.After the ants were acclimated, the lid on the Petri dish was removed. Ant behavior was observed during the first 15 min ; the number of ants that are normal, ataxic, moribund or dead was recorded. Number of ants in the Compartment A and Compartment B after 5, 10, and 15 min upto 6 hrs was noted.The ant<br><br>
distribution in each compartment, measured by counting the number of ants on the untreated<br>
half of the container, was examined each hour for up to 6 hr.<br>
When 70% of the ants (in three replicates) are observed on the untreated sand, the sample<br>
was considered to have activity as a repellent. Also, the herbal ant repellent Sample-II<br>
repelled all the three type of ants with in the 6 hr time frame.<br>
To test for effectiveness of herbal ant repellent after the passage of time, the above<br>
experiment was repeated twice 10 and 20 days later with sand that had been treated 10 days<br>
and 20 days prior to the experiments as the above experiment. For 10 and 20 days, the sand<br>
had been maintained in separate chambers ants were freshly collected from different<br>
colonies.<br>
Data for both the number of live and dead ants (expressed as percent of the total) during the 6 hrs of the experiment were analyzed with one -way ANOVA for repeated measures followed by Kolmogorov and Smirnov method since the samples followed Gaussian distributions, consideringthe factors "Duration" and "treatment". All data were analyzed using Statistica 5.5 (1999 edition).<br>
Summary of Percent Repellencv of Red ants :<br>

EXAMPLE -IV<br>
CONTROLLED RELEASE REPELLENCY STUDY OF THE HERBAL ANT<br>
REPELLENT WITH BENTONITE.<br>
Sorption capacity of the particulate sorptive solid substrate , permeability, and time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released, T(50), were calculated by the comparison of the preparations. T(50) values were higher for those composition containing bentonite when compared to diatomous earth and activated carbon. T(50) values range from 0.45 h - 48 .00 h for the repellent containing only bentonite as the sorbent. It appears that the release of constituents from the herbal ant repellent is controlled by a diffusion mechanism. The sorption capacity of the sorbents for the constituents of the herbal ant repellent was the most important factor modulating the release of the constituents.<br>
Repellency and Toxicity of Bentonite treated Herbal ant repellent sample-II:<br>
To demonstrate the effectiveness of the Sample-II of Herbal ant repellent in repelling ants<br>
from a different sorptive substrate, experiments was conducted as described in Example 3<br>
using Bentonite treated with Sample-II Herbal ant repellent.<br>
Bentonite was purchased from sd fine Chemicals, Mumbai.<br><br>
Summary of Percent Repellencv of ants :<br>
Red ants: Mean ± SE (Control) Bentonite treated Boric acid granulated bait was found to be<br>
100, Bentonite treated Sample-II Herbal ant repellent was found to be 97.77± 2.172.<br>
Carpenter ants: Mean ± SE Bentonite treated Control(Boric acid granulated bait)) was<br>
found to be 100, Bentonite treated Sample-II Herbal ant repellent found to be 100.<br>
Garden ants: Mean ± SE Bentonite treated Control (Boric acid granulated bait)) was found<br>
to be 100, Bentonite treated Sample-II Herbal ant repellent found to be 100.<br>
*Means are not significantly different at the 0.10 level determined by the Kolmogorov &amp;<br>
Smirnov test.The percent of living ants found in the sand area over 48 hrs treatment was not<br>
significantly different among the different treatments and over the hours.<br>
The ants in the control containers were almost always found in the sand area, whereas<br>
substantially lower numbers of ants were found in sand with Sample-II herbal ant repellent.<br>
Almost no ants were found in sand treated with the Boric acid granular bait.<br>
A significant difference was found in cumulative mortality over the 48 hrs . At any given<br>
time, mortality was highest in the containers with the Boric acid granular bait and the<br>
mortality was ranging from 16-20% The mortality was 0%in the area of the Sample-II<br>
herbal ant repellent treated containers.<br>
In our laboratory study and out door study 100% repellent activity was observed up to28 hrs .<br>
It was also observed that the all the types of ants with in the entrapped zone treated with<br>

EXAMPLE- 4<br>
CONTROLLED RELEASE REPELLENCY STUDY OF THE HERBAL ANT<br>
REPELLENT WITH WHITE SOFT PARAFFIN,<br>
Sorption capacity of the particulate sorptive semi solid substrate, permeability, and time taken for 50% of the active ingredient to be released, T(50), were calculated by the comparison of the preparations. T(50) values were higher for those composition containing white soft paraffin when compared to lanolin. T(50) values range from 0.30 h - 36 .00 h for the repellent containing only white soft paraffin as the sorbent. It appears that the release of constituents from the herbal ant repellent is controlled by a diffusion mechanism. Repellencv &amp; Toxicity of White petroleum jelly treated with Herbal ant repellent sample-II To demonstrate the effectiveness of the Herbal ant repellent in repelling ants from a different substrate, experiments was conducted as described in Example 1 using, instead of the sand, White petroleum jelly treated with various concentrations of Herbal ant repellent. This method was much useful for the out door and indoor study because the herbal powder mixture was kept intact in the applied area and the wind of circulated air did not remove the applied herbal ant repellent.White soft paraffin was obtained from sd fine Chemicals, Mumbai.<br>
Summary of Percent Repellencv of ants :<br>
Red ants:Mean ± SE White soft paraffin treated Boric acid granulated bait was found to bel00,White soft paraffin treated Sample-II Herbal ant repellent was found to be 100. Carpenter ants: Mean ± SE White soft paraffin treated Boric acid granulated bait) was found to be 100, White soft paraffin treated Sample-II Herbal ant repellent found to be 100. Garden ants; Mean ± SE White soft paraffin treated Boric acid granulated bait) was found to be 100, White soft paraffin treated Sample-II Herbal ant repellent found to be 100. In our laboratory study and out door study 100% repellent activity was observed up to36 hrs . It was also observed that the all the types of ants with in the entrapped zone treated with White soft paraffin treated Sample-II herbal ant repellent powder were not killed with in 36 hours.<br><br>
