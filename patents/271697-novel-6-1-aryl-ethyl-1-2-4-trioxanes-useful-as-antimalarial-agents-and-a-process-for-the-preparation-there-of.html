These trioxanes are new compounds and are useful as antimalarial agents. Some of these compounds have been tested against multi-drug resistant malaria in mice and have shown promising antimalarial activity. The invention, thus relates to pharmaceutical industry.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Malaria is still one of the world's most deadly disease that threatens nearly 40% of the world's population and infects approximately 300 to 500 million people annually world wide mainly in tropical and subtropical areas. It is estimated that there are between 1 million to 3 million deaths every year due to malaria. In Africa alone, more than 1 million children under the age of 5 die from malaria each year.<br>
Malaria is a parasite borne disease and human infection is caused by four distinct species of the protozoon Plasmodium, namely P. vivax, P. falciparum, P. ovale, P. malariae. Malaria is transmitted by bite of a vector the female Anopheles mosquito which is responsible for its global epidemics. Quite a number of natural products isolated from various plants and microorganisms have shown potent antimalarial activity, thus acting as lead for further drug development.<br><br>
Natural products as lead for malaria chemotherapy dates back to the early 18th century when bark of Cinchona tree was used in the treatment of fever by the natives of South America. It was in 1820 that quinine was isolated as active principle of the bark. Quinine is active against the trophozoites present in the erythrocytes but has no effect on exo-erythrocytic stages that develop in lever. Later on taking quinine as lead several synthetic analogues like chloroquine, mefloquin, primaquine etc, were developed as antimalarial drugs and are still being used.<br>
Unfortunately due to indiscriminate use of chloroquine and its analogues the parasite developed resistance towards these drugs. Indeed the re-emergence of the malaria as a world wide epidemic can be largely attributed due to rapid development of parasite resistance towards conventional drugs. Thus there is an urgent need to develop new drugs which are novel both in terms of mechanism of action and pharmacophore.<br>
In that regard discovery of artemisinin, a sesquiterpene lactone endoperoxide, isolated from Chinese traditional medicinal herb Artemisia annua and its semisynthetic derivatives like arteether and artemether have shown tremendous potential and are presently the drugs of choice for the treatment of multidrug resistant malaria. These drugs are effective against both chloroquine sensitive and chloroquine resistant strains of Plasmodium falciparum, [For reviews and background knowledge of artemisinin and its semisynthetic derivatives see: (a) Klayman, D. L Science 1985, 228, 1049. (b) Bhattacharya, A. K.; Sharma, R. P. Heterocycles 1999, 51, 1651. (c) Borstnik, K.; Paik, I.; Shapiro, T. A.; Posner, G. H. Int. J. Parasitol. 2002, 32, 1661.

The limited availability of artemisinin from the natural sources and taking into account of the fact, that it is actually the endoperoxide linkage in the form of 1,2,4- trioxane ring system which is responsible for its antimalarial activity, has led to the present efforts to develop new structurally simple trioxanes which are easily accessible relatively cheap and active against multidrug resistant strains. . Several structurally simple synthetic trioxanes have shown promising antimalarial activity [(a) Bhattacharya.A K.,Sharma,RP.; Hefrocyc/es.1999 57,1681.

This present invention relates to novel substituted 1, 2, 4-trioxanes useful as antimalarial agents having general formula 2. This invention also relates to a process for the preparation of these novel substituted 1, 2, 4-trioxanes. This invention particularly relates to a process for the preparation of 6-(1-aryl ethyl)-1,  2,  4-trioxanes,  as a  new series  of antimalarial  agents.   More<br>
particularly the present invention provides a process for the preparation of 1,2,4-trioxanes of general formula 2 wherein Ar represents the aryl groups like phenyl , pMe-phenyl, pCI-phenyl, pMeO- phenyl, pF-phenyl, biphenyl, 2-napthyl, p-Br-phenyl,1-napthyl, p-Cyclohexyl-phenyl, 2-Flurenyl and the like, whereas R1 and R2 represents the part of cyclic ring system like cyclohexane, cyclopentane and adamantane and the like. These trioxanes are new compounds and are useful as antimalarial agents. Some of these compounds have been tested against multi-drug resistant malaria in mice and have shown high order of antimalarial activity.<br>

These trioxanes of the general formula 2 are new chemical entities and they have not been prepared earlier.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide novel substituted 1, 2, 4-trioxanes of formula 2 and a process for the preparation of these novel substituted 1, 2, 4-trioxanes of general formula 2, a new series of antimalarial agents.<br>
Accordingly, the present process provides a process for the preparation of novel substituted 1, 2, 4-trioxanes of general formula 2 which comprises the reduction of the 6-(1-aryl vinyl)-1, 2, 4-trioxanes of formula 1 with diimide, generated in situ, by the reaction of H2O2 with N2H4.H20 or CO2 neutralized N2H4.H2O in a water miscible organic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran, ethyl alcohol, methyl alcohol CH3CN or a mixture of these solvents at a temperature range of 0 °C to room temperature to furnish trioxanes of formula 2 as a mixture of diastereomers, separation of the diastereomers by chromatography to give pure isomers of the formula 3 and 4 wherein Ar, R1 and R2 have the same meaning as above.<br>

laboratory and are known compounds. In the process trioxanes of the formula 1 are reduced with diimide.generated by the reaction of hydrogen peroxide and hydrazine hydrate in a water miscible organic solvent such as THF, ethanol, methanol, CH3CN or a mixture of these solvents at ambient temperature to furnish a mixture of diastereomers of the formula 2. Separation of the isomers by chromatography gave pure isomers of formula 3 and 4 where in Ar, R1 and R2 have the same meanings as stated above. ,H<br><br>
These trioxanes having general formula 3 and 4 are new chemical entities and have not been prepared earlier.<br>

ANTIMALARIAL ACTIVITY<br>
The antimalarial activity of the test compounds was evaluated against multidrug resistant strain of Plasmodium yoelii Nigeriensis in Swiss mice.<br>
General Procedure:-<br>
Random bred Swiss mice of either sex (20 ± 2 g) were inoculated intraperitoneally with 1x105 P. yoelii (MDR) parasites on day zero. The treatments with test compounds were administered to group of 5 mice each at different dose levels ranging between 12-96 mg/kg/day. The compounds were administered as solutions in oil via oral route for 4 consecutive days (day 0-3). p-Arteether and cc-Arteether were used as positive control.<br><br>
Blood smears from experimental mice were observed on day 4 and 7, day 10 and thereafter at regular interval till day 28 or death of the animal. The parasitaemia level on day 4 was compared with the vehicle control group and the percent suppression of parasitaemia in treated groups was calculated. The compounds which showed more than 90% suppression were identified for further screening.<br>
For determining the curative dose of a compound the treated mice were observed till day 28.The dose at which no parasitaemia develops during the observation period has been recorded as the curative dose. The results are shown in table given below:<br>
