				<td>Process for the treatment of lignocellulose materials, in<br>
particular wood, and a material obtained by this process<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the treatment of lignocellulose<br>
materials, in particular wood, and to a material obtained by this process. <br>
 It is targeted more particularly at a process for protecting wood which<br>
makes it possible to confer a hydrophobic nature on it, in order to enhance its<br>
durability and its dimensional stability.<br>
It is known that, in the natural state, wood or more specifically food fibers<br>
which are in contact with a wet atmosphere have a tendency to soak up water.<br>
This absorption of water is accompanied by swelling.<br>
Drying can be carried out to remove this water. However, although the<br>
drying stage makes it possible to remove the water from the wood, it does not in<br>
any way modify its natural hydrophilic nature, with the result that the piece of wood<br>
is again capable of reabsorbing the water removed during the drying when this<br>
piece is again in a wet environment.<br>
In order to reduce, indeed even eliminate, the hydrophilic nature of the<br>
wood and thus to confer on it long-term (conventionally about ten years)<br>
dimensional stability, treatment techniques have been sought.<br>
Among these, two main families may be noted, which families are<br>
differentiated into physical processes of heat treatment (generally at temperatures<br>
of greater than 150°C) and physicochemical treatment processes, generally at<br>
temperatures of less than 120°C.<br>
The present invention is concerned with physicochemical treatment<br>
processes.             <br>
These physicochemical treatments include processes, known in particular<br>
from several publication, is Arni et al ., (Atni, 1961)                        ; Matsuzaki et al., which make it<br>
possible to synthesize mixed esters from a trifluoroacetic medium. These<br>
processes are not viable industrially because of the use of toxic solvent and toxic<br>
catalyst.<br>
Additional studies carried out on wood sawdust have demonstrated that the<br>
esterification in the presence of a strong acid catalyst (adding more to the intrinsic<br>
acidity of the medium) makes it possible to confer a hydrophobic nature on this<br>
sawdust. These studies formed the subject of the following publication: Vaca-<br>
Garcia C. and Borredon M.E., 1999, Solvent-free fatty acylation of cellulose and<br>
lignocellulosic wastes. Part 2 : reactions with fatty acids, Bioresource Technology,<br>
70, 135-142.<br>
The major disadvantages [lacuna] this process in the presence of an acid<br>
catalyst are the loss in mass of the wood sawdust, this loss in mass resulting from<br>
decomposition of the biopolymers constituting the sawdust. A change in color of<br>
the sawdust after treatment may also be observed.<br>
A technique similar to the above cannot be applied to a piece of wood. This<br>
is because it has been found that hemicellulose molecules and cellulose are<br>
partially hydrolyzed, which results in a decrease in the molecular weight through<br>
the formation of oligomers and in a decline in the mechanical properties, and also<br>
in a deterioration in the appearance of the treated piece of wood.<br>
The present invention aims to overcome these disadvantages by providing<br>
a process which confers a hydrophobic nature on bulk wood while guaranteeing<br>
dimensional stability over time, without resulting in the creation of cracks,<br>
crackling, splits or a change in color.<br>
A subject matter of the present invention is thus a process for the chemical<br>
treatment of lignbcellulose materials, in particular of at least one piece of wood,<br>
which is characterized in that said materials are subjected to impregnation by a<br>
chemical agent comprising hydrocarbonaceous chains, this agent being chosen<br>
from mixed anhydrides, except for the mixed anhydride of acetic/benzoic acid, said<br>
agent being suitable for providing covalent grafting of a plurality of<br>
hydrocarbonaceous chains to said materials.<br>
By virtue of these arrangements, the protection at the surface and at the<br>
core of the lignocellulose material, in particular wood, is improved by modification<br>
of its hydroxyl functional groups.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, it is optionally possible to have<br>
recourse, in addition, to one and/or other of the following arrangements:<br>
the grafting is carried out by a process of esterification of said<br>
lignocellulose materials using a chemical agent chosen from organic<br>
anhydrides,<br>
the treatment is carried out at a temperature between ambient<br>
temperature and 150°C and preferably between 100 and 140°C,<br>
the organic anhydride is a mixed anhydride,<br>
the mixed anhydride comprises a first hydrocarbonaceuous chain R<br>
and a second hydrocarbonaceous chain R1,<br>
R represents a C2 to C4 carboxylic acid and R1 is a C6 to C24 fatty<br>
acid, these acids being saturated or unsaturated,<br>
R1 represents a C2 to C4 carboxylic acid and R is a C6 to C24 fatty<br>
acid, these acids being saturated or unsaturated,<br>
the mixed anhydride is the mixed anhydride of acetic/octanoic acids,<br>
the impregnation is carried out in the presence of a basic catalyst,<br>
the impregnation is carried out in the presence of a neutral catalyst,<br>
the impregnation is carried out in the presence of a weak acid<br>
catalyst,<br>
the impregnation is carried out in the absence of catalyst,<br>
the impregnation of the lignocellulose materials is carried out by a<br>
dipping process,<br>
the impregnation of the lignocellulose materials is carried out by a<br>
spraying process,<br>
the impregnation of the lignocellulose materials is carried out in an<br>
autoclave,<br>
the treatment process is carried out on a piece of wood, the species<br>
of which is chosen from, in particular, oak, pine, fir, curupixa or<br>
eucalyptus.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention, the latter is also targeted at a<br>
piece of wood treated according to the process targeted above, which is<br>
characterized in that the lignocellulose fibers are homogeneous and exhibit a<br>
smooth appearance.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention, it is optionally possible to have<br>
recourse, in addition, to one and/or other of the following arrangements:<br>
the degree of absorption of the treated lignocellulose fibers is<br>
essentially in the region of 3.5%,<br>
the  degree  of swelling   of the  treated   lignocellulose  fibers  is<br>
substantially in the region of 3.5%.<br>
Other characteristics and advantages of the invention will become apparent<br>
in the course of the following description of one of its embodiments, given as non-<br>
limiting example, with regard to the appended drawings.<br>
In the drawings:<br>
-  Figure 1 is a view taken with a scanning microscope (SEM) of a sample of<br>
untreated wood; it may stand as reference.<br>
- Figure 2 is a view taken with a scanning microscope (SEM) of a sample of wood<br>
which has been subjected to the process which is a subject matter of the<br>
invention, in the presence of a strong acid catalyst.<br>
- Figure 3 is another view taken with a scanning microscope (SEM) of a sample of<br>
wood which has been subjected to the process which is a subject matter of the<br>
invention, in the presence of a strong acid catalyst.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the process which is a subject<br>
matter of the invention, this process consists in impregnating lignocellulose<br>
materials, such as, in particular, at least one piece of wood, with a chemical agent<br>
comprising hydrocarbonaceuous chains, said agent being suitable for providing<br>
covalent grafting of a plurality of hydrocarbonaceous chains to said materials.<br>
The term "hydrocarbonaceous chain" is understood to mean any<br>
heteroaliphatic, heteroaromatic, aliphatic or aromatic chain.<br>
This impregnation is carried out a temperature between ambient<br>
temperature and 150°C and preferably between 100 and 140°C.<br>
This chemical agent is chosen from organic anhydrides and preferably from<br>
mixed anhydrides.<br>
A stage of preparation of the mixed anhydride is carried out before the<br>
stage of impregnation of said lignocellulose materials (for example, at least one<br>
piece of wood) with the chemical agent.<br>
According to a first method: from an acid chloride and a carboxylic ester<br>
according to the following reaction:<br>
According to an alternative form of the first method, which consists in<br>
switching the positions of R and of R1:<br>
According to a second method: from an acid chloride and a carboxylic<br>
acid salt according to the following reaction:<br>
According to a third method: from a linear carboxylic acid anhydride and<br>
a fatty acid according to the following reaction:<br>
The R and R1 radicals are aliphatic chains of different lengths. By way of<br>
non-limiting example, it is assumed that R is shorter than R1.<br>
R represents, by an example, a C2 to C4 carboxylic acid (acetic acid,<br>
propionic acid or butyric acid, while R1 is a C6 to C24 fatty acid, these acids<br>
being saturated or unsaturated (hexylic acid, octanoic acid or oleic acid, for<br>
example).<br>
The mixed anhydrides can be used pure or as a mixture and, in this<br>
case, originate result from a mixture of different carboxylic acids, from which the<br>
synthesis of the desired mixed anhydride is carried out.<br>
The mixed anhydride obtained by at least one of the abovementioned<br>
methods is then used to impregnate a piece of wood so as to graft the mixed<br>
anhydride (for example, acetic/octanoic anhydride) to said piece of wood, this<br>
grafting comprising an esterification of the wood according to the following<br>
reaction:<br>
or vice versa with regard to the role between R and R1<br>
Other esterification methods can also be used according to the reactions<br>
envisaged below:<br>
Starting from an acid chloride, this reaction is fast but the evolution of HCI<br>
constitutes a major disadvantage.<br>
By way of example, the acid chloride is chosen from octanoyl chloride or<br>
acetoyl chloride.<br>
Starting from a ketene, the reactants are expensive, however, which limits<br>
the industrial advantage.<br>
By way of example, this reaction can be combined with, for example,<br>
octanoyl chloride.<br>
Starting from carboxylic acids, this reaction nevertheless exhibits a low<br>
reactivity and requires the use of coreactants: Pyridine, DCC, TsCI or TFAA (DCC:<br>
N,N-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide; TsCI: p-toluenesulfonyl chloride; TFAA:<br>
trifluoroacetic anhydride).<br>
By way of examples, the carboxylic acids used are chosen from acetic acid<br>
or octanoic acid.<br>
Starting from carboxylic acid esters (for example, methyl octanoate or<br>
methyl acetate), it may be observed, however, that, if R is CH3, evolution of (toxic)<br>
methanol occurs.<br>
The wood mixed esters can be obtained either<br>
•     in a single stage, with a mixture of the reactants chosen from those<br>
presented above,<br>
•     or in 2 stages,<br>
o either by using the same type of reaction twice,<br>
o or with two reactions from two different families.<br>
In addition, according to one characteristic of the invention, these<br>
esterification reactions can take place in the absence of catalyst or in the presence<br>
of a basic or neutral catalyst (such as, for example, calcium carbonate, sodium<br>
carbonate, potassium carbonate, fatty acid salt, and the like) or with a weak acid<br>
catalyst or with a strong acid catalyst, the harmful effects of which on the wood are<br>
minimized by the use of very dilute concentrations.<br>
An implementational example of the process according to the invention will<br>
be given below:<br>
Example 1: One mole of acetic anhydride was added to one mole of<br>
octanoic acid. The mixture was heated with stirring at 140°C for 30 minutes. A<br>
piece of wood with dimensions of 10 * 10*10 cm was then immersed in the<br>
reaction mixture and the combined contents were heated at 140°C for 1 hour. The<br>
piece of wood was then drained of superficial water and dried in a fan oven.<br>
Example 2: One mole of acetic anhydride was added to one mole of<br>
octanoic acid. The mixture was stirred at ambient temperature for 60 minutes. A<br>
piece of wood with dimensions of 10*10*10 cm was then immersed in the<br>
reaction mixture for 5 minutes and then drained of superficial water. The piece of<br>
wood was placed in an oven at 120°C for 1 hour.<br>
A major advantage of the present invention consists in using a non-toxic<br>
mixed anhydride of vegetable origin rather than compounds of petrochemical<br>
origin.<br>
This specific choice favors the industrial implementation of the invention, as<br>
it simplifies treatments aimed at protecting the environment.<br>
Whatever the treatment process used, it is advisable to be able to find a<br>
posteriori the signature of this treatment on the lignocellulose material (in our<br>
specific case, a piece of wood).<br>
Various methods are envisaged which make it possible to characterize the<br>
treatment which the lignocellulose material has been subjected to, namely the<br>
determination of the presence of different hydrocarbonaceous chains bonded via<br>
ester functional groups and the presence or absence of a catalyst (and its type).<br>
A method which makes it possible to determine the presence of<br>
hydrocarbonaceous chains consists in treating a sample originating from the<br>
piece of wood with an NaOH solution in order to hydrolyze the ester functional<br>
groups and to convert the hydrocarbonaceous chains to carboxylic acid. The<br>
latter are subsequently identified by conventional chromatographic methods,<br>
such as HPLC, GC, and the like.<br>
An example of these methods consist, in starting from a piece of wood or<br>
from a lignocellulose material, the hydroxyl functional groups of which have<br>
been acylated by at least two different hydrocarbonaceous agents, to give rise<br>
to mixtures of esters, for example acetates and octanoates of lignocellulose<br>
material.<br>
This mixture of esters can be characterized in the following way: A<br>
sample of wood or lignocellulose material treated by the claimed process is<br>
ground to a particle size of at least 80 mesh and is then introduced into a flask<br>
containing an aqueous ethanol solution (70%). After stirring for at least one<br>
hour, a sufficient amount of an aqueous NaOH solution (0.5M) is added and<br>
stirring is continued for 72 h in order to achieve complete saponification of the<br>
ester functional groups. After filtering and separating the solid residue, the liquid<br>
is acidified to pH 3 with an aqueous HCI solution (1M) in order to convert the<br>
hydrocarbonaceous compounds to the corresponding carboxylic acids. The<br>
liquid can subsequently be analyzed by gas chromatography (GC) or by high<br>
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) in order to separate and identify the<br>
various carboxylic acids corresponding to the ester functional groups present in<br>
the wood or lignocellulose material treated.<br>
Methods which make it possible to identify the type of catalyst will be<br>
given below.<br>
Thus, a first method consists in determining the amount of extractables.<br>
This method makes it possible to observe the influence of the various<br>
treatments on the extractables of the wood (initially present or resulting from the<br>
decomposition of the wood). The treated and then micronized wood is subjected<br>
to extractions with several solvents of different polarities: Water, ethanol,<br>
acetone, and cyclohexane. The extractions are carried out using a Soxhlet<br>
device.<br>
The amounts of extractables of the treated wood samples, after<br>
extraction in a Soxhlet with various solvents, are collated in the table below.<br>
As may be seen, whatever the extraction solvent. These results confirm<br>
the visual impressions: Treatment by strong acid catalysis (0.3 mol% H2SO4),<br>
which causes the most decomposition and which results in the formation of the<br>
largest amount of extractable compounds at the end of the reaction. For large<br>
amounts of strong acid (0.3 mol%), the piece of wood darkens and has a<br>
tendency to disintegrate and to exhibit defects in appearance.<br>
On the microscopic scale, the cell wall of the fibers is damaged because<br>
of the acid catalysis.<br>
Thus, in comparison with figure 1 and from a qualitative viewpoint, it may<br>
be observed, with regard to figure 2, that the surface of the wood appears to<br>
have been smoothed by the treatment, this surface of the wood is<br>
homogeneous. The fibers of the wood (lignocellulose fibers) visible under the<br>
microscope appear to be intact compared to those in figure 1. The product<br>
appears, on the one hand, to have a kind of action of stripping the surface, but<br>
also makes possible homogenization of the surface by virtue of the grafting.<br>
This is because the grafted chains are capable of protecting the fibers, making it<br>
impossible to see them under the microscope.<br>
Likewise with regard to figure 3, the lignocellulose fibers appear to be<br>
exposed. The presence of product is much less marked than above (figure 2);<br>
this is logical as the photograph exhibits the interior of a block treated by the<br>
process of invention. The shredding is due either to the treatment or, probably,<br>
to the tearing of the fibers during cutting.<br>
From a quantitative viewpoint, a table is given below in which the values<br>
of absorption and of swelling for treated and untreated lignocellulose fibers are<br>
stated.<br>
A second method comprises an analysis of the constituents of the wood.<br>
Depending on the type of medium with which the wood is treated, the biopolymers<br>
of the wood do not all undergo the same decompositions. The composition of the<br>
treated wood may therefore vary according to the treatment. This method is<br>
referred to a the "ADF-NDF" method and it makes it possible to find out the<br>
proportions of cellulose C, of hemicelluloses H, of lignins L, and of inorganic<br>
matter IM.<br>
The data relating to the analysis of the composition of oak wood treated<br>
with the acetic/octanoic mixed anhydride with various types of catalysts are<br>
collated in the table below. The esterified samples were saponified according to<br>
the protocol for the analysis of wood mixed esters and were then washed by<br>
extraction with water using a Soxhlet device before being analyzed by the<br>
ADF-NDF technique. This technique is described in the reference (Acid Detergent<br>
Fiber, Neutral Detergent Fiber), Van Soest P.J. and Wine R.H., Determination of<br>
lignin and cellulose in acid-detergent fiber with permanganate. J. Ass. Offic. Anal.<br>
Chem., 51(4), 780-785 (1968).<br>
This analysis therefore makes it possible to distinguish a treatment with strong<br>
acid catalysis from the claimed treatments. This is because a larger and significant<br>
decrease in the amount of lignin and hemicelluloses is observed. Furthermore, the<br>
amount of extractables using the Soxhlet with water is the greatest.<br>
