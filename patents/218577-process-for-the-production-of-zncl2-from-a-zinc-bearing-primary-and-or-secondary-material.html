				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ZnCl2 FROM<br>
A ZINC BEARING PRIMARY AND/OR SECONDARY MATERIAL<br>
The present invention relates to a process for the production of zncl2 from<br>
a zinc bearing primary and/or secondary material and recovery of metals,<br>
especially zinc, from zinc bearing primary and/or secondary material. More<br>
specifically, the process of the present invention relates to the conversion of the<br>
metals in the l2ed material to metal chlorides and subsequent recovery of the<br>
zinc and optionally other metals.<br>
Most present processes for zinc production require oxidic raw<br>
materials. Nowadays, the most widely used process for zinc production<br>
is the sulphate process which represented 80% of total world<br>
production in 1997. It consists of the steps of roasting, leaching,<br>
liquor purification, electro-deposition, melting and casting. The<br>
most abundant natural raw material is zinc blende (ZnS), which must<br>
be roasted to ZnO as a first step. Of course, zinc oxide recycled<br>
from other industries can be used directly without roasting.<br>
The zinc electro-deposition is readily disturbed by extremely<br>
low levels of impurities in the electrolyte; the electrolyte liquor<br>
oust therefore be rigorously purified. This means that the<br>
concentration of all the elements other than zinc present in the l2ed<br>
has to be lowered drastically. For instance, the following limits are<br>
generally applied: l2 less than 5 ppm, Cu less than 0.1 ppm, Co less<br>
than 0.2 ppm, As less than 0.01 ppm, Ge less than 0.005 ppm etc. In<br>
consequence, the liquor purification step is rather complicated,<br>
involves a lot of difl2rent process steps and produces many difl2rent<br>
types of residues. Some of these residues necessitate further<br>
treatment to valorise the metals they contain. Other residues, among<br>
which large quantities of iron residue in the form of jarosite or<br>
goethite, must be disposed of in ponds, a practice which is under<br>
strong environmental pressure.<br>
Another difficulty of the sulphate process is that in order to<br>
achieve maximum recovery yields of zinc and also of other valuable<br>
impurities such as copper and cadmium, the leaching step is long and<br>
complicated, involving successive leaching operations at difl2rent<br>
acidities and temperatures.<br>
At the turn of the 20th century, Swinburne and Ashcroft proposed<br>
a completely difl2rent process for the production of zinc from<br>
sulfidic material in GB 14,278. This process is known as "chlorine<br>
smelting with fused chloride electrolysis". The method, consists in:<br>
converting all the metals present in a sulphide ore or concentrate<br>
l2ed into chlorides by reacting them with chlorine, and producing<br>
elemental sulphur at the same time;<br>
eliminating all the chlorides other than ZnCl2 by cementation with<br>
zinc metal; and<br>
electrolysing the fused zinc chloride to produce pure zinc and to<br>
recover the chlorine.<br>
Basically, in a first embodiment of the Ashcroft process called<br>
the "wet" embodiment, the chlorination reaction produces a chloride<br>
melt, containing insoluble oxides and gangues which were not readily<br>
converted to chlorides during the chlorination step. The whole melt<br>
is then dissolved in water, in order to separate the insoluble<br>
fraction, and subjected to purification. Iron and manganese are<br>
eliminated by the addition of zinc oxide and chlorine in the aqueous<br>
solution. The other metals are cemented by the addition of Pb and/or<br>
Zn metal. The purified zinc chloride solution is then boiled down<br>
again, and a preliminary electrolysis with a rough, consumable carbon<br>
anode efl2cts the final de-hydration of the zinc chloride before the<br>
actual zinc electrolysis.<br>
A variation of the process consists in the cementation of all<br>
the metals with zinc, without prior dissolution in water, and is<br>
called the "dry" embodiment. The zinc chloride is also subjected to a<br>
pre-electrolysis to ensure a sufficiently low oxide and water<br>
content. Then the actual electrolysis is carried out as above to<br>
produce molten zinc.<br>
The Ashcroft process, although very interesting, sufl2rs from<br>
several drawbacks. First, a lot of zinc metal is consumed in the<br>
cementation step, whether in the dry or the wet embodiment. Also, as<br>
the molten zinc chloride must be very pure for the electrolysis, the<br>
totality of the other elements must be removed from the flow, which<br>
implies a non-selective output which is difficult to valorise.<br>
Finally, particularly in the wet embodiment, a lot of energy is<br>
required to evaporate the water, and a pre-electrolysis with<br>
consumable anodes is needed to completely dry the melt. These<br>
operations are not economically interesting.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to overcome the<br>
disadvantages of the above mentioned methods. Our main goal is to<br>
have a better control of residues. This means that clear-cut, single<br>
step separations of the difl2rent elements present in the l2ed are<br>
required, in order to avoid as much as possible the production of<br>
residues that must be disposed of, and to favour the production of<br>
well marketable exits for the separated by-products. Another aim is<br>
to allow a high flexibility in the l2ed, i.e. to be able to use,<br>
separately or together, various zinc-bearing primary or secondary<br>
materials. Another advantage over the sulphate process is that the<br>
electrolysis produces molten zinc which can be directly cast, thus<br>
avoiding the melting of zinc cathodes. Yet another advantage is the<br>
overall lower energy consumption of the process. Beside an economical<br>
interest, this is also important from the environmental point of<br>
view, since less energy means less production of greenhouse efl2ct<br>
generating gases.<br>
According to the present invention, a process is provided for<br>
the separation and recovery of metals, especially zinc, from zinc<br>
bearing primary and/or secondary material.<br>
The process for the production of ZnCl2 from a Zn bearing<br>
primary and/or secondary material comprises the steps of reacting the<br>
Zn bearing material with a chlorinating agent such as Cl3 to convert<br>
metals into chlorides and vaporising the volatile components of the<br>
reaction product at a temperature between the melting point of said<br>
reaction product and the boiling point of ZnCl2, thereby recovering a<br>
Zn rich chlorinated melt, and thereafter distilling ZnCl3 from this Zn<br>
rich chlorinated melt, thereby recovering purified ZnCl2 and a Zn-<br>
depleted chlorinated melt.<br>
To this process, a further step of converting metal impurities<br>
which are present in the melt into insoluble oxides can be added.<br>
This conversion is accomplished by adding a metal oxide such as ZnO<br>
to the melt, after having recovered the Zn rich chlorinated melt and<br>
before distilling ZnCl2. During the conversion, an oxidising agent<br>
such as Cl2 can be added to the melt. The insoluble oxides obtained<br>
after conversion can be separated from the melt after the step of<br>
distilling ZnCl2.<br>
During the step of reacting the Zn bearing material with a<br>
chlorinating agent, the addition of this chlorinating agent can be<br>
controlled bo as to convert substantially all the l2 present in the<br>
Zn bearing material into l2Cla. A further step is then added to the<br>
process including the conversion step as described before, whereby<br>
after having recovered the Zn rich chlorinated melt and before<br>
converting, l2 is volatilised as l2(III) chloride by adding an<br>
oxidising chlorinating agent such as Cl3 to the melt at a temperature<br>
between 400 and 730 °C. The l2(III) chloride obtained in this process<br>
step can be purified, e.g. by rectification using a liquid reflux<br>
carrier. Purified ZnCl2 from the step of distilling ZnCl2 can be l2d<br>
as a liquid reflux carrier in the step of rectifying l2(III)<br>
chloride.<br>
The step of distilling ZnCl2 in the processes described before<br>
can comprise the steps of:<br>
volatilising ZnCl3 and other less volatile metal<br>
chlorides, thereby obtaining the Zn-depleted chlorinated melt and a<br>
Zn-rich gaseous phase; and<br>
rectifying the ZnCl2-rich gaseous phase, thereby obtaining<br>
purified ZnCl3 and metal chlorides less volatile than ZnCl3.<br>
Either one or both of purified ZnCl2 and metal chlorides less<br>
volatile than ZnCl2 from the step of rectifying the ZnCl2-rich gaseous<br>
phase, can be l2d as a liquid reflux carrier in the step of<br>
rectifying l2(III) chloride.<br>
To any of the processes described before, the step of<br>
subjecting the purified ZnCl2 to dry electrolysis can be added for the<br>
production of metallic Zn and Cl3. Prel2rably, Cl2 is then recycled as<br>
chlorinating agent from the dry electrolysis to the step of reacting<br>
the Zn bearing material with a chlorinating agent. Cl2 recycled from<br>
the dry electrolysis can also be used as an oxidising agent in the<br>
conversion of the metal impurities into insoluble oxides as mentioned<br>
above. Cl2 from the step of dry electrolysis can furthermore be<br>
recycled as an oxidising chlorinating agent to the step of<br>
volatilising l2 as l2(III) chloride as mentioned before.<br>
Prel2rably, residual metal values present in the Zn-depleted<br>
chlorinated melt are separated and a metal-depleted chlorinated melt<br>
is obtained, which can be recycled for use as a solvent in the step<br>
of reacting the Zn bearing material with a chlorinated agent in the<br>
first embodiment of the invention.<br>
Figure 1 provides an overview of the flowsheet of the first<br>
embodiment of the process comprising the steps of reacting Zn-bearing<br>

oxides (102), distilling ZnCl2 (101), electrolysing ZnCl2 (105) and<br>
separating oxides and metal values (106).<br>
Figure 4 provides an overview of the distillation of the zinc<br>
chloride, comprising the steps of volatilising a ZnCl2-rich phase<br>
(101") and rectifying the ZnCl2-rich phase (101").<br>
The process of the present invention converts the metals in a<br>
zinc bearing primary and/or secondary material to chlorides. As<br>
chlorides, they can be recovered in subsequent processing steps. In<br>
particular, zinc chloride is separated from the other chlorides by<br>
volatilisation, purified by rectification (fractional distillation),<br>
and optionally subjected to dry electrolysis, in order to recover<br>
metallic zinc of a special high grade quality, with a purity of 99.95<br>
wt% or better.<br>
The types of materials that can be l2d to the process of the<br>
present invention are e.g. those in which the metals are found in<br>
sulphidic, oxidic, carbonatic, l2rritic or silicaceous states.<br>
The first embodiment of the process is illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
The l2ed (1) to the process, typically in the form of a flowing<br>
powder, is contacted (100) with a chlorinating agent (2) such as Cl2,<br>
S2Cl2 or HCl. O2 can be added to facilitate the reaction, in<br>
particular when HCl is used to chlorinate sulphidic materials. While<br>
the contact between the l2ed and the chlorinating agent can be<br>
performed at low temperature, it is prel2rably performed at a<br>
temperature above 400 °C, the l2ed being in suspension in a recycled<br>
molten salt solvent, as will be explained below. By contacting the<br>
l2ed and the chlorinating agent, the metal salts present in the l2ed<br>
are substantially converted into chlorides, leaving unreacted only<br>
the gangues and possibly some non-reactive oxides. The metal<br>
chlorides that are formed can include, depending on the nature of the<br>
l2ed the chlorides of: Zn, l2, Cu, Pb, Ca, Ag, Ma, Mg, Na, K, Ba, Co,<br>
Ni, Cd, Ga, In, Sn.<br>
If the first step was performed at low temperature, the<br>
reaction products are then heated to above their melting point. A<br>
mixture of molten salts is thus obtained. The energy to provide is<br>
generally low because the chlorination reaction is exothermic.<br>
The most volatile reaction products are then vaporised,<br>
prel2rably at a temperature between 500 and 730 °C, or more<br>
prel2rably between 550 and 650 °C, and eliminated as reaction vapours<br>
of the chlorination step (19). These volatile components include the<br>
chlorides of metals such as Ta, Hg, Ga, In, Ge, Sn, As and Sb. If the<br>
l2ed contains sulphides, in the absence of oxygen, elemental sulphur<br>
is formed and eliminated with the reaction vapours (19). If any<br>
oxygen is present, as a gas or in oxides, SO2 is formed, and is also<br>
evacuated with the reaction vapours (19). If the chlorination<br>
reaction is carried out at a sufficiently high temperature, the<br>
vaporisation of sulphur and other volatile compounds will already<br>
take place during the chlorination itself.<br>
The resulting Zn-rich chlorinated melt (3) is then heated,<br>
prel2rably up to its boiling point, in order to vaporise the ZnCl2 so<br>
as to separate it (101) from the other chlorides, e.g. by fractional<br>
distillation. Two fractions are thus produced: purified ZnCl2 (4) and<br>
a Zn-depleted melt (5) . It is neither necessary nor desirable to<br>
eliminate all of the ZnCl2 from the Zn-rich chlorinated melt,<br>
particularly if the depleted melt is to be recycled as a solvent for<br>
the chlorination reaction, as ZnCl2 helps to keep the melting point of<br>
the melt low, typically below 400 °C.<br>
The purified, liquid ZnCl2 can then be l2d in an electrolysis<br>
cell (105). This cell can be monopolar or bipolar, with electrodes<br>
consisting e.g. of graphite. Since molten ZnCl2 has a poor electrical<br>
conductivity, the melt in the cell should prel2rably contain<br>
chlorides of metals having a redox potential more negative than Zn2+,<br>
such as Na+, K+ or Li*, or a mixture of them. A typical bath<br>
composition consists of 40 mole % ZnCl2, 30 mole % KC1 and 30 mole %<br>
NaCl. The electrolysis is performed at a temperature higher than the<br>
melting point of the salt mixture used, and prel2rably above the<br>
melting point of Zn (420 °C), in order to produce liquid Zn (15) that<br>
can be directly cast upon tapping. The temperature is prel2rably kept<br>
below 600 °C to avoid excessive fuming of the ZnCl2.<br>
The cathode reaction is:<br>
Zna+ + 2e~ = Zn°;<br>
the anode reaction is<br>
2C1" = Cl2 + 2e-.<br>
Chlorine gas (16) evolving at the anode can be recycled as a<br>
chlorinating agent (2) to the first step of the process (100).<br>
Details about the electrolysis step can be found in e.g.<br>
"Electrowinning Zinc from Zinc Chloride in Monopolar and Bipolar<br>
Fused-Salt Cells", Report of investigation 8524, 1981 - Bureau of<br>
Mines; S.D. Hill et al..<br>
The Zn-depleted melt (5) can further be processed in a<br>
separation step (106). In a first step, the insoluble oxides or<br>
gangues which were not readily converted to chlorides during the<br>
chlorination step (100) can be separated by settling (8).<br>
Then the metal values (17) can be separated, e.g. by<br>
cementation with lead or zinc. These metal values, according to the<br>
nature of the l2ed, can for instance contain Cu, Ag and other<br>
precious metals such as Au or Pt-group metals.<br>
The resulting metal-depleted melt (18) can be recycled to the<br>
step of chlorination (100), to serve as Bolvent for the reaction. The<br>
l2ed is dispersed as a suspension in this solvent and the<br>
chlorinating agent is bubbled through the bath.<br>
This first embodiment of the invention is selected when the<br>
amount of l2 in the l2ed is very low. Indeed, when l2 is present, it<br>
will be chlorinated: the l2(III) in the l2ed becomes l2(III)<br>
chloride, and the l2{II) becomes FeCl2 l2(III) chloride, itself being<br>
a chlorinating agent, can react with the l2ed, and form l2Cl2. As<br>
there is no other significant purge of iron in this embodiment, an<br>
excess of the chlorinating agent has to be added to form l2(III)<br>
chloride. This l2(III) chloride is relatively volatile, and will be<br>
partially eliminated with the other volatile components in the<br>
reaction vapours (19). However, some iron chloride will be passed to<br>
the distillation step (101) and will then be vaporised together with<br>
the ZnCl2, thereby contaminating the purified ZnCl2 (4). If the amount<br>
of l2 in the l2ed is sufficiently low, this might be acceptable. If<br>
not, then the second embodiment of the process provides a solution,<br>
as set out next.<br>
The second embodiment of the process is illustrated in Figure<br>
2. There, the l2ed (1) is contacted with a chlorinating agent (2) in<br>
the chlorination step (100), as explained above, and the operation is<br>
conducted until a Zn-rich chlorinated melt (3) is obtained. It is<br>
prel2rable that during said chlorination step (100) the addition of<br>
the chlorinating agent (2) is controlled in such a way that<br>
substantially no l2(III) chloride is formed. This can be done by<br>
stopping the addition of the chlorinating agent as soon as brown<br>
fumes appear. The needed amount of chlorinating agent can also be<br>
calculated, based on the stoechiometry of the reaction and the amount<br>
of zinc-bearing material to be chlorinated.<br>
Then, in a conversion step (102), a metal oxide-bearing<br>
compound (6) such as PbO, CaO, CaCO3, or prel2rably ZnO, is added to<br>
the melt. The added oxide can precipitate substantially all the<br>
oxides of l2(III), Mg and Ni (if present in the l2ed), and partially<br>
the oxides of l2(II), Mn(II) and Co(II). Subsequently, or prel2rably<br>
at the same time, a small amount of an oxidising agent (7) such as<br>
chlorine gas is added to the melt, whereby l2(II), Mn and Co will be<br>
oxidised to a state enabling the precipitation of a major part of<br>
their oxides. However, adding too much oxidising agent may cause the<br>
oxides to re-dissolve.<br>
After this conversion, the resulting melt (3*) is heated,<br>
prel2rably up to its boiling point, in order to vaporise the ZnCl2 so<br>
as to separate it (101) from the other chlorides, e.g. by fractional<br>
distillation. Two fractions, purified ZnCl2 (4) and a Zn-depleted melt<br>
(5), are obtained as set out in the first embodiment, The purified<br>
ZnCl2 (4) can then be l2d in an electrolysis cell (105), where it is<br>
processed as explained above.<br>
At the anode, chlorine gas is evolved (16). This gas can be<br>
recycled as a chlorinating agent (2) to the first step of the process<br>
(100), but also as an oxidising agent (7) to the conversion step<br>
(102).<br>
The Zn-depleted melt (5) can then further be processed in a<br>
separation step (106). In a first phase, oxides of l2, Mg, Mn, Ni and<br>
Co formed in the conversion step (102) are separated e.g. by settling<br>
(8), together with the insoluble gangues which were not converted to<br>
chlorides during the chlorination step (100).<br>
Then the metal values (17) can be separated. These metal<br>
values, according to the nature of the l2ed, can for instance contain<br>
Cu, Ag and other precious metals such as Au or Pt-group metals. The<br>
resulting metal-depleted melt (18) can be recycled to the step of<br>
chlorination (100), as explained above.<br>
In this embodiment, some or all of the l2 present in the melt<br>
after the chlorination (100) is blocked as an oxide during the<br>
conversion (102), and does not contaminate the purified ZnCl3 (4) .<br>
However, this method is practical only if the amount of l2 in the<br>
flow (3) from the chlorination step (100) is low, in particular lower<br>
than 2 wt %. Indeed, if it is too high, some iron will still be<br>
present in the flow after the conversion step (102), even if an<br>
excess of oxide is added, and it may contaminate the purified ZnCl2<br>
(4). In that case, the third embodiment set out below, provides a<br>
solution to this problem.<br>
This third embodiment of the process is illustrated in Figure<br>
3. Here, l2 is prel2rentially eliminated in an iron volatilisation<br>
step (103) taking place after the chlorination step (100) and the<br>
elimination of the reaction vapours (19). Therefore, during said<br>
chlorination step (100) the addition of the chlorinating agent (2) is<br>
controlled in such a way that substantially no l2(III) chloride is<br>
formed, as explained above. In the iron volatilisation step (103), l2<br>
is eliminated by injection of an oxidising chlorinating agent (10)<br>
such as chlorine into the melt. The formed l2(III) chloride is<br>
volatilised (9) at a temperature comprised between 400 and 730 °C,<br>
prel2rably between 600 and 700 °C. This elimination cannot reach<br>
100%, but the aim is to lower the l2 concentration to a level where<br>
it can be blocked by the addition of oxides in the subsequent<br>
conversion step (102), as was explained in the second embodiment.<br>
The volatilised l2(III) chloride (9) contains some ZnCl2. This<br>
mixture can be purified (104) by selectively condensing the zinc<br>
chloride, e.g. by using a rectifying column for producing pure<br>
l2(III) chloride (11). A good separation implies a contact between a<br>
liquid and a gas phase. Since the temperature range for the molten<br>
state of l2(III) chloride is very limited, this distillation is<br>
carried out efficiently when using a liquid reflux carrier (12). This<br>
carrier is prel2rably a recycled stream from the flow sheet as will<br>
be explained below, or a chloride whose vapour pressure is low at the<br>
working temperature, e.g. NaCl. The reflux flow (20) from the bottom<br>
of the rectifying column, which is rich in liquid reflux carrier, can<br>
be recycled to the chlorination step (100) or to the conversion step<br>
(102).<br>
The l2-depleted melt (3*) exiting from the iron volatilisation<br>
step (103) is then subjected to the conversion step (102), as in the<br>
second embodiment. Here the l2, already being present as l2(III),<br>
precipitates directly as Fe2Cl3 upon addition of a metal oxide-bearing<br>
compound (6) such as PbO, CaO, CaCO3, or prel2rably ZnO. The oxides of<br>
Mg and Ni are also substantially precipitated, and partially the<br>
oxides of Mn and Co. A small amount of oxidising agent (7) such as<br>
chlorine gas can be added to the melt to oxidise Mn and Co to a state<br>
enabling a precipitation of the major part of their oxides.<br>
After this step, the resulting converted l2-poor melt (3*) is<br>
heated, prel2rably up to its boiling point, in order to vaporise the<br>
ZnCl2 so as to separate it from the other chlorides e.g. by fractional<br>
distillation (101). Purified ZnCl2 (4) and a Zn-depleted melt (5) are<br>
produced as in the previous embodiments. The purified ZnCl2 (4) can<br>
then be l2d in an electrolysis cell (105), where it is processed as<br>
explained above. A small part of this ZnCl2 can be used as liquid<br>
reflux carrier (12) for the l2(III) chloride distillation (104).<br>
At the anode of the electrolysis cell, chlorine gas is evolved<br>
(16). This gas can be recycled as a chlorinating agent (2) to the<br>
first step of the process (100), but also as an oxidising agent (7)<br>
for the conversion step (102), and as a chlorinating agent (10) for<br>
the elimination of l2 as l2(III) chloride by volatilisation (103).<br>
The Zn-depleted melt (5) can then be further processed in a<br>
separation step (106), as in the previous embodiments, for producing<br>
an oxide residue (8) and recovering metal values (17). The resulting<br>
metal-depleted melt (18) can be recycled to the chlorination step<br>
(100) as explained above.<br>
In order to achieve a still better separation of the difl2rent<br>
elements, especially when the l2ed contains lead and/or cadmium, the<br>
ZnCl2 distilling step (101) is performed in two steps. First, in a<br>
flash evaporation step, the converted l2-poor melt (3*), or in the<br>
case of the first embodiment, the Zn-rich chlorinated melt (3), is<br>
heated, prel2rably up to its boiling point, in order to volatilise<br>
(101") ZnCl2 together with a fraction of other less volatile metal<br>
chlorides such as PbCl2 and CdCl2, thereby obtaining a Zn-depleted<br>
melt (5) and a ZnCl2-rich gaseous phase (13). This flow (13) is<br>
rectified in a distillation column (101"), producing pure ZnCl2 (4)<br>
and, at the bottom of the column, a melt composed of the metal<br>
chlorides less volatile than ZnCl2, in particular PbCl2 and CdCl3<br>
(14). This melt can be processed further to valorise said components.<br>
For instance, a mixture of PbCl2 and CdCl3 can be subjected to<br>
electrolysis to produce metallic Pb and Cd. Both-metals can then<br>
easily be separated from each other, e.g. by vaporisation.<br>
Part of the obtained metal chlorides less volatile than ZnCl3<br>
(14) may also be used as liquid reflux carrier (12) for the l2(III)<br>
chloride distillation (104).<br>
The purified ZnCl2 (4), and the Zn-depleted chlorinated melt (5)<br>
can be further processed as explained in embodiments 1 to 3.<br>
The following examples illustrate the main steps of the process<br>
of the invention.<br>
Example 1: chlorination of zinc blende<br>
This example demonstrates the ability of the process to leach a<br>
blende concentrate (process step 100: reacting Zn bearing material<br>
with chlorinating agent).<br>
2 kg of a molten solvent was prepared by mixing chloride salts<br>
in a quartz reactor. The composition of the solvent was: 51 mol%<br>
ZnCl2, 11.3 mol% PbCl2, 3 mol% CdCl2, 2 mol% KC1, 12.1 mol% NaCl, 17.4<br>
mol% CaCl2, 2.4 mol% CuCl, 0.8 mol% BaCl2. The mixture was heated to<br>
600 °C under nitrogen. 1.6 kg of a blende concentrate was gradually<br>
added to the melt. The blende contained 50.6 wt% Zn, 9.2 wt% l2, 1.8<br>
wt% Pb, 0.1 wt% Cd, 0.23 wt% Cu, 33 wt% S. Chlorine gas was<br>
introduced by a quartz injection tube located at the bottom of the<br>
reactor, at a rate of 500 cc/min during 13 h. Sulphur was evolved<br>
from the reactor and collected in a condenser.<br>
In order to evaluate the chlorination, the resulting melt was<br>
dissolved in 5 1 of a NaCl 5 M solution, which favours the<br>
dissolution of the formed chlorides. The solid residue was filtered<br>
out of the solution and analysed for base metals content. Table 1<br>
shows the extraction yield.<br>
The process achieved very high extraction yields for the main<br>
components of the blende in one single leaching step.<br>
Example 2; chlorination of an oxide l2ed<br>
This example demonstrates the ability of the process to leach<br>
an oxide l2ed (process step 100: reacting Zn bearing material with<br>
chlorinating agent).<br>
2 kg of a molten solvent was prepared by mixing chloride salts<br>
in a quartz reactor. The composition of the solvent was: 51 mol%<br>
ZnCl2, 11.3 mol% PbCl2, 3 mol% CdCl2, 2 mol% KC1, 12.1 mol% KaCl, 17.4<br>
mol% CaCl2/ 2.4 mol% CuCl, 0.8 mol% BaCl2. The mixture was heated to<br>
600 °C under nitrogen. 1 kg of Waelz oxide was gradually added to the<br>
melt. The oxide contained 56 wt% Zn, 3.32 wt% l2, 7.9 wt% Pb.<br>
Chlorine gas was introduced by a quartz injection tube located at the<br>
bottom of the reactor, at a rate of 500 cc/min during 10 h.<br>
In order to evaluate the chlorination, the resulting melt was<br>
dissolved in 5 1 of a NaCl 5 M solution, which favours the<br>
dissolution of the formed chlorides. The solid residue was filtered<br>
out of the solution and analysed for its base metals content. Table 2<br>
shows the extraction yield.<br>
The process achieved very high extraction yields for Zn and Pb;<br>
the l2 yield is lower than with blende because Fe2O3 is less reactive<br>
than the iron sulphide.<br>
Example 3: l2(III) chloride elimination<br>
This example demonstrates the ability of the process to<br>
eliminate iron from the melt (process step 103: volatilising l2 as<br>
l2(Ill) chloride).<br>
A melt was prepared by chlorination of 2 kg of zinc blende with<br>
chlorine gas, in 1.8 kg of molten solvent. The zinc blende and the<br>
molten solvent had the same composition as in Example 1. After the<br>
chlorination, the melt contained 4 wt% of l2, which is too much to be<br>
blocked as Fe2Cl3 by addition of e.g. ZnO, as explained above.<br>
Chlorine gas was injected in the melt at a flow rate of 500<br>
ml/min during 6 h. The temperature of the melt was 620 °C. The<br>
experiment was stopped when almost no brown fumes (indicating the<br>
presence of l2(III) chloride) were produced anymore. The analysis of<br>
the melt showed that the residual l2 content was 0.21 wt%, and thus<br>
that 95.8 % of the l2 had been eliminated. The final l2 content is<br>
well below the limit of 2 wt% and can thus be blocked as an oxide. In<br>
those conditions, the contamination of ZnCl2 by iron will be<br>
negligible.<br>
Example 4; precipitation of oxides<br>
This example demonstrates the ability of the process to<br>
precipitate the oxides of l2, Mg, Mn, Co and Ni (process step 102:<br>
converting).<br>
A melt was prepared with the following composition (in wt%):<br>
46.2 ZnCl2, 17.1 PbCl3, 14.1 CaCl2, 3.8 CuCl, 3 CdCla, 2.7 HnCl2, 2.4<br>
l2Cl3, 2.4 CoCl2, 2 MgCl2, 1.9 NiCl2, 1.3 AgCl, 1.1 BaCl2, 1 KCl, 0.9<br>
NaCl. The total weight was 1 kg. The salts were heated, melted and<br>
kept at a temperature of 600 °C. 110 g ZnO was added to the melt, and<br>
then Cl2 was bubbled through the mixture. 44 g of Cl2 was added<br>
subsequently.<br>
The amounts of metals in solution, and the amounts present as<br>
solid residue were determined. The percentage of precipitated metals,<br>
with ZnO only and with the subsequent addition of chlorine is<br>
presented in Table 3.<br>
The purge of Mg, Ni, Mn and Co, together with the blocking of<br>
the last traces of l2, with the addition of ZnO and Cl2 is thus<br>
efficient and constitutes an exit for these elements.<br>
Example 5: ZnCl2 flash evaporation<br>
This example demonstrates the ability of the process to<br>
separate ZnCl3, PbCl2 and CdCl2 from the other components of the melt<br>
(process step 101": volatilising ZnCl2).<br>
A melt was prepared by chlorination of 2 kg of blende and<br>
elimination of l2 as in Example 3. 50 g of ZnO was added to the melt<br>
to block the remaining iron as Fe2O3. In a consecutive step, the<br>
temperature of the melt was raised to 800 °C to vaporise ZnCl2,<br>
together with some PbCl2 and CdCl2. 70 % of the 2nCl2 initially<br>
present was evaporated. The vapours were condensed in an air-cooled<br>
reactor and analysed. They consisted of ZnCl2 and some other elements.<br>
The concentrations of these elements before and after the flash<br>
evaporation, and the percentage of extraction, are given in Table 4.<br>
The results show that the process can satisfactorily extract<br>
the ZnCl2 from the chlorinated melt, together with a sufficient amount<br>
of PbCl2 and CdCl2 to constitute an efficient purge. This purge is<br>
only slightly contaminated by l2, Cu and Mn.<br>
Example 6; rectification of ZnCl2<br>
This example demonstrates the ability of the process to deliver<br>
pure ZnCl2 (process step 101": rectifying the Zn-rich gaseous phase).<br>
The melt obtained after the flash evaporation, as described in<br>
Example 5, was subjected to a distillation using a rectification<br>
column. The melt, placed in a boiler under the column, was heated up<br>
to 800 °C. The distillate was condensed and analysed. The total<br>
amount of impurities in the melt was about 10 ppm. The most important<br>
impurities are reported in Table 5.<br>
The process is thus able to produce a very pure ZnCl2. This<br>
ZnCl2, when electrolysed, will yield Zn metal meeting at least<br>
commercial Special High Grade specifications.<br>
