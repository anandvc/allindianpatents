				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
Nitrogen-Containing Organosilicon Compound, Method of Manufacture,<br>
and Method of Treating Surfaces<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001] This invention is related to a nitrogen-containing organosilicon compound and to a<br>
method of manufacture, as well as to a silane coupling agent prepared from the nitrogen-<br>
containing organosilicon compound.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Organosilicon compounds that contain amino groups and alkoxysilyl groups are<br>
used as silane coupling agents. For example, alkoxysilanes that contain primary amino<br>
groups and expressed by the formulae<br>
H2NC3H6Si(OC2H5)3 and H2NC2H4NHC3H6Si(OCH3)3 are known.<br>
However, a disadvantage of such compounds is that when compounds that contain primary<br>
amino groups are used in conjunction with organic resins, such as epoxy resins that utilize<br>
amines as curing catalysts, the amino-group containing compounds exert an adverse effect<br>
on the curability of the resins. Therefore, it has been proposed to use alkoxysilanes of the<br>
formulae shown as disclosed in USP 5,476,884 and JP 2002-193976 A, with secondary<br>
amino groups such as P h NH C3H6Si(0 C H3)3 where P h is a phenyl group,<br>
CH3(CH2)3NHC3H6Si(O CH3)3, or alkoxysilanes with tertiary amino groups such<br>
as(G4H9)2NC3H6Si(OCH3)3.<br>
[0003] Although the alkoxysilanes with such secondary or tertiary amino groups reduce<br>
the effect on curability of the resins to some extent, their adhesion-improving effect with<br>
respect to various substrates is insignificant, and their silane coupling function is<br>
insufficient. Another disadvantage of the last mentioned compounds is that, in the<br>
manufacturing process, they produce a large amount of by-products in the form of amine<br>
hydrochloric salts.<br><br>
[0004] On the other hand, organosilicon compounds with amide groups are known in the<br>
art including alkoxysilanes such as<br>
H2N C O NH C3H6Si(O C2H5)3 and H2N C O C3H6Si(0 C2H5)3 as in US<br>
Patent 3,033,815 (May 8, 1962). Furthermore, US Patent 4,209,455<br>
(June 24,1980) discloses alkoxysilanes which contain secondary amide groups such as<br>
H2N C2H4NHC O C3H6Si(0 C2H5)3 and<br>
C18H37NHCOC2H4NHC3H6Si(OC2H5)3.<br>
[0005] However, even these alkoxysilanes still exert unfavorable effect on curability and<br>
adhesion-imparting properties of the resins, and therefore are not yet sufficient in their<br>
function as silane coupling agents.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0006] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide novel nitrogen-<br>
containing organosilicon compounds with tertiary amino and carbonyl groups.<br>
[10007] It is anotlier object to provide a method for manufacturing such nitrogen-<br>
containing compounds, and silane coupling agents prepared from these nitro gen-containing<br>
organosilicon compounds.<br>
[0008] These and other features of the invention will become apparent from a<br>
consideration of the detailed description.<br>

[0023] The nitrogen-containia.g organosilicon compounds of the present invention can be<br>
obtained by causing an addition reaction between compound (A) of the following general<br>
formula(IV) :<br>
wherein R4, R5, R 6, R 8 , x , and y, are the same as defined above;<br>
and a compound (B) of the following general formula(III) :<br><br>
wherein R1, R2, R3, R7, and m, are the same as defined above;<br>
or a compound (B) of the following general formula(V) :<br><br>
wherein R9, R3 R7, and m, are the same as defined above.<br>
[0024] Component (A) represented by the general formula (IV) is a commercially<br>
available organosilicon compound such as<br>
3 -aminopropyltrimethoxysilane, 3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane,<br>
3-aminopropylmethyldiniethoxysilaneJ3-aminopropyltri(metboxyethoxy)silane,<br>
4-aminobutyltrirnethoxysilane, 5-aminopentyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
N-(2-aminoethyl)-3-aminopropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
N -(2-aminoethyl)-3 -aminopropyltriethoxysilane,<br>
N-(2-aininoethyl)-3-aminopropyltri(rnethoxyethoxy)silane, and<br>
N-(2-aminoethyl)-4-aniinobutyltrimethoxysilane, Of these, the most preferred are 3-<br>
aminopropyltrimethoxysilane and 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
[0025] Component (B) of Formulae (III) or (V)can be a acrylamide or acrylester with<br>
tertiary amino groups. These compounds are commercially available and are exemplified<br>
by N.N-dimethylacrylamide,<br>
N, N-dimethylmethacrylamide, N, N-diethylacrylamide,<br>
N,N-dipropylacrylamide, N,N-methylethylacrylamide,<br>
N, N -dimethylmethacrylamide, N, N -dibutyttnethacrylamide,<br>
N-piperazinoacrylamide, N-acryloylmorphohne, N.N-dimethylaminoethylacrylamide,<br>
N,N-diethylaminopropylmethacrylamide, 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl acrylate,<br>
2-(diethylamino)ethyl acrylate, and 2-(dibutylamino)ethyl acrylate.<br><br>
Of these, most preferred are N,N-dimethylacrylarnide and N-acryloylmorpholine.<br>
[0026] Although a reaction of addition between components A and B can be carried out<br>
at room temperature, it is preferred to conduct the reaction with heating at a temperature not<br>
exceeding 150 °C, most preferably at a. temperature between 60-100 °C. It is also preferred<br>
to fill the interior of the reactor with an inert gas such as argon or nitrogen. The addition<br>
reaction can be carried out as a consecutive reaction or a one-stage reaction. It is preferred<br>
to heat one of the components (A) or (B), while the other component is added gradually.<br>
[0027] One distinguishing feature of the invention is that when the nitrogen-containing<br>
organosilicon compound is used in conjunction with an organic resin to which an amine<br>
functions as a curing catalyst, the unfavorable effect of the compound on curability of the<br>
resin is reduced because of the tertiary amine group on the molecular terminal. Another<br>
distinguishing feature of the invention is that the nitrogen-containing organosilicon<br>
compounds can be produced with high yield using commercially available starting<br>
materials. A further distinguishing feature of the manufacturing method of the invention is<br>
that the reaction can proceed efficiently even without the use of any catalyst and any<br>
solvent. The manufacturing process can be carried out without the use of any special<br>
reactor and can be performed on conventional equipment.<br>
[0028] The nitrogen-containing organosilicon compounds of the invention provide<br>
improved adhesion between various substrates, in particular between organic resins and<br>
inorganic materials, or metal materials, when x in the general Formulae (I ) and (II) is 0 or<br>
1. Because of these features, nitrogen-containing organosilicon compounds of the present<br>
invention are suitable for use as surface-treatment agents, adhesion improvers, primers, and<br>
silane coupling agents, for improving the properties of organic resins. The organic resins<br>
suitable for purposes of the invention include epoxy resins, phenol resins, urethane resins,<br>
melamine resins, polycarbonate resins, polyethylene resins, polyvinylchloride resins, and<br>
polyamide resins.<br>
[0029] In use as silane coupling agents, the nitrogen-containing organosilicon compounds<br>
of general Formulae ( I ) or (II) may be diluted with water or an organic solvent. The<br>
organic solvent suitable for this purpose include methanol, ethanol, or similar water soluble<br><br>
organic solvent. The coupling agent can be applied onto the surface of substrate to be<br>
treated or it can be added to the organic resins. The former method is preferred.<br>
[0030] Several processes can be used for applying the coupling agent. The coupling agent<br>
alone can be sprayed onto the substrate; the coupling agent can be diluted in an organic<br>
solvent and the solution can be sprayed onto the surface of the substrate; the coupling agent<br>
can be diluted in a water/organic solvent mixture and sprayed onto-the substrate; the<br>
substrate can be impregnated with the treatment solution obtained with the coupling agent<br>
and an organic solvent; and the substrate can be impregnated with the treatment liquid<br>
obtained by mixing the coupling agent with the water/organic solvent mixture.<br>
These treatments can be completed by the application of heat.<br>
[0031] Substrates which can be treated with the silane coupling agent of the invention<br>
include powdered materials such as fumed silica, wet-process silica, baked silica, fumed<br>
titanium dioxide, powdered quartz, diatomaceous earth, alurninum hydroxide, aluminum<br>
oxide, magnesium oxide, aluminosilicate, iron oxide, zinc oxide, calcium oxide, zinc<br>
carbonate, mica, and magnesium carbonate; fibrous materials such as glass fiber, Nylon<br>
fiber, and carbon fiber; and plates such as glass plates, copper plates, iron plates, stainless-<br>
steel plates, and aluminum plates.<br>

[0037] A four neck flask equipped with a thermometer, stirrer, and cooler, was filled with<br>
222.4 parts by weight of N-(2-ammoethyl)-3-ammopjx&gt;pyltrimethoxysilane, and the content<br>
of the flask was heated in a nitrogenous atmosphere to 700C. Then, 109.0 parts by weight<br>
of N,N-dimethylacrylamide was added dropwise over 30 minutes, and the mixture was<br>
stirred and heated for S hours at 1001. The reaction mixture was distilled under a reduced<br>
pressure at 130°C and 1.3 hPa to produce 324.8 parts by weight of a yellowish transparent<br>
liquid, at a yield of 98 percent. Results of 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance spectra]<br>
analysis (NMR), and infrared analysis (IR), defined the product as a nitrogen-containing<br>
organosilicon compound of the formula<br>
(C H3)2NC O C2H4NH C2H4NH C3H6Si(O C H3)3.<br><br>
Practical Example 6<br>
[003 8] The nitrogen-containing organosilicon compounds obtained in Practical Examples<br>
1-5 were diluted with a mixture of water and ethanol in a 1:1 weight ratio of water to<br>
ethanol. This produced treatment liquids with a concentration of 0.4 weight percent of the<br>
organosilicon compound. Glass plates were immersed for 10 seconds in these solutions,<br>
respectively, and then dried for one hour at 120 °C. Then, a curable epoxy resin<br>
composition consisting of 100 parts by weight of a bisphenol type A epoxy resin sold under<br>
the name EPICOAT 828 having an epoxy equivalent of 185; 8 parts by weight of<br>
dicyandiamide; and 0.4 parts by weight of N-dimethylbenzylarnine, was applied to the<br>
surfaces of the glass plates. The coatings were dried for 90 minutes at 170 °C. There was<br>
obtained cured epoxy resin coatings firmly adhered to the glass surface, having a<br>
cylindrical shape with a 5 mm diameter and 5 mm height.<br>
[0039] The coated samples were analyzed for adhesion of the cured epoxy resin using a<br>
durometer. The adhesive force was also measured prior and after a Pressure Cooker Test<br>
(PCT) which consisted of heating the samples for 24 hours at 121 °C and 100 % Relative<br>
Humidity. The results of the PCT tests are shown in Table 1.<br>
[0040J In Comparative Examples, adhesive force was measured using silane coupling<br>
agents as noted below:<br>
Comparative Example 1: H2NCONHC3H6Si(0 C2H5)3<br>
Comparative Example 2: P h NHC3H6Si(O CH3)3 where P h is phenyl.<br>
Comparative Example 3; C18H37NHCO C2H4NHC3H6Si(0 C2H5)3,<br>
The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br><br>
