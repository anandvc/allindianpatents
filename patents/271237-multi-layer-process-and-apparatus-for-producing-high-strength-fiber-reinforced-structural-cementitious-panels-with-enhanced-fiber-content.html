				<td>MULTI-LAYER PROCESS AND APPARATUS FOR PRODUCING<br>
HIGH STRENGTH FIBER-REINFORCED STRUCTURAL<br>
CEMENTITIOUS PANELS WITH ENHANCED FIBER CONTENT<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
This invention relates to a continuous process and<br>
related apparatus for producing structural panels using a settable<br>
slurry, and more specifically, to a process for manufacturing reinforced<br>
cementitious panels, referred to herein as structural cementitious<br>
panels (SCP) (also known as structural cement panels), in which<br>
discrete fibers are combined with a quick-setting slurry for providing<br>
flexural strength and toughness. The invention also relates to a SCP<br>
panel produced according to the present process.<br>
Cementitious panels have been used in the construction<br>
industry to form the interior and exterior walls of residential and/or<br>
commercial structures. The advantages of such panels include<br>
resistance to moisture compared to standard gypsum-based<br>
wallboard. However, a drawback of such conventional panels is that<br>
they do not have sufficient structural strength to the extent that such<br>
panels may be comparable to, if not stronger than, structural plywood<br>
or oriented strand board (OSB).<br>
Typically, the present state-of-the-art cementitious<br>
panels include at least one hardened cement or plaster composite<br>
layer between layers of a reinforcing or stabilizing material. In some<br><br>
instances, the reinforcing or stabilizing material is continuous<br>
fiberglass mesh or the equivalent, while in other instances, short,<br>
discrete fibers are used in the cementitious core as reinforcing<br>
material. In the former case, the mesh is usually applied from a roll in<br>
sheet fashion upon or between layers of settable slurry. Examples of<br>
production techniques used in conventional cementitious panels are<br>
provided in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,420,295; 4,504,335 and 6,176,920, the<br>
contents of which are incorporated by reference herein. Further, other<br>
gypsum-cement compositions are disclosed generally in U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 5,685,903; 5,858,083 and 5,958,131.<br>
One drawback of conventional processes for producing<br>
cementitious panels that utilize building up of multiple layers of slurry<br>
and discrete fibers to obtain desired panel thickness is that the<br>
discrete fibers introduced in the slurry in a mat or web form, are not<br>
properly and uniformly distributed in the slurry, and as such, the<br>
reinforcing properties that essentially result due to interaction between<br>
fibers and matrix vary through the thickness of the board, depending<br>
on the thickness of each board layer and number of other variables.<br>
When insufficient penetration of the slurry through the fiber network<br>
occurs, poor bonding and interaction between the fibers and the matrix<br>
results, leading to low panel strength development. Also, in extreme<br>
cases when distinct layering of slurry and fibers occurs, improper<br>
bonding and inefficient distribution of fibers causes inefficient<br>
utilization of fibers, eventually leading to extremely poor panel strength<br>
development.<br>
Another drawback of conventional processes for<br>
producing cementitious panels is that the resulting products are too<br>
costly and as such are not competitive with outdoor/structural plywood<br>
or oriented strand board (OSB).<br><br>
One source of the relatively high cost of conventional<br>
cementitious panels is due to production line downtime caused by<br>
premature setting of the slurry, especially in particles or clumps which<br>
impair the appearance of the resulting board, and interfere with the<br>
efficiency of production equipment. Significant buildups of prematurely<br>
set slurry on production equipment require shutdowns of the<br>
production line, thus increasing the ultimate board cost.<br>
Thus, there is a need for a process and/or a related<br>
apparatus for producing fiber-reinforced cementitious panels which<br>
results in a board with structural properties comparable to structural<br>
plywood and OSB which reduces production line downtime due to<br>
prematurely set slurry particles. There is also a need for a process<br>
and/or a related apparatus for producing such structural cementitious<br>
panels which more efficiently uses component materials to reduce<br>
production costs over conventional production processes.<br>
Furthermore, the above-described need for cementitious<br>
structural panels, also referred to as SCP's, that are configured to<br>
behave in the construction environment similar to plywood and OSB,<br>
means that the panels are nailable and can be cut or worked using<br>
conventional saws and other conventional carpentry tools. Further,<br>
the SCP panels should meet building code standards for shear<br>
resistance, load capacity, water-induced expansion and resistance to<br>
combustion, as measured by recognized tests, such as ASTM E72,<br>
ASTM 661, ASTM C 1185 and ASTM E136 or equivalent, as applied<br>
to structural plywood sheets.<br><br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
The above-listed needs are met or exceeded by the<br>
present invention that features a multi-layer process for producing<br>
structural cementitious panels (SCP's or SCP panels), and SCP's<br>
produced by such a process. After one of an initial deposition of<br>
loosely distributed, chopped fibers or a layer of slurry upon a moving<br>
web, fibers are deposited upon the slurry layer. An embedment device<br>
thoroughly mixes the recently deposited fibers into the slurry so that<br>
the fibers are distributed throughout the slurry, after which additional<br>
layers of slurry, then chopped fibers are added, followed by more<br>
embedment. The process is repeated for each layer of the panel, as<br>
desired. Upon completion, the board has a more evenly distributed<br>
fiber component,.which results in relatively strong panels without the<br>
need for thick mats of reinforcing fibers, as are taught in prior art<br>
production techniques for cementitious panels. In addition, the<br>
resulting panel Is optionally provided with increased amount of fibers<br>
per slurry layer than in prior panels.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, multiple layers of chopped<br>
individual loose fibers are deposited relative to each layer of deposited<br>
slurry. The preferred sequence is that a layer of loose fibers are<br>
deposited, upon either the moving web or existing slurry, followed by a-<br>
layer of slurry, then another layer of fibers. Next, the fiber/slurry/fiber<br>
combination is subjected to embedding to thoroughly mix the fibers in<br>
the slurry. This procedure has been found to permit the incorporation<br>
and distribution of a relatively larger amount of slurry fibers throughout<br>
the slurry using fewer slurry layers. Thus, panel production equipment<br>
and processing time can be reduced, while providing an SCP panel<br>
with enhanced strength characteristics.<br><br>
More specifically, a process is provided for producing<br>
structural cementitious panels made of at least one layer of fiber<br>
reinforced cementitious slurry, the process for each such layer of<br>
slurry including providing a moving web; depositing a first layer of<br>
individual, loose fibers upon the web; depositing a layer of settable<br>
slurry upon the deposited first layer of individual, loose fibers;<br>
depositing a second layer of individual, loose fibers upon the<br>
deposited layer of settable slurry; and actively embedding both layers<br>
of individual, loose fibers into the layer of slurry to distribute the fibers<br>
throughout the slurry.<br>
In another embodiment, an apparatus for producing a<br>
multi-layered structural cementitious panel includes a conveyor-type<br>
frame supporting a moving web; a first loose fiber distribution station in<br>
operational relationship to the frame and is configured for depositing<br>
loose fibers upon the moving web; a first slurry feed station in<br>
operational relationship to the frame and configured for depositing a<br>
thin layer of settable slurry upon the moving web so that the fibers are<br>
covered. A second loose fiber distribution station is provided in<br>
operational relationship to the frame and is configured for depositing<br>
loose fibers upon the slurry. An embedment device is in operational<br>
relationship to the frame and is configured for generating a kneading<br>
action in the slurry to embed the fibers into the slurry.<br>
In yet another embodiment, a process is provided for<br>
making fiber-embedded cementitious panels, comprising:<br>

a first fiber layer to be deposited in each settable slurry layer of the<br>

BEST MODE OF CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1, a structural panel production line<br>
is diagrammatically shown and is generally designated 10. The<br>
production line 10 includes a support frame or forming table 12 having a<br>
plurality of legs 13 or other supports. Included on the support frame 12<br>
is a moving carrier 14, such as an endless rubber-like conveyor<br><br>
with a smooth, water-impervious surface, however porous surfaces<br>
are contemplated. As is well known in the art, the support frame 12<br>
may be made of at least one table-like segment, which may include<br>
designated legs 13. The support frame 12 also includes a main drive<br>
roll 16 at a distal end 18 of the frame, and an idler roll 20 at a proximal<br>
end 22 of the frame. Also, at least one belt tracking and/or tensioning<br>
device 24 is preferably provided for maintaining a desired tension and<br>
positioning of the carrier 14 upon the rolls 16, 20.<br>
Also, in the preferred embodiment, a web 26 of kraft<br>
paper, release paper, and/or other webs of support material designed<br>
for supporting a slurry prior to setting, as is well known in the art, may<br>
be provided and laid upon the carrier 14 to protect it and/or keep it<br>
clean. However, it is also contemplated that the panels produced by<br>
the present line 10 are formed directly upon the carrier 14. !n the latter<br>
situation, at least one belt washing unit 28 is provided. The carrier 14<br>
is moved along the support frame 12 by a combination of motors,<br>
pulleys, belts or chains which drive the main drive roll 16 as is known<br>
in the art. It is contemplated that the speed of the carrier 14 may vary<br>
to suit the application.<br>
In the present invention, structural cementitious panel<br>
production is initiated by one of depositing a layer of loose, chopped<br>
fibers 30 or a layer of slurry upon the web 26. An advantage of<br>
depositing the fibers 30 before the first deposition of slurry is that<br>
fibers will be embedded near the outer surface of the resulting panel.<br>
A variety of fiber depositing and chopping devices are contemplated<br>
by the present line 10, however the preferred system employs at least<br>
one rack 31 holding several spools 32 of fiberglass cord, from each of<br>
which a cord 34 of fiber is fed to a chopping station or apparatus, also<br>
referred to as a chopper 36.<br><br>
The chopper 36 includes a rotating bladed roll 38 from<br>
which project radially extending blades 40 extending transversely<br>
across the width of the carrier 14, and which is disposed in close,<br>
contacting, rotating relationship with an anvil roll 42. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, the bladed roll 38 and the anvil roll 42 are disposed in<br>
relatively close relationship such that the rotation of the bladed roll 38<br>
also rotates the anvil roll 42, however the reverse is also<br>
contemplated. Also, the anvil roll 42 is preferably covered with a<br>
resilient support material against which the blades 40 chop the cords<br>
34 into segments. The spacing of the blades 40 on the roll 38<br>
determines the length of the chopped fibers. As is seen in FIG. 1, the<br>
chopper 36 is disposed above the carrier 14 near the proximal end 22<br>
to maximize the productive use of the length of the production line 10.<br>
As the fiber cords 34 are chopped, the fibers 30 fall loosely upon the<br>
carrier web 26.<br>
Next, a slurry feed station, or a slurry feeder 44 receives<br>
a supply of slurry 46 from a remote mixing location 47 such as a<br>
hopper, bin or the like. It is also contemplated that the process may<br>
begin with the initial deposition of slurry upon the carrier 14. While a<br>
variety of settable slurries are contemplated, the present process is<br>
particularly designed for producing structural cementitious panels. As<br>
such, the slurry is preferably comprised of varying amounts of Portland<br>
cement, gypsum, aggregate, water, accelerators, plasticizers, foaming<br>
agents, fillers and/or other ingredients well known in the art, and<br>
described in the patents listed above which have been incorporated by<br>
reference. The relative amounts of these ingredients, including the<br>
elimination of some of the above or the addition of others, may vary to<br>
suit the application.<br><br>
While various configurations of slurry feeders 44 are<br>
contemplated which evenly deposit a thin layer of slurry 46 upon the<br>
moving carrier 14, the preferred slurry feeder 44 includes a main<br>
metering roll 48 disposed transversely to the direction of travel of the<br>
carrier 14. A companion or back up roll 50 is disposed in close<br>
parallel, rotational relationship to the metering roll 48 to form a nip 52<br>
therebetween. A pair of sidewalls 54, preferably of non-stick material<br>
such as Teflon® brand material or the like, prevents slurry 46 poured<br>
into the nip 52 from escaping out the sides of the feeder 44.<br>
An important feature of the present invention is that the<br>
feeder 44 deposits an even, relatively thin layer of the slurry 46 upon<br>
the moving carrier 14 or the carrier web 26. Suitable layer thicknesses<br>
range from about 0.05 inch to 0.20 inch (0.127-0.5cm). However, with<br>
four layers preferred in the preferred structural panel produced by the<br>
present process, and a suitable building panel being approximately 0.5<br>
inch (1.27cm), an especially preferred slurry layer thickness is<br>
approximately 0.125 inch (.3175cm).<br>
Referring now to FIGs. 1 and 2, to achieve a slurry layer<br>
thickness as described above, several features are provided to the<br>
slurry feeder 44. First, to ensure a uniform disposition of the slurry 46<br>
across the entire web 26, the slurry is delivered to the feeder 44<br>
through a hose 56 located in a laterally reciprocating, cable driven,<br>
fluid powered dispenser 58 of the type well known in the art. Slurry<br>
flowing from the hose 56 is thus poured into the feeder 44 in a laterally<br>
reciprocating motion to fill a reservoir 59 defined by the rolls 48, 50<br>
and the sidewalls 54. Rotation of the metering roll 48 thus draws a<br>
layer of the slurry 46 from the reservoir.<br>
Next, a thickness monitoring or thickness control roll 60<br>
is disposed slightly above and/or slightly downstream of a vertical<br><br>
centerline of the main metering roll 48 to regulate the thickness of the<br>
slurry 46 drawn from the feeder reservoir 57 upon an outer surface 62<br>
of the main metering roll 48. Another related feature of the thickness<br>
control roll 60 is that it allows handling of slurries with different and<br>
constantly changing viscosities. The main metering roll 48 is driven in<br>
the same direction of travel T as the direction of movement of the<br>
carrier 14 and the carrier web 26, and the main metering roll 48, the<br>
backup roll 50 and the thickness monitoring roll 60 are all rotatably<br>
driven in the same direction, which minimizes the opportunities for<br>
premature setting of slurry on the respective moving outer surfaces.<br>
As the slurry 46 on the outer surface 62 moves toward the carrier web<br>
26, a transverse stripping wire 64 located between the main metering<br>
roll 48 and the carrier web 26 ensures that the slurry 46 is completely<br>
deposited upon the carrier web and does not proceed back up toward<br>
the nip 52 and the feeder reservoir 59. The stripping wire 64 also<br>
helps keep the main metering roll 48 free of prematurely setting slurry<br>
and maintains a relatively uniform curtain of slurry.<br>
A second chopper station or apparatus 66, preferably<br>
identical to the chopper 36, is disposed downstream of the feeder 44<br>
to deposit a second layer of fibers 68 upon the slurry 46. In the<br>
preferred embodiment, the chopper apparatus 66 is fed cords 34 from<br>
the same rack 31 that feeds the chopper 36. However, it is<br>
contemplated that separate racks 31 could be supplied to each<br>
individual chopper, depending on the application.<br>
Referring now to FIGs. 1 and 3, next, an embedment<br>
device, generally designated 70 is disposed in operational relationship<br>
to the slurry 46 and the moving carrier 14 of the production line 10 to<br>
embed the fibers 68 into the slurry 46. While a variety of embedment<br>
devices are contemplated, including, but not limited to vibrators.<br><br>
sheep's foot rollers and the like, in the preferred embodiment, the<br>
embedment device 70 includes at least a pair of generally parallel<br>
shafts 72 mounted transversely to the direction of travel T of the<br>
carrier web 26 on the frame 12. Each shaft 72 is provided with a<br>
plurality of relatively large diameter disks 74 which are axially<br>
separated from each other on the shaft by small diameter disks 76.<br>
During SCP panel production, the shafts 72 and the<br>
disks 74, 76 rotate together about the longitudinal axis of the shaft. As<br>
is well known in the art, either one or both of the shafts 72 may be<br>
powered, and if only one is powered, the other may be driven by belts,<br>
chains, gear drives or other known power transmission technologies to<br>
maintain a corresponding direction and speed to the driving roll. The<br>
respective disks 74, 76 of the adjacent, preferably parallel shafts 72<br>
are intermeshed with each other for creating a "kneading" or<br>
"massaging" action in the slurry, which embeds the fibers 68<br>
previously deposited thereon. In addition, the close, intermeshed and<br>
rotating relationship of the disks 72, 74 prevents the buildup of slurry<br>
46 on the disks, and in effect creates a "self-cleaning" action which<br>
significantly reduces production line downtime due to premature<br>
setting of clumps of slurry.<br>
The intermeshed relationship of the disks 74, 76 on the<br>
shafts 72 includes a closely adjacent disposition of opposing<br>
peripheries of the small diameter spacer disks 76 and the relatively<br>
large diameter main disks 74, which also facilitates the self-cleaning<br>
action. As the disks 74, 76 rotate relative to each other in close<br>
proximity (but preferably in the same direction), it is difficult for<br>
particles of slurry to become caught in the apparatus and prematurely<br>
set. By providing two sets of disks 74 which are laterally offset relative<br>
to each other, the slurry 46 is subjected to multiple acts of disruption,<br><br>
creating a "kneading" action which further embeds the fibers 68 in the<br>
slurry 46.<br>
Once the fibers 68 have been embedded, or in other<br>
words, as the moving carrier web 26 passes the embedment device<br>
70, a first layer 77 of the SCP panel is complete. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, the height or thickness of the first layer 77 is in the<br>
approximate range of .05-.20 inch (0.127-0.5cm). This range has<br>
been found to provide the desired strength and rigidity when combined<br>
with like layers in a SCP panel. However, other thicknesses are<br>
contemplated depending on the application.<br>
To build a structural cementitious panel of desired<br>
thickness, additional layers are needed. To that end, a second slurry<br>
feeder 78, which is substantially identical to the feeder 44, is provided<br>
in operational relationship to the moving carrier 14, and is disposed for<br>
deposition of an additional layer 80 of the slurry 46 upon the existing<br>
layer 77.<br>
Next, an additional chopper 82, substantially identical to<br>
the choppers 36 and 66, is provided in operational relationship to the<br>
frame 12 to deposit a third layer of fibers 84 provided from a rack (not<br>
shown) constructed and disposed relative to the frame 12 in similar<br>
fashion to the rack 31. The fibers 84 are deposited upon the slurry<br>
layer 80 and are embedded using a second embedment device 86.<br>
Similar in construction and arrangement to the embedment device 70,<br>
the second embedment device 86 is mounted slightly higher relative to<br>
the moving carrier web 14 so that the first layer 77 is not disturbed. In<br>
this manner, the second layer 80 of slurry and embedded fibers is<br>
created.<br>
Referring now to FIGs. 1 and 4, with each successive<br>
layer of settable slurry and fibers, an additional slurry feeder station<br><br>
44, 78 followed by a fiber chopper 36, 66,82 and an embedment<br>
device 70, 86 is provided on the production line 10. In the preferred<br>
embodiment, four total layers 77, 80, 88,90 are provided to form the<br>
SCP panel 92. Upon the disposition of the four layers of fiber-<br>
embedded settable slurry as described above, a forming device 94<br>
(FIG. 1) is preferably provided to the frame 12 to shape an upper<br>
surface 96 of the panel 92. Such forming devices 94 are known in the<br>
settable slurry/board production art, and typically are spring-loaded or<br>
vibrating plates which conform the height and shape of the multi-<br>
layered panel to suit the desired dimensional characteristics. An<br>
important feature of the present invention is that the panel 92 consists<br>
of multiple layers 77, 80, 88, 90 which upon setting, form an integral,<br>
fiber-reinforced mass. Provided that the presence and placement of<br>
fibers in each layer are controlled by and maintained within certain<br>
desired parameters as is disclosed and described below, it will be<br>
virtually impossible to delaminate the panel 92 produced by the<br>
present process.<br>
At this point, the layers of slurry have begun to set, and<br>
the respective panels 92 are separated from each other by a cutting<br>
device 98, which in the preferred embodiment is a water jet cutter.<br>
Other cutting devices, including moving blades, are considered<br>
suitable for this operation, provided that they can create suitably sharp<br>
edges in the present panel composition. The cutting device 98 is<br>
disposed relative to the line 10 and the frame 12 so that panels are<br>
produced having a desired length, which may be different from the<br>
representation shown in FIG. 1. Since the speed of the carrier web 14<br>
is relatively slow, the cutting device 98 may be mounted to cut<br>
perpendicularly to the direction of travel of the web 14. With faster<br>
production speeds, such cutting devices are known to be mounted to<br><br>
the production line 10 on an angle to the direction of web travel. Upon<br>
cutting, the separated panels 92 are stacked for further handling,<br>
packaging, storage and/or shipment as is well known in the art.<br>
Referring now to FIGs. 4 and 5, an alternate embodiment<br>
to the production line 10 is generally designated 100. The line 100<br>
shares many components with the line 10, and these shared<br>
components have been designated with identical reference numbers.<br>
The main difference between the line 100 and the line 10 is that in the<br>
line 10, upon creation of the SCP panels 92, an underside 102 or<br>
bottom face of the panel will be smoother than the upper side or top<br>
face 96, even after being engaged by the forming device 94. In some<br>
cases, depending on the application of the panel 92, it may be<br>
preferable to have a smooth face and a relatively rough face.<br>
However, in other applications; it may be desirable to have a board in<br>
which both faces 96,102 are smooth. Since the smooth texture is<br>
generated by the contact of the slurry with the smooth carrier 14 or the<br>
carrier web 26, to obtain a SCP panel with both faces or sides smooth,<br>
both upper and lower faces 96,102 need to be formed against the<br>
carrier 14 or the release web 26.<br>
To that end, the production line 100 includes sufficient<br>
fiber chopping stations 36, 66, 82, slurry feeder stations 44, 78 and<br>
embedment devices 70, 86 to produce at least four layers 77, 80, 88<br>
and 90. Additional layers may be created by repetition of stations as<br>
described above in relation to the production line 10. However, in the<br>
production line 100, in the production of the last layer of the SCP<br>
panel, an upper deck 106 is provided having a reverse rotating web<br>
108 looped about main rolls 110,112 (one of which is driven) which<br>
deposits a layer of slurry and fibers 114 with a smooth outer surface<br>
upon the moving, multi-layered slurry 46.<br><br>
More particularly, the upper deck 106 includes an upper<br>
fiber deposition station 116 similar to the fiber deposition station 36, an<br>
upper slurry feeder station 118 similar to the feeder station 44, a<br>
second upper fiber deposition station 120 similar to the chopping<br>
station 66 and an embedment device 122 similar to the embedment<br>
device 70 for depositing the covering layer 114 in inverted position<br>
upon the moving slurry 46. Thus, the resulting SCP panel 124 has<br>
smooth upper and lower surfaces 96,102.<br>
Another feature of the present invention is that the<br>
resulting SCP panel 92,124 is constructed so that the fibers 30, 68, 84<br>
are uniformly distributed throughout the panel. This has been found to<br>
enable the production of relatively stronger panels with relatively less,<br>
more efficient use of fibers. The volume fraction of fibers relative to<br>
the volume of slurry in each layer preferably constitutes approximately<br>
in the range of 1.5% to 3% by volume of the slurry layers 77, 80, 88,<br>
90,114.<br>
Referring now to FIGs. 6 and 7, it has been found in<br>
providing panels produced using the apparatus of FIGs. 1-5 that in<br>
some cases the number of fibers per slurry layer is unduly limited due<br>
to a perceived difficulty in properly embedding sufficient numbers of<br>
fibers for producing a satisfactorily strong SCP panel. Since the<br>
incorporation of a higher volume fraction of loose fibers distributed<br>
throughout the slurry is an important factor in obtaining desired panel<br>
strength, improved efficiency in incorporating such fibers is desirable.<br>
It is believed that the system depicted in FIGs. 1-5 in some cases<br>
requires excessive numbers of slurry layers to obtain an SCP panel<br>
having sufficient fiber volume fraction.<br>
Accordingly, an alternate SCP panel production line or<br>
system is illustrated in FIG. 6 and is generally designated 130 for<br><br>
producing high-performance, fiber reinforced SCP panels<br>
incorporating a relatively high volume of fibers per slurry layer. In<br>
many cases, increased levels of fibers per panel are obtained using<br>
this system. While the system of FIGs. 1-5 discloses depositing a<br>
single discrete layer of fibers into each subsequent discrete layer of<br>
slurry deposited after the initial layer, the production line 130 includes<br>
a method of building up multiple discrete reinforcing fiber layers in<br>
each discrete slurry layer to obtain the desired panel thickness. Most<br>
preferably, the disclosed system embeds at least two discrete layers of<br>
reinforcing fibers, in a single operation, into an individual discrete layer<br>
of slurry. The discrete reinforcing fibers are embedded into the<br>
discrete layer of slurry using a suitable fiber embedment device.<br>
More specifically, in FIG. 6 components used in the<br>
system 130 and shared with the system 10 of FIGs. 1-5 are<br>
designated with identical reference numbers, and the above<br>
description of those components is considered applicable here.<br>
Furthermore, it is contemplated that the apparatus described in<br>
relation to FIG. 6 may be combined with that of FIGs. 1-5 in a retrofit<br>
manner, and it is also contemplated that the system 130 of FIG. 6 may<br>
be provided with the upper deck 106 of FIG. 5.<br>
In the alternate system 130, SCP panel production is<br>
initiated by depositing a first layer of loose-, chopped fibers 30 upon the<br>
web 26. Next, the slurry feed station, or the slurry feeder 44 receives<br>
a supply of slurry 46 from the remote mixing location 47 such as a<br>
hopper, bin or the like. It is contemplated that the slurry 46 in this<br>
embodiment is the same as that used in the production line 10 of<br>
FIGs. 1-5.<br>
Also, the slurry feeder 44 is basically the same, including<br>
the main metering roll, 48 and the back up roll 50 to form the nip 52<br><br>
and having the sidewalls 54. Suitable layer thicknesses range from<br>
about 0.05 inch to 0.35 inch (0.127-00.889cm). For instance, for<br>
manufacturing a nominal 3A" (10.889cm) thick structural panel, four<br>
slurry layers are preferred with an especially preferred slurry layer<br>
thickness of less than approximately 0.25 inch (.635cm) in the<br>
preferred structural panel produced by the present process.<br>
Referring to FIGs. 2 and 6, the slurry 46 is delivered to<br>
the feeder 44 through the hose 56 located in the laterally reciprocating,<br>
cable driven, fluid powered dispenser 58. Slurry flowing from the hose<br>
56 is thus poured into the feeder 44 in a laterally reciprocating motion<br>
to fill the reservoir or headbox 59 defined by the rolls 48, 50 and the<br>
sidewalls 54. Rotation of the metering roll 48 thus draws a layer of the<br>
slurry 46 from the reservoir.<br>
The system 130 is preferably provided with a vibrating<br>
gate 132 which meters slurry onto the deposition or metering roll 48.<br>
By vibrating, the gate 132 prevents significant buildup in the corners of<br>
the headbox 5S and provides a more uniform and thicker layer of<br>
slurry than was provided without vibration. Even with the addition of<br>
the vibrating gate 132, the main metering roll 48 and the backup roll 50<br>
are rotatably driven in the same direction of travel T as the direction<br>
of movement of the carrier 14 and the carrier web 26 which minimizes<br>
the opportunities for premature setting of slurry on the respective<br>
moving outer surfaces.<br>
As the slurry 46 on the outer surface 62 of the main<br>
metering roll 48 moves toward the carrier web 26, a spring biased<br>
doctor blade 134 is provided which separates the slurry from the main<br>
metering roll 48 and deposits the slurry onto the moving web 26. An<br>
improvement over the stripping wire 64, the doctor blade 134 provides<br>
the slurry 46 with a direct path down to within about 1.5 inches<br><br>
(3.81cm) of the carrier web 26, allowing an unbroken curtain of slurry<br>
to be continuously deposited onto the web or forming line, which is<br>
important to producing homogeneous panels.<br>
A second chopper station or apparatus 66, preferably<br>
identical to the chopper 36, is disposed downstream of the feeder 44<br>
to deposit a second layer of fibers 68 upon the slurry 46. In the<br>
preferred embodiment, the chopper apparatus 66 is fed cords 34 from<br>
the same rack 31 that feeds the chopper 36. However, it is<br>
contemplated that separate racks 31 could be supplied to each<br>
individual chopper, depending on the application.<br>
Referring again to FIG. 6, next, an embedment device,<br>
generally designated 136 is disposed in operational relationship to the<br>
slurry 46 and the moving carrier 14 of the production line 130 to<br>
embed the first and second layers of fibers 30, 68 into the slurry 46. .<br>
While a variety of embedment devices are contemplated, including,<br>
but not limited to vibrators, sheep's foot rollers and the like, in the<br>
preferred embodiment, the embedment device 136 is similar to the<br>
embedment device 70 with the exception that the overlap of the<br>
adjacent shafts 138 have been decreased to the range of<br>
approximately 0.5 inch (1.27cm). Also, the number of disks 140 has<br>
been reduced, and the disks are substantially thicker than that shown<br>
in FIG. 3. In addition, there is a tighter spacing or clearance between<br>
adjacent overlapping disks 140 of adjacent shafts 138, on the order of<br>
.010 to .018 inches (0.025-0.045cm), to prevent fibers from becoming<br>
lodged between adjacent disks. Otherwise, the embedment device<br>
136 provides the same sort of kneading action as the device 70, with<br>
the objective of embedding or thoroughly mixing the fibers 30, 68<br>
within the slurry 46.<br><br>
To further enhance the embedment of the fibers 30, 68<br>
into the slurry 46, it is preferred that at each embedment device136<br>
the frame 12 is provided with at least one vibrator 141 in operational<br>
proximity to the carrier web 14 or the paper web 26 to vibrate the<br>
slurry 46. Such vibration has been found to more uniformly distribute<br>
the chopped fibers 30, 68 throughout the slurry 46. Conventional<br>
vibrator devices are deemed suitable for this application.<br>
As seen in FIG. 6, to implement the present system 130<br>
of multiple layers of fibers 30, 68 for each layer of slurry 46, additional<br>
chopping stations 142 are provided between the embedment device<br>
136 and subsequent feeder boxes 78, so that for each layer of slurry<br>
46, fibers 30, 68 are deposited before and after deposition of the<br>
slurry. This improvement has been found to enable the introduction of<br>
significantly more fibers into the slurry and accordingly increase the<br>
strength of the resulting SCP panel. In the preferred embodiment,<br>
while only three are shown, four total layers of combined slurry and<br>
fiber are provided to form the SCP panel 92.<br>
Upon the disposition of the four layers of fiber-embedded<br>
settable slurry as described above, a forming device such as a<br>
vibrating shroud 144 is preferably provided to the frame 12 to shape<br>
an upper surface 96 of the panel 92. By applying vibration to the<br>
slurry, the shroud 144 facilitates the distribution of the fibers 30, 68<br>
throughout the panel 92, and provides a more uniform upper surface<br>
96. The shroud 144 includes a mounting stand 146 , a flexible sheet<br>
148 secured to the mounting stand, a stiffening member extending the<br>
width of the sheet (not shown) and a vibration generator 150<br>
preferably located on the stiffening member to cause the sheet to<br>
vibrate. Other forming devices are contemplated, as are described<br>
above and otherwise known in the art.<br><br>
An important feature of the present invention is that the<br>
panel 92 consists of multiple layers 77, 80,88, 90 which upon setting,<br>
form an integral, fiber-reinforced mass. Provided that the presence<br>
and placement of fibers in each layer are controlled by and maintained<br>
within certain desired parameters as is disclosed and described below,<br>
it will be virtually impossible to delaminate the panel 92 produced by<br>
the present process.<br>
Utilizing two discrete layers of reinforcing fibers with<br>
each individual discrete slurry layer provides the following benefits.<br>
First, splitting the total amount of fibers to be incorporated in the slurry<br>
layer into two or more discrete fiber layers reduces the respective<br>
amount of fibers in each discrete fiber layer. Reduction in the amount<br>
of fibers in the individual discrete fiber layer enhances efficiency of<br>
embedment.of fibers into the slurry layer. Improved fiber embedment<br>
efficiency in turn results in superior interfacial bond and mechanical<br>
interaction between the fibers and the cementitious matrix.<br>
Next, a greater amount of reinforcing fibers can be<br>
incorporated into each slurry layer by utilizing multiple discrete layers<br>
of reinforcing fibers. This is due to the finding that the ease of<br>
embedment of the fibers into the slurry layer has been found to<br>
depend upon the total surface area of the fibers in the discrete fiber<br>
layer. Embedment of the fibers in the slurry layer becomes<br>
increasingly difficult as the amount of fibers in the discrete fiber layer<br>
increases, causing an increase in the surface area of the fibers to be<br>
embedded in the slurry layer. It has been found that when the total<br>
surface area of the fibers in the discrete fiber layer reaches a critical<br>
value, embedment of the fibers into the slurry layers becomes almost<br>
impossible. This imposes an upper limit on the amount of fibers that<br>
can successfully be incorporated in the discrete layer of slurry. For a<br><br>
given total amount of fibers to be incorporated in the discrete slurry<br>
layer, use of multiple discrete fiber layers reduces the total surface<br>
area of the fibers in each discrete fiber layer. This reduction in the<br>
fiber surface area (brought about by the use of multiple discrete fiber<br>
layers) in turn provides an opportunity to increase the total amount of<br>
fibers that can successfully be embedded into the discrete layer of<br>
slurry.<br>
In addition, the use of multiple discrete fiber layers allows<br>
tremendous flexibility with respect to the distribution of fibers through<br>
the panel thickness. The amount of fibers in the individual discrete<br>
fiber layers may be varied to achieve desired objectives. The resulting<br>
creation of a "sandwich" construction is greatly facilitated with the<br>
presence of a larger number of discrete fiber layers. Panel<br>
configurations with fiber layers having higher amount of fibers near the<br>
panel skins and lower amount of fibers in the fiber layers near the<br>
panel core are particularly preferred from both product strength and<br>
cost optimization perspectives.<br>
In quantitative terms, the influence of the number of fiber<br>
and slurry layers, the volume fraction of fibers in the panel, and the<br>
thickness of each slurry layer, and fiber strand diameter on fiber<br>
embedment efficiency has been investigated and established as part<br>
of the present system 130. A mathematical treatment for the concept<br>
of projected fiber surface area fraction for the case involving two<br>
discrete fiber layers and one discrete slurry layer is introduced and<br>
derived below. It has been found that it is virtually impossible to<br>
embed fibers in the slurry layer if the projected fiber surface area<br>
fraction of the discrete fiber layer exceeds a value of 1.0. Although the<br>
fibers may be embedded when the projected fiber surface area<br>
fraction falls below 1.0, the best results are obtained when the<br><br>
projected fiber surface area fraction is less than 0.65. When the<br>
projected fiber surface area fraction ranges between 0.65 and 1.00,<br>
the efficiency and ease of fiber embedment varies with best fiber<br>
embedment at 0.65 and worst at 1.00. Another way of considering this<br>
fraction is that approximately 65% of a surface of the slurry is covered<br>
by fibers.<br>

To determine the projected fiber surface area fraction for<br>
a fiber layer in an arrangement of a fiber layer/slurry layer/fiber layer<br>
sandwich composed of one discrete slurry layer and two discrete fiber<br>
layers, the following relationship is derived.<br>
Let,<br>
The volume of the slurry layer be equal to vsj<br>
The volume of the fibers in the layer 1 be equal to v«<br>
The volume of the fibers in the layer 2 be equal to v^<br>
The total volume fraction of fibers in the fundamental fiber-slurry layer<br>
be equal to Vy<br>
The total thickness of the fundamental fiber-slurry layer be equal to t,<br>
The thickness of the slurry layer be equal to tsj<br>
Let,<br>
The total volume of fibers (i.e., fibers in layer 1 and layer 2) be equal to<br><br><br>
Let,<br>
The total volume of the fundamental fiber-slurry layer, vt =<br>
Total volume of slurry layer + Total volume of the two fiber<br>
layers =<br><br>
The total fiber volume of the fundamental fiber-slurry layer in terms of<br>
the total fiber volume fraction can be written as:<br><br>
Thus, the volume of fibers in the layer 1 can be written as:<br><br>
Similarly, the volume of fibers in the layer 2 can be written as:<br><br>
Assuming fibers to have cylindrical shape, the total number of fibers in<br>
the layer 1, nf1j can be derived from Equation 6 as follows:<br><br><br>
where, df is the fiber strand diameter and If is the fiber strand length<br>
Similarly, the total number of fibers in the layer 2, n^.i can be derived<br>
from Equation 7 as follows:<br><br>
The projected surface area of a cylindrical fiber is equal to the product<br>
of its length and diameter. Therefore, the total projected surface area<br>
of all fibers in layer 1, sfiP can be derived as:<br><br>
Similarly, the total projected surface area of fibers in layer 2, s/2p, can<br>
be derived as:<br><br>
The projected surface area of slurry layer, spi} can be written as:<br><br><br>
Projected fiber surface area fraction of fiber layer 1, SpfU is defined as<br>
follows:<br><br>
Combining Equations 10 and 12, the projected fiber surface area<br>
fraction of fiber layer 1, SpfU can be derived as:<br><br>
Similarly, combining Equations 11 and 12, the projected fiber surface<br>
area fraction of fiber layer 2, SP2I can be derived as:<br>
Equations 14 and 15 depict dependence of the<br>
parameter projected fiber surface area fraction, SpfU and SP2I on<br>
several other variables in addition to the variable total fiber volume<br>
fraction, v&gt;,;. These variables are diameter of fiber strand, thickness of<br>
discrete slurry layer, and the amount (proportion) of fibers in the<br>
individual discrete fiber layers.<br><br>
Experimental observations confirm that the embedment<br>
efficiency of a layer of fiber network laid over a cementitious slurry<br>
layer is a function of the parameter "projected fiber surface area<br>
fraction". It has been found that the smaller the projected fiber surface<br>
area fraction, the easier it is to embed the fiber layer into the slurry<br>
layer. The reason for good fiber embedment efficiency can be<br>
explained by the fact that the extent of open area or porosity in a layer<br>
of fiber network increases with decreases in the projected fiber surface<br>
area fraction. With more open area available, the slurry penetration<br>
through the layer of fiber network is augmented, which translates into<br>
enhanced fiber embedment efficiency.<br>
Accordingly, to achieve good fiber embedment efficiency,<br>
the objective function becomes keeping the fiber surface area fraction<br>
below a certain critical value. It is noteworthy that by varying one or<br>
more variables appearing in the Equation 15, the projected fiber<br>
surface area fraction can be tailored to achieve good fiber embedment<br>
efficiency.<br>
Different variables that affect the magnitude of projected<br>
fiber surface area fraction are identified and approaches have been<br>
suggested to tailor the magnitude of "projected fiber surface area<br>
fraction" to achieve good fiber embedment efficiency. These<br>
approaches involve varying one or more of the following variables to<br>
keep projected fiber surface area fraction below a critical threshold<br>
value: number of distinct fiber and slurry layers, thickness of distinct<br>
slurry layers and diameter of fiber strand.<br>
Based on this fundamental work, the preferred<br>
magnitudes of the projected fiber surface area fraction Spn, have been<br>
discovered to be as follows:<br><br>
Preferred projected fiber surface area fraction, Spfu	
Most preferred projected fiber surface area fraction, SFfV 
For a design panel fiber volume fraction, Vf .for example<br>
a percentage fiber volume content in each slurry layer of 1-5%,<br>
achievement of the aforementioned preferred magnitudes of projected<br>
fiber surface area fraction can be made possible by tailoring one or<br>
more of the following variables - total number of distinct fiber layers,<br>
thickness of distinct slurry layers, and fiber strand diameter. In<br>
particular, the desirable ranges for these variables that lead to the<br>
preferred magnitudes of projected fiber surface area fraction are as<br>
follows:<br>

Examples<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, a fragment of the panel 92<br>
produced according to the present process and using the present<br>
system is shown to have four slurry layers, 77, 80, 88 and 90. This<br>
panel should be considered exemplary only, in that a panel 92<br>
produced under the present system may have one or more layers. By<br>
using the above mathematical relationships, the slurry layers 77, 80,<br>
88 and 90 can have different fiber volume fractions. For example, skin<br>
or face layers 77, 90 have a designated fiber volume fraction Vf of<br>
5%, while inner layers 80, 88 have a designated Vf of 2%. This<br>
provides a panel with enhanced outer strength, and an inner core with<br>
comparatively less strength, which may be desirable in certain<br>
applications, or to conserve fibers for cost reasons. It is contemplated<br>
that the fiber volume fraction Vf may vary among the layers 77,80,<br>
88, 90 to suit the application, as can the number of layers.<br>
Also, modifications of the fiber content can be<br>
accomplished within each slurry layer. For example, with a fiber<br>
volume fraction Vf of 5%, for example, fiber layer 1 optionally has a<br>
designated slurry volume fraction of 3% and fiber layer 2 optionally<br>
has a designated fiber volume fraction of 2%. Thus, Xf will be 3/2.<br>
Panels were manufactured using the system of FIG. 6<br>
and using the above-described projected fiber surface area fraction<br>
formula. Panel thickness ranged from 0.5 to 0.82 inch (1.27-2.08cm).<br>
Individual slurry layer thicknesses ranged from 0.125 to 0.205 inch<br>
(.3175-0.5207cm). Total fiber volume fraction Vf ranged from 2.75-<br>
4.05%. In Panel 1, as described above in relation to FIG. 4, the outer<br><br>
fiber layers 1 and 8 had relatively higher volume fraction (%) as a<br>
function of total panel volume 0.75% v. 0.43% for inner layers, and the<br>
projected fiber surface area fraction ranged from 0.63 on the outer<br>
layers 1 and 8 and 0.36 on the inner layers 2 through 7. In contrast<br>
panel 4 had the same volume fraction % of 0.50 for all fiber layers, and<br>
a similarly constant projected fiber surface area fraction of 0.42 for all<br>
fiber layers. It was found that all of the test panels had excellent fiber<br>
embedment. Interestingly, panel 1, had only a slightly lower flexural<br>
strength than panel 4, respectively 3401/3634 psi.<br>
In the present system 130, by increasing the number of<br>
fiber layers, each with its own fiber surface area fraction, more fibers<br>
can be added to each slurry layer without requiring as many layers of<br>
slurry. Using the above process, the panel 92 can have the same<br>
thickness as prior panels, with the same number of fibers of the same<br>
diameter, with fewer number of slurry layers. Thus, the resulting panel<br>
92 has layers of enhanced strength but is less expensive to produce,<br>
due to a shorter production line using less energy and capital<br>
equipment.<br>
While a particular embodiment of the multi-layer process<br>
for producing high strength fiber-reinforced structural cement panels<br>
having enhanced fiber content has been shown and described, it will<br>
be appreciated by those skilled in the art that changes and<br>
modifications may be made thereto without departing from the<br>
invention in its broader aspects and as set forth in the following claims.<br><br>
What is claimed is:<br>
