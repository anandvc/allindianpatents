				<td>MULTI-LAYER MQNOFILAMENT AND PROCESS FOR MANUFACTURING A<br>
MULTI-LAYER MONOFILAMENT<br>
The invention relates to a multi-layer monofilament. The<br>
invention further relates to a method for manufacturing<br>
such a multi-layer monofilament.<br>
The principle of manufacturing or spinning two-layer<br>
monofilaments or bicomponent filaments from two different<br>
thermoplastic plastics is known. In this way, monofilaments<br>
receive their corresponding properties, which cannot be<br>
achieved in one plastic alone. It is known to produce these<br>
monofilaments from two layers either in a side-by-side<br>
arrangement or in a core/sheet arrangement. Many<br>
bicomponent filaments, particularly those with a core/sheet<br>
structure, have the disadvantage that the adhesion between<br>
the two layers (core and sheet) is inadequate and they can<br>
therefore easily delaminate. Particularly when these<br>
monofilaments are stretched, it often happens that the<br>
sheet layer peels away from the core like an onionskin.<br>
These problems occur in many plastic pairs.<br>
In view of this, the technical problem underlying the<br>
invention was to suggest a multi-layer monofilament of the<br>
type described in the introduction, which does not suffer<br>
from the problems explained above and in which the<br>
individual layers are adequately bonded with each other.<br>
In order to solve this technical problem, the invention<br>
proposes a multi-layer monofilament consisting of multiple<br>
layers that are extruded or spun simultaneously in a single<br>
process step, having a first layer made from plastic A, a<br>
second layer, which is bonded directly to the first layer,<br>
made from plastic B, and a third layer, which is bonded<br>
directly to the second layer, made from plastic C, plastic<br>
B being a bonding agent between the two plastics A and C.<br><br>
Multiple layers are said to be simultaneously extruded or<br>
spun in particular when the liquefied plastics intended for<br>
use in the multiple layers of the monofilament are ejected<br>
from the same spinning orifice or spinning device together,<br>
thereby creating the multi-layer monofilament. A spinning<br>
device of such kind is normally equipped with multiple<br>
spinning orifices. - For the purpose of the invention, a<br>
bonding agent is a plastic that serves to improve the<br>
adhesive bond between two plastics to be bonded.<br>
The scope of the invention applies expressly to multiple-<br>
layer monofilaments including only three layers. Thus the<br>
object of the invention is preferably a three-layer<br>
monofilament. - A highly advantageous embodiment, to which<br>
particular importance attaches within the scope of the<br>
invention, is characterised in that the monofilament has a<br>
core/sheet structure, wherein the core of the monofilament<br>
is formed by plastic A, wherein this core is at least<br>
partly enclosed by the second layer consisting of plastic<br>
B, and wherein the second layer consisting of plastic B is<br>
at least partly enclosed by the third layer consisting of<br>
plastic C. In this core/sheet structure, the core<br>
consisting of plastic A is thus equivalent to the first<br>
layer consisting of plastic A. For practical reasons, the<br>
core has a circular or elliptical cross-section. The scope<br>
of the invention expressly includes the fact that the core<br>
is fully enclosed by the second layer consisting of plastic<br>
B, and that it preferably has a circular cross-section.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the second layer<br>
consisting of plastic B is entirely enclosed by the third<br>
layer consisting of plastic C and that it has a circular<br>
cross-section for practical purposes. - In all cases, the<br>
scope of the invention expressly includes the fact that a<br>
multi-layer monofilament according to the invention has a<br>
side-by-side structure.<br><br>
According to one particularly preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, plastic B, i.e. the adhesive agent, is an<br>
ethylene-vinylacetate copolymer and/or a methylacrylate<br>
copolymer.<br>
Preferably, one of the two layers to be bonded by means of<br>
plastic B, i.e. by means of the bonding agent, i.e. the<br>
first layer consisting of plastic A or the third layer<br>
consisting of layer C, is made from at least one plastic<br>
from the group "polyethylene terephthalate (PET), polyamide<br>
(PA) , polyamide copolymer, polypropylene (PP)". The scope<br>
of the invention expressly includes the fact that a<br>
polyamide 6 and/or polyamide 6.6 and/or polyamide 6.12 is<br>
used as the polyamide. According to a preferred embodiment<br>
of the invention, the other of the two layers to be bonded<br>
by means of plastic B, i.e. by means of the bonding agent,<br>
i.e. the first layer consisting of plastic A or the third<br>
layer consisting of layer C, is made from at least one<br>
plastic from the group "polyethylene (PE), polyoxymethylene<br>
(POM), polyphenylene sulphide (PPS), polymethylmethacrylate<br>
(PMMA), polybutylene terephthalate (PBT), polyvinyl<br>
chloride (PVC), polyether etherketone (PEEK), polyethylene<br>
naphthalate (PEN)".<br>
Furthermore, the object of the invention is a process for<br>
manufacturing a multi-layer monofilament, the monofilaments<br>
being produced by means of a spinning device having a<br>
plurality of spinning orifices,<br>
wherein one liquefied plastic for each layer of the<br>
monofilament is directed to the respective spinning orifice<br>
and wherein the liquefied plastics for various layers are<br>
ejected from the spinning orifice together, thereby forming<br>
a single multi-layer monofilament.<br><br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, a multi-layer monofilament having a core/sheet<br>
structure is produced,<br>
wherein the liquefied plastic of plastic A is directed to<br>
each spinning orifice via a feeding channel provided<br>
centrally over the spinning orifice to form the core of the<br>
monofilament,<br>
wherein the liquefied plastic of plastic B (bonding agent)<br>
is directed to form an inner sheet via an inner feeding<br>
slit encircling the feeding channel in annular manner<br>
and wherein the liquefied plastic of plastic C is directed<br>
to form an outer sheet via an outer feeding slit encircling<br>
the inner, annular feeding slit. The scope of the invention<br>
expressly provides for the fact that the inner and/or the<br>
outer feeding slits is/are feeding slits that encircle the<br>
feeding channel in annular manner.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the<br>
invention, the multi-layer monofilaments are stretched<br>
after spinning. Stretching is advantageously done in one to<br>
three stages. Stretching may take place in air, or in steam<br>
or in water.<br>
The multi-layer monofilaments are preferably fixed<br>
following the stretching. In this case, fixing means that<br>
the multi-layer monofilaments are heated, specifically to a<br>
temperature above 20°C, preferably above 25°C. Fixing may<br>
also take place in one to three stages and is preferably<br>
done in air or in steam or in water.<br>
The invention is based on the realization that the layers<br>
of the multi-layer monofilaments according to the invention<br>
adhere to each other surprisingly strongly. When these<br>
multi-layer monofilaments are stretched, the layers do not<br><br>
delaminate. In addition, the multi-layer monofilaments<br>
according to the invention may be manufactured relatively<br>
simply and inexpensively.<br>
The invention will be described in detail with reference to<br>
a Ricon Paying drawing illustrating just one embodiment of the<br>
invention. The single figure shows a cross-section through<br>
a multi-layer monofilament according to the invention.<br>
In the embodiment according to the figure, the multi-layer<br>
monofilament is formed as a three-layer monofilament<br>
specifically having a core/sheet structure. Core 1 here<br>
corresponds to the first layer of the multi-layer<br>
monofilament made from plastic A. Preferably and in the<br>
embodiment, core 1 has a circular cross-section. In the<br>
embodiment shown in the figure, this core 1 is surrounded<br>
by an inner sheet 2, which corresponds to the second layer<br>
consisting of plastic B, i.e. the bonding agent. Inner<br>
sheet 2 surrounds core 1 in annular manner. This inner<br>
sheet 2 is in turn surrounded by an outer sheet 3, which<br>
corresponds to the third layer consisting of plastic C.<br>
This outer sheet 3 surrounds inner sheet 2 consisting of<br>
plastic B in annular manner. In the embodiment, inner sheet<br>
2 may consist of ethylene vinylacetate copolymer as a<br>
bonding agent.<br><br><br>
