COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10; rule 13]<br>
"A COMPOUND 2-AMINO-THIAZOLE-5-CARBOXAMIDE"<br>
BRISTOL-MYERS SQUIBB COMPANY, a Delaware corporation of P.O. Box 4000, Princeton, New Jersey 08543-4000, United States of America,<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br>
1 1 SEP 2006<br><br><br>
The   present   invention   relates   to   a   compound   2-amino-thiazole-5-carboxamide.<br>
The present invention relates to cyclic compounds and salts thereof, to methods of using such compounds in treating protein tyrosine kinase-associated disorders such as immunologic and oncologic disorders, and to pharmaceutical compositions containing such compounds.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Protein tyrosine kinases (PTKs) are enzymes which, in conjuction with ATP as a substrate, phosphorylate tyrosine residues in peptides and proteins. These enzymes are key elements in the regulation of cell  signalingincluding cell proliferation and cell differentiation. PTKs comprise, inter alia, receptor tyrosine kinases (RPTKs), including members of the epidermal growth factor kinase family (e.g., HER1 and HER2), platelet derived growth factor (PDGF), and kinases that play a role in angiogenesis (Tie-2 and KDR); and, in addition, non-receptor tyrosine kinases, including members of the Syk, JAK. and Src (e.g. Src, Fyn, Lyn, Lck and Blk) families (see Bolen, J.B., Rowley, R.B., Spana, C, and Tsygankov, A.Y., "The src family of tyrosine protein kinases in hemopoietic signal transduction", FASEB J., 6, 3403-3409 (1992); Ullrich, A. and Schlessinger, J., "Signal transduction by receptors with tyrosine kinase activity", Cell, 61, 203-212 (1990); and Ihle, J.N,, "The Janus protein tyrosine kinases in hematopoetic cytokine signaling", Sem, Immunol, 7, 247-254 (1995)).<br><br>
Enhanced activity of PTKs has been implicated in a variety of malignant and nonmalignant proliferative diseases. In addition, PTKs play a central role in the regulation of cells of the immune system. PTK inhibitors can thus impact a wide variety of oncologic and immunologic disorders. Such disorders may be ameliorated by selective inhibition of a certain receptor or non-receptor PTK, such as Lck, or due to the homology among PTK classes, by inhibition of more than one PTK by an inhibitor.<br>
A PTK of particular interest is Lck which is found in T cells where it is involved in phosphorylating key protein substrates. It is required for productive antigen receptor signaling and cell activation. In the absence of Lck activity, the T cell receptor (TCR) zeta chain is not phosphorylated, the kinase ZAP-70 is not activated, and Ca2+ mobilization essential for T cell activation does not occur (see Weiss, A. and Littman, D.R., "Signal transduction by lymphocyte antigen receptors", Cell, 76, 263-274 (1994); Iwashima, M., Irving, B.A., van Oers, N.S.C., Chan, A.C., and Weiss, A., "Sequential interactions of the TCR with two distinct cytoplasmic tyrosine kinases", Science, 263, 1136-1139 (1994); and Chan, A.C., Dalton, M., Johnson, R., Kong, G., Wang, T., Thoma, R., and Kurosaki, T., "Activation of ZAP-70 kinase activity by phosphorylation of tyrosine 493 is required for lymphocyte antigen receptor function", EMBO J., 14, 2499-2508 (1995)). Inhibitors of Lck are thus useful in the treatment of T-cell mediated disorders such as chronic diseases with an important T cell component, for example rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis and lupus, as well as acute diseases where T cells are known to play an       essential role, for example acute transplant rejection and delayed-type hypersensitivity (DTH) reactions.<br><br><br>

Scheme A illustrates a general method for forming compound la, which is a compound of the formula I where X1 and X2 together form =0. As shown in Scheme A, compound la where R2 and R3 are hydrogen may be formed by saponification of i , (R* is a carboxyl protecting group such as alkyl or arylalkyl) followed by reaction with amine iii by methods known in the art. Alternatively ! may be reacted with R2L, where L is a leaving group such as halogen (for example, in equimolar portions), optionally followed by reaction with R3L (for example, in equimolar portions) to form ii. Also alternatively, i may be subjected to reductive animation using the appropriate aldehyde or ketone to form ii. The compound ii may then be saponified and reacted with amine iii, under conditions known to those skilled in the art, to form Ia where R2 and/or R3 are other than hydrogen.<br>

Scheme B illustrates a general method for forming compound Ib, which is a compound of formula I where Z is -CH=CH- and X1 and X2 together form =0. As shown in Scheme B, a 2-halo-compound vi can be prepared by reacting an appropriately substituted 2-amino-compound ia with copper (ii) halide and an alkyl nitrite such as tert-butyl nitrite in an aprotic solvent such as acetonitrile to form 2-halo-compound iv (see J.

Compound v can be reacted with an alkyl(triphenylphosphorylidene) acetate to form carboxylate vi. Compound vi can be saponified and then reacted with an amine iii by methods known to those skilled in the art to form yii. Compound yii can be reacted with an amine R2R3NH to form lb where Z is -CH=CH- and X1, X2 together form =0. Alternatively, compounds of formula lb where R2 and R3 are H, can be formed by reacting compound yii with an appropriately substituted benzyl amine such as 4-methoxybenzyl amine to form compound ix, which can be hydrogenolyzed or treated with an acid such as trifluoromethanesulfonic acid and trifluoroacetic acid in the presence of anisole to form lb where R2 and R3 are hydrogen.<br>

Compound xi may be reacted with an<br>
alkyl(triphenylphosphorylidene)acetate, followed by deprotection of the carbamate protecting group to form xii. Alternatively, compound Ic where R2 and R3 are hydrogen may be formed by saponification of xii followed by reaction with an amine R4R5NH by methods known to those skilled in the art.

Methods for preparing preferred substituents on the compounds I are illustrated in the following Schemes I to XI.<br><br>
Scheme I<br><br><br>
As shown in Scheme I, carboxylate i can be reacted with a chloroformate or dicarbonate to form 1. Compound 1 can be treated with a base such as sodium hydride, sodium/potassium hexamethyldisilazide, or lithium diisopropylamide (LDA), and an alkylating agent R2X where X is halogen and R2 is preferably alkyl, arylalkyl, or cycloalkylalkyl, and then saponified with an aqueous base such as potassium hydroxide to give 2. Alternatively, 1 can the subjected to reductive amination using the appropriate aldehyde or ketone and saponified with an aqueous base such as potassium hydroxide to give 2. Compound X may, alternatively, be simply saponified with an aqueous base such as potassium hydroxide to give 3 where R2 is hydrogen.<br>
Acid 2 may be reacted with an amine iii using reaction conditions well known in the art for peptide bond synthesis (see, for example, Bodanszky and Bodanszky, The Practice of Peptide Chemistry, Springer-Verlag, 1984; Bodanszky, Principles of Peptide Synthesis, Springer-Verlag, 1984) to give the compound Id which a compound of the formula I where X1 and X2 together form =0, R3 is COOR6, and, since 2 is the starting material, R2 is preferably alkyl, arylalkyl or cycloalkylalkyl. For example, reagents which activate the carboxyl group of 2 for reaction with the amine iv include bis-(2-oxo-3-oxazolidinyl)phosphinic chloride (BOP chloride), benzotriazol-l-yloxy-tris(dimethylamino)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (BOP reagent), [0-(7-azabenzotriazol-l-yl)-l,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium] hexafluorophosphate (HATU), and carbodiimides such as dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or 3-ethyl-3"-(dimethylamino)propylcarbodiimide (EDCI) either alone or in combination with a hydroxybenzotriazole. Alternatively, the activated ester intermediate can be isolated and then treated with the appropriate amine iv in a nonprotic solvent such as tetrahydrofuran (THF) or dimethylformamide (DMF) in the presence of a base, for example, an organic base such as sodium/potassium hexamethyldisilazide, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine or 1,8-diazabicyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-<br><br>
 ene (DBU), or an inorganic base such as sodium, potassium or cesium carbonate or sodium or potassium hydride. Alternatively, the acid halide of 2 may be prepared, for example, by reaction with thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride, followed by subsequent reaction with amine iii to provide compound If, which is a compound of the formula I where R3 is COOR6, X1 and X2 together form =0, and R2 is alkyl, arylalkyl or chycloalkylalkyl.<br>
Similar reactions as employed above for the conv on of 2 to If may be used to convert 3 to If where R3 is COOR6, X1 and X2 together form =0, and R2 is hydrogen.<br><br>
As shown in Scheme II, acid 4 where R2 and R3 are not hydrogen and are selected such that the nitrogen to which they are attached is non-basic, is reduced to the aldehyde 5 by methods well know in the art (see March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley, 1985). For example, the acid 4 may be converted to its corresponding ester followed by reduction with diisobutylaluminum hydride. Alternatively, the acid 4 may be reduced to the corresponding primary alcohol, for example, by treatment with borane/THF, LiAlH4, or via reduction of a mixed anhydride, followed by subsequent oxidation to the aldehyde 5 using Cr(VI) (e.g., pyridinium chlorochromate, "PCC") or under Swern or Moffatt conditions (e.g., (COCD/dimethylsulfoxide). The starting acid 4 may be obtained, for example, by saponification of ii.<br>
Reductive amination (see Hudlicky, Reductions in Organic Chemistry, Wiley, 1984) of aldehyde 5 with amine iii in the presence of a reducing agent such as NaBH3CN, NaBH(OAc)3 (Ac = acetyl) or hydrogen and a palladium catalyst produces the amine compound Ig, which is a compound of the formula I where X1 and X2 are each hydrogen and R2 and R3 are each not hydrogen.<br><br><br>
Scheme HI<br><br>
As shown in Scheme III, reduction of the acid 4 to a primary alcohol (for example, by treatment with borane/tetrahydrofuran, LiAlH4, or via reduction of a mixed anhydride), followed by conversion by methods well known in the art (see March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, Wiley, 1985), provides 6 which contains a leaving group such as a halide, tosylate (OTs), mesylate (OMs) or triflate (OTf). The groups R2 and R3 are selected such that the resulting nitrogen to which they are attached is non-basic. Compound 6 can then be converted into compound Ih, which is a compound of the formula I where X1 and X2 are each hydrogen and R2 and R3 are each not hydrogen, by a displacement reaction with amine iii, preferably where amine iii is used in excess.<br><br><br><br>
Scheme IV illustrates methods which may be used for the preparation of compounds Ij, Ik, II, Im and In. Ij, Ik, II, Im and In are compounds of the formula I where R2 is any group as defined, R3 is an acyl or thioacyl group, X1 and X2 are not hydrogen, and R1 is not a primary or secondary amine. Ij, Ik, II, Im and In have other particular substituents which are specified in this Scheme and below. The starting compound li can be prepared by suitable methods described in Scheme      and D.<br>

Alternatively, the acid halide 8 may be reacted with amine compound li in the presence of an acid scavenger such as diisopropylethylamine. The corresponding thioamide Ik can be prepared by the treatment of amide Ii (where X1, X2= O) with Lawesson"s reagent as described above.<br>
Carbamate II can be prepared by treatment of amine compound Ii with a chloroformate 9 or dicarbonate 10 in the presence of an acid scavenger such as diisopropylethylamine.<br>
The urea Im may be prepared by treatment of amine compound Ii with either: 1) a chloroformate 9, such as phenylchloroformate, followed by reaction with an amine 11; 2) a carbamoyl chloride 12 in the presence of an acid scavenger such as diisopropylethylamine; or 3) reaction with an isocyanate 13a (where Rc in Im = H). The corresponding thiourea In may be prepared by treatment of amine compound Ii with a thioisocyanate 13b.<br>
Ra is selected from those groups included in the definition of R6 such that the group -C(=A)-Ra is an acyl or thioacyl group within the definition of R3. Rb and Rc are selected from those groups included in the definitions of R7 and R8, such that the group -C(=A)-N(Rb)(Rc) is an acyl or thioacyl group within the definition of R3.<br><br>

Utility The compounds of the present invention inhibit protein tyrosine kinases, especially Src-family kinases such as Lck, Fyn, Lyn, Src, Yes, Hck, Fgr and Blk, and are thus useful in the treatment, including prevention and therapy, of protein tyrosine kinase-associated disorders such as immunologic and oncologic disorders. The compounds inhibit also receptor tyrosine kinases including HER1 and HER2 and are therefore useful in the treatment of proliferative disorders such as psoriasis and cancer. The ability of these compounds to inhibit HER1 and other receptor kinases will also permit their use as anti-angiogenic agents to treat disorders such as cancer and diabetic retinopathy. "Protein tyrosine kinase-associated disorders" are those disorders which result from aberrant tyrosine kinase activity, and/or which are alleviated by the inhibition of one or more of these enzymes. For example, Lck inhibitors are of value in the treatment of a number of such disorders (for example, the treatment of autoimmune diseases), as Lck inhibition blocks T cell<br><br><br>
activation. The treatment of T cell mediated diseases, including inhibition of T cell activation and proliferation, is a particularly preferred embodiment of the present invention. Compounds which selectively block T cell activation and proliferation are preferred. Compounds of the present invention which block the activation of endothelial cell PTK by oxidative stress, thereby limiting surface expression of adhesion molecules that induce neutrophil binding, and which inhibit PTK necessary for neutrophil activation are useful, for example, in the treatment of ischemia and reperfusion injury.<br>
The present invention thus provides methods for the treatment of protein tyrosine kinase-associated disorders, comprising the step of administering to a subject in need thereof at least one compound of the formula I in an amount effective therefor. Other therapeutic agents such as those described below may be employed with the inventive compounds in the present methods. In the methods of the present invention, such other therapeutic agent(s) may be administered prior to, simultaneously with or following the administration of the compound(s) of the present invention.<br>
Use of the compounds of the present invention in treating protein tyrosine kinase-associated disorders is exemplified by, but is not limited to, treating a range of disorders such as: transplant (such as organ transplant, acute transplant or heterograft or homograft (such as is employed in burn treatment)) rejection; protection from ischemic or reperfusion injury such as ischemic or reperfusion injury incurred during organ transplantation, myocardial infarction, stroke or other causes; transplantation tolerance induction; arthritis (such as rheumatoid arthritis,  riatic arthritis or osteoarthritis); multiple sclerosis; chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), such as emphysema; inflammatory bowel disease, including ulcerative colitis and Crohn"s disease; lupus (systemic lupus erythematosis); graft vs. host disease; T-cell mediated hypersensitivity diseases, including contact hypersensitivity,<br><br>
delayed-type hypersensitivity, and gluten-sensitive enteropathy (Celiac disease); psoriasis; contact dermatitis (including that due to poison ivy); Hashimoto"s thyroiditis; Sjogren"s syndrome; Autoimmune Hyperthyroidism, such as Graves" Disease; Addison"s disease (autoimmune disease of the adrenal glands); Autoimmune polyglandular disease (also known as autoimmune polyglandular syndrome); autoimmune alopecia; pernicious anemia; vitiligo; autoimmune hypopituatarism; Guillain-Barre syndrome; other autoimmune diseases; cancers, including cancers where Lck or other Src-family kinases such as Src are activated or overexpressed, such as colon carcinoma and thymoma, and cancers where Src-family kinase activity facilitates tumor growth or survival; glomerulonephritis; serum sickness; uticaria; allergic diseases such as respiratory allergies (asthma, hayfever, allergic rhinitis) or skin allergies; scleracierma; mycosis fungoides; acute inflammatory responses (such as acute respiratory distress syndrome and ishchemia/reperfusion injury); dermatomyositis; alopecia areata; chronic actinic dermatitis; eczema; Behcet"s disease; Pustulosis palmoplanteris; Pyoderma gangrenum; Sezary"s syndrome; atopic dermatitis; systemic schlerosis; and morphea. The present invention also provides a method for treating the aforementioned disorders such as atopic dermatitis by administration of any compound capable of inhibiting protein tyrosine kinase.<br>
Src-family kinases other than Lck, such as Hck and Fgr, are important in the Fc gamma receptor responses of monocytes and macrophages. Compounds of the present invention inhibit the Fc gamma dependent production of TNF alpha in the monocyte cell line THP-1 that does not express Lck. The ability to inhibit Fc gamma receptor dependent monocyte and macrophage responses results in additional anti¬inflammatory activity for the present compounds beyond their effects on T cells. This activity is especially of value, for example, in the treatment of inflammatory diseases such as arthritis or inflammatory bowel disease. In particular, the present compounds are of value for the treatment of<br><br><br>
autoimmune glomerulonephritis and other instances of glomerulonephritis induced by deposition of immune complexes in the kidney that trigger Fc gamma receptor responses leading to kidney damage.<br>
In addition, Src family kinases other than Lck, such as Lyn and Src, are important in the Fc epsilon receptor induced degranulation of mast cells and basophils that plays an important role in asthma, allergic rhinitis, and other allergic disease. Fc epsilon receptors are stimulated by IgE-antigen complexes. Compounds of the present invention inhibit the Fc epsilon induced degranulation responses, including in the basophil cell line RBL that does not express Lck. The ability to inhibit Fc epsilon receptor dependent mast cell and basophil responses results in additional anti-inflammatory activity for the present compounds beyond their effect on T cells. In particular, the present compounds are of value for the treatment of asthma, allergic rhinitis, and other instances of allergic disease.<br>
The combined activity of the present compounds towards monocytes, macrophages, T cells, etc. may be of value in the treatment of any of the aforementioned disorders.<br>
In a particular embodiment, the compounds of the present invention are useful for the treatment of the aforementioned exemplary disorders irrespective of their etiology, for example, for the treatment of transplant rejection, rheumatoid arthritis, multiple sclerosis, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, inflammatory bowel disease, lupus, graft v. host disease, T-cell mediated hypersensitivity disease, psoriasis, Hashimoto"s thyroiditis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, cancer, contact dermatitis, allergic disease such as allergic rhinitis, asthma, ischemic or reperfusion injury, or atopic dermatitis whether or not associated with PTK<br>
By virtue of their ability to inhibit HER1 and HER2 kinases, compounds of the present invention can also be used for the treatment of<br><br><br>
proliferative diseases, including psoriasis and cancer. The HERl receptor kinase has been shown to be expressed and activated in many solid tumors including non-small cell lung, colorectal, and breast cancer, Similarly, the HER2 receptor kinase has been shown to be overexpressed in breast, ovarian, lung and gastric cancer. Monoclonal antibodies that downregulate the abundance of the HER2 receptor or inhibit signaling by the HERl receptor have shown anti-tumor effficacy in preclincal and clinical studies. It is therefore expected that inhibitors of the HERl and HER2 kinases will have efficacy in the treatment of tumors that depend on signaling from either of the two receptors. These compounds are expected to have efficacy either as single agent or in combination with other chemotherapeutic agents such as placlitaxel (Taxol), doxorubicin hydrochloride (adriamycin), and cisplatin (Platinol).

J., "Multinational study of the efficacy and safety of humanized anti-HER2 monoclonal antibody in women who have HER2-overexpressing metastatic breast cancer that has progressed after chemotherapy for metastatic disease", J. of Clin. Oncol. 17(9), p. 2639-2648 (1999); Baselga, J., Pfister, D., Cooper, M.

The following assays can be employed in ascertaining the degree of activity of a compound ("test compound") as a PTK inhibitor.<br><br><br>
Compounds described in the following Examples have been tested in one or more of these assays, and have shown activity.<br>
Enzyme Assay Using Lck, Fyn, Lyn, Hck, Fgr, Src, Blk or Yes<br>
The following assay has been carried out using the protein tyrosine kinases Lck, Fyn, Lyn, HcK, Fgr, Src, Blk and Yes.<br>
The protein tyrosine kinase of interest is incubated in kinase buffer (20 mM MOPS, pH7, 10 mM MgCl2) in the presence of the test compound. The reaction is initiated by the addition of substrates to the final concentration of 1 uM ATP, 3.3 uCi/ml [33P] gamma-ATP, and 0.1 mg/ml acid denatured enolase (prepared as described in Cooper, J.A., Esch, F.S., Taylor, S.S., and Hunter, T., "Phosphorylation sites in enolase and lactate dehydrogenase utilized by tyrosine protein kinases in vivo and in vitro", J. Biol Chem.,259, 7835-7841 (1984)). The reaction is stopped after 10 minutes by the addition of 10% trichloroacetic acid, 100 mM sodium pyrophosphate followed by 2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin. The labeled enolase protein substrate is precipitated at 4 degrees, harvested onto Packard Unifilter plates and counted in a Topcount scintillation counter to ascertain the protein tyrosine kinase inhibitory activity of the test compound (activity inversely proportional to the amount of labeled enolase protein obtained). The exact concentration of reagents and the amount of label can be varied as needed.<br>
This assay is advantageous as it employs an exogenous substrate (enolase) for more accurate enzyme kinetics, and can be conducted in a 96-well format that is readily automated. In addition, His-tagged protein tyrosine kinases (described below) offer much higher production yields and purity rela  e to GST-protein tyrosine kinase fusion protein.<br>
The protein tyrosine kinase may be obtained from commercial sources or by recombinant methods described herewith. For the preparation of recombinant Lck, human Lck was prepared as a His-tagged fusion protein using the Life Technologies (Gibco) baculovirus vector<br><br><br>
pFastBac Hta (commercially available) in insect cells. A cDNA encoding human Lck isolated by PCR (polymerase chain reaction) was inserted into the vector and the protein was expressed using the methods described by the manufacturer. The Lck was purified by affinity chromatography. For the production of Lck in insect cells using baculovirus, see Spana, C, O"Rourke, E.C., Bolen, J.B., and Fargnoli, J., "Analysis of the tyrosine kinase p561ck expressed as a glutathione S-transferase protein in Spodoptera frugiperda cells," Protein expression and purification, Vol. 4, p. 390-397 (1993). Similar methods may be used for the recombinant production of other Src-family kinases. Enzyme Assay Using HERl or HER2<br>
Compounds of interest were assayed in a kinase buffer that contained 20 mM Tris.HCl, pH 7.5, 10 mM MnCl2, 0.5 mM dithiothreitol, bovine serum albumin at 0.1 mg/ml, poly(glu/tyr, 4:1) at 0.1 mg/ml, 1uM ATP, and 4 μCi/ml [gamma-33P]ATP. Poly(glu/tyr, 4:1) is a synthetic polymer that serves as a phosphoryl acceptor and is purchased from Sigma Chemicals. The kinase reaction is initiated by the addition of enzyme and the reaction mixtures were incubated at 26°C for 1 h. The reaction is terminated by the addition of EDTA to 50 mM and proteins are precipitated by the addition of trichloroacetic acid to 5%. The precipitated proteins are recovered by filtration onto Packard Unifilter plates and the amount of radioactivity incorporated is measured in a Topcount scintillation counter.<br>
For the preparation of recombinant HERl, the cytoplasmic sequence of the receptor were expressed in insect cells as a GST fusion protein, which was purified by affinity chromatography as described above for Lck. The cytoplasmic sequence of HER2 was subcloned into the baculovirus expression vector pBlueBac4 (Invitrogen) and was expressed as an untagged protein in insect cells. The recombinant protein was partially purified by ion-exchange chromatography.<br><br>
Cell assays<br>
(1)	Cellular tyrosine phosphorylation<br>
Jurkat T cells are incubated with the test compound and then stimulated by the addition of antibody to CD3 (monoclonal antibody G19-4). Cells are lysed after 4 minutes or at another desired time by the addition of a lysis buffer containing NP-40 detergent. Phosphorylation of proteins is detected by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Detection of phosphorylation of specific proteins of interest such as ZAP-70 is detected by immunoprecipitation with anti-ZAP-70 antibody followed by anti-phosphotyrosine immunoblotting. Such procedures are described in Schieven, G.L., Mittler, R.S., Nadler, S.G., Kirihara, J.M., Bolen, J.B., Kanner, S.B., and Ledbetter, J.A., "ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase, CD45 and T cell receptor involvement in UV and H202 induced T cell signal transduction", J. Biol. Chem., 269, 20718-20726 (1994), and the references incorporated therein. The Lck inhibitors inhibit the tyrosine phosphorylation of cellular proteins induced by anti-CD3 antibodies.<br>
For the preparation of G19-4, see Hansen, J.A., Martin, P.J., Beatty, P.G., Clark, E.A., and Ledbetter, J.A., "Human T lymphocyte cell surface molecules defined by the workshop monoclonal antibodies," in Leukocyte Typing I, A. Bernard, J. Boumsell, J. Dausett, C. Milstein, and S. Schlossman, eds. (New York: Springer Verlag), p. 195-212 (1984); and Ledbetter, J.A., June, C.H., Rabinovitch, P.S., Grossman, A., Tsu, T.T., and Imboden, J.B., "Signal transduction through CD4 receptors: stimulatory vs. inhibitory activity is regulated by CD4 proximity to the CD3/T cell receptor" Eur. J. Immunol., 18, 525 (1988).<br>
(2)	Calcium assay<br>
Lck inhibitors block calcium mobilization in T cells stimulated with anti-CD3 antibodies. Cells are loaded with the calcium indicator dye indo-1, treated with anti-CD3 antibody such as the monoclonal antibody G19-4, and calcium mobilization is measured using flow cytometry by recording<br><br>
changes in the blue/violet indo-1 ratio as described in Schieven, G.L., Mittler, R.S., Nadler, S.G., Kirihara, J.M., Bolen, J.B., Kanner, S.B., and Ledbetter, J.A., "ZAP-70 tyrosine kinase, CD45 and T cell receptor involvement in UV and H202 induced T cell signal transduction", J. Biol. Chem., 269, 20718-20726 (1994), and the references incorporated therein.<br>
(3)      Proliferation assays<br>
Lck inhibitors inhibit the proliferation of normal human peripheral blood T cells stimulated to grow with anti-CD3 plus anti-CD28 antibodies. A 96 well plate is coated with a monoclonal antibody to CD3 (such as G19-4), the antibody is allowed to bind, and then the plate is washed. The antibody bound to the plate serves to stimulate the cells. Normal human peripheral blood T cells are added to the wells along with test compound plus anti-CD28 antibody to provide co-stimulation. After a desired period of time (e.g., 3 days), the [3H]-thymidine is added to the cells, and after further incubation to allow incorporation of the label into newly synthesized DNA, the cells are harvested and counted in a scintillation counter to measure cell proliferation.<br>
