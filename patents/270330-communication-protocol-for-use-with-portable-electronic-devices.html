				<td>COMMUNICATION PROTOCOL FOR USE WITH PORTABLE<br>
ELECTRONIC DEVICES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] The present invention relates to electrical devices and, more particularly, to<br>
electrical devices, such as media players, that communicate with external devices.<br>
Description of the Related Art.<br>
[0002] A media player stores media assets, such as audio tracks, that can be played or<br>
displayed on the media player. One example of a portable media player is the iPod®<br>
media player, which is available from Apple Inc. of Cupertino, CA. Often a media<br>
player acquires its media assets from a host computer that serves to enable a user to<br>
manage media assets. The host computer can execute a media management<br>
application to acquire and manage media assets. One example of a media<br>
management application is iTunes® produced by Apple Inc.<br>
[0003] Portable media players, such as MP3 players, are able to play music for users<br>
often via earphones or a headset A portable media player typically includes one or<br>
more connectors or ports that can be used to interface to the portable media player.<br>
For example, the connector or port can enable the portable media player to couple to a<br>
host computer, be inserted into a docking system, or receive an accessory device.<br>
Typically, portable media players are dedicated to playing media. However, there<br>
exist today various different types of accessory devices that can be coupled to<br>
portable media players. For example, a remote control can be connected to the<br>
connector or port to allow the user to remotely control the portable media player. As<br>
another example, an automobile can include a connector and the portable media<br>
player can be inserted onto the connector such mat an automobile media system can<br>
interact with the portable media player. As still another example, a microphone<br>
accessory device can be connected to a portable media player to enable voice<br>
recording. Yet still another example is a FM radio controller accessory that includes a<br>
FM tuner and a controller. Still yet another example is a camera connector that<br>
connects to a portable media player as well as a camera (via USB) and serves to<br>
facilitate transfer of images from the camera to the portable media player.<br><br>
[0004] Currently, portable media players can interact with attached accessories in<br>
limited ways. However, as accessories become more complex and/or more integrated<br>
with operation of portable media players, more sophisticated interaction with<br>
accessories is required. Thus, there is a need for improved techniques to enable portable media players to communicate with accessory devices in accordance with a<br>
controlled protocol.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0020] The invention relates to improved techniques for communicating between a<br>
portable electronic device and an accessory (or auxiliary) device. The accessory<br>
device can augment or supplement the functionality or capabilities of the portable<br>
electronic device. For example, in one embodiment, the accessory device can provide<br>
wireless communication capabilities to the portable electronic device. In one<br>
embodiment, the portable electronic device pertains to a portable media player and<br>
thus provide media data for storage, playback or transmission. In one embodiment,<br>
the accessory device is attachable to the portable electronic device.<br>
[0021] The invention is particularly well suited for use in monitoring physiological<br>
data, such as exercise data (e.g., run data). In one embodiment, an accessory device<br>
couples to a portable electronic device and receives physiological data from a remote<br>
sensor in a wireless manner. The portable electronic device can then communicate<br>
with the accessory device to acquire the physiological data from the accessory device.<br>
Thereafter, the portable electronic device can store, process and/or display<br>
physiological related information. The physiological monitoring is normally of a<br>
person, who is typically the user of the portable electronic device.<br>
[0022] Embodiments of the invention are discussed below with reference to FIGs. 1 -<br>
6D. However, those skilled in the art will readily appreciate that the detailed<br>
description given herein with respect to these figures is for explanatory purposes as<br>
the invention extends beyond these limited embodiments.<br>
[0023] FIG. 1 is a block diagram of a sports monitoring system 100 according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention. The sports monitoring system 100 is an electronic<br>
system that enables sports related information to be acquired, stored, analyzed,<br>
presented and shared.<br>
[0024] The sports monitoring system 100 includes a portable media device 102. The<br>
portable media device 102 is capable of storing and playing media for its user. For<br>
example, the portable media device 102 can output (e.g., play) audio or video. The<br>
sports monitoring system 100 also includes a sports device 104. The sports device<br><br>
104 is, for example, a pedometer, a heart rate monitor, etc. The sports device 104<br>
includes one or more sensors that acquire sports related data.<br>
[0025] The sports device 104 also includes wireless transmission capability so that<br>
the sports related data can be transmitted to the portable media device 102. In<br>
particular, the portable media device 102 includes a wireless interface accessory 106.<br>
The wireless interface accessory 106 includes a wireless transceiver so that the<br>
wireless interface accessory 106 can receive the sports related data being transmitted<br>
by the sports device 104 by way of a wireless connection through a personal wireless<br>
network 108. The portable media device 102 can receive the sports related data from<br>
the sports device 104 via the wireless interface accessory 106 and can then operate to<br>
process and store the sports related data at the portable media device 102.<br>
[0026] The sports monitoring system 100 also includes a personal computer 110. The<br>
portable media device 102 can be electrically connected to the personal computer 110<br>
by way of a cable 112. The cable 112 can, for example, be a Firewire or USB cable.<br>
Alternatively, the cable 112 can be replaced with a wireless link. Although the<br>
portable media device 102 is not normally electrically connected to the personal<br>
computer 110, the electrical connection when present facilitates information exchange<br>
between the portable media do ice 102 and the personal computer 110.<br>
[0027] The personal computer 110 includes a media management application 114.<br>
The media management application 114, in one embodiment, can not only manage the<br>
media assets stored on the personal computer 110, but can also store and manage<br>
sports related data. In one embodiment, the media management application 114 can<br>
operate to cause the sports related data stored on the portable media device 102 to be<br>
copied to the personal computer 110. Thereafter, the sports related data can be<br>
analyzed at the personal computer 110 and/or made available to the user of the<br>
personal computer 110. In addition, the sports monitoring system 100 can facilitate<br>
the personal computer 110 coupling to a data network 116. The data network 116 can<br>
represent a global or Wide Area network, such as the World Wide Web (or the<br>
Internet). When the personal computer 110 is coupled to the data network 116, the<br>
sports related data present at the personal computer 110 can be transferred to a sports<br>
management server 118. At the sports management server 118, the sports related data<br>
can be further analyzed and/or processed to facilitate usefulness of the data. The<br>
sports management server 118 supports storage and analysis of sports related data<br>
from a large number of different portable media devices and/or personal computers.<br><br>
Hence, the sports management server 118 can also compare the sports related data<br>
from different users. The sports management server 118 can also provide a website<br>
that can be accessed by a network browser operating on the personal computer 110 or<br>
other computing device to access sports related information or other information<br>
made available via the website.<br>
[0028] The sports device 104 illustrated in FIG. 1 can take a variety of different<br>
forms. In one embodiment, the sports device is a sensor-based device. One example<br>
of a sensor-based device is a pedometer.<br>
[0029] FIG. 2 illustrates a block diagram of a sports device 200 according to one<br>
embodiment of the invention, the sports device 200 is, for example, suitable for use<br>
as the sports device 104 illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
[0030] The sports device 200 includes a microcontroller 202 that controls the overall<br>
operation of the sports device 200. The sports device 200 also includes a transducer<br>
204 that acquires raw sports data. As an example, the transducer 204 can pertain to a<br>
piezo-electric device (e.g., piezo-electric pedometer). With a piezo-electric device,<br>
electrical signals associated with pressure applied to the transducer 204 are produced<br>
as a user of the sports device walks or runs. In one embodiment, the sports device<br>
200 can be embedded within a shoe, such as within a sole of a shoe. A signal<br>
conditioning circuit 206 filters and/or amplifies the raw sports data supplied by the<br>
transducer 204. The resulting conditioned sports data is then supplied to the<br>
microcontroller 202. The microcontroller 202 include memory that can store the<br>
conditioned sports data. The sports device 202 also includes a transceiver 208 to<br>
transmit the conditioned sports data to a portable media device, such as the portable<br>
media device 102 via the wireless interface accessory 106 illustrated in FIG. 1. Since<br>
the sports device 200 need not receive data back from the portable media device 102,<br>
the transceiver 208 can alternatively be a transmitter.<br>
[0031] Still further, the sports device 200 is battery powered by a battery 210. In one<br>
embodiment, the battery 210 is not replaceable by the user of the sports device 200.<br>
Accordingly, the sports device 200 is designed to operate in a low power manner. In<br>
this regard, the microcontroller 202 is a low power design and can be placed in a<br>
sleep/hibernate mode when sports data is not being acquired. In one embodiment, the<br>
sports device 200 includes an activity detector 212. The activity detector 212 can<br>
monitor the transducer 204 or the signal conditioning circuit 206 to determine whether<br>
the sports data is indicating that there is some sports related activity (e.g., running,<br><br>
walking, etc.) being undertaken When the activity detector 212 determines that there<br>
is no sports related activity, the activity detector 212 can cause or signal tie<br>
microcontroller 202 to enter a low power mode (i.e., sleep or hibernate). When the<br>
activity detector 212 determines that there is sports related activity while the<br>
microcontroller 202 is in the low power mode, the activity detector 212 can cause or<br>
signal the microcontroller 202 to awaken to a normal mode.<br>
[0032] FIG. 3 is a block diagram of a wireless interface accessory 300 according to<br>
one embodiment of the invention. The wireless interface accessory 300 is, for<br>
example, suitable for use as the wireless interface accessory 106 illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
The wireless interface accessory 300 includes a microcontroller 302 that controls the<br>
overall operation of the wireless interface accessory 300. The wireless interface<br>
accessory 300 also includes a transceiver 304 and a chip antenna 306. The transceiver<br>
304 operates to wirelessly communicate with the counterpart device, such as a sports<br>
device, to receive sports related data. The sports related data is then temporarily<br>
stored in memory provided with the microcontroller 302 and then forwarded to a<br>
portable media device via a connector 308. The connector 308 can couple with a<br>
counterpart connector associated with the portable media device. The microcontroller<br>
302 can also store some user data, including calibration data, as well as sports data,<br>
including as data summaries, workout data, etc. The wireless interface accessory 300<br>
can also includes a power controller 310. The power controller 310 couples to a<br>
power source and ground from the connector 308. The power controller 310 typically<br>
converts the incoming voltage level to a different voltage level to be utilized by the<br>
microcontroller 302 and the transceiver 304.<br>
[0033] FIG. 4 A is a block diagram of an arrangement 400 of functional modules<br>
utilized by a portable media device. The portable media device can, for example, be<br>
the portable media device 102 illustrated in FIG. 1. The arrangement 400 includes a<br>
media player 402 that is able to output media for a user of the portable media device<br>
but also store and retrieve data with respect to a data storage 404. The arrangement<br>
400 also includes a graphical user interface (GUI) manager 406. The GUI manager<br>
406 operates to control information being provided to and displayed on a display<br>
device. The arrangement 400 also includes a communication module 408 that<br>
facilitates communication between the portable media device and an accessory<br>
device. Still further, the arrangement 400 includes an accessory manager 410 that<br>
operates to authenticate and acquire data from an accessory device that may be<br><br>
coupled to the portable media device. For example, the accessory device can be a<br>
wireless interface accessory, such as the wireless interface accessory 106 illustrated in<br>
FIG. 1 as being coupled to the portable media device 102.<br>
[0034] FIG. 4B is a block diagram of a media player 450 suitable for use with the<br>
invention. The media player 450 illustrates circuitry of a representative portable<br>
media device.<br>
[0035] The media player 450 includes a processor 452 that pertains to a<br>
microprocessor or controller for controlling the overall operation of the media player<br>
450. The media player 450 stores media data pertaining to media items in a file<br>
system 454 and a cache 456. The file system 454 is, typically, a storage disk or a<br>
plurality of disks. The file system 454 typically provides high capacity storage<br>
capability for tbe media player 450. However, since the access time to the file system<br>
454 is relatively slow, the media player 450 can also include a cache 456. The cache<br>
456 is, for example, Random-Access Memory (RAM) provided by semiconductor<br>
memory. The relative access time to the cache 456 is substantially shorter than for the<br>
file system 454. However, the cache 456 does not have the large storage capacity of<br>
die file system 454. Further, the file system 454, when active, consumes more power<br>
than does the cache 456. The power consumption is often a concern when the media<br>
player 450 is a portable media player that is powered by a battery 474. The media<br>
player 450 also includes a RAM 470 and a Read-Only Memory (ROM) 472. The<br>
ROM 472 can store programs, utilities or processes to be executed in a non-volatile<br>
manner. The RAM 470 provides volatile data storage, such as for the cache 456.<br>
[0036] The media player 450 also includes a user input device 458 that allows a user<br>
of the media player 450 to interact with the media player 450. For example, the user<br>
input device 458 can take a variety of forms, such as a button, keypad, dial, etc. Still<br>
further, the media player 450 includes a display 460 (screen display) that can be<br>
controlled by the processor 452 to display information to the user. A data bus 461 can<br>
facilitate data transfer between at least the file system 454, the cache 456, the<br>
processor 452, and the CODEC 462.<br>
[0037] In one embodiment, the media player 450 serves to store a plurality of media<br>
items (e.g., songs, podcasts, etc.) in the file system 454. When a user desires to have<br>
the media player play a particular media item, a list of available media items is<br>
displayed on the display 460. Then, using the user input device 458, a user can select<br>
one of the available media items The processor 452, upon receiving a selection of a<br><br>
particular media item, supplies the media data (e.g., audio file) for the particular<br>
media item to a coder/decoder (CODEC) 462. The CODEC 462 then produces analog<br>
output signals for a speaker 464. The speaker 464 can be a speaker internal to the<br>
media player 450 or external to the media player 450. For example, headphones or<br>
earphones that connect to the media player 450 would be considered an external<br>
speaker.<br>
[0038] The media player 450 also includes a bus interface 466 that couples to a data<br>
link 468. The data link 468 allows the media player 450 to couple to a host device<br>
(e.g., host computer or power source). The data link 468 can also provide power to<br>
the media player 450.<br>
[0039] The media player 450 akso includes a network/bus interface 466 that couples<br>
to a data link 468. The data link 468 allows the media player 450 to couple to a host<br>
computer or to accessory devices. The data link 468 can be provided over a wired<br>
connection or a wireless connection. In the case of a wireless connection, the<br>
network/bus interface 466 can include a wireless transceiver. The media items (media<br>
assets) can pertain to one or more different types of media content. In one<br>
embodiment, the media items are audio tracks (e.g., songs, audiobooks, podcasts). In<br>
another embodiment, the media items are images (e.g., photos). However, in other<br>
embodiments, the media items can be any combination of audio, graphical or video<br>
content.<br>
[0040] FIG. 5 is a software system 500 according to one embodiment of the<br>
invention. The software system 500 illustrates an arrangement of software modules<br>
provided within a portable electronic device. For example, the portable electronic<br>
device can be the portable media player 102 illustrated in FIG. 1.<br>
[0041] The software system 500 includes an accessory protocol 502. The accessory<br>
protocol 502 facilitates communication between the portable electronic device,<br>
namely, applications, databases and systems internal to the portable electronic device,<br>
with an accessory device that connects to the portable electronic device. As an<br>
example, the accessory device can pertain to the wireless interface accessory 106<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1. However, any of a wide variety of other the different types of<br>
accessory devices can utilize the accessory protocol 502 to facilitate communication<br>
between the accessory device and the systems, applications and databases internal to<br>
the personal electronic device.<br><br>
[0042] The software system 500 includes, in this embodiment, an operating system<br>
510, accessory applications 508, a media database 512, and a file system 514. As<br>
such, the operating system 510 is able to interact with the accessory device by way of<br>
the accessory protocol 502. Similarly, the one or more accessory applications 508<br>
that are supported by the portable electronic device can communicate with the<br>
accessory device using fee accessory protocol 502. The accessory protocol 502<br>
enables the accessory device to read or write data to the media database 512 or the file<br>
system 514.<br>
[0043] The accessory protocol supports a set of predetermined commands. Through<br>
use of these commands, the portable electronic device and the accessory device are<br>
able to communicate: In communicating with the accessory device, the accessory<br>
protocol 502 outputs commands and data in accordance with the protocol to a driver.<br>
The driver, in turn, is used to deliver the commands and data to the accessory device<br>
by way of a connection. The driver is also used to receive commands and data from<br>
the accessory device. In one embodiment, the connection between the driver(s) and<br>
the accessory device is by way of a pair of complementary connectors, one of such<br>
connectors being associated with the portable electronic device and the other of the<br>
connectors being associated with the accessory device. When the accessory device is<br>
connected to the portable electronic device by way of these connectors, the<br>
connection between the driver and the accessory device is established. Although the<br>
drivers can vary depending upon application, in this particular embodiment shown in<br>
FIG. 5, the drivers include a serial driver 504 and a Universal Serial Bus (USB) driver<br>
506. As such, the accessory protocol enables communication between the portable<br>
electronic device and the accessory device by way of either a serial data connection,<br>
by way of the serial driver 504 or by way of a USB connection using the USB driver<br>
506.<br>
[0044] As noted above, communication between the portable electronic device and<br>
the accessory device is by way of the accessory protocol. The various commands<br>
supported by one embodiment of the accessory protocol are described below with<br>
reference to FlGs. 6A-6D.<br>
[0045] When a portable media device wants to determine whether its version of the<br>
accessory protocol is compatible with the version of the protocol being utilized by the<br>
accessory device, a Get Device Version command 600 can be sent from the portable<br>
media device to the accessory device. In response to the Get Device Version<br><br>
command 600, the accessory device will return a Return Device Version command<br>
602 to the portable electronic device. The Return Device Version command 602<br>
being returned can specify the most recent protocol version that the accessory device<br>
supports. In one implementation, the Return Device Version command 602 can<br>
include an indication of a major version number and a separate indication for a minor<br>
version number. Then, assuming that the protocol version at the portable electronic<br>
device is not less than the version being utilized by the accessory device, the protocols<br>
are compatible.<br>
[0046] By use of the protocol, fee portable electronic device and the accessory device<br>
are able to exchange data. The data can be associated with any system, application,<br>
database, etc. affiliated with the portable electronic device or can be affiliated with<br>
any data the accessory device might have available. The data exchange can be on a<br>
polled basis or on an asynchronous basis. In the case of polling, the portable<br>
electronic device can send a Get Data Frame command 604 to the accessory device.<br>
According to the protocol, the Get Data Frame command 604 serves to request a data<br>
frame be provided back from the accessory device. If the data frame is not available,<br>
the accessory device can return an acknowledgment with a failure status indicator.<br>
Polling can be used when the accessory device does not support asynchronous data<br>
transfer. As discussed below, the capabilities of the accessory device (e.g., supports<br>
for asynchronous data transfer) can also be determined utilizing the accessory<br>
protocol. In response to the Get Data Frame command 604, the accessory device<br>
returns a Return Data Frame command 606. The Return Data Frame 606 provides a<br>
data frame that has been received by the accessory device to the portable electronic<br>
device. Once a received data frame is provided to the portable electronic device, it<br>
can be discarded at the accessory device so that a subsequent Get Data Frame<br>
command 604 does not return the same data frame. It should also be noted that the<br>
data frames being returned are only those that satisfy a data frame filter list, if such is<br>
supported and enabled as discussed in more detail below.<br>
[0047] The portable media device can also transmit a data frame to the accessory<br>
device using a Transmit Data Frame command 608. Here, the Transmit Data Frame<br>
command 608 requests that the accessory device immediately transmit a data frame<br>
over a network to a destination device. The Transmit Data Frame command 608 is<br>
sent by the portable electronic device to the accessory device when a data frame is to<br>
be transmitted. In other words, the Transmit Data Frame command 608 is for<br><br>
asynchronous transmission of a data frame. The end destination for the data frame<br>
being transmitted is typically not me accessory device; hence, the accessory device<br>
will transmits the data frame to the appropriate destination device. The ability to<br>
transfer data asynchronously requires that the capabilities of the accessory device<br>
support such asynchronous data transfers.<br>
[0048] On the other hand, the accessory device can also transmit a data frame from<br>
the accessory device to the portable electronic device using an Asynchronous Data<br>
Frame command 610. Here, the source of the data frame being transmitted from the<br>
accessory device to the portable electronic device is an external wired/wireless device<br>
(e.g., sensor) or an internal devices. For successful data transfer, the Asynchronous<br>
Data Frame command 610 requines that the accessory device support asynchronous<br>
data transfers, that asynchronous data transfers are enabled, and that a data frame<br>
filter list is satisfied (if enabled). In the event that these conditions are not met, the<br>
accessory device will not forward the data frame to the portable electronic device.<br>
[0049] In many cases, it is useful for the portable electronic device to understand the<br>
capabilities of the accessory device. Hence, the protocol includes a Get Capabilities<br>
command 612 that can be sent from the portable electronic device to the accessory<br>
device to request capabilities and thus determine the features available on the<br>
accessory device. In response to the Get Capabilities command 612, the accessory<br>
device responds with a Return Capabilities command 614. The Return Capabilities<br>
command 614 includes data that indicates the capabilities of the accessory device. In<br>
one implementation, a bitmask can be utilized to efficiently report to the portable<br>
media device the capabilities of the accessory device. For example, in one<br>
implementation, the various capabilities of the accessory device that can be reported<br>
include the following: power control capability, filtering capability, asynchronous<br>
data transfer capability, polled data transfer capability, asynchronous data frame<br>
transmission capability, receiver listening mode control capability, receiver listening<br>
window timing control capability, synchronous beacon data frame transmission<br>
capability, network configurable transmission rate capability, and maximum count of<br>
node filters supported.<br>
[0050] The accessory device can typically operate in a plurality of different modes.<br>
In order for the portable electronic device to know what mode the accessory device is<br>
in, the portable electronic device can send a Get Mode command 616 to the accessory<br>
device. In response, the accessory device sends Return Mode command 616 back to<br><br>
the portable electronic device. The Return Mode command 618 includes an<br>
indication of mode information pertaining to the accessory device. In one<br>
embodiment, the mode information can be efficiently provided with the Return Mode<br>
command 618 through use of a bitmask. In any case, in one embodiment, the mode<br>
information being provided with the Return Mode command 618 can include one or<br>
more of the following: a power control state, a filtering state, a polled data transfer<br>
control state, data frame transmission control state, an asynchronous data transfer<br>
control state, receiver listening mode control state, receiver listening window timing<br>
control state, synchronous beacox. frame transmission control state, network<br>
transmission rate control state, and the like.<br>
[0051] Still further, the portable electronic device can set the accessory device into a<br>
particular mode. In other words, any of the control states noted above with regard to<br>
the mode information can be altered by the portable electronic device by sending a Set<br>
Mode command 620 to the accessory device. The accessory device in response to the<br>
Set Mode command 620 can send an acknowledgment command back which<br>
indicates the status of the command's completion. In one embodiment, the Set Mode<br>
command 620 can utilize a bitmask in order to efficiently request one or more<br>
particular mode changes at the accessory device. In any case, the Set Mode command<br>
620 can request to set one or mora modes with respect to one or more of the<br>
following: power control mode, filtering mode, asynchronous data transfer control<br>
mode, polled data transfer control mode, data frame transmission control mode,<br>
receiver listening control mode, receiver listening window timing control state,<br>
synchronous beacon frame transmission control state, network transmission rate<br>
control mode, and the like.<br>
[0052] In addition, the accessory device can utilize a receiver filter so that only those<br>
limited data frames of interest are transmitted from the accessory device to the<br>
portable electronic device. This capability is particularly useful for an accessory<br>
device that wirelessly receives data fames over a wireless network. In one<br>
embodiment, the filter receiver can be implemented using a filter list The filter list is<br>
a list of those node identifiers for which data frames are desired. When filtering is<br>
enabled, data frames from nodes not in the list are filtered out (i.e., excluded). The<br>
protocol includes a Get Filter List command 622 that can be sent by the portable<br>
electronic device to the accessory device to get a list of node identifiers (i.e., filter<br>
list). This requires that the accessory device support identifier filtering as determined<br><br>
using the Return Capabilities command 614. In one embodiment, the Get Filter List<br>
command 622 can include (i) a starting node identifier entry index in the filter list to<br>
read, and (ii) a maximum count of node identifiers to read. In any case, in response to<br>
the Get Filter List command 622, a Return Filter List command 624 is provided from<br>
the accessory device to the portable electronic device. The Return Filter List<br>
command 624 includes a list of nude identifiers that are currently present on the<br>
accessory device. In one example, the filter list can contain a list of network address<br>
entries of nodes from which data frames will be accepted and transferred to the<br>
portable electronic device. The information provided with the Return Filter List<br>
command 624 can include parameters providing (i) a starting node identifier entry<br>
index into the filter list, (ii) the number of the filter node identifiers being returned,<br>
and (iii) the filter list itself. In one implementation, the filter list can be provided as<br>
an array of network address fields (e.g., filter node identifiers).<br>
[0053] Still further, the portable electronic device can also set the one or more node<br>
identifiers in the filter list. The filter list includes one or more network address entries<br>
pertaining to network nodes from which data frames will be accepted and transferred<br>
to the portable electronic device. Hence, when node filtering is enabled, incoming<br>
data frames from sources not in the node filter list will be ignored (i.e., not transferred<br>
,to the portable electronic device). According to the protocol, to alter the filter list at<br>
the accessory device, the portable electronic device sends a Set Filter List command<br>
626 to the accessory device. The Set Filter List command 626 enables the portable<br>
electronic device to cause modification to the filter list at the accessory device,<br>
assuming such filtering is supported by the accessory device. In one embodiment, the<br>
Set Filter List command 626 include parameters providing (i) a starting node<br>
identifier entry index into the filter list to be set, (ii) the number of the filter node<br>
identifiers being set, and (iii) the filter list itself. As previously noted, in one<br>
implementation, the filter list can be provided as an array of network address fields<br>
(e.g., filter node identifiers). Node filtering using the filter list can be<br>
enabled/disabled using the Set Mode command. Node filtering can be disabled when<br>
searching for or discovering remote node devices and enabled once the desired remote<br>
node devices are found.<br>
[0054] Still further, the portable electronic device may desire to transmit data to a<br>
destination address by way of the accessory device. In such a case, as well as other<br>
cases, a Get Device Address command 628 can be sent from the portable electronic<br><br>
device to the accessory device. This command requests that the accessory device<br>
provide its device address that will be thereafter used as a source address for the data<br>
frames that might be transmitted by the portable electronic device (since the accessory<br>
is the "source" of such transmitted data frames). In response to the Get Device<br>
Address command 628, the accessory device sends a Return Device Address<br>
command 630 to the portable electronic device. The Return Device Address<br>
command 630 includes a destination address associated with the accessory device.<br>
Thereafter, if and when the portable electronic device seeks to transmit data via the<br>
accessory device, the address associated with the accessory device can be used as the<br>
source address for a source address field of one or more outgoing data frames.<br>
[0055] To facilitate low-power operation, the portable electronic device can manage<br>
or control when the accessory device is listening for incoming data frames over a<br>
network. Typically, the network is a small local network, often wireless. In this<br>
regard, a listening window is utilized such mat the accessory device is actively<br>
listening for incoming data frames only during the listening window. At other times,<br>
the accessory device is conserving power by not attempting to listen during such<br>
times. Hence, the protocol allows the portable electronic device to send a Get<br>
Receive Window Timing command 632 to acquire information of the timing window,<br>
if any, being utilized. In respons«, the accessory device should return a Return<br>
Receive Window Timing command 634 that contains a timing interval for a listening<br>
window (receive window interval) and a duration for the listening window (receive<br>
window duration). If for some reason the accessory device does not support listening<br>
window timing, an acknowledge command can be returned with a status indication of<br>
the same. In one specific example, the receive window interval is the time in<br>
milliseconds between two windows when the accessory device starts listening for the<br>
received data frames. The receive window duration is the time in milliseconds that<br>
the accessory device listens for received data frames after a receive window interval<br>
has started. Further, the portable electronic device can operate to set receive window<br>
timing on the accessory device, fa this regard, the portable electronic device can send<br>
a Set Receive Window Timing command 636 from the portable electronic device to<br>
the accessory device. The command allows the portable electronic device to<br>
configure the receive window interval and duration. Typically, the portable electronic<br>
device would configure the receive window timing before enabling the listening<br><br>
window. The listening window can be enabled using, for example, a timing control<br>
mode which can be set by a Set Mode command 620.<br>
[0056] The protocol also supports the portable media device in setting a transmit<br>
beacon data frame and a beacon transmission notifier identifier on the accessory<br>
device. A Set Transmit Beacon Frame 638 can be used to set the transmit beacon data<br>
frame at the accessory device. The command is enabled if the appropriate capabilities<br>
indicator indicates support for beacon transmissions. A Set Mode command 620 can<br>
control the transmit beacon which is enabled only after a valid transmit beacon data<br>
frame has been set using the Set Beacon Transmit Frame 638. The beacon<br>
transmissions can be synchronous in accordance with a beacon transmission interval,<br>
assuming synchronous beacon frame transmission is enabled. The Set Transmit<br>
Beacon Frame command 638 can include a data frame to be transmitted. In addition,<br>
the Set Transmit Beacon Frame command 638 can include timing index information<br>
to specify the beacon transmission tuning schedule. In addition, the Set Transmit<br>
Beacon Frame command 638 can include a beacon transmission notification identifier<br>
which controls notification of the portable electronic device when the beacon data<br>
frame is transmitted via the accessory device.<br>
[0057] After the Set Transmit Beacon Frame 638 has been set successfully and<br>
enabled, the accessory device can send a Beacon Transmission Notification command<br>
642 to the portable electronic device when it transmits the beacon data frame,<br>
assuming that transmission notification was not disabled and the associated<br>
capabilities are supported. The Beacon Transmission Notification command 640, in<br>
one embodiment, includes a beacon transmission notification identifier and a beacon<br>
transmission timing information. By receiving back the beacon transmission<br>
notification identifier, the portable of electronic device is able to determine that a<br>
particular beacon data frame has been transmitted.<br>
[0058] A beacon is a data frame broadcast by the accessory device at regular<br>
intervals. The beacon contents to be broadcast, the time interval between broadcasts,<br>
and the option to listen for a period of time after the broadcast are specified in the data<br>
frame sent from the portable electronic device to the accessory device using the Set<br>
Transmit Beacon Frame command 638.<br>
[0059] The beacon can be used to establish a wireless communications link between<br>
the portable electronic device and the accessory device. The beacon data frame could<br>
be configured to listen for a short period of time after the beacon is broadcast If the<br><br>
accessory device wants to communicate with the portable electronic device, it can<br>
wait for the beacon data frame to be broadcast, and then it can send a data frame to<br>
the portable electronic device. A beacon could also be used to send available data<br>
from the portable electronic device to a listening accessory device. For example,<br>
when the portable electronic device is a portable media player, a beacon can be used<br>
to send media data, such as current track index, track position, track name or play<br>
state to another device (accessory device, other portable electronic device, etc.). •<br>
[0060] Still further, the protocol includes a Get Network Data Rate command 642.<br>
The Get Network Data Rate command 642 can be sent by the portable electronic<br>
device to the accessory device to get the current network transmission rate from the<br>
accessory device. Typically, the network involved is a wireless network, but in other<br>
embodiments the network can be a wired network. In the event that configurable data<br>
rate capabilities are not supported, this operation is unavailable. In response to the<br>
Get Network Data Rate command 642, the accessory device returns a Return Network<br>
Data Rate command 644. The Return Network Data Rate command 644 includes the<br>
current network transmission rate setting for the accessory device. A Set Network<br>
Data Rate command 646 is also provided to allow the portable electronic device to set<br>
a network transmission rate at the accessory device. Assuming that the requested<br>
network data rate is supported by the accessory device and that the accessory device<br>
permits configuration of the network transmission rates, the Set Network Data Rate<br>
command 646 allows the portable electronic device to set the network data rate at the<br>
accessory to one of a plurality of different transmission data rates.<br>
[0061] The various aspects, embodiments, implementations or features of the<br>
invention can be used separately or in any combination.<br>
[0062] The invention is preferably implemented by software, hardware or a<br>
combination of hardware and software. The invention can also be embodied as<br>
computer readable code on a computer readable medium. The computer readable<br>
medium is any data storage device that can store data which can thereafter be read by<br>
a computer system. Examples of me computer readable medium include read-only<br>
memory, random-access memory, CD-ROMs, DVDs, magnetic tape, optical data<br>
storage devices, and carrier waves: The computer readable medium can also be<br>
distributed over network-coupled computer systems so that the computer readable<br>
code is stored and executed in a distributed fashion.<br><br>
