				<td>A Reinforced Concrete Thermal Expansion Protector<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention in general relates to reinforced concrete protection. Precisely this invention relates to a novel kind of capsule that is applied to steel rods to prevent thermal expansion cracks in our hot tropical country, preventing rusting, prolonging life of concrete for more years.<br>
State of Art<br>
Existing Reinforced concrete structures as roof, bridges do not last long as expected in coastal and tropical India. A large number of additives were tried as concrete protector, also zinc coating, but surveys have shown march of corrosion! The large cost in repairs, still do not increase durability after repairs. Hence prevention of crack formation will only stop corrosion! There is a large daily variation in heat from cool mid nightl5*C to hot midday of 60*C, that heats the slab. The metallic steel rods have a higher coefficient of linear and volume expansion than the nonmetallic sand or gravel in the mortar. Tons of steel mesh of long lengths create a large expansile force on the concrete that finally cracks at the borders or the bottom of the concrete. Cracks allow moisture to enter and rust the steel, corroding, expanding the cracks, losing tension and collapse finally, in few years!<br>
Existing methods of chemical additives, zinc coating are half measures only! There are no physical devices that eliminate cracking forces!<br>
Ideal protection should be: 1.eliminate expanding steel forces.2 improvement of cement mortar steel bonding with no air trapping! 3.avoid rusting even if concrete is cracked. The following description gives critical examination of the inhalers known in the art. It also discusses the shortcomings of the conventional methods and on offers the solution to overcome the impediments in the construction and the process of using the same.<br>
Constraints in the existing concrete protection are as follows:<br>
1.	There is no elimination of thermal steel expansion, a physical event.<br>
2.	The chemical additives are not thermal protectors.<br>
3.	The concrete laying and setting is not perfect.<br>
4.	The steel rods are not perfectly supported in concrete pouring and setting stage.<br>
5.	The thermal cracks allow moisture entry, rusting starts, cracks increases, steel losses strength and collapses.<br>
Accordingly the object of the invention is to identify the problem associated with the conventional protection. An extensive search has been carried out using the Internet and related patent specifications were studied for thermal expansion preventors. Since the present invention is radically different, the inventor is unable to site any patent specification out of the available databases.<br>
The invention is directed to a novel type of protector, which is most effective for thermal expansion prevention. Further the invention is addressed to the process of using the new device, which is unique in design and construction, working, and use. Further objects of the invention will be clear from the ensuing description.<br>
Summary of the invention:<br>
The device comprises of a transparent short capsule, fixed to the ends of steel rods after laying .The capsule contains compressible foam that also has anti rusting compounds that delay bacterial growth or iron rusting! The foam allows for expansion and contraction of steel rods, without transferring the expansile forces to the concrete! The capsule has markings on its outside to correctly apply by illiterate worker. The capsule has a lower projection to support the steel mesh in actual setting! The capsule has a close fitting sleeve for the rods that prevents water entering the foam in setting! Once set, any amount of steel expansile force is taken by the foam that is compressed in hot or expands in cool without air trapping! Anti rust chemicals further protect the rods! <br>
Statement of Drawings:<br>
These and other objects and features of the invention will become more apparent upon perusal of following description taken in conjunction with accompanying drawings wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows in elevation the constructional details of protector. Figure 2 shows the various components.<br>
Figure 3 shows the exploded view of the action, (a) in hot day with compressed foam, (b) cool with expanded foam in night.<br>
Figure 4.shows another embodiments of the invention with for U bends. Figure 5.shows another embodiments of the invention with for bends<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The following specification describes salient features of invention, the method of<br>
construction, the method of use and the advantages of the novel invention.<br>
The novel device has a short cylindrical capsule with a covered foam in its inside, to absorb the steel thermal expansion and prevent cracks.<br>
The novel device according to the invention is fitted to ends of steel rods mesh and concrete is poured and allowed to cure and set for better effect.<br>
The novel device according to invention is better because the foam now absorbs the thermal expansion of steel rods, with no cracking force transmitted to concrete. Special feature of the invention is that it is easy to apply by illiterates too. The novel device has anti rust chemical embedded with the foam that also adds to protection. The conventional additives and improved cement do not totally prevent the cracking thermal forces. The concrete protection methods have not been improved for decades. The object of the invention is to overcome the inherent defects. To this end the new invention is addressed!<br>
The device comprises of a short transparent plastic capsule 1, with a bold marking 2, for correct application! Short cylindrical foam 3, enclosed in a thin plastic cover 4, fits the inside of the capsule. The foam has anti rust chemicals that prevent bacterial multiplication and steel rusting within the sealed plastic foam cover. The foam takes up the expansible stress with a new anti rust function. The capsule has a lower supporting projection 5 to correctly fix and hold the steel rods in setting! The legs may be simple single projection or modified! A sleeve 6, fits the mouth of the capsule with a central hole 7, for the steel rod 8 The sleeve has clefts 9 to adjust for easy fixing on various sizes of rods.<br>
To use, after the needed concrete steel rod mesh is laid, the capsule with the foam inside and the sleeve is fixed to the ends of all rods to the correct mark 2. Concrete mortar is poured and allowed to cure and set! Weathering course is applied to sun exposed roof slabs as needed. In hot day, the rods expand and move into the foam, compressing it as in fig.3 (a). In cool night the rods loosing heat shrink expanding the foam. Downward projection fixes capsule in concrete, allowing rod expansion with no stress on the concrete mortar as such and preventing cracks, adding years of life.<br>
The device can be modified. For steel rods with ends bent as U arc, the modification as in fig 4, is used with a broad rectangular capsule 1, with a rectangular foam3, rectangular sleeve 6, is used. For ordinary bends a capsule as in fig. 5 can be used with a split elbow shaped capsule 1, a split foam 3 and two sleeves 6. For columns capsule can be fitted vertically on rod ends! The sleeve hole and slots adjust for different rod diameters, as the person wants. More external projections may be made on the capsule outside for fixing in the concrete. Shape may be changed too.<br>
The device is made of plastic with the orifices, foam, sleeve incorporated as a unit or as separate segments easily assembled. <br>
To use, the capsule is made from injection moulding with a transparent plastic say, acrylic, poly propylene, or pvc etc .The soft plastic foam bits are made as cylindrical pieces treated with antirust chemicals and enclosed in a plastic cover to hold the chemicals while setting. The sleeve may be made as another component by another die with a central hole for the steel rod.<br>
It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that modifications to the invention described herein can readily be made without departing from the spirit of the invention. Protection is sought for all the subject matter described herein including any such modifications.<br>
Advantages of the new invention:<br>
1 .The thermal expansion stresses are decreased, with no cracking stress on the concrete.<br>
2.	Transparent	body helps in easy application.<br>
3.	Marking	on the capsule helps correct application by illiterates!<br>
4.	Anti-rusting	chemicals further protect steel rods.<br>
5.	Life	of concrete is longer.<br>
6.	Thermal	stresses, biological corrosion are reduced 7.111iterate workers can fix it easily with the markings.<br>
8. A cost effective device that tackles a physical problem and biological corrosion.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
