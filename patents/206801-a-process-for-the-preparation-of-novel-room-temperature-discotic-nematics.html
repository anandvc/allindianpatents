This invention relates to a process for the preparation of novel hexaalkynylbenzene derivatives; more particularly novel branched-chain hexaalkynylbenzene derivatives.<br>
The compounds reported here may find use as discotic nematic (ND) liquid crystals. Accordingly these compounds can be used as liquid crystalline material for display devices such as, wristwatches, calculators, cash registers, gasoline pumps,<br>
electronic test equipment, laptop computers, TV screens and other large area<br>
 displays. They can also be used as liquid crystal solvents for spectroscopy.<br>
Liquid crystal displays (LCDs) have played a vital role in information technology. The current world LCD market runs to billions of dollars and is rapidly growing. The twisted nematic and supertwisted nematic display devices are dominating commercial displays since their invention. The liquid crystal layer in these devices is exclusively the calamitic liquid crystals (composed of rod-shaped molecules). A vast number of calamitic nematic liquid. crystals having room temperature mesophases, such as, cyanobiphenyls, phenylpyrimidines, phenylcyclohexanes, Schiffs' bases, etc., have been synthesised and used in practical displays.<br>
The major disadvantage with these types of devices is the narrow and nonuniform viewing cone which is considered to be an unacceptable aspect of their performance. We have recently disclosed a novel approach to overcome this problem by utilising discotic nematic liquid crystals instead of calamitic nematic liquid crystals which has been made the subject matter of our Indian Patent Application No. 1131/MAS/98 dated 27.5.98 and the corresponding applications for patent filed in Europe bearing EPO no. 98 307996.3 dated L10.98, in US<br><br>
bearing no. 09/159,743 dated 24.9.98, in Korea bearing no. 98-55028 dated 15.12.98 and in Japan bearing number 334681/98 dated 25.11.98.<br>
Liquid crystals formed by disc-shaped molecules were discovered in 1977 [S. Chandrasekhar, B.K. Sadashiva, and K.A. Suresh, Pramana, 9, 471, (1977)]. Most mesophases formed by these compounds can be classified basically into two classes; the nematic and the columnar. In the columnar phases molecules are<br>
stacked one on top of the other to form columns, the different columns constituting<br>
\ a two dimensional lattice. The potential uses of these columnar phases as quasi-one-dimensional conductors, photoconductors, light emitting diodes, photovoltaic solar cells, etc., have attracted considerable attention [S. Chandrasekhar, in Hand Book of Liquid Crystals, ed. D. Demus, J. Goodby, G.W. Gray, H.-W. Spiess and V. Vill, Wiley-VCH, 1998, Vol. 2B, Chapter VIII; N. Boden and B. Movaghar, ibid. Chapter IX]<br>
The nematic phase formed by disc-shaped molecules is similar to those of<br>
the nematic phase of calamitic molecules, A schematic representation of the discotic nematic phase (ND) (of disc-like molecules) is given below. The director n is representing the preferred axis of orientation of the disc-normals (short molecular axes).<br><br>
Compared to the large number of calamitic molecules showing nematic phase, the number of disk-shaped molecules showing the discotic nematic phase ND<br><br>
are rare. Moreover, me ND phase formed by these materials are high temperature with a narrow thermal range. For any liquid crystal device application, the temperature range of the mesophase and its stability well below and above room temperature are amongst the most important criteria. Hitherto, no room temperature nematic discotic liquid crystal is known. The common procedure for extending the mesophase range of calamitic liquid crystals is by mixing different components and preparing an eutectic mixture but such a procedure has not been applied to discotic nematics till now. Therefore, it is of great practical interest to prepare room temperature discotic nematic liquid crystals.<br>
The main objective of the present invention is, therefore, to develop a process for the synthesis of novel hexaalkynylbenzene derivatives of the general formula (1)<br><br>
where R = branched alkyl chains. The number of carbon atoms in the alkyl chain may range from 4 to 12. The alkyl chain may preferably be consisting of 1, 2 or 3 methyl branch at different positions, for example, 3-methyl octane, 4-methyl octane, 4-methyl nonane, 3, 7-dimethyl octane, 3,7,11-trimethyl dodecane, etc.<br><br>
hexaalkylbenzenes of the formula (2), where R' ==normal alkyl chains as shown in Table 1, are known to form nematic discotic (No) phases [B. Kohne, K. Praefcke, Chimia, 41, 196 (1987); M. Ebert, D.A. Jungbauer, R. Kleppinger, J.H. Wendorff, B. Kohne, K. Praefcke, Liq. Cryst., 4, 53 (1989)]. The thermal behaviour of various reported hexaalkynylbenzenes of the formula (2) is listed below.<br><br>
(2) Table 1. Transition temperatures for hexaalkynylbenzene derivatives<br><br><br>
In addition to these liquid crystalline derivatives, some other non liquid crystalline hexaalkenylbenzene derivatives and a few derivatives showing monotropic liquid crystal phases, for example, hexakispentynylbenzene, hexakisdctynylbenzene, etc., are known in the literature [A.N. Cammidge and R.J. Bushby in Handbook of Liquid Crystals, ed. D. Demus, J. Goodby, G.W. Gray, H.-W. Spiess and V. Vill, Wiley-VCH, 1998, Vol 2B, Chapter VII]. No discotic<br>
material having stable ND phase well below and above the ambient temperature is<br>
■\ documented.<br>
It is evident from the literature that when the peripheral alkyl chains are<br>
attached to the phenyl ring via an hetero atom such as oxygen or sulphur atom, the<br>
melting and clearing temperatures are higher compared to when the alkyl chains are<br>
directly attached to the ring, for example, see the above Table 1 entry 3 and 6.<br>
When the heptyl chain is attached to the phenyl ring directly, the melting point is<br>
98°C and the clearing point is  ISTC whereas they are 109°C and  193^C<br>
respectively when the same chain is attached via oxygen atom. It is also well known<br>
that when the peripheral aliphatic side chains of various cores are branched, the<br>
mesophase is widened but the type of the mesophase formed is not affected by the<br>
introduction of branching [P.G. Schouten, J.F. van der Pol, J.W. Zwikker, W.<br>
Drenth and SJ. Picken, Mol Cryst. Liq. Crysl, 1991, 195, 291; D.M. Collard and<br>

1994,116,6880].<br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of novel hexaalkynylbenzene derivatives of the formula (1) defined<br><br>
above which are useful as discotic nematic (ND) liquid crystal starting from novel branched alkyl chain substituted phenylacetylenes.<br>
The invention is based on our observation that when the normal alkyl chain in the phenyl ring of hexaalkynylbenzene is replaced with branched alkyl chain and connecting it directly to the phenyl ring, the melting points of the alkynylbenzene derivatives may reduce and consequently stabilise the mesophase.<br>
The preparation of the novel branched chain hexalkynylbenzene of the formula (1) defined above according to the present invention is broadly shown in the scheme 1 given below.<br><br>
The compounds of the present invention differ from the previous known compounds  in the following ways;  in the known materials  either normal<br><br>
(unbranched) alkyl chain is attached directly to the phenyl ring or branched alkyl<br>
chain is connected to the phenyl ring via an oxygen atom whereas in our novel<br>
compounds, branched alkyl chain is connected directly to the phenyl ring.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of<br>
novel hexaalkynylbenzene derivatives of the general formula (1) defined above<br>
which comprises condensing novel branched chain substituted phenylacetylenes of<br>
the formula (7) where R has the meanings given above with hexahalobenzene of the<br>
\ formula (8) wherein X represents bromine or iodine in the presence of a coupling<br>
catalyst at a temperature in the range of 25 to 200°C and recovering the compound of the formula by conventional methods.<br>
The condensation can be effected by stirring hexabromo- or hexaiodobenzene with six or more equivalent phenylacetylene. The temperature may be preferably in the range of 50 to l00°C The condensation may be effected for a period in the range of four hours to 100 hours, preferably in the range of 12 hours to 24 hours. The condensation may be effected in the presence of organic solvents selected from benzene, tetrahydrofuran, dimethylformamide, N-methylpyrrolidinone, triethylamine, diisopropylamine, etc., or their mixtures, preferably the organic solvent employed may be triethylamine or a mixture of triethylamine and tetrahydrofuran. The catalyst employed may be selected from tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium (0), bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) chloride, triphenylphosphine, Cul and an organic base. Preferably catalyst may be a mixture of bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(II) chloride, triphenylphosphine and Cul.<br><br>
The invention is described in detail in the examples given below which are provided by way of illustration only and therefore should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
The novel branched chain substituted phenylacetylenes of the formula (7) where R has the meanings given above employed as the starting compounds are obtained by the following reactions.<br>
The branched chain acids of the formula RCOOH where R has the meanings given above are converted to acid chlorides of the formula RCOCl where R has the meanings given above using oxalyl chloride at room temperature. Friedel-Crafts acylation of the bromobenzene of the formula (3) with the above acid chlorides of the formula RCOCl gives the corresponding ketones of the formula (4). Wolff-Kishner reduction of these ketones of the formula (4) furnished the corresponding 4-(branched alkyl)bromobenzenes of the formula (5). Pd-catalysed alkynylation of the bromobenzenes of the formula (5) with 2-methyl-3-butyn"2-ol yielded the corresponding, protected phenylacetylene of the formula (6) which are deprotected using KOH in refluxing toluene to yield the corresponding novel substituted phenylacetylenes of the formula (7).<br>
The novel branched chain phenylacetylenes of the general formula (7) and the other novel intermediates of the formula (4), (5) and (6) where R has the<br>
meanings given above have been made the subject matter of our copending<br>
application no. (B)<br>
A palladium-catalysed coupling of these branched alkylphenylacetylenes of the formula (7) with hexahalobenzene (8) where X is bromo or iodo yielded the desired hexakis(4-(branched akylphenylethynyl)benzenes of the general formula (1) as explained above.<br><br><br>

Physical	characteristics	of        the        compound       hexakis(4-4-<br>
methyInonanylphenylethynyl)benzene.<br>
The product hexakis(4-4-methylnonanylphenylethynyl)benzene of the formula (13) isolated in experiment no. 10-14 by column chromatography was found to be homogenous on TLC and the HPLC purity (silica; hexane; flow 1.2, R.T. 39.25 min) was more than 99%. MS data: m/z 1520.2; 'H NMR data: 5 (CDCb^ 7.58 (12H, d), 7.20 (12H, d), 2.64 (12H, t), 1.63-1.1 (78H, m), 0.90 (36H, m). 13C NMR data: 5 (CDCI3) 144.03, 131.79, 128.52, 127.3, 120.53, 99.41, 87.06, 36.95, 36.72, 36.36, 32.66, 32.21, 28.78,26.72, 22.70, 19.65 and 14.10.<br>
Thermal behaviour: The thermal behaviour of the compound hexakis(4-4-methylnonanylphenylethynyl)benzene isolated from different batches was checked by polarising microscopy and by differential scanning calorimetry. In all the cases, material shows a room temperature nematic (No) phase. However, the melting and isotropic temperatures are different. This could be due to the stereohetrogeneity of the product (with one chiral center in each of the six side chains the product derived from racemic starting materials consist of a mixture of various stereoisomers). Variation of stereoisomers in the mixture could be the cause of varying melting and clearing points in different batches. The melting point was observed in between 0°C to 10oC and the clearing point in between 40°C to 80°C on heating. Upon cooling the isotropic liquid, the discotic nematic phase appeared with a very limited supercooling and the material crystallises in between 0°C to - 21°C. Advantages of the invention.<br>
The nematic phase shown by the compounds of the general formula (1) defined above of the present invention is stable well below and above the ambient<br><br>
temperature and, therfore, very suitable for<br>
 very suitable for liquid crystal display (LCD) devices. The liquid crystal display (LCD) device having discotic nematic liquid crystals instead of calamitic nematic liquid crystals has advantages over the conventional LCD devices in that it has a wide and symmetrical viewing angle and no reversal of the contrast ratio in any direction. Accordingly, the process developed for the preparation of the compounds of the formula (1) of the present invention will be very useful for the preparation of various display devices in liquid crystal industry.<br><br><br><br><br>
