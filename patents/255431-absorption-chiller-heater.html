BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to an absorption type cold/hot water machine, in<br>
other words, an absorption chiller-heater. Particularly, the present invention is concerned<br>
with a technique wherein the operation of an absorbing solution pump for feeding a dilute<br>
absorbing solution from an absorber to a high-temperature regenerator is controlled in<br>
accordance with the level of the absorbing solution present in the high-temperature<br>
regenerator.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
As a conventional method for coping with an abrupt change of load,<br>
particularly for remedying a lowering in the coefficient of performance of a<br>
cooling load there is known a method wherein an absorbing solution pump<br>
for feeding as a dilute absorbing solution from an absorber into a high-<br>
temperature regenerator is inverter-controlled in accordance with an<br>
absorbing solution level detector signal indicative of the level of the<br>
absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator, thereby matching<br>
the flow rate of the absorbing solution with the cooling load to avoid<br>
frequent ON-OFF of the absorbing solution pump caused by an abrupt<br>
change of the liquid level in the high-temperature regenerator and stabilize<br>
the operation of an absorption refrigerating machine (see, for example,<br>
Patent Document: Japanese Patent Laid-Open Publication No. Hei 3(1991)-<br>
28674).<br>
An absorption type cold/hot water machine sometimes has a case<br>
where an absorbing solution level detector detects a lower-limit value or less<br>
of the absorbing solution level due to such an unusual state as a temporary<br>
marked change of the absorbing solution level in a high-temperature<br><br>
regenerator caused for example by a boiling state of the high-temperature<br>
regenerator resulting from for example an abrupt change of a cooling load at<br>
the time of start-up or during operation of the machine. Even in case of<br>
having detected such a temporary drop of the absorbing solution level, an<br>
absorbing solution pump is inverter-controlled as described above without<br>
issuing an immediate warning of a state of boil-dry or stopping the<br>
operation of the machine, and when the cooling load decreases, the level of<br>
the absorbing solution rises rapidly, but the absorbing solution pump is<br>
operated at a low frequency to avoid a marked rise of the absorbing solution<br>
level and cause the level to drop to a predetermined level. When the<br>
cooling load increases, the level of the absorbing solution drops rapidly, but<br>
the absorbing solution pump is operated at a high frequency to avoid a<br>
marked drop of the absorbing solution level and cause the level to rise up to<br>
a predetermined level.<br>
In the event there occurs an abrupt change of the absorbing solution<br>
level due to such an unusual state, a considerable time of about 5 to 10<br>
minutes is taken until the absorbing solution level reaches the<br>
predetermined level by inverter-control of the absorbing solution pump, so<br>
there is a fear that the high-temperature regenerator may assume a state of<br>
boil-dry. Therefore, it is necessary to check as soon as possible whether the<br>
abrupt drop of the absorbing solution level is caused by the unusual state<br>
mentioned above or the absorbing solution level has dropped to the lower<br>
limit or less as a result of an increase of the cooling load in normal operation.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to the present invention, in view of the above-mentioned<br>
point, it is detected quickly whether the drop of the absorbing solution level<br>
in the high-temperature regenerator to the lower limit or less is temporary<br><br><br><br><br><br>
or a drop in normal state, then if the drop is detected to be a temporary drop,<br>
the operation of the absorption type cold/hot water machine is continued,<br>
while if the drop is detected to be a continuous drop, there issues a warning<br>
that the machine is in a state of boil-dry, and at the same time the operation<br>
of the machine is stopped, thus making an appropriate boil-dry safety<br>
control.<br>

when the absorbing level detector detects the predetermined lower-limit<br>

example by a boiling state of the high-temperature regenerator resulting<br>
from for example a change of a cooling load at the time of start-up or during<br>
operation of the absorption type cold/hot water machine, the liquid level can<br>
be returned to its normal level quickly by a high-speed operation of the<br><br><br>
absorbing solution pump. Thus, it is possible to make a quick and accurate<br>
determination without need of waiting for a long time for a natural recovery<br>
from the temporarily dropped liquid level. Therefore, it is possible to<br>
prevent malfunctions caused by a temporary drop of the liquid level, such as<br>

predetermined lower-limit level of the absorbing solution, the absorbing<br>
solution pump is fully operated at a predetermined high frequency for a<br>
predetermined time, whereby it is possible to effect recovery up to the<br>
normal liquid level quickly. Thus, it is possible to make a quick and<br>
accurate determination without need of waiting for a long time for the<br>
natural recovery from such a temporary drop of the liquid level. Therefore,<br>
it is possible to prevent malfunctions caused by a temporary drop of the<br>
liquid level, such as sounding of a warning and stop of operation of the<br>
absorption type cold/hot water machine. At the same time, when the level<br>
of the absorbing solution drops the lower-limit level or less, a control is<br>
made to issue a warning and/or stop of the operation of the machine,<br>
whereby it is possible to make the boil-dry protection of the high-<br>
temperature regenerator.<br>
According to the third aspect of the present invention mentioned<br>
above, in addition to the second aspect, a rise in temperature of the<br><br><br>
absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator is measured, and<br>
when it is the predetermined value or more, it indicates an abnormal state.<br>
Therefore, when the temperature rise is equal to or above the<br>
predetermined value and the level detector detects the predetermined lower-<br>
limit level of the absorbing solution, the high-temperature regenerator is in<br>
a state of boil-dry due to a solution level drop. At this time, there issues a<br>
boil-dry warning and/or the operation of the absorption type cold/hot watrer<br>
machine is stopped, thereby informing a worker that the warning is of the<br>
state of boil-dry and hence permitting the worker to make appropriate<br>
inspection and protection.<br>
According to the fourth aspect of the present invention mentioned<br>
above, in addition to the second aspect, a rise in temperature of the high-<br>
temperature regenerator is measured, when a rise in temperature of<br>
exhaust gas discharged from the high-temperature regenerator is the<br>
predetermined value or more, it indicates an abnormal state. Therefore,<br>
when this temperature rise is equal to or above the predetermined value<br>
and the level detector detects the predetermined lower-limit level of the<br>
absorbing solution, the high-temperature regenerator is in a state of boil-dry<br>
due to a solution level drop. At this time, there issues a boil-dry warning<br>
and/or the operation of the absorption type cold/hot water machine is<br>
stopped, thereby informing a worker that the warning is of the state of boil-<br>
dry and permitting the worker to make and<br>

storage of data such as temperature data, and an input/output interface<br>
serving as communication means, to control the operation of the absorption<br>
type cold/hot water machine P.<br>
The absorption type cold/hot water machine P is operated<br><br><br>
switchingly between a cooling operation of taking out cold water from the<br>
outlet pipe 17B of the cold/hot water pipe 17 and a heating operation of<br>
taking out hot water from the outlet pipe 17B. In the cooling operation, the<br>
opening/closing valves 26, 27 and 28 are closed, allowing cooling water to<br>
flow through the cooling water pipe 18, and the gas burner 2 is ignited by<br>
the igniter 24 to heat the absorbing solution in the high-temperature<br>
regenerator 1, whereby there are obtained refrigerant vapor separated by<br>
evaporation from the absorbing solution and an intermediate absorbing<br>
solution increased in condensation after separation of the refrigerant vapor.<br>
The refrigerant vapor of a high temperature produced in the high-<br>
temperature regenerator 1 passes through the refrigerant pipe 13 and<br>
enters the low-temperature regenerator 3 to heat the intermediate<br>
absorbing solution having been produced in the high-temperature<br>
regenerator 1 and entered the low-temperature regenerator 2 through the<br>
high-temperature heat exchanger 8 by the absorbing solution pipe 10, thus<br>
radiates heat, condenses and enters the condenser 4. On the other hand,<br>
the refrigerant having been heated in the low-temperature regenerator 3<br>
and evaporated off from the intermediate absorbing solution gets into the<br>
condenser 4, heat-exchanges with water flowing through the interior of the<br>
heat transfer pipe ISA from the cooling water pipe 18, thereby condenses<br>
into liquid, then passes through the refrigerant pipe 14 together with the<br>
condensed refrigerant supplied from the refrigerant pipe 13, and enters the<br>
evaporator 5.<br>
The refrigerant liquid having entered the evaporator 5 and<br>
accumulated in a refrigerant sump formed in the bottom of the evaporator is<br>
sprinkled by the refrigerant pump 16 over a heat transfer pipe 17A<br>
connected to the cold/hot water pipe 17, then heat-exchanges with water<br>
which is supplied through the cold/hot water pipe 17, thereby evaporates<br><br><br>
and cools water flowing through the interior of the heat transfer pipe 17A.<br>
The refrigerant evaporated in the evaporator 5 enters the absorber 6 and is<br>
absorbed by the absorbing solution whose condensation has been further<br>
increased by being heated in the low-temperature regenerator 3 to<br>
evaporate off the refrigerant, i.e., the condensed absorbing solution which is<br>
supplied from the absorbing solution pipe 11 through the low-temperature<br>
heat exchanger 7 by the pump 25 and sprinkled from above. The absorbing<br>
solution whose condensation has been decreased by absorbing the<br>
refrigerant in the absorber 6, i.e., a dilute absorbing solution, is fed from the<br>
absorbing solution pipe 9 to the high-temperature regenerator 1 through the<br>
low-temperature heat exchanger 7 and the high-temperature heat<br>
exchanger 8 by the operation of the absorbing solution pump 12.<br>
With the operation of the absorption type cold/hot water machine<br>
performed in the above-mentioned manner, if cold water which has been<br>
cooled by the heat of vaporization of the refrigerant in the heat transfer pipe<br>
17A disposed in the interior of the evaporator 5 is supplied circulatively to<br>
an indoor unit (not shown) through the outlet pipe 17B of the cold/hot water<br>
pipe 17, it is possible to perform a cooling operation.<br>
On the other hand, for a heating operation, the opening/closing<br>
valves 26, 27 and 28 are opened, then the gas burner 2 is ignited by the<br>
igniter 24 without flowing cooling water into the cooling water pipe 18, and<br>
the dilute absorbing solution is heated in the high-temperature regenerator<br>
1. As a result, the refrigerant evaporated from the dilute absorbing<br>
solution in the high-temperature regenerator 1 passes mainly through a<br>
refrigerant pipe 13A of a low channel resistance from an intermediate<br>
position of the refrigerant pipe 13, enters the absorber 6 and the evaporator<br>
5, then heat-exchanges through the heat transfer pipe 17A with water<br>
supplied from the cold/hot water pipe 17 and condenses thereby. Mainly<br><br><br>
with the resulting condensation heat, the water flowing through the interior<br>
of the heat transfer pipe 17A is heated.<br>
The refrigerant condensed after heating in the evaporator 5 is fed<br>
from the refrigerant sump formed in the bottom of the evaporator 5 into the<br>
absorber 6 through the opening/closing valve 28 by means of the refrigerant<br>
pump 16, then is mixed with the absorbing solution which flows into the<br>
absorber 6 through the opening/closing valve 27 after evaporation and<br>
separation of the refrigerant in the high-temperature regenerator 1, then by<br>
operation of the absorbing solution pump 12 the resulting mixture is fed<br>
from the absorbing solution pipe 9 into the high-temperature regenerator 1<br>
through the low-temperature heat exchanger 7 and the high-temperature<br>
heat exchanger 8.<br>
Hot water heated by the heat transfer pipe 17A in the interior of the<br>
evaporator 5 is supplied circulatively to the indoor unit (not shown) through<br>
the outlet pipe 17B of the cold/hot water pipe 17, whereby a heating<br>
operation is performed.<br>
The control unit 33 controls the operation of the absorbing solution<br>
pump 12 in accordance with the result of detection made by the level<br>
detector 30. When the level detector 30 detects the lower-limit level or less<br>
of the absorbing solution, the absorbing solution pump 12 is operated at<br>
high speed for a predetermined time to increase the amount of the absorbing<br>
solution fed into the high-temperature regenerator 1. Then, upon arrival<br>
at or lapse of the predetermined time, the control unit 33 determines<br>
whether the detector 30 is detecting the lower-limit level or less of the level<br>
absorbing solution, When the detector 30 is detecting the lower-limit level<br>
or less of the level of the absorbing solution, the control unit 33 makes<br>
control so as to perform both or one issuance of sounding of a warning and<br>
stop of operation of the absorption type cold/hot water machine P.<br><br><br>
A more concrete configuration will now be described. A detection<br>
output of the temperature detector 29 which detects the temperature of the<br>
absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator 1 and a detection<br>
output of a temperature detector 34 which detects an inlet temperature of<br>
cooling water flowing into the cooling water pipe 18 are inputted to the<br>
control unit 33. In the cooling operation as shown in Fig.3, when on the<br>
basis of the detection outputs of the temperature detectors 29 and 34 the<br>
temperature of the absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator<br>
1 is found to change for example in the range of 90° C to 160°C<br>
correspondingly to each range of the cooling water inlet temperature defined<br>
in increments of 2°C for example from 22°C to 32°C, there is made an<br>
adjustment so that the frequency changes continuously or stepwise for<br>
example in the range of 28 to 60 Hz, whereby the higher the temperature of<br>
the absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator 1, the higher the<br>
frequency signal which the control unit 33 outputs on the basis of the input<br>
provided from the temperature detector 29. Consequently, the frequency of<br>
electric power outputted from the inverter controller 32 to the electric motor<br>
of the absorbing solution pump 12 becomes high and the absorbing solution<br>
pump 12 assumes a state of high-speed operation, resulting in that the<br>
delivery of the absorbing solution pump 12 increases. Besides, the lower<br>
the temperature of the absorbing solution in the high-temperature<br>
regenerator 1, the lower the frequency signal which the control unit 33<br>
outputs on the basis of the input provided from the temperature detector 29.<br>
Consequently, the frequency of electric power outputted from the inverter<br>
controller 32 to the electric motor of the absorbing solution pump 21<br>
becomes low and the absorbing solution pump 12 assumes a state of low-<br>
speed operation, resulting in that the delivery of the absorbing solution<br>
pump 12 decreases.<br><br><br>
In the heating operation, cooling water is not allowed to flow into the<br>
cooling water pipe 18 as noted above, so that the higher the temperature of<br>
the absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator 1 on the basis of<br>
the detection output of the temperature detector 29 as a detector for<br>
detecting the temperature of the absorbing solution in the high-temperature<br>
regenerator 1, which is inputted to the control unit 33, the higher the<br>
frequency signal which the control unit 33 outputs on the basis of the input<br>
provided from the temperature detector 29 as mentioned above.<br>
Consequently, the frequency of electric power outputted from the inverter<br>
controller 32 to the electric motor of the absorbing solution pump 12<br>
becomes high and the absorbing solution pump 12 assumes a state of high-<br>
speed operation, with the result that the delivery of the absorbing solution<br>
pump 12 increases. Moreover, the lower the temperature of the absorbing<br>
solution in the high-temperature regenerator 1, the lower the frequency<br>
signal which the control unit 33 outputs on the basis of the input provided<br>
from the temperature detector 29. Consequently, the frequency of electric<br>
power outputted from the inverter controller 32 to the electric motor of the<br>
absorbing solution pump 12 becomes low and the absorbing solution pump<br>
12 assumes a state of low-speed operation, with consequent decrease of the<br>
delivery of the absorbing solution pump 12.<br>
Thus, the frequency of electric power outputted from the inverter<br>
controller 32 in the control unit 33 to the absorbing solution pump 12 varies<br>
at least in accordance with the temperature of the absorbing solution in the<br>
high-temperature regenerator 1. Thus, the absorbing solution pump 12 is<br>
inverter-controlled so that the number of revolutions thereof changes,<br>
whereby the level of the absorbing solution in the high-temperature<br>
regenerator 1 is maintained at an appropriate level.<br>
Although in the above configuration the temperature of the high-<br><br><br>
temperature regenerator is detected by the temperature detector 29 which<br>
detects the temperature of the absorbing solution in the high-temperature<br>
regenerator 1, there may be adopted a configuration using the temperature<br>
detector 31 which detects the temperature of exhaust gas discharged from<br>
the high-temperature regenerator 1.<br>
The level detector 30 has three electrodes A, B and C for detecting<br>
the level of the absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator 1, of<br>
which the electrode B is a common electrode. When the level of the<br>
absorbing solution rises and reaches the electrode A, the electrodes A and B<br>
become conductive and the control unit 33 operates so as to detect a high<br>
level (upper-limit level). When the level of the absorbing solution drops<br>
lower than the electrode C and the electrodes B and C become non-<br>
conductive, the state of detection becomes a low level (lower-limit level)<br>
detecting state and the control unit 33 operates accordingly. Thus, an<br>
absorbing solution level range from the electrode C to the electrode A<br>
represents a normal state of the amount of the absorbing solution. This is<br>
determined by the control unit 33 and the absorbing solution pump 12 is<br>
inverter-controlled in the manner described above.<br>
Thus, the absorbing solution level range from the electrode C to the<br>
electrode A corresponds to a normal state of the amount of the absorbing<br>
solution. In this state, as noted above and as shown in Fig. 3, the<br>
absorbing solution pump 12 is inverter-controlled in the range of 28 to 60 Hz.<br>
If in this state of operation there occurs a rise of the absorbing solution level<br>
frequently in a short time by some causes, the electric power frequency<br>
supplied to the absorbing solution pump 12 is lowered. For example, when<br>
the electric power frequency supplied to the absorbing solution pump 12<br>
which is in operation under inverter control is 40 Hz, the number of times<br>
the level of the absorbing solution reaches the electrode A within a<br><br><br>
has dropped to the lower-limit level or less, the processing flow advances to<br>
step S3. In step S3, the absorbing solution pump 12 is operated in a state<br>
of highest speed within its operation range or at a high speed close thereto.<br>
In this embodiment the absorbing solution pump 12 is operated for a<br>
predetermined time at the maximum frequency of 60 Hz under inverter<br>
control. In this embodiment the predetermined time is 60 seconds, but<br>
may be any time in the range of 30 to 60 seconds.<br>
In step S4, if during the aforesaid period of 60 seconds the level of<br>
the absorbing solution rises and the electrodes B and C become conductive<br>
and so do the electrodes A and C, then at this instant the processing flow<br>
advances to step S6. However, if during this 60 sec. period the solution<br>
level does not rise so as to bring the electrodes A and C into conduction, the<br>
processing flow advances to step S5 in 60 seconds (upon arrival at 60<br>
seconds or after the lapse of 60 seconds). In step S5 it is determined<br>
whether the electrodes B and C are conductive, i.e., whether the level of the<br>
absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator 1 is the lower-limit<br>
level or more. If the answer is affirmative, the processing flow advances to<br>
step S6. In step S6, the absorption type cold/hot water machine P is in<br>
normal operation and the frequency of electric power outputted from the<br>
inverter controller 32 in the control unit 33 to the absorbing solution pump<br>
12 changes in accordance with the temperature of the absorbing solution in<br>
the high-temperature regenerator 1, whereby the absorbing solution pump<br>
12 is inverter-controlled so that the number of revolutions thereof changes<br>
and the level of the absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator<br>
1 is maintained at an appropriate absorbing solution level.<br>
If in step S5 the electrodes B and C are non-conductive, i.e., the<br>
lower-limit level has not been reached, it is determined that the level of the<br>
absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator 1 is in an abnormal<br><br><br>
deficient state, and the processing flow advances to step S7, in which a<br>
warning indicative of the abnormal state is issued. This "abnormal"<br>
warning is issued, for example, by sounding of a buzzer or lighting of a lamp.<br>
In step S7 the operation of the absorption type cold/hot water machine P<br>
may be stopped. The control unit 33 may make a control so that both or<br>
one of such issuance of the warning and stop of operation of the machine P<br>
are (is) performed.<br>
After arrival at step S6 in the operation, the processing flow<br>
advances to step S1, followed by the same determinations as above and each<br>
determination is made. In this way the operations of steps S1 to S6 are<br>
repeated.<br>
According to the present invention, when the level of the absorbing<br>
solution drops to the predetermined lower-limit level, that is, when the<br>
electrodes B and C cease to conduct and become non-conductive, this state<br>
indicates the deficiency of the absorbing solution, but it is determined by the<br>
control unit 33 whether this state is attributable to a temporary change of<br>
the absorbing solution level or not. Further, another means for this<br>
determining operation will be described with reference to Figs. 4 and 5.<br>
The configuration and operation of the absorption type cold/hot water<br>
machine P are the same as in Figs. 1 and 3. In this case, the detection<br>
output of the temperature detector 29 for detecting the temperature of the<br>
absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator 1 is inputted to the<br>
control unit 33. The absorbing solution pump 12 is in a state of being<br>
inverter-controlled in the range of 28 to 60 Hz, as shown in Fig. 3. Fig. 4 is<br>
a control flow chart and Fig. 5 is a diagram showing a temperature rise<br>
detected by a temperature detector, both in connection with the present<br>
invention.<br>
In Fig. 4, the level of the absorbing solution in the high-temperature<br><br><br>
regenerator 1 is detected by the level detector 30 in step S1. In step S2, it<br>
is determined whether the absorbing solution level has dropped to the<br>
lower-limit value or less, i.e., whether the electrodes B and C are non-<br>
conductive or not, and if the electrodes B and C are conductive, the<br>
processing flow advances to step S7, while if the electrodes B and C are non-<br>
conductive and the lower-limit level or less is detected, the processing flow<br>
advances to step S3. In step S3, the absorbing solution pump 12 is<br>
operated at high speed. In the embodiment, the operation is performed for<br>
a predetermined time at the maximum frequency of 60 Hz which is inverter-<br>
controlled. In the embodiment the predetermined time is 60 seconds, but<br>
may be any other time falling under the range of 30 to 60 seconds.<br>
In step S4, if during the 60 sec. period the solution level rises and<br>
the electrodes B and C become conductive and so do the electrodes A and C,<br>
the processing flow advances to step S7 on the moment. However, if during<br>
the 60 sec. period the solution level does not rise so as to bring the<br>
electrodes A and C into conduction, the processing flow advances to step S5<br>
in 60 seconds (upon arrival at 60 seconds or after the lapse of 60 seconds).<br>
In step S5, it is determined whether the electrodes B and C are conductive<br>
or not, i.e., whether the level of the absorbing solution in the high-<br>
temperature regenerator 1 is the lower-limit level or more. If the answer is<br>
affirmative, the processing flow advances to step S6, but if the electrodes B<br>
and C are non-conductive, i.e., if the lower-limit level has not been reached,<br>
it is determined that the level of the absorbing solution in the high-<br>
temperature regenerator 1 is in an abnormal deficient state, then the<br>
processing flow advances to step S8, in which a warning indicative of the<br>
abnormal state is issued. This "abnormal" warning is issued, for example,<br>
by sounding of a buzzer or lighting of a lamp. In step S8, the operation of<br>
the absorption type cold/hot water machine P may be stopped. The control<br><br><br>
unit 33 may make a control so that both or one of such issuance of the<br>
warning and stop of operation of the machine P are (is) performed.<br>
If in step S5 the electrodes B and C are conductive, i.e., if the lower-<br>
limit level has been reached, the processing flow advances to step S6. In<br>
step S6, as shown in Fig. 5, on the basis of the detection output of the<br>
temperature detector 29 which is inputted to the control unit 33, it is<br>
determined whether the temperature rise of the absorbing solution in the<br>
high-temperature regenerator 1 is within a prescribed range or not. In the<br>
embodiment, it is determined whether the temperature rise of the absorbing<br>
solution in the high-temperature regenerator 1 is a predetermined value<br>
(5°C) or more in a predetermined time (15 seconds). The temperatures<br>
shown on the left side of Fig. 5 do not constitute any limitation.<br>
In step S6, if the temperature rise of the absorbing solution in the<br>
high-temperature regenerator 1 is within the prescribed range, i.e., if it does<br>
not reach the predetermined value (5°C) in the predetermined time (15<br>
seconds), this means that the high-temperature regenerator 1 is within a<br>
safe range, therefore, the processing flow advances to step S6. If the<br>
temperature rise of the absorbing solution in the high-temperature<br>
regenerator 1 exceeds the predetermined range, i.e., if it is the<br>
predetermined value (5°C) or more in the predetermined time (15 seconds),<br>
this means that the high-temperature regenerator 1 is in a dangerous range,<br>
therefore, the processing flow advances to step S8, in which a warning<br>
indicative of this abnormal state is issued. This "abnormal" warning is<br>
issued, for example, by sounding of a buzzer or lighting of a lamp. In step<br>
S8, the operation of the absorption type cold/hot water machine P may be<br>
stopped. The control unit 33 may make a control so that both or one of<br>
such issuance of the warning and stop of operation of the machine P are (is)<br>
performed.<br><br><br>
In step S7, the absorption type cold/hot water machine P is in<br>
normal operation, and as noted above, the frequency of electric power<br>
outputted from the inverter controller 32 in the control unit 33 to the<br>
absorbing solution pump 12 changes in accordance with the temperature of<br>
the absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator 1, whereby the<br>
absorbing solution pump 12 is inverter-controlled so that the number of<br>
revolutions thereof changes. In this way the lever of the absorbing solution<br>
in the high-temperature regenerator 1 is maintained at an appropriate level.<br>
Thus, when the level detector 30 detects a drop of the absorbing<br>
solution level to the lower-limit value or less, the control unit 33 makes<br>
control so that the absorbing solution pump 12 operates at a predetermined<br>
high frequency for a predetermined time. At the same time, a temperature<br>
rise of the absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator 1 is<br>
measured. Then, when the temperature rise is the predetermined value or<br>
more and the level detector 30 detects the lower-limit level or less of the<br>
absorbing solution upon arrival at or lapse of the predetermined time, the<br>
issuance of a warning and/or the stop of operation of the absorption type<br>
cold/hot water machine are (is) performed. After arrival at step S7, the<br>
processing flow advances to step S1, followed by each determination in the<br>
same steps as mentioned above. In this way the operations from step SI to<br>
step S7 are repeated.<br>
According to the present invention, when the level of the absorbing<br>
solution drops to the predetermined lower-limit level, that is, when the<br>
electrodes B and C cease to conduct and become non-conductive, this state<br>
indicates the deficiency of the absorbing solution, but it is determined by the<br>
control unit 33 whether this state is attributable to a temporary change of<br>
the absorbing solution level or not. Further, still another means for this<br>
determining operation will be described with reference to Figs. 4 and 5.<br><br><br>
The configuration and operation of the absorption type cold/hot water<br>
machine P are the same as in Figs. 1 and 3. In this case, the detection<br>
output of the temperature detector 31 for detecting the temperature of<br>
exhaust gas discharged from the high-temperature regenerator 1 is inputted<br>
to the control unit 33. The absorbing solution pump 12 is in a state of<br>
being inverter-controlled in the range of 28 to 60 Hz, as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Fig. 4 is a control flow chart and Fig. 5 is a diagram showing a temperature<br>
rise detected by a temperature detector, both in connection with the<br>
invention.<br>
In Fig. 4, the level of the absorbing solution in the high-temperature<br>
regenerator 1 is detected by the level detector 30 in step S1. In step S2, it<br>
is determined whether the absorbing solution level has dropped to the<br>
lower-limit value or less, i.e., whether the electrodes B a and C are non-<br>
conductive or not, and if the electrodes B and C are conductive, the<br>
processing flow advances to step S7, while if the electrodes B and C are non-<br>
conductive and the lower-limit level or less is detected, the processing flow<br>
advances to step S3. In step S3, the absorbing solution pump 12 is<br>
operated at high speed. In the embodiment the operation is performed for<br>
a predetermined time at the maximum frequency of 60 Hz which is inverter-<br>
controlled. In the embodiment the predetermined time is 60 seconds, but<br>
may be any other time falling under the range of 30 to 60 seconds.<br>
In step S4, if during the 60 sec. period the solution level rises and<br>
the electrodes B and C become conductive and so do the electrodes A and C,<br>
the processing flow advances to step S7 on the moment. However, if during<br>
the 60 sec. period the solution level does not rise so as to bring the<br>
electrodes A and C into conduction, the processing flow advances to step S5<br>
in 60 seconds (upon arrival at 60 seconds or after the lapse of 60 seconds).<br>
In step S5, it is determined whether the electrodes B and C are conductive<br><br><br>
or not, i.e., whether the level of the absorbing solution in the high-<br>
temperature regenerator 1 is the lower-limit level or more. If the answer is<br>
affirmative, the processing flow advances to step S6, but if the electrodes B<br>
and C are non-conductive, i.e., if the lower-limit level has not been reached,<br>
it is determined that the level of the absorbing solution in the high-<br>
temperature regenerator 1 is in an abnormal deficient state, then the<br>
processing flow advances to step S8, in which a warning indicative of the<br>
abnormal state is issued. This "abnormal" warning is issued, for example,<br>
by sounding of a buzzer or lighting of a lamp. In step S8, the operation of<br>
the absorption type cold/hot water machine P may be stopped. The control<br>
unit 33 may make a control so that both or one of such issuance of the<br>
warning and stop of operation of the machine P are (is) performed.<br>
If in step S5 the electrodes B and C are conductive, i.e., if the lower-<br>
limit level has been reached, the processing flow advances to step S6. In<br>
step S6, as shown in Fig. 5, on the basis of the detection output of the<br>
temperature detector 31 which is inputted to the control unit 33, it is<br>
determined whether the temperature rise of exhaust gas discharged from<br>
the high-temperature regenerator 1 is within a prescribed range or not. In<br>
the embodiment, it is determined whether the temperature rise of exhaust<br>
gas from the high-temperature regenerator 1 is a predetermined value (5°C)<br>
or more in a predetermined time (15 seconds). The temperatures shown on<br>
the left side of Fig. 5 do not constitute any limitation.<br>
In step S6, if the temperature rise of the exhaust gas from the high-<br>
temperature regenerator 1 is within the prescribed range, i.e., if it does not<br>
reach the predetermined value (5°C) in the predetermined time (15 seconds),<br>
this means that the high-temperature regenerator 1 is within a safe range,<br>
therefore, the processing flow advances to step S6. If the temperature rise<br>
of the exhaust gas from the high-temperature regenerator 1 exceeds the<br><br><br>
prescribed range, i.e., if it is the predetermined value (5°C) or more in the<br>
predetermined time (15 seconds), this means that the high-temperature<br>
regenerator 1 is in a dangerous range, therefore, the processing flow<br>
advances to step S8, in which a warning indicative of this abnormal state is<br>
issued. This "abnormal" warning is issued, for example, by sounding of a<br>
buzzer or lighting of a lamp. In step S8, the operation of the absorption<br>
type cold/hot water machine P may be stopped. The control unit 33 may<br>
make a control so that both or one of such issuance of the warning and stop<br>
of operation of the machine P are (is) performed.<br>
In step S7. the absorption type cold/hot water machine P is in<br>
normal operation, and as noted above, the frequency of electric power<br>
outputted from the inverter controller 32 in the control unit 33 to the<br>
absorbing solution pump 12 changes in accordance with the temperature of<br>
the absorbing solution in the high-temperature regenerator 1, whereby the<br>
absorbing solution pump 12 is inverter-controlled so that the number of<br>
revolutions thereof changes. In this way the level of the absorbing solution<br>
in the high-temperature regenerator 1 is maintained at an appropriate level.<br>
Thus, when the level detector 30 detects a drop of the absorbing<br>
solution level to the predetermined lower-limit level, i.e., when it is detected<br>
that the electrodes B and C in the level detector 30 have come into a non-<br>
conductive state, the control unit 33 makes control so that the absorbing<br>
solution pump 12 operates at a predetermined high frequency for a<br>
predetermined time. At the same time, a temperature rise of the exhaust<br>
gas from the high-temperature regenerator 1 is measured. Then, when the<br>
temperature rise is the predetermined value or more and the level detector<br>
30 detects the lower-limit level or less of the absorbing solution upon arrival<br>
at or lapse of the predetermined time, the issuance of a warning and/or the<br>
stop of operation of the absorption type cold/hot water machine are (is)<br><br><br>
performed. After arrival at step S7, the processing flow advances to step<br>
S1, followed by each determination in the same steps as mentioned above.<br>
In this way the operations from step S1 to step S7 are repeated.<br>
In the above second and third embodiments the order of steps S5<br>
and S6 may be reversed so that step S6 is performed before step S5 is<br>
performed.<br>
Although in the above embodiments the upper- and lower-limit<br>
levels of the absorbing solution are detected by the level detector 30 using<br>
three electrodes A, B and C of different lengths, no limitation is made<br>
thereto. For example, there may be adopted a configuration wherein the<br>
level detector 30 is made up four electrodes D, E, F and G of different<br>
lengths, the upper-limit level of the absorbing solution is detected by<br>
conduction of the electrodes D and E, the lower-limit level thereof is<br>
detected by conduction of the electrodes F and G, an intermediate solution<br>
level is detected by the electrodes E and F, and the absorbing solution pump<br>
12 is inverter-controlled in the same manner as mentioned above between<br>
the upper- and the lower-limit level.<br>
As to piping, control mechanism, and so on in the absorption type<br>
cold/hot water machine according to the present invention, various changes<br>
may be made and no limitation is made to the above embodiments. The<br>
present invention is applicable to various forms insofar as they do not<br>
depart from the technical scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
ABSORPTION CHILLER-HEATER<br>
An absorption chiller-heater is disclosed wherein an absorbing solution and a<br>
refrigerant are circulated through a high-temperature regenerator (1), a condenser (4), an<br>
evaporator (5) and an absorber (6), interconnected by pipes and a heat operation medium<br>
cooled or heated as a result of having passed through a heat transfer pipe disposed in the<br>
interior of said evaporator (6) is supplied to an air conditioning load to effect cooling or<br>
heating, said absorption chiller-heater comprising: a level detector; an absorbing solution<br>
pump; and a control unit, characterized in that when said level detector detects a<br>
predetermined lower-limit level of the absorbing solution, said absorbing solution pump is<br>
operated for a predetermined time at high speed to increase the amount of the absorbing<br>
solution to be fed into said high-temperature regenerator (1), then when said predetermined<br>
time has been reached or elapsed, it is determined whether said level detector detects said<br>
predetermined lower-limit level of the absorbing solution, and if the level detector detects<br>
again the predetermined lower-limit level of the absorbing solution, both or one issuance of<br>
sounding of a warning and stop of operation of the absorption chiller-heater are/is performed<br>
so as to warn that the predetermined lower-limit level re-detected depends on a continuous<br>
drop in normal state not temporary drop.</td>
