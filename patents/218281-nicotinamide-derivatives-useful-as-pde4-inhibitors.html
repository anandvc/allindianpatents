				<td>This invention relates to nicotinamide derivatives of general formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
in which R1, R2, R3- R4, X, Y, and Z have the meanings indicated below,<br>
and to processes for the preparation of, intermediates used in the preparation of, compositions containing and the uses of, such derivatives.<br>
The 3',5'-cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterases (PDEs) comprise a large class of enzymes divided into at least eleven different families which are structurally, biochemically and pharmacologically distinct from one another. The enzymes within each family are commonly referred to as isoenzymes, or isozymes. A total of more than fifteen gene products is included within this class, and further diversity results from differential splicing and post-translational processing of those gene products. The present invention is primarily concerned with the four gene products of the fourth family of PDEs, i.e., PDE4A, PDE4B, PDE4C, and PDE4D. These enzymes are collectively referred to as being isoforms or subtypes of the PDE4 isozyme family.<br>
The PDE4s are characterized by selective, high affinity hydrolytic degradation of the second messenger cyclic nucleotide, adenosine 3',5'-cyclic monophosphate (cAMP), and by sensitivity to inhibition by rolipram. A number of selective inhibitors of the PDE4s have been discovered in recent years, and beneficial pharmacological effects resulting from that inhibition have been shown in a variety of disease models (see, e.g., Torphy et ai, Environ. Health Perspect ,1994, 102 Suppl. 10, p. 79-84 ; Duplantier et a/., J. Med. Chem., 1996, 39, p. 120-125 ; Schneider et ai, Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav., 1995, 50,<br>
p. 211-217 ; Banner and Page, Br. J. Pharmacol., 1995, 114, p. 93-98 ; Barnette et ai, J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther., 1995, 273, p. 674-679 ; Wright et at., Can. J. Physiol. Pharmacol., 1997, 75, p. 1001-1008 ; Manabe et ai, Eur. J. Pharmacol., 1997, 332, p. 97-107 and Ukita et ai, J. Med. Chem., 1999, 42, p. 1088-1099). Accordingly, there continues to be considerable interest in the art with regard to the discovery of further selective inhibitors of PDE4s.<br>
Successful results have already been obtained in the art with the discovery and development of selective PDE4 inhibitors. In vivo, PDE4 inhibitors reduce the influx of eosinophils to the lungs of allergen-challenged animals while also reducing the bronchoconstriction and elevated bronchial responsiveness occurring after allergen challenge. PDE4 inhibitors also suppress the activity of immune cells (including CD4+ T-lymphocytes, monocytes, mast cells, and basophils), reduce pulmonary edema, inhibit excitatory nonadrenergic noncholinergic neurotransmission (elMANC), potentiate inhibitory nonadrenergic noncholinergic neurotransmission (iNANC), reduce airway smooth muscle mitogenesis, and induce bronchodilation. PDE4 inhibitors also suppress the activity of a number of inflammatory cells associated with the pathophysiology of COPD, including monocytes/macrophages, CD4+ T-lymphocytes, eosinophils and neutrophils. PDE4 inhibitors also reduce vascular smooth muscle mitogenesis and potentially intertere with the ability of airway epithelial cells to generate proinflammatory mediators. Through the release of neutral proteases and acid hydrolases from their granules, and the generation of reactive oxygen species, neutrophils contribute to the tissue destruction associated with chronic inflammation, and are further implicated in the pathology of conditions such as emphysema. Therefore, PDE4 inhibitors are particularly useful for the treatment of a great number of inflammatory, respiratory and allergic diseases, disorders or conditions and for wounds and some of them are in clinical development mainly for tretament of asthma, COPD, bronchitis and emphysema.<br>
The effects of PDE4 inhibitors on various inflammatory cell responses can be used as a basis for profiling and selecting inhibitors for further study.<br>
These effects include elevation of cAMP and inhibition of superoxide production, degranulation, chemotaxis, and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa) release in eosinophils, neutrophils and monocytes.<br>
Some nicotinamide derivatives having a PDE4 inhibitory activity have already been synthetized. For example, the patent application N° WO 98/45268 discloses nicotinamide derivatives having activity as selective inhibitors of PDE4D isozyme. These selective PDE4D inhibitors are represented by the following formula :<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
N2E(CH2)rR5 (O)t wherein r may be equal to 0, (A)m may be oxygen and (B)n may be NH, o may be equal to 0 or 1, R2 and R3 may be taken together with the carbon to which they are attached to form a (C3-C7)cycloalkyl ring, (D)p may be absent or may be -NH- or -N(C1-C6)alkyl-, q may be equal to 0 or 1, R4 may be absent or may represent a carboxy, R1 may be choosen from numerous substituents among which a (C1-C6)alky1, a (C3-C7)cycloalkyl, a (C6-C10)aryl or an (un)saturated (C3-C7)heterocyclic group, wherein each of said cycloalkyl, aryl or heterocycle may be optionally substituted by one to three substitutents.<br>
The patent application N° WO 01/57036 also discloses nicotinamide derivatives which are PDE4 inhibitors useful in the treatment of various inflammatory allergic and respiratory diseases and conditions, of formula :<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
wherein in particular: n is 1 or 2, m is 0 to 2, Y is =C(RE)- or -[N→(O)]-, W is -O-, -S(=O)r or -N(R3)-, Q represents various rings among which the monocyclic (C5-C7)cycloalkyl moieties, Z is -OR12, -C(=O)R12 or CN and R12 is choosen from alkyl, alkenyl, cycloalkyi, phenyl, benzyl and monocyclic heterocyclic moieties.<br>
However, there is still a huge need for additional PDE4 inhibitors showing improved therapeutic index with possibly less adverse effects such as for example emesis.<br>

In the hereabove general formula  (1),  heteroaryl is a  radical of a monocyclic or polycyclic aromatic system having 5 to 14 ring members, which contains 1, 2, 3, 4 or 5 heteroatom(s) depending in number and quality of the total number of ring members. Examples of heteroatoms are nitrogen (N), oxygen (O) and sulphur (S). If several heteroatoms are contained, these can be identical   or   different.    Heteroaryl   radicals   can   also   be    unsubstituted, monosubstituted or polysubstituted, as indicated in the definition of R3 and R* hereabove for general formula (1) according to the present invention. Preferably heteroaryl is a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic radical which contains 1, 2, 3 or 4, in particular 1,2 or 3, identical or different heteroatoms selected from the group consisting of N,  O and  S.  Particularly preferably,  heteroaryl  is a monocyclic or bicyclic aromatic radical  having 5 to 10 ring  members,  in particular a 5-membered to 6-membered monocyclic aromatic radical which contains  (i) from   1   to  4 nitrogen  heteroatom(s) or (ii)  1   or 2   nitrogen heteroatom(s) and 1 oxygen heteroatom or 1 sulphur heteroatom or (iii) 1 or 2 oxygen or sulphur heteroatom(s).

Particularly   preferred   are  the   heteroaryl   radicals   selected   from   pyrrolyl, pyrazolyl, 1,2,3-triazolyl, 1,2,4-triazolyl, tetrazolyl, oxazolyl, isoxazolyl, thiazolyl, isothiazolyl,   1,2,4-oxadiazolyl,   1,3,4-oxadiazolyl,   furanyl,   thienyl,   pyridinyl, pyridazinyl, pyrimidinyl, and pyrazinyl. Nitrogen heteroaryl radicals can also be present as N-oxides or as quaternary salts.<br>
In the general formula (1) according to the present invention, when a radical is mono- or poly-substituted, said substituent(s) can be located at any desired position(s). Also, when a radical is polysubstituted, said substituents can be identical or different, unless otherwise stated.<br>
The nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) can be prepared using conventional procedures such as by the following illustrative methods in which R-i, R2, R3, R4. X, Y, and Z are as previously defined for the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) unless otherwise stated.<br>
Where Z in the general formula (1) represents a group of partial formula (1.9) through (1.15), the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) may be prepared starting from a compound of formula (2.1):<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
where R1, R2, X, R3 and Y are as previously described for the nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1).<br>
Where Z represents a group of partial formula (1.11), (1.12) or (1.14), the compounds of formula (2.1) may be reacted with the corresponding R4-sulfonyl chloride derivative (R4SO2CI or R4NHSO2CI or R4C(=O)NHSO2CI) in a suitable solvent (e.g. dichloromethane) and in the presence of an organic base (e.g. triethylamine) at a temperature ranging from 0°C to room temperature (about 20°C).<br>
Where Z represents a group of partial formula (1.9), (1.13) or (1.15), the compounds of formula (2.1) may be reacted with the corresponding R4-carboxylic acid derivative (R4COOH or R4SO2NH-CH2-COOH or R4C(=O)NH-CH2-COOH) using an activating agent in the presence of a suitable solvent (e.g.<br>
dimethylformamide) and organic  base  (e.g.  N-methyimorpholine) at  room temperature. Activation of the acid may be achieved by using for example :<br>
a)	1-hydroxybenzotriazole and 1-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride, or<br>
b)	carbonyldiimidazole, or<br>
c)	oxalyl   chloride   and   dimethylformamide   (with   dichloromethane   as   the solvent), or<br>
d)	o-(7-azabenzotriazol-1 -yl)-N,N,N',N'-tetramethyluronium      hexafluorophos-phate (HATU reagent).<br>
Where Z represents a group of partial formula (1.10), the compounds of formula (2.1) may be reacted with carbonyldiimidazole in a suitable solvent (such as dichloromethane) or with a phosgene equivalent (such as triphosgene) and the obtained intermediate is reacted with an amine bearing the substituent R4.<br>
It must be emphasized that when R3 and R4 in the nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1) represent alkoxy substituted phenyl rings, these structures can be converted to the hydroxy analogue using certain deprotection conditions well-known by the one skilled in the art. Similarly when R4 contains an ester functionality, these structures can be easily converted to the carboxylic acid by simple saponification using alkali metal hydroxides well-known by the one skilled in the art.<br>

In a typical procedure the nicotinate ester of the formula (6) may be reacted with the appropriate alcohol, thiol or amine of formula R3XH (7) in the appropriate solvent (for example dimethylformamide or dioxan) containing a base, such as cesium carbonate, at temperatures ranging from room temperature to 100°C to give a compound of the formula (5.1). This can be saponified with an alkali-hydroxide to give an acid of the formula (4.1) which is then   converted  to  a  compound   of the  formula  (3)  by  reaction  with  a<br>
monoprotected diamine of the formula NH2-Y-Prot, using an activating agent such as those described in one of the activation methods outlined before (i.e. a) 1 -hydroxybenzotriazole and 1 -(3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride or b) carbonyldiimidazole or c) oxalyl chloride and dimethylformamide or d) HATU reagent with dichloromethane as the solvent).<br>

For some of the steps of the here above described process of preparation of the nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1), it can be necessary to protect the potential reactive functions that are not wished to react. In such a case, any compatible protecting radical can be used. In particular methods such as those described by T.W. GREENE (Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, A.

Particularly preferred examples of the nicotinamide derivatives compounds of the formula (1) are as described in the Examples section hereafter.<br>
The nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1) may also be optionally transformed in pharmaceutically acceptable salts. In particular, these pharmaceutically acceptable salts of the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) include the acid addition and the base salts thereof.<br>
Suitable acid addition salts are formed from mineral or organic non-toxic acids which form non-toxic salts. Suitable examples of these acid addition salts are the hydrochloride, hydrobromide, hydroiodide, sulphate, bisulphate, nitrate, phosphate, hydrogen phosphate, acetate, maleate, fumarate, lactate, tartrate, citrate, gluconate, succinate, saccharate, benzoate, methanesulphonate, ethanesulphonate, benzenesulphonate, p-toluenesulphonate and pamoate salts.<br>
Suitable base salts are formed from bases, which form non-toxic salts, such as alkali metal salts, earth metal salts or addition salts with ammonia and physiologically tolerable organic amines. Suitable examples of these base salts are the sodium, potassium, aluminium, calcium, magnesium, zinc or ammonium salts as well as addition salts with triethylamine, ethanolamine, diethanolamine, trimethylamine, methylamine, propylamine, diisopropylamine, N,N-dimethylethanolamine, benzylamine, dicylohexylamine, N-benzyl-B-phenethylamine, N,N'-dibenzylethylenediamine, diphenylenediamine, quinine, choline, arginine, lysine, leucine, dibenzylamine, tris(2-hydroxyethyl)amine, or a,a,a-tris(hydroxymethyl)methylamine.<br>
Compounds, which contain both acidic groups and basic groups can also be present in the form of internal salts or betaines, which are also included by the present invention. For a review on suitable salts see Berge et al. J. Pharm. Sci., 66, 1-19, 1977.<br>
Salts can generally be obtained from the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) according to customary procedures known to the person skilled in the art, for example by combining with an organic or inorganic acid or base solvent or dispersant, or alternatively from other salts by anion exchange or cation exchange. The salt may precipitate from solution and be collected by filtration or may be recovered by evaporation of the solvent.<br>
The nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) can also be present in stereoisomeric forms. If the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) contain one or more centers of asymmetry, these can independently of one another have the (S) configuration or the (R) configuration. The invention includes all possible stereoisomers of the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1), for example enantiomers and diastereomers, and mixtures of two or more stereoisomeric forms, for example mixtures of enantiomers and/or diastereomers, in all ratios. The invention thus relates to enantiomers in enantiomerically pure form, both as levorotatory and dextrorotatory antipodes, in the form of racemates and in the form of mixtures of the two enantiomers in all ratios. The invention likewise relates to diastereomers in diastereomerically pure form and in the form of mixtures in all ratios. In the presence of cis/trans isomerism, the invention relates to both the cis form and the trans form and mixtures of these forms in all ratios. Individual stereoisomers can be prepared, if desired, by use of stereochemically homogeneous starting substances in the synthesis, by stereoselective synthesis or by separation of a mixture according to customary methods, for example by chromatography, crystallization or by chromatography on chiral phases. If appropriate, derivatization can be carried out before separation of stereoisomers. A stereoisomer mixture can be separated at the stage of the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) or at the stage of a starting substance or of an intermediate in the course of the synthesis.<br>
The compounds of the formula (1) according to the invention can moreover contain mobile hydrogen atoms, i.e. be present in various tautomeric forms. The present invention also relates to all tautomers of the compounds of the formula (1).<br>
The present invention furthermore includes other types of derivatives of nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1), for example, solvates such as hydrates and polymorphs, i.e. the various different crystalline structures of the nicotinamide derivatives according to the present invention.<br>
The present invention also includes all suitable isotopic variations of the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof. An isotopic variation of the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is defined as one in which at least one atom is replaced by an atom having the same atomic number but an atomic mass different from the atomic mass usually found in nature. Examples of isotopes that can be incorporated into the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof include isotopes of hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur, fluorine and chlorine such as 2H, 3H, 13C, 14C, 15N, 17O, 18O, 35S, 18F and 36CI, respectively. Certain isotopic variations    of   the    nicotinamide    derivatives    of   the   formula    (1)    and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof, for example, those in which a radioactive isotope such as 3H or 14C is incorporated, are useful in drug and/or substrate tissue distribution studies. Tritiated, i.e., 3H, and carbon-14, i.e., i4C, isotopes are particularly preferred for their ease of preparation and detectability. Further, substitution with isotopes such as deuterium, i.e., 2H, may afford certain therapeutic advantages resulting from greater metabolic stability, for example, increased in vivo half-life or reduced dosage requirements and hence may   be   preferred   in   some   circumstances.   Isotopic   variations   of  the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) and pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof of this invention can generally be prepared by conventional procedures such as by the illustrative methods or by the preparations described in the Examples and Preparations sections hereafter using appropriate isotopic variations of suitable reagents.<br>
If appropriate, the present invention also concerns the active metabolites of the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1), i.e. the derivatives which are formed during the cellular metabolism and that are active on organism. For<br>
example, such metabolites can be glucuronide derivatives, N-oxide derivatives or sulfonate derivatives of the compounds of the formula (1).<br>
According to a further aspect, the present invention concerns mixtures of nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1), as well as mixtures with or of their pharmaceuticaHy acceptable salts, solvates, polymorphs, isomeric forms, metabolites and/or isotope forms.<br>
According to the present invention, all the here above mentioned forms of the nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1) except the pharmaceuticaHy acceptable salts (i.e. said solvates; polymorphs, isomeric forms, metabolites and isotope forms), are defined as "derived forms" of the nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1) in what follows.<br>
The nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1), their pharmaceuticaHy acceptable salts and/or derived forms, are valuable pharmaceutical active compounds, which are suitable for the therapy and prophylaxis of numerous disorders in which the PDE4 enzymes are involved, in particular the inflammatory disorders, allergic disorders, respiratory diseases and wounds. The nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1) and their pharmaceuticaHy acceptable salts and derived forms as mentioned above can be administered according to the invention to animals, preferably to mammals, and in particular to humans, as pharmaceuticals for therapy or prophylaxis. They can be administered per se, in mixtures with one another or in the form of pharmaceutical preparations which permit enteral (gastric) or parenteral (non-gastric) administration and which as active constituent contain an efficacious dose of at least one nicotinamide derivative of the formula (1), its pharmaceuticaHy acceptable salts and/or derived forms, in addition to customary pharmaceuticaHy innocuous excipients and/or additives.<br>
Thus, the present invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing an efficacious dose of at least one nicotinamide derivative of formula (1) and/or their pharmaceuticaHy acceptable salts and/or derived forms, in addition to customary pharmaceuticaHy innocuous excipients and/or additives.<br>
Such compositions are prepared according to well-known methods compatible with the standard pharmaceutical practice. Said composition generally contain from 0.5 % to 60 % in weight of the active compound and from 40 % to 99.5 % in weight of excipients and/or additives. According to the present invention, said excipients and/or additives are agents well known to the artisan for providing favourable properties in the final pharmaceutical composition. Typical excipients and/or additives include, but are by no mean limited to, acidifying and alkalizing agents, aerosol propellants, anti-microbial agents (including antibacterial, anti-fungal and anti-protozoal agents), antioxidants, buffering agents, chelating agents, dermatologically active agents, dispersing agents, suspending agents, emollients, emulsifying agents, penetration enhancers, preservatives, sequestering agents, solvents, stabilizers, stiffening agents, sugars, surfactants and flavouring agents. Furthermore, said compositions are prepared in a form compatible for the intended route of administration, which is used for any given patient, as well as appropriate to the disease, disorder or condition for which any given patient is being treated. Suitable routes of administration that can be envisaged are enteral and parenteral routes of adiministration, such as for example the topical, oral, intranasal, pulmonary, rectal, intra-veinous, intraarterial, intra-peritoneal, intra-thecal, intra-ventricular, intra-urethral, intra-sternal, intra-cranial, intra-muscular, subcutaneous or ocular routes.<br>
When an administration by the oral route is intended, the nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or their derived forms, can be administered in the form of tablets, capsules, multiparticulates, gels, films, ovules, elixirs, solutions or suspensions, which may contain flavouring or colouring agents, for immediate-, delayeC1-, modifieC1-, sustaineC1-, pulseC1- or controlleC1-release applications. The nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or their derived forms, may also be administered as fast-dispersing or fast-dissolving dosage forms or in the form of a high energy dispersion or as coated particles. Suitable formulations of the nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or their derived forms, may be in coated or uncoated form, as desired.<br>
Such solid pharmaceutical compositions, for example, tablets, may contain excipients such as microcrystalline cellulose, lactose, sodium citrate, calcium carbonate, dibasic calcium phosphate, glycine and starch (preferably corn, potato or tapioca starch), disintegrants such as sodium starch glycoliate, croscarmellose sodium and certain complex silicates, and granulation binders such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydroxypropylcellulose (HPC), sucrose, gelatin and acacia. Additionally, lubricating agents such as magnesium stearate, stearic acid, glyceryl behenate and talc may be included.<br>
As a general example, a formulation of the tablet could typically contain between about 0.01 mg and 500 mg of active compound whilst tablet fill weights may range from 50 mg to 1000 mg. The tablets may be manufactured by a standard process, for example direct compression or a wet or dry granulation process. The tablet cores may be coated with appropriate overcoats.<br>
Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in gelatin or HPMC capsules. Preferred excipients in this regard Include lactose, starch, a cellulose, milk sugar or high molecular weight polyethylene glycols. For aqueous suspensions and/or elixirs, the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or their derived forms* may be combined with various sweetening or flavouring agents, colouring matter or dyes, with emulsifying and/or suspending agents and with diluents such as water, ethanol, propylene glycol and glycerin, and combinations thereof.<br>
The nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or their derived forms, can also be administered by injection, for example, intravenously, intra-arterially, intraperitoneally, intrathecally, intraventricularly, intraurethrally, intrasternally, intracranially, intramuscularly or subcutaneously, or they may be administered by infusion or needleless injection techniques. For such administration they are best used in<br>
the form of a sterile aqueous solution which may contain other substances, for example, enough salts or glucose to make the solution isotonic with blood. The aqueous solutions should be suitably buffered (preferably to a pH of from 3 to 9), if necessary. The preparation of such formulations under sterile conditions is readily accomplished by standard pharmaceutical techniques well-known to those skilled in the art.<br>
For both oral administration and injection to human patients, the daily dosage level of the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or their derived forms, will usually be from 0.001 mg/kg to 100 mg/kg (in single or divided doses).<br>
The nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1), their pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts and/or their derived forms, can also be administered intra<br>
nasally or by inhalation and are conveniently delivered in the form of a dry<br>
powder inhaler or an aerosol spray presentation from a pressurised container,<br>
pump, spray, atomiser or nebuliser, with or without the use of a suitable<br>
propellant,	e.g.	dichlorodifluoromethane,	trichlorofluoromethane,<br>
dichlorotetrafluoroethane, a hydrofluoroalkane such as 1,1,1,2-tetrafluoroethane (HFA 134A [trade mark]) or 1,1,1,2,3,3,3-heptafluoropropane (HFA 227EA [trade mark]), carbon dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case ol a pressurised aerosol, the dosage unit may be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. The pressurised container, pump, spray, atomiser or nebuliser may contain a solution or suspension of the active compound, e.g. using a mixture of ethanol and the propellant as the solvent, which may additionally contain a lubricant, e.g. sorbitan trioleate. Capsules and cartridges {made, for example, from gelatin) for use in an inhaler or insufflator may be formulated to contain a powder mix of a nicotinamide derivative of the formula (1) and a suitable powder base such as lactose or starch.<br>
Aerosol or dry powder formulations are preferably arranged so that each metered dose or "puff contains from 1 ng to 4000 pg of a nicotinamide derivative of the formula (1) for delivery to the patient. The overall daily dose<br>
with an aerosol will be in the range of from 1 µg to 20 mg, which may be administered in a single dose or, more usually, in divided doses throughout the day.<br>
The nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or their derived forms, can also be administered topically, or transdermally, in the form of creams, gels, suspensions, lotions, ointments, dusting   powders,   sprays,   foams,   mousses,   drug-incorporated   dressings, solutions, sponges, fibres, microemulsions, films, skin patches, ointments such as petrolatum or white soft paraffin based ointments or via a skin patch or other device. Penetration enhancers may be used, and the compound may be used in combination with cyclodextrins. In addition, the compound may be delivered using iontophoresis, electropration, phonophoresis or sonophoresis. They could be administered directly onto a wound site. They could be incorporated into a coated suture. For example they can be incorporated into a lotion or cream consisting   of   an   aqueous   or   oily   emulsion   of   mineral   oils,   sorbitan monostearate,   polysorbate   60,   cetyl   esters   wax,   cetearyl   alcohol,   2-octyldodecanol,   benzyl   alcohol,   water,   polyethylene  glycols  and/or  liquid paraffin, or they can be incorporated into a suitable ointment consisting of one or more of the following : mineral oil, liquid petrolatum, white petrolatum, propylene glycol, polyoxyethylene polyoxypropylene compound, emulsifying wax and water, or as hydrogel with cellulose or polyacrylate derivatives or other viscosity modifiers, or as a dry powder or liquid spray or aerosol with butane/propane, HFA, CFC, CO2 or other suitable propellant, optionally also including a lubricant such as sorbitan trioleate, or as a drug-incorporated dressing either as a tulle dressing, with white soft paraffin or polyethylene glycols impregnated gauze dressings or with hydrogel, hydrocolloid, alginate or film dressings.<br>
For topical administration to human patients with acute/surgical wounds or scars, the daily dosage level of the compounds, in suspension or other formulation, could be from 0.01 to 50 mg/ml, preferably from 0.3 to 30 mg/ml.<br>
The dosage will vary with the size of the wound, whether or not the wound is open or closed or partially closed, and whether or not the skin is intact.<br>
Alternatively, the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or their derived forms, can be rectally administered, for example in the form of a suppository of a gel, although other forms can be considered.<br>
They may also be administered via the ocular route, in particular for ocular scarring. For ophthalmic use, the compounds can be formulated as micronised suspensions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, or, preferably, as solutions in isotonic, pH adjusted, sterile saline, optionally in combination with a preservative such as a benzylalkonium chloride. Alternatively, they may be formulated in an ointment such as petrolatum.<br>
The various pharmaceutical formulations as decribed here above are also detailed in "Pharmacie galenique" from A. Lehir (Ed. Mason, 1992, 2nd edition).<br>
The physician in any event will determine the actual dosage which will be most suitable for any individual patient and it will vary with the age, weight, health state and sex of the patient as well as the severity of the disease, disorder or condition to treat, the optional combination with other treatment(s), the response of the particular patient and in general any factor peculiar to the concerned disease, disorder or condition and to the patient. Thus, the daily dose among men may usually contain from 50 mg to 5 g of active compound for administration singly or two or more at a time, as appropriate. There can, of course, be individual instances where higher or lower dosage ranges are merited and such are within the scope of this invention.<br>
According to the present invention, the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or their derived forms, may also be used in combination with a cyclodextrin. Cyclodextrins are known to form inclusion and non-inclusion complexes with drug molecules. Formation<br>
of a drug-cyclodextrin complex may modify the solubility, dissolution rate, bioavailability and/or stability property of a drug molecule. Drug-cyclodextrin complexes are generally useful for most dosage forms and administration routes. As an alternative to direct complexation with the drug the cyclodextrin may be used as an auxiliary additive, e.g. as a carrier, diluent or solubiliser. a-, p- and y-cyclodextrins are most commonly used and suitable examples are described in WO-A-91/11172, WO-A-94/02518 and WO-A-98/55148.<br>
According to another embodiment of the present invention, the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or their derived forms, can also be used as a combination with one or more additional therapeutic agents to be co-administered to a patient to obtain some particularly desired therapeutic end result. The second and more additional therapeutic agents may also be a nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or their derived forms, or one or more PDE4 inhibitors known in the art. More typically, the second and more therapeutic agents will be selected from a different class of therapeutic agents.<br>

It is to be appreciated that all references herein to treatment include curative, palliative and prophylactic treatment. The description which follows concerns the therapeutic applications to which the nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1) may be put.<br>
The nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1) inhibit the PDE4 isozyme and thereby have a wide range of therapeutic applications, as described further below, because of the essential role, which the PDE4 family of isozymes plays in the physiology of all mammals. The enzymatic role performed by the PDE4 isozymes is the intracellular hydrolysis of adenosine 3',5'-monophosphate (cAMP) within pro-inflammatory leukocytes. cAMP, in turn, is responsible for mediating the effects of numerous hormones in the body, and as a consequence, PDE4 inhibition plays a significant role in a variety of physiological processes. There is extensive literature in the art describing the effects of PDE inhibitors on various inflammatory cell responses, which in addition to cAMP increase, include inhibition of superoxide production, degranulation, chemotaxis and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) release in eosinophils, neutrophils and monocytes.<br>
Therefore, a further aspect of the present invention relates to the use of the nicotinamide derivatives of formula (1), their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or derived forms, in the treatment of diseases, disorders, and conditions in which the PDE4 isozymes are involved.

In vitro activity of the nicotinamide derivatives<br>
The PDE4 inhibitory activity of the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) is determined by the ability of compounds to inhibit the hydrolysis of cAMP to AMP by PDE4 (see also reference 1). Tritium labelled cAMP is incubated with PDE4. Following incubation, the radiolabelled AMP produced is able to bind ytrium silicate SPA beads. These SPA beads subsequently produce light that can be quantified by scintillation counting. The addition of a PDE4 inhibitor prevents the formation of AMP from cAMP and counts are diminished. The IC50 of a PDE4 inhibitor can be defined as the concentration of a compound that leads to a 50% reduction in counts compared to the PDE4 only (no inhibitor) control wells.<br>
The anti-inflammatory properties of the nicotinamide derivatives of the formula (1) are demonstrated by their ability to inhibit TNFa release from human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (see also reference 2). Venous blood is collected from healthy volunteers and the mononuclear cells purified by centrifugation through Histopaque (Ficoll) cushions. TNFa production from these cells is stimulated by addition of lipopolysaccharide. After 18 hours incubation in the presence of LPS, the cell supernatant is removed and the concentration of TNFa in the supernatant determined by ELISA. Addition of PDE4 inhibitors reduces the amount of TNFa produced. An ICso is determined which is equal to the concentration of compound that gives 50% inhibition of TNFa production as compared to the LPS stimulated control wells.<br>
Ali the examples were tested in the assay described above and found to have an IC50 (TNFa screen) of less than 300 nM. And for most of the tested compounds, they were found to have an IC50 (TNFa screen) of even less than 100 nM.<br>
For illustrating purpose, the following table indicates the exact IC50 (TNFa screen) of some representative examples of the present invention :<br><br>
