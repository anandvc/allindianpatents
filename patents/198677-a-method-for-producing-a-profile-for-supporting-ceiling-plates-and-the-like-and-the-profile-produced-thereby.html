				<td>This invention relates to a method for making a profile for supporting ceiling plates and the like, which profile shows a continuous fixation strip, a body and wings upon which the plates or the like rest.<br>
The object of the invention is to develop a method that allows to make profiles of the said type that are characterised by an up till now in that field never attained material saving and that, despite their lighter weight, still have a sufficient inertia <br>
To make this possible according to the invention, it is started, to form the body of the profile, from at least one metal band wherein a series of incisions are applied in the longitudinal, respecti¬vely transversal direction, whereafter the metal band is pulled in the transversal, respectively the longitudinal direction, to an open structure.<br>
According to a possible embodiment the continuous fixation strip and the above mentioned wings are formed from the above mentioned metal band whereaf¬ter the metal band, wherein series of incisions were provided in the longitudinal direction, is pulled in the transversal direction to an open structure.<br>
Still according to this embodiment use is made of two metal bands that show applied incisions in the longitudinal direction and each metal band shows a wing for supporting a plate or the like and a wing for making the above mentioned continuous fixation strip, both the metal bands are placed back to back against each other, above mentioned wings are covered with a<br><br>
finishing strip and finally the part to the metal strip that forms the body is pulled transversally with respect to said incisions.<br>
According to a variant, use is made of two metal bands that show applied incisions in the longitu¬dinal direction and each metal band shows a wing for supporting a plate and a wing for making above mentioned continuous fixation strip, the portion of the metal band that forms the body is pulled transversally with respect to said incisions and only after that two thus processed metal bands are placed back to back against each other and said wings are covered with a fixation strip.<br>
The invention also concerns the obtained profiles according to the different methods.<br>
Further details and advantages of the invention will appear from the following description of different methods for making a profile for hanging up ceiling plates and of the thus obtained profiles. This description is only given by way of example and does not limit the invention. The reference numerals refer to the hereto annexed figures.<br>
Figures 1 to 4 illustrate the consecutive steps for forming a profile according to the invention.<br>
Figures 5 to 8 illustrate a variant of the method for making a profile.<br>
Figures 9 to 11 illustrate a variant of the method for making a profile.<br>
Figures 12 to 14 illustrate a method for making a profile according to yet another variant.<br>
Figures 15 to 17 illustrate a method for making a profile according to another technique.<br>
Figures 18 to 20 relate to a last variant for making a profile with an open structure.<br>
The method explained by the different figures makes it possible to make very light profiles<br><br>
that show a sufficient inertia, such as already explai¬ned in the introduction.<br>
Different steps for the abstention of such profiles that are essentially characterised by their open structure are described hereafter.<br>
According to a first method, explained by figures 1 to 4, and that can be considered as very similar to the method according to figures 5-8, one starts from a metal band 1 wherein parallel series of incisions 2 are applied in the longitudinal direction of this strip.<br>
The incisions only appear in the area that will form the body of the profile in the following step.<br>
Referring to figure 2 one notices that the longitudinal edges of the metal band are bent in order to form the wings 3 and 4.<br>
The next step (figure 3) consists in assembling two identical metal bands placed back to back against each other with their wings 3 and 4 and the connection of these two metal bands by means of finish¬ing strips 5 and 6. The finishing strip 5 makes, with the wings 3, a continuous fixation strip for supporting the finished profile. The finishing strip 6 forms with the wings 4 a means to support the ceiling plates or the like.<br>
The metal band in its finished condition such as illustrated in figure 3, is then pulled in the transversal direction of the strip 1 to form a profile whereof the body shows an open structure such as shown in figure 4. The open structure of the body of the profile is shown in figure 4 with the reference 7.<br>
The figures 5 to 8 are related to a method<br>
that is narrowly connected with the just described<br>
embodiment. Here also it is started from a metal band 1<br>
with longitudinally applied series  of incisions  2<br>
(figure 5).<br><br>
The following step consists in making the wings 3 and 4. Immediately thereafter the metal band is pulled transversally to make a profile whereof the body 7 shows an open structure.<br>
By placing two metal bands with an open structure back to back against each other such as shown in figure 7, the structure according to figure 8 ap¬pears. At this stage a finishing strip 5, respectively 6, is each time slit over the wings 3 and 4 of both metal bands with an open structure. The finishing strip can also be applied by bending a material strip over the wings 3 and 4. This material can be metal or a synthetic material.<br>
A profile that lightly deviates from the obtained profiles according to the just described method is illustrated by the figures 9 to 11. The profile illustrated in figure 11 is generated from a single strip 1 with rows of incisions 2.<br>
Above and underneath wings 4' , respective¬ly 4" are formed from the metal band 1. In the following step the open structure illustrated by figure 11 is formed by transversally pulling the metal band with respect to the incisions 2. The profile described here is thus single and is not generated from the assembling of two identical profiles such as was the case for the method described by figures 1-8.<br>
The method described by figures 12 to 14 shows how to proceed from a single metal band 1 wherein an incision 2 is applied in two areas. In a following step (figure 13) the metal strip 1 is bent in such a way that the areas wherein the incisions 2 appear are precisely superposed whereas the continuous hollow chamber 8 and the wings 4 are formed by the bending. The finishing strip 6 is applied over these wings. After this manipulation the metal band 1 is pulled transver¬sally in the longitudinal direction wherein the inky-<br><br>
scions 2 extend, in order to form the already earlier described open structure 7.<br>
A variant of the method according to the invention that makes it possible to simultaneously form the open structure from the metal band with the necessa¬ry wings, is explained by figures 15 to 17.<br>
Once again it is proceeded from a metal band 1 with rows of incisions 2 extending in the trans¬versal direction of the strip.<br>
The remarkable of the method which is explained here by figures 15 to 17 is related to the above and underneath making of the equivalent of the already earlier described wings 4, 4' and 4". The wings are generated here by the application of flanges 9, respectively 9' in the metal band 1 transversally with respect to the direction wherein the incisions 2 extend. Above and underneath the flanges 9, respectively 9', are bent every other time along the left and the right of the area wherein the body of the profile extends. Over the flanges 9, respectively 9', finishing strips 5, respectively 6 are applied. This can occur i.e. by bending a metal band or a plastic band over these flanges.<br>
In the following step the desired open structure 7 is formed by the necessary traction force exerted transversally with respect to the direction wherein the incisions 2 extend on the metal band.<br>
A last variant that makes it possible to process the profile to an open structure is explained by the figures 18 to 20. Contrarily to the up till now described techniques, incisions 2' are applied to the metal band 1 and in the transversal direction of the profile, which profile shows a greatly reduced length. The making of the open structure 7' (figures 19 and 20) occurs by exerting on the metal band 1 with the trans¬versal incisions 2' a traction force in the longitudinal<br><br>
direction of the profile that generates a metallic open structure such as illustrated in figure 19. Along one extremity this open structure shows surfaces 10 whereof the form and the dimensions are dependent on the applied technique for the generation of the used open structure.<br>
With these surfaces 10 the open structure 7' is connected with the continuous fixation strip 11 in the form of a hollow profile. Said surfaces can be pressed into said profile 11 and fixed herein. The open structure 7' will be formed, with its opposite free edge, by the tops 12 of the diamonds or rectangles that characterise the open structure, connected with a lengthwise profile 13. This profile 13 is covered with a finishing strip 6 and thus forms the two wings whereon the ceiling plates or the like will rest.<br>
From the above mentioned given description of the method for making a profile for hanging up ceiling plates and the like and from the therefrom generated profiles it appears that an up till now never attained weight saving can be obtained, whereas the generated profiles by application of the different methods will however have the desired inertia.<br>
It is clear that the invention is not limited to the here above described embodiments and that changes can be brought for so far that they fall in the scope of the hereto annexed claims.<br><br><br>
