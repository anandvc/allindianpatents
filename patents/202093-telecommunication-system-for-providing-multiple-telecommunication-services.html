The present invention concerns a telecommunication system for providing multiple telecommunication services (ISDN, ADSL, POTS) to residential customers each of which being separately connected to access points in a central telecommunication office by single copper access wires, the access points corresponding respectively to the telecommunication service required by the customer.<br>
Copper wires, mainly twisted wire pairs between the telephone central office and different end users of telecommunication services have more information capacity than that used for voice services. Several baseband and passband transmission systems, collectively referred to as xDSL, have been developed over the past decade that enable up to several megabits per second of data to be carried over telephone twisted pair loops, i.e. already in-place telephone-company copper cables. Twisted pair telephone wires cover the access to the telecommunication system of a large amount of customers worldwide. These twisted pair copper cables are used for the connection of different end users with a central office. The development of the new signal processing techniques was thus directed to the objective to use these in-place copper cables instead of substituting them by data transmission lines with a higher bandwidth (i.e. glas fibers) . Organizing signals, e.g. into ATM (Asynchronous Transfer Mode) cells allows data, voice and video signals to be carried in a common xDSL payload.<br><br>
The use of xDSL technology for high speed transmission on telephone twisted pairs has been discussed recently ("Systems Considerations for the Use of xDSL Technology for Data Access", George T. Hawley, IEEE Communications Magazine March 1997, pp. 56 to 60). xDSL signals are designed to maximize the rate of transmission of digital signals through subcategories of nonloaded twisted pairs, making use of bandwidths that can be greater than 1 MHz. There are several types of xDSL signal in commercial use or in trials today. Each signal type is implemented in circuitry with accompanying software, called a transceiver. The transceiver must be adapted to convert serial binary data streams into a form suitable for transmission through twisted wire pairs. The transceivers may also employ various signal processing, equalization, amplification, and shaping techniques to adapt transmission for physical attenuation and phase distortion impairments experienced by signals transmitted through twisted wire pairs.<br>
The term xDSL is a generic term for a number of similar forms of digital subscriber line (DSL) technologies. The "x" in xDSL is actually filled in with a letter depending on the technology implemented. The major types of xDSL categories are:<br>
-	High-bit-rate Digital Subscriber Line (HDSL),<br>
-	Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (ASDL).<br>
While the HDSL is a symmetrical data transmission technology that was first extensively applied for transmitting 1,544 Mb/s signals through two pairs of wire, HDSL is also being modified to work over a single<br><br>
copper telephone line to provide direct premises connections between a customer and its serving central office with a speed of 384 Kbps or 768 Kbps.<br>
Alternatively, the ADSL, Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line has been developed with respect to the demand for multimegabit data transports to allow a high speed Internet access and the ability to purchase video movies on demand. Both of these applications are asymmetric in nature, demanding a multimegabit downstream delivery to the consumer, but only a small upstream link into the network to transmit basic commands or the occasional email. ADSL offers downstream rates in excess of 6 Mbps and simultaneous duplex transmissions of 640 Kbps over copper lines.<br>
In a transceiver adapted to ADSL technology comprised at each end of a twisted pair telephone line, three information channels are created: a high speed downstream channel, a medium speed duplex channel and a so called POTS (Plain Old Telephone Service) channel, the latter being split off from the digital modem by filters. Thus the voice signal is isolated in order to be independent from the power source for the modem. This guarantees uninterrupted POTS connections, even if the ADSL connection or outside power fails.<br>
Fig. la to Id illustrate different types of known connection types for a copper wire, e.g. twisted pair, connection between a central office and a customer.<br>
Fig. la shows the simple case in which the customer is connected to the central office by a nonloaded twisted pair line.<br><br>
Fig. lb shows an xDSL connection in its simplest form consisting of two transceivers TU-C, TU-R, one at each end of the twisted pair. This configuration is typical of many early HDSL applications.<br>
Fig. Ic shows the typical configuration for the earliest ADSL application, with ADSL transceivers at each end of a line connected through a splitter/filter in order to be able to share the line with a voice telephone service. The splitter/filter circuit may be active or passive, although passive is preferred as being a lesser reliability risk to the lifeline telephone service sharing the twisted pair.<br>
Fig. Id is a more illustrative example of the emerging ADSL access systems with the ADSL central office transceivers integrated into an asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) access multiplexer.<br>
In a telecommunication system of the kind discussed above the access point of the requested telecommunication service, i.e. ISDN or ADSL, is permanently connected to the access wire of the respective customer. If a customer wishs to change the service, the permanent connection in the central office must be disabled and substituted by the permanent connection for the new service.<br>
It is the object of the present invention to improve the known telecommunication system in order to make it easier to change from one telecommunication service to another for the end customer.<br>
This object is achieved by modifying the known telecommunication system by an analog signal switching device for selectively allocating different<br><br>
telecommunication services access points to the customer access wire.<br>
The device according to the present invention allows to switch the access wire originating from the device of the end user (customer) of the telecommunication service to the appropriate, i.e. user selected service access point in the telecommunications network. This allows for a flexible provisioning of different telecommunication services, like POTS, ISDN, ADSL to the end user by allowing a data transmission via the in-place telephone cable, e.g. twisted pair. If the customer wants to use a specific service, e.g. ADSL, the device according to the invention switches the ADSL signal to the access point of the ADSL service network. If the customer wants to change from one service to another, the device switches the signal to another destination, namely the access point of the corresponding service.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention the allocation of the service access points to several end users is based on the principle of dynamic, statistical on demand allocation. This means that the signal of the customer is able to activate the certain required service and that the corresponding way is connected to the selected access-point. This allows optimal utilization of the network recources because the service access points are allocated in a statistical manner. E.g., 100 service access points may serve e.g. 1000 end users so that the blocking probability due to insufficient resources is very low.<br>
In another preferred embodiment the switching device comprises a switching matrix, preferably a relay<br><br>
switching matrix. In this embodiment the relays may be controlled by the telecommunication network management.<br>
As an alternative, the switching device may be an optical switch adapted to the used technology.<br>
Alternatively, the switching device comprises means for shifting the frequency band of the telecommunication signal. By shifting the frequency bands, several signals can be multiplexed on a single carrier. This allows to use the POTS technology (frequency 0-4 KHz), the ISDN technology (0-80 KHz) and the ASDL technology (about 640 KHz upstream and above 1000 KHz downstream) on single a carrier. In this case the service access points are corresponding to the frequency bands on the shared carrier.<br>
The present invention is illustrated from the following drawings:<br>
Fig. 1 shows a sketch illustrating twisted wire pair connections known from prior art<br>
Fig. 2 shows a first embodiment according to the present invention;<br>
Fig. 3 shows a second embodiment according to the present invention.<br>
Referring to Fig. 2, a variety of customers is connected by twisted pair copper cables to a POTS interface card being part of the central office in a telecommunication system.<br><br>
At another input of the central office, different telecommunication services, like xDSL, ISDN and POTS are offered to the customer, while xDSL means ADSL or HDSL services.<br>
The voice transmission line (POTS, Plain Old Telephone Service) is also comprised in the central office.<br>
As can be seen in Fig. 2, for each customer line, network management controlled relays are comprised in order to allocate for each customer the desired service.<br>
Starting from the access wire of a customer, the first switch of the relay matrix switches between the POTS service and the different other broadband services (ADSL, ISDN). The relays following in the hierarchy, allocate the respective broadband service to the customer.<br>
Upon the selection of the respective customer, the relays may be controlled separately by the network management thus allowing for the system to freely allocate to each customer the required telecommunication service.<br>
If the end user (customer) wants to use another service, the relays are switched accordingly and a connection to the access point of the corresponding service is achieved.<br>
Fig. 3 shows a second embodiment of the present invention. This embodiment refers to the case, that different customers connected by separate twisted pair access wires to the central office want to share the same telecommunication service, namely ADSL.<br><br>
In this case all separate customer lines are connected in parallel with a switch matrix which allocates the ADSL shared recources to the customer. The connection to the free ADSL recources is achieved according to the "activity" of the customer.<br><br><br>
