 <br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
Referring now to the drawings wherein the showings are for the purpose of illustrating a preferred embodiment of the invention only, and not for the purpose of limiting the same.<br>
In accordance with this invention, An object handling Device for Clamping, Unclamping, Lifting &amp; Moving-Objects comprising; base plate(Ol), An actuator mounting plate-(02),An jacking means (3) to lift actuator mounting plate-(02) and move it to a required position along T slots axis, T-slOts provided on said base plate (01), A stepped screw means (04) for rotating screw in clockwise direction and tightening said jacking means (03) located in said T slots and enable said actuator mounting plate-(02) to fix rigidly with said base plate-(01),Bearing bush means-(05) mounted rigidly on said actuator mounting plate for restricting the upward movement of said stepped screw means (04), Roller means (06) provided on the said jacking means (03) by means of cylindrical pin (10) which enables for moving whole assembly to move along the said T-slots, thrust ball bearing-(07) mounted at top end of collar of said stepped screw (04).<br>
Said jacking means is a T—nut. Said lead screw (04) is rotated in anticlockwise direction which enables said T nut-(03) to be loosened in a said T slots.<br>
The Further rotation of said stepped screw (04) in anticlockwise direction, the said T-nut (03) moves axially downward and touches the ground surface of said T slot. Since movement of said stepped screw (04) in upward direction is restricted by said bearing bush(05) mounted rigidly by bolt means on said actuator mounting plate(02), and said stepped screw(04) is further rotated in anticlockwise direction for lifting said actuator mounting plate(02) against said T nut (03)-<br>
Said bearing bush (05) is fixed on said actuator mounting plate (02) with the help of fixing means (09) like Allen screw <br>
 <br>
After said actuator mounting plate (02) is sufficiently lifted and as said rolIer-06 is fixed in the said T- Nut by means of cylindrical pin (10) which is free to rotate about its axis, whole assembly can be moved along said T- slots at required position manually.<br>
After moving entire assembly or unit at required distance, said stepped screw (04) is rotated in clockwise direction till said actuator mounting plate(02) seats properly on the said base plate (01), further rotation of said stepped screw(04) will enable said T-Nut (03) to be tightened against said actuator mounting plate(02),<br>
At least one thrust ball bearing (07) is mounted at top end of collar of said screw to take axial loads and smoothen the rotation while lifting said actuator mounting plate (02) and at least one thrust washer (08) is mounted at the bottom end of the collar of said stepped screw (04) for tightening.<br>
Said base plate (01) is firmly mounted on the grouted channel on the ground with the help of bolt (11) and nut (12).<br>
After moving at desired position of actuator mounting plate (02), said stepped screw (04) can be rotated anticlockwise, so that said actuator mounting plate (02) sit down on said base plate (01) which can be again clamped firmly with said base plate (01) by further rotation of said stepped screw (04) in anticlockwise direction. The said clockwise and anticlockwise rotation of said stepped screw (04) makes it possible to clamp, unclamp, lift the device (13) and said roller (06) mounted at T nut bottom makes possible to move device freely along the said T slots with the help of this device, entire activities is done within 5-10 minutes only.<br>
In present case the device (13) is actuator assembly which is mounted on the said actuator mounting plate (02) with conventional means so that entire assembly can be moved along the said T slots. This device can be used where ever movement of any assembly or object is required to move along T-Slots. <br>
 <br>
The foregoing description is a specific embodiment of the present invention. It should be appreciated that this embodiment is described for purpose of illustration only, and that numerous alterations and modifications may be practiced by those skilled in the art without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. It is intended that all such modifications and alterations be included insofar as they come within the scope of the invention as claimed or the equivalents thereof.  <br>
