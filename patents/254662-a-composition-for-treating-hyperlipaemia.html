A COMPOSITION FOR TREATING HYPERLIPAEMIA FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a novel composition for treating hyperlipaemia, comprising the first active component acipimox, and the second active component atorvastatin, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or solvate thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
With the continuous development of the medical sciences, it is recognized that the excessive amount of cholesterol, lipid and the like is the basic cause of cardiovascular diseases, and high level of blood lipid is the main dangerous factor related to the occurrence of coronary heart disease and hypertension. Therefore, the development of blood lipid modulating agents is considered as the focus of preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases. Since the end of 1980s, a large amount of agents for lowering blood lipid have been developed, among which statins are well estimated, because the excellent clinical therapeutic effect of statins is much higher than other blood lipid modulating agents. During more than ten years, the results of several international large scale trials on preventing and treating coronary heart disease demonstrated that statins can decrease the morbidity and mortality rates of coronary heart disease, and slower the progression of the already developed atherosclerotic clot, and even reduce the atherosclerotic clot, thereby broke the traditional concept which says that coronary heart disease cannot be reversed. A revolution of blood lipid initiated by "statins" is springing up all over the world. Currently, people in the medical art are full of confidence on the effects of lipid modulating agents for preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases, and the lipid modulating therapy will be the main method for preventing and treating cardiovascular diseases in the 21 century.<br>
Atorvastatin is a lipid modulating agent, which is the third generation of statins. It is a<br>
completely synthesized inhibitor of hydroxymethylglutaryl-CoA (HMG-CoA) reducase,<br>
firstly launched into the market of USA in the form of calcium salt in 1995. Its chemical name<br>
is:	calcium<br>
[R-(R',R')]2-(4-flurophenyl)-p5-dihydroxyl-5-(l-methylethyl)-3-phenyl-4-[aniline]carbonyl]-1 -hydro-pyrrolyl-1 -heptanoate trihydrate. Structural Formula:<br><br><br>
Generally said atorvastatin refers to the above-mentioned trihydrate of calcium salt, which is<br>
also known as atorvastatin calcium, and the dosages/specifications are generally calculated<br>
based         on         atorvastatin         free         acid.         Chinese         Daoyi	Website<br>
(www.daovi.com/drug/html/200009/6000000189670.html) reviews its pharmacodynamics as following:<br>
1.	Inhibiting HMG-CoA reducase. HMG-CoA reducase is a rate-limiting enzyme in the<br>
enzyme systems for synthesizing cholesterol, the inhibition of which will cause the synthesis<br>
of cholesterol to be decreased. Atorvastatin shows biological activity immediately after the<br>
absorption by oral administration as pravastatin, while both of lovastatin and simvastatin are<br>
prodrugs, which show biological activity only after being metabolized in vivo. Therefore, the<br>
effect of atorvastatin is faster than those of lovastatin and simvastatin. The inhibitory effect of<br>
atorvastatin on HMG-CoA reducase is higher than those of other statins. 50% Inhibition<br>
concentration (IC50) of atorvastatin on HMG-CoA reducase is 73 nmol.L-1, while that of<br>
pravastatin is 2650 nmol.L"1. Atorvastatin 80 mg/d, pravastatin 40 mg/d and simvastatin 40<br>
mg/d are shown to reduce the plasma concentration of methyl dihydroxyl valeric acid (MVA)<br>
by 59%, 32% and 49%, respectively. Moreover, the inhibiting duration of single dosage of<br>
atorvastatin on HMG-CoA reducase is longer than those of other statins.<br>
2.	Increasing the receptor of low density lipoprotein (LDL).    By the inhibition of HMG-CoA<br>
reducase, atorvastatin decreases the concentration of cholesterol in plasma and tissue cells,<br>
and stimulates the increase of the density of LDL receptor in the liver, thereby enhance the<br>
clearance of plasma low density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C). LDL receptor in the liver<br>
may bind to very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) to enhance the degradation of VLDL,<br>
thereby decrease the concentration of triglyceride (TG).<br>
3.	Inhibiting   the   synthesis   of   very   low   density   lipoprotein-cholesterol   (VLDL-C).<br><br>
Cholesterol is required for synthesizing VLDL. Atorvastatin may decrease the synthesis and secretion of VLDL by decreasing the plasma concentration of cholesterol. VLDL is required for carrying and transporting TG, and VLDL-C is the precursor of LDL-C, thus atorvastatin may decrease the level of TG, VLDL-C and LDL-C.<br>
4. Anti-atherosclerotic effect. Atorvastatin is advantageous to delay the progression of atherosclerosis by decreasing the blood lipid, reducing the lipid infiltration and the formation of foam cells. Atorvastatin also may prevent atherosclerotic clot from breaking. Furthermore, in vitro experiments show that atorvastatin may inhibit the proliferation and migration of vascular smooth muscles. In vivo experiments show that 2.5 mg/kg of atorvastatin may decrease the area of rabbit atherosclerotic clot by 67% (P
Generally, atorvastatin is well tolerated, and most of adverse effects are slight. The tolerance of patient to atorvastatin is better than lovastatin.<br>
Acipimox is an artificially synthesized nicotinic acid derivative, which can inhibit the decomposition of fat tissue, decrease the release of free fat acid from fat tissue, thereby reducing the synthesis of triglyceride (TG) in liver. Furthermore, Acipimox may decrease the concentration of triglyceride (TG) and total cholesterol (TC) in serum by inhibiting the synthesis of very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and low density lipoprotein (LDL). Acipimox may also inhibit the activity of lipase in the liver, and decrease the decomposition of high density lipoprotein (HDL). Acipimox is quickly absorbed after oral administration, and the peak of plasma concentration can be reached within 2 hours after administration, with the half life of 2 hours. Acipimox does not combine with plasma protein, and is excreted mainly in the form of Acipimox itself, without being metabolized. In clinical application, Acipimox can effectively treat hypertriglyceridemia (type IV), hypercholesterolemia (type Ha) and hypertriglyceridemia plus hypercholesterolemia (type lib). Acipimox is a safe, effective, and a well tolerated blood lipid modulating agent.<br><br>
Turrently, the research tendency in this art is to formulate two blood lipid modulating agents iaking actions in different action mechanisms into a combined preparation, and thereby allow the lipid decreased effect more extensive, and also allow them act synergistically to enhance the therapeutic effect and reduce adverse effects.<br>
US patent No. US5260305A discloses a composition comprising pravastatin, an inhibitor of HMG-CoA reducase, and nicotinic acid as well as the derivative thereof, and particularly discloses the preparation of compositions comprising 5 mg, 10 mg, 20 mg and 40 mg of pravastatin respectively and 750 mg of acipimox. However, the patent does not disclose the beneficial effect thereof and the pharmacological experimental data of the best formulation.<br>
Chinese application publication No. CN1425374A discloses a composition comprising acipimox and lovastatin, in which the weight ratio of acipimox to lovastatin is 25-50:1, preferably 25:1 or 37.5:1. However, the patent does not mention the composition comprising acipimox and atorvastatin, particularly the best formulation of the composition, and the corresponding pharmacologically experimental data thereof.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a novel pharmaceutical composition for treating hyperlipemia, comprising the first active component acipimox, and the second active component atorvastatin, or the pharmaceutically acceptable salt, ester or solvate thereof. The resultant composition has more extensive lipid decreasing effect due to the different action mechanisms of acipimox and atorvastatin. Moreover, the two components can act synergistically, and the lipid decreasing effect is superior to either of the two components used alone at the same dosage. Furthermore, by properly selecting the amount of atorvastatin in the composition, not only may the composition effectively decrease the blood lipid level but also may show no obvious toxic adverse effect. Meanwhile, the composition may be conveniently administered only once per day, thereby greatly increase the compliance of the patients. Furthermore, by comparing the composition according to the present invention with the compositions in the prior art US5260305A and CN1425374A, the inventors found unexpectedly that the combination of acipimox and atorvastatin shows remarkably synergistic effect in decreasing serum total cholesterol, serum triglyceride and serum low density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Furthermore, in comparison with the combination of acipimox and pravastatin or the combination of acipimox and lorvastatin, the combination of acipimox and<br><br>
Atorvastatin shows more remarkable lipid decreasing effect and high density lipoprotein increasing effect.<br>
One of the compositions according to the present invention consists of acipimox and atorvastatin calcium, as well as pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants, in which the weight ratio of acipimox to atorvastatin calcium (calculated by the free acid, the same below) is 10-80:1, preferably 10-30:1, more preferably 30:1. The dosage form of the pharmaceutical composition includes solid formulations, such as tablets, capsules, granules, pills, dropping pills and the like, which can prepared by the general preparing methods well known in the art. The content of acipimox corresponds to a daily dosage of about 200 to 750 mg, and the content of atorvastatin calcium corresponds to a daily dosage of 5 to 80 mg, preferably 10 to 30 mg, when administrating the composition.<br>
Upon formulating the composition according to the present invention into solid formulations such as tablets or capsules, in order to achieve a permanent therapeutic effect, effective amount of acipimox is preferably formulated into a slow released part, and then formulated into slow released formulations such as slow released tablets or slow released capsules and the like together with effective amount of atorvastatin calcium. Accordingly, pharmaceutically acceptable adjuvants include a diluent, such as starch, lactose, mannitol, pregelatinized starch, dextrine, microcrystal cellulose; a disintegrant, such as carboxymethylstarch sodium, hydroxypropyl starch, low substituted hydroxypropyl cellulose, carboxymethylcellulose sodium; slow-release agent, such as ethylcellulose, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose-4M, hydroxypropyl methylcellulose-15M, Eudragit RS-100, RL100, RS30D, RL30D, NE30D, as well as Surelease (water dispersion of ethylcellulose); an adhesive, such as polyvinylpyrrolidone, crosslinked polyvinylpyrrolidone, etc.; a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate, talc powder, micronized silica gel, and the like.<br>
Through the pharmacological researches, it is shown that in comparison with effective amount of acipimox or atorvastatin calcium alone, the composition according to the present invention, especially in a preferred ratio, shows surprisingly better effect, without increasing any toxicity. Therefore, the safe dosage range of the composition according to the present invention is broad, the duration of therapeutic effect is long, and thus comprehensive effect is favorable, and is further convenient for administration. The composition according to the present invention may be administered once or twice per day, preferably once per day. In<br><br>
comparison with the combination of acipimox and pravastatin, and the combination of acipimox and lovastatin, the composition according to the present invention also shows better lipid decreasing activity.<br>
In addition, we found from the screening experiments that the pharmacological activity of atorvastatin in the composition according to the present invention had little relationship with the salt, ester or solvate thereof The lipid decreasing activity only relates to the amount of atorvastatin free acid. Therefore, atorvastatin in the present invention may be any one of the pharmaceutically acceptable salts, ie., any one of the appropriate physiologically acceptable salts of atorvastatin, including salts formed with inorganic base and organic base, such as sodium salt, calcium salt, potassium salt, magnesium salt, zinc salt and iron salt; or any one of the pharmaceutically acceptable esters of atorvastatin, ie.? any one of the appropriate physiologically acceptable esters, including esters formed with aliphatic alcohol, aromatic alcohol and heterocylic alcohol, such as methyl ester, ethyl ester, allyl ester, and phenyl ester.<br>

Example 9: Screening the formulation of acipimox in combination with atorvastatin calcium for treating hyperlipemia in rats<br>
The objective of the present experiment is to determine the formulation of acipimox in combination with atorvastatin calcium with low toxicity and high activity, which is also convenient for administration, by means of screening. Hyperlipemia rat model was induced by feeding rats with high lipid containing feed. The model rats were continuously administered by gavage with acipimox (100 to 400 mg/kg) and (or) atorvastatin calcium (2.5 to 30 mg/kg, calculated by the free acid, the dosages described below were all calculated by atorvastatin free acid) for 14 days. The results showed that the formulation of acipimox in combination with atorvastatin calcium had remarkable therapeutic effect on hyperlipemia in rats induced by high lipid containing feed, and the lipid decreasing effect was related to the dosages of the two drugs. The formulations of acipimox 200 mg/kg in combination with<br><br>
atorvastatin calcium 10 mg/kg, acipimox 200 mg/kg in combination with atorvastatin calcium 20 mg/kg, and acipimox 300 mg/kg in combination with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg/kg were shown to have remarkable effect, in the aspect of decreasing the level of serum total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol in rats, and increasing the level of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol. These formulations were shown to make synergistic effects, among which the formulation of acipimox 300 mg/kg in combination with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg/kg had the most remarkable effect. Thus, the formulation of acipimox 300 mg/kg and atorvastatin calcium 10 mg/kg is most preferred. In the dosage range of the present experiment, the formulations were not shown to have any remarkable effect on the activity of seroenzyme which is related to the toxicities on the liver and muscles.<br>

8.4 The Test for the comparison of the different Formulations of Acipimox in combination<br>
with Atorvastatin Calcium<br>
After hyperlipemia model rats were continuously administered for 14 days, in comparison<br>
with either of Acipimox and Atorvastatin Calcium at the same dosage, all the groups of the<br>
formulations of acipimox in combination with atorvastatin calcium were shown to decrease<br>
more    remarkably   the    level    of   total    cholesterol,    triglyceride    and    low    density<br>
lipoprotein-cholesterol in serum of model rats, and more remarkably increase the level of high<br>
density lipoprotein-cholesterol. The results were shown in Table 4.<br>
By comprehensive analysis, in comparison with model control group, the groups of the<br>
formulations of acipimox 200 mg/kg in combination with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg/kg,<br><br>
"Sacipimox 200 mg/kg in combination with atorvastatin calcium 20 mg/kg, and acipimox 300 mg/kg in combination with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg/kg were shown to have more remarkable effect, and were shown to decrease more remarkably the level of total cholesterol, triglyceride, and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol in serum of rats, and were shown to increase more remarkably the level of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol. In comparison with either of acipimox and atorvastatin calcium at the same dosage, the levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol in serum of the groups of the above three formulations of acipimox in combination with atorvastatin calcium were shown to be remarkably decreased, and the level of high density liproprotein-cholesterol was shown to be remarkably increased. The above-mentioned effects were shown to be synergistic in the above three groups. Among the three groups, the group of the formulation of acipimox 300 mg/kg in combination with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg/kg was shown to have the most remarkable effect. Therefore, the formulation of acipimox 300 mg/kg and atorvastatin calcium 10 mg/kg is preferred.<br><br>

9. Conclusions<br><br>
^he combination of acipimox with atorvastatin calcium had remarkable therapeutic effect on hyperlipemia in rat induced by high lipid containing feed, and the lipid decreasing effect was related to the dosages of the two drugs. The three groups of the formulations of acipimox 200 mg/kg in combination with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg/kg, acipimox 200 mg/kg in combination with atorvastatin calcium 20 mg/kg, and acipimox 300 mg/kg in combination with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg/kg were shown to have remarkable effect, in particularly remarkably decreasing the levels of total cholesterol, triglyceride, low density lipoprotein-cholesterol in serum of rats, and remarkably increasing the level of high density lipoprotein-cholesterol. Furthermore, the above-mentioned effects were shown to be synergistic. Among the groups, the group of the formulation of acipimox 300 mg/kg in combination with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg/kg was shown to have the most remarkable effect, and thus the formulation of acipimox 300 mg/kg in combination with atorvastatin calcium 10 mg/kg is preferred. In the range of the dosage used in the present experiment, the groups of the formulations of acipimox in combination with atorvastatin calcium were shown to have no remarkable effect on the activity of seroenzyme, preliminarily indicating no remarkable toxic effect on the liver and striated muscle. Acipimox alone is conventionally administered thrice per day, however the present experiment demonstrates that the administration of acipimox once per day still has remarkable lipid decreasing effect and small toxicity, which provides reliable experimental support for the administering scheme of the formulation of acipimox in combination with atorvastatin calcium as once per day. This administering scheme will definitely make the medicament more convenient to the patients, so as to increase the compliance of the patients.<br>
Example 10<br>
Lipid decreasing effect of the  combination  of acipimox  and  atorvastatin calcium in<br>
comparison with those of the combination of acipimox and pravastatin, as well as the<br>
combination of acipimox and lovastatin<br>
In the experiment, we compared the formulation of acipimox in combination with atorvastatin<br>
calcium screened in Example 9 with the compositions disclosed in the above mentioned<br>
patents, and surprisingly found that the combination of acipimox and atorvastatin calcium was<br>
not only shown to be remarkably synergistic in decreasing serum total cholesterol, serum<br>
triglyceride and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, but also was shown to be remarkably<br>
different from the effect of the combination of acipimox and pravastatin, as well as that of the<br>
combination of acipimox and lovastatin. That is to say that the combination of acipimox and<br><br>
Jgtorvastatin calcium exhibited more remarkable effects for decreasing lipid and increasing high density liproprotein-cholesteroh This is based on a large amount of in vivo experiments.<br>
10.1	The test drugs, animals and the establishment of hyperlipemia rat model were same as<br>
10.2	those described in Example 9.<br>

10.5	Experimental Results<br>
After fed with high lipid containing feed for 14 days, the rats were divided into groups and administered with drugs. After being administered for 14 days, all of the groups of acipimox in combination with atorvastatin calcium at various dosages were shown to be remarkably different from the group of acipimox 300 mg/kg in combination with pravastatin 20 mg/kg<br><br>
ind the group of acipimox 300 mg/kg in combination with lovastatin 10 mg/kg in decreasing serum total cholesterol, serum triglyceride and low density lipoprotein-cholesterol, as well as in increasing high density lipoprotein-cholesterol. The experimental results fully demonstrated that the combination of acipimox and atorvastatin calcium had unexpected effect in decreasing the blood lipid. The combination of acipimox and atorvastatin calcium achieved not only remarkable synergistic effect, but also exhibited the advantageous effects over the combinations of acipimox and lovastatin as welll as acipimox and pravastatin as disclosed in the prior art. The detailed results were shown in Table 5.<br>
