DESCRIPTION CONDENSED HETEROCYCLIC SULFONYL UREA COMPOUND, A HERBICIDE CONTAINING THE SAME, AND A METHOD FOR WEED CONTROL USING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a novel herbicide containing a fused heterocyclic sulfonylurea compound, a method for controlling weeds in paddy fields, and a novel fused heterocyclic sulfonylurea compound. This invention relates in particular to a herbicide which upon application to paddy-rice plants during or after planting, has extremely excellent selectivity for paddy-rice plants and exhibits a strong weeding effect on weeds resistant to sulfonylurea herbicides, a method of controlling sulfonylurea herbicide-resistant weeds by using the same, and a novel fused heterocyclic sulfonylurea compound.<br>
Background Art<br>
Up to now, a large number of sulfonylurea compounds for paddy fields have been in practical use, and used widely and generally as a combined preparation comprising two or more active ingredients with various kinds of Gramineae weed killers effective against weeds of the Gramineae family, but in recent years, there appear weeds<br><br>
resistant to sulfonylurea herbicides such as bensulfuron-methyl, pyrazosulfuron-ethyl and imazosulfuron, and their control becomes problematic.<br>
It is known that weeds resistant to sulfonylurea herbicides are generally cross-resistant to acetolactate syntheses (ALS) inhibitors including sulfonylurea herbicides acting on ALS. However, conventional methods for controlling weeds are those methods of adding active ingredients effective against sulfonylurea herbicide-resistant weeds to an existing combined preparation thereby increasing the number of active ingredients in the combined preparation to control the weeds (for example, JP-A 10-287513, JP-A 11-228307 and JP-A 11-349411). Under these circumstances, there is demand for herbicides having a satisfactory effect on weeds resistant to sulfonylurea herbicides and capable of decreasing the number of active ingredients in a combined preparation.<br>
Purpose of the Invention<br>
An object of this invention is to develop a herbicide which has an excellent weeding effect on weeds resistant to sulfonylurea herbicides without exerting herbicide injury to paddy-rice plants and which can reduce the number of active ingredients in a combined preparation. Another object of this invention is to develop a herbicide which<br><br>
has an excellent weeding effect not only on weeds resistant to sulfonylurea herbicides but also on annual broadleaf weeds and perennial weeds other than the resistant weeds and which has a broad weeding spectrum without exerting any herbicide injury to paddy-rice plants.<br>
Summary of Invention<br>
To develop excellent herbicides having a broad weeding spectrum 'and free of herbicide injury, the present inventors made extensive study, and as a result, found that the compounds represented by the following formula (I) or salts thereof, though falling under the scope of fused heterocyclic sulfonylurea compounds in JP-A 64-38091 filed by the present applicant, have a higher weeding effect on a broader range of sulfonylurea herbicide-resistant weeds than most other herbicides, and this invention was thereby completed.<br>
It was surprisingly revealed that in those compounds of formula (1} below wherein the substituent group Q is a group represented by Ql to Q3, the compounds wherein R3 is a hydrogen, exhibit a high weeding effect on weeds sensitive to sulfonylurea herbicides, but significantly reduce their effect on weeds resistant to said herbicides, whereas those compounds wherein R3 represents any one of the substituent groups below and Q is a group represented<br><br>

An emulsion, a hydrate and the like are diluted suitably (e.g. 100- to 100,000-fold) with water or<br><br>
the like on the occasion of use and sprayed.<br>
When Compound (I) or a salt thereof is used as a herbicide, the amount thereof is varied depending on the application field, application period, application method, target weeds, cultivated products etc., but generally the amount of the active ingredient (Compound (1} or a salt thereof) is about 0.05 to 50 g, preferably about 0.1 to 5 g/are of paddy field, or about 0.0 4 to 10 g, preferably about 0.08 to 5 g/are of field.<br>

Test Example 1<br>
A 5 cmx5 cm Jiffy Pot™ was charged with paddy soil, then water was introduced into each pot, seeds of sulfonylurea herbicide-sensitive Scirpus juncoides var, ohwianus, sulfonylurea herbicide-sensitive Lindernia procumbens (Krock.) Philcox, sulfonylurea herbicide-sensitive Lindernia dubia subsp. major Pennell, sulfonylurea herbicide-resistant Scirpus juncoides var. ohwianus, sulfonylurea herbicide-resistant Lindernia procumbens (Krock.) Philcox and sulfonylurea herbicide-resistant Lindernia dubia subsp. major Pennell were sowed therein and cultivated for a prescribed period under flooding conditions, when the plants reached the two-leave stage, the prescribed number of Jiffy Pots where the plants had been grown were transferred to a 150-cm^ rectangular plastic pot, and water was introduced to a height of 3 cm, and a chemical diluent containing a compound was applied<br><br>
into the pot in an amount ot 1 g/are. The cnemical diluent was prepared by dissolving 1.5 g compound in 2 L of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) containing 2% (W/V) surfactant Tween™ 20 and then diluting it with water to adjust the total volume to 10 L.<br>
Three weeks after treatment with the chemical, the effect on each weed was evaluated under the criteria shown in Table 6.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
Industrial Applicability<br>
The herbicide of the present invention is useful for control of weeds including sulfonylurea herbicide-resistant weeds in paddy fields, and is also useful for reducing the number of active ingredients in a combined preparation.<br><br><br>
WE CLAIM:<br>
1.        A compound represented by the formula:<br><br>
wherein Rl represents a halogen atom or an optionally halogenated lower alkyl group, R2 represents a hydrogen atom, R3 represents an optionally halogenated C2-4 alkyl group or an optionally halogenated or lower-alkylated lower cycloaikyi group, and X and Y each represent an optionally halogenated lower alkyl group or an optionally halogenated lower alkoxy group, or a salt thereof.<br>
