All documents cited or relied upon below are expressly incorporated herein by reference. Diabetes mellitus is a serious illness that affects an increasing number of people across the world. Its incidence is increasing along with the increasing trend to obesity  many countries. The serious consequences of the disease include increased risk of stroke, heart disease, kidney damage, blindness, and amputation. Diabetes is characterized by decreased insulin secretion and/or an impaired ability of peripheral tissues to respond to insulin, resulting in increased plasma glucose levels. There are two forms of diabetes: insulin-dependent and non-insulin-dependent, with the great majority of diabetics suffering from the non-insulin-dependent form of the disease, known<br><br>
as type 2 diabetes or non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). Because of the serious consequences, there is an urgent need to control diabetes.<br>
Treatment of NIDDM generally starts with weight loss, a healthy diet and an exercise program. These factors are especially important in addressing the increased cardiovascular risks associated with diabetes, but they are generally ineffective in controlling the disease itself. There are a number of drug treatments available, including insulin, metformin, sulfonylureas, acarbose, and thiazolidinediones. However, each of these treatments has disadvantages, and there is an ongoing need for new drugs to treat diabetes.<br>
Metformin is an effective agent that reduces fasting plasma glucose levels and enhances the insulin sensitivity of peripheral tissue. Metformin has a number of effects in vivo, including an increase in the synthesis of glycogen, the polymeric form in which glucose is stored [R. A. De Fronzo Drugs 1999, 55 Suppl. 1, 29]. Metformin also has beneficial effects on lipid profile, with favorable results on cardiovascular health—treatment with metformin leads to reductions in the levels of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides [S. E. Inzucchi JAMA 2002, 257, 360]. However, over a period of years, metformin loses its effectiveness [R. C. Turner et al. JAMA 1999, 281, 2005] and there is consequently a need for new treatments for diabetes.<br>
Thiazolidinediones are activators of the nuclear receptor peroxisome-proliferator activated receptor-gamma. They are effective in reducing blood glucose levels, and their efficacy has been attributed primarily to decreasing insulin resistance in skeletal muscle [M. Tadayyon and S. A. Smith Expert Opin. Investig. Drugs 2003, 12, 307]. One disadvantage associated with the use of thiazolidinediones is weight gain.<br>
Sulfonylureas bind to the sulfonylurea receptor on pancreatic beta cells, stimulate insulin secretion, and consequently reduce blood glucose levels. Weight gain is also associated with the use of sulfonylureas [S. E. Inzucchi JAMA 2002, 257, 360] and, like metformin, efficacy decreases over time [R. C. Turner et al. JAMA 1999, 281, 2005]. A further problem often encountered in patients treated with sulfonylureas is hypo-glycemia [M. Salas and J. J. CaroAdv. Drug React. Tax. Rev. 2002, 21, 205-217].<br><br>
Acarbose is an inhibitor of the enzyme alpha-glucosidase, which breaks down disac-charides and complex carbohydrates in the intestine. It has lower efficacy than met-formin or the sulfonylureas, and it causes intestinal discomfort and diarrhea which often lead to the discontinuation of its use [S. E. Inzucchi JAMA 2002, 257, 360]<br>
The metabolic syndrome is a condition where patients exhibit more than two of the following symptoms: obesity, hypertriglyceridemia, low levels of HDL-cholesterol, high blood pressure, and elevated fasting glucose levels. This syndrome is often a precursor of type 2 diabetes, and has high prevalence in the United States with an estimated prevalence of 24% (E. S. Ford et al. JAMA 2002, 287, 356). A therapeutic agent that ameliorates the metabolic syndrome would be useful in potentially slowing or stopping the progression to type 2 diabetes.<br>
In the liver, glucose is produced by two different processes: gluconeogenesis, where new glucose is generated in a series of enzymatic reactions from pyruvate, and glyco-lysis, where glucose is generated by the breakdown of the polymer glycogen.<br>
Two of the key enzymes in the process of gluconeogenesis are phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK) which catalyzes the conversion of oxalacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, and glucose-6-phosphatase (G6Pase) which catalyzes the hydrolysis of glucose-6-phosphate to give free glucose. The conversion of oxalacetate to phosphoenolpyruvate, catalyzed by PEPCK, is the rate-limiting step in gluconeogenesis. On fasting, both PEPCK and G6Pase are upregulated, allowing the rate of gluconeogenesis to increase. The levels of these enzymes are controlled in part by the corticosteroid hormones (cortisol in human and corticosterone in mouse). When the corticosteroid binds to the corticosteroid receptor, a signaling cascade is triggered which results in the upregulation of these enzymes.<br>
The corticosteroid hormones are found in the body along with their oxidized 11-dehydro counterparts (cortisone and 11 -dehydrocorticosterone in human and mouse, respectively), which do not have activity at the glucocorticoid receptor. The actions of the hormone depend on the local concentration in the tissue where the corticosteroid receptors are expressed. This local concentration can differ from the circulating levels of the hormone in plasma, because of the actions of redox enzymes in the tissues. The<br><br><br>
enzymes that modify the oxidation state of the hormones are 1 Ibeta-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenases forms I and II. Form I (11ß-HSD1) is responsible for the reduction of cortisone to cortisol in vivo, while form II (11ß-HSD2) is responsible for the oxidation of cortisol to cortisone. The enzymes have low homology and are expressed in different tissues. 11P-HSD1 is highly expressed in a number of tissues including liver, adipose tissue, and brain, while 11P-HSD2 is highly expressed in mineralocorticoid target tissues, such as kidney and colon. 11P-HSD2 prevents the binding of cortisol to the mineralocorticoid receptor, and defects in this enzyme have been found to be associated with the syndrome of apparent mineralocorticoid excess (AME).<br>
Since the binding of the 11 ß-hydroxysteroids to the corticosteroid receptor leads to upregulation of PEPCK and therefore to increased blood glucose levels, inhibition of 11ß-HSD1 is a promising approach for the treatment of diabetes. In addition to the biochemical discussion above, there is evidence from transgenic mice, and also from small clinical studies in humans, that confirm the therapeutic potential of the inhibition of 11P-HSD1.<br>
Experiments with transgenic mice indicate that modulation of the activity of 11 P-HSD1 could have beneficial therapeutic effects in diabetes and in the metabolic syndrome. For example, when the 11ß-HSD1 gene is knocked out in mice, fasting does not lead to the normal increase in levels of G6Pase and PEPCK, and the animals are not susceptible to stress- or obesity-related hyperglycemia. Moreover, knockout animals which are rendered obese on a high-fat diet have significantly lower fasting glucose levels than weight-matched controls (Y. Kotolevtsev et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 1997, 94, 14924). 11P-HSD1 knockout mice have also been found to have improved lipid profile, insulin sensitivity, and glucose tolerance (N. M. Morton et al. J. Biol. Chem. 2001, 276, 41293). The effect of overexpressing the llß-HSDl gene in mice has also been studied. These transgenic mice displayed increased 1 Ip-HSDl activity in adipose tissue and exhibited visceral obesity which is associated with the metabolic syndrome. Levels of the corticosterone were increased in adipose tissue, but not in serum, and the mice had increased levels of obesity, especially when on a high-fat diet. Mice fed on low-fat diets were hyperglycemic and hyperinsulinemic, and also showed glucose intolerance and insulin resistance (H. Masuzaki et al. Sci-ence, 2001,294,2166).<br><br><br>
The effects of the non-selective 1 1ß-hy.'roxysteroid dehydrogenase inhibitor carbe-noxolone have been studied in a number of small trials in humans. In one study, car-benoxolone was found to lead to an increase in whole body insulin sensitivity, and this increase was attributed to a decrease in hepatic glucose production (B. R. Walker et al. /. Clin. Endocrinol. Metab. 1995, 80, 3155). In another study, decreased glucose production and glycogenolysis in response to glucagon challenge were observed in diabetic but not healthy subjects (R. C. Andrews et al. J. Clin. Enocrinol. Metab. 2003, 88, 285). Finally, carbenoxolone was found to improve cognitive function in healthy elderly men and also in type 2 diabetics (T. C. Sandeep et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 2004, 101, 6734).<br>
A number of non-specific inhibitors of 11ß-HSD1 and 11ß-HSD2 have been identified, including glycyrrhetinic acid, abietic acid, and carbenoxolone. In addition, a number of selective inhibitors of 11ß-HSD1 have been found, including chenodeoxy-cholic acid, flavanone and 2'-hydroxyflavanone (S. Diederich et al. Eur. J. Endocrinol. 2000, 142, 200 and R. A. S. Schweizer et al. Mol. Cell. Endocrinol. 2003, 272, 41).<br>

(Formula Removed)<br>
Scheme 1<br>
One general approach to the synthesis of compounds of the invention is shown in Scheme 1. According to this process, a p-keto-ester of formula 2 is converted to a compound of formula 3 where X represents dialkylamino (such as dimethylamino) or lower-alkoxy (such as ethoxy) and then the compound of formula 3 is reacted with a hydra/ine to give the compound of formula 4. The ester protective group in the compound of formula 2 is then cleaved and the resulting carboxylic acid is coupled with an amine of formula HNRiR2 to give the desired compound of formula 1. The reac-<br><br><br>
tion of a compound of formula 2 to give a compound of formula 3 can be carried out using conditions that are well known in the art. For example, in the case where X represents dimethylamino, the compound of formula 3 can be prepared by treating a compound of formula 2 with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal in an inert solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, toluene) at a temperature between about 50 °C and about 100 °C. Examples of conditions for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example, in H. H. Wassermann et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1984, 25, 3743-3746, in S. Gelin et al. Synthesis 1983, 566-568, and in J. Svete et al. Synthesis 1990, 70-72. In the case where X represents ethoxy, the compound of formula 3 can be prepared by treating a compound of formula 2 with triethylorthoformate in the presence of acetic anhydride at the reflux temperature. Examples of conditions for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example, in L. Claisen Liebigs Ann. Chem. 1897, 297, 1-18; in L. Crombie et al. J. Chem. Soc.

The reaction of the compound of formula 3 with a hydrazine can be carried out under a variety of conditions. For example, the compound of formula 3 can be reacted with a hydrazine or the acid addition salt of a hydrazine in an inert solvent such as an alcohol (for example, ethanol). In the case where an acid addition salt of the hydrazine is used, then the reaction is carried out in the additional presence of a base such as a tertiary alkylamine (for example, triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine). The reaction is conveniently carried out at a temperature between about -20 °C and about 80 °C. Examples of conditions for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example, in J. R. Beck et al. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1987, 24, 739-740; in G. Menozzi et al. J. Heterocyd. Chem. 1987, 24, 1669-1676; in F. R. Busch et al. PCT Int. Appl. WO 2003051845; in J. F. Lambert et al. PCT Int.

The cleavage of a compound of formula 4 to the corresponding carboxylic acid is carried out using reaction conditions that are well known in the field of organic synthesis, many of which are outlined in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" [T. W. Greene and P. G. M. Wuts, 2nd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, N.Y. 1991]. For exam-<br><br><br>
pie, in the case where R4 represents methyl or ethyl, the reaction can be conveniently effected by treating the compound with one equivalent of an alkali metal hydroxide, such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, or lithium hydroxide, preferably lithium hydroxide, in a suitable solvent, such as a mixture of tetrahydrofuran, methanol, and water. The reaction can be carried out at a temperature between about 0 °C and about room temperature, preferably at about room temperature. As another example, in the case where R} represents a group that can be cleaved under acidic conditions, such as a tert-butyl group, the ester may be treated with a strong inorganic acid, for example a hydrohalic acid such as hydrogen chloride or hydrogen bromide, or a strong organic acid, for example a halogenated alkane carboxylic acid such as trifluoroacetic acid and the like. The reaction is conveniently carried out in the presence of an inert organic solvent (such as dichloromethane) and at a temperature between about 0 °C and about room temperature, preferably at about room temperature. As a final (but not limiting) example, in the case where R4 represents a group that can be cleaved by catalytic hydrogenation, and with the further condition that the rest of the molecule is stable to such conditions, the reaction may be carried out by hydrogenation in the presence of a noble metal catalyst such as palladium-on-carbon in the presence of an inert solvent (for example, an alcohol such as ethanol) at about room temperature and under atmospheric pressure.<br>
The coupling of a carboxylic acid of structure 4 where R4 represents hydrogen with an amine of structure HNRiR2, according to Scheme 1, can be achieved using methods well known to one of ordinary skill in the art. For example, the transformation can be carried out by reaction of a carboxylic acid of structure 4 where R4 represents hydrogen or of an appropriate derivative thereof such as an activated ester, with an amine of structure HNR]R2 or a corresponding acid addition salt (e.g., the hydrochloride salt) in the presence, if necessary, of a coupling agent, many examples of which are well known per se in peptide chemistry. The reaction is conveniently carried out by treating the carboxylic acid of structure 4 where RI represents hydrogen with the hydro-chloride of the amine of structure HNR|R2 in the presence of an appropriate base, such as diisopropylethylamine, a coupling agent such as O-(benzotriazol-l-yl)-1,1,3,3-tetramethyluronium hexafluorophosphate, and in the optional additional presence of a substance that increases the rate of the reaction, such as 1-hydroxybenzotriazole or l-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole, in an inert solvent, such as a<br><br><br>
chlorinated hydrocarbon (e.g., dichloromethane) or N,N-dimethylformamide or N-methylpyrrolidinone, at a temperature between about 0 °C and about room temperature, preferably at about room temperature. Alternatively, the reaction can be carried out by converting the carboxylic acid of formula 4 where R4 represents hydrogen to an activated ester derivative, such as the N-hydroxysuccinimide ester, and subsequently reacting this with the amine of structure HNRjRi or a corresponding acid addition salt. This reaction sequence can be carried out by reacting the carboxylic acid of formula 4 where R4 represents hydrogen with N-hydroxysuccinimide in the presence of a coupling agent such as N,N'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at a temperature between about 0 °C and about room temperature. The resulting N-hydroxysuccinimide ester is then treated with the amine of structure HNR1R2 or a corresponding acid addition salt, in the presence of a base, such as an organic base (e.g., triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine or the like) in a suitable inert solvent such as N,N-dimethylformamide at around room temperature.<br>
The reaction sequence shown in Scheme 1 can also be carried out using solid-phase synthesis, in the case where X represents a polymer-bound amino group. Following this approach, the compound of formula 2 is treated with N-formylimidazole dimethyl acetal and a polymer-bound amine such as an aniline-functionalized cellulose derivative (for example, 4-amino-phenyl-sulfonyl-ethoxy-cellulose, which is available from lontosorb, Usti nad Labem, Czech Republic) in the presence of an acid catalyst such as camphor-sulfonic acid in an inert solvent, such as N,N-dimethylformamide at a temperature around 80 °C, to give a compound of formula 3 where X represents a polymer-bound aniline. The compound of formula 3 is then converted into the compound of formula 4 by treatment with a hydrazine in an inert solvent such as an alcohol (for example, isopropanol) at a temperature around the boiling point of the solvent. Examples of conditions for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example, in L. De Luca et al. J. Comb. Chem. 2003, 5, 465-471.<br><br>

Scheme 2<br>
A pyrazole-4-carboxamide of formula 1 can be prepared according to Scheme 2, where a (3-keto-amide of formula 5 is converted to a compound of formula 6 where X represents dialkylamino (such as dimethylamino) or lower-alkoxy (such as ethoxy) and then the compound of formula 6 reacts with a hydrazine to give the compound of formula 1. The reaction of a compound of formula 5 to give a compound of formula 6 can be carried out using conditions that are well known in the art. For example, in the case where X represents dimethylamino, the compound of formula 6 can be prepared by treating a compound of formula 5 with N,N-dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal in an inert solvent such as an aromatic hydrocarbon (for example, toluene) at a temperature between about 50 °C and about 100 °C. Examples of conditions for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example, in R. Zupet et al. J. Heterocycl. Chem. 1991, 28, 1731-1740; in D. E. Seitz et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1995, 36, 1413-1416; in A. V. Rama Rao et al. Tetrahedron Lett. 1990, 37, 1439-42; and in P. Kocienski et al. Tetrahedron Lett.1988, 29, 4481-4. In the case where X represents ethoxy, the compound of formula 6 can be prepared by treating a compound of formula 5 with triethy-lorthoformate in the presence of acetic anhydride at the reflux temperature. Examples of conditions for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example, in J. H. De-war etal.J. Chem. Soc. 1961, 3254-3260.<br>
The reaction of the compound of formula 6 with a hydrazine can be carried out under a variety of conditions. For example, the compound of formula 6 can be reacted with a hydrazine or the acid addition salt of a hydrazine in an inert solvent such as an alcohol (for example, ethanol). In the case where an acid addition salt of the hydrazine is used, then the reaction is carried out in the additional presence of a base such as a tertiary alkylamine (for example, triethylamine or diisopropylethylamine). The reaction is conveniently carried out at a temperature between about -20 °C and about 80 °C. Examples of conditions for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example, in A. X. Wang et al. Bioorg. Med. Chem. Lett. 1998, 8, 2787-2792; in T. A. Elmaati et al. Pol. J. Chem. 2002, 76, 945-952 Chemical Abstracts AN 2002:501464; and in G. Gi-acomelli et al. Eur. J. Org. Chem. 2003, 537-541<br><br><br>
The reaction sequence shown in Scheme 2 can also be carried out in the case where X represents an aniline. Thus, a compound of formula 6 can be prepared from a compound of formula 5 by treatment with an N-(alkoxymethylene)-aniline, in the optional presence of an inert solvent such as kerosene, at elevated temperature such as between about 125 °C and about 140 °C. Examples of conditions for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example, in F. B. Dains Chem. Ber. 1902, 35, 2496-2500; in F. B. Dains et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1909, 31, 1148-1157; in F. B. Dains et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1918, 40, 562-569; and in O. S. Wolfbeis Chem. Ber. 1981, 114, 3471-3484. The compound of formula 6 can then be converted to the compound of formula 1 by treatment with a hydrazine in an inert solvent such as ethanol at a temperature around the reflux temperature of the solvent. Examples of conditions for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example, in F. B. Dains et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1909, 31, 1148-1157; in F. B. Dains et al. J. Am. Chem.

This can be converted to a carboxamide of the invention by reactions analogous to those discussed above with reference to Scheme 1. The pyrazole-forming annulation reaction can be conveniently carried out by treating a 3-alkoxy-2-cyano-acrylic acid ester of formula 7 (such as 3-ethoxy-2-cyano-acrylic acid ethyl ester) with a hydrazine of formula RNHNH2 in an inert solvent such as ethanol at the reflux temperature. The subsequent annulation to<br><br><br>
form the pyrrole ring is conveniently carried out by heating the intermediate 5-amino-pyrazole with 2,5-dimethoxy-tetrahydrofvan in an organic acid such as acetic acid at a temperature of around 100 °C. An example of conditions suitable for this process can be found in the literature, for example, in M. Kopp et al. J. Heterocyd. Chem. 2001, 38, 1045-1050.

The reaction is conveniently carried out by treating the compound of formula 10 with an alkyl nitrite such as tert-butyl nitrite or isoamyl nitrite in an inert solvent such as a halogenated hydrocarbon (for example, carbon tetra-chloride) at a temperature around 50 °C, in the presence of a bromine source such as bromine, copper(II) bromide, dibromomethane, or bromoform. Conditions appropriate for this reaction can be found in the literature, for example in J. R. Beck and M. P. Lynch US 4,620,865 and in H. Mizukawa JP 2002003410. The conversion of the ester of formula 11 to an amide of formula 12 is analogous to the conversion of a compound of formula 4 to a compound of formula 1 as discussed above, and can be carried out using similar reactions. The conversion of a compound of formula 12 to a compound of the invention of formula 13 can be carried out using a Suzuki reaction<br><br><br>
with an organoboron intermediate such as an aryl-boronic acid or an ester thereof, a reaction that is well known to one of average skill in the art. For example, the reaction can be conveniently carried out by reacting a compound of formula 12 with an aryl-boronic acid in a convenient inert solvent such as a polar aprotic solvent (e.g., N,N-dimethylformamide) or an ether (e.g., dioxane) or water, in the presence of a catalytic amount of a palladium(O) complex (e.g., tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0)) or a compound which can be reduced in situ to give palladium(O) (for example, palladium^!) acetate or bis(triphenylphosphine)-palladium(II) chloride), in the optional additional presence of a catalytic amount of a phosphine ligand, for example tri-o-tolylphosphine or tri-tert-butylphosphine, or alternatively in the presence of a preformed complex of palladium(O) with a phosphine ligand such as bis(tri-cyclohexyl-phosphine)palladium, and also in the presence of an inorganic base, for example, an alkali metal carbonate, bicarbonate, hydroxide or phosphate (e.g., potassium phosphate or sodium carbonate or sodium hydroxide) at a temperature between about room temperature and about 100 °C, and preferably at between about room temperature and about 50 °C.

Many amines of formula HNR]R2 are commercially available and known to one skilled in the art. In addition, there are a variety of methods known to one of average skill in the art for the synthesis of amines of formula HNRiRi. Many of these methods are enumerated in "The Chemistry of the Amino Group" [M. S. Gibson; S. Patai Ed.; John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd. London 1968, 37-77], in "Advanced Organic Chemistry" [J. March, 3rd Edition, John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. New York, 1985], on pages 1153-1154, and in "Comprehensive Organic Transformations: A Guide to Functional Group Preparations" [R. C. Larock, VCH Publishers, Inc. New York, 1989] on pages 1061-1063. As one example of the preparation of an amine of formula HNR]R2, a solution of the oxime derived from (1 R)-(+)-camphor in an alcohol such as amyl alcohol is treated with sodium added in small pieces over an extended period such as about four hours. The reaction is carried out at the reflux temperature of the solvent, and the product is (-)-endobomylamine hydrochloride, a compound of formula HR)R2 where RI represents hydrogen and R2 represents the bornyl moiety. Exact conditions for carrying out this reaction can be found in the literature, for example in L. A. Paquette and R. F. Doehner, Jr. J. Org. Chem. 1980, 45, 5105-5113. As another example of the preparation of an amine of formula HNR]R2, ?ra«s-decahydroquinoline can be prepared by the dissolving metal reduction of A1,9-octahydroquinoline which is in turn prepared in a multistep sequence from N-1 -cyclohexenylpyrrolidine and acrylonitrile. Conditions for these reactions can be found in F. W. Vierhapper and E. L. Eliel J. Org. Chem. 1975, 40, 2734-2742 and in L. A. Cohen and B. Witkop J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1955, 77, 6595-6600. As a further example of the synthesis of an amine of formula HNRiR2, l-hydroxyadamantan-4-one reacts with hydroxylamine hydrochloride in re-fluxing ethanol in the presence of aqueous sodium hydroxide to give 1-hydroxyadamantan-4-one oxime. This is then reduced with lithium aluminum hydride in an inert solvent such as tetrahydrofuran at the reflux temperature to give 4-aminoadamantan-1-ol, which is conveniently isolated and characterized as the hydro-chloride salt. Conditions for these reactions can be found in the literature, for example in H. W. Geluk and J. L. M. A. Schlatmann Tetrahedron 1968, 24, 5369-5377. As a final but not limiting example of the synthesis of an amine of formula HNR]R2, a secondary amine can be prepared by making use of a process called reductive amination, which is well known to one of average skill in the art of organic synthesis, whereby an amine is treated with a ketone to give an imine which is reduced by one of a number of reducing agents. Many examples of conditions that can be used for this reaction<br><br><br>
are enumerated in "Comprehensive Organic Transformations: A Guide to Functional Group Preparations" [R. C. Larock, VCH Publishers, Inc. New York, 1989] or pages 421-423.
