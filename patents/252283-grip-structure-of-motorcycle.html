[Title  of  the   Invention]     GRIP  STRUCTURE  OF MOTORCYCLE<br>
[Technical   Field]<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to a grip structure of a motorcycle and, more specifically, to a structure of a grip provided on a rear vehicle bodyâ– frame of the motorcycle. [Background Art]<br>
[0002]<br>
As a known example of a grip structure of a motorcycle, there is a structure including a rear vehicle body cover for covering around a rear vehicle body frame, a rear fender, a grip body provided on a lower portion of the rear vehicle body frame, and a projection formed for storing the grip body provided on the side of the rear fender, in which the proj ection constitutes a grip (for example, see Patent Document 1).<br>
[0003]<br>
[Patent Document 1]  JP-A-8-40339 (p.2, Fig. 3) [Disclosure of the Invention] [Problems to be Solved by the Invention]<br>
[0004]<br>
In the grip structure of the motorcycle described in Patent Document 1 shown above, the rear vehicle body cover is protruded on the side of a vehicle, and the grip is arranged vertically below the rear vehicle body frame, so that the rear<br><br>
vehicle body frame and the grip are overlapped in plan^yiew. Therefore, the distance in the cross-vehicle direction from the outside surface of the rear vehicle body cover to the grip is long, and hence a user can hardly hold the grip tightly. In addition, since the grip is arranged in the vicinity of the rear fender, dust such as mud attaches inside the grip, and hence the hand of the user who grips the grip may get dirty. Furthermore, since a joint portion between the rear vehicle body cover and the rear fender is arranged on the side of the vehicle body, there is a problem that the appearance of the motorcycle is lowered.<br>
[0005]<br>
In order to solve the above-described disadvantages, it is an object of the present invention to provide a grip structure of a motorcycle which enables a user to hold a grip positively, prevents attachment of dust such as mud to the grip, and improves the appearance of the motorcycle. [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
[0006]<br>
In order to achieve the above-described object, the invention according to Claim 1 is a grip structure of a motorcycle including a rear vehicle body frame, a grip provided on the rear vehicle body frame, a rear vehicle body cover for covering at least the rear vehicle body frame and a rear fender attached to the rear vehicle body frame for covering the upper<br><br>
side of a rear wheel, characterized in that the grip includes a grip body extending from the rear vehicle body frame outward in the cross-vehicle direction so as to form an annular shape in plan view and a grip cover provided on the rear fencer for covering the lower side and the inner side of the grip body, and in that the grip cover is formed with a grip storing recess which is inserted into the inner side of the grip body upward from below.<br>
[0007]<br>
In addition to the configuration of the invention described in Claim 1, the invention according to Claim 2 is characterized in that the grip cover is formed with a grip abutting portion which is formed to be thick along the grip body and comes into abutment with the grip body.<br>
[0008]<br>
In addition to the configuration of the invention described in Claim 1 or 2, the invention according to Claim 3 is characterized in that the rear fender is formed with a rear wheel storing recess for storing the rear wheel and the grip cover is formed with a projection projecting downwardly between the rear wheel storing recess and the grip storing recess.<br>
[0009]<br>
In addition to the configuration of the invention according to any one of Claims 1 to 3, the invention according<br><br>
to Claim 4 is characterized in that the rear vehicle body cover is formed with a notch which corresponds to the shape of a side surface of the grip cover.<br>
[0010]<br>
In addition to the configuration of the invention according to any one of Claims 1 to 4, the invention according to Claim 5 is characterized in that a lower end portion of the rear vehicle body cover is bent inwardly in the cross-vehicle direction, and a joint portion of the rear vehicle body cover with respect to the rear fender and the grip cover is arranged on the underside of a vehicle body. [Advantage of the Invention]<br>
[0011]<br>
According to the grip structure of the motorcycle in Claim 1, the grip includes the grip body extending from the rear vehicle body frame outward in the cross-vehicle direction so as to form an annular shape in plan view and the grip cover provided on the rear fender for covering the lower side and the inner side of the grip body, and the grip cover is formed with the grip storing recess which is inserted into the inner side of the grip body upward from below. Therefore, the grip is arranged in the vicinity of the outside surface of the rear vehicle body cover, and hence the distance in the cross-vehicle direction from the outside surface of the rear vehicle body cover to the grip is shortened, so that the user can positively<br><br>
hold the grip. Since the grip is arranged apart from the rear wheel, attachment of dust such as mud to the grip is avoided. Since the grip body is covered with the grip cover, the appearance of the motorcycle is improved. Since the grip cover is formed with the grip storing recess, the user can hold the grip easily, and easiness of handling of the motorcycle is improved.<br>
[0012]<br>
According to the grip structure of the motorcycle in Claim 2, since the grip cover is formed with the grip abutting portion which is formed to be thick along the grip body, and comes into abutment with the grip body, the portion of abutment between the grip body and the grip cover is increased, and hence the strength of the grip cover is improved.<br>
[0013]<br>
According to the grip structure of the motorcycle in Claim 3, the rear fender is formed with the rear wheel storing recess for storing the rear wheel, and the grip cover is formed with the projection projecting downwardly between the rear wheel storing recess and the grip storing recess. Therefore, dust such as mud splashing from the rear wheel is trapped by the projection, and hence attachment of the dust such as mud to the grip is reliably prevented.<br>
[0014]<br>
According to the grip structure of the motorcycle in<br><br>
Claim 4, the rear vehicle body cover is formed with the notch corresponding to the shape of the side surface of the grip cover, the shape of the side surface of the rear vehicle body cover is not affected. Therefore, the grip is arranged at a position apart from the rear vehicle body f^ame without impairing the appearance of the motorcycle.<br>
[0015]<br>
According to the grip structure of the motorcycle in Claim 5, since the lower end portion of the rear vehicle body cover is bent inwardly in the cross-vehicle direction, and the joint portion of the rear vehicle body cover with respect to the rear fender and the grip cover is arranged on the underside of the vehicle body. Therefore, the joint portion is not exposed to the outside, and the grip is arranged at the position apart from the rear vehicle body frame without impairing the appearance of the motorcycle.
