The present invention relates to a cutting tool and a method of making the same. FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the field of cutting tools and particularly to coatings for ceramic coated hard metal cutting tool inserts used for cutting, milling, drilling and other applications such as boring, trepanning, threading and grooving.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Coatings improve the performance of cutting tools, especially ceramic or oxide coatings on carbide or hard metal cutting tools. Ever since carbide cutting tool inserts have been ceramic coated with, for example, aluminum oxide (A12O3) , there has been a continuing effort to improve the adherence of the coating to the substrate. When the first aluminum oxide coating was applied directly to a substrate of the carbide or hard metal type, the oxygen in the aluminum oxide reacted with the substrate which reduced the adherence.<br>
It has been known to improve the properties of tool inserts made from a sintered hard metal substrate (metallic carbide bonded with a binder metal) by applying a wear-resistant carbide layer. See UK Patents Nos. 1,291,387 and 1,291,388 which disclose methods of applying a carbide coating with improved adherence; specifically, controlling the composition of the gas used for deposition of the carbide so that a decarburized zone was formed in the sintered hard metal at the interface with the wear-resistant carbide. The decarburized zone known as an eta layer, however, tends to be hard and brittle resulting in breakage. It has also been known to apply a ceramic or oxide wear-resistant coating (usually aluminum oxide) upon the sintered metal substrate. However, as already explained, the oxide layer directly upon the sintered metal body may disrupt the sintered metal morphology and binding ability. A number of patents have disclosed the use of an intermediate layer of carbides, carbonitrides and/or nitrides. See U.S. Patents Nos. 4,399,168 and 4,619,866. An intermediate titanium carbide (TiC) layer improved toughness but still an eta layer existed limiting the application of the coated tool<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
inserts to finishing cuts. A layer of titanium nitride (TiN) applied before the Tic layer eliminated the eta layer but toughness was still less than required. See U.S. Patent No. 4,497,874. Intermediate layers of titanium carbonitride (TiCN) in place of the Tic intermediate layer have been proposed. See U.S. Patents Nos. 4,619,866 and 4,399,168. A thin surface oxidized bonding layer comprising a carbide or oxycarbide of at least one of tantalum, niobium and vanadium between the hard metal substrate and the outer oxide wear layer has been proposed. See U.S. Patent No. 4,490,191.<br>
The ceramic coating (A12O3) does not adhere well enough to the Tic and many TiCN intermediate coatings when used to enhance the adhesion of the coating to the cemented carbide substrate. Due to thermal expansion differences, there is a tendency to delaminate. With the stress caused by the thermal expansion difference, coatings tend to perform inconsistently. These intermediate coatings are mostly characterized by a straight line interface between the intermediate coating and the oxide coating as shown in Fig. 1. This results in a weak bond. Adhesion may be increased some by making the substrate rough but the projections provided by the roughening are spaced too far apart to perform consistently.<br>
With the coatings, according to the present invention, increased wear resistance as well as adhesion strength are provided in ceramic coatings on hard metal cutting tools.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Briefly, according to this invention, there is provided a cutting tool insert comprising a hard metal substrate having at least two wear-resistant coatings. One of the coatings is a ceramic coating. An intermediate coating under the ceramic coating is comprised of carbonitride having a nitrogen to carbon atomic ratio between about 0.7 and about 0.95 whereby the carbonitride coating forms fingers interlocking the ceramic coating, thus<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
improving the adherence and fatigue strength of the ceramic coating. Preferably, the nitrogen to carbon atomic ratio in the carbonitride coating lies between about 0.75 and 0.95 as determined by X-ray diffraction.<br>
According to one embodiment of this invention, the hard metal cutting tool insert has two intermediate coatings between the hard metal substrate and the aluminum oxide surface coating. The coating adjacent the substrate is a 1 to 4 micron layer of titanium nitride. The coating over the titanium nitride layer is a 2 to 4 micron thick titanium carbonitride layer and the aluminum oxide coating is a 1 to 10 micron layer.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the hard metal substrate of the cutting tool insert has four coatings as follows: a 2 micron titanium nitride interior coating, a 3 micron titanium carbonitride intermediate coating, a 6 micron aluminum oxide intermediate coating, and a 2 micron Ti (C,N), i.e., TiC, TiN, TiCxNY exterior coating.<br>
Titanium is not the only suitable metal for use in the carbonitride coating. The metal may be comprised of, in addition to titanium, zirconium, hafnium, vanadium, niobium, tantalum, chromium, molybdenum and tungsten.<br>
The cutting tool insert substrate, according to this invention, typically comprises 3% to 30% of a binder metal from the iron group including, in addition to iron, nickel and cobalt and mixtures thereof and between 70% and 97% of a carbide selected from the group tungsten carbide, titanium carbide, tantalum carbide, niobium carbide, molybdenum carbide, zirconium carbide and hafnium carbide. In addit ion to carbides, the cutting tool insert substrate may also include nitrides.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the cutting tool insert substrate has a binder phase enriched surface layer, that is, a surface layer enriched with a higher percentage of cobalt or other binder metal.<br>
Briefly, according to this invention, there is provided a method of making a coated cutting tool insert<br><br>
- 4 -<br>
having a wear-resistant coating comprising the steps of depositing a metal carbonitride coating having a nitrogen to carbon atomic ratio between about 0.7 and about 0.95 by adjusting the reactants used for chemical vapor deposition of said coating and depositing a ceramic coating directly over said carbonitride coating whereby saxd carbonitride coating ana ceramic coatina have interlocking microscopic<br>
fingers	<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Further features and other objects and advantages of this invention will become clear from the following detailed description made with reference to the drawings in which:<br>
Fig. 1 is a photomicrograph of a polished section of a hard metal cutting tool insert having an oxide coating and an intermediate coating according to the prior art; and<br>
Figs. 2-4 are photomicrographs of polished sections of hard metal cutting tool inserts, according to this invention, having an intermediate coating and an oxide coating.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
According to this invention, hard metal cutting tools with a ceramic or oxide wear-resistant coating have a novel reinforcing intermediate coating. The hard metal substrate has a thin metal nitride coating overlaid with a titanium carbonitride coating. The wear-resistant ceramic coating overlays the metal carbonitride coating. The metal carbonitride intermediate layer is provided with a nitrogen to carbon atomic ratio that results in superior adherence of the oxide coating due to the development of interlocking fingers between the oxide coating and the metal carbonitride coating.<br>
A test was devised to quantitatively evaluate the performance of ceramic coated hard metal cutting tool inserts. The test is performed on a turning machine. The stock is a cylindrical bar having a diameter greater than about 4 inches. The bar has four axial slots 3/4 inch wide<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
and 1 1/2 inches deep extending the length of the bar. The bar is medium carbon steel AISI-SAE 1045 having a hardness of 25-30 HRC. The tools to be tested were used to reduce the diameter of the stock as follows.<br><br>
Feed Rate<br>
(inches per revolution or IPR)<br>
Depth of Cut (inches)<br>
Speed (surface feet per minute or SFM)<br>
.020<br>
.050<br>
500<br>
It should be apparent that four times per revolution of the stock, the cutting tool insert impacts the edge of a slot. The cutting tool insert is run until it breaks through the coating or another failure is observed. Failures were observed in the following described test and were of the fretting type which is a precursor to the greater wear and cutting failure type.<br>
In the following examples, the nitrogen to carbon atomic ratio in the titanium carbonitride intermediate layer or coating was determined by use of X-ray diffraction to first detect the lattice spacing of the carbonitride layer and then to calculate the atomic ratio of nitrogen to carbon or the atomic percentage of nitrogen based upon nitrogen and carbon. The lattice spacing of titanium carbide is known to be 1.53 Angstroms and the lattice spacing for titanium nitride is known to be 1.5 Anqstroms. The range or difference is 0.03 Angstroms. Thus, a titanium carbonitride layer found to have a lattice spacing of 1.5073 Angstroms is 0.0227 Angstroms between the spacing for titanium nitride and titanium carbide. Hence, the atomic ratio of nitrogen to carbon is 0.0227 divided by 0.03 or 75.7% nitrogen based on total carbon and nitrogen in the carbonitride layer.<br>
EXAMPLE I Comparative Example<br>
A tungsten carbide based substrate (94% tungsten carbide, 6% cobalt) of K20 material (K20 is a designation of the type of hard cutting material for machining as set forth<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
in ISO Standard ISO513:1991(E) classified according to the materials and working conditions for which the hard metal cutting material can appropriately be used) was coated according to well-known procedures in a Bernex Programmat 250 coating furnace. The coating process known as chemical vapor deposition (CVD) was used where gasses and liquids (converted to gas) are passed over substrates to be coated at 800° to 1,100° C and reduced pressures from 50 to 900 mBAR. The reactions used to coat the hard metal substrate were as follows:<br>
CVD of TiN - uses H2 + N2 + Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl4)<br>
CVD of TiCN - uses H2 + N2 + TiCl4 + Acetonitrile (CH3CN) or CH4<br>
CVD of A12O3 - uses H2 + HC1 + Aluminum Chloride (AlCl3) + CO2 + H2S<br>
The essential coating periods and atmospheres used to apply the titanium nitride layer, the titanium carbonitride layer and the oxide layer are set forth in the following Tables I, II and III. The gas reactants, the product of the A1C13 reactor and the liquid reactions are introduced to the furnace.<br>

X-ray analysis of the titanium carbonitride layer demonstrated a lattice spacing of 1.5073 which, based on the analysis explained above, represents a nitrogen to carbon ratio of 23:30 or a nitrogen content of 75.7% based upon the total carbon and nitrogen in the carbonitride layer.<br>
The coated tool insert was submitted to the above-described machining test. The cutting test showed no fretting at 180 seconds. Fig. 2 is a photomicrograph of a polished section showing the layers of coating over the substrate. The photomicrograph illustrates fingers or anchors of the titanium carbonitride layer penetrating the oxide layer and anchoring it in place.<br><br>

The lattice spacing of the titanium carbonitride layer was 1.503 Angstroms which represents a nitrogen to carbon atomic ratio of 27:30 or 90% nitrogen. In the machining test, the tool insert displayed no fretting after 120 seconds. The microstructure of Example IV is shown in Fig. 4 and illustrates prominent fingers or anchors extending between the carbonitride layer and the oxide layer.<br>
