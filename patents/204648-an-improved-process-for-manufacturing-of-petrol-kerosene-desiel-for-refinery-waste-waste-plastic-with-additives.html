Overall Schematic Diagram of Equipment<br>
Example 1:<br>
After ensuring that the coking chamber/ still is cleaned from inside, about 250 to 500 grams of feed ( combination of raw material chemical A and B in different ratios ranging 1:3, 1:1, 3:1 or other proportions/ratios ) is accurately weighed and put inside the coking still. Additives mentioned are added. The lid of the still is tightened with flanges in order to avoid any leakage. An additional gasket is also provided for the same purpose. After setting the unit as already described, heating of coking chamber/still and circulation of water/ thermic fluid is started. The temperature within the condenser is lowered by circulation of chilled water/ thermic coolant for condensation of vapours coming our of coking chamber. The heating process of coking chamber is well controlled and can be either slower or accelerated at any moment. The time of first drop of distillate coming is noted properly along with corresponding Temperature reading. Towards the end, the waxy material may come. So to keep distillate in liquid state, hot water/Thermic fluid is circulated through the condenser tube in latter stage. In the beginning the distillate evolution is more and reaches maximum and then the rate of distillate evolution falls and the rate of gas evolution increases. Then, the distillate evolution stops, finally the gas evolution also stops, and a final 30 minutes heating is required for the completion of coking.<br>
Then, the heating is stopped and the coking still is allowed to cool to the room temperature. After cooling, coking still is opened and coke inside the still is taken out and collected. The amount of coke formed is established by weighing. The volume of distillate formed with time was noted. And then the amount of total distillate &amp; gases formed are also found out.<br>
The total distillate collected is transferred to a flask. First this total distillate was analysed for important properties like specific gravity, viscosity (Kinematic or Redwood), aniline<br>
9<br><br>
point, refractive index etc. Next the ASTM distillation of total distillate was carried out and different fractions namely fraction I - IBP-140Â°C (Light Naphtha cut), Fraction II-140Â°C- 200Â°C (Heavy Naphtha and gasoline component), fraction III - 200Â°C-250Â°C (kerosene fraction), fraction IV - above 250Â°C as furnace oil / Lubricating Oil were collected.<br>
From these by blending fraction I (IBP-140Â°C) and fraction II (140-200Â°C) full range motor Gasoline fraction (IBP - 200Â°C) is made. By blending fraction II (140-200Â°C) and fraction III (200-250Â°C) a new full range kerosene fraction (140-250Â°C) is made which is tested for kerosene. Fraction IV above (250Â°C) is tested for high-speed diesel, furnace oil &amp; Lubricating oil.<br>
Different properties namely specific gravity, viscosity, aniline point and refractive index of each of these fractions were determined by BIS/IP/ASTM methods. The proximate analysis of the petroleum coke formed was also found out as per BIS standards.<br>
This is an embodiment of the invention. Several modifications are possible may be considered within the ambit and spirit of this invention. Since many modifications, variations and changes in detail may be made to the above described embodiments, it is intended that all matters described in the foregoing description as described in the accompanying specification.<br>
