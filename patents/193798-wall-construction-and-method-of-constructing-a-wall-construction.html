The invention relates to a wall construction comprising supporting poles and filling material cast between them.<br>
Further  the invention relates to a method of manufacturing a wall construction, in which method sup¬porting poles are mounted in place, a mould is mounted in such a way that the supporting poles remain inside the mould and filling material is cast inside the mould between the supporting poles.<br>
It is known to build different wall construc¬tions, but the problem. often is that manufacturing a wall construction is complicated, laborious and slow and thus expensive. On the other hand, many insulations used for wall constructions cause problems with fire safety.<br>
Finnish Publication 75 389 discloses a wall frame consisting of lightweight beams and foam concrete used as surface and filling material between the beams. The wall is made in such a way that a casting mould is fastened on the lightweight beams and the foam concrete is sprayed inside the casting mould. For the construc¬tion of the wall are required separate heavy and expen¬sive moulds, due to which the wall is slow and expensive to manufacture.<br>
German Offenlegungsschrift 42 15 081 discloses a clay wall element and a method of manufacturing it. The element comprises supports and a filling of light¬weight clay and also notches and pins for attaching an element to other elements. The element is cast inside separate moulds, due to which the wall is difficult and expensive to manufacture.<br>
British Patent 1 599 033 discloses a wall con-<br>
struction comprising studs, to which are fastened plas-<br><br>
terboards . Further, porous plastics foam is cast between the plasterboards. However, the total costs of such a wall construction are high.<br>
German Offen legungsschrift 39 21 881 discloses a prefabricated wall element of wood. There are wooden parts both outside and inside the element in question and concrete shall be cast between them either in ad¬vance or on construction site. The material costs of such a wooden wall element are high and the element is slow and difficult to manufacture.<br>
Finnish Publication 932 441 discloses an insu¬lated wall of a wooden house. This wall comprises an outer layer of wood and between the outer and the inner layer an insulation consisting of mortar layers and layers of rammed chips. Such a wall has high material costs and is slow and complicated to manufacture.<br>
An object of the present invention is to pro¬vide a wall construction, which is simple and stable and has a favourable price.<br>
A further object of the invention is to provide a method of manufacturing a wall construction, by which method the wall construction can be made quickly and advantageously.<br>
The wall construction according to the inven¬tion is characterized in that the wall construction comprises a close-meshed metal net attached at least to one side of the supporting poles, the metal net forming part of the wall construction and together with the filling material a reinforcement.<br>
The method according to the invention is char¬acterized in that a close-meshed metal net is attrached at least to one side of the supporting poles, which net forms part of the mould, and that boards are attached at spaced intervals outside the metal net to support it<br>
whereby	tne metal net acting as a mould forms part of<br><br>
the  wall  construction  and  together  with  the  filling  material  a reinforcement.<br>
The essential idea of the invention is that a close-meshed metal net fonning part of the mould is attached to tlie supporting poles and boards are attached at spaced intervals outside the metal net. Subsequently, filling material is cast into spaces formed by the metal net and the supporting poles, whereby the net acting as a mould forms part of the wall construction and together with the filling material a reinforcement. Further, the idea of an embodiment is that a mixture of lightweight aggregate and concrete is used as filling material.<br>
The advantage of the invention is that a wall construction made by the method is fire safe, quick to manufacture and simple and has a stable structure and a favourable price.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a wall construction comprising supporting poles, filling material cast between them and means acting as a mould and forming part of the wall construction and together with the filling material a reinforcement, said means being arranged to stay in a predetermined position, wherein supporting poles are wooden and a close-meshed metal net is used as means acting as a mould and that the close-meshed metal net is attached at least to one<br><br>
side of the wooden supporting poles, so that the metal net stays in a predetermined position.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of constructing a wall construction, as herein above described, in which method supporting poles are mounted in place, a mould is mounted in such a way that the supporting poles remain inside the mould and that the walls of the mould stay in a predetermined position and filling material is cast inside the mould between the supporting poles and that the mould forms part of the wall construction and together with the filling material a reinforcement, wherein the supporting poles are wooden and that a close-meshed metal net is attached at least to one side of the wooden supporting poles so that the metal net stays in a predetermined position, which not forms part of the mould, and that boards are attached at spaced intervals outside the metal net to support the metal net.<br>
The invention wall be described in greater detail in the accompanying drawings, in which<br>
Figure   1   shows a  wall  construction  according to the invention axonometricly and partly in cross-section.<br>
Figure 2 shows the wall construction of Figure 1 from above and<br><br>
Figure 3 shows another wall construction according to the invention from above.<br>
Figure I  shows a wall construction according to the invention. For making a wall construction, supporting poles 1 are erected at first. The supporting poles 1 preferably consist of impregnated wood and are fastened in place in their future position. The wooden supporting polos 1 constitute the main load-bearing structure. By using wooden supporting poles a wall construction is simple, quick and advantageous to manufacture. A close-meshed metal net 2 is attached to both sides   of the supporting poles 1. Tlie term "close-mcshed"<br><br>
means in this connection that the wires of the metal net 2 are so close to each other that the filling material intended for the wall construction is not able to flow substantially through the metal net 2. The metal net 2 is fastened to the wooden supporting poles 1 in a simple manner and very quickly for instance by means of clamp nails, small hooks, small nails or the like. The metal net 2 may comprise several net parts positioned adjacent to each other in such a way that they partially overlap each other. The metal nets 2 are supported on the oppo¬site side of the supporting poles 1 by means of boards at spaced intervals. The term "at spaced intervals" means in this connection that boards 3 adjacent to each other are not attached to each other, but they are posi¬tioned at such intervals that the metal nets 2 do not bulge substantially when filling material is introduced between them. Since the metal net is supported during casting by an outside boarding, the metal net wire does not need to be very thick, due to which chicken wire, for instance, can be used as the metal net 2. After boarding, the proper filling material of the wall con-struction is mixed of light weight aggregate and con¬crete, for instance, and the mixture 4 in question is cast between the metal nets 2 in such a way that it fills the space between the supporting poles 1 and re¬mains tightly adhered to them. The filling material can also be a mixture of for instance blast-furnace slag or some other material and concrete or some other material preferably having a light specific weight. However, the mixture 4 of lightweight aggregate and concrete is ad¬vantageous, as far as price and insulation and fire safety properties are concerned. After the mixture 4 has solidified, the boarding can be removed, if desired, or left in place for possible appearance lining. To improve<br>
the adherence between the supporting poles 1 and the"<br><br>
mixture 4, the supporting poles 1 may comprise, depend¬ing on constructions, for instance holes 5 or means of attachmenr, such as nails 6 or rhe like nailed into wooden poles, for instance. If desired, a finished wall construction can be coated for example with a plastering 7 or another similar material. Onto the supporting poles 1 can be fastened a horizontal cross-wood, to which for instance carrier beams of the roof can be attached.<br>
On the one hand, the metal net 2 acts as a reinforcement and, on the other hand, as a casting mould and in a finished wall construction as a support corre¬sponding to a concrete reinforcement and firmly attached to the filling material. Accordingly, the wall construc¬tion can act as a so-called bearing wall constructionFigure 2 shows the wall construction of Figrure 1 from above. The reference numerals of Figure 2 corre¬spond to the reference numerals of Figure 1. The metal nets 2 are attached directly to the surface of the sup¬porting poles 1, due to which there is substantxally no mixture 4 of lightweight aggregate and concrete on t&amp;e outer surfaces of the supporting poles 1.<br>
Figure 3 sbows another embodiment of the wall construction according to the invention. The reference numerals of Figure 3 correspond to the reference numer¬als of Figures 1 and 2. In the wall construction accord¬ing to Figure 3, the metal nets 2 are attached to the supporting poles 1 by means of bearers 8. The supporting poles 1 then remain on all sides substantially inside the mixture of lightweight aggregate and concrete to be cast. An uncoated wall construction substantially uni¬form in appearance is thus provided, in which construc¬tion only the ends of the bearers 8 remain to be seen. In the cases shown in Figure and Figure 3, the wooden supporting poles 1 serve especially well as battens for nailing, which can be utilized for an easy fastening'of<br><br>
a possible outer and inner lining of the wall construc¬tion.<br>
The drawing and the description attached there¬to are only intended to illustrate the idea of the in¬vention. As to the details, the invention may vary with¬in the scope of the invention. So the method and the wall construction according to the invention can be used for instance for repairing old buildings in such a way that supporting poles 1 are mounted on an old wall and outside them a metal net 2 and a boarding. Subsequently, filling material, for example a mixture 4 of lightweight aggregate and concrete, is cast between the old wall and the metal net 2 and the boarding.<br><br><br>
