BACKGROUND<br>
All types of electric bulbs mounted with tungsten filament produce light due to burning of tungsten filament at high temperatures. After certain burning hours (Approximately 1000 hours) the bulb fails due to the failure of filament only, whereas other parts of the bulb are in tact without any damage. If in case the damaged filament can be replaced with a new one, without causing any damage to the seal, the bulb can be reused as fresh as a new one. By this invention 'Two in one Electric Bulb", instead of replacing the damaged filament after its failure, during the original manufacturing process itself two filaments are mounted. The bulb is manufactured in such a fashion that the user can put the two filaments in service one after the another, thereby extending the life of the bulb by two times, (i.e.) approximately 2000 hours.<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an Electric current connection in an incandescent bulb with two filaments along with the holder (to which the bulb is connected) to facilitate to utilise the two filaments in the bulb in sequence that is one after another.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Multi filament Electric bulbs are known in the art. Different approaches and ways of using filaments one after another have been suggested.<br><br>
to put the filaments in operative posistion one after another.<br>
1.	In us pat 3673534 the base of bulb is formed with multiple foldable contacts, isolated from each other, a new contact becoming in contact on folding away the contact of the defective filament.<br>
2.	In GB446297 dated 1936 04-28 one eyelet is used as common point where as in the other eyelet the other ends of multiple filaments are superimposed on one another but insulated from one another by non anchored discs or strips of wafer like form.<br>
3.	In WO 9710611 dated 1997-03-20 a circuit selecting mechanism comprising a sleeve which snugly but freely swivellable, a stem with ridge, a circuit selecting mechanism etc is used to select the filament.<br>
So for no multifilament bulbs are found in use either due to economic considerations or due to technical reasons such as arcing, piercing of insulation etc.<br><br><br><br><br>
of same watts or different watts with an<br><br><br><br>
incorporated electric cnnection in (i) The cap of bulb and in (ii) The holder of the<br>
bulb we get 'Two in one Electric Bulb" wife double life.<br>
The consumer gets two bulbs for the same price of one bulb<br>
By doubling fee utilisation of other parts of fee bulb, pollution due to broken pieces of glass is also reduced.<br>
DESCRIPTION INVENTION<br>
In this invention stems are made wife four instead of two lead - in wires, without touching each other and also by making sure to maintain fee required 50 M Ω insuiafion value between them..<br>
Two filaments are mounted wife two lead-in-wires and two support wires for each.One lead in wire of each filament is soldered wife each eyelet of the cap.<br>
Both fee ofeer lead-in-wires of filaments are twisted together at fee end,<br>
taken out and soldered wife Aluminium cap of fee bulb as shown in 1* Fig. 3 (sheet<br>
The bulb holder is normaly wired and fixed to the ceiling of a room at the time of house wiring itself. This bulb holder to which Two in One Bulb' is to be<br><br>
fixed is slightly modified as shown in 2* Fig. 4 and 5 (sheet3/ of diagram), i.e. the metal part of the bulb holder is joined to its one of the terminal pin (Say Tl) by a small wire by'soldering at both ends. With this small change the bulb holder can be fixed permanently to ceiling of a room and can be used permanently as normal bulb holder is used nowadays.<br>
Now let the "Two in One Electric Bulb5 be fixed to modified bulb holder. With reference to Fig. 4 (shet/ of Diagram), Two pins of cap of bulb (PI and P2) will be held in the 2 slots of bulb holder. Two Eye lets El and E2 of bulb cap will touch the bottoms of Terminal pins of T2 and Tl of bulb holder respectively. (E1-T2; E2-T1). The body of the Aluminium metal cap will be in contact with the metal part of the bulb holder which is in turn connected to terminal Tl as described above. Once the electrical supply connected to Tl and T2 is switched ON the current will flow through as shown in diagram Fig. 4 (Red color marked) and the Filament Fl will glow.<br>
Since both the ends of other filament F2. i.e. One end connected to E2 and in turn touching Tl and the other end connected to Aluminium cap and in turn connected to Tl are in the same potential, current will not flow through Filament F2 and so it does not glow.<br>
On failure of Filament Fl after its normal life time, the Two in one bulb is removed from the holder, is turned 180° around its main axis and remounted in the<br><br>
fixed bulb holder. It is to be noted that there is no change in position of bulb holder and only the bulb (with cap) is turned 180°, And also there is no disturbance for the hermetically sealed Exhaust tube and so the seal is intact. Since the cap is cemented with the bulb with "Capping Cement", the cap cannot be turned independently.<br>
In the changed position Fig. 5 (3/sheet of Diagram) the Aluminium cap pins PI and P2 are held in slots of holder in interchanged position. Pin PI is facing front in Fig. 4 whereas Pin P2 is facing front in Fig. 5. The two Eyelets E2 and El will be in touch with the bottoms of Terminal pins T2 and Tl of bulb holder respectively. (E2-T2; El-Tl). The body of the alumunium metal cap will be in contact with the metal part of bulb holder which is in turn connected to terminal Tl (as described earlier). If the electrical supply connected to T2 and Tl is switched on the current will flow now as shown,in diagram Fig. 5 (Marked in Red color) and the filament F2 will glow. There will be no current flow in Fl. The above process is very simple i.e. just to remove the bulb from holder turn it 180° and refix it in the holder and any housewife can do it.<br>
In the modified holder, "One filament" bulb of present day also can be fixed for normal operation. The design of bulb holder ensures that safety regulations are not contravened just like in screw caps.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
CLAIMS<br>
CLAIM 1<br>
An Electrical circuit arrangement for a Two filaments incandescent electric bulb system comprising a bulb and a holder wherein when the system is put into operation causes the current to flow through only one filament of the bulb at any time and keeping the other filament of the bulb short circuited, characterized in that both the ends of one filament are connected to one terminal of the holder and hence not allowing the current to flow in that filament.<br>
CLAIM 2<br>
The Electrical circuit arrangement as claimed in CLAIM 1 in which in the metal cap of the said bulb, the ends of one lead-in-wire of each filament are joined together and electrically connected to the metal cap to serve as common electrical contact for the individual separate circuits of two filaments.<br>
The end of remaining lead-in-wires of the two filaments are electrically connected separately to each eye-let of the metal cap.<br><br>
CLAIM 3<br>
The electrical circuit arrangement as claimed in CLAIM 1 in which the holder comprises a metal part and two terminal pins; the metal part is electrically connected to one of the terminal pin of holder by an electrical conducting wire enabling, when the said system is operatively connected to power supply, current to pass through only one filament and not allowing current to pass through the other filament.<br><br></td>
