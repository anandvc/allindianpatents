				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>Representative salts include sodium, lithium, potassium, calcium and magnesium salts.<br>
The by-product can further include methanol, ethanol and/or glycerin. In an embodiment, the by-products can contain about 0.01 to about 15 weight percent of said methanol, ethanol and/or glycerin.<br>
The by-products can further include one or more inorganic salts such as, for example, salts (e.g. chlorides and sulfates) of sodium, potassium and/or calcium. In an embodiment, the byÂ¬products can contain about 0.05 to about 15 weight percent of the inorganic salts.<br>
Other components can include moisture (e.g. water), and unsaponifiable matter.<br>
In an embodiment, the by-product comprises about 20 to about 95 weight percent of fatty acid methyl esters, about 5 to about 80 weight percent fatty acids and salts thereof and about 5 to about 20 weight percent of one or more components selected from inorganic salts, methanol, ethanol, glycerin, glycerides, unsaponifiable materials and combinations thereof.<br>
The coating composition may suitably be applied to any organic or inorganic particulate solid capable of caking or generating dust when disturbed, handled or processed.<br>
In some embodiments, the particulate materials are selected from coal, wood chips, fertilizers, soil, dirt and aggregates.<br>
In other embodiments, the particulate materials are selected from fertilizers.<br>
Typical fertilizers include monoammonium sulfate ("MAP"), diammonium phosphate ("DAP"), trisuperphosphate ("GSTP"), calcium phosphate, ammonium nitrate, potassium nitrate, potassium chloride, potassium sulfate, and the like, and blends thereof. The fertilizer may be in granular, pelletized, crushed, compacted, crystalline or prilled form.<br>
The coating oil composition is applied to the particulate solid in an amount sufficient to at least partially coat the particulate material and reduce dust formation and/or caking of the particulate solid.<br>
In an embodiment, about 0.3 gallons to about 0.9 gallons of by-product is applied per ton of particulate material or fertilizer, wherein the by-product comprises about 20 percent to about 95 percent by weight of said fatty acid esters and about 5 percent to about 80 percent by weight of said fatty acids.<br>
In an embodiment, coating oil composition is formulated as an aqueous emulsion. The emulsion may be formed by mixing the by-product, water and caustic or one or more surfactants. In an embodiment, the caustic is sodium hydroxide. In an embodiment, the aqueous emulsion comprises about 40 to about 60 weight percent of said by-product. In an embodiment, the emulsion is formed by mixing approximately equal portions by weight of by-product and water and up to about   10  percent  by  weight   of sodium  hyrdroxide,   based   on  the   total   weight   of the<br>
 <br>
emulsion.<br>
The coating oil composition may be applied to the particulate material by any of the known methods of applying a liquid to a particulate solid substrate including spraying, film rolling, spraying the composition onto a rotary drum onto which the particulate solid is dropped, and the like.<br>
The foregoing may be better understood by reference to the following example, which is presented for purposes of illustration and is not intended to limit the scope of the invention.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
Lab tests are conducted utilizing 3 3600-gram samples of pelletized fertilizer. Sample 1 is uncoated. Sample 2 is coated with 4.3 grams of Dustrol 3182, a commercially available petroleum based coating oil. Sample 3 is coated with 3.7 grams of a coating oil according to the invention comprising about 40% methyl and/or ethyl esters of fatty acids. Coated samples are prepared by spraying the coating oil onto the fertilizer sample and mixing.<br>
Each sample is placed in a 4-inch diameter, 20-inch long cylinder and the cylinder is rotated at about 60 rpm. Any dust generated is collected on a filter, and weighed.<br>
During the first week of measurement, dust collected from sample 1 is about three times by weight the dust collected from the two samples that are coated. Samples 2 and 3 both have approximately equivalent amount of dust collected. After 4 weeks, the samples are measured again for dust generation. Dust collected from sample 1 is highest by weight. Again samples 2 and 3 have approximately equivalent dust generation, less than sample 1, showing that the economical, environmentally friendly dust control composition of the invention behaves comparably to currently available, petroleum based coating compositions.<br>
Changes can be made in the composition, operation, and arrangement of the method of the invention described herein without departing from the concept and scope of the invention as defined in the claims.</td>
