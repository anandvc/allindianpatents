FIELD OF APPLICATION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing ultra-low carbon steel.<br>
In particular tire invention relates to a method for real time prediction of carbon<br>
concentration in molten steel during RH degassing using a model-free state<br>
estimation technique.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
With continuous increase in the demand for ultra-low carbon steel, the vacuum<br>
circulation refining process (also called RH degassing) has been developed and<br>
applied widely. This process, a component of secondary steel making<br>
technology, has now become an integral part of the whole gamut of steel<br>
production activities.<br><br>
The degassing process is performed in an RH chamber and ladle for producing<br>
ultra-low carbon steel. Oxygen and carbon already present in liquid steel are<br>
made to further react with one another and produce carbon monoxide under<br>
conditions of very low ambient pressure and / or blowing of oxygen into the RH<br>
chamber.<br>
The RH degassing unit essentially comprises a tall degassing chamber of roughly<br>
cylindrical shape internally coated with refractory bricks. The upper part of the<br>
chamber is connected to a gas suction unit. The function of this gas suction unit<br>
is to create a near-vacuum pressure, which promotes reaction between dissolved<br>
carbon and oxygen to generate carbon monoxide and also carbon dioxide. Two<br>
tubular snorkels internally and externally covered with refractory material, of<br>
circular or oval cross section are connected to the bottom part of the chamber.<br>
One of the snorkels has a provision to inject inert gas.<br><br>
Before actual use the chamber is heated to 900° C - 1500° C. The vacuum<br>
chamber is brought close to the ladle containing molten metal and both are<br>
arranged in a way that the two snorkels are immersed to some depth in the<br>
liquid metal. The gas suction unit connected to the chamber, as mentioned<br>
above, is brought into operation thereby creating near-vacuum conditions inside<br>
the chamber. Consequently, certain amount of metal is sucked up into the<br>
chamber from the ladle by rising through the snorkels. Next the inert gas is<br>
injected into one of the snorkels. The main purpose of this injection is to drive<br>
into circulation the molten metal inside the chamber by creating a density<br>
gradient between the metal that is heavily mixed (heterogeneously) with inert<br>
gas and the parts of liquid metal bath with less inert gas component in mixture;<br>
hence this snorkel is called as "ascending snorkel" or "up-snorkel". The molten<br>
metal thus circulating through the chamber, after certain residence time, comes<br>
back to the ladle due to gravity through the second snorkel, which is also known<br>
as "descending snorkel" or "down-snorkel". In this fashion the molten metal<br>
circulates continuously between ladle and chamber. The reduced pressure inside<br>
the chamber promotes the decarburization reaction.<br><br>
The possible reaction zones between carbon and oxygen to produce mainly<br>
carbon monoxide and some carbon dioxide are inside the vacuum chamber,<br>
inside the snorkels and inside the ladle.<br>
Maximum reaction occurs in the liquid layer closest to the vacuum in the<br>
chamber.<br>
The gaseous mixture thus produced is taken out through exit gas channel. Along<br>
with the oxidization of carbon, the other metallurgical operations that are likely<br>
to be performed in the chamber are addition of alloying elements and reheating<br>
of metal by Thermit process.<br>
Once the target concentration of carbon is achieved, aluminum is added to the<br>
steel to completely reduce the oxygen content. Since the reaction between<br>
aluminum and oxygen is exothermic, because of this addition the overall<br>
temperature of the melt increases.<br><br>
To produce various grades of steel with specific compositions by RH degassing<br>
process, and also to avoid steel getting contaminated with alloying agents, it is<br>
very essential to have a system which predicts carbon, oxygen and temperature,<br>
the three main constituents that define the quality of the end product.<br>
Considerable work has been done to find methods of accurately predicting values<br>
of dissolved carbon and oxygen in the molten steel during the degassing process.<br>
Matsuo and Kiyoto at Sumitomo Metal Industries have built up correlation<br>
relations between the CO gas density as observed in a gas density detector<br>
provided in the exhaust gas path of the RH vacuum degassing tank, and the<br>
concentration of Carbon in the steel (Patent No. JP 1222018, 1986). This<br>
correlation is built up from data recorded over a large amount of sample testing,<br>
which is costly, time-consuming and subject to inaccuracies when the process<br>
conditions approach limits at which the samples were taken.<br><br>
Hisashi and Kosaku at Nippon Steel (JP 2298861, 1990) have used a means of<br>
converting the entire carbon-carrying exhaust gas (composed of CO and CO2)<br>
into CO2 by oxidation of CO, and thence continuously carrying a sample into a<br>
mass spectrometer for measuring CO2 content in real time. The mass flow rate<br>
of CO2 is then converted into a decarburization rate from which instantaneous C<br>
concentration is estimated. Inaccuracies are introduced, first, in converting CO2<br>
content in the sample into content for the total exhaust gas, and second, from<br>
leakages from the vacuum vessel which need to be accounted for.<br>
Ryusuke, Shoichi and Masato of Kawasaki Steel (JP 6192724,1994; JP 6192724,<br>
1995) have built a relationship between the difference in C concentration in steel<br>
at an instant and the concentration prevailing at the end of process, and the<br>
difference between exhaust gas flow rate at the corresponding instant and the<br>
exhaust gas flow rate at end of process. The C concentration in steel at different<br>
instances is obtained by sampling. This method is also subject to inaccuracies as<br>
applicable to the approach of Matsuo and Kiyoto mentioned above.<br><br>
Takeshi, Aklra and Takuji at Nippon Kokan (JP 7242928,1995) have constructed<br>
an empirical mathematical model relating exhaust gas content and flow rates,<br>
Argon injection rate, vacuum pressure, molten steel quantity, temperature, etc.<br>
with Carton and Oxygen concentration in molten steel. This empirical model is<br>
constructed from a large number of measurements made on these quantities<br>
during the degassing process; needless to say, it is costly and time consuming,<br>
and to replicate the accuracies attained, will need to be repeated for every new<br>
or modified degassing unit.<br>
Ono et al at Kawasaki (US 5522915; 1996) have used an alternate method<br>
wherein an inert carrier gas is circulated (bubbled) through the molten steel for a<br>
long enough time for the concentration of different gases dissolved in the steel<br>
to attain equilibrium with their concentration in the carrier gas bubbles; then the<br>
carrier gas is collected and analyzed separately for content of each gas -<br>
including nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen, carbon monoxide and water vapour. From<br>
these the Carbon concentration in molten steel is recovered. The inability of this<br>
method to provide results in real time strikes as an obvious disadvantage.<br><br>
Existing methods try to model the chemical reactions and juxtapose them against<br>
the cumulative mass withdrawal of carbon-carrying gases. These methods tend<br>
to be inaccurate due to uncertainties in the estimate of the latter.<br>
A need therefore, existed for steering dear of chemical and mass based<br>
approaches and instead using a model-free technique predicting the point when<br>
the desired level of carbon concentration is attained.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide as estimate of the<br>
carbon and oxygen concentrations, and the temperature, in liquid steel in real<br>
time with high accuracy during the RH degassing process. Robustness across<br>
different RH chamber designs and process conditions is a characteristic of this<br>
invention.<br><br>
Another object of this invention is to provide a method to make the above<br>
estimate that is free of empirical models based on either measurements or<br>
physics or both, and unlinked with chemical, molecular, mass or energy balance<br>
principles. Instead, this method belongs to the class of state estimation<br>
techniques frequently used in the aerospace or transportation domains that<br>
relate dynamic system states to measurables and inputs within a control<br>
theoretic framework, as typical of Kalman Filters for example ("An introduction to<br>
the Kalman Filter". Welch, Greg and Bishop, Gary, University of North Carolina,<br>
http://www.cs.unc.edu/~welch/kalman/.<br>
The above method is called state estimation using evolutionary mapping<br>
approach (SEEMA). It develops an (m x n) piecewise linear map from n states to<br>
m measurables in the initiation phase and then apportions higher-order<br>
components of the evolution of the measurable parameters partly to the<br>
evolution of states and partly to the evolution of this piecewise linear map. Here<br>
n, the number of states, is three-carbon reduction rate, oxygen change rate and<br>
temperature change rate, and m, the number of measurable parameters, is also<br>
three - CO, CO2 and O2 volumetric flow rates.<br><br>
An RH vessel at near-vacuum pressure inside has two snorkels dipped in liquid<br>
steel contained in a ladle held below the vessel. One of the two snorkels is<br>
infused with a pipe through which inert gas Argon is injected that gradually sets<br>
the liquid steel into circulation between the ladle, up the Argon-blowing snorkel,<br>
the RH vessel and then down the other snorkel.<br>
Gases emitted from steel are Sucked out past an exit gas measurement system<br>
based on mass spectrometry that provides the flow rates of carbon-monoxide,<br>
carbon-dioxide and oxygen at high refreshment rates.<br>
The exit gas analysis is obtained with a time delay corresponding to the instant<br>
of release of the gas and its analysis in the gas analyzer.<br>
According to the present invention after neutralizing time delay, the exit gas<br>
values are converted into instantaneous values of carbon and oxygen<br>
concentrations, and temperature of the steel bath, in real time.<br><br>
The method for mapping real time exit gas measurements into instantaneous<br>
dissolved non-metal concentrations is based on the novel technique SEEMA -<br>
state estimation using evolutionary mapping approach. SEEMA does not use any<br>
form of chemical, molecular or mass balance models as typical of extant methods<br>
for carbon prediction in the RH degassing process. SEEMA learns an initial map<br>
between the vector of measurables (exit gases) and the vector of states<br>
(dissolved concentrations) from available initiating data. SEEMA guides this<br>
initial map to evolve with time based on certain assumptions on the nature of<br>
evolution of states and measurables of dynamical physical systems, along with<br>
the actual characteristics of evolution of the measurables.<br>
At any instant of the evolution, the prevailing map is used to convert the current<br>
measurables into current states.<br>
The initial relational data structure for use by SEEMA is generated using another<br>
novel technique, wherein available data on evolution of measurables with time is<br>
averaged across a number of RH process heats to create the first component of<br>
the data structure.<br><br>
Specially measured values of states at the initiating phases of various RH process<br>
heats, mostly different from the set of heats used to generate the first<br>
component, are averaged and their evolution with time is used to create the<br>
second component of the data structure.<br>
The measurables and the states are then linked through the common element -<br>
time - the scale for evolution of either - into a relational data base as needed by<br>
SEEMA.<br>
The relationship between state parameter data and measurement parameter<br>
data, necessary to initiate SEEMA in a degassing process run, is embodied in an<br>
initiation table that is constructed from sampled data taken from a few vacuum<br>
degassing process runs. The linkage between the two sets of variables is<br>
provided by a common factor - time.<br><br>
In the estimation technique the present invention maps the measured<br>
instantaneous flux of exit gases into a corresponding removal rate of carbon and<br>
other dissolved gases in real time. The integration of this removal rate with time<br>
provides the net withdrawal of carbon since the start of process till the instant<br>
under consideration.<br>
The present invention thus provides a method for producing ultra-low carbon<br>
steel comprising the steps of: reducing the pressure inside a RH degassing<br>
chamber using a suction unit; injecting an inert like argon gas through one of a<br>
pair of snorkels dipped in liquid steel contained in a ladle arranged below said RH<br>
chamber; creating a gradual circulation in the liquid steel; reduced pressure<br>
inside the RH chamber promoting formation of CO and CO2; and extracting<br>
exhaust gases continuously for analysis to evaluate proportion of CO and CO2; a<br>
a graphic user interface (GUI) displaying the results of the analysis in real time.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
The invention will now be described with reference to the figures of the drawings<br>
where<br>
Figure 1 is a schematic diagram of RH degassing unit.<br>
Figure 2 is a view illustrating the entire system architecture in a block diagram<br>
form.<br>
Figure 3 shows the relational structure of process initiating data.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Referring to Figure. 1, description is made below of an outline of a conventional<br>
RH degassing process to which the invention is applicable. In this figure, molten<br>
steel 2 is contained in a ladle 1 with a floating slag layer 3 exposed to<br>
atmospheric conditions. A tall cylindrical chamber - the RH reactor chamber 5,<br>
is connected to a gas-suction plant 8 which creates vacuum inside the chamber.<br>
Two snorkels 6, 7 are connected to the bottom of the chamber. One snorkel 6<br>
is having a device 4 to inject Argon.<br><br>
Once the operator signals the start of degassing process, as a first step, reaction<br>
chamber 5 is brought close to ladle 1, such that the two snorkels 6, 7 are<br>
immersed well into the bath 2. Thereafter gas suction unit 8 reduces the<br>
pressure inside the chamber. Because of the pressure difference between<br>
chamber 5 and ladle 1, some amount of the molten metal 2 is sucked up into<br>
the chamber 5 through both snorkels, such that the height of metal balances the<br>
difference between the external atmospheric pressure and the internal chamber<br>
pressure. At this point of time, inert gas Argon is injected into the up-snorkel 6<br>
by means of the device 4. Thus a gas-liquid mixture 9 is formed inside the<br>
chamber. In the vicinity of the up-snorkel, the heterogeneous steel-Argon<br>
mixture is of lower density as compared to the rest of the molten steel, hence it<br>
tends to rise up creating a gradual circulation - laterally between the up and<br>
down-snorkels in the chamber, down the down-snorkel, and then laterally from<br>
down - to up - snorkel in the ladle. Part of Argon gas acquired in up-snorkel 6 is<br>
released from steel as it passes from up-snorkel 6 to down-snorkel 7 within the<br>
chamber. Thus the molten metal 9 inside the chamber 5 comes back to the<br>
ladle through the second (down) snorkel 7.<br><br>
Reduced pressure inside the chamber promotes decarburization. In other words<br>
the reaction between dissolved carbon and oxygen that produces mostly carbon<br>
monoxide and partially carbon dioxide 11 speeds up. A provision 10 to inject<br>
oxygen helps in further decarburization of steel to produce ultra low carbon<br>
compositions. Exhaust gases are extracted and continuously sampled for gas<br>
analysis to evaluate the proportions of carbon monoxide and dioxide.<br>
Fig. 2 is a schematic representation of the system architecture. From field 12,<br>
i.e. RH degassing unit, signals 13 are tapped continuously in real time, and<br>
routed to PLC 14. These signals are tapped from the various instruments that<br>
measure vacuum pressure inside the chamber 5, Argon flow rate, carbon<br>
monoxide, carbon dioxide and also oxygen proportions from gas analyzer. All<br>
these signals are in analog form, hence converted into digital values by A/D<br>
converter card 15. A CIM card 16 loaded with modbus driver software is<br>
inserted in one of the slots of the above said PLC 14. A two-way data<br>
communication is established between PLC 14 and CIM card 16 through back<br>
plane communication 17. Another software to fetch the data routed from CIM<br><br>
card is loaded in the PC 19, which acts as computing platform. The<br>
communication between CIM card and PC 19 is established by means of serial<br>
communication 18. The real time computational algorithm, responsible for<br>
estimating Carbon, Oxygen and Temperature is loaded and executes on PC 19.<br>
Details of this algorithm are explained in the following paragraphs. Results of<br>
real time computation are displayed in a computer 20, through a software<br>
program that supports graphical user interface features. The communication<br>
between PC 19 acting as computing platform for algorithm software and to the<br>
PC 20, acting as Man-Machine-Interface is by means of TCP/IP 21.<br>
Details of the computational algorithm SEEMA as applied to the RH degassing<br>
process for estimating carbon and oxygen concentrations and temperature in the<br>
liquid steel in real time, from measurements of volumetric flow rates of CO, CO2<br>
and O2 are explained below.<br><br>
Let Xk, yK represent the vector of states and the vector of measurables,<br>
respectively, at time instant k, where<br><br>
and<br><br>
It may be noted that both states and measurables are in fact rates of change of<br>
concentration and rates of flow, as seen in equations (1-2), rather than the<br>
absolute values of respective variables. Of course our interest lies in Carbon<br>
content and Oxygen content, in parts per million, and temperature in degrees<br>
Celsius, these can be simply recovered as<br><br>
and similarly for oxygen and temperature.<br><br>
Now, yK is available at polling frequency, and is likely to show undesirable minor<br>
fluctuations due to noise. Assuming that the noise is white, taking moving<br>
average will reduce the effect of this noise, and larger the base of the moving<br>
average, the more complete will be the cancellation. A moving average across<br>
eleven polling instances is taken.<br>
also the exact representation of yK-1 is explained in step 5 below.<br>
Going over the estimation steps, first, a second order filter yk of measurable<br>
vector Yk is extracted using the sequence of available measurements and second<br>
order Taylor series formula as<br><br><br>
It may be noted that the first and second derivatives are centered at Yk-1/2 and<br>
yK-1 instead of at YK-3/2 and yk-2, as would normally happen in any Taylor series<br>
extrapolation.<br>
Second, the second order filter of measurables yk is used to obtain a corrected<br>
estimate of Xk following the steps outlined below:<br><br>
where fk-1(.) represents the second order Taylor series extrapolation formula<br>
from Xk-1 as<br><br><br>
Next the estimate of xK obtained in equation (5.1) is passed through the quasi-<br>
linear map Hk-1 to obtain an estimate of the measurable yk as<br><br>
Where H is a quasi - linear mapping from the vector of states to the vector of<br>
measurables of the form<br><br>
The mapping H is obtained from the initial data table for every process run by<br>
using the values of CO, CO2 and O2 (their volumetric flow rates from exhaust gas<br>
analyzer) as prevailing at 4 selected time instances to extract the corresponding<br>
values of Xk, and then using least square minimization coupled with Singular<br>
Value Decomposition Method ("Numerical Recipes in C", Press, William,<br>
Teukolsky, Saul, Vetterling, William and Flannery, Brian, Cambridge University<br>
Press, 1992) of solution of a linear system of equations to get H. The value of H<br>
thus obtained at the initial step is then updated at every fourth step of the<br>
process as described in step four below.<br><br>
The obtained value of Yk in equations (5.2) is then subtracted from the quadratic<br>
filter of measurables yk (from step one) to obtain the error estimate at quadratic<br>
level of measurables eyk as<br><br>
The error in y is then transformed into the error in x by the inverse map of H as<br><br>
Finally the corrected estimate of Xk is obtained by adding the obtained error exk<br>
to the initial estimate as<br><br>
This completes the second step of the application of SEEMA to the carbon<br>
concentration prediction problem in the RH degasser.<br><br>
At the third step, the third order term of the Taylor series expression for the<br>
vector of measurables y (refer to equation (4)), denoted as ΔYK, is calculated as<br><br>
6<br>
This term plays an important role in directing the evolution of Hk with time, as<br>
shown below.<br>
The fourth step involves updating the elements of Hk. This is performed as<br>
follows:<br>
Let ΔHk = Hk- Hk-1, implying Hk = Hk-1 + ΔHk	(7)<br>
Where ΔHk represents the change in Hk-1, and is framed with the objective of<br>
neutralizing Δyk for known Xk. Thus, with reference to the basic form of Hk as<br>
expressed in equations (5.2.) and (5.2.1), one may write<br><br><br>
wherein, comprising differences between equation (8) and equations (5.2 &amp;<br>
5.2.1), one may write<br><br>
Equation (9) is used to update the value of H at every fourth time step. In a set<br>
of 4 time steps, let us call them 4n+l, 4n+2, 4n+3 and 4n+4, the values of x<br>
and Ay at 4n+l, 4n+2 and 4n+3 are used to create 3 sets of linear equations of<br>
size 3, to solve for the 9 elements of Ah using Singular Value Decomposition.<br>
Then the updated H, as shown in equation (7), is used in step 4n+4.<br>
The fifth and final step is a cyclical repetition of steps one to four as the<br>
evolution continues. Thus, from previous values of x and y and the<br>
measurements at current step, Taylor series extrapolations are used to update<br><br>
the second-order filtered value of y (equation 4) and estimate of x (equation<br>
5.1.1). Next, the existing map H is used to correct the estimate of x from error<br>
is prediction of y (equations 5.1 - 5.5). Since y may be changing at orders<br>
higher than second, while x is constrained to evolve following a quadratic form,<br>
the difference is apportioned to an evolution of the mapping H. This is done by<br>
obtaining the third-order filter of y (equation 6), and transforming it into a<br>
corresponding delta-matrix of H (equations 7-9). It may be noted here that the<br>
value of Yk-1 shown in equation (4) is obtained as<br>
Yk-1 = Yk-1 + Δyk-1	(10)<br>
where right hand terms are obtained from equations (4) and (6) at the previous<br>
time steps.<br>
Further, there is a delay of around 36 seconds between the instant of emanation<br>
of gas molecules from liquid steel and its analysis at the gas analyzer. Hence, it<br>
is understood that the values of Xk obtained from yk at an instant, in reality<br>
represent the values of XK pertaining to 36 seconds earlier. This is the deviation<br>
from real time conditions, and is accounted for by making a second-order Taylor<br>
series extrapolation forward from currently obtained Xk with a time step size - Δt<br>
- of 36 seconds, thus using obtained values, apart from the current, at 36 and 72<br>
seconds backward in equation (5.1.1).<br><br>
As mentioned earlier, the SEEMA process is set in motion by creating an initial<br>
mapping H between states xk and measurables yk. This mapping is generated<br>
from data on xk and yk acquired from the initiation stages of different process<br>
runs (heats) and stored in a relational data table. The data on yk obtained from<br>
gas analyzer at one second intervals is averaged over a substantial number<br>
(about 20) of process runs and its variation with time form the three axes of the<br>
table - one axis each for CO, CO2 and O2 - see Figure 3. In effect, on all three<br>
axes time increases linearly from starting instant to about 70 seconds, and at<br>
each point on an axis (i.e. instant of time) the obtained (average) value of the<br>
component of yk corresponding to that axis (say CO) is marked. It is not at all<br>
necessary that the measurable values also follow a monotonously linear trend.<br>
Next, the values of C, O and T, i.e. components of Xk, of liquid steel are sampled<br>
at different points in the first 3-4 minutes of a substantial (around 20) number of<br>
heats, and the variation with time at 1 second intervals is obtained by first fitting<br>
cubic splines against time, and then averaging across heats. The components of<br>
Xk at each instant are then inserted into the diagonal elements of the table (see<br>
Figure 3). The off-diagonal elements occupy null value. The basis heats from<br>
which averages are extracted and fitted are different for measurables and states.<br><br>
As may be appreciated from the tabular structure, the values of Xk and yk are<br>
linked to each other through time.<br>
Now, to initiate the process the values of XK and yk have to be obtained at four<br>
instances t1, t2, t3 and t4 corresponding to k = 1,.., 4. At an instant k, the values<br>
of yk are first read from the analyzer. Next, the position on each of the 3 axes<br>
corresponding to the 3 respective values of yk, i.e. the 3 Virtual times' are noted.<br>
To each of these 3 Virtual times' correspond one value (actually 3 values -<br>
elements of Xk) of vector Xk. The simple average across these 3 Virtual times' are<br>
taken as the representative values of Xk corresponding to the measured yk.<br><br>
