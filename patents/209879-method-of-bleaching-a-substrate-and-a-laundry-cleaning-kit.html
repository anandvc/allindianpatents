Title of the invention<br>
A METHOD OF BLEACHING A SUBSTRATE AND A LAUNDRY CLEANING KIT<br>
HINDUSTAN LEVER LIMITED, a company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1913 having its registered office at Hindustan Lever House, 165/166, Backbay Reclamation, Mumbai-400 020, State of Maharashtra, India<br><br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed<br><br><br><br>
 FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a commercial air bleaching laundry product together with instructions for its use.  The invention also relates to a two step treatment for the bleaching of stains.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The use of bleaching catalysts for stain removal has been developed over recent years.  The recent discovery that some catalysts are capable of bleaching effectively with air has recently become the focus of some interest, for example, GB applications: 9906474.3; 9907714.1; and 9907713.3 (all Unilever). As with any cleaning product a more economical use of active components and effective stain bleaching profile is sought.<br>
In addition to the above, there is an increasing public awareness of environmental issues, in particular water pollution. The ubiquitous use of additives in laundry detergents results in substantial quantities of these additives ending up in waste water effluent.  The public welcomes any reduction in these additives found in water waste effluent.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a product that is attractive to the consumer in terms of a product that contains less peroxyl species over that of present conventional peroxyl containing laundry detergents. In addition, it is also an object of the present invention to provide a product together with instructions so that a wider stain bleaching profile may be realised by the consumer than when an air bleaching laundry detergent is used in a single cleaning step.<br>
2<br><br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
We have found that not all peroxyl-activating catalysts are capable of functioning as air bleaching catalyst. However, the converse is not true.  All air bleaching catalysts function as peroxyl activation catalysts. We have also found that the majority of air bleaching catalysts, in air bleaching mode, are more effective against certain types of stains than others. In this regard, the present invention provides a method of selectively treating stains that are more resistant to air bleaching than others.<br>
The consumer is aware what constitutes a catechol-type or polyphenolics-type or polycyclic hydroxylated aromatic-type stain but not in those terms.  The consumer recognizes these stains as tea, coffee, blackberry, blueberry, blackcurrant, red wine, banana and the like.  These stains are characteristic and distinct from oily food type stains such as tomato oil stain, curry oil stain, mango stain, annatto derived stain, colorau derived stain, and sebum derived stain etc.<br>
It is the tea, coffee, blackberry, blueberry, blackcurrant, red wine, banana and stains of this type that are presently more resistant to bleaching with air than with a peroxyl species, with or without a peroxyl activating catalyst.<br>
The present invention provides an air bleaching laundry detergent and instructions for its use with a peroxyl species. The present invention also extends to a kit comprising a laundry bleaching composition comprising an air<br>
3<br><br>
bleaching product and an applicator containing a peroxyl species together with instructions for its use. As presently found in the patent literature many classes of compounds have been found to be suitable as air bleaching catalysts.  It is inevitable that more classes of air bleaching catalysts will be discovered.<br>
The present invention provides a commercial bleaching composition1 comprising an air bleaching catalyst for bleaching a substrate with atmospheric oxygen, the bleaching composition upon addition to an aqueous medium providing an aqueous bleaching medium substantially devoid of a peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or peroxyl-generating bleach system, together with instructions for the local application of a peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or a peroxyl-generating bleach system to a fabric stain before or after washing.  In instances where the stain for treatment is dry it will be necessary to dampen a stained area to effect better stain removal.  Suitable dampening means are in the form of liquids and gels containing water, alcohol, glycerol and the like.<br>
The present invention also provides a laundry cleaning kit (kit of parts) comprising the commercial bleaching composition together with an applicator comprising a peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or peroxyl-generating bleach system for local application of the peroxygen bleach or the peroxy-based or the peroxyl-generating bleach system to a stained substrate.<br>
4<br><br>
The applicator comprising peroxygen bleach or a peroxy-based or peroxyl-generating bleach system for local application may also comprise a peroxyl-bleaching catalyst.<br>
The present invention also extends to a method of treating a stain that is resistant to air bleaching.<br>

Peroxyl Species<br>
71<br><br>
As one skilled in the art will appreciate there are numerous suitable peroxy species that will provide a bleaching activity. In many instances it is also preferred to use a peroxyl activating catalyst for the treatment of stains. Suitable peroxy species are found in the following general classes of compounds: peroxyacids; peroxides, peroxysulphates, peroxyphosphates, etc.<br>
The peroxy bleaches that can be utilised in the present invention include hydrogen peroxide, hydrogen peroxide-liberating compounds, hydrogen peroxide- generating systems, peroxy acids and their salts and peroxy acid bleach percursor system, monoperoxysulphate salts, peroxyphosphate salt and mixtures thereof. Hydrogen peroxide sources are well known in the art. They include alkali metal peroxides, organic peroxidase bleaching compounds such as urea peroxide, and inorganic persalt bleaching compounds, such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, peroxyphosphates, and peroxysulphates. Mixtures of two or more of such compounds may also be suitable. Particularly preferred are sodium perborate or sodium percarbonate. These bleaching compounds may further be employed in conjunction with a peroxyacid bleaching precursor, for example tetraacetylethylenediamine (TAED) or sodium nonanoyloxybenzenesulphonate (SNOBS). The use of a peroxyacid bleaching precursor as detailed above for bleaching a substrate will likely reduce the presence of bacteria on washed laundry, improve bleaching performance and in the case of white fabric increase the overall whiteness appearance of the white fabric.<br>
Peroxyacid bleaches and their precursors are known and amply described in literature. Suitable examples of this general class include magnesium monoperoxyphthalate hexahydrate<br>
72<br><br>
(INTEROX), metachloroperbenzoic acid, 4-nonylamino-4-oxoperoxybutyric acid and diperoxydodecanedioic acid, 6-nonylamino-6-oxoperoxycaproic acid (NAPAA), peroxybenzoic acid, ring-substituted peroxybenzoic acids, e.g., peroxy-o-naphthoic acid, peroxylauric acid, peroxystearic acid, 1,9-diperoxyazelaic acid, 1,12-diperoxydodecanedioic acid, diperoxybrassylic acid, diperoxysebacic acid, diperoxyisophthalic acid, 2-decyldiperoxybutane-l,4-dioic acid, 4,4'-sulphonybisperoxybenzoic acid, N,N-phthaloylaminoperoxycaproic acid (PAP), and nonanoyloxybenzenesulphonate (SNOBS).  Other examples of peroxyacid bleaches and their precursors are described in Chemistry &amp; Industry (15 October 1990), 647-653, an article by Grime and Clauss.<br>
Bleach Activators may also be applied in the treatment of the stain. Bleach Activators are discussed in detail in WO0050549, pages 27 to 30 of which are herein incorporated by reference.  In addition, a redox enzyme may be present to activate hydrogen peroxide if present e.g. a peroxidase, see for example WO0047707 and W09412621.<br>
It is preferred that the peroxygen bleach contains a sequestrant.  The following are examples of sequestrants that may be used: ethylenediamine tetraacetate (EDTA); diethylenetriamine pentamethylene phosphonate (DETPMP); ethylenediamine tetramethylene phosphonate (EDTMP); diethylene triamine penta (methylene phosphonic acid) (DTPMP); hexamethylene diamine tetraphosphonic acid (HMDTP); nitrilotrismethylenephosphonic acid (NTMP); and, hydroxyethyl-1,1-diphosphonic acid (HEDP).  The aforementioned examples also extend to salts thereof.  The<br>
73<br><br>
purpose of the sequesterent is to chelate metal ions thereby extending the lifetime of the peroxygen bleach.<br>
Applicator<br>
Suitable applicators for the application of the peroxyl precursor species or peroxyl precursor to the stain include sprays, pens, roller-ball devices, bars, soft solid applicator sticks and impregnated cloths or cloths containing microcapsules. Such means are well known in the analogous art of deodorant application and/or in spot treatment of textiles.  The applicator may also contain a peroxyl-bleaching catalyst.  If required the peroxyl precursor species or peroxyl precursor and peroxyl-bleaching catalyst are dispensed such that they come into contact after dispensing.  It will be evident to one skilled in the art what substances need to be kept separate before application to preserve their active lifetimes. Such means of individual application of ingredients will be evident to one skilled in the art.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Synthesis of the complex [ (MeN4Py)FeCl]Cl :<br>
The MeN4py ligand (N,N-bis(pyridin-2-yl-methyl)-1,1-bis(pyridin-2-yl)-1-aminoethane) was prepared as described elsewhere (EP 0 909 809 A2).<br>
MeN4Py ligand (33.7 g; 88.5mmoles) was dissolved in 500ml dry methanol. Small portions of FeCl2.4H2o (0.95eq; 16.7g; 84.0mmoles) were added, yielding a clear red solution. After addition, the solution was stirred for 30 minutes at room temperature, after which the methanol was removed (rotary-evaporator) . The dry solid was ground and 150 ml of ethylacetate was added and the mixture was stirred until a<br>
74<br><br>
i<br><br>
fine red powder was obtained. This powder was washed twice with ethyl acetate, dried in the air and further dried under vacuum (40 °C) . El. Anal. Calc. for [Fe (MeN4py) CI] Cl. 2H2O: C 53.03; H  5.16; N 12.89; Cl 13.07; Fe 10.01%. Found C 52.29/52.03; H 5.05/5.03; N 12.55/12.61; Cl: 12.73/12.69; Fe: 10.06/10.01%.<br>
Experimental Protocol<br>
To an aqueous solution containing 10 mM carbonate buffer (pH 10) with 0.6 g/1 Na-LAS (linear alkylbenzene sulphonate), stained cloths were added and stirred for 30 minutes at 30 °C (controls). In a second series of experiments, the same tests were done in the presence of 10 DM of [FeMeN4py) Cl] Cl. The optical qualities of the cloths were then measured immediately after rinsing with water and/or after 24 h drying at 30 °C. Results are shown in Table 1. The optical qualities of the cloths were measured with a Linotype-Hell scanner (ex Linotype). The change in colour (bleaching) is expressed as a DE value. The measured colour difference (DE) between the washed cloth and a clean cotton cloth is defined as follows:<br><br>
wherein DL is a measure for the difference in darkness between the washed and unwashed test cloth; Da and Db are measures for the difference in redness and yellowness respectively between both cloths. With regard to this colour measurement technique, reference is made to Commission International de l'Eclairage (CIE); Recommendation on Uniform Colour Spaces, colour difference equations, psychometric colour terms, supplement no 2 to CIE<br>
75<br><br>
Publication, no 15, Colormetry, Bureau Central de la CIE, Paris 1978. A lower value for the DE values in the Table 1, shows a better cleaning performance.  The controls showed little change in AE.  Cloths with the following types of stains were used in the experiments: TO (tomato oil), BC-1 (tea), and CS-12 (blackcurrant).  The following results were reproducible.<br>
Table 1<br><br>
It is evident from Table 1 that the tea stain (BC-1) has undergone little if any discernible air bleaching in comparison to the tomato oil stain.<br>
Post-treatment Protocol<br>
Subsequent treatment of the BC-1 (tea Stain) with a dilute 2 mM aqueous PAP (N,N-phthaloylaminoperoxycaproic acid) solution showed a significant discernible change in colour towards the white after a few minutes.<br>
Pre-treatment protocol<br>
The following experiment illustrates pre-treatment results on stains resistant to air bleaching.  In Table 2,   AE values reflect a comparison with the original stained cloth in contrast to the results given in Table 1. Hence a higher value of E is indicative of a greater bleaching activity. Substantially the same conditions were employed as described in the experimental protocol except with slight modification<br>
76<br><br>
as is evident from Table 2.  The stained cloths employed were BC-1 (tea) and CS-12 (blackcurrant stain, ex CFT).<br>
Table 2<br><br>
77<br>
The results shown in Table 2 illustrate the effectiveness of hydrogen peroxide in bleaching air bleaching resistant stains.  In addition, the synergetic combination of a peroxyl-bleaching catalyst in combination with hydrogen peroxide is exemplified.<br><br><br>
