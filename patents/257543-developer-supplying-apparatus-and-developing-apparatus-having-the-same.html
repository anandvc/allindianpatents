DEVELOPER SUPPLYING APPARATUS AND DEVELOPING APPARATUS HAVING THE SAME<br><br>
2. APPLICANT:<br><br>
CD<br>
E<br>
Q	Address: 416, Maetan-dong, Yeongtong-gu, Suwon-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea<br>
Nationality: Republic of Korea<br>
7	Name: Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.<br><br>
3. PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION:<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:<br><br><br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a developer supply of an image forming apparatus, and more particularly, to a developer supplying apparatus with a separate developer cartridge, and to a developing apparatus having the same.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a conventional image forming apparatus. As illustrated, the conventional image forming apparatus comprises a feeding unit 10 to load printing media, an image forming unit 20 to form an image on the printing media supplied from the feeding unit 10, a fixing unit 30 to fix the image on the surface of the printing medium by applying heat and pressure to the developer image formed on the printing medium, and a delivery unit 40 to discharge printing medium to exterior.<br>
The image forming unit 20 may include a photoconductor, a charging unit to charge the photoconductor to an electric potential, a light exposure unit to form an electrostatic latent image on the photoconductor, a developing apparatus to develop the electrostatic latent image on the photoconductor by applying the developer thereto, and a transfer unit to transfer the image developed on the photoconductor onto the printing medium.<br>
The developing apparatus includes a developing roller to apply the developer on the photoconductor, and a developer supplying roller to supply the developer to the developing roller. A developing apparatus may be classified into one of an integrated type in which the developer is held within the casing as the developing apparatus, and a<br>
2<br><br>
separate developer cartridge type, in which the developer is held in a separated casing (hereinafter referred to as a developer cartridge), which may be detachable from the developing cartridge, which houses the other portions, e.g., the developing roller, the developer supplying roller, or the like, of the developing apparatus.<br>
In the case of a removable developer cartridge type, the developer may be supplied from the developer cartridge to the developing cartridge by mainly either the use of an auger that transports the developer or by allowing the developer to free fall.<br>
When an auger is used, the auger is typically disposed in the path connecting the developer cartridge with the developing cartridge, and the developer is supplied by the rotation of the auger. According to this method, a horizontal or a level path connecting the developer cartridge with the developing cartridge is provided. If the path is. sufficiently slanted, the developer can still free fall or slide along the slope independent of the rotation of the auger so that a precise control of the amount of the developer being supplied may be difficult. In some cases, the straight path may not be possible because other components may be in the way, and thus a meandering path may be necessary, which requires a flexible auger to be used, which in turn increases the material cost.<br>
In the method of using the free fall of the developer, the path connecting the developer cartridge with the developing cartridge is vertical or is slanted with a sufficient slope to allow the developer to free fall into the developing cartridge. According to this method, however, lumps of the developer may form along the path. Because the viscosity and/or the fluidity of the developer may vary according to the<br>
3<br><br>
surrounding environmental conditions and/or the state of the particular developer, over time the developer particles may aggregate together to form lumps, and may accumulate, e.g., along the walls of the path. As a result, the motor for supplying the developer may not operate properly, and an overload of the same may occur, and/or the developer may not be supplied properly so that the quality of the printed image may suffer.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF SEVERAL EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention will be described more fully hereinafter with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which several embodiments of the invention are shown.<br>
FIGS. 2 and 3 illustrate a developing apparatus and a.sectional view thereof according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
8<br><br>
A developer cartridge 101 holds the developer. An agitating member 102 is provided in the developer cartridge 101. The agitating member 102 agitates the developer in the developer cartridge 101, and transfers the agitated developer to a path 121, which connects the developer cartridge 101 to a developing cartridge 111.<br>
The developing cartridge 111 may comprise a developing roller 113 and a supplying roller 114, and may or may not include within its housing a photoconductive medium 112. An electrostatic latent image may be formed on the surface of the photoconductive medium 112 by being exposed to a light from a light exposure unit (not shown). The developing roller 113 applies the developer on the electrostatic latent image on the surface of the photoconductive medium 112. The supplying roller 114 supplies the developer to the developing roller 113.<br>
i	The path 121 forms the passage between the developer cartridge 101 and the<br>
developing cartridge 111, allowing the developer in the developer cartridge 101 free fall onto, and to thus be supplied to, the developing cartridge 111.<br>
A developer lump removal member 131 is disposed in the interior of the path 121. In an embodiment, the developer lump removal member 131 may be driven by a driving source 141 to move in a repeated and continuous motion to prevent the developer particles from aggregating together and/or to remove or break apart lumps of developer that had already formed on the path 121. The motion of the developer lump removal member 131 could alternatively be made periodic and/or random.<br>
9<br><br>
The developer lump removal member 131 may be an elastic member such as a spring. The elastic member may be made to be compressed and extended repeatedly to prevent or clear the lumped developer inside the path 121.<br>
By using the developer lump removal member 131, aggregation of the developer into lumps in the path 121 can be prevented as the movement of the developer lump removal member 131 promotes the developer particles to remain segregated. The developer lump removal member 131 may also break up lumps that had already been, formed in the path 121. This in turn reduces the likelihood of blockage of the path 121, and thus reduces the possibility of the overloading of the developer supply motor and/or the quality degradation of printed images due to improper supply of the developer to the developer cartridge 111.<br>
The driving source 141 provides driving force to move the developer lump removal member 131. The driving source 141 may be a solenoid moving in a reciprocating linear motion, or a motor that provides a rotational motion. A motor 141 may be a motor disposed in the developer cartridge 101 or in the developing cartridge 111, or may be a dedicated motor to drive the developer lump removal member 131, exclusively. The driving source 141 may be directly connected with the developer lump removal member 131, or connected with the developer lump removal member 331 through a motional force delivery mechanism.<br>
A motional force delivery mechanism transfers the motion from the driving source to the developer lump removal member 131, and may also change the direction of the motion. The motion power delivery mechanism may, for example, convert the<br>
10<br><br>
rotational motion into a reciprocating linear motion, which is then transferred to the developer lump removal member 131. A cam may be a representative example of such a motional force delivery mechanism.<br>
FIG. 4 is a view illustrating the structure and operation of a motional force delivery mechanism according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
A rotating unit 150 is connected to a source of rotational motion, for example, a motor, and rotates about a rotational axis. An eccentric rotating protrusion 151 is extended eccentrically from, in other words, off the rotational axis of, the rotating unit 150. The eccentric rotating protrusion 151 moves in a circular motion while the rotating unit 150 rotates. The eccentric rotating protrusion 151 is inserted into an opening 153 of a loop member 152, and slides within the opening 153 of the loop member 152 while the eccentric rotating protrusion 151 moves in the circular motion. According to movement of the eccentric rotating protrusion 151 in the opening 153, the loop member 152 performs a reciprocating linear motion. In an embodiment, the length of the opening 153 may preferably be equal to or longer than the diameter of the circular path along which the eccentric rotating protrusion 151 travels.<br>
The loop member 152 is coupled to one end of the developer lump removal member 131. As such, the developer lump removal member 131 moves in a reciprocating linear motion according to the reciprocating linear motion of the loop member 152. If the developer lump removal member 131 is an elastic member, the developer lump removal member 131 may repeat compression and extension. As described  above,  the  developer  lump  removal  member   131   moves  on  the  path<br>
11<br><br>
connecting the developer cartridge 101 with a developing cartridge 111 such that the developer lump removal member 131 may prevent the formation of lumps of developer in the path 121 or may break up or clear the lumps of developer that may have formed in the path 121.<br>
As described above, according to the exemplary embodiments of the present invention, accumulation or aggregation of the developer along the developer passage between a developer cartridge and a developing cartridge is prevented. An overload of a developer supply motor or a lowered image quality due to clogged developer supplying path, is accordingly reduced.<br>
While the.present invention has been particularly shown and described with reference to exemplary embodiments thereof, it will be understood, by those of ordinary skill.in the art that various changes in form and details may be made therein without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention as defined by the appended claims. The exemplary embodiments should be considered in descriptive sense only and not for purposes of limitation.
