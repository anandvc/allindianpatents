[0032] The transmission 10 also includes a plurality of torque-transmitting mechanisms or devices including a first clutch 66, a second clutch 68, a third clutch 70, a first brake 72 and a second brake 74. The first clutch 66 is selectively engagable to connect the first shaft or intermediate member 42 to the sixth shaft or intermediate member 52. The second clutch 68 is selectively engagable to connect the input shaft or member 14 to the sixth shaft or intermediate member 52. The third clutch 70 is selectively engagable to connect the third member or intermediate member 46 to the sixth shaft or intermediate member 52. The first brake 72 is selectively engagable to connect the second shaft or intermediate member 44 to the transmission housing 12 to restrict rotation of the member 44 relative to the transmission housing 12. Finally, the second brake 74 is selectively engagable to connect the seventh shaft or intermediate member 54 to the transmission housing 12 to restrict rotation of the member 54 relative to the transmission housing 12.<br>
[0033] The transmission 10 is capable of transmitting torque from the input shaft or member 14 to the output shaft or member 16 in at least eight forward torque ratios and one reverse torque ratio. Each of the forward torque ratios and the reverse torque ratio are attained by engagement of one or more of the torque-transmitting mechanisms (i.e. first clutch 66, second clutch 68,<br>
 <br>
third clutch 70, first brake 72 and second brake 74). Those skilled in the art will readily understand that a different speed ratio is associated with each torque ratio. Thus, eight forward speed ratios may be attained by the transmission 10.<br>
[0034] The transmission housing 12 includes a first wall or structural member 102, a second wall or structural member 104 and a third wall or structural member 106. The third wall 106 interconnects the first and second walls 102 and 104 to define a space or cavity 110. Input shaft or member 14 is supported by the first wall 102 by bearings 112. Output shaft or member 16 is supported by the second wall 104 by bearings 114. The planetary gear sets 20, 22, 24 and 26 and the torque-transmitting mechanisms 66, 68, 70, 72 and 74 are disposed within cavity 110. Further, cavity 110 has a plurality of areas or zones A, B, C, D, E, and F in which the plurality of torque transmitting mechanisms 66, 68, 70, 72 and 74 will be specifically positioned or mounted, in accordance with the preferred embodiments of the present invention.<br>
[0035] As shown in FIG. 1A, zone A is defined by the area or space bounded by: the first wall 102, planetary gear set 22, radially inward by a reference line "L" which is a longitudinal line that is axialiy aligned with the input shaft 14, and radially outward by a reference line "M" which is a longitudinal line that extends adjacent an outer diameter or outer periphery of the planetary gear sets 20, 22, 24 and 26. While reference line "M" is illustrated as a straight tine throughout the several views, it should be appreciated that reference line "M" follows the outer periphery of the planetary gear sets 20, 22, 24 and 26, and<br>
 <br>
accordingly may be stepped or non-linear depending on the location of the outer periphery of each of the planetary gear sets 20, 22, 24 and 26. Zone B is defined by the area bounded by: planetary gear set 22, the planetary gear set 20, radially outward by reference line "M", and radially inward by reference line "L". Zone C is defined by the area bounded by: the planetary gear set 20, the planetary gear set 26, radially outward by reference line "M", and radially inward by reference line "L". Zone D is defined by the area bounded by: the planetary gear set 24, the planetary gear set 26, radially outward by reference line "M", and radially inward by reference line "L". Zone E is defined by the area bounded by: the planetary gear set 24, the second end wall 104, radially outward by reference line "M", and radially inward by reference line "L". Zone F is defined by the area bounded by: the first wall 102, the second wail 104, radially inward by reference line "M" and radially outward by the third wall 106.<br>
[0036] In the gear arrangement 18 of transmission 10 shown in FIG. 1A, the planetary gear set 22 is disposed closest to the first wall 102, the planetary gear set 24 is disposed closest to the second wall 104, the planetary gear set 20 is disposed adjacent the planetary gear set 22, and the planetary gear set 26 is disposed between the planetary gear sets 20 and 24. The torque-transmitting mechanisms are intentionally located within specific Zones in order to provide advantages in overall transmission size, packaging efficiency, and reduced manufacturing complexity. In the particular example shown in FIG. 1A, the first and second clutches 66 and 68 and the first and<br>
 <br>
second brakes 72 and 74 are disposed within Zone F and the third clutch 70 is disposed within Zone A.<br>
[0037] However, the present invention contemplates other embodiments where the torque-transmitting mechanisms 66, 68, 70, 72 and 74 are disposed in the other Zones. The feasible locations of the torque-transmitting mechanisms 66, 68, 70, 72 and 74 within the Zones are shown in the chart of FIG. 1B. The chart of FIG. 1B lists clutches and brakes in the left most column and the available zones to locate the clutch/brake in the top row. An "X" in the chart indicates that the present invention contemplates locating the clutch or brake in the zone listed in the top row. For example, first brake 72 may be located in zones A, C, E or F, second brake 74 may be located in zones A, E or F, first clutch 66 may be located in zones A, B or F, second clutch 68 may be located in zones A, B or F and third clutch 70 may be located in zones A, B or F.<br>
[0038] Referring now to FIG. 2, a front wheel drive powertrain 150 incorporating a transaxle 154 is illustrated, in accordance with the embodiments of the present invention. Transaxle 154 includes the transmission 10 having the gear arrangement 18 of FIGS. 1A and 1B. Transaxle 154 is mounted to an engine 156. Engine 156 produces a driving torque in an engine output shaft 157 that drives the input shaft 14 of transmission 10, as described below. Engine 156 is generally an internal combustion engine, however, the present invention contemplates other types of engines such as electric and hybrid engines. Further, transaxle 154 includes a transfer chain or belt 158, a drive<br>
 <br>
sprocket or gear 160, a driven sprocket or gear 162, a differential 164, a final drive planetary gear set 166 and a pair of drive axles 168 and 170 that drive a pair of road wheels 172 and 174, respectively.<br>
[0039] Transfer chain or belt 158 engages, at a first end 180, drive sprocket or gear 160 and at a second end 182 the driven sprocket or gear 162. The drive sprocket or gear 160 is coupled to engine output shaft or member 157. Driven sprocket 162 is rotatably fixed to a drive shaft or rotatable member 159. Drive shaft or rotatabie member 159 is coupled to the input shaft 14 of transmission 10. The output shaft 16 of transmission 10 is connected to an output sleeve shaft 163. Output sleeve shaft 163 is coupled to a sun gear of a final drive planetary gear set 166 to achieve the desired gear ratio. A carrier member of final drive planetary gear set 166 supports a plurality of pinion gears which mesh with both the sun gear and a ring gear of final drive planetary gear set 166. The carrier member of final drive planetary gear set 166 is rotatably coupled to and transfers driving torque to a housing of the differential 164. Differential 164 transfers the driving torque generated by engine 156 to the two drive axles 168 and 170 through two sets of bevel gears rotationally supported in the differential housing. Drive axles 168 and 170 are rotatably fixed to and independently driven by the bevel gears of the differential 164 to supply the driving torque to the vehicle road wheels 172 and 174.<br>
