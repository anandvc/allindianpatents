				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention is related to novel compounds, to a process for their preparation, their use and pharmaceutical compositions comprising the novel compounds. The novel compounds are useful in therapy, and in particular for the treatment of pain.<br>
Background and prior art<br>
The 8 receptor has been identified as having a role in many bodily functions such as circulatory and pain systems. Ligands for the 8 receptor may therefore find potential use as analgesics, and/or as antihypertensive agents. Ligands for the 8 receptor have also been shown to possess immunomodulatory activities.<br>
The identification of at least three different populations of opioid receptors (µ, δ and K) is now well established and all three are apparent in both central and peripheral nervous systems of many species including man. Analgesia has been observed in various animal models when one or more of these receptors has been activated.<br>
With few exceptions, currently available selective opioid δ ligands are peptidic in nature and are unsuitable for administration by systemic routes. Some non-peptidic δ antagonists have been available for some time (see Takemori and Portoghese, 1992, Ann. Rev. Pharmacol. Tox., 32: 239-269. for review). These compounds, e.g. naltrindole, suffer from rather poor (i.e., 
Thus, the problem underlying the present invention was to find new compounds having improved analgesic effects, but also with an improved side-effect profile over current (I agonists and potential oral efficacy.<br>
Analgesics that have been identified and are existing in the prior art have many disadvantages such as that they suffer from poor pharmacokinetics and are not analgesic when administered by systemic routes. Also, it has been documented that preferred compounds, described within the prior art, show significant convulsive effects when administered systemically.<br>

Preparation of N,N-Diethyl-4-[piperidin-4-ylidene(3-trifluoromethyl-phenyl)-methyl1-<br>
benzamide (compound 54. Ar=3-Trifluoromethylphenyl)(general procedure)<br>
The Suzuki coupling of compound 52 with a variety of boronic acids and the subsequent deprotection were performed on a small scale in parallel. The reactions and liquid-liquid extractions were carried out in 25 x 150 mm culture tubes. The protocol for a typical reaction is outlined below.<br>
To a solution of compound 52 (25 mg, 57 µmol) and Tetrakis(triphenyl phosphine) palladium(O) (5 mg, 4.3 µmol) in xylenes (degassed, 0.5 mL) was added 3-Trifluorophenyl boronic acid (28.5 mg, 150 µmol) in ethanol (degassed, 0.5 mL) followed by 150 µL of 2M Na2CO3 (aq) (300 µmol). The reaction was allowed to precede at 80 °C for 1.5 hrs under Ar. The reaction was diluted with water (1 mL) and diethyl ether (1 mL) and vortexed. The organic phase was isolated and evaporated to give a crude product (compound 9, Ar = 3-Trifluoromethylphenyl).<br>
The Boc group was removed by treating the crude product with 1 mL of TFA. After 30 minutes at room temperature the TFA was evaporated to give the crude TFA salt. The salt was neutralized with 1 M NH4OH(l.OM) and extracted into diethyl ether (2 x 1 mL). The ether phase was acidified with 4.0 M HC1 in dioxane (200 µL) and the HC1 salt was extracted into water (2x1 mL). The aqueous salt solution was washed with diethyl ether (2<br><br>
x 1 mL) and lyophilized to yield the product (compound 54, Ar = 3-Trifluoromethylphenyl) as a white powder (10 mg, 39%).<br>

The supernatants from both spins were combined and spun at 46,000 g(max) for 30 min. The pellets were resuspended in cold Tris buffer (50 mM Tris/Cl, pH 7.0) and spun again. The final pellets were resuspended in membrane buffer (50 mM Tris, 0.32 M sucrose, pH 7.0). Aliquots (1 ml) in polypropylene tubes were frozen in dry ice/ethanol and stored at -70°C until use. The protein concentrations were determined by a modified Lowry assay with SDS.<br>
Binding assays<br>
Membranes were thawed at 37°C, cooled on ice, passed 3 times through a 25-gauge needle, and diluted into binding buffer (50 mM Tris, 3 mM MgCl2, 1 mg/ml BSA (Sigma A-7888), pH 7.4, which was stored at 4°C after filtration through a 0.22 m filter, and to which had been freshly added 5 µg/ml aprotinin, 10 uM bestatin, 10 µM diprotin A, no DTT). Aliquots of 100 µl (for µg protein, see Table 1) were added to iced 12x75 mm polypropylene tubes containing 100 ul of the appropriate radioligand (see Table 1) and 100 ul of test peptides at various concentrations. Total (TB) and nonspecific (NS) binding were determined in the absence and presence of 10 µM naloxone respectively. The tubes were vortexed and incubated at 25 °C for 60-75 min, after which time the contents are rapidly vacuum-filtered and washed with about 12 ml/tube iced wash buffer (50 mM Tris, pH 7.0, 3 mM MgCl2) through GF/B filters (Whatman) presoaked for at least 2h in 0.1% polyethyleneimine. The radioactivity (dpm) retained on the filters was measured with a beta counter after soaking the filters for at least 12h in minivials containing 6-7 ml scintillation fluid. If the assay is set up in 96-place deep well plates, the filtration is over 96-place PEI-soaked unifilters, which were washed with 3 x 1 ml wash buffer, and dried in an oven at 55°C for 2h. The filter plates were counted in a TopCount (Packard) after adding 50 ul MS-20 scintillation fluid/well.<br>
Data analysis<br>
The specific binding (SB) was calculated as TB-NS, and the SB in the presence of various test peptides was expressed as percentage of control SB. Values of  IC50 and Hill coefficient (nH) for ligands in displacing specifically bound radioligand were calculated from logit plots or curve fitting programs such as Ligand, GraphPad Prism, SigmaPlot, or ReceptorFit. Values of Kj were calculated from the Cheng-Prussoff equation. Mean ± S.E.M. values of IC50, Kj and nH were reported for ligands tested in at least three displacement curves.<br>
Receptor saturation experiments<br>
Radioligand Kδ values were determined by performing the binding assays on cell<br>
membranes with the appropriate radioligands at concentrations ranging from 0.2 to 5 times the estimated Kδ (up to 10 times if amounts of radioligand required are feasable). The specific radioligand binding was expressed as pmole/mg membrane protein. Values of Kδ and Bmax from individual experiments were obtained from nonlinear fits of specifically bound (B) vs. nM free (F) radioligand from individual according to a one-site model.<br>

FREUND'S COMPLETE ADJUVANT (FCA), AND SCIATIC NERVE CUFF<br>
INDUCED MECHANO-ALLODYNIA IN RAT<br>
Animals<br>
Male Sprague-Dawley rats (Charles River, St-Constant, Canada) weighing 175-200g at the time of surgery were used. They were housed in groups of three in rooms thermostatically maintained at 20° C with a 12:12 hr light/dark cycle, and with free access to food and water. After arrival, the animals were allowed to acclimatize for at least 2 days before surgery. The experiments were approved by the appropriate Medical Ethical Committee for animal studies.<br>
EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE<br>
FREUND'S COMPLETE ADJUVANT<br>
The rats were first anesthetized in a Halothane chamber after which lOµl of FCA was injected s.c. into the dorsal region of the left foot, between the second and third external digits. The animals were then allowed to recover from anesthesia under observation in their home cage.<br>
SCIATIC NERVE CUFF<br>
The animals were prepared according to the method described by Mosconi and Kruger (1996). Rats were anesthetized with a mixture of Ketamine / Xylazine i.p. (2ml/kg) and placed on their right side and an incision made over, and along the axis of, the lateral aspect of the left femur. The muscles of the upper quadriceps were teased apart to reveal the sciatic nerve on which a plastic cuff (PE-60 tubing, 2mm long) was placed around. The wound was then closed in two layers with 3-0 vicryl and silk sutures.<br>
DETERMINATION OF MECHANO-ALLODYNIA USING VON FREY TESTING<br>
Testing was performed between 08:00 and 16:00h using the method described by Chaplan et al. (1994). Rats were placed in Plexiglas cages on top of a wire mesh bottom which allowed access to the paw, and were left to habituate for 10-15 min. The area tested was the mid-plantar left hind paw, avoiding the less sensitive foot pads. The paw was touched with a series of 8 Von Frey hairs with logarithmically incremental stiffness (0.41, 0.69, 1.20, 2.04, 3.63, 5.50, 8.51, and 15.14 grams; Stoelting, El, USA). The von Frey hair was applied from underneath the mesh floor perpendicular to the plantar surface with sufficient force to cause a slight buckling against the paw, and held for approximately 6-8 seconds. A positive response was noted if the paw was sharply withdrawn. Flinching immediately upon removal of the hair was also considered a positive response. Ambulation was considered an ambiguous response, and in such cases the stimulus was repeated.<br>
TESTING PROTOCOL<br>
The animals were tested on postoperative day 1 for the FCA-treated group and on post¬operative day 7 for the Sciatic Nerve Cuff group. The 50% withdrawal threshold was determined using the up-down method of Dixon (1980). Testing was started with the 2.04 g hair, in the middle of the series. Stimuli were always presented in a consecutive way, whether ascending or descending. In the absence of a paw withdrawal response to the initially selected hair, a stronger stimulus was presented; in the event of paw withdrawal, the next weaker stimulus was chosen. Optimal threshold calculation by this method<br>
requires 6 responses in the immediate vicinity of the 50% threshold, and counting of these 6 responses began when the first change in response occurred, e.g. the threshold was first crossed. In cases where thresholds fell outside the range of stimuli, values of 15.14 (normal sensitivity) or 0.41 (maximally allodynic) were respectively assigned. The resulting pattern of positive and negative responses was tabulated using the convention, X = no withdrawal; O = withdrawal, and the 50% withdrawal threshold was interpolated using the formula:<br>
 (Formula Removed) <br>
where Xf = value of the last von Frey hair used (log units); k = tabular value (from Chaplan et al. (1994)) for the pattern of positive / negative responses; and 8 = mean difference between stimuli (log units). Here 6 = 0.224.<br>
Von Frey thresholds were converted to percent of maximum possible effect (% MPE), according to Chaplan et al. 1994. The following equation was used to compute % MPE:<br>
% MPE = Drug treated threshold (g) - allodvnia threshold (g) X 100 Control threshold (g) - allodynia threshold (g)<br>
ADMINISTRATION OF TEST SUBSTANCE<br>
Rats were injected (subcutaneously, intraperitoneally, or orally) with a test substance prior to von Frey testing, the time between administration of test compound and the von Frey test varied depending upon the nature of the test compound.<br>
