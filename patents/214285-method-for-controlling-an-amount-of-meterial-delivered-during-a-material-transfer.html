FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to weighing and delivery systems and more<br>
particularly to an improved method for controlling an amount of material delivered<br>
during a material transfer.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
In many batch weighing/mixing systems, materials are fed into a mix tank in a<br>
sequence and according to amounts determined by a recipe, or formula. The materials are<br>
often fed into the mix tank at varying feed rates. In some systems, the feed rate varies<br>
from less than one pound per second to more than three hundred pounds per second.<br>
Regardless of the feed rates, it is desired to feed the exact amount of material into the<br>
batch in the shortest possible time. This means feeding at maximum feed rates for as long<br>
as possible and then, as the feed amount approaches a target amount, stopping the feed to<br>
achieve the exact desired amount of material without reducing the product feed rate.<br>
During the feeding of the material, the scale reading at any moment is different<br>
from the actual amount of material fed or the final weight that would result if feed were<br>
stopped, or cut off, at that exact moment. The difference between the final batch weight<br>
and scale reading at cutoff is called Spill. For this reason, it is not possible to feed the<br>
material at maximum flow and then stop the feed when the scale reading reaches the<br>
target weight to achieve the exact desired amount of material.<br>
One traditional approach to this problem uses a two-stage feed which switches to<br>
a slow, dribble feed as the scale reading reaches a set percentage (typically 80-90%) of<br>
the target. Variations on this approach use multi-stage feeds or throttling valves, but all<br>
have the effect of lengthening feed time. Accuracy can be improved by lowering the<br>
dribble rate, at the expense of feed time. Agitators in the process cause significant scale<br>
noise, which can only be reduced or eliminated mechanical or electronic filtering,<br>
increasing the tradeoff between accuracy and feed time.<br>
What is needed is a method to quantify and predict what the Spill will be during<br>
the material feed. Furthermore, a method is needed to better control the amount of<br>
material delivered during a material transfer according to a desired amount.<br>

SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method for controlling an amount of material<br>
delivered during a material transfer. This method includes the steps of inputting a target<br>
amount for a material to be delivered from a source location to a target location, updating<br>
the target amount during the delivery of the material using a predictive model-based<br><br>
algorithm., and updating the predictive model-based algorithm based on process<br>
performance data using a recursive least-squares procedure. The present invention also<br>
relates to an adaptive selection algorithm which is used to determine whether at least one<br>
previous predictive model-based algorithm parameter should be replaced with at least<br>
one new predictive model-based algorithm parameter in order to adapt the predictive<br>
model-based algorithm in response to a process change. The present invention also<br>
relates to a method for overlapping a delivery of at least one independently measured<br>
material with a delivery of a main material during a material transfer process.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
FIG. 1 depicts a preferred embodiment of a system 10 in accordance with the<br>
present invention. System 10 is illustrated as having a mix tank 11 and a preweigh tank<br>
12. Any number of mix tanks and/or preweigh tanks may be used. Materials, such as but<br>
not limited to liquids, powders, granules, may be used. These materials may be fed and<br>
measured into either tank 11, 12 through valves, such as valves 13-15. Any type of valve,<br>
such as but not limited a butterfly valve, may be used. The amount of material contained<br>
within either tank 11, 12 may be measured by use of load cells 16. Any type of load cell,<br>
such as but not limited those sold by Mettler Toledo, may be used. System 10 also<br>
incorporates a scale controller 17 which is connected to a programmable logic controller<br>
(PLC) 18. Scale controller transmits material delivery information such as material<br>
weight 19, material feed rate 20 and a cutoff flag 21 to PLC 18. Scale controller 17 and<br>
PLC 18 work together with valve output controller 22 to determine the appropriate time<br>
to close the valves which permit material feed in order to achieve the desired amount of<br>
material to be delivered. While a load cell scale and scale controller are described, one<br>
skilled in the art would appreciate the use of alternate measuring systems and/or<br>
controllers including, but not limited to, preweigh scale systems, flowmeters, weighbelt<br>
feeders and/or combinations thereof. Operator interface 23 allows a technician to access<br>
system 10 in order to create reports or perform other system related functions.<br>
Referring to FIG. 2, a schematic block diagram of control logic for determining<br>
the cut-off point of a material being delivered is illustrated. This control logic may be<br>
incorporated into scale controller 17. The input from load cell 16 may be filtered by filter<br>
30 in order to reduce noise, such as noise caused by agitators within mix tank 11. Using<br>
the filtered input, weight 19 and material feed rate 20 is transmitted to PLC 18, as<br>
illustrated in FIG. 1. A control target amount 33, input from PLC 18, is compared to<br>
weight 19 within decision block 34 in order to determine the cutoff point for closing the<br><br>
material feed valves. Logic parameters are used in block 35 to facilitate the indication of<br>
when to close the valves, although other logic control methods may be employed.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, a flow chart showing a method for controlling an amount of<br>
material delivered during a material transfer is used. Standard flow chart symbols are<br>
used in FIG. 3 and FIG. 4, with rectangular blocks representing execution of a step such<br>
as starting of feeding or reading the weight of a material and the diamond blocks<br>
represent a decision made by system 10 and/or component. A circled letter to the right of<br>
the flow chart represents an exit point which re-enters the chart at the same circled letter<br>
on the left of the flow chart. This method begins at start block 40. The starting scale<br>
weight (SW) is measured in block 42. In block 44, the target weight (TW) is set to equal<br>
the SW + the formula weight (FW), wherein FW is the desired weight of the material to<br>
be delivered. Valve 13 is opened to permit the feeding of the main material in block 46.<br>
The current scale weight is read and then filtered, as depicted in FIG. 2, and set to filter<br>
scale weight (W) in block 48. The flow rate (Q) of the material is calculated as Q = (W -<br>
Wlast) / (t — tlast), wherein t is the duration of time during delivery and Wv and tlast are<br>
similar values for the previous readings. This step is performed in block 50. The<br>
predicted spill (PS) is defined and calculated in block 52 by the following predictive<br>
model PS = K1 * Q + K.2 * Q2, wherein K1 and K2 are parameters of the predictive<br>
model and are independent of the material flow rate, and Q is the measured or calculated<br>
flow rate of the material mentioned above. The predicted final weight (PFW) is defined<br>
and calculated as PFW = W + PS in block 54. In decision block 56, if PFW is less than<br>
TW, then the method exits from the circled letter "A" on the right and re-enters the flow<br>
chart at circled letter "A" on the left, else the method continues through to block 58.<br>
Valve 13, and the like, are closed or shutoff in order to stop the delivery of the material in<br>
block 58. A sufficient period of time (e.g. 1 to 3 seconds) is permitted to pass in order for<br>
the scale to settle in block 60. The final weight (FW) of the material is measured in block<br>
62. A feed error (E) is defined and calculated in block 64 as E = FW - TW. An actual<br>
spill (S) is defined and calculated in block 66 as S = predicted spill at cutoff point (PSC) +<br>
E. In block 68, the predictive model parameters, K1 and K2, are updated with the new<br>
data point (Q, S), wherein Q is equal to the material flow rate at cutoff point and S is the<br>
actual spill. This method ends at end block 70.<br>
Predicted Spill and Predictive Model<br>
The theory of the aforementioned predicted spill formula recognizes the effects of<br>
the following four components (a-d) which contribute to a discrepancy between the scale<br>
reading at any given moment and the final scale weight which would result if the feed<br>
was stopped at that moment - that is, the valve was given a command to close at that<br>
exact moment, termed the "cutoff moment:<br>
a. Material in Suspension - a portion of the material which has passed through the<br>
valve can still be in "free-fall" and has not yet reached the mix.<br>
b. Deceleration Force - Force is required to stop the material which is falling into<br>
the mix. This dynamic force adds to the scale reading until the material flow has<br>
stopped.<br>
c. Scale/Filter Lag - During feed, the scale reading at any moment can "lag" the<br>
actual weight on the scale when filtering is applied to dampen vibration due to<br>
agitators or other process components. Regardless of the type of filtering -<br>
mechanical, electronic or digital - the scale weight discrepancy, or lag, will<br>
increase as the feed flow rate increases. Greater filtering to increase smoothing<br>
also increases the lag.<br>
d. Valve "Let-through" - Valves cannot be closed instantaneously. Some material<br>
passes through the valve whrle it is closing.<br>
This discrepancy between the measured weight reading at the point of cutoff and the final<br>
weight of the material in the mix tank after the process "settles" is called spill, which is<br>
precisely defined as: Spill = final batch weight - scale reading at cutoff. Using this<br>
principle, a practical application was derived into a predictive model of PS = Ki * Q + K2<br>
* Q2 , wherein Q is the measured or calculated flow rate of the material and K1, K2 are<br>
parameters of the predictive model which are independent of material flow rate Q.<br>
Referring to the aforementioned predictive model of PS = K1 * Q + K2 * Q2, when<br>
the initial downward velocity of the material being fed is either equal to zero or<br>
independent of flow rate, then the following values are used:<br>
K1 = Tf + KV-v0/32.2<br>
K2 = 0<br>
where,<br>
Tf is a filter composite time constant,<br>
Ky is a valve let-through factor equal to ?0tc f[xv(t)] dt, and<br>
v0 is the initial downward velocity of the material<br><br>
When the initial downward velocity of the material is proportional to flow rate, then the<br>
following values are used:<br>
K1 = Tf+Ky,<br>
Tf is a filter composite time constant,<br>
KV is a valve let-through factor equal to ?0tc f[xv(t)] dt,<br>
and<br>
K2 = - 1 / (32.2 * p * AV),<br>
p is a density of the material, and<br>
Ay is a cross-sectional area of a valve or other conduit through<br>
which the material moves from the source location to the target<br>
location.<br>
Referring to FIG. 4, a flow chart showing a method for controlling the amounts<br>
and timing of multiple material feeds using an overlapping feed technique is used. This<br>
method begins at start block 80. The starting scale weight (SW) is measured in block 42.<br>
In block 84, the target weight (TW) is set to equal the SW + the formula weight (FW),<br>
wherein FW is the desired weight of the material to be delivered. The weight of each<br>
overlapping preweigh feed or dump is added to TW in block 86. Delay time, Tdt ,is<br>
calculated in block 88 for the delaying of the feeding of the main material, also referred to<br>
as main feed start. All overlapping preweigh feeds or dump are started in block 90.<br>
Delay time, Tdt, is waited upon to expire in block 92 before the starting of the main<br>
material feed in block 94. In block 96, this method waits for all the overlapping preweigh<br>
feeds or dumps to complete. Target weight (TW) is adjusted by any weight errors in<br>
overlapping prewigh dumps or feeds. The method then progresses into block 98 where<br>
then the current scale weight is measured, filtered, and set to value (W). In block 100, the<br>
flow rate (Q) of the material is calculated as Q = (W — Wlast) / (t — tlast), wherein t is the<br>
duration of time during delivery and Wlast and tlast are similar values for the previous<br>
readings. The predicted spill (PS) is defined and calculated in block 102 by the<br>
following predictive model PS = K1 * Q + K2 * Q2, wherein K1 and K2 are parameters<br>
of the predictive model and are independent of the material flow rate, and Q is the<br>
measured or calculated flow rate of the material mentioned above. The predicted final<br>
weight (PFW) is defined and calculated as PFW = W + PS in block 104. In decision<br>
block 106, if PFW is less than TW, then the method exits from the circled letter "B" on<br>
the right and re-enters the flow chart at circled letter "B" on the left, else the method<br>
continues through to block 108. Valve 13, and the like, are closed or shutoff in order to<br>
stop the delivery of the material in block 108. A sufficient period of time (e.g. 1 to 3<br>
seconds) is permitted to pass in order for the scale to settle in block 110. The final weight<br>
(FW) of the material is measured in block 112. A feed error (E) is defined and calculated<br>
in block 114 as E = FW - TW. An actual spill (S) is defined and calculated in block 116<br>
as S = predicted spill at cutoff point (PSC) + E. In block 118, the predictive model<br>
parameters, K1 and K.2, are updated with the new data point (Q, S), wherein Q is equal to<br>
the material flow rate at cutoff point and S is the actual spill. This method ends at end<br>
block 120.<br>
Adaptive Updating of the Predictive Model<br>
The predictive model parameters K1 and K2 are independent of flowrate Q but<br>
can change slowly due to process or material characteristic changes, such as makeup in<br>
valves or other process phenomena. After each feed of the material, the following routine<br>
and strategy is used to determine whether a new point (e.g. cutoff flow, actual spill) is<br>
valid for updating the predictive model. Referring to FIG. 5, a coordinate system 130 is<br>
defined to display values of a dependent variable versus values of at least one<br>
independent variable. The dependent variable is related to the independent variable by a<br>
mathematical function which is defined by a predictive model, as previously discussed.<br>
Next, a closed reference box 132 is defined on coordinate system 130. Closed reference<br>
box 132 has a fixed center point 140 located at values of the dependent and independent<br>
variables based on predetermined acceptable material delivery data values, wherein the<br>
dimensions of the closed reference box are initially set based on predetermined<br>
acceptable material delivery data values. These dimensions and center point 140 are<br>
subject to a rule-based adjustment using process performance data. Next, a finite number<br>
of successively smaller closed selection boxes 134, 136 (two boxes are used for the<br>
example in FIG. 5, however, any number of boxes may be used) are defined on<br>
coordinate system 130. Closed selection boxes 134, 136 each have a center point 138<br>
located at values of the dependent and independent variables based on current averaged<br>
values of the dependent and independent variables as calculated from process<br>
performance data. The dimensions of closed selection boxes 134, 136 are defined by<br><br>
successively smaller fractional multiples of the closed reference box dimensions. Next, at<br>
least one decision rule is defined by which a specific new data point (as exampled 141,<br>
142, 143, and 144 in FIG. 5) having values of the dependent and independent variables<br>
derived from process performance data can be used to select a specific rule by which the<br>
predictive model will be modified. The selection depends on which of the boxes 132,<br>
134, 136 contain the data point. If the new data point 141 is contained within both of the<br>
smallest of the selection boxes 136 and closed reference box 132, then at least one<br>
predictive model parameter is updated. Else if the new data point 142 is contained within<br>
both the larger of the selection boxes 134 and closed reference box 132 but not within the<br>
smaller selection box 136, then at least one predictive model parameter is reset. Else if<br>
the new data point 143 is contained within closed reference box 132 but not within either<br>
of said selection boxes 134, 136, then on first occurrence within this region no change is<br>
made to any predictive model parameter. Else if the new data point 144 is outside closed<br>
reference box 132, then make no change to any predictive model parameter.<br>
This routine or method is self-starting in that initial values of the predictive<br>
model-based algorithm parameters are automatically set from data, of a first material<br>
delivery. Furthermore, this routine or method is self-correcting in that the predictive<br>
model-based algorithm parameters are reset when changed process or material<br>
characteristics meeting specified criteria are detected.<br>
Update and Reset Equations<br>
Separate predictive model parameters K1 and K2 are used and maintained for<br>
each different material in the batch sequence. The predictive model parameters K1 and<br>
K2 are updated or reset after each feed of the material according to the selection<br>
procedure described above. The equations used to perform this update or reset are<br>
derived using a conventional mathematical approach called "recursive least squares",<br>
which, for a sequence of data points, minimizes the sum of the square of the deviation<br>
between the actual data point and the estimate of the point provided by the predictive<br>
model. Each data point consists of cutoff flow Q as the independent variable and actual<br>
spill S as the dependent variable. After the material feed is completed, the new data point<br>
(Q, S) is used in the following equations to update or reset the predictive model<br>
parameters K1 and K2 and additional parameters, defined below, which are used in the<br>
predictive model.<br><br>
Let (Q i, S i ), where Q , = Cutoff Flow and S i = Actual Spill, represent the new data<br>
point.<br>
Call an initial data point (i.e., from the first feed of the material), or one that is to be used<br>
to reset the predictive model, (Q 0, S 0 ).<br>
Define five additional parameters needed for the model as follows:<br><br>
In the above equations, ß is a weighting factor having a value between 0 and 1.<br>
Smaller values of p provide more weighting to previous data points. A value of ß=0.17,<br>
which weights the 25th most recent data point by 0.01 and the 50th most recent point by<br>
0.0001, has been used effectively in several applications of this method.<br>
Overlawine Feed Technique<br>
There is a multitude of process designs for batch manufacturing systems, all<br>
having their own unique benefits. One of the simplest systems consists of a multiple tank<br>
architecture. The tanks are sized to deliver materials at the necessary accuracy. This also<br>
allows parallel operations to increase throughput. These tanks are mounted on Load-Cell<br>
weighing devices and material movement is controlled by monitoring the change in<br>
weight. In general, this mandates only a single material movement at a time in any one<br>
tank.<br>
Referring to FIG. 6, this example process configuration 160 of a batch<br>
weighing/mixing has two preweigh tanks 162, 164 that support a main tank 166 in which<br>
a final product is made. This configuration allows intermediate materials to be processed<br>
in the upper tiered preweigh tanks 162, 164 and delivered to the lower tiered main tank<br>
166 when required. While FIG. 6 depicts a system having two preweigh tanks, one<br>
skilled in the art would appreciate the use of alternate measuring systems and/or<br>
controllers including, but not limited to, flowmeters, weighbelt feeders and/or<br>
combinations thereof.<br>
Traditional Operations:<br>
During the manufacturing of a product, each tank goes through its recipe cycle and<br>
interacts with the other tanks as shown in the traditional activity diagram in FIG. 7. In<br>
this example, the materials A, B &amp; C are delivered to the preweigh tanks in parallel with<br>
the activities that are occurring in the main tank. When the main tank is ready to receive<br>
the pre-weighed intermediate materials, they are transferred to the main tank, with all<br>
other activity in the main tank suspended. This approach to batch manufacturing delivers<br>
quality product at an effective rate. As the need for additional product increases, however,<br>
adding additional manufacturing systems or increasing the number of manufacturing<br>
hours through overtime or more shifts are typical options.<br>
Overlapping Preweigh Dumps and Material Feeds:<br>
To reduce the batch cycle time, and thereby increase production, the present<br>
invention delivers a material using a load cell system at the same time that an<br>
intermediate material is transferred from a preweigh. This approach significantly<br>
increases the production of an existing process without making physical modifications.<br>
The decrease in cycle time is dependent upon several factors, each system must be<br>
evaluated to determine it"s potential. As shown in the overlapping feed activity diagram<br>
in FIG. 8, the preweigh dumps are coordinated with a material feed so that both are being<br>
added to the main tank at the same time. For this to work and still accurately deliver the<br>
main material, the preweigh finishes its delivery before the material finishes its feed.<br>
This overlapping feed technique works by maintaining information on the<br>
performance of most aspects of the process. This information, including material flow<br>
rates, tank sizes and drain times, is constantly being updated as the process is used. The<br>
information is then used to make the predictions necessary to perform the overlap feed as<br>
described in the timing diagram of FIG. 9. Referring to FIG. 9, the following definitions<br>
are provided:<br>
Tdb This is a "Dead-Band" time that the preweighs may intrude into without<br>
causing a problem with the material feed. This time is configurable by<br>
an engineer and is generally set to 5 seconds.<br>
Tdt This is the calculated time that the main material will be delayed while<br>
the preweigh feeds so that the required (Tma + Tdb ) is met.<br>
Tma This is the time that the material feed must feed alone, without any<br>
preweigh material coming into the main tank. If any preweigh feed will<br>
interfere with this feed alone time the material feed will be suspended.<br><br>
This time is configurable by an engineer and is generally set to 15<br>
seconds.<br>
mf This is the time that the material feed into the main tank is expected to<br>
take.<br>
Tovl This is the overlap time that the preweigh and material will both be<br>
feeding into the main tank.<br>
TpWl This is the greatest time that any selected preweigh(s) are expected to<br>
take to deliver the contents to the main tank.<br>
Additional descriptions:<br>
Mact This is the actual flow rate at which the material is being delivered to the<br>
receiving tank. This is live data and is updated every second.<br>
Mavg This is the materials average feed rate. This is updated at the end of<br>
every usage of that material.<br>
Metc. This is the number of seconds that the material is expected to take to<br>
finish its delivery. When the transfer is in progress, this is developed<br>
using live process data.<br>
MSp This is the amount of material that is to be added during the overlap<br>
operation.<br>
PWact This is the actual flow rate at which the preweigh is delivering its<br>
material to the receiving tank. This is live data and is updated every<br>
second.<br>
PWavg This is the historical average flow rate at which a preweigh will deliver<br>
its material to the receiving tank. This is updated at the end of every<br>
preweigh transfer.<br><br>
PWetc This is the number of seconds that the preweigh is expected to take to<br>
deliver its material. When the transfer is in progress, this is developed<br>
using live process data.<br>
PWma This is the mass that the preweigh is expecting to deliver to the receiving<br>
tank. It is determined at the time the receiving tank requests the<br>
preweigh to deliver its material.<br>
During the overlap feed there are many process checks made to reduce the possibility of<br>
any process upset. Following are the steps and the sequence in which they occur when<br>
performing an overlap feed:<br>
1. The system waits until all requested preweighs have finished all activity and are<br>
ready to transfer their material to the main tank.<br>
2. The preweighs are evaluated to determine which will have the greatest, Tpwl , by<br>
the formula: PWma / PWavg<br>
3. The material feed time is calculated by the formula: mf= sp / avg<br>
4 The total amount of material expected in the main tank is determined by combining<br>
all the expected preweighs" amounts, ma , and the material feeds setpoint, sp ,<br>
for a total.<br>
T<br>
5. The time to delay the start of the material feed is calculated using the greatest, Tpwl<br>
, as: dt ~ ( Tpwl - Tmf +Tdb +Tma ) with dt never being less than zero.<br>
6. All requested preweighs are instructed to begin their transfer.<br>
7. When all preweighs have started their transfer and the, Tdt, has been satisfied, the<br>
material feed is started.<br>
8. The feed alone time, Tma , is monitored to make sure that no preweigh"s transfer<br>
will violate the materials, Tma, using the following method:<br>
Tma&gt;Metc.-PWetc.<br>
Based on the results of this comparison one of two things will happen.<br>
a. If the feed alone time is not violated, the preweighs will finish transferring.<br>
The material will finish its feed and at the end of which all system data,<br>
including but not limited to information from the independently measured<br>
feeds, will be updated to reflect the current operation of the process.<br>
b. If the feed alone time is violated then the following occurs:<br><br>
1. The feed is stopped.<br>
2. The preweighs finish their transfer and update their process data.<br>
3. The underweight of the material feed is determined and the operator is<br>
informed of the shortfall so that corrective action can be taken.<br>
4. The next usage of the material in an overlap feed is inhibited so that<br>
accurate system data can be collected.<br>
5. Normal overlap activity resumes after accurate data is collected.<br>
The present invention may be implemented, for example, by operating a computer<br>
system to execute a sequence of machine-readable instructions. These instructions may<br>
reside in various types of signal bearing media, such hard disk drive and main memory.<br>
In this respect, another aspect of the present invention concerns a program product,<br>
comprising signal bearing media embodying a program of machine-readable instructions,<br>
executable by a digital data processor, such as a central processing unit (CPU), to perform<br>
method steps. The machine-readable instructions may comprise any one of a number of<br>
programming languages known in the art (e.g., Visual Basic, C, C++, etc.).<br>
It should be understood that the present invention may be implemented on any<br>
type of computer system. One acceptable type of computer system comprises a main or<br>
central processing unit (CPU) which is connected to a main memory (e.g., random access<br>
memory (RAM)), a display adapter, an auxiliary storage adapter, and a network adapter.<br>
These system components may be interconnected through the use of a system bus.<br>
The CPU may be, for example, a Pentium Processor made by Intel Corporation.<br>
However, it should be understood that the present invention is not limited to any one<br>
make of processor and the invention may be practiced using some other type of a<br>
processor such as a co-processor or an auxiliary processor. An auxiliary storage adapter<br>
may be used to connect mass storage devices (such as a hard disk drive) to a computer<br>
system. The program need not necessarily all simultaneously reside on the computer<br>
system. Indeed, this latter scenario would likely be the case if computer system were a<br>
network computer, and therefore, be dependent upon an on-demand shipping mechanism<br>
for access to mechanisms or portions of mechanisms that resided on a server. A display<br>
adapter may be used to directly connect a display device to the computer system. A<br>
network adapter may be used to connect the computer system to other computer systems.<br>
It is important to note that while the present invention has been described in the<br>
context of a fully functional computer system, those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
the mechanisms of the present invention are capable of being distributed as a program<br><br>
product in a variety of forms, and that the present invention applies equally regardless of<br>
the particular type of signal bearing media used to actually carry out the distribution.<br>
Examples of signal bearing media include: recordable type media, such as floppy disks,<br>
hard disk drives, and CD ROMs and transmission type media, such as digital and analog<br>
communications links and wireless.<br>
While particular embodiments of the present invention have been illustrated and<br>
described, it will be obvious to those skilled in the art that various changes and<br>
modifications may be made without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention,<br>
and it is intended to cover in the appended claims all such modifications that are within<br>
the scope of the invention.<br>
