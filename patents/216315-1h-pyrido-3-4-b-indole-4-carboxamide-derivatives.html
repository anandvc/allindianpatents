				<td>The subject of the present invention is<br>
1H-pyrido[3,4-b]indole-4-carboxamide derivatives, their<br>
preparation and their application in therapeutics.<br>
The compounds of the invention correspond to<br>
the general formula (I)<br>
in which<br>
X represents a hydrogen or halogen atom or a<br>
(C1-C3) alkyl, (C1-C3) alkoxy, trifluoromethyl or<br>
phenylmethoxy group,<br>
R1 represents a hydrogen atom or a (C1-C3) alkyl,<br>
cyclopropyl or phenylmethyl group,<br>
R2 represents either a (C1-C3) alkyl group optionally<br>
substituted by a methoxy group, or a phenyl(C1-C3)alkyl<br>
group optionally substituted on the phenyl ring by a<br>
halogen atom or a methyl or methoxy group, or a<br>
cyclohexylmethyl group, or a thienylmethyl group, or a<br>
pyridinylmethyl group, or a phenyl group optionally<br>
substituted by one or more halogen atoms or a<br>
(C1-C3)alkyl or (C1-C3) alkoxy group, or a pyridinyl<br>
group, or a 5-methyl-l,2-oxazolyl group, or a 5-methyl-<br>
1,3,4-thiadiazolyl group, or a naphthyl group,<br>
R3 and R4, independently of one another, each represent<br>
a hydrogen atom, a (C1-C3)alkyl group, a 2-methoxyethyl<br>
group, a hydroxy (C2-C4) alkyl group, a carboxy-<br>
(C1-C3)alkyl group, a (C1-C3) alkoxycarbonyl (C1-C3) alkyl<br>
group or a phenyl (C1-C3) alkyl group, or else together<br>
form, with the nitrogen atom which carries them, either<br>
a pyrrolidinyl group optionally substituted by a<br>
hydroxyl, ethoxy, methoxycarbonyl or methoxymethyl<br>
group, or a piperidinyl group, or a morpholinyl group,<br>
or a 4-methylpiperazinyl group, or an azetidinyl group,<br>
or a thiazolidinyl group, and<br>
the bond between the carbon atoms in the 3 and 4<br>
positions is single or double.<br>
Depending on the nature of this bond, a<br>
compound according to the invention can optionally<br>
exist in the form of a pure optical isomer or of a<br>
mixture of such isoxners.<br>
The preferred compounds are those in the<br>
general formula of which X is in the 6 position and<br>
represents a fluorine atom, R1 represents a methyl<br>
group, R2 represents a phenyl group, R3 represents a<br>
methyl group and R4 represents an ethyl group or else R3<br>
and R4 form, with the nitrogen atom which carries them,<br>
a pyrrolidinyl ring.<br>
The compounds of general formula (I) can be<br>
prepared by processes illustrated in the following<br>
schemes.<br>
According to Scheme 1, the starting compound<br>
corresponds to the general formula (II), in which X is<br>
as defined above and R1 is as defined above; when R1<br>
represents hydrogen, it is possible, if desired, to<br>
carry out an alkylation in order to produce a compound<br>
of general formula (II) in which R1 represents a<br>
(C1-C3)alkyl group. The compound of general formula (II)<br>
is thus reacted with ethyl pyruvate of formula (III),<br>
in acidic medium, for example in the presence of<br>
gaseous hydrochloric acid in ethanol or in the presence<br>
of sulphuric acid or of boron trifluoride etherate in<br>
acetic acid, between room temperature and the reflux<br>
temperature, in order to obtain the diester of general<br>
formula (IV).<br>
The latter is then treated in ethanol at the reflux<br>
temperature with an amine of general formula R2NH2, in<br>
which R2 is as defined above. An ester of general<br>
formula (V) is obtained, which is converted to the<br>
corresponding acid, of general formula (VI), by<br>
hydrolysis in basic medium.<br>
This acid is then converted to the primary, secondary<br>
or tertiary amide of general formula (I") by reaction<br>
with an amine of general formula HNR3R4, in which R3 and<br>
R4 are as defined above, either through the imidazolide<br>
obtained by reaction with N,N"-carbonyldiimidazole or<br>
through the acid chloride.<br>
In the compound of general formula (I") thus obtained,<br>
the bond between the 3 and 4 positions is a single<br>
bond. If it is desired to prepare a compound in which<br>
this bond is a double bond, a compound of general<br>
formula (I") is oxidized by means of 2,3-dichloro-<br>
5,6-dicyanocyclohexa-2,5-diene-l,4-dione or of<br>
3,4,5,6-tetrachlorocyclohexa-3,5-diene-l,2-dione, in a<br>
solvent such as toluene or dichloromethane, between<br>
room temperature and the reflux temperature, in order<br>
to obtain the corresponding compound, in the structure<br>
of which the bond between the carbon atoms in the 3 and<br>
4 positions is double, which respectively has the<br>
general formula (I""):<br>
Finally, and if it takes place, the enantiomers can be<br>
prepared from the racemates according to any known<br>
method; thus, for example, an acid of general formula<br>
(VI) can be reacted with an optically pure chiral<br>
amine, such as a-methylbenzylamine, and the<br>
diastereoisomers can be separated by fractional<br>
crystallization in order to arrive at an optically pure<br>
acid and then at the esters and amides which derive<br>
therefrom.<br>
In the case of an optically pure acid of<br>
general formula (VI), the non-racemizing coupling<br>
reaction can be carried out by any known method, for<br>
example with use of (benzotriazol-1-yloxy)tris-<br>
(pyrrolidin-1-yl)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate.<br>
In the case where R2 is an aromatic ring, it<br>
is possible, if desired, to convert the diester (IV) to<br>
the amide (VII) by heating the reaction mixture at a<br>
temperature of 100 to 200°C, in an inert solvent or<br>
without solvent, for example at reflux of the<br>
corresponding amine of general formula R2NH2. It is then<br>
possible to convert the compound of general formula<br>
(VII) either to the ester of general formula (V), in<br>
refluxing ethanol, in acidic medium, for example in the<br>
presence of concentrated hydrochloric acid, or to the<br>
acid of general formula (VI), by hydrolysis in basic<br>
medium.<br>
The starting compounds of general formula<br>
(II) , mainly with R1=H, are described in the literature;<br>
the pyruvate of formula (III) is commercially<br>
available.<br>
According to Scheme 2, the starting compound<br>
corresponds to the general formula (VIII), in which X<br>
is as defined above. This compound is reacted with<br>
2-ketoglutaric acid and is then treated in an acidic<br>
alcoholic medium, for example in ethanol saturated with<br>
gaseous hydrochloric acid, at the reflux temperature,<br>
in order to obtain the diester of general formula (IX),<br>
in which R represents a (C1-C3)alkyl group. If desired,<br>
an alkylation reaction of this compound is then carried<br>
out, in order to obtain the compound of general formula<br>
(X), in which R1 represents a (C1-C3)alkyl group, and<br>
then the latter is converted, in a protic solvent, for<br>
example N,N-dimethylformamide, in the presence of<br>
dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal, at the reflux<br>
temperature, in order to obtain the compound of formula<br>
(XI). If desired, the compound of general formula (IX)<br>
can be directly converted to the compound of general<br>
formula (XI), in which R1 represents a methyl group,<br>
under the conditions described above.<br>
The compound of general formula (XI) is then treated<br>
with an amine of general formula H2NR2, in which R2 is<br>
as defined above, in a protic solvent, for example<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide, optionally in the presence of an<br>
acid, for example 4-methylbenzenesulphonic acid, at the<br>
reflux temperature, in order to obtain the ester of<br>
general formula (V"). The latter is converted to the<br>
corresponding acid of general formula (VI") by<br>
hydrolysis in basic medium.<br>
Finally, this acid is converted to the primary,<br>
secondary or tertiary amide of general formula (I""),<br>
either through the imidazolide obtained by reaction<br>
with N,N"-carbonyldiimidazole or through the acid<br>
chloride.<br>
The starting compounds of general formula<br>
(VIII) are commercially available. Some compounds of<br>
general formulae (IX) and (X) are described in the<br>
literature<br>
According to Scheme 3, the starting material<br>
is the diester of general formula (X), described with<br>
respect to the process of Scheme 2. This diester is<br>
hydrolysed in acidic medium in order to obtain the<br>
diacid of general formula (XII), which is converted to<br>
the anhydride, for example by using acetyl chloride at<br>
the reflux temperature, in order to obtain the compound<br>
of general formula (XIII). The latter is converted, by<br>
reaction with an, amine of general formula HNR3R4, in<br>
which R3 and R4 are as defined above, in a chlorinated<br>
solvent, for example dichloromethane, in order to<br>
obtain the compound of general formula (XIV), which is<br>
converted to the ester of general formula (XV), the<br>
latter is then treated in a protic solvent, for example<br>
N/N-dimethylformamide, in the presence of<br>
dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal, at the reflux<br>
temperature, in order to obtain the compound of general<br>
formula (XVI), and, finally, the latter is reacted with<br>
an amine of general formula R2NH2, in which R2 is as<br>
defined above, in a protic solvent, for example<br>
N,N-dimethylformamide, optionally in, the presence of an<br>
acid, for example 4-methylbenzenesulphonic acid, at the<br>
reflux temperature, in order to obtain the compound of<br>
general formula (I"").<br>
Finally, if desired, a secondary amide of general<br>
formula (I""), in which R3 or R4 represents hydrogen,<br>
can be converted to the tertiary amide by an alkylation<br>
reaction known to a person skilled in the art, by means<br>
of an alkylating agent, for example an alkyl halide.<br>
Likewise, a compound of general formula (I") or (I""),<br>
in which R1 represents a hydrogen atom, can be converted<br>
to a compound, in the formula of which R1 represents an<br>
alkyl group, by an alkylation reaction of known type.<br>
Compounds with chemical structures analogous to that of<br>
the compounds of the invention are described in CA<br>
83(13) 114712c, CA 94(9) 64698g and CA 96(9) 68779y.<br>
Some cpmpounds of general formulae (XII),<br>
(XIII), (XIV) and (XV) are described in the literature.<br>
A compound of general formula (I) in which R3 and/or R4<br>
represent a hydroxy (C2-C4)alkyl group can be obtained by<br>
reaction of the corresponding acid of general formula<br>
(VI) or (VI") with an alcohol protected by a<br>
conventional protective group, followed by<br>
deprotection.<br>
A compound of general formula (I) in which R3 and/or R4<br>
represent a carboxy(C2-C4)alkyl group can be obtained by<br>
hydrolysis of a corresponding ester. A compound of<br>
general formula (I) in which X represents a<br>
phenylmethoxy group can be obtained in two stages,<br>
known to a person skilled in the art, from a compound<br>
of general formula (I) in which X represents a methoxy<br>
group.<br>

NMR spectra confirm the structures of the compounds<br>

Study of membrane binding with respect to ?1 (type 1<br>
benzodiazepine) and ?2 (type 2 benzodiazepine)<br>
receptors.<br>
The affinity of the compounds for the ?1<br>
receptors of the cerebellum and ?2 receptors of the<br>
spinal cord was determined according to a variant of<br>
the method described by S.Z. Langer and S. Arbilla in<br>
Fund. Clin. Pharmacol., 2, 159-170 (1988), with the use<br>
of [3H] f lumazenil instead of [3H] diazepam as<br>
radioligand.<br>
The cerebellar or spinal cord tissue is homogenized for<br>
60 s in 120 or 30 volumes, respectively, of ice-cold<br>
buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl, pH 7.4, 120 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl)<br>
and then, after dilution to 1/3, the suspension is<br>
incubated with [3H]flumazenil (specific activity<br>
7 8 Ci/mmol, New England Nuclear) at a concentration of<br>
1 nM and with the compounds of the invention at<br>
different concentrations, in a final volume of 525 µl.<br>
After 30 minutes of incubation at 0°C, the samples are<br>
filtered under reduced pressure on Whatman GF/B®<br>
filters and washed immediately with ice-cold buffer.<br>
The specific binding of [3H]flumazenil is determined in<br>
the presence of 1 µM unlabelled diazepam. The data are<br>
analysed according to standard methods and the IC50<br>
concentration, the concentration which inhibits by 50%<br>
the binding of [3H]flumazenil, is calculated.<br>
The IC50 values of the most active compounds of the<br>
invention lie, in this test, between 10 and 1000 nM.<br>
Study of the anxiolytic activity: drink intake conflict<br>
test.<br>
The anxiolytic activity is evaluated in rats<br>
in the drink intake conflict test according to the<br>
method described by J.R. Vogel, B. Beer and D.E. Clody<br>
in Psychopharmacologia (Berl.), 21, 1-7 (1971).<br>
After being deprived of water for 48 h, the rat is<br>
placed in a soundproof chamber equipped with a water<br>
pipette connected to an anxiometer which delivers a<br>
mild electric shock every 2 0 licks. The number of<br>
shocks received is automatically counted over 3 minutes<br>
and makes it possible to evaluate the anxiolytic<br>
activity of the tested compounds. The results are<br>
expressed by the minimum effective dose (MED), the dose<br>
which produces a significant increase in the number of<br>
shocks received, with respect to the number observed in<br>
the control animals.<br>
The MED values of the most active compounds lie, in<br>
this test, between 5 and 50 mg/kg via the<br>
intraperitoneal route.<br>
Study of the anxiolytic activity: test in a heightened<br>
cross-shaped maze<br>
The protocol of this test is a modification<br>
of that described by S. Pellow and S. File in<br>
Pharmacol. Biochem. Behav. (1986), 24, 525-529.<br>
After a period of accustomization to the experimental<br>
room lasting approximately 24 h, the rats are placed<br>
individually on the central platform, the muzzle<br>
directed towards one of the closed arms, and observed<br>
for 4 min using a video camera. The time spent by the<br>
animal in the open arms, the number of entries into the<br>
closed arms and into the open arms, the number of<br>
attempts to enter the open arms, followed by an<br>
avoidance response, and the exploration of the edges in<br>
the open arms are recorded. The results are expressed<br>
for each animal: 1) as percentage of passages into the<br>
open arms relative to the total number of entries into<br>
the four arms of the apparatus, 2) as percentage of<br>
time spent in the open arms relative to the total<br>
duration of the test (4 min), 3) as total number of<br>
abortive attempts made by the animal, 4) as total<br>
number of explorations.<br>
The products under study are administered<br>
intraperitoneally or orally at increasing doses.<br>
The results are expressed by the minimum effective dose<br>
(MED) which produces either a significant increase<br>
(activity in the open arms) or a significant decrease<br>
(attempts) relative to the performance observed in the<br>
control animals.<br>
The MED values of the most active compounds lie, in<br>
this test, between 3 and 50 mg/kg via the<br>
intraperitoneal or oral route.<br>
Study of the hypnotic activity.<br>
The sedative or hypnotic activity of the<br>
compounds was determined by observing their action on<br>
the rat"s electrocorticogram, according to the method<br>
described by H. Depoortere, Rev. E.E.G. Neurophysiol.,<br>
10, 3, 207-214 (1980) and by H. Depoortere and<br>
M. Decobert, J. Pharmacol., (Paris), 14, 2, 195-265<br>
(1983) .<br>
The products under study were administered<br>
intraperitoneally at increasing doses. They induce<br>
sleep patterns at doses ranging from 1 to 30 mg/kg.<br>
Study of the anticonvulsant activity; activity with<br>
respect to clonic convulsions induced in rats by<br>
injection of pentetrazol.<br>
The protocol of this test is a modification<br>
of that described by E.A. Swinyard and J.H. Woodhead in<br>
Antiepileptic Drugs, Raven Press, New York, 111-126<br>
(1982) .<br>
The test products are administered to the animals<br>
intraperitoneally 3 0 min before an intravenous<br>
injection of 20 mg/kg of pentetrazol. Immediately after<br>
the injection, the number of animals exhibiting clonic<br>
convulsions is noted over 5 min.<br>
The results are expressed as the AD50, the dose which<br>
protects 50% of the animals, calculated according to<br>
the method of J.T. Lichtfield and F. Wilcoxon<br>
(J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. (1949), 96, 99-113) on the basis<br>
of 3 or 4 doses each administered to a group of 8 to 10<br>
rats.<br>
The AD50 values of the most active compounds lie between<br>
0.3 and 30 mg/kg via the intraperitoneal or oral route.<br>
Study of the anticonvulsant activity; activity with<br>
respect to isoniazid-induced convulsions in mice.<br>
The intrinsic activity of the compounds is<br>
determined by the latency time of onset of convulsions<br>
induced by the subcutaneous administration of isoniazid<br>
(800 mg/kg) simultaneously with the test compound<br>
injected intraperitoneally, according to the protocol<br>
described by G. Perrault, E. Morel, D. Sanger and<br>
B. Zivkovic in Eur. J. Pharmacol., 156, 189-196 (1988).<br>
The results are expressed as the AD50, the dose which<br>
produces 50% of the maximum effect, relative to the<br>
control animals, determined on the basis of 3 or 4<br>
doses each administered to a group of 8 to 10 mice.<br>
The AD50 values of the compounds of the invention lie,<br>
in this test, between 1 and 50 mg/kg via the<br>
intraperitoneal route and, depending on the compounds,<br>
the maximum effect can be as much as 300%.<br>
The results of the tests performed on the<br>
compounds of the invention show that, in vitro, they<br>
displace [3H]flumazenil from its specific binding sites<br>
in the cerebellum and the spinal cord; they exhibit a<br>
mixed affinity for the ?1 and ?2 (type 1 and type 2<br>
benzodiazepine) sites situated in the GABAA - ? sites<br>
chlorine channel macromolecular complex.<br>
In vivo, they behave as full or partial agonists with<br>
respect to these receptors.<br>
They possess anxiolytic, hypnotic and anticonvulsant<br>
properties, and can consequently be used for the<br>
treatment of complaints associated with disorders of<br>
GABAergic transmission, such as anxiety, sleep<br>
disorders, epilepsy, spasticity, muscle contractures,<br>
cognitive disorders, withdrawal disorders related to<br>
alcoholism, tobacco or drugs, and the like.<br>
They can also be used for the treatment of Parkinson"s<br>
disease and all types of extrapyramidal syndromes.<br>
Finally, they can be used in premedication and as<br>
general anaesthetics for the induction and/or<br>
maintenance of anaesthesia, or as local anaesthetics,<br>
optionally in combination with other anaesthetics<br>
and/or muscle relaxants and/or analgesics.<br>
To this end, they may be presented in any<br>
pharmaceutical dosage form, in combination with<br>
suitable excipients, for enteral or parenteral<br>
administration, for example in the form of tablets,<br>
dragees, capsules including hard gelatin capsules,<br>
solutions or suspensions to be swallowed or injected,<br>
suppositories, and the like, containing a dose to<br>
permit a daily administration of 1 to 1000 mg of active<br>
substance.<br><br>

2-ketoglutaric acid, it is then treated in an acidic<br>
alcoholic medium, in order to obtain the diester of<br>
general formula (IX)<br>
in which R represents a (C1-C3) alkyl group, then, if<br>
desired, an alkylation reaction is carried out, in<br>
order to obtain the compound of general formula (X)<br>
in which R1 represents a (C1-C3)alkyl group, then the<br>
latter is converted in the presence of<br>
dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal, in order to obtain<br>
the compound of general formula (XI)<br>
or alternatively, if desired, the compound of general<br>
formula (IX) is directly converted to the compound of<br>
general formula (XI), in which R1 represents a methyl<br>
group, the latter is then treated with an amine of<br>
general formula H2NR2, in which R2 is as defined in<br>
Claim 1, in order to obtain the ester of general<br>
formula (V")<br>
the latter is then converted to the corresponding acid<br>
of general formula (VI")<br>
and, finally, this acid is converted to the primary,<br>
secondary or tertiary amide of general formula (I"")<br>
by reaction with an amine of general formula HNR3R4, in<br>
which R3 and R4 are as defined in Claim 1, either<br>
through the imidazolide obtained by reaction with N,N"-<br>
carbonyldimidazole or through the acid chloride.<br>
11. Process for the preparation of a compound as<br>
claimed in Claim 1, wherein a diester of general<br>
formula (X)<br>
in which X and R1 are as described in Claim 1 and R<br>
represents a (C1-C3)alkyl group, is hydrolysed, in order<br>
to obtain the diacid of general formula (XII)<br>
which is converted to the anhydride, in order to obtain<br>
the compound of general formula (XIII)<br>
the latter is then converted by reaction with an amine<br>
of general formula HNR3R4, in which R3 and R4 are as<br>
defined in Claim 1, in order to obtain the compound of<br>
general formula (XIV)<br>
which is converted to the ester of general formula (XV)<br>
the latter is then treated in the presence of<br>
dimethylformamide dimethyl acetal, in order to obtain<br>
the compound of general formula (XVI)<br>
and, finally, the latter is reacted with an amine of<br>
general formula R2NH2, in which R2 is as defined in<br>
Claim 1, in order to obtain the compound of general<br>
formula (I"")<br><br>
and, finally, if desired, a secondary amide of general<br>
formula (I"") is converted to the tertiary amide by an<br>
alkylation reaction.<br>

Compounds of general formula (I)<br><br>
in which X represents hydrogen or a halogen or an<br>
alkyl, alkoxy, trifluoromethyl or phenylmethoxy group,<br>
R1 represents hydrogen or an alkyl, cyclopropyl or<br>
phenylmethyl group, R2 represents either an optionally<br>
substituted alkyl group or an optionally substituted<br>
phenylalkyl group or a cyclohexylmethyl group or a<br>

optionally substituted phenyl group or a pyridinyl<br>
group or a 5-methyl-1,2-oxazolyl group or a 5-methyl-<br>
1,3,4-thiadiazolyl group or a naphthyl group, R3 and R4<br>
each represent hydrogen or an alkyl, 2-methoxyethyl,<br>
hydroxyalkyl, carboxyalkyl, alkoxycarbonylalkyl or<br>
phenylalkyl group or else together form, with the<br>
nitrogen atom which carries them, either an optionally<br>
substituted pyrrolidinyl group or a piperidinyl group<br>
or a morpholinyl group or a 4-methylpiperazinyl group<br><br>
