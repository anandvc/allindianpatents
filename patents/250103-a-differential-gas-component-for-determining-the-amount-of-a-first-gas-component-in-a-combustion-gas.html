				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a probe for use in determining the amount of a first gas<br>
component in a gas containing the first gas component and a second gas<br>
component which is obtainable from the first gas component by reduction or<br>
oxidation. More particularly, the invention relates to a differential gas component<br>
probe for determining the amount of a first gas component in a combustion gas.<br>
The invention finds particular application in the determination of the amount of<br>
NO2 in a gas containing NO2 and NO.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
It is required to measure the NOX (nitrogen oxides) emissions produced by<br>
combustion plant to ensure that environmental standards are met. The two most<br>
important constituents of NOX are NO (nitric oxide) and NO2 is far more toxic<br>
and reactive. Currently to measure accurately NOX at low levels extractive gas<br>
analysis must be used. A probe extracts a sample of the emissions, and a<br>
transfer line conveys the sample to measurement instrumentation which<br>
measures the NO and NO2 content. It has been found that the materials of<br>
which the probe and transfer line are made alter the emission sample so that the<br>
measurement instrumentation does not give an accurate measure of NO/NO2<br>
content. A metallic probe may convert NO2 to NO resulting in an artificially low<br>
measure of NO2. This especially occurs at high temperatures, i.e. temperatures<br>
of 500 degrees Celsius and above as found for example in a gas turbine engine<br>
exhaust. The material of the<br><br><br>
transfer line may absorb NO2, for example a transfer line made of<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE). In contrast to NO2, NO is very stable. In<br>
conclusion, current approaches to measuring NOX tend to under -measure total<br>
NOX and especially NO2.<br>
US 4432939 ammonia gas analyzer and a sulfuric acid converter which is utilized<br>
in the ammonia gas analyzer, and, in which a sample gas is maintained at a<br>
relatively high temperature prior to entering the sulfuric acid converter to<br>
thereby prevent acidic sulfuric acid sulfates and/or ammonia sulfates from<br>
crystallizing and being deposited on the walls of the device. The ammonia gas<br>
analyzer includes gas sampling means, a gas measuring channel connected to<br>
the gas sampling means, a comparison gas channel connected parallel to the<br>
measuring gas channel with the measuring gas channel including an NH3 /NO<br>
converter for converting NH3 in a sample gas into NO and means for measuring a<br>
concentration of NH3 on the basis of variations of an amount of NO in the<br>
measuring gas channel with respect to that in the comparison gas channel. A<br>
first sulfuric acid converter has an inlet connected to the sampling means and an<br>
outlet connected to an inlet portion of the comparison gas channel for converting<br>
sulfuric acid, sulfate and sulfur trioxide in the sample gas into sulfur dioxide. A<br>
second sulfuric acid converter has an inlet connected to the outlet of the NH3<br>
/NO converter and an outlet connected to an inlet of the measuring means.<br>
US 4822564 discloses a gas analyzer for determining the concentration of the<br>
oxides of nitrogen in a sample gas. The analyzer is particularly adapted for<br>
analyzing the exhaust from an internal combustion engine. In one embodiment,<br>
the analyzer comprises a sample chamber and a reference chamber. An<br><br><br>
arrangement is provided for delivering sample gas containing the lower oxide of<br>
nitrogen (NO) to the sample chamber and a quantity of ozone (O.sub.3) for<br>
reacting with this oxide of nitrogen and producing a chemiluminescence. After<br>
the chemiluminescence is completed, the sample gas is discharged to the<br>
reference chamber. A sample photodiode is disposed adjacent to the sample<br>
chamber for receiving light emitted from the sample chamber and producing a<br>
sample signal representative of the total photoemissivity of the sample gas. A<br>
reference photodiode is disposed adjacent to the reference chamber for receiving<br>
light emitted from the reference chamber and providing a reference signal<br>
representative of the dark current of the photodiodes and the background<br>
photoemissivity of the sample gas. A circuit is provided for conditioning and<br>
substracting the sample signal and the reference signal to produce an output<br>
representative of the concentration of the oxide of nitrogen in the sample gas.<br>
Dilution air is mixed with the sample gas either in the instrument with a viscous<br>
metering technique or in a sample probe, mounted in the exhaust of the engine,<br>
with a sonic metering technique. In other embodiments, a single sample<br>
photodiode is used to measure the chemiluminescent reaction and determine the<br>
oxide of nitrogen content of the sample gas.<br>
DE 10121262 (A1) discloses a volumetric flow of an analyte, comprising exhaled<br>
air, is fed to a gas sensor unit by means of a gas flow device, which can<br>
comprise various sensors for the determination of nitrogen oxides. An oxidation<br>
catalyst is used when using an NO2 sensor, which converts nitrogen monoxide to<br>
nitrogen dioxide and the gas sensor unit measures the content of nitrogen<br>
dioxide. The nitrogen monoxide content is calculated from the nitrogen dioxide<br><br><br>
content. In order to eliminate cross-sensitivity moisture and ethanol are also<br>
measured. Said device can be applied to the determination of nitrogen monoxide<br>
content of exhaled air.<br>

The first component probe may further comprise a converter for<br>
converting NO2 to NO, the converter being made of the same material as the<br>
wall of the first passage and being positioned in the first passage so that the<br>
first sample passes through the converter as it is conveyed along the first<br>
passage.<br>
The wall of the first passage is suitably made of a nickel alloy that is<br>
particularly efficient at converting NO2 to NO, and the wall of the second<br>
passage is suitably made of a ceramic material such as glass.<br>
Preferably, the first component probe comprises a first tube made of<br>
the nickel alloy, the second component probe comprises a second tube made<br>
of the ceramic material, the first and second tubes are disposed parallel and<br>
adjacent, and the first and second tubes are secured to one another such that<br>

of holes at spaced positions along its length, the second component probe<br>

According to a second aspect of the present invention there is provided<br>
a method of measuring the amount of a first gas component in a gas<br>
containing the first gas component and a second gas component obtainable<br>
from the first gas component by reduction or oxidation, the method<br><br>
comprising: taking a first sample of the gas, converting the first gas<br>
component present in the first sample to the second gas component, and<br>
measuring the total amount of the second gas component present in the first<br>
sample following the conversion; taking a second sample of the gas, and<br>
measuring the total amount of the second gas component present in the<br>
second sample; and subtracting the total amount of the second gas<br>
component present in the second sample from the total amount of the second<br>
gas component present in the first sample to determine the amount of first gas<br>
component present in the gas.<br>
The first gas component may be NO2 and the second gas component<br>
NO.<br>
The invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference<br>
to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Fig 1 illustrates a probe in accordance with the present invention;<br>
Fig 2 is an end view of the probe of Fig 1, viewing the probe from the<br>
right in Fig 1;<br>
Fig 3 is a cross-section on the line Ill-Ill in Fig 2; and<br>
Fig 4 is a cross-section on the line IV-IV in Fig 1.<br>
Referring to the drawings, the probe 1 comprises a first component<br>
probe 3 and a second component probe 5. Component probe 3 comprises a<br>
tube 7 made of a nickel alloy that is particularly efficient at converting NO2 to<br>
NO. Component probe 3 further comprises an NO2 to NO converter 9<br>
comprising shavings of the same nickel alloy as tube 7 held between<br>
perforated plates 11, again of the said nickel alloy. Component probe 5<br>
comprises a ceramic tube 13, e.g. a glass tube.<br><br>
Tubes 7, 13 are disposed parallel and adjacent. Towards one end the<br>
tubes are held by a mounting plate 15. Approximately three fifths of the way<br>
along the tubes from this one end the tubes are secured to one another by<br>
means of a clamp 17. Clamp 17 comprises two halves 19 secured together by<br>
means of a nut 21, bolt 23 and washer 25. By securing tubes 7,13 together as<br>
aforesaid the stronger nickel alloy component probe 3 supports the weaker<br>
ceramic component probe 5. Formed in the same side of tubes 7, 13 and at<br>
corresponding positions along the length of the tubes are holes 27.<br>
Probe 1 is intended to be mounted so as to extend across the exhaust<br>
gas flow of a gas turbine engine so that holes 27 face into the gas flow. For<br>
this purpose mounting plate 15 includes fixings 29. By so mounting the probe<br>
efficient sampling takes place across the breadth of the exhaust gas flow.<br>
Sampling across the breadth of the flow accurately characterises the flow.<br>
In use of probe 1 a heated switching arrangement, e.g. a heated<br>
solenoid valve made of inert materials, is connected to the probe to<br>
periodically switch between component probes 3, 5. A heated sample transfer<br>
line including a heated sample pump is connected to the common outlet from<br>
the heated switching arrangement to transfer samples to measurement<br>
instrumentation suitable for measuring NO. Sample integrity is maintained<br>
within the measurement instrumentation by the use of heated components.<br>
When component probe 3 is connected to the measurement<br>
instrumentation the sample pump sucks in exhaust gas from the gas turbine<br>
engine exhaust by way of holes 27 in nickel alloy tube 7. The gas travels<br>
along tube 7 and through converter 9. The nickel alloy of the tube 7 and<br>
converter 9 operates to convert all the NO2 present in the exhaust gas to NO.<br><br>
It is to be noted that this conversion is assisted by the temperature of the<br>
exhaust gas. The original NO present in the exhaust gas, NO-original,<br>
together with the NO that was obtained by converting the NO2, NO-converted,<br>
is then measured by the measurement instrumentation. This provides a<br>
measurement reading NO-total equals NO-original plus NO-converted.<br>
When component probe 5 is connected to the measurement<br>
instrumentation exhaust gas is sucked in via holes 27 in ceramic tube 13.<br>
Since ceramic is inert as regards the conversion of NO2 to NO, no NO2 will be<br>
converted to NO in component probe 5. Thus, in the case of component probe<br>
5, the measurement instrumentation will measure only the original NO present<br>
in the exhaust gas, NO-original.<br>
The difference between the measurements readings of component<br>
probes 3, 5 is a measure of the amount of NO2 present in the exhaust gas as<br>
there is a direct relationship between the amount of NO2 present and NO-<br>
converted. The component probe 5 measurement, NO-original, is subtracted<br>
from the component probe 3 measurement, NO-original plus NO-converted, to<br>
provide NO-converted.<br>
In the prior art the conversion by the probe of NO2 to NO is a problem<br>
as it results in an artificially low measure of NO2. In the above described<br>
probe in accordance with the present invention, in component probe 3, this<br>
property is turned to advantage, and utilised to convert all NO2 present to NO.<br>
In the prior art the absorption of NO2 by the material of the transfer line is a<br>
problem. In the above described probe in accordance with the present<br>
invention, in the case of component probe 3, all the NO2 is converted to NO<br>
and hence there is no NO2 to be absorbed by the transfer line, and, in the<br><br>
case of component probe 5, any absorption of NO2 by the transfer line is of no<br>
consequence as the purpose of probe 5 is measurement of the original NO<br>
only.<br>
The above described probe in accordance with the present invention is<br>
for use in the exhaust of a gas turbine engine, and utilises the high<br>
temperatures present in such an exhaust to assist in the conversion in<br>
component probe 3 of all the NO2 to NO. In the case where the probe is used<br>
to measure the amount of NO2 in a gas not at such high temperatures, then<br>
an additional heater would be desirable to ensure conversion of all the NO2 to<br>
NO in component probe 3.<br>
It is to be appreciated that in the limiting case the probe described<br>
above in accordance with the present invention may be utilised to measure<br>
the amount of NO2 in a gas not containing NO, i.e. where no NO is present in<br>
the gas only NO2. In this case the component probe 5 measurement, NO-<br>
original, would be zero, and the component probe 3 measurement, NO-<br>
original plus NO-converted, would equal NO-converted, i.e. the measure of<br>
the NO2 present in the gas.<br>
The present invention has been described above in the context of<br>
determining the amount of NO2 in a gas containing NO2 and NO. It is to be<br>
realised that the invention may also be used to determine the amount of a gas<br>
component other than NO2 (the gas component measured) where the gas<br>
contains the gas component measured and a further gas component which is<br>
obtainable from the gas component measured by reduction. For example, the<br>
invention might be used to determine the amount of S03 (sulphur trioxide) in a<br>
gas containing S03 and S02 (sulphur dioxide).<br><br>
The present invention has been described above in the context of<br>
determining the amount of a first gas component in a gas containing the first<br>
gas component and a second gas component obtainable from the first gas<br>
component by reduction. It is to be realised that the invention may be also be<br>
used to determine the amount of a first gas component in a gas containing the<br>
first gas component and a second gas component obtainable from the first<br>
gas component by oxidation, the reverse of reduction. Of course in this case<br>
the catalyst would be chosen for the purpose of converting the second gas<br>
component to the first gas component by oxidation. An example of this use of<br>
the invention is determination of the amount of CO (carbon monoxide) in a gas<br>
containing CO and CO2 (carbon dioxide).<br><br>

a combustion gas containing the first gas component (NO2 ) and a<br>
second gas component (NO) containing in the combustion gas<br>
including that obtainable from the first gas component (NO2 ) by<br>
reduction or oxidation, the probe (1) comprising: a first<br>
component probe (3) for taking a first sample of the gas and<br>
converting the total amount of the first gas component (NO2 )<br>
present in the first sample to the second gas component (NO), the<br>
first component probe (3) having a first passage (7) for<br>
conveying the first sample, the wall of the first passage in<br>
contact with the first sample being made of a material that<br>
converts the first gas component (NO2 ) to the second gas<br>
component (NO) wherein the temperature of the exhaust gas<br>
including that of a heated sample transfer mechanism assist the<br>
total conversion of the first gas component (NO2 ) to the second<br>
gas component (NO); a second component probe (5) for taking a<br>
second sample of the gas, the second component probe (5) having a<br>
second passage (13) for conveying the second sample, the wall of<br>
the second passage in contact with the second sample being made<br><br>
of a material that is inert as regards the conversion of the<br>
first gas component (NO2 ) to the second gas component (NO); and,<br>
a measurement device suitable for measuring the second gas<br>
component (NO) in a combustion gas, wherein the measurement<br>
device when connected to the first component probe (3) , a data<br>
representing an amount of the second gas component originally<br>
present in the first sample (No - original), a converted amount<br>
of the second gas component (NO-converted) is obtained, wherein<br>
the measurement device when connected to the second component<br>
probe (5), provides a data presenting the total amount of the<br>
second gas component (NO-original) present in the second sample,<br>
and wherein a difference in the outputted data from the component<br>
probes (3,5) provides the amount of the first gas component (NO )<br>
present in the exhaust gas.<br></td>
