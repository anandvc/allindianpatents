SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Our invention concerns time release fragrance sachets, methods of using same and methods of fabricating same.<br>
25<br>
The time release sachets of our invention comprise hollow container means fabricated from porous or non-porous materials.  The porous materials are porous to the fragrances contained within perfumed polymer particles<br>
30  located within the sachet.<br><br><br>
WO 99/47182<br><br>

The perfumed particles are fabricated using extrusion<br>
techniques and according to techniques -as â€žseÂ£ forth in U.S.<br>
Letters Patent No. 4,521,541 issued on June 4, 1985, the<br>
specification for which is incorporated by reference herein;<br>
U.S. Letters Patent No. 4,542,1S2 issued on September 17,<br>
1985, the specification for which is incorporated by<br>
reference herein; as well as U.S. Letters Patent No.<br>
5,54 3,398 issued on August 6, 1996, the specification for<br>
which is incorporated by reference herein.<br><br>
The polymer particles, containing the perfumes located within the sachet, contain perfumes as defined in U.S. Letters Patent No. 5,540,853 issued on July 30, 1996, the specification for which is incorporated by reference herein.<br>
In one embodiment, the perfume particles useful in the practice of our invention are "puffed" as a result of gaseous entrainment, which is carried out during the formation of said particles by means of extrusion.<br><br>
20<br>
Preferably, the sachets of our invention are fabricated from perfume-porous materials which typically have heat sealed closures. However, the enclosures of our invention may be fabricated from non-porous materials if the walls have 25  discrete openings so that fragrances may pass therethrough as they are being emitted from the control release fragrance-containing polymeric particles. Further, various forms of sealing the sachets are envisaged.<br>
3 0  In a further embodiment of the invention, the sachet<br>
according to the invention may include a desiccant such as<br><br>
WO 99/47182<br><br>
PCT/EP99/01789<br><br><br>
for example silica gel. Further, the sachets may include an anti-moth agent, typically in the form.,of a perfume.<br>
Examples of perfume-porous materials are synthetic S  non-woven polyesters, synthetic non-woven polypropylene, non-woven viscose and natural woven cotton interlock materials.  The sachet enclosures are fabricated from substances having from about 10 to 300, preferably 30 up to about 120 grams per square centimeter- (gsm) as a measurement<br>
10  of the weave. The geometry of the sachets of our invention may be spherical, ellipsoidal, . cylindrical or conical. The dimensions may be such that the height may vary from about 3 inches up to about 6 inches; the width may vary from about 2 inches up to about 5 inches; and, in the case of a spherical<br>
15  sachet, the diameter may vary from about 3 inches up to about 5 inches.<br>
The perfumed polymer particle weight within each sachet may vary from about 2 grams up to about 50 grams, with a 20  preferred range of from about 5 grams up to about 15 grams of perfumed particle.  The size of each perfumed particle may vary from about 0.05 cm up to about 1 cm.<br>
The fragrance material within the polymer has a calculated 25  logioP in the range of from about 3 up to about S, wherein P is the partition coefficient of the active or bioactive material between n-octanol and water.<br>
The perfume ingredients are preferred to have a boiling 30  point Â£ 250Â°C.  The logP of many perfume ingredients has<br>
been reported; for example, the Pomona92 database, available<br><br>
WO 99/47182<br><br>
PCT/EP99/01789<br><br><br>
from Daylight Chemical Information Systems, Inc. (Daylight CIS), Irvine, California, contains many, along with citations to the original literature.  However the logP values are most conveniently calculated by the "CLOGP" 5  program, also available from Daylight CIS.  This program<br>
also lists experimental logP values when they are available in the Pomona92 database.  The "calculated logP" (ClogP) is determined by the fragment approach of Hansch and Leo (cf., A. Leo, in Comprehensive Medicinal Chemistry,   Volume 4, C.<br>
10  Hansch, P.G. Sammens, J.B. Taylor and CA. Ramsden, editors, page 295, Pergamon Press, 1990, incorporated by reference herein).  The fragment approach is based on the chemical structure of each perfume ingredient and takes into account the numbers and types of atoms, the atom connectivity and<br>
15  the chemical bonding. The ClogP values, which are the most reliable and widely used estimates for this physiochemical property, are preferably used instead of the experimental logP values in the selection of perfume ingredients which are useful in the present invention.<br>
20<br>
Non-enduring perfume ingredients, which are preferably minimized in personal treatment, e.g., liquid personal cleansing compositions of the present invention, are those having a B.P. of less than about 250Â°C or having a ClogP of<br>
25  less than about 3.0 or having both a B.P. of less than about 250Â°C and a ClogP of less than about 3.0.  The table below gives some non-limiting examples of non-enduring perfume ingredients. In sons particular fabric softener compositions, some non-enduring perfume ingredients can be used in small<br>
3 0  amounts, e.g., to improve product odor.  However, to<br>
minimize waste, the enduring perfume compositions of the<br><br>
WO 99/47182	PCT/EP99/01789<br><br>
present invention contain less than about 30 weight percent of non-enduring perfume ingredients, preferably 1-ess than about 25 weight percent of non-enduring perfume ingredients, more preferably, less than about 20 weight percent of non-5  enduring perfume ingredients, and even more preferably, less than about 15 weight percent of non-enduring perfume ingredients.<br><br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
20  Figure 1A is an outer view of a foamed polymeric particle containing functional fluid or solid as indicated by reference numeral 10.<br>
Figure IB is a cross-section of the particle of Figure 1A, 25  taken along line IB in Figure 1A.  Part of the particle indicated by reference numeral 10.  is the outer surface thereof. Reference numeral 11  indicated one of the pores produced as a result of foaming.<br><br><br>
Figure 2 is a schematic cutaway elevation diagram of the extrusion and peiietizing apparatus useful in carrying out the process of our invention during the operation of said apparatus. Motor 15 drives the extruder screws located at 23A in barrel 16, the extruder being operated at temperatures in the range of about 150Â°C. up to about 250Â°C. At the beginning of the barrel resin at source 12 together with additives, e.g., opacifiers, processing aids, colors, pearlescent agents and densifiers at location 13 is added via addition funnel 14 into the extruder. Simultaneously (when the operation reaches "steady state"), fragrance is added to the extruder at one, two or more of barrel segments 3-8 of the extruder (which may be a twin screw or single screw extruder) at locations 18a, 18b, 18c and 18d by means of gear pump 23 from source 17. From source 19 into barrel segments 5-10, the gaseous or liquid blowing agents, e.g., nitrogen, carbon dioxide and the like as described, supra, are added simultaneously with the addition of the fragrance. The feed rate range of resin is about 80-300 lbs per hour. The feed rate range of the fragrance is between 1 and 35% of the feed rate range of the resin. The blowing agent rate range is such that the pressure of the gas or the pressure over the liquid being fed into the extruder is between about 50 and 200 psig. If desired, the extruded ribbon or cylinder may be passed through water bath 20 and pelletizer 21 into collection apparatus 21a. Figure 22 indicates the travel of the extruded material prior to entering pelletizer 21.<br>
Figure 3 is a detailed cutaway perspective view of such a pelletizer as is used in conjunction with the apparatus of Figure 2. The extruded material coming from the water cooler which is already foamed and which already contains fragrance is fed into the pelletizer at zero pressure at location 434. The pelletizer is operated using a spinning extrusion die 436 and operated by means of a rotating wheel 434. Moving pellet knife 431 and dual knife units 430a and 430b cause pellets to be formed which fly into a cooling water stream 432. The resulting pellets which are foamed and contain<br><br><br>
fragrance exit from the pellitizer at 433.<br>
Similarly, an extruded tube which can be used as such or cut into smaller lengths is shown to be formed using the apparatus of Figure 4. Thus, a single screw 35B taken alone or further together with a second screw 25A makes up part of an extruder in casing 33. Resin from resin funnel 30 is fed in at location 31 into the extrusion barrel upstream from the feeding of fragrance which is located at source 450. Simultaneously, fragrance from source 450 is fed through line 460 past valve 461 using pump 462 into the extrusion barrel. The extruder causes an intimate mixing of the fragrance with the resin in the screw conveyor threads 34 and 36. Simultaneously, upstream from the addition of the fragrance, gaseous blowing agent is fed through line 43 past valve 42 into the extrusion screws at location 44. The extruded tube is then forced through die 37 and orifice 38 onto conveyor belt 40 in the form of tube 39A which may be subsequently cut at location 39B. The conveyor belt is operated using roller 41<br>
The resulting extruded foam tubing or foamed pellets may be cut up for the purpose of creation of an article of manufacture which contains fragrance. Such article of manufacture may be molded using injection molding apparatus of the type set forth in Figures 5A, 5B and 6, or jet molding apparatus of the type set forth in Figure 7.<br>
Figures 5A and 5B show the injection molding apparatus in operation. In Figure 5A, plunger 73 pushes the foamed fragrance-containing polymeric particles through cylinder 75 heated by heating unit 76 through die 78 out of orifice 79 into the mold 77/82/80/81. The mold is composed of a male portion 80 and female portion 82. Thus, in summary, the injection molding is characterized by the fact that the molding mix is preheated in a plasticizing cylinder having a cylinder liner 109 (as shown in Figure 6) to a temperature high enough for it to retain a quasi-liquid condition and is then forced by plunger 89 through the plunger cylinder into heating cylinder 91  (the temperature for which is<br><br><br>
measured using a thermocouple in thermocouple container 94), into a closed mold 108 which is cold enough to "freeze" the mixture to a solid sufficiently rigid for ejection. Molding mix containing the foamed polymeric particles 86 is fed in the plasticizing cylinder through hopper 85. When the mold opens, the cylinder plunger 89 moves back permitting material to drop into the cylinder. On the closing stroke, the mold members lock tightly together and the cyfi"nder pfunger moves forward forcing the newfy defivered material from the hopper into the heating zone of the cylinder 90. This material, in turn, displaces a "shot" of molten material through the nozzle 93 in the mold cavity through orifice 111. The mold is cooled so that the shot hardens quickly. Conditions are controlled so that the molten plastic just has time to reach the outer most recesses of the mold cavity before flow ceases. When the mold is opened, the formed piece is loosened by knockout pins 99, 100, 101 and 102. The function of the spreader 90 is to spread the mix into thin films and facilitate uniform heating as it passes toward the nozzle 93.<br>
In Figure 7, which is a schematic diagram of a cutaway elevation view of a jet molding apparatus useful in producing articles of manufacture using the foamed polymeric fragrance-containing particles of our invention, the mix 120 is fed into a hopper and from thence falls into a feed cylinder at 120 which is cooled using water cooling 124. The material is then moved forward toward the nozzle end of the cylinder consisting of a nozzle block containing a full taper 127 and heated by a band heater at 128. The amount of heat and rate of heating is measured using a controlling thermocouple 129. The pressure is supplied by the injection plunger 130 having water cooling connection 123 at location 121. As the mix nears the nozzle, mold heat is applied Temperatures of 150Â°F. - 200Â°F. are maintained, and the mix is merely warmed in this zone. Under the high pressure of the injection plunger 130, the foamed polymeric fragrance-containing particles begin to flow into the nozzle 136 at location 134. Thus, for example, placed around the nozzle are two or more electrodes by means of which intense heat is<br><br><br>
generated by induction. The heat is transferred to the thin stream of mix as it passes through the nozzle 136. By this means, the temperature of the mix is raised almost instantaneously to 400Â° F. - 500Â° F. Too high a jet molding temperature can create a destruction of the fragrance during the production of the fragrance-containing article of manufacture.<br>
The essence of our invention is a control release device made into a sachet using the various fragrances as listed in the table, supra. Such sachets are shown in Figures 8, 9, 10 and 11. Thus, after placing polymeric fragrance-containing pellets 167 into cylinder 166 (the pellets, for example, being pellets produced using the apparatus shown in Figures 2 and 3), the resulting article can be placed into a clothes closet or the like as hung from a hanger as indicated by reference numeral 204 in Figure 11. As stated, supra, the sachet container is fabricated from porous, microporous or non-porous material indicated by reference numeral 201. The overall sachet of Figure 11 is indicated by reference numeral 200. The fragrance-containing polymeric. pellets are indicated by reference numeral 10. The surface through which the fragrance is transmitted on storage isindicated by reference numeral 202.<br>
In fabricating the sachets of our invention, two square prefabricated portions of the outer container are shown in Figures 12A and 12B to have heat-sealable edges 202A and 202B. Microporous polymer particles as produced using the apparatus of Figures 2 and 3 are placed on the surface of the prefabricated section as indicated by reference numeral 10, the surfaces of the prefabricated sections being indicated by reference Numerals 204A and 204B.<br>
Referring to Figures 16 and 17, the apparatus used in producing polymeric fragrances useful in the practice of cur invention comprises a device for forming scented polyolefin (for example) pellets,  which  comprises a vat or container 1212 into which a mixture of<br><br><br>
polyolefin such as polyethylene and an aromatic substance or scented material is placed (in this case at least one of the fragrances useful in the practice of our invention).<br>
The container is closed by an air-tight lid 1228 and the air-tight lid 1228 is clamped to the container 1212 by bolts 1265.<br>
A stirrer 1273 traverses the lid or cover 1228 in an air-tight manner and is rotated in a suitable manner.<br>
Container 1212 having heating coils 1212A which are supplied with electric current through cable 1224 from a rheostat or control 1216 is operated to maintain a temperature inside the container 1212 such that polyethylene or other thermoplastic polymer in the container will be maintained in the molten or liquid state. It has been found advantageous to employ a colorless, odorless polymer (e.g., polyethylene) with viscosity ranging between 180 and 220 Saybolt seconds and having a melting point in the range of 200Â° F. - 280Â° F. The heater 1212A is operated to maintain the upper portion of the container 1212 within a temperature range of from 250Â° F. - 350Â° F. The bottom portion of the container is heated by means of heating coils 1212A heated through control 1220 connected thereto through a connecting wire 1222 to maintain the lower portion of the container within a temperature range of from 250Â°F. - 350Â°F.<br>
Thus, polymer (e.g., polyethylene) is added to container 1212 and is heated from 10-12 hours whereafter a scented aroma imparting material (at least one of the fragrances useful in the practice of our invention) is added quickly to the melt. The material must be compatible with the polyolefin and forms a homogeneous liquid melt therewith. The scented material is of a type for the particular aroma desired and formulated specifically for    the    scenting     purpose    for    which    the    polyolefin    will     be    employed.<br><br><br>
Generally, about 5-30% by weight of the scented material (containing at ieast one of the fragrances  useful   in  the  practice  of our  invention)  are  added  to  the  polyolefin.<br>
After the scent imparting material (e.g., a composition containing at least one of the fragrances useful in the practice of our invention) is added to the container 1212, the mixture is stirred for a few minutes, for example, 5-15 minutes and maintained within the temperature   range   as   indicated,   supra,   by   means   of   heating   coils   1212A.<br>
The controls 1216 and 1220 are connected, respectively, through cables 1214 and 1222, respectively, to heating coils 1212A. The said controls 1216 and 1220 are also connected through cables 1224 and 1226, respectively, to a suitable power supply of electric current for supplying the electric power to the heating coils 1212A for heating purposes.<br>
Thereafter, the valve "V" is opened permitting the mass to flow outwardly through conduit 1218/1232 having a multiplicity of orifices 1234, adjacent to the lower side thereof. The outer end of the conduit 1218/1232 is closed so that the liquid polymer (e.g., polyolefin) and aroma imparting material (e.g., at least one of the fragrances useful in the practice of our invention) will continuously drop through orifices 1234 downwardly from conduit 1232. During this time, the temperature of the polymer (e.g., polyolefin) and scent imparting material (e.g., a mixture containing at least one of the fragrances useful in the practice of our invention) is accurately controlled so that a temperature in the range of from about 210Â° - 275Â° F. will exist in the conduit 1218/1232. The regulation of the temperature through controls 1216 and 1220 is essential in order to insure temperature balance to provide for the continuous dropping or dripping of molten polymer (e.g., polyethylene) and scenting material (e.g., one or more of the fragrances useful in the practice of our invention) mixture through the<br><br><br>
orifices 1234 at a rate which wifl insure the formation of droplets 1236 which will fali downwardly onto a moving conveyor belt 1238 caused to run between conveyor wheels 1240 and 1242 beneath the conduit 1232.<br>
When the droplets 1236 fall onto the conveyor belt 1238, they form pellets 1244 which harden almost instantaneously and fall off the end of the conveyor belt 1238 into a container       1245       and       utilized       in       processes      as       illustrated,       infra.<br>
A feature of this aspect of the process of our invention is the provision for moistening the conveyor belt 1238 to insure rapid formation of the solid polymeric (e.g., polyolefin) scented pellets 1244 without sticking to the belt. The conveyor belt 1238 is advantageously fabricated of a material which will not normally stick to a melted plastic, but a moistening means 1248 insures a sufficiently cold temperature of the belt surface for an adequate formation of the pellets 1244. The adequate moistening means comprises a container 1250 which is continuously fed with water 1254 to maintain a level for moistening a sponge element 1256 which bears against the exterior of the Conveyor belt 1238.<br>
