				<td>MULTIPURPOSE GARMENT FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to clothing articles, such as garments and / or aprons, which has multi purpose use In one aspect, the present invention provides an apron which can be worn by a user in several ways, and alternatively, provides a carry bag/backpack which can be used to carry general goods and /or a storage bag for holding, storing and carrying, Items, tools and accessories.<br>
It will be convenient to hereinafter describe the invention in relation to a multipurpose   garment;  however it should   be appreciated  that the  present invention is not limited to that use only. BACKGROUND ART<br>
A number of attempts have been made In the prior art to provide<br>
multipurpose bags.	<br>
One example is disclosed In JP 2002001011 which discloses an apron<br>
capable of being transformed into a bag different in shape from the apron.<br>
However, in carrying out the transformation process from an apron to a carry bag,<br>
the design requires a number of straps or handles to be dislodged and relocated.<br>
Furthermore, the apron must be folded and |clipped together in a particular<br>
manner in order to form the carry bag Itself. These transformation processes are<br>
considered to be relatively complicated, and involve a relatively high level of<br>
dexterity on the part of the user to make the transformation from apron to carry<br>
bag and visa-versa.	<br>
Another example is FR 2 248 001 which also discloses an apron which can<br>
be transformed into a bag. However, the design; of the apron is such that the size<br>
of the bag is limited in comparison to the flap of the apron which is folded over the<br>
bag. Further, alternate, uses of the apron or bag are not considered possible due<br>
to the design disclosed.	<br>
US 5,941,437 discloses a stroller bag which can be also converted into a carry bag However, the bag is designed in a manner which is not considered practical nor fashionable as an apron. The design does not afford substantial protection to the user when it Is worn as it's coverage is relatively limited.<br>
Still another example is US 6,530,089 which discloses an adjustable garment protector which may also be fabricated as a convertible food bag.<br>
However, the food bag provided is also disposable which limits its ability to be reused. It is considered to be not suitable for carrying general goods, such as grocery items, as the bag does not have suitable handles and is adapted to provide a closed bag with a lid. This is considered to limit the use of the bag provided in this disclosure.<br>
There is still considered to be a need for a multi-purpose garment, such as an apron which can be transformed into a carry bag.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to alleviate at least one disadvantage of the prior art.<br>
Any discussion of documents, devices, acts or knowledge in this specification is included to explain the context of the invention. It should not be taken as an admission that any of the material forms a part of the prior art base or the common genera! knowledge in the relevant art in Australia or elsewhere on or before the priority date of the disclosure and claims herein. SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention provides, in one aspect, a clothing article, being adapted for multi purpose use, the first use being a carry bag and the second use being a garment protector, the article comprising a first body portion having attached thereto an additional panel forming a closable pouch between the panel and the first portion, the pouch being adapted, in use, to have goods placed therein, a blb portion having a strap adapted for placement around the neck of a user and being adapted to support the article, the bib portion being retractable in a direction towards the first body portion, and a second portion disposed intermediate the first portion and the bib portion.<br>
The present invention also provides, In another aspect, a method of transforming an article of clothing being a garment protector into a carry bag, the article having a first body portion having attached thereto an additional panel forming a pouch between the panel and the first portion, the pouch being adapted, in use, to have goods placed therein, a bib portion and disposed intermediate the first portion and the bib portion Is a second portion, the method comprising the steps of retracting the bib portion and the second portion toward the first portion and away from the pouch and releasably securing the bib portion to the first portion.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides, an article substantially as herein disclosed,<br>
In yet another aspect, the present invention provides a method of transforming an article as herein disclosed.<br>
Other aspects and preferred aspects are disclosed in the specification and / or defined in the appended claims, forming, a part of the description of the invention.<br>
In essence, the present invention provides a design which is considered very useful. When converted to a bag, the present invention enables various goods to be transported and when converted to an apron, the apron can be used for general purposes, such as for substantially protecting a portion of the clothing of a user. An example of the use of the Apron Carry Bag of the present invention is at a barbeque or picnic. Foods, drinks, cutlery can be carried by the present invention to the barbeque or picnic site, emptied out of the bag, the bag can be then converted to one of several types of reversible aprons for the food preparation. School children could use the convertible bag to carry art or craft work materials and then later convert the Apron Carry Bag to a form of protective garment such as an apron while working on their project, The present invention provides, in one form, a reversible Apron Carry Bag, in the form of a reversible pocketed apron that also converts to a general goods carrying bag. The present invention provides a garment which comprises, in one form, an apron which has pockets for holding various items and can also be converted to a general carry bag/backpack.

 proximate the top of panel 11. This folding is performed preferably in the opposition direction from the carry bag pouch formed between panels 11 and 18 as described above. That is, the folded bib portion, and along imaginary line (A), does not form a closure or lid over the pouch formed by panels 11 and 18. Thus, this folding may forms a decorative bag flap to hide and support bib panel 8, neck strap 9, waist strap 4 and / or connection snap 1a and / or to expose or enable carry handles 14a and 14b Jo be used. In addition the flap may be used as closure or lid for the front pockets 5 and 6 (not shown).<br>
Figure 7 shows the manner, which the apron may be worn reversible around the waist of a person with bib 8 folded behind, or detached. The buckle ends 3a and 3b may be attached to waist strap 4 as shown in figure 1 and may be coupled between snap connections 1a and 1b of Figure 2. Connection 1a is on the side of the apron facing the person, and thus not visible in Figure 7.<br>
Figure 8, there is also shown a loop 15 attached to panel 11 and a pair of snap connection 1c and 1 d attached to panel 12. The purpose of the loop 15 is to hold and support the waist strap 4, and engage the buckle end 3a and 3b to the snap connection 1c and 1d. When the buckled end 3a and 3b is coupled to the snap connection 1c and id, the waist strap 4 providing a means by which, in use, a user can use it as a back shoulder straps as in a backpack.<br>
Figure 4, 9 and 10 show apron being configured to a storage bag by folding bib 8 toward second portion 2 in an overlapping manner as shown in figure 4. Bib 8, second portion 2 and first portion 18 can then be rolled in on themselves (sideways) from left to right (or visa versa) as shown in Figure 9. By further rolling or overlapping blb 8, first and second portions 18 and 2, fasteners 20 and 19 may be engaged to form a storage bag as shown in Figure 10. Detachable waist strap 4 with clips 3a and 3b may engage connection snap1b and 1c of the storage bag to form carry strap for comfortably carrying the bag by the user over their shoulder or otherwise as a carry handle.<br>
