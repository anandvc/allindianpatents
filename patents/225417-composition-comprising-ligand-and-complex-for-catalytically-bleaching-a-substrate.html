LIGAND AND COMPLEX FOR CATALYTICALLY BLEACHING A SUBSTRATE<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
    This invention relates to a class of ligand or complex <br>
5  thereof useful as catalysts for catalytically bleaching   <br>
   substrates.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
The use of bleaching catalysts for stain removal has been<br>
 10  developed over recent years.<br>
The search for new classes of compounds that are suitable as peroxyl catalysts is ongoing.<br>
15  Various [3.3.1] bicyclo compounds and complexes thereof are discussed in the literature, see for example: Comba P. et al., J. Chem. Soc. Dalton Trans, 1998, (23) 3997-4001; Borzel et al. Chem. Eur. J. 1999, 5, No. 6, 1716 to 1721 and review by P. Comba in Coordination Chemistry Reviews 2000,<br>
20  200-202, 217 to 245, entitled "Coordination compounds in the Entactic State".  These compounds are discussed in terms of their physical properties.<br>
WO0060045, to Proctor and Gamble, discloses a bleaching 25  system comprising: a) from about lppb, by weight of a<br>
transition metal catalyst comprising: i) a transition metal; ii) a ligand having formula (I) :<br><br>

wherein each R is independently hydrogen, hydroxyl, C1-C4 alkyl, and mixtures thereof; Rl is C1-C4 alkyl, C6-C10 aryl, and mixtures thereof; R2 is C1-C4 alkyl, C6-C10 aryl, and mixtures thereof; R3 and R4 are each independently hydrogen, C1-C8 alkyl, C1-C8 hydroxyalkyl, -(CH2)XC02R5 wherein R5 is C1-C4 alkyl, x is from 0 to 4, and mixtures thereof; X is carbonyl, -C(R6)2- wherein each R6 is independently hydrogen,<br>
hydroxyl, C1-C4 alkyl, and mixtures thereof; b) optionally a source of hydrogen peroxide; and c) the balance carriers and adjunct ingredients.  However, the teaching of WO0060045 limits substituents at the nitrogens (3 and 7 positions) of bicyclostructure to homoaromatic carbon groups, namely alkyl and aryl.<br><br>
WO0248310, to Unilever, in contrast to WO0060045 discloses compounds having a similar core structure but with the <br>
20  requirement that at least one of Rl and R2 is a group  <br>
    containing a heteroatom capable of coordinating to a  <br>
     transition metal.<br>
    SUMMARY OF INVENTION <br>
25  Our earlier filed application WO0248301, filed 15 November  <br>
    2002, which claims priority from GB0030673.8, filed 15<br><br>

     December 2000, discloses the use of various bispidon <br>
     compounds. Referring to the structure above, WO024 8301   <br>
 teaches that there is an advantage to be secured by having at least one of Rl and R2 as group containing a heteroatom   capable of coordinating to a transition metal. We have now found that by having at least one of Rl and R2 as a C8-C22-alkyl chain further advantages are secured.<br>
The present Invention provides a bleaching composition <br>
10  comprising:<br>
a) a monomer ligand, L, or transition metal catalyst thereof of a ligand having the formula (I):<br><br>

     present invention.<br>
The present invention extends to a commercial package comprising the bleaching composition according to the <br>
25  present invention together with instructions for its use.<br>
Any suitable textile that is susceptible to bleaching or one that one might wish to subject to bleaching may be used. Preferably the textile is a laundry fabric or garment. <br><br>
WO 2005/049778<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/011680<br><br>

In a preferred embodiment, the method according to the present invention is carried out on a laundry fabric using an aqueous treatment liquor.  In particular, the treatment may be effected in a wash cycle for cleaning laundry.  More   preferably, the treatment is carried out in an aqueous detergent bleach wash liquid.<br>
The organic substance can be contacted with the textile fabric in any conventional manner. For example it may be   applied in dry form, such as in powder form, or in a liquor that is then dried, for example in an aqueous spray-on fabric treatment fluid or a wash liquor for laundry cleaning, or a non-aqueous dry cleaning fluid or spray-on aerosol fluid.<br>
15<br>
In a particularly preferred embodiment the method according to the present invention is carried out on a laundry fabric using aqueous treatment liquor. In particular the treatment may be effected in, or as an adjunct to, an essentially<br>
20  conventional wash cycle for cleaning laundry. More<br>
preferably, the treatment is carried out in an aqueous detergent wash liquor. The organic substance can be delivered into the wash liquor from a powder, granule, pellet, tablet, block, bar or other such solid form. The<br>
25  solid form can comprise a carrier, which can be particulate, sheet-like or comprise a three-dimensional object. The carrier can be dispersible or soluble in the wash liquor or may remain substantially intact. In other embodiments, the organic substance can be delivered into the wash liquor from<br>
30  a paste, gel or liquid concentrate.<br><br>
WO 2005/049778<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/011680<br><br>
-   7   -<br>
In the alternative, the organic substance can be presented in the form of a wash additive that preferably is soluble. The additive can take any of the physical forms used for wash additives, including powder, granule, pellet, sheet,  tablet, block, bar or other such solid form or take the form of a paste, gel or liquid. Dosage of the additive can be unitary or in a quantity determined by the user. While it is envisaged that such additives can be used in the main washing cycle, the use of them in the conditioning or drying cycle is not hereby excluded.<br>
The present invention is not limited to those circumstances in which a washing machine is employed, but can be applied where washing is performed in some alternative vessel. In<br>
15  these circumstances it is envisaged that the organic<br>
substance can be delivered by means of slow release from the bowl, bucket or other vessel which is being employed, or from any implement which is being employed, such as a brush, bat or dolly, or from any suitable applicator.<br>
20<br>
Suitable pre-treatment means for application of the organic substance to the textile material prior to the main wash include sprays, pens, roller-ball devices, bars, soft solid applicator sticks and impregnated cloths or cloths<br>
25  containing microcapsules. Such means are well known in the analogous art of deodorant application and/or in spot treatment of textiles. Similar means for application are employed in those embodiments where the organic substance is applied after the main washing and/or conditioning steps<br>
30  have been performed, e.g. prior to or after ironing or<br>
drying of the cloth.  For example, the organic substance may<br><br>
WO 2005/049778<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/011680<br><br>
-   8   -<br>
be applied using tapes, sheets or sticking plasters coated or impregnated with the substance, or containing microcapsules of the substance.  The organic substance may for example be incorporated into a drier sheet so as to be   activated or released during a tumble-drier cycle, or the<br>
substance can be provided in an impregnated or microcapsule-containing sheet so as to be delivered to the textile when ironed.<br>
10  DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The ligand as described herein is capable of dynamic inversion.  The ability of the ligand to chelate to a TM depends upon the stereochemistry of the substituents.  It is preferred that substituents are endo-endo, but it is likely<br>
15  that stereochemical conversion takes place by retro-Mannich conversion.  Retro-Mannich may be prevented by changing the groups present such that retro-Mannich reactions are unfavoured.  Nevertheless, it is likely that endo-exo and exo-exo ligands as described herein coordinate to transition<br>
20  metal ions in many instances and are capable of functioning as bleaching catalysts.<br>
Referring to ligands and complexes thereof and bleaching compositions derived therefrom with respect to Formula (I),<br>
25  at least one of Rl and R2 groups as designated in the ligand of formula (I) must be a non-aromatic hydrocarbon group, the non-aromatic hydrocarbon group being a C8-C22-alkyl chain. The C8-C22-alkyl chain may incorporate a branched, cyclic moiety or mixtures thereof as part of the C8-C22-alkyl<br>
30  chain. It is preferred that the C8-C22-alkyl chain is a straight chain moiety.  The following are provided as<br><br>
WO 2005/049778<br><br>
PCTYEP2004/011680<br><br>

exemplified preferred groups of the C8-C22-alkyl chain: -(CH2)7CH3, -(CH2)8CH3, -(CH2)9CH3, -(CH2)10CH3, -(CH2)nCH3, -(CH2)12CH3, -(CH2)13CH3, -(CH2)i4CH3, -{CH2)15CH3, -(CH2)16CH3, -(CH2)17CH3, -(CH2)18CH3, -(CH2)i9CH3, -(CH2)20CH3, and -(CH2)2iCH3.<br>
The following are examples of branched and cyclic C8-C22-alkyl chains that may be used as Rl and R2 groups:<br><br>
15  With reference to the above referenced structures, each<br>
structure has at least a C8-alkyl chain, be it cyclic, linear, or branched.  The C8-C22-alkyl chain need not be continuous linkage of alkyl groups as exemplified in the<br><br>
WO 2005/049778<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/011680<br><br>
-   10   -<br>
ether above or phenyl spacer but it is preferred that the at least eight alkyl groups of the alkyl chain are in a continuous linkage without separation by a non alkyl group. The C8-C22-alkyl chain may contain some degree of   unsaturation and may have pendent groups that do not take away from the hydrophobic nature of the C8-C22-alkyl chain. It is preferred that the C8-C22-alkyl chain is saturated. <br>
The C8-C22-alkyl chain may have a pendent phenyl <br>
substituent.  Irrespective of a pendent group that is <br>
present the C8-C22-alkyl chain must have at least a C8-alkyl chain that may be cyclic or branched but preferably linear. A narrower range of alkyl chain is most preferred, namely a C10-C20 alkyl chain. A most preferred upper length of the alkyl chain is C18.<br>
15<br>
When one of Rl or R2 is a group containing a heteroatom capable of coordinating to a transition metal it is preferred that the group is a chelating 4 to 7 membered ring, preferably a 5 to 6 membered ring, comprising a<br>
20  heteroatom and that ring is connected to the nitrogens at<br>
the 3 or 7 position of the bispidon by a non co-ordinating 1 to 5 linking chain to the group, for example an ether linkage.  It is most preferred that the 1 to 5 linking chain is a hydrocarbon chain, for example: -(CHa)-, -(CH2) 2-,   ~<br>
25  (CH2)3~, -(CH2)4-, and -(CH2)5-, which are preferred.  The<br>
chelating rings are preferably aromatic rings having as the heteroatom nitrogen.  Most preferred groups are those defined for z spaced by at least one methylene chain between z and the nitrogens at the 3 or 7 position, most preferred<br>
30  is a pyridine group.  Other preferred groups are tertiary<br><br>

      ligand complex, and a source of transition metal, whereby   <br>
      the complex is formed in situ  in the medium.<br>

5<br>
The novel compounds of Formula (I) as provided by the present invention also extend to their various transition metal complexes, the transition metal complexes are as discussed above with reference to (Al). <br>
10<br>
It will be appreciated that the complex (Al) can be formed by any appropriate means, including in situ  formation whereby precursors of the complex are transformed into the active complex of general formula (Al) under conditions of<br>
15  storage or use.  Preferably, the complex is formed as a well-defined complex or in a solvent mixture comprising a salt of the metal M and the ligand L or ligand L-generating species.  Alternatively, the catalyst may be formed in situ from suitable precursors for the complex, for example in a<br>
20  solution or dispersion containing the precursor materials. In one such example, the active catalyst may be formed in situ  in a mixture comprising a salt of the metal M and the ligand L, or a ligand L-generating species, in a suitable solvent.  Thus, for example, if M is iron, an iron salt such<br>
25  as FeS04 can be mixed in solution with the ligand L, or a ligand L-generating species, to form the active complex. Thus, for example, the composition may formed from a mixture of the ligand L and a metal salt MXn in which preferably n=l-5, more preferably 1-3.  In another such example, the ligand<br>
30  L, or a ligand L-generating species, can be mixed with metal M ions present in the substrate or wash liquor to form the<br><br>
WO 2005/049778<br><br>
PCT7EP2004/011680<br><br>
-   18   -<br>
active catalyst in  situ.     Suitable ligand L-generating species include metal-free compounds or metal coordination complexes that comprise the ligand L and can be substituted by metal M ions to form the active complex according the <br>
5   formula (Al).<br>
The catalysts according to the present invention may be used for laundry cleaning, hard surface cleaning (including cleaning of lavatories, kitchen work surfaces, floors,<br>
10   mechanical ware washing etc.). As is generally known in the art, bleaching compositions are also employed in waste-water treatment, pulp bleaching during the manufacture of paper, leather manufacture, dye transfer inhibition, food processing, starch bleaching, sterilisation, whitening in<br>
15  oral hygiene preparations and/or contact lens disinfection.<br>
In typical washing compositions the level of the organic substance is such that the in-use level is from luM to 50mM, with preferred in-use levels for domestic laundry operations<br>
20  falling in the range 10 to 100 uM.  Higher levels may be<br>
desired and applied in industrial bleaching processes, such as textile and paper pulp bleaching.  These levels reflect the amount of catalyst that may be present in a wash dose of a detergent composition.  The bleaching composition<br>
25  comprises at least 1 ppb of the ligand or complex thereof.<br>
    In the context of the present invention, bleaching should be  <br>
    understood as relating generally to the decolourisation of   <br>
    stains or of other materials attached to or associated with 30  a substrate.  However, it is envisaged that the present<br>
invention can be applied where a requirement is the removal<br><br>

PCT/EP2004/011680<br><br>

and/or neutralisation by an oxidative bleaching reaction of malodours or other undesirable components attached to or otherwise associated with a substrate.  Furthermore, in the context of the present invention bleaching is to be <br>
5    understood as being restricted to any bleaching mechanism or  <br>
     process that does not require the presence of light or <br>
     activation by light.<br>
Synthesis<br>
10  In addition to the utility of the ligands and complexes of<br>
the present invention as catalysts another advantage is that the ligands are generally relatively easy to synthesize in comparison to other ligands.  The following is one example of a strategic synthetic, approach; it will be evident to one<br>
15  skilled in the art of synthetic organic chemistry that many approaches may be taken to obtain ligands and complexes for use in the present invention.  The ease of synthesis of the ligand of Formula (I) is dependent upon the nature of substituents about the structure. The ligands of Formula (I)<br>
20  are most preferably symmetric.  Synthesis of these types of molecules are found in articles by U. Holzgrabe et al. in Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim, Ger.) 1992, 325, 657 and A. Samhammer et al. Arch. Pharm. (Weinheim, Ger.) 1984, 322, 557.  Below is given a schematic example illustrating the<br>
25  ease of synthesis.  The synthesis is shown in a two step<br>
synthesis, Scheme 1 and Scheme 2, but in some cases may be conducted as a "one-pot" synthesis depending upon the nature of the substituents.  Nevertheless, where substituents at positions 7 and 3 are different a two step synthesis is<br>
30  preferred. The product of reaction as found in Scheme 1 is referred to as dimethyl 2,6-di-(2-pyridyl)-1-dodecane-<br><br>

piperid-4-one-3,5-dicarboxylate, which can easily tautomerize to the enol. The synthesis is similar to that exemplified in R. Haller, K.W. Merz, Pharm.   Acta  Helv., 1963,   442.<br>

One skilled in the art will appreciate that whilst Ac [-CO(0)Me] is an electron withdrawing group and electron withdrawing groups are generally preferred to facilitate   synthesis other groups will also allow the reaction to<br>
proceed.  Examples of suitable electron withdrawing groups are given above and will be evident to one skilled in the art.  The reaction is also driven by precipitation of the product from solution.<br>
10<br>
In instances, depending upon the nature of the substituents, for example a phenolic group, it will be necessary to protect certain functional groups. The choice of protecting groups during synthesis to prevent undesirable reactions<br>
15  will be evident to one skilled in the art. For a discussion of protecting groups in organic synthesis the reader is directed to T. W. Green and P. G. M. Wuts, Protective Groups In Organic Synthesis 3nd Ed.; J. Wiley and Sons, 1999.<br>
20  It will be evident that if a diamine is substituted for Me2NCH2CH2NH2 in the reaction illustrated in Scheme 2 two structures may be linked together via the 7 positions as found in the structure below.<br><br>

In addition, if a diamine is substituted for CH3(CH)nNH2 in the reaction illustrated in Scheme 1 a structure is formed   that is linked at the 3 positions.  Obviously, this dimer would serve as a precursor to other dimer and polymer type structures. The present invention is confined to "monomer" ligands and not the dimer and polymer units linked by a covalent bond as described above.  The term "monomer" as   used herein is used to exclude these products in which covalently linked polyligand type structures are formed.<br>
The Detergent Composition<br>
The bleach catalyst and may be used in a detergent<br>
15  composition specifically suited for stain bleaching purposes, and this constitutes a second aspect of the invention. To that extent, the composition comprises a surfactant and optionally other conventional detergent ingredients. The invention in its second aspect provides an<br>
20  enzymatic detergent composition which comprises from 0.1 -<br>
50 % by weight, based on the total detergent composition, of one or more surfactants. This surfactant system may in turn comprise 0 - 95 % by weight of one or more anionic surfactants and 5 to 100 % by weight of one or more nonionic<br>
25  surfactants. The surfactant system may additionally contain amphoteric or zwitterionic detergent compounds, but this in<br><br>

not normally desired owing to their relatively high cost. The enzymatic detergent composition according to the invention will generally be used as a dilution in water of about 0.05 to 2%. <br>
5<br>
The condition of "the balance carriers and adjunct ingredients" should be taken to be at least 1% wt/wt of a surfactant, preferably at least 5% wt/wt. Suitable carriers may be selected from water, fillers and builders.<br>
10<br>
In general, the nonionic and anionic surfactants of the surfactant system may be chosen from the surfactants described "Surface Active Agents" Vol. 1, by Schwartz &amp; Perry, Interscience 1949, Vol. 2 by Schwartz, Perry &amp; Berch,<br>
15  Interscience 1958, in the current edition of "McCutcheon1s Emulsifiers and Detergents" published by Manufacturing Confectioners Company or in "Tenside-Taschenbuch", H. Stache, 2nd Edn., Carl Hauser Verlag, 1981.<br>
20  Suitable nonionic detergent compounds which may be used<br>
include, in particular, the reaction products of compounds having a hydrophobic group and a reactive hydrogen atom, for example, aliphatic alcohols, acids, amides or alkyl phenols with alkylene oxides, especially ethylene oxide either alone<br>
25  or with propylene oxide. Specific nonionic detergent<br>
compounds are Cg-C22 alkyl phenol-ethylene oxide condensates, generally 5 to 25 EO, i.e. 5 to 25 units of ethylene oxide per molecule, and the condensation products of aliphatic C8~ C18 primary or secondary linear or branched alcohols with<br>
30  ethylene oxide, generally 5 to 40 EO.<br><br>
WO 2005/049778<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/011680<br><br>
-  24   -<br>
Suitable anionic detergent compounds which may be used are usually water-soluble alkali metal salts of organic sulphates and sulphonates having alkyl radicals containing from about 8 to about 22 carbon atoms, the term alkyl being  used to include the alkyl portion of higher acyl radicals. Examples of suitable synthetic anionic detergent compounds are sodium and potassium alkyl sulphates, especially those obtained by sulphating higher Cs-Cie alcohols, produced for example from tallow or coconut oil, sodium and potassium<br>
10  alkyl C9-C20 benzene sulphonates, particularly sodium linear secondary alkyl C10-C15 benzene sulphonates; and sodium alkyl glyceryl ether sulphates, especially those ethers of the higher alcohols derived from tallow or coconut oil and synthetic alcohols derived from petroleum. The preferred<br>
15  anionic detergent compounds are sodium Cn-C15 alkyl benzene sulphonates and sodium C12-C18 alkyl sulphates. Also applicable are surfactants such as those described in EP-A-328 177 (Unilever), which show resistance to salting-out, the alkyl polyglycoside surfactants described<br>
20  in EP-A-070 074, and alkyl monoglycosides.<br>
Preferred surfactant systems are mixtures of anionic with nonionic detergent active materials, in particular the groups and examples of anionic and nonionic surfactants   pointed out in EP-A-346 995 (Unilever) .' Especially preferred is surfactant system that is a mixture of an alkali metal salt of a Cis-Cis primary alcohol sulphate together with a C12-C15 primary alcohol 3-7 EO ethoxylate.<br>
30  The nonionic detergent is preferably present in amounts greater than 10%, e.g. 25-90% by weight of the surfactant<br><br>

5  The detergent composition may take any suitable physical form, such as a powder, granular composition, tablets, a paste or an anhydrous gel.<br>
    PER0XY6EN BLEACH OR SOURCE THEREOF <br>
In a peroxyl bleaching mode the composition of the present   invention uses a peroxyl species to bleach a substrate. The peroxy bleaching species may be a compound which is capable of yielding hydrogen peroxide in aqueous solution. Hydrogen peroxide sources are well known in the art. They include the   alkali metal peroxides, organic peroxides such as urea<br>
peroxide, and inorganic persalts, such as the alkali metal perborates, percarbonates, perphosphates persilicates and persulphates. Mixtures of two or more such compounds may also be suitable.<br>
20<br>
Particularly preferred are sodium perborate tetrahydrate and, especially, sodium perborate monohydrate. Sodium perborate monohydrate is preferred because of its high active oxygen content. Sodium percarbonate may also be<br>
25  preferred for environmental reasons. The amount thereof in the composition of the invention usually will be within the range of about 1-35% by weight, preferably from 5-25% by weight.  One skilled in the art will appreciate that these amounts may be reduced in the presence of a bleach precursor<br>
30  e.g., N,N,N'N'-tetraacetyl ethylene diamine (TAED).<br><br>

Another suitable hydrogen peroxide generating system is a combination of a C1-C4 alkanol oxidase and a C1-C4 aikanol, especially a combination of methanol oxidase (MOX) and ethanol. Such combinations are disclosed in International   Application PCT/EP 94/03003 (Unilever), which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Alkylhydroxy peroxides are another class of peroxy bleaching compounds. Examples of these materials include cumene   hydroperoxide and t-butyl hydroperoxide.<br>

Also inorganic peroxyacid compounds are suitable, such as for example potassium monopersulphate (MPS). If organic or inorganic peroxyacids are used as the peroxygen compound,  the amount thereof will normally be within the range of about 2-10% by weight, preferably from 4-8% by weight.<br>
Peroxyacid bleach precursors are known and amply described in literature, such as in the British Patents 836988;<br>
25  864,798; 907,356; 1,003,310 and 1,519,351; German Patent 3,337,921; EP-A-0185522; EP-A-0174132; EP-A-0120591; and U.S. Pat. Nos. 1,246,339; 3,332,882; 4,128,494; 4,412,934 and 4,675,393. Another useful class of peroxyacid bleach precursors is that of the cationic i.e. quaternary ammonium<br>
