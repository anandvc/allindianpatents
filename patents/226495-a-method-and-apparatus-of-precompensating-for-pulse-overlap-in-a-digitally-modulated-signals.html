				<td>"A METHOD AND APPARATUS OF PRECOMPENSATING FOR<br>
PULSE OVERLAP IN A DIGITALLY MODULATED SIGNALS"<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a method and apparatus of precompensating for pulse overlap in a<br>
digitally modulated signals, in radio broadcasting, and more particularly, to AM In-Band-On-<br>
Channel (IBOC) Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB), and signal processing in AM IBOC DAB<br>
transmitters.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTTION<br>
Digital Audio Broadcasting is a medium for providing digital-quality audio, superior of existing<br>
analog broadcasting formats. AM IBOC DAB can be transmitted in a hybrid format where it<br>
coexists with the AM signal, or it can be transmitted in an all-digital format where the removal of<br>
the analog signal enables improved digital coverage with reduced interference. IBOC requires no<br>
new spectral allocations because each DAB signal is simultaneously transmitted within the same<br>
spectral mask of an existing AM channel allocation. IBOC promotes economy of spectrum while<br>
enabling broadcasters to supply digital quality audio to their present base of listeners.<br>
U.S. Pat. No. 5,588,022 discloses a hybrid AM IBOC broadcasting method for simultaneously<br>
broadcasting analog and digital signals in a standard AM broadcasting channel that includes the<br>
steps of broadcasting an amplitude modulated radio frequency signal having a first frequency<br>
spectrum, wherein the amplitude modulated radio frequency signal includes a first carrier<br>
modulated by an analog program signal, and simultaneously broadcasting a plurality of digitally<br>
modulated carrier signals within a bandwidth which encompasses the first frequency spectrum,<br>
each of the digitally modulated carrier signals being modulated by a portion of a digital program<br>
signal, A first group of the digitally modulated carrier signals lie within the first frequency<br>
spectrum and are modulated in-quadrature with the first carrier signal. Second and third groups<br>
of the digitally modulated carrier signals lie outside of the first frequency spectrum and are<br>
modulated both in-phase and in-quadrature with the first carrier signal.<br>
In AM IBOC DAB systems, frequency domain side lobe constraints together with symbol rate and<br>
sub-carner spacing requirements can lead to signal pulse trains with overlapping pulses. The AM<br>
transmission comprises a train of orthogonal frequency division multiplexed (OFDM) pulses. The<br>
pulses are made up of evenly spaced sub-carriers. The digitized data is subdivided<br>
into "M" bit words converted to amplitude and phase values and then assigned to the<br>
sub-carners. The shape of the pulses is selected so that the sub-carriers are<br>
orthogonal to one another when matched filtering is applied at the receiver. In this way,<br><br>
matched filtering can recover the amplitude and phase information for each individual sub-<br>
carrier and thereby recover the value of each digital word.<br>
One way of ensuring the required orthogonality is to use rectangular pulses<br>
whose duration is the reciprocal of the sub-carrier spacing. The use of non-overlapping<br>
rectangular pulses has the desirable feature of maximizing the transmission rate. The main<br>
drawback, however, is excessive side lobe levels. Moreover, achieving the desired<br>
orthogonality requires exact frequency centering.<br>
The problem of preserving orthogonality while reducing side lobe levels has a<br>
time domain dual that was the subject of a classic paper by Nyquist (Nyquist, H., "Certain<br>
Topics in Telegraph Transmission Theory," Trans. Am. Inst. Electr. Eng., vol 47, Apr. 1928,<br>
pp 617-644). The solution is to extend the length of the rectangular pulse and apply a raised<br>
cosine weighting to the result. The transmitter and receiver split the weighting with the<br>
transmitter and receiver each applying the square root of the weights.<br>
The waveform used in one AM digital audio broadcasting system is the<br>
convolution of a Nyquist type pulse with the Gaussian density function. This construction<br>
gua; antees that the frequency domain side-lobes meet spectral mask requirements imposed by<br>
the FCC. The length of the Nyquist pulse is one OFDM symbol period. Convolution<br>
increases the pulse length. As a result, the pulses in the transmitted pulse train overlap. The<br>
presence of this overlap introduces distortion in the output of the demodulator.<br>
The distortion caused by pulse overlap has an effect similar to that of noise;<br>
i.e. demodulator outputs are displaced from their assigned constellation locations. When a<br>
largo number of demodulator outputs are superimposed on a graph, they give a fuzz-like<br>
appearance to the demodulated signal constellation.<br>
It would be desirable to reduce distortion caused by pulse overlap. This<br>
invention seeks to provide a method for pre-compensating signal pulses of an AM IBOC<br>
digital audio broadcasting system to reduce distortion.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention provides a method of pre-compensating at the transmitter for<br>
puLse overlap in a digitally modulated signal comprising the steps of receiving a sequence of<br>
pulses, modulating the pulses to produce a first sequence of modulated pulses, demodulating<br>
the first sequence of modulated pulses to produce a first sequence of demodulated pulses,<br>
con bining the first sequence of demodulated pulses with the first sequence of pulses to<br>
produce a first sequence of error pulses, modulating the first sequence of error pulses to<br><br>
produce a first sequence of modulated error pulses, and combining the first sequence of<br>
modulated error pulses with the first sequence of modulated pulses to produce a first<br>
sequence of compensated pulses.<br>
The invention further encompasses a method of pre-compensating for pulse<br>
overlap in a digitally modulated signal comprising the steps of receiving a sequence of<br>
pulses, modulating the pulses to produce a sequence of modulated pulses, storing the<br>
modulated pulses, using non-consecutive pairs of the modulated pulses to produce a<br>
sequence of error first order terms, storing the sequence of first order error terms, and<br>
subtracting each of the first order error terms from corresponding ones of the modulated<br>
pulses to produce a first compensated signal.<br>
Transmitters that process signals in accordance with the above methods are<br>
also included.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the drawings, Figure 1 is a schematic representation of an AM <br>
hybrid IBOC DAB composite signal 10, showing relative levels of the analog modulated AM<br>
and digitally modulated DAB signals. The hybrid format includes the conventional AM<br>
analog signal 12 along with a DAB signal 14 transmitted beneath the AM signal. The DAB<br>
signal includes a plurality of data carriers, evenly spaced in frequency. The digitally<br>
modulated carriers are generated via orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM).<br>
This format enables the spectra of these carriers to be overlapped without any intervening<br>
guard bands, thereby optimizing spectral utilization. However, a guard interval can be used in<br>
the tine domain to compensate for signal timing jitter. The OFDM modulation technique is<br>
extremely beneficial for successful DAB operation since bandwidth is a premium commodity<br>
in the AM band. An additional advantage is that there is no need to isolate the DAB digital<br><br>
carriers from each other via filtering in either the transmitter or receiver since the<br>
orthogonality condition of OFDM minimizes such interference.<br>
As shown in Figure 1, the DAB carriers are contained within a channel 16<br>
having a bandwidth of 30 kHz. The channel is divided into a central frequency band 18, and<br>
upper 20 and lower 22 frequency bands. The central frequency band is about 10 kHz wide<br>
and encompasses frequencies lying within ± 5 kHz of the central frequency of the channel.<br>
The: upper sideband extends from about +5 kHz from the central frequency to about + 15 kHz<br>
from the central frequency. The lower sideband extends from about -5 kHz from the central<br>
frequency to about -15 kHz from the central frequency. The FCC emissions mask is<br>
represented by item number 24.<br>
The composite analog and digital DAB waveform includes a plurality of<br>
modulated earners that are fully compliant with the FCC emissions mask. A first group of<br>
the digitally modulated carriers are positioned within a frequency band illustrated by the<br>
envelope labeled 14 in Figure 1. Most of these signals are placed 30 to 40 dB lower than the<br>
level of the unmodulated AM carrier signal in order to minimize crosstalk with the analog<br>
AM signal. Crosstalk is fortherreduced by encoding this digital information in a manner that<br>
guarantees orthogonality with the analog AM waveform. This type of encoding is called<br>
complementary modulation (i.e. complementary BPSK, complementary QPSK, or<br>
complementary 16 QAM) and is more fully described United States Patent No. 5,859,876.<br>
Additional groups of quadrature amplitude modulated digital signals are<br>
placed outside the first group. The need for these digital waveforms to be in-quadrature with<br>
the analog signal is eliminated by restricting the analog AM signal bandwidth. United States<br>
Patent No. 5,588,022 discloses additional information relating to IBOC DAB waveforms and<br>
is hereby incorporated, by reference.<br>
Figure 2 is a block diagram of a portion of an AM IBOC DAB transmitter 30<br>
showing the signal processing functions that are relevant to this invention. A sampled audio<br>
signal is received on line 32. An audio encoder 34 converts the sampled audio into a digital<br>
signal. This digital signal is subjected to forward error correction as illustrated in FEC<br>
encoder block 36. The FEC signal is interleaved, as shown by interleaver block 38. The<br>
resulting interleaved signal is modulated by a Fast Fourier Transform modulator 40 to<br>
produce the DAB signal on line 42. To produce (he analog signal on line 46, a sampled audio<br>
signal is supplied by source 48. The analog signal on line 46 and the digital signal on line 42<br>
are c ombined in summation point 50 to produce the composite signal on line 52, that is<br><br>
subsequently modulated by AM modulator 54 and ultimately delivered to antenna 56. The<br>
signal transmitted by the antenna has the general form shown by the waveform of Figure 1.<br>
In the AM system, frequency domain side lobe constraints together with<br>
symbol rate and sub-carrier spacing requirements lead to pulse trams with overlapping pulses.<br>
Pulse overlap introduces distortion at the output of the receiver demodulator. This distortion<br>
appears as "fuzz" in the demodulated constellations. Figure 3 is functional block diagram<br>
Chat illustrates the operation of the invention. The functions illustrated in Figure 3 can be<br>
performed in combination with the modulator illustrated by block 40 of Figure 2. As shown<br>
in Figure 3, a plurality of OFDM pulses in the frequency domain is received on line 60.<br>
These pulses are modulated as shown in block 62 to produce a first modulated signal on line<br>
64. This produces pulse overlap as illustrated by block 66. The overlapped pulses are<br>
demodulated as shown by block 68 and subtracted from the original pulses in summation<br>
point 70. The resulting first error signal on line 72 is then modulated as shown in block 74<br>
and the second modulated signal on line 76 is subtracted from the first modulated signal at<br>
summation point 78. This results in a first compensated signal on line 80, comprising a<br>
plurality of compensated pulses. Since the compensated pulses will overlap, the demodulator<br>
output will still contain distortion. So the process can be repeated until the distortion reaches<br>
an acceptable level. In Figure 3, one additional demodulation/modulation sequence is shown.<br>
The compensated pulses on line 80 contain overlap as shown by block 82. The compensated<br>
pulses are demodulated as shown by block 84 and subtracted from the original pulses in<br>
summation point 86. The resulting second error signal on line 88 is then modulated as shown<br>
in block 90 and the resulting third modulated signal on line 92 is subtracted from the first<br>
compensated signal at summation point 94. This results in a second compensated signal<br>
output in the time domain that includes a second plurality of pre-compensated pulses on line<br>
f<br>
96. Some level of overlap will still be contained in the pulses on line 96.<br>
The invention takes advantage of the fact that a quantitative value for the<br>
disiortion is available at the transmitter since the train of overlapping pulses can be<br>
demodulated and subtracted from the demodulator input. The error, that is, the difference<br>
between modulator input and demodulator output, can be subtracted from the modulator input<br>
to form a train of pre-compensated pulses.<br>
Rather than implement the computationally intensive procedure described in<br>
Figure 3, the pulse over-lap pre-compensation cJf this invention can be implemented using<br>
formulas that efficiently perform the demodulation function followed by re-modulation.<br><br>
Figure 4 is a functional block diagram that illustrates the operation of the more efficient<br>
approach.<br>
The constellation data corresponding to each OFDM pulse is received on line<br>
100 and modulated as shown by block 102. The inputs to the modulation process are<br>
sequences of complex words. These complex words are restricted to a set of values that form<br>
a lattice in the complex plane. This lattice is often referred to as a constellation.<br>
The bits of the digital bit stream that forms the input to the OFDM system are<br>
assembled into words of fixed length. The word length corresponds to the base 2 log of the<br>
number of points in the constellation. To obtain the complex words that form the input to the<br>
modulation process, the digital words are used as addresses to a table of the constellation<br>
values.<br>
The modulated pulses are entered into a shift register type memory 104 that<br>
incsudes a plurality of memory locations 106, 108, 110 and 112. Two non-consecutive<br>
modulated pulses (separated by one pulse) are combined in a process denoted by "UV" in<br>
block 114 of the diagram to produce a plurality of first order error terms on line 116.<br>
The "UV" process is defined below. The first order error terms are also stored<br>
ir, a shift register type memory 118 having a plurality of memory locations 120, 122 and 124.<br>
The UV process is applied again as shown in block 126, this time to the first order error<br>
terms, to obtain a plurality of second order error terms on line 128. The second order error<br>
terms are stored in another shift register type memory 130, having memory locations 132 and<br>
154. This process can be expanded using combinations of higher order errors to derive error<br>
terms of any order.<br>
The first order error terms are summed with the modulator outputs at<br>
summation point 136, and the resulting signal on line 138 is summed with the second order<br>
error terms at summation point 140. The resulting signal on line 142 contains an overlap as<br>
shown by block 144. In the transmitter output, the compensated pulses must overlap since<br>
the compensation process does not reduce the lengths of the individual pulses. The<br>
implementation shown in Figure 4 produces outputs in blocks of 270 samples (the symbol<br>
period). But the pulse length is 349 samples. Therefore, the processing applies the<br>
compensation to all 349 samples of the current pulse. It then adds the first 79 samples of the<br>
current pulse with the last 79 samples of the previous compensated pulse and outputs that<br>
sum together with the next 191 samples of the current pulse (after compensation). It then<br><br>
saves the last 79 samples of the current compensated pulse for combining with the next<br>
compensated pulse. The final pre-compensated pulses are output on line 146.<br>
Figure 3 shows why the compensation process affects non-consecutive pulses.<br>
The overlap 66 "simulates" the distortion that occurs when the pulses are assembled into a<br>
pulse train. It is this distortion that the compensation of this invention attempts to remove.<br>
The demodulation 68, differencing 70, and modulation 74 produce the compensation term 76<br>
so that the subtraction 78 produces error free pulses. But the lengths of these pulses still<br>
exceed the symbol period. Therefore, the compensated pulses will overlap one another, when<br>
assembled into a pulse train. The overlap 82 accounts for that overlap and the demodulation<br>
84. differencing 86, modulation 90, and subtraction 94 correct the second source of error, i.e.<br>
the overlap 82 Now the results of the first compensation 66, 68, 70, 74 and 78 produce error<br>
terms that arise from the pulses on either side of a given pulse; i.e. for the n-th pulses, the (n-<br>
l)-1h, n-th and (n+l)-th pulses affect the error term 76. Consequently, the (n-l)-th, n-th and<br>
(n+1 t-th pulses affect the output 80 for the n-th pulse. The overlap 82 combines three<br>
consecutive pulses from the output 80 and therefore is affected, through the error terms 76,<br>
by five consecutive pulses, In this way, the compensation process extends beyond the pulses<br>
on either side of a given pulse.<br>
The algorithm used to perform the functions illustrated in Figure 4 will now be<br>
described in greater detail. The algorithm input is a sequence, {Xn(m)}, of complex valued<br>
constellations where n denotes the pulse number and m is an index that varies from 1 to 256.<br>
For any n, Xn(m) is non-zero only for those values of m, which correspond to an active sub-<br>
carrier including the BPSK and IDS sub-carriers. The table below, lists the indices of the<br>
active sub-carriers. As indicated in that table, the number and location of the active sub-<br>
carrier s is mode dependent. The main carrier is inserted later in the transmitter processing<br>
sequence.<br>
The outputs of the algorithm are 270 sample pulses, which, when<br>
concatenated, form a tram of overlap pre-compensated pulses. Each of these algorithm<br>
output pulses begins with the 79 sample overlapped portion of two consecutive pre-<br>
compensated pulses. The remaining 191 samples of the algorithm output are the un-<br>
overlapped portion of the second of the two pre-eompensated pulses. To be more precise, if<br>
xn(k), 1 =1,2,...,349 denotes the n-th overlap pre-compensated pulse, then the corresponding<br>
algorithm output is:<br><br><br>
The algorithm repeats at the OFDM symbol rate,<br>
1488375/32/270=11025/64~172.266 Hz.<br>
The average effective output rate is the AM sample rate: (11025/64)-270 ~<br>
465 12 Hz.<br>
The processing begins with OFDM modulation. The modulator output, xn(0),<br>
is given by:<br><br>
where Xn(m) denotes the complex constellation points and w(k), k=T,2,...,349, are the terms<br>
of the root raised cosine window.<br>
The pre-distorted pulse, xn, is given by<br><br>
where the terms, en(r) , are 349 point column vectors defined next.<br>
For any integer r ≥ 1, define the r-th error term for the n-th pulse, en(r), as<br>
follows:<br><br><br><br>
where U and V are 349 by 349 matrices and xn+1(0) and xn-1(0) are interpreted as column<br>
vectors. The matrices U and V are defined by<br><br><br>
Modulator inputs that do not correspond to active sub-carriers are set to zero.<br>
The following table shows the modulator inputs that contain non-zero data together with the<br>
relationship between modulator input number and sub-carrier index relative to the position of<br>
the main carrier.<br><br>
The above process can be performed in an apparatus for pre-compensating for<br>
pulse overlap in a digitally modulated orthogonal frequency multiplexed signal, the device<br>
comprising an input receiving a sequence of pulses, a first modulator for modulating the<br>
pulses to produce a first sequence of modulated pulses, a first demodulator for demodulating<br>

of pulses to produce a first sequence of error pulses, a second modulator for modulating the<br>
first sequence of error pulses to produce a first sequence of modulated error pulses, and a<br>
second combiner for combining the first sequence of modulated error pulses with the first<br>
sequence of mooulated pulses to produce a first sequence of compensated pulses.<br>
The apparatus can further comprise a second demodulator for demodulating<br>
the first sequence of compensated pulses to produce a second sequence of demodulated<br>
pulses, a third combiner for cornbining the second sequence of demodulated pulses with the<br>
first sequence of pulses to produce a second sequence of error pulses, a third modulator for<br>
modulating the second sequence of error pulses to produce a second sequence of modulated<br><br>
error pulses, a fourth combiner for combining the second sequence of modulated error pulses<br>
with the first sequence of compensated pulses to produce a second sequence of compensated<br>
pulses.<br>
The invention further encompasses an apparatus for pre-compensating for<br>
pulse overlap in a digitally modulated orthogonal frequency multiplexed signal comprising an<br>
input for receiving a sequence of pulses, a first modulator for modulating the pulses to<br>
produce a sequence of modulated pulses, a first storage element for storing the modulated<br>
pulses, a first combiner for using non-consecutive pairs of the modulated pulses to produce a<br>
