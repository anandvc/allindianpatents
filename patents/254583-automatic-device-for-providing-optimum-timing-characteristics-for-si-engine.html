FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to Automobile Industry. More particularly this invention relates to ignition timing characteristics of SI engine. The present invention relates to an  Automatic device for providing an optimum ignition timing characteristics for SI engine <br>
PRIOR ART<br>
Normally in any two stroke or four stroke vehicles, in order to get optimum performance  the engine has to attain stabilized temperature, which normally is attained after running the vehicle for a few minutes depending upon the ambient conditions. During this period of running, lot of fuel will be consumed causing resource depletion. Exhaust emissions are also very high during this period causing environmental pollution. By optimizing the ignition timing the engine gets heated up fast, but maintaining the same ignition timing continuously will cause serious problems like seizure, knocking etc causing reliability problems to the engine.<br>
SUMMARY OF INVENTION<br>

Automatic device for providing an optimum ignition timing characteristics for SI engine a said device for a four cycle SI engine which automatically provides optimum ignition timing to the engine that will speed up the process of heating up the engine within a short time thereby enabling the vehicle to perform to the desired performance, such that the said device will operate only when the temperature of the engine oil is less than a predetermined value.<br>
Referring now to drawing, where like numerals designate identical or corresponding parts throughout the referred views.<br>
This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawing which illustrate, by way of example and not by way of limitation, the circuitry and layout diagram of one of various possible embodiments of this invention.<br>
Figure 1 illustrating a layout diagram of the said embodiment.<br><br>
Details description of an embodiment of invention.<br>
Sensor means are provided for sensing the rpm of the engine. One of the possible forms the sensor means can be taken is the pulsar coil or charging coil P of the magneto A. The output of the pulsar coil or charging coil is directly related to the rpm of the engine. In the following description reference is made only to the pulsar coil for the sake of brevity.<br>
The output signal from the pulsar coil is fed to a micro controller M. Linear potentiometer means are provided for the throttle of the engine and these means are symbolically represented by the potentiometer T. By "linear potentiometer means" is meant any known potentiometer means provided with sliding contacts of which at least one contact is movable, not only maintaining such means always in the ON condition, but also enabling the position of the moving contact to be determined.<br>
The said potentiometer T is connected to the micro controller M and feeds signal proportional to the throttle position to micro controller M. A temperature sensor TS is provided to the engine oil sump senses the temperature of the engine oil at a specific point gives a voltage proportional to the temperature. The voltage signal required is fed to the micro controller M. The output signal of the micro controller M is fed to the GDI unit (Capacitor Discharge Ignition unit) C. The GDI unit G which is operatively connected to the ignition system consisting of a Ignition coil IG and Spark plug S. This GDI unit G is controlling the ignition timing characteristics of the IG engine matching with plurality of curves provided in the GDI unit. The type of ignition cones to be followed is determined by the signal generated by the micro controller M.<br>
The principle of working is as follows:<br>
When the engine is running in the stabilized operating condition, the micro controller compares the value of the temperature sensed by the temperature sensor TS with that of the predetermined temperature value stored in its memory and switches over the GDI. G, to operate to the ignition timing curves which are dependant on the throttle position operated by the potentiometer T.<br><br>
During cold condition which is sensed by the oil temperature sensor TS, if the temperature is less than that of the predetermined temperature stored in the micro controller M, the signal from the micro controller directs the CD! C to operate to the ignition characteristics curve required to warm up the engine quickly by bypassing the throttle operation control potentiometer T. At this condition the engine will warm up quickly and attains the optimum running temperature quickly. Once the temperature of the oil reaches the optimum pre determined temperature, the micro controller M gives the signal to the GDI unit G to operate to any one of the curves which are throttle position dependant.<br>
The invention has been explained in relation to specific embodiment. It is inferred that the foregoing description is only illustrative of the present invention and it is not intended that the invention be limited or restrictive thereto. Many other specific embodiments of the present invention will be apparent to one skilled in the art from the foregoing disclosure. All substitution, alterations and modification of the present invention, which come within the scope of the following claims, are to which the present invention is readily susceptible without departing from the spirit of the invention.<br>
The scope of the invention should therefore be determined not with reference to the above description but should be determined with reference to appended claims along with full scope of equivalents to which such claims are entitled.<br><br><br>
