				<td>NOVEL 1,2,4-TRIA2GLI CGMPQUHD5<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates to a novel 1,2,4-triazole compound which may be substituted at 1, 2 or 4 position with a substituted alkyl group and has aromatic rings at 3 and 5 positions, a hydrate or a salt thereof, a process for production thereof, and a therapeutic agent for gout and hyperuricemia comprising one of these substances as an active ingredient.<br>
Description of the Related Art<br>
The number of patients with hyperuricemia in Japan is reported to be 1.25 million and that suffering from asymptomatic hyperuricemia is estimated to reach several millions. Hyperuricemia is becoming a popular disease.<br>
Presently, hyperuricemia and gout due to hyperuricemia are treated by improving living environment and administering various drug therapies for each period when attack of gout is predicted to occur (presymptomatic period), when attack of gout occurs, or when attack of gout subsides. That is, preventive therapy is conducted in the presymptomatic period by administering colchicines as well as controlling daily living environment. When an attack occurs, drug therapy using non-steroidal or steroidal antiinflammatory agents is mainly conducted. After the attack subsides, patients are given<br><br>
guidance to improve their lifestyle. When improvement is judged insufficient, assessment as to whether hyper uricemia is caused by reduced excretion of uric acid or by increased production of uric acid is made followed by drug therapies with drugs, which exhibit a uricosuric effect, such as probenecid and benzbromarone, those which inhibit resorption of uric acid, such as sulfinpyrazone, those which improve acidurea conditions, such as citrates, xanthine oxidase inhibitors which inhibit production of uric acid, such as allopurinol. Colchicine is said to be able to prevent about 90% of attacks through inhibiting chemotaxis and phagocytosis of leukocytes such as neutrophil if administration thereof has been completed within a few hours before the attack. Since colchicine has various adverse effects, however, the use thereof is limited to the minimum and it is therefore difficult to timely administer it.<br>
Accordingly, drug therapies are mainly adopted, but only allopurinol is available for the treatment of disease caused by increased production of uric acid, and a metabolite of allopurinol, oxypurinol, tends to be accumulated and may cause calculus formation. Furthermore, this drug has been reported to induce adverse events such as rash, a decreased renal function and hepatitis, and is not easy to administer.<br>
Examples of compounds having xanthine oxidase inhibiting activity that can be used for treating gout caused by increased production of uric acid and are effective for hyperuricemia and gout due to hyperuricemia have been described in J.<br><br>
Medicinal Chemistry, 1975, Vol. 18, No. 9, pp. 895-900, Japanese Patent Publication No. 49-46622 and Japanese Patent Publication No. 50-24315, which disclose some 1,3,5-substituted or 3,5-substituted 1,2,4-triazole compounds.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Hyperuricemia and gout caused by hyperuricemia tend to spread even among young people in Japan due to changes in lifestyle and the like and the diseases cannot be dealt with only by guidance aiming at improvement of lifestyle. However, compounds having improved efficacy for these diseases are difficult to obtain and development of novel therapeutic agents has made little progress by now.<br>
An object of the present invention is to provide a novel 1,2,4-triazole compound which has a high xanthine oxidase inhibiting activity and is useful as a therapeutic agent for hyperuricemia and gout due to hyperuricemia caused by increased production of uric acid.<br>
In short, the first invention of the present invention relates to a 1,2,4-triazole compound represented by the following general formula (1): [Chemical 2]<br><br><br>
which may be substituted at 1, 2 or 4 position with a substituted alkyl group and has substituted aromatic rings at 3 and 5 positions, a hydrate or a salt thereof.<br>
The second invention of the present invention relates to a process for production of a 1,2,4-triazole compound represented by the above described general formula {1) in which R3 is hydrogen, characterized in that the process comprises the step of reacting an iminoether of a corresponding aromatic nitrile with a hydrazide of an aromatic carboxylic acid.<br>
The third invention of the present invention relates to a process for production of a 1,2,4-triazole compound represented by the above described general formula (1) in which R3 is a lower alkyl group substituted with a pivaloyloxy group, characterized in that the process comprises the step of reacting a compound represented by the general formula (-1) in which R3 is hydrogen with a halogenated lower alkyl ester of pivalic acid.<br>
The fourth invention of the present invention relates to a therapeutic agent comprising a compound represented by the above described general formula (1) or a hydrate or a salt thereof as an active ingredient.<br>
Under the circumstances that only one xanthine oxidase inhibitor is commercially available, the present inventors aimed at creating a compound having inhibitory activity against xanthine oxidase on hyperuricemia and gout due to hyperuricemia which is caused by increased production of uric acid, and<br><br>
continued researches focusing on 1,2,4-triazole compounds as a basic substance.<br>
As a result, the present inventors have completed each of the above mentioned inventions.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS Hereinafter, the present invention will be specifically described.<br>
First of all, the groups in the above described general formula (1) will be described.<br>
In the above described general formula, R2 represents an unsubstituted pyridyl group or a substituted pyridyl group having a cyano, lower alkyl, halogen, lower alkoxy or lower alkylthio group as a substituent. Ri represents an unsubstituted or substituted pyridyl group which may be substituted with a halogen, cyano or phenyl group, a pyridine-N-oxide group corresponding to these pyridyl groups, a phenyl group substituted with a cyano or nitro group or a phenyl group substituted with, in addition to a cyano or nitro group, a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkoxy group, an N-lower alkyl-piperazino group, a lower alkylthio group, a phenylthio group, or a lower alkylamino group/ provided that Ri is not an unsubstituted pyridyl group, a pyridyl group substituted with a lower alkyl group, or a pyridine-N-oxide group corresponding to these pyridyl groups in the case that R2 is an unsubstituted pyridyl group or a pyridyl group substituted with a lower alkyl group. R3 represents hydrogen<br><br>
or a lower alkyl group substituted with pivaloyloxy group and in each case R3 bonds to one of the nitrogen atoms in the 1,2,4-triazole ring represented by the general formula (1).<br>
In the case that both the substituents at 3 and 5 positions of the compound of the present invention comprise pyndine rings, at least one of them are preferably substituted with a cyano group or halogen, and in the case that one of the substituents at 3 and 5 positions is a phenyl group, the phenyl group may be substituted with a substituted or unsubstituted lower alkoxy group, thioether, a substituted piperaz mo group, a substituted ammo group, etc., but it must be substituted with either a cyano or nitro group.<br>
The compounds of the present invention having these combinations of substituent groups have exhibited a high xanthine oxidase inhibiting activity which cannot have been attained by conventional compounds in an in vivo xanthine oxidase inhibiting test, and thus the present inventors have completed the present invention.<br>
1,2,4-triazole compounds as basic structure of the present invention include the following isomers (A), (B), and (C), and all of these are referred to as 1,2,4-triazole and represented by the general formula (1). Isomer (A) [Chemical 3]<br><br><br>
Isomer (B) [Chemical 4]<br><br><br><br>
Isomer (C) [Chemical 5]<br><br>
The process for production of the compound of the present invention is based on a reaction between an iminoether of a corresponding aromatic nitrile with a hydrazide of an aromatic carboxylic acid.<br>
That is, the process is characterized by reacting -an iminoether represented by the corresponding general formula (2): RiCN with a hydrazide represented by the general formula (3): R2CONHMH2 or reacting an iminoether represented by the corresponding general formula (4): R2CN with a hydrazide represented by the general formula (5): RXCONHNH2.<br>
Iminoethers (esters of an imino acid) produced by reacting an aromatic nitrile with an alcohol under basic condition wherein the alcohol may be, for example, sodium methoxide or sodium ethoxide or alternatively with an alcohol such as methanol or ethanol under acidic condition can be used. Such salts produced under acidic condition can be separated and iminoethers produced under basic condition can be separated<br><br>
as a free compound or may be separated after converted to a salt.<br>
Examples of the solvents usable in the production process of the present compounds include aqueous solvent such as methanol and ethanol, and methanol is preferred. The reaction can proceed at room temperature, but preferably it is conducted under heating in a viewpoint of reaction rate and elimination of water in the reaction. In the case that raethanol is used<br>
as a solvent, temperatures near its boiling point (about 65°C) are preferred, and refluxing condition was adopted in the production examples of the present application. Reaction time can be set freely depending upon the reaction temperature as long as it falls within the range so that side reactions or production of decomposition substances may be suppressed.<br>
In the case that a lower alkyl group substituted with a pxvaloy loxy group is introduced in the compound of the present invention, the reaction can be conducted according to a conventional denydrohalogenation reaction, and is preferably conducted in the presence of a dehydrohalogenation agent such as well-known organic bases and alkalizing agents. The reaction can sufficiently proceed at room temperature and can be conducted in a solvent, an example of which includes dimethylformamide (hereinafter abbreviated as DMF). [Examples]<br>
The compounds and production process according to the present invention and a test method for confirming effectiveness of the compounds and results of the test will<br><br>
be described more specifically by way of examples. These examples disclosed, however, should not be construed for limiting the present invention.<br>

Medicinal Chemistry, (1975) as a control). The blood was collected from the orbital sinus at 6 hours after administeration of the test compound. Each blood sample was allowed to clot for one hour and then centrifuged at 2000xg for 10 minutes to obtain serum. The uric acid level in the serum was determined using a kit (Wako Pure Chemicals Industries, Ltd.; phosphotungstic acid method) and a reduction rate of serum uric acid level was calculated by the following formula:<br>
Reduction rate of serum uric acid level = (1-Average serum uric acid level in the group receiving a test compound/Average serum uric acid level in the group receiving MC) x 100<br><br>
