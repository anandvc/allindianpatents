Monoazoquinolone pigments, process for their preparation and their use<br>
The present invention relates to novel monoazoquinolone pigments, to a process for their preparation, and to their use as colourants, especially for colouring high molecular weight material.<br>
Monoazoquinolone pigments are known. For example, US-A-3 119 808 discloses monoazo¬quinolone pigments containing neither sulfonic acid groups nor carboxylic acid groups at the coupling component.<br>
The ever greater demands made of the quality of colourations, for example the fastness properties, or of application-related properties, for example the migration behaviour or the oversprayability, have resulted in there still being a need for new pigments that exhibit improved properties, especially with regard to fastness properties.<br>
Accordingly, the object underlying the present invention is to find novel, improved monoazo¬quinolone pigments, especially for producing surface coatings, printing inks and colour filters or for the colouring of plastics, which pigments possess the above-characterised qualities to a high degree. The novel pigments should yield colourations having a high purity of shade, high tinctorial strength, and good fastness to overspraying and migration. The resulting colourations should especially exhibit good fastness to heat, light and weathering.<br>
It has been found that the stated object is largely achieved with the novel monoazoquinolone pigments defined hereinbelow.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates to monoazoquinolone pigments which, in one of the tautomeric forms thereof, correspond to the formula<br>

Ar is particularly preferably a radical of formula (2a), (2b) or (2d), preferably of formula (2a)<br>

The present invention relates also to a process for the preparation of monoazoquinolone pigments of formula (1), wherein a compound of the formula<br>
  (3) is diazotised and coupled to a compound of the formula<br>
  (4)<br>
wherein Ar has the definitions and preferred meanings mentioned above.<br>
The diazotisation of the compound of formula (3) is carried out, for example, using a nitrite, for example using an alkali metal nitrite, such as sodium nitrite, in a mineral-acid medium, for example in a hydrochloric acid medium, at temperatures of, for example, from -5 to 40°C and preferably at from -5 to 10°C.<br><br>
The coupling to the coupling component of formula (4) is carried out in a manner known per se at acid, neutral to weakly alkaline pH values, for example at a pH value of from 1 to 10, and at temperatures of, for example, from -5 to 40°C, preferably from 0 to 30°C.<br>
The process according to the invention is advantageously carried out by slowly adding a freshly prepared solution or suspension of the diazotised compound of formula (3) to a weakly acid to neutral solution or suspension of the acetoacetanilide coupling component of formula (4), the pH being maintained in the neutral range, for example at pH 4.5 to 8, by addition of an aqueous alkali hydroxide solution, for example a sodium hydroxide solution, subsequently stirring the resulting pigment suspension until the reaction is complete, and isolating the product by filtration.<br>
The compound of formula (3) is known and can be obtained, for example, according to the process described in US-A-3 119 808. The compounds of formula (4) are known or can be obtained by processes known per se.<br>
The monoazoquinolone pigments of formula (1) according to the invention are suitable as colourants for colouring high molecular weight material.<br>
The high molecular weight material can be organic or inorganic and may be a synthetic and/or natural material. It may be, for example, natural resins or drying oils, rubber or casein, or modified natural materials such as chlorinated rubber, oil-modified alkyd resins, viscose, cellulose ethers or esters, such as ethyl cellulose, cellulose acetate, propionate or butyrate, cellulose acetobutyrate as well as nitrocellulose, but especially totally synthetic organic polymers (thermosetting plastics and thermoplastics), as can be obtained by polymerisation, for example by polycondensation or polyaddition. The polymer class includes, for example, polyolefins, such as polyethylene, polypropylene, polyisobutylene, also substituted poly-olefins, such as polymerisation products of monomers such as vinyl chloride, vinyl acetate, styrene, acrylonitrile, acrylic acid esters, methacrylic acid esters; fluoropolymers, for example polyfluoroethylene, polytrifluorochloroethyiene or tetrafluoroethytene/hexafluoropropyiene mixed polymers, as well as copolymers of the mentioned monomers, especially ABS (acrylonitrile/butadiene/styrene) or EVA (ethylene/vinyl acetate). From the group of the polyaddition and polycondensation resins it is possible to use, for example, condensation products of formaldehyde with phenols, the so-called phenoplasts, and condensation<br><br>
products of formaldehyde and urea or thiourea, and also melamine, the so-called amino-plasts, also the polyesters used as surface-coating resins, either saturated, such as alkyd resins, or unsaturated, such as maleic resins, also linear polyesters, polyamides, poly-urethanes, polycarbonates, polyphenylene oxides or silicones, and silicone resins.<br>
The mentioned high molecular weight compounds may be present individually or in mixtures, in the form of plastic compositions or melts, which may optionally be spun to form fibres.<br>
They may also be present in the form of their monomers or in the polymerised state in dissolved form as film-forming agents or binders for surface coatings, paints or printing inks, such as boiled linseed oil, nitrocellulose, alkyd resins, melamine resins, urea-formaldehyde resins or acrylic resins.<br>
Pigmenting of the high molecular weight organic materials with the monoazoquinolone pigments according to the invention is carried out, for example, by adding such a pigment, optionally in the form of a masterbatch, to the substrates using rolling mills, mixing or grinding apparatuses. The pigmented material is then generally brought into the desired final form by methods known perse, such as calendering, compression moulding, extrusion, spread-coating, casting or by injection moulding. It is often desirable, in order to produce non-rigid mouldings or to reduce their brittleness, to incorporate so-called plasticisers into the high molecular weight compounds before they are shaped. There may be used as plasticisers, for example, esters of phosphoric acid, phthalic acid or sebacic acid. The plasticisers may be incorporated in the process according to the invention before or after the incorporation of the pigment colourant into the polymers. It is also possible, in order to achieve different shades of colour, to add to the high molecular weight organic materials, in addition to the monoazoquinolone pigments of formula (1), also fillers or other constituents imparting colour, such as white, coloured or black pigments as well as special-effect pigments, in each case in the desired amount.<br>
For the pigmenting of surface coatings and printing inks, the high molecular weight organic materials and the monoazoquinolone pigments of formula (1), optionally together with additives such as fillers, other pigments, for example TiOz, siccatives or plasticisers, are generally finely dispersed or dissolved in an organic and/or aqueous solvent or solvent mixture. The procedure may be such that the individual components are dispersed or<br><br>
dissolved separately or several are dispersed or dissolved together, and only then are all the components combined.<br>
Based on the high molecular weight material to be pigmented, the monoazoquinolone pigments according to the invention can be used in an amount of from 0.01 to 30 % by weight, preferably from 0.1 to 10 % by weight.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention relates also to the use of the monoazoquinolone pigments of formula (1) according to the invention in the colouring of high molecular weight material, especially organic high molecular weight material, which includes the use as a colourant for plastics in any form, for example in the form of fibres, surface coatings or printing inks.<br>
The monoazoquinolone pigments of formula (1) according to the invention are especially suitable for the colouring, in the mass, of polyvinyl chloride and, especially, polyolefins, such as polyethylene and polypropylene, as well as of aqueous and/or solvent-based lacquers, for example automotive lacquers, also powder coatings, printing inks and paints.<br>
The resulting colourants, for example in plastics, fibres, surface coatings or prints, are distinguished by a high purity of shade, high tinctorial strength, good fastness to over-spraying and migration, and especially by good fastness to heat, light and weathering, for example in full-shade or reduction with white applications.<br>
The monoazoquinolone pigments of formula (1) according to the invention are further distinguished by good dispersibility, good rheological behaviour and a high gloss of the colourants obtained therewith.<br>
It is assumed that the advantageous properties of the pigments according to the invention are attributable to the specific choice of substituents and the substitution pattern at the phenyl radical Ar.<br>
The monoazoquinolone pigments of formula (1) according to the invention are also suitable as colourants for the production of colour filters, especially for visible light in the range from 400 to 700 nm, for liquid crystal displays (LCD) or charge combined devices (CCD). The monoazoquinolone pigments of formula (1) can be used alone or in combination with suitable red, blue and/or green pigments.<br><br>
The production of colour filters by the sequential application of a red, blue and green pigment to a suitable substrate, for example amorphous silicon, is described in GB-A 2 182 165. The colour filters can be coated, for example, using inks, especially printing inks, comprising the monoazoquinolone pigments according to the invention, or, for example, by mixing the monoazoquinolone pigments according to the invention with chemically, thermally or photolytically structurable high molecular weight material. The further production can be carried out, for example, analogously to EP-A 654 711 by application to a substrate, such as an LCD, subsequent photostructuring and development. A further document which describes the production of colour filters is US-A-5 624 467.<br>
The colour filters produced with the pigments according to the invention for liquid crystal displays (LCD) exhibit an improved transmission window between 500 and 600 nm in comparison with colour filters known hitherto, and they are therefore distinguished by high transmission of the green colour points. The colour filters produced with the pigments accor¬ding to the invention have increased absorption at 400 nm in comparison with the colour filters known hitherto, which advantageously yields a more yellowish green.<br>
The Examples which follow serve to illustrate the invention.<br>
Example 1: 28 ml of 37 % hydrochloric acid are added dropwise, with stirring, at 5°C, to a suspension of 120 ml of glacial acetic acid, 200 ml of water and 16.68 g of 7-amino-6-chloro-4-methylquinolin-2-one (80 mmol). 20 ml (80 mmol) of an aqueous 4N sodium nitrite solution are then added dropwise at that temperature to the greenish-white suspension, and stirring is carried out for 90 minutes, during which the suspension slowly changes into a golden yellow solution. The cold solution is clarified by filtration over a glass frit, the residue is washed with 2 x 30 ml of water, and the collected filtrate is transferred to a dropping funnel containing lOO g of ice.<br>
16.56 g (80 mmol) of acetoacet-2-anisidide are dissolved in 200 ml of water with addition of 10 ml (100 mmol) of 30 % aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The colourless solution is clarified by filtration, and the anisidide is then freshly precipitated with 30 % aqueous acetic acid solution with vigorous stirring, and the resulting white suspension is adjusted to pH 4.5.<br><br>
The ice-cold, golden yellow solution of the diazonium salt is added dropwise in the course of 30 minutes, with vigorous stirring, to the suspension of acetoacet-2-anisidide, which has been adjusted to a temperature of from 5 to 10°C. pH balancing is effected by means of the simultaneous addition of 30 % aqueous sodium hydroxide solution. The golden yellow pigment suspension is first stirred for 30 minutes at from 5 to 10°C and then heated to 90°C, and the yellow pigment is filtered off while hot, washed with copious amounts of water until neutral and free of salt, and dried for 20 hours at 110°C under a laboratory vacuum. There are obtained 31.5 g (73.8 mmol) of a pigment of the formula<br>
  (101).<br>
which in high molecular weight organic material yields greenish-yellow colourations having very good fastness to weathering.<br>
Examples 2 to 12: Analogously to the procedure described in Example 1 it is possible to obtain the pigments of the formula<br><br>
wherein Ar has the meanings given in Table 1, if an equimolar amount of one of the aceto-acetanilides indicated in Table 1 is used instead of 16.56 g (80 mmol) of acetoacet-2-anisidide. The pigments yield colourations in high molecular weight organic material in the shade indicated in each case and with very good fastness to weathering.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Application Example 1: Use In the colouring, in the mass, of plastics 0.6 g of the pigment obtained according to Example 1 is mixed with 67 g of polyvinyl chloride, 33 g of dioctyl phthalate, 2 g of dibutyltin dilaurate and 2 g of titanium dioxide and processed to a thin film on a roller apparatus for 15 minutes at 160""C. The yellow PVC film so obtained is tinctorially strong and fast to light.<br>
Application Example 2: Use in an alkyd-melamine stoving lacquer A mixture of 460 g of steatite spheres having a diameter of 8 mm, an alkyd lacquer consisting of 58.7 g of alkyd resin "Alkydal F 310 (Bayer AG), 60 % in xylene, 58.7 g of alkyd resin *Alkydal F 32 (Bayer AG), 60 % in xylene. 2.0 g of •Silikonol A (Bayer AG). 1 % in xylene, 4.0 g of n-butanol, 4.0 g of Dowanol, 15 g of xylene, 5.6 g of dispersing agent *Disperbyk D-160 (BYK-Chemie) and also 28.0 g of the pigment prepared according to Example 1 is dispersed in a glass bottle having a twist-off cap for 72 hours on a tumbler.<br><br>
After addition of 24.0 g of the melamine component *Cymel 327 (Cyanamid), 90 % in xylene, dispersion is continued for a further one hour on the tumbler. The steatite spheres are then separated off. The resulting colour lake paste is applied to *Milar transparency films and then stoved for 30 minutes at 130°C (lacquer layer thickness 50 nm). A colouration having excellent coloristic and rheological properties is obtained.<br>
Application Example 3: Preparation of an intaglio/flexographic printing ink 15 g of the pigment from Example 1 20 g of clear lacquer consisting of<br>
20 g of nitrocellulose type A<br>
4 g    of dioctyl phthalate<br>
56 g of ethanol and<br>
20 g of ethyl acetate<br>
and 25 g of ethanol are dispersed for 30 minutes by means of a high-speed stirrer (dissolver at 15 m/s). 40 g of the clear lacquer described above are then added to the batch, and dispersion is carried out for a further 5 minutes with the dissolver. The grinding charge is introduced into a bead mill by means of a pump with coarse filtering, and is finely dispersed therein. Extraordinary transparency/gloss properties are obtained with that printing ink both in intaglio/flexographic printing and in offset printing.<br>
