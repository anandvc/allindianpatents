				<th>Full Text</th>

The present invention relates to a tractor and attachment assembly in which the components of the tractor are not affected while a backhoe is in use.<br>
Conventional tractors are designed mainly to perform agricultural functions such as farming etc. Nowadays, these tractors are also used to carry out other functions such as loading, levelling and digging the ground with the help of loader, dozer and backhoe, respectively. The backhoe is generally attached to the rear end of the tractor and the loader/dozer is generally attached to the front end of the tractor. In the conventional tractor and backhoe assembly, the backhoe is fixedly mounted to the rear end of the tractor housing and the loader/dozer is fixedly mounted to the front end of the tractor housing. Figure 1 shows a tractor to which a backhoe and a dozer are connected in a manner hitherto known. The backhoe is fixedly mounted to the rear housing of the tractor with the help of bolts. The dozer is also fixedly connected to the front end of the tractor.<br>
When the backhoe is in operation, the tractor will be lifted from the ground by the dozer at the front and by the backhoe stabilizer at the rear. The backhoe can be used to excavate soil, dig the ground to lay foundations for buildings. The backhoe can also be used to form trenches for laying pipelines or cables. The backhoe comprises a boom and a bucket. The boom can be rotated 180o and can be moved up and down. The bucket which is attached to one end of the boom can be moved up and down.<br>
Enormous force is generated by the backhoe during its operation.<br>
Since   the backhoe is fixedly mounted to the housing of the tractor, these	<br><br>
forces are directly passed on to the tractor housing and to the other components of the tractor which breaks the tractor components as the forces are of the bending moment forces. Even if a connecting frame is used from one end to the other end of the tractor, since this frame is rigidly mounted through bolts to the tractor housing, again the forces are transferred to the tractor components because generally the connecting frame is made of mild steel whereas the tractor components are made of cast iron. The connecting frame of the backhoe will tend to bend due to the applied forces. These applied forces which are passed to the tractor will tend to bend the housing of the tractor and the other components such as gear box. The tractor housing and its components will not bend to the same extent as that of the backhoe structure, since the elasticity limits of mild steel and cast iron are different. The tractor housing or its components will tend to break when the bending forces generated by the applied forces crosses the elasticity limit of the cast iron. Even if the tractor housing and its components are subjected to bending forces within its own elasticity limit the tractor housing or its components will tend to break over a period of time due to fatigue forces if they are constantly subjected to the bending forces.<br>
US 5000269 relates to a device with a mounting system which facilitates the usage of both backhoe usage and 3 point linkage system on a tractor. However, the mounting system is mounted firmly using bolts without allowing any movement. As rigidly mounted the forces will get transferred into the vehicle body which will in turn affect the vehicle.<br>
US 592 7665 relates to a mounting system to a boom assembly of a construction vehicle wherein the vehicle is rigidly mounted to the boom using boh and adaptor plug. Here again, the forces will get transferred into the vehicle body due to rigid mounting.<br><br>
JP 05-239895 provides a mounting device which shorten the mounting time and eliminates the need for a tool at the time of mounting backhoe to a tractor. The mounting device disclosed in this application will not isolate the tractor from the forces generated by the backhoe during its use.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide an improved tractor and attachment assembly in which the tractor and its components are not damaged while the attachment is in use.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to isolate the tractor and its components from the damaging forces which are generated while operating the attachment.<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a device in which 4 pins are used for attaching any tractor attachment resulting in reduction of damaging forces that acts on the tractor during the attachment usage.<br><br>
Accordingly to the present invention provides a tractor and backhoe assembly comprising a tractor, a backhoe, a lifting arrangement and a connecting frame for connecting the backhoe to the rear end of the tractor and the lifting arrangement to the front end of the tractor, wherein a connecting frame is connected in a rotatable manner at one end of the tractor and in a slidable manner at the other end of the tractor.<br>
With reference to the acompanying drawings in which.<br>
Figure 1 shows a tractor and backhoe assembly according to the prior art.<br>
Figure 2 shows a tractor and backhoe assembly according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows a tractor and backhoe assembly according to a preferred embodiment of the present invention while the backhoe is in use.<br>
Figure 4a is a cross sectional view showing the details of the improved connection at the rear end of the tractor according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 4b is a side view of figure 4a.<br>
Figure 5a is a top view showing the details of the improved connection at the front end of the tractor according to the invention.<br>
Figure 5 b is a side view of the figure 5a.<br>
As shown in figures 2 and 3, a connecting firame (14) is provided for attaching a backhoe (12) to the rear end of a tractor (11) and a dozer (13) to the front end of the tractor. According to a preferred embodiment of the present invention one end of the connecting frame (14) is connected to the housing of the tractor in a rotatable manner with a hinge pin (16) and the<br><br>
other end of the coimecting frame (14) is connected to the tractor in a slidable manner with a sliding pin (17). The details of the rotatable connection are shown in figure 4a and 4b. A plate (23) is firmly bolted to the rear housing or rear wheel axle housing of the tractor or vehicle (11) by bolts (24). The connecting frame (14) is connected to the plate (23) with a hinge pin (16). A corter pin (25) may be provided in the hinge pin (16) for additional safety. The details of slidable cormection are shown in figures 5a and 5b. An intermediate plate (18) is bolted to the tractor through bolts (19). The slidable pin (17) is held in its position by a locking bolt (20). The connecting frame (14) has a slot (26) for allowing the sliding movement of the pin (17). A washer (21) and a nut (22) are fixed to the free end of the pin (17) in such a way to provide the required clearance for the connecting frame (14) to move forward and backward. The sliding pin (17) is retained in the slot provided in the connecting frame (14) by the washer (21) and the nut (22).<br>
When the backhoe of the assembly according to the present invention is in operation, the backhoe stabilizer (15) are pushed down which in tum will lift the rear end of the tractor. The dozer, loader or other lifting arrangement is used to lift the front end of the tractor so that none of the parts of the tractor will be in touch with the ground while the backhoe is in use. During the operation of the backhoe, enormous force will be generated and passed on to the connecting frame. As the connecting frame is connected to the tractor by a rotatable hinge pin at the rear end and by a sliding pin at the front end, these forces are not passed on to the tractor or to its components. The tractor is allowed to move freely due to the connection provided according to the present invention. The tractor and its components are   isolated  from  the  forces applied to the connecting frame so that a tractor<br><br>
components like gear box housing, flywheel housing, engine body, front axial casting etc. are not damaged while backhoe is in use. The forces applied to the connecting frame are passed on to the ground by the stabilizers at the rear and by the lifting arrangement in the front. In the tractor and backhoe assembly of the present invention, the tractor will act as a weight on the connecting frame so that the bending forces and shock load are not transferred to the tractor or its components while the backhoe is in use. Therefore, the tractor components are not subjected to any kind of damaging forces while the backhoe is in use.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with reference to the preferred embodiments, a person skilled in the art will recognise that changes may be made in form and detail without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
