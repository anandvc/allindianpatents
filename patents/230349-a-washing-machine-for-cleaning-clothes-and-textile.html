				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION: This invention relates to improvements in the field of washing<br>
machines for clothes textile and similar items.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION WITH REGARDS TO THE DRAWBACK<br>
ASSOCIATED WITH KNOWN ART: The existing machines are bulkier and use large<br>
ground space. Normally the bathroom is small in size and this machine can not be easily<br>
located in a bathroom. Existing washing machine needs large size of bathroom.<br>
Accordingly these machines are kept in bedrooms, sitting rooms, balconies and other<br>
places. Or the washing machine needs to be transported every time it is used. If the washing<br>
machine is kept anywhere else then a large space is blocked and piping needs to be<br>
extended to the place. There is a difficulty in extending water pipe arrangement to the<br>
location of the washing machine. Manual washing of clothes as per practice or convention<br>
in the household is done in the bathroom. Hence washing of clothes and textiles are more<br>
suited in bathroom due to availability of water and drainage. Most people do not have large<br>
space in their bathroom and they face this space problem.<br>
Existing machines have arrangement of tub or drum which is rotated continuously or<br>
gyrated in to and fro direction requiring high power and consume high amount of electrical<br>
energy. In invention GB1255470 -1971 the speed is developed in steps so as to maintain<br>
balance. The soap or detergent and water or soap solution is to be poured into the machine.<br>
The drum is rotated or gyrated along with clothes and soap solution which cleans the<br>
clothes and textiles due to churning effect. Some of the machines have a system of soap<br>
solution being stationary and clothes in the drum rotating in a perforated tub. Some<br>
machines rotate in forward as well as reverse direction in gyration.<br>
In another invention GB2358642 heated water is injected into cleaning solution to improve<br>
cleaning. In another invention EP0004490 a mechanical arrangement have been devised to<br>
change direction of rotation to improve cleaning.<br>
There are fully automatic machines where many operations are automated with timers and<br>
sensors. These machines because of their number of component tend to be heavy. All the<br><br>
machines are bulkier and heavy and use similar method of rotating the clothes in a soap<br>
solution. The machines have lot of components and are thus heavy. The machines need long<br>
time of operation to clean properly and thus consuming more energy.<br>
None of the device incorporates use of vanes attached to shaft that vibrate in soap solution<br>
containing clothes and textiles for cleaning. None of the device incorporates method of<br>
fixing the device on the wall. All devices use a method of moving, rotating or gyrating<br>
clothes and textiles in the soap solution.<br>
OBJECT OF THE rNVENTION: To solve the above problem, the present invention<br>
provides a washing machine that does not use floor space. Another object of the present<br>
invention is to make the washing machine light in weight. Another object of this invention<br>
is not to rotate or to gyrate the clothes and textiles in the soap solution.<br>
Use of space saving design is characterized by system of fixing the device on to the wall.<br>
Light weight of the device is characterized by use of tubular members and also that the tub<br>
or drum containing soap solution clothes and textiles is not contained in the device.<br>
STATEMENT OF INVENTION: The device, capable of being fixed on to the wall and<br>
which cleans the clothes by means of vanes fixed to a shaft that vibrate in the bucket<br>
containing soap solution, clothes and textiles, is unique.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION: The problem of location and floor space consumption<br>
is overcome by fixing the washing machine to the wall and arrangement for folding the<br>
device to further make it space saving. The washing machine for cleaning clothes and<br>
textile has a clamp for fixing the device to the wall. A horizontal tubular bar hinged at the<br>
clamp also has a hinge at the middle for positioning and folding. At the other end of the<br>
horizontal tubular bar have a motor box attached to it. The motor box has an electric<br>
motor with one end attached to the horizontal bar and at the other end is attached to a<br>
vertical shaft. The motor has a rotating shaft to which has an eccentric wheel which when<br>
rotated creates vibration to the vertical shaft. The vertical shaft attached to the motor also<br><br>
has an extension shaft with vanes. When the motor is rotated and the vertical shaft vibrates<br>
along with the extension shaft. The device has a regulator for regulating the vibration.<br>
Extension shaft with vanes when vibrate inside the tub containing soap solution, clothes<br>
and textiles get cleaned. In this method clothes and textiles are not rotated or gyrated and<br>
thus electrical energy is not used for rotating or gyrating clothes and textiles.<br>
In one form of the invention the device can be modified to exclude the clamp and that the<br>
horizontal bars with hinges being modified to represent a handle for holding in hand and<br>
vertical shaft shortened considerably so that the device is operated as hand held device. In<br>
another form of the invention horizontal bar is smaller without any hinge for<br>
accommodating in a further smaller space. In other form of the invention the motor box<br>
instead of having is the use of motor and an eccentric wheel can be of electro magnetic by<br>
use of solenoids. In another form of the invention the option for vanes for size, shape and<br>
number can be different. In one more form of the invention the option of material of<br>
construction for vertical shafts, extension shaft, horizontal bar, motor box and clamp can<br>
be either galvanized steel or coated steel or stainless steel or plastic.<br>
A BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
The invention is described in the following fashion by way of an example with reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings in which<br>
Fig1- It illustrates the external view of the invention.<br>
Fig2- It depicts the invention in folded position with extension removed.<br>
Fig3- It illustrates the extension shaft and when detatched from the washing machine.<br>
Fig4 -It shows the internal arrangement of the motor box and<br>
Fig 5- It illustrates the invention in one form modified to be held in hand.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION WITH REFERENCE TO<br>
DRAWINGS AND EXAMPLES:<br>
Referring to the drawings in "Fig1" a device for cleaning clothes and textile in accordance<br>
with the invention indicated generally by reference numeral '10'. A device for cleaning<br>
clothes and textile refer '10' consisting a clamp '20' at one end of a horizontal bar '120' for<br>
fixing to the wall and a hinge '125' in between so that the device can be folded with a motor<br>
box '30' at the other end. The clamp '20' has a gasket pasted on the external side and have<br>
hales for fixing on the wall with the help of spring washers, nuts and bolts. The motor '30'<br>
have a vertical shaft '40' to which an extension shaft '50' is attached which has vanes '60'<br>
at the end. The extension shaft '50' can be detached as and when required by an<br>
arrangement of screwing. The extension shaft can be of various sizes and shapes as may be<br>
required for various types of clothes, textile and container. The motor box '30' has internal<br>
component as one motor '70' with an eccentric wheel '80'attached to its rotating shaft '85',<br>
supported at the other end with a bearing '90'. The eccentric wheel rotates over another<br>
bearing '100' supported by the vertical shaft '40'. Vertical shaft is held by an arrangement<br>
of springs '110'. There is a bush '1120' between motor box '30 and the vertical shaft '40'.<br>
When the motor '70' is rotated the vertical shaft '40' will vibrate. The motor box '30' will<br>
have a regulator with switch '130' to regulate the vibration and suitable cable with socket<br>
'140' for incoming power to the motor. However the vibration can be changed with<br>
changing the type of eccentric wheel '80' and the regulator '130'. The motor will be of<br>
suitable voltage and suitable current as required from place to place. Hand held machines<br>
would have handle '150' instead of clamp arrangement.<br><br>
