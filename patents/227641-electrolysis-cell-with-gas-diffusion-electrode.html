				<td>ELECTROLYSIS CELL WITH GAS DIFFUSION ELECTRODE<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Several industrial processes are carried out in electrochemical cells, such as<br>
chlor-alkali electrolysis for the production of gaseous chlorine and caustic soda or<br>
potash, water electrolysis primarily for the production of hydrogen, electrolysis of<br>
salts to obtain the corresponding acids and bases, e.g. caustic soda and sulphuric<br>
acid from sodium sulphate, deposition of metals, among which copper and zinc<br>
are the principal. The physiological problem of all these processes is the electric<br>
energy consumption which usually constitutes a substantial part of the total<br>
production cost. As the electric energy is characterised in all the geographic areas<br>
by a cost with a constant increasing tendency, the importance of reducing its<br>
consumption in the above indicated electrochemical processes is apparent.<br>
The consumption of energy in an electrochemical process depends primarily from<br>
the cell voltage: it is therefore immediately evident the reason of the efforts<br>
directed to the improvement of cell design, with the use of more catalytic<br>
electrodes and with the decrease of the ohmic drops within the cell structure and<br>
in the electrolytes, for instance by decreasing the interelectrodic gap.<br>
In the case of the conventional chlor-alkali process, a solution of sodium chloride,<br>
or less frequently potassium chloride, is supplied to a cell containing an anode,<br>
whereon gaseous chlorine evolves, while at the cathode, hydrogen is evolved with<br>
simultaneous formation of sodium hydroxide (potassium hydroxide in case<br>
potassium chloride is fed). In the most advanced type of cell, the caustic soda<br>
which is present near the cathode is kept separated from the sodium chloride<br>
solution which is fed to the anodic zone by means of a cationic membrane<br>
consisting in a perfluorinated polymer containing negatively charged groups, for<br>
instance sulphonic and/or carboxylic groups. Such membranes are<br>
commercialised by various companies, among whom DuPont/USA, Asahi Glass<br>
and Asahi Chemical/Japan. The design of this kind of cell has been studied in<br><br>
depth and it can be affirmed that the technology is nowadays in an optimal state<br>
as regards the energy consumption. An example of such kind of design is given in<br>
the international patent application WO 98/55670. An analysis of the production<br>
cost of chlorine and caustic soda obtained with this advanced cell types indicates<br>
however that the impact of the energetic consumption is still relevant. This<br>
consideration has generated a series of proposals of further improvement, whose<br>
common element is the use of a gas electrode, specifically a cathode fed with<br>
oxygen (as such or as enriched air, or simply air deprived of its carbon dioxide<br>
content) as a replacement of the hydrogen evolving cathode employed in the<br>
previously discussed technology.<br>
A chlor-alkali electrolysis cell comprising a cathode supplied with oxygen-<br>
containing gas presents an electric energy consumption which is physiologically<br>
much lower than that typical of the conventional technology. The reason for this<br>
matter of fact is first of all of thermodynamic nature since the two cells, the<br>
conventional one and the one comprising the oxygen cathode, are characterised<br>
by different overall reactions:<br><br>
In the practice it is observed that the voltage of a conventional membrane cell<br>
supplied with a current density of 4 kA/m2 is about 3 Volts, while that of a cell<br>
equipped with membrane and oxygen cathode, working at the same operative<br>
conditions, is about 2-2.2 Volts. As it can be seen, an electric energy saving<br>
around 30% is achieved (the missed production of hydrogen, which is normally<br>
exploited as a fuel, is of a secondary importance). At present, there isn't however<br>
any industrial application of electrolysis cells incorporating oxygen cathodes. The<br>
reason for this situation lies in the structure of the oxygen cathode and in the<br>
requirements imposed to the operative conditions to ensure a good overall<br><br>
efficiency. The oxygen cathode, in brief, is made of a porous support, preferably<br>
conductive, whereon a microporous layer formed by an assembly of<br>
electrocatalytic particles mechanically stabilised by means of a binder resistant to<br>
the operative conditions is applied. The layer may comprise a further film also<br>
comprising preferably conductive but non electrocatalytic particles, and a binder.<br>
The porous support may consist in a mesh, a variously perforated sheet, a<br>
carbon/graphite cloth, carbon/graphite paper or sintered materials. An electrode of<br>
such type, with the relevant fabrication procedure, is disclosed in US Patent<br>
4,614,575.<br>
When an electrode as the above mentioned one is employed as oxygen-fed<br>
cathode in the chlor-alkali electrolysis, in a parallel position to the cationic<br>
membrane, in direct contact or with a moderate gap, indicatively 2-3 mm, the<br>
caustic soda produced by the reaction of oxygen on the electrocatalytic particles<br>
must be somehow discharged to avoid progressively filling the microporosity of the<br>
layer. In fact, should this filling take place, the oxygen could not diffuse anymore<br>
through the pores to reach the catalytic particles which act as the reaction sites.<br>
The discharge of the caustic soda formed on the cathode electrocatalytic particles<br>
may occur essentially in two ways, either towards the membrane, in case the<br>
cathode is positioned in parallel to and with a certain gap from the membrane, or<br>
towards the oxygen backspace, from the side opposite to the one facing the<br>
membrane, in case the cathode is in contact with the membrane itself.<br>
In the former case, a film of liquid is formed, 2-3 mm thick as said, which is<br>
normally maintained in circulation upwardly (the cells have vertically disposed<br>
electrodes) for extracting the caustic soda produced by the cells, for withdrawing<br>
the heat naturally produced by the reaction, and finally for controlling the caustic<br>
soda concentration within pre-determined limits, allowing to extend the lifetime of<br>
the ion-exchange membrane. This situation establishes a pressure gradient<br>
between caustic soda and oxygen at the two sides of the cathode that, as a matter<br>
of fact, functions as separating wall. Such gradient can be positive (pressure of<br>
the caustic soda higher than the one of oxygen) and it this case it increases from<br><br>
top to bottom under the effect of the hydraulic head. Conversely, the gradient can<br>
be negative (pressure of oxygen higher than that of caustic soda) and in this case<br>
it decreases from top to bottom, again under the effect of the caustic soda<br>
hydraulic head. With the presently available materials and with the known<br>
fabrication procedures it is possible to obtain cathodes capable of withstanding<br>
pressure differences not greater than about 30 cm (expressed as water column). It<br>
follows that for an optimal functioning of the oxygen cathodes, the cells destined<br>
to house the same cannot have a height exceeding 30 cm. With greater heights,<br>
complete flooding of the cathode occurs with total filling of the porosity by the<br>
caustic soda in case of positive differentials, and a heavy loss of oxygen into the<br>
caustic soda in case of a negative differential. This fact is seriously negative in the<br>
case of electrolysis plants of a certain size, as the total number of cells, each of<br>
small dimensions, should be very high with heavy additional costs for the auxiliary<br>
equipment (electric connections, ducts, pumps). It must be taken into account that<br>
the conventional type industrial cells, that is cells equipped with hydrogen evolving<br>
cathodes, have heights usually comprised in the range of 1-1.5 metres. To<br>
overcome the above described inconvenience, it has been proposed to utilise a<br>
structure whose cathode is spaced apart from the membrane of about 2-3 mm, the<br>
global height is again 1-1.5 metres but the cell is subdivided in a number of sub-<br>
units, each having a height of about 30 cm. This design entails a remarkable<br>
complexity for the connection ducts among the various sub-units, and ultimately<br>
an operating complexity and a cost which are not compatible with the industrial<br>
applications. A further structure is the one disclosed in US Patent 5,693,202. The<br>
design provides that the cell maintain a unitary structure and be equipped with<br>
oxygen cathodes partitioned in strips. The oxygen pressure supplied to each strip<br>
is automatically regulated taking advantage of the caustic soda hydraulic head<br>
through a bubbling system. This kind of cell overcomes the complexity of the<br>
above sub-unit partition design, even though it appears intrinsically complicated as<br>
concerns the need of ensuring the hydraulic and pneumatic sealing of each strip.<br>
Moreover it imposes particular procedures for the shut-downs and start-ups to<br>
avoid the loss of pressure compensation in these transitory phases due to lack of<br>
oxygen feed. An alternative solution is illustrated in Patent Application EP<br><br>
0150018 A1, which is however directed to describe a cell, possibly having an<br>
interposed diaphragm or ion-exchange membrane between anodes and cathodes,<br>
and with a falling film of liquid wetting the electrodes, whereon gas evolving<br>
reactions take place. Thus Patent Application EP 0150018 A1 is not really<br>
directed to solve the previously indicated problems, but rather those associated<br>
with the release of the produced gas bubbles from the reaction liquid in which they<br>
are formed, as in fact it is clearly stated in the initial part of the text. The difficulties<br>
associated with the release of the gas bubbles from liquids give rise essentially<br>
represented by the anodic and cathodic pressure variations, vibrations, harmful for<br>
the ion-exchange membranes, partial blocking of the electrodes under the action<br>
of the adhering bubbles and finally increased ohmic drop, as the electrolyte<br>
electric conductivity is evidently decreased by the presence of gas. It is therefore<br>
clear that, for Patent Application EP 0150018 A1, the fact that the electrodes are<br>
completely covered by a film of liquid, even of variable thickness, is not a problem<br>
of primary relevance as the process under consideration is the formation of gas<br>
bubbles and the release thereof from the liquid phase and not the diffusion of the<br>
gas and its consumption upon the electrode surface (a typical problem, as<br>
previously seen, of oxygen-fed cathodes). A further proposal is disclosed in Patent<br>
Applications EP 1033419 A1 and WO 01/57290 wherein a cell suitable for<br>
membrane chlor-alkali electrolysis equipped with an oxygen cathode at fixed gap<br>
from the membrane is described. The caustic soda is fed in the upper part of the<br>
cell and flows downwards in the gap delimited by membrane and cathode. The<br>
caustic soda flow-rate is in this case very high and in order to limit the same to a<br>
level of practical interest a porous layer is introduced between membrane and<br>
cathode. The oxygen is also fed with some excess in the upper part of the cell and<br>
is discharged from the lower part together with the caustic soda. This device<br>
allows to dynamically cancel the caustic soda hydraulic head, so that the<br>
pressure differential between caustic soda and oxygen can be maintained at very<br>
low and constant levels, achieving ideal operating conditions for the oxygen<br>
cathode. According to EP 1033419 A1 the porous layer is characterised by<br>
hydrophilicity: in practice, plastic materials are therefore excluded, particularly as<br>
regards the perfluorinated plastic materials which on one hand are very well<br><br>
resistant in the reaction environment made aggressive by the presence of<br>
peroxide traces, but on the other hand are highly hydrophobic. Therefore, only the<br>
metals or oxides thereof, typically hydrophilic, can be employed to produce the<br>
porous layers of the invention. Nevertheless such materials, in contact™ with<br>
concentrated hot caustic soda, are characterised by a certain release of metal<br>
ions which are in time absorbed by the ion-exchange membranes with consequent<br>
lessening of performances, in particular in terms of cell voltage and faradaic<br>
efficiency. The sole metal truly immune from these inconveniences is silver, whose<br>
surface results protected in the operating conditions by an impervious and very<br>
scarcely soluble oxide: it is clear however that the extensive use of silver in the<br>
construction of electrolysis cells entails costs which are hardly sustainable from<br>
industrial applications.<br>
In the latter case, that of operation with the oxygen cathode in direct contact with<br>
the membrane, disclosed for instance in US Patent 6,117,286, the only possibility<br>
for caustic soda discharge is toward the gap occupied by the oxygen, on the side<br>
of the cathode opposed to the one facing the membrane. In this case a series of<br>
problems arises, as listed below:<br>
The caustic soda that is forced to flow across the cathode tends to fill the<br>
porosity, hampering the oxygen diffusion. To avoid this inconvenience it has<br>
been proposed to subdivide the cathodes into strips and to interpose between<br>
membrane and cathode strips a porous element, also hydrophilic as in the above<br>
cited Patent Application EP 1033419 A1, along which part of the formed caustic<br>
soda can be released.<br>
The caustic soda released on the oxygen side has a distinctive tendency to<br>
wet the cathode back-wall forming a continuous film again hampering the<br>
oxygen diffusion. To prevent this harmful effect, it is necessary that the cathode<br>
back-wall be strongly hydrophobic, which can diminish the surface electric<br>
conductivity with consequent complications for the electric contact needed to<br>
supply the electric current.<br>
The concentration of the product caustic soda is necessarily that generated by<br><br>
the reaction and no control under pre-determined limits is possible, as it happens<br>
instead in the former case of oxygen cathode wherein a forced circulation exists.<br>
The product caustic soda concentration value is around 37-45% depending on<br>
the amount of water transported across the membrane, an amount depending on<br>
the type of membrane and on the operative conditions of current density,<br>
temperature and concentration of alkali chloride solution.<br>
The ion-exchange membranes available on the market are irreversibly<br>
deteriorated when they come in contact even for relatively short times with caustic<br>
soda of concentration higher than 35%. It has therefore been suggested to<br>
operate the cell with oxygen cathode in direct contact with the membrane with<br>
diluted solutions of alkali chloride, as it is known that the amount of transported<br>
water increases as the alkali chloride concentration decreases. Nevertheless the<br>
flexibility of operation allowed by this factor is limited, as too low concentrations of<br>
alkali chloride worsen the membrane efficiency, increase the rate of oxygen in the<br>
chlorine and can lessen the operating life of the anodes. For this reason it has<br>
been proposed, as an additional measure, to saturate the oxygen with water<br>
vapour at temperatures close to the operating temperature of the cell; the water<br>
vapour diffusion across the pores of the cathode permits further lowering the<br>
caustic soda concentration towards the values acceptable for the membrane. This<br>
action, however, is only partially effective since part of the water vapour is<br>
absorbed by the caustic soda released from the back surface of the cathode.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a structure of electrolysis cell<br>
equipped with gas diffusion electrode free of the drawbacks of the existing<br>
technology. In consideration of the industrial relevance of the chlor-alkali<br>
electrolysis, reference will be made herebelow to a cell suited for this use, making<br>
clear that the invention may be advantageously applied to other electrochemical<br>
processes, such as the electrolysis of alkali sulphates (feeding the anodic<br>
compartment with a sulphate containing solution . and the relative gas diffusion<br>
anode with hydrogen), the production of hydrogen peroxide (feeding the cathodic<br>
compartment with an alkaline solution, and the relative gas diffusion cathode with<br><br>
oxygen), the production of electric energy with alkaline fuel cells (feeding the<br>
alkaline electrolyte in the two compartments, both provided with gas diffusion<br>
electrodes, supplied with hydrogen and oxygen).<br>
The cell structure of the invention comprises an oxygen cathode pressed against<br>
the ion-exchange membrane, a porous planar element interposed between the<br>
cathode and the membrane and crossed by a downward flow of caustic soda as<br>
known in the art, with the characterising difference that the constitutive material of<br>
the porous planar element is selected from the group of the hydrocarbon plastic<br>
materials such as polyethylene, in particular high density polyethylene, and<br>
preferably from the group of perfluorinated plastic materials (such as ethylene -<br>
chlorotrifluoroethylene ECTFE, polytetrafluoroethylene PTFE, tetrafluoroethylene -<br>
hexafluoropropylene FEP, perfluoroalcoxy polymers PFA), having high<br>
mechanical resistance also at high temperature and substantial chemical inertia<br>
towards hot concentrated caustic soda also in the presence of peroxide traces<br>
and thus not capable of producing harmful contamination of the membranes. All of<br>
these materials are highly hydrophobic and thus their use is in strong contrast to<br>
what proposed by the prior art technique, according to which hydrophilicity is an<br>
essential feature.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, a further characteristic of the present<br>
invention is given by the oxygen-containing gas feed in the lower part of the cell:<br>
in this way, the ascending gas flow effectively displaces the hydrogen formed in<br>
small amounts as a side product of the oxygen consuming reaction, avoiding<br>
dangerous build ups in stagnant zones. Hydrogen appears when the electrolysis<br>
cell is operated at high current density, as more as longer is the cathode operating<br>
life as a consequence of the natural and inevitable decay in the catalyst activity.<br>
The way of obtaining such results of great industrial relevance will be made clear<br>
in the following detailed description of the invention making reference to the<br>
attached figures.<br><br>
Figure 1 is a side view of the cell of the invention.<br>
Figure 2 is a front view of the cell of the invention according to a preferred<br>
embodiment.<br>
Figure 3 is a front view of the cell of the invention according to another preferred<br>
embodiment.<br>
It is known to the experts in the art that the industrial electrolysers and the fuel<br>
cells are preferably made of a multiplicity of elementary cells in hydraulic and<br>
electrical connection, pressed one against the other to form a modular<br>
arrangement; such electrical connection may be of monopolar or bipolar type. Also<br>
the cell of the invention is therefore suitable to constitute one of the repeating<br>
element of a modular electrolyser or fuel cell. Making reference to figure 1, the cell<br>
of the invention 1 is formed by two shells, anodic 2 and cathodic 7, which in the<br>
case of a chlor-alkali electrolyser are preferably constructed with titanium and<br>
nickel, respectively. The two shells are mutually fastened with tie-rods or jacks not<br>
represented in the figure, or with any other system of the prior art, and enclose the<br>
cationic membrane 16 which acts as the separator of the two compartments,<br>
anodic and cathodic.<br>
The cationic membrane employed in the chlor-alkali, and specifically sodium<br>
chlorine electrolysis, consists in a perfluorinated polymer on whose backbone<br>
sulphonic groups (side facing the anode 3) and carboxylic groups (side facing the<br>
cathode 10) are inserted. Membranes of this kind, characterised by low internal<br>
ohmic resistance and capable of operating at high current densities, typically 3-5<br>
kA/m2, are provided by the companies DuPont / USA, Asahi Glass and Asahi<br>
Chemical / Japan respectively under the trade names Nation®, Flemion* and<br>
Aciplex®. The peripheral sealing, necessary to avoid chlorine, oxygen, sodium<br>
chloride solution and caustic soda to be released to the external environment, is<br>
ensured by the perimetral gaskets 8. The anodic shell 2 contains the anode 3,<br>
consisting in a titanium sheet with openings, e.g. expanded or perforated sheet,<br>
provided with an electrocatalytic layer for the evolution of chlorine from chloride,<br>
based on platinum group metals or mixed oxides thereof and containing also<br><br>
oxides of valve metals, in particular titanium. The anode 3 is secured to the shell 2<br>
by means of supports 4 that also allow to transmit the electric current from the wall<br>
of the shell itself to the anode. The cathodic current distributor 11, consisting in a<br>
metallic foil with openings, e.g. a metallic mesh, an expanded or perforated sheet,<br>
preferably made of silver or as an alternative of nickel, stainless steels or nickel<br>
alloys, silver coated for an optimal electric contact, is secured to the cathodic shell<br>
7 through the supports 12, that allow an easy current transmission between the<br>
shell itself and the surface of the distributor. The current distributor preferably<br>
consists in a first conductive foil, of higher thickness, provided with openings, to<br>
which a second thin conductive foil with openings of smaller dimensions is<br>
overlaid, wherein said second foil is in contact with the oxygen diffusion cathode.<br>
Between the distributor 11 and the membrane 16, the oxygen-fed cathode 10 and<br>
the hydrophobic planar element 9 of the invention are inserted, respectively on the<br>
current distributor side and on the membrane side. The oxygen cathode consists<br>
in a porous conductive support whereto electrocatalytic particles stabilised by a<br>
suitable binder are applied as known in the art. The catalysts of the<br>
electrocatalytic particles are the platinum group metals, and principally platinum,<br>
their oxides, sulphides and more generally their chalcogenides, pyrochlores<br>
(particularly ruthenium pyrochlores), silver and gold. An interesting analysis of the<br>
scientific knowledge on this topic is reported in the book Electrochemical<br>
Hydrogen Technologies, edited by H. Wendt, Elsevier, 1990, Cap. 3<br>
"Electrocatalysis of the Cathodic Oxygen Reduction", K. Wiesener, D. Ohms.<br>
These catalysts can be used as bulk powders, optionally in admixture, to which<br>
graphite powders are optionally added with the double purpose of increasing the<br>
transversal electric conductivity within the layer and decreasing the amount of<br>
employed catalyst, so that an optimal compromise is achieved between<br>
performances and cost. This latter objective can be also accomplished by<br>
resorting to catalysts supported on a conductive material free of catalytic activity,<br>
e.g. carbons optionally graphitised in part, like those commercialised by Cabot<br>
Corp. under the trademark Vulcan XC-72 or Shawinigan Acetylene Black<br>
(hereafter SAB) well known to the specialists of the field.<br><br>
Cathodes suited to function with oxygen and incorporating the above indicated<br>
materials are disclosed, with the relevant fabrication methods, in the patent<br>
literature, e.g. in US Patents 4,614,575, and 5,584,976.<br>
A correct choice of the kind of hydrophobic planar element (void volume<br>
percentage, average pore diameter size, thickness) and of the caustic soda flow-<br>
rate permits to achieve the following results known in the art, namely: equalisation<br>
of the pressure of the caustic soda flowing downwardly inside the planar element<br>
by gravity force, with substantial reduction of the positive or negative pressure<br>
differential existing between caustic soda and oxygen (that makes the oxygen<br>
cathode structure scarcely critical), and control of the concentration of caustic<br>
soda in contact with the membrane within the optimal range 30-35% that allows<br>
better performances and longer membrane lifetime, thanks to the heat withdrawal<br>
capability of the caustic soda flow.<br>
The shape of the planar element can be much varied. As a non limiting example,<br>
foams, preferably with open cells, mattresses consisting in entangled coils of wire,<br>
planar meshes formed by layers of crossed and overlaid wires, planar meshes of<br>
woven wires, meshes of wires profiled so as to create surfaces with protruding<br>
regions and recessed regions can be mentioned. The planar element can be<br>
made of just one of these components or also of an assembly of overlapped<br>
components.<br>
The compression necessary to guarantee an intimate contact between<br>
membrane-planar element-oxygen cathode-current distributor can be<br>
mechanically ensured if the supports 12 of the current distributor are provided with<br>
elasticity and undergo a deflection when the shells 2,7 with the various constitutive<br>
elements are tightened. Alternatively the necessary elasticity may be achieved<br>
also when the supports 12 are rigid, if a component provided with elasticity, such<br>
as a conductive mattress made of coils or undulated layers, is added to the planar<br>
element-oxygen diffusion cathode-current distributor assembly. The necessary<br>
compression can be finally obtained maintaining the pressure inside the anodic<br><br>
shell 2 higher than that inside the cathodic shell 7. This higher pressure pushes<br>
the membrane against the hydrophobic planar element-oxygen cathode-current<br>
distributor assembly, whose supports 12 are in this case rigid, determining an<br>
effective contact across the whole extension of the various interfaces. During<br>
operation, the positive and negative poles of the current generator are connected<br>
respectively to the anodic shell 2 and to the cathodic shell 7, the fresh sodium<br>
chloride solution is fed to the nozzle 5, the depleted sodium chloride solution and<br>
the product chlorine are extracted from the nozzle 6, the fresh caustic soda<br>
solution is injected through the distributor 13, e.g. a perforated tube, and crosses<br>
longitudinally the planar element 9 downwards, and the obtained caustic soda<br>
solution, consisting in a mixture formed by the injected caustic soda and the<br>
caustic soda produced at the cathode 10, under the effect of the oxygen reaction,<br>
is discharged from the nozzle 15.<br>
The invention provides, as a first innovative feature, that the porous planar<br>
element inserted between membrane and oxygen cathode be made of highly inert<br>
plastic materials, preferably of the perfluorinated type and thus distinguished by<br>
high hydrophobicity, and in a preferred embodiment, as a second innovative<br>
feature, that the oxygen (or oxygen-containing gas) flow upwardly, as it is fed with<br>
a 10-20% excess with respect to the amount required by the total current supplied<br>
to the cathode, to the lower nozzle 17 (or to the same nozzle 15 used for<br>
discharging the product caustic soda if suitably dimensioned) while the excess is<br>
discharged from the upper nozzle 14.<br>
The materials taken into consideration in the prior art for the production of the<br>
planar elements are of the hydrophilic type: this feature was probably introduced<br>
since the wettability by the caustic soda is deemed necessary to prevent oxygen<br>
bubbles generated by leakage through the cathode porosity from adhering in a<br>
permanent way to the inner surface of the planar element. It is apparent that in<br>
this circumstance the electric current flow, hindered by the gaseous phase, would<br>
concentrate in the liquid-occupied areas with consequent increase in the cell<br>
voltage. Hydrophilicity limits the choice of materials which may be utilised for the<br><br>
construction of the planar element essentially to metals and metal oxides, since<br>
the plastic materials are, in general, typically hydrophobic. For instance, assuming<br>
a surface tension of 80 dyne/cm for the caustic soda solution, the detected contact<br>
angle is respectively 130° for PTFE, 120° for paraffin and 105° for polyethylene. It<br>
is known conversely that the hydrophilic materials are characterised by contact<br>
angles lower than 90°: the metallic surfaces are considered, in general, completely<br>
wettable and in fact they present contact angles with caustic soda close to 0°. If<br>
from a theoretical standpoint the complete wettability effectively provides a good<br>
warrant of having a planar element completely occupied by the liquid, it is also<br>
true that the metals or metal oxides to which assignment must be made in order to<br>
achieve such wettability, are generally not stable enough in the presence of hot<br>
caustic soda containing peroxide traces. By insufficient stability here it is not<br>
meant that the planar element is structurally destroyed in relatively short operating<br>
times, but rather that a release of metal ions sufficient, albeit slow, to contaminate<br>
the membrane polymer with consequent decay of performances in unacceptable<br>
times from a practical standpoint, would take place. The only metal that seems to<br>
be free of this effect is silver whose protective oxide, sufficiently impervious and<br>
insoluble, lowers the release of metal ions to values not capable of damaging the<br>
membranes. It is apparent however that the construction of the planar element<br>
with silver entails production costs unsustainable for a wide industrial production.<br>
Also the use of other metals, such as stainless steel or nickel, coated with a silver<br>
layer, does not represent a solution: in fact, since the planar element is in direct<br>
contact with the membrane, the ion release must be maintained at extremely low<br>
levels which may be guaranteed only by layers of high thickness obtainable with<br>
expensive procedures. The criticality of the planar element is in fact clearly<br>
superior to that of the current distributors (11 in fig. 1) which, being substantially<br>
spaced from the membrane surface, may be made of a metal coated with a thin<br>
and rather cheap silver layer: the inevitable porosity of the layer allows a certain<br>
release of ions from the base metal, which is anyway tolerable considering the<br>
position of the current distributor with respect to the membrane. As a conclusion,<br>
the prior art teaching, with its recommendation of utilising hydrophilic materials for<br>
the production of planar elements, makes particularly surprising the present<br><br>
invention according to which much satisfying results are obtained employing<br>
plastic materials for the planar element, and particularly perfluorinated plastic<br>
materials characterised as seen above by high contact angles and thus highly<br>
hydrophobic. These plastic materials can be used as such or also as a non porous<br>
coating, for instance 0.2-0.3 mm thick, applied to metallic planar elements<br>
produced with carbon steel, stainless steel, nickel alloys. With the hydrophobicity<br>
characterising the above indicated materials the oxygen bubble trapping within the<br>
planar element structure should be physiologic, and the voltages of the cells<br>
equipped with the planar elements of the invention should thereby result clearly<br>
higher than those typical of equivalent cells realised according to the disclosure of<br>
EP 1033419 A1, that is with planar elements with hydrophilic characteristics.<br>
Without wishing to limit the present invention in any way, it is possible that the<br>
expected negative effect due to the entrapped bubbles does not arise as a<br>
consequence of the presence of the cathode in a position immediately adjacent to<br>
the planar element: the cathode is in fact an electrode designed to absorb oxygen<br>
and, thanks to this function, is capable of consuming the oxygen bubbles possibly<br>
present in the planar element, if not completely, certainly in a substantial fashion.<br>
Therefore, if this theoretical hypothesis corresponds in effect to the reality, it can<br>
be understood how the oxygen cathode-hydrophobic planar element combination<br>
according to the invention may be employed with results at least as satisfying as<br>
those obtainable with the oxygen cathode-hydrophilic planar element coupling<br>
disclosed in the prior art. This conclusion is adequately supported by the<br>
experimentation described in Example 1, wherein it is also demonstrated that the<br>
operating stability of the cells realised in accordance with the invention is<br>
exceptionally high. This result of great industrial relevance most likely derives from<br>
the chemical inertia of the perfluorinated materials employed as a preferred<br>
solution for the fabrication of the planar element. The chemical inertia prevents the<br>
release of substances capable of polluting the membranes also after prolonged<br>
operating times. The experimentation described in the same Example 1 also<br>
demonstrates that cells constructed, according to the prior art teachings, with<br>
hydrophilic planar elements made of metals, are affected by a slow increase in<br>
time of the cell voltages, a problem which is not solved upon applying a silver<br><br>
layer, even of consistent thickness, to the base metal: only when the planar<br>
element is made of pure silver the stability of the cell voltage results comparable<br>
to the one of the cells of the present invention. As a further advantage,<br>
perfluorinated plastics are distinguished by good mechanical characteristics also<br>
in the temperature range 80-90°C typical, as known, of the chlor-alkali electrolysis.<br>
Consequently the planar element keeps its shape unaltered, and in particular as<br>
concerns both the void to occupied volume ratio and the porosity, without being<br>
squeezed by the elastic supports or the pressure differential employed to keep in<br>
intimate contact the membrane-planar element-oxygen cathode-current distributor<br>
assembly as previously illustrated.<br>
The invention provides, in a particularly preferred embodiment, that the oxygen (or<br>
oxygen-containing gas) be fed in the lower part of the cell crossing the gap<br>
located in the rear part of the oxygen cathode upwardly. This type of flow assumes<br>
a fundamental importance for the safety of operation of the cell. To understand<br>
this point, which is of fundamental importance for whatever industrial application, it<br>
is convenient to remind that the chlor-alkali electrolysis is characterised by two<br>
distinct cell voltage values depending whether the operation is in the conventional<br>
way with the hydrogen evolving cathode, or with the oxygen cathode: in the former<br>
case the cell voltage is comprised between about 2.5 Volts (low current densities)<br>
and typically 3-3.3 Volts (current density around 3-5 kA/m2), while in the latter<br>
case the cell voltage ranges between about 1.6 and 2.2 - 2.6 Volts, with a<br>
substantial saving in the consumed energy as initially discussed. The functioning<br>
at 2.2-2.6 Volts occurs when the cell is operated at the highest current densities<br>
(as required in the industrial applications to minimise the capital investment) and<br>
in particular after a certain number of hours in operation when the activity of the<br>
catalyst incorporated in the oxygen cathode has undergone an inevitable,<br>
physiological decay. As indicated a little above, cell voltage values equal to or<br>
higher than 2.5 Volts permit also hydrogen evolution, particularly in the areas<br>
wherein, for constructive (e.g. reduced porosity) or operation related reasons (e.g.<br>
complete localised flooding) oxygen diffusion is hampered. In these situations,<br>
therefore, hydrogen evolution and oxygen consumption occur simultaneously and<br><br>
hydrogen is inevitably mixed with the oxygen that flows along the rear part of the<br>
cathode with formation of potentially explosive mixtures. To prevent these<br>
hazards, the hydrogen percentage in oxygen must be monitored by using suitable<br>
sensors placed on the discharge of exhausted oxygen (or oxygen-containing gas).<br>
As it has been found in the experimentation at the basis of the present invention<br>
(see Example 2), with the oxygen fed in the upper part of the cell this kind of<br>
measurement is totally unreliable since the hydrogen contents measured by the<br>
sensors are strongly variable in time, unrelated to the effective production of<br>
hydrogen which is a function of the operating conditions, particularly cell voltage<br>
and current density. This unreliability is not an intrinsic feature of sensors but is<br>
rather inherent to the mechanisms of hydrogen build up in the gap reserved to the<br>
flow of oxygen, which has a vertical development of 1-1.5 m. In fact, when oxygen<br>
is supplied in the upper part of the cells, a process of hydrogen layering takes<br>
place due to the lower density of this gas with respect to that of oxygen:<br>
simplifying, it can be said that a countercurrent flow is established between the<br>
oxygen moving downwards from the top to the bottom of the cell and the hydrogen<br>
which has a natural tendendy to ascend to the top. This situation leads easily,<br>
particularly in the areas of low circulation, to the formation of pockets rich in<br>
hydrogen, and therefore dangerous, which render the operation completely<br>
unreliable. The periodic release of these pockets produces the oscillations of<br>
hydrogen percentage in the discharged oxygen as measured by the sensors.<br>
Conversely, if hydrogen is supplied to the lower part of the cell, his upward flow<br>
results concurrent with the direction of hydrogen diffusion, which is naturally<br>
ascending as said above. As a matter of fact, an oxygen-driven drag is induced on<br>
the hydrogen, which is very effective in preventing the formation of pockets with<br>
high hydrogen content. This working hypothesis is in fact confirmed by the data<br>
provided by the sensors, whose oscillations result extremely limited (see Example<br>
2). It is evident, as a conclusion, that the oxygen feed in the lower part of a cell<br>
equipped with a depolarised cathode substantially increases the operation<br>
reliability and it's not a mere variation of the prior art technique, which invariably<br>
proposes feeding from the top. The efficiency of feeding form the bottom can be<br><br>
further increased by adopting inlet distributors and outlet manifolds for the oxygen,<br>
e.g. consisting in a perforated tube of the same length of the cell and placed in the<br>
lower and upper part thereof. This type of design is shown in fig. 2 wherein a front<br>
view of the cell of fig.1 is sketched. The outlet 14 of the oxygen (supplied in<br>
excess in the lower part of the cell) is connected to the internal manifold 18, and<br>
the inlet of the same 17 to the distributor 19, both consisting in perforated tubes, in<br>
which the holes are preferably localised along the lower generatrix to allow an<br>
easy discharge of possible condensed phases. A further improvement of the<br>
second feature of the invention consists in the introduction of suitable baffles<br>
directed to impart a zigzag motion with high linear velocity to the oxygen flow,<br>
favouring the homogeneous mixing with hydrogen. This device is shown in fig. 3<br>
wherein the baffles, shaped as horizontal strips, are identified with 20. The<br>
direction of the gas flow is indicated by the arrows. The strips 20 are provided with<br>
some holes, not shown in the figure, to facilitate the discharge of condenses<br>
separated on the surfaces thereof. The overall section of the holes is at least one<br>
order of magnitude inferior to the flow section 21 existing between the terminal<br>
part of each strip and the periphery of the cell.<br>
Finally, in the oxygen flow section, and preferably in sections 22 of the<br>
embodiment of fig. 3, porous masses 23 can be advantageously inserted,<br>
consisting in highly porous material, characterised by low resistance to the gas<br>
flow and provided on its surface with a catalyst film capable of promoting the<br>
hydrogen-oxygen recombination, such as for example a modest amount of<br>
platinum group metal, like platinum itself and palladium. With this last embodiment<br>
not only the object of a high gas mixing is achieved, but also the percentage of<br>
free hydrogen is concurrently reduced. It is thus possible to operate the cells<br>
equipped with oxygen cathode in full safety conditions also when the quantities of<br>
generated hydrogen are relevant and capable of forming unstable mixtures even<br>
in case of optimal mixing obtained according to the provisions of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention has been described referring to the chlor-alkali electrolysis<br><br>
with oxygen cathode, as this is the application of greater industrial relevance. As<br>
initially said, the present invention results useful also for other processes, such as<br>
for instance the electrolysis of alkaline sulphates, in which a hydrogen consuming<br>
anode is used instead of the conventional oxygen evolving anode, as disclosed in<br>
US 4,561,945. In this case the planar element with all the previously seen<br>
characteristics is interposed between membrane and hydrogen consuming anode<br>
and is crossed by a percolating solution of sulphuric acid optionally containing an<br>
alkaline sulphate. Moreover, hydrogen is supplied to the lower part of the cell to<br>
prevent the local enrichment in oxygen, an anode by-product in the stagnating<br>
zones, in a totally similar fashion as discussed for the chlor-alkali electrolysis.<br>
A further application may be that of the alkaline fuel cells.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
The data of this Example have been obtained in the laboratory making use of<br>
some cells constructed according to the sketch of fig. 1. In particular, each cell<br>
had a height of 100 cm and width of 10 cm, with the two shells, anodic 2 and<br>
cathodic 7 respectively made of titanium and nickel. Furthermore the anode 3,<br>
sustained on rigid supports 4, consisted of a 1 mm thick titanium flattened<br>
expanded mesh with rhomboidal openings (diagonals = 4 mm x 8 mm) provided<br>
with an electrocatalytic film for chlorine evolution comprising titanium, iridium and<br>
ruthenium oxides. The current distributor 11 was made of two portions, both<br>
comprising a 1 mm thick nickel expanded mesh with rhomboidal openings<br>
(diagonals = 4 mm x 8 mm), secured on flexible supports 12, welded to a second<br>
0.5 mm thick expanded nickel mesh with small rhomboidal openings (diagonals =<br>
2x4 mm), galvanically coated with 10 micrometres of silver to guarantee a<br>
suitable multiplicity of contact points with low electric resistance with the oxygen<br>
cathode. The oxygen cathode comprised an 80 mesh silver wire net (0.2 mm<br>
diameter) with a layer of catalyst particles suitable for oxygen reduction applied on<br>
a face thereof (20% silver on Vulcan XC-72 carbon, for a total 20 grams/m2 of<br>
silver) mixed with tetrafluoroethylene particles 1:1 by weight, and a second layer<br>
of SAB carbon particles mixed with tetrafluoroethylene particles 1:1 by weight on<br><br>
the other face thereof, all sintered at 330°C with a final thickness of 0.5 mm.<br>
The planar elements were made of meshes formed by 1 mm diameter wire,<br>
overlapped and welded to form rhomboidal openings (diagonals = 5 x 10 mm)<br>
characterized by continuous channels on both faces, having a total thickness of<br>
about 2 mm, respectively produced with polytetrafluoroethylene, high density<br>
polyethylene and polypropylene, according to the invention, and as a comparison<br>
with nickel coated with 10 microns of silver and pure silver according to the prior<br>
art.<br>
When the two shells, anodic 2 and cathodic 7, were tightened with suitable tie-<br>
rods, the cathodic current distributor 11 exerted a pressure of about 300<br>
grams/cm2 on the anode-membrane (Nation N2010WX type)- planar element-<br>
oxygen cathode assembly, pushed by the flexible supports 12.<br>
The anodic compartment of the cell was flown by an about 20% sodium chloride<br>
solution, while a solution of 32% caustic soda percolated along the planar element<br>
with a time constant flow-rate of about 25 litres/hour. Finally, the cell was supplied<br>
with pure oxygen in the upper part with a 10% excess with respect to the<br>
requirement of the reaction. The residual oxygen was discharged from the lower<br>
part of the cell through an appropriate nozzle (17 in fig. 1). At a temperature of<br>
85°C and with the current regulated at 400 Amps (4000 A/m2) the cell voltage<br>
detected after a two day settling period resulted to be 2.30 Volts, practically<br>
independent from the planar element type. However, after 42 days of operation,<br>
while the voltage of the cells equipped with the planar element made of<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene, high density polyethylene, polypropylene and pure silver<br>
resulted unvaried, that of the cell comprising the silver coated nickel net showed<br>
an increasing tendency of the order of 30-40 millivolts per day. At 2.5 Volts, the<br>
operation was discontinued and the cell was inspected finding that the membrane<br>
presented a brown colouring. A subsequent analysis showed that the membrane<br>
contained a substantial amount of nickel. After about 50 days of operation, a rapid<br>
increase was detected in the voltage of the cells containing the polypropylene<br><br>
planar elements, accompanied by a sharp reduction of the percolating caustic<br>
soda flow-rate. During the inspection carried out after shut-down and opening of<br>
the cells, a sensible squeezing of the planar element was detected, attributable to<br>
the extensive cracking of the polypropylene planar element, probably caused by<br>
the attack of peroxide traces on the tertiary carbon atoms of the polymer chain.<br>
The deterioration produced a substantial reduction of the available section for the<br>
percolation of the caustic soda.<br>
An inspection conducted at the seventy-second day of operation on the cell<br>
equipped with the high density polyethylene planar element has shown a partial<br>
squeezing with still no effect on the flow-rate of the percolating caustic soda.<br>
The operation of the cells equipped with planar elements of<br>
polytetrafluoroethylene and silver went on until reaching 224 days with an overall<br>
voltage increase of 20-30 millivolt and without appreciable variations in the flow-<br>
rate of caustic soda percolation. At a visual inspection, the various parts did not<br>
shown anything abnormal. The membrane, of colourless appearance, resulted to<br>
contain, at a subsequent analysis, small quantities of calcium and magnesium<br>
proceeding from the sodium chloride solution and only negligible traces of nickel.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The tests of the present Example were carried out using the cell of the Example 1<br>
equipped with the planar element made of polytetrafluoroethylene according to the<br>
present invention, with the sole exception of the content of silver used as the<br>
electrocatalyst, which was limited to 10 grams/m2. The purpose was reproducing,<br>
since the beginning of the operation, the conditions of scarce activity arising in<br>
time as a consequence of the unavoidable catalyst poisoning due to impurities<br>
contained in the circulating caustic soda and/or catalyst alterations caused by<br>
shut-downs and subsequent start-ups (dissolving/re-depositing phenomena that<br>
change the catalyst particle size).<br><br>
Operating in the conditions indicated in Example 1 and particularly with current<br>
densities of 4000 Amps /m2 a stable voltage of 2.6 Volts was detected. In this<br>
situation, an analysis of hydrogen contained in the discharged oxygen in the two<br>
cases of oxygen fed from the lower section of the cell, according to the present<br>
invention, and from the upper section, as described in the prior art, was carried<br>
out.<br>
In the former case a volume concentration of 470 parts per million (ppm),<br>
reasonably stable in time (maximum fluctuations of about 50 ppm) was detected,<br>
while in the latter case rather modest concentrations, e.g. of the order of about 50<br>
ppm, alternated with peaks of 4000-5000 ppm. Such a behaviour can be likely<br>
explained assuming that hydrogen is produced mainly in areas of limited<br>
extension characterised by a difficult oxygen diffusion, and that the descending<br>
flow of oxygen opposes to the natural tendency of hydrogen to diffuse towards the<br>
upper part of the cell. This situation may lead to the formation of hydrogen rich<br>
pockets, potentially very hazardous for the safety of operation. The possibility of a<br>
local hydrogen enrichment is certainly removed operating in accordance with the<br>
present invention with an ascending flow of oxygen, substantially concurrent with<br>
the natural direction of the hydrogen diffusion.<br><br>
