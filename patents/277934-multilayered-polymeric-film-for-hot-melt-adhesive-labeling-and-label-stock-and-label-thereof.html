Cross-References to Related Applications<br>
This application claims the benefit of U  S  Provisional Application No 60/805,231 filed June 20, 2006.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention is related to a multilayered polymeric film for labeling articles and is further related to an adhesive containing label stock and a label comprising the polymeric film. The film, label stock and label are especially useful with a hot melt adhesive.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
Hot melt adhesives provide a convenient and economical way to label articles of commerce such as glass, metal and plastic containers for consumer and industrial products. Hot melt adhesives are easy to handle in their solid form, generally have an indefinite shelf life, are environmentally friendly and cost effective since they do not involve solvents, and are able to quickly form adhesive bonds without any supplementary processing One disadvantage of hot melt adhesives is their tendency to damage a label. Various relatively low molecular weight additives generally present in hot melt adhesives can migrate into a polymeric film of a label and result in staining, swelling and distortion of the label which detract from its function and appearance This additive migration can also gradually result in the hot melt adhesive losing tack or adhesiveness especially at high service temperatures which can result in partial or complete detachment of the label Hot melt adhesives can also cause thermal distortion of labels which lack heat resistance<br>
The polymeric film of the present invention minimizes or eliminates migration of hot melt adhesive additives and is heat resistant so that derivative labels are not damaged and remain attached to a container even at<br>
high service temperatures. The inventive polymeric film further provides the performance that is required to produce high quality labels including pnntability, die-cuttability, sufficient stiffness for dispensability, and conformability to an article or container<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
The present invention involves a polymeric film for labeling articles that comprises (A) a core layer having an upper surface and a lower surface and comprising a polypropylene homopolymer, a polypropylene copolymer, a high density polyethylene, or a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers; (B) a print skin layer comprising a polypropylene homopolymer, a polypropylene copolymer, a high density polyethylene, or a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers and at least 10% by weight based on the weight of the layer (B) of a polyolefin elastomer, an alkene-unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid derivative copolymer, or a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers wherein the print skin layer overlies the upper surface of the core layer, and (C) an adhesive skin layer comprising a polypropylene homopolymer wherein the adhesive skin layer has an upper surface and a lower surface wherein the upper surface of the adhesive skin layer underlies the lower surface of the core layer; wherein the composition of layer (C) is different from the composition of layer (A), and the polymeric film is oriented<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the core layer (A) of the polymeric film further compnses a polyolefin elastomer, an alkene-unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid derivative copolymer, or a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, an adhesive containing label stock for use in adhesive labels comprises the above described polymenc film of this invention comprising layers (A), (B) and (C), (D) an adhesive layer having an upper and a lower surface wherein the upper surface of the adhesive layer is adhesively joined to the lower surface of layer (C), and (E) a release liner wherein the release liner is releasably adhered to the lower surface of the adhesive layer (D)<br>
In a further embodiment of this invention an adhesive label is die-cut from the above described adhesive containing label stock comprising layers (A), (B), (C), (D) and (E)<br>

The polyolefin elastomers and alkene-unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid derivative copolymers when present in the print skin layer improve performance of the polymeric film to include the pnntability of a derivative label. The composition of the print skin layer (B) is different from the composition of the core layer (A) because the print skin layer and the core layer provide different functions and performance for the film<br>
In several embodiments of the invention, the print skin layer (B) comprises, based on the weight of the print skin layer, at least 10%, 10 to<br>
50%, 10 to 40%, or 10 to 30% by weight of a polyolefin elastomer, an alkene-unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid derivative copolymer, or a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers In several embodiments of the invention the print skin layer (B) comprises, based on the weight of the print skin layer, up to 90%, 50 to 90%, 60 to 90%, or 70 to 90% by weight of a polypropylene homopolymer, a polypropylene copolymer, a high density polyethylene, or a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers.<br>

(C) Adhesive Skin Layer<br>
The adhesive skin layer (C) comprises a polypropylene homopolymer wherein the composition of the adhesive skin layer (C) is different from the composition of the core layer (A). Because the adhesive skin layer and the core layer provide different functions and performance for the film, the composition of the adhesive skin layer is different from the composition of the core layer. The composition of layer (C) can be different from the composition of layer (A) based on (i) the type and/or amount of polypropylene polymer, (ii) the type and/or amount of one or more additional thermoplastic polymers and/or polyolefin elastomers and/or alkene-unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid derivative copolymers as described hereinabove for the core layer (A), (iii) the type and/or amount of one or more additives as described hereinabove for core layer (A), or (iv) a combination of any of the foregoing conditions (i)-(m). A function of the adhesive skin layer is to provide a surface for an adhesive layer to be adhesively joined to the surface of the adhesive skin layer wherein the adhesive layer comprises an adhesive as described hereinbelow for the adhesive label stock. In an embodiment of the invention the adhesive skin<br>
layer provides a surface for an adhesive layer to be adhesively joined to the surface of the adhesive skin layer wherein the adhesive layer compnses a hot melt adhesive and the adhesive skin layer eliminates or minimizes thermal distortion and migration of additives or components of the hot melt adhesive so that the inventive film and a derivative label from the film are not damaged or reduced in performance<br>

Film Construction and Processing<br>
The layers of the multilayered polymeric film of the present invention can be prepared by steps comprising extrusion of a layer from a linear or annular die, coextrusion of two or more layers from a linear or annular die, lamination of two or more previously formed layers, coating of one or more layers onto a previously formed monolayer or multilayer construction, or any combination of the foregoing steps. In an embodiment of the invention, the film is prepared by coextrusion from a linear die<br>
The polymeric film can subsequently be oriented by stretching it biaxially in the machine direction (direction the film is advanced during film manufacture) and in the transverse direction (direction normal or perpendicular to the machine direction) or by stretching it uniaxially in the machine direction or in the transverse direction. Generally the film is oriented by hot stretching it several times its length and/or width and then annealing it where hot stretching and annealing are done at or near the softening temperature of the film or from 90 to 175°C In several embodiments of the invention, the film is oriented by stretching the film from 2 to 12 times, 2 to 10 times, 2 to 9 times, 3 to 9 times, or 4 to 6 times in the machine direction or in both the machine and transverse directions In embodiments of the invention the film is oriented by stretching the film from 2 to 12 times, 2 to 10 times, 2 to 9 times, 3 to 9 times, or 4 to 6 times in the machine direction only. The oriented film can then be heat set or annealed to provide dimensional stability<br>
to the film to prevent or minimize shrinking or distortion when exposed to elevated service application temperatures during processing to form a derivative label and in subsequent label service. Coextrusion, orientation and annealing procedures which can be used to manufacture a film are described in US Patent Application Publication No US2004/0033349<br>
Orienting a film in the machine direction only generally increases the tensile modulus or stiffness in the machine direction. This increased machine direction stiffness provides a label, prepared from the film, with sufficient stiffness for proper dispensability and good print registration in the labeling of articles This film, oriented in the machine direction only, generally has a substantially lower tensile modulus or stiffness in the transverse direction (TD) compared to the machine direction (MD) which provides a derivative label with sufficient flexibility for good conformability to the surface of an article to be labeled In embodiments of the invention the TD to MD tensile modulus ratio is less than 0.75, 0.65, or 0 6<br>
The film following manufacture, which can comprise for example coextrusion or coextrusion and orientation or coextrusion and orientation and annealing, can have a total thickness ranging from 0 5-10 mils (12.7-254 micrometers), 1-7 mils (25.4-177.8 micrometers), or 1 5-4 mils (38 1-101.6 micrometers). The core layer (A) of the inventive film is generally a thicker layer compared to the skin layers (B) and (C) or to any tie layers that might be present in the film The thickness of the core layer (A) can be greater than 50%, 65 to 98%, 70 to 98% or 85 to 96% of the thickness of the film. The thickness of the skin layer (B) can be the same as or different from the thickness of the skin layer (C). The thickness of the skin layers (B) and (C) can independently be less than 50%, less than 40%, 1 to 30%, 1 to 15%, 1 to 10%, or 2 to 5% of the thickness of the film. A tie layer can be present in the film between the core layer (A) and one or both of skin layers (B) and (C) to improve adhesion or bonding of the skin layer or skin layers to the core layer. The tie layer can comprise any polymers, including thermoplastic polymers or polyolefin elastomers or mixtures of any of the foregoing polymers, as described hereinabove for the core layer (A) and throughout this application that improves adhesion, and can comprise a blend of a polyolefin and an alkene-unsatumted  carboxylic  acid  or acid  derivative  copolymer and/or<br>
polyolefin elastomer such as for example a blend of a polypropylene homopolymer or copolymer and an ethytene-vinyl acetate copolymer The thickness of tie layers is generally the same as the thickness of the skin layers. The composition of any tie layer lying between a skin layer and the core layer is different from the composition of the core layer and said skin layer since each of these layers provides different functions and performance for the film<br>
In embodiments of the invention each of the thermoplastic polypropylene homopolymers and/or copolymers present in the layers of the film can independently have a melt flow rate in g/10 minutes as measured by ASTM Standard D1238 of at least 4, 4 to 35, 6 to 30, at least 8, or 8 to 25 at 230°C/2.16 Kg. Labels derived from a film comprising high melt flow rate (at least 4 or at least 8 g/10 minutes) polypropylene homopolymers and/or copolymers generally have improved die-cuttability<br>
The film of the present invention comprises a print skin layer (B) which comprises at least 10% by weight of a polyolefin elastomer, an alkene-unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid derivative copolymer, or mixture of any of the foregoing polymers in the print skin layer based on the weight of the print skin layer. The polyolefin elastomers and alkene-unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid derivative copolymers can improve pnntability and/or allow for improving printabitity in terms of ink adhesion to a label derived from the film The film can also be treated on the surface of the print skin layer (B) or on the surfaces of both skin layers to further improve adhesion of an ink or an adhesive layer to a skin layer. Surface treatments comprise corona discharge treatment, flame treatment, plasma treatment, coating with an ink- or adhesive-receptive matenal such as an acrylic coating, or a combination of any of the foregoing treatments.<br>
In several embodiments of the invention a core layer (A) comprises a polypropylene homopolymer, a polypropylene copolymer, a high density polyethylene, or a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers, and the print skin layer (B) comprises a polypropylene homopolymer, a polypropylene copolymer, a high density polyethylene, or a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers and at least 10% by weight based on the weight of the layer (B) of a polyolefin elastomer, an alkene-unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid derivative<br>
copolymer, or a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers . In several more embodiments of this invention a core layer (A) comprises a polypropylene homopolymer, a polypropylene copolymer, a high density polyethylene or a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers and a polyolefin elastomer, an alkene-unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid derivative copolymer, or a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers, and the print skin layer (B) comprises a polypropylene homopolymer, a polypropylene copolymer, a high density polyethylene, or a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers and at least 10% by weight based on the weight of the layer (B) of a polyolefin elastomer, an alkene-unsaturated carboxylic acid or acid derivative copolymer, or a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers<br>
Figure 1 illustrates a polymeric film of the present invention in which relatively thin skin layers (B) and (C) respectively overiie and underlie a relatively thick core layer (A)<br>
Adhesive Label Stock and Adhesive Label Construction<br>
The polymeric film of the present invention comprises a multilayered film that is used with an adhesive layer to label an article The article can be any shaped container to include a bottle, a jug, a jar or a drum. The article can be made of paper, cardboard, glass, metal, plastic, or a mixture thereof. The article can be any shaped container used for packaging a consumer or industrial product In an embodiment of the invention the film comprising layers (A), (B) and (C) further comprises an adhesive layer (D) having an upper and a lower surface wherein the upper surface of the adhesive layer is adhesively joined to the lower surface of the adhesive skin layer (C). In another embodiment of the invention the adhesive layer comprises an adhesive as described hereinbelow. The polymeric film is generally converted to an adhesive containing label stock and then to an adhesive label which is used to label an article. The polymeric film can be converted to an adhesive containing label stock by initially slitting the film into widths surtable for labeling articles. The slit film is then combined with an adhesive layer and a release liner to form an adhesive containing label stock as illustrated in Figure 2. The adhesive layer can be combined with the release liner initially, the slit polymeric film initially, or with both liner and film simultaneously. In Figure 2,<br>
an adhesive layer (D) has an upper and a lower surface where the upper surface of the adhesive layer (D) is adhesively joined to the lower surface of the adhesive skin layer (C) of the polymeric film comprising layers (A), (B) and (C), and a release liner (E) is releasably adhered to the lower surface of the adhesive layer (D). The release liner can comprise a monolayered or multilayered film where the film of the liner can comprise a paper film, a polymeric film such as for example a polyolefin film, or a mixture of any of the foregoing films. The release liner normally comprises a release coating on the film of the release liner such as for example an organosiloxane polymer, which is also known as a silicone, so that the release liner can later be removed from the adhesive layer during the labeling process. The adhesive layer comprises an adhesive that comprises one or more thermoplastic polymers to include one or more elastomenc polymers In an embodiment of the invention, the adhesive layer comprises a pressure sensitive adhesive In embodiments of the invention the adhesive layer comprises a pressure sensitive adhesive which comprises a solvent adhesive, an emulsion adhesive, or a hot melt adhesive.<br>
Pressure sensitive hot melt adhesives generally comprise elastomenc polymers which comprise natural rubbers and/or synthetic polymers and additional components such as for example tackifiers as described in US Patent No. 6214935. The hot melt adhesive comprises an alkene-unsaturated carboxylic acid ester copolymer such as for example ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymers and ethyiene-ethyl acrylate copolymers, a styrene polymer and/or copolymer and/or block copolymer such as, for example, styrene-isoprene-styrene block copolymers and styrene-butadiene-styrene block copolymers, a polyolefin, a polyamide, a polyester, a polyurethane such as for example reactive polyurethanes, and a mixture of any of the foregoing polymers. The hot melt adhesive further comprises tackifiers, plasticizers, waxes, performance additives including antioxidants and photoinitiators and fillers and reinforcing agents and compatibilizers and nucleating agents and mixtures of any of the foregoing additives, and mixtures of any of the foregoing components. In an embodiment of the invention, the adhesive layer comprises a hot melt adhesive which comprises a styrene block copolymer<br>
 <br>
The adhesive containing label stock is typically converted to an adhesive label by initially printing the label stock using any printing means such as, for example, offset lithography with a suitable printing ink to include for example water-based inks and solvent-based inks and UV-activated inks. Alternatively, the slit film can be printed prior to combining with the hot melt adhesive and release liner. The printed label stock is then die-cut into a series of individual adhesive labels that can be used to label articles of commerce in a labeling operation. In the labeling operation, a series of die-cut adhesive labels can be peeled away one by one from a matrix of the polymeric film bordering the die-cut label and the underlying release liner<br>
