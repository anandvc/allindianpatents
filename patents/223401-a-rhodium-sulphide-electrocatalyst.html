				<td>IMPROVED RHODIUM ELECTROCATALYST AND METHOD OF PREPARATION<br>
STATE OF THE ART<br>
The electrolysis of aqueous HCl solutions is a well known method for the recovery of<br>
high-value chlorine gas. Aqueous hydrochloric acid is an abundant chemical by-product,<br>
especially in chemical plants making use of chlorine as a reactant: in this case, the chlorine<br>
evolved in the anodic compartment of the electrolyser can be recycled as a feedstock to the<br>
chemical plant. Electrolysis becomes extremely attractive when the standard hydrogen-<br>
evolving cathode is substituted with an oxygen-consuming gas diffusion electrode due to the<br>
significant drop in energy consumption. The ability of the gas diffusion electrode to operate<br>
successfully in this context is crucially dependent on the nature and performance of the<br>
catalyst, and also on the structure of the gas diffusion electrode.<br>
Platinum is generally acknowledged as the most effective catalyst for the<br>
electroreduction of oxygen in a wide range of conditions. The activation of gas diffusion<br>
electrodes with platinum based catalysts is well known in the art, and finds widespread<br>
application in fuel cells and electrolysers of many kinds. However, the case of aqueous HC1<br>
electrolysis poses some serious drawbacks to the use of platinum as cathodic catalyst, as it is<br>
inevitable for the gas diffusion cathode to come at least partially in contact with the liquid<br>
electrolyte, which contains chloride ion and dissolved chlorine. First of all, platinum is<br>
susceptible to chloride ion poisoning which negatively affects its activity toward oxygen<br>
reduction. A second source of poisoning is constituted by contaminant species, especially<br>
organic species, which are in most of the cases dissolved in the by-product hydrochloric acid<br>
undergoing electrolysis.<br>
Even more importantly, the combined complexing action of hydrochloric acid and<br>
dissolved chlorine gas changes the platinum metal into a soluble salt which is dissolved away,<br>
making this material inappropriate for use in gas diffusion electrodes. Furthermore,<br>
extremely careful precautions have to be taken during the periodical shut-downs of the<br>
electrolysers, otherwise the sudden shift in the cathodic potential, combined with the highly<br>
aggressive chemical environment, causes the dissolution of a significant amount of catalyst,<br>
and the partial deactivation of the remaining portion. While tailored procedures for planned<br>
shut-downs of the electrolysers can be set up for additional costs, little or nothing can he done<br><br>
in the case of a sudden, uncontrolled shut-down due to unpredictable causes like power<br>
shortages in the electric network.<br>
Other platinum group metals appear to follow a similar fate. For example, according to<br>
Pourbaix' Atlas of Electrochemical Equilibria in Aqueous Solutions, finely divided rhodium<br>
metal dissolves in hot concentrated sulphuric acid, aqua regia, and oxygenated hydrochloric<br>
acid. Similarly, (hydrated) Rh203.5H2O dissolves readily in HCl and other acids. These<br>
problems have been partially mitigated with the disclosure of the rhodium / rhodium oxide<br>
based catalyst described in US Patent No. 5,958,197. In particular, the rhodium/rhodium<br>
oxide system, although slightly less active than platinum towards oxygen reduction, is not<br>
poisoned by chloride ions. Also the chemical resistance to aqueous hydrochloric acid with<br>
small amounts of dissolved chlorine is sensibly enhanced with respect to platinum. However,<br>
an activation step is needed to obtain a sufficiently active and stable form of this catalyst, and<br>
some limitations arise when such a catalyst has to be included in a gas diffusion electrode. For<br>
instance, the chemical and electronic state of the catalyst is changed upon sintering in air, a<br>
very common step in gas diffusion electrode preparations known in the art Cumbersome<br>
and/or costly operations have to be carried out to replace this step, or to restore the active and<br>
stable form of the catalyst afterwards, as disclosed in U.S. Patent 5,958,197. The limitations<br>
inherent with the aforementioned rhodium/rhodium oxide were overcome by the novel<br>
rhodium sulphide catalyst disclosed in U.S. Patent 6,149,782. We have found that by<br>
introducing some changes in the method of preparation, some unexpected gains in<br>
performance and consistency are obtained over that disclosed in US Patent 6,149,782.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of the invention to provide an improved catalyst for oxygen reduction<br>
having desirable and unexpected chemical stability towards highly corrosive media, whereby<br>
these improvements are realised through pre-treating the starting materials.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide an improved catalyst for oxygen<br>
reduction having desirable and unexpected electrocatarytic activity in presence of organic<br>
contaminants.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide novel gas diffusion electrodes with the<br>
improved catalyst therein having desirable and unexpected electrocatarytic properties, as well<br>
as lower and more consistent operating voltages.<br><br>
It is another object of the invention to provide an electrolytic cell containing a gas<br>
diffusion electrode of the invention and to provide an improved method of electrolysing<br>
hydrochloric acid to chlorine.<br>
These and other objects and advantages of the invention will become obvious from the<br>
following detailed description.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The novel electrochemical catalyst of the invention is comprised of rhodium<br>
sulphide, which may be either supported on a conductive inert carrier or unsupported. This<br>
catalyst does not require any activation step prior to its use, and surprisingly retains all of its<br>
electrocatalytic activity towards oxygen reduction in presence of chloride ions and organic<br>
molecules. Moreover, the catalyst is surprisingly not dissolved by the complexing action of<br>
aqueous hydrochloric acid - chlorine mixtures, thereby requiring no particular precautions<br>
during shut-downs when used in hydrochloric acid electrolyzers.<br>
The catalyst is preferably coated on at least one side of a web, and may be used alone,<br>
with a binder, blended with a conductive support and a binder, or supported on a conductive<br>
support and combined with a binder. The binder may be hydrophobic or hydrophilic, and the<br>
mixture can be coated on one or both sides of the web. The web can be woven or non-woven<br>
or made of carbon cloth, carbon paper, or any conductive metal mesh resistant to corrosive<br>
electrolytic solutions.<br>
Examples of high surface area supports include graphite, various forms of carbon and<br>
other finely divided supports but carbon black is preferred.<br>
Such catalyst coated webs can be employed as gas diffusion cathodes exhibiting cell<br>
voltages, current densities and a lifetime that could not be previously obtained under normal<br>
operating conditions, especially when used in highly aggressive environments and with low<br>
purity reactants, such as the case of electrolysis of by-product hydrochloric acid.<br>
One improvement in the preparation of the catalyst consists in first heating the precursor<br>
rhodium chloride at reflux until a steady-state distribution of isomers is obtained. The<br>
isomeric distribution of the rhodium chloride is followed with UV/VIS in order to assure<br>
steady-state has been obtained. The resulting rhodium sulphide has an improved performance<br>
as can be seen by an increase in half-wave potential results.<br><br>
Another improvement in the electrocatalyst of rhodium sulphide occurs when<br>
electrocatalyst is deposited upon carbon black which has been highly dispensed whether or<br>
not the rhodium sulphide has been refluxed.<br>
Prior to mixing with the rhodium chloride salt, carbon black is dispersed by high energy<br>
mixers. One method is accomplished via a microfluidiser, which is a pressure-driven system<br>
and is available through such companies as Microfluidics (Newton, MA, U.S.A.).<br>
Other methodologies use rotor/stator methodology whereby one set of blades is fixed<br>
while the another set is spun at high rates around the fixed set Such action creates high shear<br>
on the sample. Rotor/stator operations are often performed in batch mode. Another device is<br>
a mill where a spinning barrel with plates performs the function of delivering shear energy to<br>
the solution. Kady Company (Scarborough, ME, U.S.A.) provides a range of these machines.<br>
These and similar devices are called "homogenizers" and perform the vital function of<br>
dispersing solids into solvent in a uniform and consistent manner. The following Example<br>
section will describe such a preparation and report results for rhodium sulphide catalyst<br>
unanticipated by simple mixing to form a carbon black dispersion.<br>
The best results are obtained with a combination of the two features, namely a single<br>
isomer of rhodium chloride deposited on a highly dispersed carbon black resulting in an<br>
electrocatalyst with a substantial increase in half-wave potential.<br>
The mixture of refluxed rhodium chloride solution is mixed with the dispersed carbon<br>
black, and subjected to a ultrasound step. A rhodium sulphide complex is then prepared upon<br>
sparging hydrogen sulphide gas in an aqueous solution of a water-soluble rhodium salt.<br>
Nitrogen gas may be used as a carrier for hydrogen sulphide, and a pure nitrogen flow may<br>
advantageously be used to purge excess hydrogen sulphide upon completion of the reaction.<br>
The resulting solids are recovered by filtration, washing and drying to constant weight at<br>
125°C, for example. The resulting form of rhodium sulphide must be heated in an inert<br>
atmosphere at 550 to 650°C, and preferably above 600°C to form a well defined crystalline<br>
form of rhodium sulphide catalyst. The heating may be for several hours depending on the<br>
size of the batch, and the choice of the temperature is crucial for the formation of a<br>
sufficiently stable and active catalyst.<br>
If the temperature is too low, such as 300°C, the resulting crystallites are not well-<br>
defined and the catalyst stability is not sufficient. If the temperature is too high, i.e., 725°C,<br>
the unsupported catalyst has excellent acid stability but does not possess adequate<br>
electrochemical activity.<br><br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING RAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a typical hydrodynamic voltammogram obtained for a sample of rhodium<br>
sulphide catalyst supported on the tip of a Rotating Disk Electrode (RDE) and subjected to a<br>
voltage scan. The three-electrode set up employs a saturated calomel reference electrode<br>
(SCE) and a platinum wire counter electrode. The solution is 5% HC1, and the test is at room<br>
temperature saturated with air. The 1/2 wave position at half plateau height is used as the<br>
analytical voltage.<br>
Figure 2 is a schematic of flow system for testing gas diffusion electrodes employed in<br>
the generation of Cl2 from HC1 using an oxygen depolarised gas diffusion electrode.<br>
Figure 3 is a plot derived from a series of catalysts prepared using the methods of either<br>
Example 1 or Counterexample 1, and incorporated into gas diffusion electrodes of Example<br>
2B. Each catalyst was evaluated using the RDE and then evaluated in a gas diffusion<br>
electrode tested in the set-up of Fig 2. The plot compares the analytical voltage from the RDE<br>
(El/2) to that obtained in the Lab Cell for the same catalyst.<br>
Figure 4 shows a comparison of 1/2 wave positions for either the counter example 1<br>
catalyst, catalyst prepared with only a reflux of the starting salt, catalyst prepared with only<br>
the dispersion of the carbon black and sonication of the mix, and catalyst prepared with a<br>
combination of reflux and dispersion/sonication.<br>
Figure 5 is a typical UV/VIS spectrum obtained on solutions of RhCl3 *nH20<br>
immediately upon dissolution and after 2.5 hours of reflux.<br>
In the following examples, there are described several preferred embodiments to<br>
illustrate the invention. However, it is to be understood that the invention is not intended to be<br>
limited to the specific embodiments.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A 100 gram batch of rhodium sulphide on carbon is prepared as follows. A quantity<br>
of rhodium chloride salt is added to deionised water to make a concentration of Rh metal of<br>
about 69 g/l. This solution is refluxed (95-100 deg C) overnight, i.e., about 16 hours. The<br>
progress of the reflux is followed with a UV-VIS Spectrum. The ratio of absorption at 470-<br>
475 nm to that of 374-380 nm should be in the range of 0.9-1.1, and more preferable 1 when<br><br>
the reflux is complete. Refer to Figure 5 for a typical spectrum obtained after 2.5 hours of<br>
reflux.<br>
In a separate operation, mix 64.00g Vulcan XC-72 in 2.0 liters of deionized water<br>
placed in a large (about 4 liter) beaker. The mixture is subjected to high-shearing mixing by a<br>
Silverson® rotor-stater. The mixture is vigorously agitated in both horizontal and vertical<br>
direction at 6500-9000 rpm for 15 minutes. After high-shear mixing, the dispersed carbon<br>
mixture is transferred to the vessel with a large stirring bar and 400 mL of 69g/L RhO<br>
solution (27.6g Rh metal) is added. Mix the solution on the magnetic stir plate for at least 5<br>
minutes.<br>
Further process the metal and carbon black mixture by placing the vessel in an<br>
ultrasonic bath for 20 minutes. Purge the vessel with nitrogen for 30-60 min at a rate of<br>
approximately 30 L/hr. Begin bubbling H2S through the vessel at the desired flow rate,<br>
typically about 8-9 liter/hour while the nitrogen continues at 30 L/hr. Five hours after H2S<br>
bubbling starts, a small sample of solution mixture should be taken. It is filtered and Rh<br>
concentration checked with XRF or UV-VIS to confirm adsorption of product on the carbon<br>
support. Hydrogen sulphide flow is discontinued after confirmation of complete adsorption<br>
of product on carboa The nitrogen purge is continued overnight. On the next day, the<br>
catalyst is filtered through a Buchner funnel using a vacuum pump without a wash except for<br>
that of a small rinse of the vessel (~30 ml). The filtered intermediate is placed into an oven<br>
overnight at a temperature of ~120°C. After drying, a furnace is prepared by purging with<br>
argon for 1 hour at room temperature. With continuous inert purge, the temperature of the<br>
furnace is ramped from room temperature to 650°C in one hour. The temperature is held at<br>
650°C for 2 hours. After the heater is turned off, the furnace is allowed to cool down in argon<br>
to room temperature overnight, once removed from the furnace, the catalyst is analysed and<br>
fabricated into a gas diffusion electrode or membrane electrode assembly.<br>
COUNTERE EAMPLE 1<br>
One hundred grams of supported rhodium sulphide were prepared by the following<br>
procedure: 57.3 grams of RhCl3 x H2O (39.88% given as rhodium metal) were dissolved in 2<br>
liters of de-ionised (D.I.) water, without any pH adjustment 53.4 grams of Vulcan XC-72<br>
active carbon were added, and the mixture was slurried with a magnetic stirrer.<br><br>
Hydrogen sulphide gas was then sparged through the slurry at ambient temperature<br>
using nitrogen as a carrier gas. The mixture has been allowed to react as described for 7<br>
hours. Upon completion of the reaction, nitrogen was purged through the system to remove<br>
residual H2S. The remaining solution was vacuum filtered to isolate the solids, which were<br>
then washed with de-ionised water and dried at 125°C to a constant weight.<br>
The resulting catalyst cake was finally ground to a fine powder and subjected to<br>
650°C under flowing argon for two hours. A load of catalyst on carbon of 27-28%, given as<br>
rhodium metal, was obtained.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
The catalysts of all the above reported examples, along with commercially available<br>
platinum on Vulcan XC-72 (for example from E-TEK, Inc.), can be utilised in several<br>
different configurations such as listed below. The catalyst of this invention is not limited by<br>
the structure of the gas diffusion electrode.<br>
a) EL AT® electrode: A web of carbon cloth with a warp-to-fill ratio of unity and about 25 to<br>
50 yarns per inch, and a 97-99% of carbon content was selected from a commercially<br>
available product with a thickness of 10 to 15 mils. Carbon cloth with a thickness of 5 to 50<br>
mils could have advantageously been used for this purpose. A mixture of fluorinated polymer<br>
(polytetrafluoroethylene, PTFE, commercialised by DuPont under the trademark Teflon® and<br>
Shawinigan Acetylene Black (SAD) carbon, commercialized by Cabot Corp., was coated on<br>
each side of the carbon cloth, air drying at room temperature after each coat, until reaching a<br>
total loading of 8 to 10 mg/cm2. A mixture of the powdered catalyst and Teflon® was then<br>
applied on one side of the carbon web in multiple coats until obtaining a layer of 0.5 to 2 mg<br>
of catalyst per square cm. After the final coat, the carbon cloth was heated to 340°C for 20<br>
minutes.<br>
b) Single-sided ELAT® electrode: The above procedure for preparation of the ELAT®<br>
electrode was repeated except the SAB/Teflon® mixture was applied to only one side of the<br>
carbon cloth, with a loading of 4 to 5 mg/cm2. The catalyst coat was applied on the same side,<br>
on top of the SAB/Teflon® layer.<br>
c) Flow-through Electrode: A carbon cloth with the same specifications for the ELAT®<br>
electrode was selected and 2 to 5 coats of a mixture of catalyst powder and Teflon® were<br>
applied to one side thereof. The coated fabric was then heated at 340°C for about 20 minutes<br><br>
to obtain 1.03 mg/cm2 of rhodium metal. The final heating step or sintering step is believed to<br>
melt the Teflon® and distribute it across the carbon catalyst. However, the sintering step may<br>
be successfully omitted for this electrode.<br>
d). Membrane Electrode Assembly: An ink was formulated consisting of approximately 3<br>
parts of catalyst and 1 part (as dry weight) of Nafion® ionomer, such as that sold by Solutions<br>
Technology, (Mendenhall, Penn., U.S.A.) as a suspension in a mixture of water and lower<br>
aliphatic alcohols such as methanol, propanol, and/or butanol. The ink was applied to a<br>
Nafion® 324 ion exchange-membrane, comtercialised by DuPont, held in place with a heated<br>
vacuum table, via spraying or painting, other ion exchange membranes known in the art may<br>
have alternatively been utilised. Subsequent layers of the ink were applied until depositing<br>
0.05 to 1 mg of metal/ mg/cm2 of catalyst. The assembly was further heated to remove<br>
solvents, and assembled with an appropriate electrode backing such as those disclosed in U.S.<br>
Patent 6,103,077. The catalyst ink as described could alternatively have been applied to an<br>
electrode backing, subsequently heated to remove solvents and assembled with an ion<br>
exchange membrane to form an equivalent membrane electrode assembly.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
In order to demonstrate the consistency of the catalyst prepared according to Example<br>
1 and compare multiple batches of catalyst prepared using the improved method to the<br>
method of Counterexample 1, the rotating disk electrode (RDE) was employed to obtain<br>
electrochemical data independently of laboratory cell testing. A dilute ink of rhodium<br>
sulphide on carbon is prepared with by mixing 33mg of supported catalyst with 25 ml iso-<br>
propyl alcohol and 25 ml DI water. A total of 1 microliter of this ink is applied in two to<br>
three coats onto the tip of a glassy carbon rotating electrode (6mm dia) . Once the ink is<br>
dried, an additional layer of 5% Nation® ionomer solution is applied (10 microliters) and<br>
evaporated to dryness. The electrode is placed in a solution of 5% HC1 that is at room<br>
temperature. A platinum counter electrode and saturated calomel reference electrode (SCE) is<br>
connected to a PAR 373 Potentiostat along with the rotating disk electrode. Under various<br>
rotation rates, a potential scan is applied whereby a plateau that represents reduction of<br>
dissolved oxygen is recorded. The wave potential at one half the plateau height (See Figure 1)<br>
is used as the analytical indicator for the catalyst oxygen reduction reaction. The more<br>
positive potentials indicate a greater facility for oxygen reduction.<br><br>
A series of gas diffusion electrodes as described in Example 2B are fabricated with<br>
catalysts prepared from the methods of either Example 1 or Counterexample 1. The resulting<br>
gas diffusion electrodes are tested using the laboratory test cell as described below. The<br>
electrolysis laboratory test is arranged according to the scheme of Fig. 2. The exposed<br>
electrode surface area was 100 cm2 and the membrane was Nafion 324. The anode was<br>
titanium mesh activated with ruthenium oxide catalyst, oxygen was fed to the cathode at a<br>
rate of up to 2.5-fold stoichiometric excess at ~5 cm water pressure and 13-15% aqueous<br>
hydrogen chloride electrolyte was fed to the anode. The electrolyte flow rate was .372<br>
m3/hour/cm2 at a back-pressure of 200 mbar. Unless stated otherwise, the cell voltages are<br>
recorded at 4 kA/m2 after three days of operation. All voltages were uncorrected for current<br>
collector resistance. The temperature of the cell and electrolyte was held at 55°C ± 5°C<br>
A plot of RDE wave voltage at 1/2 height vs. lab cell voltage is shown in Figure 3.<br>
Considering the range of variables stemming from reproducibility of fabrication of the gas<br>
diffusion electrode to the statistical reproducibility of a laboratory test cell, the correlation<br>
between the wave voltage at 1/2 height and the lab cell voltage indicates the RDE method is<br>
very good. As the analytical indicator for RDE moves to positive potentials, the laboratory<br>
cell operation voltage decreases. This correlation confirms that the analytical indicator is a<br>
relevant measurement for catalyst performance in actual systems.<br>
Multiple batches of catalyst are tested using the RDE methodology, and the average of<br>
15 batches prepared using the counter example 1 method are compared to 10 batches prepared<br>
using the method of Example 1. Table 1 summarises the results obtained by the RDE method.<br>
TABLE 1: RDE Peak position at 1/2 plateau height (vs. SCE)<br><br>
This table demonstrates that the improvements of dispersing carbon, refluxing the<br>
rhodium salt precursor, and applying ultrasound to the mixture of carbon and metal salt<br>
provide an improved catalyst by both performance (average increase in half-wave of 70 mV)<br>
and consistency (decrease in relative standard deviation from 15 to 8.3%)<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Catalyst prepared incrementally by either only reflux, or only dispersion (dispersion<br>
plus ultrasound) was also tested.<br>
Figure 4 shows the typical improvements possible with each process modification.<br>
While applying only the reflux of the starting salt, or only the dispersion of the carbon black<br>
clearly shows an improvement, the combination of these additional process steps provides<br>
the greatest gain.<br>
