COMPLETE SPECIFICATION [See Section 10; Rule 13]<br>
"A PROCESS FOR PREPARING A CELECOXIB DRUG SUBSTANCE<br>
PHARMACIA CORPORATION, of P O Box 5110, Chicago, Illinois 60680,<br>
United States of America,<br><br>
The following specification particularly describes the nature ..   of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br>
GRANETED<br>
24/4/2006<br><br>
The present invention relates to a celecoxib drug substance and a process for preparing the same.<br>
. The present invention relates to the selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitory drug celecoxib and in particular to solid-state forms of that drug, to pharmaceutical compositions comprising such solid-state forms, and to processes for preparing them. The invention further relates to methods of treatment of cyclooxygenase-2 mediated disorders comprising administering such solid-state forms or compositions thereof to a subject, and to use of such solid-state forms in the manufacture of medicaments.<br>
                 BACKGROUND-OF THE INVENTION<br>
Celecoxib, also known as 4-[5-(4-methylphenyl)-3-(trifluoromethyI)-lH-pyrazol-l-yl]benzenesulfdnamide (I), the active ingredient of Celebrex® marketed by Pharmacia Corp., has a therapeutically and prophylactically useful selective cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitory effect, and has utility in treatment and prevention of specific cyclooxygenase-2 mediated disorders and of such disorders in general. Celecoxib has the structure:<br><br>
Processes for preparing celecoxib are set forth in U.S. Patent No. 5,466,823 to f alley el al. and in U.S. Patent No. 5,892,053 to Zhi &amp; Newaz, both incorporated herein by reference. Co-assigned International Patent Publication No. WO 00/32189, incorporated herein by reference, discloses that celecoxib has a crystal morphology which tends to form long, cohesive needles. Co-assigned International Patent Publication No. WO 00/42021, incorporated herein by reference, discloses a solvated crystalline form of celecoxib and a method for desolvation of that crystalline form.<br>
A need for new forms of celecoxib, in particular forms suitable for preparing<br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/US00/32435<br>
rapid-onset compositions, exists. Rapid-onset drug-delivery systems can provide<br>
significant benefits over conventional dosage forms. Generally, rapid-onset<br>
preparations provide a short period to therapeutic or prophylactic response compared<br><br>
to conventional immediate-release or sustained-release dosage forms. For example, in 5      treatment of acute pain, a rapid-onset dosage form of celecoxib would be useful to<br>
provide fast pain relief.<br>
However, celecoxib presents certain challenges for formulation as a rapid-onset dosage form, particularly as a rapid-onset oral dosage form. For example, celecoxib has very low solubility in aqueous media and therefore is.not readily 10      dissolved and dispersed for rapid absorption in the gastrointestinal tract when<br>
administered orally, for example in tablet or capsule form. In addition, celecoxib has<br>
a relatively high dose requirement further increasing difficulties of providing a<br>
sufficient therapeutically effective dose for rapid absorption.<br>
Celecoxib crystals also present formulation difficulties as a result of unique<br>
15     physical and chemical characteristics such as electrostatic and cohesive properties,<br><br>
low bulk density, low compressibility and poor flow properties. Due at least in part to these properties, celecoxib crystals tend to segregate and agglomerate together during mixing, resulting in a non-uniformly blended composition containing undesirably large, insoluble aggregates of celecoxib. For these and other reasons, therefore, it is<br>
20      difficult to prepare an orally deliverable, rapid-onset composition containing<br>
celecoxib that has the desired blend uniformity.<br>
The bioavailability of an orally administered drug, as measured by its entry<br>
into systemic circulation in the bloodstream, depends on at least two fundamental<br>
processes: drug dissolution in gastrointestinal fluids (in vivo drug release) and<br>
25      subsequent absorption of the dissolved drug. Several factors influence dissolution of<br>
a drug from its carrier, including surface area of the drug presented to the dissolution<br>
solvent medium, solubility of the drug substance in the specific solvent medium, and<br>
driving forces of the saturation concentration of dissolved materials in the solvent<br>
medium. Notwithstanding these factors, a strong correlation has been established<br>
30      between the in vitro dissolution time determined by standard assay procedures for an<br>
oral dosage form and the rate of in vivo drug release. This correlation is so firmly<br>
established in the art that dissolution time has become generally descriptive of drug<br>
release potential for the active component of the particular unit dosage composition.<br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/US00/32435<br>
When the process of  in vivo drug release is slower than the process of absorption, absorption is said to be dissolution rate-limited. Since dissolution precedes absorption in the overall process, any change in the drug release or dissolution process will subsequently influence drug absorption. See for example 5      Lieberman et al. (1989), Pharmaceutical Dosage Forms: Tablets. Vol. 1, pp. 34-36.<br>
Marcel Dekker, New York. It is clear, therefore, that dissolution time determined for<br>
a composition is one of the important fundamental characteristics for consideration<br>
when evaluating compositions intended for fast-onset delivery, particularly where<br>
drug absorption is dissolution rate-limited.<br>
10	Crystalline solids, due to their highly organized, lattice-like structures,<br>
typically require a significant amount of energy for dissolution. The energy required<br>
for a drug molecule to escape from a crystal, for example, is greater than is required<br>
for the same drug molecule to escape from a non-crystalline, amorphous form.<br>
Importantly, however, crystalline drug forms which have been transformed into 15      amorphous forms tend to revert to a steady state of low energy, namely the crystalline<br>
form, over time and thus may not have an adequate shelf life. An amorphous form of<br>
celecoxib has not hitherto been known in the art.<br><br>
As indicated hereinbelow, treatment with celecoxib is indicated in a very wide<br>
array of cyclooxygenase-2 mediated conditions and disorders. Therefore, if an<br>
20      amorphous form of celecoxib could be prepared, and in particular if a storage-stable composition comprising such an amorphous form of celecoxib could be developed exhibiting enhanced bioavailability, for example through rapid dissolution of the drug, a significant advance would be realized in treatment of cyclooxygenase-2 mediated conditions and disorders, particularly in treatment of acute disorders where early relief<br>
25      from pain or other symptoms is desired.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION Celecoxib provides a more rapid onset of therapeutic effect if, upon oral administration of a composition comprising celecoxib, pharmacokinetic properties are exhibited leading to a greater maximum blood serum concentration (Cmax ) and/or a 30      shorter time following the administration to reach that maximum (Tmax   It is<br>
contemplated that a greater Cmax  and/or a shorter Tmax  can result from faster dissolution of celecoxib when provided in amorphous form than in crystalline form.<br>

     DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION Amorphous celecoxib<br>
The invention provides a novel amorphous form of celecoxib. The term "amorphous"] as used herein, refers to solid-state particles lacking a regular crystalline 5      structure. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that amorphous celecoxib particles require less energy for dissolution than crystalline celecoxib particles of similar dimensions, and that this reduced dissolution energy requirement contributes, at least in part, to increased dissolution rate and/or decreased therapeutic onset time exhibited by amorphous celecoxib and compositions thereof.<br>
10     Celecoxib drug substance of the invention I In addition to amorphous celecoxib per se, the invention provides a celecoxib<br>
drug substance that comprises amorphous celecoxib. At least a detectable amount of<br>
amorphous celecoxib is present. Preferably, about 10% to about 100%, more<br>
preferably about 25% to about 100%, still more preferably about 60% to about 100%,<br>
15      and even more preferably about 80% to about 100%, by weight of the celecoxib in a<br>
celecoxib drug substance of the invention is amorphous. In a particular embodiment,<br>
substantially all of the celecoxib is amorphous, i.e., the celecoxib drug substance is<br>
substantially phase pure amorphous celecoxib.<br>
A preferred celecoxib drug substance is an entirely solid-state substance<br>
20      wherein the fraction, if any, of the celecoxib that is not amorphous, is crystalline. For example, a microparticulate or nanoparticulate celecoxib drug substance of this embodiment  can, in addition to an amorphous celecoxib fraction, comprise a fraction of microcrystalline or nanocrystalline celecoxib, though this crystalline fraction is preferably small, for example, less than about 50%, more preferably less than about<br>
25      25%, and still more preferably less than about 10%, by weight of the total celecoxib<br>
present.	<br>
In one embodiment, the amount of amorphous celecoxib in a celecoxib drug substance is sufficient to provide increased dissolution rate as measured in a standard in vitro dissolution assay and/or improved bioavailability (e.g., shorter time to reach a<br>
30      threshold therapeutic concentration in blood plasma, greater Cmax and/or shorter Tmax) as measured in a standard in vivo pharmacokinetic study, compared with an otherwise similar celecoxib drug substance wherein all, or a substantial portion of, the celecoxib<br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT7US00/32435<br>
is crystalline.<br>
Amorphous celecoxib or a celecoxib drug substance of the invention can be<br>
prepared by any suitable process, not limited to processes described herein.<br>
One illustrative process comprises (a) a step of melting solid-state celecoxib,<br>
5      e.g., crystalline celecoxib; and (b) a step of rapidly cooling the resulting melted<br>
celecoxib to form a celecoxib drug substance wherein the celecoxib is present, in at<br>
least a detectable amount, in amorphous form. This process optionally further<br>
comprises (c) a step of grinding the celecoxib drug substance resulting from step (b)<br>
to form a drug powder.<br>
10	Melting step (a) can be performed by any technique known in the art, for<br>
example, by heating the celecoxib in an oven at about 150°C to about 180°C. Cooling<br>
step (b) can be performed by any suitable method, for example by floating a container<br>
holding the melted celecoxib in liquid nitrogen. The optional grinding step (c) can be<br>
performed by any suitable method, for example by grinding in a mortar and pestle or<br>
15      by grinding in a mill, for example a media mill.<br>
A celecoxib drug substance or drug powder prepared according to the above<br>
process or any other process can be administered orally, rectally or parenterally<br>
without further formulation, or in simple suspension in water or another<br>
pharmaceutical y acceptable liquid. Alternatively, the celecoxib drug substance or<br>
20      drug powder can be directly filled into capsules for oral administration. Preferably,<br>
however, the celecoxib drug substance or drug powder is subjected to further<br>
processing, typically with one or more excipients, to prepare a pharmaceutical<br>
composition, for example an oral dosage form, as described hereinbelow.<br>
Celecoxib-crvstallization inhibitor composites<br>
25	In a presently preferred embodiment of the invention there is provided a<br>
celecoxib-crystallization inhibitor composite comprising particles of amorphous celecoxib or a celecoxib drug substance having at least a detectable amount of amorphous celecoxib, in intimate association with one or more crystallization inhibitors. An intimate association" in the present context includes, for example,<br>
30      celecoxib admixed with the crystallization inhibitor, celecoxib embedded or<br>
incorporated in the crystallization inhibitor, celecoxib forming a coating on particles<br>
of the crystallization inhibitor or vice versa, and a substantially homogeneous<br><br><br>
WO 01/42221 	PCTAJS00/32435<br>
dispersion 6 of celecoxib throughout the crystallization inhibitor. The term "substantially homogeneous" herein with reference to a composite or pharmaceutical composition that comprises multiple components means that the components are sufficiently mixed such that individual components are not present as discrete layers 5      and do not form concentration gradients within the composition.<br>
A cel ecoxib-crystallization inhibitor composite of this embodiment preferably comprises about 1% to about 95%, preferably about 10% to about 90%, more preferably about 25% to about 85%, and still more preferably about 30% to about 80%, by weight, of celecoxib. As indicated above, celecoxib in such a composite 10     exists, at least in a detectable amount, in amorphous form. Preferably, about 10% to about 100%, more preferably about 50% to about 100%, and still more preferably about 75% to about 100%, by weight of the total celecoxib in the composite is<br>
amorphous celecoxib.<br>
In composites of this embodiment, a fraction of the celecoxib can be present as<br>
15      microcrystalline or nanocrystalline celecoxib, though this fraction is preferably small, for example less than about 50%, more preferably less than about 25%, and still more preferably less than about 10%, by weight of the total celecoxib in the composite. Crystallization inhibitors include any material which substantially reduces conversion of amorphous celecoxib to crystalline celecoxib, for example, polymers,<br>
20      carbohydrates] lipids, etc. The term "substantially" with respect to reducing such<br>
conversion includes completely inhibiting, preventing, slowing, delaying, decreasing or restricting crystallization of celecoxib to a measurable degree. It will be understood that both selection of crystallization inhibitor(s) and the amount of crystallization inhibitor(s) used in a composite of the invention influences stability of<br>
25      amorphous celecoxib therein.<br>
Crystallization inhibitors are preferably polymers, more preferably polymers<br>
of low solubility in water. Still more preferably, such polymers are substantially non-<br>
crosslinked.<br>
Non-limiting examples of suitable polymers that can be used as crystallization<br>
30      inhibitors include, either alone or in combination, polyvinylpyrrolidone (PVP or<br>
povidone, e.g., Kollidon™ CLM of BASF), hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC,<br>
e.g., Methocel™  E5 Premium), HPMC phthalate, ethylcellulose,<br>
hydroxyethylcellulose, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (carmellose sodium), calcium<br><br><br>
PCT/USOO/32435 WO 01/42221<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, dextran, acacia, starches such as sodium starch elycolate<br>
(SSG, e.g., Explotab™ R of Mendell), p-cyclodextrin (e.g., KJeptose™ 4PC of<br>
Roquette), block copolymers of ethylene oxide and propylene oxide (e.g., Pluronic™<br>
F-68 and F-108), polyvinyl alcohol and polyethylene glycol (PEG). Povidone and<br>
5      HPMC are preferred polymers for use as crystallization inhibitors and form celecoxib-<br>
polymer composites of the invention.<br>
HPMCs vary in the chain length of their cellulosic backbone and consequently<br>
in their viscosity as measured for example at a 2% by weight concentration in water.<br>
HPMC used in celecoxib-polymer composites of the invention should have a<br>
10     viscosity, 2% in water, of about 100 to about 100,000 cP, preferably about 1000 to<br>
about 15,000 cP, for example about 4000 cP. Molecular weight of HPMC used in<br><br>
celecoxib-polymer composites of the invention is preferably greater than about 10,000<br>
but preferably not greater than about 1,500,000, more preferably not greater than<br>
about 1,000,000, still more preferably not greater than about 500,000, and even more<br>
15      preferably not greater than about 150,000.<br>
HPMCs also vary in the relative degree of substitution of available hydroxyl groups on the cellulosic backbone by methoxy and hydroxypropoxy groups.  With increasing hydroxypropoxy substitution, the resulting HPMC becomes more hydrophilic in nature. It is preferred in celecoxib-HPMC composites of the present<br>
20      invention to use HPMC having about 15% to about 35%, preferably about 19% to about 32%, and more preferably about 22% to about 30%, methoxy substitution, and having about 3% to about 15%, preferably about 4% to about 12%, and more preferably about 7% to about 12%, hydroxypropoxy substitution.<br>
HPMCs which can be used in the present invention are illustratively available<br>
15     under the brand names Methocel™ of Dow Chemical Co. and Metolose™ of Shin-Etsu Chemical Co. Examples of particularly suitable HPMCs having medium viscosity includeMethocel™ E4M and Methocel™ K4M, both of which have a viscosity, 2% in water, of about 4000 cP. Examples of HPMCs having higher viscosity include Methocel™ E10M, Methocel™ K15M and Methocel™ K100M,<br>
50     which have viscosities, 2% in water, of 10,000 cP, 15,000 cP and 100,000 cP respectively.<br>
Preferred povidones used in celecoxib-polymer composites of the invention have a molecular weight of about 2,500 to about 3,000,000, preferably about 8,000 to<br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/US00/32435<br>
about 1,000,000, and more preferably about 10,000 to about 400,000, for example,<br>
about 50,000. Preferably, povidone used in celecoxib-polymer composites have a<br>
dynamic viscosity, 10% in water at 20°C, of about 1.3 to about 700, preferably about<br>
1.5 to about 30.0, and more preferably about 3.5 to about 8.5 mPa s.<br>
5	In celecoxib-crystallization inhibitor composites, for example celecoxib-<br>
polymer composites, of the invention, the amount of crystallization inhibitor is preferably sufficient such when maintained in an open dish at ambient temperature for a period of 7 days, transformation of amorphous celecoxib to crystalline celecoxib is no greater than about 50%, preferably no greater than about 25%, and more preferably 10     no greater than about 10%, by weight of all celecoxib in the composite.<br>
Typically, depending on the particular polymer(s) used, one or more polymers are present in a contemplated celecoxib-polymer composite in a total amount of about 10% to about 80,%, preferably about 15% to about 75%, and more preferably about 25% to about 65%, by weight. Preferably, the weight ratio of celecoxib to polymer is 15      about 1:1000 to about 10:1, more preferably about 1:10 to about 5:1, and still more preferably about 1:2 to about 2.5:1.<br>
A celecoxib-crystallization inhibitor composite of the invention can be prepared by any suitable process, not limited to processes described herein.<br>
One illustrative process comprises (a) a step of dissolving celecoxib and one or 20     more crystallization inhibitors in a solvent liquid to form a solution; and (b) a step of drying the solution to form a celecoxib-crystallization inhibitor composite wherein the celecoxib and the crystallization inhibitor are in intimate association and wherein at least a detectable fraction of the celecoxib is in amorphous form. Optionally, this process can further comprise a step (c) of grinding the celecoxib-crystallization 25      inhibitor composite to form a celecoxib-crystallization inhibitor composite powder. Suitable solvent liquids which can be used to prepare a celecoxib-crystallization inhibitor composite, for example a celecoxib-polymer composite, can comprise any pharmaceutically acceptable solvent in which celecoxib can be dissolved. Heat and stirring can be used to facilitate drug dissolution in the solvent 30      liquid. The solvent liquid can also comprise a non-solvent fraction, for example,<br>
water. Non-limiting examples of suitable solvents that may be used in solvent liquids of the invention include, for example, water-alcohol mixtures, methanol, ethanol, isopropanol, higher alcohols, propylene glycol, ethyl caprylate, propylene glycol<br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/US00/32435<br>
laurate, PEG, diethyl glycol monoethyl ether (DGME), tetraethylene glycol dimethyl<br>
ether, triethylene glycol monoethyl ether, polysorbate 80, etc. Ethanol and<br>
     isopropanol are preferred solvents.<br>
It has surprisingly been found that use of isopropanol as a solvent permits a<br>
5     relatively high loading of celecoxib and polymer in the solution to be dried;<br>
accordingly isopropanol is presently an especially preferred solvent.<br>
The drying step (b) can be performed by any suitable means, for example, by<br>
evaporation, lyophilization, conventional heating {e.g., in an oven), spray drying, etc.<br>
Spray drying is a preferred method of drying. Any suitable spray drying method<br>
   10     known in the art can be employed. Generally, spray drying is a process by which a solution comprising dissolved drug and crystallization inhibitor is rapidly sprayed over a current of warm air, resulting in formation of dry powder.<br>
The optional grinding step (c) can be performed by any suitable method, for example by grinding in a mortar and pestle or by grinding in a mill, for example a 15      media mill.<br>
A ce ecoxib-crystalIization inhibitor composite, for example a celecoxib-polymer composite or a powder thereof, prepared according to the above process or any other process, can be administered orally, rectally or parenterally without further formulation, or in simple suspension in water or another pharmaceutically acceptable 20     liquid. Alternatively, the composite or powder thereof can be directly filled into capsules for oral administration. Preferably, however, the composite or powder thereof is subjected to further processing, typically with one or more additional excipients, to prepare a pharmaceutical composition, for example an oral dosage form, as described hereinbelow.<br>
25      Pharmaceutical compositions<br>
Amorphous celecoxib, a celecoxib drug substance or a celecoxib-<br>
crystallization inhibitor composite as provided herein can be further formulated<br>
together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients to produce a<br>
pharmaceutical composition. The term "excipient" herein means any substance, not<br>
30      itself a therapeutic agent, used as a carrier or vehicle for delivery of a therapeutic l| agent to a subject or added to a pharmaceutical composition to improve its handling or<br>
storage properties or to permit or facilitate formation of a dose unit of the composition<br><br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/US00/32435<br>
into a discrete article such as a capsule or tablet suitable for oral administration. Excipients include, by way of illustration and not limitation, diluents, disintegrants, binding agents, adhesives, wetting agents, lubricants, glidants, crystallization inhibitors, surface modifying agents, substances added to mask or counteract a 5      disagreeable taste or odor, flavors, dyes, fragrances, and substances added to improve appearance of the composition.<br>
Excipients employed in compositions of the invention can be solids or liquids or both. Compositions of the invention containing excipients can be prepared by any known technique of pharmacy that comprises admixing an excipient with a drug or 10      therapeutic agent. A composition of the invention contains a desired amount of<br>
celecoxib per dose unit and, if intended for oral administration, can be in the form, for example, of a tablet, a caplet, a pill, a hard or soft capsule, a lozenge, a cachet, a dispensable powder, granules, a suspension, an elixir, a liquid, or any other form reasonably adapted for such administration. If intended for parenteral administration, 15      it can be in the form, for example, of a suspension. If intended for rectal<br>
administration! it can be in the form, for example, of a suppository. Presently preferred are oral dosage forms that are discrete dose units each containing a predetermined amount of the drug, such as tablets or capsules.<br>
Non-limiting examples follow of excipients that can be used to prepare 20      pharmaceutical compositions of the invention.<br>
Compositions of the invention optionally comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable diluents as excipients. Suitable diluents illustratively include, either individually or in combination, lactose, including anhydrous lactose and lactose monohydrate; starches, including directly compressible starch and 25      hydrolyzed starches (e.g., Celutab™ and Emdex™); mannitol; sorbitol; xylitol; dextrose (e.g., (terelose™ 2000) and dextrose monohydrate; dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate; sucrose-based diluents; confectioner's sugar; monobasic calcium sulfate monohydrate; calcium sulfate dihydrate; granular calcium lactate trihydrate; dextrates; inositol; hydrolyzed cereal solids; amylose; celluloses including 30     microcrystalline cellulose, food grade sources of a- and amorphous cellulose {e.g., Rexcel™) and powdered cellulose; calcium carbonate; glycine; bentonite; polyvinylpyrrolidone; and the like. Such diluents, if present, constitute in total about 5% to about 99%, preferably about 10% to about 85%, and more preferably about<br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/USOO/32435<br>
20% to about 80%, of the total weight of the composition. The diluent or diluents selected preferably exhibit suitable flow properties and, where tablets are desired, compressibility.<br>
Lactose and microcrystalline cellulose, either individually or in combination, 5      are preferred diluents. Both diluents are chemically compatible with celecoxib. The use of extragranular microcrystalline cellulose (that is, microcrystalline cellulose added to a wet granulated composition after a drying step) can be used to improve hardness (for tablets) and/or disintegration time. Lactose, especially lactose monohydrate, is particularly preferred. Lactose typically provides compositions<br>
10      having suitab e release rates of celecoxib, stability, pre-compression flowability, and/or drying properties at a relatively low diluent cost. It provides a high density substrate that aids densification during granulation (where wet granulation is employed) and therefore improves blend flow properties.<br>
Compositions of the invention optionally comprise one or more<br>
15      pharmaceutically acceptable disintegrants as excipients, particularly for tablet<br>
formulations. Suitable disintegrants include, either individually or in combination, .  starches, including sodium starch glycolate (e.g., Explotab™ of Pen West) and pregelatinized corn starches (e.g.. National™ 1551, National™ 1550, and Colocorn™ 1500), clays (e.g., Veegum™ HV), celluloses such as purified cellulose,<br>
20      microcrystalline cellulose, methylcellulose, carboxymethylcellulose and sodium carboxymethylcellulose, croscarmellose sodium (e.g., Ac-Di-Sol™ of FMC), alginates, crospovidone, and gums, such as agar, guar, locust bean, karaya, pectin and tragacanth gums.<br>
Disintegrants may be added at any suitable step during the preparation of the<br>
25     composition, particularly prior to granulation or during a lubrication step prior to compression. Such disintegrants, if present, constitute in total about 0.2% to about<br>
30%, preferably about 0.2% to about 10%, and more preferably about 0.2% to about<br>
5%, of the total weight of the composition.<br>
Croscarmellose sodium is a preferred disintegrant for tablet or capsule<br>
30      disintegration, and, if present, preferably constitutes about 0.2% to about 10%, more<br>
preferably about 0.2% to about 7%, and still more preferably about 0.2% to about 5%,<br>
of the total weight of the composition. Croscarmellose sodium confers superior<br>
intragranular disintegration capabilities to granulated compositions of the present<br><br>
WO 01/42221<br><br>
PCT/USOO/32435<br><br>
invention.<br>
Compositions of the invention optionally comprise one or more pharmaceutically acceptable binding agents or adhesives as excipients, particularly for tablet formulations. Such binding agents and adhesives preferably impart sufficient 5      cohesion to the powder being tableted to allow for normal processing operations such as sizing, lubrication, compression and packaging, but still allow the tablet to disintegrate and the composition to be absorbed upon ingestion. Suitable binding agents and adhesives include, either individually or in combination, acacia; tragacanth; sucrose; gelatin; glucose; starches such as, but not limited to, 10     pregelatinized starches {e.g., National™ 1511 and National™ 1500); celluloses such as, but not limited to, methylcellulose and carmellose sodium (e.g., Tylose™); alginic acid and salts of alginic acid; magnesium aluminum silicate; PEG; guar gum; polysaccharide acids; bentonites; povidone, for example povidone K-l 5, K-30 and K-29/32; polymethacrylates; HPMC; hydroxypropylcellulose (e.g., Klucel™); and 15      ethylcellulose (e.g., Ethocel™). Such binding agents and/or adhesives, if present, constitute in total about 0.5% to about 25%, preferably about 0.75% to about 15%, and more preferably about 1% to about 10%, of the total weight of the composition.<br>
Compositions of the invention optionally comprise one or more pharmaceuticall,y acceptable wetting agents as excipients. Such wetting agents are 20      preferably selected to maintain the celecoxib in close association with water, a condition that is believed to improve bioavailability of the composition.<br>
Non-limiting examples of surfactants that can be used as wetting agents in compositions of the invention include quaternary ammonium compounds, for example benzalkonium chloride, benzethonium chloride and cetylpyridinium chloride, dioctyl 25      sodium sulfosuccinate, polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ethers, for example nonoxynol 9, nonoxynol 10, and octoxynol 9, poloxamers (polyoxyethylene and polyoxypropylene block copolymers), polyoxyethylene fatty acid glycerides and oils, for example polyoxyethylene (8) caprylic/capric mono- and diglycerides (e.g., Labrasol™ of Gattefosse), polyoxyethylene (35) castor oil and polyoxyethylene (40) hydrogenated 30      castor oil; polyoxyethylene alkyl ethers, for example polyoxyethylene (20) cetostearyl ether, polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, for example polyoxyethylene (40) stearate, polyoxyethylene sorbitan esters, for example polysorbate 20 and polysorbate 80 (e.g., Tween™ 80 of 1CI), propylene glycol fatty acid esters, for example propylene glycol<br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/US00/32435<br><br>
laurate (e.g., Lauroglycol™ of Gattefosse), sodium lauryl sulfate, fatty acids and salts thereof, for example oleic acid, sodium oleate and triethanolamine oleate, glyceryl fatty acid esters, for example glyceryl monostearate, sorbitan esters, for example sorbitan monolaurate, sorbitan monooleate, sorbitan monopalmitate and sorbitan 5      monostearate', tyloxapol, and mixtures thereof. Such wetting agents, if present, constitute in total about 0.25% to about 15%, preferably about 0.4% to about 10%, and more preferably about 0.5% to about 5%, of the total weight of the composition.<br>
Wetting agents that are anionic surfactants are preferred. Sodium lauryl sulfate is a particularly preferred wetting agent. Sodium lauryl sulfate, if present, 10     constitutes about 0.25% to about 7%, more preferably about 0.4% to about 4%, and still more preferably about 0.5% to about 2%, of the total weight of the composition. Compositions of the invention optionally comprise one or more . pharmaceutically acceptable lubricants (including anti-adherents and/or glidants) as excipients. Suitable lubricants include, either individually or in combination, glyceryl 15      behapate (e.g., Compritol™ 888); stearic acid and salts thereof, including magnesium, calcium and sodium stearates; hydrogenated vegetable oils (e.g., Sterotex™); colloidal silica.; talc; waxes; boric acid; sodium benzoate; sodium acetate; sodium fumarate; sodium chloride; DL-leucine; PEG (e.g., Carbowax™ 4000 and Carbowax™ 6000); sodium oleate; sodium lauryl sulfate; and magnesium lauryl 20     sulfate. Such lubricants, if present, constitute in total about 0.1% to about 10%,<br>
preferably about 0.2% to about 8%, and more preferably about 0.25% to about 5%, of the total weight of the composition.<br>
Magnesium stearate is a preferred lubricant used, for example, to reduce friction between the equipment and granulated mixture during compression of tablet 25      formulations.<br>
Suitable anti-adherents include talc, cornstarch, DL-leucine, sodium lauryl sulfate and metallic stearates. Talc is a preferred anti-adherent or glidant used, for example, to reduce formulation sticking to equipment surfaces and also to reduce static in the blend. Talc, if present, constitutes about 0.1% to about 10%, more 30     preferably about 0.25% to about 5%, and still more preferably about 0.5% to about 2%, of the total weight of the composition.<br>
Other excipients such as colorants, flavors and sweeteners are known in the pharmaceutical art and can be used in compositions of the present invention. Tablets<br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/US00/32435<br>
can be coated, for example with an enteric coating, or uncoated. Compositions of the invention can further comprise, for example, buffering agents.<br>
Optionally, one or more effervescent agents can be used as disintegrants and/or to enhance organoleptic properties of compositions of the invention. When 5      present in compositions of the invention to promote dosage form disintegration, one or more effervescent agents are preferably present in a total amount of about 30% to about 75%, and preferably about 45% to about 70%, for example about 60%, by weight of the composition.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, an<br>
10     effervescent agent, present in a solid dosage form in an amount less than that effective<br>
to promote disintegration of the dosage form, provides improved dispersion of the<br>
celecoxib in an aqueous medium. Without being bound by theory, it is believed that<br>
the effervescent agent is effective to accelerate dispersion of celecoxib from the<br>
dosage form in the gastrointestinal tract, thereby further enhancing absorption and<br>
15     rapid onset of therapeutic effect. When present in a pharmaceutical composition of<br>
the invention to promote intragaslrointestinal dispersion but not to enhance<br>
disintegration, one or more effervescent agents are preferably present in an amount of<br>
about 2.5% to about 15%, more preferably about 5% to about 10%, by weight of the<br>
composition.<br>
20	Suitable effervescent agents include, for example, either alone or in<br>
combination, sodium bicarbonate, anhydrous citric acid, tartaric acid and dibasic sodium phosphate. Sodium bicarbonate and anhydrous citric acid are preferred effervescent agents.<br>
Solid dosage forms of the invention can be prepared by any suitable process, 25      not limited to processes described herein.<br>
An illustrative process comprises (a) a step of blending amorphous celecoxib,<br>
a celecoxib drug substance, or a celecoxib-crystallization inhibitor composite of the<br>
invention with one or more excipients to form a blend, and (b) a step of tableting or<br>
encapsulating the blend to form tablets or capsules respectively.<br>
30	. In a preferred process, solid dosage forms are prepared by a process<br>
comprising (a) a step of blending amorphous celecoxib, a celecoxib drug substance, or a celecoxib-crystallization inhibitor composite of the invention with one or more excipients to form a blend, (b) a step of granulating the blend to form a granulate, and<br><br>
WO 01/42221<br><br>
PCT/USO0/32435<br><br>
(c) a step of tableting or encapsulating the blend to form tablets or capsules respectively. Step (b) can be accomplished by any dry or wet granulation technique known in the art, but is preferably a wet granulation step followed by a step of drying the resulting granulate prior to tableting or encapsulating. One or more diluents, one 5      or more disintegrants and one or more binding agents are preferably added, for<br>
example in the blending step, a wetting agent can optionally be added, for example in<br>
the granulating step, and one or more disintegrants are preferably added after<br>
granulating but before tableting or encapsulating. A lubricant is preferably added<br>
before tableting. Blending and granulating can be performed independently under low<br>
10     or high shear. A process is preferably selected that forms a granulate that is uniform<br>
in drug content, that readily disintegrates, that flows with sufficient ease so that<br>
weight variation can be reliably controlled during capsule filling or tableting, and that<br>
is dense enough in bulk so that a batch can be processed in the selected equipment and<br>
individual doses fit into the specified capsules or tablet dies.<br>
15	In an alternative embodiment, solid dosage forms are prepared by a process<br>
that includes a spray drying step, wherein the amorphous celecoxib, celecoxib drug<br>
substance or celecoxib-crystallization inhibitor composite is suspended with one or<br>
more excipients in one or more sprayable liquids, preferably a non-aqueous sprayable<br>
liquid, and then is rapidly spray dried over a current of warm air. This spray drying<br>
20     process for preparing a pharmaceutical composition can be performed in addition to<br>
any spray drying step used in preparation of a celecoxib-crystallization inhibitor<br>
composite as described hereinabove, but formation of the celecoxib-cryslallization<br>
inhibitor composite is preferably combined with a spray drying step for preparation of<br>
the pharmaceutical composition.<br>
25	A granulate or spray dried powder resulting from any of the above illustrative<br>
processes can be compressed or molded to prepare tablets or encapsulated to prepare<br>
capsules. Conventional tableting and encapsulation techniques known in the art can<br>
be employed. Where coated tablets are desired, conventional coating techniques are<br>
suitable.<br>
30	Excipients for tablet compositions of the invention are preferably selected to<br>
provide a disintegration time of less than about 30 minutes, preferably about 25<br>
minutes or less more preferably about 20 minutes or less, and still more preferably<br>
about 15 minutes or less, in a standard disintegration assay.<br>
	17<br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/US00/32435<br>
Any tablet hardness convenient with respect to handling, manufacture, storage<br>
and ingestion can be employed. For example, for 100 mg celecoxib tablets, hardness<br>
is preferably at least about 4 kP, more preferably at least about 5 kP, and still more<br>
preferably at bast about 6 kP. For 200 mg celecoxib tablets, hardness is preferably at<br>
5      least about 7 kP, more preferably at least about 9 kP, and still more preferably at least<br>
about 11 kP. The material to be tableted, however, should not be compressed to such<br>
a degree that there is subsequent difficulty in achieving hydration when exposed to<br>
gastric fluid.<br>
Tablet friability preferably is less than about 1.0%, more preferably less than<br>
10      0.8%, and still more preferably less than about 0.5% in a standard test.<br>
Celecoxib dosage<br>
Celecoxib dosage forms of the invention preferably comprise celecoxib in a daily dosage amount of about 10 mg to about 1000 mg, more preferably about 25 mg to about 400 mg, and most preferably about 50 mg to about 200 mg.<br>
15	Compositions of the invention comprise one or more orally deliverable dose<br>
units. Each dose unit comprises celecoxib in a therapeutically effective amount that is preferably about 10 mg to about 1000 mg. The term "dose unit" herein means a portion of a pharmaceutical composition that contains an amount of a therapeutic or prophylactic agent, in the present case celecoxib, suitable for a single oral<br>
20      administration to provide a therapeutic effect. Typically one dose unit, or a small plurality (up to about 4) of dose units, in a single administration provides a dose comprising a sufficient amount of the agent to result in the desired effect. Administration of such doses can be repeated as required, typically at a dosage frequency of 1 to about 4 times per day.<br>
25	It will be understood that a therapeutically effective amount of celecoxib for a<br>
subject is dependent inter alia on the body weight of the subject. A "subject" herein<br>
to which a therapeutic agent or composition thereof can be administered includes a<br>
human patient of either sex and of any age, and also includes any nonhuman animal,<br>
particularly a warm-blooded animal, more particularly a domestic or companion<br>
30      animal, illustratively a cat, dog or horse. When the subject is a child or a small animal<br>
{e.g., a dog), for example, an amount of celecoxib relatively low in the preferred range<br>
of about 10 mg to about 1000 mg is likely to provide blood serum concentrations<br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/USOO/32435<br>
consistent with therapeutic effectiveness. Where the subject is an adult human or a<br>
large animal {eg., a horse), achievement of such blood serum concentrations of<br>
celecoxib are likely to require dose units containing a relatively greater amount of<br>
celecoxib.<br>
5	Typical 'dose units in a composition of the invention contain about 10, 20, 25,<br>
37.5,50,75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 200, 250, 300, 350 or 400 mg of celecoxib. For an<br>
adult human, a therapeutically effective amount of celecoxib per dose unit in a<br>
composition of the present invention is typically about 50 mg to about 400 mg.<br>
Especially preferred amounts of celecoxib per dose unit are about 100 mg to about<br>
10     200 mg, for example about 100 mg or about 200 mg.<br>
A dose unit containing a particular amount of celecoxib can be selected to<br>
accommodate any desired frequency of administration used to achieve a desired daily<br>
dosage. The daily dosage and frequency of administration, and therefore the selection<br>
of appropriate dose unit, depends on a variety of factors, including the age, weight,<br>
15      sex and medical condition of the subject, and the nature and severity of the condition<br>
or disorder, and thus may vary widely.<br>
When administered orally to a fasting adult human, a 100 mg dose unit<br>
preferably exhibits a Tmax, of less than about 90 minutes, more preferably less than<br>
about 60 minutes and most preferably less than about 45 minutes, and a Cmax, of at<br>
20     least about 100 ng/ml, more preferably at least about 200 ng/ml. Typically a<br>
composition of the invention provides a blood serum concentration of celecoxib of at<br>
least about 50 ng/ml within 30 minutes of oral administration; preferred compositions<br>
achieve such a concentration in as little as 15 minutes. This early rise in blood serum<br>
concentration is believed to be associated with the rapid onset of therapeutic effect<br>
25      achieved by compositions of the present invention.<br>
The term foral administration" herein includes any form of delivery of a therapeutic agent or a composition thereof to a subject wherein the agent or composition is placed in the mouth of the subject, whether or not the agent or composition is immediately swallowed. Thus "oral administration" includes buccal<br>
30     and sublingual as well as esophageal administration. Absorption of the agent can<br>
occur in any part or parts of the gastrointestinal tract including the mouth, esophagus,<br>
stomach, duodenum, ileum and colon. The term "orally deliverable" herein means<br>
suitable for oral administration.<br><br><br>

Utility of compositions of the invention<br>
Compositions of the invention are useful in treatment and prevention of a very wide range of disorders mediated by COX-2, including but not restricted to disorders characterized by inflammation, pain and/or fever. Such compositions are especially 5     useful as anti-inflammatory agents, such as in treatment of arthritis, with the<br>
additional benefit of having significantly less harmful side effects than compositions of conventional nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) that lack selectivity for COX-2 over COX-1. In particular, compositions of the invention have reduced potential for gastrointestinal toxicity and gastrointestinal irritation including upper 10     gastrointestinal ulceration and bleeding, reduced potential for renal side effects such as reduction in renal function leading to fluid retention and exacerbation of hypertension, reduced effect on bleeding times including inhibition of platelet function, and possibly a lessened ability to induce asthma attacks in aspirin-sensitive asthmatic subjects, by comparison with compositions of conventional NSAIDs. Thus 15      compositions of the invention are particularly useful as an alternative to conventional NSAIDs where such NSAIDs are contraindicated, for example in patients with peptic ulcers, gastritis regional enteritis, ulcerative colitis, diverticulitis or with a recurrent history of gastrointestinal lesions; gastrointestinal bleeding, coagulation disorders including anemia such as hypoprothrombinemia, hemophilia or other bleeding 20     problems; kidney disease; or in patients prior to surgery or patients taking anticoagulants.<br>
Contemplated compositions are useful to treat a variety of arthritic disorders,<br>
including but not limited to rheumatoid arthritis, spondyloarthropathies, gouty<br>
arthritis, osteoarthritis, systemic lupus erythematosus and juvenile arthritis.<br>
25	Such compositions are useful in treatment of asthma, bronchitis, menstrual<br>
cramps, preterm labor, tendinitis, bursitis, allergic neuritis, cytomegalovirus infectivity, apop osis including HIV-induced apoptosis, lumbago, liver disease including hepatitis, skin-related conditions such as psoriasis, eczema, acne; bums, dermatitis and ultraviolet radiation damage including sunburn, and post-operative 30     inflammation including that following ophthalmic surgery such as cataract surgery or refractive surgery<br>
Such compositions are useful to treat gastrointestinal conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease, Crohn's disease, gastritis, irritable bowel syndrome and<br><br>
WO 01/42221       	PCT/US00/32435<br><br>
 ulcerative colitis.<br>
Such compositions are useful in treating inflammation in such diseases as migraine headaches, periarteritis nodosa, thyroiditis, aplastic anemia, Hodgkin's disease, sclerodoma, rheumatic fever, type I diabetes, neuromuscular junction disease 5      including myasthenia gravis, white matter disease including multiple sclerosis, sarcoidosis, nephrotic syndrome, Behcet's syndrome, polymyositis, gingivitis, nephritis, hypersensitivity, swelling occurring after injury including brain edema, myocardial ischemia, and the like.<br>
Such compositions are useful in treatment of ophthalmic diseases, such as 10     retinitis, conjunctivitis, retinopathies, uveitis, ocular photophobia, and of acute injury<br>
to the eye tissue.<br>
        Such compositions are useful in treatment of pulmonary inflammation, such as<br>
that associated with viral infections and cystic fibrosis, and in bone resorption such as<br>
that associated with osteoporosis.<br>
15	Such compositions are useful for treatment of certain central nervous system<br>
disorders, such as cortical dementias including Alzheimer's disease,<br>
neurodegenerarion, and central nervous system damage resulting from stroke,<br>
ischemia and trauma. The term "treatment" in the present context includes partial or<br>
total inhibition of dementias, including Alzheimer's disease, vascular dementia,<br>
20      multi-infarct dementia, pre-senile dementia, alcoholic dementia and senile dementia.<br>
Such compositions are useful in treatment of allergic rhinitis, respiratory<br>
distress syndrome, endotoxin shock syndrome and liver disease.<br>
Such compositions are useful in treatment of pain, including but not limited to<br>
postoperative pain, dental pain, muscular pain, and pain resulting from cancer. For<br>
25      example, such compositions are useful for relief of pain, fever and inflammation in a<br>
variety of conditions including rheumatic fever, influenza and other viral infections<br>
including common cold, low back and neck pain, dysmenorrhea, headache, toothache,<br>

15      Method of treatment<br>
The present invention is further directed to a therapeutic method of treating a<br>
condition or disorder where treatment with a COX-2 inhibitory drug is indicated, the<br>
method comprising oral administration of a composition of the invention to a subject<br>
in need thereof. The dosage regimen to prevent, give relief from, or ameliorate the<br>
20      condition or disorder preferably corresponds to once-a-day or twice-a-day treatment,<br>
but can be modified in accordance with a variety of factors. These include the type,<br>
age, weight, sex' diet and medical condition of the subject and the nature and severity<br>
of the disorder.  Thus, the dosage regimen actually employed can vary widely and can<br>
therefore deviate from the preferred dosage regimens set forth above.<br>
25	Initial treatment can begin with a dose regimen as indicated above. Treatment<br>
is generally continued as necessary over a period of several weeks to several months<br>
or years until the condition or disorder has been controlled or eliminated. Subjects<br>
undergoing treatment with a composition of the invention can be routinely monitored<br>
by any of the methods well known in the art to determine effectiveness of therapy.<br>
30      Continuous analysis of data from such monitoring permits modification of the<br>
treatment regimen during therapy so that optimally effective doses are administered at<br>
any point in time  and so that the duration of treatment can be determined. In this<br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/US00/32435<br>
way, the treatment regimen and dosing schedule can be rationally modified over the<br>
course of therapy so that the lowest amount of the composition exhibiting satisfactory<br>
effectiveness is administered, and so that administration is continued only for so long<br>
as is necessary to successfully treat the condition or disorder.<br>
5	The present compositions can be used in combination therapies with opioids<br>
and other analgesics, including narcotic analgesics, Mu receptor antagonists, Kappa receptor antagonists, non-narcotic (i.e. non-addictive) analgesics, monoamine uptake inhibitors, adenosine regulating agents, cannabinoid derivatives, Substance P antagonists, neurokinin-1 receptor antagonists and sodium channel blockers, among 10      others.

EXAMPLES<br>
1 0	The following examples illustrate aspects of the present invention but are not<br>
to be construed as limitations.<br>
Example 1<br>
A celecoxib drug substance C1 and celecoxib-polymer composites C3 and C4 were prepared by the following spray drying process. Celecoxib in crystalline form (a 15      celecoxib drug substance C2 of prior art) was added to a solvent, with stirring at a temperature of 70-75°C, to prepare solutions S1, S3 and S4 having the composition shown in Table 1,. Solutions S1 and S4 were prepared in 95% ethanol. Solution S3 was prepared in 70% isopropanol.<br><br>
20	Each of solutions S1, S3 and S4 was spray dried individually at room<br>
temperature using a Yamato GB-21 spray dryer to form powders C1, C3 and C4, respectively, under the following conditions: (a) liquid flow rate of 10 ml/min; (b) inlet air temperature of 115°C; (c) outlet air temperature of 75°C, and (d) drying<br>
airflow of 3.75 TMF. Powders C3 and C4 are celecoxib-polymer composites of the<br>
25      invention, each comprising 67% celecoxib and 33% polymer.<br>
Example 2<br>
A celecoxib drug substance C10 was prepared by the following melt/quench cool process.<br><br>
PCT/US00/32435 WO 01/42221<br>
Approximately 5 g of crystalline celecoxib (the prior art celecoxib dmg<br>
substance C2) was weighed into a metal foil tray and placed in an oven at 180°C for 5<br>
minutes to melt the celecoxib. This was then quench cooled by floating the foil tray<br>
containing the melted celecoxib on liquid nitrogen, resulting in the formation of<br>
5     celecoxib drug substance C10 of the present invention. This drug substance could be<br>
gently ground by mortar and pestle to produce a celecoxib drug substance powder.<br>
Example 3<br>
Powder X-ray diffraction (PXRD) analysis was used to determine the relative crystalline and amorphous celecoxib content of celecoxib drug substance C1 and 10     celecoxib-polymer composites C3 and C4 as prepared in Example 1, by comparison with crystalline celecoxib drug substance C2. Data were collected using a Scintag Advanced Diffraction System operating under Scintag DMS/NT software. This system uses a peltier cooled solid stale detector and a copper X-ray source maintained at 45 kV and 40 mA to provide CuKa, emission at 1.5406 A. The beam aperture was 15      controlled using tube divergence and anti-scatter slits of 2 and 4 mm respectively, while the detector anti-scatter and receiving slits were set at 0.5 and 0.3 mm respectively. Data were collected from 2° to 35° two-theta (20) Using a scan step of 0.03°/point and a one second/point integration time. The samples were prepared using Scintag round top-loading stainless steel sample cups, and were fitted with 20      12 mm diameter aluminum inserts to accommodate small sample volumes.<br>
The resu ts of the PXRD analyses are shown as bands in Figs. 1 -3. The appearance of larger, spiked peaks on a band indicates crystallinity whereas compressed peaks are indicative of amorphous material.<br>
Fig. 1 shows that celecoxib alone (with no polymer) spray dried from an 25      ethanol solution (C1) produced a strong crystalline signal similar to that of a<br>
crystalline celecoxib control (C2). If there is an amorphous component in celecoxib drug substance Cl it is a minor component.<br>
Fig. 2 shows that when celecoxib was spray dried with HPMC (2:1 ratio by weight), the resulting celecoxib-polymer composite C3 was initially (at time T1) non-30      crystalline, i.e., the celecoxib in this composite was substantially phase pure<br>
amorphous celecoxib. When analysis was conducted on a sample that had been stored for two weeks at 40°C and 75% relative humidity (at time T2), some recrystallization<br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/US00/32435<br>
had occurred as indicated by presence of crystalline peaks.<br>
iFig. 3 shows that when celecoxib was spray dried with povidone (2:1 ratio by weight) the resulting celecoxib-polymer composite C4 was initially (at time T1) non¬crystalline, i.e\, the celecoxib in this composite was substantially phase pure 5      amorphous celecoxib. When analysis was conducted on a sample that had been stored for two weeks at 40°C and 75% relative humidity (at time T2), essentially no recrystallization had occurred, as indicated by absence of crystalline peaks.<br>
Example 4<br>
Differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) was used to determine relative 10      crystalline and amorphous celecoxib content of celecoxib drug substance CI and celecoxib-polymer composites C3 and C4 as prepared in Example 1. DSC was performed using a TA Instruments DSC 2920 differential scanning calorimeter with parameters set as follows: (a) temperature range of 50-200°C; (b) heating rate of 2°C/min, modulating ± 0.5°C every 30 sec; (c) sample size of 3 mg; (d) hermetically 15      sealed aluminum pans.<br>
Figs. 4-6 show DSC thermograms for the spray dried powders of Example 1. Fig. 4 displays a thermogram for celecoxib drug product C1, exhibiting a large melting endotherm at 159.4°C (onset) with an area of 96.42 J/g. No other transitions are evident. The magnitude of the endotherm suggests that a substantial portion of C1 20      was crystalline. Any amorphous celecoxib present in the sample was not detectable<br>
by this technique.<br>
Fig. 5 displays a thermogram for celecoxib-polymer composite C3 (2:1<br>
celecoxib:HPMC ratio). This material exhibits an apparent glass transition at 122.9°C<br>
(onset), followed by a small melting endotherm at 150.1°C with an area of 4.379 J/g.<br>
25     The endotherm indicates that most of the celecoxib in C3 is amorphous, but that a<br>
small amount of crystalline celecoxib is present.<br>
Fig. 6 displays a thermogram for celecoxib-polymer composite C4 (2:1<br>
celecoxib:povidone ratio). This material exhibits an apparent glass transition at<br><br>
111.4°C (onset)<br><br>
No other transitions are evident, indicating that the material is<br><br>
30     substantially phase pure amorphous celecoxib.<br>
Example 5	<br>
DSC wasjalso used to determine relative crystalline and amorphous content of<br><br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/US00/32435<br>
celecoxib drug substance C10 prepared as in Example 2. DSC was performed using a TA Instruments MDSC differential scanning calorimeter at a scan rate of 5°C/min. A first significant thermal event was observed at about 54°C, representing a glass transition temperature indicative of amorphous celecoxib. An exothermic peak 5      observed at  00-105°C was consistent with a crystallization event and represents conversion of amorphous celecoxib to a crystalline state. As was shown by the presence of a endothermic peak, the resulting crystalline celecoxib melted at about 165°C.<br>
Example 6<br>
10	Tablets having the composition shown in Table 2 were prepared from<br>
celecoxib-polymer composite C4 by the following procedure. Composite C4, sodium lauryl sulfate and effervescent agents (citric acid and sodium bicarbonate) were admixed and milled for 10 min in a McCrone mill to form a powder mixture. The powder mixture was ground together with lactose, microcrystalline cellulose and<br>
15      sodium starch glycolate using a mortar and pestle to form a ground powder mixture. The ground powder mixture was then compressed using a Carver press to form tablets, which are illustrative of a pharmaceutical composition of the invention.<br>
Table 2. Composition of tablets prepared from celecoxib-polymer composite C4<br><br>
Example 7<br>
20	Tablets prepared as described in Example 6 were compared with a crystalline<br><br>
celecoxib capsule in an in vivo bioavailability assay in dogs. In a crossover design, each of six beagle dogs received a 200 mg dose of celecoxib in the form of the tablet composition of Example 6, and then after a washout period, the dogs each received a 200 mg dose of celecoxib in the form of a commercial Celebrex® 200 mg capsule,<br>
25      which contains celecoxib entirely in crystalline form. Blood plasma was collected<br><br><br>
WO 01/42221	PCT/USOO/32435<br>
pre-dose and at 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1,1.5, 2, 3, 5, 8 and 24 hours post-dose. Celecoxib concentrations in plasma were measured using liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry. Cmax, Tmax and AUC (area under the curve, a measure of total bioavailability) were calculated from the data in accordance with standard procedure 5      in the art. Mean results for all dogs are shown in Table 3.<br>
The tablet of Example 6 prepared from amorphous celecoxib exhibited a significantly greater Cmax, (maximum blood plasma concentration), a comparable Tmax, and a significantly greater AUC than the capsule formulated from crystalline celecoxib. As a measure of relative onset time, the time taken for the tablet of the 10     invention to reach a plasma concentration equal to the Cmax, of the crystalline celecoxib capsule was only 0.5 hour, by comparison with 1.2 hours (the Tmax for the crystalline celecoxib capsule).<br><br><br>
