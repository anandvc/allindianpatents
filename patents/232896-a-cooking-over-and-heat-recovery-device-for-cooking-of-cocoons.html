				<td>This  invention  relates  to  a  cooking/heat recovery device -for the cooking of cocoons.<br>
The coocoons are cooked in the cooking oven for recovery of the silk yarn therefrom. The cooking oven and heat recovery drum for cottage basin is known in the art for cooking the cocoon. The device comprises a plurality of cooking pot for containing water and cocoons to be cooked. The heating of water contained in the cooking pots is effected by using wood as fuel. A drum is provided with the structure on which cooking pots are supported so as to utilise the heat from the flue gases for heating water. The hot water in the drum is used to make up the level of water in the pots manually.<br>
There are certain disadvantages associated with the known cooking/heat recovery device. One of the main disadvantage is that there is no control of the temperature in the cooking pots.<br>
Another disadvantage is that the complete? heat energy is not utilized and wasted in the form of flue gases.<br>
Yet another disadvantage is that due to the burning of wood, pollution is caused to the environment.<br>
Still another disadvantage is that there is no control in the quality of production of the silk yarn due to variation in the temperature of the different cooking pats.<br>
There-fare the main object of the present invention is to propose a cooking oven and heat recovery device which obviatss the disadvantage associated with the prior art.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose a cooking overs and heat recovery device wherein the complete heat energy is utilised by the heat recovery uni t.<br>
Yet another object of this invention is to propose a cooking oven and heat recovery device wherein no environmental pollution is caused as the wood is converted in the form of producer gas by using a gasifier.<br>
Still another object of this invention is to propose a cooking/heat recovery device wherein the cooking temperature in the cooking pots is maintained uniformly.<br>
According to this invention there is provided a cooking oven and heat recovery device for cooking of cocoons characterized in that a plurality of perforated cooking pots supported on a common bath, a burner adapted to be connected with a gasifier being provider for heating said common bath, a heat recovery unit being provided adjoining 1.0 the cooking bath so as to utilize the heat energy entrapped in the flue gases, a level control means being provided with the said cooking bath to control the level of the water in the cooking bath, a gasifier being provided on one side oi said common bath for producing and supplying producer gases to said burner.<br>
In accordance with this invent 0:1 the cooking oven and heat; recovery-device comprises a plurality of perforated cooking ports supported on a common cooking bath. A burner ade.p:ed to be connected with a gasifier is provided below the common bath for heating the liquid medium /water contained in the bath. The burner is disposed within a sealed chamber having the common bath and heat recovery unit supported thereon and being extended into said chamber to recover the heat energy from the flue gases passing through the heat recovery unit. Level control means for example fiot valve is provided with the common wa e:- bath for maintaining the<br>
level  of water in the common water bath  automatically. A  gasifier is provided on one side of the  common  bath far  producing producer gases by burning  wood  therein. The producer gas is supplied to the burner through a gas conveyer pipe?.<br>
The gasifier according to this invention has a metallic cylindrical reactor having a -feeding hopper provided on the1 top &amp;nd of the reactor. The combustion and reduction zone o-f the reactor is provided with line refractories. An inlet is provided to supply the air into the combustion zone, required -for producing the producer gastss. Grate- shaking means are provided for shaking the grate of the gasi-fier BO as to remove the ash contents therefrom. An ash pit. tank is provided below the reactor for converting the ash into charcoal.<br>
A  cooking/heat  recovery device  according  to  a preferred embodiment is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein: Fig.l      shows the eluvational view of the device of<br>
this invention; Fig.2       shows  the  sectional view  of  the  present<br>
invention;<br>
Fig.3       shows  the  top view  of   the  cooking/heat recovery system; and<br>
Fig.4      shows  the  system  according  to   another embodiment.<br>
Referring to the drawings particularly fig.l the cooking/heat recovery device of this invention has a plurality of perforated cooking pots 1 supported on a common cooking bath 2. A burner 3 adapted to be connected with a gasifier 4 through a gas conveyaning pipe 5 is provided below the common cooking bath 2. for heating the liquid medium/water contained in the cooking bath 2. The burner 3 is disposed within a sealed chamber 6 having the common bath 2 and heat recovery unit 7 supported thereon and being extended into said chamber 6. The heat recovery unit 7 is provided to recover the heat, energy from the flew gases passing therethrough. A level control means for example a Hot valve 8 is provided with the common water bath 2 for maintaing the water level in the water bath by supplying the water automatically from the heat recovery unit 7. A temperature indicator 9 is provided with the heat recovery unit to show the temperature of the unit. The gasifier is provided on one side of the chamber &amp; for producing and supplying producer gas by burning fuel like wood therein.<br>
Reference is now made to fig.2.  The heat recovery<br>
unit comprises a plurality of pipes 10 made of stainless steel tubes, disposed into an insulated drum 11 o-f any shape (cylinderical shape) and for conveying -flew gases therethrough. The drum 11 is provided -for containg liquid medium/water therein. A water inlet 12 is provided to supply water into the drum 11. A drain 13 is provided near the bottom of the drum 11 to drain out water therefrom as and when required. A gaze glass 14 is provided near the top end of the drum 11 to indicate the water level in the drum. A sliding dom 15 having A chimney 16 therewith is mounted over the top end of the drum 11 far facilitating the exit of the flew gases.<br>
The gasifier 4 according to this invention has a metallic cylindrical reactor 17 having a feeding hopper 18 provided thereon. The combustion/reaction zone of the reactor 17 is provided with the line refractories <not shown an inlet is provided to supply the air into combustion zone required for producing producer gas. supplied by means of a blower pipe in burner facilitating burning ash pit tank below reaction converting received from gasifier charcoal.></not>
Reference  is  now  made  to  fig.4  wherein   the<br>
cooking/heat, recovery system is of the same construction as shown in fig.2 except the construction of the heat recovery unit 7. As shown in fig.4 the heat recovery unit comprises heat recovery drum 21 of any shape preferably of cylinderical shape disposed in an insultated outer chamber 22 in a spaced relationship with the insulated chamber 22 so as to provide a passage 23 therebetween for the passage of the flue? a,asses therethrough.<br><br><br><br><br>
