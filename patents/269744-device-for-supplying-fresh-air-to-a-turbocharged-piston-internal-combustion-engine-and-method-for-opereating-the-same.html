Device for supplying fresh air to a turbocharged<br>
piston internal combustion engine and method for<br>
operating the same<br>
The invention relates to a device for supplying fresh<br>
air to a turbocharged piston internal combustion engine<br>
having a fresh gas line section as an intake manifold<br>
which has an adjustable flap and a first end port for<br>
flowing in and a second end port for flowing out,<br>
between which ports a pivotably mounted shaft for the<br>
adjustable flap is provided in the tubular wall, said<br>
flap being coupled to an adjustment device for the<br>
purpose of adjustment, a compressed air port with an<br>
opening leading into the tubular interior between the<br>
flap and the second end port.<br>
in addition, the invention also relates to a method for<br>
operating such a device.<br>
It is a known property of piston internal combustion<br>
engine with turbocharging that when the throttle is<br>
opened in the vehicle it reacts only with a certain<br>
degree of delay because the turbocharger can increase<br>
the supplied air quantity only slowly, which is known<br>
as a turbolag in the torque profile.<br>
DE-PS-39 06 312 discloses a method and structure for<br>
reducing or shortening the turbolag, in which case,<br>
while the diesel engine is accelerating a specific<br>
quantity of air is blown into the intake manifold from<br>
a compressed air accumulator, and the fuel injection<br>
quantity is. adapted to this. The turbocharged diesel<br>
engine is suitable particularly for town buses with an<br>
automatic transmission and compressed air brake system.<br>
The town buses perform a certain travel cycle by being<br>
able to predict the load and the rotational speed<br>
process of the diesel engine precisely, and in this way<br>
the blow-in time and the air quantity can be<br>
predetermined. The conditions with utility motor<br><br>
WO 2006/089779			- 2 - 	PCT/EP2006/001737<br>
vehicles which are used in long distance traffic are<br>
quite different. These vehicles do not have any regular<br>
travel cycles and the payload varies within wide limits<br>
and the driving style of the driver can exhibit large<br>
differences. The above structure and method cannot<br>
eliminate these problems.<br>
Patent Abstracts of Japan, Vol. 1995, No. 07, August<br>
31, 1995 and JP 07091267 A discloses a device for fresh<br>
air supply for a turbocharged piston internal<br>
combustion engine having a fresh air line section as an<br>
intake manifold. Here too, a flap is coupled to an<br>
adjustment device. In this known device it is, however,<br>
not ensured that sufficient compressed air remains in<br>
the compressed air store at any time for the other<br>
aggregates, such as braking system, as well.<br>
The object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
device and a method with which the blowing in of air<br>
can be adapted to the driving style and payload of the<br>
vehicle and at the same time the device can be<br>
installed as one mounted unit in various fresh gas line<br>
systems of diesel engines.<br>
The object is achieved on the basis of a device<br>
according to the preamble of claim 1 in conjunction<br>
with its characterizing features. In terms of method<br>
technology, the object is achieved by means of claim 5.<br>
The respectively referred back independent claims<br>
represent advantageous developments of the invention.<br>
The advantage of the invention results from the fact<br>
that a flap in the fresh gas line is activated under<br>
electronic control, that is to say not only<br>
automatically by the fresh gas pressure, as according<br>
to the prior art mentioned at the beginning, and that<br>
the activation is determined and processed<br>

flap and the first end port for flowing in; output of<br>
the second pressure pickup whose pressure meter is<br>
arranged in the tubular interior between the flap and<br>
the second end port for flowing out.<br>
According to one advantageous embodiment of the<br>
invention, in the electronic control unit, the torque<br>
request signal can originate from the following<br>
sources: accelerator pedal, traction controller, cruise<br>
controller, electric stability program, driving<br>
assistance system or other systems which feed an<br>
external torque request to the engine control system.<br><br>

the acceleration behavior and emission behavior of a<br>
vehicle piston internal combustion engine, in<br>
particular of a diesel engine with turbocharging, the<br>
device of which which has the purpose of supplying<br>

The invention will be presented in detail below by<br>
means of an exemplary embodiment of a diesel engine and<br>
using drawings, in which:<br>

section seen from the end of the inflow,<br>
fig. 4 is an axonometric image of the fresh gas line<br>
section seen from the end of the outflow, and<br>
fig. 5 shows an axonometric image of the fresh gas<br>
line section seen from above.<br>
According to fig. 1, the turbocharged diesel engine 2<br>
has six cylinders 3 in series, the intake lines 4 of<br>
which are connected to a collecting line 5 which has a<br>
connecting flange 7 to which a fresh gas line section 8<br>
is connected by its second end port 9 for flowing out.<br>
The first end port 10 for flowing in is coupled by a<br>
line 11 to the outflow opening 12 of the charge air<br>
cooler 13 whose inflow opening 14 is coupled by a line<br>
15 to the outflow opening 16 of the turbocompressor 17.<br>
An air filter 19 is connected to the inflow opening 18<br>
of the turbocompressor 17 using the line 20. The<br>
turbocompressor 17 forms part of the exhaust gas<br>
turbocharger 22 whose exhaust gas turbine 23 is<br>
connected by its inflow opening 24 to the outflow<br><br>
WO 2006/089779	- 6 - 	PCT/EP2006/001737<br>
opening 25 of the exhaust collecting pipe 26. The<br>
turbocompressor 17 and the exhaust gas turbine 23 are<br>
attached to the shaft 21. The cylinders 3 are connected<br>
by exhaust lines 27 to the exhaust collecting pipe 26.<br>
The outflow opening 28 of the exhaust gas turbine 23 is<br>
coupled to the exhaust pipe 29.<br>
The fuel supply to the cylinders 3 is provided by the<br>
injection nozzles 30 which are regulated by the line 31<br>
from the first output 32 of the electronic control unit<br>
38. The output 34 of the electronic control unit 33 is<br>
connected by the line 36 to the input 37 of the<br>
electronic control unit 38. The control unit 33 is<br>
provided with an activation element which is embodied<br>
in this exemplary embodiment as an accelerator pedal<br>
35. The electric terminal 39 of the electronic control<br>
unit 38 is coupled to the electric terminal 41 of the<br>
fresh gas line section 8 by the collecting line 40.<br>
The fresh gas line section 8 has a compressed air port<br>
42 which is connected by the line 43 to the outlet port<br>
44 of the compressed air vessel 45. The feed port 46 of<br>
the compressed air vessel 45 is connected by the line<br>
47 to the compressed air port 48 of the compressed air<br>
compressor 49. The pressure regulator 50 and air dryer<br>
51 are installed in the line 47. The compressed air<br>
compressor 49 has an intake connector 52 which is<br>
provided with an air filter 53. The shaft 54 of the<br>
compressed air compressor 49 is connected to the main<br>
shaft 56 of the turbocharged diesel engine by the belt<br>
drive 55.<br>
Fig. 2 shows the fresh gas line section 8 in detail,<br>
said fresh gas line section 8 being embodied in a<br>
tubular fashion and having the first end port 10 and<br>
the second end port 9 between which there is an<br>
interior 57 which has a circular cross section. The<br>
interior 57 is enclosed before the wall 58 in which the<br><br>
WO 2006/089779	- 7 - 	PCT/EP2006/001737<br>
shaft 59 of a flap 60 is mounted and lead through. The<br>
flap 60 divides the interior 57 into two parts,<br>
specifically the inflow space 61 which is produced<br>
between the first end port 10 and the flap 60, and the<br>
outlet space 62 which is produced between the second<br>
end port 9 and the flap 60. The flap 60 has one closed<br>
position and one fully opened position and any desired<br>
number of positions therebetween which are set by<br>
rotating the shaft 59. The adjustment device 66 is<br>
embodied in this exemplary embodiment as an electric<br>
motor and is equipped with an electric adjustment<br>
device input 74 and an output 65 which are<br>
correspondingly connected to the terminals of the<br>
collecting line 40 of the electronic control unit 38.<br>
The adjusting device 66 is supplied with current by the<br>
adjustment device input 74. The signal is obtained from<br>
the output 65 by means of the position of the flap 60.<br>
A compressed air inflow opening 67 is formed between<br>
the second end port 9 and the flap 60 in the wall 58,<br>
and the compressed air port 42 which is equipped with a<br>
quantity regulating device 68 is connected thereto. The<br>
quantity regulating device 68 also has a fully blocked<br>
position. The electric control input 69 of the quantity<br>
regulating device 68 which has a valve 70 is connected<br>
to the collecting line 40 of the electronic control<br>
unit 38.<br>
Similarly, the output 71 of the pressure pickup 72<br>
which is attached to the wall 58, the pressure meter 73<br>
of the pressure pickup 72 which extends into the<br>
outflow space 62 of the fresh gas line section 8 and a<br>
similar output 71 of the pressure pickup 72 which is<br>
attached to the wall 58 as well as the pressure meter<br>
73 of the pressure pickup 72 which extends into the<br>
inflow space 61 are connected to the collecting line 40<br>
of the electronic control unit 38.<br><br>
WO 2006/089779	- 8 - 	PCT/EP2006/001737<br>
The arrangement 1 functions as follows: the cylinders<br>
of the turbocharged diesel engine are fed with fresh<br>
gas through the intake lines 4, collecting line 5,<br>
fresh gas line section 8, line 11, charge air cooler<br>
13, line 15, turbocompressor 17 and air filter 19 if<br>
the rotational speed is constant. The exhaust gases<br>
leave the cylinders 3 through the exhaust lines 27,<br>
exhaust collecting pipe 26, exhaust gas turbine 23 and<br>
exhaust pipe 29.<br>
When the driver depresses the accelerator pedal 35<br>
quickly so that the torque or engine speed is to be<br>
increased quickly, the turbocharged diesel engine 2<br>
requires more fuel and more fresh gas. The additional<br>
fuel is fed into the cylinder 3 but the increase in the<br>
fresh gas quantity which is supplied by the exhaust gas<br>
turbocharger 22 remains insufficient. The pressure of<br>
the fresh gas is also low and it is continuously<br>
measured in the interior 57 by means of the pressure<br>
meter 73 and is fed to the electronic control unit 3 8<br>
by the pressure pickup 72. In this operating state, the<br>
flap 60 is completely opened. The electronic control<br>
unit 38 will determine that the pressure is not<br>
increasing quickly enough in the interior 57, and<br>
determines, according to the control program, that<br>
additional air is to be blown in.<br>
The control program has predetermined specifications<br>
about the conditions when the air blowing in process is<br>
to start. At the start, the flap 60 is turned in the<br>
closing direction and the blowing in of compressed air<br>
from the compressed air vessel .45 into the outflow<br>
space 62 is enabled. The duration of the air blowing in<br>
process is also predefined by the control program which<br>
takes into account the pressure difference and the<br>
absolute pressure, which has been measured by the<br>
pressure meters 73.<br><br>
WO 2006/089779	- 9 - 	PCT/EP2006/001737<br>
Any professional long distance driver or bus driver has<br>
his own driving style which requires average<br>
acceleration values, he uses specific shifting points<br>
of the transmission whose characteristic values can be<br>
determined, stored and worked out. This is carried out<br>
in the computing system of the electronic control unit<br>
38 and used by software for the duration of the air<br>
blowing in process and activation of the flap at the<br>
electronic control unit 38. The software is intended to<br>
prevent the consumption of air from the vessel 45 from<br>
being so high that it adversely affects the braking<br>
safety since the vessel 45 is part of the entire<br>
compressed air system in which the most important part<br>
with respect to safety is the brake system.<br>
Nevertheless, an abrupt change in the acceleration<br>
assistance is not acceptable.<br>
This object is achieved in principle by virtue of the<br>
fact that the duration of the air blowing in process<br>
and activation of the flap is regulated in an adapative<br>
fashion by the frequency of the driver's request by the<br>
control software. As a result, the consumption of air<br>
is kept within certain limits but without an abrupt<br>
change in the duration of the air blowing in process.<br>
This avoids the driver sensing an unexpected change,<br>
i.e. reduction, in the acceleration assistance.<br><br>
