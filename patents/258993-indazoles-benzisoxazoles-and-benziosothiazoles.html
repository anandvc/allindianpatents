them. pharmaceutical compositions and use as estroqenic agents<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to non steroidal compounds with affinity for<br>
estrogen receptors. More specifically, the invention relates to indazole,<br>
benzisoxazole and benzisothiazole compounds as estrogen receptor subtype<br>
modulators and/or selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERM). The present<br>
invention also relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing these<br>
compounds, and to the use of these compounds in the treatment of<br>
estrogen-related diseases.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The end of the reproductive years of a person's life can often be accompanied by<br>
uncomfortable and disruptive symptoms, one of the most common of which is<br>
hoţ flushes. Perimenopause, or premenopause, is the period of years in which<br>
normal ovulatory cycles give way to cessation of menses. This time is marked by<br>
irregular menstrual cycles. Cycle length begins to increase, and ovulation and<br>
fertility decrease. Menopause is typically defmed as the point, after the loss of<br>
ovarian activity, when permanent cessation of menstruation occurs. In addition,<br>
estrogens are involved in various other physiological processes such as the<br>
modulation of the immune response and development of cancer (breast,<br>
endometrium, colon, prostate). ERa has been proven to be implicated in several<br>
diseases, such as breast cancer, and osteoporosis.<br>
It is well established that estrogens play an important role in the development<br>
and homeostasis of the reproductive, central nervous, skeletal and cardiovascular<br>
systems in both males and females. To date, a plethora of estrogen receptors<br>
have been discovered in the brain, involved in various processes such as mood,<br>
temperatura regulation, sleep, susceptibility to seizure, pain mechanism, and<br>
cognitive functions (Toran-Allerand, Endocrinology, 2004,145, 1069-1074).<br>
Currently, the estrogen receptor (ER) is a nuclear receptor with two known<br>
different subtypes. A new subtype ERp, different from the known ERoc subtype<br>
(Green, Nature, 1986, 320, 134-139), was recently discovered (Mosselman et al,<br>
FEBS Letters, 1996, 392, 49-53). These subtypes have different biologica! roles<br>
and may have selective and effective clinical uses (Harris H. A., Endocrinology,<br>
2002, 143, 11, 4172-4177). ER subtypes share about 50% identity in the ligandbinding<br>
domain (Kuiper et al, Endocrinology, 1998, 139(10), 4252-4263), they<br>
have similar Estradiol (E2) binding affinities and can hetero- or homodimerize<br>
(Cowley, J Biol Chem, 1997, 272, 19858-19862) to form a signalling complex<br>
(Kuiper et al, Endocrinology, 1997, 138(10), 863-870; Kuiper, Proc. Natl. Acad.<br>
Sci. USA, 1996, 93, 5925-5930). ERp is strongly expressed in a number of tissues<br>
including prostate epithelium (Weihua Z, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2001, 98,<br>
6330-6335), sympathetic ganglia (Zoubina E. V., J. Urol., 2003, 169, 382-385),<br>
colon (Witte D., Hum. Pathol., 2001, 32, 940-944), bladder, ovarian granulosa<br>
cells (Nilsson S., Physiol. Rev., 2001, 81, 1535-1565), bone marrow (Shim G. J.,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2003, 100, 6694-6699), breast stroma (Cunha G. R.,<br>
J. Mammary Gland Biol. Neoplasia, 1997, 2, 393-402), lung, intestine, vascular<br>
endothelium, dorsal raphe, parts of the brain (Mitra S. W., Endocrinology, 2003,<br>
144, 2055-2067, Krel W., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 2001, 98, 12278-12282).<br>
ERa is expressed in breast epithelium (Palmieri C., Endocr. Reiat. Cancer, 2002,<br>
9, 1-13), uterus, bone, ovary theca cells (Couse J., Endocr. Rev., 1999, 20,<br>
358-417), prostate stroma (Chu S., Mol. Cell Endocrinei., 1997, 132, 195-199),<br>
liver, testis. The finding of compounds with a specific affinity for one or the other<br>
subtypes could provide a selective treatment of estrogen-related diseases such<br>
as Alzheimer's disease, menopausal complaints (e.g. hoţ flushes, vaginal dryness,<br>
atrophy), cognitive functions (e.g. anxiety, depression, dementia), osteoporosis,<br>
estrogen dependant tumours (uterine, breast, colon, or prostate cancers), benign<br>
prostatic hyperplasia, bladder control, hearing disorders, stroke, leukaemia,<br>
hypertension, obesity, irritable bowel syndrome, or reproductive aspecte such as<br>
contraception or infertility. ERp-selective ligands may be therapeutically useful<br>
agente to treat chronic intestinal and joint inflammation (Harris et coli.,<br>
Endocrinology, 2003, 144, 4241-4249).<br>
According to Warembourg M and Leroy D (Brain Res., 2004, 26; 55-66), ER|3 was<br>
only detected within the rât dorsal raphe nucleus. In contrast, only<br>
ERoc-immunoreactivity was seen in the septum, and in the magnocellular<br>
supraoptic, paraventricular, arcuate, and premammillary nuclei. These<br>
observations provide evidence of a distinct neuroanatomical pattern for the two<br>
subtypes of the ERs. Localisation of ERp in serotonin cells show the link between<br>
ERp and the serotoninergic pathway. Finally, Cyr M et al. described (J Psychiatry<br>
Neurosci., 2002, 27, 12-27) the effect of a selective estrogen receptor modulator<br>
(SERM) such as raloxifen on 5-HT2a receptor.<br>
In conclusion it seems to be relevant to develop ERp modulators as compounds<br>
of interest in the field of schizophrenia, neurodegenerative diseases such a<br>
Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease. For the same reasons, ERp<br>
modulators should be of interest as neuroprotective, antidepressant or anxiolytic<br>
agents.<br>
However, the two receptors which act as ligand activated transcription factors,<br>
were found in a variety of tissues, and differed in their binding pocket only by<br>
two amino acids: Leu and Met in ERoc, Met and Ile in ERp. Those similarities<br>
could explain that the control of the subtype alpha or beta led to the same<br>
pharmacological effect, as it is the case in preclinical model of hoţ flush<br>
phenomena. While ERa modulator decreased the occurrence of hoţ flushes in a<br>
rât preclinical model (Harris et al., Endocrinology, 2002, 143, 4172-4177),<br>
selective estrogen receptor modulators such as spiroindene compounds, which<br>
were affine for both subtypes, hâd the same effect on hoţ flushes (Watanabe et<br>
al., J Med Chem, 2003, 46, 3961-3964).<br>
It has also been shown that estrogen receptors can suppress NFKB-mediated<br>
transcription in both a ligand-dependent and independent manner (Quaedackers,<br>
et al., Endocrinology 2001,142: 1156-1166; Bhat, et al., Journal of Steroid<br>
Biochemistry &amp; Molecular Biology 1998, 67: 233-240; Peizer, et al., Biochemical &amp;<br>
Biophysical Research Communications 2001, 286: 1153-7). These data show the<br>
link between selective estrogen receptor modulators and NFKB which is<br>
implicated in apoptosis and immune/inflammatory response.<br>
Many compounds nave been described as estrogen receptor agonists or<br>
antagonists as they respectively hâd a similar activity or blocked the activity of<br>
estradiol. Such agonist compounds could be used as contraceptive agents in<br>
premenopausal women. Antagonists are widely used therapeutic agents in the<br>
treatment of breast cancer (Vogel, Anticancer Drugs, 2003, 14, 265-273)<br>
whereas agonists are used in HRT (Mormone Replacement Therapy) in post<br>
menauposal women (Burkman, Minerva Ginecol, 2003, 55, 107-116) to treat hoţ<br>
flushes, vaginal atrophy. SERMs are compounds that present mixed activities<br>
depending on the tissue (McDonnell, J Soc Gynecol Invest, 2000, 7, S10-S15).<br>
SERMs might have utility for the treatment of osteoporosis, cardiovascular<br>
diseases and related estrogen receptor diseases.<br>
Estrogen receptors adopt different conformations when binding ligands.<br>
Three-dimensional structures of ERoc and ER|3 have been solved by cocrystallisation<br>
with various ligands (Pike A. C. W., EMBO J, 1999, 18, 4608-4618;<br>
Shiau A. K., Cell, 1998, 95, 927-937). Each ligand influences receptor ERoc or ERp<br>
conformations, leading to distinct biological activities.<br>
Various compounds presented as estrogenic agents have been described in US<br>
2003/0207927 Al and US 2003/0171412 Al. Indazole derivatives presented as<br>
potassium channel blockers are described in WO 2004/043354 and<br>
WO 2004/043933. The synthesis of various isoxazoles is described in Ind J Chem<br>
1980, 19B: 571-575. Benzisoxazole intermediates used in the preparation of<br>
diuretic compounds are described in Chem Pharm Bull 1991, 39(7): 1760-1772.<br>
The synthesis of various benzisothiazoles is described in Tetrahedron 1988,<br>
44(10): 2985-2992.<br>

In view of their capability to act as agonists or antagonist for estrogen receptors<br>
(in other words as SERMs), the compounds of the invention can be used alone or<br>
in combination with other active ingredients for the treatment or the prevention<br>
of any estrogen-dependent disorder or for the management of estrogenregulated<br>
reproductive functions, in humans (Njar VC and Brodie AM, Drugs,<br>
1999, 58: 233-255) as well as in wild or domestic animals.<br>
The breasts being sensitive targets of estrogen-stimulated proliferation and/or<br>
differentiation, SERMs are especially useful in the treatment or prevention of<br>
benign breast diseases in women, gynecomastia in men and in benign or<br>
malignant breast tumors with or without metastasis both in men and women<br>
(A. M. Brodie and V. C. Njar, Steroids, 2000, 65: 171-179 ; K.I. Pritchard, Cancer,<br>
2000, 85, suppl 12: 3065-3072), or in male or female domestic animals.<br>
Due to the involvement of estrogens in the mechanisms of ovulation,<br>
implantation and pregnancy, SERMs according to the invention can be used,<br>
respectively, for contraceptive, contragestive or abortive purposes in women<br>
(A. M. Brodie and V. C. Njar, Drugs, 1999, 58: 233-255) as well as in females of<br>
wild or domestic animal species.<br>
The uterus is another reproductive organ responsive to estrogenic stimulation.<br>
SERMs are therefore useful to treat or prevent endometriosis, benign uterine<br>
diseases or benign or malignant uterine tumors with or without metastasis in<br>
women (A. M. Brodie and V. C. Njar, Drugs, 1999, 58: 233-255) or in female<br>
domestic animals.<br>
The ovary being the physiological source of estrogen, SERMs can be used to<br>
treat abnormal or untimely ovarian estrogen production such as polycystic ovary<br>
syndrome or precocious puberty, respectively (Bulun et al., J Steroid Biochem<br>
Mol Biol, 1997, 61: 133-139). Ovarian as well as non-ovarian but estrogen<br>
producing benign or malignant tumors with or without metastasis (Sasano H and<br>
Harada N, Endocrine Reviews, 1998, 19: 593-607) may also benefit from<br>
treatment with SERMs according to the invention.<br>
In males, prostate and testicular tissues are also responsive to estrogenic<br>
stimulation (Abney TO, Steroids, 1999, 64: 610-617; Carreau S et al., Int J<br>
Androl, 1999, 22: 133-138). Therefore, SERMs can be used to treat or to prevent<br>
benign (Sciarra F and Toscano V, Archiv Androl, 2000, 44: 213-220) or malignant<br>
prostate tumors with or without metastasis (Auclerc G et al., Oncologist, 2000, 5:<br>
36-44) or to treat, prevent or control spermatogenesis functions or malfunctions,<br>
in men as well as in male wild or domestic animals.<br>
Estrogens are also known to be implicated in the regulation of bone turnover;<br>
therefore, SERMs may be useful, alone or in combination with other<br>
antiresorbtive or proosteogenic agents, in the treatment or prevention of bone<br>
disorders according to appropriate therapeutic sequences or regimens.<br>
In addition, estrogens are involved in the regulation of the balance between Thi<br>
and Th2 predominant immune functions and may therefore be useful in the<br>
treatment or prevention of gender-dependent auto-immune diseases such as<br>
lupus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis.<br>
Another aspect of the invention thus consists in a method for the treatment or<br>
prevention of the above-mentioned diseases or disorders, wherein a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of a compound of formula (I) or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof is administered to a patient or animal in<br>
need of such treatment or prevention. Co-administration with one or more active<br>
substances suitable for the treatment or prevention of said diseases or disorders<br>
is also encompassed by the present invention.<br>
The compounds of the invention can in particular be used in the following<br>
indications:<br>
• treatment of cognitive dysfunction, for instance as neuroprotective,<br>
antidepressant or anxiolytic agents.<br>
• treatment of schizophrenia or neurodegenerative diseases such as<br>
Alzheimer's disease or Parkinson's disease.<br>
• prevention or treatment of estrogen-dependent disorders, for example<br>
hoţ flushes, osteoporosis, perimenopausal mood, perimenstrual syndromes,<br>
vasomotor related syndromes, vaginal atrophy or dryness, sexual dysfunction<br>
such as libido decrease, urinary incontinence, pruritus, local infections of the<br>
genital tract In this case, said compounds can be combined with a sexual<br>
endocrine therapeutic agent.<br>
• control or management of reproductive functions, such as male or female<br>
fertility, pregnancy, abortion, contraception, delivery, or estrogen-related skin<br>
diseases. In this case, said compounds can be combined with a LH-RH agonist or<br>
antagonist, an estroprogestative contraceptive, a progestin, an antiprogestin or a<br>
prostaglandin.<br>
• prevention or treatment of benign or malignant diseases of the breast,<br>
the uterus or the ovary, or of polycystic ovary syndrome. In this case, said<br>
compounds can be combined with an antiestrogen, a progestin or a LH-RH<br>
agonist or antagonist.<br>
• prevention or treatment of benign or malignant diseases of the prostate<br>
or the testis. In this case, said compounds can be combined with an<br>
antiandrogen, a progestin, a lyase inhibitor or a LH-RH agonist. If necessary, the<br>
compounds of the invention can also be combined with a radiotherapeutic agent;<br>
a chemiotherapeutic agent such as a nitrogenated mustard analogue like<br>
cyclophosphamide, melphalan, iphosphamide, or trophosphamide; an<br>
ethylenimine like thiotepa; a nitrosourea like carmustine; a lysed agent like<br>
temozolomide or dacarbazine; an antimetabolite of folie acid like methotrexate or<br>

agent like pentostatin, miltefosine, estramustine, topotecan, irinotecan or<br>
bicalutamide; or with a prostaglandin inhibitor (COX 2/COX l inhibitor).<br>
• prevention or treatment of irritable bowel syndrome, Crohn's disease,<br>
ulcerative proctitis, colitis or arthritis.<br>
• prevention or treatment of cardiovascular diseases, atherosclerosis,<br>
hypertension, restenosis (e.g. for lowering cholesterol, triglycerides, Lp(a), or<br>
LDL levels, or modulating HDL level).<br>
As used herein, the term "combined" or "combination" refers to any protocol for<br>
the co-administration of a compound of formula (I) and one or more other<br>
pharmaceutical substances, irrespective of the nature of the time of<br>
administration and the variation of dose over time of any of the substances. The<br>
co-administration can for example be parallel, sequential or over an extended<br>
period of time.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) or their pharmaceutically acceptable salts may be<br>
administered, for example, orally, topically, parenterally, in dosage unit<br>
formulations containing convenţional non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carriers, adjuvants and/or vehicles. These dosage forms are given as examples,<br>
but other dosage forms may be developed by those skilled in the art of<br>
formulation, for the administration of the compounds of formula (I). The term<br>
parenteral as used herein includes subcutaneous injections, intravenous,<br>
intramuscular or intrasternal injections or infusion techniques. In addition to the<br>
treatment of warm-blooded animals such as mice, rats, horses, cattle sheep,<br>
dogs, cats, etc., the compounds of the invention are effective in the treatment of<br>
humans.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions containing the active ingredient may be in a<br>
form suitable for oral use, for example, as tablets, troches, lozenges, aqueous or<br>
oily suspensions, dispersible powders or granules, emulsions, hard or soft<br>
capsules, or syrups or elixirs. Compositions intended for oral use may be<br>
prepared according to any method known in the art for the manufacture of<br>
pharmaceutical compositions and such compositions may contain one or more<br>
agents selected from the group consisting of sweetening agents, flavoring<br>
agents, coloring agents and preserving agents in order to provide<br>
pharmaceutically elegant and palatable preparations. Tablets contain the active<br>
ingredient in admixture with non-toxic pharmaceutically acceptable excipients,<br>
which are suitable for the manufacture of tablets. These excipients may be for<br>
example, inert diluents, such as calcium carbonate, sodium carbonate, lactose,<br>
calcium phosphate or sodium phosphate; granulating and disintegrating agents,<br>
for example, corn starch, or alginic acid; binding agents, for example starch,<br>
gelatin or acacia, and lubricating agents, for example, magnesium stearate,<br>
stearic acid or talc. The tablete may be uncoated or they may be coated by<br>
known techniques to delay disintegration and absorption in the gastrointestinal<br>
tract and thereby provide a sustained action over a longer period. For example, a<br>
time delay material such as glyceryl monostearate or glyceryl distearate may be<br>
employed. They may also be coated by the technique described in U.S. Patente<br>
N° 4,256,108, 4,166,452 and 4,265,874 to form osmotic therapeutic tablete for<br>
control release.<br>
Formulations for oral use may also be presented as hard gelatin capsules wherein<br>
the active ingredient is mixed with an inert solid diluent, for example, calcium<br>
carbonate, calcium phosphate, or kaolin, or as soft gelatin capsules wherein the<br>
active ingredient is mixed with water or an oii medium, for example peanut oii,<br>
liquid paraffin, or olive oii.<br>
Aqueous suspensions contain the active ingredient in admixture with excipients<br>
suitable for the manufacture of aqueous suspensions. Such excipients are<br>
suspending agents, for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, methylcellulose,<br>
hydroxy-propylmethylcellulose, sodium alginate, polyvinyl-pyrrolidone, gum<br>
tragacanth and gum acacia; dispersing or wetting agente such as a naturallyoccurring<br>
phosphatide, for example lecithin, or condensation producte of an<br>
alkylene oxide with fatty acids, for example polyoxyethylene stearate, or<br>
condensation products of ethylene oxide with long chain aliphatic alcohols, for<br>
example heptadecaethyleneoxycetanol, or condensation products of ethylene<br>
oxide with parţial esters derived from fatty acids and a hexitol such as<br>
polyoxyethylene sorbitol monooleate, or condensation producte of ethylene oxide<br>
with parţial esters derived from fatty acids and hexitol anhydrides, for example<br>
polyethylene sorbitan monooleate. The aqueous suspensions may also contain<br>
one or more preservatives, for example ethyl, or n-propyl, p-hydroxybenzoate,<br>
one or more coloring agente, one or more flavoring agente, and one or more<br>
sweetening agents, such as sucrose, saccharin or aspartame.<br>
Oily suspensions may be formulated by suspending the active ingredient in a<br>
vegetable oii, for example arachis oii, olive oii, sesame oii or coconut oii, or in a<br>
mineral oii such as liquid paraffin. The oily suspensions may contain a thickening<br>
agent, for example beeswax, hard paraffin or cetyl alcohol. Sweetening agents<br>
such as those mentioned above, and flavoring agents may be added to provide a<br>
palatable oral preparation. These compositions may be preserved by trie addition<br>
of an anti-oxidant such as ascorbic acid.<br>
Dispersible powders and granules suitable for preparation of an aqueous<br>
suspension by the addition of water provide the active ingredient in admixture<br>
with a dispersing or wetting agent, suspending agent and one or more<br>
preservatives. Suitable dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents are<br>
exemplified by those already mentioned above. Additional excipients, for example<br>
sweetening, flavoring and coloring agents, may also be present. The<br>
pharmaceutical compositions of the invention may also be in the form of an oilin-<br>
water emulsion. The oily phase may be a vegetable oii, for example olive oii or<br>
arachis oii, or a mineral oii, for example liquid paraffin or mixtures of these.<br>
Suitable emulsifying agents include naturally-occuring phosphatides, for example<br>
soy bean, lecithin, and esters or parţial esters derived from fatty acids and<br>
hexitol anhydrides, for example sorbitan monooleate, and condensation products<br>
of the said parţial esters with ethylene oxide, for example polyoxyethylene<br>
sorbitan monooleate. The emulsions may also contain sweetening and flavouring<br>
agents.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions may be in the form of a sterile injectable<br>
aqueous or oleagenous suspension. This suspension may be formulated<br>
according to the known art using those suitable dispersing or wetting agents and<br>
suspending agents which have been mentioned above. The sterile injectable<br>
preparation may also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic<br>
parenterally-acceptable diluent or solvent, for example as a solution in<br>
l, 3-butane diol. Acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed include<br>
water, Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition, sterile,<br>
fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium. For<br>
this purpose any blând fixed oii may be employed including synthetic mono- or<br>
diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid find use in the preparation<br>
of injectables.<br>
Dosage levels of the order of from about 0.001 mg to about 10 mg/kg of body<br>
weight per day are useful in the treatment or prevention of the above-mentioned<br>
diseases or disorders, or alternatively about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg per patient<br>
per day.<br>
The amount of active ingredient that may be combined with the carrier materials<br>
to produce a single dosage form will vary depending upon the host treated and<br>
the particular mode of administration.<br>
It will be understood, however, that the specific dose level for any particular<br>
patient will depend upon a variety of factors including the age, body weight,<br>
general health, sex, diet, time of administration, route of administration, rate of<br>
excretion, drug combination and the severity of the particular disease undergoing<br>
therapy.<br>

Oxidation of these compounds (46) and (47) by hydrogen peroxide in<br>
trifluoroacetic acid, foilowing the conditions described by S. Grivas and E. Ronne<br>
(Acta Chemica Scandinavia, 1995, 49, 225-229), gave respectively the mono<br>
and/or dioxidised benzisothiazoles (49) and (48). Compound (49) can be<br>
sulfamoylated to give (48).<br>
General schemes I, II and III illustrate the synthesis of compounds (I) in which<br>
the substituent RiO is in position 6- of the heterocyclic ring. It will however be<br>
appreciated that compounds (I) where the substituent RiO is in position 4-, 5- or<br>
7- of the heterocyclic ring can be prepared using the procedures described<br>
above.<br>

PHARMACOLOGICAL TEST RESULTS<br>
SUBTYPE ESTROGEN RECEPTOR BINDING IN VITRO<br>
The method was derived from those described for rât uterus (Botella J. et al,<br>
J Endocrinei Invest, 1990, 13: 905-910) and human Ishikawa cell (Botella J.,<br>
J Steroid Biochem Molec Biol, 1995, 55: 77-84) estrogen receptors. Relative<br>
binding affinities (RBA) were determined by competitive radiometric binding<br>
assays, using purified full-length recombinant human ERoc and ER(3 (PanVera,<br>
Madison, WI). Receptors were incubated in Tris buffer (lOmM Tris, 2 mM DTT,<br>
l mg/BSA, 10 % Glycerol, pH 7.5 with HCI) at 4 °C for 18-20 hours with 2 nM of<br>
[3H]-E2 with or without increasing concentrations of test compound from l nM to<br>
10 uM. Non-specific binding was measured in the presence of a 500-fold excess<br>
of unlabeled E2. Separation of bound and free 3H-E2 fractions was achieved with<br>
dextran (0.25 %) coated charcoal (2.5 %) in Tris-EDTA buffer. After shaking for<br>
a few seconds and centrifugation at 1500 g and 4°C for 10 minutes, 150 ul/well<br>
51<br>
of Optiphase 'Super Mix' scintillation liquid was mixed with 50 |jl of supernatant<br>
of each sample and the radioactivity was measured in a MicroBeta counter<br>
(Wallac, Turku, Finland). Data were evaluated by a sigmoidal dose-response<br>
curve (Prism, GraphPad Software Inc.) to estimate the concentration of<br>
competitor at half-maximal specific binding (IC5o). RBA of each competitor was<br>
calculated as the ratio of IC50s of E2 and competitor, and the RBA value for E2<br>
was arbitrarily set at 100 %. The selectivity for ERa and ERfJ was obtained from<br>
the ratio R of the IC50 for ERoc to the IC50 for ER(3 for each test compound.<br>

ESTROGENIC AND ANTI-ESTROGENIC ACTIVITIES IN VITRO<br>
The estrogenic and anti-estrogenic potentials of new compounds were evaluated<br>
using the induction of alkaline phosphatase (APase) activity, an estrogen specific<br>
response in human endometrial adenocarcinoma Ishikawa cells (Botella X,<br>
J Steroid Biochem Molec Biol, 1995, 55: 77-84; Littlefield et al., Endocrinology,<br>
1990, 127: 2757-2762).<br>
Ishikawa cells were routinely grown as monolayers in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle's<br>
medium (DMEM) containing 4 mM Glutamax I and supplemented with 10 % of<br>
decomplemented fetal calf serum (dFCS) and antibiotics. They were maintained<br>
in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % C02 and 95 % air, at 37 ± 0.1° C. Stocks<br>
were performed once a week to maintain continuous exponenţial growth.<br>
For studies, Ishikawa cells were plated into 96-well microplates. The next day,<br>
the medium was changed to a phenol red-free DMEM containing 5 % dFCS<br>
stripped of endogenous estrogens by dextran coated charcoal treatment.<br>
Twenty-four hours later, the medium was renewed and the relevant controls and<br>
test compounds, diluted appropriately in estrogen-free DMEM, were added either<br>
alone (estrogenic effect) or with IO'8 M E2 (anti-estrogenic effect) to the plated<br>
cells and incubated for four days. For each compound, the tested concentrations<br>
ranged from IO"12 M to IO"5 M, and the final vehicle concentration did not exceed<br>
0.1 %.<br>
At the end of the incubation period, APase activity was assayed by a method<br>
involving the hydrolysis of p-nitrophenyl phosphate to p-nitrophenol at pH 9.8<br>
and spectrophotometric deterrnination of the product at 405 nm.<br>
In brief, the microplates were first rinsed twice with cold phosphate buffered<br>
solution and then placed at -80° C for at least 15 minutes. After thawing at room<br>
temperature for 5-10 minutes, the plates were put on ice and 50 pi ice-cold<br>
solution containing 5 mM p-nitrophenyl phosphate was added to each well. The<br>
plates were warmed to room temperature to allow for the development of the<br>
enzymatic reaction (to). After a 15 to 60 minute incubation period, the intensity<br>
of the yellow color generated by the production of p-nitrophenol was measured<br>
into each well at 405 nm using a microplate reader (Wallac, model 1420 Victor2).<br>
For each tested concentration, APase activity, reflected by absorbance, was first<br>
expressed as fold increase over control (FI) and then as percentage of E2 activity<br>
(IO"8 M) chosen equal to 100 %. Sigmoidal dose-response curves were plotted<br>
and EC50 (estrogenic effect) and IC50 (anti-estrogenic effect) values were<br>
calculated for each compound.<br>

PROLIFERATIVE ACTIVITY IN VITRO<br>
The proliferative effect of the compounds of the invention was evaluated on<br>
human breast cancer cell line MCF-7 by measuring the number of viable cells<br>
after 6 days of treatment.<br>
MCF-7 cells were routinely cultured as monolayers in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's<br>
medium (DMEM) containing 4 mM Glutamax and 4.5 g/l glucose and<br>
supplemented with 5 % (v/v) decomplemented fetal calf serum (dFCS) and<br>
antibiotics.<br>
Cells were plated at 2. IO6 cells/75 cm2 flasks and incubated at 37° C in a<br>
humidified atmosphere containing 5 % C02. They were passaged once weekly to<br>
maintain continuous exponenţial growth. Forty eight hours before the start of an<br>
experiment, near-confluent cells were changed to a phenol red free DMEM<br>
containing 5 % steroid-stripped dFCS by dextran coated charcoal treatment<br>
(DCC-DMEM). On the day of the experiment, cells were harvested by brief<br>
exposure to trypsin and plated in DCC-DMEM in 96-well microplates at a density<br>
of 4.103 cells/well. The next day, the medium was renewed and test compounds,<br>
diluted appropriately in estrogen-free DMEM, were added and incubated for six<br>
days. For each compound, the tested concentrations ranged from IO"12 M to IO"5<br>
M and the final vehicle concentration did not exceed 0.1 % (v/v). At the end of<br>
the incubation period, cell proliferation was evaluated by quantitation of the<br>
cellular ATP content which signals the presence of metabolically active cells.<br>
ATP assay<br>
The assay, based on the ATP-dependent luciferase reaction, enables generation<br>
of a luminescent signal proporţional to the amount of ATP present. As there is a<br>
linear relationship between the amount of ATP and the number of viable cells<br>
present in culture, the luminescent signal allowed to precisely evaluate cell<br>
proliferation (Crouch, S.P.M. et al. J. Immunol. Meth., 1993, 160, 81; Kangas,<br>
L. et al. Med. Biol. 1984, 62, 338; Petty, R.D. et al. J. Biolum. Chemilum. 1995,<br>
10, 29).<br>
In brief, the microplates were inverted to discard the culture medium and 100 ui<br>
of fresh medium was added into each well. The microplates were equilibrated at<br>
room temperature for approximately 30 minutes. 100 ui of luciferase reagent was<br>
added into each well and contents were mixed for 2 minutes to induce cell lysis.<br>
The plates were incubated at room temperature for 10 minutes to stabilize<br>
luminescence signal.<br>
Luminescence was recorded using a microplate reader (Wallac, model 1420<br>
Victor2) and results were expressed as percentage of the control luminescence.<br>
Sigmoidal dose-response curves were plotted and EC50 values were calculated for<br>
each compound in order to evaluate their proliferative potency.<br>

ESTROGENIC ACTIVITY IN VIVO<br>
Prepubescent female rats were orally treated at 3 mg/rat/day for 3 days. On the<br>
day following the last treatment, uteri were removed and wet weights were<br>
recorded.<br>
The results are expressed as % of stimulation of uterus weight in comparison<br>
with vehicles.<br>
The compounds of examples 23, 31, 35, 66, 73, 84, 86 and 93 exhibited a<br>
marked selectivity for the human recombinant estrogen receptor (3 and a weak<br>
estrogenic effect in alkaline phosphatase activity in the Ishikawa cell model.<br>
These compounds were accordingly selected to check their in vitro estrogenicity.<br>
The aim of this study was to test these compounds in comparison with tamoxifen<br>
(TAM), with an ER|3 selective standard agonist: DPN or 2,3-bis-(4<br>
-hydroxyphenyl)propionitrile (Meyers M J, J Med Chem 2001, 44; 24, 4230-4251)<br>
and with an ERa selective standard agonist: PPT or l,3,5-tris-(4-hydroxyphenyl)<br>
-4-propyl-lH-pyrazole (Stauffer S R, J Med Chem 2000, 43; 4934-4947), when<br>
17p-estradiol (E2) at 3 mg/rat/day p.o. is taken as the standard reference.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The compound of example 23 has been selected as a potenţial good candidate<br>
for treating estrogenic dependent diseases because of the lack of uterotrophicity<br>
up to a 3 mg/animal/day dosage, after oral administration.<br>
EFFECT OF COMPOUNDS ON HOŢ FLUSH MODEL IN VIVO<br>
According to Berendsen et al. (Eur. J. Pharmacol., 2003, 482; 329-33), tail skin<br>
temperature of ovariectomized rats may serve as a useful tool for selection of<br>
compounds that are of potenţial use in the treatment of hoţ flushes in<br>
postmenopausal women. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of the<br>
compound of Example 23 over 4 days on tail skin temperature in ovariectomized<br>
rats. 17(3-estradiol, the standard reference, was administered by oral route at<br>
l mg/rat/day over 13 consecutive days (Watanabe N. et al, 2003). Twenty IOPS<br>
Wistar female rats from Charles River France, weighing 176 to 200 g on arrival,<br>
were used for the study. Rats were accommodated in groups of four in stainless<br>
steel mesh cages. After implantation of telemetrie transmitters (TA10TA-F40,<br>
Data Sciences International) until the end of the study, they were housed in<br>
groups of two in macrolon cages and maintained on a 14-10 hours light/dark<br>
cycle. Standard environmental conditions for this species were regularly<br>
controlled. Animals were allowed free access to a specific estrogen-free diet of<br>
Harlan Teklad 2016 pellets from HARLAN. They were allowed free access to<br>
filtered and softened ţap water. Water was dispensed ad libitum via automatic<br>
deliveries in metallic cages and in plastic bottles in macrolon cages. Rats were<br>
then ovariectomized and left undisturbed for at least 2 weeks. After this<br>
hormonal rest period, tail skin temperature was monitored during the same<br>
period and animals were randomized into 3 groups based on mean temperature.<br>
The first group was "ovariectomy control group", the second group was "estradiol<br>
group" to confirm the estrogen activity on tail temperature and the third group<br>
was "Ex 23 group" to test the activity of this product on temperature. Body<br>
weights were then recorded on the first day of treatment and at the end of<br>
study.<br>
The Results are expressed as % of stimulation of uterus weight in comparison<br>
with vehicles. 17|5-estradiol (E2) at 3 mg/rat/day is taken as the standard<br>
reference.<br>
(Table Remove)<br>
The compound of example 23 decreased tail skin temperature of ovariectomized<br>
rât, without deleterious side-effects on uteri, unlike estradiol activity on body<br>
weight or uteri (as seen below).<br>
EFFECT OF COMPOUNDS ON BONE AND CARDIOVASCULAR<br>
PARAMETERS IN VIVO<br>
The ovariectomized rât is a mandatory model for preclinical evaluation of new<br>
compounds used for the prevention of bone loss (osteoporosis). Female Wistar -<br>
derived OFA străin rats from IFFA CREDO (France) were ovariectomized or sham<br>
operated as intact control. Upon arrival, they were housed in metal hanging<br>
cages in groups of 3 or 4 per cage and hâd ad libitum access to food and water<br>
for one week. After a one week acclimation period, daily dosing was carried out<br>
with the compound of interest or 17p-estradiol.<br>
During the study, plasma samples were taken to allow lipid parameter assay:<br>
triglycerides, free cholesterol, total cholesterol, HDL, LDL, VLDL, apoliporotein A<br>
and B100; bone metabolism parameters such as: DPD, Ca2+, collagen type I and<br>
II C-telopeptide fragments; and urinary bone markers such as Ca2+, and<br>
inorganic phosphate. AII assays were carried out following the manufacturer's<br>
recommendations.<br>
To allow bone mineral density measurement of individual lumbar segments,<br>
lumbar high resolution or whole body dual energy X-ray absorptiometry<br>
procedures were carried out during the study on isoflurane anesthetized animals.<br>
ANTIDEPRESSANT ACTIVITY OF COMPOUNDS<br>
Antidepressant effect of estradiol was recently reported in studies using<br>
ER (3 KO mice model. In addition, ER (5 localization in dorsal raphe nuc/eusarea<br>
in rât has been described. The gold standard test for antidepressant potency of<br>
compound consist in the forced swimming test, in this experiment<br>
antidepressants could be distinguished from psychostimulants which decreased<br>
immobility at doses which increased general activity. In order to investigate the<br>
putative antidepressant potency of the compounds reported here, the forced<br>
swimming test was performed according to the following design. The animals<br>
were housed six per cage under standard colony conditions, with a 12 h<br>
light/dark cycle and ad libitum food and water. They were allowed to acclimatize<br>
to the colony for at least 7 days prior to any experimentation. For subcutaneous<br>
administration, the compound of Example 23 was dissolved in olive oii and<br>
diluted to the desired concentration on the day of administration. For positive<br>
control, intraperitoneal (i.p.) injection of desipramine was done. Desipramine was<br>
dissolved in double-distilled water (10 mg/kg). The experiments were conducted<br>
30 min after the positive control drug treatment (only for desipramine<br>
treatment). Other compounds, ie: estradiol and the compound of Example 23<br>
were daily injected subcutaneously in rats, during a 7 days period. Acquisition<br>
were performed on day 8 (24 h after the last administration of items) and day 9<br>
 (48h after estradiol or compound 23 administration), respectively. Data aquired<br>
24 hours after the last administration consisted in the "naive animal group",<br>
these animals hâd never been previousiy tested in the device. Data aquired 48<br>
hours after a last administration of compounds consisted in "trained animal<br>
 (Table Remove)<br>
On the 8th, the forced swim test was performed. This study was carried out in<br>
rats according to the methods described by Porsolt (Eur. J. Pharm., 1978).<br>
Briefly, rats were placed individually in glass cylinders (height: 40 cm, diameter:<br>
18 cm) containing 25 cm of water at 25 °C. Ten minutes later, rats were<br>
removed and dried before being returned to their home cages. The animals were<br>
replaced in the cylinders 24 h later, and the procedure was repeated, and a<br>
10-min observation period was recorded.<br>
The model was validated by desipramine activity found in the test. Results shown<br>
the confirmation of the antidepressor potency of estradiol, 24h and 48h after<br>
administration. the compound of Example 23 exhibited a antidepressor activity<br>
when animals were first-in-the-test 24h after administration, while in trained<br>
animal group 48h after administration, the antidepressor potency of the<br>
compound of Example 23 disappeared. <br><br><br>
