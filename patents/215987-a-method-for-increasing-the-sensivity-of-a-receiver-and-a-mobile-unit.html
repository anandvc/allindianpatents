				<td>The present invention relates to lubricating compositions, more specifically to lubricating compositions for lubricating a combination of a steam turbine and a gas turbine.<br>
The use of a combination of a gas turbine and a steam turbine for power generation, has the advantage that it is more efficient than power generation with either type of turbine. The combination will hereinafter also be referred to as combined cycle". A difficulty of lubricating a combined cycle resides in the large variety of different components which must be lubricated, i.e. bearings (both journal and thrust), gears, hydraulic control systems, flexible couplings and oil shaft seals. Although each component could be lubricated per se, it is advantageous to have a single, common lubricating system containing a single, common lubricant for all components.<br>
The lubricating composition for use in the common system will have to meet a rather outstanding combination of requirements in order to satisfactorily lubricate each component. These requirements comprise the rather severe thermal and oxidative stability requirements and stringent foaming levels for the gas turbine part, whereas the steam turbine part requires the oil to have good water shedding properties and excellent corrosion resistance. High temperature oxidative stability means that the lubricating composition has a low tendency to form sludge, a low increase in viscosity and a low increase in total acid number at high temperature. Desirable characteristics<br><br>
are a viscosity increase of at most 20 %, a total acid number increase of at most 3.0 mg KOH/g and a sludge content of less than 300 mg/100 ml after having been subjected to the oxidation stability test DIN 51394 performed according to the high temperature modifications set out in the General Electric specifications GEK 32568 C and GEK 101941, preferably less than 250 ml/g, more preferably less than 200 ml/g, most preferably less than 150 ml/g.  In establishing the amount of sludge produced, the sludge must be removed carefully from all the equipment used in the test.  The sludge is separated from the oil by filtration.<br>
It has been found that especially the tendency of the lubricating composition to form sludge, is important in whether a lubricating composition is suitable for use in lubricating combined cycle equipment.<br>
The lubricating composition for use in combined cycle must further have a certain viscosity index, pour point, filterability and anti-wear performance, while the composition should provide adequate lubrication over many years.<br>
Achieving this combination of complex lubricant properties allows the lubricating oil to be suitable for use in a combined cycle.<br>
In EP-A-696 636 it is taught to use a combination of (A) a lubricating base oil, (B) an alkyl diphenylamine and/or phenyl-a-naphthylamine and (C) oxymolybdenum sulfide dithiocarbamate and/or oxymolybdenum sulfide organophosphorodithioate. One kind of alkyldiphenylamine may be used alone, or two or more kinds of alkyldiphenylamine may be used together. One kind of p"henyl-a-naphthylamine may be used alone or two or more kinds of phenyl-a-naphthylamine may be used together.<br><br>
Also one or more kinds of alkyldiphenylamine and one or<br>
more kinds of phenyl-a-naphthylamine may be used together. In the examples, either a single alkyl diphenylamine or a single phenyl-a-naphthylamine is used. Oxymolybdenum sulfide organophosphorodithioate is present in only one of the examples according to the teaching. EP-A-696 636 does not disclose or teach to use the specific combination of alkyl diphenylamine and phenyl-a-naphthylamine and thiophosphate.<br>
Further, it is known to use a combination of amine antioxidants, optionally in combination with a thiophosphate,  in ester base oils for use in gas turbine engines for aviation purposes. Such formulations have been described in GB-B-990,097, GB-A-2272000 and GB-B-1,293,245. These documents do not disclose or teach to use a combination of a diphenylamine, thiophosphate and phenyl-a-naphthylamine in a hydrocarbon lubricant base oil.<br>
A lubricating composition has now been found which meets the requirements for use in a combined cycle. Furthermore, this lubricating composition shows an especially low tendency to form sludge at high temperatures.<br>

Further preferred thiophosphates and ways to prepare them, have been described in EP-A-375324.  A suitable thiosphosphates which is commercially available is LZ 5125 from Lubrizol Corporation.<br>
The hydrocarbon lubricant base oil present in the lubricating composition of the present invention can be any hydrocarbon oil suitable for use in a lubricant. Different suitable base fluids can have different lubricating viscosity.  The hydrocarbon base oil essentially consists of compounds which only contain hydrogen and carbon. A limited amount of contaminants such as sulphur containing compounds can be present. Preferably, more than     80 %wt of the base oil consists of compounds consisting of hydrogen and carbon only, more preferably more than 90 %wt. The base oil can be a natural or a synthetic lubricating oil, or mixtures thereof.  The natural oil can be a mineral oil such as liquid petroleum oils and solvent treated or acid treated mineral lubricating oils of the paraffinic, naphthenic, or mixed paraffinic/naphthenic type which may be further refined by hydrocracking and hydrofinishing processes and/or dewaxing.

The lubricating composition can further comprise conventional additives.  It is preferred that the composition further contains a metal passivator, a rust inhibitor, a foam inhibitor and/or a demulsifier.<br>
Component (d) is the preferred rust inhibitor all known to<br>
persons skilled in jthe art..   .  .       , .  .. The amount of the additives to be present m the<br>
lubricating composition, depends on the specific<br>
compounds used.<br>
Generally, the lubricating composition preferably<br>
contains between 0.1 and 5.0 %  by weight, preferably<br><br>

Further, the invention relates to lubrication of a combination of a gas turbine and a steam turbine utilising a pressurised-steam generator.<br><br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a lubricating composition comprising a hydrocarbon lubricant base oil in combination with: a) a phenyl-naphthylamine, b) a thiophosphate, and c) a diphenyl amine, wherein more than 80% wt. of the base oil consists of compounds consisting of hydrogen and carbon only.<br>
The lubricating composition according to the present invention can be prepared by adding together the phenyl-naphthylamine, the thiophosphate, the diphenylamine, the hydrocarbon base oil and optionally a compound according to formula I.<br>
Experiments<br>
Formulations have been subjected to a test for high temperature oxidation<br>
stability known as the oxidation test DIN 51394 performed according to the high<br>
temperature modifications set out in the General Electric specifications GEK 32568 C<br>
and GEK 101941. In this test, the oil is maintained at 175Â°C for 72 hours in the<br>
presence of five metal catalysts (copper, steel, aluminium, magnesium, silver) whilst<br>
air is bubbled through the oil at a rate of 3 1/hour. At the end of   	<br><br>
the  test,   the  oil   is  analysed  for  its  viscosity increase,   its   increase  in  total  acid number and   the total   amount   of   sludge  produced.     The   sludge  must  be removed  carefully  from the  equipment,   especially   from the   full  height   of  the  sides  of  the  cylinder.     The sludge  is   separated by  filtration with  the  help  of   5 micron  filtration paper  available  from Millipore,   the sludge  removed  is  washed with n-heptane  and subsequently dried  and weighed.<br>
The   formulations  contained the   following additives. Aminic  antioxidant   I:     phenyl-alpha-naphthylamine   (not substituted)<br>
Aminic antioxidant   II:     dioctyl  diphenyl  amine Rust   inhibitor:     aspartic  acid,   N-(3-carboxy-l-oxo-2-propenyl)-N-octadecyl,   bis(2-methylpropyl)ester. Antiwear  agent:      amine  salt  of  dialkylthiophosphate, LZ   5125   commercially  available   from  Lubrizol.<br>
