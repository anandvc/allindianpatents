				<td>Vehicle body<br>
The invention relates to a vehicle body with a cockpit cross bar in accordance with the characterising main clause of patent claim 1.<br>
From the serial production of vehicles it is known to provide connecting struts between the supporting structure and the cockpit cross bar for the support of the cockpit cross bar.<br>
Especially DE 102 31 717 Al discloses a supporting strut between a cross bar and a cowling. The supporting strut is connected rigidly by means of a nodal element to the cowling. This rigid connection serves to prevent vibrations on the steering wheel of the steering column.<br>
Due to the necessary accessibility of the screw joint from the engine room and also for foam application of the nodal elements the dismantling of the supporting strut becomes difficult in case of repairs.<br>
Therefore, the object of the invention is to design a typical vehicle body by maintaining the reinforcing effect for user friendly assembly as well as dismantling.<br>
This object is achieved according to the invention with the characteristics of claim 1.<br>
Advantageous designs result from the characteristics of the sub-claims.<br>
A vehicle body according to the invention discloses a cockpit cross bar, which encompasses a holding console for a steering column. The cockpit cross bar is connected by a support with a cowling cross support located<br>
before the cross bar - seen in driving direction. As the support is connected with the holding console in the space between the cross bar and the cowling cross support, this joint is particularly easy to access from the vehicle cabin. Therefore, in case of repair this connection can be disconnected without e. g. having to remove the wind screen to reach the joint between the support and the cowling cross support. Furthermore, the joint between the support and the console can be designed in such a manner, that it is predetermined to fail in case of a crash, so that inadmissible displacements of the steering column into the interior space of the passenger cabin are prevented.<br>
Whereas the support can be positioned at least partially overlapping with the holding console, a separating plane can be created, within which the support can be moved in relation to the console.<br>
In an advantageous form of design fasteners, preferably bolts are provided in the overlapping space between the console and the support.<br>
If the fasteners fail with application of a defined load, a path of force cannot build up from the cowling cross support to the cockpit cross bar.<br>
An especially rigid connection can be achieved if the support is a U-profile, open downwards, wherein a load bearing cross section is formed between the console and the support.<br>
In an especially advantageous configuration of the invention the support and the console can slide telescopically into each other. In case of force acting against the driving direction the support e. g. will be shifted in a respective seat of the console.<br>
The support can have a constant profile along its length for the telescopic manner of sliding of the support into the seat of the console. However, it can also be assumed that additional energy will be consumed in sliding.<br>
A profile with a constant cross section can be configured as an extruded profile. Therein the position of the walls towards each other and their material thickness can be adapted individually for the vehicle, the package, and the rigidity and crash requirements. Thereby a modular design of the support frame of the cockpit, covering the line of products, is possible with the same extruded steering in the space of the steering connection. The supporting cross section is automatically formed by the support itself in this example of design.<br>
In an advantageous form of design of the invention the seat for the support is formed by a shell profile which is attached on the console.<br>
Other advantageous designs will be described in detail in the following on the basis of the drawing. Therein shows:<br>
Fig. 1    a perspective view of a vehicle body in the area of the cockpit<br>
diagonally from below, Fig. 2     a view from above onto the vehicle body according to Fig. 1, Fig. 3     a side view of the vehicle body according to Fig. 1, Fig. 4     a perspective view of the second form of design of the invention<br>
diagonally from above, Fig. 5     a view according to Fig. 4 in an exploded view, Fig. 6    an embodiment of a longitudinal section according to line VI-VI in<br>
Fig. 4, Fig. 7     an embodiment of a cross section according to line VII-VII in Fig. 4,<br>
Fig. 8 an embodiment of a partial cut section of a third form of design in<br>
a diagonal view from above, Fig. 9    an embodiment of a  longitudinal cross section according to<br>
line IX-IX in Fig. 8, as well as<br>
Fig. 10  a cross section of the support according to line X-X in Fig. 8.<br>
Fig. 1 to 3 discloses a first form of design of the invention. Fig. 1 embodies a perspective view diagonally from below to a section of the vehicle assembly 1.<br>
In the vehicle body 1 of a motor vehicle- seen in driving direction F - are positioned at the front side a cowling cross support 2 and a cockpit cross bar 3, which can be attached with their free ends to the vehicle body on both sides, e. g. on both the A-columns, which is not depicted in detail. A console 4 for the support of a steering column, which is also not depicted, is provided on the cockpit cross bar 3. Between the cockpit cross bar 3 and the cowling cross support 2 is positioned a support 5, which is attached to the console 4 on one side and on the other side connected to the cowling cross support 2.<br>
The console 4 can be made as aluminium die-casting but also as sheet steel stamping with a threaded extruded profile. The console 4 encompasses on its upper side 6 a recess 7, which fits to the cross section of the cross bar 3 and which extends at right angles to the driving direction over the whole width of the console 4. The cross bar 3 is welded with the console 4 in the space of the recess 7.<br>
The side walls 8 and 9 of the console 4 are designed in trapezoid form and connected with each other through transverse ribs 10, 11. Several longitudinal ribs 12, 13, 14, which extend at least partly over the length of the console 4, are located parallel to the side walls 8 and 9.<br>
Diagonal ribs 15 and 16 are provided for the strengthening of the console 4. A seat 18 for the steering column, which is not depicted, is provided on the front end wall 17. The lower side 19 has been provided with connecting points 20 for the fastening of the steering column.<br>
The support 5 can also be a die-cast part, sheet steel stamping or an extruded profile and comprises of a ribbed lower side 21. With this lower<br>
side 21 the support 5 rests at least partly on the upper side 6 of the console 4 and forms a separating plane T. Through bores 22, 23 are provided on the side facing the cowling cross support 2 to fasten the support 5 with the cowling cross support 2. For this purpose the cowling 2 is also provided with bores 29 and 30 at the respective places.<br>
The support 5 rests with an area facing cross bar 3, partially overlapping an area of console 4. In this overlapping area through bores 24 and 25 are provided congruently in the console 4 and the support 5. To connect console 4 with the support 5, bolts 26 and 27 are inserted in the through bores 24 and 25.<br>
The bolts 26, 27 can be designed in such a manner that they are predetermined to fail under a defined shear force, so that the connection is broken and the path of force to the cross bar or the steering column respectively is interrupted. Of course, more than two bolts can also be used. It is important that the connection fails at a defined shear force, regardless how the connection has been made.<br>
For the purpose of repairs the bolts have to be easily accessible from the interior space either from above or from below, so that the support 5 remains in the vehicle after loosening and removing the bolts, while the console 4 can be removed together with the cross bar 3 from the vehicle.<br>
The bolt fitting between the console 5 and the cowling cross support 2 need not be loosened in the case of repairs.<br>
A second form of design of the invention refers to the Fig. 4 to 7. The same numbers of reference refer to the same components. Herein also the console 4' has a recess 7', which is adapted to the cross section of the cross bar 3 and whose edges are welded with the cross bar 3. Contrary t6 the first version of the design the support 5' has a U-profile<br>
which is open downwards, so that it results in a hollow cross section together with the side walls 8' and 9' of the console 4'. Thereby, a supporting cross section 31 is formed which is depicted hatched in Fig. 7. This supporting cross section 31 contributes to the strengthening of the connection between the cross bar 3 and the cowling cross support 2, which is not depicted in Fig. 4 to 7 and serves among other things also to take care of elements of tolerance compensation. The welding joint between the console 4' and the support 5' can be designed in such a manner that it fails with application of a respectively great force.<br>
A third form of design of the invention refers to the Fig. 8 and 9. Herein the support 5" and the console 4" are designed to slide telescopically into each other. Thereto the support 5" has a rectangular profile 32, which fits into a shell profile 33 that is fastened to the console 4". The shell profile 33 is open downwards and is welded to the upper side 6 of the console 4". Furthermore, the shell profile 33 can also be welded to the cross bar 3. In case of application of force in direction of arrow F in Fig. 8 the connecting points between the support 5" and the shell profile 33 or the console 4" respectively will tear off at a predetermined force, so that the support 5" can slide into the shell profile 33. Here also a supporting cross section 35 is formed between the support 5" and the console 4" as especially depicted in Fig. 9.<br>
The support 5" is designed as an extruded profile, so that a constant cross section is formed along the length of the support 5". The cross section comprises of three rectangular profile chambers 36, 37 and 38 which are connected with each other. The profile can be designed accordingly depending on the requirements of rigidity or the crash behaviour.<br>
