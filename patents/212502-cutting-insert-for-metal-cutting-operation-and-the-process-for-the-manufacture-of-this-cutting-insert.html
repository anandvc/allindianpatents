This invention concerns a cutting insert for metal cutting operation, consisting of a hardmetal substrate body, a cermet substrate body or a ceramic substrate body with a multilayered coating.<br>
Substrate bodies with hard material coating, if needed, also with multilayered coating, are already known from the state-of-the-art technology, in general, the hard materials coating is supposed to serve the purpose, to achieve a wear resistant surface layer, whi ch is combi ned wi th tough substrate bodi es, whi ch are subjected to mechanically high stresses. As per the state—of— the—art—technology, two processes are generally used, namely so— cal 1 ed chemi cal vapour deposi ti on (CVD) process CH- physi cal vapour deposition (PVD) process for coating the substrate bodies. Usually the protective layers are made of, for example, TiC, TiN and/or aluminium oxide. Multilayered coatings with the order (sequence) of the layers TiN, Ti ‹C,N› Ti ‹C,N›, TiN on a substrate body, with freely selected CsN - mixing ratio have also been already recommended.<br>
From DE 195 3O 517 Al, metallic carbonitride—hardmaterial layers on a substrate body are also known, in which the metal of the metallic carbonitride layer contains two or more elements of the group Ti, Zr, Hf, V, Nb, Ta, Cr, Ho and W- The layer is deposited by using the CVD process, especially in form of a quaternary layer made of (Ti, Zr) ‹C,N)-<br><br>
For  an  indexable insert, as a special example  of  application,<br>
a coating made of an approximately 1 jam thick TiN-layer, a second<br>
B  urn thick ‹Ti,Zr) ‹C,N› layer and a last Al  O  - layer with  a<br>
2  3 thickness between  1 urn and 5 urn was deposited on  a hardmetal<br>
substrate body.<br>
The  above  mentioned PVD coatings, which can  be produced  from<br>
o approximately  4OO  C  onwards,  are used  in  most  cases  for<br>
temperature sensitive substrate bodies, especially in the coating<br>
of  high  speed  steels, which should not be  subjected  to high<br>
temperatures during the deposition.<br>
Besides, from the publications WO 92/O5296 or US 5 143 488, which are having similar contents, one can observe, that the TiN -coati ngs deposi ted by CVD—processes have tensi1e stresses, whereas the Ti N—coat i ngs deposi ted by PVD—process have compressive stresses, which do not lead to cracks as in the case of tensile stresses. In order to improve the resistance to fracture, it has therefore been recommended in these publications, to combine one or more CVD—layer or CVD-layers with one or more layers deposited by PVD—process respectively. Nitrides of titanium, hafnium and/or zirconium are recommended as material for the inner layer deposited by using the CVD—process and nitrides and carbonitrides of the above mentioned metals for layers  deposited by using the PVD-process.  As  regards  process<br><br>
technology, there exists the disadvantage, that two relatively expensive and different depositions ‹CVD, PVD) need to be carried out one after the other with different equipments- Moreover, it has been observed, that the raultilayered coating consisting of inner layers deposited by using CVD-process and at least one external layer deposited with the PVD-process, in case of larger thickness of the coating, has the tendency to chip off.<br>
Hence it is the task of the present invention to develop a cutti ng i nsert, whi ch does not have the above mentioned di sadvantages. The cutti ng i nsert should have upto 1arger coating thickness relatively high fracture toughness (bending strength). One should be able to execute the process needed for its production cost effectively and by using the minimum possible equipments.<br>
This task has been solved by a cutting insert as per this invention and which is described in the patent claim 1.<br>
The multilayered coating on a hard metal substrate body, cermet substrate body or ceramic substrate body has an external layer (cover coating), which is made of a single-phase or multi-phase layer of carbides, nitrides or carbonitride on zirconium base of hafnium base and which has internal compressive stresses. The layer or layers located underneath (below) have, without any exception,  tensile  stresses, whereby at least one or  the  only<br><br>
layer underneath it is made of titanium nitride, titanium carbide and/or titanium carbonitride. All layers are deposited by using the CVD—process, whereby it is also passible to have design versions, in which the cover coating can be made of many single layers having the same or different material composition- As per the present invention it is important, that the cover coating in each case contains zirconium or hafnium bonded with carbide, nitride or carbonitride and is combined with a layer below it, which is made of titanium carbide, titanium nitride and/or titanium carbonitride.<br>
Preferably the compressive stresses ^r&amp; lying between — 5OO MPa to — 25OO rtpa CAs per defi ni ti on, compressi ve stresses ar&amp; designated with negative values as against the tensile stresses for which positive values are specified).<br>
Especi al1y  as  si ngle—phase cover coati ng,  one can  select  a<br>
carbide,  nitride  or  carbonitride  of  zirconium  or   hafnium.<br>
However  as an alternative to this, there are  also  single—phase<br>
cover coatings made of a carbide, nitride or carbonitride of  the<br>
H  = Zr or Hf and H  = Ti, Hf,  Nb<br>
1	2<br>
  case, one speaks  about  so-called<br>
quaternary multimetal—carbonitrides.<br>
A two—phase exteral layer, which is generally preferred, consists<br>
of a carbide, nitride or carbonitride of zirconium or hafnium and<br>
ZrO .   ZrO   can be present either in  monoclinic  modification, 2       2<br><br>
tetragonal    modi f i cati on    and/or    cubi cal     nodi f i cation.<br>
Particularly  the  external layer can have a composition  in  the<br>
form  M   ‹C  N   ›, whereby M  = Zr or Hf and O-3 ‹_  x £  7.   In<br>
e    x  i—x	e<br>
case  the  cover  coating  is a  single—phase  one,  then  it  is<br>
distinguished  from  a two-phase coating thereby, that it  has  a<br>
uniform  structure  and  lattice  constant,  which   particularly<br>
i ncludes   tertiary   and   quaternary   carbi de,   ni tride    or<br>
carbonitride, in which zirconium or hafnium alone or totally must<br>
at least be present in SO atom X.  The concerned metal atoms  are<br>
then distributed statistically on a lower lattice, whereas  their<br>
metalloids, carbons and nitrogen are distibuted unarranged on the<br>
other lower lattice.<br>
In  a two phase layer, which is particularly made of  a  carbide,<br>
ni tr i de   or  carboni tride  of  z i rconi um  or  hafniurn  and   has<br>
additionally  ZrO , there exists two, side by side phases,  which<br>
2 are entirely different with respect to the crystal structure  and<br>
lattice.   The  second phase ZrO  is present  preferably  with  a<br>
2 relative proportion between 15 and 6O mass %.<br>
Accordi ng   to   a  further  development   of   thi s   i nventi on,<br>
additionally  one of the lower layers, between the cover  coating<br>
and  at least one of the layers close to the substrate body,  can<br>
be made of Al O -<br>
2 3<br><br>
Generally preferred thickness of the cover coating lies between 2 jam and maximum 10 jam, whereby preferably the total thickness of the inner layers, which are under tensile stress and the external layers, which are under compressive stress, lies between 5jjm and 25 31m, particularly between lO^µm and 2Ojaro.<br>
Preferred is a first TiN—layer with a thickness of upto 2 JIIB deposited on the substrate body and one or more TiCN—layers of upto 5 31m thickness, on which a single—phase or two—phase cover coating of upto 5^µm thickness has been deposited.<br>
For  the production of the cutting insert of the  type  mentioned<br>
above, the deposition is carried out an uninterrupted CVD—process<br>
o	o<br>
at  temperatures  between 9OO C and llOO C and  by  changing  the<br>
respective gas compositions.<br>
The compressive stress of an external layer made of a single-phase multimetal—carboni tri de can be parti cular1y enhanced thereby, that after the CVD—deposition, a heat treatment follows at  a  temperature  higher than the  substrate  body  temperature<br>
during  the  last  deposition.  The  concerned  temperatures  lie<br>
o between 950 C and the eutectic temperature of the material of the<br>
5ub5tate body.  The heat treatment lasts for IS minutes, so  that<br>
a  segregation  into a titanium rich and a zirconium  rich  phase<br>
takes place.<br><br>
The present invent!cm is further explained in detail with the help of examples of application.<br>
After the compl et i on of the CVD—process, the coat i ng i s preferably subjected to an additional, surface smoothening mechanical process, such as polishing with emery-brush or dry or wet shot blasting with fine shot blasting medium, preferably glass beads or corundum.<br>
In CVD—tests, various coating which are compiled in Table 1  have<br>
been  deposited  on indexable inserts made of a hard  metal.   On<br>
these  coatings, the stresses in the layer bordering the  surface<br>
have  been measured by using a measuring method with X—rays  (so—<br>
2 called  Sin    —  method).  For the purpose  of  comparison,  the<br>
measured values of TiN—layers and TiC—layers (refer example 1 and<br>
2)  which  were produced by using PVD—process are also  given  in<br>
Table  1.  It has been observed, that the layers deposited  using<br>
PVD—proces5  have high residual compress!ve stresses,  which  are<br>
already  known  from the state—of—the—art technology,  while  the<br>
TiN-layers,     TiC and  Ti    (C,N›   layers  according  to the examples     3<br>
to  5 have varyingly large tensile stresses, which  are  likewise<br>
known from the state—of—the—art technology.  As  against this, in<br>
examples  6  to 8, depositions according to  this  invent!cm are<br>
given, namely, in each case, an inner layer made of Ti (C,N)  and<br>
an  cover  coating made of Zr (C     N    ) (example 6) ,  a  two-<br>
O.49  O.5l phase layer made of Zr (C    N   )/Zr D  (example 7) and a  cover<br>
O.5  O.5      2 coating made of Hf (C    N   ).<br>
O.5  O.5<br><br>
Properties of hard material layers, in which tensile stresses are i ndicated Mi th positi ve si gn and compressi ve stresses with negative sign:<br><br>
In  order to establish the improved toughness of the  hard  metal<br>
bodi es,  which  are  coated accordi ng  to  thi s  i nventi on,  test<br>
samples  as per the standard DIN ISO 3327 have been produced  out<br>
of  a hard metal alloy (83.5 mass X WC, 11 mass %‹Ti,  Ta,  Nb)C,<br>
5.5 mass %  Co).  The test samples having the dimension L x H x  B<br>
= 20 x 5.25 x 6.5 mm were used to determine the bending strength.<br>
A  part of the test samples were coated with a layer made  of  Ti<br>
‹C    N   ) with help of the known CVD— process at a  temperature O.5  O.5<br><br>
o of  1010   C .   In another CVD—process, a  further  1ot  of  test<br>
samples were provided with a two—layered coating made of B^µro  Ti<br>
‹C    N   ) and 3^um Zr (C    N   )-  After the determination  of<br>
O.5  O.5	O.5  0-5<br>
the  layer  thickness,  in each case 11  test  samples,  for  the<br>
purpose  of statistic were subjected to load till fracture.   The<br>
test results are presented in a Weibull-statistic in Figure 1  of<br>
the  accompanying  drawi ngs.   The f1exural  strength  1  of  the<br>
2 uncoated test  sample is 2O95 + I5O N/mm .  With an approximately<br>
8j_im thick coating made of Ti CC    N   ) the flexural strength 2<br>
O.5  0.5<br>
2 of  the test sample is reduced to 1332 +. 34 N/mm .   This  effect<br>
has  been described many times in the technical  literature,  for<br>
example,  in  the  US 5 143 488.  Thicker the  layer,  that  much<br>
larger is this effect.<br>
Likewise in Figure 1, the flexure strength 3 of a coating,  which<br>
according to this invention is made of 831m Ti CC    N   ) and  3<br>
0.5  O.5 jam  Zr (C    N   ) is shown-  In this case the mean value of  the 0.5  O.5<br>
2 flexural  strength 2O2l J: 194 N/mm  is only marginally less  than<br>
that  of  the uncoated test samples.  This  indicates,  that  the<br>
fracture—toughness of the composite body coated according to this<br>
invention is practically maintained fully.<br>
Further, indexable inserts of the type CNttßl2O4l2 - 5 were produced out of a hard metal al1oy havi ng the chemi cal composition 83.5 mass X liC, 11 mass X (Ti , Ta, Nb›C, 5.5 massX Co and coated by means of a CVD—process with the layers (5) and  ‹6›<br><br>
in  the  order  (sequence) of the layer  specified  in  Table  1.<br>
Machining tests were carried out with these cutting inserts.  The<br>
toughness  behavior  was  investigated  in  a  pin—turning   test<br>
according  to  Brechbuehl.   Hereby  it  concerns  a   transverse<br>
machining (facing) of four round rods of 4O mm diameter which are<br>
clamped  parallel to the axis of rotation and which are  made  of<br>
2 steel  C45N ‹57O N/fiun ).  The cutting corner makes four cuts per<br>
revolution  into the material.  Each time after three  runs,  the<br>
feed *f' is systematically increased.  Further parameters of  the<br>
cut  are cutting speed V  = 25O m/mm and depth of the cut a  =  2<br>
c	p<br>
mm.   During this test, fracture toughness of the composite  body<br>
made  of  hard  metal and the coating on  it  were  subjected  to<br>
special  stresses.   The results of these tests are  compiled  in<br>
Table 2.<br>
Table 2<br>
The  number of runs during the fracture toughness test  according to Brechbuhl.<br><br><br>
The indexable insert with the coating ‹5› according to the state-of-the-art technology failed due to fracture of the cutting edge at a feed of f = O.4 mm/ revolution after 16 runs. The indexable insert with the coating ‹6› according to this invention has achieved 34 runs during the facing operation.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
