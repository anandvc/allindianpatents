BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the block diagram of the Menu Structure.<br>
Figure 2 shows the block diagram of the User Database. Figure 3 shows the flow chart of the Registration Process. Figure 4 shows the flow chart of the Menu Selection Process.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
Figure 1 describes the menu structure of the MFP. After authenticating itself, user can select these menu items. Level 1 of menu structure is Login; so first user is required to Login the MFP means authenticate itself. Next level there are different menu items. Next Level will comprise of submenu items of each upper layer menu items. For example there are ml submenu items (MI11 to Ml 1m1) of menu item MM.<br>
Figure 2 describes user database. User database consists of list of array of fingerprint. Corresponding to each user there will be an array of fingerprints. First member of an array will be the user's authenticating finger's finger print FP1 (Authenticating finger is the finger which will be used by user for authenticating itself). All fingerprints of the array will be used by user to select a menu item once user is authenticated.<br>
Figure 3 describes the registration process of a user. First MFP is put in registration mode. Now user is required to put one finger which will be used by him for authentication purpose. Fingerprint is captured and it is searched in the first member of all arrays in User database means FP1 of all existing users. If captured fingerprint matches with any existing one it means user is already in data base and MFP comes out of registration mode. If captured finger print does not match with any existing one, then a new array for this new user will be added to User database and captured finger print is stored as the first finger print (FP1) in newly created array. Now user can put other fingers one by one on finger print sensor. Each captured finger print will be searched in the existing finger prints of newly created array corresponding to this user; if it matches with any one then that finger print is discarded otherwise it will be added in the array. MFP will automatically come out of registration mode after storing required number of fingerprints. Required number of fingerprints will be equal to maximum number of sub menu items under any menu item. Format of fingerprint will depend on the finger print sensor and depending on that different fingerprint matching methods can be used.<br>
Figure 4 describes the menu selection process including the authentication process. Normally MFP remains in user mode. Whenever a user put a finger on <br>
finger print sensor; fingerprint is captured and it is searched with all FP1 in User database. If captured finger print matches with any existing FP1; this implies that user is an authenticated user otherwise MFP will return to its initial condition. If user is an authenticated user then now it can select different menu items. The array, which has the matched FP1, only will now be searched for menu selection process. After authentication user can select any menu item which is at Leved (L=1). When user put a finger on finger print sensor; fingerprint is captured and searched within current user's array. If it matches with any fingerprint other than FP1 &amp; FP2 then a menu item corresponding to that will be selected. Now user can select any sub menu item under the selected menu item. These submenu item will be addressed as Level2 (L=2) items. If captured fingerprint matches with FP1 then it will go to upper level i.e. coming out of the selected menu item. If user is at LeveM of menu then it will go back to LeveM again. If captured finger print matches with FP2 then user will be logged out means for using MFP user will have to authenticate itself. So the FP2 will be used as the logout fingerprint and FP1 as login finger print. Whenever a menu item is selected, a voice pronouncing the selected menu item will be spoken out by MFP. For this recorded voice corresponding to each menu item will be stored in MFP.<br>
The proposed invention will be understood on reading the description of the invention in connection with the given drawings.<br>
MFP mention in this invention is required to have a finger print capturing sensor which will give some digitalized data corresponding to a finger print.<br>
A data base will be created for every user in MFP. This database will be containing finger prints of that particular user. Number of finger prints of the user's fingers stored in database depends on the maximum number of the menu items at any level. Structure of user database and menu is given in figure 1 and 2 respectively.<br>
Referring to drawing 3 and 4; first a user is required to get registered. One particular finger of user will be used for authentication, it depends on user which finger he or she want to use. Depending on the maximum number of menu items in any particular layer, user is required to give that many fingers' print to MFP. Registration process is described with help of flow chart in figure 2.<br>
So after registration user can use MFP by first identifying itself to MFP. Finger used for authentication is also used for going to higher level in menu structure. A particular finger will be used for logout from MFP. By putting a finger user can enter in menu item corresponding to that finger. Whenever a particular menu item is selected; that is pronounced by MFP so that user can know what menu item it has selected. Whole operation is described through a flow chart in figure 16.<br>
A user can get the print out of a configuration details having information what finger is required to be put on fingerprint capturing to select a particular menu.<br>
Structure of menu items is given in Figure I.This figure describes the menu structure of the MFP. After authenticating itself, user can select these menu items. Level 1 of menu structure is Login; so first user is required to Login the MFP means authenticate it self. Next level there is different menu items. Next Level will comprise of submenu items of each upper layer menu items. For example there are ml submenu items (MI11 to Ml 1m1) of menu item MM.<br>
Structure of user database is given in Figure 2. This figure describes user database. User database consists of list of array of fingerprint. Corresponding to each user there will be an array of fingerprints. First member of an array will be the user's authenticating finger's fingerprint FP1 (Authenticating finger is the finger which will be used by user for authenticating itself). All fingerprints of the array will be used by user to select a menu item once user is authenticated.<br>
Figure 3 shows the flow diagram of registration process. This figure describes the registration process of a user. First MFP is put in registration mode. Now user is required to put one finger which will be used by him for authentication purpose. Fingerprint is captured and it is searched in the first member of all arrays in User <br>
database means FP1 of all existing users. If captured fingerprint matches with any existing one it means user is already in database and MFP comes out of registration mode. If captured finger print does not match with any existing one, then a new array for this new user will be added to User database and captured finger print is stored as the first finger print (FP1) in newly created array. Now user can put other fingers one by one on finger print sensor. Each captured finger print will be searched in the existing finger prints of newly created array corresponding to this user; if it matches with any one then that finger print is discarded otherwise it will be added in the array. MFP will automatically come out of registration mode after storing required number of fingerprints. Required number of fingerprints will be equal to maximum number of sub menu items under any menu item.<br>
Figure 4 shows the flow diagram of menu selection process. This figure describes the menu selection process including the authentication process. Normally MFP remains in user mode. Whenever a user put a finger on finger print sensor; fingerprint is captured and it is searched with all FP1 in User database. If captured finger print matches with any existing FP1; this implies that user is an authenticated user otherwise MFP will return to its initial condition. If user is an authenticated user then now it can select different menu items. The array, which has the matched FP1, only will now be searched for menu selection process.<br>
After authentication user can select any menu item which is at LeveM (L=1). When user put a finger on finger print sensor; fingerprint is captured and searched within current user's array. If it matches with any fingerprint other than FP1 &amp; FP2 then a menu item corresponding to that will be selected. Now user can select any sub menu item under the selected menu item. These submenu items will be addressed as Level2 (L=2) items. If captured fingerprint matches with FP1 then it will go to upper level i.e. coming out of the selected menu item. If user is at LeveM of menu then it will go back to LeveM again.<br>
If captured finger print matches with FP2 then user will be logged out means for using MFP user will have to authenticate itself. So the FP2 will be used as the logout fingerprint and FP1 as login fingerprint.<br>
