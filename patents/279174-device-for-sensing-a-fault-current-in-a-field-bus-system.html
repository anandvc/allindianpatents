				<td>Device for Sensing a Fault Current in a Field Bus System<br>
The present invention generally relates to an electrical switching circuit for<br>
determining a fault in a bus system and to a corresponding method of use.<br>
Communication between electronic control devices as well as control and<br>
monitoring of sensors and actuators in motor vehicles are now increasingly being handled by bus<br>
systems, an example of which is the controller area network (CAN), otherwise known as the<br>
abbreviated form CAN bus. In these systems, electrical signals are transmitted via electrical lines<br>
between a sending and a receiving bus station. During operation, such lines are susceptible to<br>
damage due to mechanical load or other influences, leading to transmission faults. Damaged lines<br>
should no longer be used in a bus system, but conventional systems have only limited ability to<br>
detect faults on the lines of a bus system. Thus, the options for reacting to a detected fault are<br>
limited, for example, to disconnecting the damaged section. Furthermore, conventional<br>
mechanisms for testing bus lines are limited to measuring the voltage of the bus lines. This has<br>
the disadvantage that bus lines, which tend to oscillate because of a particular line length, cannot<br>
be monitored reliably for faults. Examples of such faults are short circuits to external voltages<br>
(such as the supply voltage) or short circuits to ground.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to improve existing means and methods for<br>
detecting faults in bus systems.<br>
 <br>
This object is achieved according to the present invention by means of an<br>
electrical switching circuit for operating a bus of a field bus system, which circuit comprises<br>
means for determining a fault of the bus, especially a fault current. According to this aspect of<br>
the invention, the means for determining the fault contain first means for determining a first<br>
current of a first bus line, second means for determining a second current of a second bus line<br>
and detecting means for detecting a fault based on the first and second currents. The present<br>
invention can be used in principle for all multi-conductor buses in which total currents are to be<br>
monitored. The present invention is particularly suited for bus systems having two-conductor<br>
lines. These include the CAN bus and the RS 485 bus. In many field bus systems, such as the<br>
CAN bus, transmission of control and data information between the bus stations is provided via<br>
two-conductor or multi-conductor bus lines, to which the bus stations are coupled. During<br>
undisturbed operation, a definite current flows into a first line of the bus (or part of the bus) and a<br>
second current of equal value flows back out via a second line of the bus. Thus, the current is<br>
dispatched via one line in one direction and returns via a terminating resistor on the second line.<br>
The present invention proposes determining the two currents and detecting a fault of the bus on<br>
the basis of this measurement. In contrast to conventional methods, therefore, no voltage<br>
measurement is made in the bus lines. Instead, the currents are measured on the lines. Thereby, it<br>
is ensured, especially in the case of long bus lines, that oscillation tendencies of the bus lines do<br>
not make the measurements unreliable or make them require disproportionately long time. In<br>
addition, certain faults cannot be determined by a pure voltage measurement under certain<br>
boundary conditions.<br>
The present invention is applicable to all bus systems in which a definite current<br>
flows on a first bus line in one direction and on a second bus line in the opposite direction. The<br>
means for determining the currents can be formed advantageously as shunt resistors, for example,<br>
 <br>
and coupled directly to the respective bus line. The voltage, which drops across the resistors,<br>
yields the current through the bus line. Other options for determining the current are based on<br>
inductive coupling, for example with reed sensors. The means for detecting the fault are<br>
implemented on the basis of the respective measurement technique by comparing voltages based<br>
on the currents. For example, it is possible for this purpose to use comparators, which compare<br>
the corresponding voltage values.<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration of the present invention, a driver<br>
stage for driving a bus line is configured and used as a means for determining a current of the bus<br>
line. According to this advantageous aspect of the invention, no actual additional component such<br>
as the shunt resistor mentioned above is integrated into the bus line. Instead, a component of a<br>
driver stage is used. Such a driver stage is advantageously a component provided for operation of<br>
the bus line in the intended manner. Such components may be found, for example, in what are<br>
known as CAN transceivers, which provide the connection between a CAN controller for the bus<br>
protocol and the two bus lines or a plurality of bus lines. The data exchange between the bus<br>
stations is achieved via the interface provided by the CAN transceiver. Similar components are<br>
used in other bus systems. They can benefit in the same way from the present invention. In the case<br>
of a CAN bus, the sending part contains a driver for each bus line and a driver-control switching<br>
circuit. What is known as the high-side driver is coupled with the supply voltage of the CAN<br>
transceiver and allows current to flow into the first bus line. What is known as a low-side driver is<br>
coupled with ground and receives the current from a further bus line. In general, components are<br>
connected directly in the current-carrying path of the bus lines in the case of such driver stages.<br>
According to this aspect of the present invention, these components are used for determining the<br>
current. This is possible, for example, by using the voltage drop across the components to<br>
determine the current. In particular, in one advantageous configuration, a driver transistor of the<br>
 <br>
driver stage is used as the means for determining a current.<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration, a protective diode of a driver<br>
stage coupled to a bus line is used for determining the current. The advantage of such an<br>
arrangement is that the protective diode is capable of greatly enhancing the measurement<br>
sensitivity by virtue of a nonlinear characteristic. Thus, even small deviations from a desired<br>
current can already be detected. The same is true for transistors that behave as diodes or other<br>
electrical components having nonlinear behavior. For this purpose, it is possible, for example, to<br>
position the diode or the transistor in the feedback branch of an amplifier circuit, such as a<br>
voltage follower or similar device.<br>
According to a further advantageous configuration, comparing means for<br>
comparison of voltage values are provided in the electrical switching circuit, the voltage values<br>
being based on the first current and the second current and the comparing means being<br>
configured so as to execute at least two separate comparison operations. According to the<br>
invention, therefore, it is provided that a plurality of comparison operations can be executed, thus<br>
permitting correlation of faults with particular fault types on the two bus lines. For example, it is<br>
possible to identify short circuits of each individual line to ground or to external voltages as well<br>
as short circuits to one another or line breaks. This is possible because more than one comparison<br>
can take place.<br>
In an advantageous configuration, the electrical switching circuit is configured to<br>
determine the fault as a function of the sending condition of the bus. Thereby, it is ensured that a<br>
predefined operating condition of the bus lines is achieved, thus facilitating determination of the<br>
specific faults. In the CAN bus, for example, a distinction is made between dominant and<br>
recessive bus conditions. A recessive condition exists if all drivers of all bus stations connected<br>
to the bus are passive. The bus then exhibits a specific potential of the lines. When at least one of<br>
 <br>
the drivers of a bus station is active, this represents a dominant condition. In the dominant<br>
condition, a specific potential difference exists between the bus lines. Moreover, a definite<br>
current flow is obtained in this operating condition. It is advantageous to determine the fault in<br>
dominant sending operation, because, in this condition, the currents propagate as intended on the<br>
lines, in the manner defined above. If the current or currents on the lines deviates or deviate from<br>
the specifications, determination of a fault current is possible in the dominant condition.<br>
A further advantageous configuration of the electrical switching circuit provides<br>
for disconnection of one or more defective bus lines as the reaction to a fault of the bus. These<br>
bus lines are no longer used for further data transmission. Instead, it can be advantageously<br>
provided that defective bus lines for which a fault has been detected will be replaced by<br>
functional redundant bus lines. This aspect of the present invention is particularly suited for<br>
multi-channel bus systems, in which a plurality of separate buses is present.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
means for detecting the electrical switching circuit are configured to detect a short circuit of one<br>
of the bus lines to ground or a short circuit of one of the bus lines to an external voltage. In<br>
particular, detection of both faults is also provided by the inventive configuration of the electrical<br>
switching circuit. Since, according to the invention, the currents are determined on the bus lines,<br>
certain types of faults of the bus system can be distinguished by comparison of the currents in<br>
terms of their absolute and relative values. Thus, it is possible not only to sense that a fault exists,<br>
but also to assign such a fault to a particular defect. This permits flexible reaction to the fault.<br>
Moreover, a diagnosis of the bus system is already obtained in this way.<br>
The object of the present invention is also achieved by a method for determining a<br>
fault in a multi-channel bus system, which method includes the following steps: determining a<br>
first current of a first bus line, determining a second current of a second bus line, comparing<br>
 <br>
values derived from the first and second currents, and outputting a comparison result that<br>
corresponds to a fault on the bus lines, the first bus line and the second bus line being two bus<br>
lines of a common bus section of a bus system. According to this advantageous process, it is<br>
possible in general to determine the faults that may occur on a bus section of a multi-channel bus<br>
system, which section is composed of at least two electrical lines. In this way, transmission of<br>
control and data information between the bus stations is provided for certain bus systems, such<br>
as, for example, the CAN bus. In undisturbed operation, a definite current flows into a first line<br>
of the bus section and a current of equal value flows out via a second line of the bus section.<br>
According to embodiments of the present invention, this symmetry is used to determine short<br>
circuits or breaks of the bus lines.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the present invention, the<br>
comparison step comprises at least one first comparison and one second comparison, the first<br>
comparison being provided in order to determine a first fault condition of the bus and the second<br>
comparison being provided in order to determine a second fault condition of the bus. According<br>
to embodiments of the present invention, the first and second fault conditions pertain to different<br>
physical defects of the bus. On the basis of the cited advantageous configuration, it is evident that<br>
the inventive method is suitable for distinguishing a plurality of different fault situations on a<br>
bus. Thus, not only can the bus lines be tested for values above or below preselected levels, but,<br>
in addition, short circuits of the two bus lines individually or relative to one another can be<br>
ascertained. Furthermore, the disadvantages of a voltage measurement are avoided by the<br>
measurement of currents passing on the bus lines. This has the positive consequence that even<br>
long bus lines, which may exhibit oscillating behavior, can be tested reliably. In particular, a<br>
short circuit to ground can also be recognized according to the present invention. Moreover, it is<br>
also possible to detect unilateral short circuits of a bus line to an external voltage or to ground,<br>
 <br>
which short circuits may lead to communication faults.<br>
According to a further advantageous embodiment of the present invention, a first<br>
comparison voltage based on the mean value of the two voltages of the bus lines is compared in<br>
the first comparison with a second comparison value based on a combination of the mean value<br>
of the voltages on the bus lines and voltages derived from currents through the first and second<br>
bus lines.<br>
In an inventive switching circuit, the operations relative to a CAN bus can be<br>
described as follows: During a short circuit of a second bus line to ground, the current flows from<br>
the first bus line via the bus to the second bus line and from there directly to ground. This means<br>
that the current does not take the regular path via the bus lines. If a ("second") sensing means (such<br>
as, for example, a shunt resistor) is coupled into the second line, less current flows via the second<br>
sensing means. Consequently, the voltage ratio shifts to the effect that a second comparison voltage<br>
at the second sensing means assumes a lower value. As a result, the output of the second<br>
comparison means switches from a first to a second output condition, for example from high to<br>
low. An analogous operation can be observed when a short circuit of the first bus line to ground is<br>
present. In the case of a short circuit of the first bus line to an external voltage, no current flows<br>
through the first sensing means, which is coupled to the first bus line. Via the bus, a fault current<br>
flows out from the position of the short circuit from the first bus line to the second bus line and,<br>
from there, via the second sensing means back to ground. Consequently, the voltage ratio at the<br>
comparison means is shifted, to the effect that the second comparison voltage assumes a higher<br>
value. As a result, the output of the first comparison means switches from a first to a second logical<br>
condition, for example from high to low. The circuit behaves in exactly the same way in the case of<br>
a short circuit of the second bus line to an external voltage.<br>
In the recessive condition, currents do not flow through either the first or the<br>
 <br>
second sensing means. The sensing means are disposed in such a way that they can sense the<br>
currents in the bus lines. For this purpose, the sensing means can be connected as shunt elements<br>
(resistor, diode, transistor, etc.) in the lines. Advantageously, they are disposed between the<br>
drivers and the terminal points for the lines. As discussed above, the sensing means can also be<br>
implemented as parts of the driver stages, for example by determining a voltage drop across a<br>
transistor of the driver stage.<br>
The present invention will be discussed hereinafter on the basis of exemplary<br>
embodiments with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein<br>

to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention,<br>

embodiment of the present invention,<br>

embodiment of the present invention,<br>

embodiment of the present invention, and<br>
Fig. 5 is a timing diagram illustrating levels on a bus system.<br>
Fig. 1 is a simplified circuit diagram of an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention. An inventive fault-detection switching circuit SENS is disposed between the two<br>
transmission lines CAN-H, CAN-L of a CAN bus system. In a typical CAN bus system, a<br>
plurality of two-conductor transmission sections is provided, each having two transmission lines<br>
CAN-H, CAN-L. Line CAN-H is coupled to an output driver known as high-side driver HS-D.<br>
This generates voltage and/or current levels according to a standardized specification. The same<br>
is true for transmission line CAN-L, which is coupled to a corresponding driver LS-D (low-side<br>
 <br>
driver). Resistors R-H and R-L are coupled as first and second sensing means to lines CAN-H<br>
and CAN-L. A detecting means, namely switching circuit DET, is connected to these resistors for<br>
detecting a fault or for detecting fault currents. The mean voltage value at node N1 is formed via<br>
voltage divider R1/R2. This value is supplied to comparators CP1 and CP2, which operate as<br>
comparing means, respectively, at a positive and a negative input. The respective other terminals<br>
of comparators CP1 and CP2 receive their voltages from a resistor series R3, R4 and R5.<br>
According to an advantageous aspect of the invention, the resistances of R1 and R2 have the<br>
same value, and so, within certain tolerances, exactly the mean potential of the two voltages on<br>
lines CAN-H and CAN-L is present at node N1. Voltage divider R3, R4 and R5 is dimensioned<br>
such that the voltages at nodes N2 and N3 deliver a constant predefined output signal relative to<br>
the potential at node N1 during normal operation, or, in other words, in the absence of a fault. In<br>
the present case, comparators CP1 and CP2 have a logical high or "1" level at their respective<br>
outputs COUT1 and COUT2. In this regard, it is considered according to the present invention<br>
that, in normal operation, a current flowing into line CAN-H corresponds in magnitude to the<br>
current exiting this part of the bus section via line CAN-L. For this purpose, the current is<br>
returned via a terminating resistor R-CAN. As long as the aforesaid condition of normal<br>
operation is satisfied, the input voltages for the comparators are in a ratio relative to one another<br>
that forces the outputs COUT1 and COUT2 of comparators CP1 and CP2 into a condition<br>
defined as normal condition or fault-free condition. If a fault now develops in the dashed area, or,<br>
in other words, outside the fault-detection switching circuit SENS of the bus section, for example<br>
due to a short circuit to ground or a short circuit to an external voltage, it will cause a difference<br>
to appear between the two currents on the CAN-H and CAN-L lines. The voltage dividers<br>
between the lines react to a fault condition by changed node voltages at nodes Nl, N2 and N3. If<br>
the fault exceeds a certain limit value, the node voltages Nl, N2 and N3 change so much that<br>
 <br>
comparators CP1 and CP2 react thereto by reversing the outputs COUT1 and COUT2. In total,<br>
the two outputs COUT1 and COUT2 of the comparators can assume three different conditions in<br>
combination. Thus, it is possible to detect, for example, one normal condition and two different<br>
fault conditions in total. In the case of a short circuit of CAN-L to ground, the current flows from<br>
CAN-H via the bus to CAN-L and from there directly to ground and therefore not via R-L.<br>
Thereby, the voltage ratio is shifted, and, so, the second comparison voltage N3 at comparator<br>
CP2 assumes a lower value. As a result, the output COUT2 of comparator CP2 switches from<br>
high to low. The circuit behaves analogously in the case of a short circuit of CAN-H to ground.<br>
In the case of a short circuit of CAN-H to an external voltage, no current flows through R-H. Via<br>
the bus, a fault current flows from the short circuit at CAN-H to CAN-L and from there via R-L<br>
back to ground. Thus, the voltage ratio is shifted such that the second comparison voltage<br>
COUT2 at second comparator CP2 assumes a higher value. As a result, the output COUT1 of<br>
comparator CP1 switches from high to low. The circuit behaves analogously in the case of a<br>
short circuit of CAN-L to an external voltage. In the recessive condition, currents do not flow<br>
through R-H or R-L.<br>
For further illustration of the functional principle, Fig. 2 shows a simplified circuit<br>
diagram of a switching circuit according to an advantageous aspect of the present invention. The<br>
circuit is largely identical or similar to the switching circuit described above with reference to<br>
Fig. 1. In addition, resistor R4 is now divided into two parts, thus offering the possibility of<br>
tapping a node voltage N4. The bridge voltage Ubr is present between nodes N1 and N4. If the<br>
current through R-H is exactly as large as the current through R-L, and the currents are flowing<br>
in opposite directions in normal operation, as described above, the bridge voltage Ubr is zero.<br>
However, if the current through R-H (the outwardly flowing current) is larger than the current<br>
through R-L (the inwardly flowing current), the (virtual) bridge voltage Ubr becomes positive. If<br>
 <br>
Ubr exceeds a threshold value, comparator CP2 is reversed. In this way, it is indicated that the<br>
fault current Ifault = I-H + I-L is too large and a connection to an external potential exists.<br>
Comparator CP2 generates the complementary fault signal. This means that it indicates when the<br>
fault current exhibits the reversed sign.<br>
Fig. 3 is a simplified circuit diagram of a further advantageous configuration of the<br>
present invention. The circuit according to Fig. 3 has substantially the same layout as the circuit of<br>
Figs. 1 and 2. In addition, diodes D1 and D2 are now provided. Since a current total is monitored<br>
exclusively in dominant condition of output drivers HS-D and LS-D, an advantageous<br>
configuration of the present invention comprises the use of the high-side and low-side switches as<br>
bridging elements (shunts). Correspondingly, the resistor R-H is the conducting resistor Ron-HS of<br>
the high-side driver transistor HS-D. Second resistor R-L is implemented by the conducting resistor<br>
Ron-LS of the low-side driver transistor.<br>
The CAN bus is able to occupy two conditions: a recessive and a dominant<br>
condition. The recessive condition exists when all drivers of the components connected to the<br>
bus (typically transceivers) are passive, meaning that none of the drivers is in sending condition.<br>
In this situation, the difference voltage between the two bus lines is approximately 0 V. The<br>
possible tolerances of the voltage in the recessive condition are standardized (ISO 11898).<br>
Accordingly, the voltage levels may lie between approximately -50 mV and +500 mV. The<br>
logical level assigned to this condition is defined as the high level or logical "1". As soon as at<br>
least one driver on the bus switches to active condition, the entire bus is said to be dominant. The<br>
difference voltage on the bus is then typically 2.25 V, although this voltage can also vary within a<br>
definite range. Accordingly, the voltage can assume values between 1.5 and 3 V. This dominant<br>
condition is defined as logical "0" or low level. Diodes D1 and D2 are the protective diodes of<br>
high-side driver HS-D and of low-side driver LS-D. By means of appropriate coupling, these may<br>
 <br>
be disposed outside the circuit, or, in other word, between the outputs of the circuit and the bus<br>
lines CAN-H, CAN-L to be sensed. In this advantageous configuration, the voltage divider<br>
comprising R3, R4 and R5 is continuously supplied with voltage. As a result, definite reference<br>
voltages are present at the comparator inputs in the recessive condition, thus permitting fault<br>
sensing even in the recessive condition. Another arrangement is presented in Fig. 4.<br>
Fig. 4 shows a further advantageous configuration of the present invention. In this<br>
advantageous configuration, not only are the resistors R-H and R-L (according to Fig. 1)<br>
implemented by the conducting resistors of the driver stages Ron-HS, Ron-LS, but, also, the<br>
diodes (protective diodes of the driver stages) D1 and D2 are additionally incorporated into the<br>
bridging path, in the bridge branches. This configuration is therefore particularly advantageous<br>
because the nonlinear diode characteristic leads to enhanced sensitivity at very low fault currents<br>
through the diodes. In this advantageous configuration, the voltage divider comprising R3, R4<br>
and R5 is continuously supplied with voltage. As a result, definite reference voltages are present<br>
at the comparator inputs in the recessive condition, thus permitting fault sensing even in the<br>
recessive condition.<br>
Fig. 5 shows the time profiles of the signals on bus lines CAN-H and CAN-L. Also<br>
illustrated are a logic signal TXO and the signals at comparators CP1 and CP2. As long as no sending<br>
operation is taking place, meaning that TXO is at logical high, the comparators in the configurations<br>
according to Fig. 1 and Fig. 2 are in an undefined condition. As soon as TXO initiates sending<br>
operation, the bus switches from the recessive to the dominant condition. At instant TO, an initial<br>
value of comparators CP1 and CP2 can be tapped and a fault on one of the bus lines can be<br>
determined on the basis of these values. According to the present invention, such fault detection, or,<br>
in other words, the determination of a fault of the bus lines, takes place as a function of the operating<br>
condition of the bus.<br>
