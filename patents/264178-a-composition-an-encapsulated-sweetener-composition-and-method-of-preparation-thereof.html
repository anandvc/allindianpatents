THERMALLY STABLE, HIGH TENSILE STRENGTH<br>
ENCAPSULATED ACTIVES<br>
5	<br>
	CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
		This application is a continuation-in-part of both U.S. Application No. 10/955,149,<br>
	filed September 30, 2004 and U.S. Application No. 10/955,225, filed September 30, 2004,<br>
	the contents all of which are incorporated herein, by reference.<br>
10	<br>
	FIELD<br>
		Included are thermally stabilized enXXXsulated compositions. The thermally stabilized<br>
	compositions include an active which resisrs'degradation or decomposition at higher<br>
	temperatures such as the temperatures required for extrusion of the thermally stabilized<br>
15	compositions with a high molecular weight polymer.<br>
	BACKGROUND<br>
		Encapsulated intense sweeteners have a particular advantage when included in gum<br>
	compositions such as chewing gum and bubble gum compositions. The encapsulated<br>
20	sweeteners are not immediately released as sugar would be when included in a chewing gum.<br>
	By contrast, an encapsulated sweetener composition provides extended sweetening on<br>
	chewing because the sweetener is not released until the encapsulating material has been<br>
	subjected to mastication.<br>
25		Intense sweeteners such as aspartame (APM) and acesulfame potassium (Ace-K) have<br>
	been used in encapsulated compositions in combination with high molecular weight polymers<br>
	which allow for their slow release upon chewing in a gum composition.<br>
		Sucralose is another popular intense sweetener which is derived from sucrose in<br>
30	which one or more hydroxy groups are replaced by chlorine atoms. This compound is<br>
	described in U.K. Patent No. 1,543,167, the disclosure of which is incorporated herein by<br>
	reference. Sucralose may be referred to by different chemical names including: 4-chloro-4-<br><br>
	WO 2006/039519	PCT/US2005/035237<br>
	deoxy-a-D-galactopyranosyl, l,6-dichlorol,6-dideoxy- β-D-fructofuranoside, and known as<br>
	4,1;6;-trichloro-4, 1 ',6'-trideoxygalactosucrose.<br>
		Sucralose is relatively stable and inert. This stability includes exhibiting stability in<br>
5	acid aqueous solutions, in marked contrast to peptide-based sweeteners such as aspartame.<br>
	Under completely dry conditions, however, sucralose which is present in a crystalline form<br>
	tends to discolor in response to elevated temperatures. For example, such discoloration can be<br>
	exhibited after twenty minutes of exposure of pure dry sucralose to a temperature of 100°C,<br>
	wherein the color changes to a pale brown. This degradation of sucralose results in a<br>
10	commercially unacceptable product. This high temperature instability of sucralose has made<br>
	it commercially impractical to prepare an encapsulated sucralose with the extrusion<br>
	techniques used to prepare the encapsulated APM and Ace-K compositions.<br>
		The heat stability issues of sucralose were addressed in U.S. Patent No. 4,971,797 to<br>
15	Cherukuri, et al. Cherukuri provides a method of preparing a co-crystallized/ precipitated<br>
	complex of cyclodextrin and sucralose which reduces the degradation of the sucralose when<br>
	the complex is exposed to heat. The method of Cherukuri uses an organic solvent, such as<br>
	methanol, in the co-crystallization in order to allow the method to be conducted at room<br>
	temperature. The co-crystallized / precipitated complex must then be subjected to an<br>
20	additional process step to ensure removal of the methanol, a highly toxic material. Proper<br>
	handling and disposal of methanol is also required in such a process and is undesirable in<br>
	view of environmental concerns.<br>
		There is a need for an encapsulated sucralose composition having enhanced stability<br>
25	and which may be used in a variety of compositions including gum compositions.<br>
		The compositions of some embodiments are designed to enhance the stability of<br>
	actives contained therein and to make them more resistant to heat both during processing and<br>
	during storage.<br>
30	<br>
	SUMMARY<br>
		Some embodiments include a thermally stabilized active composition and a high<br>
	molecular weight polymer which at least partially encapsulates the thermally stabilized active<br>
2<br><br>
	WO 2006/039519	PCT/US2005/035237<br>
	compositions. One benefit provided by the thermally stabilized active composition is that it<br>
	has enhanced resistance to degradation of the active at high temperatures.<br>

30	<br>
	DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
		As used herein the transitional term "comprising," (also "comprises," etc.) which is<br>
	synonymous with "including," "containing," or "characterized by," is inclusive or open-ended<br>
3<br><br>
	WO 2006/039519	PCT/US2005/035237<br>
	and does not exclude additional, unrecited elements or method steps, regardless of its use in<br>
	the preamble or the body of a claim.<br>
		As used herein, the terms "bubble gum" and "chewing gum" are used interchangeably<br>
5	and are both meant to include any gum compositions.<br>
		As used herein, the term "active" refers to any composition which may be included in<br>
	the encapsulated compositions of some embodiments, wherein the active provides some<br>
	desirable property upon release from encapsulation. Examples of suitable actives include<br>
10	sweeteners, such as sucralose, flavors, breath fresheners, sensates such as coolers, wanner<br>
	and spicy components, medicaments, vitamins, and combinations thereof.<br>
		As used herein, the term "thermally stabilized active" refers to an active which has<br>
	been treated to allow the active to be subjected to higher temperatures without<br>
15	decomposition, degradation, and/or discoloration of the active. These temperatures are<br>
	higher than the temperatures at which the free or untreated actives would normally begin to<br>
	decompose, degrade, and/or discolor.<br>
		The thermally stabilized composition of some embodiments may include an active<br>
20	which resists decomposition or degradation at high temperatures. The thermally stabilized<br>
	composition may be prepared by different methods such as encapsulation or complexation.<br>
		The encapsulated composition of some embodiments includes a thermally stabilized<br>
	active composition in combination with an encapsulating polymer. Since the thermally<br>
25	stabilized active composition is resistant to heat degradation compared with free active,<br>
	especially wherein the active is sucralose, thermally stabilized active composition may be<br>
	combined with the polymer by melt extrusion. This provides an encapsulated composition<br>
	which is suitable for use in a variety of confectionary products including gum compositions.<br>
	The active may be present in any desired amount such as from about 5% to about 50% by<br>
30	weight of the encapsulated composition.<br>
		A variety of different sweeteners may be used in the compositions of some<br>
	embodiments. These sweeteners may be selected from a wide range of materials including<br>
	water-soluble sweeteners, water-soluble artificial sweeteners, water-soluble sweeteners<br>
4<br><br>
	WO 2006/039519	PCT/US2005/035237<br>
	derived from naturally occurring water-soluble sweeteners, dipeptide based sweeteners, and<br>
	protein based sweeteners, including mixtures thereof. Without being limited to particular<br>
	sweeteners, representative categories and examples include:<br>
		(a)	water-soluble sweetening agents such as dihydrochalcones, monellin, steviosides,<br>
5	glycyrrhizin, dihydroflavenol, monatin, and sugar alcohols such as sorbitol, mannitol,<br>
	maltitol, and L-aminodicarboxylic acid aminoalkenoic acid ester amides, such as those<br>
	disclosed in U.S. Pat. No. 4,619,834, which disclosure is incorporated herein by reference,<br>
	and mixtures thereof;<br>
		(b)	water-soluble artificial sweeteners such as soluble saccharin salts, i.e., sodium or<br>

	dihydro-6-methyl-l,2,3-oxathiazine-4-one-2,2-dioxide, the potassium salt of 3,4-dihydro-6-<br>
	methyl-l,2,3-oxathiazine-4-one-2,2-dioxide (Acesulfame-K), the free acid form of saccharin,<br>
	and mixtures thereof;<br>
		(c)	dipeptide based sweeteners, such as L-aspartic acid derived sweeteners, such as<br>
15	L-aspartyl-L-phenylalanine methyl ester (Aspartame) and materials described in U.S. Pat.<br>
	No. 3,492,131, L-alphaaspartyl-N-(2,2,4,4-tetramethyl-3-thietanyl)-D-alaninamide hydrate<br>

	dihydrophenyl-glycine, L-aspartyl-2,5-dihydro-L-phenylalanine; L-aspartyl-L-(l-<br>
	cyclohexen)-alanine, Neotame and mixtures thereof;<br>
20		(d) water-soluble sweeteners derived from naturally occurring water-soluble<br>
	sweeteners, such as chlorinated derivatives of ordinary sugar (sucrose), e.g.,<br>
	chlorodeoxysugar derivatives such as derivatives of chlorodeoxysucrose or<br>
	chlorodeoxygalactosucrose, known, for example, under the product designation of Sucralose;<br>
	examples of chlorodeoxysucrose and chlorodeoxygalactosucrose derivatives include but are<br>
25	not limited to: l-chloro-l'-deoxysucrose; 4-chloro-4-deoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-alpha-<br>
	D-fructofuranoside, or 4-chloro-4-deoxygalactosucrose; 4-chloro-4-deoxy-alpha-D-<br>

	galactopyranosyl-l,6-dichloro-l,6-dideoxy-beta-D- fructofuranoside, or 4,1,6'-trichloro-<br>
30	4,1 ',6'-trideoxygalactosucrose; 4,6-dichloro-4,6-dideoxy-alpha-D-galactopyranosyl-6-chloro-<br>
	6-deoxy-beta-D- fructofuranoside, or 4,6,6'-trichloro-4,6,6'-trideoxygalactosucrose; 6,1',6'-<br>

5<br><br>
	WO 2006/039519	PCT/US2005/035237<br>
	tetradeoxygalacto-sucrose; and 4,6,1',6'-tetradeoxy-sucrose, and mixtures thereof; and<br>
		(e) protein based sweeteners such as thaumaoccous danielli (Thaumatin I and II).<br>
		The intense sweetening agents may be used in many distinct physical forms well-<br>
5	known in the art to provide an initial burst of sweetness and/or a prolonged sensation of<br>
	sweetness. Without being limited thereto, such physical forms include free forms, such as<br>
	spray dried, powdered, beaded forms, encapsulated forms, and mixtures thereof.<br>
		The thermally stabilized active compositions useful in some embodiments include a<br>
10	combination of a desired active such as sucralose in combination with other components.<br>
	The combination of the active with the other components allow the active to resist<br>
	decomposition when exposed to high temperatures such as 100°C where free sucralose would<br>
	begin to discolor. The thermally stabilized active composition may be prepared by a variety<br>
	of methods which include the preparation of a co-crystallized/ precipitated complex of an<br>
15	active and cyclodextrin, adding a coating to an active by a spray coating method, and<br>
	extruding an active with a low to medium molecular weight polymer at a temperature below<br>
	the decomposition temperature of the active.<br>
	Co-crystallized/ precipitated complex<br>
20		The co-crystallized / precipitated complex of some embodiments may primarily<br>
	include an active, such as sucralose, with cyclodextrin. Within the co-crystallized /<br>
	precipitated complex, the cyclodextrin may be present in an amount greater than zero up to<br>
	about 25% by weight of the complex, more specifically up to about 15% or up to about 5%.<br>
	The cyclodextrin may be any of a-cyclodextrin, P-cyclodextrin, γ-cyclodextrin, and<br>
25	combinations thereof.<br>
		A co-crystallized / precipitated complex of sucralose and cyclodextrin may be<br>
	prepared by first preparing a solution in water or a combination of water with another suitable<br>
	organic solvent. The solution is then heated to a temperature in the range from about 40 °C to<br>
30	about 80 °C for about 10 minutes to about 20 minutes. The heating of the solution has been<br>
	found not to result in an appreciable degradation of a sucralose active, as measured by<br>
	changed in color, i.e., discoloration as measured by spectrophotometry, as described below in<br>
	the examples.<br>
6<br><br>
	WO 2006/039519	PCT/US2005/035237<br>
		After the sucralose/cyclodextrin solution has been maintained under heat for a<br>
	sufficient time to form the co-crystallized / precipitated complex of sucralose and<br>
	cyclodextrin, the co-crystallized / precipitated complex is then obtained upon drying or<br>
	otherwise removing the solvent. If necessary, the particles obtained after drying may be<br>
5	formed, to a desired size. This may be accomplished by any mechanical means such as<br>
	milling, grinding, or other methods of comminuting. In some embodiments the co-<br>
	crystallized / precipitated complex has an average particle size ranging from about 1 µm to<br>
	about 150 µm.<br>
10	Encapsulated Active By Spray Coating<br>
		A thermally stabilized active composition may also be prepared by coating the active<br>
	by a spray coating method. This process provides an active which is at least partially<br>
	encapsulated by a polymer such as polyvinyl acetate.<br>
15		The coating layer which surrounds the active, may also include a solvent which<br>
	should be capable of dissolving the polymer. The solvent may be any solvent known for this<br>
	purpose. For example, if the polymer is polyvinyl acetate, suitable solvents include of ethyl<br>
	acetate, diethyl ether, acetone, benzene, ethylene dichloride, methanol, methyl ethyl ketone,<br>
	ethanol, toluene, xylene, amyl acetate, and combinations thereof.<br>
20	<br>
		One or more coating layers may be present which include the encapsulating polymer<br>
	and optionally may include the same or a different active. In some embodiments wherein<br>
	more than one coating layer is present, the first coating layer may include a high tensile<br>
	strength polymer with the optional addition of another active such as a sweetener. A second<br>
25	coating may completely or partially encapsulate the active particles and may include either a<br>
	single polymer, a combination of different polymers, or a combination of one or more<br>
	polymers and a sweetener such as sucralose.<br>
		Polymers which may be used in the coating layers include acrylic polymers and<br>
30	copolymers, carboxyvinyl polymer, polyamides, polystyrene, polyvinyl acetate, polyvinyl<br>
	acetate phthalate, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and combinations thereof. One or more different<br>
	polymers may be used in each of the coating layers. For example, polyvinyl acetate may be<br>
	included in a first coating with a combination of polyvinyl acetate and another polymer in a<br>
	subsequent exterior coating.<br>
7<br><br>
	WO 2006/039519	PCT/US2005/035237<br>
		The encapsulated particles of some embodiments may be prepared by any suitable<br>
	spray coating method as known in the art. One suitable process is the Wurster process. This<br>
	process provides a method for encapsulating individual particulate materials. First the<br>
	particles to be encapsulated are suspended in a fluidizing air stream which provides a<br>
5	generally cyclic flow in front of a spray nozzle. The spray nozzle sprays an atomized flow of<br>
	the coating solution, which may include sucralose, a polymer and a suitable solvent.<br>
		The atomized coating solution collides with the particles as they are carried away<br>
	from the nozzle to provide a particle coating with the coating solution. The temperature of<br>
10	the fluidizing air stream, which also serves to suspend the particles to be coated, may be<br>
	adjusted to evaporate the solvent shortly after the coating solution contacts the particles. This<br>
	serves to solidify the coating on the particles, resulting in the desired encapsulated particle.<br>
		This process may be repeated until the desired thickness of the coating is achieved.<br>
15	Alternatively, the process may be repeated with a different coating solution to provide<br>
	different and distinct coating layers in the encapsulated particle composition.<br>
		Following the coating process, the particles may then be formaed to an appropriate size<br>
	as desired, generally from an average particle size range of about 50 µm to about 800 µm.<br>
20	This may be accomplished by any suitable means such as chopping, pulverizing, milling or<br>
	grinding the particles.<br>
	Encapsulated Active By Extrusion<br>
		The active may also be extruded with a low to medium molecular weight polymer to<br>
25	achieve a thermally stabilized active composition. The polymer may be any of those<br>
	described herein. The molecular weight of the polymer may be less than about 300,000,<br>
	specifically from about 9,000 to about 200,000 and may be polyvinyl acetate.<br>
		In one method of preparing the extruded thermally stabilized active, the active is first<br>
30	combined with the polymer and melted. The combination of active and polymer may then be<br>
	extruded, cooled and formed to the desired particle size. The particles may be sized by<br>
	milling, grinding, pulverizing, etc. to achieve a particle an average particle size from about<br>
	50 µm to about 800 µm.<br>
8<br><br>
	WO 2006/039519	PCT/US2005/035237<br>
	Combination of thermally stabilized composition and polymer<br>
		The thermally stabilized active composition may then be encapsulated in a high<br>
	molecular weight or high tensile strength polymer. The thermally stabilized active<br>
	composition may be prepared by any of the methods described hereinabove. Combinations<br>
5	of thermally stabilized active compositions, including combinations of different actives and<br>
	combinations of compositions prepared by different may be combined.<br>
		Examples of suitable polymers for the encapsulation of the thermally stabilized active<br>
	compositions include polyethylene, crosslinked polyvinyl pyrrolidone,<br>
10	polymethylmethacrylate, polylacticacid, polyhydroxyalkanoates, ethylcellixlose, polyvinyl<br>
	acetate phthalate, polyethyleneglycol esters, methacrylicacid-co-methylmethacrylate, acrylic<br>
	polymers and copolymers, carboxyvinyl polymer, polyamides, polystyrene, polyvinyl acetate<br>
	and combinations thereof, more specifically the polymer will include polyvinyl acetate either<br>
	alone or in combination with another polymer. For example, the polymer may have a<br>
15	molecular weight higher than about 300,000, specifically about 500,000 or higher.<br>
		The thermally stabilized active composition may be combined with the encapsulating<br>
	polymer by melt extrusion. This is conducting by melting a combination of one or more<br>
	polymers in combination with the active composition in the temperature raxige of about 65 °C<br>
20	to about 140 °C. Another sweetener, such as a high-intensity sweetener as described above<br>
	may be added prior to melting the combination. The extrudate is then cooled and formed into<br>
	particles of a desired size. This may be accomplished through cutting, grinding, pulverizing,<br>
	milling or any other appropriate technique as know in the art. The extrudate particles may<br>
	have an average particle size ranging from about 50 µm to about 800 µm.<br>
25	<br>
		The encapsulated active composition may include any desired combination of<br>
	polymer and the active composition, in addition to an optionally added active, especially a<br>
	sweetener. The active composition may be present in an amount from about 5% to about<br>
5	0% by weight of the encapsulated sweetener composition.<br>
30	<br>
		The encapsulated active compositions as described herein may also be used in a gum<br>
	composition, including but not limited to chewing gums and bubble gums, particularly where<br>
	the active is sucralose or another sweetener. Encapsulation of the sweetener provides<br>
	advantages in the preparation of gum compositions by providing an enhanced or prolonged<br>

	sweetening perception to person who is chewing the gum. This perception results from the<br>
	manner in which the sweetener is released over time as a result of the gum being chewed.<br>
		A sweetener composition may be used in any amount suitable for the desired<br>
5	sweetening effect to be achieved. In general, an effective amount of sweetener may be<br>
	utilized to provide the level of sweetness desired, and this amount may vary especially when<br>
	a sweetener is selected in addition to the encapsulated sweetener or wherein a sweetener is<br>
	added in addition to the encapsulated sweetener. The amount of sweetener may be present in<br>
	amounts from about 0.001% to about 3%, by weight of the gum composition, depending<br>
10	upon the sweetener or combination of sweeteners used. The exact range of amounts for each<br>
	type of sweetener may be selected by those skilled in the art.<br>
		The gum compositions of some embodiments may include a gum base. The gum base<br>
	may include any component known in the chewing gum art. For example, the gum<br>
15	composition may include elastomers, bulking agents, waxes, elastomer solvents, emulsifiers,<br>
	plasticizers, fillers and mixtures thereof.<br>
		The elastomers (rubbers) employed in the gum base will vary greatly depending upon<br>
	various factors such as the type of gum base desired, the consistency of gum composition.<br>
20	desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
	product The elastomer may be any water-insoluble polymer known in the art, and includes<br>
	those gum polymers utilized for chewing gums and bubble gums. Illustrative examples of<br>
	suitable polymers in gum bases include both natural and synthetic elastomers. For example,<br>
	those polymers which are suitable in gum base conxpositions include, without limitation,<br>
25	natural substances (of vegetable origin) such as chicle, natural rubber, crown gum, nispero,<br>

		The amount of elastomer employed in the gum base may vary depending upon<br>
	various factors such as the type of gum base used, the consistency of the gum composition<br>
	desired and the other components used in the composition to make the final chewing gum<br>
	product. In general, the elastomer will be present in the gum base in an amount from about<br>
5	10% to about 60% by weight of the gum region, desirably from about 35% to about 40% by<br>
	weight.<br>
		In some embodiments, the gum base may include wax. It softens the polymeric<br>
	elastomer mixture and improves the elasticity of the gum base. When present, the waxes<br>
10	employed will have a melting point below about 60°C, and preferably between about 45°C.<br>
	and about 55°C. The low melting wax may be a paraffin wax. The wax may be present in the<br>
	gum base in an amount from about 6% to about 10%, and preferably from about 7% to about<br>
	9.5%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
15		In addition to the low melting point waxes, waxes having a higher melting point may<br>
	be used in the gum base in amounts up to about 5%, by weight of the gum base. Such high<br>
	melting waxes include beeswax, vegetable wax, candelilla wax, camuba wax, most petroleum<br>
	waxes, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>

	other ingredients, such as components selected from elastomer solvents, emulsifiers,<br>
	plasticizers, fillers, and mixtures thereof.<br>
		The gum base may contain elastomer solvents to aid in softening the elastomer<br>
25	component. Such elastomer solvents may include those elastomer solvents known in the art,<br>
	for example, terpinene resins such as polymers of alpha-pinene or beta-pinene, methyl,<br>
	glycerol and pentaerythritol esters of rosins and modified rosins and gums such as<br>
	hydrogenated, dimerized and polymerized rosins, and mixtures thereof. Examples of<br>
	elastomer solvents suitable for use herein may include the pentaerythritol ester of partially<br>
30	hydrogenated wood and gum rosin, the pentaerythritol ester of wood and gum rosin, the<br>
	glycerol ester of wood rosin, the glycerol ester of partially dimerized wood and gum rosin,<br>
	the glycerol ester of polymerized wood and gum rosin, the glycerol ester of tall oil rosin, the<br>
	glycerol ester of wood and gum rosin and the partially hydrogenated wood and gum rosin and<br>
	the partially hydrogenated methyl ester of wood and rosin, and the like, and mixtures thereof.<br>

	WO 2006/039519	PCT/US2005/035237<br>
	The elastomer solvent may be employed in the gum base in amounts from about 2% to about<br>
	15%, and preferably from about 7% to about 11%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
		The gum base may also include emulsifiers which aid in dispersing the immiscible<br>
5	components into a single stabilized system. The emulsifiers useful in this invention include<br>
	glyceryl monostearate, lecithin, fatty acid monoglycerides, diglycerides, propylene glycol<br>
	monostearate, and the like, and mixtures thereof. The emulsifier may be employed in<br>
	amounts from about 2% to about 15%, and more specifically, from about 7% to about 11%,<br>
	by weight of the gum base.<br>
10	<br>
		The gum base may also include plasticizers or softeners to provide a variety of<br>
	desirable textures and consistency properties. Because of the low molecular weight of "these<br>
	ingredients, the plasticizers and softeners are able to penetrate the fundamental structure of<br>
	the gum base making it plastic and less viscous. Useful plasticizers and softeners include<br>
15	lanolin, palmitic acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, sodium stearate, potassium stearate, glyc eryl<br>
	triacetate, glyceryl lecithin, glyceryl monostearate, propylene glycol monostearate, acetylated<br>
	monoglyceride, glycerine, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Waxes, for example, natural<br>
	and synthetic waxes, hydrogenated vegetable oils, petroleum waxes such as polyurethane<br>
	waxes, polyethylene waxes, paraffin waxes, microcrystalline waxes, fatty waxes, sorbitan<br>
20	monostearate, tallow, propylene glycol, mixtures thereof, and the like, may also be<br>
	incorporated into the gum base. The plasticizers and softeners are generally employed dn the<br>
	gum base in amounts up to about 20% by weight of the gum base, and more specifically in<br>
	amounts from about 9% to about 17%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
25		Plasticizers also include are the hydrogenated vegetable oils and include soybean oil<br>
	and cottonseed oil which may be employed alone or in combination. These plasticizers<br>
	provide the gum base with good texture and soft chew characteristics. These plasticizexs and<br>
	softeners are generally employed in amounts from about 5% to about 14%, and more<br>
	specifically in amounts from about 5% to about 13.5%, by weight of the gum base.<br>
30	<br>
		Anhydrous glycerin may also be employed as a softening agent, such as the<br>
	commercially available United States Pharmacopeia (USP) grade. Glycerin is a syrupy liquid<br>
	with a sweet warm taste and has a sweetness of about 60% of that of cane sugar. Because<br>
12<br><br>
	WO 2006/039519	PCT/US2005/035237<br>
	glycerin is hygroscopic, the anhydrous glycerin may be maintained under anhydrous<br>
	conditions throughout the preparation of the chewing gum composition.<br>
		In some embodiments, the gum base of this invention may also include effective<br>
5	amounts of bulking agents such as mineral adjuvants which may serve as fillers and textural<br>
	agents. Useful mineral adjuvants include calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, alumina,<br>
	aluminum hydroxide, aluminum silicate, talc, tricalcium phosphate, dicalcium phosphate,<br>
	calcium sulfate and the like, and mixtures thereof. These fillers or adjuvants may be used in<br>
	the gum base compositions in various amounts. The amount of filler, may be present in an<br>
10	amount from about zero to about 40%, and more specifically from about zero to about 30%,<br>
	by weight of the gum base.<br>
		A variety of traditional ingredients may be optionally included in the gum base in<br>
	effective amounts such as coloring agents, antioxidants, preservatives, flavoring agents, and<br>
15	the like. For example, titanium dioxide and other dyes suitable for food, drug and cosmetic<br>
	applications, known as F. D. &amp; C. dyes, may be utilized. An anti-oxidant such as butylated<br>
	hydroxytoluene (BHT), butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), propyl gallate, and mixtures<br>
	thereof, may also be included. Other conventional chewing gum additives known to one<br>
	having ordinary skill in the chewing gum art may also be used in the gum base.<br>
20	<br>
		The gum composition may include amounts of conventional additives selected from<br>
	the group consisting of sweetening agents (sweeteners), plasticizers, softeners, emulsifiers,<br>
	waxes, fillers, bulking agents (carriers, extenders, bulk sweeteners), mineral adjuvants,<br>
	flavoring agents (flavors, flavorings), coloring agents (colorants, colorings), antioxidants,<br>
25	acidulants, thickeners, medicaments, and the like, and mixtures thereof. Some of these<br>
	additives may serve more than one purpose. For example, in sugarless gum compositions, a<br>
	sweetener, such as maltitol or other sugar alcohol, may also function as a bulking agent.<br>
		The plasticizers, softening agents, mineral adjuvants, waxes and antioxidants<br>
30	discussed above, as being suitable for use in the gum base, may also be used in the chewing<br>
	gum composition. Examples of other conventional additives which may be used include<br>
	emulsifiers, such as lecithin and glyceryl monostearate, thickeners, used alone or in<br>
	combination with other softeners, such as methyl cellulose, alginates, carrageenan, xanthan<br>
	gum, gelatin, carob, tragacanth, locust bean gum, pectin, alginates, galactomannans such as<br>

	mixtures thereof. Hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are primarily prepared by the controlled<br>
	catalytic hydrogenation of com syrups. The resulting hydrogenated starch hydrolysates are<br>
30	mixtures of monomeric, dimeric, and polymeric saccharides. The ratios of these different<br>
	saccharides give different hydrogenated starch hydrolysates different properties. Mixtures of<br>
	hydrogenated starch hydrolysates, such as LYCASIN, a commercially available product<br>
	manufactured by Roquette Freres of France, and HYSTAR, a commercially available product<br>

		The features and advantages of the present invention are more fully shown by the<br>
	following examples which axe provided for purposes of illustration, and are not to be<br>
	construed as limiting the invention in any way.<br>
5	EXAMPLES<br>
	Example 1 - Co-crystallized/ Precipitated Complex<br>
		General steps followed for preparing the co-crystallized / precipitated compositions<br>
	included the following procedure. First, a quantity off β cyclodextrin was added to sucralose<br>
	and the resulting mixture was then dissolved in 25 ml. water and heated to 80 °C for one<br>
10	hour. The solution was then cooled to 20 °C and allowed to crystallize overnight under<br>
	refrigeration. The crystalline precipitate was then filtered off by cold-filtration, air-dried, and<br>
	then milled to a uniform particle size.<br>
		In particular, a series of samples of co-crystalline complexes were prepared for<br>
15	testing. Accordingly, 0.25 g, 0.5 g and 1.0 g of cyclodextrin were added to sucralose to<br>
	prepare a total of 5 g of mixture in accordance with the general procedure above. The<br>
	samples thus corresponded to mixtures containing 5%, 10% and 20% cyclodextrin. As a<br>
	comparison, a sample containing pure sucralose was prepared in the same manner, and was<br>
	likewise milled identically to eliminate any particle size differences.<br>
20	<br>
		The co-crystallized / precipitated particles prepared above were combined with<br>
	polyvinyl acetate (PVAc) and were extruded at a temperature of about 195 °F (92 °C) to<br>
	provided an extruded sucralose composition. The changes of color (discoloration) of<br>
	extruded the sucralose compositions were measured by taking diffuse reflectance absorbance<br>
25	readings with a Minolta spectrophotometer of the respective samples. The results are set<br>
	forth in Table 1.<br>
	Referring to Table 1, it is apparent that significant improvement in color is obtained<br>
	with cyclodextrin stabilized sucralose/PVAc extrudate as compared to free sucralose/PVAc<br>
30	extrudate.<br>
	Measurement of discoloration/degradation of extruded sucralose<br>
		The change of color of extruded sucralose compositions were measured by taking<br>
	Diffuse Reflectance Absorbance readings with a Minolta spectrophotometer model no. CR-<br>
20<br><br>
	WO 2006/039519	PCT/US2005/035237<br>
	321. Absorbance measurement over the entire visible color spectrum were obtained using the<br>
	International Commission on Illumination (CIE) CDs L*a*b* AE color difference formula<br>
	(CIELab color scale). This scale quantifies color according to a 3 parameters, L* (lightness-<br>
	darkness scale), a* (red-green chroma), and b* (yellow-blue chroma). The overall change in<br>
5	the color of the encapsulated sucralose composition was calculated using the CIELAB<br>
	equation ΔE = [(ΔL*)2 + (Δa*)2 + (Δb*)2]1/2. The ΔE value summarizes the overall change<br>
	for each color factor (ΔL* = (Lf*-Li*), Δa* = )af*-ai*), and Ab* = (bf*-bi*)) and represents<br>
	the ability of the cyclodextrin to prevent browning which is related to decomposition of<br>
	sucralose. In order to obtain reproducible readings, measurements were conducted by<br>
10	aligning the center of the 4 mm square segment of encapsulated sucralose composition<br>
	directly over the 3 mm diameter targeting aperture of the Minolta spectrophotometer. An<br>
	average of 3 absorbance readings using the L*, a*, and b* scale were taken for each sucralose<br>
	composition. There was a significant difference between cyclodextrin-sucralose versus free<br>
	sucralose extrudates, 83.74 being whiter than 76.43. For Delta b*, which is a measure of<br>
15	brown color, there was also significant difference between cyclodextrin-sucralose and free<br>
	sucralose 6.89 being more brown as compared to 2.26 <br><br>

	Example 2 - Extrusion of Active with Polymer<br>
		Another method of preparing a thermally stabilized active composition, is to first<br>
	combine the active, such as sucralose with a low to medium molecular weight polymer prior<br>
	to extrusion with a high molecular weight polymer.<br>
25	<br>
		The compositions for comparative Example 3A and inventive example 3B are set<br>
	forth in Table 2.<br>

		For comparative Example 3A, all the ingredients were mixed and extruded from a<br>
5	laboratory twin screw extruder at a temperature of about 110°C. The mixing and extrusion<br>
	steps were conducted in a single step. The process resulted in a dark-brown product which is<br>
	evidence of decomposition of the sucralose.<br>
		For inventive Example 3B, the components shown in step 1 were mixed and extruded<br>
10	from a laboratory twin screw extruder at temperature of about 80°C. The resulting<br>
	sucralose/polymer matrix was then cooled, ground and sized (590 microns screen). HPLC<br>
	analysis on the encapsulated sucralose showed now decomposition.<br>
		The composition resulting from Example 3B, step 1, were added to the components<br>
15	for step 2, mixed, and extruded from a laboratory twin screw extruder at t temperature of<br>
	about 110°C. The resulting white color sucralose/polymer matrix was cooled, ground and<br>
	sized (590 microns screen). HPLC analysis on the high strength encapsulation showed no<br>
	decomposition.<br>
