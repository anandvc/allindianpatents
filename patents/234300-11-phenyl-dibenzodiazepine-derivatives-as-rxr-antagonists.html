Another embodiment of the present invention relates to a combination, especially a pharmaceutical composition, comprising as active ingredients an RXR-antagonist, or a pharmaceutical^ acceptable salt thereof, especially a compound of formula (I) as described hereinbefore, and at least one other pharmaceutical^ effective drug selected from the group consisting of: diuretics, alpha-receptor blockers, beta-receptor antagonists, vasodilating agents, calcium antagonists, renin inhibitors, angiotensin II antagonists, angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACE-inhibitors), insulin secretion enhancers and insulin sensitizers.<br>
Preferred combinations relate to a combination of<br>
(i) a RXR-antagonist, or a pharmaceutically acceptable*salt thereof, especially a compound<br>
of formula (I) as described hereinbefore; and<br>
(ii) at least one other active ingredient, selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(a)	Aiyreceptor antagonist, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof;<br>
(b)	an insulin secretion enhancer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof; and<br>
(c)	an insulin sensitizer, or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof.<br>
In case of a pharmaceutical composition, a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier is typically contained as well-Preferably, the jointly therapeutically effective amounts of the active agents according to the combination of the present invention can be administered simultaneously or sequentially in any order, e.g., separately or in a fixed combination.<br>
Under certain circumstances, drugs with different mechanisms of action may be combined. However, just considering any combination of drugs having different modes of action but acting in the similar field does not necessarily lead to combinations with advantageous effects.<br>
A typical experimental finding of the present invention is that the combined administration of a RXR-antagonist and an ATi receptor antagonist and/or an insulin secretion enhancer and/or an insulin sensitizer, or, in each case, a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, results not only in a beneficial, especially a potentiating or a synergistic, therapeutic efficacy.<br><br>
Independent thereof, additional benefits resulting from combined treatment can be achieved such as a surprising prolongation of efficacy, a broader variety of therapeutic treatment and surprising beneficial effects on diseases and conditions associated with diabetes and obesity, e.g.. less gain of weight. An additional and preferred aspect of the present invention is the prevention, delay of progression or treatment of the condition of isolated systolic hypertension and impaired vascular compliance which means decreased vascular elasticity.<br>
The term "potentiation" shall mean an increase of a corresponding pharmacological efficacy or therapeutical effect, respectively. Potentiation of one component of the combination according to the present invention by co-administration of an other component according to the present invention means that an effect is being achieved that is greater than that -achieved with one component alone.<br>
The term "synergistic" shall mean that the drugs, when taken together, produce a total joint effect which is greater than the sum of the effects of each drug when taken alone.<br>
As used herein, ATrreceptor antagonists (also called angiotensin II receptor antagonists or blockers) bind to the ATrreceptor subtype of angiotensin II receptor but do not result in activation of the receptor. As a consequence of the blockade of the AT-j receptor, these antagonists can, for example, be employed as antihypertensives or for treating congestive heart failure.<br>
The class of ATi receptor antagonists comprises compounds having differing structural features, essentially preferred are the non-peptidic ones. Typically such compounds are selected from the group consisting of valsartan (cf. EP 443'983), losartan (cf. EP 253*310), candesartan (cf. EP 459'136), eprosartan (cf. EP 403'159)t irbesartan (cf.

Experimental Part - Biology<br>
1)	In vitro model: Reporter gene assay<br>
To determine the effects of an RXR-antagonist at the cellular level, a reporter gene assay is used to assess gene expression and regulation by an antagonist. A reporter gene assay for RXRa homodimer is performed using 9-cis-retinoic acid and LG100268, RXR selective ligand. HEK 293 cells are transfected with the hRXRa expression vector, pcDNA-hRXRa and reporter plasmid, pGL3proCRBPII. For assays, the cells are seeded in 96 well tissue culture plates. The next day, 9-cis-retinoic acid or LG100268 as the activating ligand are added to the medium in the presence or absence of RXR antagonists. After 20-24 h incubation, the cells are iysed and the luciferase activity is measured.<br>
2)	In vivo model: l*KAy mice<br>
KKAy mice [Iwatsuka et al., Endocrinol. Jpn., 17: 23-35 (1970)] are characterized by severe obesity and features of type 2 diabetes [Herberg et al., Metabolism, 26: 59-99,1970, Hayase et al., Am. J. Physiol., 271: E333-9,1996]. This animal model is useful to study the pathogenesis, therapy, and prevention of obesity and diabetes.<br>
The efficacy of RXR-antagonists is determined in obese diabetic KKAy mice using similar method described by Yamauchi et al. [J. Clin. Invest, 108:1001-13, 2001]. Male 8-9 week old KKAy mice pre-fed a high fat diet for 1-2 weeks are divided into the groups. RXR antagonists are administered as a food admixture for 1-2 weeks. Body weight and food intake are monitored during the administration. After the administration, blood samples are taken and the heparinized plasma samples are stored at -80°C after the centrifugation (4 °C, 1,500 times g, 10 min) for the measurement of plasma parameters. The parameters are measured using commercially available kits.<br><br>
Highly preferred compounds so far based on the data observed in the in vivo KKAy screening are the compounds of formula (Ilia), (lllb), (lllc), (Hid), (Hie) and (Illf).<br>
3) In vitro model: RXRa binding assay<br>
Varying concentrations of 3H 9-cis-RA (retinoic acid) are incubated with or without 50 ng of full length glutathione-S-transferase (GST)-human RXRa for 18 h at 4°C in 200 micro liter binding buffer under continuous rotation. After addition of 80 micro liter of 20% hydroxyapatite (HA) slurry, reaction tubes are further incubated for 15 min at 4°C, and then, centrifuged for 2 min at IS'OGO g-force. Collected MA is washed with 250 micro liter of buffer 3 times, re-suspended 250 micro liter ethanol, and then transferred to a vial containing 5 mL of scintillate to measure radioactivity. Competitive binding assay: The competitive binding assay is carried out by using 20 tm of 3H 9-cis-RA in the absence (100% binding) or presence of increasing concentrations (10"1° -10"4 M) of, e.g., HX531.<br>
Experimental Part - Pharmacology<br>
As used herein, pharmaceutical preparations are for enteral, such as oral, and also rectal or parenteral, administration to homeotherms, with the preparations comprising the pharmacological active compound either alone or together with customary pharmaceutical auxiliary substances. For example, the pharmaceutical preparations consist of from about 0.1 % to 90 %, preferably of from about 1 % to about 80 %, of the active compound. Pharmaceutical preparations for enteral or parenteral, and also for topical, e.g., ocular, administration are, for example, in unit dose forms, such as coated tablets, tablets, capsules or suppositories and also ampoules. These are prepared in a manner that is known per se, for example using conventional mixing, granulation, coating, solubilizing or lyophilizing processes. Thus, pharmaceutical preparations for oral use can be obtained by combining the active compound with solid excipients, if desired granulating a mixture which has been obtained, and, if required or necessary, processing the mixture or granulate into tablets or""" coated tablet cores after having added suitable auxiliary substances.<br>
The aforementioned pharmaceutical compositions may be prepared by the addition of pharmacologically and pharmaceutical^ acceptable additives. Examples of<br><br>
