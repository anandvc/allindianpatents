				<td>TITLE<br>
"DOMESTIC SEWING MACHINE"<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a domestic sewing machine, in particular a domestic sewing machine adapted for use by those persons who are right-handed.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Domestic sewing machines are a commodity in which the basic technology pertaining to the loop stitching system, a system essential to the function of sewing machines as they are presently known, has remained essentially unchanged since the creation of the first modem sewing machine. The earliest known models of sewing machine were operated manually by rotation of a hand crank. Due to the manual nature of this operation, early sewing machines were provided with the hand crank on the right side of the machine, to capitalise on the fact that the majority of persons have greater strength in their right hand and arm, by virtue of being right-handed. Despite the fact that sewing machines have progressed from these early versions to utilise other means of operating the sewing machine, such as foot-operated treadles, the configuration of the sewing machine as designed to accommodate the aforementioned hand-crank has remained virtually unchanged.<br>
The accommodation of efficient operation of the manual hand-crank in sewing machines has resulted in modern sewing machines being manufactured in a configuration Avhereby the working surface of the sewing machine is situated on the left-hand side of the sewing machine. The working surface of the sewing machine is<br>
the region of the sewing machine upon which the actual sewing action of the machine takes place. Thus, the majority of operative features of the sewing machine requiring precise and dexterous actions by the operator are situated on or adjacent the working surface.<br>
Essential operative features of the sewing machine, such as the needle, bobbin and presser foot are all situated upon the left-hand side of the sewing machine and all require dexterity and hand to eye coordination for proper manipulation of each of these features. For example, threading the needle of the sewing machine as well as through a thread guide and thread take-up lever is a task that requires precise movement of the hand. To thread the sewing machine, an operator of the sewing machine will typically use their right hand, as this is the hand with which they are able to attend to the task with the most precision. However, upon using the right-hand to perform such tasks, the operator is essentially adapting their actions to compensate for the fact that the operative features of the sewing machine are situated on the left-hand side.<br>
Other operative functions of the machine, such as light source and cutting means are also typically situated on the left-hand side of the machine and are thus essentially accommodated for use by left-handed individuals. Similarly, operative features of the sewing machine used to conduct tasks such as folding, pinning or guiding of material upon the working surface of the sewing machine are typically situated on the left-hand side of the sewing machine and are thus better suited for use by left-handed individuals. The right-handed operator generally must adapt the movement of actions requiring dexterity to suit the fact that they are essentially utilising a left-handed sewing machine.<br>
Similarly, a majority of tasks pertaining to the maintenance of the sewing machine are also situated on the left-hand side of the sewing machine. Maintenance tasks such as the undoing of screws to remove the needle plate, the cleaning of feed dogs, opening of the shuttle cover, removal of the hook and hook cover and cleaning and oiling of the shuttle drive areas are tasks performed by the operator on a routine basis. Each of these maintenance tasks requires a decided degree of dexterity in order for each of these tasks to be effectively carried out. Typically, operators of sewing machines will adapt to this particular configuration by using their right-hand to perform such tasks, even though their right hand is not situated directly opposite the working surface of the sewing machine. Alternatively, an operator may physically move the sewing machine, such as rotating the sewing machine, so that they may better access some of the abovementioned features.<br>
Sewing machines designed for domestic use are essentially all-purpose devices, permitting the operator to undertake and complete a variety of different tasks, such as those tasks described above. An operator of a domestic sewing machine will thus have the capacity to fulfil the range of different tasks necessary to take to completion or near completion a particular project, for example, the manufacture of a garment. In this context, domestic sewing machines and the use thereof are not to be confused with those machines used in industrial sewing applications.<br>
In contrast, machines used in industrial sewing applications are generally designed to fulfil a specific single task in any project. For example, an industrial machine may be dedicated to the sole purpose of hemming or of cutting. Such specificity in design of machines used in industrial sewing applications consequently affects the method of operation thereof. Operation of machines used in industrial sewing applications often<br>
does not require the continual attendance of an operator. Rather, upon function of the industrial machine being initiated, the machine generally requires no or minimal operator activity for completion of the process for which the machine is designed to fulfil. Further, only qualified service personnel ordinarily perform general maintenance of machines used in industrial sewing applications, rather than the maintenance being conducted by those directly involved in operation of the machine. As such, the invention described herein is to be taken as referring only to a domestic sewing machine, and excludes any reference or claims to machines employed in industrial sewing applications.<br>
The present invention attempts to overcome at least in part the aforementioned disadvantages of previous domestic sewing machines.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In accordance with one aspect of the present invention there is provided a domestic sewing machine for use by a right-handed operator having:<br>
-	a front face;<br>
-	an operating surface;<br>
-	a body portion extending upwardly from the operating surface;<br>
-	an arm portion extending transversely from the body portion and substantially<br>
over the operating surface; and<br>
-	a needle assembly disposed on an end of the arm portion distal to the body<br>
portion,<br>
wherein the sewing machine is arranged, in use, to be operated by an operator facing the front face of the sewing machine, the arrangement being such that the needle<br>
assembly is located proximal a right hand of the operator and the body portion is located proximal a left hand of the operator.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
The present invention will now be described, by way of example, with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a front perspective view of a sewing machine for use in domestic sewing applications hi accordance with the present invention.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF AN EMBODIMENT OF THE INVENTION<br>
Referring to the Figure, there is shown a domestic sewing machine 10 for use in domestic sewing applications, with a front face 11. The sewing machine' 10 comprises a base portion 12 and a body portion 14 disposed atop the base portion 12. The base portion 12 includes an operating surface 16, upon which an operator manipulates material.<br>
The operating surface 16 includes known features of the domestic sewing machine 10, such as a feed dog 20 and shuttle cover 22. Other known features, such as a bobbin assembly (not shown) are disposed below the operating surface 16 and within the base portion 12.<br>
The body portion 14 accommodates a motor (not shown) of the sewing machine 10. Typically, an operator of the sewing machine 10 faces the front face 11 of the machine 10 hi order to operate the sewing machine 10. From the perspective of an operator, the body portion 14 is disposed on the side of the sewing machine 10 that is proximal a left hand side of the operator. An arm portion 18 extends transversely<br>
from the body portion 14 and substantially over the operating surface 16 such that the arm portion 18 is substantially parallel with the base portion 12 and operating surface 16.<br>
An end of the ami portion 18 distal to the body portion 14 accommodates a needle assembly 24. The needle assembly 24 includes a needle 25, a presser foot 26 for control of material being worked on upon the operating surface 16, and a presser foot screw 28 which secures the presser foot 26 to the needle assembly 24. The needle assembly 24 is disposed on the side of the sewing machine 10 that is proximal a right hand side of the operator. In this manner, tasks that are typically performed on or near the operating surface 16, such as guidance of material upon the operating surface 16, threading of the needle 25 or changing of the presser foot 26 by rotation and removal of the presser foot screw 28 may be conveniently performed by the -right hand of the operator.<br>
In use, the operator of the sewing machine 10 faces the front face 11 of the sewing machine 10, such that the operating surface 16 and needle assembly 24 are proximal the right hand side of the operator. The operator may then operate the sewing machine 10 in a conventional manner. However, the configuration of the sewing machine 10 of the present invention allows for actions requiring dexterity that are typically performed by the left hand of the operator to be conveniently performed by the right hand of the operator. For example, as the needle assembly 24 is situated on the right hand side of the sewing machine 10, the operator may use their right hand, which is proximal to the needle assembly 24, to thread the needle 25 of the sewing machine 10. Similarly, tasks pertaining to manipulation of material upon or near the operative<br>
surface 16 and requiring a degree of hand to eye coordination, such as folding, pinning, cutting and guiding of material upon the operative surface 16 may now also be conveniently performed by the right hand of the operator. The configuration of the sewing machine 10 as hereinbefore described provides for access of the functional features of the sewing machine 10 necessary for completion of the tasks of folding., pinning, cutting and guiding of material upon the operative surface 16 by the right hand of the operator. In this way, it is no longer necessary for the operator, as is required when using prior art sewing machines, to adapt the operation of the sewing machine 10 to accommodate for location of their most dexterous hand, the right hand, distal to the needle assembly 24 of the sewing machine 10.<br>
Modifications and variations as would be apparent to a skilled addressee are deemed to be within the scope of the present invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:<br>
1.	A domestic sewing machine (10) having:<br>
a front face 11:<br>
an operating surface 16:<br>
a body portion 14 extending upwardly from the operating surface 16:<br>
