				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of drying out transformers and reactors at site.<br>
In the construction of transformer, the insulation system plays an important role and therefore needs maximum attention at all stages of handling the transformer.<br>
During the manufacturing stage or during refurbishing, overhauling or repair of the transformer, the core and windings get exposed to the elements resulting in deposit or absorption of dust, dirt and moisture. In order to obtain optimum insulating properly, it is necessary to purge out all these deposits or absorbed materials. This requires careful drying out of the transformer.<br>
While undertaking repair work on transformer at site, all the necessary measures are to be taken for effective dry out of the transformer. The method of moisture evacuation from the transformer which was exposed to the atmospheric condition during its exposure for repair, is of utmost importance for ensuring satisfactory performance of the transformer after repair.<br>
Drying out of the transformer is required if the tank is removed for more than 48 hours. It is also required if the transformer is shut down for a long period, like several  months.<br>
In case of prolonged storage in nitrogen gas and after  formation of  condensation  during  operation  also,  drying  out  of   the transformer may be required. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The  method  generally employed at site for  drying  out  of transformer  is by using an oven for drying the core and  winding coils. Sometimes these can be dried by short circuiting. However, both these methods require a considerable amount of care and in some cases the transformer winding may catch fire.<br>
In  short circuit method current is circulated for  heating the  coil.  As  the coil insulation is oily, it  can  catch  fire easily so careful operation is needed. In some of the sites fire has  taken  place and damaged the complete core and  coil  during this process.<br>
A third method for drying out a transformer is by using a filter machine. However, this method of drying out transformer is not very effective. As the oil is heated in filter machine and circulated in transformer, it gets oxidized and therefore charcteristic of oil gets deteriorated, specially resistivity reduces and tan delta increases and therefore insulation resistance and tan delta value of transformer become poor.<br>
A fourth method used for drying out a transformer is by sprinkling hot oil from top in a closed chamber. Such a method however, requires a lot of care.<br>
In sprinkling method the oil is used by spray method for drying out. The oil carries dirt, sludge, carbon etc and oxidized due to contact in air and thereby characteristics of oil deteriorated in this process. This oil therefore is considered is waste and not used for the transformer. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of the present invention therefore, is to provide a novel method of drying out transformers and reactors which can be safely adopted at site and to achieve parameters comparable with those achievable at works without the problems and disadvantages of known methods.<br>
These objects are achievable by the drying out process of the present invention by vacuum, nitrogen gas filling and heating.<br>
Thus    the    present    invention    provides    a    method    for    drying    out transformers and reactors at site, comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	applying full vacuum of 760mm mercury or less than  1 torr to the transformer tank for sufficient time;<br>
(b)	monitoring condensate collection while vacuum pulling;<br>
(cj pushing dry nitrogen inside the transformer tank wherein the dew<br>
point of said nitrogen is between - 50°C and - 70°C and the pressure<br>
of nitrogen inside the tank is 0.15kg/ cm2; (d) heating  the   transformer  tank  using  heaters  provided   around   the<br>
transformer tank wherein the temperature of core and windings of the<br>
transformer is maintained between  65°C and 70°;<br>
 (e) repeating the steps (a) to (d) until the desired parameters of condensate collection of ≤50 grams per hour and dew point of - 30°C of the condensate are achieved when the tank/winding insulation temperature is 30°C and the nitrogen gas pressure in the transformer tank is 0.15kg/ cm2;<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br>
Fig . 1 shows the arrangement for carrying out the method of the present<br>
invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
Transformers, after completion of repair work at site inside an enclosed shed are suitable blanked with gaskets and blanking plates. A temporary steel structure alongwith the four sides of transformer tank 3 is erected for mounting heaters 4 inside a heating chamber 2. The heater 4 can be mounted surrounding the transformer tank 3 at 1 to 1.5 feet away from transformer tank 3 and at suitable height depending upon the size of transformer.<br>
Finned industrial air heaters can be used in adequate numbers depending upon the size of the transformers. The heaters 4 are clamped this structure. An asbestos cloth/tarpaulin/thermocol cover is provided for complete coverage of the transformer and heaters to prevent heat less to the atm osphere.<br>
After carrying out the preparations as described above, full vacuum is applied to the transformer tank 3 with the help of<br>
a  vacuum pump 5 for sufficient time. The vacuum applied  can  be<br>
760mm of mercury or less than 1 torr and it can be applied for 48<br>
hours.  The condensate collection through cold trap 6  should  be<br>
monitored while vacuum pulling.<br>
The  heating chamber 2 is provided with an arrangement ( not<br>
shown)   through  which  nitrogen  gas  is  pushed   inside   the<br>
transformer  tank for achieving positive pressure. The dew  point<br>
o	o<br>
of nitrogen pushed is between -50 C and -70 C and the posi-<br>
2 tive pressure achieved is 0.15 Kg/cm .<br>
The  transfoermer tank 3 is then heated for minimum 48  hours<br>
through  heaters to raise the inside temperature of  transformer.<br>
Temperature is to be measured by thermocouples 8.The  temperature<br>
o of core/winding inside the transformer is maintained at 65 C<br>
o to 70   C during the heating cycle.<br>
The temperature measured can be shown on a temperature  indicator<br>
7.<br>
The heaters 4 are to be switched off, full vaccum is to be pulled  again  and  condensate collection to  be  monitored  till desired parameters are achieved.<br>
The cycle of pushing dry nitrogen gas under vacuum,heating, vacuming and collecting condensate is to be repeated until rate of  condensate  collection  according  to  requirement  has  been<br>
achieved. The transformer is to be filled again with dry nitrogen gas , dew point of dry nitrogen gas inside the transformer tank is to be measured and temperature and gas pressure are to be recorded.<br>
Adequate heating of transformer tank, vacuum pulling and condensate monitoring cycle to be continued till the required parameters are achieved.<br>
The dry out cycle to be terminated after achieving the desired parameters.<br>
The desired parameters for termination of dry out cycle are:<br>
Condensate    : ,≤ 50 gram per hour.<br>
o Dew point     :   -30 C at tank/winding insulation<br>
o temperature of 30 C and nitrogen<br>
2 gas pressure of 0.15 Kg/cm .<br>
A  study  has  been  carried  out  on  dry  out  of  several transformers at site by employing this method. The above dry out technique  has  resulted  in  satisfactory  performance  of   the transformer after re-commissioning.<br>
Transformer details and dry-out time<br>
SL.NO        TRANSFORMER DETAILS	DRY-OUT<br>
TIME (DAYS)<br>
1	250 MVA-3 phase 420 kVGT	25<br>
2	200 MVA-1 phase 420	20<br>
3	315 MVA- 3 phase 420 kV BT	30<br>
Dry  out  of transformers, which had  long  exposure  during repair/inspection at site, was carried out at various sites, by vacuum pulling, nitrogen gas filling and heating. This method has resulted in not only better IR values of transformer winding but also  reduced  evolution  of  normal  gases  in  oil  during  its operation.<br>
This novel technique is effective and safe for dry out of transformer, which improves the properties of insulating material and extends the life of the transformer.<br>
While the invention has been described with reference to a specific method and device, it should be appreciated that modifications and improvements in both method and device may occur to those skilled in the art, without deviating from the scope and spirit of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
