				<td>7-Imino derivatives of camptothecin having antitumor activity<br>
The present invention relates to compounds having antitumor activity,<br>
in particular to new derivatives of camptothecins, processes for their<br>
preparation, their use as antitumor drugs and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions containing them as active ingredients.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Camptothecin is an alkaloid, which was isolated by Wall et al. (J. Am.<br>
Chem. Soc. 88, 3888-3890 (1966)) for the first time from the tree<br>
Camptoteca acuminata, a plant originating from China, of the<br>
Nyssaceae family.<br>
The molecule consists of a pentacyclic structure having a lactone in the<br>
ring E, which is essential for cytotoxicity.<br>
The drug demonstrated a wide spectrum of antitumor activity, in<br>
particular against colon tumors, other solid tumors and leukemias, and<br>
the first clinical trials were performed in the early 70's. Since<br>
Camptothecin (in the following briefly CPT) has low water solubility<br>
and in order to prepare clinical trials, the National Cancer Institute<br>
(NCI) prepared the sodium salt (NSC 100880), which is water-soluble.<br>
Clinical trials in phase I and II, were not completed because of the<br>
high toxicity showed by the compound (hemorrhagic cystitis,<br>
gastrointestinal toxicity, such as nausea, vomit, diarrhoea, and<br>
myelosuppression, especially leucopenia and thrombocytopenia.<br>
In any case, sodium salt showed a lower activity than CPT, because, at<br>
pH 7.4, the inactive form (open ring) predominates on the lactone-<br>
active one (closed ring), which predominates at pH
Subsequently, many CPT analogues were synthesised in order to<br>
obtain compounds with lower toxicity and higher water solubility. Two<br>
drugs are marketed. Irinotecan (CPT-11), marketed with the Trade<br>
Mark Camptosar® by Upjohn and Topotecan, marketed with the Trade<br>
Mark Hymcamptamin® or Thycantin®, by Smith Kline &amp; Beecham.<br>
Other derivatives are in different steps of clinical development in<br>
phase II, such as NSC-603071 (9-amino-camptothecin), 9-NC or 9-<br>
nitrocamptothecin, an oral prodrug converted in 9-aminocamptothecin,<br>
GG-211 (GI 147211), and DX-8591f, the latter being water-soluble. All<br>
the derivatives identified to-date contain the parent structure with 5<br>
rings, essential for cytotoxicity. It was demonstrated that<br>
modifications on the first ring, such as in the cas§^£jL;the. -above-<br>
mentioned drugs_ increase water solubility and allow a higher<br>
tolerability of the drug.<br>
Water-soluble Irinotecan was approved for the treatment of many solid<br>
tumors and ascites (colon-rectum, skin, stomach, breast, small and<br>
non-small cell lung, cervix and ovarian cancer and in non-Hodgkin<br>
lymphoma). Moreover, Irinotecan resulted active in solid tumors<br>
resistant to Topotecan, vincristine or melphalan and MDR-1 cells<br>
resulted marginally resistant to the drug. The active metabolite was<br>
identified as the 10-hydroxyderivative (SN-38), produced by the action<br>
of carboxylesterases. CPT-11 showed a good activity using different<br>
administration routes, such as intraperitoneal, intravenous, oral<br>
(Costin, D., Potmhexyl, M. Advances in Pharmacol., 29B, 51-72 1994).<br>
CPT-11 was administered also with cisplatin or etoposide, showing a<br>
synergistic effect, thanks to the ability to hinder DNA repair. Also in<br>
this case, however, a grade 3 and 4 leucopenia and diarrhoea arose<br>
(Sinha, B.K., (1995), Topoisomerase inhibitors. Drugs, 49, 11-19, 1995).<br>
Topotecan has a significant oral bioavailability. Oral administration<br>
proved to be convenient to reach a prolonged exposition to the drug,<br>
without the use of temporary catheters being necessary (Rothenberg,<br>
M.L., Annals of Oncology, 8, 837-855, 1997). Also this water-soluble<br>
CPT analogue showed activity against different types of tumors, with<br>
different administration routes, intraperitoneal, intravenous,<br>
subcutaneous, oral The more promising results were obtained with<br>
Topotecan hydrochloride, intravenous infusion for 5 days, in different<br>
tumors such as small and non-small cell lung, ovarian, breast,<br>
stomach, liver, prostate, soft tissue sarcoma, head and neck,<br>
oesophagus, resistant colon-rectum, multiform glioblastoma, chronic<br>
and acute myelocytic leukemias. However, also in this case, severe side<br>
effects occurred, such as neutropenia and thrombocytopenia, whereas<br>
gastrointestinal toxicity, such as nausea, vomit and diarrhoea were<br>
milder.<br>
It was demonstrated that the main transformation and elimination<br>
pathways of the drug comprise lactone hydrolysis and urinary<br>
excretion: in fact, lactone form is 50% hydrolysed to open ring, 30<br>
minutes after infusion. Topotecan crosses hematoencephalic barrier 10<br>
minutes after infusion (30% in the cerebrospinal fluid with respect to<br>
plasma). On the contrary, camptothecin does not cross<br>
hematoencephalic barrier in significant amount, probably due to its<br>
binding with proteins.<br>
Clinical development of 9-aminocamptothecin was hampered by its<br>
scarce water solubility. Recently, a colloidal dispersion was prepared,<br>
which made possible its entry in phase II clinical trial. Prolonged<br>
exposition (from 72 hours to 21 days) appeared to be essential to<br>
demonstrate antitumor activity, because of its short half-life (Dahut, et<br>
al., 1994). Responses in patients suffering from not treated colon-<br>
rectum, and breast cancer and resistant lymphoma, were noticed. The<br>
activity demonstrated against Pgp-positive tumors suggested a lack of<br>
cross-resistance against resistant MDR-1 cells. Once again, bone<br>
marrow and gastrointestinal toxicity was observed.<br>
Lurtotecan is the most water-soluble analogue, with an activity<br>
comparable to Topotecan in vitro. Two regimens were adopted: one 30-<br>
minutes infusion a day for 5 days every 3 weeks and one 72-hours<br>
infusion one time every 3 weeks. Responses in patients suffering from,<br>
neck, ovarian, breast, liver tumour were observed. Also in this case,<br>
haematic toxicity was detected.<br>
9-Nitrocamptothecin is an oral prodrug rapidly converted into 9-<br>
aminocamptothecin after administration. Responses were observed in<br>
patients suffering from pancreas, ovarian, and breast cancer.<br>
Notwithstanding the major part of tumour cells is highly sensitive to<br>
topoisomerase I inhibitors, due to the high enzyme levels, some<br>
tumoral lines result to be resistant. This is due to other mechanisms,<br>
rather than the overexpression of MDR1 and MRP (multidrug<br>
resistance associated protein) genes and of their products, P (Pgp)<br>
glycoprotein and MRP protein, respectively, for which Topotecan or<br>
CPT-11 are not very good substrates, (Kawato, Y., et ah, J. Pharm.<br>
Pharmacol, 45, 444-448, (1993)).<br>
In fact, it was observed that some resistant tumour cells contain<br>
mutant forms of topo I, accordingly the formation of the topo I-DNA<br>
complex is damaged or some cells lack in the carboxylesterase activity,<br>
necessary for converting CPT-11 in the active metabolite SN-38 and<br>
are thus resistant against this drug (Rothenberg, 1997, ibid.).<br>
Within the drugs used in tumour therapy, the interest in inhibitors of<br>
topoisomerase I enzymes is attributed to the following considerations:<br>
a) efficacy against tumors naturally resistant to conventional drugs,<br>
topoisomerase II inhibitors included; b) the levels of the topo I enzyme<br>
remain elevated in all phases of the cycle; c) many tumors express high<br>
levels of the target enzyme; d) lack of recognition by the proteins<br>
involved in the phenomenon of multi-drug resistance (Pgp or MRP)<br>
and absence of the detoxifying enzyme-mediated metabolism,<br>
associated to the glutathione-dependent system (glutathione<br>
peroxidase and glutathione S-transferase) (Gerrits, CJH., et al., Brit.<br>
J. Cancer, 76, 952-962).<br>
Once potential clinical advantages of topoisomerase I inhibitors are<br>
taken into consideration, both in terms of antitumor activity, assayed<br>
on a wide range of tumors, and the poor induction of pharmaco-<br>
resistance, the present research aims to identify topo I inhibitors with<br>
a lower toxicity with respect to the one demonstrated by the drugs on<br>
the market or in clinical phase. The factors determining the relative<br>
potency of camptothecin analogues include a) intrinsic activity of<br>
topoisomerase I inhibition; b) drug mean life; c) interaction with<br>
plasma proteins; d) the ratio between the circulating active form<br>
(lactone) and the non active one (carbozylate); e) drug sensitivity<br>
relative to cell outflow mediated by glycoprotein P or MRP; f) bond<br>
stability with topoisomerase I (Rothenberg, 1997, ibid.).<br>
Among the main adverse effects of Irinotecan and other camptothecins<br>
derivatives, myelosuppression and gastrointestinal toxicity, such as<br>
diarrhoea and vomit, have been observed. Diarrhoea can have an early<br>
or late onset and can be a dose-limiting factor. Vomit and late<br>
diarrhoea are induced by many antitumor drugs, while early diarrhoea<br>
occurring during or immediately after infusion is almost specific for<br>
Irinotecan and some camptothecin derivatives.<br>
Toxic effects occur mainly in the intestinal tract.<br>
In order to reduce diarrhoea, CPT-11 was administered in some<br>
clinical trials, in combination with loperamide, a synthetic oppioid,<br>
agonist of the mu-oppioid enteric receptors (Abigerges, 1994; Abigerges,<br>
1995), as well as with an inhibitor of the enkephalinases (acetorfan) or<br>
with ondansetron, an antagonist of the 5-HT3 receptors, or with<br>
diphenidramine, an antagonist of H1 receptors.<br>
To date, the problems connected with the use of camptothecin<br>
derivatives as antitumor drugs can be summarised in the following<br>
items:<br>
- camptothecin (CPT), and many of its active derivatives have low<br>
water solubility;<br>
- the subsequent derivatives are endowed with severe side effects at<br>
gastrointestinal and bone marrow level;<br>
- some tumour lines developed resistance against topoisomerase I<br>
inhibitors;<br>
there is the constant search for a better therapeutic index.<br>
Patent application WO 97/31003 discloses derivatives of camptothecins<br>
substituted at positions 7, 9 and 10. Position 7 provides the following<br>
substitutions: -CN, -CH(CN)-R4, -CH=C(CN)-R4, -CH2-CH=C(CN)-R4, -<br>
C(=NOH)-NH2, -CH=C(NO2)-R4) -CH(CN)-R5, -CH(CH2NO2)-R5, 5-<br>
tetrazolyl, 2-(4,5-dihydroxazolyl), l,2,4-oxadiazolidin-3-yl-5-one,<br>
wherein R4 is hydrogen, linear or branched alkyl from 1 to 6 carbon<br>
atoms, nitrile, carboxyalkoxy. Of these possible compounds, WO<br>
97/31003 enables the disclosure only of camptothecin derivatives<br>
bearing at position 7 the group —CN and -CH=C(CN)2, with<br>
unsubstituted positions 9 and 10.<br>
Of these compounds, the best one proved to be the 7-nitrile (R4 = -CN),<br>
hereinafter named CPT 83, with cytotoxic activity on non-small cells<br>
lung carcinoma (non-SCLC, H-460). This tumour line is intrinsically<br>
resistant to cytotoxic therapy and is only moderately responsive to<br>
topoisomerase I inhibitors, notwithstanding the overexpression of the<br>
target enzyme. CPT 83 is more active than Topotecan, taken as<br>
reference compound and on the whole it offers a better<br>
pharmacological profile, even in terms of tolerability, then a better<br>
therapeutic index.<br>
CPT 83 is prepared through a synthesis route comprising the oxidation<br>
of 7-hydroxymethylcamptothecin to camptothecin 7-aldehyde, the<br>
transformation of the latter into oxime and final conversion into<br>
nitrile.<br>
The starting compound and the intermediates are disclosed in Sawada<br>
et al, Chem. Pharm. Bull, 39, (10), 2574, (1991). This paper makes<br>
reference to a patent family with priority of 1981, for example<br>
European patent application EP 0 056 692, published in 1982. In these<br>
publications there are disclosed, among others, the compounds<br>
camptothecin 7-aldehyde and its oxime. The usefulness of these<br>
derivatives is to provide compounds with antitumor activity having<br>
low toxicity starting from 7-hydroxymethylcamptothecin. In the paper<br>
published on Chem. Pharm. Bull, 39, (10) 2574, (1991), the authors<br>
demonstrate that, with respect to camptothecin, the 7-alkyl and 7-<br>
acyloxymethyl derivatives, which were not foreseen in the above<br>
mentioned patent application, are the more active compounds on lines<br>
of murine leukemia L1210, while lower activity, always with respect to<br>
camptothecin, was observed in compounds bearing 7-substitutions<br>
with high polar character, such as hydrazones and the oxime -<br>
CH(=NOH).<br>
EP 1 044 977 discloses camptothecin derivatives bearing an ozime O-<br>
substituted at position 7. The general formula comprises also<br>
camptothecin derivatives bearing an enamine group at position 7. In<br>
this reference, the main teaching is directed to the antitumor activity<br>
of oxime derivatives, while imines are given in only few examples of<br>
synthetic preparation, but no pharmacological data are provided.<br>
Subsequent work of the inventors of the above mentione patent was<br>
focused on oxime derivatives, in particular the tert-butoxy one, which,<br>
under the name of Gimatecan is now under clinical trial. Imines were<br>
considered just an alternative to oximes, but first pharmacological<br>
assays discouraged further development of this class.<br>

according to the nature of the R4 group linked to the nitrogen of the 7-<br>
iminomethyl group.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) wherein R4 is as above defined can be<br>
prepared starting from camptothecin 7-aldehyde (formula la, R5<br>

wherein R1 is the group —C(R5)=O, and R5 is as defined for the formula<br>
(I), R2 and R3 are as defined in formula (I). The compound of formula<br>

is as above, to give compounds of formula (I), wherein Ri is the group —<br>
C(Rs)=N-R4, R4 is defined as in formula 1. The reaction can be carried<br>
out with conventional methods well known to the person skilled in the<br>
art, being a normal formation of an imine. Preferably, the molar ratio<br>
between 7-aldehyde or 7-keto camptothecin and amine is comprised<br>
between 1:3 and 3:1. The salts of the amine of interest can also be<br>
used. The reaction is carried out in the presence of a base, for example<br>
an inorganic base, such as potassium carbonate, or organic, such as<br>
triethylamine or diazabicyclononene, using polar solvents, preferably<br>
methanol or ethanol and carrying out the reaction at a temperature<br>
comprised between room temperature and solvent boiling point,<br>
optionally in the presence of dehydrating agents, for example sodium<br>
or magnesium sulfate, molecular sieves. If desired it is also possible to<br>
carry out the reaction in the presence of a catalyst, for example a<br>
Lewis acid (as disclosed for example by Moretti and Torre, Syntliesis,<br>
1970, 141; or by Kobayashi, et al, Synlett, 1977, 115).<br>
The camptothecin 7-aldehyde and the camptothecin 7-oxime are<br>
disclosed in the patent application EP 0 056 692 and in the mentioned<br>
Sawada, et al., Chem. Pharm. Bull, 39, (10) 2574 (1991).<br>
N1-oxides of the compounds of formula (I) are prepared according to<br>
well-known methods of oxidation of heteroaromatic nitrogen,<br>
preferably by oxidation with acetic or trifluoroacetic acid and hydrogen<br>
peroxide, or by reaction with organic peroxyacids (A Albini and S.<br>
Pietra, Heterocyclic N-oxides, CRC, 1991).<br>
Regarding the various meanings of R4, present in the different<br>
reactives of formula II, these reactives are available in the market, or<br>
can be prepared according to well-known methods in literature, which<br>
the expert in the field can resort to, completing with their own<br>
knowledge of the argument.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are obtained with conventional<br>
methods found in the literature, and do not necessitate of further<br>
disclosure.<br>
The compounds disclosed in the present invention show<br>
antiproliferative activity, therefore are useful for their therapeutical<br>
activity, and posses physico-chemical properties that make them<br>
suitable to be formulated in pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions comprise at least a compound of<br>
formula (I), in an amount such as to produce a significant<br>
therapeutical effect, in particular antitumoral effect. The compositions<br>
comprised within the present invention are conventional and are<br>
obtained with commonly used methods in the pharmaceutical industry.<br>
According to the desired administration route, the compositions shall<br>
be in solid or liquid form, suitable to the oral, parenteral, intravenous<br>
route. The compositions according to the present invention comprise<br>
together with the active ingredients at least a pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable vehicle or excipient. Formulation co-adjuvants, for example<br>
solubilizing, dispersing, suspending, emulsifying agents can be<br>
particularly useful.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) can also be used in combination with<br>
other active ingredients, for example other antitumor drugs, both in<br>
separate forms, and in a single dose form.<br>
The compounds according to the present invention are useful as<br>
medicaments with antitumor activity, for example in lung tumors,<br>
such as the non-small cell lung tumour, tumors of the colon-rectum,<br>
prostate, gliomas.<br>
Cytotoxide activity of the compounds of the present invention was<br>
assayed in cell systems of human tumour cells, using the<br>
antiproliferative activity test as a method of evaluation of the cytotoxic<br>
potential.<br>
The cell line used is a lung non-small cell carcinoma that belongs to<br>
non-small cells hystotype named NCI H460.<br>
For the in vivo studies, the solubilization was carried out in 10%<br>
DMSO in bidistilled water, being impossible the solubilization in<br>
saline, and the administration for the oral route was carried out at a<br>
volume of 10 ml/kg.<br>
Antitumoral activity<br>
Atimic nu/nu Swiss mice (Charles River, Calco, Italia), ageing 10-12<br>
weeks were used. The animals were maintained in laminar flow rooms,<br>
according to the guidelines of the United Kingdom Co-ordination<br>
Committee Cancer Research. Experimental protocols were approved by<br>
the Ethical Committee for animal experimentation of Istituto<br>
Nazionale per lo Studio e la Cura dei Tumori.<br>
Tumour fragments of about 2x2x2 mm coming from mice to which<br>
were inoculated s.c. 106 cells NCI H460/mouse, were implanted s.c.<br>
bilaterally in groups of 5 mice each.<br>
The animals were treated with the compounds when the tumour began<br>
to be palpable.<br>
Twice a week, using a Vernier calliper, the width, minimum diameter<br>
(1), length and maximum diameter (L) of the tumors were measured, in<br>
mm. The tumour volume (mm3) was calculated according to the<br>
formula l2xL/2. Efficacy of the molecule was evaluated as TVI percent<br>
of the treated group versus the control group according to the formula<br>
TVP/o = 100-(T/Cxl00), wherein T is the mean value of the tumour<br>
volume of the treated group and C of control one. A compound is<br>
considered active when TVI% &gt; 50.<br>
Further advantages of these molecules can be identified in the wide<br>
interval of effective doses, indicating an increase of therapeutic index<br>
and a higher handling in the therapeutical use, in particular if a<br>
prolonged administration in the time is foreseen, above all in the<br>
injectable formulations, with the use of variable schemes and doses.<br>
An important drawback of conventional camptothecins is the<br>
reversibility of their bond in the ternary complex (drug-DNA-enzyme).<br>
This reversibility affects drug efficacy, as it does not allow the<br>
transformation of the single strand DNA cleavage into double strand<br>
DNA cleavage during DNA synthesis.<br>
The advantage offered by the compounds according to the present<br>
invention is evident in overcoming the limit of reversibility of the<br>
ternary complex with respect to the state of the art.<br>
In preclinical investigations, the compounds of the present invention<br>
showed cytotoxic activity in various tumor cell lines.<br>
This broad spectrum of anticancer activity was confirmed in mice<br>
transplanted with human tumor xenografts, including NSCLC (H460,<br>
A549), prostate ca. (JCA-1), glioblastoma (GBM/7), gastric cancer.<br>
(MKN28), osteosarcoma (U2OS), ovarian cancer (A2780/Dx,<br>
A2780/DDP) and colon (HT29, CoBA) carcinomas as well as in murine<br>
lung cancer (M109) and leukaemia model (L1210).<br>
The preclinical data suggest that the compounds of the present<br>
invention may be an active anticancer agent against human's cancers<br>
and in particular against non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC),<br>
glioblastoma and prostate carcinoma.<br>
The antitumor activity of exemplary compounds of the invention is<br>
shown in the following Table 1.<br>
The high cytotoxic potency of the compounds of the present invention,<br>
herein represented in an exemplary way with one of the preferred<br>
compounds, ST 1737, is also reflected by the potent antitumor activity.<br>
Using a panel of tumor xenografts characterized by a significant<br>
responsiveness to Topotecan (TPT) (i.e. TVI &gt; 80%), the spectrum of<br>
antitumor activity of the compounds of the present invention, against a<br>
significant number of human tumor models was substantially<br>
improved. In particular, an impressive antitumor efficacy was found in<br>
the treatment of many tumor models, where very high regressions<br>
were achieved in a large number of treated animals. Moreover, the<br>
compounds of the present invention, were able to induce substantial<br>
CR in the tumors characterized by a MDR-phenotype. This observation<br>
is of high importance, indicating that the compounds of the present<br>
invention are not a substrate for P-glycoprotein.<br>
Additional therapeutic advantages of the compounds of the present<br>
invention are related to a) an improvement of the therapeutic index, b)<br>
drug efficacy in a large range of doses, c) evidence of efficacy using<br>
quite different schedules, making the compounds of the present<br>
invention less dependent on the treatment schedule than that of<br>
Topotecan.<br>
The following examples further illustrate the invention.<br>
Example 1<br>
General procedure: To a suspension of Yb(OTf)3 (16 mg, 0.03 mmol) in<br>
5 ml of anhydrous CH2Cl2 containing 4A MS, a solution of 7-<br>
formylcamptothecin (100 mg, 0.26 mmol) in 20 ml of CH2Cl2 is added,<br>
followed by a solution of the amine (0.26 mmol) in 0.5 ml of CH2Cl2.<br>
The resulting mixture is stirred at room temperature until the reaction<br>
is complete. After filtering the sieves, 20 ml of water are added and the<br>
two phases are separated. The aqueous layer is rapidly extracted three<br>
times with dichloromethane. The combined organic phases are dried<br>
and evaporated, and the product purified by flash chromatography on<br>
silica gel.<br>
The following compounds were obtained. In some cases antitumor<br>
