The  present  invention  relates to  a  cellular  automata  based authentication device for message communication systems.<br>
Message authentication schemes have their applications in electronic payment systems and other transactions in e-commerce. They can be used for validation of identity of system users and for verification of transactions in the distributed environment of large organisations or corporate houses.<br>
Many message authentication schemes are available these days. Some of the more popular and important schemes are described b e1ow.<br>
One of the most widely used message authentication scheme is MD—5 function developed by Ronald Rivest. It is based on MD-4 which is again an improvement of MD-2. All the three functions produce an 128-bit output signature for the input message padded to a fixed block length. Since MD—5 is; by the most commonly used scheme a comparison of i ts performance has been done with that of the present invention.<br>
HAVAL is an extension of MD-5 proposed by Zheng, Pieprzyfc and Seberry. It can produce variable length output from 92-bits to 256-bits.  Haval can be run  on different number of  'rounds'  of<br><br>
internal algorithm, so that it can be made faster than MD-5, or alternately produces longer hash code output which is potentially more secure.<br>
SHA was prepared by NIST in collaboration with MSA. It is similar to MD-4 but rectified i ts cryptographic drawbacks and produces 160-bit output instead of 128-bit- This algorithm is designed to be securedc such that to find two different messages to produce same digest or to recover the message from the digest requires infeasible computational cost.<br>
In message authentication code (MAC)  from the sender side,  data<br>
Dsent  in  plaintext or ciphertext is created and  another  k-bit<br>
message  authentication  code  MACsent is generated  which  is  a<br>
function  of  Dsent  and a secret key.  The  message  transmitted<br>
(Msent)  is Dsent with MACsent appended at the end. The  receiver<br>
uses the same procedure to calculate message authentication  code<br>
MACcal from the data received Dree; if MACcal is identical to the<br>
MACrec then the data received is authenticated-.<br>
Checksums are calculated as simple 1inear or polynomial functions of the message input, and produces a small value (16 or 32 bits).<br><br>
-  4  -<br>
They are easy to calculate and that is why very unreliable. A file can be easily altered so that its checksum value remains same before and after alteration, and hence prone to tampering.<br>
Ralph Merkle designed SNEFRU,which is essentially a one-way  hash<br>
function  for  one-time signature as well  as  authentication  of<br>
public  files,  also  can  run  on  various  rounds  of  internal<br>
algorithm. But cryptographic analysis confirms that one can  find<br>
arbitrary messages that hash to a given 128-bit string if 4 round<br>
SNEFRU  is used. There were several attacks on MD—4 citing  flaws<br>
in  its  efficacy; if round 1 (of total 3) is  omitted  from  the<br>
compression  function of MD—4, it was shown that  collisions  for<br>
different, set of inputs do take place; it was further  confirmed<br>
that col1ision could take place even within milliseconds (if  run<br>
even  on a PC) for inputs differing only on 3—bits if round 3  of<br>
the  compression function is omitted. These  criticisms  actually<br>
motivated Rivest to propose the MD—5 version.<br>
All these and other authentication functions that can be found in the 1 iterature in the past decade suffer from enormous time and resource requirements, as a result their hardware implementation become costly as well as complicated.<br><br>
- 5 -<br>
The problem of message authentication can be described in simple terms as follows:<br>
Given : A received message (Mrec).<br>
Decide : Whether the received message should  be accepted as identical to the message originated by the sender (Msent).<br>
Basically  message authentication is a msny-to-one function.	The<br>
input to the function is the message block to be transmitted	and<br>
the output is the digital signature which is appended at the	end<br>
of transmission.<br>
The present invention relates to a cellular automata (CA) based authentication device for message communication system, comprising<br>
a programmable cellular automata PCA (l) rule vector of which can be modified dynamically;<br>
a rule register (2) for holding individual message words and for forming rules for driving the PCA;<br>
—	a two  predecessors single attractor TPSA register  (3)<br>
for holding the rule for the PCA;<br>
—	a   complement  vector- register  (4)  for  holding  the<br>
complement vector for tunning the PCA;<br><br>
- 6 -<br>
-	start and  final address register " for  providing<br>
authentication signature as PCA content; and<br>
-	a  controller (7)  for generating  timing  and  control<br>
signals for authentication.<br>
The  invention  can now be described in detail with the  help  of tables X and 2 and the accompanying drawings where:<br>

Fig.4  : describes a complete n-bi t 90-150 PCA structure. Fig.5  : describes the complete architecture of the proposed  CA based  authentication device for  message  communication systems.<br>
A cellular automata (CA) consists of a number of interconnected cells arranged spatially in a regular manner. In the most general case, each such cell can exist in m different states and the next state of any particular cell depends on the present status of k of its neighbours. Such a general CA is called an m-state, k-neighbourhood CA. The present invention uses a simple 2-state,3-neighbourhood CA with the cells arranged linearly in one dimension. Each of the cells essential comprises of a memory built with a D flip-flop and a combinational logic that generates the next-state of the cell from the present states of neighbouring cells.<br>
If the next state -function of a cell is expressed in the form  of a  truth table, then the decimal equivalent of the output  column<br><br>
8<br>
in  the truth table is conventionally called the CA  rule  number for the cell.<br>
Here,investigation is carried out with a particular class of nongroup CA called two predecessors single attractor (TPSA) CA that can be employed for generating an efficient authentication function. As the name suggests, TPSA CA are characterized by the fact that every Reachable state in the transition graph has got only two predecessors. The only cye1ic state is the1 all-zero state, which is an attractor. The state transition graph of such a CA is an inverted tree as shown in Figure 1.<br>
If some (or all) of the XOR gates of a linear CA are converted to XNOR logic, the state-transition diagram of the resulting CA can be analyzed with the characteristic matrix T of the corresponding 1inear CA. and the complement vector F. For an n-cell CA, the complement vector F is an n—bit vector with F[i] = 1 if the logic for the i-th cell is changed to XNOR, otherwise it is zero. If T is the next state function of this complemented CA, then corresponding to any state x, the next state is given by, Tx = Tx • F.<br>
Figure   2   displays  the  state  transition  behaviour   of   a complemented TPSA CA machine.<br><br>
9<br>
In the following, we detail an algorithm for constructing an n-bit   TPSA CA using rule 90 and 150 only. This particular CA  and<br>
its complemented one will be utilized in authentication device of present invention to a great extent.<br>
Algorithm 1 Construct-CA(n)<br>
Input : n, the size of the CA<br>
Output : AIT n-bit CA with requisite set of rules r[i],i=l to n,<br>
where r[i] denotes the rule for i—th cell,<br>
begin<br><br><br>
10<br>
else if (n = 2k ) then/* n even; split into two equal parts  of length k * /<br>
C<br>
for each part<br>
recursively call Construct-CA(k);<br>
Change the rules of cells k<br>
and k + 1 fromrule '90' to rule '150'<br>
or vice—versa;<br><br><br>
- 11  -<br>
Any  CA  generated by the Construct-CA algorithm is  TPSA.  Some examples  of  90-150 TPSA CA constructed by this  algorithm  have been noted in Table 1.<br><br>
It  may  be noted that in CA based data  authentication  scheme a  cell  configured with rule 90  depends only on  its  left  and right  neighbours,  whereas, a cell  controlled  with  rule  150 depends  upon  itself,  left  and right  neighbours.  The  CA  is initially loaded with the authenticationkey value agreed upon  by both the parties. For n-bit key, length of the CA is n, and n-bit stream of message data is used to control the rule  configuration of the individual CA cells. If the i-th bit of a stream is '0'  , then  i-th  cel1 is configured to run under  rule 90  else  under rule  150. After applying an n-bit stream to configure the  rule, the  CA is run for one cycle Next,the CA is again configured  for the  rule using the next n-bit stream of the message, and is  run for another cycle, and so on.<br><br>
12<br>
To make the cracking complexity of the scheme high, the 90-150 TPSA CA and is complemented form between every two n-bit mesage streams have been used. That is, after running the CA with rule configured by a message stream, the CA is configured as a 90-150 TPSA CA, constructed as per Construct-CA algorithm and run for one cycle, and as a complemented one of the above and run for one clock cycle.<br>
Since the characteristic: matrix of a TPSA CA is singular, its inverse does not exist.This iancreases the cracking complexity by a factor of two for every run. Complemented CA contributes to the cracking complexity in identical fashion, moreover, it ensures that signature is never all zero, and run of the CA stops only when all of message data array is exhausted.<br>
In the foilowing a step—by-step enumeration of the authentication scheme is given.<br>
Step  is  Generate  an n-bit TPSA  CA,  executing  the	algorithm<br>
Construct-CA. Step  2:  Generate the corresponding  complemented  CA,  usings<br>
Theorem 10 to get the complement vector F,<br><br>
13<br>
Step  3:  Let K be the key of length n, known to both the parties (we gave randomly generated key). Let M be the message length-  Add pad (each a string of single one  followed by all zeros) so that total length of key-code, message and  pad  is multiple of n. The first  element  of  the message data array is now the key-Step 4:   Load- the CA with the seed - which is the first  element of the data array, i.e. key.<br>
Step  5:  (i)  Take the next stream of n—bits from  the  message data array, configure rule of the n-bit CA with the stream and run for one clock cycle.<br>
(ii) run the CA for next clock cycle in TPSA mode  with rule formed in Step 1.<br>
(i i i) run the CA for another cycle in complemented mode with rule and complement vector F in Step 2.<br>
Step  6:  If all the message data elements are  exhausted  then stop - CA contains now the authentication signature; else go to Step 5.<br><br>
14<br>
Table 2 shows the result of the experiments performed in a HP — 9000 machine. Message length varies from 116 KBytes to 11.6 MBytes; the string length (number of bits) of the array is around 31 bits. The authentication signature length is 12S. Comparitive results for MD-5 for CPU time is shown along with - Message data and key are generated randomly.<br>
Since TPSA C. A. and its complement is used whose state transition generates  inverted  tree, at every stage of the run  with  n—bit<br>
message  stream, the probability of tracint back to the  original<br>
content  is  2  .   If  total message data  array  forms  such  k<br>
-2k elements, then cracking probability is is 2   ; for large k  this<br>
is  less than 2   and it is well nigh impossible to get back  the<br>
original  key  from the signature, except by brute  force  random<br>
n trial, which ensures probability not greater than one in 2 -<br>
It  can  be  seen  that even  for  software  implementation,  the proposed method is nearly 1.6 times faster than MD-5. The hardware analysis of parallel implementation of MD—5 based on basic step data flow diagram is detailed in Joseph's paper  tiles "Performance analysis of md5" in ACM'Bigcomm.1955.<br>
It  shows that such a hardware can run at most at 300 MHz  clock, and given 5 basic steps per 32-bit word of input, and considering<br><br>
15<br>
the critical path through the basic step, the maximum speed of performance achievable for any MD—5 based hardware (even for parallel implementation) is 256 Mbps.<br>
Now, if we run the CA at compatible clock speed of 300 MHz, we will  require  altogether 4 clock cycles (one to load  the  input<br>
word,  and  another 3 from step-5) to process  one  32-bit  input<br>
word.  This gives a performance limit of 300 x 106 X 32  4<br>
or 2400 Mbps. This is nearly 10 times faster than MD-5 .<br>
Even for technology independent realization, the proposed	method<br>
takes  6  cycles  (apart from much more  complicated  and	costly<br>
hardware), thus proposed device is atleast 6 times faster	at the<br>
technological limit.<br>
The hardware implementation of the CA structure, as reported earlier, suits ideally for VLSI implementation for its simple, modular, and regular structure with local interconnections- A CA whose rule vector can be modified dynamically is referred to as Programmable CA (PCA). Such a PCA can be used for hardwired data authenticator. Because of its local interconnections, the CA can be made to run at a very high clock rate, in the region of 300 MHz or more.<br><br>
- 16 -<br>
To retain the flexibility of applying different set of rules  for<br>
different  n  (CA-length)  PCA structure has  been  employed.  An<br>
individual cell of PCA is shown in Fig. 3. To load an initial bit<br>
into  the cell,Auto is set to '0'; in the next clock  edge,  Seed<br>
gets loaded into D flip-flop. For free run of the CA, Auto is set<br>
to  one,  and  clock pulses are applled. Rule  configuration  is<br>
controlled  by S.C. (self control) lines. Depending on the  rules<br>
90  or 150 these lines will be either zero or  one  respectively.<br>
L.D. and R.D. (left and right data) lines are output coming  from<br>
left and right neighbours.<br><br>
The complete n-bit  90-150 PCA structure is shown in Fig.4.  Left and  right boundaries are set to zero. Seed will be  loaded  into<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
PCA with Auto=O; for Auto=l, CA will have transition to its  next state on every clock edge.<br>
Register  transfer  level  (RTL)  description  of  the   complete hardware  scheme  is shown in Fig.5.  Individual  components  are<br>
described' as follows : <br>
I.	N-bit PCA(1): this is an N-bit 90-150 PCA, first  loaded  with<br>
seed   (key).  It  is  run  in  three  different   configurations control led  by  message  stream,  TPEA  uncomplemented  and  TPSA<br>
complemented, depending on S.Cv and XOR values. <br>
II.	Rule  Reg(2): It holds individual message words  which  gives<br>
S.C. input to form rule for driving the PCA.<br>
III.	TPSA  Regi(3):  Holds the rule for n-bit 90-150  PCA  as  per<br>
Construct— CA procedure<br>
IV.	Complement Vector Reg-: This holds the complement vector to<br><br>
run  the  PCA  with  XNOR  logic.  Apart  from  introducing  non-linearity,  this  ensures PCA does not halt even if  its  content<br>
become zero.	<br>
V.	Address  Registers(5,6): Start Address Reg(5). is  initialised  to<br>
zero and incremented every time to bring message word from memory<br><br>
to Rule Reg.; Final Address Reg.(6)contains the address of the last<br>
location  of the message data array. When these two become  equal<br><br>
18<br>
Comparator(8) generates 'match' signal to the controller which  now stops  the  running of the PCA. Authentication signature  is  now<br>
available as PCA content.<br>
VI. Controller(7) It generates timing and control signalls for  the<br>
micro-operations as described below :<br>
FOR micro—operations for authentication,<br>
1.	Clear the Start Address Reg. with c  = 1.<br><br>
2.	Load Final Address Reg. with last location address, with c =1<br>
3.	Load complement vector F into Compl. Vector Reg.; TPSA  rule<br>
for n-bit 150-90 CA (as generated by Construct-CA algorithm) into<br>
TPSA Reg., with c  =1.<br>
5<br>
4.	Load  PCA with seed which is key and first element  of  the<br>
data array with c  = 1, and c  =1.<br>
9	7<br>
5.	Run the PCA for one clock cycle with c  = 1 ; as  per  rule<br>
9 governed by the message word.<br>
6.      Run the PCA for the next clock cycle with TPSA rule  from<br>
TPSA  REG.with  c  = I and c   = 1. This ensures   that  now  the<br>
o	9<br>
-1 probability of getting back to the parent state (of PCA) is 2<br>
7.       Run the PCA for next clock cycle with complement  vector<br>
1	9<br>
for XNOR logic, with C  = 1 and c  = 1.<br>
Increment the Start Address Reg with c  = 1 .<br>
2<br><br>
19<br><br>
B.       Load Rule Reg. by the next message data from memory with<br>
c  = 1 .<br>
6 9.       Go to step no. 5.<br>
So, for one data we require about 4 clock cycles (Step 5—8) . Hence, for 300 MHzm clock of the CPU for 1.2 MByte data with 32-bit PCA (32-bit memory word), the time required for signature generation is nearly equal to 4 x 1-2 x 106 (32 x 300 x 10 sec; comparing with result ir. Table-2, this is nearly 2600 or 3-order faster.<br>
The   design  has  been  specified  in  Verilog,  simulated   for<br>
functional  correctness, and synthesized using the  Cadence  tool<br>
2 Synergy. It requires an area of 324982.25 urn  using the  Cellslib<br>
1ibrary.<br>
Software version of the scheme is nearty two times faster than the standard MD-5 method with the same level of performance. The hardware version is about 3-order of magnitude faster- The ASIC for the device has been implemented using Cadence tool Synergy. The detail design including circuit diagram, routing, and placement of the functional device will be given with the complete specification.<br><br>
