				<td>POLYURETHANE-BASED ANHYDROUS SIZING COMPOSITION FOR GLASS<br>
STRANDS, GLASS STRANDS OBTAINED AND COMPOSITES COMPRISING<br>
SAlD STRANDS<br>
The present invention relates to a sizing composition for glass strands, to the<br>
glass strands obtained and to the composites incorporating said glass strands.<br>
More precisely, it relates to an anhydrous sizing composition comprising<br>
compounds with isocyanate reactive functional groups and compounds with<br>
hydroxyl and/or amine functional groups that are capable of reacting to form<br>
polyurethanes and/or polyureas.<br>
The manufacture of glass reinforcing strands is carried out in a known<br>
manner using molten glass streams emanating from the orifices of bushings.<br>
These streams are drawn in the form of continuous filaments, and then these<br>
filaments are brought together as base strands that are then collected in various<br>
forms: bobbins of continuous sTrands, continuous- or chopped-strand mats,<br>
chopped strands, etc.<br>
Before they are brought together in the form of strands, the filaments are<br>
coated with a size by being passec them over a sizing member. The application of<br>
a size is necessary, on the one hand, for obtaining strands and, on the other hand,<br>
for producing composites that combine said strands as reinforcing agent with other<br>
organic and/or inorganic materials.<br>
The size serves in the first place as a lubricant and protects the strands from<br>
the abrasion resulting from high-speed friction of the strands on the various<br>
members encountered in the aforeinentioned process. It is important for the glass<br>
strand to possess a slippability (or "slip") sufficient to withstand the subsequent<br>
conversion operations, such as unwinding from and winding onto appropriate<br>
supports, or weaving, so as to minimize any friction liable to break the filaments.<br>
The size also has the function of giving the aforementioned strands integrity,<br>
that is to say of binding the filaments together within the strands. This integrity is<br><br>
more particularly desirable in textile applications in which the strands are<br>
subjected to high mechanical, especially tensile, stresses. Thus, when the<br>
filaments are poorly bonded together, they have a tendency to break more easily<br>
when they are stressed, resulting in the formation of fuzz that disrupts the<br>
operation of the textile machines, or even requires them to be completely shut<br>
down. In addition, non-integral strands are considered as being tricky to handle,<br>
especially when they are to be used to form bobbins, as broken filaments then<br>
appear along the sides. Apart from the unsatisfactory esthetic appearance, it is<br>
more difficult to unwind the strands removed from these packages.<br>
The size also has the role of promoting the wetting and/or impregnation of<br>
the strands with the materials to be reinforced, by creating bonds between the<br>
strands and these materials. The quality of the adhesion of the material to the<br>
strands and the wettability and/or impregnability of the strands by the material<br>
depend on the mechanical properties of the resulting composites. In most cases,<br>
the size makes it possible to obtain composites having improved mechanical<br>
properties.<br>
The sizing compositions must also be compatible with the strand production<br>
conditions that in particular impose high filament drawing rates, which may be up<br>
to several tens of meters per second. They must also withstand the shear forces<br>
induced by the passage of the filaments, especially as regards the viscosity, which<br>
must not appreciably fluctuate, and be capable of correctly wetting the surface of<br>
the filaments so as to obtain unifonn sheathing over their entire length.<br>
Sizing compositions that contain components capable of curing after being<br>
deposited on the glass must furthermore remain stable at the temperatures<br>
(around 60 to 100Â°C) beneath the bushing. In particular, it is desirable to ensure<br>
that the curable constituents possess a low vapor pressure at the temperatures<br>
indicated, so as to avoid any problem of a concentration variation resulting from<br>
the volatilization of certain constituetnts. It is also important to control the degree of<br>
conversion defined by the ratio of the number of functional groups that have<br>
reacted in the size to the number of initial reactive functional groups in order to<br>
guarantee that sized glass strands of constant quality are obtained. The degree of<br>
conversion must especially be very close to the expected theoretical value in order<br>
to prevent the size from changing over time.<br><br>
As a general rule, the sizing compositions are chosen so as to fulfill the<br>
aforementioned functions and so as not to undergo chemical reactions causing a<br>
substantial increase in the viscosity, both during storage at room temperature and<br>
under the higher temperature conditions beneath the bushing.<br>
The sizes most commonly employed are low-viscosity aqueous sizes.<br>
Although very easy to use, they do have disadvantages. In particular, these sizes<br>
contain a very large proportion of water, generally more than 80%, the water<br>
having to be removed after deposition on the glass since water results in a<br>
reduction in adhesion between that strands and the material to be reinforced. A<br>
well-known means consists in drying the glass strands thermally, but this is a<br>
lengthy and expensive operation that needs to be matched perfectly to the strand<br>
manufacturing conditions. Moreover, this treatment is not neutral with respect to<br>
the strand. In particular, when the sized strand is in the form of packages, what<br>
may occur is a change in the distribution of the constituents of the size, by<br>
irregular and/or selective migration, a coloration of the strand and a deformation of<br>
the package.<br>
Aqueous sizing compositions containing polyurethanes have already been<br>
proposed. Thus, EP-A-0 554 173 discloses a size intended for coating glass<br>
strands used in the construction of molded composites, the bonding agent of<br>
which is formed from one or more polyurethane resins, optionally combined with<br>
one or more polyepoxides. JP-2000044793 proposes the reinforcement of<br>
thermoplastics by means of glass strands treated with a sizing composition<br>
comprising a polyurethane resin in emulsion, a coupling agent and a lubricant.<br>
Moreover, "anhydrous" sizing compositions are known, that is to say those<br>
comprising less than 5% by weight of solvent and consisting of a base system<br>
formed from curable components.<br>
In FR-A-2 727 972, the sizing composition is capable of curing under the<br>
action of UV radiation or an electron beam. The curable base system contains at<br>
least one component of molecular mass less than 750, having at least one epoxy<br>
functional group and comprising ,)t least 60% by weight of one or more<br>
components of molecular mass less lhan 750 having at least one epoxy, hydroxyl,<br>
vinyl ether, acrylic or methacrylic functional group.<br>
FR-A-2 772 369 discloses a sizing composition for glass strands that does<br>
not require a heat treatment step after deposition on the strand. It comprises at<br><br>
least 60% by weight of components capable of curing, these components being, in<br>
the case of at least 60% of them, components of molecular mass less than 750<br>
and these curable components comprising at least one mixture of one of more<br>
components having at least one acrylic and/or methacrylic reactive functional<br>
group and of one or more components having at least one primary amine and/or<br>
secondary amine functional group, at least 20% by weight of these components<br>
possessing at least two acrylic, methacrylic, primary amine and/or secondary<br>
amine reactive functional groups.<br>
One object of the present invention is to propose a thermally curable<br>
anhydrous sizing composition for coating glass strands, which involves the<br>
reaction of one or more compounds containing one or more isocyanate functional<br>
groups and one or more compounds containing one or more hydroxyl functional<br>
groups and, optionally, of one or more compounds containing one or more amine<br>
functional groups.<br>
Another object of the presenl invention is to propose a sizing composition in<br>
which the reaction time of the curable system may range, in order to be adapted to<br>
the application conditions, from a .system able to crosslink relatively slowly, in one<br>
or a few hours, to an extremely retactive system having a gel time of around ten<br>
minutes.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose a sizing composition that makes<br>
it possible to control the texture of the glass strands, that is to say their stiffness<br>
and their integrity.<br>
Another object of the invention is to propose glass strands coated with a size<br>
that makes them suitable for undergoing an operation for increasing their volume<br>
("bulking" operation).<br>
The sizing composition according to the invention consists of a solution<br>
comprising less than 5% by weight of solvent and comprising a curable base<br>
system, said system comprising at least 50% by weight of a mixture of:<br>
â¢	one or more components containing at least one isocyanate reactive<br>
functional group;<br>
â¢	one or more components containing at least one hydroxyl reactive<br>
functional group; and<br>
â¢	optionally, one or more components containing at least one amine reactive<br>
functional group.<br><br>
In the present invention, the expressions below have the following meanings:<br>
-	"solvent" is understood 1o mean water and organic solvents capable of<br>
being used to dissolve certain curable components. The presence of one or more<br>
solvents in a limited amount does not require any particular treatment in order to<br>
remove them. In most cases, the sizes according to the invention are completely<br>
free of solvent;<br>
-	"cure", "curable", "curing", etc. are understood to mean "cure and/or<br>
crosslink", "curable and/or crosslinkable", "curing and/or crosslinking", etc.,<br>
respectively,<br>
-	"reactive functional group" is understood to mean a functional group that<br>
can act in the size curing reaction, it being possible for the curing to take place at<br>
the usual strand production temperature (around 20 to 100Â°C) with no additional<br>
supply of energy, or else at a Higher temperature, up to about 150Â°C (thermal<br>
curing); and<br>
-	"curable base system" is understood to mean the combination of essential<br>
components that allow the expected polyurethane/polyurea structure of the size to<br>
be obtained.<br>
Hereafter, the expressions "one or more isocyanate_componentsH, "one or<br>
more hvdroxvl components" and "one or more amine compopents" are understood<br>
to mean "one or more components containing at least one isocyanate reactive<br>
functional group", "one or mom components containing at least one hydroxyl<br>
reactive functional group" and "one or more components containing at least one<br>
amine reactive functional group", respectively.<br>
The sizing composition according to the invention is compatible with the<br>
glass strand production conditions imposed by the direct process, the viscosity of<br>
the composition being adapted according to the draw speed and the diameter of<br>
the filaments made to pass through the sizing composition. As a general rule, it is<br>
desirable for the viscosity not to oxceed 400 mPa.s, preferably 150 mPa.s, so that<br>
the sizing composition can be uniformly distributed over the surface of the glass<br>
filaments. The composition according to the invention also has a strand wetting<br>
rate compatible with the strand draw rate.<br>
As a general rule, the curable base system represents 50 to 100% by weight<br>
of the sizing composition according to the invention,.mainly 60 to 100% by weight<br>
of the composition and, in most cases, 75 to 90% by weight of the composition.<br><br>
The base system consists predominantly (preferably 75% by weight and up<br>
to 100% by weight in most cases I of one or more isocyanate components and one<br>
or more hydroxyl components, and where appropriate one or more amine<br>
components, the use of this mixture of components allowing polyurethane or<br>
poly(urethane-urea) polymers to be obtained by the reaction of the various<br>
isocyanate, hydroxyl and amine functional groups of the initial constituents. It is<br>
these polymers that predominant!/ participate in the structure of the size, and it is<br>
from this structure that the properties of the sized glass strands directly stem.<br>
Furthermore, the base system comprises a majority (preferably at least 70%<br>
by weight and better still at least 80% by weight) of one or more components of<br>
molecular mass less than 750, this component or these components normally<br>
forming part, in most cases, of the aforementioned isocyanate, hydroxyl and amine<br>
components.<br>
Preferably, and in general according to the invention, the aforementioned<br>
components of molecular mass lÂ«ss than 750 are of molecular mass less than<br>
600.<br>
When the base system contains components of molecular mass less than<br>
750, it advantageously includes one or more isocyanate and/or hydroxy! and/or<br>
amine components of molecular mass greater than 1000 (prepolymers). The total<br>
content of these components is generally less than 20% by weight of the sizing<br>
composition, preferably less than 15%, as above this content the viscosity and the<br>
reactivity of the composition become too high to allow the size to be deposited on<br>
the glass strands under the conditions of the abovementioned process.<br>
In general, the reactivity of the base system is varied in order to be adapted<br>
to the application conditions. In particular, the gel time has a major influence on<br>
the size deposition quality and on the construction of the packages when the<br>
strand is collected in the form of bobbins. The gel time must not be less than about<br>
10 minutes in order to allow the size to be deposited beneath the bushing by<br>
means of sizing rolls with no significant risk of the size gelling on the rolls.<br>
Moreover, the gel time must not exceed 1.5 hours so that it is possible to obtain<br>
strand packages that can be handled on leaving the winder. Gel times varying<br>
from 15 to 45 minutes prove to be very satisfactory.<br>
According to certain embodiments, the base system according to the<br>
invention may optionally include a small proportion (less than 20%) of one or more<br><br>
components participating in the structure of the cured size, but having no<br>
isocyanate, hydroxyl or amine functional groups and/or a molecular mass greater<br>
than or equal to 1000. Preferably the proportion of these conponents is less than<br>
15%.<br>
According to the preferred embodiment of the invention, which allows<br>
particularly satisfactory results to tie obtained, the base system consists of one or<br>
more isocyanate components containing at least two isocyanate reactive<br>
functional groups, one or more hydroxyl components containing at least one<br>
hydroxyl reactive functional group and, optionally, one or more components<br>
containing at least one amine reactive functional group. Particularly<br>
advantageously, the base system consists either of one or more isocyanate<br>
components containing three isocyanate reactive functional groups and one or<br>
more hydroxyl components containing one to three hydroxyl reactive functional<br>
groups, or one or more isocyanate components containing three isocyanate<br>
reactive functional groups, one or more hydroxyl components containing a<br>
hydroxyl reactive functional group and one or more amine components containing<br>
two primary amine reactive functional groups.<br>
According to the invention, al or some of the hydroxyl components of the<br>
base system may contain one or more hydroxyl reactive functional groups and one<br>
or more amine reactive functional groups.<br>
The isocyanate component or components of the base system may<br>
especially be chosen from:<br>
-	aliphatic or cycloaliphatic isocyanates, such as hexyl isocyanate, dodecyl<br>
isocyanate, hexadecyl isocyanate, cyclohexyl isocyanate, 1-adamantyl<br>
isocyanate,	1,6-hexamethylene	diisosyanate	(HDI),<br>
1,12-dodecamethylene diisocyanate, isophorone diisocyanate (IPDI),<br>
1,1-methylenebis(4-isocyanatocyclohexane) (HMDI), transcyclohexane<br>
1,4-diisocyanate (CHDI), enters, such as butyl isocyanatoacetate and<br>
3-ethyl isocyanatopropionete, or ethers, such as trifluoroacetyl<br>
isocyanate;<br>
-	aromatic isocyanates, such as 3,5-dimethylphenyl isocyanate,<br>
4-methoxybenzyl isocyanate, 4-dimethylaminophenyl isocyanate,<br>
4-methoxyphenyl isocyanate, 4-ethoxyphenyl isocyanate, xylylene<br>
diisocyanate (XDI), toluone diisocyanate (TDI), naphthalene-<br><br>
1,5-diisocyanate (NDI), 4,4,'-diphenylmethane diisocyanate (MDI) and<br>
tetramethylxylene diisocyanate (TMXDI); and<br>
-	isocyanate-terminated prepolymers (NCO-prepolymers), for example<br>
TOLONATEÂ® HDT and TOLONATEÂ® HDB (NCO content: 20-25 %; sold<br>
by Rhodia), products resulting from the reaction between polyethers and<br>
isocyanates, such as polytetramethylene glycol/TDI prepolymers, for<br>
example CASTOMERÂ® E 1009 and CASTOMERÂ® E 1004 (NCO content:<br>
4.2 and 9.3% respective!/; sold by Baxenden); polypropylene glycol/TDI<br>
prepolymers, for example TRIXENEÂ® DP9B/1534 (NCO content: 4.4 %;<br>
sold by Baxenden) and products resulting from the reaction between<br>
polyesters and isocyanates, especially TDI, for example CASTOMERÂ®<br>
DP9A/956 (NCO content: 4 %; sold by Baxenden).<br>
Among the isocyanates that have just been mentioned, some are monomers<br>
whose vapor pressure is relatively high, making them potentially toxic to humans.<br>
This is why isocyanates in the form of prepolymers of molecular mass at least<br>
equal to 400 and preferably at least equal to 450 are preferred. Advantageously,<br>
the molecular mass is less than or equal to 2000, preferably less than or equal to<br>
1200, since above this the prepolymers have a high melting point or a high<br>
viscosity, which make the sizing composition difficult to apply to the glass<br>
filaments. Advantageously, the prepolymer has a content of free isocyanate<br>
reactive functional groups (NCO content) at least equal to 3%, preferably less than<br>
25% and advantageously greater than or equal to 5%.<br>
As a general rule according to the invention, the proportion of isocyanate<br>
component(s) in the base system represents 15 to 75%, and preferably 30 to 60%,<br>
by weight. Preferably, at least 10% of the isocyanate components are<br>
polyisocyanates, and advantageously 100% of the isocyanate components are<br>
polyisocyanates.<br>
The content of isocyanate component(s) in the composition is generally<br>
between 10 and 50% and preferably between 20 and 40% by weight.<br>
The hydroxyl component or components of the base system may be chosen<br>
from:<br>
-	aliphatic or cycloaliphatic alcohols, such as hexanol, octanol, dodecanol,<br>
cyclohexanol, 1,2-propanediol, 2-ethyl-2-hydroxymethyt-1,3-propanediol,<br>
butanediol, butenediol, pentanediol, hexanediol, cyclohexandiol,<br><br>
1,4-cyclohexanedimeth;anol, glycerol, trimethylolpropane and<br>
pentaerythritol;<br>
-	tertiary alkanolamines. such as 2-(diisopropylamino)etbanof,<br>
3-dimethylamino-1-propanol,	3-diethylamino-1,2-propanediol,<br>
3-dfisopropylamino-1,2-propanediol,	N-butyl-diethanolamine,<br>
triethanolamine and triisopropanolamine,<br>
-	monohydroxylated components of the hydroxyl-terminated polyester type,<br>
obtained by reaction between a fatty acid and a poly(alkylene oxide), such<br>
as polyethylene glycol isostearate or polypropylene glycol isostearate,<br>
components of the hydroxyl-terminated polyether type obtained by<br>
reaction between a fatty alcohol and ethylene oxide and/or propylene<br>
oxide, for example lauric alcohol having 4 ethylene oxide units, or by<br>
reaction between an alkyl phenol and ethylene oxide and/or propylene<br>
oxide, for example nonyl phenol having 8 ethylene oxide units; and<br>
- poly(oxyalkylene)polyols, for example poiy(oxyethylene)polyols,<br>
poly(oxypropylene)polyols	poly(oxyethyJene)(oxypropylene)po!yols,<br>
poly(tetrahydrofuran)polyois and poly(caprolactone)poiyols,	the<br>
molecular mass of which is preferably less than 1500.<br>
Among the hydroxyl compounds that have just been mentioned, those<br>
containing more than 5 carbon atoms are preferred. Compounds having a smaller<br>
number of carbon atoms may be employed when it is desired to lower the viscosity<br>
of the base system and/or to limit the chain length during curing.<br>
Preferably according to the invention, the hydroxyl components are chosen<br>
from alcohols containing at least two hydroxyl reactive functional groups, and<br>
better still two or three hydroxyl functional groups.<br>
As indicated above, the hydioxyl components may include one or more<br>
amine functional groups. Examples of such components are given later.<br>
Within the context of the invention, it is also possible to use, as hydroxyl<br>
components, components containing one or more epoxide functional groups, the<br>
epoxy ring of which may be opened by the action of a catalyst in order to generate<br>
a secondary hydroxyl. The catalyst that can be used for this purpose may be any<br>
catalyst known to those skilled in the art, as indicated later.<br>
As examples of such components, mention may be made of components<br>
containing an epoxy functional group such as cyclohexene monoxide, glycidyl<br><br>
ethers, particularly C4-C20 alkyl glycidyl ethers, phenyl glycidyl ether, alkyl phenyl<br>
glycidyl ethers, monoglycidyl ethers of derivatives of bisphenol A, especially of<br>
acryloxybisphenol A, and components containing several epoxy functional groups,<br>
such as polyglycidyl ethers, in particular 1,4-butanediol diglycidyl ether, neopentyl<br>
glycol diglycidyl ether, cyclohexaredimethanol diglycidyl ether, resorcmol diglycidyl<br>
ether, bisphenol A or bisphenol F: diglycidyl-ether, polybutadiene diglycidyl ether,<br>
polyglycol diepoxydes, trimethylolpropane triglycidyl ether and polyglycidyl ethers<br>
of alkyl polyesters.<br>
As a general rule according to the invention, the proportion of hydroxy!<br>
component(s) varies from 15 to 60%, and preferably 20 to 50%, by weight of the<br>
base system. Preferably, at least 15%, and advantageously at least 20%, of the<br>
hydroxy! component(s) are components comprising at least two hydroxyl reactive<br>
functional groups.<br>
The content of hydroxyl component(s) in the composition is generally<br>
between 15 and 55%, and preferably between 25 and 45%, by weight.<br>
The number of reactive sites of the hydroxyl components that can react with<br>
the reactive sites of the isocyanate components may vary greatly. In general, the<br>
ratio r of the number of isocyanate reactive sites to the number of hydroxyl<br>
reactive sites varies from 0.1 to 6 and preferably from 0.3 to 4, it being understood<br>
that an isocyanate functional group counts as one isocyanate reactive site and that<br>
a hydroxyl functional group counts as one hydroxyl reactive site.<br>
The amine component or components;, of the base system may be chosen<br>
from components containing one or more primary and/or secondary amine<br>
functional groups, such as components having linear, branched or cyclic<br>
hydrocarbon chain components, tor example, N.N-dibutylamine,<br>
N,N-dicyclohexylamine, aminoethylpiperazine, 2(2-aminoethoxy)ethanol, 3-amino-<br>
1-propanol, 2-amino-2-ethy!-1 -propanol, N-(2-aminoethyl)ethanolamine, 2-amino-<br>
2-ethyl-1,3-propanedioi, aromatic components, for example 1,3-diphenyiguanidine<br>
and 3,4-diaminotoluene, and amine-terminated polymers, for example<br>
(polybutadiene)diamine. According to the invention, some of the aforementioned<br>
amine compounds contain one or more hydroxyl functional groups as mentioned<br>
above.<br>
Preferably, the amine components are chosen from components containing<br>
at least two primary and/or secondary amine functional groups. So as to reduce<br><br>
the reactivity of the amine compounds, it may be envisaged to add a small amount<br>
(around 2 to 15% by weight of the composition) of a ketone, in particufar a<br>
diketone such as pentanediene, dibenzoylmethane, 2,2,6,6-trifluoro-<br>
3,5-heptanedione.	dimethyl-1,4-cyclohexanedione-2,5-dicarboxyiate,<br>
4,4,4-trifluoro-1-(2-naphtyl)-1,3-b butanedione, thenoyltrifluoroacetone, 2,2-dimethyl-<br>
6,6,7,7,8,8,8-heptafluoro-3,5-octanedione, 3-methyl-2,4-pentanedione, 1 -(2-furyl)-<br>
1,3-butanedione and 2,6-dimethyl-3,5-heptanedione. Pentanedione,<br>
dibenzoylmethane, 3-methyl-2,4-pentanedione and 2,6-dimethyl-3,5-heptanedione<br>
are preferred.<br>
As a general rule according to the invention, the proportion of amine<br>
component(s) represents 0 to 30% by weight of the base system and in most<br>
cases it is between 5 and 30%.<br>
The content of amine component(s) in the composition is generally between<br>
0 and 30%, and preferably between 0 and 20%, by weight.<br>
The number of reactive sites of the amine components that can react with the<br>
reactive sites of the isocyanate components may vary greatly. As a general rule,<br>
the ratio r of the number of isocyanate reactive sites to the sum of the number of<br>
hydroxyl reactive sites and of the number of amine reactive sites varies from 0.1 to<br>
6, and preferably from 0.3 to 4, it being understood that an isocyanate functional<br>
group counts as one isocyanate site, that a hydroxyl functional group counts as<br>
one hydroxyl reactive site, that a primary amine functional group counts as two<br>
amine reactive sites and that a secondary amine functional group counts as one<br>
amine reactive site.<br>
The sizing composition may include, in addition to the base system, at least<br>
one catalyst promoting size curing. This may, for example, be a specific catalyst<br>
for the synthesis of polyurethaneis, such as 1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane and<br>
1,8-diazabiscyclo[5.4.0]undec-7-ene, or else a catalyst suitable for epoxy<br>
components,	such	as	tris(N,N-dimethylaminomethyl)benzene,<br>
tris(N,N-dimethylaminopropyl)triazine,	N,N-dimethylbenzylamine	and<br>
2-propylimidazole.<br>
The content of components acting only as catalysts for the base system (that<br>
is to say those not participating in the structure of the cured size) is generally less<br>
than 5% by weight of the sizing composition, preferably less than 3% and in most<br>
cases around 0.5% by weight.<br><br>
The sizing composition may also include, within the limits indicated above, a<br>
solvent for helping to dissolve certain components of the base system. As<br>
examples of such a solvent, mention may be made of ethyl acetate, N-methyl<br>
pyrrolidone and tetrahydrofuran.<br>
The sizing composition may include one or more components (hereafter<br>
called additives) in addition to the aforementioned components that essentially<br>
participate in the structure of the cured size, and where appropriate to the<br>
catalysts and to the solvent. These additives give the size particular properties<br>
and, when the composite is deposited in two steps, as is preferred, they may be<br>
provided by one or both of the constituent compositions of the size.<br>
The composition according to the invention may include, as additive, at least<br>
one coupling agent for bonding the size to the glass. The coupling agent may be a<br>
component of the base system, in which case it participates in the curing reaction,<br>
or a component acting only as additive.<br>
The proportion of coupling agent(s) is generally between 0 and 30% by<br>
weight of the sizing composition Â«and in most cases is greater than 5% by weight.<br>
Preferably, it is between 10 and 25% of the composition.<br>
The coupling agent is generally chosen from silanes such as<br>
y-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane,	y-acryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
y-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane,	poly(oxyethylene/<br>
oxypropylene)trimethoxysilane,	y-aminopropyltriethoxysilane,<br>
vinyltrimethoxysilane,	phenylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane,<br>
styrylaminoethylaminopropyltrimethoxysilane	or<br>
terbutylcarbamoylpropyltrimethoxysilane, siloxanes, titanates, zirconates and<br>
mixtures of these compounds. Preferably, silanes are chosen.<br>
The composition may include, as additive, at least one textile processing aid<br>
acting essentially as lubricant, and it is in many cases necessary for the<br>
composition to have the functions of a size.<br>
The proportion of textile processing aid is generally between 0 and 30%,<br>
preferably between 3 and 20%, by weight of the composition.<br>
The textile processing aid is generally chosen from optionally alkoxylated<br>
fatty esters, such as decyl laurate, isopropyl palmitate, cetyl palmitate, isopropyl<br>
stearate, isobutyl stearate, trimethylolpropane trioctanoate, trimethylolpropane<br>
tridecanoate, alkyl phenol derivatives, such as ethoxylated nonyl phenol, optionally<br><br>
alkoxylated fatty alcohols, such as methyl-terminated polyethylene glycol laurate<br>
or stearate advantageously containing fewer than 10 oxyethylene units, mixtures<br>
based on mineral oils, and mixtures of these compounds. The processing aids are<br>
preferably free of functional groups liable to act preferentially with isocyanate,<br>
hydroxyl and/or amine functional groups.<br>
The composition according to the invention may be deposited on the glass<br>
filaments in one or more steps.<br>
When they are deposited n one step, all of the curable constituents are<br>
contained in the sizing composit on and it is then imperative to block either the<br>
isocyanate functional groups or the hydroxyl and amine functions} groups so as to<br>
prevent the composition from curing prematurely before it is deposited on the<br>
glass filaments. The preferred solution in this embodiment consists in using<br>
polyisocyanates whose isocyanate reactive functional groups are blocked by<br>
protective groups, it being possible for the functional groups to be unblocked by<br>
the addition of an unblocking agent. As examples of such polyisocyanates,<br>
mention may be made of derivatives of TDI, HDI. IPDI, and MDI (for example sold<br>
by Baxenden under the references Bl 7673. Bl 7772. Bl 7950, Bl 7962, Bl 7983.<br>
Bl 7960, which may be unblocked oy 3,5-dimethyipyrazole).<br>
The composition according to the invention is preferably deposited in several<br>
steps, for example under the conditions of the process described in<br>
FR-A-2 763 328. In that process, molten glass streams flowing out of orifices<br>
placed at the base of one or more bushings are drawn into the form of one or more<br>
sheets of continuous filaments and then the filaments are brought together as one<br>
or more strands that are collected on one or more moving supports. The size is<br>
deposited by applying to the filaments a first stable composition of viscosity<br>
between 0.5 and 300 mPa.s and at least one second stable composition of<br>
viscosity between 0.5 and 250 mPa.s, supplied separately from the first<br>
composition.<br>
The second composition may be deposited on the filaments as soon as<br>
possible after the first composition has been deposited or on the strands as late as<br>
possible during their collection on the supports. The difference in viscosity<br>
between the compositions is generally less than 150 mPa.s.<br>
The composition according to be invention is preferably applied in two steps,<br>
the first composition preferably comprising the polyisocyanate component(s) and<br><br>
optionally one or more additives, and the second composition comprising the<br>
hydroxyl component(s) and/or the amine components) and optionally one or more<br>
additives, especially the curing catalyst or catalysts.<br>
Deposition of the size in two steps is particularly advantageous. It allows<br>
better control of the curing reaclions and consequently the size has a uniform<br>
quality over the entire length of the strands, while ensuring a high productivity with<br>
less risk of the strands breaking.<br>
As a general rule, the size deposited on the strand requires no additional<br>
supply of energy for it to cure. However, it is possible to subject the strand, after<br>
fiberizing, to a heat treatment at various stages in the process for the purpose of<br>
accelerating the curing reaction. This treatment may be applied to strands<br>
collected in the form of a package, to sheets of continuous or chopped strands, or<br>
else to strands in combination with an organic material for producing composites.<br>
As an illustration, for a roving weighing about 20 kg, a treatment at a temperature<br>
of around 120 to 140Â°C for about A hours proves to be satisfactory. For chopped<br>
strands, the treatment time does not exceed around ten minutes at an equivalent<br>
temperature.<br>
The actual integrity of the strands through the binding together of the<br>
constituent filaments that is obtained after the size has cured is particularly<br>
important when the amount of size on the strands is relatively low. The loss on<br>
ignition of the strands coated with the sizing composition according to the<br>
invention does not in fact exceed 3% by weight, preferably 1.5% and<br>
advantageously 0.8% by weight.<br>
The sized strands are generally collected in the form of packages on rotating<br>
supports, such as cakes, rovings and cops. Whatever the state of cure of the size<br>
and the crossing angle, even when the latter is small (less than 1.5Â°), it is easy to<br>
unwind the strands from the packages and handle them. Straight-sided packages<br>
retain their dimensional characteristics over time and undergo no deformation. The<br>
strands may also be used subsequently for producing meshes, fabrics, braids,<br>
tapes, etc.<br>
The strands may also be collected on receiving supports moving in<br>
translation. In particular, they may be thrown, by a member that also serves to<br>
attenuate them, toward the collecting surface moving transversely to the direction<br>
of the thrown strands, for the purpose of obtaining a web of intermingled<br><br>
continuous strands or mat. The strands may also be chopped before collection by<br>
a member serving also to attenuate them.<br>
The presence of polyurethane or poly(urethane-urea) polymers in the size<br>
provides a certain flexibility in the bonding and allows the filaments to be able to<br>
move relative to one another. In this way, the integrity of the glass strands is<br>
improved. The strands coated witn the size according to the invention prove to be<br>
particularly advantageous for producing fabrics or for applications requiring them<br>
to be chopped, such as in the simultaneous spray molding technique. Another<br>
advantage due directly to the presence of the aforementioned polymers is that the<br>
strands have a better impact strength than other sized strands, while remaining<br>
compatible with many of the thermoplastics to be reinforced.<br>
The sized glass strand according to the invention is noteworthy in that it can<br>
be treated so as to increase its volume and obtain what is commonly called a<br>
"bulked" strand. The treatment consists in making the strand pass through a<br>
system comprising one or more nozzles through which a flow of air passes, then in<br>
collecting the strand in the form of a package on a suitable device. This strand can<br>
then be woven in particular to form wall fabrics to be painted.<br>
The glass filaments constituting these strands have a diameter that can vary<br>
widely, usually from 5 to 30 urn. They may be made of any glass whatsoever, the<br>
most common in the field of reinforcing strands being E-glass and AR-glass.<br>
The strands obtained according to the invention may advantageously be<br>
used to reinforce various materials for the purpose of obtaining composites having<br>
high mechanical properties. The composites are obtained by combining at least<br>
the glass strands according to the invention with at least one organic and/or<br>
inorganic material, the glass content in the final composite generally varying from<br>
1 to 5% by weight (cementicious matrix) and from 20 to 80%, preferably 30 to<br>
70%, by weight (organic matrix).<br>
The examples that follow allow the invention to be illustrated without,<br>
however, limiting it. In these examples, the following analytical methods are used<br>
for measuring the physical properties.<br>
In the case of sizing compositions:<br>
- the viscosity is measured by means of a SOFRASER MIVI 4000<br>
apparatus sold by Sofraser It is expressed in mPa.s;<br><br>
-	the gel time, expressed in minutes, is measured on the mixture of<br>
compositions A and B by means of a TROMBOMAT device (sold by<br>
Prodemat S.A.), which plots the curve of the viscosity of the sizing<br>
composition as a function of time. On this curve, the point of intersection<br>
of the tangent at the point of inflexion and the x-axis corresponds to the<br>
gel time.<br>
In the case of strands coated with the sizing composition according to the<br>
invention:<br>
-	the loss on ignition is measured according to the ISO 1887 standard. It is<br>
expressed in %;<br>
-	the amount of fuzz allows the abrasion resistance of a strand to be<br>
assessed. It is measured by weighing the amount of material that<br>
becomes detached from the strand after it passes over a series of eight<br>
ceramic cylindrical turn rolls arranged in such a way that the angle of<br>
deflection of the strand at each turn roll is equal to 90Â°. The amount of<br>
fuzz is given in mg per 1 kg of strand tested;<br>
-	the stiffness or rigidity is measured under the conditions defined by the<br>
ISO 3375 standard, on ten specimens before and after undergoing the<br>
abovementioned abrasion resistance test. The stiffness is expressed in<br>
mm and denoted by x(y), x and y that represent the value measured<br>
before and the value measured after the strand passes over the turn rolls,<br>
respectively. The value y allows the integrity of the strand, and indirectly<br>
its ability to be impregnated with a material, more particularly a polymer-<br>
type organic material, to be pre-assessed. In general, a sized strand<br>
whose y value is less than 100 mm, and preferably close to 60 mm (the<br>
lowest value that can be obtained) is used more for applications requiring<br>
good impregnation by the matrix. A strand having an x value greater than<br>
or equal to 120 and a y value of greater than or equal to 100 is suitable<br>
for a use requirinci high strand integrity, for example for weaving, and<br>
optionally in the case of chopping;<br>
-	the tensile strength is measured under the conditions defined by the<br>
ISO 3341 standard. It is expressed in g/tex.<br>
For composites containing glass strands coated with the sizing composition:<br><br>
-	the flexural strength and the flexural modulus are measured under the<br>
conditions defined by the ISO 178 standard, before and after aging by<br>
immersion in water at 100Â°C for 24 hours (polyester resin composites)<br>
and 72 hours (epoxy resin composites). It is expressed in MPa;<br>
-	the shear strength is measured under the conditions defined by the<br>
ISO 4585 standard, before and after aging by immersion in water at<br>
100Â°C for 24 hours (polyester resin composites) and 72 hours (epoxy<br>
resin composites). It is expressed in MPa.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Filaments 13.6 urn in diameter obtained by drawing strands of molten<br>
E-glass flowing from a bushing (800 orifices) were coated with a first composition<br>
A and then with a second composition B (in percentages by weight):<br>
Composition A<br>
â¢	triisocyanate(1)	35<br>
â¢	Y-methacryloxypropyltrimethoxysilane(2&gt;	10<br>
â¢	y-glycidoxypropyltrimethoxysilane(3)	10<br>
â¢	isopropyl palmitate	5<br>
Composition B<br>
â¢	1,5-pentanediol	15<br>
â¢	3-dimethylamino-1-propanol	11.5<br>
â¢	polyethyleneglycol isostearate(4)	13<br>
â¢	1,4-diazabicyclo[2.2.2]octane	0.5<br>
Compositions A and B had a viscosity of 49 mPa.s (at 21 Â°C) and 58 mPa.s<br>
(at 22.5Â°C), respectively.<br>
Parallel with the sizing of the filaments, a mixture containing equal parts of<br>
compositions A and B was produced. The mixture had a viscosity of 1000 Pa.s<br>
after one hour and a gel time cf 21 minutes.<br>
The ratios r and r1 of the sizing composition had the same value: 0.487.<br>
The filaments were brought together to form a strand that was wound on a<br>
rotating support so as to obtain a direct roving of 14 kg. The strand had a linear<br>
density of 297 tex and a loss on ignition of 0.65%.<br>
This strand had a tensile strength equal to 38.7 g/tex, a stiffness equal to<br>
162 mm (122 mm) and an amount of fuzz equal to 8 mg.<br><br>
From the strand thus obtained, two series of composite panels having<br>
parallel strands were produced according to the ISO 9291 standard using two<br>
different resins. The first resin was an epoxy resin consisting of 100 parts by<br>
weight of epoxy resin(5), 90 parts by weight of phthalic anhydride'(6) and 0.5 parts<br>
by weight of tertiary amine(7). The second resin was an unsaturated polyester resin<br>
consisting of 100 parts by weight of isophthalic polyester(8) and 1.5 parts by weight<br>
of peroxide(9).<br>
The values of the mechanical properties of these composites are given<br>
below:<br>
Epoxy resin Polyester resin<br>
Flexural strength (MPa)<br>
Before treatment	2555.6	2738.4<br>
After treatment	2039.9	1718.2<br>
Flexural modulus (MPa)<br>
Before treatment	39982	37051<br>
After treatment	37957	35339<br>
Shear strength (MPa)<br>
Before treatment	67.3	45.4<br>
After treatment	47.3	25.8<br>
Although the abovementioned mechanical properties are inferior to those<br>
that may be obtained with known aqueous sizing compositions especially suitable<br>
for epoxy or polyester resins, they are, however, significant. Their level of<br>
performance is average, comparable to that of most current strands, and in any<br>
case it remained satisfactory for the applications envisioned here.<br>

compositions A and B was produced. The mixture had a viscosity of 60 Pa.s after<br>
1 hour and a gel time of 26 minutes.<br>
A strand of 287 tex linear density was formed and collected on a series of<br>
bobbins. This strand underwent a "bulking" treatment under the following<br>
conditions: the strands extracted from two bobbins were brought together and<br>
made to pass in succession over a first drawing godet (speed: 220 m/min),<br>
through a nozzle (inlet and outlet diameters of 0.7 and 2.2 mm, respectively; air<br>
pressure: 6-6.5 bar), over a second draw godet (speed: 183.5 m/min) and finally<br>
over a winding device (pressure: ?..5 bar).<br>
The strand obtained had a linear density of 640 tex, a stiffness before the<br>
turn roll of 110 mm, a loss on ignition of 0.21% and it left no visible sticky deposit.<br>
The strand obtained had sufficient tensile strength to be able to be woven.<br>

and possessed good impregnabability by polyvinyl acetate (loss on ignition about<br>
17%). It could be used as cloth to be painted.<br>

easily chopped. Its ability to be impregnated with a polyester resin was evaluated<br>
to be 1, measured visually on a scale ranging from 0 (poor; absence of wetting) to<br>
