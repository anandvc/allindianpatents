The following test examples will demonstrate that the present compounds are useful as active ingredients of herbicides. The present compounds are designated by their compound numbers shown in Tables I to 5.<br>
The herbicidal activity and phytotoxicity were evaluated at 6 levels with indices of 0 to 5, i.e., designated by the numeral "0", "1", "2", "3", "4" or "5", wherein "0" means that there was no or little difference in the degree of germination or growth between the treated and the untreated test plants at the time of examination, and "5" means that the test plants died complete or their germination or growth was completely inhibited. The herbicidal activity is excellent when rated at "4" or "5" but insufficient when rated at "3" or lower. The phytotoxicity is no problematic on practical use when rated at "0" or "1" but not allowed when rated at "2" or higher.<br>
Test Example 1: Foliar treatment on upland fields<br>
Cylindrical plastic pots of 10 cm in diameter and 10 cm in depth were filled with soil, in which the seeds of entireleaf morningglory (Ipomoea hederacea var. integriuscula) and velvetieaf {Abutilon theophrasti) were sowed, and the test plants were grown in a greenhouse for 19 days. Each of the test compounds listed below was formulated into an emulsifiable concentrate according to Formulation Example 2, which was diluted with water containing a spreading agent to a prescribed concentration. The dilution was uniformly sprayed over the foliage of the test plants with a sprayer at a volume of 1000 liters per hectare. After the application, the test plants were grown in the greenhouse for 19 days, and the herbicidal activity was examined. The results are shown in Table 6.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
