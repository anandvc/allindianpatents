				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
ACTIVE ENERGY RAY-CURABLE INK COMPOSITION AND PRINTED MATTER<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to an active energy ray-<br>
curable ink composition used for printing on a substrate<br>
such as paper, plastic sheets and the like by using an<br>
offset printing machine.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
An active energy ray-curable ink has been characterized<br>
as an ink exhibiting excellent environment friendly printing<br>
and excellent printing efficiency as well as providing<br>
printed matter of a high quality since the ink is of<br>
solvent-free type and is cured and dried instantly by<br>
radiation of active energy rays. Accordingly, such an<br>
active energy ray-curable ink has been developed for use in<br>
a variety of printing methods such as offset printing,<br>
screen printing, flexographic printing, and/or inkjet<br>
printing (for example, please refer to Patent Document 1).<br>
The active energy ray-curable ink is generally obtained<br>
by mixing a dry pigment with a radical polymerizable varnish,<br>
a radical polymerizable monomer, a photopolymerization<br>
initiator and the like, followed by kneading and dispersion<br>
by using a roll mill or the like. However, there has been<br>
problems such that the method might cause gelatinization<br><br>
when the radical polymerizable varnish and/or the radical<br>
polymerizable monomer are kneaded and dispersed by a roll<br>
mill under a strong shearing force, and that it normally<br>
takes more than 24 hours for dispersion by a roll mill.<br>
Moreover, even though such a long time has been spent<br>
on preparation, pigment dispersibility is poor and<br>
printability is occasionally poor when the obtained ink is<br>
utilized in offset printing.<br>
As a method for obtaining an active energy ray-curable<br>
ink without using roll mills, an active energy ray-curable<br>
ink using a dispersed element of pigment obtained by<br>
dispersing a pigment in a radical polymerizable varnish<br>
using a flushing method has been known (for example, please<br>
refer to Patent Reference 2). However, this method requires<br>
a special varnish in which a value of n-hexane tolerance is<br>
adjusted to be 4 or more.<br>

[Patent Document 2] Japanese Unexamined Patent Application,<br>
First Publication No. 2003-342514<br>
DISCLOSURE OF INVENTION<br>
[PROBLEMS TO BE SOLVED]<br>
The present invention is intended to solve the above<br>
problems and to provide an active energy ray-curable ink<br>
which is dispersed easily and which has excellent color<br>
density and gloss, as well as exhibiting excellent<br><br>
printability when utilized in offset printing.<br>
[MEANS TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS]<br>
The present inventors have found that an active energy<br>
ray-curable composition using a coloring agent to which<br>
specific treatments have been applied can be dispersed<br>
without a strong shearing force being applied thereto by<br>
roll mills or the like, and that the composition has an<br>
excellent printability especially as an offset ink.<br>
That is, the present invention provides an active<br>
energy ray-curable ink composition which comprises a<br>
coloring agent, a binder resin, and a radically<br>
polymerizable varnish and/or a radically polymerizable<br>
monomer as main components, wherein the coloring agent is a<br>
modified pigment wherein the surface of a pigment (A) is<br>
provided with a polymer (P) which is obtained by<br>
polymerizing a polymer (B), which is soluble in nonaqueous<br>
solvents, with at least one kind of polymerizable<br>
unsaturated monomer (C), which is originally soluble in a<br>
nonaqueous solvents but becomes insoluble or poorly soluble<br>
after polymerization.<br>
Also disclosed by the present invention is an active<br>
energy ray-curable ink composition which comprises a<br>
coloring agent, a binder resin, and a radically<br>
polymerizable varnish and/or a radically polymerizable<br>
monomer as main components, wherein the coloring agent is a<br>
modified pigment obtained by polymerizing at least one kind<br>
of polymerizable unsaturated monomer (C) which is originally<br><br>
soluble in the nonaqueous solvents but becomes insoluble or<br>
poorly soluble after polymerization, in the existence of.a<br>
pigment (A) and a polymer (B) which is soluble in nonaqueous<br>
solvents.<br>
[EFFECTS OF INVENTION]<br>
According to the present invention, such an active<br>
energy ray-curable ink can be obtained that is easily<br>
dispersed and exhibits excellent color density and gloss in<br>
the resultant ink, as well as that shows an excellent<br>
printability upon offset printing. Since the modified<br>
pigment used in the present invention can be dispersed<br>
easily, inks can easily be prepared by using a planetary<br>
mixer.<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
(Coloring Agent)<br>
The coloring agent used in the present invention is a<br>
modified pigment obtained in the existence of a pigment (A)<br>
and a polymer (B), which is soluble in nonaqueous solvents,<br>
by polymerizing at least one kind of a polymerizable<br>
unsaturated monomer (C), which is originally soluble in the<br>
nonaqueous solvents but becomes insoluble or poorly soluble<br>
after polymerization. To be more precise, the coloring<br>
agent is a modified pigment wherein the surface of the<br>
pigment (A) is provided with a polymer (P) which is obtained<br>
by polymerizing the polymer (B), which is soluble in<br>
nonaqueous solvents, with at least one kind of polymerizable<br><br>
unsaturated monomer (C), which is originally soluble in<br>
nonaqueous solvents but becomes insoluble or poorly soluble<br>
after polymerization.<br>
The polymer (P) is used as a generic name of polymer<br>
which finally coats the modified pigment. To be more<br>
precise, the polymer (P) refers generically to the resultant<br>
polymers of the polymer (B) and polymerizable unsaturated<br>
monomer (C).<br>

(Nonaqueous Solvents)<br>
The nonaqueous solvents used in the present invention<br>
are organic solvents in which aliphatic and/or alicyclic<br>
hydrocarbonic solvents are essentially included. Examples<br>
of the aliphatic and/or alicyclic hydrocarbon solvents<br>
include n-hexane, n-heptane, "LAWS" or "Mineral Split EC<br>
manufactured by Shell Chemicals, "Isopar C", "Isopar E",<br>
"Isopar G", "Isopar H", "Isopar L", "Isopar M", "Naphtha No.<br>
3", "Naphtha No. 5", or "Naphtha No. 6" manufactured by<br>
Exxon Mobile Chemical, "Solvent No. 7", "IP Solvent 1016",<br>

manufactured by Idemitsu Petrochemical Co., Ltd., "White<br>
Zol" manufactured by Japan Energy Corporation, "Marukazol 8"<br>
manufactured by Maruzen Petrochemical Co., Ltd. and the like.<br>
Further, within the extent that effects of the present<br>
invention are maintained, other organic solvents may also be<br>
admixed to be used. For such organic solvents, aromatic<br>
hydrocarbons solvents such as "Swasol 100 or 150"<br>
manufactured by Maruzen Petrochemical Co. Ltd., toluene,<br>
xylene or the like; esters such as methyl acetate, ethyl<br><br>
acetate, n-butyl acetate, amyl acetate or the like; ketones<br>
such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone,<br>
methyl amyl kethone, cyclohexanone or the like; or alcohols<br>
such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, i-propanol, n-butanol<br>
or the like may be listed, as concrete examples. When these<br>
solvents are used In combination, the amount of the<br>
aliphatic and/or alicyclic hydrocarbonic solvent used is<br>
preferably 50% by mass or more, and more preferably 60% by<br>
mass or more.<br>
(Polymer (B) Soluble in Nonaqueous Solvents)<br>
The polymer (B) which is soluble in the nonaqueous<br>
solvents used in the present invention preferably has said<br>
polymerizable unsaturated group since the polymer (B) is<br>
able to be polymerized or crosslinked with polymerizable<br>
unsaturated monomer (C) described later. For such polymers,<br>
acrylic resin (B-l) containing a polymerizable unsaturated<br>
group and an alkyd resin (B-2) soluble in nonaqueous<br>
solvents may be listed. Acrylic resin (B-l) containing a<br>
polymerizable unsaturated group and alkyd resin (B-2)<br>
soluble in nonaqueous solvents will be described in detail<br>
as follows as preferable embodiments of the polymer (B)<br>
soluble in the nonaqueous solvents.<br>
(Acrylic Resin (B-l) Containing Polymerizable Unsaturated<br>
Group Soluble in Nonaqueous Solvents)<br>
To be precise, the acrylic resin (B-l) containing<br>
polymerizable unsaturated group soluble in the nonaqueous<br>
solvents used in the present invention refers to a polymer<br><br>
which is formed by introducing a polymerizable unsaturated<br>
group to a copolymer of polymerizable unsaturated monomers<br>
which have, as a main component, alkyl ' (meth)acrylate having<br>
an alkyl group which has four or more carbon atoms, or refer<br>
to a macromonomer including a copolymer of polymerizable<br>
unsaturated monomers which have, as a main component, alkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate having an alkyl group which has four or more<br>
carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of the alkyl (meth)acrylate having an alkyl<br>
group which has four or more carbon atoms include n-butyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, i-butyl (meth)acrylate, t-butyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, lauryl<br>
(meth)acrylate, stearyl (meth)acrylate, isostearyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl (meth)acrylate and the like.<br>
Examples of usable polymerizable unsaturated monomers<br>
other than alkyl (meth)acrylate include aromatic vinyl<br>
monomers such as styrene, alpha-methylstyrene, p-t-<br>
butylstyrene, vinyl toluene or the like; (meth)acrylates<br>
such as benzyl (meth)acrylate, dimethylamino (meth)acrylate,<br>
diethylamino (meth)acrylate, dibromopropyl (meth)acrylate,<br>
tribromophenyl (meth)acrylate or the like; diesters derived<br>
from monovalent alcohol and unsaturated dicarboxylic acid<br>
such as maleic acid, fumaric acid, itaconic acid or the<br>
like; vinyl esters such as vinyl benzoic acid, "VeoVa" (a<br>
vinyl ester product of Shell Chemicals, Ltd., the<br>
Netherlands) or the like, and these may be used by being<br>
copolymerized with the aforementioned alkyl (meth)acrylates.<br><br>
Monopolymer of these usable polymerizable unsaturated<br>
monomers other than alkyl (meth)acrylate has a low<br>
solubility in the nonaqueous solvents, so that it is<br>
preferable to be used as a random polymer with the alkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate. It is not preferable to use these monomers<br>
by copolymerizing them in block form or in graft form since<br>
block and graft copolymerization considerably lowers the<br>
solubility in the nonaqueous solvents.<br>
These polymerizable unsaturated monomers may be used<br>
alone or in combination of two or more kinds. Among them,<br>
it is especially preferable to use a straight chain or a<br>
branched alkyl (meth)acrylate having an alkyl group which<br>
has 4 to 12 carbon atoms such as n-butyl (meth)acrylate, 2-<br>
ethylhexyl (meth)acrylate, lauryl methacrylate and the like.<br>
A copolymer of polymerizable unsaturated monomers which<br>
have, as a main component, alkyl (meth)acrylate having an<br>
alkyl group, which has four or more carbon atoms, may be<br>
obtained by polymerizing the aforementioned polymerizable<br>
unsaturated monomers by common methods.<br>
The acrylic resin (B-l) containing polymerizable<br>
unsaturated group may be obtained by introducing a<br>
polymerizable unsaturated group to the aforementioned<br>
copolymer of polymerizable unsaturated monomers which have,<br>
as a main component, alkyl (meth)acrylate having an alkyl<br>
group which has four or more carbon atoms.<br>
Examples of methods for introducing polymerizable<br>
unsaturated group include: a method in which polymerizable<br><br>
monomers containing a carboxyl group such as acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid and the like, and polymerizable monomers<br>
containing an amino group such as dimethylaminoethyl<br>
methacrylate, dimethylaminopropyl acrylamide and the like,<br>
are admixed in advance as copolymerizing elements and are<br>
copolymerized, thereby obtaining the aforementioned<br>
copolymer containing a carboxyl group and/or an amino group,<br>
and then the carboxyl group and/or the amino group thereof<br>
are subjected to react with monomers containing a glycidyl<br>
group and a polymerizable unsaturated group such as glycidyl<br>
methacrylate and the like;<br>
a method in which polymerizable monomers containing<br>
hydroxyl group such as 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate, 2-<br>
hydroxyethyl acrylate and the like are admixed in advance as<br>
copolymerizing elements and are copolymerized to thereby<br>
obtain the aforementioned copolymer containing a hydroxyl<br>
group, and then the hydroxyl group thereof is subjected to<br>
react with monomers containing an isocyanate group and a<br>
polymerizable unsaturated group such as isocyanatoethyl<br>
methacrylate and the like;<br>
a method in which thioglycolic acid is used in<br>
apolymerization as a chain transfer agent so as to introduce<br>
a carboxyl group to the chain-end of the copolymer, and then<br>
the carboxyl group is subjected to react with monomers<br>
containing a glycidyl group and a polymerizable unsaturated<br>
group such as glycidyl methacrylate and the like; and<br>
a method in which azo initiator containing a carboxyl<br><br>
group such as azobis cyanopentanoic acid is used as a<br>
polymerization initiator so as to introduce a carboxyl group<br>
to copolymers, and then the carboxyl group is subjected to<br>
react with monomers containing a glycidyl group and a<br>
polymerizable unsaturated group such as glycidyl<br>
methacrylate and the like. Among these methods, it is most<br>
simple, easy and preferable to employ the method in which<br>
monomers containing a carboxyl group such as acrylic acid,<br>
methacrylic acid and the like, or monomers containing an<br>
amino group such as dimethylaminoethyl methacrylate,<br>
dimethylaminopropyl acrylamide and the like, are<br>
copolymerized in advance, and then the carboxyl group and/or<br>
the amino group thereof are subjected to react with monomers<br>
containing a glycidyl group and a polymerizable unsaturated<br>
group such as glycidyl methacrylate and the like.<br>
(Alkyd Resin (B-2) Soluble in Nonaqueous Solvents)<br>
The alkyd resin (B-2) soluble in the nonaqueous<br>
solvents used in the present invention is a condensate of a<br>
polybasic acid and a polyvalent alcohol modified by a fatty<br>
oil and/or a fatty acid. Acrylics and the like modified by<br>
vinyl, phenol, epoxy ester, silicon and the like are also<br>
known. According to the present invention, it is preferable<br>
to use an alkyd resin containing ample oil constituents<br>
because of its high solubility in nonaqueous solvents, and<br>
the use of a long oil alkyd resin is preferable. Further,<br>
from the viewpoint of reactivity upon polymerization of a<br>
polymerizable unsaturated monomer (C) described later, it is<br><br>
also preferable to use an acrylic modified alkyd resin. In<br>
the following description, a long oil alkyd resin is<br>
referred to as an alkyd resin (B-2-1) and an acrylic<br>
modified alkyd resin as an acrylic modified alkyd resin (B-<br>
2-2) .<br>
(Alkyd Resin (B-2-1))<br>
To be concrete, examples of the alkyd resins (B-2-1)<br>
include those alkyd resins which can be obtained by<br>
conventional method wherein one or two more kinds of acids<br>
and one or two more kinds of alcohols are reacted using one<br>
or two or more kinds of oils or fatty acids. Examples of<br>
the oils and fatty acids include; those selected from the<br>
group consisting of saturated fatty acids such as an octylic<br>
acid, a laurilic acid, a stearic acid, "Versatic Acid" (a<br>
synthetic fatty acid manufactured by Shell) or the like,<br>
unsaturated fatty acids such as an oleic acid, a linolic<br>
acid, a linolenic acid, an eleostearic acid, a ricinolic<br>
acid, or the like, drying (or half-dry) oils (fatty acids)<br>
such as "Pamolyn 200 or 300" (a synthetic drying oil fatty<br>
acid manufactured by Hercules Inc., U.S.A.), Chinese wood<br>

unsaturated monomer in the presence of the above-described<br>
alkyd resin (B-2-1), or the resultant matter of an acrylic<br>
polymer grafting onto an alkyd resin by addition reaction or<br>
the like. For the polymerizable unsaturated monomers<br>
polymerized in this case, it is especially preferable, in<br>
view of high solubility in the nonaqueous solvents, to use<br>
an alkyl (meth)acrylate having an alkyl group which has four<br>
or more carbon atoms, such as n-butyl (meth)acrylate, i-<br>
butyl (meth)acrylate, t-butyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, lauryl (meth)acrylate, stearyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, isostearyl (meth)acrylate, cyclohexyl<br>
(meth)acrylate and the like. The polymerizable unsaturated<br>
monomers may be used alone or in combination of two or more<br>
kinds. Among them, a straight chain or a branched alkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate having an alkyl group which has 4 to 12<br>
carbon atoms such as n-butyl (meth)acrylate, 2-ethylhexyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, lauryl methacrylate and the like is<br>
especially preferable.<br><br>

nonaqueous solvents is not lowered, aromatic vinyl monomers<br>
such as styrene, alpha-methylstyrene, p-t-butylstyrene,<br>

product of Shell, the Netherlands) or the like, may be<br>
properly used by being copolymerized with the aforementioned<br>

Furthermore, for the acrylic resin to be grafted onto<br>
the alkyd resin (B-2-1), copolymer of polymerizable<br>
unsaturated monomers having, as a main component, alkyl<br>
(meth)acrylate, which has an alkyl group having four or more<br>
carbon atoms and which may produce the aforementioned<br>
polymerizable unsaturated monomers as main components, may<br>
be used preferably in the view of high solubility to the<br>

Among these, alkyl (meth)acrylates having C3 (3 carbon<br>

in order to change the surface properties of pigments so as<br>
to improve the interaction with a dispersing agent or<br>

containing at least one kind of functional groups such as a<br>
carboxyl group, a sulfonic acid group, a phosphoric acid<br><br>
group, a hydroxyl group, a dimethylamino group or the like<br>
are preferably copolymerized.<br>
Moreover, in order not to elute the polymer from the<br>
pigments when modified pigments are used, it is more<br>
preferable that the polymer be crosslinked. For the<br>
multifunctional polymerizable unsaturated monomers used as<br>
crosslinking components, divinylbenzene, ethylene glycol<br>
di(meth)acrylate, diethylene glycol di(meth)acrylate,<br>

Further, other polymerizable unsaturated monomers may<br>
also be used within the extent that the polymer having at<br>
least one kind of, as essential components, the<br>
polymerizable unsaturated monomers (C) originally soluble in<br>
the nonaqueous solvent but become insoluble or poorly<br>
soluble after polymerization is kept insoluble in the<br>
nonaqueous solvents. For the other polymerizable<br>
unsaturated monomers, polymerizable unsaturated monomers<br>
besides the aforementioned alkyl (meth)acrylate having an<br>
alkyl group which has four or more carbon atoms and the<br><br>
above-described alkyl (meth)acrylate may be used.<br>
The modified pigments used in the present invention are<br>
obtained by being polymerized in the presence of the pigment<br>
(A), the nonaqueous solvents, and the polymer (B) with at<br>
least one kind of the polymerizable unsaturated monomer (C)<br>
which is soluble in the nonaqueous solvents but becomes<br>
insoluble or poorly soluble after polymerization. The<br>
pigment (A) and the polymer (B) are preferably mixed before<br>
polymerization is carried out. Examples of mixing methods<br>
which can be used include a homogenizer, a dispersion mixer,<br>
a beads mill, a paint shaker, a kneader, a roll mill, a ball<br>
mill, an attoritor, a sand mill and the like. According to<br>
the present invention, pigments to be used can be in any<br>
forms of a slurry, a wet cake or a powder. That is,<br>
according to the manufacturing method of the present<br>
invention, a moisture-containing pigment such as a wet cake<br>
can be used.<br>
After mixing the pigment (A) and the polymer (B), the<br>
polymerizable unsaturated monomer (C) and a polymerization<br>
initiator which will be described later are further admixed<br>
to be polymerized to thereby obtain the modified pigment.<br>
Although on that occasion, the amount used of the<br>
polymer (B) is not particularly limited as it is properly<br>
optimized according to the purposes, 1 to 200 parts of the<br>
polymer (B) per 100 parts of the pigment (A) is generally<br>
used, and preferably from 5 to 50 parts, and more preferably<br>
from 5 to 30 parts may be used.<br><br>
Moreover, although the amount of the polymerizable<br>
unsaturated monomer (C) used is also not particularly<br>
limited as it is properly optimized according to the<br>
purposes, 1 to 200 parts of the monomer (C) per 100 parts of<br>
the pigment (A) is generally used, and preferably from 5 to<br>
50 parts, and more preferably from 5 to 30 parts may be used.<br>
The amount of the polymer (P) finally coated on the<br>
pigment is preferably from 2 to 400 parts per 100 parts of<br>
the pigment (A), and more preferably from 10 to 100 parts,<br>
and most preferably from 10 to 60 parts. On that occasion,<br>
at least one kind of the polymerizable unsaturated monomer<br>
(C) is generally used in a range of 10 to 400 parts per 100<br>
parts of the polymer (B), and preferably in a range of 30 to<br>
400 parts, and more preferably in a range of 50 to 200 parts.<br>
For polymerizing the polymerizable unsaturated monomer<br>
(C) in the presence of the pigment (A), the nonaqueous<br>
solvents, and the polymer (B), publicly known and widely<br>
employed methods for polymerization may be employed, and<br>
generally carried out in the presence of a polymerization<br>
initiator. As the polymerization initiator, a radical<br>
generating polymerization catalyst such as<br>
azobisisobutyronitrile (AIBN), 2,2-azobis(2-<br>
methylbutyronitrile), benzoyl peroxide, t-butyl perbenzoates,<br>
t-butyl-2-ethylhexanoate, t-butyl hydroperoxide, di-t-butyl<br>
peroxide, cumene hydroperoxide, or the like may be used<br>
alone or in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
Since there are polymerization initiators which are not<br><br>
easily soluble In the nonaqueous solvents, methods In which<br>
the initiator is first dissolved in the polymerizable<br>
unsaturated monomer (C) and then added to the mixture of the<br>
pigment (A) and the polymer (B) are preferably employed.<br>
Also, while the polymerizable unsaturated monomer (C)<br>
or the polymerizable unsaturated monomer (C) in which the<br>
polymerization initiator is dissolved can be added by using<br>
a dropping technique with the monomer reaching the<br>
polymerization temperature, the polymerization method in<br>
which the monomer is added in the state of the normal<br>
temperature before the temperature rises and then the<br>
temperature rises after the mixture is fully mixed, is<br>
preferably employed for its stability.<br>
The polymerization temperature is generally in a range<br>
of 60oC to 130oC. In the case where the pigment (A) is an<br>
organic pigment, if the polymerization temperature is too<br>
high, changes in form such as decomposition of the pigment<br>
or crystal growth might be remarkable, so that it is<br>
preferable to be polymerized in a range of 70 to 100oC in<br>
that case.<br>
After polymerization, the nonaqueous solvents or the<br>
like used in polymerization are removed by filteration, and<br>
the resultant substance is further dried and ground to<br>
thereby obtain modified pigments in a powdery form. For the<br>
filtering methods, a Nutsche filter, a filter press and the<br>
like can be used. For drying, publicly known drying<br>
apparatuses such as a chamber dryer, a vacuum dryer, a band<br><br>
dryer, a spray dryer or the like can be used. Moreover, for<br>
kneading, publicly known milling apparatuses such as a<br>
mortar, a hammer mill, a disc mill, a pin mill, a jet mill<br>
or the like can be used.<br>
(Coloring Agent: Blending Amount)<br>
While the blending amount of the modified pigment used<br>
in the present invention is not particularly limited, 3 to<br>
70% by mass, converted to pigment concentration, is<br>
generally added based on ink solid content concentration.<br>
Further, within the extent that effects of the present<br>
invention are maintained, general-purpose pigments can be<br>
admixed to be used.<br>
The active energy ray-curable ink using modified<br>
pigments according to the present invention has such a<br>
characteristic that the ink can achieve a higher color<br>
density compared with an ink using a pigment of the similar<br>
kind even though the ink has the same blending amount.<br>
(Binder Resin)<br>
The active energy ray-curable ink of the present<br>
invention is not particularly limited except the use of the<br>
modified pigment, so that it can be prepared by publicly<br>
known materials. To be more precise, besides the above-<br>
described modified pigment, a binder resin, a radically<br>
polymerizable varnish and/or a radically polymerizable<br>
monomer are contained as main components. When an<br>
ultraviolet ray or infrared ray is used as an active energy<br>
ray, a photopolymerization initiator is preferably used in<br><br>
combination.<br>
As the binder resins, it is not particularly limited as<br>
long as those are the resins for printing ink which can be<br>
dissolved in the radically polymerizable varnish and/or the<br>
radically polymerizable monomer described later. Examples<br>
include oxygen curable alkyd resins, vehicles containing an<br>
oil-modified alkyd or a drying oil and a polymer such as<br>

radical polymerizable monomer used in the present invention,<br><br>

phosphine oxide-bis(2,4,6-trimethylbenzoyl)-phenyl phosphine<br>
oxide or the like. These photopolymerization initiators may<br>
be used alone or in combination of two or more kinds.<br>
While the content of the photopolymerization initiators<br>
is not particularly limited, the initiators are generally<br>
blended in an amount of approximately 2 to 20% by mass.<br>
While the mixing amount of the binder resin, the<br>
radical polymerizable varnish and/or the radical<br>
polymerizable monomer may be suitably decided according to<br>
the purpose and not particularly limited, the binder resin<br>
is generally used in a range of 5 to 50% by mass and the<br>
radical polymerizable varnish and/or the radical<br><br>
polymerizable monomer functioning as crosslinking components<br>
are in a range of 20 to 90% by mass. In the case that the<br>
viscosity and the like are adjusted, it is often adjusted by<br>
changing the amount of the radical polymerizable monomer.<br>
However, it is not limited thereto, and organic solvents may<br>
be added properly. The organic solvents may be anything<br>
that can sufficiently dissolve the aforementioned<br>
composition without damaging the substrate materials, and<br>
the suitable examples include ester solvents such as ethyl<br>
acetate, and aromatic solvents such as toluene or the like.<br>
The amount of the organic solvents used is arbitrary and is<br>
suitably decided according to the respective purposes.<br>
While the viscosity of the active energy ray-curable ink of<br>
the present invention differs according to the method used<br>
to apply the ink, when used in offset printing, for example,<br>
the ink used may generally have a tack value of<br>
approximately 3 to 20.<br>
The active energy ray-curable ink according to the<br>
present invention can be manufactured by blending the<br>
aforementioned components using publicly known dispersers<br>
such as a roll mill, a beads mill, a dispersion mixer, a<br>
homomixer, a colloid mill, a ball mill, an attoritor, a sand<br>
mill, a planetary mixer or the like. Since the ink of the<br>
present invention shows particularly fine dispersibility of<br>
the modified pigments used therein, the ink can be dispersed<br>
without high shearing, and the ink having excellent<br>
dispersibility so as to be easily dispersed even by a<br><br>
disperser such as a planetary mixer or the like, for example,<br>
can be obtained.<br>
The methods of applying the active energy ray-curable<br>
ink of the present invention are not particularly limited,<br>
and publicly known methods such as a.roll coater, a gravure<br>
coater, a flexocoater, an offset printer, a screen printer<br>
or the like may be suitably adopted. Among these methods,<br>
when used in the offset printing, the effect of the ink of<br>
the present invention may be fully achieved due to the<br>
excellent printing property of the ink of the present<br>
invention, and therefore such a printing is preferable.<br>
The substrate materials on which the ink is applied are<br>
not particularly limited, and papers, various kinds of<br>
plastics or the like may be used.<br>
While the active energy rays used in the present<br>
invention refer to ionizing radiations such as ultraviolet<br>
rays, electron ray, X-ray, a-ray, 0 -ray and y -ray,<br>
microwave, high frequency or the like, any type of energy<br>
may be used as long as it can generate radical active<br>
species, and visible rays, infrared rays and laser radiation<br>
may also be used. Examples of ultraviolet rays generator<br>
include an extra-high pressure mercury lamp, a high pressure<br>
mercury lamp, a medium pressure mercury lamp, a low pressure<br>
mercury lamp, a metal halide lamp, a xenon lamp, a carbon<br>
arc lamp, a helium cadmium laser, an YAG laser, an excimer<br>
laser, an argon laser and the like.<br>
Furthermore, as the curing methods by electron rays,<br><br>
the radical polymerization initiator is not necessarily used.<br>
Examples of the usable electron rays include those of a<br>
Cockcroft-Walton type, van de Graaff type, a resonance<br>
transformer type or the like, and electron rays having an<br>
energy in a range of 50 keV to 1000 keV, and preferably in a<br>
range of 100 keV to 300 keV may be used.<br>

of DTMPTA, 0.5 part of hydroquinone, 20 parts of DAP, and 5<br>
parts of Dyecure PI Base were mixed and kneaded by being<br>
passed four times through the rolls of a three roll mill to<br>
thereby obtain an active energy ray-curable ink composition<br>
(H-1).<br><comparative examples to><br>
Active energy ray-curable ink compositions (H-2) to (H-<br>
5) were obtained in the same manner as that in Comparative<br>
Example 1 except that the pigment to be used and the mixing<br>
proportion of ink were changed as shown in Table 3.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
(Evaluation of Pigment Dispersibility)<br>
The obtained ink compositions were applied to a glass<br>
plate by an applicator, and were observed by a microscope (a<br>
product of Keyence Corporation). The dispersibilities of<br>
the ink compositions were also measured by using a grind<br>
meter. "0" in the streak gauge indicates satisfactory<br>
dispersibility. The results are shown in Tables 4 and 5.<br><br>
Since the ink composition obtained in Example 1 had<br>
been kneaded by being passed twice through the three rolls,<br>
the value of streak gauge was "0", indicating an excellent<br>
dispersibility. While Examples 2 to 6 are the examples in<br>
which a planetary mixer was used as the kneading method,<br>
respective resultant values of the streak gauge were "0",<br><br>
indicating a satisfactory dispersibility, and it was<br>
confirmed that the resultant ink compositions could easily<br>
be dissolved. On the other hand, in Comparative Example 1,<br>
a pigment of the same kind as the one used in Example 1 was<br>
used to form an ink without being modified. Although the<br>
ink composition was kneaded by being passed four times<br>
through the three rolls, the value of the streak gauge was<br>
11, so that it was confirmed that the resultant ink<br>
composition had an inferior dispersibility. Further, in<br>
Comparative Example 3, a pigment of the same kind as the<br>
modified pigment (4) used in Example 4 was used to form an<br>
ink without being modified. Although the ink composition<br>
was kneaded by being passed four times through the three<br>
rolls, the value of the streak gauge was 2.5, so that it was<br>
confirmed that the resultant ink composition had an inferior<br>
dispersibility.<br>
(Evaluation of Color Density of Ink Compositions)<br><example><br>
25.4 parts of the modified pigment (1) obtained in<br>
Reference Example 4, 36.3 parts of DPHA, 14 parts of DTMPTA,<br>
0.5 part of hydroquinone, 18.3 parts of DAP, and 5 parts of<br>
Dyecure PI Base were mixed and kneaded by being passed three<br>
times through the rolls of a three roll mill to thereby<br>
obtain an active energy ray-curable ink composition (7).<br>
Printing of the ink composition (7) was performed by<br>
using a simple color printing device (an RI Tester: a<br>
product of Houei Seikou, Co., Ltd.), and was cured by an<br><br>
ultraviolet irradiation device (120W, 1 lamp of metal halide<br>
lamp) to thereby obtain a printed matter (7-1). Printing of<br>
the ink composition (7) was also performed onto a woodfree<br>
paper by using a steel spatula, and was cured by an<br>
ultraviolet irradiation device (120W, 1 lamp of metal halide<br>
lamp) to thereby obtain a printed matter (7-2). Respective<br>
densities of cyan (OD values) of the printed matters (7-1)<br>
and (7-2) were measured by SpectroEye (a product of<br>
GretagMacbeth), and the OD value of the printed matter (7-1)<br>
was 2.80 and of the printed matter (7-2) was 2.34. Further,<br>
60 degree gloss of the printed matter (7-1) was measured<br>
with a haze-gloss meter (a product of BYK-Gardner) and the<br>
result was 80.<br><example><br>

Dyecure PI Base were mixed and kneaded by a planetary mixer<br>
for 5 hours to thereby obtain an active energy ray-curable<br>
ink composition (8).<br>
In the same manner as Example 7, printing of the ink<br>
composition (8) was performed onto a wood free paper by<br>
using a steel spatula, and was cured by an ultraviolet<br>
irradiation device (120W, 1 lamp of metal halide lamp) to<br>
thereby obtain a printed matter (8-2). The density of cyan<br>
(OD value) of the printed matter (8-2) was measured by<br>
SpectroEye (a product of GretagMacbeth), and the OD value<br><br>
was 2.00.<br><comparative example><br>
In the same manner as Example 7, printing of the ink<br>
composition (H-1) obtained in Comparative Example 1 was<br>
performed by using a simple printing device (an RI Tester: a<br>
product of Houei Seikou, Co., Ltd.), and was cured by an<br>
ultraviolet irradiation device (120W, 1 lamp of metal halide<br>
lamp) to obtain a printed matter (H-1-1). Then, 60 degree<br>
gloss thereof was measured with a haze-gloss meter (a<br>
product of BYK-Gardner), and the result was 60.<br>
Further, in the same manner as Example 7, printing of<br>
the ink composition (H-l) was also performed onto a woodfree<br>
paper by using a steel spatula, and was cured by an<br>
ultraviolet irradiation device to obtain a printed matter<br>
(H-1-2).<br>
Respective optical densities of cyan (OD values) of the<br>
printed matters (H-1-1) and (H-1-2) were measured by<br>
SpectroEye (a product of GretagMacbeth), and the OD value<br>
was 2.31 and 2.00, respectively.<br>
The results of Examples 7 and 8 and of Comparative<br>
Example 6 are shown in Table 6.<br><br><br>
The ink composition used in Example 7 had the same<br>
concentration of pigments in the ink composition of 22% as<br>
the ink composition used in Comparative Example 6. However,<br>
the printed matters (7-1) and (7-2) obtained in Example 7<br>
showed a positive color difference compared with the printed<br>
matters (H-1-1) and (H-1-2) obtained in Comparative Example<br>
6. That is, in Example 7, printed matters with higher color<br><br>
density than those obtained in Comparative Example 6 were<br>
able to be obtained.<br>
Moreover, the ink composition used in Example 8 shows a<br>
lower concentration of pigments in the ink composition<br>
compared with the ink composition used in Comparative<br>
Example 6 (18% while 22% in the one used in Comparative<br>
Example 6). However, the printed matter (8-2) obtained in<br>
Example 8 shows a color difference of 0 compared with the<br>
printed matter (H-1-2) obtained in Comparative Example 6, so<br>
that it is clear that the printed matters of equivalent<br>
color densities can be obtained.<br><examples to><br>
In the same manner as Example 7, printing of the ink<br>
compositions (3) to (6) obtained in Examples 3 to 6 were<br>

(Printing Property)<br><example><br>
By using the active energy ray-curable ink composition<br>
(8) obtained in Example 8, printing was carried out with a<br>
sheet-fed printer R702 manufactured by Roland Co., which is<br>
equipped with an ultraviolet irradiation device (160W, 3<br>
lamps of metal halide lamp), on 3000 sheets of coat paper<br>
(57.5 Kg/full size paper of A format: a product of Oji Paper<br>
Co., Ltd.) with a printing speed of 9000 sheets/hour to<br>
thereby obtain a printed matter.<br>
Then, the following printing properties were evaluated.<br>
1.	Gloss of the printed matter<br>
2.	Plate remaining<br>
3.	Blanket remaining<br>
4.	Dampening roller remaining<br>
For the gloss of the printed matter, the 20 and 60<br>
degree gloss of the 3000th printed matter were measured with<br>
a haze-gloss meter (a product of BYK-Gardner).<br>
Properties 2. to 4. were evaluated in 4 levels from ©<br>
to X (© excellent; O good; A fair; X bad) . Here,<br>
"remaining" indicates the existence of residual ink adhered<br>
to respective parts of the printer, and respective marks<br>
signify as: © - no ink remains at all; O - hardly no ink<br>
remains; A - a little ink remains; and X - a large amount<br>
of ink remains.<br>
