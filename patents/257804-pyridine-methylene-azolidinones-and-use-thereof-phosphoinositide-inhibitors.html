				<td>Pyridine methylene azolidinones and use thereof<br>
Field of the invention<br>
This present invention is related to the use of pyridine methylene azolidinone derivatives of<br>
Formula (I) for the treatment and/or prophylaxis of autoimmune disorders and/or<br>
inflammatory diseases, cardiovascular diseases, neurodegenerative diseases, bacterial or<br>
viral infections, allergy, asthma, pancreatitis, multi-organe failure, kidney diseases, platelet<br>
aggregation, cancer, sperm motility, graft rejection or lung injuries. Specifically, the present<br>
invention is related to pyridine methylene azolidinone derivatives for the modulation,<br>
notably the inhibition of the activity or function of the phosphoinositide-3-kinases, PBKs.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PISKs) have a critical signalling role in cell proliferation, cell<br>
survival, vascularization, membrane trafficking, glucose transport, neurite outgrowth,<br>
membrane ruffling, superoxide production, actin reorganization and chemotaxis (Cantley,<br>
2000, Science , 296, 1655-1657 and Vcmhaesebroeck et al, 2001, Annu. Rev. Biochem., 70,<br>
The term PI3K is given to a family of lipid kinases which, in mammals, consists in eight<br>
identified PISKs that are divided into three sub-families according to their structure and<br>
their substrate specificity.<br>
Class I group of PBKs consists in two sub-groups, Class IA and Class IB.<br>
Class IA consists in a 85 kDa regulatory unit (responsible for protein-protein interactions<br>
via the interaction of Src homology 2 (SH2) domain with phosphotyrosine residues of other<br>
proteins) and a catalytic sub-unit of H0kDa. Three catalytic forms (plOOa, pi 10(3 and<br>
p1108) and five regulatory isoforms (p85a, p85(3, p55y, p55a and p50a) exist for this<br>
class.<br>
Class IB are stimulated by G protein Py sub-units of heterodimeric G proteins. The only<br>
characterized member of Class IB is PISKy (pi 10y catalytic sub-unit complexed with a<br>
101-kDa regulatory protein, p101).<br>
Class II PDKs comprises a, P and y isoforms, which are approximately of 170 kDa and<br>
characterized by the presence of a C-terminal C2 domain.<br>
Class III PISKs includes the phosphatidylinositol specific 3-kinases.<br>
The evolutionary conserved isoforms pi 10a and (3 are ubiquitously expressed, while 8 and<br>
y are more specifically expressed in the haematopoetic cell system, smooth muscle cells,<br>
myocytes and endothelial cells (Vanhaesebroeck et al, 1997, Trends Biochem Sci., 22(7),<br>
267-72). Their expression might also be regulated in an inducible manner depending on the<br>
cellular-, tissue type and stimuli as well as disease context.<br>
PISKs are enzymes involved in phospholipid signalling and are activated in response to a<br>
variety of extra-cellular signals such as growth factors, mitogens, integrins (cell-cell<br>
interactions) hormones, cytokines, viruses and neurotransmitters and also by intra-cellular<br>
cross regulation by other signalling molecules (cross-talk, where the original signal can<br>
activate some parallel pathways that in a second step transmit signals to PBKs by intracellular<br>
signalling events), such as small GTPases, kinases or phosphatases for example.<br>
Phosphatidylinositol (Ptdlns) is the basic building block for the intracellular inositol lipids<br>
in eukaryotic cells, consisting of D-myo-inositol-1-phosphate (InsIP) linked via its<br>
phosphate group to diacylglycerol. The inositol head group of Ptdlns has five free hydroxy<br>
groups and three of these are found to be phosphorylated in cells in different combinations.<br>
Ptdlns and its phosphorylated derivatives are collectively referred as inositol phospholipids<br>
or phosphoinositides (Pis). Eight PI species have been documented in eukaryotic cells<br>
(Vanhaesebroeck et al., 2001, above). Pis all reside in membranes and are substrates for<br>
kinases, phosphatases and lipases.In vitro, PISKs phosphorylate the 3-hydroxyl group of the inositol ring in three different<br>
substrates: phosphatidylinositol (Ptdlns), phosphatidylinositol-4-phosphate (PI(4)P) and<br>
phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate (PI(4,5)P2), respectively generating three lipid<br>
products, namely phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate (PI(3)P), phosphatidylinositol 3,4-<br>
bisphosphate (PI(3,4)P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PI(3,4,5)P3 (see<br>
Scheme A below).<br>
Inositol ring<br>
Ptdlns (Phosphatidylinositol)<br>
PI(3)P (Phosphatidylinositol 3-monophosphate)<br>
Scheme A<br>
The preferred substrate for Class I PISKs is PI(4,5)P2. Class II PIKs have a strong<br>
prefererence for Ptdlns as substrate over PI(4)P and PI(4,5)P2. Class III PISKs can only use<br>
Ptdlns as substrate in vivo and are likely to be responsible for the generation of most PI(3)P<br>
in cells (Vanhaesebroeck et al, 2001, above).<br>
The phosphoinositides intracellular signalling pathway begins with the binding of a<br>
signalling molecule (extracellular ligands, stimuli, receptor dimerization, transactivation by<br>
heterologous receptor (e.g. receptor tyrosine kinase)) to a G-protein linked transmembrane<br>
receptor integrated into the plasma membrane resulting in the activation of PISKs.<br>
Once activated, PISKs convert the membrane phospholipid PI(4,5)P2 into Pl(3,4,5)p3 which<br>
in turn can be further converted into another 3' phosphorylated form of phosphoinositides<br>
by 5'-specific phosphoinositide phosphatases, thus PI3K enzymatic activity results either<br>
directly or indirectly in the generation of two 3'-phosphoinositide sub-types that function as<br>
second messengers in intra-cellular signal transduction (Leslie et al, 2001, Chem. Rev.<br>
101(8) 2365-80; Katso et al, 2001, Annu. Rev. Cell Dev. Biol 1, 615-75 and Taker et al,<br>
2002, CellMol Life Sci. 59(5) 761-79).<br>
The role as second messengers of phosphorylated products of Ptdlns act is involved in a<br>
variety of signal transduction pathways, including those essential to cell proliferation, cell<br>
differentiation, cell growth, cell size, cell survival, apoptosis, adhesion, cell motility, cell<br>
migration, chemotaxis, invasion, cytoskeletal rearrangement, cell shape changes, vesicle<br>
trafficking and metabolic pathway (Stein, 2000, Mol. Med. Today 6(9) 347-57).<br>
Chemotaxis - the directed movement of cells toward a concentration gradient of chemical<br>
attractants, also called chemokines is involved in many important diseases such as<br>
inflammation/auto-immunity, neurodegeneration, angiogenesis, invasion/metastasis and<br>
wound healing (Wyman et al, 2000, Immunol Today 21(6) 260-4; Hirsch et al, 2000,<br>
Science 287(5455) 1049-53; Hirsch et al, 2001, FASEB J. 15(11) 2019-21 and Gerard et<br>
al, 2001, Nat Immunol 2(2) 108-15).<br>
PI3-kinase activation, is therefore believed to be involved in a range of cellular responses<br>
including cell growth, differentiation and apoptosis (Parker et al, 1995, Current Biology,<br>
5, 577-99; Yao et al, 1995, Science, 267, 2003-05).<br>
Recent biochemical studies revealed that, Class I PDKs (e.g. Class IB isoform PI3Ky) are<br>
dual-specific kinase enzymes, i.e. they display both lipid kinase activity (phosphorylation<br>
of phospho-inositides) as well as protein kinase activity, as they are able to induce the<br>
phosphorylation of other protein as substrates, including auto-phosphorylation as intramolecular<br>
regulatory mechanism.<br>
PISKs appear to be involved in a number of aspects of leukocyte activation. A p85-<br>
associated PI3-kinase activity has been shown to physically associate with the cytoplasmic<br>
domain of CD28, which is an important co-stimulatory molecule for the activation of Tcells<br>
in response to antigen (Pages et al, 1994, Nature, 369, 327-29). These effects are<br>
linked to increases in the transcription of a number of genes including interleukin-2 (IL-2),<br>
an important T cell growth factor (Fraser et al, 1991, Science, 251, 313-16). Mutation of<br>
CD28 such that it can longer interact with PI3-kinase leads to a failure to initiate IL-2<br>
production, suggesting a critical role for PI3-kinase in T cell activation.<br>
Cellular processes in which PI3Ks play an essential role include suppression of apoptosis,<br>
reorganization of the actin skeleton, cardiac myocyte growth, glycogen synthase<br>
stimulation by insulin, TNFa-mediated neutrophil priming and superoxide generation, and<br>
leukocyte migration and adhesion to endothelial cells.<br>
PI3Ky has been identified as a mediator of G beta-gamma-dependent regulation of JNK<br>
activity wherein G beta-gamma are subunits of heterotrimeric G proteins (Lopez-Ilasaca et<br>
al., 1998, J. Biol. Chem. 273(5) 2505-8).<br>
Recently, it has been described that PI3Ky relays inflammatory signals through various<br>
G(i)-coupled receptors (Laffargue et al, 2002, Immunity 16(3) 441-51) and its central to<br>
mast cell function, stimuli in context of leukocytes, immunology includes cytokines,<br>
chemokines, adenosines, antibodies, integrins, aggregation factors, growth factors, viruses<br>
or hormones for example (Lawlor et al, 2001, J. Cell ScL, 114 (Pt 16) 2903-1 and<br>
Stephens et al, 2002, Curr. Opinion Cell Biol. 14(2), 203-13).<br>
Specific inhibitors against individual members of a family of enzymes provide valuable<br>
tools for deciphering functions of each enzyme.<br>
Two compounds, LY294002 and wortmannin (cf.hereinafter), have been widely used as<br>
PI3-kinase inhibitors. These compounds are non-specific PI3K inhibitors, as they do not<br>
distinguish among the four members of Class I PI3-kinases.<br>
LY 294002 Wortmannin<br>
ICso values of wortmannin against each of the various Class I PI3-kinases are in the range<br>
of 1-10 nM and ICso values for LY294002 against each of these PI3-kinases are about 15-<br>
20 uM (Fruman et al., 1998, Ann. Rev. Biochem., 67, 481-507), also 5-10 mM on CK2<br>
protein kinase and some inhibitory activity on phospholipases.<br>
Wortmannin is a fungal metabolite which irreversibly inhibits PI3K activity by binding<br>
covalently to the catalytic domain of this enzyme. Inhibition of PI3K activity by<br>
wortmannin eliminates the subsequent cellular response to the extracellular factor (Thelen<br>
et al, 1994, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA, 91, 4960-64). Experiments with wortmannin, show<br>
that PI3K activity in cells of hematopoietic lineage, particularly neutrophils, monocytes,<br>
and other types of leukocytes, is involved in many of the non-memory immune response<br>
associated with acute and chronic inflammation.<br>
Based on studies using wortmannin, there is evidence that PI3-kinase function is also<br>
required for some aspects of leukocyte signaling through G-protein coupled receptors<br>
(Thelen et al., 1994). Morever, it has been shown that wortmannin and LY294002 block<br>
neutrophil migration and superoxide release. However, in as much as these compounds do<br>
not distinguish among the various isofprms of PI3K, it remains unclear which particular<br>
PI3K isoform or isoforms are involved in these phenomena.<br>
Some results have indicated that PI3K inhibitors, for example, LY294002, can increase thein vivo antitumor activity of certain cytotoxic agents (e.g. paclitaxel) (Grant, 2003, IDrugs,6(10), 946-948).Recently, thiazolidine derivatives have been recently developed as PI3K inhibitors (WO<br>
2004/007491; WO 2004/056820; WO 2004/052373).<br>
WO 2004/007491 discloses azolidinedione-vinyl fused-benzene derivatives of the<br>
following structure:<br>
WO 2004/056820 discloses benzoxazine derivatives of the following structure:<br>
WO 2004/052373 discloses benzoxazin-3-ones derivatives of the following structure:<br>
The high relevance of the PI3K pathway in some widely spread diseases stresses the need<br>
to develop inhibitors, including selective inhibitors, of PIKs.<br>

(i.e. reaction temperatures, time, moles of reagents, solvents etc.) are given, other<br>
10 experimental conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction<br>
conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvents used, but such conditions can<br>

When employed as pharmaceuticals, the compounds of the present invention are typically<br>
15 administered in the form of a pharmaceutical composition. Hence, pharmaceutical<br>
compositions comprising a compound of Formula (I) and a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier, diluent or excipient therefore are also within the scope of the present invention. A<br>
person skilled in the art is aware of a whole variety of such carrier, diluent or excipient<br>
compounds suitable to formulate a pharmaceutical composition.<br>
20 The compounds of the invention, together with a conventionally employed adjuvant,<br>
carrier, diluent or excipient may be placed into the form of pharmaceutical compositions<br>
and unit dosages thereof, and in such form may be employed as solids, such as tablets or<br>
filled capsules, or liquids such as solutions, suspensions, emulsions, elixirs, or capsules<br>
filled with the same, all for oral use, or in the form of sterile injectable solutions for<br>
25 parenteral (including subcutaneous use). Such pharmaceutical compositions and unit<br>
dosage forms thereof may comprise ingredients in conventional proportions, with or<br>
without additional active compounds or principles, and such unit dosage forms may contain<br>
any suitable effective amount of the active ingredient commensurate with the intended daily<br>
dosage range to be employed.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions containing pyridine methylene azolidinone derivatives of this<br>
invention can be prepared in a manner well known in the pharmaceutical art and comprise<br>
at least one active compound. Generally, the compounds of this invention are administered<br>
in a pharmaceutical ly effective amount. The amount of the compound actually administered<br>
5 will typically be determined by a physician, in the light of the relevant circumstances,<br>
including the condition to be treated, the chosen route of administration, the actual<br>
compound administered, the age, weight, and response of the individual patient, the<br>
severity of the patient's symptoms, and the like.<br>
10 The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention can be administered by a variety<br>
of routes including oral, rectal, transdermal, subcutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular and<br>
intranasal. The compositions for oral administration can take the form of bulk liquid<br>
solutions or suspensions, or bulk powders. More commonly, however, the compositions are<br>
presented in unit dosage forms to facilitate accurate dosing. The term "unit dosage forms"<br>
15 refers to physically discrete units suitable as unitary dosages for human subjects and other<br>
mammals, each unit containing a predetermined quantity of active material calculated to<br>
produce the desired therapeutic effect, in association with a suitable pharmaceutical<br>
excipient. Typical unit dosage forms include prefilled, premeasured ampoules or syringes<br>
of the liquid compositions or pills, tablets, capsules or the like in the case of solid<br>
20 compositions. In such compositions, the pyridine methylene azolidinone derivative is<br>
usually a minor component (from about 0.1 to about 50% by weight or preferably from<br>
about 1 to about 40% by weight) with the remainder being various vehicles or carriers and<br>
processing aids helpful for forming the desired dosing form.<br>
25 Liquid forms suitable for oral administration may include a suitable aqueous or nonaqueous<br>
vehicle with buffers, suspending and dispensing agents, colorants, flavors and the like.<br>
Solid forms may include, for example, any of the following ingredients, or compounds of a<br>
similar nature: a binder such as microcrystalline cellulose, gum tragacanth or gelatine; an<br>
excipient such as starch or lactose, a disintegrating agent such as alginic acid, Primogel, or<br>
While this step may be carried out in the absence of a solvent at a temperature, which is<br>
sufficiently high to cause at least partial melting of the reaction mixture, it is preferably<br>
carried out in the presence of an inert solvent. A preferred temperature range is from about<br>
70°C to 250°C, and especially preferred is a temperature of from about 80°C to 120°C.<br>
Examples of such solvents for the above reaction include solvents like dimethoxymethane,<br>
xylene, toluene, o-dichlorobenzene and methanol. Examples of suitable mild bases for the<br>
above reaction are alkali metal and alkaline earth salts of week acids such as the (Ci-C^)-<br>
alkyl carboxylic acids and benzoic acid, alkali metal and alkaline earth carbonates and<br>
bicarbonates such as calcium carbonate, magnesium carbonate, potassium bicarbonate and<br>
secondary amines such as piperidine, morpholine or pyrrolidine as well as tertiary amines<br>
such as pyridine, triethylamine, diisopropylethylamine, N-methylmorpholine, Nethylpiperidine,<br>
N-methylpiperidine and the like. Especially preferred mild bases are<br>
sodium acetate or pyrrolidine for reasons of economy and efficiency.<br>
29<br>
xide; a sweetening agent such as sucrose or saccharin; or a flavoring agent such as peppermint,<br>
methyl salicylate, or orange flavoring.<br>
Injectable compositions are typically based upon injectable sterile saline or phosphate-buffered<br>
saline or other injectable carriers known in the art. As above mentioned, the pyridine<br>
methylene azolidinone derivatives of Formula (I) in such compositions is typically a minor<br>
component, frequently ranging between 0.05 to 10% by weight with the remainder being<br>
the injectable carrier and the like.<br>
The above described components for orally administered or injectable compositions are<br>
merely representative. Further materials as well as processing techniques and the like are<br>
set out in Part 5 of Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, 20th Edition, 2000, Marck<br>
Publishing Company, Easton, Pennsylvania, which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>

The pyridine methylene azolidinone derivatives exemplified in this invention may be<br>
prepared from readily available starting materials using the following general methods and<br>
procedures. It will be appreciated that where typical or preferred experimental conditions<br>
(i.e. reaction temperatures, time, moles of reagents, solvents etc..) are given, other<br>
experimental conditions can also be used unless otherwise stated. Optimum reaction<br>
conditions may vary with the particular reactants or solvents used, but such conditions can<br>
be determined by the person skilled in the art, using routine optimisation procedures.<br>
In the process illustrated in the following schemes R1, R2, A, X, Y and n are each as abovedefined<br>
in the description.<br>
Generally, the pyridine methylene azolidinone derivatives according to the general Formula<br>
(I) could be obtained by several synthetic approaches, using both solution-phase and solidphase<br>
chemistry protocols (Brummond et al, 1999, above), either by conventional methods<br>
or by microwave-assisted techniques.<br>
In a first step, an aldehyde reactant PI (PIa, PIb, Pic, PId) and one to two equivalents of<br>
reactant P2 (in particular thiazolidinedione or rhodanine) are heated in the presence of a<br>
preferably mild base to provide the corresponding olefin of Formula (I) as shown on<br>
31<br>
Scheme 1 below. In the first step, PI may be replaced by precursors PI a, Plb, Pic and Pld<br>
in order to obtain the final compounds (la), (Ib) (Ic) and (Id) respectively as above<br>
described in the description.<br><br>
Particularly preferred processes according to the invention are illustrated by the following<br>
Schemes 2, 3, 4 and 5 in which compounds of formula (la), (Ib), (Ic) and (Id) respectively,<br>
may be obtained using the same reaction conditions as above-mentioned.<br>
In such a typical reaction (Tietze et al, in "The Knoevenagel reaction", p.341 ff.,<br>
Pergamon Press, Oxford 1991, Eds.: Trost B.M., Fleming I.) the aldehyde PI and the other<br>
starting material (e.g. thiazolidinedione) P2 are combined in approximately equimolar<br>
amounts with 0.5 to one equivalent of pyrolidine in methanol or similar solvent and heated<br>
between 70 and 200°C at which the reaction is substantially complete in about 15 minutes<br>
to 3 hours. The desired olefm of Formula (I) is then isolated by filtration, in case it would<br>
have precipitated out of the reaction mixture upon cooling, or for example, by mixing with<br>
water and subsequent filtration, to obtain the crude product. The crude product is purified,<br>
if desired, e.g. by crystallization or by standard chromatographic methods.<br>
Alternatively compounds of Formula (I) may be obtained typically by mixing equimolar<br>
amounts of thiazolidinedione P2 with aldehyde PI with molar excess of anhydrous sodium<br>
acetate and the mixture is heated at a temperature high enough to effect melting, at which<br>
temperature the reaction is mainly complete in about 5 to 60 minutes.<br>
Preferably, the above reaction is carried out in acidic media such as acetic acid in the<br>
presence of sodium acetate or beta-alanine.<br>
More preferably, the above reaction is carried out in methanol using 1.1 to 2.0 equivalents<br>
of thiazolidinedione P2, one equivalent of aldehyde PI and 0.2 to 0.5 equivalents of<br>
pyrrolidine in methanol.<br>
The reactions described above may be carried out alternatively under microwave conditions<br>
as heating source. Typically, the aldehyde starting material PI and thiazolidinedione P2 are<br>
combined in approximately equimolar amounts with 0.5 to one equivalent of piperidine in<br>
dimethoxymethane or similar solvent and heated between 140°C and 240°C at which the<br>
reaction is substantially complete in about 3 to 10 minutes.<br>
The pharmaceutically acceptable cationic salts of compounds of the present invention are<br>
readily prepared by reacting the acid forms with an appropriate base, usually one<br>
34<br>
equivalent, in a co-solvent. Typical bases are sodium hxdroxide, sodium methoxide,<br>
sodium ethoxide, sodium hydride, potassium hydroxide, potassium methoxide, magnesium<br>
hydroxide, calcium hydroxide, benzathine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine,<br>
meglumine, benethamine, diethylamine, piperazine and tromethamine. The salt is isolated<br>
by concentration to dryness or by addition of a non-solvent. In some cases, salts can be<br>
prepared by mixing a solution of the acid with a solution of the cation (sodium<br>
ethylhexanoate, magnesium oleate), employing a solvent in which the desired cationic salt<br>
precipitates, or can be otherwise isolated by concentration and addition of a non-solvent.<br>
2,4-Azolidinone derivatives P2 are commercially available from various sources.<br>
Methods of preparing intermediates of compounds of Formula (I).<br>
The aldehydes of formula PI are prepared by a variety of well known methods, for example<br>
by oxido-reduction starting from the corresponding carboxylic acid alkyl ester or<br>
carboxylic acid.<br>
Standard techniques to reduce carboxylic acid alkyl ester, carboxylic halides or carboxylic<br>
acid to benzylic alcohols use lithium aluminium hydride, diisopropylaluminum, lithium<br>
aluminium tri-tert-butoxyhydride etc.<br>
Ultimately, the corresponding benzylic alcohol is re-oxidized to the corresponding<br>
aldehyde by mild oxidation with reagents such as manganese dioxide, chromic acid, Dess-<br>
Martin reagent or Swern oxidation, or under other conditions known to produce aldehydes<br>
from primary alcohols. An alternative way may be the direct reduction of the corresponding<br>
carboxylic acid alkyl ester or carboxylic acid to the corresponding aldehyde, using DIBAL<br>
at low temperature or any other techniques known in the field.<br>
An alternative way to prepare the appropriate aldehyde PI is the selective reduction of a<br>
nitrile moiety to the corresponding aldehyde using known methods like e.g. DIBAL.<br>
35<br>
Another way to obtain aldehydes of formula PI is the selective reduction of the<br>
corresponding acyl chloride using e.g. lithiumaluminium-tri-tert-butoxyhydride (Cha et al,<br>
1993,J.O.C,58,p.4732-34}.<br>
Another way to synthesize aldehydes PI is to start from the corresponding 2-pyridine<br>
halides, which are submitted to organometallic assisted reaction in order to afford the<br>
corresponding 2-vinyl-pyridines, which ultimately can be oxidized to the corresponding<br>
aldehydes PI using standard oxidation agents for olefinic bonds such as osmium tetroxide,<br>
ruthenium tetroxide, ozone, ruthenium(III)chloride in the presence of sodium periodate and<br>
others known to person skilled in the art.<br>
Another way to obtain the corresponding aldehydes PI is the oxidation of a 2-<br>
methylpyridine using oxidizing agents such as selenium dioxide or benzene seleninic<br>
anhydride.<br>
Acccording to a more particularly preferred process of the invention, as illustrated by<br>
Scheme 6 below, reactant Pla can be obtained starting from a derivative of formula P3a<br>
wherein R is selected from methyl, ethyl or any other group susceptible to reduction known<br>
to the person skilled in the art, by optionally applying a reduction/oxidation sequence using<br>
preferably lithium aluminium hydride in tetrahydofuran, followed by an oxidation step<br>
using preferably manganese dioxide in dichloromethane.<br>
An intermediate that can be used for to above synthesis is methyl 2,4,8-trichloropyrido[3,2-<br>
d]pyrimidine-6-carboxylate (Intermediate 1.3), which synthesis is described in the<br>
literature (Srinivasan et al, 1979, J.O.C, 1979, 44, 3, p.435), as shown in Scheme 7 below.<br>
H<br>
Intermediate 1.2 Intermediate 1.3<br>
The selective replacement of the 3 chloro groups may allow the introduction of R1 and R2<br>
groups leading to different intermediates of formula P3a (P3a(l), P3a(2), P3a(3), P3a(4),<br>
Reductions steps in Scheme 8 can be carried out using standard reducing agents such<br>
hydrogen or Raney-Nickel dithiation (Srinivasan et al, 1979, above).<br>
Preferably, the reduction is conducted under mild conditions using ammonium formate in<br>
the presence of palladium. The amount of ammonium formate is determined by the<br>
numbers of chlorine atoms to be removed (2-12 eq.)-<br>
The introduction of groups R2 and R1 is obtained through standard reaction techniques<br>
known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
Acccording to another particularly preferred process of the invention, as illustrated by<br>
Scheme 9 below, aldehyde Plb can be obtained starting from an intermediate P3b by<br>
oxidative cleavage of an olefinic double bond.<br>
wherein R is selected from H, optionally substituted C\-C^ alkyl, optionally substituted<br>
aryl. In such a reaction the olefmic double bond is cleaved using oxidation agents for<br>
olefinic bonds such as osmium tetroxide, ruthenium tetroxide, ozone,<br>
ruthenium(III)chloride in the presence of sodium periodate and others known to person<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Intermediate P3b can be synthesized starting from 2-halogen pyridine derivatives using<br>
organometallic assisted coupling reactions to introduce a vinyl moiety in standard fashion<br>
known to the person skilled in the art. The corresponding 2-halogen pyridines are readily<br>
accessible from e.g. 2-halogen-4-nitro-6-aminopyridine as depicted in Scheme 10 below,<br>
wherein "Hal" represents a halogen.<br>
Acccording to another particularly preferred process of the invention, as illustrated by<br>
Scheme 11 below, wherein R is selected from H, optionally substituted Cj-Ce alkyl,<br>
optionally substituted aryl, intermediate Pic can be obtained starting from intermediate P3c<br>
by oxidation of 2-methyl pyridines.<br>
Such oxidation can be carried out using selenium dioxide or benzene seleninic anhydride in<br>
an inert solvent at temperatures between 150 to 250°C. Preferably, such a reaction is<br>
carried out using microwave as heating source. In a second step, desilylation is performed<br>
under standard conditions as described in Kocienski, 1994 (above) and Greene et al, 1999<br>
(above).<br>
Preferably the trimethylsilyl group is cleaved using sodium hydroxide from 2 to 5N.<br>
The introduction of R2 may be performed as described in WO2004/007491.<br>
According to another more preferred process, intermediate Pic can be obtained from<br>
intermediate P3c via a picoline N-oxide rearrangement: Typically intermediate P3c is<br>
subjected to N-oxidation leading to intermediate P3', using oxidants like m-Chloroperbenzoic<br>
acid (m-CPBA) at room temperature or any oxidant know to the person skilled<br>
in the art. Subsequent basic work-up and heating P3c' in acetic anhydride at 100°C for 5 to<br>
15 min (Cava et al., 1958, JOC, 23, 1616) leads to the corresponding acetyl protected<br>
alcohol, which in turn can be deprotected and desilylated simultaneously by treatment with<br>
40<br>
sodium hydroxide (2N) in methanol at room temperature. Finally, primary alcohol P3c"<br>
can oxidized to the corresponding aldehyde intermediate Pic using oxidants like<br>
manganese dioxide in dichloromethane or any oxidants known to person skilled in the art<br>
(Scheme 11 above).<br>
Acccording to another particularly preferred process of the invention, where azabenzimidazoles<br>
are represented, Intermediate P4d can be obtained from intermediate PSd,<br>
as depicted in Scheme 12 below, wherein "Hal" represents a halogen.<br>
Substitution of the 2-halogen with R2NH2 in alcohols (e.g. ethanol) in the presence of a<br>
base is followed by reduction of the nitro group catalyzed by indium metal in the presence<br>
of a hydrogen source. P4d is obtained by subsequent cyclization by means of condensation<br>
with amidines followed by installation of a vinyl moiety using organometallic assisted<br>
coupling reactions in standard fashion known to the person skilled in the art.<br>
When R2 in intermediate P4d is a chemical moiety which is to undergo synthetic<br>
transformations, these transformations are carried out after completion of the coupling with<br>
the vinyl moiety. These synthetic transformations include, but are not limited to,<br>
deprotections, couplings, oxidations, reductions.<br>
with a particularly preferred process of the invention, the installed vinyl<br>
olefin bond of intermediate P3d (Scheme 13 above) is cleaved using oxidation agents for<br>
olefinic bonds such as osmium tetroxide or ruthenium(III)chloride in the presence of<br>
sodium periodate, ozone, and others known to person skilled in the art.<br>
According to a further general process, compounds of Formula (I) can be converted to<br>
alternative compounds of Formula (I), employing suitable interconversion techniques well<br>
known by a person skilled in the art.<br>
If the above set of general synthetic methods is not applicable to obtain compounds<br>
according to Formula (I) and/or necessary intermediates for the synthesis of compounds of<br>
Formula (I), suitable methods of preparation known by a person skilled in the art should be<br>
used. In general, the synthesis pathways for any individual compound of Formula (I) will<br>
depend on the specific substitutents of each molecule and upon the ready availability of<br>
intermediates necessary; again such factors being appreciated by those of ordinary skill in<br>
the art. For all the protection and deprotection methods, see Kocienski, 1994 (above) and<br>
Greene et al., 1999 (above).<br>
Compounds of this invention can be isolated in association with solvent molecules by crystallization<br>
from evaporation of an appropriate solvent. The pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
acid addition salts of the compounds of Formula (I), which contain a basic center, may be<br>
prepared in a conventional manner. For example, a solution of the free base may be treated<br>
with a suitable acid, either neat or in a suitable solution, and the resulting salt isolated either<br>
by filtration or by evaporation under vacuum of the reaction solvent. Pharmaceutical ly<br>
acceptable base addition salts may be obtained in an analogous manner by treating a solu42<br>
tion of compound of Formula (I) with a suitable base. Both types of salts may be formed or<br>
interconverted using ion-exchange resin techniques.<br>

Example 18: Biological assays<br>
The compounds of the present invention may be subjected to the following assays:<br>
a) High Throughput PI3K lipid kinase assay (binding assay):<br>
The efficacy of compounds of the invention in inhibiting the PI3K induced-lipid<br>
phosphorylation may be tested in the following binding assay.<br>
The assay combines the scintillation proximity assay technology (SPA, Amersham) with<br>
the capacity of neomycin (a polycationic antibiotic) to bind phospholipids with high<br>
affinity and specificity. The Scintillation Proximity Assay is based on the properties of<br>
weakly emitting isotopes (such as 3H, 1251,33P). Coating SPA beads with neomycin allows<br>
the detection of phosphorylated lipid substrates after incubation with recombinant PI3K and<br>
radioactive ATP in the same well, by capturing the radioactive phospholipids to the SPA<br>
beads through their specific binding to neomycin.<br>
To a 384 wells MTP containing 5 |il of the test compound of Formula (I) (solubilized in 6%<br>
DMSO; to yield a concentration of 100, 30, 10, 3, 1,0.3, 0.1, 0.03, 0.01, 0.001 uM of the<br>
test compound), the following assay components are added. 1) 5 ul (58 ng) of Human<br>
recombinant GST-PI3Ky (in Hepes 40 mM, pH 7.4, DTT 1 mM and ethylenglycol 5%) 2)<br>
10 ul of lipid micelles and 3) 10 ul of Kinase buffer ([33P]y-ATP 45uM/60nCi, MgCl2<br>
30mM, DTT ImM, (3-Glycerophosphate ImM, Na3VO4 100 uM, Na Cholate 0.3 %, in<br>
Hepes 40 mM, pH 7.4). After incubation at room temperature for 180 minutes, with gentle<br>
agitation, the reaction is stopped by addition of 60 ul of a solution containing 100 ug of<br>
neomycin-coated PVT SPA beads in PBS containing ATP lOmM and EDTA 5mM. The<br>
assay is further incubated at room temperature for 60 minutes with gentle agitation to allow<br>
binding of phospholipids to neomycin-SPA beads. After precipitation of the neomycincoated<br>
PVT SPA beads for 5 minutes at 1500 x g, radioactive PtdIns(3)P is quantified by<br>
scintillation counting in a Wallac MicroBeta ™ plate counter.<br>
The values indicated in Table I below refer to the ICso (nM) with respect to PI3Ky, i.e. the<br>
amount necessary to achieve 50% inhibition of said target. Said values show a considerable<br>
inhibitory potency of thiazole compounds with regard to PI3Ky.<br>
Examples of inhibitory activities for compounds of of the invention are set out in Table I<br>
below.<br>

b) Cell based ELISA to monitor PI3K inhibition:<br>
The efficacy of compounds of the invention in inhibiting the PI3K induced Akt/PKB<br>
phosphorylation may be tested in the following cell based assay.<br>
Measurement of Akt/PKB phosphorylation in macrophages after stimulation with<br>
Complement 5a: Raw 264: Raw 264-7 macrophages (cultured in DMEM-F12 medium<br>
containing 10% Fetal Calf serum and antibiotics) are plated at 20'000 cells/well in a 96<br>
MTP 24 h before cell stimulation. Previous to the stimulation with 50 nM of Complement<br>
5a during 5 minutes, Cells are serum starved for 2h, and pretreated with inhibitors for 20<br>
minutes. After stimulation cells are fixed in 4% formaldehyde for 20 minutes and washed 3<br>
times in PBS containing 1% Triton X-100 (PBS/Triton). Endogenous peroxidase is blocked<br>
by a 20 minutes incubation in 0.6% FfeC^ and 0.1% Sodium Azide in PBS/Triton and<br>
washed 3 times in PBS/Triton. Cells are then blocked by 60 minutes incubation with 10%<br>
fetal calf serum in PBS/Triton. Next, phosphorylated Akt/PKB is detected by an overnight<br>
incubation at 4°C with first antibody (anti phospho Serine 473 Akt IHC, Cell Signaling)<br>
diluted 800-fold in PBS/Triton, containing 5% bovine serum albumin (BSA). After 3<br>
washes in PBS/Triton, cells are incubated for 60 minutes with a peroxidase conjugated<br>
goat-anti-rabbit antibody (1/400 dilution in PBS/Triton, containing 5% BSA), washed 3<br>
times in PBS/Triton, and 2 times in PBS and further incubated in 100 \i\ of substrate<br>
reagent solution (R&amp;D) for 20 minutes. The reaction is stopped by addition of 50 ul of 1 M<br>
SC&gt;4H2 and absorbance is read at 450 nm.<br>
The values indicated in Table II below reflect the percentage of inhibition of AKT<br>
phoshorylation as compared to basal level. Said values show a clear effect of the thiazole<br>
compounds on the activation of AKT phosphorylation in macrophages.<br>
