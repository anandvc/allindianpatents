				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>3) This invention relates to a punching machine, the likes of which are used for punch marking tickets issued to passengers travelling by bus.<br>
There in the art, exist other punching - machines also. One widely used is called a Nipper (type - III lever simple machine) and is a hand-held device, wherein the work of punching is accomplished by inserting a ticket between upper and middle sheets and pressing by thumb. The fingers provide necessary leverage to a lower sheet, said lower sheet is provided with a punching rod. The three sheets are rivetted at the other end. The clippings from the tickets are expelled and fall down. Further, it does not provide either a pen or any whistle. Over a period the tensile - strength is lost and this model loses efficiency.<br>
Another kind in use ( belonging to type I lever of simple machines), is a heavy and large cutting - plier like device. The heaviness, inaccuracy and requirement of holding by hand are the inherent drawbacks.<br>
Dissatisfied with these drawbacks, the users resort to other methods like piercing by pen-tips or merely tearing at the edges of tickets. Moreover, incorrect punching is a deviation from prescribed mode of punching. While working with these types of punches, the user cannot write comfortably, since there is no pen at hand, neither any whistle is provided with them. Clippings from tickets are spilled and fall on the floor.<br>
Keeping in view the above mentioned and other drawbacks of existing punching - machines and with a view to provide a short, sleek, 'Self - retaining -machine, that is capable of performing distinct and quick punching action and at the same time environment-friendly, this invention is made. Provision of a pen and whistle assembly are the other distinguing features of this invention.<br><br>
The invention, a punching machine, having one effort arm (1), one load arm (2), both said arms (1) and (2) assembled in a hinge joint (6), said load arm (2) provided with a pen assembly having one pen (13), one whistle (4) assembled on said effort arm (1), one finger ring (14) assembled on said load arm (2). Describing briefly two arms one effort arm ( 1 ) and other load arm ( 2 ) assembled in a hinge joint ( 6) ) by means of a pivot pin ( 7 ). One punching-rod ( 22 ) and a die ( 15 ) form the punching assembly. The punching-machine is provided with a finger ring ( 14 ) that is used to mount it on the index-finger thus making the machine "finger mounted and self-retaining". A pen ( 13 ) assembly and a whistle ( 4 ) component provide the user with additional advantage of writing and signaling, A container ( 26 ) is assembled in said die ( 15 ) serves the purpose of collecting the clippings from tickets. A leaf-spring (12) assembled between said two arms (1) and (2), keeps the punching machine in a neutral position.<br>
It will now be understood, that the particular punching machine assembly, embodied in this invention, is shown by way of illustration only and not as a limitation of the invention; the principles and features of which may be employed in various and numerous embodiments without departing from the scope and ambit of this invention.  Reference is made to the accompanying drawings, in which are shown illustrative embodiment of the invention, from which the novel features and advantages will be apparent.<br>
The invention will now be fully described, as to its various parts, construction and method of use, with specific reference to each part; as shown in drawings using numerals to indicate each part In the accompanying drawings :<br>
Fig (1)	shows schematic diagram of the punching machine.<br>
Fig (2)	shows oblique view of the punching machine<br>
Fig (3)	Shows enlarged view of punching rod (with conical helical spring<br>
separated)<br>
Fig (4)	shows hinge joint and section  (with joint separated).<br><br>
It is constructed in this manner.<br>
One effort arm ( 1 ) and one load arm ( 2 ) are assembled in a hinge joint ( 6 ) by using a pivot pin ( 7 ), a punching rod ( 22 ) is assembled with said effort arm ( 1 ) by using a rivet ( 19 ), the base of said punching rod ( 22 ) is provided with threadings ( 18 ) Said threading (18 ) facilitate assembly of a conical helical spring ( 17 ) on said punching rod ( 22 ), said conical helical spring (17 ) acts as a ejector spring and releases free the ticket after each punching action. For the purpose of assembly said Conical helical spring ( 17 ) is inserted over said punching rod ( 22 ) and rotated clock-wise on said threadings ( 18 ) until locked. Punching -tip of said punching rod (22) is provided with a sharp edge (16) for efficient cutting.<br>
A die ( 15 ) with threading ( 15' ) is provided in said load-arm (2)m Similar threading ( 26') are provided on the neck of a container ( 26 ). This arrangement serves the purpose of assembly of said container ( 26 ) in said die ( 15 )j Said container ( 26 ) is to be rotated clock - wise forassembly and anti - clock wise, for detaching. Together; said Punching-rod (22) and said die (15) form the punching -assembly and is capable of punching because of mutual alignment.<br>
A finger ring ( 14 ) is assembled in said load arm ( 2 ) by means of a rivet (23 ) a rubber padding ( 28 ) is provided within said finger ring ( 14 ) said finger ring (14) serves the purpose of self-retaining the punching machine on index-finger. A thumb-pad ( 3 ) on said effort arm ( 1 ) serves as a cushion during pressing action. A clip ( 5 ) is revetted on said effort arm ( 1 ) and is meant to hold a whistle   (4   ).<br>
A pen (13 ) with refill ( 30) is assembled along said load arm ( 2 )4his is achieved in this manner. A pen holder ( 9 ) is taken and assembled, using one rivet (9' ) on said load arm ( 2) . Said pen ( 13 ) is a inserted with in an extension spring ( 10 ), front end of said extension spring ( 10 ) is attached to a hook ( 29 ) while the other-end of said extension spring ( 10 ) is assembled by using a screw ( 8 ) in said pen holder (9 ); a loop (24 ) is provided on said load arm ( 2 ) and serves to guide said pen ( 13 ) back into said pen holder ( 9 ).<br><br>
A leaf spring ( 12 ) with its free-end located in said groove ( 27 ) of said effort arm (1) and assembled by means of a rivet (11 ) in said load arm ( 2 ), serves the purpose of keeping said two arms ( 1 ) and (2 ) in neutral position. Distinguishing features of the invention are a finger ring ( 14 ), a conical helical spring ( 17 ) whistle (4 ) component and one pen (13 ) assembly.<br>
METHOD OF USE: The user wears the finger ring ( 14 ) in right index-finger. (Finger to be inserted from right to left) The finger ring ( 14 ) is then slid deep in the index-finger until it reaches the last digit. The ticket is held in the left hand and inserted between punching rod (22) and said die (15). An optimum functional position is achieved when the right index-finger is partially closed and the thumb is placed on said thumb-pad (3). Pressure is now applied on said thumb-pad ( 3 ) by right thumb until punching rod (22) traverses through ticket into said die (15). The ticket is punched in this manner.<br>
The thumb is now removed, from said thumb-pad (3), said leaf-spring (12) now, separates said arms (1 ) and (2) by spring action and brings punching machine to a neutral position. Said conical helical spring (17) simultaneously ejects the ticket from punching rod (22). The ticket can now be withdrawn;without any obstruction. Clippings are deposited in said container ( 26) and its detachability facilitates easy disposal. This process can be repeated a number of times.<br>
For the purpose of writing, front-end of said pen ( 13 ) is pulled forwards by grasping in left hand and then held in right hand fingers and writing work carried out. On releasing said pen ( 13 ) said extension spring ( 10 ) retracts it back into said pen holder (9), said loop ( 24) serves the purpose of guiding said pen (13) back into pen holder (9).<br>
To use the whistle (4), the whistle (4) is brought near the mouth and is mouth - blown with ease.<br>
When not in use the punching - machine can be removed from index and kept in either a pocket or a bag.<br><br><br><br><br>
