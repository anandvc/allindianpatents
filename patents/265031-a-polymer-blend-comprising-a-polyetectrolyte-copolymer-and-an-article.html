				<td>BLEND OF IONIC (CO)POLYMER RESINS AND MATRIX (CO)POLYMERS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to polymeric blends containing polyelectrolyte resins blended into a polymer or copolymer matrix. Specifically, the polyelectrolyte resins are (co)polymers without hydrolyzable groups. The matrix polymer is a tough, and highly chemical-resistant (co)polymer, preferably a fluoropolymer. The polymeric resin blend is useful for forming films, and especially films useful for MEAs for use in fuel cells.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Perfluorocarbon ionic exchange membranes provide high cation transport, and have been extensively used as ionic exchange membranes. Polymeric ion exchange membranes can be referred to as solid polymer electrolytes or polymer exchange membranes (PEM). Because of the severe requirements for fuel cell applications, the most commonly used membranes, and commercially available, are made from perfluorosulfonated Nafion®, Flemion® and Aciplex® polymers. However, reports and literature describe these membranes as working well but show several limitations that prevent developing the technology further to commercialization. Additionally, they work better with gaseous fuels than with liquid fuels which may be mainly due to liquid fuel crossover that diminishes cell performance. A membrane's chemical resistance and mechanical strength are important properties for fuel cell applications. Indeed, the membrane is often subjected to high differential pressure, hydration-dehydration cycles, as well as other stressful conditions. Also, mechanical strength becomes important when the membrane is very thin such as less than 50 microns. Further, when used with fuel cells or battery applications, the membrane sits in a very acidic medium at temperatures that can reach 200 °C, in an oxidizing and/or reducing environment due to the presence of metal ions and sometimes the presence of solvents. This environment requires that the membrane be chemically and electrochemically resistant, as well as thermally stable.<br>
Currently, many fluorine-containing membranes can suffer<br>
from one or more of the following short comings:<br>
i)         high liquid and gas crossover through the membrane;<br>
ii) heterogeneous blending between the fluorinated polymer and other polymers that leads to inferior properties;<br>
iii)       insufficient chemical resistance in the presence of some liquid fuels;<br>
iv)       poor electrochemical resistance;<br>
v)        lack of homogeneous distribution of sulfonated groups;<br>
vi)       poor mechanical properties; and/or poor thermal stability.<br>
Polyelectrolyte polymer blends having small domain sizes, and a process for producing such are described in US 2005077233. The polyelectrolyte polymer is a non-perfluorinated polymeric resin containing ionic and/or ionizable groups and in particular sulfonate or phosphonate groups, with a fluoropolymer matrix. One problem with the disclosed polyelectrolytes is that those containing hydrolytically unstable groups, such as esters and acrylamides, tend to hydrolyze in harsh chemical environments leading to a loss of the ionizable functionality.<br>
WO 99/67304 describes a new class of unsaturated compounds having a fluoroether-substituted aromatic ring, and polymers formed from these compounds. One use for the polymers is as separators in electrochemical cells.<br>
There is a need for a membrane that overcomes the limitations for use in fuel cell applications.<br>
Surprisingly, it was found that polymer blends containing a fluoropolymer and a polyelectrolyte having no hydrolyzable groups can be used to form membranes for electrochemical cells having a high level of chemical resistance and mechanical strength.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
It is an objective of the invention to provide polyelectrolytes having excellent proton conductivity, and chemical resistance.<br>
It is a further objective of the invention to provide a membrane or film wherein the polyelectrolyte is evenly distributed in a matrix polymer, such as a fluoropolymer, and where the domain size is very small.<br>
It is a further objective to provide a well-defined polyelectrolyte that is hydrolytically stable (non-hydrolyzable), involves relatively low-cost starting materials, and can be formed with a minimal number of transformations.<br>
The objectives of the invention are achieved, in accordance with the principles of a preferred embodiment of the invention, by a polymer blend containing a fluoropolymer and a polyelectrolyte having no hydrolyzable groups. The domain size of the vinyl resin in the fluoropolymer matrix is preferably 500 nm or less.<br>
Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1: Depicts a typical Membrane-Electrode Assembly, as described in Example 54.<br>
Detailed Description of the Invention:<br>
The terms polymer and (co)polymer, as used herein refer to polymers formed from one or more monomers. This includes homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers and polymers formed from four or more monomers. Copolymer refers to both random and block copolymers, as well as graft copolymers. Copolymer is also used to describe a polymer resembling a copolymer which is formed by the partial reaction/substitution of some of the side groups of a homopolymer, resulting in a polymer backbone having two or more different moieties as side chains.<br>
The invention relates to polymeric resin blends containing polyelectrolyte resins blended into a polymer or copolymer matrix. Specifically, the polyelectrolyte resins are (co)polymers without hydrolyzable groups. The matrix polymer is a tough, and highly chemical-resistant (co)polymer, preferably a fluoropolymer.<br>
The matrix polymer can be any of the polymers and copolymers described as the matrix in US2005077233, incorporated herein by reference. Preferably, the polymer matrix contains at least one fluoropolymer. The fluoropolymer can be a homopolymer or other type of polymer, and can be a mixture of fluoropolymers or a mixture of fluoropolymer with a non-fluoropolymer. Preferably, the fluoropolymer is a thermoplastic fluoropolymer and can form a polymer blend with the other components of a formulation, including other polymers present. Preferably, the fluoropolymer is a poly(vinylidene fluoride) polymer such as apoly(vinylidene<br>
fluoride) homopolymer. Other examples of fluoropolymers include, but are not limited to, a poly(alkylene) containing at least one fluorine atom, such as polyhexafluoropropylene, polytetrafluoroethylene, poly(vinyl fluoride), or combinations thereof. More preferably, the fluoropolymer is a polymeric composition containing from about 30% to about 100 weight % of vinylidene fluoride and from 0% to about 70 weight % of at least one poly(alkylene) containing at least one fluorine atom, such as, hexafluoropropylene, tetrafluoroethylene, trifluoroethylene (VF3), chlorotrifluoroethylene, and/or vinyl fluoride. Preferably, the molecular weight of the fluoropolymer which can include homopolymers, copolymers, terpolymers, oligomers, and other types of polymers is from about 80,000 MW to about 1,000,000 MW and, more preferably from about 100,000 MW to about 500,000 MW. The fluoropolymers can be prepared using the techniques described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,051,677; 3,178,399; 3,475,396; 3,857,827; and 5,093,427, all incorporated herein in their entirety by reference.<br>
The matrix polymer is blended with one or more polyelectrolye (co)polymers. The polyelectrolyte copolymer contains ionic or ionizable groups, as well as groups capable of crosslinking. The ionizable groups are preferably sulfonate, phosphonate or carboxylate groups. The level of ionic or ionizable groups should be high, preferably from 25 to 99 weight percent, more preferably from 50 to 95 weight percent, and most preferably from 70 to 95 weight percent in the polyelectrolyte. The ionic or ionizable groups may be present on the monomer used to form the polyelectrolyte, or may be added to the polyelectrolyte in a post-polymerization reaction.<br>
The level of cross-linking moieties is from 1 -75 weight percent, preferably 1 -50 weight percent, more preferably from 10-30 weight percent, and most preferably from 10-20 weight percent, based on the weight of the copolymer. Cross-linking can be done via conventional methods including, but not limited to, self-condensation, addition of a secondary cross-linking agent, or radiation crosslinking. These are well described in the literature and well known in the art. Examples of monomers able to undergo self condensation crosslinking include, but are not limited to: primary, secondary, and tertiary amines; N-methylol acrylamide; isobutoxy methacrylamide; N-methylenebisacrylamide; allyl groups, styryl groups; and glycidyl methacrylate. Examples of secondary cross-linkers include free and blocked isocyanates,<br>
melamines, epoxies, carboxylates, α,∞-dihaloalkanes, α,∞-dialdehydes, carboxylic acids, alkoxy silanes, silicones, aziridines, and carbodiimides. Catalysts which can be chosen for the specific crosslinking chemistry and would include organotins, sulfonic acids, or amines. Examples of radiation cross-linking include electron beam, ultraviolet, and gamma radiation.<br>
The polyelectrolyte may be non-perfluorinated, partially-perfluorinated or entirely perfluorinated (co)polymers. The level of perfluorination can have dramatic effects on the ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, and permeability of the resultant (co)polymer blend(s).<br>
Polyelectrolytes useful in the present invention are those containing non-hydrolyzable groups. It has been found that monomers having readily hydrolyzable groups, such as esters (for example acrylates and methacrylates) and acrylamides, will hydrolyze in harsh chemical environments (such as in battery acid), and lose the ability to easily ionize. Preferred polyelectrolytes are those having a styrenic or vinyl ether structure.<br>
The polyelectrolyte can be formed by emulsion, suspension, inverse emulsion, or solution polymerization. It may also be formed by a post-polymerization modification.<br>
The polyelectrolytes of the invention and manner of making the polyelectrolytes will now be illustrated, both generally and specifically, with reference to specific embodiments thereof, namely vinyl ether-type polyelectrolytes, and styrenic-type polyelectrolytes. Also, specific and general embodiments will be illustrated showing both traditional copolymerization involving two separate monomers, and the formation of a copolymer based on partial reaction(s) of a homopolymers to form two or more separate functional monomer units.<br>
Vinyl ether-type structures<br>
The general structure of vinyl-ether-type polyelectrolyte structures of the present invention is:((Structures Removed)<br>
Where:<br>
L = non-perfluorinated alkyl or alkylene-etheralkylene-ether linkage<br>
L' = a bond or alkyl or alkylene-etheralkylene-ether linkage<br>
n = 25-99 mol%, preferably greater than 50%, most preferably greater than 70%<br>
m = 1-75 mol%, preferably less than 50%, most preferably less than 30%<br>
A = a sulfonate, phosphonate or carboxylate<br>
B = a group capable of cross-linking<br>
A general synthetic route to said copolymers is: (Structures Removed)<br>
X = Cl, Br, or 1<br>
Y = aliphatic (-CH2-)of C2 to C12, or aromatic-containing (eg.: -<br>
M = Alkali earth metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs)<br>
n : m = preferably, 80:20 to 90:10 mol/mol<br>
An alternate general synthetic route to said copolymers is:<br>
(Structures Removed)<br>
Z = aliphatic or perfluoroaliphatic of C2 to C5, or aromatic or perfluoroaromatic MH = Metal hydride (eg. NaH) n : m = preferably, 80:20 or 90:10 mol/mol<br>
Conditions for the transformation can vary. Typically, the poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) is dissolved in DMSO, a basic reactant is added, such as potassium hydroxide, sodium hydroxide, strongly basic amine, or metal hydride, then the sulfonated alkylhalide or sultone is added slowly with gentle heating (-30 to 50 °C). Workup consists of precipitating the polymer in an appropriate solvent with subsequent washing with solvent.<br>
An alternative synthesis of a vinyl-ester type polyelectrolyte is similar to the one above, however, the metal alkylsulfonate is used in the tetraalkylammonium form. This promotes its solubility in organic solvents other than DMSO as well as provides the final polymer as the tetraalkylammonium salt, which is advantageous for the further processing and blending with polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF).<br>
(Structures Removed)<br>
Conditions for the transformation of the alkylsulfonate are acidification of an aqueous solution of the starting Na salt to pH10 with the tetraalkylammonium hydroxide.<br>
In a variation, the PVA is converted first to the metal alcoholate form. This can be accomplished by the use of an appropriate metal hydride (eg. sodium hydride, lithium-aluminum hydride) in dry solvent (DMSO). The formed metal alcoholate has increased reactivity over the alcohols in the previous examples. The haloalkylsulfonate (in M+ or tetraalkylammonium form) or sultone can then be added to afford the desired polymer. (Structures Removed)<br><br>
In still another useful variation, the starting polymer is poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc), which, of course, is the precursor polymer to poly(vinyl alcohol). In this case, the ester is converted, in situ, to the alcoholate and substitution on the haloalkylsulfonate happens all in one step. This has the advantage of more widely varying conditions as the PVAc is much more soluble in organic solvents than the PVA. If the tetraalkylammonium form of the haloalkylsulfonate is used, the reaction can be mostly homogeneous as the<br>
tetraalkylammonium salts are soluble in common solvents.<br>
(Structures Removed)<br>
In addition to PVA being used as the starting material for the above transformations, copolymers of vinyl alcohol(or acetate) can be used. This could be advantageous as incorporation of ethylene units, for example, can assist with mechanical strength and durability. Styrenic structures can also be formed by similar mechanisms by starting with an appropriate ester-or OH functionalized poly(styrene).<br>
(Structures Removed)<br>
Z = bond, or aliphatic or aromatic linker Styrenic-type structures<br><br>
Where:<br>
W = a bond, O, NH, S, SO, or SO2<br>
The general structure of styrenic-type polyelectrolyte structures of the present invention is:<br>
(Structures Removed)Y = alkyl, aromatic, or alkylene-etheralkylene-ether linkage of C1 to C12 [eg. (-CH2-)1-12]<br>
Z = a bond, alkyl, aromatic,or alkylene-etheralkylene-ether linkage of C1 to C12<br>
n = 1-99 mol%, preferably greater than 50%, most preferably greater than 70%<br>
m = 1-99 mol%, preferably less than 50%, most preferably less than 30%<br>
A = a sulfonate, phosphonate or carboxylate<br>
B = a group capable of cross-linking<br>
Based on the general structure above, one can envision many routes to these types of copolymers including, but not limited to (co)polymerization of the pre-functionalized monomers, and post-polymerization modification of appropriately-functionalized polystyrenics. Some of the most preferred routes to these copolymers are outlined below.<br>
The direct copolymerization of Sodium 4-vinylbenzylsulfonate (NaVBS) and vinylbenzylalcohol (VBA) can be carried out. These particular monomers are synthesized as described in the literature. [NaVBS - US 2909508, VBA -Bamford, C. H., and Lindsay, H.; Polymer, 14,330-332 (1973).] Solution polymerization of these monomers can be carried out in an appropriate solvent (such as DMSO, NMP, DMF, DMAc and the like) using standard techniques. Copolymers of these monomers may also be synthesized in an emulsion, or inverse emulsion-type polymerization, although solution polymerization is preferred.<br>
(Structures Removed)One method for synthesizing a sulfonated styrenic monomer containing a single ether linkage, and useful in forming the polyelectrolyte of the invention is shown below. VBC, a commercial product from Dow (Specialty Monomers division) is obtained as a mixture of the 3- and 4-vinyl isomers. This molecule can be reacted with various alpha-hydroxy, alpha-amino, or alpha-sulfide, omega-sulfonate molecules to afford the nucleophilic substitution of the benzylic chloride position producing a styrenic-type monomer with variable spacers between the styryl unit and the sulfonate.<br>
(Structures Removed)<br>
Where VBC = 4-vinylbenzyl chloride, mixture of 3- and 4-vinyl isomers<br>
W = OH, NH2, or SH<br>
Y = alkyl, aromatic, or alkylene-ether, alkylene-ether linkage of C1-C12<br>
M = alkali earth metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) or tetraalkylammonium counterion<br>
The structure illustrated is obtained when: W = OH, and Y = -CH2-CH2-CH2-<br>
The sulfonated styrenic monomer formed can then be copolymerized as previously illustrated with a hydroxyl-functionalized styrenic monomer to afford the desired copolymer structure.<br>
(Structures Removed)<br>
The hydroxyl (or other cross-linkable) functionality on the polyelectrolyte can be obtained from a hydroxyl functional monomer, as illustrated above. Alternately, appropriate ester-functionalized monomers may be employed during the (co)polymerization with a subsequent deprotection (transformation) of the ester to the desired alcohol. This, coupled with one of the sulfonated monomer(polymer) syntheses described above will produce the<br>
desired final (co)polymer structure, as shown below.<br>
(Structures Removed)<br>
Where:<br>
W - a bond, O, NH, S, SO, or SO2<br>
Y = alkyl, aromatic, alkyl-ether, or alkylene-ether linkage of C1 to C12 [eg. (-CH2-)1-12]<br>
Z = a bond, alkyl, aromatic,or alkylether, or alkylene-ether linkage of C1 to C12<br>
R = alkyl or aromatic of C1 to C12<br>
n = 1-99 mol%, preferably greater than 50%, most preferably greater than 70%<br>
m = 1-99 mol%, preferably less than 50%, most preferably less than 30%<br>
The ester-containing comonomer need not even be styrenic in nature. It only need be copolymerizable with a sulfonated (or other functional) styrenic monomer. (Structures Removed)<br>
 incorporated in the monomer component(s) prior to polymerization. Polymerization of an appropriately-functional monomer with subsequent substitution of the sulfonate unit will produce the final structure. An example that illustrates both of these routes (sulfonate substitution and ester deprotection) is as follows:<br>
(Structures Removed)<br>
Where:<br>
W = a bond, alkyl, alkyl-aromatic, alkylether, or alkylene-ether linkage C1-C12<br>
X = halide (Cl, Br, I)<br>
W = W, where they need not be the exactly the same structure<br>
Y = a bond, O, NH, S, SO, SO2<br>
R = alkyl or aromatic of C1 to C12<br>
R' = alkyl or aromatic of C1 to C12, not necessarily but can be the same as R<br>
n = 1-99 mo\%, preferably greater than 50%, most preferably greater than 70%<br>
m = 1-99 mo\%, preferably less than 50%, most preferably less than 30%<br>
In one embodiment, where W - CH2, W = a bond, R = CH3, X = Cl, Y = O, and R' = CH2-CH2-CH2, the synthesis of the polyelectrolyte would be:<br>
(Structures Removed)<br>
In one preferred embodiment, a copolymer polyelectrolyte of the invention is synthesized from a single homopolymer by selective functionalization to form the desired (co)polymer. The functionalization step must be very well controlled in order to produce the desired n:m ratio in the final copolymer. For example:<br>
(Structures Removed)<br>
Where:<br>
W = alkyl, aromatic, alkylether, or alkylene-ether C1-C12<br>
W' = alkyl, aromatic, alkylether, or alkylene-ether C1-C12, but not necessarily the same as W<br>
X = halide (Cl, Br, I)<br>
X' = halide (Cl, Br, I) not necessarily the same as X<br>
Y = alkyl or aromatic ester<br>
M = alkali earth metal (Li, Na, K, Rb, Cs) or tetraalkylammonium cation<br>
A specific example would be the following:<br>
(Structures Removed)<br>
Where: W - CH2, X = Cl, Y = acetate, X' = Br, W = propyl, M = Na<br>
In addition, the hydroxylated homopolymer can be formed by the direct polymerization of the analogous hydroxylated monomer. It need not be converted from the halide-bearing monomer. The hydroxylated homopolymer can then be used as shown above to form the desired copolymer structure. (Structures Removed)<br>
where: W = alkyl, aromatic, alkylether, or alkylene-ether C<br>
Additional styryl-type monomers useful in the invention include, but are not limited to a sulfobetaine, meaning the monomer contains a sulfonate group as well as it's own counterion<br>
(quaternary ammonium). For styrylsulfobetaine-type monomers of the type shown below, the substitution need not be at the 2-position, and could potentially be at the 3- or 4- or multiple positions. It is also possible that the ammonium counterion be pendent to the ring, and not necessarily a pyridinium type ion as shown in this example. The hydroxyl-functionalized monomer shown is similar to those described previously in this report. The above copolymer can be produced by typical free-radical copolymerization in appropriate solvent as in the other systems and as is well known in the art.<br>
(Structures Removed)<br>
Another embodiment of the invention would be a polyelectrolyte containing a polymer or copolymer of an aromatic monomer having pendent fluorinated sulfonate groups. One example would be the monomer described in WO 99/67304, incorporated herein by reference. Monomers of this type, have the general structure: (Structures Removed)<br><br>
wherein Rf is a fluoroalkylene or fluoroalkylene-ether; Y is C, O, or N; and Rf' is fluoroalkylene or fluoroalkylene-ether; and(Structures Removed)<br>
wherein (R)m is a polymerizable group, Br or I; and Rf, Rf', and Y are as described above. The aromatic monomers having pendent fluorinated sulfonate groups can be used to form homopolymers, or they can be copolymerized with other ethylenically unsaturated monomers to form the polyelectrolyte of the invention. A preferred monomer for use in forming a copolymer is styrene. The (co)polymer is then blended into the matrix polymer.<br>
The polyelectrolyte is blended into a polymer or copolymer matrix to form the polymer blend of the invention. The polymer blend may be any type of mixture of two or more polymers described above and throughout this application with at least one selected from the class of matrix polymers and one selected from the class of polyelectrolytes. Preferably, the polymer blend is an intimate blend of chosen polymers. The amount of matrix polymer can be from 5 to 95 weight % and the amount of polyelectrolyte can be from 95 to 5 weight %. Preferably, the matrix polymer is present in an amount of from 40% to 80 weight % and the polyelectrolyte is present at from 20 to 60 weight %.<br>
In many cases, the acid groups present on the polyelectrolyte phase are initially in neutralized form. The cation may consist of any chosen from Group IA metals (Na, K, Cs, Rb), or alternatively an organic cation such as phosphonium, imidazolium, or benzamidazolium. In order to effectively continue the process of blending a polyelectrolyte of this invention with a matrix (co)copolymer, the sulfonic acid groups on the polyelectrolyte must first be ion-exchanged (protonated) with protons. This is accomplished by passing a solution of the polyelectrolyte through a column which has previously been loaded with an appropriate ion-exchange resin. The column can be of a range of diameters and lengths depending on the quantity of polyelectrolyte to be treated. A typical column will have a diameter of from 1.0 in. to 36.0 in., preferrably from 6.0 in. to 18.0 in. The column length will have a length of from 12.0 in. to 144.0 in, preferrably from 24.0 to 72.0 in. The bottom of the column is conical-shaped and fitted with a stopcock or similar device to control the flow of liquid through the apparatus.<br>
To afford the ion-exchange (protonation) of the polyelectrolyte, to the column is added a quantity of ion-exchange resin. Dowex Marathon (Dow Chemicals, Inc.) ion-exchange resin is one example of a classes of resins which may be used. In particular, Dowex Marathon A, Marathon B, or Marathon C resins may be used. The amount of resin loaded into the column<br>
is equivalent to at least one to ten times in relation to the number of acid groups to be ion-exchanged (per the manufacturer's specifications). Preferrably, the amount of resin used is from one to five times in relation to the number of acid groups to be ion-exchanged. The column is then washed with deionized water several times until the water eluting from the column is no lower than pH = 5.0. The neutralized polyelectrolyte is then dissolved in an appropriate solvent to a homogeneous solution. The solvent should be chosen according to the specific chemical functionality present in the polyelectrolyte. Typically, polar protic or polar aprotic solvents are used. The polyelectrolyte solution is added to the top of the column and allowed to drain into contact with the exchange resin. Additional solvent is added to the top of the column in an amount enough to keep the resin from drying out. The pH of the eluting solution is continually monitored. The protonated polyelectrolyte solution is collected from the bottom of the column when the pH of the eluting solution drops below 5.0. The polyelectrolyte solution collection is stopped when the pH returns to above 5.0. A protonated polyelectrolyte solution is thereby obtained. The content of any residual cation is quantified by analytical techniques familiar to those skilled in the art.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the blending process is begun by first reacting the acidic proton-bearing ionizable groups on the polyelectrolyte with an appropriate tetraalkylammonium hydroxide (TAA OH) to form the tetraalkylammonium salt. Preferably the ammonium salt has a molecular weight of at least 186. Examples of suitable ammonium salts include: tetramethylammmonium, tetraethylammonium, tetrapropylammonium, tetrabutylammonium, tetrapentylammonium, and tetrahexylammonium.<br>
A solution of this TAA-neutralized polyelectrolyte may then solvent-switched to a solvent which may appropriately dissolve the matrix (co)polymer of choice. If the solvent that was used in the ion-exchange column and for the TAAOH neutralization also will dissolve the matrix (co)polymer, this step will not be necessary. A preferred embodiment includes the 'switching' of solvent from that which the ion-exchange column was run to another which the TAA neutralized polyelectrolyte and the matrix (co)polymer are both fully soluble. This process preferrably consists of adding the new solvent to the TAA neutralized polyelectrolyte solution then removing the original solvent with heating and application of vacuum (vacuum distillation). Other processes for affording this 'solvent switch' include precipitation of the<br>
TAA-neutralized polyelectrolyte with subsequent filtration of the polymer and redissolution in the new solvent. Once all of the original solvent has been removed, an appropriate amount of matrix (co)polymer, which has previously been dissolved in the same solvent is added. As stated above, the amount of matrix polymer can be from 5 to 95 weight % and the amount of polyelectrolyte can be from 95 to 5 weight % in the blend solution. Preferably, the matrix polymer is present in an amount of from 40% to 80 weight % and the polyelectrolyte is present at from 20 to 60 weight % in the blend solution. This blended solution is then cast into a thin film or further processed to yield a useful article such as an ion-exchange membrane.<br>
Casting of the blended solution can be carried out by many different procedures familiar to those skilled in the art. Particularly, solution casting with heating is selected. A quantity of the polymer blend solution is placed on an appropriate substrate. A sharp metal knife is then drawn across the substrate with a gap between the knife and the substrate. The thickness of this gap and the viscosity of the polymer blend solution control the thickness of the formed film. The thickness of the formed film is dependent on the end-use of the material, and can vary from 1.0 um to 2.0mm. Preferrably, the formed film has a thickness of 10.0 urn to 500.0 |nm and most preferrably from 20.0 um to 250.0 um. This 'wet' film is then dried in a air-circulating oven at elevated temperature. The time and temperature for drying the film can vary widely. The temperature used is from 20 °C to 250 °C, preferrably from 100 °C to 220 °C, and most preferrably from 120 °C to 200 °C. The drying time for the wet film can also vary widely. The oven residence time should be commercially applicable and scalable in that it can be from 1.0 s to 24 h, preferrably from 1.0 min. to 2.0 h, and most preferrably from 1.0 min. to 45.0 min.<br>
The thickness of the final, dried film depends on the original thickness of the wet film before drying. This thickness will vary depending on the application intended for the final atricle. The thickness can be from 1.0 um to 2.0 mm, preferrably from 5.0 UJTI to 500.0 u,m, most preferrably from 10.0 um to 300.0 urn. The dried film is removed from the substrate by typical methods familiar to those skilled in the art. Typically, the film is mechanically peeled from the substrate directly or with the aid of a metal knife. Alternatively, the film can be hydrated or submersed in water or solvent to aid in the removal of the film from the substrate.<br>
The domain size of the polyelectrolyte in a cast film should be preferably less than 1.0<br>
µrn, and more preferably between 1 nm to 500 nm. The domain sizes discussed herein are with respect to maximum domain sizes and/or average domain sizes. In a preferred embodiment, the domain sizes recited are the maximum domain sizes, but can be the average domain sizes.<br>
The proton conductivity of the polymer blend of the invention is &gt;20 mS/cm, preferably &gt;50 mS/cm, and most preferably &gt;100 mS/cm. Additionally, the polymer blend has a high degree of mechanical strength, a low swelling when hydrated, hydrolytic (chemical) stability, and a low level of sulfur loss (if sulfonated) in hot water or hot acid environments.<br>
An article, such as a membrane, produced from the polymer blend of the invention can then be used as-is or further treated by an acidic washing step to remove the tetraalkyl groups, concurrently reprotonating the ionizable groups present on the starting (co)polymer component. In addition, cross-linking may be employed to improve dimensinal stability. Cross-linking may be carried out by the action of an external agent on pendent functionalities present on the polyelectrolyte, the matrix (co)polymer, or combinations thereof. It is also feasible to incorporate internal cross-linking groups which are already pendent on either the polyelectrolyte or the matrix (co)polymer, which are then appropriately activated by application of an external impetus (heat or radiation).<br>

The resultant articles can be utilized as perm-selective membranes for battery or fuel cell applications. In addition, the resultant articles may be applied to electrodes for the construction of a membrane-electrode-assembly, may be imbibed with various liquids, or may be introduced onto or into a reinforcing matte or porous web to increase mechanical integrity. A polymeric ion membrane or polyelectrolyte membrane can be made from the polymer blend of the present invention. The formed film or membrane may be used as a single layer, or may be part of a multi-layer film or membrane. The polymeric ion membrane can be prepared from conventional film preparation methods, such as melt extrusion, solvent cast, latex cast, and the like. Membrane electrode assemblies can be made from the membranes of the present invention and fuel cells using this membrane electrode assembly can be prepared. In using the polymers of the present invention to form membranes, the polymer can have any equivalent<br>
weight (g of acid groups per g of total polymer) and preferably has an equivalent weight of from about 200 to about 8,000, and preferably from about 200 to about 1,500 and even more preferably from about 200 to about 1,400, with respect to the polyelectrolyte present in the polymer blend.<br>

Drying of Polymer Blend Solutions<br>
Example 52: Casting of the polymer blend solutions into membranes described in Examples 44-51 was done using a Mathis LTE Labdryer. Aluminum foil with approximate dimensions of 15 x 12 in2 was used as the substrate for casting. Approximately 15 g of polymer solution was spread onto the foil and drawn down to a wet film thickness of about 300 urn using a doctor blade. The resulting thin films was then heated at 177 °C for 7 min with an air flow of 1800-2300 RPM. The dry membranes were then removed from the oven and cooled to room temperature. All polymer blend solution compositions produced membranes that had a dry film thickness between 25-50 um.<br>
Washing and Acidification of Polyelectrolyte / Matrix (Co)Polymer Blend Films Example 53: The membranes cast on aluminum foil in Example 52 were immersed in 18 Mfi deionized water to release them from the substrate. The free-standing membranes were then<br>
immersed in a 1M aqueous hydrochloric acid bath at 60-65 °C for 120 min. Subsequently, they were washed with deionized water and immersed in a 1M aqueous sulfuric acid at 60-65 °C for 120 min. The membranes were then removed from the sulfuric acid bath and washed with 18 MQ deionized water to remove residual acid. The acid-form membranes were then air dried and stored at room temperature for future use.<br>
Preparation of Membrane-Electrode Assemblies<br>
-General procedure for the preparation of membrane-Electrode Assemblies (MEAs) from many types of polyelectrolyte / matrix (co)polyer blend films produced by the methodologies discussed above<br>
Example 54: Commercially-available electrodes and gaskets are cut to appropriate size/shape to fit in the testing cell. There should be no gaps and/or overlap of electrodes and gaskets. One electrode and gasket each are placed onto a stainless steel hot-pressing plate/insert. The surface of the electrode is then wetted with deionized water A piece of wet membrane is then placed over the electrode surface and smoothed out. A layer of deionized water down is then applied to the upper membrane surface and the second electrode is placed on this layer. The electrodes are aligned and excess water gently squeezed out. The second gasket is placed on top of the MEA, followed by insert and top pressing plate. The entire assembly is then placed into a pre-heated press at a predetermined time and temperature. It is then removed and cooled to room temperature under low pressure (1-2 Ibs.). The MEA is carefully removed from the stainless steel pressing plates (the membrane may stick to the insert slightly) and excess membrane/gasket material is trimmed away. The complete MEA is placed in the testing cell and bolts are tightened with an appropriate, predetermined force.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
