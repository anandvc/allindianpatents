The lamellar phase creams were prepared by mixing the methyl paraben, BHT, CTAC and cetearyl alcohol in 70% of the total water at 75°C under low shear and then under vacuum at high shear.  A hydroxyethyl cellulose dispersion was prepared in the remaining 30% of the water and heated to 75°C under low shear.  The cellulose dispersion was then added to the initial mixture under low shear, followed by addition of the oil (tricaprylin). 5 minutes of high shear under vacuum was then undertaken.  The resultant mixture was slowly cooled with low shear mixing.  Silicone fluid and phenoxy ethanol were then added.  Triethanolamine was added r followed by perfume and then high shear mixing under vacuum was conducted.<br>
The Examples were applied to hair switches and the styling performance was assessed. For this purpose 0.5g of hair cream was applied to a straight, flat, 2.5 cm wide, 25 cm long hair switch weighing 5g. The cream was spread through the hair and subsequently the hair was pressed together to create a volume down effect.  After styling the frontal area of each switch was assessed by image analysis. Performance was benchmarked against a current commercial hair cream material {referred to as benchmark).  The following results were obtained:<br><br>

These results show that to achieve parity performance with the benchmark at least 20% of oil needs to be used in the composition.<br>
Example 1 vs Example B<br>
The performance of Example 1 above (CTAC lamellar gel phase » + 30% tricaprylin) was compared to comparative Example B. Example B did not have the required lamellar phase.<br><br>

Tricaprylin has a dynamic viscosity of 20 mPas at 25°C and 5s"1 Laurex CS has a melting point of 50-55°C.<br>
Example B<br><br>
Example B was prepared as a normal Oil-in-Water emulsion.<br>
Examples 1 and B were evaluated by a trained quantitative consumer panel and the following results were obtained (attributes scored on a scale from 0 to 100):<br><br>
PCT/EP2004/009609<br><br>
Attribute	Example 1	Example B<br>
Stickiness of hair	32	39<br>
Ease of styling	66	60<br>
Hold of style	61	58<br>
Examples 1 and B were further evaluated by a panel (80 people) and the following results were obtained {attributes scored on a scale from 0 to 5) :<br><br>
Attribute	Example 1	Example B<br>
Can create style	3.11	2.84<br>
Hair is not sticky	3.73	3.57<br>
Initial hold of style	3.11	2.82<br>
Hold of style during the day	3.08	2.79<br>
Based on these results it was concluded that the lamellar gel cream + oil gives a better balance of styling properties and good sensory feel than the non-lamellar phase cream base + oil.<br>
The following are also examples of stable formulations according to the invention, which give good styling properties to hair without feeling sticky on application.<br><br>
