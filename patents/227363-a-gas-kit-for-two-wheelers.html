				<td>The invention relates to a gas kit for two wheelers.<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates to a simple gas kit for use with vehicles. Particularly this invention relates to a gas kit for use with two wheeled vehicles such as mopeds and the like.<br>
Description of Prior Art<br>
At present gas kits adapted to run on LPG fuel are not at all available for two wheelers like motorcycle, scoter, and moped. Therefore, there is a need to develop a kit, which can run on LPG fuel and adapted to be fitted with the two wheelers mentioned herein above.<br>
Advantages and Objects of the Invention<br>
Therefore the main object of the present invention is to provide a novel gas kit for use with two wheelers for example mopeds.<br>
Another object is to provide a gas kit of compact construction which is not prone to failure, and thus a high degree of operational reliability is ensured.<br>
Yet another object is to provide a low cost, easy to fit gas kit.<br>
The following description contains many specifics; these should not be construed as limitations on the scope of the invention, but rather as an exemplification of one preferred embodiment thereof. Many other variations are possible. Accordingly the scope of the invention should not be limited to the embodiment illustrated, and the alterations and variations may be treated within the spirit and scope of this invention.<br><br>
Statement of the Invention<br>
According to this invention there is provided a low cost gas kit comprising a main chamber having an inlet provided at one side thereof such that to be connected with a gas cylinder, a separator being disposed towards the inlet end of the said main chamber for constituting a gas chamber therein, a spring-loaded piston being disposed in said main chamber towards the other end thereof so as to constitute a pressurized gas chamber, an outlet being provided in said pressurized gas chamber such that to be connected with an spring actuated valve being provided for supplying the gas to the piston cylinder assembly and also to the carburetor of the engine of the vehicle.<br>
Brief Description of the Invention<br>
In accordance with this invention the gas kit has a chamber having an inlet at one end which is adapted to be connected with a liquefied petroleum gas cylinder through a metallic connecting tube and a rubber tube. A partition having a check valve / non-return valve provided therewith is disposed within the chamber at one side thereof to constitute a gas chamber towards the inlet end for allowing the gas to be stored therein and passing the same into the pressurized gas chamber through the check valve. A spring-loaded piston is disposed in the chamber on the other side thereof so as to constitute a pressurized gas chamber. The second chamber is provided to hold the gas at the desired pressure. An outlet is provided in the pressurized gas chamber and is connected to the inlet of a spring- actuated valve through a metallic connecting tube. The spring-actuated valve has an outlet adapted to be connected with a carburetor of the moped engine. Another outlet is provided at the bottom of the spring actuated valve adapted to be connected with the piston and cylinder assembly. Means comprising a Y shaped component are provided for mixing the LPG fuel with the lubricating oil, so as to lubricate the engine during the operation thereof.<br><br>
Detailed Description of the Invention<br>
The Gas Kit device according to a preferred embodiment of the invention is herein described and illustrated in the accompanying drawings wherein;<br>
Fig 1. Shows the sectional view of the gas Kit device.<br>
Referring to the drawings, Fig. 1 the gas kit of this invention has a gas controlled chamber 1 having an inlet 2 provided at one side thereof. The inlet 2 having a metallic connecting pipe 3 provided therewith is adapted to be connected with a LPG gas cylinder 4. A partition 5 having a check valve 6 provided therewith is disposed towards the inlet end so as to constitute a gas chamber 7. A spring-loaded piston 8 is disposed within said chamber at the other end thereof so as to constitute a pressurized gas chamber. An outlet 10 is provided in the pressurized gas chamber 9 and is connected with the inlet 11 of a spring actuated valve 12. An outlet 13 is provided with the valve 12 to connect the valve with the carburetor of the engine (not shown). An outlet 14 is provided at the bottom side of the spring-actuated valve 12 for connecting the same directly with the piston cylinder assembly of the engine. The spring-actuated valve 12 has a rubber plate 15 disposed between the sides of the valve 12. A spring 16 is provided between the sides to keep the rubber plate in position within the valve 12.<br>
When the vehicle runs on the petrol mode the lubrication for the cylinder is achieved by mixing the engine oil in the petrol fuel at the time of refueling of the vehicle in a conventional manner. When the vehicle runs on the LPG mode a separate arrangement is provided for lubricating the cylinder. A separate oil container is provided for the lubricating oil, and the outlet of which is connected to the Y shaped component provided for facilitating the mixing of the lubricating oil with the LPG gas.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
We claim:-<br>
1.       A gas kit for two wheelers comprising a main chamber having an inlet<br>
provided at one side thereof such that to be connected with a gas cylinder characterized by a separator being disposed towards the inlet end of the said main chamber for constituting a gas chamber therein, a spring-loaded piston being disposed in said main chamber towards the other end thereof so as to constitute a pressurized gas chamber, an outlet being provided in said pressurized gas chamber such that to be connected with an spring actuated valve being provided for supplying the gas to the piston cylinder assembly and also to the carburetor of the engine of the vehicle.<br>
2.	A gas kit as claimed in claim 1 wherein said partition has a check valve or a<br>
non-return valve provided therewith for facilitating the supply of gas from the<br>
gas chamber to the pressurized gas chamber provided in said main chamber.<br>
3.	A gas kit as claimed in claim 1 wherein said outlet of the pressurized gas<br>
chamber being connected to the inlet of said spring actuated valve by means<br>
 of a metallic tube.<br>
4.	A gas kit as claimed in claim 1 wherein said spring actuated valve comprises a<br>
pair of plates comprises a pair of side plates secured with each other, a rubber<br>
plate having a spring provided therewith is disposed within said side plates.<br>
5.	      A gas kit as claimed in claim 4 wherein an outlet is provided in the plate of<br>
the inlet side and at the bottom end of said sides to connect the same with the carburetor and piston cylinder assembly of the engine respectively.<br>
6.	A gas kit device for vehicles substantially as herein described and illustrated<br>
in the accompanying drawings.<br></td>
