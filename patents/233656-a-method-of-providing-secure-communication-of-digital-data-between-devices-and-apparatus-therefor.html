				<td>A METHOD OF PROVIDING SECURE COMMUNICATION OF<br>
DIGITAL DATA BETWEEN DEVICES AND APPARATUS THEREFOR<br>
The present invention relates to a method of providing secure<br>
communication of digital data between devices and apparatus for providing<br>
secure communication of digital data between devices. More specifically, the<br>
present invention relates to preventing illegal copying and redistribution of<br>
digitally recorded data.<br>
The introduction of digital technology in the audiovisual field has brought considerable<br>
advantages to the consumer in comparison with analog technologies, notably in<br>
relation to the quality of reproduction of sound and image and the durability of the<br>
supporting medium. The compact disk has all but replaced traditional vinyl records<br>
and a similar trend is expected with the introduction of new digital products aimed at<br>
the multimedia and home entertainment markets generally, notably the DVD (digital<br>
video disk or digital versatile disk) players.<br>
A particular problem associated with digitally recorded data lies in its ease of<br>
reproduction and the possibilities for piracy that arise therefrom. A single digital<br>
recording may be used to make any number of perfect copies without any degradation<br>
in quality of the sound or image. This problem is a serious one, particularly with the<br>
advent of recordable digital products such as the minidisk or DAT, and the reluctance<br>
of entertainment companies to license copyright works whilst this problem remains has<br>
acted as a break on the introduction into the market of new media products.<br>
At present, the most practically available solution against unauthorised reproduction<br>
of copyright works has been a legal one, and a number of countries in Europe and<br>
elsewhere have introduced anti-piracy legislation to combat the increasing number of<br>
pirate films, CDs etc being brought onto the market. For obvious reasons, a legal<br>
solution is less than optimal from the point of view of preventative action.<br>
Technological solutions proposed to date to prevent the unauthorised copying and<br>
distribution of digitally recorded data have been extremely basic, relying for example<br><br>
on the idea of using some form of digital " handshake " between devices in the digital<br>
audiovisual system, for example, between the digital data, or DVD, player and the<br>
digital recorder, and between the DVD player and the digital television, so as to verify<br>
the origin of the device receiving the data from "the DVD piayer. Such protection is,<br>
however, effective against only the most low level of copying activity, since the<br>
handshake signal is typically not protected in any way and may be easily read and<br>
reproduced so as to convert, for example, an unauthorised recorder device into an<br>
apparently authorised recorder device.<br>
The aim of the present invention is to overcome the disadvantages associated with the<br>
prior art techniques and to provide a technological solution against the unauthorised<br>
copying and reproduction of digitally recorded copyright works.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of providing secure<br>
communication of digital data between devices, said method comprising the<br>
steps of communicating from one device among other devices, an identifier of<br>
said one device to an independent security module and performing device<br>
validation depending on the identity of the communicated identifier.<br>
In such a method, a independent security module is used to validate a device in, for<br>
example, a digital audiovisual system. For example, in a system in which data is<br>
communicated from a DVD player to a digital recorder, the user of the system might<br>
possess an appropriate smartcard for validating the recorder and/or the player before<br>
any data is transferred. Thus, by using a security module to validate devices, an extra<br>
level of security can be added to the system.<br>
Indeed, the use of an independent security module can lead to a highly personalized<br>
digital audiovisual system. For instance, the security module may enable data to be<br>
transferred from a DVD player to a digital television only if both the player and<br>
television are validated by the security module, thus enabling the digital data to be<br>
viewed only on the user's personal television.<br><br>
The use of a security module to validate linked devices also provides an advantage in<br>
that device validation can become independent of the link between the devices. Thus,<br>
if the communication link is intercepted bv a third party, the identifiers of the devices<br>
cannot be obtained as they are not passed between the devices but from the individual<br>
devices to a security module.<br>
Such security modules can take any convenient form depending on the physical size<br>
and characteristics of the modules. For example, the security module may be<br>
detachable, for example removably insertable into a socket provided in the device or<br>
a separate module connected to the device. In some cases a smart card equivalent to<br>
a bank card may be used (as or as part of the security module), but other formats, such<br>
as PCMCIA type cards, are equally possible. Thus, the security module may be easily<br>
replaced in order to update the rights provided by the security module, for example<br>
to invalidate certain devices in the event of the system provider becoming aware of<br>
cloning of those devices.<br>
The device identifier may take any convenient form. For example, the identifier may<br>
be a public key associated with the device.<br>
The security module may perform device validation by comparing the communicated<br>
identifier with at least one stored identifier. The stored identifiers may be stored in<br>
a memory oFthe security module. The identifiers may be stored in the form of a list,<br>
the received identifier being compared with the identifiers in the list in order to<br>
validate the device. This can provide for fast and efficient validation of the deviee.<br>
Each stored identifier may be associated with a respective one of a valid device or an<br>
invalid device. Upon receipt of the identifier, the security module may compare the<br>
received identifier with stored identifiers associated with invalid devices, and/or with<br>
stored identifiers associated with valid devices.<br>
Thus, the security module may contain at least one of a "revocation list" for<br>
blacklisting non-compliant devices and an "authorization list" for restricting transfer<br><br>
of data to between pre-registered devices only. Device identifiers intentionally<br>
published by third parties, for example, on the Internet, can be added to the revocation<br>
list when periodically updating the security module in order to prevent data from being<br>
transferred to or from these devices.. However, the use of an authorization list can also<br>
prevent device identifiers intentionally published on the Internet from working since<br>
these identifiers will not be valid anywhere except in, for example, a home network.<br>
The authorization list is therefore likely to be much shorter than the revocation list,<br>
thus saving memory capacity, and is likely to require less-frequent updating. Thus,<br>
in a second aspect the present invention provides a method of providing secure<br>
communication of digital data between devices, said method comprising the steps of<br>
comparing an identifier communicated from one device with at least one stored<br>
identifier, each stored identifier being associated with a respective valid device, and"<br>
validating the device if the communicated identifier is identical to the or one of the<br>
stored identifiers.<br>
It is preferable that said at least one stored identifier is stored in an independent<br>
security module.<br>
The communicated identifier may be compared with identifiers associated with valid<br>
devices according to the setting of a flag. The flag may be stored within the security<br>
module or may be transmitted to the security module by the device.<br>
For example, the security module may compare the received identifier with stored<br>
identifiers associated with invalid devices when the flag has a first setting, and<br>
compare the received identifier with stored identifiers associated with valid devices<br>
when the flag has a second setting.<br>
The flag may be set according to rights provided to the user. For example, the flag<br>
may take the first setting for a shop wherein a number of different devices are used,<br>
the setting of the flag being such that the received identifier is compared with stored<br>
identifiers associated with invalid devices only. The flag may take the second setting<br><br>
for a home user wherein only a small number of devices are used, the setting of the<br>
flag being such that the received identifier is compared with stored identifiers<br>
associated with valid devices only.<br>
In one embodiment, the security module may compare the received identifier with<br>
stored identifiers associated with invalid devices when the flag has a setting "0". and<br>
compare the received identifier with both stored identifiers associated with invalid<br>
devices and stored identifiers associated with valid devices when the flag has a setting<br>
In a preferred embodiment of the invention, certificates are passed between the device<br>
and the security module to validate the device.<br>
The use of a certificate system to validate a device can provide for secure transmission<br>
of the identifier from the device to the security module. Thus, the identifier of the<br>
device may be communicated to the security module in an encrypted certificate, and<br>
so problems associated with the transmission of identifiers of devices "in the clear"<br>
can be avoided.<br>
The certificate may be signed, for example, using a private key, such as a private key<br>
of the manufacturer of the device, to enable the authenticity of the communicated<br>
certificate to be verified. Thus, if the security module determines that the data<br>
contained in the certificate and its signature do not correlate, the certificate can be<br>
rejected.<br>
An equivalent key to the private key may be communicated to the security module in<br>
a certificate encrypted by a system private key, a system public key being stored in<br>
both the security module and the device.<br>
The encrypted certificate is preferably further encrypted by the device using a security<br>
module public key and communicated to the security module. The encrypted<br>
certificate may be subsequently decrypted by the security module first using a security<br><br>
module private key and secondly using said equivalent key to enable the identifier of<br>
the device to be extracted from the decrypted certificate.<br>
The public key of the security module" may be communicated by the security module<br>
to the device in a certificate. The certificate including the public key of the security<br>
module may be encrypted using a private key, for example, of the manufacturer of the<br>
security module. This certificate may also be signed using the private key to enable<br>
the authenticity of the communicated certificate to be verified. An equivalent key to<br>
the private key may be communicated to the device in a certificate encrypted by the<br>
system private key, the system public key being stored in both the security module and<br>
the device.<br>
The certificate containing the device identifier may be randomised by the device prior<br>
to encryption, the randomisation being reversed by the security module following<br>
decryption of the certificate. This can increase the security of the passing of the<br>
device identifier from the device to the security module.<br>
In addition to verifying a device, the security module may transfer information to a<br>
device in order, for example, to enable the device to process digital data received from<br>
another device. Thus, it is preferable to create a secure communication channel<br>
between the device and the security module.<br>
In one preferred embodiment of the present invention, a random number is generated<br>
by the device, the random number and the certificate containing the device identifier<br>
being encrypted by the device using a public key of the security module and<br>
communicated to the security module. The encrypted random number and certificate<br>
may be decrypted by the security module using a private key of the security module<br>
to obtain the random number and to enable the identifier of the device to be extracted<br>
from the decrypted certificate.<br>
The extracted random number may subsequently be stored in the security module such<br>
that data communicated between the security module and the device may thereafter be<br><br>
encrypted and decrypted by the random number in the security module and the device,<br>
thereby providing a secure communication link between the device and the security<br>
module.<br>
Thus, in a third aspect the present invention provides a method of providing secure<br>
communication of digital data between a device and a security module, said method<br>
comprising the steps of transferring to the security module a random number and an<br>
identifier of the device encrypted by a public key of the security module, the security<br>
module decrypting the random number and device identifier using a private key of the<br>
security module, validating the device using the device identifier and, upon validation<br>
of the device, using the random number to encrypt and decrypt data communicated<br>
between the security module and the device.<br>
Preferably, the device identifier is included in a certificate, the certificate being<br>
encrypted using the public key of the security module.<br>
The random number may be randomised by the device prior to encryption, the<br>
randomisation being reversed by the security module following decryption of the<br>
random number.<br>
Alternatively, the random number and the certificate containing the device identifier<br>
may be randomised by the device prior to encryption, the randomisation being<br>
reversed by the security module following decryption of the random number and<br>
certificate.<br>
In order to increase the security of the communication link between the device and the<br>
security module, the security module may communicate to the device a random key<br>
generated in the security module and encrypted using the random number, the device<br>
decrypting the key using the random number and thereafter using the key to encrypt<br>
data sent to the security module.<br>
In addition to validating a device and for secure communication of data between the<br><br>
device and the security module, the security module may be adapted to provide access<br>
rights to data received by the device.<br>
For example, the device may communicate to the security module an encrypted<br>
Entitlement Control Message (ECM) containing a control word for descrambling data,<br>
the device further encrypting the encrypted ECM using the key. Thus, ECMs<br>
transmitted between a device and a security module are encrypted twice, one of the<br>
encryption keys being generated by the security module and therefore unique to the<br>
device and the security module. This can provide significant improvements in the<br>
prevention of illegal copying and redistribution of ECMs.<br>
The security module may decrypt the encrypted ECM, extract the control word from<br>
the ECM and communicate to the device the control word encrypted using the key"<br>
This can enable a device such as a digital television to descramble scrambled data<br>
received from a DVD player. Moreover, the control word may always be passed to<br>
the device in encrypted form, the encryption being conducted using a key previously<br>
transmitted to the device following validation of the device. Therefore, the storage of<br>
additional public/private keys for encrypting and decrypting the control words, or<br>
personalization of the device to the security module (or vice versa) is not required.<br>
Alternatively, the device may communicate to the security module an encrypted<br>
extended Entitlement Control Message (XECM) containing extended Control<br>
Management Information (XCMI), or access rights, to data, the device further<br>
encrypting the encrypted XECM using the key. The security module may decrypt the<br>
encrypted XECM, modify the access rights contained in the XECM, encrypt the<br>
modified XECM and communicate to the device the encrypted modified XECM<br>
further encrypted using the key.<br>
Thus, the security module may modify access rights afforded to the device by an<br>
XECM. For example, if the device is a digital recorder device, these rights may<br>
include the prohibition of any subsequent re-recording of the stored data, the number<br><br>
of times which the stored data may be replayed, the expiry date of replay, etc.<br>
In order to enable the devices to function more effectively it is desired to provide a<br>
securised or encrypted communication link between the devices'. The implementation<br>
of a secure link between the devices can be used to enable information needed to<br>
prepare or play a recording to be passed freely between the devices. Unfortunately,<br>
the independence of activities between a manufacturer of a DVD player and a<br>
manufacturer of recording equipment responsible for the recorder may lead to a<br>
number of problems regarding the provision of encryption keys for this purpose.<br>
For example, a player manufacturer may not place sufficient confidence in the<br>
integrity of security at the manufacturing site of a recorder to entrust the manufacturer<br>
with, for example, a secret symmetric algorithm key needed by the recorder to decrypt<br>
communications encrypted using the equivalent key held by the DVD player.<br>
Furthermore, the separation of activities may make it impractical to envisage a<br>
situation in which the recorder is sent to a broadcast system manager for<br>
personalisation with the appropriate keys. For this reason, it is necessary to envisage<br>
a solution which allows the greatest independence of operation for the player and<br>
recorder.<br>
In order to solve such problems, in a preferred embodiment of the present invention,<br>
data is communicated between first and second devices, and upon validation of each<br>
device by the security module, the security module communicates to the first device<br>
a random key generated in the security module and encrypted using the random<br>
number generated by the first device, the first device decrypting the kev using the<br>
random number generated thereby, and communicates to the second device the key<br>
encrypted using the random number generated by the se device, the second device<br>
decrypting the key using the random nurnber generated thereby, the key thereafter<br>
being used to encrypt data communicated to the security module by the devices and<br>
data communicated between the devices.<br><br>
Accordingly, in a fourth aspect the present invention provides a method of providing<br>
secure communication of digital data between devices, said method comprising the<br>
step of providing a security module, generating a random key (SK) in the security<br>
module and encrypting data communicated between the devices using the random key.<br>
By this method, the generation of an encryption key for securing communication<br>
between the devices is performed by a security module in communication with the<br>
devices, and so key generation is performed independently of the devices.<br>
Such a method can provide a secure, flexible and upgradeable device interface-<br>
independent system for providing secure communication of digital data between<br>
devices. The system can be based on a smartcard for generating the session key, and<br>
therefore can be cheap and enable fast action against piracy by the ease of providing<br>
updated smartcards, particularly as the responsibility of updating security can be the<br>
responsibility of a dedicated smartcard provider and not the device manufacturers.<br>
The security module may communicate to each device the key encrypted using a<br>
random number generated by that device, the device decrypting the key using the<br>
random number.<br>
Each device may communicate to the security module the respective random number<br>
encrypted using a public key of the security module. The encrypted random number<br>
may be subsequently decrypted by the security module using a private key of the<br>
security module to obtain the random number. Each random number may be<br>
randomised by the respective device prior to encryption, the randomisation being<br>
reversed by the security module following decryption of the random number.<br>
Preferably, the security module validates each device before transmitting the key to<br>
each device. To enable such validation to be performed, each device preferably<br>
communicates an identifier thereof to the security module for validation of the device<br>
by the security module.<br>
The key may be periodically changed by the security module. The key may be<br><br>
updated, for example, on an hourly basis, or after a predetermined number of data<br>
packets are passed between the devices. This can provide further security to the data<br>
communication. Alternatively, the key may be randomly changed by the security<br>
module, for example, upon switching "the device on, disc insertion, zapping of the<br>
device by the user, establishment of a connection with the security module etc.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention is applied to a home network system,<br>
the devices corresponding to first and second consumer electronic devices adapted to<br>
transfer data therebetween via a communication link. The communication link<br>
between the two devices may take one of many forms, for example, a radio, telephone<br>
or infra-red link. However, preferably, the communication link is implemented by<br>
connection of the first and second devices on a bus, for example, a IEEE 1394 bus<br>
link.<br>
The first device may communicate to the second device scrambled audio and/or visual<br>
data and an encrypted Entitlement Control Message (ECM) containing a control word<br>
for descrambling the data, said data and said encrypted ECM being encrypted by the<br>
first device using the key.<br>
The second device may decrypt the data and the encrypted ECM using the key,<br>
separate the encrypted ECM from the data, and communicate to the security module<br>
the encrypted ECM re-encrypted using the key. The security module may decrypt the<br>
encrypted ECM, extract the control word from the ECM and communicate to the<br>
second device the control word encrypted using the key. In this embodiment, the first<br>
device may be a DVD player and the second device may be a digital television.<br>
Furthermore, the security module may modify the ECM and communicate to the<br>
second device the modified ECM encrypted using the key. In this embodiment, the<br>
first device may be a DVD player and the second device may be a digital recorder<br>
device.<br>
In a fifth aspect the present invention provides apparatus for providing secure<br><br>
communication of digital data between devices, said apparatus comprising a security<br>
module comprising means for receiving an identifier of a device and means for<br>
performing device validation depending on the identity of the received identifier.<br>
In a related aspect the present invention provides a security module for providing<br>
secure communication of digital data between devices and arranged to receive an<br>
identifier of a device and to perform device validation depending on the identity of the<br>
received identifier.<br>
In a sixth aspect the present invention provides apparatus for providing secure<br>
communication of digital data between devices, said apparatus comprising means for<br>
storing at least one identifier, each stored identifier being associated with a respective<br>
valid device, means for comparing an identifier of a device with said at least one<br>
stored identifier, and means for validating the device if the identifier of the device is<br>
identical to the or one of the stored identifiers.<br>
In a related aspect the present invention provides a security module for providing<br>
secure communication of digital data between devices and arranged to store at least<br>
one identifier, each stored identifier being associated with a respective valid device,<br>
to compare an identifier of a device with said at least one stored identifier, and to<br>
validate the device if the identifier of the device is identical to the or one of the stored<br>
identifiers.<br>
In a seventh aspect the present invention provides a system for providing secure<br>
communication of data between a device and a security module, said device<br>
comprising means for communicating to the security module a random number and<br>
an identifier of the device encrypted by a public key of the security module, the<br>
security module comprising means for decrypting the random number and device<br>
identifier using a private key of the security module, means for validating the device<br>
using the device identifier, and means for using the random number to encrypt and<br>
decrypt data communicated between the security module and the device.<br><br>
In a related aspect the present invention provides a security module arranged to receive<br>
a random number and an identifier of a device encrypted by a public key of the<br>
security module, decrypt the random number and device identifier using a private key<br>
of the security module; validate the device using the device identifier, and, upon<br>
validation of the device, use the random number to encrypt and decrypt data<br>
communicated between the security module and the device<br>
In an eighth aspect the present invention provides apparatus for providing secure<br>
communication of digital data between devices, said apparatus comprising the devices<br>
and a security module comprising means for generating a random key and means for<br>
communicating the random key to the devices, each device being arranged to encrypt<br>
data communicated between the devices using the random key.<br>
In a related aspect the present invention provides a security module for providing<br>
secure communication of digital data between devices and arranged to generate a<br>
random key (SK) for encrypting data communicated between the devices and to<br>
communicate the random key to the devices.<br>
Whilst the invention has been described with reference to a first and second device,<br>
it will be appreciated that the same principle may be used to set up a chain of<br>
communication between a series of such devices.<br>
Suitable algorithms for use in this invention for generating private/public keys may<br>
include RSA, Fiat-Shamir, or Diffie-Hellman, and suitable symmetric key algorithms<br>
may include DES type algorithms, for example. However, unless obligatory in view<br>
of the context or unless otherwise specified, no general distinction is made between<br>
keys associated with symmetric algorithms and those associated with public/private<br>
algorithms.<br>
The terms "scrambled" and "encrypted", and "control word" and "key" have been used<br>
at various parts in the text for the purpose of clarity of language. However, it will be<br>
understood that no fundamental distinction is to be made between "scrambled data"<br><br>
and "encrypted data" or between a "control word" and a "key".<br>
Additionally, the terms "encrypted" and "signed", and "decrypted" and "verified" have<br>
been used at various parts in the text for the purpose of clarity of language. However,<br>
it will be understood that no fundamental distinction is to be made between "encrypted<br>
data" and "signed data", and "decrypted data" and "verified data".<br>
Similarly, the term "equivalent key" is used to refer to a key adapted to decrypt data<br>
encrypted by a first mentioned key, or vice versa.<br>
Features described above relating to method aspects of the present invention can also<br>
be applied to apparatus aspects, and vice versa.<br>

Figure 11 shows the steps associated with the setting up of a secure communication<br>
link between a DVD player and a digital recorder and the subsequent operations<br>
carried out to descramble data received from the DVD player by the digital recorder.<br>
Referring to Figure 1, elements of a digital audiovisual system 10 for recordal and<br>
replaying of digital data will first be described. Whilst the invention will be discussed<br>
in relation to the playing of audiovisual data on a DVD player, it may also<br>
conveniently be applied, for example, to the playing of exclusive audio information<br>
subsequently recorded on a DAT or minidisc recorder or even to the communication<br>
of software recorded on the hard disc of a computer.<br>
Typically the audiovisual system comprises a DVD player 12 for the playback of<br>
digital audiovisual data stored, for example, on disk or tape. The DVD player is<br>
linked to a digital display 14 for the display of the data played by the DVD player 12.<br>
The display 14 is preferably provided in the form of a digital television. The<br>
communication link 16 between the player 12 and display 14 may take many forms,<br>
for example, a radio, telephone or infra-red link. However, preferably, the<br>
cqrnmunication link is implemented by connection of the player and television on a<br>
bus, for example, a IEEE 1394 bus link.<br>
The system additionally includes a digital recorder 18, such as a DVHS or DVD<br><br>
recorder, adapted to communicate with the DVD player 12, for example, via an IEEE<br>
1394 bus 20. The recorder 18 receives a digital recording support (not shown) on<br>
which information is recorded. The recorder 18 includes a direct link 22 to the display<br>
14. However, digital audiovisual data may be passed from the player. 12 to the<br>
recorder 18 prior to display.<br>
Whilst the elements of player 12, display 14 and recorder 18 have been indicated<br>
separately, it is conceivable that some or all of these elements may be merged, for<br>
example, to provide a combined player/television set.<br>
In order to provide secure communication of data between devices in the digital<br>
audiovisual system, for example, to prevent the unauthorised copying and distribution<br>
of digitally recorded data, a validation system is used to validate one or more of the<br>
devices in the audiovisual system prior to any communication of data between the<br>
devices.<br>
A preferred device validation system is based on the transfer of certificates between<br>
a device and a security module. With reference to Figure 2, each device and security<br>
module is assigned a unique certificate for validation purposes.<br>
In a first stage of a certificate distribution system a certification authority (CA) 50<br>
delivers encrypted certificates to both consumer electronics (CE) manufacturers 52 and<br>
security providers (SP) 54.<br>
The CA 50 communicates to each CE manufacturer 52 a respective encrypted<br>
certificate CertCA (CEman_Kpub) shown at 56. This certificate contains, inter alia, a<br>
manufacturer public key CEman_Kpub and is encrypted by a system, or CA, private<br>
key CA_Kpri. To enable the contents of the certificate to be decrypted by the CE<br>
manufacturer 52, the CA 50 communicates to the CE manufacturer 52 the CA public<br>
key CA_Kpub. It should be mentioned that the private key CA_Kpri is unique to and<br>
held exclusively by the CA 50.<br><br>
In a similar manner, the CA 50 communicates to each security provider 54 a<br>
respective encrypted certificate CertCA(SP_Kpub) shown at 58. This certificate<br>
contains, inter alia, a security provider public key SP_Kpub and is encrypted by the<br>
CA private key CA_Kpri. To enable the contents of the certificate to be decrypted by<br>
the security provider 54, the CA 50 communicates to the security provider 54 the CA<br>
public key CA_Kpub.<br>
In a second stage of the certificate distribution system, each consumer electronics (CE)<br>
manufacturer 52 and security provider (SP) 54 assigns respective certificates to its own<br>
products.<br>
Each CE manufacturer 52 assigns to each of its CE devices 60 a respective encrypted<br>
certificate CertCE5m(Device Kpub) shown at 62. This certificate contains, inter alia,"<br>
a unique device public key Device_Kpub, together with an indication of the device<br>
capability (recorder, player, etc.). The certificate is encrypted by an equivalent key to<br>
the public key CEman_Kpub. To enable the contents of the certificate to be<br>
decrypted, the CE manufacturer 52 stores in the CE device the CA public key<br>
CA_Kpub and the encrypted certificate CertCA(CEman_Kpub) of the CE manufacturer<br>
52. Thus, the public key Device_Kpub of the CE device 60 can serve as an identifier<br>
of the device.<br>
Similarly, each security provider 54 assigns to each security module 64 a respective<br>
encrypted certificate CertSP(SM_Kpub) shown at 66. Such security modules 66 can<br>
take any convenient form depending on the physical size and characteristics of the<br>
modules. For example, the security module may be removably insertable into a socket<br>
provided in a CE device 60 or may be a separate module connected to the device 60.<br>
In some cases a smart card equivalent to a bank card may be used, but other formats<br>
such as PCMCIA type cards are equally possible.<br>
The encrypted certificate assigned to the security module 64 contains, inter alia, a<br>
unique security module public key SM_Kpub. The certificate is encrypted by an<br>
equivalent key to the public key SP_Kpub. To enable the contents of the certificate<br><br>
to be decrypted, the security provider 54 stores in the security module 64 the CA<br>
public key CA_Kpub and the encrypted certificate CertCA(SP_Kpub) of the security<br>
provider. Thus, the public key SM_Kpub of the security module 64 can serve as an<br>
identifier of the security module.<br>
A signature may be included in any of the above certificates to enable the contents of<br>
the certificate to be verified following decryption of the certificate. The contents of<br>
the certificate may be signed using the key used to encrypt the certificate.<br>
Validation of a device in the digital audiovisual system is carried out by the exchange<br>
of certificates between the device and a security module. As shown in Figure 3, in<br>
a first embodiment the security module 64 is connected to the device 60 via a<br>
communication link 70 to enable the security module to validate that device only.<br>
However, as shown in Figure 4, the security module may alternatively be connected<br>
to two or more connected devices 60a, 60b via respective communication links 70a,<br>
70b.<br>
Validation of a single device by a security module will now be described with<br>
reference to Figure 5.<br>
The validation procedure can be initiated at any time, for example, upon switching the<br>
device on, disc insertion, zapping of the device by the user, establishment of<br>
connection with the security module etc.<br>
The validation procedure is initiated by the security module. As shown at 100, the<br>
security module 64 communicates to the device 60 the encrypted certificate<br>
CertCA(SP_Kpub) of the security provider 54. At 102, the device decrypts the contents<br>
of the encrypted certificate CertCA(SP_Kpub) using the public key CA_Kpub of the CA<br>
50 to enable the public key SP_Kpub of the security provider 54 to be extracted from<br>
the certificate.<br>
Following communication of the encrypted certificate CertCA_(SP_Kpub) to the device<br><br>
60, at 104 the security module 64 communicates its own unique encrypted certificate<br>
CertSP(SM_Kpub) to the device 60. At 106 the device decrypts the contents of the<br>
encrypted certificate CertSP(SM_Kpub) using the public key SP_Kpub of the security<br>
provider previously extracted by the device 60 from the encrypted certificate<br>
CertCA(SP_Kpub) in order to enable the public key SM__Kpub of the security module<br>
64 to be extracted from the certificate.<br>
At 108, the device 60 communicates to the security module 64 the encrypted<br>
certificate CertCA(CEman_Kpub) of the CE manufacturer 52. At 110, the security<br>
module 64 decrypts the encrypted certificate CertCA(CEman_Kpub) using the public<br>
key CA_Kpub of the CA 50 to enable the public key CEman_Kpub of the CE<br>
manufacturer 52 to be extracted from the certificate.<br>
Following communication of the encrypted certificate CertCA(CEman_Kpub) to the<br>
security module 64, at 112 the device 60 generates a random number X. The random<br>
number X performs no function in the validation of the device by the security module.<br>
Instead, the random number X is used to generate a secure authenticated channel<br>
(SAC) between the device 60 and the security module 64. This is described in more<br>
detail below.<br>
At 114 the device 60 performs bit shuffling of random number X and the encrypted<br>
certificate CertCEmim(Device_Kpub) stored in the device 60 in order to scramble the<br>
random number X and encrypted certificate CertCEman_(Device_Kpub). The bit shuffled<br>
random number X and encrypted certificate CertCEman_(Device_Kpub) are subsequently<br>
encrypted at 116 using the public key SM_Kpub of the security module 64 previously<br>
communicated to the device 60 by the security module at step 104, and communicates<br>
the encrypted bit shuffled random number and encrypted certificate<br>
CertCEman_(Device_Kpub) to the security module 64 at step 118.<br>
At 120, the security module 64 decrypts the encrypted bit shuffled random number and<br>
encrypted certificate CertCEman_(Device_Kpub) using an equivalent key SM_Kpriv to the<br>
public key SM_Kpub. The bit shuffling of the shuffled random number and encrypted<br><br>
certificate CertCEman(Device_Kpub) is reversed at step 122.<br>
An algorithm used to bit shuffle the random number X and encrypted certificate<br>
CertCEmm(Device_Kpub) may be stored in the security module 64 to enable the bit<br>
shuffling to be reversed. Alternatively, the security module 64 may send to the device<br>
60 a random number, referred to as a random challenge, Z, following receipt of the<br>
encrypted certificate CertCA(CEman_Kpub). The random challenge Z is bit shuffled<br>
by the device 60, encrypted using the security module public key SM_Kpub and<br>
transmitted to the security module, preferably at the same time as the bit shuffled<br>
random number X and encrypted certificate CertCEman(Device_Kpub). The security<br>
module 64 decrypts the encrypted shuffled random challenge Z and compares the bit<br>
shuffled random challenge with the unshuffled random challenge stored therein in<br>
order to determine how the random challenge Z has been shuffled by the device 60.<br>
The security module 64 uses the result of this challenge to reverse the bit shuffling<br>
applied to the random number X and encrypted certificate CertCA(CEman_Kpub) by<br>
the device.<br>
Returning to Figure 5, the random number is extracted and stored by the security<br>
module 64 at step 124. At 126, the security module 64 decrypts the encrypted<br>
certificate CertCEman(Device_Kpub) using the public key CEman_Kpub of the CE<br>
manufacturer 52 previously transmitted to the security module 64 by the device 60 in<br>
order to enable the public key Device_Kpub of the device 60 to be extracted from the<br>
certificate.<br>
Validation of the device 60 is carried out by the security module 64 using the public<br>
key Device_Kpub of the device 60 at step 128. The security module compares the<br>
received device public key Device_Kpub with a list of device public keys previously<br>
stored in the security module. The list of device public keys may be generated by the<br>
CA 50 and stored, for example, in memory, such as non-volatile memory, in the<br>
security module 64 by the security provider 54.<br>
The security module 64 supports two types of list. A "revocation list" contains device<br><br>
public keys associated with invalid devices and is used to blacklist non-compliant<br>
devices. An "authorization list" contains device public keys associated with valid<br>
devices and is used to restrict transfer of data to between pre-registered devices only.<br>
Device identifiers intentionally published by third parties, for example, on the Internet,<br>
can be added to the revocation list by the CA 50 when periodically updating the<br>
security module 64 in order to prevent data from being transferred to or from these<br>
devices or clones of these devices. However, the use of an authorization list can also<br>
prevent device identifiers intentionally published on the Internet from working since<br>
these identifiers will not be valid anywhere except in, for example, a home network.<br>
A flag embedded within the encrypted device certificate or the encrypted security<br>
module certificate determines the list with which the received device public key is<br>
compared. For example, the security module may compare the received device public<br>
key with stored public keys associated with invalid devices when the flag has a setting<br>
"0", and compare the received device public key with both stored public keys<br>
associated with invalid devices and stored public keys associated with valid devices<br>
when the flag has a setting "1".<br>
If the device 60 is determined to be an invalid device, the security module 64<br>
terminates communication with the device 60. If, as shown in Figure 4, the security<br>
module is in communication with other devices, communication with those devices is<br>
• also terminated.<br>
If the device is determined to be a valid device, the security module 64 generates a<br>
secure authenticated channel (SAC) of communication between the device 60 and the<br>
security module 64. Figure 6 shows the steps associated with the generation of a<br>
secure authenticated channel of communication between a device and a security<br>
module.<br>
In step 200 the security module 64 generates a random session key SK. The random<br>
session key SK is TDES encrypted at step 202 by the security module 64 using the<br><br>
random number X transmitted to the security module 64 by the device 60. The<br>
encrypted session key TDESX(SK) is transmitted to the device 60 at step 204.<br>
At step 206, the-device -60 decryets the encrypted session key TDESX(SK) using the<br>
random number X and stores the session key SK in memory at step 208. The session<br>
key SK is thereafter used to encrypt data transferred between the device 60 and the<br>
security module 64.<br>
Thus, following validation of the device, key distribution is undertaken by the security<br>
module in order to create a secure channel of communication between the device and<br>
the security module. Updating of the session key (SK) can also be initiated at any<br>
time, for example, upon switching the device on, disc insertion, zapping of the device<br>
by the user, establishment of connection with the security module etc.<br>
With reference to Figure 1, the DVD player 12 typically transmits scrambled data to<br>
the display 14 and recorder 18. The steps associated with the descrambling of data<br>
received by a device will now be described with reference to Figure 7,<br>
A DVD disk typically stores encrypted Entitlement Control Messages (ECMs) together<br>
with the scrambled audio and/or visual data. An ECM is a message related to the<br>
scrambled audio and/or visual data. The message contains a control word (which<br>
allows for the descrambling of the data) and the access criteria of the data. The access<br>
criteria and control word are transmitted by the DVD player 12 to, for example,<br>
display 14 via the communication link 16.<br>
The data stored on the disk typically comprises a number of distinct components; for<br>
example a television programme includes a video component, an audio component, a<br>
sub-title component and so on. Each of these components is individually scrambled<br>
and encrypted. In respect of each scrambled component of the data, a separate ECM<br>
is required. Alternatively, a single ECM may be required for all of the scrambled<br>
components of a service<br><br>
The control word typically changes every few seconds, and so ECMs are also<br>
periodically inserted in the data to enable the changing control word to be<br>
descrambled. For redundancy purposes, each ECM typically includes two control<br>
words; the present control word and the next control word.<br>
Upon receipt of scrambled data and an encrypted ECM from the DVD player 12, the<br>
display 14 extracts the ECM from the scrambled data and passes the extracted ECM<br>
to descrambling circuitry for decrypting the ECM and extracting the control word from<br>
the decrypted ECM.<br>
The descrambling circuitry may be implemented in a detachable conditional access<br>
module 40 or CAM, commonly embodied in the form of a PCMCIA, or PC, card<br>
insertable in a socket in the recipient device. Alternatively, the CAM 40 may be<br>
physically separate from the recipient device, the CAM 40 and display 14 being<br>
communicably linked by any suitable communication link 42, for example via a serial<br>
or parallel interface.<br>
The CAM 40 may itself further include a slot to receive a smart card. In such<br>
systems, the smartcard controls whether the end user has the right to decrypt the ECM<br>
and to access the programme. If the end user does have the rights, the ECM is<br>
decrypted by a processor 41 within the smart card and the control word extracted.<br>
The processor 41 of the CAM 40 may then descramble the scrambled data to supply<br>
the recipient device with a clear data stream for, for example, decompression and<br>
subsequent display. Alternatively, the descrambling of the data may be carried out<br>
within the display 14 using the control word information communicated to the display<br>
14 from the CAM 40.<br>
In the case where scrambled data is communicated from the DVD player 12 to the<br>
digital recorder 18 for subsequent viewing, the manufacturer of the DVD disk may<br>
wish to restrict access to the recorded data. For example, the disk manufacturer may<br>
wish to prohibit any further copying of the recorded data. In such situations, the<br>
access rights, or extended Control Management Information (XCMI), are contained<br><br>
is an extended Entitlement Control Message (XECM) which includes any access rights<br>
as determined by the disk manufacturer. Upon receipt of the XECM, the processor<br>
41 of the CAM 40 decrypts the XECM, modifies the XECM, for example to prohibit<br>
any copying of the recorded data, re-encrypts the ECM and passes the. modified, re-<br>
encrypted ECM back to the recorder device.<br>
In this type of system, sensitive data (control words, modified XECMs or descrambled<br>
data) may be passed between the CAM and the display 14 or recorder 18 and<br>
problems of security may arise at this interface. To overcome such problems, prior<br>
to communication of any data, for example, an ECM from the display 14 to the<br>
smartcard, a secure authenticated channel (SAC) 42 is created, as described above with<br>
reference to Figures 5 and 6, between the display 14 and the CAM 40. In order to<br>
create the SAC 42 between the display 14 and the CAM 40, the CAM 40 must store,<br>
for example in the smartcard, the list of device public keys in order to validate the<br>
display 14.<br>
As shown in Figure 4, the security module may be connected to two or more<br>
connected devices 60a, 60b via respective communication links 70a, 70b. As well as<br>
validating both of these devices, each device being validated as described in Figure 5,<br>
the security module can create a secure communication channel between the devices.<br>
Figure 8 shows the steps associated with the provision of secure communication<br>
between two devices.<br>
The provision of secure communication between device A 60a and device B 60b is<br>
carried out after both of the devices 60a, 60b have been validated by the security<br>
module. With reference to Figure 8, at step 300 the security module 64 generates a<br>
random session key SK. The random session key SK is encrypted at step 302 by the<br>
security module 64 using the random number X transmitted to the security module 64<br>
by the device A 60a during validation of the device. The encryption is preferably<br>
conducted using a symmetric algorithm, such as Triple DES (TDES).<br>
The encrypted session key TDESX(SK) is transmitted to the device A 60a at step 304.<br><br>
At step 306, the device A 60a decrypts the encrypted session key TDES:c(SK) using<br>
the random number X and stores the session key SK in memory.<br>
At step 308, the random session key SK is additionally TDES encrypted by the<br>
security module 64 using random number Y transmitted to the security module 64 by<br>
the device B 60b during validation of the device. The encrypted session key<br>
TDESY(SK) is transmitted to the device B 60b at step 310. At step 312, the device<br>
B 60b decrypts the encrypted session key TDESX(SK) using the random number Y and<br>
stores the session key SK in memory.<br>
Thus, the session key SK is transmitted to each device over a respective SAC. The<br>
session key SK can then be used by, for example, device A 60a to encrypt data<br>
transmitted to device B 60b via communication link 75.<br>
With reference to Figure 9, at step 400, device 60a encrypts data D using the session<br>
key SK. The encryption algorithm used in a symmetric algorithm, such as Triple DES<br>
(TDES) algorithm or such like.<br>
The encrypted data TDESSK(D) is transmitted to device 60b via communication link<br>
75 at step 402. At step 404, device B 60b decrypts the encrypted data TDESSK(D)<br>
using the session key SK to obtain the data D.<br>
As discussed above, there is no generation of session keys by any of the devices;<br>
session keys are generated only by the security module. Therefore, the above method<br>
provides a very simple but yet secure method of providing secure communication<br>
between devices, as the data transmitted by one device can only be decrypted by a<br>
device which has established a secure authenticated channel with the same security<br>
module as that one device.<br>
As discussed with reference to Figure 7, in addition to carrying out validation of<br>
devices and the creation of SACs, the security module may transmit control words,<br>
access rights and/or scrambled data to a device. Figures 10 and 11 illustrate examples<br><br>
in which a security module sets up a secure communication link between two devices<br>
and subsequently transmits data associated with scrambled data to a device.<br>
Figure 10 shows, in a first example, the steps associated with the setting up of a<br>
secure communication link between a DVD player and a digital television and the<br>
subsequent operations carried out to descramble data received from the DVD player<br>
by the digital television.<br>
In step 500, the security module 64 determines the validity of each of the DVD player<br>
12 and the digital TV 14, using steps as described above with reference to Figure 5.<br>
If the two devices are determined to be valid, the security module 64 establishes<br>
secure authenticated channels (SACs) with the DVD player 12 and the digital TV,<br>
using the steps as described above with reference to Figure 6. As a result of<br>
establishing the SACs, a session key SK is stored in each of the devices and in the<br>
security module.<br>
In step 502, data comprising Control System Scrambled (CSS) data and proprietary<br>
encrypted ECMs containing control words for descrambling the data are encrypted by<br>
the DVD player 12 using the session key SK and transmitted to the digital TV via the<br>
communication link 16.<br>
The encrypted data is received by the digital TV 14 in step 504 and decrypted using<br>
the session key SK. The scrambled data is passed to a demultiplexer 90 which, in step<br>
506, separates the CSS data from the encrypted ECMs. The encrypted ECMs are<br>
passed over the SAC by the digital TV 14 to the security module 64 in step 508. For<br>
transfer to the security module 64 over the SAC, the encrypted ECMs are further<br>
encrypted by the digital TV 14 using the session key SK generated by the security<br>
module 64.<br>
As shown in Figure 10, the security module is notionally divided into a standardized<br>
security part 66 and a proprietary security part 68. The twice-encrypted ECMs are<br>
received at the standardized security part 66 in step 510 and decrypted once using the<br><br>
session key SK. In step 512, the proprietary encrypted ECMs are passed to the<br>
proprietary security part 68 which, in step 514, decrypts and validates the encrypted<br>
ECMs using an equivalent key to the proprietor's key used to encrypt the ECMs, and<br>
processes the ECM, if authorised, to extract the control words, or CSS keys, from the<br>
ECM.<br>
In step 516, the CSS keys are passed to the standardized security part 66 which<br>
encrypts the CSS keys using the session key SK and passes the encrypted CSS keys<br>
to the digital TV 14 over the SAC. The received encrypted CSS keys are decrypted<br>
by the digital TV 14 using the session key at step 518 and subsequently passed to a<br>
descrambler 92 for use in descrambling the CSS data. At 520, the descrambled data<br>
is transmitted to display 94 for display.<br>
As will be readily understood from the above, control words are always encrypted<br>
using the session key SK before being transmitted between any of the devices and the<br>
security module.<br>
In the above example, the control words are contained in ECMs. However, the ECMs<br>
may be contained in XECMs together with XCMI, or access rights, which are<br>
processed by the proprietary security part 68, for example, to determine whether the<br>
user's rights to view the data have expired.<br>
Figure 11 shows, in the second example, the steps associated with the setting up of a<br>
secure communication link between a DVD player and a digital recorder and the<br>
subsequent operations carried out to descramble data received from the DVD player<br>
by the digital recorder.<br>
In step 600, the security module 64 determines the validity of each of the DVD player<br>
12 and the digital recorder 18, using steps as described above with reference to Figure<br>
5. If the two devices are determined to be valid, the security module 64 establishes<br>
secure authenticated channels (SACs) with the DVD player 12 and the digital recorder<br>
18, using the steps as described above with reference to Figure 6. As a result of<br><br>
establishing the SACs, a session key SK is stored in each of the devices and in the<br>
security module.<br>
In step 602, data comprising Contro System Scrambled (CSS) data and proprietary<br>
encrypted XECMs containing control words for descrambling the data and XCMI are<br>
encrypted by the DVD player 12 using the session key SK and transmitted to the<br>
recorder via the communication link 20.<br>
The encrypted data is received by the recorder 18 in step 604 and decrypted using the<br>
session key SK. The scrambled data is passed to a demultiplexer 90 which, in step<br>
606, separates the CSS data from the encrypted XECMs. The encrypted XECMs are<br>
passed over the SAC by the recorder 18 to the security module 64 in step 608. For<br>
transfer to the security module 64 over the SAC , the encrypted XECMs are further<br>
encrypted by the recorder 18 using the session key SK generated by the security<br>
module 64.<br>
As shown in Figure 11, the security module is notionally divided into a standardized<br>
security part 66 and a proprietary security part 68. The twice-encrypted XECMs are<br>
received at the standardized security part 66 in step 610 and decrypted once using the<br>
session key SK. In step 512, the proprietary encrypted XECMs are passed to the<br>
proprietary security part 68 which, in step 614, decrypts and validates the encrypted<br>
XECMs using an equivalent key to the proprietor's key used to encrypt the XECMs,<br>
and processes the XECMs, if authorised, to update the XCMI, for example, to limit<br>
the number of times which the user may replay the data, to prohibit any farther re-<br>
recording of the data etc.<br>
In step 616, the modified XECMs are encrypted using a proprietary algorithm PA and<br>
a user key 96 stored in the security module 68. This adds security to the data<br>
recorded by the recorder 18; the control words for descrambling the CSS data can only<br>
be extracted from the modified XECM if the user has access to the user key. Thus,<br>
playback and viewing of the recorded data is restricted to the holder of the security<br>
module.<br><br>
In step 618, the encrypted XECMs are passed to the standardized security part 66<br>
which further encrypts the encrypted XECMs using the session key SK and passes the<br>
encrypted XECMs to the recorder over the SAC. The received encrypted XECMs are<br>
decrypted once by the recorder using the session key at step 620 and subsequently<br>
passed to a recording medium 98, such as DAT tape, for storing the CSS data and the<br>
encrypted XECMs.<br>
It will be understood that the present invention has been described above purely by<br>
way of example, and modifications of detail can be made within the scope of the<br>
invention.<br>
For example, whilst the above examples have described the provision of a<br>
communication link between devices using an IEEE 1394 digital interface,<br>
unidirectional links such as 8-VSB and 16-VSB may also be used.<br>
It is not essential for a device to pass certificates directly to a security module. For<br>
example, where a first device is unable to receive data from a security module, the<br>
first device may pass its certificates to a second device in two-way communication<br>
with the security module for validation of the first device.<br>
In the described examples, only one security module is provided. However, different<br>
security modules may coexist within a network comprised of a number of devices<br>
connected via various interfaces.<br>
Each feature disclosed in the description, and (where appropriate) the claims and<br>
drawings may be provided independently or in any appropriate combination.<br><br>
