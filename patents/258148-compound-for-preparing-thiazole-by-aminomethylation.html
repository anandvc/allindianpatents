wherein X1 represents a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, is a useful compound as an intermediate for Pharmaceuticals and agrochemicals (see, e.g., JP 7-14916 B). For preparing the thiazole compound, several processes have been known. For example, (a) a compound of formula (1):<br><br>
wherein X1 is as defined above, and X2 represents a halogen atom, is reacted with hexamethylenetetramine, followed by hydrolysis (see, e.g., JP 4-234864 A and JP 4-21674 A); (b) the compound of formula (1) is reacted with potassium phthalimide, followed by hydrazinolysis (see, e.g., JP 4-<br><br>
34864 A); (c) the compound of formula (1) is reacted with Drmamide, followed by hydrolysis (see, e.g., JP 5-286936 ); and (d) the compound of formula (1) is reacted with mmonia (see, e.g., JP 4-234864 A and JP 2000-143648 A).<br>
However, the above processes (a) to (c) are not ecessarily satisfactory from an industrial point of view ecause yields of the target thiazole compound of formula 3) are low in these processes. Although the above process d) has an advantage over the processes (a) to (c) because f the use of low-priced ammonia, a considerable amount of by-product compound of formula (4):<br><br>
‘herein X1 is as defined above, is formed even when using immonia in 20 mol-fold amount or more relative to the :ompound of formula (1), which results in a low yield of :he target thiazole compound of formula (3). Therefore, further improvement has been -desired.<br>
)isclosure of Invention<br>
Under these circumstances, the present inventors have studied intensively to develop an industrially advantageous Process for preparing the thiazole compound of formula (3) ising low-priced ammonia with suppressing the formation of :he by-product, i.e., the compound of formula (4), and have<br><br>
found that the target thiazole compound of formula (3) can be prepared with suppressing the formation of the by-product, the compound of formula (4), by reacting the compound of formula (1) with ammonia and formaldehyde, which is also low-priced and readily available, to obtain a hexahydrotriazine compound, which is a novel compound, of formula (2):<br><br>
wherein X1 is as defined above, and then hydrolyzing the hexahydrotriazine compound of formula (2). Thus, the present invention have been completed.<br>
That is, the present invention provides a process for preparing a thiazole compound of formula (3):<br><br>
wherein X1 is as defined above, which comprises the steps of:<br>
reacting a compound of formula (1):<br><br><br>
wherein X1 represents a hydrogen atom, or a halogen atom, and X2 represents a halogen atom, with ammonia and formaldehyde to obtain a hexahydrotriazine compound of formula (2):<br><br>
wherein X1 is as defined above, and hydrolyzing the resulting hexahydrotriazine compound of formula (2)-<br>
Best Mode for Carrying Out the Invention<br>
First, the step for reacting a compound of formula (1) :<br><br>
wherein X1 represents a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, and X2 represents a halogen atom (hereinafter, abbreviated as compound (1)), with ammonia and formaldehyde to obtain a hexahydrotriazine compound of formula (2):<br><br><br>
wherein X1 is as defined above (hereinafter, abbreviated as hexahydrotriazine compound (2)), will be explained.<br>
In compound (1) , X1 represents a hydrogen atom or a halogen atom, and X2 represents a halogen atom. Examples of the halogen atom include a chlorine atom, a bromine atom, an iodine atom, and the like.<br>
Examples of compound (1) include, for example, 5-(chloromethyl)thiazole, 2-chloro-5-(chloromethyl)thiazole, 2-chloro-5-(bromomethyl)thiazole, 2-bromo-5-(bromomethyl)thiazole, 2-chloro-5-(iodomethyl)thiazole, 2-bromo-5- (iodomethyl) thiazole, 2-iodo-5- (iodomethyl) thiazole-, and the like.<br>
Compound (1) can be prepared according to a known method, for example, the method described in JP 4-234864 A.<br>
Compound (1) may be in the free form, or may be in an acid addition salt form. Examples of the acid of acid addition salt include inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, sulfuric acid, perchloric acid, and the like; and organic acids such as acetic acid,<br><br>
methanesulfonic acid, trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, p-toluenesulfonic acid, and the like.<br>
As ammonia, ammonia gas may be used, or liquid ammonia may be used. Further, ammonia water may be used, or a solution of ammonia in an organic solvent that can solubilize ammonia such as methanol may be used. From a viewpoint of ease of handling and yield, a solution of ammonia in an organic solvent is preferably used.<br>
Ammonia is usually used in the amount of 1 to 30 moles, preferably 2 to 15 moles, and more preferably 2 to 10 moles per mol of compound (1). In case of using compound (1) in the form of an acid addition salt, the amount of ammonia that may be used can be determined by taking the acid in acid addition salt into consideration.<br>
As formaldehyde, formaldehyde gas may be used, but from a viewpoint of handling, paraformaldehyde or formalin is preferably used, and paraformaldehyde is more preferably used. Formaldehyde is usually used in the amount of 1 to 10 moles, preferably 1 to 8 moles, and more preferably 1 to 5 moles per mol of compound (1). Further, preferably, the amount of formaldehyde that may be used per mol of compound (1) is smaller than that of ammonia.<br>
The reaction temperature is usually 15 to 100°C, preferably 20 to 90°C. The reaction is usually carried out at atmospheric pressure or under pressure of not higher<br><br>
than 0.5 MPa (gauge pressure).<br>
The reaction may be carried out with no solvent, but preferably carried out in an inert solvent- Examples of the solvent include, for example, alcohols such as methanol, ethanol, n-propanol, isopropanol, and the like; aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, and the like; halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, and the like; aliphatic hydrocarbons such as hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, and the like; ethers such as diethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane, and the like; aprotic polar solvents such as acetonitrile, propionitrile, dimethylsulfoxide, N,N-dimethyl acetamide, and the like; and water. They can be used alone or as a mixture of the solvents. Alcohols and water are preferable, and alcohols are more preferable. The amount of the solvent that may be used is us.ually 1 to 10 parts by weight per part by weight of compound (1)-<br>
The reaction is usually carried out by mixing and bringing compound (1) into contact’ with ammonia and formaldehyde, and the order of mixing thereof is not specifically limited. For example, compound (1) may be mixed with ammonia and formaldehyde to carry out the reaction at a given temperature, or compound (1) mixed in advance with formaldehyde may be added to ammonia to carry out the reaction. Alternatively, ammonia and formaldehyde<br><br>
may be mixed and to this mixture is added compound (1) to carry out the reaction. Further, to formaldehyde may be added compound (1) and ammonia simultaneously to carry out the reaction. Furthermore, to ammonia may be added compound (1) and formaldehyde simultaneously to carry out the reaction.<br>
If necessary, the reaction may be carried out in the presence of a quaternary ammonium salt such as triethylbenzylammonium chloride, tri-n-octylmethylammonium chloride, trimethyldecylammonium chloride,<br>
tetramethylammonium bromide, tetra-n-butylammonium bromide, or the like; or a phase transfer catalyst such as crown ether, or the like.<br>
It is considered that, by this reaction, a<br>
methyleneimine compound which is an unstable intermediate, and of formula (5):<br><br>
wherein X1 is as defined above, is formed, followed by trimerization thereof to form hexahydrotriazine compound (2) .<br>
After completion of the reaction, a reaction mixture containing hexahydrotriazine compound (2) is obtained, and hexahydrotriazine compound (2) can be isolated by, for example, concentrating the reaction mixture. Alternatively,<br><br>
hexahydrotriazine compound (2) can be isolated as crystals by cooling the reaction mixture as it is or after partial concentration. Further, hexahydrotriazine compound (2) can be isolated by adding water and a hydrophobic organic solvent to the reaction mixture as it is or after concentration thereof to subject the mixture to extraction treatment, and concentrating the resulting organic layer. Furthermore, hexahydrotriazine compound (2) can be isolated as an acid addition salt such as its hydrochloride, sulfate, or the like.<br>
Examples of the hydrophobic organic solvent include halogenated hydrocarbons such as chlorobenzene, dichlorobenzene, and the like; esters such as ethyl acetate, butyl acetate, and the like; ketones such as methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone, and the like; and aromatic hydrocarbons such as toluene, xylene, and the like. They can be used alone or as a mixture of the solvents. The amount thereof that may be used is not specifically limited.<br>
Alternatively, without isolating hexahydrotriazine compound (2) from the reaction mixture, the reaction mixture or an organic layer containing hexahydrotriazine compound (2) may be used in the subsequent hydrolyzing step described hereinafter.<br>
Examples of hexahydrotriazine compound (2) thus obtained include, for example, 1,3,5-tris{(thiazol-5-<br><br>
yl)methyl}-l,3, 5-hexahydrotriazine, 1,3,5-tris{ (2-chlorothiazol-5-yl)methyl}-l,3,5-hexahydrotriazine, 1,3,5-tris{ (2-bromothiazol-5~yl)methyl}-l, 3, 5-hexahydrotriazine, and the like.<br>
Next, the step for preparing the thiazole compound of formula (3):<br><br>
wherein X1 is as defined above (hereinafter, abbreviated as thiazole compound (3)), by hydrolyzing hexahydrotriazine compound (2) obtained will be explained.<br>
This step is hydrolysis of hexahydrotriazine compound (2) obtained in the previous step to convert it into thiazole compound (3), and usually carried out by mixing . hexahydrotriazine compound (2) and an aqueous solution of an acid to allow to come into contact with each other. Examples of the aqueous solution of an acid include, for example, an aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, phosphoric acid, nitric acid, or the like. An aqueous solution of hydrochloric acid or sulfuric acid is preferable. The concentration of the acid in the aqueous solution is not specifically limited. The acid is usually used in the amount of 1 to 30 moles, preferably 3 to 15 moles per mol of hexahydrotriazine compound (2).<br>
As described above, hexahydrotriazine compound (2)<br><br>
formed in the previous step may be isolated from the reaction mixture, and then hydrolyzed, or the reaction mixture or an organic layer containing hexahydrotriazine compound (2) may be subjected directly to the hydrolysis without isolating hexahydrotriazine compound (2).<br>
The temperature’ for hydrolysis is usually 10 to 100°C/<br>
preferably 25 to 70°C.<br>
As hydrolysis of hexahydrotriazine compound (2) proceeds, formaldehyde is formed as a by-product. In order to facilitate removal of the by-product, formaldehyde, the hydrolysis of hexahydrotriazine compound (2) is preferably carried out in the presence of a lower alcohol compound to convert formaldehyde formed as the by-product into acetal. Examples of the lower alcohol compound include, for example, lower alcohol compounds having 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methanol, ethanol, and the like. The lower alcohol compound is usually used in the amount of not less than 1.5 moles, preferably not less than 2 moles, more preferably not less than 2.5 moles per mol of hexahydrotriazine compound (2), and the upper limit is not specifically limited. When the reaction mixture containing hexahydrotriazine compound (2) is used as it is, and when the lower alcohol compound is present in the reaction mixture, the amount of the lower alcohol compound that may be used may be determined by taking the amount thereof in<br><br>
the reaction mixture into consideration. Further, sometimes, formaldehyde remains in the reaction mixture. In such a case, the lower alcohol compound may be used in an amount sufficient to convert not only formaldehyde formed as the by-product but also formaldehyde remained in the reaction mixture into acetal. Of course, after the hydrolysis of hexahydrotriazine compound (2), formaldehyde may be converted into acetal.<br>
After completion of the hydrolysis, thiazole compound (3) or an acid addition salt thereof can be isolated by, for example, concentration. Alternatively, thiazole compound (3) can be isolated by concentrating the reaction mixture, adding an aqueous solution of an alkali and a hydrophobic organic solvent thereto to subject the mixture to extraction treatment, and concentrating the resulting organic layer. Examples of the aqueous solution of an alkali include an aqueous solution of an alkali metal hydroxide such as an aqueous sodium hydroxide solution, or the like. The amount of the aqueous solution of an alkali that may be used is such that pH of the aqueous layer upon extraction is within the range of usually 8 to 14, preferably 10 to 14,<br>
Further, an acid addition salt of thiazole compound (3) can be isolated by mixing the organic layer obtained in the above extraction with an aqueous solution of an acid,<br><br>
separating into layers to obtain an aqueous solution containing an acid addition salt of thiazole compound (3) and, optionally, partially concentrating the aqueous solution. Further, crystals of an acid addition salt of thiazole compound (3) can be precipitate by adding an insufficient solvent scarcely dissolving the acid addition salt of thiazole compound (3) to the above aqueous solution. Examples of the aqueous solution of an acid include an aqueous solution of an acid such as hydrochloric acid, sulfuric acid, acetic acid, methanesulfonic acid, or the like* The amount of the aqueous solution that may be used is such that pH of the aqueous layer upon extraction is within the range of usually 2.5 to 5.5, preferably 3 to 5, If the aqueous solution containing the acid addition salt of thiazole compound (3) thus obtained is colored, the solution may be subjected to decolorization treatment by, for example, adding a decoloring agent such as activated charcoal to the aqueous solution.<br>
Examples of thiazole compound (3) thus obtained include 5-(aminomethyl)thiazole, 2-chloro-5-(aminomethyl)thiazole, 2-bromo-5-(aminomethyl)thiazole, and the like.<br>
