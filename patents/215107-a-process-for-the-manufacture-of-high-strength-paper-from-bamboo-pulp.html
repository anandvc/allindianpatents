				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This   invention  relates  to  a  method   of<br>
manufacture  of  high strength paper from  tropical  raw material such as bamboo pulp.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
The  copies  of  pulp  from  soft  wood   for<br>
manufacture of high strength paper is recognised in  the art, as softwood contains long fibers which imparts  the<br>
high strength properties of paper.  Thus, high  strength paper  such as extensible sack paper used  in  specially<br>
packaging,  wrapping  and other applications  is  mainly manufactured  from pulp made of softwoods fibre such  as<br>
pine and spruce or softwood mixed with double sorted old corrugated  containers  (DSOCC).  The  incorporation  of<br>
DSOCC pulp in the aforesaid pulp mixture is in order  to reduce the costs,  Typically 40% softwood and 60%  DSOCC<br>
pulp is used for making extensible sack paper in  Indian paper mills.  The pulps required for manufacture of high<br>
strength  paper from softwood and DSOCC determined  from hand-sheets  made at 25°SR (schapper reigler)  generally<br>
have the following properties.    <br>
(Table Removed)<br>
However, hard wood and non-wood raw materials are  not suitable for manufacturing high strength  paper due to insufficient quantity of long fibres in the  pulp obtained from such raw material.<br>
Bamboo  which is abundantly available in  the tropical region, has reasonably high proportion of  long<br>
fibre fraction. Pulp obtained from bamboo contains about 35-40% long fibre fraction which is retained on +14/+28 mesh of Bauer McNett fibre classifier. The average fibre length of this long fibre bamboo fraction is 3.0 to 3.5 mm. Thus the long fibre fraction of bamboo pulp has the requisite physical strength properties suitable for manufacture of high strength paper.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The main object of this invention is to propose a method for manufacture of high strength paper such as extensible sack by using tropical raw material such as bamboo.<br>
Another object of this invention is to separate the long fibre fraction of bamboo kraft pulp for obtaining pulp of requisite quality for manufacture of high stength paper.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided a process for the manufacture of high strength paper from bamboo comprising in the steps of:<br>
i)   preparing bamboo pulp from bamboo chips by the known method   of kraft cooking;<br>
ii) subjecting such a pulp to single, double and third stage of fractionation as herein described to obtain a pulp containing enriched quantity of long fibres;<br>
iii) mixing said fractionated pulp with a waste pulp, such as double sorted old corrugated container having long fibres and then;<br>
iv) manufacturing the paper from the mixed pulp by a known method, characterised by the step of fractionation of Bamboo pulp wherein single step fractionation comprises feeding the bamboo pulp/feed to the fractionator with the basket of 0.35 mm hole at a pressure of 2-2.2 kg/cm2 and at a consistency of 2.8-3%, short fraction received through the accept side of the fractionator screen and the long fraction of the pulp from the reject side of the fractionator screen, the long fraction are further subjected to double and third stage of fractionation after dilution with water.<br>
In accordance with the present invention the method of manufacturing high strength paper with the bamboo pulp includes the step of separation of long fibre fraction from bamboo pulp through a fractionation process. The fractionation process involves fractionation of bamboo pulp through one, two or more successive stages, depending upon the size of the fibre required to be obtained. The bamboo or mixed pulp is<br>
fed  to  the fractionator at a  controlled  consistency. Other  process parameters such as feed rate, reject rate<br>
and the operating pressure are also kept under   control to  separate the short fraction as an  accept  from  the<br>
fractionator screen and the long fraction of the pulp is withdrawn  from  the  reject side  of  the  fractionator<br>
screen.<br>
The  long  fraction  so  obtained  from   the<br>
reject  side  of the first stage  fractionation  can  be subjected  to further fractionation after dilution  with<br>
water,  if required, to obtain desired quality  of  long fibre  fraction.   The fractionation  process  described<br>
above   can  be  repeated  further,  depending  on   the requirement.<br>
According  to  an  option  the  short   fibre<br>
obtained from accept side of the fractionator screen can be  recycled  to  maximize the recovery  of  long  fibre<br>
fraction.<br>
The  long  fraction  (LF2)  of  bamboo   pulp<br>
received after second/double  stage of fractionation are mixed with double sorted old corrugated contains (DSOCC)<br>
in the percentage as 70-80% LF2 with 20-30% DSOCC or any other such fibre. Similarly (long fraction) LF3<br>
received after third stage of fractionation are mixed as follows:-<br>
00.55 - 607.  by weight of LF3 with 40    - 45% DSOCC<br>
Though   fractionation  is   known   but<br>
fractionation Bamboo fibre under the proposed  condition is  not known which is for yielding high strength  fibre<br>
suitable for high strength paper.<br>
The  process parameters for single stage  and<br>
double stage fractionation are maintained as follows:— Single stage fractionation<br>

A method of  manufacture  of high strength   paper from    bamboo    pulp   according   to   a    preferred embodiment   is  herein  described   in detail   and  is examplified in the following.<br>
EXAMPLE<br>
12.623   metric  ton  bamboo  pulp  was   processed   per<br>
hour  through     a first stage  fractionator  with  the basket   of  1.2 mm hole  at  pressure of  1 kg/cm2  and<br>
at  a  consistency  of  3%.  This  was  resulted  in   a first stage short fraction at a  pressure  ,8kg/cm2  and<br>
at a  consistency of 27. with the  pulp yield  of  5.049 ton  per hour. Also  first stage  long fiber was  obtain<br>
at  a  consistency of  4.5% with yield  of  7.574 m  ton per hour.<br>
The  first stage  long fiber pulp after   diluting<br>
with  water was  fed to  second stage  fractionator   of 0.35mm   slot  at  a   pressure  of   1.5  kg/cm2  at   a<br>
constitency  of   2.9%.  This resulted  in second  stage of  short fibre of  3.408 m ton per  hour at a  pressure<br>
of   0.8  kg/cm2  at a  consistency  of   2%.   It  also resulted   in  second  stage long fibre   generation  of<br>
4.166 meter ton per hour at a  consistency  of  4.5%<br>
The  second   stage  long   fibre   fraction   was passed  through  a  third  stage  fractionator of 0.25 mm slot   basket   after  dilution to   a  consistency   of<br>
2.9% at feed pressure of 1.2 kg/cm2. This resulted in generation of IIIrd stage short fibre of 2.083 m<br>
ton/per hour at a consistency of 2.1% and at a pressure of 0.7 kg/cm2. The third stage long<br>
fibre generation was 2.0S3 m. ton per hour at a consistency of 4.6%.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
