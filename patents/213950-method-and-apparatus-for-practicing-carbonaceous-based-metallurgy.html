this invention is not limited to the details or the arrangement of the parts illustrated<br>
in the attached drawings, as the invention can be made operative by using other<br>
embodiments. Also it is to be understood that the terminology herein contained is for<br>
the purpose of description and not (imitation.<br>
Detailed Description of Drawings<br>
Referring to Figure 1, numeral 10 denotes a reactor where the treating of<br>
iron ore with coal takes place to make an iron/carbon product; this treatment of the<br>
ore is hereinafter referred to as "carbotreating". Numeral 11 denotes a melter/<br>
homogenizer where the iron/carbon product is melted with an oxidant to make<br>
molten metal and slag, hereinafter referred to as "oxymelting". A standpipe denoted<br>
by numaral 12 is connected to melter/homogenizer 11 .A metal reservoir is provided<br>
for receiving the molten metal and the slag and is denoted by numeral 13. Referring<br>
to Figure 4, a storage system to contain the raw materials is denoted by numeral 14;<br>
it comprises hoppers 58, 59 and 60 to store feed materials such as ore, coal and flux<br>
respectively. A raw material mixer denoted by numeral 61 serves to blend the feed<br>
materials as they are conveyed to lockhopper 36 which is in turn equipped with<br>
upper valve 84 and lower feed control 62.<br>
Referring back to Figure 1 for a more detailed description of the structure<br>
that enables the method to be practiced, reactor 10 consists of a pushing device<br>
denoted by numeral 15 which is equipped with ram 16 at the charging end of reactor<br>
10, that serves to push the blended charge dropped from hopper 36 into cavity 17.<br>
Ram 16 actuated by pushing device 15, compresses the charge and advances it<br>
within a process chamber which is marked by numeral 28 and which is tapered<br>
along its length. Process chamber 28 is connected to cavity 17, and is made-up of a<br>
pressure shell marked by numeral 26, insulation 27 and wall heating element 25.<br>
Burner 19 in turn communicates with heating element 25 via inlet port 29. Heating<br>
element 25 is equipped with passages shown by numeral 53 in Figure 2; they serve<br>
as a conduit to direct hot gases from burner 19 through inlet 29 to flow through<br>
passages (flues) 53 along the length of process chamber 28 and exit the chamber via<br>
outlet 30. The discharging end of chamber 28 which is marked by numeral 20<br>
attaches to elbow 21. Elbow 21 is designed in such a way as to have reflective wall<br>
23 backed by insulation and contained within a pressure casing, in order to form a<br>
radiant zone to reflect intense thermal energy against the material that is being<br>
carbotreated at discharging end 20. A first lance (or a plurality-of same) denoted by<br>
numeral 22 is mounted into elbow 21; lance 22 is adapted to be advanced towards or<br>
retracted from the material being processed. Controller 24 serves to control<br>
air/oxygen and coolant to make lance 22 operative. Lance 22 may also contain fuel<br>
for start-up purposes.<br>
Reactor 10 communicates with melter/homogenizer 11 by means of<br>
transition 32 that directs the reduced material (the iron/carbon product) from<br>
chamber 28 to melter/homogenizer 11 which comprises shell 85, lining 86, top 87<br>
and bottom 88. A second lance denoted by numeral 34 serves to supply oxidant in<br>
the form of air or oxygen (or a combination of the two) in order to react with the<br>
carbon in the iron/carbon product and with gases produced within the process to<br>
supply the heat needed to melt the reduced iron in the iron/carbon product to yield a<br>
molten iron 42 and a molten slag 43 which floats on top of molten iron 42. Lance 34<br>
which is kept cool, is raised and lowered by means of hoist 39 for adjusting its level<br>
to the working height within melter/homogenizer 11. A drain/port denoted by 31 and<br>
disposed at the bottom of melter/homogenizer 11, connects to standpipe 12. Through<br>
drain/port 31, the gasses, the molten iron and the molten slag flow. An off-gas<br>
discharge marked by numeral 47 is provided to standpipe 12 to divert a sidestream<br>
of such gases for control purposes which are directed to cyclone 46 via collecting<br>
main 37. Both the molten iron and the molten slag drop into reservoir 13 while the<br>
bulk of the gases flows with the iron and slag. Cyclone 46 communicating with<br>
discharge 47, removes paniculate matter from the off-gas. The bottom of cyclone 46<br>
is furnished with surge hopper 40 which feeds into lockhopper 41; control valves 44<br>
and 45 lock &amp; unlock lockhopper 41 in order to discharge the particulate matter<br>
collected into bin 33 which is recycled with the materials charged into reactor 10. A<br>
pressure controller denoted by numeral SO which controls the back pressure of<br>
melter/homogenizer 11 and reactor 10 and standpipe 12 is located downstream of<br>
cyclone 46; the side stream leaves the system via duct 49 for further treatment in a<br>
gas treatment facility which is not shown, but known in the art<br>
Bottom 88 of melter/homogenizer 11 is configured as a cone with drain/port<br>
31 making connection with standpipe 12 which in turn makes connection with metal<br>
reservoir 13 in a submerged mode. Induction heating coil means denoted by numeral<br>
35 is provided, to supply auxiliary heat to insure that molten metal and molten slag<br>
do not freeze when leaving melter/homogenizer 11. In the event such freezing takes<br>
place especially when melter/homogenizer 11 is shut down; induction heating means<br>
35 is energized to melt the frozen iron and slag. The lining of standpipe 12 is made<br>
of such material that would couple with induction heating means 35. Metal reservoir<br>
13 consists of a lined chamber adapted to rotate about roller segment bed 93 to effect<br>
the pouring of molten iron 42 via tap hole 55 into ladle 51, and slag 43 via spout 54<br>
into pot 52.<br>
Referring to Figure 3, numeral 10 is a modified configuration wherein<br>
heating element 25 along the length of chamber 28, is obviated. In this configuration<br>
the heat input is via lance 22 which is adapted to bore into bed 28 by means of an<br>
oxidant after ignition takes place. Lance 22 is equipped with an injection tip denoted<br>
by numeral 48 which may have multi-directional nozzles to inject oxidant in several<br>
directions. Auxiliary oxidant orifices shown by numeral 92 are provided to lance 22<br>
to combust coal and coke in the mixture, as well as gases generated from the coal in<br>
the charge. Heating chamber 28, may be made as a composite structure of which<br>
part is metallic as noted by numeral 117 and part refractory as noted by numeral 27.<br>
Referring again to Figure 4 which is a configuration wherein a plurality of<br>
reactors such as reactor 10, are mounted side by side to form a battery denoted by<br>
numeral 104, with reactors 10 discharging iron/carbon product into common<br>
melter/homogenizer 11. Reactor 10 which is situated at ground level serves as a<br>
spare. A crane denoted by numeral 63, may be added to service battery 104.<br>
In Figure 5, the invention is configured to make directly reduced iron (DRI)<br>
or iron/carbon product which can be melted off-site.Numeral 10 is the reactor with a<br>
downstream surge hopper denoted by numeral 64 which is followed by cooler 65.<br>
Cooler 65 may take one of several known approaches including a cooled screw<br>
feeder shown by numeral 38. The cooler feeds the cooled DRI or iron/carbon<br>
product into surge hopper 66. Below surge hopper 66, a lockhopper denoted by<br>
numeral 67 makes possible the discharging of product DRI or iron/carbon product in<br>
a sealed manner into the atmosphere and onto conveyor 70 by making use of valves<br>
68 and 69. A cyclone similar to cyclone 95 shown in Figure 6 and described<br>
hereunder, may be used for separation of entrained particulate matter.<br>
Referring to Figure 6, numeral 10 is the reactor and numeral 21 is the elbow.<br>
Beneath elbow 21 a transition denoted by numeral 94 is provided through which the<br>
carbotreated material is discharged via downcomer 73 into hot-briquetter 71 which<br>
is adapted to form briquettes from the carbotreated material. A screw feed denoted<br>
by numeral 72 is disposed upstream of briquetter 71 to control the feed into the<br>
briquetter. Beneath briquetter 7t, surge hopper 74 followed by lockhopper 75 are<br>
provided to discharge the formed briquettes into the atmosphere and onto conveyor<br>
70. Valves 76 and 77 serve to lock and unlock lockhopper 75.<br>
Adjacent to transition 94, cyclone 95 is mounted by making use of pipe 78,<br>
in such a way as to pass hot gasses through cyclone 95 in order to remove particulate<br>
matter from the gasses. Transition 94 which is equipped with impact surfaces such<br>
as cascading baffles 89 tend to breakup the hot carbotreated material to release<br>
excess particulate matter; such matter which remains entrained in the off-gases, is<br>
disengaged in a cyclone denoted by numeral 95. Cyclone 95 is equipped with<br>
pressure control means 98, and surge hopper 96 is followed by lockhopper 97.<br>
Collecting bin 79 is disposed below lockhopper 97 for receiving the particulate<br>
matter removed from the gases, which is recycled (not shown).<br>
Referring to Figure 7, a box denoted by numeral 118 may be provided<br>
beneath lockhopper 75 to contain the iron/carbon product and be transported by any<br>
one of known means such as a lift-truck for further processing. Box 118 is designed<br>
in such a way as to be insulated to accept hot product in order to conserve thermal<br>
energy and prevent re-oxidation of the product.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 8 for the description of the structure to<br>
feed the carbonaceous material as a core which is surrounded by the metallic ore. A<br>
materials storage arrangement is provided and denoted by numeral 80 which<br>
comprises hopper 81 to contain the carbonaceous material (fuel) and hopper 82 to<br>
contain the ore. Feeders 101 and 102 control the flow of the fuel and ore from<br>
hoppers 81 and 82 respectively. Valves 103 and 105 service lockhopper 81 and<br>
valves 104 and 106 service lockhiopper 82. Charging tube 83 is provided at the<br>
bottom of materials storage 80, which is flanked by charging device 90 on one side<br>
and reactor 10 on the other side Charging device 90 is made up of a pushing ram<br>
denoted by numeral 99 and pushing plunger 100 with ram 99 being advanced and<br>
retracted by actuator means such as cylinders 107, and plunger 100 being advanced<br>
and retracted by actuator means such as cylinder 108 thus providing independent<br>
motion to either ram 99 or plunger 100, with plunger 100 being housed within ram<br>
99 which is annular in configuration and which is in turn housed within charging<br>
tube 83. Ram 99 passes a charging hole 109 to permit the fuel to be dropped into a<br>
cavity when plunger 100 is in the retracted position. During the detailed description<br>
of the operation for the formation of the core which follows, further clarification will<br>
be disclosed with the aid of Figures 8-1 through 8-6.<br>
Detailed Description of Operation<br>
In explaining the operation of the method and apparatus disclosed herein,<br>
the description will be as follows:<br>
(i) Mode of feeding ore and coal, and of heating such materials for<br>
carbotreating the ore to yield a metallized/carbon product; and<br>
(ii) Melting the metallized/carbon product to yield molten metal via<br>
oxymehing.<br>
With respect to carbotreating wherein a core of fuel is formed in the charged<br>
metallic oxide (ore), reference is made to Figure 8, its sequential Figures 8-1 through<br>
8-6, and Figure 9. In Figure 8-1 both ram 99 and plunger 100 are shown in the<br>
advanced position with the core of fuel being denoted by numeral 110 and the oxide<br>
surrounding it being denoted by numeral 111. Plunger 100 is retracted to the<br>
position shown in Figure 8-2 by means of cylinder 108 while retaining ram 99 in the<br>
advanced position. A metered amount of fuel (coal) marked by numeral 112 is<br>
dropped into cavity 113 via charging hole 109. Plunger 100 is then advanced part<br>
way to push fuel 112 towards that core of fuel which had been charged and<br>
compacted during the previous cycle as shown by Figure 8-3. Next, ram 99 is<br>
retracted using the full stroke of cylinders 107 while plunger 100 is parked at the<br>
part way advanced position. A metered amount of oxide marked by numeral 114, is<br>
dropped into cavity 115 as shown by Figure 8-4 which cavity surrounds plunger<br>
100. Following this step both ram 99 and plunger 100 are simultaneously advanced;<br>
initially, the loose materials begin to be compacted as shown in Figure 8-5 by<br>
numeral 116, and as the advancement of ram 99 and plunger 100 proceeds the fuel<br>
and the oxide become fully compacted with the core being formed within the oxide<br>
with the oxide fully surrounding the core of fuel; the stroke of both ram 99 and<br>
plunger 100 keeps advancing after compaction and the entire contents of reactor 10<br>
begin to move to result in hot metallized/carbon product being discharged from the<br>
discharging end of reactor 10 as illustrated in Figure 8; the discharge of such product<br>
stops when ram 99 and plunger 100 are fully stroked to the advanced position. At<br>
the end of the stroke of ram 99 and plunger 100, the relationship of the ram and the<br>
plunger is shown in Figure 8-6 which is the same as that shown in Figure 8-1. At<br>
this point the cycle is completed. The formation of a fuel core 110 proceeds<br>
cyclically to result in providing core 110 being surrounded by oxide 111 shown in<br>
cross section in Figure 9. This repetitive cycle thus provides a core of fuel being<br>
surrounded with oxide along the length of chamber 28 of reactor 10.<br>
The operation of carbotreating with reference to Figures 1, 3 and 4 is as<br>
follows:-<br>
Assuming that the method is already at steady state and at pressure, and the<br>
ore (preferably in fine, concentrated form), the coal and the flux contained in<br>
materials delivery system 14, are proportionately mixed and fed as a mixture via<br>
hopper 36, into cavity 17 of process chamber 28. Ram 16 is then actuated via<br>
pushing device 15 to compact the mixture to such an extent as to make it<br>
substantially impervious as shown by the densified representation (numeral 18) at<br>
the charging end of reactor 10. As the mixture is advanced in chamber 28 of reactor<br>
10, it is heated by any of the following manners of heating; namely, radiation,<br>
conduction, convection or any combination of these systems to cause the evolution<br>
of gases from the coal with the imperviousness of the mixture forcing the gases to<br>
flow within chamber 28 towards discharging end 20. A portion of these gases is<br>
combusted at the discharging end to provide a highly radiant zone to reflect<br>
intensive thermal energy to the mixture to heat the mixture to such a temperature as<br>
to cause the oxygen in the ore to react with the highly reducing gases liberated from<br>
the coal and/or with residual carbon from the coal to reduce the ore to metallized<br>
iron. To enhance the heat transfer to the mixture, lances such as lance 22 are<br>
provided, which lances are adapted to inject an oxidant in the form of air, oxygen or<br>
a combination of both into the mixture of materials within chamber 28, as this<br>
, mixture advances in chamber 28. Further these lances which are kept cool by means<br>
of a coolant are also adapted to be advanced and retracted for optimal heat transfer.<br>
Variations of oxidant lance injection may also take the form of penetration into the<br>
mixture itself as shown by Figures 1 and 3, with supplementary jets of oxidant (see<br>
number 92) for post-combustion to further enhance heat transfer into the mixture. In<br>
the event that no conductive heat through the wall of chamber 28 is furnished, lance<br>
22 may take the form of an oxygen-fuel (coal, gas or oil) burner to initiate the<br>
combustion and with the provision that once ignition of the coal gases and the<br>
carbon in the coal becomes stable the fuel input from the lance is shut-off, and the<br>
coal"and its gases supplying the thermal energy needed for sustaining the reactions<br>
thus producing the iron/carbon product which is discharged into melter/homogenizer<br>
11. An alternate arrangement may be the supply of the fuel through lance 22 such as<br>
the injection of pulverized coal onto the ore or a combination of the arrangements<br>
described herein and others which are known in the art.<br>
The iron/carbon product made by this method is relatively light as compared<br>
to the bulk density of iron ore and especially as compared to molten metal; further,<br>
the size of the iron/carbon product as it is discharged from reactor 10 is diverse in<br>
size and non-uniform. When such product is discharged into a melter containing<br>
molten metal and slag, the iron/carbon product tends to float on top of the slag and<br>
the molten metal causing delays in productivity and loss of energy by the inability to<br>
readily get the iron/carbon product into solution. It is for this purpose that a melter<br>
which also acts as a homogenizer devoid of a bath of molten metal and molten slag<br>
is provided which takes the form of melter/homogenizer 11 which is capable of<br>
draining the molten iron and molten slag as they are formed.<br>
The oxymelting of the metallized/carbon product will now be described by<br>
making reference to Figure 1. Within melter/homogenizer 11, lance 34 provides the<br>
oxidant to melt the hot iron/carbon product being fed from reactor 10 via<br>
downcomer 32. The oxidant reacts with gases and with carbon from the<br>
carbotreating step to cause an intensive energy release which melts the iron in the<br>
iron/carbon product, the gangue which was part of the iron oxide, the ash of the coal<br>
as well as the flux/desulfurizer material used as additive, to result in making a<br>
molten iron and a molten slag, this combination continuously leaves melter/<br>
homogenizer 11 via drain/port 31 together with the various hot, pressurized gases<br>
produced. Such gases flowing though drain/port 31 keep the molten iron and the slag<br>
flowing out of melter/homogenizer 11 and into reservoir 13 by making use of<br>
standpipe 12 whose tip is submerged in the molten metal within reservoir 13; this<br>
submergence provides a liquid seal which maintains the pressure in the system.<br>
By means of control valve 50 the back pressure in reactor 10, melter/<br>
homogenizer 11 and standpipe 12 is balanced while the gases generated during<br>
carbotreating in reactor 10 and the gases generated during oxymelting in melter/<br>
homogenizer 11 are guided together with the molten metal and molten slag to<br>
reservoir 13 where such gases bubble out of the bath and are combusted for<br>
additional energy release by injecting an oxidant though nozzle 119. The off-gas is<br>
collected in hood 120 for treatment not shown but known in the art. The metallic<br>
dust, carbon and ash entrained in such gases remain in the bath by virtue of the bath<br>
serving as a wet scrubber which increases the yield of the molten metal. A side<br>
stream of such gases flowing through main 37, is used for pressure control by means<br>
of valve 50 and are directed to cyclone 46 via discharge 47 for treatment. The<br>
particulate matter separated in cyclone 46 is recycled with the feedstocks and<br>
auxiliary heat if needed, is maintained in standpipe 12 by means of induction heating<br>
35. The operation in reactor 10 and in the melter/homogenizer 11 is intentionally<br>
maintained reducing to prevent re-oxidation of the iron and minimizing the<br>
formation of NOX and CO2 while providing efficient desulfurizing conditions to<br>
remove the sulfur which originates from the coal.<br>
With respect to the application of this invention to the non-ferrous metals,<br>
variations to that which is disclosed may take place; however, the intention is not to<br>
depart from the spirit of this disclosure. All in all, it is submitted herein that the<br>
instant invention provides major improvement over conventional<br>
practice/metallurgy, which can use low cost raw materials, and which is energy<br>
efficient, environmentally friendly and requiring low capital investment.<br>
