filed July 17, 2003, and United States Provisional Appln. No.: 60/539,207 filed<br>
January 26, 2004, all of which are incorporated by reference in their entirety. The<br>
U.S. nonprovisional application entitled Methods for Chemically Synthesizing<br>
Immunoglobulin Chimeric Proteins, filed concurrently on May 6, 2004, is<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[002] The invention relates generally to therapeutic chimeric proteins,<br>
comprised of two polypeptide chains, wherein the first chain is comprised of a<br>
therapeutic biologically active molecule and the second chain is not comprised of the<br>
therapeutic biologically active molecule of the first chain. More specifically, the<br>
invention relates to chimeric proteins, comprised of two polypeptide chains, wherein<br>
both chains are comprised of at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region<br>
wherein the first chain is modified to further comprise a biologically active molecule,<br>
and the second chain is not so modified. The invention, thus relates to a chimeric<br>
protein that is a monomer-dimer hybrid, i.e., a chimeric protein having a dimeric<br>
aspect and a monomeric aspect, wherein the dimeric aspect relates to the fact that it<br>
is comprised of two polypeptide chains each comprised of a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region, and wherein the monomeric aspect relates to the<br>
fact that only one of the two chains is comprised of a therapeutic biologically active<br>
molecule. Figure 1 illustrates one example of a monomer-dimer hybrid wherein the<br><br>
biologically active molecule is erythropoietin (EPO) and the portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region is an IgG Fc region.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[003] Immunoglobulins are comprised of four polypeptide chains, two<br>
heavy chains and two light chains, which associate via disulfide bonds to form<br>
tetramers. Each chain is further comprised of one variable region and one constant<br>
region. The variable regions mediate antigen recognition and binding, while the<br>
constant regions, particularly the heavy chain constant regions, mediate a variety of<br>
effector functions, e.g., complement binding and Fc receptor binding (see, e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent Nos.: 6,086,875; 5,624,821; 5,116,964).<br>
[004] The constant region is further comprised of domains denoted CH<br>
(constant heavy) domains (CH1, CH2, etc.). Depending on the isotype, (i.e. IgG,<br>
IgM, IgA IgD, IgE) the constant region can be comprised of three or four CH<br>
domains. Some isotypes (e.g. IgG) constant regions also contain a hinge region<br>
Janeway et al. 2001, Immunobiology, Garland Publishing, N.Y., N.Y.<br>
[005] The creation of chimeric proteins comprised of immunoglobulin<br>
constant regions linked to a protein of interest, or fragment thereof, has been<br>
described (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,480,981 and 5,808,029; Gascoigne et al.<br>

et al. 1995, J. Immun. 154:5590). These molecules usually possess both the<br>
biological activity associated with the linked molecule of interest as well as the<br>
effector function, or some other desired characteristic associated with the<br>
immunoglobulin constant region (e.g. biological stability, cellular secretion).<br>
[006] The Fc portion of an immunoglobulin constant region, depending on<br>
the immunoglobulin isotype can include the CH2, CH3, and CH4 domains, as well as<br>
the hinge region. Chimeric proteins comprising an Fc portion of an immunoglobulin<br>
bestow several desirable properties on a chimeric protein including increased<br>
stability, increased serum half life (see Capon et al. 1989, Nature 337:525) as well<br>
as binding to Fc receptors such as the neonatal Fc receptor (FcRn) (U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 6,086,875, 6,485,726, 6,030,613; WO 03/077834; US2003-0235536A1).<br>
[007] FcRn is active in adult epithelial tissue and expressed in the lumen of<br>
the intestines, pulmonary airways, nasal surfaces, vaginal surfaces, colon and rectal<br>
surfaces (U.S. Patent No. 6,485,726). Chimeric proteins comprised of FcRn binding<br>
partners (e.g. IgG, Fc fragments) can be effectively shuttled across epithelial barriers<br>
by FcRn, thus providing a non-invasive means to systemically administer a desired<br>
therapeutic molecule. Additionally, chimeric proteins comprising an FcRn binding<br>
partner are endocytosed by cells expressing the FcRn. But instead of being marked<br>
for degradation, these chimeric proteins are recycled out into circulation again, thus<br>
increasing the in vivo half life of these proteins.<br>
3<br><br>
[008] Portions of immunoglobulin constant regions, e.g., FcRn binding<br>
partners typically associate, via disulfide bonds and other non-specific interactions,<br>
with one another to form dimers and higher order multimers. The instant invention is<br>
based in part upon the surprising discovery that transcytosis of chimeric proteins<br>
comprised of FcRn binding partners appears to be limited by the molecular weight of<br>
the chimeric protein, with higher molecular weight species being transported less<br>
efficiently.<br>
[009] Chimeric proteins comprised of biologically active molecules, once<br>
administered, typically will interact with a target molecule or cell. The instant<br>
invention is further based in part upon the surprising discovery that monomer-dimer<br>
hybrids, with one biologically active molecule, but two portions of an immunoglobulin<br>
constant region, e.g., two FcRn binding partners, function and can be transported<br>
more effectively than homodimers, also referred to herein simply as "dimers" or<br>
higher order multimers with two or more copies of the biologically active molecule.<br>
This is due in part to the fact that chimeric proteins, comprised of two or more<br>
biologically active molecules, which exist as dimers and higher order multimers, can<br>
be sterically hindered from interacting with their target molecule or cell, due to the<br>
presence of the two or more biologically active molecules in close proximity to one<br>
another and that the biologically active molecule can have a high affinity for itself.<br>
[010] Accordingly one aspect of the invention provides chimeric proteins<br>
comprised of a biologically active molecule that is transported across the epithelium<br>
barrier. An additional aspect of the invention provides chimeric proteins comprised<br>
of at least one biologically active molecule that is able to interact with its target<br>
molecule or cell with little or no steric hindrance or self aggregation.<br><br>
[011] The aspects of the invention provide for chimeric proteins comprising<br>
a first and second polypeptide chain, the first chain comprising at least a portion of<br>
immunoglobulin constant region, wherein the portion of an immunoglobulin constant<br>
region has been modified to include a biologically active molecule and the second<br>
chain comprising at least a portion of immunoglobulin constant region, wherein the<br>
portion of an immunoglobulin constant region has not been so modified to include<br>
the biologically active molecule of the first chain.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[012] The invention relates to a chimeric protein comprising one biologically<br>
active molecule and two molecules of at least a portion of an immunoglobulin<br>
constant region. The chimeric protein is capable of interacting with a target<br>

cell resulting in the mature Cys-Fc. When this sequence is produced in CHO cells a<br>
percentage of the molecules are incorrectly cleaved by the signal peptidase such<br>
that two extra amino acids are left on the N terminus, thus preventing the linkage of<br>
a biologically active molecule with a C terminal thioester (e.g., via native ligation).<br>
When these improperly cleaved species dimerize with the properly cleaved Cys-Fc<br>
and are subsequently reacted with biologically active molecules with C terminal<br>
thioesters, monomer-dimer hybrids form.<br>

B. Improvements Offered by Certain Embodiments of the Invention<br>
[087] The invention provides for chimeric proteins (monomer-dimer hybrids)<br>
comprising a first and a second polypeptide chain, wherein said first chain comprises<br>
a biologically active molecule and at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant<br>
region, and said second chain comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin<br>
24<br><br>
constant region without any biologically active molecule or variable region of an<br>
immunoglobulin. Figure 1 contrasts traditional fusion protein dimers with one<br>
example of the monomer-dimer hybrid of the invention. In this example, the<br>
biologically active molecule is EPO and the portion of an immunoglobulin is IgG Fc<br>
region.<br>
[088] Like other chimeric proteins comprised of at least a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region, the invention provides for chimeric proteins which<br>
afford enhanced stability and increased bioavailability of the chimeric protein<br>
compared to the biologically active molecule alone. Additionally, however, because<br>
only one of the two chains comprises the biologically active molecule, the chimeric<br>
protein has a lower molecular weight than a chimeric protein wherein all chains<br>
comprise a biologically active molecule and while not wishing to be bound by any<br>
theory, this may result in the chimeric protein being more readily transcytosed<br>
across the epithelium barrier, e.g., by binding to the FcRn receptor thereby<br>
increasing the half-life of the chimeric protein. In one embodiment, the invention<br>
thus provides for an improved non-invasive method {e.g. via any mucosal surface,<br>
such as, orally, buccally, sublingually, nasally, rectally, vaginally, or via pulmonary or<br>
occular route) of administering a therapeutic chimeric protein of the invention. The<br>
invention thus provides methods of attaining therapeutic levels of the chimeric<br>
proteins of the invention using less frequent and lower doses compared to previously<br>
described chimeric proteins (e.g. chimeric proteins comprised of at least a portion of<br>
an immunoglobulin constant region and a biologically active molecule, wherein all<br>
chains of the chimeric protein comprise a biologically active molecule).<br>
25<br><br>
[089] In another embodiment, the invention provides an invasive method,<br>
e.g., subcutaneously, intravenously, of administering a therapeutic chimeric protein<br>
of the invention. Invasive administration of the therapeutic chimeric protein of the<br>
invention provides for an increased half life of the therapeutic chimeric protein which<br>
results in using less frequent and lower doses compared to previously described<br>
chimeric proteins (e.g. chimeric proteins comprised of at least a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region and a biologically active molecule, wherein all<br>
chains of the chimeric protein comprise a biologically active molecule).<br>
[090] Yet another advantage of a chimeric protein wherein only one of the<br>
chains comprises a biologically active molecule is the enhanced accessibility of the<br>
biologically active molecule for its target cell or molecule resulting from decreased<br>
steric hindrance, decreased hydrophobic interactions, decreased ionic interactions,<br>
or decreased molecular weight compared to a chimeric protein wherein all chains<br>
are comprised of a biologically active molecule.<br>
C. Chimeric Proteins<br>
[091] The invention relates to chimeric proteins comprising one biologically<br>
active molecule, at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region, and<br>
optionally at least one linker. The portion of an immunoglobulin will have both an N,<br>
or an amino terminus, and a C, or carboxy terminus. The chimeric protein may have<br>
the biologically active molecule linked to the N terminus of the portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin. Alternatively, the biologically active molecule may be linked to the<br>
C terminus of the portion of an immunoglobulin. In one embodiment, the linkage is a<br>
covalent bond. In another embodiment, the linkage is a non-covalent bond.<br>
26<br><br>
[092] The chimeric protein can optionally comprise at least one linker; thus,<br>
the biologically active molecule does not have to be directly linked to the portion of<br>
an immunoglobulin constant region. The linker can intervene in between the<br>
biologically active molecule and the portion of an immunoglobulin constant region.<br>
The linker can be linked to the N terminus of the portion of an immunoglobulin<br>
constant region, or the C terminus of the portion of an immunoglobulin constant<br>
region. If the biologically active molecule is comprised of at least one amino acid the<br>
biologically active molecule will have an N terminus and a C terminus and the linker<br>
can be linked to the N terminus of the biologically active molecule, or the C terminus<br>
the biologically active molecule.<br>
[093] The invention relates to a chimeric protein of the formula X-La-F:F or<br>
F:F-I_a-X , wherein X is a biologically active molecule, L is an optional linker, F is at<br>
least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region and, a is any integer or zero.<br>
The invention also relates to a chimeric protein of the formula Ta-X-La-F:F or Ta-F:F-<br>
La-X, wherein X is a biologically active molecule, L is an optional linker, F is at least<br>
a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region, a is any integer or zero, T is a<br>
second linker or alternatively a tag that can be used to facilitate purification of the<br>
chimeric protein, e.g., a FLAG tag, a histidine tag, a GST tag, a maltose binding<br>
protein tag and (:) represents a chemical association, e.g. at least one non-peptide<br>
bond. In certain embodiments, the chemical association, i.e., (:) is a covalent bond.<br>
In other embodiments, the chemical association, i.e., (:) is a non-covalent<br>
interaction, e.g., an ionic interaction, a hydrophobic interaction, a hydrophilic<br>
interaction, a Van der Waals interaction, a hydrogen bond. It will be understood by<br>
27<br><br>
the skilled artisan that when a equals zero X will be directly linked to F. Thus, for<br>
example, a may be 0, 1, 2, 3,4, 5, or more than 5.<br>
[094] In one embodiment, the chimeric protein of the invention comprises<br>
the amino acid sequence of figure 2a (SEQ ID NO:6). In one embodiment, the<br>
chimeric protein of the invention comprises the amino acid sequence of figure 2b<br>
(SEQ ID NO:8). In one embodiment, the chimeric protein of the invention comprises<br>
the amino acid sequence of figure 2c (SEQ ID NO:10). In one embodiment, the<br>
chimeric protein of the invention comprises the amino acid sequence of figure 2d<br>
(SEQ ID NO:12). In one embodiment, the chimeric protein of the invention<br>
comprises the amino acid sequence of figure 2e (SEQ ID NO:14). In one<br>
embodiment, the chimeric protein of the invention comprises the amino acid<br>
sequence of figure 2f (SEQ ID NO:16). In one embodiment, the chimeric protein of<br>
the invention comprises the amino acid sequence of figure 2g (SEQ ID NO:18). In<br>
one embodiment, the chimeric protein of the invention comprises the amino acid<br>
sequence of figure 2h (SEQ ID NO:20). In one embodiment, the chimeric protein of<br>
the invention comprises the amino acid sequence of figure 2i (SEQ ID NO:22). In<br>
one embodiment, the chimeric protein of the invention comprises the amino acid<br>
sequence of figure 2j (SEQ ID NO:24). In one embodiment, the chimeric protein of<br>
the invention comprises the amino acid sequence of figure 17b (SEQ ID NO:27).<br>
1. Chimeric Protein Variants<br>
[095] Derivatives of the chimeric proteins of the invention, antibodies against<br>
the chimeric proteins of the invention and antibodies against binding partners of the<br>
chimeric proteins of the invention are all contemplated, and can be made by altering<br>
their amino acids sequences by substitutions, additions, and/or deletions/truncations<br><br>
or by introducing chemical modification that result in functionally equivalent<br>
molecules. It will be understood by one of ordinary skill in the art that certain amino<br>
acids in a sequence of any protein may be substituted for other amino acids without<br>
adversely affecting the activity of the protein.<br>
[096] Various changes may be made in the amino acid sequences of the<br>
chimeric proteins of the invention or DNA sequences encoding therefore without<br>
appreciable loss of their biological activity, function, or utility. Derivatives, analogs,<br>
or mutants resulting from such changes and the use of such derivatives is within the<br>
scope of the present invention. In a specific embodiment, the derivative is<br>
functionally active, i.e., capable of exhibiting one or more activities associated with<br>
the chimeric proteins of the invention, e.g., FcRn binding, viral inhibition, hemostasis,<br>
production of red blood cells. Many assays capable of testing the activity of a<br>
chimeric protein comprising a biologically active molecule are known in the art.<br>
Where the biologically active molecule is an HIV inhibitor, activity can be tested by<br>
measuring reverse transcriptase activity using known methods {see, e.g., Barre-<br>
Sinoussi et al. 1983, Science 220:868; Gallo et al. 1984, Science 224:500).<br>
Alternatively, activity can be measured by measuring fusogenic activity (see, e.g.,<br>
Nussbaum et al. 1994, J. Virol. 68(9):5411). Where the biological activity is<br>
hemostasis, a StaCLot FVIIa-rTF assay can be performed to assess activity of<br>
Factor Vila derivatives (Johannessen et al. 2000, Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis<br>
11:S159).<br>
[097] Substitutes for an amino acid within the sequence may be selected<br>
from other members of the class to which the amino acid belongs (see Table 1).<br>

b. Antiviral Agents<br>
[0103] In one embodiment, the biologically active molecule is an antiviral<br>
agent, including fragments and analogs thereof. An antiviral agent can include any<br>
molecule that inhibits or prevents viral replication, or inhibits or prevents viral entry<br>
into a ceil, or inhibits or prevents viral egress from a cell. In one embodiment, the<br>
antiviral agent is a fusion inhibitor. In one embodiment, the antiviral agent is a<br>

target cell. The viral fusion inhibitor can be any molecule that decreases or prevents<br>
the formation of syncytia between at least two susceptible cells. The viral fusion<br>
inhibitor can be any molecule that decreases or prevents the joining of a lipid bilayer<br>
membrane of a eukaryotic cell and a lipid bilayer of an enveloped virus. Examples<br>

of enveloped virus include, but are not limited to HIV-1, HIV-2, SIV, influenza,<br>
parainfluenza, Epstein-Barr virus, CMV, herpes simplex 1, herpes simplex 2 and<br>
respiratory syncytia virus.<br>
[0105] The viral fusion inhibitor can be any molecule that decreases or<br>
prevents viral fusion including, but not limited to, a polypeptide, a small organic<br>
molecule or a small inorganic molecule. In one embodiment, the fusion inhibitor is a<br>
polypeptide. In one embodiment, the viral fusion inhibitor is a polypeptide of 3-36<br>
amino acids. In another embodiment, the viral fusion inhibitor is a polypeptide of 3-<br>
50 amino acids, 10-65 amino acids, 10-75 amino acids. The polypeptide can be<br>
comprised of a naturally occurring amino acid sequence (e.g. a fragment of gp41)<br>
including analogs and mutants thereof or the polypeptide can be comprised of an<br>
amino acid sequence not found in nature, so long as the polypeptide exhibits viral<br>
fusion inhibitory activity.<br>
[0106] In one embodiment, the viral fusion inhibitor is a polypeptide, identified<br>
as being a viral fusion inhibitor using at least one computer algorithm, e.g.,<br>
ALLMOTI5, 107x178x4 and PLZIP {see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.: 6,013,263;<br>
6,015,881; 6,017,536; 6,020,459; 6,060,065; 6,068,973; 6,093,799; and 6,228,983).<br>
[0107] In one embodiment, the viral fusion inhibitor is an HIV fusion inhibitor.<br>
In one embodiment, HIV is HIV-1. In another embodiment, HIV is HIV-2. In one<br>
embodiment, the HIV fusion inhibitor is a polypeptide comprised of a fragment of the<br>
gp41 envelope protein of HIV-1. The HIV fusion inhibitor can comprise, e.g., T20<br>
(SEQ ID NO:1) or an analog thereof, T21 (SEQ ID NO:2) or an analog thereof,<br>
T1249 (SEQ ID NO:3) or an analog thereof, NCcGgp41 (Louis et al. 2001, J. Biol.<br>
33<br><br>
Chem. 276:(31)29485) or an analog thereof, or 5 helix (Root et al. 2001, Science<br>
291:884) or an analog thereof.<br>
[0108] Assays known in the art can be used to test for viral fusion inhibiting<br>
activity of a polypeptide, a small organic molecule, or a small inorganic molecule.<br>
These assays include a reverse transcriptase assay, a p24 assay, or syncytia<br>
formation assay (see, e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,464,933).<br>
[0109] A list of antiviral agents which may be used in the chimeric protein of<br>
the invention has been previously described (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,086,875,<br>
6,485,726, 6,030,613; WO 03/077834; US2003-0235536A1).<br>
c. Hemostatic Agents<br>
[0110] In one embodiment, the biologically active molecule is a clotting factor<br>
or other agent that promotes hemostasis, including fragments and analogs thereof.<br>
The clotting factor can include any molecule that has clotting activity or activates a<br>
molecule with clotting activity. The clotting factor can be comprised of a polypeptide.<br>
The clotting factor can be, as an example, but not limited to Factor VIII, Factor IX,<br>
Factor XI, Factor XII, fibrinogen, prothrombin, Factor V, Factor VII, Factor X, Factor<br>
XIII or von Willebrand Factor. In one embodiment, the clotting factor is Factor VII or<br>
Factor Vila. The clotting factor can be a factor that participates in the extrinsic<br>
pathway. The clotting factor can be a factor that participates in the intrinsic pathway.<br>
Alternatively, the clotting factor can be a factor that participates in both the extrinsic<br>
and intrinsic pathway.<br>
[0111] The clotting factor can be a human clotting factor or a non-human<br>
clotting factor, e.g., derived from a non-human primate, a pig or any mammal. The<br>
clotting factor can be chimeric clotting factor, e.g., the clotting factor can comprise a<br>
34<br><br>
portion of a human clotting factor and a portion of a porcine clotting factor or a<br>
portion of a first non-human clotting factor and a portion of a second non-human<br>
clotting factor.<br>
[0112] The clotting factor can be an activated clotting factor. Alternatively, the<br>
clotting factor can be an inactive form of a clotting factor, e.g., a zymogen. The<br>
inactive clotting factor can undergo activation subsequent to being linked to at least<br>
a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region. The inactive clotting factor can be<br>
activated subsequent to administration to a subject. Alternatively, the inactive<br>
clotting factor can be activated prior to administration.<br>
[0113] In certain embodiments an endopeptidase, e.g., paired basic amino<br>
acid cleaving enzyme (PACE), or any PACE family member, such as PCSK1-9,<br>
including truncated versions thereof, or its yeast equivalent Kex2 from S. cerevisiae<br>
and truncated versions of Kex2 (Kex2 1-675) (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 5,077,204;<br>
5,162,220; 5,234,830; 5,885,821; 6,329,176) may be used to cleave a propetide to<br>
form the mature chimeric protein of the invention {e.g. factor VII, factor IX).<br>
d. Other Proteinaceous Biologically Active Molecules<br>
[0114] In one embodiment, the biologically active molecule is a receptor or a<br>
fragment or analog thereof. The receptor can be expressed on a cell surface, or<br>
alternatively the receptor can be expressed on the interior of the cell. The receptor<br>
can be a viral receptor, e.g., CD4, CCR5, CXCR4, CD21, CD46. The biologically<br>
active molecule can be a bacterial receptor. The biologically active molecule can be<br>
an extra-cellular matrix protein or fragment or analog thereof, important in bacterial<br>
colonization and infection (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.: 5,648,240; 5,189,015;<br>
5,175,096) or a bacterial surface protein important in adhesion and infection (see,<br><br>
e.g., U.S. Patent No, 5,648,240). The biologically active molecule can be a growth<br>
factor, hormone or cytokine receptor, or a fragment or analog thereof, e.g., TNFa<br>
receptor, the erythropoietin receptor, CD25, CD122, or CD132.<br>
[0115] A list of other proteinaceous molecules which may be used in the<br>
chimeric protein of the invention has been previously described (see, e.g., U.S.<br>
Patent Nos. 6,086,875; 6,485,726; 6,030,613; WO 03/077834; US2003-0235536A1).<br>
e. Nucleic Acids<br>
[0116] In one embodiment, the biologically active molecule is a nucleic acid,<br>
e.g., DNA, RNA. In one specific embodiment, the biologically active molecule is a<br>
nucleic acid that can be used in RNA interference (RNAi). The nucleic acid<br>
molecule can be as an example, but not as a limitation, an anti-sense molecule or a<br>
ribozyme or an aptamer.<br>
[0117] Antisense RNA and DNA molecules act to directly block the translation<br>
of mRNA by hybridizing to targeted mRNA and preventing protein translation.<br>
Antisense approaches involve the design of oligonucleotides that are<br>
complementary to a target gene mRNA. The antisense oligonucleotides will bind to<br>
the complementary target gene mRNA transcripts and prevent translation. Absolute<br>
complementariJy, is not required.<br>
[0118] A sequence "complementary" to a portion of an RNA, as referred to<br>
herein, means a sequence having sufficient complementarity to be able to hybridize<br>
with the RNA, forming a stable duplex; in the case of double-stranded antisense<br>
nucleic acids, a single strand of the duplex DNA may thus be tested, or triplex<br>
formation may be assayed. The ability to hybridize will depend on both the degree<br>
of complementarity and the length of the antisense nucleic acid. Generally, the<br><br>
longer the hybridizing nucleic acid, the more base mismatches with an RNA it may<br>
contain and stiH-fo-r-m-a-stable duplex^orlripiexras^he-case may be), une sKiiiea in<br>
the art can ascertain a tolerable degree ot mismatch by use ot standard procedures<br>
to determine the melting point of the hybridized complex.<br>
[0119] Antisense nucleic acids should be at least six nucleotides in length,<br>
and are preferably oligonucleotides ranging from 6 to about 50 nucleotides in length.<br>
In specific aspects, the oligonucleotide is at least 10 nucleotides, at least 17<br>
nucleotides, at least 25 nucleotides or at least 50 nucleotides.<br>
[0120] The oligonucleotides can be DNA or RNA or chimeric mixtures or<br>
derivatives or modified versions thereof, single-stranded or double-stranded. The<br>
oligonucleotide can be modified at the base moiety, sugar moiety, or phosphate<br>
backbone, for example, to improve stability of the molecule, hybridization, etc. The<br>
oligonucleotide may include other appended groups such as polypeptides (e.g. for<br>
targeting host cell receptors in vivo), or agents facilitating transport across the cell<br>
membrane (see, e.g., Letsinger et al. 1989, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci USA 86:6553;<br>
Lemaitre et al. 1987, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 84:648; WO 88/09810,) or the<br>
blood-brain barrier (see, e.g., WO 89/10134), hybridization-triggered cleavage<br>
agents (see, e.g., Krol et al. 1988, BioTechniques 6:958) or intercalating agents<br>
(see, e.g., Zon 1988, Pharm. Res. 5:539). To this end, the oligonucleotide may be<br>
conjugated to another molecule, e.g., a polypeptide, hybridization triggered cross-<br>
linking agent, transport agent, or hybridization-triggered cleavage agent.<br>
[0121] Ribozyme molecules designed to catalytically cleave target gene<br>
mRNA transcripts can also be used to prevent translation of target gene mRNA and,<br>
37<br><br>
therefore, expression of target gene product. (See, e.g., WO 90/11364; Sarver et al.<br>
!WG~ScFence 237, 1222^1225).<br>
[0122] Ribozymes are enzymatic RNA molecules capable of catalyzing the<br>
specific cleavage oi RNA. (See Rossi. 1994, Current Biology 4:469). The<br>
mechanism of ribozyme action involves sequence specific hybridization of the<br>
ribozyme molecule to complementary target RNA, followed by an endonucleolytic<br>
cleavage event. The composition of ribozyme molecules must include one or more<br>
sequences complementary to the target gene mRNA, and must include the well<br>
known catalytic sequence responsible for mRNA cleavage. For this sequence, see,<br>
e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,093,246.<br>
[0123] In one embodiment, ribozymes that cleave mRNA at site specific<br>
recognition sequences can be used to destroy target gene mRNAs. In another<br>
embodiment, the use of hammerhead ribozymes is contemplated. Hammerhead<br>
ribozymes cleave mRNAs at locations dictated by flanking regions that form<br>
complementary base pairs with the target mRNA. The sole requirement is that the<br>
target mRNA have the following sequence of two bases: 5'-UG-3'. The construction<br>
and production of hammerhead ribozymes is well known in the art and is described<br>
more fully in Myers 1995, Molecular Biology and Biotechnology: A Comprehensive<br>
Desk Reference, VCH Publishers, New York, and in Haseloff and Gerlach 1988,<br>
Nature, 334:585.<br>
f. Small Molecules<br>
[0124] The invention also contemplates the use of any therapeutic small<br>
molecule or drug as the biologically active molecule in the chimeric protein of the<br>
invention. A list of small molecules and drugs which may be used in the chimeric<br>
38<br><br>
protein of the invention has been previously described (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nlos.<br>
6,086,875; 6,485,726; 6,030,613; WO 03/077834; US2003-0235536A1).<br>
2. Immunoglobulins<br>
[0125] The chimeric proteins of the invention comprise at least a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region. Immunoglobulins are comprised of four protein<br>
chains that associate covalently—two heavy chains and two light chains. Each<br>
chain is further comprised of one variable region and one constant region.<br>
Depending upon the immunoglobulin isotype, the heavy chain constant region is<br>
comprised of 3 or 4 constant region domains (e.g. CH1, CH2, CH3, CH4). Some<br>
isotypes are further comprised of a hinge region.<br>
[0126] The portion of an immunoglobulin constant region can be obtained<br>
from any mammal. The portion of an immunoglobulin constant region can include a<br>
portion of a human immunoglobulin constant region, a non-human primate<br>
immunoglobulin constant region, a bovine immunoglobulin constant region, a<br>
porcine immunoglobulin constant region, a murine immunoglobulin constant region,<br>
an ovine immunoglobulin constant region or a rat immunoglobulin constant region.<br>
[0127] The portion of an immunoglobulin constant region can be produced<br>
recomb/nantly or synthetically. The immunoglobulin can be isolated from a cDNA<br>
library. The portion of an immunoglobulin constant region can be isolated from a<br>
phage library (See, e.g., McCafferty etal. 1990, Nature 348:552, Kang et al. 1991,<br>
Proc. Natl. Acad. Set. USA 88:4363; EP 0 589 877 B1). The portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region can be obtained by gene shuffling of known<br>
sequences (Mark et al. 1992, Bio/Technol. 10:779). The portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region can be isolated by in vivo recombination<br><br>
(Waterhouse et at. 1993, Nucl. Add Res. 21:2265). The immunoglobulin can be a<br>
humanized immunoglobulin (U.S. Patent No. 5,585,089, Jones etal. 1986, Nature<br>
332:323).<br>
[0128] The portion of an immunoglobulin constant region can include a portion<br>
of an IgG, an IgA, an IgM, an IgD, or an IgE. In one embodiment, the<br>
immunoglobulin is an IgG. In another embodiment, the immunoglobulin is lgG1. In<br>
another embodiment, the immunoglobulin is lgG2.<br>
[0129}The portion of an immunoglobulin constant region can include the<br>
entire heavy chain constant region, or a fragment or analog thereof. In one<br>
embodiment, a heavy chain constant region can comprise a CH1 domain, a CH2<br>
domain, a CH3 domain, and/or a hinge region. In another embodiment, a heavy<br>
chain constant region can comprise a CH1 domain, a CH2 domain, a CH3 domain,<br>
and/or a CH4 domain.<br>
[0130] The portion of an immunoglobulin constant region can include an Fc<br>
fragment. An Fc fragment can be comprised of the CH2 and CH3 domains of an<br>
immunoglobulin and the hinge region of the immunoglobulin. The Fc fragment can<br>
be the Fc fragment of an lgG1, an lgG2, an lgG3 or an lgG4. In one specific<br>
embodiment, the portion of an immunoglobulin constant region is an Fc fragment of<br>
an lgG1. In another embodiment, the portion of an immunoglobulin constant region<br>
is an Fc fragment of an lgG2.<br>
[0131] In another embodiment, the portion of an immunoglobulin constant<br>
region is an Fc neonatal receptor (FcRn) binding partner. An FcRn binding partner<br>
is any molecule that can be specifically bound by the FcRn receptor with consequent<br>
active transport by the FcRn receptor of the FcRn binding partner. Specifically<br>
40<br><br>
bound refers to two molecules forming a complex that is relatively stable under<br>
plTyioloic'condilionSpeitlcnDindlng is characterizecTby a high affinity and a low<br>
to moderate capacity as distinguished from nonspecific binding which usually has a<br>
low affinity with a moderate to high capacity. Typically, binding is considered<br>
specific when the affinity constant KA is higher than 106 M"1, or more preferably<br>
higher than 108 M"1. If necessary, non-specific binding can be reduced without<br>
substantially affecting specific binding by varying the binding conditions. The<br>
appropriate binding conditions such as concentration of the molecules, ionic strength<br>
of the solution, temperature, time allowed for binding, concentration of a blocking<br>
agent (e.g. serum albumin, milk casein), etc., may be optimized by a skilled artisan<br>
using routine techniques.<br>
[0132] The FcRn receptor has been isolated from several mammalian species<br>
including humans. The sequences of the human FcRn, monkey FcRn rat FcRn, and<br>
mouse FcRn are known (Story et al. 1994, J. Exp. Med. 180:2377). The FcRn<br>
receptor binds IgG (but not other immunoglobulin classes such as IgA, IgM, IgD, and<br>
IgE) at relatively low pH, actively transports the IgG transcellularly in a luminal to<br>
serosal direction, and then releases the IgG at relatively higher pH found in the<br>
interstitial fluids. It is expressed in adult epithelial tissue (U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,485,726, 6,030,613, 6,086,875; WO 03/077834; US2003-0235536A1) including<br>
lung and intestinal epithelium (Israel et al. 1997, Immunology 92:69) renal proximal<br>
tubular epithelium (Kobayashi et al. 2002, Am. J. Physiol. Renal Physiol. 282:F358)<br>
as well as nasal epithelium, vaginal surfaces, and biliary tree surfaces.<br>
[0133] FcRn binding partners of the present invention encompass any<br>
molecule that can be specifically bound by the FcRn receptor including whole IgG,<br>
41<br><br>
the Fc fragment of IgG, and other fragments that include the complete binding region<br>
ottfieTcRh receptorTThe region of the Fc portion of IgG that binds to the FcRn<br>
receptor has been described based on X-ray crystallography (Burmeister et al. 1994,<br>
Nature 372:379). The major contact area of the Fc with the FcRn is near the<br>
junction of the CH2 and CH3 domains. Fc-FcRn contacts are all within a single Ig<br>
heavy chain. The FcRn binding partners include whole IgG, the Fc fragment of IgG,<br>
and other fragments of IgG that include the complete binding region of FcRn. The<br>
major contact sites include amino acid residues 248, 250-257, 272, 285, 288, 290-<br>
291, 308-311, and 314 of the CH2 domain and amino acid residues 385-387, 428,<br>
and 433-436 of the CH3 domain. References made to amino acid numbering of<br>
immunoglobulins or immunoglobulin fragments, or regions, are all based on Kabat et<br>
al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of<br>
Public Health, Bethesda, MD.<br>
[0134] The Fc region of IgG can be modified according to well recognized<br>
procedures such as site directed mutagenesis and the like to yield modified IgG or<br>
Fc fragments or portions thereof that will be bound by FcRn. Such modifications<br>
include modifications remote from the FcRn contact sites as well as modifications<br>
within the contact sites that preserve or even enhance binding to the FcRn. For<br>
example, the following single amino acid residues in human lgG1 Fc (Fcy1) can be<br>
substituted without significant loss of Fc binding affinity for FcRn: P238A, S239A,<br>

for example P238A represents wildtype proline substituted by alanine at position<br>
number 238, As an example, one specifc embodiment, incorporates the N297A<br>
mutation, removing a highly conserved N-glycosylation site. In addition to alanine<br>
other amino acids may be substituted for the wildtype amino acids at the positions<br>
specified above. Mutations may be introduced singly into Fc giving rise to more than<br>
one hundred FcRn binding partners distinct from native Fc. Additionally,<br>
combinations of two, three, or more of these individual mutations may be introduced<br>
together, giving rise to hundreds more FcRn binding partners. Moreover, one of the<br>
FcRn binding partners of the monomer-dimer hybrid may be mutated and the other<br>
FcRn binding partner not mutated at all, or they both may be mutated but with<br>
different mutations. Any of the mutations described herein, including N297A, may<br>
be used to modify Fc, regardless of the biologically active molecule (e.g., EPO, IFN,<br>
Factor IX, T20).<br>
[0135] Certain of the above mutations may confer new functionality upon the<br>
FcRn binding partner. For example, one embodiment incorporates N297A,<br>
removing a highly conserved N-glycosylation site. The effect of this mutation is to<br>
reduce immunogenicity, thereby enhancing circulating half life of the FcRn binding<br>
partner, and to render the FcRn binding partner incapable of binding to FcyRI,<br>
43<br><br>
FcyRIlA, FcvRliB, and FcyRIIIA, without compromising affinity for FcRn (Routiedge<br>
et al. 1995, Transplantation 60:847; Friend et al. 1999, Transplantation 68:1632;<br>
Shields et al. 1995, J. Biol. Chem. 276:6591). As a further example of new<br>
functionality arising from mutations described above affinity for FcRn may be<br>
increased beyond that of wild type in some instances. This increased affinity may<br>
reflect an increased "on" rate, a decreased "off rate or both an increased "on" rate<br>
and a decreased "off' rate. Mutations believed to impart an increased affinity for<br>
FcRn include T256A, T307A, E380A, and N434A (Shields et al. 2001, J. Biol. Chem.<br>
276:6591).<br>
[0136] Additionally, at least three human Fc gamma receptors appear to<br>
recognize a binding site on IgG within the lower hinge region, generally amino acids<br>
234-237. Therefore, another example of new functionality and potential decreased<br>
immunogenicity may arise from mutations of this region, as for example by replacing<br>
amino acids 233-236 of human lgG1 "ELLG" to the corresponding sequence from<br>
lgG2 "PVA" (with one amino acid deletion). It has been shown that FcyRI, FcyRII,<br>
and FcyRHI, which mediate various effector functions will not bind to lgG1 when<br>
such mutations have been introduced. Ward and Ghetie 1995, Therapeutic<br>
immunology 2:77 and Armour et al.1999, Eur. J. Immunol. 29:2613.<br>
[0137] In one embodiment, the FcRn binding partner is a polypeptide<br>
including the sequence PKNSSMISNTP (SEQ ID NO:26) and optionally further<br>
including a sequence selected from HQSLGTQ (SEQ ID NO:27), HQNLSDGK (SEQ<br>
ID NO:28), HQNISDGK (SEQ ID NO:29), orVISSHLGQ (SEQ ID NO:30) (U.S.<br>
Patent No. 5,739,277).<br>
44<br><br>
[0138] Two FcRn receptors can bind a single Fc molecule. Crystallographic<br>
data suggest that each FcRn molecule binds a single polypeptide of the Fc<br>
homodimer. In one embodiment, linking the FcRn binding partner, e.g., an Fc<br>
fragment of an IgG, to a biologically active molecule provides a means of delivering<br>
the biologically active molecule orally, buccally, sublingually, rectally, vaginally, as<br>
an aerosol administered nasally or via a pulmonary route, or via an ocular route. In<br>
another embodiment, the chimeric protein can be administered invasively, e.g.,<br>
subcutaneously, intravenously.<br>
[0139] The skilled artisan will understand that portions of an immunoglobulin<br>
constant region for use in the chimeric protein of the invention can include mutants<br>
or analogs thereof, or can include chemically modified immunoglobulin constant<br>
regions (e.g. pegylated), or fragments thereof (see, e.g., Aslam and Dent 1998,<br>
Bioconjugation: Protein Coupling Techniques For the Biomedical Sciences Macmilan<br>
Reference, London). In one instance, a mutant can provide for enhanced binding of<br>
an FcRn binding partner for the FcRn. Also contemplated for use in the chimeric<br>
protein of the invention are peptide mimetics of at least a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region, e.g., a peptide mimetic of an Fc fragment or a<br>
peptide mimetic of an FcRn binding partner. In one embodiment, the peptide<br>
mimetic is identified using phage display or via chemical library screening (see, e.g.,<br>
McCafferty et al. 1990, Nature 348:552, Kang et al. 1991, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
88:4363; EP 0 589 877 B1).<br>
3. Optional Linkers<br>
[0140] The chimeric protein of the invention can optionally comprise at least<br>
one linker molecule. The linker can be comprised of any organic molecule. In one<br><br>
embodiment, the linker is polyethylene glycol (PEG). In another embodiment, the<br>
linker is comprised of amino acids. The linker can comprise 1-5 amino acids, 1-10<br>
amino acids, 1-20 amino acids, 10-50 amino acids, 50-100 amino acids, 100-200<br>
amino acids. In one embodiment, the linker is the eight amino acid linker<br>
EFAGAAAV (SEQ ID NO:31). Any of the linkers described herein may be used in<br>
the chimeric protein of the invention, e.g., a monomer-dimer hybrid, including<br>
EFAGAAAV, regardless of the biologically active molecule (e.g. EPO, IFN, Factor<br>
IX).<br>
[0141] The linker can comprise the sequence Gn. The linker can comprise the<br>
sequence (GA)n(SEQ ID NO:32). The linker can comprise the sequence (GGS)n<br>
(SEQ ID NO:33). The linker can comprise the sequence (GGS)n(GGGGS)n(SEQ ID<br>
NO:34). In these instances, n may be an integer from 1-10, i.e., 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8,<br>
9, 10. Examples of linkers include, but are not limited to, GGG (SEQ ID NO:35),<br>
SGGSGGS (SEQ ID NO:36), GGSGGSGGSGGSGGG (SEQ ID NO:37),<br>
GGSGGSGGGGSGGGGS (SEQ ID NO:38), GGSGGSGGSGGSGGSGGS (SEQ ID<br>
NO:39). The linker does not eliminate or diminish the biological activity of the<br>
chimeric protein. Optionally, the linker enhances the biological activity of the<br>
chimeric protein, e.g., by further diminishing the effects of steric hindrance and<br>
making the biologically active molecule more accessible to its target binding site.<br>
[0142] In one specific embodiment, the linker for interferon a is 15-25 amino<br>
acids long. In another specific embodiment, the linker for interferon a is 15-20 amino<br>
acids long. In another specific embodiment, the linker for interferon a is 10-25 amino<br>
acids long. In another specific embodiment, the linker for interferon a is 15 amino<br>
acids long. In one embodiment, the linker for interferon a is (GGGGS)n (SEQ ID<br><br>
NO:40) where G represents glycine, S represents serine and n is an integer from 1-<br>
10. In a specific embodiment, n is 3.<br>
[0143] The linker may also incorporate a moiety capable of being cleaved<br>
either chemically (e.g. hydrolysis of an ester bond), enzymatically (i.e. incorporation<br>
of a protease cleavage sequence) or photolytically (e.g.,a chromophore such as 3-<br>
amino-3-(2-nitrophenyl) proprionic acid (ANP)) in order to release the biologically<br>
active molecule from the Fc protein.<br>
4. Chimeric Protein Dimerization Using Specific Binding Partners<br>
[0144] In one embodiment, the chimeric protein of the invention comprises a<br>
first polypeptide chajn comprising at least a first domain, said first domain having at<br>
least one specific binding partner, and a second polypeptide chain comprising at<br>
least a second domain, wherein said second domain, is a specific binding partner of<br>
said first domain. The chimeric protein thus comprises a polypeptide capable of<br>
dimerizing with another polypeptide due to the interaction of the first domain and the<br>
second domain. Methods of dimerizing antibodies using heterologous domains are<br>
known in the art (U.S. Patent Nos.: 5,807,706 and 5,910,573; Kostelny et al. 1992, J.<br>
Immunol. 148(5): 1547).<br>
[0145] Dimerization can occur by formation of a covalent bond, or<br>
alternatively a non-covalent bond, e.g., hydrophobic interaction, Van der Waal's<br>
forces, interdigitation of amphiphilic peptides such as, but not limited to, alpha<br>
helices, charge-charge interactions of amino acids bearing opposite charges, such<br>
as, but not limited to, lysine and aspartic acid, arginine and glutamic acid. In one<br>
embodiment, the domain is a helix bundle comprising a helix, a turn and another<br>
helix. In another embodiment, the domain is a leucine zipper comprising a peptide<br>
47<br><br>
having several repeating amino acids in which every seventh amino acid is a leucine<br>
residue. In one embodiment, the specific binding partners are fos/jun. (see Branden<br>
et al. 1991, Introduction To Protein Structure, Garland Publishing, New York).<br>
[0146] In another embodiment, binding is mediated by a chemical linkage<br>
(see, e.g., Brennan et al. 1985, Science 229:81). In this embodiment, intact<br>
immunoglobulins, or chimeric proteins comprised of at least a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region are cleaved to generate heavy chain fragments.<br>
These fragments are reduced in the presence of the dithiol complexing agent<br>
sodium arsenite to stabilize vicinal dithiols and prevent intermolecular disulfide<br>
formation. The fragments generated are then converted to thionitrobenzoate (TNB)<br>
derivatives. One of the TNB derivatives is then reconverted to the heavy chain<br>
fragment thiol by reduction with mercaptoethylamine and is then mixed with an<br>
equimolar amount of the other TNB derivative to form a chimeric dimer.<br>
D. Nucleic Acids<br>
[0147] The invention relates to a first nucleic acid construct and a second<br>
nucleic acid construct each comprising a nucleic acid sequence encoding at least a<br>
portion of the chimeric protein of the invention. In one embodiment, the first nucleic<br>
acid construct comprises a nucleic acid sequence encoding a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region operatively linked to a second DNA sequence<br>
encoding a biologically active molecule, and said second DNA construct comprises a<br>
DNA sequence encoding an immunoglobulin constant region without the second<br>
DNA sequence encoding a biologically active molecule.<br>
[0148] The biologically active molecule can include, for example, but not as a<br>
limitation, a viral fusion inhibitor, a clotting factor, a growth factor or hormone, or a<br><br>
receptor, or analog, or fragment of any of the preceding. The nucleic acid<br>
sequencescwalsd include: additional sequences or elements known in the art (e.g.,<br>
promoters, enhancers, poly A sequences, affinity tags). In one embodiment, the<br>
nucleic acid sequence of the second construct can optionally include a nucleic acid<br>
sequence encoding a linker placed between the nucleic acid sequence encoding the<br>
biologically active molecule and the portion of the immunoglobulin constant region.<br>
The nucleic acid sequence of the second DNA construct can optionally include a<br>
linker sequence placed before or after the nucleic acid sequence encoding the<br>
biologically active molecule and/or the portion of the immunoglobulin constant<br>
region.<br>
[0149] In one embodiment, the nucleic acid construct is comprised of DNA. In<br>
another embodiment, the nucleic acid construct is comprised of RNA. The nucleic<br>
acid construct can be a vector, e.g., a viral vector or a plasmid. Examples of viral<br>
vectors include, but are not limited to adeno virus vector, an adeno associated virus<br>
vector or a murine leukemia virus vector. Examples of plasmids include but are not<br>
limited to pUC, pGEM and pGEX.<br>
[0150] In one embodiment, the nucleic acid construct comprises the nucleic<br>
acid sequence of figure 3a (SEQ ID NO:7). In one embodiment, the nucleic acid<br>
construct comprises the nucleic acid sequence of figure 3b (SEQ ID NO:9 ). In one<br>
embodiment, the nucleic acid construct comprises the nucleic acid sequence of<br>
figure 3c (SEQ ID NO:11). In one embodiment, the nucleic acid construct comprises<br>
the nucleic acid sequence of figure 3d (SEQ ID NO:13). In one embodiment, the<br>
nucleic acid construct comprises the nucleic acid sequence of figure 3e (SEQ ID<br>
NO:15). In one embodiment, the nucleic acid construct comprises the nucleic acid<br><br>
sequence of figure 3f (SEQ ID NO:17). In one embodiment, the nucleic acid<br>
construct comprises the nucleic acid sequence of figure 3g (SEQ ID NO:19). In one<br>
embodiment, the nucleic acid construct comprises the nucleic acid sequence of<br>
figure 3h (SEQ ID NO:21). In one embodiment, the nucleic acid construct comprises<br>
the nucleic acid sequence of figure 3i (SEQ ID NO:23). In one embodiment, the<br>
nucleic acid construct comprises the nucleic acid sequence of figure 3j (SEQ ID<br>
NO:25). In one embodiment, the nucleic acid construct comprises the nucleic acid<br>
sequence of figure 17a (SEQ ID NO:27).<br>
[0151] Due to the known degeneracy of the genetic code, wherein more than<br>
one codon can encode the same amino acid, a DNA sequence can vary from that<br>
shown in SEQ ID NOS:7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25 or 27 and still encode a<br>
polypeptide having the corresponding amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NOS:6, 8, 10,<br>
12,14,16,18, 20, 22, 24 or 26 respectively. Such variant DNA sequences can<br>
result from silent mutations (e.g. occurring during PCR amplification), or can be the<br>
product of deliberate mutagenesis of a native sequence. The invention thus<br>
provides isolated DNA sequences encoding polypeptides of the invention, chosen<br>
from: (a) DNA comprising the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NOS:7, 9, 11, 13, 15,<br>
17, 19, 21, 23, 25 or 27; (b) DNA encoding the polypeptides of SEQ ID NOS:6, 8,<br>
10,12,14,16, 18, 20, 22, 24 or 26; (c) DNA capable of hybridization to a DNA of (a)<br>
or (b) under conditions of moderate stringency and which encodes polypeptides of<br>
the invention; (d) DNA capable of hybridization to a DNA of (a) or (b) under<br>
conditions of high stringency and which encodes polypeptides of the invention, and<br>
(e) DNA which is degenerate as a result of the genetic code to a DNA defined in (a),<br>
S"<br><br>
(b), (c), or (d) and which encode polypeptides of the invention. Of course,<br>
polypeptides encoded by such UNA sequences are encompassed by the invention.<br>
[0152] In another embodiment, the nucleic acid molecules comprising a<br>
sequence encoding the chimeric protein of the invention can also comprise<br>
nucleotide sequences that are at least 80% identical to a native sequence. Also<br>
contemplated are embodiments in which a nucleic acid molecules comprising a<br>
sequence encoding the chimeric protein of the invention comprises a sequence that<br>
is at least 90% identical, at least 95% identical, at least 98% identical, at least 99%<br>
identical, or at least 99.9% identical to a native sequence. A native sequence can<br>
include any DNA sequence not altered by the human hand. The percent identity<br>
may be determined by visual inspection and mathematical calculation. Alternatively,<br>
the percent identity of two nucleic acid sequences can be determined by comparing<br>
sequence information using the GAP computer program, version 6.0 described by<br>
Devereux et al. 1984, Nucl. Acids Res. 12:387, and available from the University of<br>
Wisconsin Genetics Computer Group (UWGCG). The preferred default parameters<br>
for the GAP program include: (1) a unary comparison matrix (containing a value of 1<br>
for identities and 0 for non identities) for nucleotides, and the weighted comparison<br>
matrix of Gribskov and Burgess 1986, Nucl. Acids Res. 14:6745, as described by<br>
Schwartz and Dayhoff, eds. 1979, Atlas of Protein Sequence and Structure, National<br>
Biomedical Research Foundation, pp. 353-358; (2) a penalty of 3.0 for each gap and<br>
an additional 0.10 penalty for each symbol in each gap; and (3) no penalty for end<br>
gaps. Other programs used by one skilled in the art of sequence comparison may<br>
also be used.<br>

E. Synthesis of Chimeric Proteins<br>
[0153]X:Tnmeric~proteins comprising at least a portion of an immunoglobulin<br>
constant region and a biologically active molecule can be synthesized using<br>
techniques well known in the art. For example, the chimeric proteins of the invention<br>
can be synthesized recombinantly in cells (see, e.g., Sambrook et al. 1989,<br>
Molecular Cloning A Laboratory Manual, Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, N.Y. and<br>
Ausubel et al. 1989, Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Greene Publishing<br>
Associates and Wiley Interscience, N.Y.). Alternatively, the chimeric proteins of the<br>
invention can be synthesized using known synthetic methods such as solid phase<br>
synthesis. Synthetic techniques are well known in the art (see, e.g., Merr/field, 1973,<br>
Chemical Polypeptides, (Katsoyannis and Panayotis eds.) pp. 335-61; Merrifield<br>
1963, J. Am. Chem. Soc. 85:2149; Davis et al. 1985, Biochem. Intl. 10:394; Finn et<br>
al. 1976, The Proteins (3d ed.) 2:105; Erikson et al. 1976, The Proteins (3d ed.)<br>
2:257; U.S. Patent No. 3,941,763. Alternatively, the chimeric proteins of the<br>
invention can be synthesized using a combination of recombinant and synthetic<br>
methods. In certain applications, it may be beneficial to use either a recombinant<br>
method or a combination of recombinant and synthetic methods.<br>
[0154] Nucleic acids encoding a biologically active molecule can be readily<br>
synthesized using recombinant techniques well known in the art. Alternatively, the<br>
peptides themselves can be chemically synthesized. Nucleic acids of the invention<br>
may be synthesized by standard methods known in the art, e.g., by use of an<br>
automated DNA synthesizer (such as are commercially available from Biosearch,<br>
Applied Biosystems, etc.). As examples, phosphorothioate oligonucleotides may be<br>
synthesized by the method of Stein et al. 1988, Nucl. Acids Res. 16:3209,<br><br>
methylphosphonate oligonucleotides can be prepared by use of controlled pore<br>
glass polymer supports as described in Sarin et al. 1988, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA<br>
85:7448. Additional methods of nucleic acid synthesis are known in the art. (see,<br>
e.g., U.S. Patent Nos. 6,015,881; 6,281,331; 6,469,136).<br>
[0155] DNA sequences encoding immunoglobulin constant regions, or<br>
fragments thereof, may be cloned from a variety of genomic or cDNA libraries known<br>
in the art. The techniques for isolating such DNA sequences using probe-based<br>
methods are conventional techniques and are well known to those skilled in the art.<br>
Probes for isolating such DNA sequences may be based on published DNA<br>
sequences (see, for example, Hieter et al. 1980, Cell 22:197-207). The polymerase<br>
chain reaction (PCR) method disclosed by Mullis et al. (U.S. Patent No. 4,683,195)<br>
and Mullis (U.S. Patent No. 4,683,202) may be used. The choice of library and<br>
selection of probes for the isolation of such DNA sequences is within the level of<br>
ordinary skill in the art. Alternatively, DNA sequences encoding immunoglobulins or<br>
fragments thereof can be obtained from vectors known in the art to contain<br>
immunoglobulins or fragments thereof.<br>
[0156] For recombinant production, a first polynucleotide sequence encoding<br>
a portion of the chimeric protein of the invention (e.g. a portion of an immunoglobulin<br>
constant region) and a second polynucleotide sequence encoding a portion of the<br>
chimeric protein of the invention (e.g. a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region<br>
and a biologically active molecule) are inserted into appropriate expression vehicles,<br>
I.e. vectors which contains the necessary elements for the transcription and<br>
translation of the inserted coding sequence, or in the case of an RNA viral vector,<br>
S"Z<br><br>
the necessary elements for replication and translation. The nucleic acids encoding<br>
the chimeric protein are inserted into the vector in proper reading frame.<br>
[0157] The expression vehicles are then transfected or co-transfected into a<br>
suitable target cell, which will express the polypeptides. Transfection techniques<br>
known in the art include, but are not limited to, calcium phosphate precipitation<br>
(Wigler et al. 1978, Cell 14:725) and electroporation (Neumann et al. 1982, EMBO,<br>
J. 1:841), and liposome based reagents. A variety of host-expression vector<br>
systems may be utilized to express the chimeric proteins described herein including<br>
both prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells. These include, but are not limited to,<br>
microorganisms such as bacteria (e.g. E. coli) transformed with recombinant<br>
bacteriophage DNA or plasmid DNA expression vectors containing an appropriate<br>
coding sequence; yeast or filamentous fungi transformed with recombinant yeast or<br>
fungi expression vectors containing an appropriate coding sequence; insect cell<br>
systems infected with recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g. baculovirus)<br>
containing an appropriate coding sequence; plant cell systems infected with<br>
recombinant virus expression vectors (e.g. cauliflower mosaic virus or tobacco<br>
mosaic virus) or transformed with recombinant plasmid expression vectors (e.g. Ti<br>
plasmid) containing an appropriate coding sequence; or animal cell systems,<br>
including mammalian cells (e.g. CHO, Cos, HeLa cells).<br>
[0158] When the chimeric protein of the invention is recombinantly<br>
synthesized in a prokaryotic cell it may be desirable to refold the chimeric protein.<br>
The chimeric protein produced by this method can be refolded to a biologically active<br>
conformation using conditions known in the art, e.g., denaturing under reducing<br>
conditions and then dialyzed slowly into PBS.<br><br>
[0159] Depending on the expression system used, the expressed chimeric<br>
protein"is the"nIsolated byrpfocedures well-established in the art (e.g. affinity<br>
chromatography, size exclusion chromatography, ion exchange chromatography).<br>
[0160] The expression vectors can encode for tags that permit for easy<br>
purification of the recombinantly produced chimeric protein. Examples include, but<br>
are not limited to vector pUR278 (Ruther et al. 1983, EMBO J. 2:1791) in which the<br>
chimeric protein described herein coding sequences may be ligated into the vector in<br>
frame with the lac z coding region so that a hybrid protein is produced; pGEX<br>
vectors may be used to express chimeric proteins of the invention with a glutathione<br>
S-transferase (GST) tag. These proteins are usuaffy so/ubfe and can easify be<br>
purified from cells by adsorption to glutathione-agarose beads followed by elution in<br>
the presence of free glutathione. The vectors include cleavage sites (thrombin or<br>
Factor Xa protease or PreScission Protease™ (Pharmacia, Peapack, N.J.)) for easy<br>
removal of the tag after purification.<br>
[0161] To increase efficiency of production, the polynucleotides can be<br>
designed to encode multiple units of the chimeric protein of the invention separated<br>
by enzymatic cleavage sites. The resulting polypeptide can be cleaved (e.g. by<br>
treatment with the appropriate enzyme) in order to recover the polypeptide units.<br>
This can increase the yield of polypeptides driven by a single promoter. When used<br>
in appropriate viral expression systems, the translation of each polypeptide encoded<br>
by the mRNA is directed internally in the transcript; e.g., by an internal ribosome<br>
entry site, IRES. Thus, the polycistronic construct directs the transcription of a<br>
single, large polycistronic mRNA which, in turn, directs the translation of multiple,<br>
individual polypeptides. This approach eliminates the production and enzymatic<br><br>
processing of polyproteins and may significantly increase yield of polypeptide driven<br>
by a single promoter.<br>
[0162] Vectors used in transformation will usually contain a selectable marker<br>
used to identify transformants. In bacterial systems, this can include an antibiotic<br>
resistance gene such as ampicillin or kanamycin. Selectable markers for use in<br>
cultured mammalian cells include genes that confer resistance to drugs, such as<br>
neomycin, hygromycin, and methotrexate. The selectable marker may be an<br>
amplifiable selectable marker. One amplifiable selectable marker is the DHFR gene.<br>
Another amplifiable marker is the DHFR cDNA (Simonsen and Levinson 1983, Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 80:2495). Selectable markers are reviewed by Thilly<br>
(Mammalian Cell Technology, Butterworth Publishers, Stoneham, MA) and the<br>
choice of selectable markers is well within the level of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0163] Selectable markers may be introduced into the cell on a separate<br>
plasmid at the same time as the gene of interest, or they may be introduced on the<br>
same plasmid. If on the same plasmid, the selectable marker and the gene of<br>
interest may be under the control of different promoters or the same promoter, the<br>
latter arrangement producing a dicistronic message. Constructs of this type are<br>
known in the art (for example, U.S. Pat. No. 4,713,339).<br>
[0164] The expression elements of the expression systems vary in their<br>
strength and specificities. Depending on the host/vector system utilized, any of a<br>
number of suitable transcription and translation elements, including constitutive and<br>
inducible promoters, may be used in the expression vector. For example, when<br>
cloning in bacterial systems, inducible promoters such as pL of bacteriophage A,<br>
plac, ptrp, ptac (ptrp-lac hybrid promoter) and the like may be used; when cloning in<br>
J&gt;Z<br><br>
usedf when cloning in plantxeil systemsTpronTolWsnaeTived trom the aenome of<br>
plant cells (e.g. heat shock promoters; the promoter forthe small subunit of<br>
RUB1SCO; the promoter for the chlorophyll a/b binding protein) or from plant viruses<br>
(e.g. the 35S RNA promoter of CaMV; the coat protein promoter of TMV) may be<br>
used; when cloning in mammalian cell systems, promoters derived from the genome<br>
of mammalian cells (e.g. metallothionein promoter) or from mammalian viruses (e.g.<br>
the adenovirus late promoter; the vaccinia virus 7.5 K promoter) may be used; when<br>
generating ceil lines that contain muiiipie copies of expression product, SV40-, BPV-<br>
and EBV-based vectors may be used with an appropriate selectable marker.<br>
[0165] In cases where plant expression vectors are used, the expression of<br>
sequences encoding linear or non-cyclized forms of the chimeric proteins of the<br>
invention may be driven by any of a number of promoters. For example, viral<br>
promoters such as the 35S RNA and 19S RNA promoters of CaMV (Brissori et al.<br>
1984, Nature 310:511-514), or the coat protein promoter of TMV (Takamatsu et al.<br>
1987, EMBO J. 6:307-311) may be used; alternatively, plant promoters such as the<br>
small subunit of RUBISCO (Coruzzi et al. 1984, EMBO J. 3:1671-1680; Broglie et al.<br>
1984, Science 224:838-843) or heat shock promoters, e.g., soybean hsp17.5-E or<br>
hsp17.3-B (Gurley et al. 1986, Mol. Cell. Biol. 6:559-565) may be used. These<br>
constructs can be introduced into plant cells using Ti plasmids, Ri plasmids, plant<br>
virus vectors, direct DNA transformation, microinjection, electroporation, etc. For<br>
reviews of such techniques see, e.g., Weissbach &amp; Weissbach 1988, Methods for<br>
Plant Molecular Biology, Academic Press, NY, Section VIII, pp. 421-463; and<br>

an AcNPV promoter (for example, the polyhedron promoter). Successful insertion of<br>
a coding sequence will result in inactivation of the polyhedron gene and production<br>
of non-occluded recombinant virus (i.e. virus lacking the proteinaceous coat coded<br>
for by the poiyhedron gene). These recombinant viruses are then used to infect<br>
Spodoptera frugiperda cells in which the inserted gene is expressed, (see, e.g.,<br>
Smith et al. 1983, J. Virol. 46:584; U.S. Patent No. 4,215,051). Further examples of<br>
this expression system may be found in Ausubel et al., eds. 1989, Current Protocols<br>
in Molecular Biology, Vol. 2, Greene Publish. Assoc. &amp; Wiley Interscience.<br>
[0167] Another system which can be used to express the chimeric proteins of<br>
the invention is the glutamine synthetase gene expression system, also referred to<br>
as the "GS expression system" (Lonza Biologies PLC, Berkshire UK). This<br>
expression system is described in detail in U.S. Patent No. 5,981,216.<br>
[0168] In mammalian host cells, a number of viral based expression systems<br>
may be utilized. In cases where an adenovirus is used as an expression vector, a<br>
coding sequence may be ligated to an adenovirus transcription/translation control<br>
complex, e.g., the late promoter and tripartite leader sequence. This chimeric gene<br>
may then be inserted in the adenovirus genome by in vitro or in vivo recombination.<br>
Insertion in a non-essential region of the viral genome (e.g. region E1 or E3) will<br>
result in a recombinant virus that is viable and capable of expressing peptide in<br>
J-S<br><br>
infected hosts (see, e.g., Logan &amp; Shenk 1984, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 81:3655).<br>
Alternatively, the vaccinia 7.5K~promoter may be used (see, e.g., Mackett et al.<br>
1982, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79:7415; Mackett et al. 1984, J. Virol. 49:857;<br>
Panicali et al. 1982, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79:4927).<br>

Alternatively, the vaccinia 7.5 K promoter may be used (see, e.g., Mackett et al.<br>
1982, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79:7415; Mackett et al. 1984, J. Virol. 49:857;<br>
Panicali et al. 1982, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 79:4927).<br>
[0170] Host cells containing DNA constructs of the chimeric protein are grown<br>
in an appropriate growth medium. As used herein, the term "appropriate growth<br>
medium" means a medium containing nutrients required for the growth of cells.<br>
Nutrients required for cell growth may include a carbon source, a nitrogen source,<br>
essential amino acids, vitamins, minerals and growth factors. Optionally the media<br>
can contain bovine calf serum or fetal calf serum. In one embodiment, the media<br>
contains substantially no IgG. The growth medium will generally select for cells<br>
containing the DNA construct by, for example, drug selection or deficiency in an<br>
essential nutrient which is complemented by the selectable marker on the DNA<br>
construct or co-transfected with the DNA construct. Cultured mammalian cells are<br><br><br>
generally grown in commercially available serum-containing or serum-free media<br>
Xe.gTMEM, DMEM). Selection of a medium appropriate for the particular cell line<br>
used is within the level of ordinary skill in the art.<br>
[0171] The recombinantly produced chimeric protein of the invention can be<br>
isolated from the culture media. The culture medium from appropriately grown<br>
transformed or transfected host cells is separated from the cell material, and the<br>
presence of chimeric proteins is demonstrated. One method of detecting the<br>
chimeric proteins, for example, is by the binding of the chimeric proteins or portions<br>
of the chimeric proteins to a specific antibody recognizing the chimeric protein of the<br>
invention. An anti-chimeric protein antibody may be a monoclonal or polyclonal<br>
antibody raised against the chimeric protein in question. For example, the chimeric<br>
protein contains at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region. Antibodies<br>
recognizing the constant region of many immunoglobulins are known in the art and<br>
are commercially available. An antibody can be used to perform an ELISA or a<br>
western blot to detect the presence of the chimeric protein of the invention.<br>
[0172] The chimeric protein of the invention can be synthesized in a<br>
transgenic animal, such as a rodent, cow, pig, sheep, or goat. The term "transgenic<br>
animals" refers to non-human animals that have incorporated a foreign gene into<br>
their genome. Because this gene is present in germline tissues, it is passed from<br>
parent to offspring. Exogenous genes are introduced into single-celled embryos<br>
(Brinster et a!. 1985, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 82:4438). Methods of producing<br>
transgenic animals are known in the art, including transgenics that produce<br>
immunoglobulin molecules (Wagner et al. 1981, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 78:6376;<br>
McKnight et al. 1983, Cell 34:335; Brinster et al. 1983, Nature 306:332; Ritchie et al.<br>

2003, Theriogenology 59:107; Malassagne et al. 2003, Xenotransplantation<br>
10(3):267).<br>
[0173] The chimeric protein of the invention can also be produced by a<br>
combination of synthetic chemistry and recombinant techniques. For example, the<br>
portion of an immunoglobulin constant region can be expressed recombinantly as<br>
described above. The biologically active molecule, can be produced using known<br>
chemical synthesis techniques (e.g. solid phase synthesis).<br>
[0174] The portion of an immunoglobulin constant region can be ligated to the<br>
biologically active molecule using appropriate ligation chemistry and then combined<br>
with a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region that has not been ligated to a<br>
biologically active molecule to form the chimeric protein of the invention. In one<br>
embodiment, the portion of an immunoglobulin constant region is an Fc fragment.<br>
The Fc fragment can be recombinantly produced to form Cys-Fc and reacted with a<br>
biologically active molecule expressing a thioester to make a monomer-dimer hybrid.<br>
In another embodiment, an Fc-thioester is made and reacted with a biologically<br>
active molecule expressing an N terminus Cysteine (Figure 4).<br>
[0175] In one embodiment, the portion of an immunoglobulin constant region<br>
ligated to the biologically active molecule will form homodimers. The homodimers<br>
can be disrupted by exposing the homodimers to denaturing and reducing conditions<br>
(e.g. beta-mercaptoethanol and 8M urea) and then subsequently combined with a<br>
portion of an immunoglobulin constant region not linked to a biologically active<br>
molecule to form monomer-dimer hybrids. The monomer-dimer hybrids are then<br><br>
renatured and refolded by dialyzing into PBS and isolated, e.g., by size exclusion or<br>
affinity chromatography.<br>
[0176] In another embodiment, the portion of an immunoglobulin constant<br>
region will form homodimers before being linked to a biologically active molecule. In<br>
this embodiment, reaction conditions for linking the biologically active molecule to<br>
the homodimer can be adjusted such that linkage of the biologically active molecule<br>
to only one chain of the homodimer is favored (e.g. by adjusting the molar<br>
equivalents of each reaetant).<br>
[0177] The biologically active molecule can be chemically synthesized with an<br>
N terminal cysteine. The sequence encoding a portion of an immunoglobulin<br>
constant region can be sub-cloned into a vector encoding intein linked to a chitin<br>
binding domain (New England Biolabs, Beverly, MA). The intein can be linked to the<br>
C terminus of the portion of an immunoglobulin constant region. In one<br>
embodiment, the portion of the immunoglobulin with the intein linked to its C<br>
terminus can be expressed in a prokaryotic cell. In another embodiment, the portion<br>
of the immunoglobulin with the intein linked to its C terminus can be expressed in a<br>
eukaryotic cell. The portion of immunoglobulin constant region linked to intein can<br>
be reacted with MESNA. In one embodiment, the portion of an immunoglobulin<br>
constant region linked to intein is bound to a column, e.g., a chitin column and then<br>
eluted with MESNA. The biologically active molecule and portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin can be reacted together such that nucleophilic rearrangement<br>
occurs and the biologically active molecule is covalently linked to the portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin via an amide bond. (Dawsen et al. 2000, Annu. Rev. Biochem.<br>
69:923). The chimeric protein synthesized this way can optionally include a linker<br><br>
peptide between the portion of an immunoglobulin and the biologically active<br>
molecule. The linker can for example be synthesized on the N terminus of the<br>
biologically active molecule. Linkers can include peptides and/or organic molecules<br>
(e.g. polyethylene glycol and/or short amino acid sequences). This combined<br>
recombinant and chemical synthesis allows for the rapid screening of biologically<br>
active molecules and linkers to optimize desired properties of the chimeric protein of<br>
the invention, e.g., viral inhibition, hemostasis, production of red blood cells,<br>
biological half-life, stability, binding to serum proteins or some other property of the<br>
chimeric protein. The method also allows for the incorporation of non-natural amino<br>
acids into the chimeric protein of the invention which may be useful for optimizing a<br>
desired property of the chimeric protein of the invention. If desired, the chimeric<br>
protein produced by this method can be refolded to a biologically active<br>
conformation using conditions known in the art, e.g., reducing conditions and then<br>
dialyzed slowly into PBS.<br>
[0178] Alternatively, the N-terminal cysteine can be on the portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region, e.g., an Fc fragment. An Fc fragment can be<br>
generated with an N- terminal cysteine by taking advantage of the fact that a native<br>
Fc has a cysteine at position 226 (see Kabat et al. 1991, Sequences of Proteins of<br>
Immunological Interest, U.S. Department of Public Health, Bethesda, MD).<br>
[0179] To expose a terminal cysteine, an Fc fragment can be recombinantly<br>
expressed. In one embodiment, the Fc fragment is expressed in a prokaryotic cell,<br>
e.g., E.coli. The sequence encoding the Fc portion beginning with Cys 226 (EU<br>
numbering) can be placed immediately following a sequence endcoding a signal<br>
peptide, e.g., OmpA, PhoA, STII. The prokaryotic cell can be osmotically shocked to<br><br>
release the recombinant Fc fragment. In another embodiment, the Fc fragment is<br>
produced in a eukaryotic cell, e.g., a CHO cell, a BHK cell. The sequence encoding<br>
the Fc portion fragment can be placed directly following a sequence encoding a<br>
signal peptide, e.g., mouse IgK light chain or MHC class I Kb signal sequence, such<br>
that when the recombinant chimeric protein is synthesized by a eukaryotic cell, the<br>
signal sequence will be cleaved, leaving an N terminal cysteine which can than be<br>
isolated and chemically reacted with a molecule bearing a thioester (e.g. a C<br>
terminal thioester if the molecule is comprised of amino acids).<br>
[0180] The N terminal cysteine on an Fc fragment can also be generated<br>
using an enzyme that cleaves its substrate at its N terminus, e.g., Factor Xa,<br>
enterokinase, and the product isolated and reacted with a molecule with a thioester.<br>
[0181] The recombinantly expressed Fc fragment can be used to make<br>
homodimers or monomer-dimer hybrids.<br>
[0182] In a specific embodiment, an Fc fragment is expressed with the human<br>
a interferon signal peptide adjacent to the Cys at position 226. When a construct<br>
encoding this polypeptide is expressed in CHO cells, the CHO cells cleave the signal<br>
peptide at two distinct positions (at Cys 226 and at Val within the signal peptide 2<br>
amino acids upstream in the N terminus direction). This generates a mixture of two<br>
species of Fc fragments (one with an N-terminal Val and one with an N-terminal<br>
Cys). This in turn results in a mixture of dimeric species (homodimers with terminal<br>
Val, homodimers with terminal Cys and heterodimers where one chain has a<br>
terminal Cys and the other chain has a terminal Val). The Fc fragments can be<br>
reacted with a biologically active molecule having a C terminal thioester and the<br>
resulting monomer-dimer hybrid can be isolated from the mixture (e.g. by size<br><br>
exclusion chromatography). It is contemplated that when other signal peptide<br>
sequences are used for expression of Fc fragments in CHO cells a mixture of<br>
species of Fc fragments with at least two different N termini will be generated.<br>
[0183] In another embodiment, a recombinantly produced Cys-Fc can form a<br>
homodimer. The homodimer can be reacted with peptide that has a branched linker<br>
on the C terminus, wherein the branched linker has two C terminal thioesters that<br>
can be reacted with the Cys-Fc. In another embodiment, the biologically active<br>
molecule has a single non-terminal thioester that can be reacted with Cys-Fc.<br>
Alternatively, the branched linker can have two C terminal cysteines that can be<br>
reacted with an Fc thioester. In another embodiment, the branched linker has two<br>
functional groups that can be reacted with the Fc thioester, e.g., 2-mercaptoamine.<br>
The biologically active molecule may be comprised of amino acids. The biologically<br>
active molecule may include a small organic molecule or a small inorganic molecule.<br>
F. Methods of Using Chimeric Proteins<br>
[0184] The chimeric proteins of the invention have many uses as will be<br>
recognized by one skilled in the art, including, but not limited to methods of treating a<br>
subject with a disease or condition. The disease or condition can include, but is not<br>
limited to, a viral infection, a hemostatic disorder, anemia, cancer, leukemia, an<br>
inflammatory condition or an autoimmune disease (e.g. arthritis, psoriasis, lupus<br>
erythematosus, multiple sclerosis), or a bacterial infection (see, e.g., U.S. Patent<br>
Nos. 6,086,875, 6,030,613, 6,485,726; WO 03/077834; US2003-0235536A1).<br>
1. Methods of Treating a Subject with a Red Blood Cell Deficiency<br>
[0185] The invention relates to a method of treating a subject having a<br>
deficiency of red blood cells, e.g., anemia, comprising administering a<br><br>
therapeutically effective amount of at least one chimeric protein, wherein the<br>
chimeric protein comprises a first and a second polypeptide chain, wherein the first<br>
chain comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region and at least<br>
one agent capable of inducing proliferation of red blood cells, e.g., EPO, and the<br>
second polypeptide chain comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin without<br>
the agent capable of inducing red blood cell proliferation of the first chain.<br>
2. Methods of Treating a Subject with a Viral Infection<br>
[0186] The invention relates to a method of treating a subject having a viral<br>
infection or exposed to a virus comprising administering a therapeutically effective<br>
amount of at least one chimeric protein, wherein the chimeric protein comprises a<br>
first and a second polypeptide chain, wherein the first chain comprises at least a<br>
portion of an immunoglobulin constant region and at least one antiviral agent, e.g., a<br>
fusion inhibitor or interferon a and the second polypeptide chain comprises at least a<br>
portion of an immunoglobulin without the antiviral agent of the first chain. In one<br>
embodiment, the subject is infected with a virus which can be treated with IFNa, e.g.,<br>
hepatitis C virus. In one embodiment, the subject is infected with HIV, such as HIV-<br>
1 or HIV-2.<br>
[0187] In one embodiment, the chimeric protein of the invention inhibits viral<br>
replication. In one embodiment, the chimeric protein of the invention prevents or<br>
inhibits viral entry into target cells, thereby stopping, preventing, or limiting the<br>
spread of a viral infection in a subject and decreasing the viral burden in an infected<br>
subject. By linking a portion of an immunoglobulin to a viral fusion inhibitor the<br>
invention provides a chimeric protein with viral fusion inhibitory activity with greater<br>
stability and greater bioavailability compared to viral fusion inhibitors alone, e.g.,<br>
$4<br><br>
T20, T21, T1249. Thus, in one embodiment, the viral fusion inhibitor decreases or<br>
preventsrHIVlnfetloTrdTalarget cell, e.g., HIV-1.<br>
a. Conditions That May Be Treated<br>
[0188] The chimeric protein of the invention can be used to inhibit or prevent<br>
the infection of a target cell by a hepatitis virus, e.g., hepatitis virus C. The chimeric<br>
protein may comprise an anti-viral agent which inhibits viral replication.<br>
[0189] In one embodiment, the chimeric protein of the invention comprises a<br>
fusion inhibitor. The chimeric protein of the invention can be used to inhibit or<br>
prevent the infection of any target cell by any virus (see, e.g., U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
6,086,875, 6,030,613, 6,485,726; WO 03/077834; US2003-0235536A1). In one<br>
embodiment, the virus is an enveloped virus such as, but not limited to HIV, SIV,<br>
measles, influenza, Epstein-Barr virus, respiratory syncytia virus, or parainfluenza<br>
virus. In another embodiment, the virus is a non-enveloped virus such as rhino virus<br>
or polio virus<br>
[0190] The chimeric protein of the invention can be used to treat a subject<br>
already infected with a virus. The subject can be acutely infected with a virus.<br>
Alternatively, the subject can be chronically infected with a virus. The chimeric<br>
protein of the invention can also be used to prophylactically treat a subject at risk for<br>
contracting a viral infection, e.g., a subject known or believed to in close contact with<br>
a virus or subject believed to be infected or carrying a virus. The chimeric protein of<br>
the invention can be used to treat a subject who may have been exposed to a virus,<br>
but who has not yet been positively diagnosed.<br>
[0191] In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method of treating a<br>
subject infected with HCV comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically<br>
67<br><br>
effective amount of a chimeric protein, wherein the chimeric protein comprises an Fc<br>
fragment of an IgG and a cytokine, e.g., IFNa.<br>
[0192] In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method of treating a<br>
subject infected with HIV comprising administering to the subject a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of a chimeric protein wherein the chimeric protein comprises an Fc<br>
fragment of an IgG and the viral fusion inhibitor comprises T20.<br>
3. Methods of Treating a Subject Having a Hemostatic Disorder<br>
[0193] The invention relates to a method of treating a subject having a<br>
hemostatic disorder comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of at<br>
least one chimeric protein, wherein the chimeric protein comprises a first and a<br>
second chain, wherein the first chain comprises at least one clotting factor and at<br>
least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region, and the second chain<br>
comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region.<br>
[0194] The chimeric protein of the invention treats or prevents a hemostatic<br>
disorder by promoting the formation of a fibrin clot. The chimeric protein of the<br>
invention can activate any member of a coagulation cascade. The clotting factor can<br>
be a participant in the extrinsic pathway, the intrinsic pathway or both. In one<br>
embodiment, the clotting factor is Factor VII or Factor Vila. Factor Vila can activate<br>
Factor X which interacts with Factor Va to cleave prothrombin to thrombin, which in<br>
turn cleaves fibrinogen to fibrin. In another embodiment, the clotting factor is Factor<br>
IX or Factor IXa. In yet another embodiment, the clotting factor is Factor VIII or<br>
Factor Villa. In yet another embodiment, the clotting factor is von Willebrand Factor,<br>
Factor XI, Factor XII, Factor V, Factor X or Factor XIII.<br>
&amp;*<br><br>
a. Conditions That May Be Treated<br>
[0195]This- chimericprotein_onhe~fnen1ioTrcan be used "tolfeat any<br>
hemostatic disorder. The hemostatic disorders that may be treated by<br>
administration of the chimeric protein of the invention include, but are not limited to,<br>
hemophilia A, hemophilia B, von Willebrand's disease, Factor XI deficiency (PTA<br>
deficiency), Factor XII deficiency, as well as deficiencies or structural abnormalities<br>
in fibrinogen, prothrombin, Factor V, Factor VII, Factor X, or Factor XIII.<br>
[0196] In one embodiment, the hemostatic disorder is an inherited disorder.<br>
In one embodiment, the subject has hemophilia A, and the chimeric protein<br>
comprises Factor VIII or Factor Villa. In another embodiment, the subject has<br>
hemophilia A and the chimeric protein comprises Factor VII or Factor Vila. In<br>

Villa and the chimeric protein comprises Factor VII or Factor Vila. In yet another<br>
embodiment, the subject has inhibitory antibodies against Factor IX or Factor IXa<br>
and the chimeric protein comprises Factor VII or Factor Vila.<br>
[0197] The chimeric protein of the invention can be used to prophylactically<br>
treat a subject with a hemostatic disorder. The chimeric protein of the invention can<br>
be used to treat an acute bleeding episode in a subject with a hemostatic disorder<br>
[0198] In one embodiment, the hemostatic disorder is the result of a<br>
deficiency in a clotting factor, e.g., Factor IX, Factor VIII. In another embodiment,<br>
&amp;&gt;y<br><br>
the hemostatic disorder can be the result of a defective clotting factor, e.g., von<br>
Willebrand's Factor.<br>
[0199] In another embodiment, the hemostatic disorder can be an acquired<br>
disorder. The acquired disorder can result from an underlying secondary disease or<br>
condition. The unrelated condition can be, as an example, but not as a limitation,<br>
cancer, an autoimmune disease, or pregnancy. The acquired disorder can result<br>
from old age or from medication to treat an underlying secondary disorder (e.g.<br>
cancer chemotherapy).<br>
4. Methods of Treating a Subject In Need of a General Hemostatic<br>
Agent<br>
[0200] The invention also relates to methods of treating a subject that does<br>
not have a hemostatic disorder or a secondary disease or condition resulting in<br>
acquisition of a hemostatic disorder. The invention thus relates to a method of<br>
treating a subject in need of a general hemostatic agent comprising administering a<br>
therapeutically effective amount of at least one chimeric protein, wherein the<br>
chimeric protein comprises a first and a second polypeptide chain wherein the first<br>
polypeptide chain comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region<br>
and at least one clotting factor and the second chain comprises at least a portion of<br>
an immunoglobulin constant region without the clotting factor of the first polypeptide<br>
chain.<br>
a. Conditions That May Be Treated<br>
[0201] In one embodiment, the subject in need of a general hemostatic agent<br>
is undergoing, or is about to undergo, surgery. The chimeric protein of the invention<br>
can be administered prior to or after surgery as a prophylactic. The chimeric protein<br>
2t&gt;<br><br>
of the invention can be administered during or after surgery to control an acute<br>
bleeding episode. The surgery can include, but is not limited to, liver transplantation,<br>
liver resection, or stem cell transplantation.<br>
[0202] The chimeric protein of the invention can be used to treat a subject<br>
having an acute bleeding episode who does not have a hemostatic disorder. The<br>
acute bleeding episode can result from severe trauma, e.g., surgery, an automobile<br>
accident, wound, laceration gun shot, or any other traumatic event resulting in<br>
uncontrolled bleeding.<br>
5. Treatment Modalities<br>
[0203] The chimeric protein of the invention can be administered<br>
intravenously, subcutaneously, intra-muscularly, or via any mucosal surface, e.g.,<br>
orally, sublingually, buccally, sublingually, nasally, rectally, vaginally or via<br>
pulmonary route. The chimeric protein can be implanted within or linked to a<br>
biopolymer solid support that allows for the slow release of the chimeric protein to<br>
the desired site.<br>
[0204] The dose of the chimeric protein of the invention will vary depending<br>
on the subject and upon the particular route of administration used. Dosages can<br>
range from 0.1 to 100,000 ug/kg body weight. In one embodiment, the dosing range<br>
is 0.1-1,000 ug/kg. The protein can be administered continuously or at specific<br>
timed intervals. In vitro assays may be employed to determine optimal dose ranges<br>
and/or schedules for administration. Many in vitro assays that measure viral<br>
infectivity are known in the art. For example, a reverse transcriptase assay, or an rt<br>
PCR assay or branched DNA assay can be used to measure HIV concentrations. A<br>
7/<br><br>
StaClot assay can be used to measure clotting activity. Additionally, effective doses<br>
may be extrapolated from dose-response curves obtained from animal models.<br>
[0205] The invention also relates to a pharmaceutical composition comprising<br>
a viral fusion inhibitor, at least a portion of an immunoglobulin and a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient. Examples of suitable<br>
pharmaceutical carriers are described in Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences by<br>
E.W..Martin. Examples of excipients can include starch, glucose, lactose, sucrose,<br>
gelatin, malt, rice, flour, chalk, silica gel, sodium stearate, glycerol monostearate,<br>
talc, sodium chloride, dried skim milk, glycerol, propylene, glycol, water, ethanol, and<br>
the like. The composition can also contain pH buffering reagents, and wetting or<br>
emulsifying agents.<br>
[0206] For oral administration, the pharmaceutical composition can take the<br>
form of tablets or capsules prepared by conventional means. The composition can<br>
also be prepared as a liquid for example a syrup or a suspension. The liquid can<br>
include suspending agents (e.g. sorbitol syrup, cellulose derivatives or hydrogenated<br>
edible fats), emulsifying agents (lecithin or acacia), non-aqueous vehicles (e.g.<br>
almond oil, oily, esters, ethyl alcohol, or fractionated vegetable oils), and<br>
preservatives (e.g. methyl or propyl -p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid). The<br>
preparations can also include flavoring, coloring and sweetening agents.<br>
Alternatively, the composition can be presented as a dry product for constitution with<br>
water or another suitable vehicle.<br>
[0207] For buccal and sublingual administration the composition may take the<br>
form of tablets, lozenges or fast dissolving films according to conventional protocols.<br>
71-<br><br>
[0208] For administration by inhalation, the compounds for use according to<br>
the present invention are conveniently delivered in theTorm of arTaerosol spray from<br>
a pressurized pack or nebulizer (e.g. in PBS), with a suitable propellant, e.g.,<br>
dichlorodifluoromethane, trichlorofluoromethane, dichlorotetrafluoromethane, carbon<br>
dioxide or other suitable gas. In the case of a pressurized aerosol the dosage unit<br>
can be determined by providing a valve to deliver a metered amount. Capsules and<br>
cartridges of, e.g., gelatin for use in an inhaler or insufflator can be formulated<br>
containing a powder mix of the compound and a suitable powder base such as<br>
lactose or starch.<br>
[0209] The pharmaceutical composition can be formulated for parenteral<br>
administration (i.e. intravenous or intramuscular) by bolus injection. Formulations for<br>
injection can be presented in unit dosage form, e.g., in ampoules or in multidose<br>
containers with an added preservative. The compositions can take such forms as<br>
suspensions, solutions, or emulsions in oily or aqueous vehicles, and contain<br>
formulatory agents such as suspending, stabilizing and/or dispersing agents.<br>
Alternatively, the active ingredient can be in powder form for constitution with a<br>
suitable vehicle, e.g., pyrogen free water.<br>
[0210] The pharmaceutical composition can also be formulated for rectal<br>
administration as a suppository or retention enema, e.g., containing conventional<br>
suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other glycerides.<br>

6. Combination Therapy<br>
[0211] The chimeric protein of the invention can be used to treat a subject<br>
with a disease or condition in combination with at least one other known agent to<br>
treat said disease or condition.<br>
[0212] In one embodiment, the invention relates to a method of treating a<br>
subject infected with HIV comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount<br>
of at least one chimeric protein comprising a first and a second chain, wherein the<br>
first chain comprises an HIV fusion inhibitor and at least a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region and the second chain comprises at least a portion<br>
of an immunoglobulin without an HIV fusion inhibitor of the first chain, in combination<br>
with at least one other anti-HIV agent. Said other anti-HIV agent can be any<br>
therapeutic with demonstrated anti-HIV activity. Said other anti-HIV agent can<br>
include, as an example, but not as a limitation, a protease inhibitor (e.g.<br>
Amprenavir®, Crixivan®, Ritonivir®), a reverse transcriptase nucleoside analog (e.g.<br>
AZT, DDI, D4T, 3TC, Ziagen®), a nonnucleoside analog reverse transcriptase<br>
inhibitor (e.g. Sustiva®), another HIV fusion inhibitor, a neutralizing antibody specific<br>
to HIV, an antibody specific to CD4, a CD4 mimic, e.g., CD4-lgG2 fusion protein<br>
(U.S. Patent Application 09/912,824) or an antibody specific to CCR5, or CXCR4, or<br>
a specific binding partner of CCR5, or CXCR4.<br>
[0213] In another embodiment, the invention relates to a method of treating a<br>
subject with a hemostatic disorder comprising administering a therapeutically<br>
effective amount of at least one chimeric protein comprising a first and a second<br>
chain, wherein the first chain comprises at least one clotting factor and at least a<br>

promotes hemostasis. Said other clotting factor or agent that promotes hemostasis<br>
can be any therapeutic with demonstrated clotting activity. As an example, but not<br>
as a limitation, the clotting factor or hemostatic agent can include Factor V, Factor<br>
VII, Factor VIII, Factor IX, Factor X, Factor XI, Factor XII, Factor XIII, prothrombin, or<br>
fibrinogen or activated forms of any of the preceding. The clotting factor of<br>
hemostatic agent can also include anti-fibrinolytic drugs, e.g., epsilon-amino-caproic<br>
acid, tranexamic acid.<br>
7. Methods of Inhibiting Viral Fusion With a Target Cell<br>
[0214] The invention also relates to an in vitro method of inhibiting HIV fusion<br>
with a mammalian cell comprising combining the mammalian cell with at least one<br>
chimeric protein, wherein the chimeric protein comprises a first and a second chain,<br>
wherein the first chain comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant<br>
region and an HIV inhibitor and the second chain comprises at least a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region without the HIV inhibitor of the first chain. The<br>
mammalian cell can include any cell or cell line susceptible to infection by HIV<br>
including but not limited to primary human CD4+ T cells or macrophages, MOLT-4<br>
cells, CEM cells, AA5 cells or HeLa cells which express CD4 on the cell surface.<br>
G. Methods of Isolating Chimeric Proteins<br>
[0215] Typically, when chimeric proteins of the invention are produced they<br>
are contained in a mixture of other molecules such as other proteins or protein<br>
fragments. The invention thus provides for methods of isolating any of the chimeric<br>
proteins described supra from a mixture containing the chimeric proteins. It has<br><br>
been determined that the chimeric proteins of the invention bind to dye ligands under<br>
suitable conditions and that altering those conditions subsequent to binding can<br>
disrupt the bond between the dye ligand and the chimeric protein, thereby providing<br>
a method of isolating the chimeric protein. In some embodiments the mixture may<br>
comprise a monomer-dimer hybrid, a dimer and at least a portion of an<br>
immunoglobulin constant region, e.g., an Fc. Thus, in one embodiment, the<br>
invention provides a method of isolating a monomer-dimer hybrid. In another<br>
embodiment, the invention provides a method of isolating a dimer.<br>
[0216] Accordingly, in one embodiment, the invention provides a method of<br>
isolating a monomer-dimer hybrid from a mixture, where the mixture comprises<br>
a)	the monomer-dimer hybrid comprising a first and second polypeptide<br>
chain, wherein the first chain comprises a biologically active molecule, and at least a<br>
portion of an immunoglobulin constant region and wherein the second chain<br>
comprises at least a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region without a<br>
biologically active molecule or immunoglobulin variable region;<br>
b)	a dimer comprising a first and second polypeptide chain, wherein the first<br>
and second chains both comprise a biologically active molecule, and at least a<br>
portion of an immunoglobulin constant region; and<br>
c)	a portion of an immunoglobulin constant region; said method comprising<br><br>
1)	contacting the mixture with a dye ligand linked to a solid support<br>
under suitable conditions such that both the monomer-dimer hybrid and the dimer<br>
bind to the dye ligand;<br>
2)	removing the unbound portion of an immunoglobulin constant<br>
region;<br><br>
3)	altering the suitable conditions of 1) such that the binding<br>
freWeerffffe monomer-dirTieTlTybTid and the dye Ngand linked to the solid support is<br>
disrupted;<br>
4)	isolating the monomer-dimer hybrid.<br>
In some embodiments, prior to contacting the mixture with a dye ligand, the mixture<br>
may be contacted with a chromatographic substance such as protein A sepharose or<br>
the like. The mixture is eluted from the chromatographic substance using an<br>
appropriate elution buffer (e.g. a low pH buffer) and the eluate containing the mixture<br>
is then contacted with the dye ligand.<br>
[0217] Suitable conditions for contacting the mixture with the dye ligand may<br>
include a buffer to maintain the mixture at an appropriate pH. An appropriate pH<br>
may include a pH of from, 3-10, 4-9, 5-8. In one embodiment, the appropriate pH is<br>
8.0. Any buffering agent known in the art may be used so long as it maintains the<br>
pH in the appropriate range, e.g., tris, HEPES, PIPES, MOPS. Suitable conditions<br>
may also include a wash buffer to elute unbound species from the dye ligand. The<br>
wash buffer may be any buffer which does not disrupt binding of a bound species.<br>
For example, the wash buffer can be the same buffer used in the contacting step.<br>
[0218] Once the chimeric protein is bound to the dye ligand, the chimeric<br>
protein is isolated by altering the suitable conditions. Altering the suitable conditions<br>
may include the addition of a salt to the buffer. Any salt may be used, e.g., NaCI,<br>
KCI. The salt should be added at a concentration that is high enough to disrupt the<br>
binding between the dye ligand and the desired species, e.g., a monomer-dimer<br>
hybrid.<br>
71<br><br>
[0219] In some embodiments where the mixture is comprised of an Fc, a<br>
monomer-dimer hybrid, and a dinner, it has been found that the Fc does not bind to<br>
the dye ligand and thus elutes with the flow through. The dimer binds more tightly to<br>
the dye ligand than the monomer-dimer hybrid. Thus a higher concentration of salt<br>
is required to disrupt the bond (e.g. elute) between the dimer and the dye ligand<br>
compared to the salt concentration required to disrupt the bond between the dye<br>
ligand and the monomer-dimer hybrid.<br>
[0220] In some embodiments NaCI may be used to isolate the monomer-<br>
dimer hybrid from the mixture. In some embodiments the appropriate concentration<br>
of salt which disrupts the bond between the dye ligand and the monomer-dimer<br>
hybrid is from 200-700 mM, 300-600 mM, 400:500 mM. In one embodiment, the<br>
concentration of NaCI required to disrupt the binding between the dye ligand the<br>
monomer-dimer hybrid is 400 mM.<br>
[0221] NaCI may also be used to isolate the dimer from the mixture.<br>
Typically, the monomer-dimer hybrid is isolated from the mixture before the dimer.<br>
The dimer is isolated by adding an appropriate concentration of salt to the buffer,<br>
thereby disrupting the binding between the dye ligand and the dimer. In some<br>
embodiments the appropriate concentration of salt which disrupts the bond between<br>
the dye ligand and the dimer is from 800 mM to 2 M, 900 mM to1.5 M, 950 mM to<br>
1.2 M. In one specific embodiment, 1 M NaCI is used to disrupt the binding between<br>
the dye ligand and the dimer.<br>
[0222] The dye ligand may be a bio-mimetic. A bio-mimetic is a human-<br>
made substance, device, or system that imitates nature. Thus in some<br>
embodiments the dye ligand imitates a molecule's naturally occurring ligand. The<br>
7%<br><br>
dye ligand may be chosen from Mimetic Red 1™, Mimetic Kea  •«•, iviinmuu v-/.a..yv.<br>
1™, Mimetic Orange 2™, Mimetic Orange"3"™",' Mimetic Yellow-IVMimetic Yellow<br>
2™, Mimetic Green 1™, Mimetic Blue 1™, and Mimetic Blue 2™ (Prometic<br>
Biosciences (USA) Inc., Wayne, NJ). In one specific embodiment, the dye ligand is<br>
Mimetic Red 2™ (Prometic Biosciences (USA) Inc., Wayne, NJ). In certain<br>
embodiments the dye ligand is linked to a solid support, e.g., from Mimetic Red<br>
1A6XL™, Mimetic Red 2 A6XL™, Mimetic Orange 1 A6XL™, Mimetic Orange 2<br>
A6XL™, Mimetic Orange 3 A6XL™, Mimetic Yellow 1 A6XL™, Mimetic Yellow 2<br>
A6XL™, Mimetic Green 1 A6XL™, Mimetic Blue 1 A6XL™, and Mimetic Blue 2<br>
A6XL™ (Prometic Biosciences (USA) Inc., Wayne, NJ).<br>
[0223] The dye ligand may be linked to a solid support. The solid support<br>
may be any solid support known in the art (see, e.g., www.seperationsNOW.com).<br>
Examples of solid supports may include a bead, a gel, a membrane, a nanoparticle,<br>
or a microsphere. The solid support may comprise any material which can be linked<br>
to a dye ligand (e.g. agarose, polystyrene, sepharose, sephadex). Solid supports<br>
may comprise any synthetic organic polymer such as polyacrylic, vinyl polymers,<br>
acrylate, polymethacrylate, and polyacrylamide. Solid supports may also comprise a<br>
carbohydrate polymer, e.g., agarose, cellulose, or dextran. Solid supports may<br>
comprise inorganic oxides, such as silica, zirconia, titania, ceria, alumina, magnesia<br>
(i.e., magnesium oxide), or calcium oxide. Solid supports may also comprise<br>
combinations of some of the above-mentioned supports including, but not limited to,<br>
dextran-acrylamide.<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1: Molecular Weight Affects FcRn Mediated Trancytosis<br>
[0224] Chimeric proteins comprised of various proteins of interest and IgG<br>
Fc were recombinantly produced (Sambrook et al. Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory<br>
Manual, 2 ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, (1989)) or in the case of<br>
contactin-Fc, MAB-f3-gal, (a complex of a monoclonal antibody bound to 0-gal)<br>
(Biodesign International, Saco, ME) and MAB-GH (a complex of monoclonal<br>
antibody and growth hormone)(Research Diagnostics, Inc. Flanders, NJ) were<br>
purchased commercially. Briefly, the genes encoding the protein of interest were .<br>
cloned by PCR, and then sub-cloned into an Fc fusion expression plasmid. The<br>
plasmids were transfected into DG44 CHO cells and stable transfectants were<br>
selected and amplified with methotrexate. The chimeric protein homodimers were<br>
purified over a protein A column. The proteins tested included interferon a, growth<br>
hormone, erythropoietin, follicle stimulating hormone, Factor IX, beta-galactosidase,<br>
contactin, and Factor VIII. Linking the proteins to immunoglobulin portions, including<br>
the FcRn receptor binding partner, or using commercially available whole antibody<br>
(including the FcRn binding region)-antigen complexes permitted the investigation of<br>
transcytosis as a function of molecular weight (see U.S. Patent No. 6,030,613). The<br>
chimeric proteins were administered to rats orally and serum levels were measured<br>
2-4 hours post administration using an ELISA for recombinantly produced chimeric<br>
proteins and both a western blot and ELISA for commercially obtained antibody<br>
complexes and chimeric proteins. Additionally, all of the commercially obtained<br>
proteins or complexes as well as Factor Vlll-Fc, Factor )X-Fc and Epo-Fc controls<br>
were iodinated using IODO beads (Pierce, Pittsburgh, PA). The results indicated<br>
&amp;o<br><br>
serum levels of Fc and monoclonal antibody chimeric proteins orally administered to<br>
rats are directly related to the size of the proteinTTheapparentcutoff point for orally<br>
administered Fc chimeric proteins is between 200-285 kD. (Table 2).<br>

Example 2: Cloning of pcDNA 3.1 -Flag-Fc<br>
[0225] The sequence for the FLAG peptide (Asp-Tyr-Lys-Asp-Asp-Asp-Asp-<br>
Lys), a common affinity tag used to identify or purify proteins, was cloned into the<br>
pcDNA 3.1-Fc plasmid, which contains the mouse IgK signal sequence followed by<br>
the Fc fragment of human lgG1 (amino acids 221-447, EU numbering). The<br>
construct was created by overlapping PCR using the following primers:<br>
FlagFc-F1: 5'-GCTGGCTAGCCACCATGGA -3'(SEQ ID NO:41)<br>
FlagFc-R1: 5'- CTTGTCATCGTCGTCCTTGTAGTCGTCA<br>

FlagFc-R2: 5'- TAGTGGATCCTCATTTACCCG -3' (SEQ ID NO:44)<br>
[0226] The pcDNA 3.1-Fc template was then added to two separate PCR<br>
reactions containing 50 pmol each of the primer pairs FlagFc-F1/R1 or FlagFc-F2/R2<br>
in a 50 pi reaction using Pfu Ultra DNA polymerase (Stratagene, CA) according to<br>
B&gt;{<br><br>
manufacturer's standard protocol in a MJ Thermocycler using the following cycles:<br>
95°C 2 minutes; 30 cycles of (95°C 30 seconds, 52°C 30 seconds, 72°C 45<br>
seconds), followed by 72°C for 10 minutes. The products of these two reactions<br>
were then mixed in another PCR reaction (2 pi each) with 50 pmol of FlagFc-F1 and<br>
FlagFc-R2 primers in a 50 pi reaction using Pfu Ultra DNA polymerase (Stratagene,<br>
CA) according to manufacturer's standard protocol in a MJ Thermocycler using the<br>
following cycles: 95°C 2 minutes; 30 cycles of (95°C 30 seconds, 52°C 30 seconds,<br>
72°C 45 seconds), followed by 72°C for 10 minutes. The resulting fragment was gel<br>
purified, digested and inserted into the pcDNA 3.1-Fc plasmid Nhel-Bam HI. The<br>
resulting plasmid contains contains the mouse IgK signal sequence producing the<br>
FlagFc protein.<br>
Example 3: Cloning of -Factor VM-Fc construct<br>
[0227] The coding sequence for Factor VII, was obtained by RT-PCR from<br>
human fetal liver RNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA). The cloned region is comprised of<br>
the cDNA sequence from bp 36 to bp 1430 terminating just before the stop codon. A<br>
Sbfl site was introduced on the N-terminus. A BspEI site was introduced on the C-<br>
terminus. The construct was cloned by PCR using the primers:<br>
Downstream: 5' GCTACCTGCAGGCCACCATGGTCTCCCAGGCCCTCAGG<br>

Upstream : 5* CAGTTCCGGAGCTGGGCACGGCGGGCACGTGTGAGTTT<br>
TGTCGGGAAAT GG 3' (SEQ ID NO:46)<br>
and the following conditions: 95°C for 5 minutes followed by 30 cycles of 95°C for 30<br>
seconds, 55°C for 30 seconds, 72°C for 1 minute and 45 seconds, and a final<br>
extension cycle of 72°C for 10 minutes.<br>
&amp;<br><br>
[0228] The fragment was digested Sbfl - BspE I and inserted into pED.dC-Fc<br>
a plasmid encoding for the Fc fragment of an lgG1.<br>
Example 4: Cloning of Factor IX-Fc construct<br>
[0229] The human Factor IX coding sequence, including the prepropeptide<br>
sequence, was obtained by RT-PCR amplification from adult human liver RNA using<br>
the following primers:<br>
natFIX-F: 5'-TTACTGCAGAAGGTTATGCAGCGCGTGAACATG- 3'(SEQ ID<br>
NO:47)<br>
F9-R: 5'-TTTTTCGAATTCAGTGAGCTTTG-| I I I I I CCTTAATCC- 3'(SEQ ID<br>
NO:48)<br>
[0230] 20 ng of adult human liver RNA (Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) and 25<br>
pmol each primer were added to a RT-PCR reaction using the Superscript.™ One-<br>
Step RT-PCR with PLATINUM® Taq system (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) according to<br>
manufacturers protocol. Reaction was carried out in a MJ Thermocycler using the<br>
following cycles: 50°C 30 minutes; 94°C 2 minutes; 35 cycles of (94°C 30 seconds,<br>
58°C 30 seconds, 72°C 1 minute), and a final 72°C 10 minutes. The fragment was<br>
gel purified using Qiagen Gel Extraction Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), and digested<br>
with Pstl-EcoRI, gel purified, and cloned into the corresponding digest of the<br>
pED.dC.XFc piasmid.<br>
Example 5: Cloning of PACE construct<br>
[0231] The coding sequence for human PACE (paired basic amino acid<br>
cleaving enzyme), an endoprotease, was obtained by RT-PCR. The following<br>
primers were used:<br>
PACE-F1: 5'-GGTAAGCTTGCCATGGAGCTGAGGCCCTGGTTGC -3'(SEQ ID<br>
NO:49)<br>
31<br><br>
PACE-R1: 5'- GTTTTCAATCTCTAGGACCCACTCGCC -3'(SEQ ID NO:50)<br>

PACE-R2: 5'- GGTGAATTCTCACTCAGGCAGGTGTGAGGGCAGC -3'(SEQ ID<br>
NO:52)<br>
[0232] The PACE-F1 primer adds a Hindlll site to the 5' end of the PACE<br>
sequence beginning with 3 nucleotides before the start codon, while the PACE-R2<br>
primer adds a stop codon after amino acid 715, which occurs at the end of the<br>
extracellular domain of PACE, as well as adding an EcoRI site to the 3' end of the<br>
stop codon. The PACE-R1 and -F2 primers anneal on the 3' and 5' sides of an<br>
internal BamHI site, respectively. Two RT-PCR reactions were then set up using 25<br>
pmol each of the primer pairs of PACE-F1/R1 or PACE-F2/R2 with 20 ng of adult<br>
human liver RNA (Clontech; Palo Alto, CA) in a 50 pi RT-PCR reaction using the<br>
Superscript.™ One-Step RT-PCR with PLATINUM® Taq system (Invitrogen,<br>
Carlsbad, CA) according to manufacturers protocol. The reaction was carried out in<br>
a MJ Thermocycler using the following cycles: 50°C 30 minutes; 94°C 2 minutes; 30<br>
cycles of (94°C 30 seconds, 58°C 30 seconds, 72°C 2 minutes), followed by 72°C 10<br>
minutes. These fragments were each ligated into the vector pGEM T-Easy<br>
(Promega, Madison, Wl) and sequenced fully. The F2-R2 fragment was then<br>
subcloned into pcDNA6 V5/His (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) using the BamHI/EcoRI<br>
sites, and then the F1-R1 fragment was cloned into this construct using the<br>
Hindlll/BamHI sites. The final plasmid, pcDNA6-PACE, produces a soluble form of<br>
PACE (amino acids 1-715), as the transmembrane region has been deleted. The<br>
sequence of PACE in pcDNA6-PACE is essentially as described in Harrison et al.<br>
1998, Seminars in Hematology 35:4.<br>

[0234] Genomic DNA was prepared from 373MG human astrocytoma cell<br>
line, according to standard methods (Sambrook et al. 1989, Molecular Cloning: A<br>
Laboratory Manual, 2d ed., Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press). Briefly,<br>
approximately 2 x 105 cells were pelleted by centrifugation, resuspended in 100 pi<br>
phosphate buffered saline pH 7.4, then mixed with an equal volume of lysis buffer<br>
(100 mM Tris pH 8.0/ 200 mM NaCI / 2% SDS / 5 mM EDTA). Proteinase K was<br>
added to a final concentration of 100 pg/ml, and the sample was digested at 37°C for<br>
4 hours with occasional gentle mixing. The sample was then extracted twice with<br>
phenolrchloroform, the DNA precipitated by adding sodium acetate pH 7.0 to<br>
100 mM and an equal volume of isopropanol, and pelleted by centrifugation for 10<br>
min at room temperature. The supernatant was removed and the pellet was washed<br>
once with cold 70% ethanol and allowed to air dry before resuspending in TE<br>
(10 mM Tris pH 8.0 /1 mM EDTA).<br>
[0235] 100 ng of this genomic DNA was then used in a 25 pi PCR reaction<br>

Example 11: Cloning of CysFc construct<br>
[0248] Using PCR and standard molecular biology techniques (Sambrook et<br>
al. 1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed., Cold Spring Harbor<br>
Laboratory Press), a mammalian expression construct was generated such that the<br>
coding sequence for the human IFNa signal peptide was directly abutted against the<br>
coding sequence of Fc beginning at the first cysteine residue (Cys 226, EU<br>
Numbering). Upon signal peptidase cleavage and secretion from mammalian cells,<br><br>
an Fc protein with an N-terminal cysteine residue was thus generated. Briefly, the<br>
primers<br>
IFNa-Sig-F (IFNa-Sig-F: 5'-GCTACTGCAGCCACCATGGCCTTGACCTT<br>
TGCTTTAC-3')(SEQ ID NO:71) and Cys-Fc-R<br>
(5'-CAGTTCCGGAGCTGGGCACGGCGGA<br>
GAGCCCACAGAGCAGCTTG-3') (SEQ ID NO:72) were used in a PCR reaction to<br>
create a fragment linking the IFNa signal sequence with the N terminus of Fc,<br>
beginning with Cys 226. 500 ng of pED.dC.native hlFNa Alinker was added to 25<br>
pmol of each primer in a PCR reaction with Expand High Fidelity System<br>
(Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to manufacturer's standard<br>
protocol. The reaction was carried out in a MJ Thermocycler using the following<br>
cycles: 94°C 2 minutes; 30 cycles of (94°C 30 seconds, 50°C 30 seconds, 72°C 45<br>
seconds), and finally 72°C 10 minutes. The expected sized band (-112 bp) was gel<br>
purified with a Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA), digested with the Pstl and<br>
BspEI restriction enzymes, gel purified, and subcloned into the corresponding sites<br>
pED.dC.native hlFNa Alinker to generate pED.dC.Cys-Fc (Figure 5).<br>
Example 12: Protein Expression and Preparation of Fc-MESNA<br>
[0249] The coding sequence for Fc (the constant region of human lgG1) was<br>

(SEQ ID NO:74)were used to amplify the Fc sequence from 500 ng of the plasmid<br>
pED.dC.Epo-Fc using Expand High Fidelity System (Boehringer Mannheim, Basel<br>
Switzerland) in a RapidCylcler thermocycler (Idaho Technology Salt Lake City,<br>
Utah), denaturing at 95°C for 2 minutes followed by 18 cycles of 95°C for 0 sec,<br>
55°C for 0 sec, and 72°C for 1 minute with a slope of 4, followed by 72°C extension<br>
for 10 minutes. The PCR product was subcloned into an intermediate cloning vector<br>
and sequenced fully, and then subcloned using the A/del and Sapl sites in the<br>
pTWINI vector following standard procedures. Sambrook, J., Fritsch, E.F. and<br>
Maniatis, T. 1989, Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd ed.; Cold Spring<br>
Harbor, New York: Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press. This plasmid was then<br>
transformed into BL21(DE3) pLysS cells using standard methods. Id. A 1 liter<br>
culture of cells was grown to an absorbance reading of 0.8 AU at 37°C, induced with<br>
1 mM isopropyl beta-D-1-thiogalactopyranoside, and grown overnight at 25°C. Cells<br>
were pelleted by centrifugation, lysed in 20 mM Tris 8.8/1% NP40/0.1 mM<br>
phenylmethanesulfonyl fluoride/1 pg/ml Benzonase (Novagen Madison, Wl), and<br>
bound to chitin beads (New England Biolabs; Beverly, MA) overnight at 4°C. Beads<br>
were then washed with several column volumes of 20 mM Tris 8.5/ 500 mM NaCI/1<br>
mM EDTA, and then stored at -80°C. Purified Fc-MESNA was generated by eluting<br>
the protein from the beads in 20 mM Tris 8.5/ 500 mM NaCI /1 mM EDTA / 500 mM<br>
2-mercapto ethane sulfonic acid (MESNA), and the eluate was used directly in the<br>
coupling reaction, below.<br>
Example 13: Factor Vll-Fc monomer-dimer hybrid expression and purification<br>
[0250] CHO DG-44 cells expressing Factor Vll-Fc were established. CHO<br>
DG-44 cells were grown at 37°C, 5% C02, in MEM Alpha plus nucleoside and<br>
?*&gt;<br><br>
ribonucleosides and supplemented with 5% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum until<br>
transfection.<br>
[0251] DG44 cells were plated in 100 mm tissue culture petri dishes and<br>
grown to a confluency of 50%- 60%. A total of 10 ug of DNA was used to transfect<br>
one 100 mm dish: 7.5 ug of pED.dC.FVII-Fc + 1.5 ug pcDNA3/Flag-Fc + 1 ug of<br>
pcDNA6-PACE. The cells were transfected as described in the Superfect<br>
transfection reagent manual (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The media was removed from<br>
transfection after 48 hours and replaced with MEM Alpha without nucleosides plus<br>
5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 10 ug/ml of Blasticidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad,<br>
CA) and 0.2 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After 10 days, the cells<br>
were released from the plate with 0.25% trypsin and transferred into T25 tissue<br>
culture flasks, and the selection was continued for 10-14 days until the cells began<br>
to grow well as stable cell lines were established. Protein expression was<br>
subsequently amplified by the addition 25 nM methotrexate.<br>
[0252] Approximately 2 x 107 cells were used to inoculate 300 ml of growth<br>
medium in a 1700 cm2 roller bottle (Corning, Corning, NY) supplemented with 5<br>
ug/ml of vitamin K3 (menadione sodium bisulfite) (Sigma, St Louis, MO). The roller<br>
bottles were incubated in a 5% CO2 at 37°C for 72 hours. Then the growth medium<br>
was exchanged with 300 ml serum-free production medium (DMEM/F12 with 5 ug/ml<br>
bovine insulin and 10 ug/ml Gentamicin) supplemented with 5 ug/L of vitamin K3.<br>
The production medium (conditioned medium) was collected every day for 10 days<br>
and stored at 4°C. Fresh production medium was added to the roller bottles after<br>
each collection and the bottles were returned to the incubator. Pooled media was<br>
first clarified using a Sartoclean glass fiber filter (3.0 urn + 0.2 urn) (Sartorious Corp.<br>
**<br><br>
Gottingen, Germany) followed by an Acropack 500 filter (0.8 urn + 0.2 urn) (Pall<br>
Corp., East Hills, NY). The clarified media was then concentrated approximately 20-<br>
fold using Pellicon Biomax tangential flow filtration cassettes (10 kDa MWCO)<br>
(Millipore Corp., Billerica, MA).<br>
[0253] Fc chimeras were then captured from the concentrated media by<br>
passage over a Protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow Column (AP Biotech, Piscataway,<br>
NJ). A 5 x 5 cm (100 ml) column was loaded with 
volume at a linear flow rate of 100 cm/hour to achieve a residence time of &gt; 3<br>
minutes. The column was then washed with &gt;5 column volumes of 1X DPBS to<br>
remove non-specifically bound proteins. The bound proteins were eluted with<br>
100 mM Glycine pH 3.0. Elution fractions containing the protein peak were then<br>
neutralized by adding 1 part 1 M Tris-HCL, pH 8 to 10 parts elute fraction.<br>
[0254] To remove FLAG-Fc homodimers (that is, chimeric Fc dimers with<br>
FLAG peptide expressed as fusions with both Fc molecules) from the preparation,<br>
the Protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow pool was passed over a Unosphere S cation-<br>
exchange column (BioRad Corp., Richmond, CA). Under the operating conditions<br>
for the column, the FLAG-Fc monomer-dimer hybrid is uncharged (FLAG-Fc<br>
theoretical pl=6.19) and flows through the column while the hFVII-Fc constructs are<br>
positively charged, and thus bind to the column and elute at higher ionic strength.<br>
The Protein A Sepharose 4 Fast Flow pool was first dialyzed into 20 mM MES,<br>
20 mM NaCI, pH 6.1. The dialyzed material was then loaded onto a 1.1 x 11 cm<br>
(9.9 ml) column at 150 cm/hour. During the wash and elution, the flow rate was<br>
increased to 500 cm/hour. The column was washed sequentially with 8 column<br>
volumes of 20 mM MES, 20 mM NaCI, pH 6.1 and 8 column volumes of 20 mM<br>
9<br><br>
MES, 40 mM NaCI, pH 6.1. The bound protein was eluted with 20 mM MES,<br>
750 mM NaCI, pH 6.1. Elution fractions containing the protein peak were pooled<br>
and sterile filtered through a 0.2 urn filter disc prior to storage at -80°C.<br>
[0255] An anti-FLAG MAB affinity column was used to separate chimeric Fc<br>
dimers with hFVII fused to both Fc molecules from those with one FLAG peptide and<br>
one hFVII fusion. The Unosphere S Eluate pool was diluted 1:1 with 20 mM Tris,<br>
50 mM NaCI, 5 mM CaCI2, pH 8 and loaded onto a 1.6 x 5 cm M2 anti-FLAG<br>
sepharose column (Sigma Corp., St. Louis, MO) at a linear flow rate of 60 cm/hour.<br>
Loading was targeted to 
loading the column was washed with 5 column volumes 20 mM Tris, 50 mM NaCI,<br>
5 mM CaCI2, pH 8.0, monomer-dimer hybrids were then eluted with 100 mM Glycine,<br>
pH 3.0. Elution fractions containing the protein peak were then neutralized by<br>
adding 1 part 1 M Tris-HCI, pH 8 to 10 parts eluate fraction. Pools were stored at<br>
-80°C.<br>
Example 14: Factor IX-Fc homodimer and monomer-dimer hybrid expression<br>
and purification<br>
[0256] CHO DG-44 cells expressing Factor IX-Fc were established. DG44<br>
cells were plated in 100 mm tissue culture petri dishes and grown to a confluency of<br>
50%- 60%. A total of 10 ug of DNA was used to transfect one 100 mm dish: for the<br>
homodimer transfection, 8 ug of pED.dC.Factor IX-Fc + 2 ug of pcDNA6-PACE was<br>
used; for the monomer-dimer hybrid transfection, 8 ug of pED.dC.Factor IX-Fc + 1<br>
ug of pcDNA3-FlagFc +1 ug pcDNA6-PACE was used. The cells were transfected<br>
as described in the Superfect transfection reagent manual (Qiagen, Valencia, CA).<br>
The media was removed from transfection after 48 hours and replaced with MEM<br><br>
Alpha without nucleosides plus 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum and 10 pg/ml of<br>
Blasticidin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) for both transfections, while the monomer-<br>
dimer hybrid transfection was also supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml geneticin<br>
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After 3 days, the cells were released from the plate with<br>
•0.25% trypsin and transferred into T25 tissue culture flasks, and the selection was<br>
continued for 10-14 days until the cells began to grow well as stable cell lines were<br>
established. Protein expression was subsequently amplified by the addition 10 nM<br>
or 100 nM methotrexate for the homodimer or monomer-dimer hybrid, respectively.<br>
[0257] For both cell lines, approximately 2 x 107 cells were used to inoculate<br>
300 ml of growth medium in a 1700 cm2 roller bottle (Corning, Corning, NY),<br>
supplemented with 5 ug/L of vitamin K3 (menadione sodium bisuWite) (Sigma, St.<br>
Louis, MO). The roller bottles were incubated in a 5% C02 at 37°C for<br>
approximately 72 hours. The growth medium was exchanged with 300 ml serum-<br>
free production medium (DMEM/F12 with 5 ng/ml bovine insulin and 10 ug/ml<br>
Gentamicin), supplemented with 5 pg/L of vitamin K3. The production medium<br>
(conditioned medium) was collected everyday for 10 days and stored at 4°C. Fresh<br>
production medium was added to the roller bottles after each collection and the<br>
bottles were returned to the incubator. Prior to chromatography, the medium was<br>
clarified using a SuporCap-100 (0.8/0.2 pm) filter (Pall Gelman Sciences, Ann Arbor,<br>
MI). All of the following steps were performed at 4°C. The clarified medium was<br>
applied to Protein A Sepharose, washed with 5 column volumes of 1X PBS (10 mM<br>
phosphate, pH 7.4, 2.7 mM KCI, and 137 mM NaCI), eluted with 0.1 M glycine, pH<br>
2.7 , and then neutralized with 1/10 volume of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. The protein<br>
was then dialyzed into PBS.<br>
77<br><br>
[0258] The monomer-dimer hybrid transfection protein sample was subject<br>
to further purification, as it contained a mixture of FIX-Fc:FIX-Fc homodimer, FIX-<br>
Fc:Flag-Fc monomer-dimer hybrid, and Flag-Fc:Flag-Fc homodimer. Material was<br>
concentrated and applied to a 2.6 cm x 60 cm (318 ml) Superdex 200 Prep Grade<br>
column at a flow rate of 4 ml/minute (36 cm/hour) and then eluted with 3 column<br>
volumes of 1X PBS. Fractions corresponding to two peaks on the UV detector were<br>
collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions from the first peak contained<br>
either FIX-Fc:FIX-Fc homodimer or FlX-Fc:FlagFc monomer-dimer hybrid, while the<br>
second peak contained FlagFc:FlagFc homodimer. All fractions containing the<br>
monomer-dimer hybrid but no FlagFc homodimer were pooled and applied directly to<br>
a 1.6 x 5 cm M2 anti-FLAG sepharose column (Sigma Corp., St. Louis, MO) at a<br>
linear flow rate of 60 cm/hour. After loading, the column was washed with 5 column<br>
volumes PBS. Monomer-dimer hybrids were then eluted with 100 mM Glycine,<br>
pH 3.0. Elution fractions containing the protein peak were then neutralized by<br>
adding 1/10 volume of 1 M Tris-HCI, and analyzed by reducing and nonreducing<br>
SDS-PAGE. Fractions were dialyzed into PBS, concentrated to 1-5 mg/ml, and<br>
stored at -80°C.<br>
Example 15: IFNa homodimer and monomer-dimer hybrid expression and<br>
purification<br>
[0259] CHO DG-44 cells expressing hlFNoc were established. DG44 cells<br>
were plated in 100 mm tissue culture petri dishes and grown to a confluency of 50%-<br>
60%. A total of 10 pg of DNA was used to transfect one 100 mm dish: for the<br>
homodimer transfection, 10 pg of the hlFNaFc constructs; for the monomer-dimer<br>
hybrid transfection, 8 pg of the hlFNaFc constructs + 2 pg of pcDNA3-FlagFc. The<br>
93<br><br>
cells were transfected as described in the Superfect transfection reagent manual<br>
(Qiagen, Valencia, CA). The media was removed from transfection after 48 hours<br>
and replaced with MEM Alpha without nucleosides plus 5% diaiyzed fetal bovine<br>
serum, while the monomer-dimer hybrid transfection was also supplemented with<br>
0.2 mg/ml geneticin (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After 3 days, the cells were released<br>
from the plate with 0.25% trypsin and transferred into T25 tissue culture flasks, and<br>
the selection was continued for 10-14 days until the cells began to grow well and<br>
stable cell lines were established. Protein expression was subsequently amplified<br>
by the addition methotrexate: ranging from 10 to 50 nM.<br>
[0260] For all cell lines, approximately 2 x 107 cells were used to inoculate<br>
300 ml of growth medium in a 1700 cm2 roller bottle (Corning, Corning, NY). The<br>
roller bottles were incubated in a 5% CO2 at 37°C for approximately 72 hours. Then<br>
the growth medium was exchanged with 300 ml serum-free production medium<br>

[0261] The monomer-dimer hybrid transfection protein samples were then<br>
subject to further purification, as it contained a mixture of IFNaFc:IFNaFc<br>
homodimer, IFNaFc:FlagFc monomer-dimer hybrid, and FlagFc:FlagFc homodimer<br>
(or Alinker or GS15 linker). Material was concentrated and applied to a 2.6 cm x 60<br>

Superfect reagent (Qiagen; Valencia, CA) according to manufacturer's protocol,<br>
followed by selection for stable transfectants in. aMEM (without nucleosides) tissue<br>
culture media supplemented with 5% dialyzed FBS and penicillin/streptomycin<br>
antibiotics (Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) for 10 days. The resulting pool of stably<br>
transfected cells were then amplified with 50 nM methotrexate to increase<br>
expression. Approximately 2 x 107 cells were used to inoculate 300 ml of growth<br>
medium in a 1700 cm2 roller bottle (Corning, Corning, NY). The roller bottles were<br>
incubated in a 5% C02 at 37°C for approximately 72 hours. The growth medium<br>
was exchanged with 300 ml serum-free production medium (DMEM/F12 with 5 pg/ml<br>
bovine insulin and 10 pg/ml Gentamicin). The production medium (conditioned<br>
medium) was collected every day for 10 days and stored at 4°C. Fresh production<br>
medium was added to the roller bottles after each collection and the bottles were<br>
returned to the incubator. Prior to chromatography, the medium was clarified using<br>
a SuporCap-100 (0.8/0.2 urn) filter from Pall Gelman Sciences (Ann Arbor, Ml). All<br>
of the following steps were performed at 4°C. The clarified medium was applied to<br>
Protein A Sepharose, washed with 5 column volumes of 1X PBS (10 mM phosphate,<br>
pH 7.4, 2.7 mM KCI, and 137 mM NaCI), eluted with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.7, and then<br><br>
neutralized with 1/10 volume of 1 M Tris-HCl, pH 9.0. Protein was dialyzed into PBS<br>
and used directly in conjugation reactions.<br>
Example 18: Coupling of T20-thioesters to Cvs-Fc<br>
[0264] Cys-Fc (4 mg, 3.2 mg/ml final concentration) and either T20-thioester<br>
or T20-PEG-thioester (2 mg, approximately 5 molar equivalents) were incubated for<br>
16 hours at room temperature in 0.1 M Tris 8/10 mM MESNA. Analysis by SDS-<br>
PAGE (Tris-Gly gel) using reducing sample buffer indicated the presence of a new<br>
band approximately 5 kDa larger than the Fc control (&gt;40-50% conversion to the<br>
conjugate). Previous N-terminal sequencing of Cys-Fc and unreacted Cys-Fc<br>
indicated that the signal peptide is incorrectly processed in a fraction of the<br>
molecules, leaving a mixture of (Cys)-Fc, which will react through native ligation with<br>
peptide-thioesters, and (Val)-(Gly)-(Cys)-Fc, which will not. As the reaction<br>
conditions are insufficient to disrupt the dimerization of the Cys-Fc molecules, this<br>
reaction generated a mixture of T20-Cys-Fc:T20-Cys-Fc homodimers, T20-Cys-Fc:<br>
Fc monomer-dimer hybrids, and Cys-Fc:Cys-Fc Fc-dimers. This protein was purified<br>
using size exclusion chromatography as indicated above to separate the three<br>
species. The result was confirmed by SDS-PAGE analysis under nonreducing<br>
conditions.<br>
Example 19: Antiviral assay for IFNa activity<br>
[0265] Antiviral activity (lU/ml) of IFNa fusion proteins was determined using<br>
a CPE (cytopathic effect) assay. A549 cells were plated in a 96 well tissue culture<br>
plate in growth media (RPM11640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)<br>
and 2 mM L-glutamine) for 2 hours at 37°C, 5% C02. IFNa standards and IFNa<br>
fusion proteins were diluted in growth media and added to cells in triplicate for 20<br><br>
hours at 37°C, 5% CO2. Following incubation, all media was removed from wells,<br>
encephalomyocarditis virus (EMC) virus was diluted in growth media and added<br>
(3000 pfu/well) to each well with the exception of control wells. Plates were<br>
incubated at 37°C, 5% C02for 28 hours. Living cells were fixed with 10% cold<br>
trichloroacetic acid (TCA) and then stained with Sulforhodamine B (SRB) according<br>
to published protocols (Rubinstein et al. 1990, J. Natl. Cancer Inst. 82, 1113). The<br>
SRB dye was solubilized with 10 mM Tris pH 10.5 and read on a spectrophotometer<br>
at 490 nm. Samples were analyzed by comparing activities to a known standard<br>
curve World Health Organization IFNcc 2b International Standard ranging from 5 to<br>
0.011 lU/ml. The results are presented below in Table 3 and Figure 6 and<br>
demonstrate increased antiviral activity of monomer-dimer hybrids.<br>

Example 20: FVIIa Clotting Activity Analysis<br>
[0266] The StaClot FVIIa-rTF assay kit was purchased from Diagnostica<br>
Stago (Parsippany, NJ) and modified as described in Johannessen et al. 2000,<br>
/02.<br><br>
Blood Coagulation and Fibrinolysis 11:S159. A standard curve was preformed with<br>
the FVIIa World Health Organization standard 89/688. The assay was used to<br>
compare clotting activity of monomer-dimer hybrids compared to homodimers. The<br>
results showed the monomer-dimer hybrid had four times the clotting activity<br>
compared to the homodimer (Figure 7).<br>
Example 21:FVIIa-Fc Oral dosing in day 10 rats<br>
[0267] 25 gram day 9 newborn Sprague Dawley rats were purchased from<br>
Charles River (Wilmington, MA) and allowed to acclimate for 24 hours. The rats<br>
were dosed orally with FVllaFc homodimer, monomer-dimer hybrid or a 50:50 mix of<br>
the two. A volume of 200 pi of a FVllaFc solution for a dose of 1 mg/kg was<br>
administered. The solution was composed of a Tris-HCI buffer pH 7.4 with 5 mg/ml<br>
soybean trypsin inhibitor. The rats were euthanized with CO2 at several time points,<br>
and 200 pi of blood was drawn by cardiac puncture. Plasma was obtained by the<br>
addition of a 3.8% sodium citrate solution and centrifugation at room temperature at<br>
a speed of 1268xg. The plasma samples were either assayed fresh or frozen at<br>
20°C. Orally dosed monomer-dimer hybrid resulted in significantly higher maximum<br>
(Cmax) serum concentrations compared to homodimeric Factor VII (Figure 8).<br>
Example 22: Factor IX-Fc Oral dosing of neonatal rats<br>
[0268] Ten-day old neonatal Sprague-Dawley rats were dosed p.o. with<br>
200 pi of FIX-Fc homodimer or FIX-Fc: FlagFc monomer-dimer hybrid at<br>
approximately equimolar doses of 10 nmol/kg in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer, pH<br>
6.5 containing 5 mg/ml soybean trypsin inhibitor and 0.9% NaCI. At 1, 2,4, 8, 24,<br>
48, and 72 hours post injection, animals were euthanized with C02, blood was<br>
drawn via cardiac puncture and plasma was obtained by the addition of a 3.8%<br><br>
sodium citrate solution and centrifugation at room temperature at a speed of 1268xg.<br>
Samples were then sedimented by centrifugation, serum collected and frozen at<br>
-20°C until analysis of the fusion proteins by ELISA.<br>
Example 23: Factor IX-Fc EL1SA<br>
[0269] A 96-well Immulon 4HBX ELISA plate (Thermo LabSystems, Vantaa,<br>
Finland) was coated with 100 ul/well of goat anti-Factor IX IgG (Affinity Biologicals,<br>
Ancaster, Canada) diluted 1:100 in 50 mM carbonate buffer, pH 9.6. The plates<br>
were incubated at ambient temperature for 2 hours or overnight at 4°C sealed with<br>
plastic film. The wells were washed 4 times with PBST, 300 pl/well using the<br>
TECAN plate washer. The wells were blocked with PBST + 6% BSA, 200 ul/well,<br>
and incubated 90 minutes at ambient temperature. The wells were washed 4 times<br>
with PBST, 300 ul/well using the TECAN plate washer. Standards and blood<br>
samples from rats described in Example 18 were added to the wells, (100 pl/well),<br>
and incubated 90 minutes at ambient temperature. Samples and standards were<br>
diluted in HBET buffer (HBET: 5.95 g HEPES, 1.46 g NaCI, 0.93 g Na2EDTA, 2.5 g<br>
Bovine Serum Albumin, 0.25 ml Tween-20, bring up to 250 ml with dH20, adjust pH<br>
to 7.2). Standard curve range was from 200 ng/ml to 0.78 ng/ml with 2 fold dilutions<br>
in between. Wells were washed 4 times with PBST, 300 ul/well using the TECAN<br>
plate washer. 100 pl/well of conjugated goat anti-human IgG-Fc-HARP antibody<br>
(Pierce, Rockford, IL) diluted in HBET 1:25,000 was added to each well. The plates<br>
were incubated 90 minutes at ambient temperature. The wells were washed 4 times<br>
with PBST, 300 pl/well using the TECAN plate washer. The plates were developed<br>
with 100 pl/well of tetramethylbenzidine peroxidase substrate (TMB) (Pierce,<br>
Rockford, IL) was added according to the manufacturer's instructions. The plates<br><br>
were incubated 5 minutes at ambient temperature in the dark or until color<br>
developed. The reaction was stopped with 100 ul/well of 2 M sulfuric acid.<br>
Absorbance was read at 450 nm on SpectraMax plusplate reader (Molecular<br>
Devices, Sunnyvale, CA). Analysis of blood drawn at 4 hours indicated more than a<br>
10 fold difference in serum concentration between Factor IX-Fc monomer-dimer<br>
hybrids compared to Factor IX Fc homodimers (Figure 9). The results indicated<br>
Factor IX-Fc monomer-dimer hybrid levels were consistently higher than Factor IX-<br>
Fc homodimers (Figure 10).<br>
Example 24: Cloning of Epo-Fc<br>
[0270] The mature Epo coding region was obtained by PCR amplification<br>
from a plasmid encoding the mature erythropoietin coding sequence, originally<br>
obtained by RT-PCR from Hep G2 mRNA, and primers hepoxba-F and hepoeco-R,<br>
indicated below. Primer hepoxba-F contains an Xbal site, while primer hepoeco-R<br>
contains an EcoRI site. PCR was carried out in the Idaho Technology RapidCycler<br>
using Vent polymerase, denaturing at 95°C for 15 seconds, followed by 28 cycles<br>
with a slope of 6.0 of 95°C for 0 seconds, 55°C for 0 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute<br>
20 seconds, followed by 3 minute extension at 72°C. An approximately 514 bp<br>
product was gel purified, digested with Xbal and EcoRI, gel purified again and<br>
directionally subcloned into an Xoal/EcoRI-digested, gel purified pED.dC.XFc vector,<br>
mentioned above. This construct was named pED.dC.EpoFc.<br>
[0271] The Epo sequence, containing both the endogenous signal peptide<br>
and the mature sequence, was obtained by PCR amplification using an adult kidney<br>
QUICK-clone cDNA preparation as the template and primers Epo+Pep-Sbf-F and<br>
Epo+Pep-Sbf-R, described below. The primer Epo+Pep-Sbf-F contains an Sbf\ site<br>
le&gt;4<br><br>
upstream of the start codon, while the primer Epo+Pep-Sbf-R anneals downstream<br>
of the endogenous Sbfl site in the Epo sequence. The PCR reaction was carried out<br>
in the PTC-200 MJ Thermocycler using Expand polymerase, denaturing at 94°C for<br>
2 minutes, followed by 32 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 57°C for 30 seconds, and<br>
72°C for 45 seconds, followed by a 10 minute extension at 72°C. An approximately<br>
603 bp product was gel isolated and subcloned into the pGEM-T Easy vector. The<br>
correct coding sequence was excised by Sbf\ digestion, gel purified, and cloned into<br>
the Psfl-digested, shrimp alkaline phosphatase (SAP)-treated, gel purified<br>
pED.dC.EpoFc plasmid. The plasmid with the insert in the correct orientation was<br>
initially determined by Kpn\ digestion. AXmn\ and PvuU digestion of this construct<br>
was compared with pED.dC.EpoFc and confirmed to be in the correct orientation.<br>
The sequence was determined and the construct was named pED.dC.natEpoFc.<br>

[0272] An alternative method of cloning EPO-Fc is described herein.<br>

[0273] The forward primer incorporates an Sbfl and Hindlll site upstream of<br>
a Kozak sequence, while the reverse primer removes the internal Sbfl site, and adds<br>
an 8 amino acid linker to the 3' end of the coding sequence (EFAGAAAV) (SEQ ID<br>
NO:81) as well as Sail and EcoRI restriction sites. The Epo coding sequence was<br>
then amplified from a kidney cDNA library (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA)<br>
using 25 pmol of these primers in a 25 pi PCR reaction using Expand High Fidelity<br>
System (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to manufacturer's<br>
standard protocol in a MJ Thermocycler using the following cycles: 94°C 2 minutes;<br>
30 cycles of (94°C 30 seconds, 58°C 30 seconds, 72°C 45 seconds), followed by<br>
72°C for 10 minutes. The expected sized band (641 bp) was gel purified with a Gel<br>
Extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and ligated into the intermediate cloning vector<br>
pGEM T-Easy (Promega, Madison, Wl). DNA was transformed into DH5a cells<br>
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and miniprep cultures grown and purified with a Plasmid<br>
Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) both according to manufacturer's standard<br>
protocols. Once the sequence was confirmed, this insert was digested out with<br>
Sbfl/EcoRI restriction enzymes, gel purified, and cloned into the Pstl/EcoRI sites of<br>
the mammalian expression vector pED.dC in a similar manner.<br>
[0274] Primers were designed to amplify the coding sequence for the<br>
constant region of human lgG1 (the Fc region, EU numbering 221-447) as follows:<br>

fv2&gt;<br><br>
The forward primer incorporates a Sail site at the linker-Fc junction, as well as<br>
introducing BspEI and Rsrll sites into the Fc region without affecting the coding<br>
sequence, while the reverse primer adds an EcoRI site after the stop codon. The Fc<br>
coding sequence was then amplified from a leukocyte cDNA library (BD Biosciences<br>
Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) using 25 pmol of these primers in a 25 pi PCR reaction<br>
using Expand High Fidelity System (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN)<br>
according to manufacturer's standard protocol in a MJ Thermocycler using the<br>
following cycles: 94°C 2 minutes; 30 cycles of (94°C 30 seconds, 58°C 30 seconds,<br>
72°C 45 seconds), followed by 72°C for 10 minutes. The expected sized band (696<br>
bp) was gel purified with a Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) and ligated into<br>
the intermediate cloning vector pGEM T-Easy (Promega, Madison, Wl). DNA was<br>
transformed into DH5a cells (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) and miniprep cultures grown<br>
and purified with a Plasmid Miniprep Kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA), both according to<br>
manufacturer's standard protocols. Once the sequence was confirmed, this insert<br>
was digested out with Sal/EcoRI restriction enzymes, gel purified, and cloned into<br>
the Sall/EcoRI sites of the plasmid pED.dC.Epo (above) in a similar manner, to<br>
generate the mammalian expression plasmid pED.dC.EpoFc. In another experiment<br>
this plasmid was also digested with Rsrll/Xmal, and the corresponding fragment<br>
from pSYN-Fc-002, which contains the Asn 297 Ala mutation (EU numbering) was<br>
cloned in to create pED.dC.EPO-Fc N297A (pSYN-EPO-004). Expression in<br>
mammalian cells was as described in Example 26. The amino acid sequence of<br>
EpoFc with an eight amino acid linker is provided in figure 2j. During the process of<br>
this alternative cloning method, although the exact EpoFc amino acid sequence was<br>
preserved (figure 2J), a number of non-coding changes were made at the nucleotide<br><br>
level (figure 3J). These are G6A (G at nucleotide 6 changed to A) (eliminate<br>
possible secondary structure in primer), G567A (removes endogenous Sbfl site from<br>
Epo), A582G (removes EcoRI site from linker), A636T and T639G (adds unique<br>
BspEI site to Fc), and G651C (adds unique Rsrll site to Fc). The nucleotide<br>
sequence in figure 3J is from the construct made in Example 25, which incorporates<br>
these differences from the sequence of the construct from Example 24.<br>
Example 26: EPO-Fc Homodimer And Monomer-dimer Hybrid Expression And<br>
Purification<br>
[0275] DG44 cells were plated in 100 mm tissue culture petri dishes and<br>
grown to a confluency of 50%-60%. A total of 10 ug of DNA was used to transfect<br>
one 100 mm dish: for the homodimer transfection,10 ug of pED.dC.EPO-Fc; for the<br>
monomer-dimer hybrid transfection, 8 ug of pED.dC.EPO-Fc + 2 pg of pcDNA3-<br>
FlagFc. The constructs used were cloned as described in Example 24. The cloning<br>
method described in Example 25 could also be used to obtain constructs for use in<br>
this example. The cells were transfected as described in the Superfect transfection<br>
reagent manual (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Alternatively, pED.dC.EPO-Fc was<br>
cotransfected with pSYN-Fc-016 to make an untagged monomer. The media was<br>
removed from transfection after 48 hours and replaced with MEM Alpha without<br>
nucleosides plus 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum for both transfections, while the<br>
monomer-dimer hybrid transfection was also supplemented with 0.2 mg/ml geneticin<br>
(lnvitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). After 3 days, the cells were released from the plate with<br>
0.25% trypsin and transferred into T25 tissue culture flasks, and the selection was<br>
continued for 10-14 days until the cells began to grow well as stable cell lines were<br>
// b&gt;<br><br>
established. Protein expression was subsequently amplified by the addition<br>
methotrexate.<br>
[0276] For both cell lines, approximately 2 x 107 cells were used to inoculate<br>
300 ml of growth medium in a 1700 cm2 roller bottle (Corning, Corning, NY). The<br>
roller bottles were incubated in a 5% C02 at 37°C for approximately 72 hours. The<br>
growth medium was exchanged with 300 ml serum-free production medium<br>
(DMEM/F12 with 5 ug/ml bovine insulin and 10 ug/ml Gentamicin). The production<br>
medium (conditioned medium) was collected every day for 10 days and stored at<br>
4°C. Fresh production medium was added to the roller bottles after each collection<br>
and the bottles were returned to the incubator. Prior to chromatography, the<br>
medium was clarified using a SuporCap-100 (0.8/0.2 urn) filter from Pall Gelman<br>
Sciences (Ann Arbor, Ml). All of the following steps were performed at 4°C. The<br>
clarified medium was applied to Protein A Sepharose, washed with 5 column<br>
volumes of 1X PBS (10 mM phosphate, pH 7.4, 2.7 mM KCI, and 137 mM NaCI),<br>
eluted with 0.1 M glycine, pH 2.7, and then neutralized with 1/10 volume of 1 M Tris-<br>
HCI, pH 9.0. Protein was then dialyzed into PBS.<br>
[0277] The monomer-dimer hybrid transfection protein sample was subject<br>
to further purification, as it contained a mixture of EPO-Fc:EPO-Fc homodimer,<br>
EPO-Fc:Flag-Fc monomer-dimer hybrid, and Flag-Fc:Flag-Fc homodimer. Material<br>
was concentrated and applied to a 2.6 cm x 60 cm (318 ml) Superdex 200 Prep<br>
Grade column at a flow rate of 4 ml/min (36 cm/hour) and then eluted with 3 column<br>
volumes of 1X PBS. Fractions corresponding to two peaks on the UV detector were<br>
collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions from the first peak contained<br>
either EPO-Fc:EPO-Fc homodimer or EPO-Fc:FlagFc monomer-dimer hybrid, while<br><br>
the second peak contained FlagFc:FlagFc homodimer. All fractions containing the<br>
monomer-dimer hybrid but no FlagFc homodimer were pooled and applied directly to<br>
a 1.6 x 5 cm M2 anti-FLAG sepharose column (Sigma Corp.) at a linear flow rate of<br>
60 cm/hour. After loading the column was washed with 5 column volumes PBS.<br>
Monomer-dimer hybrids were then eluted with 100 mM Glycine, pH 3.0. Elution<br>
fractions containing the protein peak were then neutralized by adding 1/10 volume of<br>
1 M Tris-HCI, and analyzed by reducing and nonreducing SDS-PAGE. Fractions<br>
were dialyzed into PBS, concentrated to 1-5 mg/ml, and stored at-80°C.<br>
[0278] Alternatively, fractions from first peak of the Superdex 200 were<br>
analyzed by SDS-PAGE, and only fractions containing a majority of EpoFc<br>
monomer-dimer hybrid, with a minority of EpoFc homodimer, were pooled. This<br>
pool, enriched for the monomer-dimer hybrid, was then reapplied to a Superdex 200<br>
column, and fractions containing only EpoFc monomer-dimer hybrid were then<br>
pooled, dialyzed and stored as purified protein. Note that this alternate purification<br>
method could be used to purify non-tagged monomer-dimer hybrids as well:<br>
Example 27: Administration of EpoFc Dimer and Monomer-Dimer Hybrid With<br>
an Eight Amino Acid Linker to Cynomolgus Monkeys<br>
[0279] For pulmonary administration, aerosols of either EpoFc dimer or<br>
EpoFc monomer-dimer hybrid proteins (both with the 8 amino acid linker) in PBS, pH<br>
7.4 were created with the Aeroneb Pro™ (AeroGen, Mountain View, CA) nebulizer,<br>
in-line with a Bird Mark 7A respirator, and administered to anesthetized naTve<br>
cynomolgus monkeys through endotracheal tubes (approximating normal tidal<br>
breathing). Both proteins were also administered to naTve cynomolgus monkeys by<br>
intravenous injection. Samples were taken at various time points, and the amount of<br><br>
Epo-containing protein in the resulting plasma was quantitated using the Quantikine<br>
IVD Human Epo Immunoassay (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Pharmacokinetic<br>
parameters were calculated using the software WinNonLin. Table 4 presents the<br>
bioavailability results of cynomolgus monkeys treated with EpoFc monomer-dimer<br>
hybrid or EpoFc dimer.<br>

[0281] The pharmacokinetics of EpoFc with an 8 amino acid linker<br>
administered to cynomolgus monkeys is presented in figure 11. The figure<br>
compares the EpoFc dimer with the EpoFc monomer-dimer hybrid in monkeys after<br>
administration of a single pulmonary dose. Based on a molar comparison<br>
significantly higher serum levels were obtained in monkeys treated with the<br>
monomer-dimer hybrid compared to the dimer.<br>
Example 28: Subcutaneous Administration of EPOFc Monomer-dimer Hybrid<br>
[0282] To compare serum concentrations of known erythropoietin agents<br>
with EPOFc monomer-dimer hybrids, both EPOFc monomer-dimer hybrid and<br>
Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa), which is not a chimeric fusion protein, were<br>
administered subcutaneously to different monkeys and the serum concentration of<br>
both was measured over time.<br>
[0283] Cynomolgus monkeys (n = 3 per group) were injected<br>
subcutaneously with 0.025 mg/kg EpoFc monomer-dimer hybrid. Blood samples<br>

were collected predose and at times up to 144 hours post dose. Serum was<br>
prepared from the blood and stored frozen until analysis by ELISA (Human Epo<br>
Quantikine Immunoassay) (R&amp;D Systems, Minneapolis, MN). Pharmacokinetic<br>
parameters were determined using WinNonLina® software (Pharsight,<br>
Mountainview, CA).<br>
[0284] The results indicated the serum concentrations of both EPOFc<br>
monomer-dimer hybrid and Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) were equivalent over time,<br>
even though the administered molar dose of Aranesp® (darbepoetin alfa) was<br>
slightly larger (Table 6) (figure 12).<br>

Example 30: Alternative Purification of EpoFc Monomer-dimer Hybrid<br>
[0288] Yet another alternative for purifying EPO-Fc is described herein. A<br>
mixture containing Fc, EpoFc monomer-dimer hybrid, and EpoFc dimer was applied<br>
to a Protein A Sepharose column (Amersham, Uppsala, Sweden). The mixture was<br>
eluted according to the manufacturer's instructions. The Protein A Sepharose<br>
eluate, containing the mixture was buffer exchanged into 50 mM Tris-CI (pH 8.0).<br>
The protein mixture was loaded onto an 8 ml_ Mimetic Red 2 XL column (ProMetic<br>
Life Sciences, Inc., Wayne, NJ) that had been equilibrated in 50 mM Tris-CI (pH<br>
8.0). The column was then washed with 50 mM Tris-CI (pH 8.0); 50 mM NaCI. This<br>
)fb<br><br>
step removed the majority of the Fc. EpoFc monomer-dimer hybrid was specifically<br>
eluted from the column with 50 mM Tris-CI (pH 8.0); 400 mM NaCI. EpoFc dimer<br>
can be eluted and the column regenerated with 5 column volumes of 1 M NaOH.<br>
Eluted fractions from the column were anafyzed by SDS-PAGE (Figure 14).<br>
Example 31: Cloning of IgK signal sequence - Fc construct for making<br>
untagged Fc alone.<br>
[0289] The coding sequence for the constant region of lgG1 (EU # 221-447;<br>
the Fc region) was obtained by PCR amplification from a leukocyte cDNA library<br>
(Clontech, CA) using the following primers:<br>
rcFc-F 5'- GCTGCGGTCGACAAAACTCACACATGCCCACCGTGCCCAGCTCC<br>
GGAACTCCTGGGCGGACCGTCAGTC -3' (SEQ ID NO: 84)<br>
rcFc-R 5'- ATTGGAATTCTCATTTACCCGGAGACAGGGAGAGGC -3' (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 85)<br>
[0290] The forward primer adds three amino acids (AAV) and a Sail cloning<br>
site before the beginning of the Fc region, and also incorporates a BspEl restriction<br>
site at amino acids 231-233 and an Rsrll restriction site at amino acids 236-238<br>
using the degeneracy of the genetic code to preserve the correct amino acid<br>
sequence (EU numbering). The reverse primer adds an EcoRI cloning site after the<br>
stop codon of the Fc. A 25 pi PCR reaction was carried out with 25 pmol of each<br>
primer using Expand High Fidelity System (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN)<br>
according to the manufacturer's standard protocol in a MJ Thermocycler using the<br>
following cycles: 94°C 2 minutes; 30 cycles of (94°C 30 seconds, 58°C 30 seconds,<br>
72°C 45 seconds), 72°C 10 minutes. The expected sized band (-696 bp) was gel<br>
'/&gt;<br><br>
purified with a Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA), and cloned into pGEM T-<br>
Easy (Promega, Madison, Wl) to produce an intermediate plasmid pSYN-Fc-001<br>
(pGEM T-Easy/Fc).<br>
[0291] The mouse IgK signal sequence was added to the Fc CDS using the<br>
following primers:<br>
rc-lgK sig seq-F: 5'-TTTAAGCTTGCCGCCACCATGGAGACAGACACACTCC<br>
TGCTATGGGTACTGCTGCTCTGGGTTCCAGGTTCCACTGGTGACAAAACT<br>
CACACATGCCCACCG -3' (SEQ ID NO: 86)<br>
Fc-noXma-GS-R: 5'- GGTCAGCTCATCGCGGGATGGG -3' (SEQ ID NO: 87)<br>
Fc-noXma-GS-F: 5'- CCCATCCCGCGATGAGCTGACC -3' (SEQ ID NO: 88)<br>
[0292] The rc-lgK signal sequence-F primer adds a Hindi 11 restriction site to<br>
the 5'end of the molecule, followed by a Kozak sequence (GCCGCCACC) (SEQ ID<br>
NO: 89) followed by the signal sequence from the mouse IgK light chain, directly<br>
abutted to the beginning of the Fc sequence (EU# 221). The Fc-noXma-GS-F and -<br>
R primers remove the internal Xmal site from the Fc coding sequence, using the<br>
degeneracy of the genetic code to preserve the correct amino acid sequence. Two<br>
25 ul PCR reactions were carried out with 25 pmol of either rc-lgK signal sequence-F<br>
and Fc-noXma-GS-R or Fc-noXma-GS-F and rcFc-R using Expand High Fidelity<br>
System (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's<br>
standard protocol in a MJ Thermocycler. The first reaction was carried out with 500<br>
ng of leukocyte cDNA library (BD Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) as a<br>
template using the following cycles: 94°C 2 minutes; 30 cycles of (94°C 30 seconds,<br>
55°C 30 seconds, 72°C 45 seconds), 72°C 10 minutes. The second reaction was<br><br>
carried out with 500 ng of pSYN-Fc-001 as a template (above) using the following<br>
cycles: 94°C 2 minutes; 16 cycles of (94°C 30 seconds, 58°C 30 seconds, 72°C 45<br>
seconds), 72°C 10 minutes. The expected sized bands (-495 and 299 bp,<br>
respectively) were gel purified with a Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA), then<br>
combined in a PCR reaction with 25 pmol of rc-lgK signal sequence-F and rcFc-R<br>
primers and run as before, annealing at 58°C and continuing for 16 cycles. The<br>
expected sized band (-772 bp) was gel purified with a Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen,<br>
Valencia CA) and cloned into pGEM T-Easy (Promega, Madison, Wl) to produce an<br>
intermediate plasmid pSYN-Fc-007 (pGEM T-Easy/lgK sig seq-Fc). The entire IgK<br>
signal sequence-Fc cassette was then subcloned using the Hindlll and EcoRI sites<br>
into either the pEE6.4 (Lonza, Slough, UK) or pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA)<br>
mammalian expression vector, depending on the system to be used, to generate<br>
pSYN-Fc-009 (pEE6.4/lgK sig seq-Fc) and pSYN-Fc-015 (pcDNA3/lgK sig seq-Fc).<br>
Example 32: Cloning of IgK signal sequence - Fc N297A construct for making<br>
untagged Fc N297A alone.<br>
[0293] In order to mutate Asn 297 (EU numbering) of the Fc to an Ala<br>
residue, the following primers were used:<br>
N297A-F 5'- GAGCAGTACGCTAGCACGTACCG -3' (SEQ ID NO: 90)<br>
N297A-R 5'- GGTACGTGCTAGCGTACTGCTCC -3* (SEQ ID NO: 91)<br>
[0294] Two PCR reactions were carried out with 25 pmol of either rc-lgK<br>
signal sequence-F and N297A-R or N297A-F and rcFc-R using Expand High Fidelity<br>
System (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's<br>
standard protocol in a MJ Thermocycler. Both reactions were carried out using 500<br>
ttj<br><br>
ng of pSYN-Fc-007 as a template using the following cycles: 94°C 2 minutes; 16<br>
cycles of (94°C 30 seconds, 48°C 30 seconds, 72°C 45 seconds), 72°C 10 minutes.<br>
The expected sized bands (-319 and 475 bp, respectively) were gel purified with a<br>
Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA), then combined in a PCR reaction with 25<br>
pmol of rc-lgK signal sequence-F and rcFc-R primers and run as before, annealing at<br>
58°C and continuing for 16 cycles. The expected sized band (-772 bp) was gel<br>
purified with a Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA) and cloned into pGEM T-<br>
Easy (Promega, Madison, W!) to produce an intermediate plasmid pSYN-Fc-008<br>
(pGEM T-Easy/lgK sig seq-Fc N297A). The entire IgK signal sequence-Fc alone<br>
cassette was then subcloned using the Hindlll and EcoRI sites into either the<br>
pEE6.4 (Lonza, Slough, UK) or pcDNA3.1 (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA) mammalian<br>
expression vector, depending on the system to be used, to generate pSYN-Fc-010<br>
(pEE6.4/lgK sig seq-Fc N297A) and pSYN-Fc-016 (pcDNA3/lgK sig seq-Fc N297A).<br>
[0295] These same N297A primers were also used with rcFc-F and rcFc-R<br>
primers and pSYN-Fc-001 as a template in a PCR reaction followed by subcloning<br>
as indicated above to generate pSYN-Fc-002 (pGEM T Easy/Fc N297A).<br>
Example 33:Cloning of EpoFc and Fc into single plasmid for double gene<br>
vectors for making EpoFc wildtvpe or N297A monomer-dimer hybrids, and<br>
expression.<br>
[0296] An alternative to transfecting the EpoFc and Fc constructs on<br>
separate plasmids is to clone them into a single plasmid, also called a double gene<br>
vector, such as used in the Lonza Biologies (Slough, UK) system. The Rsrll/EcoRI<br>
fragment from pSYN-Fc-002 was subcloned into the corresponding sites in pEE12.4<br>
(Lonza Biologies, Slough, UK) according to standard procedures to generate pSYN-<br>
Fc-006 (pEE12.4/Fc N297A fragment). The pSYN-EPO-004 plasmid was used as a<br><br>
template for a PCR reaction using Epo-F primer from Example 25 and the following<br>
primer:<br>
EpoRsr-R: 5'- CTGACGGTCCGCCCAGGAGTTCCG<br>
GAGCTGGGCACGGTGGGCATG TGTGAGTTTTGTCGACCGCAGCGG -3' (SEQ<br>
ID HO: 91)<br>
[0297] A PCR reaction was carried out using Expand High Fidelity System<br>
(Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's standard<br>
protocol in a MJ Thermocycler as indicated above, for 16 cycles with 55°C annealing<br>
temperature. The expected sized band (-689 bp) was gel purified with a Gel<br>
Extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA) and cloned into pSYN-Fc-006 using the<br>
Hindlll/Rsrll restriction sites, to generate pSYN-EPO-005 (pEE12.4/EpoFc N297A).<br>
The double gene vector for the EpoFc N297A monomer-dimer hybrid was then<br>
constructed by cloning the Notl/BamHl fragment from pSYN-Fc-010 into the<br>
corresponding sites in pSYN-EPO-005 to generate pSYN-EPO-008 (pEE12.4-<br>
6.4/EpoFc N297A/FC N297A).<br>
[0298] The wild type construct was also made by subcloning the wild type Fc<br>
sequence from pSYN-Fc-001 into pSYN-EPO-005 using the Rsrll and EcoRI sites,<br>
to generate pSYN-EPO-006 (pEE12.4/EpoFc). The double gene vector for the<br>
EpoFc monomer-dimer hybrid was then constructed by cloning the Notl/BamHl<br>
fragment from pSYN-Fc-009 into the corresponding sites in pSYN-EPO-006 to<br>
generate pSYN-EPO-007 (pEE12.4-6.4/EpoFc/Fc).<br>
[0299] Each pfasmid was transfected into CHOK1SV cells and positive<br>
clones identified and adpated to serum-free suspension, as indicated in the Lonza<br>
I )<br><br>
Biologies Manual for Standard Operating procedures (Lonza Biologies, Slough, UK),<br>
and purified as indicated for the other monomer-dimer constructs.<br>
Example 34: Cloning of human IFNBFc, lFNB-Fc N297A with eight amino acid<br>
linkers and lgic-Fc-6His constructs<br>
[0300] 10 ng of a human genomic DNA library from Clontech (BD<br>
Biosciences Clontech, Palo Alto, CA) was used as a template to isolate human IFNp<br>
with its native signal sequence using the following primers:<br>
IFNp-F H3/SWI:<br>
5'- CTAGCCTGCAGGAAGCTTGCCGCCACCATGACCA<br>
ACAAGTGTCTCCTC -3' (SEQ ID NO: 92)<br>
IFNB-R (EFAG) Sal:<br>
5TTTGTCGACCGCAGCGGCGCCGGCGAACTCGTTTCGG<br>
AGGTAACCTGTAAG -3' (SEQ ID NO: 93)<br>
[0301] The reverse primer was also used to create an eight amino acid linker<br>
sequence (EFAGAAAV) (SEQ ID NO: 94) on the 3" end of the human IFNp<br>
sequence. The PCR reaction was carried out using the Expand High Fidelity<br>
System (Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's<br>
standard protocol in a Rapid Cycler thermocycler (Idaho Technology, Salt Lake City,<br>
UT). A PCR product of the correct size (-607 bp) was gel purified using a Gel<br>
Extraction kit (Qiagen; Valencia, CA), cloned into TA cloning vector (Promega,<br>
Madison, Wl) and sequenced. This construct was named pSYN-IFNp-002. pSYN-<br>
IFNp-002 was digested with Sbfl and Sail and cloned into pSP72 (Promega) at Pstl<br>
and Sail sites to give pSYN-IFNp-005.<br>
[0302] Purified pSYN-Fc-001 (0.6 ug) was digested with Sail and EcoRI<br>
and cloned into the corresponding sites of pSYN-IFNp-005 to create the plasmid<br>
pSYN-IFNp-006 which contains human IFNp linked to human Fc through an eight<br>
l*~*-~<br><br>
amino acid linker sequence. pSYN-IFNp-006 was then digested with Sbfl and EcoRl<br>
and the full-length IFNfi-Fc sequence cloned into the Pstl and EcoRl sites of<br>
pEDdC.sig to create plasmid pSYN-IFNp-008.<br>
[0303] pSYN-Fc-002 containing the human Fc DNA with a single amino acid<br>
change from asparagine to alanine at position 297 (N297A; EU numbering) was<br>
digested with BspEI and Xmal to isolate a DNA fragment of -365 bp containing the<br>
N297A mutation. This DNA fragment was cloned into the corresponding sites in<br>
pSYN-IFNp-008 to create plasmid pSYN-IFNp-009 that contains the IFNp-Fc<br>
sequence with an eight amino acid linker and an N297A mutation in Fc in the<br>
expression vector, pED.dC.<br>
[0304] Cloning of IgK signal sequence-Fc N297A - 6His. The following<br>
primers were used to add a 6xHis tag to the C terminus of the Fc N297A coding<br>

Sp6+T-R: 5'- GCTATTTAGGTGACACTATAGAATACTCAAGC -3' (SEQ ID NO: 98)<br>
[0305] Two PCR reactions were carried out with 50 pmol of either Fc GS-F<br>
and Fc.6His-R or Fc.6His-F and Sp6+T-R using the Expand High Fidelity System<br>
(Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) according to the manufacturer's standard<br>
protocol in a MJ Thermocycler. Both reactions were carried out using 500 ng of<br>
A2-S<br><br>
pSYN-Fc-008 as a template in a 50 JJI reaction, using standard cycling conditions.<br>
The expected sized bands (-780 and 138 bp, respectively) were gel purified with a<br>
Gel Extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA), then combined in a 50 pi PCR reaction<br>
with 50 pmol of Fc GS-F and Sp6+T-R primers and run as before, using standard<br>
cycling conditions. The expected sized band (-891 bp) was gel purified with a Gel<br>
Extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia CA) and cloned into pcDNA6 V5-His B using the<br>
Hindlll and EcoRI sites to generate pSYN-Fc-014 (pcDNA6/lgK sig seq-Fc N297A-6<br>
His).<br>
Example 35: Expression and purification of lFNBFc, IFNB-Fc N297A<br>
homodimer and IFNP-Fc N297A monomer-dimer hybrid<br>
[0306] CHO DG44 cells were plated in 100 mm tissue culture dishes and<br>
grown to a confluency of 50%-60%. A total of 10 ug of DNA was used to transfect a<br>
single 100 mm dish. For the homodimer transfection, 10 pg of the pSYN-FNB-008 or<br>
pSYN-IFNB-009 construct was used; for the monomer-dimer hybrid transfection, 8<br>
pg of the pSYN-IFNB-009 + 2 pg of pSYN-Fc-014 construct was used. The cells<br>
were transfected using Superfect transfection reagents (Qiagen, Valencia, CA)<br>
according to the manufacturer's instructions. 48 to 72 hours post-transfection,<br>
growth medium was removed and cells were released from the plates with 0.25%<br>
trypsin and transferred to T75 tissue culture flasks in selection medium (MEM Alpha<br>
without nucleosides plus 5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum). The selection medium for<br>
the monomer-dimer hybrid transfection was supplemented with 5 pg/ml Blasticidin<br>
(Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA). Selection was continued for 10-14 days until the cells<br>
began to grow well and stable cell lines were established. Protein expression was<br>
subsequently amplified by the addition methotrexate: ranging from 10 to 50 nM.<br><br>
[0307] For all cell lines, approximately 2 x 107 cells were used to inoculate<br>
300 ml of growth medium in a 1700 cm2 roller bottle (Corning, Corning, NY). The<br>
roller bottles were incubated in a 5% C02 incubator at 37°C for approximately 72<br>
hours. The growth medium was then exchanged with 300 mi serum-free production<br>
medium (DMEM/F12 with 5 ug/ml human insulin). The production medium<br>
(conditioned medium) was collected every day for 10 days and stored at 4°C. Fresh<br>
production medium was added to the roller bottles after each collection and the<br>
bottles were returned to the incubator. Prior to chromatography, the medium was<br>
clarified using a SuporCap-100 (0.8/0.2 urn) filter from Pall Gelman Sciences (Ann<br>
Arbor, Ml). All of the following steps were performed at 4°C. The clarified medium<br>
was applied to Protein A Sepharose, washed with 5 column volumes of 1X PBS (10<br>
mM phosphate, pH 7.4, 2.7 mM KCI, and 137 mM NaCI), eluted with 0.1 M glycine,<br>
pH 2.7, and then neutralized with 1/10 volume of 1 M Tris-HCI pH 8.0, 5 M NaCI.<br>
The homodimer proteins were further purified over a Superdex 200 Prep Grade<br>
sizing column run and eluted in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCI,<br>
10% glycerol.<br>
[0308] The monomer-dimer hybrid protein was subject to further purification<br>
since it contained a mixture of IFNpFc. N297A:IFNpFc N297A homodimer, IFNJ3Fc<br>
N297A: Fc N297A His monomer-dimer hybrid, and Fc N297A His: Fc N297A His<br>
homodimer. Material was applied to a Nickel chelating column in 50 mM sodium<br>
phosphate pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCI. After loading, the column was washed with 50<br>
mM imidazole in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH 7.5, 500 mM NaCI and protein was<br>
eluted with a gradient of 50 - 500 mM imidazole in 50 mM sodium phosphate pH<br>
7.5, 500 mM NaCI. Fractions corresponding to elution peaks on a UV detector were<br>
J2S&gt;<br><br>
collected and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. Fractions from the first peak contained<br>

Example 36: Antiviral assay for IFNP activity<br>
[0309] Antiviral activity (lU/ml) of IFNp fusion proteins was determined using<br>
a CPE (cytopathic effect) assay. A549 cells were plated in a 96 well tissue culture<br>
plate in growth media (RPM11640 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS)<br>
and 2 mM L-glutamine) for 2 hours at 37°C, 5% C02. IFNp standards and IFNp<br>
fusion proteins were diluted in growth media and added to cells in triplicate for 20<br>
hours at 37°C, 5% C02. Following incubation, all media was removed from wells,<br>
encephalomyocarditis virus (EMCV) was diluted in growth media and added (3000<br>
pfu/well) to each well with the exception of control wells. Plates were incubated at<br>
37°C, 5% CCfor 28 hours. Living cells were fixed with 10% cold trichloroacetic acid<br>
(TCA) and then stained with Sulforhodamine B (SRB) according to published<br>
protocols (Rubinstein et al. 1990, J. Natl. Cancer Inst 82,1113). The SRB dye was<br>
solubilized with 10 mM Tris pH 10.5 and read on a spectrophotometer at 490 nm.<br>
Samples were analyzed by comparing activities to a known standard curve ranging<br>
from 10 to 0.199 Ill/ml. The results are presented below in Table 8 and demonstrate<br>
increased antiviral activity of monomer-dimer hybrids.<br>

Hybrid With an Eight Amino Acid Linker to Cynomolqus Monkeys<br>
[0310] For pulmonary administration, aerosols of either IFNpFc homodimer<br>
or IFNpFc N297A monomer-dimer hybrid proteins (both with the 8 amino acid linker)<br>
in PBS, pH 7.4, 0.25% HSA were created with the Aeroneb Pro™ (AeroGen,<br>
Mountain View, CA) nebulizer, in-line with a Bird Mark 7A respirator, and<br>
administered to anesthetized na'ive cynomolgus monkeys through endotracheal<br>
tubes (approximating normal tidal breathing). Blood samples were taken at various<br>
time points, and the amount of IFNp-containing protein in the resulting serum was<br>
quantitated using a human IFNp Immunoassay (Biosource International, Camarillo,<br>
CA). Pharmacokinetic parameters were calculated using the software WinNonLin.<br>
Table 9 presents the results of cynomolgus monkeys treated with IFNpFc N297A<br>

Based on 15% deposition fraction of nebulized dose as determined by gamma scintigraphy<br>
[0311] The pharmacokinetics of IFNpFc with an 8 amino acid linker<br>
administered to cynomolgus monkeys is presented in figure 15. The figure<br>
compares the IFNpFc homodimer with the IFNpFc N297A monomer-dimer hybrid in<br>
monkeys after administration of a single pulmonary dose. Significantly higher serum<br>
levels were obtained in monkeys treated with the monomer-dimer hybrid compared<br>
to the homodimer.<br>
[0312] Serum samples were also analyzed for neopterin levels (a biomarker<br>
of IFNp activity) using a neopterin immunoassay (MP Biomedicals, Orangeburg,<br>
NY). The results for this analysis are shown in figure 16. The figure compares<br>
neopterin stimulation in response to the IFNp-Fc homodimer and the IFNp-Fc N297A<br>
monomer-dimer hybrid. It can be seen that significantly higher neopterin levels were<br>
detected in monkeys treated with IFNp-Fc N297A monomer-dimer hybrid as<br>
compared to the IFNp-Fc homodimer.<br>
