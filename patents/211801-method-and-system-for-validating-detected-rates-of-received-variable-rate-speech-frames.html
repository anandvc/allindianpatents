The disclosed embodiments relate to wireless communications. More particularly, the disclosed embodiments relate to a novel and improved method and apparatus for detecting, at a receiver of a variable rate communication system, errors in the determination of the rate at which data has been encoded for transmission.<br>
II. Background<br>
FIG. 1 is an illustrative stepdiagram of a variable rate CDMA transmission system 10 described in the Telecommunications Industry Association over-the-air interface standard TIA/EIA Interim Standard 95, and its derivatives, such as, e.g., IS-95B (hereinafter referred to collectively as IS-95). This transmission system may be provided, for example, within a base station of a cellular transmission system for use in transmitting signals to mobile telephone subscriber units within a cell surrounding the base station. It may also be provided within mobile telephone subscriber units for use in transmitting signals to a base station.<br>
A microphone 11 detects a speech signal which is then sampled and digitized by an analog to digital converter (not shown). A variable rate data source 12 receives the digitized samples of the speech signal and encodes the signal to provide packets of encoded speech of equal frame lengths. Variable rate data source 12 may, for example, convert the digitized samples of the input<br><br>
speech to digitized speech parameters representative of the input voice signal using Linear Predictive Coding (LPC) techniques. In an exemplary embodiment, the variable rate data source is a variable rate vocoder as described in detail in U.S, Patent No. 5,414,796, which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and is incorporated by reference herein. Variable rate data source 12 provides variable rate packets of data at four possible frame rates 9600 bits per second (bps), 4800 bps, 2400 bps, and 1200 bps, referred to herein as full, half, quarter, and eighth rates. Packets encoded at full rate contain 172 information bits, packets encoded at half rate contain 80 information bits, packets encoded at quarter rate contain 40 information bits, and packets encoded at eighth rate contain 16 information bits. Packet formats are shown in FIGS. 2A - 2D. The packets, regardless of size, all are one frame length in duration, i.e. 20 ms. Herein, the terms "frame" and "packet" may be used interchangeably.<br>
The packets are encoded and transmitted at different rates to compress the data contained therein based, in part, on the complexity or amount of information represented by the frame. For example, if the input voice signal includes little or no variation, perhaps because the speaker is not speaking, the information bits of the corresponding packet may be compressed and encoded at eighth rate. This compression results in a loss of resolution of the corresponding portion of the voice signal but, given that the corresponding portion of the voice signal contains little or no information, the reduction in signal resolution is not typically noticeable. Alternatively, if the corresponding input voice signal of the packet includes much information, perhaps because the speaker is actively vocalizing, the packet is encoded at full rate and the compression of the input speech is reduced to achieve better voice quality.<br>
This compression and encoding technique is employed to limit, on the average, the amount of information being transmitted at any one time to thereby allow the overall bandwidth of the transmission system to be utilized more effectively to allow, for example, a greater number of telephone calls to be processed at any one time.<br><br>
The variable rate packets generated by data source 12 are provided to packetizer 13, which selectively appends Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) bits and tail bits. As shown in FIG. 2A, when a frame is encoded by the variable rate data source 12 at full rate, packetizer 13 generates and appends twelve CRC bits and eight tail bits. Similarly, as shown in FIG. 2B, when a frame is encoded by the variable rate data source 12 at half rate, packetizer 13 generates and appends eight CRC bits and eight tail bits. As shown in FIG. 2C, when a frame is encoded by the variable rate data source 12 at quarter rate, packetizer 13 generates and appends eight tail bits. As shown in FIG. 2D, when a frame is encoded by the variable rate data source 12 at eighth rate, packetizer 13 generates and appends eight tail bits.<br>
The variable rate packets from packetizer 13 are then provided to encoder 14, which encodes the bits of the variable rate packets for error detection and correction purposes. In an exemplary embodiment, encoder 14 is a rate 1/3 convolutional encoder. The convolutionally encoded symbols are then provided to a CDMA spreader 16, an implementation of which is described in detail in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,103,459 and 4,901,307. CDMA spreader<br>
16	maps eight encoded symbols to a 64-bit Walsh symbol and then spreads the<br>
Walsh symbols in accordance with a pseudo-random noise (PN) code.<br>
Repetition generator 17 receives the spread packets. For packets of less than full rate, repetition generator 17 generates duplicates of the symbols in the packets to provide packets of a constant data rate. When the variable rate packet is half rate, the repetition generator 17 introduces a factor of two redundancy, i.e., each spread symbol is repeated twice within the output packet. When the variable rate packet is quarter rate, the repetition generator<br>
17	introduces a factor of four redundancy.  When the variable rate packet is<br>
eighth rate, the repetition generator 17 introduces a factor of eight redundancy.<br>
Repetition generator 17 provides the aforementioned redundancy by dividing the spread data packet into smaller sub-packets referred to as "power control groups." In the exemplary embodiment, each power control group comprises 6 PN spread Walsh Symbols. The constant rate frame is generated<br><br>
by consecutively repeating each power control group the requisite number of times to fill the frame as described above.<br>
The spread packets are then provided to a data burst randomizer 18, which removes the redundancy from the spread packets in accordance with a pseudo-random process as described in U.S. Patent No. 5,535,239, assigned to the assignee of the present invention. Data burst randomizer 18 selects one of the spread power control groups for transmission in accordance with a pseudorandom selection process and gates the other redundant copies of that power control group.<br>
The packets are provided by data burst randomizer 18 to finite impulse response (FIR) filter 20, an example of which is described in U.S. Patent No. 5,659,569, and assigned to the assignee of the present invention. The filtered signal is then provided to digital to analog converter 22 and converted to an analog signal. The analog signal is then provided to transmitter 24, which up-converts and amplifies the signal for transmission through antenna 26.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates pertinent components of a base station. In another embodiment the apparatus of FIG. 3 could reside in a mobile telephone 28 or other mobile station receiving the transmitted signal. The signal is received by antenna 30, down-converted and amplified, if necessary, by receiver 32. The signal is then provided to frame rate detection unit 33, which subdivides the signal into packets and determines the corresponding frame rate for each packet. The frame rate may be determined, depending upon the implementation, by detecting the duration of individual bits of the frame. The packet and a signal identifying the detected frame rate for the packet are then forwarded to CRC unit 34 for performing cyclic redundancy checks or related error detection checks in an attempt to verify that no transmission errors or frame rate detection errors occurred. A frame rate detection error results in the packet being sampled at an incorrect rate resulting in a sequence of bits that are effectively random. A transmission error typically results in only one or two bits being in error. Usually, if a transmission error or frame rate detection error occurs, the CRC unit detects the error. "Bad* frames failing the CRC are erased<br><br>
or otherwise discarded by frame erasure unit 36. "Good" frames which pass the CRC are routed to variable rate decoder 40 for conversion back to digitized voice signals. The digitized voice signals are converted to analog signals by a digital to analog converter (not shown) for ultimate output through a speaker 42 of the mobile telephone.<br>
Depending upon the implementation, no separate frame erasure unit 36 is necessarily required. Rather, CRC unit 34 may be configured merely to not output bad frames to variable rate decoder 40. However, provision of a frame erasure unit facilitates generation of frame erasure signals for forwarding back to the base station to notify the base station of the frame erasure error. The base station may use the frame erasure information to modulate the amount of power employed to transmit signals, perhaps as part of a feedback system intended to minimize transmitted power while also minimizing frame errors.<br>
As noted above, by varying the frame rate of packets to thereby compress the information contained therein, the overall bandwidth of the system is utilized more effectively, usually without any noticeable effect on the transmitted signal. However, problems occur occasionally which have a noticeable effect. One such problem occurs if a frame subject to a frame rate detection error or a transmission error nevertheless passes the CRC. In such cases, the bad frame is not erased but is processed along with other good frames. The error may or may not be noticeable. For example, if the error is a transmission error wherein only one or two bits of encoded speech are in error, the error may have only an extremely slight and probably unnoticeable effect on the output voice signal. However, if the error is a frame rate detection error, the entire packet will thereby be processed using the incorrect frame rate causing effectively random bits to be input to the decoder, likely resulting in a noticeable artifact in the output voice signal. Noticeable artifacts caused by frame rate detection errors are such unacceptable distortions as screeches, or beeps. For some systems, it has been found that incorrect frame rate detections occur with a probability of about .005% yielding an incorrectly received packet and a corresponding artifact in the output voice signal about every sixteen<br><br>
minutes of conversation time. Although described with respect to a CDMA system using IS-95 protocols, similar problems can occur in almost any transmission system employing variable transmission rates and in related systems as well.<br>
Due to effects of channel conditions such, as noise, and multi-path fading on received parameters, rate determination algorithms (RDA) of frame rate detection units 33 do not guarantee that the received frame rate is correct. Given that this is a limitation of the RDA, it is desirable to ensure that such RDA errors don't cause audible artifacts such as screeches, or beeps. When the received frame is not suitable for accurate rate-determination due to poor channel conditions, the RDA either determines that the frame has to be erased or it assigns an incorrect rate to the packet. Typically, the speech decoder has a frame-erasure processing mechanism that perceptually smooths the lost frames using past frames, and produces speech that is not annoying to the listener. However, if instead of a frame erasure, the RDA assigns an incorrect rate to the frame, random bits are fed into the variable rate decoder 40. Unless detected, the random bits can produce very loud, annoying artifacts such as screeches, and beeps. It is generally true that a frame-erasure does not produce as much speech quality degradations as an incorrect rate frame.<br>
It is desirable to handle these incorrect rate frames without generating audible artifacts. It is desirable to detect an incorrect rate frame, and perform frame-erasure processing, and/or clean-up the memory states in the variable rate decoder 40, such that effects of incorrect rate determination do not propagate across many frames.<br>
Therefore, it can be appreciated that there is a significant need for a method that detects rate determination errors in a wireless communication system, and eliminates resultant audible artifacts.<br><br>
The disclosed embodiments are directed to a system and method for detection of rate determination algorithm errors in variable rate communications system receivers[HG 4]. Accordingly, a method for detecting rate errors in a variable rate receiver, comprising receiving an encoded speech signal, performing a rate determination algorithm on the speech signal to provide an encoded rate, and detecting errors in the provided rate, is described.<br>
In another embodiment, A rate error detection system, comprising a receiver for receiving an encoded speech signal, a rate determination element for performing a rate determination algorithm on the speech signal to provide an encoded rate, and a rate error detector for detecting errors in the provided rate, is described.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED<br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
An exemplary embodiment of improved detection of rate errors in variable rate receivers is implemented in a Selectable Mode Vocoder (SMV). The SMV is a variable rate vocoder, and is a candidate to be used by the third generation CDMA system, IS2000. The SMV vocoder algorithm uses a variety of parameters such as source-controlled rate, frame-type, LP coefficients, adaptive, and fixed code-book parameters. Speech to be encoded is analyzed for the amount of perceptual information it contains. The analysis classifies speech into various types such as background noise, stationary unvoiced speech, stationary voiced speech, and non-stationary speech (onsets, transients, etc.). Inter-speech background noise is encoded using eighth rate. Stationary unvoiced speech is encoded using a quarter-rate Noise Excited Linear Prediction (NELF) scheme. Stationary voiced speech is encoded using a full or half rate Type-1 CELP scheme. Non-stationary speech is encoded using a full or half rate Type-0 CELP scheme. The Type information controls several aspects of the coding of the frame, such as the sub-frame size, the parameters used for speech representation, and the coding scheme for these parameters.<br><br>
Frames of type 0 are "non-periodic" frames, where the typical parameters, such as pitch correlation and pitch lag, can change rapidly. Thus, in Type-0 CELP the pitch lag is coded and transmitted more frequently (i.e., for every sub-frame). Frames of Type-1 are "periodic" frames that have high periodicity and are perceptually well represented with a smooth pitch track. In Type-1 CELP the pitch lag is coded once per frame, and the interpolated pitch track is derived from this lag. Because of the high periodicity and the smooth pitch track, the pitch gains exhibit very stable behavior and are jointly quantized. One bit of each stationary voiced and non-stationary speech frame is used to indicate the CELP scheme type.<br>
One skilled in the art would recognize that the SMV may be implemented using field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs), programmable logic devices (PLDs), digital signal processors (DSPs), one or more microprocessors, an application specific integrated circuit (ASIC), or any other device capable of performing the SMV functions described above.<br>
The disclosed embodiments are described in the context of CDMA phones. However, it should be understood that the disclosed embodiments are applicable to other types of communications systems and modulation techniques, such as Personal Communications Systems (PCS), wireless local loop (WLL), private branch exchange (PBX), or other known systems. Furthermore, systems utilizing other well known transmission modulation schemes such as TDMA and FDMA as well as other spread spectrum systems may employ the disclosed embodiments.<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, FIG. 4 illustrates pertinent components of a mobile subscriber unit 28, or other mobile station, receiving a signal provided by a base station transmission system such as the system of FIG. 1 wherein a signal having variable rate packets is transmitted. Frame rates include full rate, half rate, quarter rate, and eighth rate as shown in FIGS. 2A -2D. The packets include encoded speech parameters representative of a compressed voice signal. In addition, each packet includes CRC bits and/or encoder tail bits.   Additional details regarding the content of the packets is<br><br>
provided above in connection with FIG. 1 and in U.S. Patent No. 5,414796 referenced above.<br>
The illustrated components of FIG. 4 are similar to those of FIG. 3 and only pertinent differences will be described in detail. The transmitted signal is received by antenna 30, and downconverted and amplified by receiver 32. The signal is then provided to a frame rate detection unit 33, which attempts to determine the corresponding frame rate for the packet, losing a Rate Determination Algorithm (RDA). The packet is then provided to a CRC unit 34 for performing cyclic redundancy checks on frames of the received signal in an attempt to verify that no frame rate detection error or transmission error occurred. Frames failing the CRC, i.e. bad frames, are erased by frame erasure unit 36. As noted above, no separate frame erasure unit is necessarily required. Rather, frames subject to CRC errors may merely not be output from the CRC unit 34. In either case, frames that pass the CRC, i.e. potentially good frames, are routed to a rate error detector 38. Depending upon the implementation, no separate rate error detector unit 38 is necessarily required. Rather, rate error detector unit 38 may be implemented in the SMV or integrated with other receiver components.<br>
The rate error detector 38 further examines the frames to verify that the frame rate detected by the RDA of frame rate detection unit 33 is indeed correct. The frames are further verified by rate error detector 38 using the verification methods for full, half, quarter, and eighth rate frames described below in detail with reference to FIGS 5-8. Frames failing verification may be erased by frame erasure unit 36, Frames failing verification may also be processed to clean up memory states in the variable rate decoder 40 so that distortion does not propagate across many frames. Rate, control, and frame information is output from the rate error detector 38 to the variable rate decoder 40 for cleanup processing. Frames that pass the rate error detector verification are routed directly to variable rate decoder 40.<br>
Variable rate decoder 40 processes the frames by decoding speech parameters contained therein for conversion back to digitized voice signals.<br><br>
The digitized voice signals are ultimately converted to analog signals by a digital to analog converter (not shown) for output through a speaker 42 of the to a listener when the receiver is a mobile subscriber unit. The digital signal may be further propagated within a wireless system when the receiver is a base station.<br>
FIGS* 5-8 describe in detail the frame rate verification methods in accordance with the embodiments for full, half, quarter, and eighth rate frames performed by the rate error detector (FIG. 4, element 38). The verification methods employ novel use of illegal classification transitions for frames of specified rates and types, reserved bit checking, illegal filter type verification, and analysis of fixed codebook (FCB) vs. LPC threshold gain curves. Additionally, the disclosed embodiments of FIGS 5-8 employ novel use of frame erasure processing and memory state manipulation to smooth effects of detected frame rate errors.<br>
The disclosed embodiments impose a novel state transition structure on rate transitions of consecutive frames based on knowledge of speech classification and the phonetic character of conversational speech. Rate transitions that violate the structure are illegal, and are used to detect frames rate errors. These illegal rate transitions are defined to comprise:<br>
a full-rate frame followed by an eighth-rate frame;<br>
a full-rate, Type-1 frame followed by an eighth-rate frame;<br>
a half-rate, Type-1 frame followed by an eighth-rate frame;<br>
a quarter-rate frame followed by a Type-1 full-rate frame;<br>
a quarter-rate frame followed by a Type-1 half-rate frame;<br>
an eighth-rate frame followed by a Type-1 full-rate frame;<br>
an eighth -rate frame followed by a Type-1 half-rate frame;<br>
an eighth-rate frame followed by a quarter-rate frame followed by an eighth-rate frame;<br>
an eighth-rate frame followed by a half-rate frame followed by an eighth-rate frame; and<br><br>
an eighth-rate frame followed by a full-rate frame followed by an eighth-rate frame. Based on the current and previous frame rates and types, the presence of illegal transitions indicates an RDA error in either the current frame or the previous frame.<br>
The disclosed embodiments employ novel use of full rate and quarter rate reserved transmitted bits for detecting RDA errors. A full-rate packet has 171 information bits per 20 ms frame, in which 1 bit is a reserve bit. The reserve bit can be set by an encoder to a fixed value of either zero or one. The reserved bit is checked by the rate error detector (FIG 4, element 38) to determine . whether the received reserve bit has the expected fixed encoded value. Reserved bits not received as expected indicate an RDA error in the current full rate frame. A quarter-rate packet has 40 bits per 20 ms frame in which NELP uses 39 bits, while one bit is unused. Again, the unused bit can be set by the encoder to a fixed value of either zero or one,. The unused bit is checked by the rate error detector (FIG 4, element 38) to detennine whether the received unused bit has the expected fixed encoded value. Unused bits not received as expected indicate an RDA error in the current quarter rate frame.<br>
The disclosed embodiments employ novel use of illegal filter type checking for quarter rate NELP frames to detect rate errors. NELP encoding employs spectral shaping of pseudo-random excitation using one of 3 different shaping filters. Two bits are used to transmit the index of the selected filter. Three of the two-bit patterns are used to identify the selected shaping filter, leaving a fourth 2-bit pattern unused, or illegal. Presence of the unused, or illegal pattern indicates an RDA error in the current quarter rate NELP frame.<br>
The disclosed embodiments employ novel use of encoded parameters for detecting rate errors. Investigations into effects of RDA errors on vocoders reveal that audio artifacts such as screeches and beeps are mainly caused by excessively high FCB gain values accompanied by high LPC prediction gain values. Natural speech, when analyzed by an encoder for encoding parameters, produces FCB gains and LPC prediction gains that have an inverse<br><br>
relation with respect to each other. In other words, when the LPC gain is high, the FCB gains is generally low, and when the LPC gain is low, the FCB gain is generally high.<br>
The inverse relationship of FCB gains and LPC gains in natural speech produce a curve in the graph of FCB gain vs. LPC gain above which there is no representation of good natural speech. The FCB gain, and hence the graphical curve can be a function of the input speech level. Frames received at levels above the curve, where there is no representation of good natural speech indicate a rate error in the frame. A novel method for removing the variance due to the input level, when a rate error is graphically detected, is to normalize the FCB gain using an average energy value computed from past frames. FIG. 9 shows a scatter plot indicating the relationship between the normalized FCB gain and the LP prediction gain. Circles below the solid curve were generated by clean speech, and the asterisks above the solid lines correspond to unacceptable screeches caused by RDA errors. The solid curve represents a threshold curve that separates the region of good speech from unacceptable screeches or other artifacts. This threshold can easily be represented in a parametric form and incorporated into the rate error detector (FIG 4, element 38). After the FCB gain and the LPC gains have been established for a received packet, a check can be performed to determine if the frame lies below the threshold curve. If the frame does not lie below the threshold cure, screeching due to an RDA error is indicated.<br>
The disclosed embodiments employ novel use of eighth rate excitation gain to detect rate errors. Because the eighth-rate coding scheme is used only for background noise portions of speech, the excitation energy, which is quantized using a gain parameter, has an upper limit. When the excitation gain is obtained from the received packets, a check can be performed to see if the excitation gain lies below the gain parameter upper limit. An RDA error is indicated if the gain parameter does not lie below the upper limit.<br>
When any of the disclosed detection mechanisms indicates a frame rate error in either the current frame or immediately preceding frames, the<br><br>
disclosed embodiments may employ one or more novel schemes while decoding to eliminate the resultant distortion and /or prevent the distortion from propagating across multiple frames. The schemes comprise frame erasure processing, reduction of FCB gain, and resetting of memory states.<br>
Vocoders typically have a built-in process to handle frame erasures. The frame erasure process can be used by the disclosed embodiments for any frame in which the rate error detector (FIG. 4, element 38) has detected an RDA error. The frame erasure process synthesizes speech without using any information from the current frame, and derives all the decoder parameters from the past memory in order to produce speech that is perceptually smoothed with respect to the previous frames.<br>
When a rate error is detected because a frame is received at a level above the FCB vs. LPC gain curve where there is no representation of good natural speech, the decoder (FIG 4, element 40) can forcibly reduce the FCB gain to a lesser value that will prevent a high energy screech or beep from being produced at the output of the decoder (FIG 4, element 40).<br>
Vocoder algorithms typically reconstruct speech using past memory states. These memory states include the Moving-average vector quantizer (MAVQ) memory for FCB gain, excitation memory, LPC synthesis memory, and post-filter synthesis memory. An undetected RDA error can inject bad values into these memories. The effects of bad values can last for many frames in the future, even if all the future frames are healthy frames. To prevent corruption of future frames RDA errors detected as described in the current or immediately previous frames, can cause the FCB gain MAVQ, Excitation, LPC synthesis filter, and Post-filter synthesis filter memories tq be reset to predefined values that do not produce high energy screeches. In one embodiment, the memory values are overwritten with zeros. In another embodiment, the memory values are overwritten with their respective initialization values.<br>
