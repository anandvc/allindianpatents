EXTENSIBLE EVENT NOTIFICATION MECHANISM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
/.	Field of the Invention<br>
1	The present invention relates to event detection and alert systems implemented in computer<br>
software.<br>
//.       Description of the Related Art<br>
I	An interrupt is a signal from a device attached to a computer or from a program within the<br>
computer that causes the main program that operates the computer (the operating system) to stop and figure out what to do next. Many computers today are intenxipt-driven. They start down the list of computer instructions in one program (perhaps an application such as a word processor) and keep running the instructions until either they cannot go any further, or an interrupt signal is sensed. After the interrupt signal is sensed, the computer either resumes running the program it was running or begins running another program.<br>
I	Basically, a single computer can perform only one computer instruction at a time. But,<br>
because it can be interrupted, it can take turns in which programs or sets of instructions that it performs. This is known as multitasking. It allows the user to do a number of different things at the same time. The computer simply takes turns managing the programs that the user effectively starts. Of course, the computer operates at speeds that make it seem as though all of the usefs tasks are being performed at the same time. (The computer's operating system is good at using little pauses in operations and user think time to work on other programs.)<br>
An operating system usually has some code that is called an interrupt handler. The interrupt handler prioritizes the interrupts and saves them in a queue if more than one is waiting to be handled. The operating system has another little program, sometimes called a scheduler, which figures out which program to give control to next. An interrupt request will have a value associated with it that identifies it as a particular device.<br>
Although beneficial in the single-processor context, the state of the art is not completely satisfactory for systems with many different programs that require varying degrees of notification of a variety of different events. In current implementations, notifications are typically "hard-wired" in that they are provided through specific function calls supported by the specific functional area responsible for the notification. There implementations lack any facility for dynamically extending<br><br>
the mechanism.   Further, in order to add a new type of notification, a new set of application prograrruner interfaces must be developed.<br>
Consequently, known event notification schemes are not completely adequate for some applications due to certain unsolved problems.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE IffVENTION<br>
Broadly, the present invention concerns an extensible event notification system that detects certain events, and notifies requestor programs that have registered for such notification. The system includes a notification manager, multiple event notifier programs, multiple requestor programs, a map, and notification dictionary.<br>
Initially, each requestor program submits a respective registration request to the notification. manager. Each registration request is a request to recei ve notification of one or more future events in an event "class" associated with a particular notifier program. Each registration request includes a requestor ID (identifying the requestor program) and a notifier ED (identifying the event notifier program corresponding to the event class for which registration is sought). The notification manager stores identification of the requesting programs in a map in association with contents of the registration requests.<br>
At various times, the notification manager activates a number of event notifier programs, each corresponding to a particular event class. When a notifier program detects an event (from the event class that is detectable by the notifier program), it notifies the notification manager. In response, the notification manager takes action to advise the appropriate requesting programs of the event's occurrence. First, the notification manager accesses the map to identify all requesting programs that have submitted registration requests concerning activated notifier program. Then, the notification manager activates the identified requesting programs and sends them a representation of the occurred event. If desired, the notification manager may also deactivate the activated requesting programs at an appropriate time.<br>
The foregoing features may be implemented in a number of different fomis. For example, the invention may be implemented to provide a method of operating an extensible event notification system. In another embodiment, the invention may be implemented to provide an apparatus such as an extensible event notification system. In still another embodiment, the invention may be implemented to provide a signal-bearing medium tangibly embodying a program of machine-readable instructions executable by a digital data processing apparatus to operate an extensible event<br><br>
notification system as discussed herein. Another embodiment concerns logic circuitry having multiple interconnected electrically conductive elements configured to provide an extensible notification system of the invention described herein.<br>
The invention affords its users with a number of distinct advantages. Chiefly, since registration occurs using requestor and notifier program IDs rather than pointers to these programs in memory, registration can occur regardless of whether the requestor or notifier programs exists in memoiy at the time of the registration. Advantageously, the notification is managed without any requirement for the requestor program to be loaded and actively checking for the specific event. The invention also provides a number of other advantages and benefits, which should be apparent from the following description of the invention.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The nature, objectives, and advantages of the invention will become more apparent to those skilled in the art after considering the following detailed description in connection with the accompanying drawings.<br>
HARDWARE COMPONENTS &amp; INTERCONNECTIONS Overall Structure<br>
One aspect of the invention concerns an extensible event notification system, which may be embodied by various hardware components and interconnections, with one example being described by the system 100 of FIGURE 1. The system 100 includes a notification manager 102, multiple requestor programs 108, multiple notifier programs 104, a map 110, and dictionary 112.<br><br>
Requestor Programs<br>
The requestor programs 108 comprise software programs that perform various diverse functions, the details of which depend upon the application context of the system 100, e.g., wireless telephone, automotive computer, etc. Each requestor program is configured to take action in response to the occurrence of certain events 106. In order to receive notification of the events 106, the requestor programs 108 register with the notification manager 102, as described in greater detail below. Each requestor program 108 has associated identifier (BD), shown by the IDs 108a-108c. In the present example, each requestor program ID comprises a different thirty-two bit binary number. Although shown with each requestor program, the associated ID may be alternatively stored elsewhere in a list, table, map, or other construct that associates requestor programs with IDs 108a-lOSc,<br>
Notifier Programs<br>
The notifier programs 104 comprise software programs that detect the occurrence of various events 106. The events 106 may comprise hardware and/or software events occurring within the system 100 or external thereto, the exact nature of which depends upon the application context of the system 100. Some exemplary events include changes in configuration of hardware devices, expiration of times, arrival of prescribed times, completion of processing tasks, experience of particular hardware interrupts.<br>
Each notifier program 104, as illustrated, is capable of detecting multiple different events. The events that are detectable by a particular notifier program 104 are referred to as the notifier program's "event class." Each notifier program 104 includes an ID, shown by the IDs 104a-104c. In the present example, each notifier IDs comprises a different thirty-two bit number. Although shown with each notifier program, the associated ID may be alternatively stored elsewhere in a list, table, map, or other construct that associates notifier programs with IDS 104a-104c. Each notifier program 104 serves to notify the notification manager 102 in response to detecting an event of that notifier program's event class.<br>
Notification Manager<br>
The notification manager 102, which is communicatively coupled to the notifier programs 104 and requestor programs 108, serves to receive registration requests from the requestor programs 108 and also receive event notifications from the notifier programs 104. The registration requests are requests from the requesting programs to receive notification of one or more future event types; each<br><br>
registration request includes the requestor program's ID 108a-10Sc and identification of the notifier<br>
program 104 corresponding to the desired event class. For each requestor program 108 seeking<br>
registration, the notification manager 102 stores the ID lOSa-lOSc in a map 110, along with the<br>
corresponding notifier program ID, and a notification parameter.<br>
]	Thus, whenever a notifier program 104 alerts the notification manager 102 to an event, the<br>
notification manager 102 first accesses the map 110 to identify all requesting programs 108 that have registered concerning the alerting notifier program. Accordingly, the notification manager 102 activates the identified requesting program and sends it a message identifying the event that has occurred.<br><br>
]	In this example, the map 110 includes a listing of each "registered" requesting program 108,<br>
that is, each requesting program 108 that has submitted a request to the notification manager 102 to receive notification of an event class. In the illustrated example, the map 110 identifies registered requesting programs 108 by their thirty-two bit ID. For each registration, the map 110 lists the notifier program 104 corresponding to the event class of that registration. In the illustrated example, the map 110 names each notifier program 104 by its thirty-two bit ID.<br>
For each registered requestor program 108, the map 110 further lists a notification parameter. As explained in greater detail below, the notification parameters specify which events of the notifier program's class that the caller wishes to receive. In the illustrated example, each notifier program's event class includes three different events. These events may be represented by three corresponding bits. Additionally, one or more conditions may be represented by the notification parameter. In this example, there is a "stay resident" condition, explained below, yielding a total of four bits. Thus, a<br><br>
notification parameter may be represented by a four-bit binary number (0000 through 1111). Of course, ordinarily skilled artisans (having the benefit of this disclosure) will recognize that a greater number of events and conditions may be represented by using a longer notification parameter and/or a different scheme of digitally representing these items.<br>
Dictionary<br>
In the illustrated example, without any intended limitation, the meaning of the notification parameters is contained in a diction any 112. TABLE 2 (below) provides an example of the dictionary 112 contents.<br><br>
In this example, each notification parameter comprises a different four-bit number, which corresponds to a predefined combination of desired events and the "stay resident" condition. The use of notification parameters is discussed in greater detail below.<br><br>
Exemplary Digital Data Processing Apparatus<br>
As mentioned above, the notification manager 102, requestor programs 108, and notifier programs 104 may be implemented in various forms. As one example, the these components may be implemented by digital data processing apparatuses, by a conmnon digital data processing apparatus, or a variation thereof. For ease of illustration, the following example describes a single processing apparatus implementing all of the components 102, 108, 104. Namely, FIGURE 2 illustrates the hardware components and interconnections of the digital data processing apparatus 200.<br>
The apparatus 200 includes a processor 202, such as a microprocessor or other processing<br>
machine, coupled to a storage 204. In the present example, the storage 204 includes a fast-access<br>
storage 206, as well as nonvolatile storage 208. The fast-access storage 206 may comprise random<br>
access memory ("RAM"), and may be used to store the programming instructions executed by the<br>
processor 202. The nonvolatile storage 208 may comprise, for example, one or more magnetic data<br>
storage disks such as a "hard drive", a tape drive, or any other suitable storage device. The apparatus<br>
200 also includes an input/output 210, such as a line, bus, cable, electromagnetic link, or other means<br>
for the processor 202 to exchange data with other hardware external to the apparatus 200.<br>
I	Despite the specific foregoing description, ordinarily skilled artisans (having the benefit of<br>
this disclosure) will recognize that the apparatus discussed above may be implemented in a machine of different construction, without departing from the scope of the invention. As a specific example, one of the components 206,208 may be eliminated; furthermore, the storage 204 may be provided on-board the processor 202, or even provided externally to the apparatus 200.<br>
Logic Circuitry<br>
In contrast to the digital data processing apparatus discussed above, a different embodiment of the invention uses logic circuitry instead of computer-executed instructions to implement some or all of the notification manager 102, requestor programs 108, and notifier programs 104. Depending upon the particular requirements of the application in the areas of speed, expense, tooling costs, and the like, this logic may be implemented by constructing an application-specific integrated circuit ("ASIC") having thousands of tiny integrated transistors. Such an ASIC may be implemented with CMOS, TTL, VLSI, or another suitable construction. Other alternatives include a digital signal processing chip ("DSP"), discrete circuitry (such as resistors, capacitors, diodes, inductors, and transistors), field programmable gate array ("FPGA"), programmable logic array ("PLA"), and the like.<br><br>
Exemplary Application<br>
Although the system 100 may be implemented in a variety of different application contexts, one illustrative application is a wireless telephone. Some illustrative events 106 include ringing of the telephone, connection of the telephone to a network, receipt of short message service (SMS) data. An exemplary notifier programs 104 include a telephony application program interface (TAPI). In this application, the notification manager 102 is provided by a microprocessor, the map 110 is present in changeable memory such as battery-backed RAM, and the dictionary 112 is present in read only memory such as EPROM or other storage amenable to flash upgrade.<br>
OPERATION<br>
Having described the structural features of the present invention, the method aspect of the present invention will now be described. As mentioned above, the method aspect of the invention generally involves event detection and alert systems implemented in computer software, one embodiment of which is an extensible event notification system that detects certain events, and notifies requestor programs that have registered for such notification.<br>
Signal-Bearing Media<br>
In the context of FIGURE 1, such a method may be implemented, for example, by operating the notification manager 102, as embodied by a digital data processing apparatus 200, to execute a sequence of machine-readable instructions. These instructions may reside in various types of signal-bearing media. In this respect, one aspect of the present invention concerns signal-bearing media embodying a program of machine-readable instructions executable by a digital data processor to react to certain predefined events by notifying requestor programs that have registered for such notification.<br>
This signal-bearing media may comprise, for example, RAM (not shown) contained within the notification manager 102, as represented by the fast-access storage 206. Alternatively, the instructions may be contained in another signal-bearing media, such as a magnetic data storage diskette 300 (FIGURE 3), directly or indirectly accessible by the processor 202. Whether contained in the storage 206, diskette 300, or elsewhere, the instructions may be stored on a variety of machine-readable data storage media. Some examples include as direct access storage (e.g., a conventional "hard drive", redundant array of inexpensive disks ("RAID"), or another direct access storage device ("DASD")), serial-access storage such as magnetic or optical tape, electronic read-only memory (e.g..<br><br>
ROM, EPROM, orEEPROM), optical storage (e.g., CD-ROM, WORM, DVD, digital optical tape), paper "punch" cards, or other suitable signal-bearing media including analog or digital transmission media and analog and communication links and wireless. In an illustrative embodiment of the invention, the machine-readable instructions may comprise software object code, compiled from a language such as "C," etc.<br>
Logic Circuitry<br>
In contrast to the signal-bearing medium discussed above, the method aspect of the invention may be implemented using logic circuitry, without using a processor to execute instructions. In this embodiment, the logic circuitry may be used to implement some or all of the requestor programs 108, notifier programs 104, and notification manager 102, to carry out the operations of the invention. The' logic circuitry may be implemented using many different types of circuitry, as discussed above.<br>
Overall Sequence of Operation<br>
FIGURE 4 shows a sequence 400 to illustrate an example of an operating sequence for an extensible event notification system. Broadly, this sequence serves to detect certain events and notify requestor programs 108 that have registered for such notification. For ease of explanation, but without any intended limitation, the example of FIGURE 4 is described in the context of the system 100 described above.<br>
In step 401, IDs 108a-108c are assigned to the requestor programs 108 and IDs 104a-104c are assigned to the notifier programs 104. This step may be performed by a human designer of the system 100. by the notification manager 102, or another suitable component. The IDs may be stored with the respective programs 104, lOS as shown, or stored in another location accessible to^the programs 104, 108.<br>
In step 402, one or more requestor programs 108 register to receive notification of certain events. In each case, registration involves a registration program 108 submitting a registration request to the notification manager 102. A registration request includes (1) an identification of the requestor program 108, such as the requestor program's ID 10Sa-108d, and (2) the ID 104a-104c or other identification of the notifier program 104 that corresponds to the class that includes the event(s) for which notification is desired. Optionally, the request may include a notification parameter, such as explained above in conjunction with TABLE 2. Alternatively, the requestor programs 108 may use a different representation of events and conditions, where the notification parameters are only<br><br>
used internally by the notification manager 102; in this event, the notification manager 102 translates the requestor programs's notification preferences into the representative notification parameter using the dictionary 112 during the registration process (step 402). TABLE 3, below, shows the contents of an exemplary registration request.<br><br>
Although not separately shown for ease of description, the requestor programs 108 may initially register, and/or repeat registration, later in the sequence 400 as suits the operating requirements of those registration programs lOS. Furthermore, in a different embodiment, registration may be performed by a different entity on behalf of a requestor program lOS. Such an entity may be a different program (e.g., registration coordinator), a human programmer, etc.<br>
Responsive to the registration request of step 402, the notification manager 102 processes diat request by storing the contents of the request in the map 110. In the illustrated example, the notification manager 102 stores the requestor-ID, notifier-ID, and notification parameter of the current registration request. After step 402, the notification manager 102 activates the notifier program 104 involved in the current registration request. This may be performed, for example, by loading the notifier program 104 into memory. Now active, this notifier program 104 operates to sense the events of its class (step 406). When the notifier program 104 senses any events within its class, it alerts the notification manager 102 (step 408). This may be performed, for example, by passing a message to the notification manager 102, causing a hardware interrupt, setting a local flag detectable by the notification manager 102, and responding to polling of the notification manager 102.<br>
In response, the notification manager 102 consults the map 110 to identify all requestor programs 108 that have submitted registration requests concerning the alerting notifier program (step 410). Also in step 410, the manager 102 then proceeds to activate the identified requestor programs, such as by loading them into memory, and also passes the activated requestor programs an indication of the event that has occurred.<br><br>
In step 412, the notification manager 102 monitors the activated requestor program and, when the requestor program becomes inactive, the notification manager 102 deactivates it, by unloading it from memory, terminating, or otherwise ending the program. If the requestor program is registered with notification parameters that include a "stay resident" condition, the notification manager 102 aborts the deactivation of the requestor program, thus permitting the program to continue running.<br>
