				<td>HETEROPOLYCYCUC COMPOUNDS AMD THEIR USE AS MATABOTROPIC GLUTAMATE RECEPTOR ANTAGONIST<br>
FIELD OF THE ftTONTION<br>
The invention provides compounds active at metabotropic ghttunaee receptors and that are useful for treating neurological and psychiatric diseases and disorders.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Recent advances in the elucidation of the neurophysiologicai roles of metabotropic glutamate receptors have established these receptors as promising drug targets in the therapy of acute and chronic neurological and psychiatric disorders and diseases. However, die major challenge to the realization of this promise has been the development of metabotropic glutamate receptor subtype-selective compounds.<br>
Ghitamate is the major excitatory neurotransmitter in the m^tflmaiian central nervous system (CMS). Glutamate produces its effects on central neurons by binding to and thereby activating cell surface receptors. These receptors have been divided into two major classes, the iowxropic and metabotropic glutamate receptors, based on the structural features of the receptor proteins, the means by which the receptors transduce signals into the cell, and pharmacological profiles.<br>
Hie metabotropic gmtamate receptors (mGluRj) are G protein-coupled receptors mat activate a variety of iatraceUular second messenger systems following the binding of ghnamate. Activation of mGtuIU hi intact «nm1T&gt;*al'ftl neurons elicits one or more of the Mowing responses: activation of phospholipase C; increases in phosphouwsitide (PI) hydrolysis; intracellular calcium release; activation of phosphoiipase O; activation or inhibition of adeoyl cydase; increases or decreases in the formation of cyclic adenosme monophosphate (cAMP); activation of guanylyl cydase; increases in the formation of cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP); activation of phosphoiipase A»; increases in<br>
aiachidonk acid release; and increases or decreases in the activity of voltage- and ligand-gated ion channel*, Schcepp et al., Trends PharmacoL Set 14:13 (1993); Schoepp, Newochem. Int. 2*439 (1994); Pin et at., Neunphamacohgy 34:1 (1995).<br>
Eight distinct mGtuR subtypes, termed mGluRl through mGluRS, nave been identified by molecular cloning. See, for example, Nakanuni, Neuron /J:1031 (1994); Pin et al, Neumpfarmacotogy 34:1 (1995); Knopfel et al., J. MetL Chm, 3*1417 (1995). Further receptor diversny occurs via expression of alternatively spliced forms of certain mGluR subtypes. Pin et al., PNAS 89:10331 (1992); Minakuni et al,, BBRC ;99rll36 (1994); Joly et al,, J. Neurosd. /5:3970 (1995).<br>
Metabotropic giutamate receptor subtypes may be subdivided into three groups, Group I, Group n, and Group ni oaGIuRs, based on amino acid sequence bomology, the second messenger systems utilized by the receptors, and by their pharmacological characteristics. Nakanishi, Neuron 73:1031 (1994); Pin et ol.t Nfurapharmacology 34;l (1995); Knopfd etal., J. Med. Own, J&amp;1417 (1995).<br>
Group I mGluRs comprise mGluRl, mGluRS, and their alternatively spliced variants. The binding of agonists to these receptors results in die activation of phospholipase C and the subsequent mobilization of intracdlular calcium. Electrophysiological measurements have been used to demonstrate these effects, for example, in Xenopus oocytes that express recombiaant mGluRl receptors. See, for example. Masu etaL&gt; Nature 349:760 (1991); Pin et al., PNAS 89:10331 (1992). Similar results have been achieved with oocytes expressing recombinant mGluR5 receptors. Abe et al.t /. BiaL Otem. 267:13361 (1992); Minakami et al., BBRC 199:1136 (1994); Joly et al., J. Neurosd. /5:3970 (1995). Alternatively, agonist activation of recombinant mGluRl receptors expressed in Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells stimulates PI hydrolysis, cAMP fonnanon, and arachidooic acid release » measured by standard biochemical assays. Aramori etaL, Neuron «:737 (1992).<br>
By comparison, the activation of mGluR5 receptors, expressed in CHO cells,<br>
stimulates PI hydrolysis and subsequent intraceUular calcium transients, but no stimulation<br>
of cAMP formation or aracbidonic acul release is obsaved. Abe et al., J. BioL Qtem.<br>
267:13361 (1992). However, activation of mGluRS receptors expressed in LLC-PKi cells<br>
results in PI hydrolysis and increased cAMP formation. Joly etal.,J. Neurosd. 15:3970<br>
(1995). The agonist potency profile for Group I mGluRs is quisqualate &gt; giuamate -<br>
ibotenate amiiio(7clopentane-l,3-dicarboxylic acid (ACPD).  Quisqualate is relatively selective for. Group I receptors, as compared to Group II and Group in mGluRs, but it also is a potent activator of ionotropic AMPA receptors. Pin et aL, Neuraphamacolagy 34:1, Knopfel et aL, J. Med. Chan. 58:1417 (1995).<br>
TTie lack of subtype-specific mGluR agonists and antagonists has impeded elucidation of the physiological roles of particular mGhiRs, and the raGraR-assotiated pathophysiological processes that affect the CNS have yet to be defined. However, work with die available non-specific agonists and antagonists has yielded some general insights about the Group I xaGluRs as compared to the Group II and Group HI mGhiRs,<br>
Attempts at elucidating the physiological roles of Group I mGlaRs suggest that activation of these receptors elicits neuronal excitation. Various studies have demonstrated that ACPD can produce postsynaptic excitation upon application to ncurous in the hippocampus, cerebral cortex, cerebellum, and thalamus, as well as other brain regions. Evidence indicates that this excitation is due to direct activation of postsynaptic mGluRs, but it also has been suggested mat activation of presyoaptic mGluRs occurs, resulting is increased neurotransmitter release. Baskys, Trends fharmacol Sti. 15:92 (1992); Schoepp, Neurochem. Int. 24:439 (1994); Pin et oL
Pharmacological experiments implicate Group I mGluRs as the mediators of this excitatory mechanism. The effects of ACPD can be reproduced by low concentrations of quisqualate in the presence of iGluR antagonists. Hu et at., Brain Res. 568:339 (1991); Greene et al., Eur. J. Pharmacol. 226:719 (1992). Two phenylglyciae compounds known to activate ujGIuRl, namely (5;-3-hydroxyphenylglycine ((3J-3HPG) and <s also produce exctttticm watkics et al.r trends pharmaeol. sd. in addition the excitation can be blocked by fsj-4-arboxyphcnylglycine r5 and compounds known to mglurl antagonists. eaton al. eur. j. phamacoi wafldns pharmocol set.></s>
Metabotropic glutamate receptors have been implicated in a number of normal processes in the ma^niaiian CNS. Activation of mGhiRs has been shown to be required for induction of hippocampal long-term potentiation and cerebeilar long-term depression. Bashir et al., Noam 363:347 (1993); Bortolotto et al., Nature 36*740 (1994); Aiba « al., Cell 79:365 (1994); Aiha rt al.. Cell 79:377 (1994), A role for mGluR activation in<br>
nociception and analgesia also has been demonstrated. Meiler et at., Nftiroreport 4: 879 (1993). In addition, mGluR activation has been suggested to play a modulatory rote in a variety of other normal processes including synaptic transmission, neuroaal developmeni, apoptodc neuional death, synaptic plasticity, spatial learning, olfactory memory, central control of cardiac activity, waiting, motor control, and control of die vesabuto-ccular reflex. Generally, see Nakanishi, Neuron 13:1031 (1994); Pin et al., Neuropharmacoiogy 34:1: Knopfel ft 
Metabotropic glutamate receptors also have been suggested to play roles in a variety of pathophyjiological processes and disease states affecting the CNS. These include stroke, head trauma, anoxic and ischemic injuries, hypoglycemia, epilepsy, and neurodegeneraove diseases such as Alzheimer's disease. Schoiepp et al,, Trends PharmacoL Sd. 14:13 (1993); Cunningham ft al., Life Sd. 54:135 (1994); HoUman et at, Ann. Rev. Neurosd. 17:31 (1994); Pin et al., Neurophamacology 34:1 (1995); Knopfd etaL,J. Med. Chem. 38:1417 (1995). Much of die pathology in these conditions is thought to be due to excessive ghjamace-induced excitation of CNS neurons. Brcause Group I mGluRs appear to increase g^|am?n*-ffMt-<lifli.f neuronal excitation via postsynaptic mechanisms and enhanced presynapdc gto release their activation probably contributes to the pathology. accordingly selective antagonists of group i mglur receptors could be therapeurically beneficial specifically as neuroprotectrve agents analgesics or anticonvulsants.></lifli.f>
Preliminary snidifft assessing therapeutic potentials with toe available mGluR agonists and antagonists have yielded seemingly contradictory results. For example, it has been reported that application of ACPD onto hippocampal neurons leads to seuures and oeuroaal damage (Sacaan et al., Neurosa. Lett. 139:77 (1992); Lippartt ft al., Life Sd. 52:85 (1993). Other studies indicate, however, that ACPD inhibits epfleptiform activity, and also can exhibit neuroprotectrve properties. Taschenberger ft al,, Newntreport 3:629 (1992); Sheardown, Neuroreport 3:916 (1992); Koh et al,, Proc. NatL Acad. ScL USA 3&amp;9431 (1991); Chiainulera et al., Ear. L PharmacoL 216:335 (1992); Siliprandi etal., Eur. J. PharmacoL 219:113 (1992); Pirzi etat., J. Neurockem. 52:683 (1993).<br>
It is likely that these conflicting results are due to the lack of selectivity of ACPD, which causes activation of several different mGluR subtypes. In the studies finding neuronal damage it appears mat Group I mGluR* were activated, mereby enhancing undesirable excitatory neurotransmissiou. In the studies showing neuroprotecdve effects it<br>
appears that activation of Group II and/or Group HI mGluRs occurred, inhibiting, presynaptic glutamate release, and diminishing excitatory neutotra&amp;sxnission.<br>
This interpretation is consistent with the observation that (5&gt;4C3HPG, a Group ! mGluR antagonist and Group II mGluR agonist, protects against audiogenic seizures in DBA/2 mice, while the Group II mGluR selective agonises DCG-IV and L-CCG-I protect neurons from NMDA- and KA-iaduced toxiciry. Thomson eta/,, /. Neurochem, 62:2492 (1994); Bruno et d., Eur. /. Phamacol, 256-.IG9 (1994); Pizsd et al., J. Neurochem. 67:683 (1993).<br>
Based on die foregoing, it is clear that currently available rtiGluR agonists and antagonists have limited value, due to their lack of potency and selectivity. In addition, most currently available compounds are amino acids or amino acid derivatives that have limited bioavaiJabilities, thereby hampering in vivo studies to assess mGhiR physiology, pharmacology and their therapeutic potential. Compounds that selectively inhibit activation of metabotropic glutamate receptor Group I subtypes should be useful for treatment of neurological disorders and diseases such as senile dementia, Parkinson's disease, Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's Chorea, pain, migraine headaches, epilepsy, head trauma, anoxic and iscbcmic injuries, psychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia, depression, and anxiety, ophthalmological disorders such as various retinopathies, for example, diabetic retinopathies, glaucoma, and neurological disorders of a auditory nature such as tiniiftis, and neuropathic pain disorders, including neuropathic diseases states such as diabetic neuropathies, chemotherapy induced neuropathies, post-herpedc neuralgia, and trigeminal neuralgia.<br>
Accordingly, a need exists for potent mGluR agonists and antagonists that display a high selectivity for a mGluR subtype, particularly a Group 1 receptor subtype.<br>

Preparation of mGhiR Group I antagonists<br>
Many starting materials for preparing the compounds of the present invention are available from commercial sources, such as Aldrich Chemical Company (Milwaukee, WI). Moreover, compounds of the invention are readily prepared, from available precursors, using straightforward transformations which are well known in the art. The skilled artisan will recognize that mGluR Group I antagonists, according to the invention, can be prepared via methodology that is well known, using widely recognized techniques of organic chemistry. Suitable reactions are described in standard textbooks of organic chemistry. For example, see March, ADVANCED ORGANIC CHEMISTRY, 2d ed., McGraw Hill (1977).<br>
More specifically, compounds of the invention generally can be prepared by fonnaaon of the G moiety between two precursor compounds containing suitable Ar1 and Ar2 moieties. When the linker contains a 1,2,4-oxadiazole, the heterocycle may be formed using well known techniques, such as reaction between an amidoxime and an acid chloride, or by the reaction of an amidoxime and an acylimidazole. An illustration of such a transformation is provided in Examples 3 through 6, below.<br>
Amidoximes can be prepared using well known techniques by the reaction of an Ar1 substituted nitrile with hydroxylamine. An illustration of such a transformation is provided below in Example 1.<br>
In most cases, the precursor Ar3 acid chlorides are readily available, or may be prepared using straightforward techniques of organic chemistry. For example, carboxylic acids may be converted into the corresponding acid chlorides by reaction with, for ixample, thionyl chloride or oxalyl chloride.<br>
In the case where the linker contains a 1,3-oxazole, compounds were prepared using a. procedure similar to that given by Kelly et oL, J. Org. Chan. 61, 4623-4633 (1996). Thus. 3,5-Disubstimted-l,3-Oxazoles were prepared by mixing a haloketone widi<br>
carboxamide in refluxing toluene for 3 days. The resulting mixture was allowed to cool to room temperature, the solvent was removed and the residue was purified.<br>
Testing of compounds for mGluR Group I antagonist activity<br>
The pharmacological properties of the compounds of the invention can be analyzed using standard assays for functional activity. Examples of glutamate receptor assays are well known in the art, for example, see Aramori ft al.t Neuron 8:757 (1992); Tanabe et al., Neuron 8:169 (1992); Miller et al., J. Neurosdence 15: 6103 (1995); Balazs, efal., J, Neurochematry 69:151 (1997). The methodology described in those publications is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Conveniently, the compounds of the invention can be studied by means of an assay that measures the mobilization intracellular calcium, [Ca**]i in cells expressing mGhiK5 that can bind the compounds. A well-known cell line which is suitable for this purpose is described in Miller et al.. J. Neurosdence 15: 6103 (1995), the contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference. It has been shown that exposure of rat astrocytes to the growth factors basic fibrobkst growth factor, EOF, or transforming growth factor-a markedly increased die protein expression and functional activity of endogenous mGluRS (Miller et at., J. Neurosdence, 15(9): 6103-6109, 1995).<br>
In brief, primary astrocytc cultures were prepared from 3-5 day old Sprague-Dawley rat pups using a modification of Miller et al. and were plated on poly-L lysine coated flasks in Dulbccco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing fetal calf serum (PCS). For cuvette analysis, cultures were up-regulated with growth factors in flasks for 3-5 days, then harvested and prepared for measurement of [Ca'*Ji mobilization as previously described (Nemetfa et al, 1998).<br>
For fluorescent Imaging plate reader (FLJPR) analysis, cells were seeded on poly-D lysine coated dear bottom 96-well plates with black sides and analysis of [CaJ*J« mobilization was performed 3 days following the growth factor up-reguladon.<br>
FUPR experiments were carried out using a laser setting of 0.800 W and a 0.4 second CCD camera shutter speed. Each FUPR experiment was initiated with 180 jiL of buffer present in each well of the ceil plate. After each addition of compound, me luorescence signal was sampled 50 times at 1 second intervals followed by 3 samples at 5 second intervals. Responses were measured as the peak height of the response within the sample period.<br>
EC* and IC» detenninations were made from data obtained from 8 point-concentration response curves (CRQ performed in duplicate. Agonist CRC were generated by scaling all responses to the maximal response observed for the plate. Antagonist block of the agonist challenge was normalized to the average response of the agonist challenge in 14 control wells on the same plate. A detailed protocol for testing the compounds of me invention is provided below at Example 4.<br>

Astrocyte Screening Assay<br>
Primary astrocyte cultures were prepared from 3-5 day old Spngue-Dawiey rat pups using a modification of Miller (Miller ft al, J. Neuroscience, 15(9): 6103-6109, 1995). In brief, primary cultures were plated on poly-L lysine coated flasks in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (DMEM) containing fetal calf serum (PCS). After 6 days, cell cultures were shaken over night at 280 rpm, then transferred to astrocyte-defiacd media (ADM) containing growth factors that up-regulate the expression of mGluR5 (Miller et al., 1995). For cuvette analysis, cultures were up-regulated with growth factors in flasks for 3-5 days, then harvested and prepared for measurement of [Ca**]i mobilization as previously described (Nemeth et al., 1998).<br>
For FLEPR analysis, cells were seeded on poly-D lysine coated clear bottom 96-well plates with black sides and analysis of [Ca?*]i mobilization was performed 3 days following the growth factor up-regulatkm. Cell cultures in the 96-well plates were loaded with a 4 nM solution of acetoxymemyl ester form of the fluorescent calcium indicator fluo-3 (Molecular Probes, Eugene, Oregon) in 0.01 % pluronic. All assays were performed in a buffer rontaming 127 mM NaCl, 5 mM KC1, 2 mM MgCfa, 0.7 mM NaHiP(X 2 mM CaCla, 0.422 mg/ml NaHCOs, 2.4 mg/ml HEPES, 1.8 mg/ml glucose and 1 mg/ml BSA Fraction IV (pH 7.4).<br>
FUPR experiments were done using a laser setting of 0.800 W and a 0.4 second CCD camera shutter speed. Each FLEPR experiment was initiated with 180 nL of buffer present in each well of the cell plate. A 20 uL addition from the antagonist plate was<br>
followed by a 50 nL addition from the agonist plate. After each addition the fluorescence signal was sampled 50 times at 1 second intervals followed by 3 samples at 5 second intervals. Responses were measured as the peak height of the response within the sample period.<br>
ECjo/ICw determinations were made from data obtained from 8 point concentration response carves (CRC) performed in duplicate. Agonist CRC were generated by scaling all responses to die maximal response observed for the plaie. Antagonist block of the agonist challenge was normalised to the average response of the agonist challenge in 14 control wells on the same plate.<br>
CaR/mGiuR5d Screening Assay<br>
HEK 293 cells expressing the chimeric CaR/mGIuR5d receptor (clonal cell line hCaR/hmGluRSd^heko) are plated 24 hours prior to assay at a density of 100,000 cells per well in Collagen I-coated 96-well black, clear bottom plates (Becton Dickenson) m DMEM supplemented with 10% FBS (Hyclone).<br>
On the day of the assay, tissue culture medium is aspirated from the wells of a plate and 80 uL of Assay Buffer (Assay Buffer is: 20 mM HEPES, 146 mM Nad, 5 mM KCI, 1 mM MjCb, 1 mM CaCb, 1 mg/ml BSA, 1 mg/ml glucose, pH 7.4) supplemented with 6 jiM of the Ca^-sensitive dye, Fluo-3 AM (Molecular Probes) and 0.025% Pluronic (Molecular Probes) is added to each well. The plate is then incubated in the dark for 1 hour at room temperature to efficiently load the cells with Fluo-3. At the end of the incubation, extracellular Fluo-3 is removed by washing the plate with Assay buffer. Assay Buffer is added back to each well (final volume * 160 nL) prior to beginning the assay.<br>
The place is loaded into a FUPR robotic device (Molecular Devices) with the laser setting at 0.8 Watts. At a time of 10 seconds after initiation of the assay, 40 pL of Assay Buffer containing 62.5 uM test substance and 2% DMSO is added to the 160 fiL of Assay Buffer in each well of the plate to yield a final concentration of 12 pM test substance and 0.4% DMSO. At a time of 75 seconds after initiation of the assay, 50 fiL of Assay Buffer containing 6 mM CaCh is added to the 200 \iL present in each well to yield a final Ca2* concentration of 2.0 mM, and a final concentration of test substance of 10 nM. Relative fluorescence intensity (excitation X = 488 am / emission X —510 nM) Is monitored at<br>
relevant time intervals throughout the assay period to measure receptor activation and/or. inhibition.<br>
