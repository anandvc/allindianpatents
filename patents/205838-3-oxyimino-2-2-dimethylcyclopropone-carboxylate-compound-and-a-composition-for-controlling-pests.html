EXAMPLES<br>
The present invention is illustrated with reference to the following production example, formulation examples and test examples, which should not be construed as limiting the scope of the invention.<br>
Firstly, production of the present compound is exemplified.  In the production examples, the numbers of the present compounds are those shown in Tables 1 to 16 below.<br>
Production Example 1<br>
2.06 Grams of (1R)-trans-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl}cyclopropanecarboxylic acid chloride was added to a mixture of 1.78 g of (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methylphenyl)methanol, 0.87 g of pyridine and 20 ml of tetrahydrofuran under ice-cooling.  The resulting mixture was stirred at room temperature for 8 hours.  The reaction mixture was poured into about 100 ml of ice water and extracted twice with 100 ml of ethyl acetate.  The combined ethyl acetate layer was washed with a saturated aqueous sodium chloride solution, dried<br><br>
- 28 -<br>
over anhydrous sodium sulfate and then concentrated under reduced pressure.  The residue was purified by a silica gel column chromatography (eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate = 20/1) to obtain 2.75 g (yield: 87%) of (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methylphenyl)methyl (1R)-trans-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl)cyclopropane-carboxylate.<br>
A mixture of 1.27 g of (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methylphenyl)methyl (1R)-trans-2,2-dimethyl-3-(2-methyl-l-propenyl) cyclopropanecarboxylate, 20 ml of methanol and 20 ml of ethyl acetate was cooled to -78°C.  Oxygen-containing ozone was bubbled into the mixture while stirring until the reaction mixture was colored blue. Then, nitrogen gas was bubbled into the blue reaction mixture to remove the excess ozone.  Thereafter, 5 ml of dimethyl sulfide was added thereto.  The resulting mixture was heated to room temperature.  The reaction mixture, after having been allowed to stand for one day, was concentrated under reduced pressure.  20 Milliliters of acetone, 2 ml of water and 0.2 g of p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate were added to the resultant residue. The resulting reaction mixture, after having been allowed to stand at room temperature for 2 hours, was poured into water and extracted with diethyl ether.  The organic layer was dried over anhydrous sodium sulfate and then concentrated under reduced pressure.  The resultant residue was purified by a silica gel column chromatography (eluent: hexane/ethyl acetate - 10/1) to<br><br>
obtain 0.98 g (yield: 82%) of (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methylphenyl)methyl (1R)-trans-3-formyl-2,2-dimethyl-cyclopropanecarboxylate, m.p. 43.2°C.<br>
A mixture of 0.32 g of O-methylhydroxylamine hydrochloride, 0.16 g of sodium hydroxide and 10 ml of methanol was stirred for 1 hour.  To the stirred mixture, a solution of 0.56 g of (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4-methyiphenyl)methyl (1R)-trans-3-formyl-2,2-dimethyl™ cyclopropanecarboxylate in 3 ml of methanol was added. After 12 hours of stirring, water was added to the reaction mixture, which was then extracted with diethyl ether.  The organic layer was dried over sodium sulfate and then concentrated under reduced pressure.  The resultant residue was purified by a silica gel column chromatography using a 10 : 1 mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate as an eluent, to obtain 0.28 g {yield: 46%) of {2,3, 5,6-tetrafluoro-4~methylphenyl)methyl (1R)-trans-3™{(E)-methoxyiminomethyl)-2f2-dimethylcyclo-propanecarboxylate (present compound 11).  The chromatography was continued while replacing the eluent with a 4:1 mixture of hexane and ethyl acetate, to obtain 0.23 g (yield: 38%) of (2,3,5,6-tetrafluoro-4~ methylphenyl)methyl (1R)-trans-3-((Z)-methoxyiminomethyl )-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate (present compound 36).<br>

The resultant residue was subjected to a silica gel column chromatography (eluent; hexane/ethyl acetate = 3/1). The obtained fraction was subjected again to a silica gel column chromatography (eluent; hexane/ethyl acetate = 10/1) to obtain 0.53 g (yield: 42%) of (2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl)methyl (1R)-trans-3-((E)-methoxy-iminomethyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate (present compound 9) followed by 0.47 g (yield: 37%) of (2,3,5,6-tetrafluorophenyl)methyl (1R)-trans-3-((Z)-methoxyiminomethyl)-2,2-dimethylcyclopropanecarboxylate (present compound 34).<br>
