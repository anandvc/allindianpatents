				<td>PROCESS FOR THE PREPARATION OF SULFUR-CONTAINING ORGANOSILICON<br>
COMPOUNDS<br>
[0001] This invention relates to a process for the production of sulfur containing<br>
organosilicon compounds by phase transfer catalysis techniques. The process involves first<br>
reacting an alkali metal hydroxide compound with a sulfide compound and sulfur in water to<br>
form a polysulfide mixture. The polysulfide mixture is then reacted with a silane compound<br>
in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst<br>
[0002] Sulfur containing organosilicon compounds are useful as reactive coupling agents in<br>
a variety of commercial applications. In particular, sulfur containing organosilicon<br>
compounds have become essential components in the production of tires based on rubber<br>
vulcanates containing silica. The sulfur containing organosilicon compounds improve the<br>
physical properties of the rubber vulcanates containing silica resulting in automotive tires<br>
with improved abrasion resistance, rolling resistance, and wet skidding performance. The<br>
sulfur containing organosilicon compounds can be added directly to the rubber vulcanates<br>
containing silica, or alternately, can be used to pre-treat the silica prior to addition to the<br>
rubber vulcanate composition.<br>
[0003] Numerous methods have been described in the art for the preparation of sulfur<br>
containing organosilicon compounds. For example, U.S. 5,399,739 by French et al. describes<br>
a method for making sulfur-containing organosilanes by reacting an alkali metal alcoholate<br>
with hydrogen sulfide to form an alkali metal hydrosulfide, which is subsequently reacted<br>
with an alkali metal to provide an alkali metal sulfide. The resulting alkali metal sulfide is<br>
then reacted with sulfur to provide an alkali metal polysulfide which is then finally reacted<br>
with a silane compound of the formula X-R2-Si(R1)3, where X is either chlorine or<br>
bromine to produce the sulfur-containing organosilane.<br>
[0004] U.S. Patent Nos. 5,466,848, 5,596,116, and 5,489,701 describe processes for the<br>
preparation of silane polysulfides. The "848 patent process is based on first producing<br>
sodium sulfide by the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with sodium ethoxylate. The sodium<br>
sulfide is then reacted with sulfur to form the tetrasulfide, which is subsequently reacted with<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane to form 3, 3"-bis (triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide. The "116<br>
patent teaches a process for the preparation of polysulfides, without the use of hydrogen<br>
sulfide, by reacting a metal alkoxide in alcohol with elemental sulfur, or by reacting sodium<br>
metal with elemental sulfur and an alcohol, with a halohydrocarbylalkoxysilane such as<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane. The "701 patent claims a process for the preparation of silane<br>
polysulfides by contacting hydrogen sulfide gas with an active metal alkoxide solution and<br>
subsequently reacting the reaction product with a halohydrocarbylalkoxysilane such as<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane.<br>
[0005] U.S. Patent No. 5,892,085 describes a process for the preparation of high purity<br>
organosilicon disulphanes. U.S. Patent No. 5,859,275 describes a process for the production<br>
of bis (silylorganyl) polysulphanes. Both the "085 and "275 patents describe anhydrous<br>
techniques involving the direct reaction of a haloalkoxysilane with a polysulphide.<br>
[0006] U.S. Pat. No. 6,066,752 teaches a process for producing sulfur-containing<br>
organosilicon compounds by reacting sulfur, an alkali metal, and a halogenalkoyxsilane in the<br>
absence of a solvent or in the presence of an aprotic solvent.<br>
[0007] Most recently, U.S. Pat. No. 6,140,524 describes a method for preparing short chain<br>
polysulfide silane mixtures of the formula (RO)3SiC3H6SnC3H6Si(RO)3 having a distribution<br>
where n falls in the range of 2.2 = n = 2.8. The "524 method reacts metal polysulfides,<br>
typically Na2Sn with a halogenopropyltrialkoxysilane having the formula<br>
(RO)3SiC3H6X wherein X is a halogen, in alcohol solvent.<br>
[0008] Alternative processes for the preparation of sulfur-containing organosilanes have<br>
been taught in the art based on the use of phase transfer catalysis techniques. Phase transfer<br>
catalysis techniques overcome many of the practical problems associated with the<br>
aforementioned prior art processes for producing sulfur-containing organosilicon compounds.<br>
Many of these problems are related to the use of solvents. In particular, the use of ethyl<br>
alcohol can be problematic because of its low flash point. Additionally, it is difficult to<br>
obtain and maintain anhydrous conditions necessary in many of the aforementioned prior art<br>
processes on an industrial scale.<br>
[0009] Phase transfer catalysis techniques for producing sulfur-containing organosilicon<br>
compounds are taught for example in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,405,985, 5,663,396, 5,468,893, and<br>
5,583,245. While these patents teach new processes for the preparation of sulfur containing<br>
organosilicon compounds using phase transfer catalysis, there still exist many practical<br>
problems with the use of phase transfer techniques at an industrial scale. For example, there<br>
is a need to control the reactivity of the phase transfer catalyst in the preparation of sulfur-<br>
containing organosilanes so as to provide efficient, yet safe reactions that can be performed<br>
on an industrial scale. Furthermore, there is a need to improve the final product stability,<br>
appearance and purity. In particular, the phase transfer catalysis process of the prior art<br>
results in final product compositions containing high quantities of un-reacted sulfur species.<br>
These un-reacted sulfur species can precipitate in stored products with time causing changes<br>
in product sulfide distribution.<br>
[0010] The need to improve product quality is of particular importance when an alkali<br>
metal or ammonium hydrogen sulfide is used as a starting material in phase transfer catalysis<br>
techniques. In these reactions, dangerous and odorous hydrogen sulfide is produced in side<br>
reactions. Product compositions containing even minor amounts of hydrogen sulfide deter<br>
their use in large-scale industrial processes.<br>
[0011] It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide an improved process for<br>
the production of sulfur containing organosilicon compounds based on phase transfer<br>
catalysis techniques.<br>
[0012] It is a further object of the present invention to provide a process for producing<br>
sulfur containing organosilicon compounds based on phase transfer catalysis techniques that<br>
result in a final product composition of greater stability, purity, and appearance.<br>
[0013] It is yet a further object of the present invention to provide a process for producing<br>
sulfur containing organosilicon compounds based on phase transfer techniques using a sulfide<br>
compound that minimizes or eliminates hydrogen sulfide as a side product.<br>
[0014] It is still a further object of the present invention that provides a process for<br>
producing sulfur containing organosilicon compounds based on phase transfer techniques<br>
using starting materials that are less costly that conventional prior art methods and minimizes<br>
un-reacted side products.<br>
[0015] The present invention provides a process for the production of sulfur containing<br>
organosilicon compounds by phase transfer catalysis techniques. The improvement of the<br>
present invention is characterized by reacting an alkali metal hydroxide compound with a<br>
sulfide compound and sulfur in water to form a polysulfide mixture, which is then reacted<br>
with a silane compound in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst.<br>
[0016] The present invention is a process for the production of organosilicon compounds of<br>
the formula:<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m<br>
where R is independently a monovalent hydrocarbon of 1 to 12 carbon<br>
atoms; Alk is a divalent hydrocarbon of 1 to 18 carbon atoms;<br>
m is an integer of 0 to 2, n is a number from 1 to 10;<br>
comprising:<br>
(A) reacting an alkali metal hydroxide compound, a sulfide compound having the<br>
formula M2Sn or MHS,<br>
where H is hydrogen, M is ammonium or an alkali metal,<br>
n is as defined above,<br>
and sulfur in water to form a polysulfide mixture,<br>
(B) reacting said polysulfide mixture with a silane compound of the formula;<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X<br>
where X is Cl, Br or I, and m is the same as above,<br>
in the presence of a phase transfer catalyst.<br>
[0017] Examples of sulfur containing organosilicon compounds which may be prepared in<br>
accordance with the present invention are described in U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,405,985, 5,663,396,<br>
5,468,893, and 5,583,245, which are hereby incorporated by reference. The preferred sulfur<br>
containing organosilicon compounds which are prepared in accordance with the present<br>
invention are the 3,3"-bis(trialkoxysilylpropyl) polysulfides. The most preferred compounds<br>
are 3,3"-bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) disulfide and 3,3"-bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide.<br>
[0018] The first step of the present invention involves the formation of a polysulfide<br>
mixture by reacting an alkali metal hydroxide compound, a sulfide compound and sulfur in<br>
water.<br>
[0019] The alkali metal hydroxide compounds that can be used in the present invention are<br>
the hydroxide compounds of the Group I alkali metals, such as lithium hydroxide, sodium<br>
hydroxide, potassium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide, and cesium hydroxide. The preferred<br>
metal hydroxide compound is sodium hydroxide.<br>
[0020] Sulfide compounds of the formula M2Sn or MHS are used in the reaction step (A)<br>
of the process of the present invention, where M represents an alkali metal or ammonium<br>
group and H represents hydrogen. Representative alkali metals include lithium, potassium,<br>
sodium, rubidium, or cesium. Preferably M is sodium. Examples of the MHS compound<br>
include NaHS, KHS, and NH4HS. When the sulfide compound is an MHS compound,<br>
NaHS is preferred. Specific examples of the NaHS compound include NaHS flakes<br>
(containing 71.5 - 74.5% NaHS) and NaHS liquors (containing 45 - 60 % NaHS) from PPG<br>
of Pittsburgh, PA. Specific examples of compounds of M2Sn include Na2S, K2S, CS2S,<br>
(NH4)2S, Na2S2,Na2S3, Na2S4, Na2S6, K2S2 K2S3&gt;K2S4, K2S6, and (NII4)2S2. Preferably the<br>
sulfide compound is Na2S. A particular preferred sulfide compound is sodium sulfide flakes<br>
(containing 60 - 63% Na2S) from PPG of Pittsburgh, PA.<br>
[0021] The sulfur used in the first step of the present invention is elemental sulfur. The<br>
type and form are not critical and can include those commonly used. An example of a<br>
suitable sulfur material is 100 mesh refined sulfur powder from Aldrich, Milwaukee WI.<br>
[0022] The amount of alkali metal hydroxide compound, alkali metal hydrogen sulfide<br>
compound and sulfur used in the process of the present invention can vary. Preferably the<br>
molar ratio of S/HS ranges from 0.1 to 10. The molar ratio of S/HS~ compound can be used<br>
to affect the final product distribution, that is the average value of n in the formula, (RO)3_<br>
mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3_m. When the average value of n is desired to be 4 in the<br>
product formula, (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m, the preferred range for the molar<br>
ratio of S/HS" compound is from 2.7 to 3.2. When the average value of n is desired to be 2 in<br>
the product formula,<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m, the preferred range for the ratio of sulfur/sulfide<br>
compound is from 0.8 to 1.2.<br>
[0023] The amount of alkali metal hydroxide added to step (A) of the process of the present<br>
invention can be from 0.1 to 10 based on the molar ratio of the amount of sulfide compound<br>
used. Preferably the molar ratio of alkali metal hydroxide to sulfide compound is from 0.8 to<br>
1.2, and most preferably from 0.95 to 1.05.<br>
[0024] The amount of water used in step (A) of the present invention can vary. Generally,<br>
a sufficient amount of water is added to prevent precipitation of dialkali metal sulfides that<br>
are formed in the reaction of step (A). Optional ingredients can also be added to the water to<br>
enhance the reaction. For example, sodium chloride or other brine salts can be added.<br>
[0025] The reaction step (A) involves mixing an alkali metal hydroxide compound, an<br>
alkali metal hydrogen sulfide compound, sulfur and water together in a reaction vessel. The<br>
reaction step (A) can be conducted at a variety of temperatures, but generally in the range of<br>
20 to 100°C. Preferably, the reaction is conducted at a temperature ranging from 50 to 90°C.<br>
Generally, the first step can be conducted at various pressures, but preferably the first step<br>
reaction is conducted at atmospheric pressure. The time needed for the reaction of the first<br>
step to occur is not critical, but generally ranges from 5 to 30 minutes.<br>
[0026] The second step of the process of the present invention involves reacting the<br>
polysulfide mixture with a silane compound of the formula;<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X<br>
R can independently be any hydrocarbon group containing 1 to 12 carbon atoms. Thus,<br>
examples of R include methyl, ethyl, propyl, butyl, isobutyl, cyclohexyl, or phenyl.<br>
Preferably, R is a methyl or ethyl group. In the formula (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X, m is an integer<br>
and can have a value from 0 to 2. Preferably, m is equal to 0. Alk is a divalent hydrocarbon<br>
group containing 1 to 18 carbons. Alk can be for example; ethylene, propylene, butylene, or<br>
isobutylene. Preferably Alk contains 2 to 4 carbons, and most preferably, Alk is a propylene<br>
group. X is a halogen atom selected from chlorine, bromine, or iodine. Preferably X is<br>
chlorine. Examples of silane compounds that may be used in the present invention include<br>
chloropropyl triethoxy silane, chloropropyl trimethoxy silane, chloroethyl triethoxy silane,<br>
chlorobutyl triethoxy silane, chloroisobutylmethyl diethoxy silane, chloroisobutylmethyl<br>
dimethoxy silane, chloropropyldimethyl ethoxy silane. Preferably, the silane compound of<br>
the present invention is chloropropyl triethoxy silane (CPTES).<br>
[0027] The silane compound, (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X, can be reacted directly with the<br>
polysulfide mixture as described above, or alternatively, the silane compound can be<br>
dispersed in an organic solvent to form an organic phase. Representative examples of<br>
organic solvents include toluene, xylene, benzene, heptane, octane, decane, chlorobenzene<br>
and the like. When an organic solvent is used, the preferred organic solvent is toluene.<br>
[0028] When conducting the reaction in step (B) of the present invention, preferably the<br>
silane compound is reacted directly with polysulfide mixture as described above.<br>
[0029] The amount of the silane compound (RO)3_mRmSi-Alk-X used in the process of the<br>
present invention can vary. An example of a suitable range includes from 1/10 to 10/1 based<br>
on the molar amount of alkali metal hydrogen sulfide compound used. When the average<br>
value of n is desired to be 4 in the product formula, (RO)3.mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3.m,<br>
the silane compound (RO)3mRmSi-Alk-X is generally used from 2.0 to 2.10 in molar excess<br>
of the alkali metal hydrogen sulfide compound, with a range of 2.01 to 2.06 being the most<br>
preferable. When the average value of n is desired to be 2 in the product formula, (RO)3.<br>
mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m, the silane compound (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X is preferably used<br>
from 1.8 to 2.1 in molar excess of the alkali metal hydrogen sulfide compound, with a range<br>
of 1.9 to 2.0 being the most preferable.<br>
[0030] The phase transfer catalysts operable in the present invention are the quaternary<br>
onium cations. Preferred examples of the quaternary onium cations as phase transfer<br>
catalysts are described in US 5,405,985, which is hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
Preferably, the quaternary onium cation is tetrabutyl ammonium bromide or tetrabutyl<br>
ammonium chloride. The most preferred quaternary onium salt is tetrabutyl ammonium<br>
bromide. A particularly preferred quaternary onium salt is tetrabutyl ammonium bromide<br>
(99%) from Aldrich Chemical of Milwaukee, WI.<br>
[0031] The amount of the phase transfer catalyst used in the process may vary. Preferably<br>
the amount of phase transfer catalyst is from 0.1 to 10 weight %, and most preferably from<br>
0.5 to 2 weight % based on the amount of silane compound used.<br>
[0032] The phase transfer catalyst may be added to the reaction at any time. Preferably, the<br>
phase transfer catalyst is added to the polysulfide mixture prior to step (B), reaction with the<br>
silane compound.<br>
[0033] When conducting step (B) of the present invention, preferably the silane compound<br>
is added to the polysulfide mixture at such a rate so as to maintain a constant reaction<br>
temperature. The reaction of step (B) of the present invention can be conducted at a variety<br>
of temperatures, but generally is conducted in the range of 40 - 100°C. Preferably, the<br>
reaction is conducted at a temperature ranging from 65 - 95°C. Generally, the second step<br>
can be conducted at a various pressures, but preferably the second step reaction is conducted<br>
at atmospheric pressure. The time needed for the reaction of the second step to occur is not<br>
critical, but generally ranges from 5 minutes to 6 hours.<br>
[0034] The reaction steps of the present invention can also be conducted in the presence of<br>
an aqueous phase containing a buffer. The buffer can be a single compound such as an alkali<br>
metal salt of a phosphate, a hydrogen phosphate, a dihydrogen phosphate, a carbonate, a<br>
hydrogen carbonate, or a borate, or combinations thereof. Examples of buffers include;<br>
Na3PO4, Na2HPO4, NaH2PO4 , Na2CO3, NaHCO3, and NaB4O7. Preferably, the buffer is<br>
selected from Na3PO4, Na2CO3&gt; or K2CO3<br>
[0035] The amount of the buffer added to the aqueous phase can vary, but generally is<br>
added in molar amounts equal to or greater than the number of moles of M2Sn or MHS.<br>
Although not to be limited to any theory, the present inventors believe the addition of a buffer<br>
to the aqueous phase in the process to prepare sulfur containing organosilicon compounds<br>
using phase transfer catalysis helps to control the pH of the reaction medium, thereby<br>
affecting product formation and minimizing side reactions, such as the production of<br>
hydrogen sulfide. Thus, one embodiment of the present invention provides sulfur containing<br>
organosilicon compounds produced in the reaction described above by controlling the pH.<br>
The pH of the aqueous phase used in the reaction of the present invention can be controlled<br>
by the addition of a buffer, as described above, or alternatively, by the addition of any acidic<br>
or basic compounds at such a rate and concentration so as to maintain a pH during the<br>
reaction in the range of 7 to 14. The present inventors have also found that pH can have an<br>
influence on the product distribution, that is, the value of n in the product formula<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m. When the average value of n is desired to be 2 in<br>
the product formula, (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m, the preferred pH range is from 8<br>
to 10. When the average value of n is desired to be 4 in the product formula,<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-Sn-Alk-SiRm(OR)3-m, the preferred pH range is from 11 to 14.<br>
[0036] In a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the alkali metal hydroxide, the<br>
sulfide compound, the phase transfer catalyst, water, and sulfur, are mixed together to form a<br>
polysulfide mixture. The polysulfide mixture is then reacted with the silane compound,<br>
(RO)3-mRmSi-AIk-X, as described supra. This reaction can be conducted at a variety of<br>
temperatures, but generally in the range of 40 - 100°C. Preferably, the reaction is conducted<br>
at a temperature ranging from 65 - 95°C. Generally, the first step can be conducted at<br>
various pressures, but preferably the first step reaction is conducted at atmospheric pressure.<br>
The time needed for the reaction of the first step to occur is not critical, but generally ranges<br>
from 5 to 30 minutes. The intermediate reaction product is then reacted with the silane<br>
compound, (RO)3-mRmSi-Alk-X.<br>
[0037] The amount of water used to create the aqueous phase or polysulfide mixture can<br>
vary, but is preferably based on the amount of the silane compound of the formula, (RO)3.<br>
mRmSi-Alk-X, used in the process. Water can be added directly, or indirectly, as some water<br>
may already be present in small amounts in other starting materials. For purposes of the<br>
present invention, it is preferable to calculate the total amount of water present, that is,<br>
accounting for all water added either directly or indirectly. Preferably, the total amount of<br>
water used to create the aqueous phase or the intermediate reaction product is 1 to 100 weight<br>
% of the silane compound used, with a range of 2.5 to 70 weight % being more preferred.<br>
Most preferred is a range of 20 to 40 weight % of water used for the intermediate reaction<br>
product based on the amount of silane compound used.<br>
[0038] At the end of the reaction, a product mixture is produced containing an organic<br>
phase, an aqueous phase, and possibly precipitated solid materials than can include salts such<br>
as NaCl, Na2HPCO4, or NaHCO3 formed during the reaction. The organic phase contains the<br>
organosilane compound.<br><br>
[0039] The present invention also encompasses processing steps to enhance the separation<br>
of the organosilane compound from the product mixture. This separation can be the phase<br>
separation of the organic and aqueous phase, resulting directly from the reaction of<br>
components (A), (B), and optional (C), as described above. Alternatively, if precipitated<br>
salts are formed during the reaction, the salts can be separated first by a filtering process or<br>
decanting method prior to the phase separation. Preferably, water or a dilute acidic solution<br>
is added to the product mixture prior to separation. The addition of water or a dilute acidic<br>
solution can enhance product quality during the phase separation by dissolving some or all of<br>
the precipitated salts. The amount of water or dilute acidic solution that is added during this<br>
step can vary from 10 to 50% based on the weight of the amount of silane compound used,<br>
preferably, the amount of water or dilute acidic solution added is from 20 to 40 weight %<br>
based on the amount of the silane compound used, and most preferably from 25 weight % to<br>
35 weight %. When a dilute acidic solution is used, it can be any of the common acids, for<br>
example HC1, HNO3, H2SO4, or the like, having a normal (N) concentration of 0.000001 to<br>
5, preferably 0.01 to 1. The dilute acidic solution can also be prepared by the addition of a<br>
chlorosilane to water. Examples of chlorosilanes that can be used to create the dilute acidic<br>
solution include trichlorosilane, trichloromethylsilane, dimethyldichlorosilane,<br>
dimethylchlorosilane, trimethylchlorosilane . Preferably, 0.5 to 10 weight % chlorosilane can<br>
be used to prepare the dilute acidic solution, with 1 to 5 weight % being the most preferred.<br>
When a chlorosilane is used to create the dilute acidic solution, the chlorosilane is preferably<br>
trimethy lchlorosi lane.<br>
[0040] Following the addition of water or a dilute acidic solution to the product mixture,<br>
the organosilicon compound is isolated from the product mixture by phase separating the<br>
organic phase and aqueous phase. The organic phase containing the organosilicon compound<br>
can be further subjected to a drying step. One example of the drying step can be to treat the<br>
organic phase under vacuum to remove any volatile organic materials present along with any<br>
residual water that may be present. This drying step can involve, for example, heating the<br>
organic phase to a temperature of 20 to 160°C under a reduced pressure of 5 to 35 mm Hg<br>
(0.67 to 4.65 kPa) , preferably the conditions are 90 to 120°C at 5 to 25 mm Hg (0.67 to 3.33<br>
kPa). Alternatively, the drying step of the organic phase can involve the use of a thin film<br>
stripper to remove volatile organics materials and residual water content in the organic phase.<br>
Yet another technique for the drying step of the organic phase can be to contact the organic<br>
phase containing the organosilicon compound with a desiccant material. The desiccant<br>
material can be any solid material known in the art to remove trace quantities of water in<br>
organic phases. These include known ionic hygroscopic materials like sodium sulfate,<br>
magnesium sulfate, and the like, or silicate based materials such as zeolites, silica,<br>
aluminasilicates, and the like. The preferred desiccant material is either sodium sulfate or<br>
magnesium sulfate, with sodium sulfate being the most preferred.<br>
[0041] The dried organic phase can be subjected to additional steps according to the<br>
present invention that result in further improvements of the organosilicon compound final<br>
purity and appearance. The organic phase containing the organosilicon compound can be<br>
cooled to a temperature below 15°C. This cooling step results in the precipitation of un-<br>
reacted sulfur and sulfur compounds. Preferably, the organic phase containing the<br>
organosilicon compound is cooled to a temperature in the range of —20 to 30°C, and most<br>
preferably to a temperature in the range of —15 and 15°C. The precipitated un-reacted sulfur<br>
and sulfur compounds can then be separated, for example by filtration, from the organic<br>
phase containing the organosilicon compound. The present inventors have found that<br>
removing un-reacted sulfur and sulfur compounds minimizes or eliminates further<br>
precipitation of sulfur and un-reacted sulfur compounds with time. As a result, the long-term<br>
storage stability of the organosilicon compound is enhanced by producing a composition that<br>
does not change with time or result in a product composition containing solid precipitates.<br>
[0042] The following examples are provided to illustrate the present invention. These<br>
examples are not intended to limit the scope of the claims herein.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
[0043] The distribution of the various sulfur containing organosilicon compounds were<br>
analyzed by high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC). Typical run conditions for HPLC<br>
analysis were as follows: 8-9 drops of the reaction sample were diluted in 8.5 g of<br>
cyclohexane, which was then filtered through a 0.2 um PTFE membrane (e.g. PURADISC™<br>
25TF of Whatman®) into a vial, a 10 µl sample of the filtrate was injected via an<br>
autosampler into a HPLC system (e.g. Hewlett-Packard 1050). The sample was fractionated<br>
on a Lichrosorp RP18 column (e.g. Alltech Assoc, Inc; 250 mm x 4.6 mm, 10 um) using a<br>
mixture of 96 % acetonitrile and 4 % tetrahydrofurane (vol/vol) as mobile phase. The<br>
fractions were investigated via UV-absorption detector using 254 nm as the appropriate<br>
excitation wavelength. Different UV-sensitivities of every single sulfide species were<br>
averaged by division of the respective peak area through specific, empirically evaluated,<br>
response factors* (RF) listed below that reflect the hyperchromy with every sulfur atom in<br>
the chain and elemental sulfur.<br><br>

of sodium hydrogen sulfide (0.24 % Na2S, 45.77 % NaHS), 51.00 g of water and 77.24 g of<br>

filtered in a Biichner funnel through Paper (e.g. Whatman® 1) and filter aid (e.g. Celite® 545<br>
of ManCel Assoc, Inc.). For removal of remaining water droplets, 5.00 g of magnesium<br>
sulfate were added. The organic phase was filtered and 472.91 g of a clear, light amber liquid<br>
were received (Yield: 91.7 % of theory based on sulfide species). HPLC analysis shows an<br>
averaged sulfur rank of 3.75.<br>
Example 5<br>
[0048] A reactor was charged with 50.0 g (0.589 mole) NaHS flakes, 56.6 g (1.767 mole)<br>
sulfur and 75.62 g water and mixed at room temperature. Then, 25.12 g (0.628 mole) NaOH<br>
pellets (NaOH/NaHS ratio = 1.0 and S/NaHS ratio = 3.0) was charged quickly to prevent H2S<br>
formation and heated to 70°C while mixing. The solution became clear yellowish red in 30<br>
minutes when sulfur dissolved completely. No gas evolution was observed after the NaOH<br>
addition. A phase transfer catalyst, 25.0 wt % tetrabutyl ammonium bromide (TBAB)<br>
solution (4.54 g, 0.014 mole) was added to the sulfide aqueous phase and mixed for 15<br>
minutes. Dark reddish black precipitates formed at the surface. Then, 302,5 g (1.256 mole)<br>
chloropropyltriethoxysilane (CPTES) was added slowly and reacted for 2 hours. The reaction<br>
mixture was cooled to 50°C and the byproduct NaCl salt was dissolved in deionized water.<br>
The mixture was then phase separated. The organic phase (product) was filtered and analyzed<br>
by gas chromatography (GC) and high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) techniques.<br>
HPLC analysis shows an averaged sulfur rank of 4.08.<br>
[0049] A stable sulfide distribution was achieved in the initial stage of the reaction. No<br>
mercaptosilane was formed and no solid sulfur precipitation was observed on cooling and<br>
long-term storage of the product.<br>
Example 6<br>
[0050] A reactor was charged with 100 g (0.8316 mole) NaHS solution and heated to 50°C.<br>
Then, 66.5 g (0.8316 mole) of a 50 wt % NaOH solution (NaOH/NaHS ratio = 1.0 and<br>
S/NaHS ratio = 3.0) was added slowly and mixed. Solid crystals of Na2S formed and<br>
dispersed in aqueous phase. 79.3 g (2.495 mole) sulfur was added and mixed for 15 minutes<br>
at 83°C. Most of precipitates dissolved with the formation of Na2Sx. Then, 4.0 g (0.013 mole)<br>
TBAB was added at 70°C followed by addition of CPTES (402.0 g, 1.672 mole). No<br>
exotherm was observed during CPTES addition but an exotherm of 20°C (70° to 90°C) was<br>
observed after the CPTES addition for 7 minutes. Reaction was continued for 210 minutes<br>
before NaCl salt was dissolved in 177.4 g water at 30°C. After phase separation, 433.4 g<br>
organic phase (product) and 379.4 g. aqueous phase was collected. HPLC analysis showed an<br>
averaged sulfur rank of 3.86.<br>
[0051] The GC data showed that the reaction was complete in 2 hours and the CPTES<br>
content was less than 1.0 wt%. There was no mercaptan compounds formed at any stage of<br>
the reaction in this process because of the use of sodium hydroxide, which kept the pH<br>
greater than 12. The HPLC data showed that there was no significant change in sulfide<br>
distribution as the reaction progressed; therefore a stable sulfide distribution was formed in<br>
the aqueous phase in the presence of sodium hydroxide.<br>
Example 7<br>
[0052] In this experiment the molar ratio of NaOH/NaHS was changed to 3.0. The reactor<br>
was charged with 37.7 g (0.942 moles) NaOH pallets and dissolved in 75.6 g water by<br>
stirring at 200 rpm. The temperature rose to 40°C due to exotherm. Then, 25.0 g (0.314 moles<br>
Na) NaHS flakes (containing 61.7% NaHS and 6.07% Na2S, PPG) and 70.5 g (2.19 moles,<br>
S/HS" ratio = 7.0) sulfur were added slowly while mixing. A dark orange-red solution formed<br>
quickly with a slight evolution of gas. TBAB catalyst (4.5 g, 0.014 moles) was added at 68°C<br>
to the polysulfide aqueous phase and mixed for 10 minutes. Chloropropyltriethoxysilane<br>
(302.5 g, 1.2562 moles CPTES) was added slowly and reacted for 1.5 hour at 80-85°C. An<br>
exotherm of 17°C was observed during CPTES addition. The reaction mixture was cooled to<br>
50°C and salt was dissolved in water. Upon phase separation 252.8 g aqueous phase and<br>
309.1 g amber organic phase was obtained. The organic phase was analyzed by HPLC for<br>
sulfur distribution and an average sulfur rank was 3.93. The HPLC results showed the sulfide<br>
distribution equivalent to example 6, however, the GC showed -15 wt% unreacted CPTES.<br>
Yellow sulfur also precipitated from the product overnight.<br>
Example 8<br>
[0053] Another experiment on equivalent molar amount of NaOH and NaHS and three<br>
molar times of sulfur is provided in this example. First, 50.0 g (0.6281 mole) NaHS flakes,<br>
25.12 g (0.6281 mole) NaOH pallets and 60.42 g (1.8844 mole) sulfur were charged in a 1 1.<br>
reactor at room temperature. Then, 75.62 g water was added slowly with continuous mixing.<br>
The reaction mixture was heated to 68°C before adding 4.53 g TBAB catalyst as 25-wt%<br>
solutions. CPTES 317.61 g (1.32 mole) was added to the aqueous phase slowly to control the<br>
exotherm and reacted for 2 hour at 80-85°C. The byproduct NaCl salt was dissolved at 45°C<br>
after the reaction was complete. After phase separation 316.93 g product was collected and<br>
analyzed by GC and HPLC. The sulfur rank calculated was 3.89. The GC showed 6.0 wt%<br>
unreacted CPTES because excess CPTES was used in the reaction. The product was light<br>
yellow-orange and clear.<br>
Example 9 (comparative example)<br>
[0054] 3,3"-bis(triethoxysilylpropyl) tetrasulfide was also prepared from di-sodium sulfide<br>
as a starting material without sodium hydroxide. 81.0 g (0.623 moles) Na2S from PPG as 60<br>
wt% active flakes, 59.92 g (1.187 moles) sulfur and 75.0 g deionized water were charged in a<br>
1 1. reactor at room temperature. The mixture was heated to 68°C while mixing at 300 rpm.<br>
All the solids dissolved in the solution after 15 minutes. Then, 2.4 g (0.0074 moles) TBAB as<br>
a 25-wt% solution was added and mixed for 10 minutes. Then, 300.0 g (1.246 moles) CPTES<br>
was added slowly and reacted for 120 minutes. The GC results showed less than 0.5 wt%<br>
unreacted CPTES. The salt was dissolved at 50°C and the organic phase was phase separated.<br>
274.8 g dark red-orange product was collected. The product was also analyzed by HPLC and<br>
sulfur rank was calculated to be 3.83. The product obtained from this method was darker in<br>
color and solids precipitated on cooling.<br>
