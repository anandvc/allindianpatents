"LINE PRESSURE MEASUERMENT USING DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE<br>
SENSOR"<br>
ROSEMOUNT, INC., of 12001 Technology Drive, Eden Prairie, MN 55344 U.S.A.<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br><br><br>
LINE PRESSURE MEASUREMENT USING<br>
DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SENSOR<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
        The present invention relates to pressure sensors of the type used to measure the pressure of a process fluid. More specifically, the present invention relates to a pressure sensor configured to measure both a differential pressure as well as a line pressure.<br>
	Transmitters are used in process monitoring<br>
and control systems to measure various process variables of industrial processes. One type of transmitter measures pressure of process fluid in the process.  Various techniques have been used in the<br>
    pressure sensors used in such transmitters. One well known technique is to use a deflectable diaphragm. A capacitance is measured with respect to the diaphragm, with the diaphragm forming one of the capacitive plates of the capacitor. As the diaphragm<br>
     is deflected due to applied pressure, the measured capacitance changes. In such a configuration, there are a number of sources of inaccuracies in pressure measurements.<br>
One   technique   which   addresses   these<br>
    inaccuracies is set forth in U.S. Patent No. 6,295,875 entitled, "PROCESS PRESSURE MEASUREMENT DEVICES WITH IMPROVED ERROR COMPENSATION" issued October 2, 2001 to Frick et al. which is incorporated herein by reference  in its entirety.  This patent<br>
    describes  a  differential  pressure   sensor  that<br><br>
includes an additional electrode for use in reducing measurement inaccuracies. However, in some installations it is desirable to measure an absolute (line or gauge) pressure in addition to a differential pressure measurement. In such an application, an additional pressure sensor is typically required to measure the line pressure.<br>
SUMMARY <br>
A pressure sensor assembly for sensing a<br>
    pressure of a process fluid includes a sensor body having a cavity formed therein. The cavity is configured to couple to a first process fluid pressure. A deflectable diaphragm in the cavity deflects  in  response  to  the  first  process  fluid<br>
    pressure. A first primary electrode is coupled to a wall of the cavity and forms a first primary capacitor between the first primary electrode and the deflectable diaphragm. A first secondary electrode is coupled to the wall of the cavity to form a first<br>
    secondary capacitor between the first secondary electrode and the deflectable diaphragm. Line pressure of the process fluid is calculated as a function of variation in the first primary capacitor and the first secondary capacitor due to changes in<br>
    the size of the cavity from the first process fluid pressure.  A method is also provided.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The present invention provides an apparatus and method for determining line pressure for a multi- electrode capacitance-based pressure sensor. By computing the ratios of sums, or sums of ratios, of appropriate capacitances in a multi-capacitance based pressure sensor, the line pressure of the process fluid can be determined.<br><br><br>
Figure 1 shows generally the environment of a process measurement system 32. Figure 1 shows process piping 30 containing a fluid under pressure coupled to the process measurement system 32 for  measuring a process pressure. The process measurement system 32 includes impulse piping 34 connected to the piping 30. The impulse piping 34 is connected to a process pressure transmitter 36. A primary element 33,  such as an orifice plate,  venturi tube,  flow nozzle, and so on, contacts the process fluid at a location in the process piping 30 between the pipes of the impulse piping 34. The primary element 33 causes a pressure change in the fluid as it passes past the primary element 33.<br>
         Transmitter 36 is a process measurement device that receives process pressures through the impulse piping 34. The transmitter 36 senses a differential process pressure and converts it to a standardized transmission signal that is a function of the process<br>
 pressure.<br>
A process loop 38 provides both a power signal to the transmitter 36 from control room 40 and bidirectional communication, and can be constructed in accordance with a number of process communication<br>
 protocols. In the illustrated example, the process loop 38 is a two-wire loop. The two-wire loop is used to transmit all power to and all communications to and from the transmitter 36 during normal operations with  a  4-20  mA  signal.  A  computer  42  or  other<br>
 information  handling  system through  modem  44,  or<br><br><br>
other network interface, is used for communication with the transmitter 36. A remote voltage power supply 46 powers the transmitter 36.<br>
   Figure 2 is a simplified block diagram of pressure transmitter 36. Pressure transmitter 36 includes a sensor module 52 and an electronics board 72 coupled together through a databus 66. Sensor module electronics 60 couples to pressure sensor 56 which received an applied differential pressure 54.<br>
    The data connection 58 couples sensor 56 to an analog to digital converter 62. An optional temperature sensor 63 is also illustrated along with sensor module memory 64. The electronics board 72 includes a microcomputer system 74,  electronics memory module<br>
    76, digital to analog signal conversion 78 and digital communication block 80.<br>
In accordance with techniques set forth in U.S. Patent No. 6,295,875 to Frick et al., pressure transmitter 36 senses differential pressure. However,<br>
    the present invention is not limited to such a configuration.<br>
Figure 3 is a simplified cross-sectional view of one embodiment of a sensor module 52 showing pressure sensor 56. Pressure sensor 56 couples to a<br>
    process fluid through isolation diaphragms 90 which isolate the process fluid from cavities 92. Cavities 92 couple to the pressure sensor module 56 through impulse piping 94. A substantially incompressible fill fluid fills cavities 92 and impulse piping 94.<br>
    When a pressure from the process fluid is applied to<br><br><br>
diaphragms  90,  it  is  transferred to  the pressure sensor 56.<br>
Pressure sensor 56 is formed from two pressure sensor halves 114 and 116 and filled with a   preferably brittle, substantially incompressible material 105. A diaphragm 106 is suspended within a cavity 132,134 formed within the sensor 56-. An outer wall of the cavity 132, 134 carries electrodes 146,144,148  and  150.  These  can,  generally,  be<br>
    referred to as primary electrodes 144 and 148, and secondary or secondary electrodes 146 and 150. These electrodes form capacitors with respect to the moveable diaphragm 106. The capacitors, again, can be referred to as primary and secondary capacitors.<br>
    As illustrated in Figure 3, the various electrodes in sensor 56 are coupled to analog to digital converter 62 over electrical connection 103, 104, 108 and 110. Additionally, the deflectable diaphragm 106 couples to analog to digital converter<br>
    62 through connection 109.<br>
As discussed in U.S. Patent No. 6,295,875, the differential pressure applied to the sensor 56 can be measured using the electrodes 144-150. As discussed below, the capacitance measured using these<br>
    electrodes can also be used to determine the line pressure of the process fluid applied to the pressure sensor 56.<br>
Figure 4 is a simplified cross-sectional view of sensor 56 used to illustrate operation of the<br>
    present  invention.    Figure  4  illustrates  various<br><br><br>
capacitive  values,  Mx  between  electrode  144  and<br>
diaphragm 106, MY between electrode 148 and diaphragm<br>
106, Rx between electrode 146 and diaphragm 106 and<br>
capacitor RY between electrode 150 and diaphragm 106.<br>
 	It  has  been  discovered  that  during  an<br>
operation of pressure sensor 56, the line pressure applied to the pressure sensor through the capillary tubes 94 causes a deformation in the body 220 of pressure sensor 56.  The applied line pressure causes<br>
    a pressure difference between the pressure within body 220 and the internal environment of the pressure transmitter. This pressure differential causes the deformation in the body 220. In the example shown in Figure 4, a greatly exaggerated deformation is shown.<br>
    Specifically, the applied line pressure causes exterior walls 200 and 202 of body 220 to expand outward to the positions shown in phantom at 200' and 202' . As the body deforms, the interior walls 126 and 128 of cavity 132, 134 also expand outward to the<br>
    position shown in phantom 126' and 128', respectively. As the walls 126 and 128 move outwardly, the electrodes 144, 146, 148 and 150 also move in an outwardly position as illustrated in phantom at 144', 146', 148' and 150', respectively.<br>
    This change in position of the electrodes 144, 146, 148 and 150 results in a change in the capacitance values as measured at Mx, MY, Rx and RY. In accordance with the present invention, this change in capacitance  is  used to measure  the  line pressure<br>
    applied to the pressure sensor 56.<br><br><br>
As used herein, the capacitance between electrodes 144 and 148 and the diaphragm 106 is referred to as a "primary capacitance" and the capacitance between electrodes 146 and 150 and the  center diaphragm 106 is referred to as a secondary capacitance. In accordance with the present invention, the line pressure is determined as a function of the capacitance of a primary capacitor and the capacitance of a secondary capacitor.  These<br>
    capacitance values can be used in a ratio of sums, or sum of ratios, in a configuration to reduce errors in the line pressure measurements.<br>
A line pressure (P) signal can be derived from   the   multi-electrode    capacitance   based<br>
    differential pressure sensor 56 described above. This determination can be made by computing a ratio of sums, or a sum of ratios of the appropriate inverse active capacitance signals. As used herein, active capacitance is that capacitance which responds<br>
    to movement of the center diaphragm (CD) relative to the sensor cavity and excludes any stray capacitance. The inverse of active capacitance is proportional to the separation or gap between the two large area (primary) electrodes separated by a relatively small<br>
    distance. The configuration illustrated above with a center primary electrode and the ring secondary electrodes can be used to determine line pressure when the inverse active ring capacitances are divided by the inverse active primary capacitances.   More<br><br><br>
specifically,  line  pressure  can  be  determined  as follows:<br>
LP = k*(1/Rx + 1/Ry)/(\/Mx + l/My)	EQ. 1<br>
A  different,  equally  useful  formulation  can  be<br>
    written as follows:<br>
LP = j*(\/ Rx)/(\/ Mx) + (l/ Ry)/(\/ My) = j*(Mx/ Rx + My / Ry)   EQ. 2 Where M is the active capacitance of the primary electrode, R is the active capacitance of the ring electrode, x and y refer to the low and high sides of<br>
   the differential pressure sensor as illustrated in Figure 4. The constants k and j are proportionality constants. Line pressure can also be determined using a single active capacitance value. However, in such a  configuration,  the  capacitance  is  particularly<br>
   sensitive to errors, for example, due to temperature variations. In contrast, using the ratios discussed above, a much greater signal to noise ratio can be obtained, for example a factor 100 improvement over the use of single active capacitance.<br>
 	Figure 5A is a graph of line pressure (PSI)<br>
versus primary sum-effective gap (|.im) showing the temperature effect on the sum of the gaps between the primary electrodes 144, 148 and the diaphragm 106 utilizing  inverse  capacitance.    Figure  5B  is  a<br>
   similar graph utilizing inverse ring capacitance. As illustrated in FIGS. 5A and 5B, measuring the line pressure with inverse capacitance provides a very steep slope or low gauge factor with large changes in apparent  line  pressure   (y-intercept)   for  small<br>
   changes in temperature.  Figure 6A is a graph of line<br><br><br>
pressure versus ring sum/primary sum in accordance with equation 1 at various temperatures and Figure 6B is a graph of line pressure versus (ring gap/primary gap)x+(ring gap/primary gap)Y in accordance with  equation 2. As illustrated in FIGS. 6A and 6B, and in contrast to the graphs FIGS. 5A and 5B, the slope of the LP signal is greatly reduced (higher gauge factor) and the y-intercept offsets caused by temperature are small relative to the LP span.  The<br>
    raw temperature error in FIGS. 6A and 6B is similar to comparable sensors and is at least partially correctable. In the graphs of FIGS. 5A, 5B, 6A and 6B, the data was collected at a differential pressure of 0.<br>
 	A line pressure signal can also be obtained<br>
when the differential pressure and line pressure are superimposed by combining either of the ratios illustrated in equations 1 or 2 with a standard differential pressure transfer function.  In the case<br>
    of equation 1, such a combination results in a fit of the data to a surface in three dimensional space with line pressure being a function of a ratio from equation  1  and  the  standard  transfer  function<br>
(Mx - My)<br>
	— .  For example, FIGS. 7A and 7B are the views<br>
(Mx + My)<br>
    of a graph of line pressure versus primary transfer function versus ring sum/primary sum. In this example, 192 data points are fitted based upon using a standard pressure transmitter at various line pressure  and  differential  pressure  values.    The<br><br>
reorientation of the axes in Figure 7B illustrates the close fit of the data into a plane.<br>
Figure 8A is a graph of the data from FIGS. 7A, 7B of line pressure versus ring sum/primary sum.   Figure 8B is a graph of the slope of each line in Figure 8A versus nominal primary TF. As illustrated in these figures, the data is easily segregated with great consistency by the transfer function. The plot in Figure 8B illustrates that there is no higher<br>
   order effect that warps or twists the plane and confirms the simplicity of the ratio/transfer function/line pressure relationship.<br>
With the present invention, the instability of the dielectric constant of the fill fluid caused<br>
    by heating, cooling, compression, decompression and transients cancels out to a relatively large degree. This is achieved by using more than one electrode on either side of the diaphragm in the pressure cell to obtain the line pressure signal.<br>
 	In specific experiments,  the precision of<br>
the data provides an error band of +1-70 PSI line pressure at a 95% confidence level. This level of precision is sufficient for reducing zero and span line  pressure  errors  by  a  factor  of  10  over  a<br>
     standard configuration by correcting the differential pressure transmitter output based upon the line-pressure signal. Manipulation of the capacitance data alone provides this improvement and no additional   line-pressure   sensor   is   required.<br>
    Further, the present invention can be used to extract<br><br><br>
a useable line pressure signal based upon the measured capacitance values, again without the use of an additional line pressure sensor. In more advanced configurations, the line pressure signal can be used  in combination with differential pressure and, in some configurations, combined with temperature to provide a mass flow calculation.<br>
In  one  example,  the  capacitance  of  the primary capacitor changes by about 0.2% as the line<br>
    pressure changes from 0 to 2000 PSI. Similarly, the capacitance of the ring capacitor changes by about 0.7% over such a range. The change in capacitance is substantially linearly relative to the change in applied line pressure.  The two capacitances are used<br>
    to accurately measure the applied line pressure.<br>
Although the present invention has been described with reference to preferred embodiments, workers skilled in the art will recognize that changes  may  be  made  in  form  and  detail  without<br>
    departing from the spirit and scope of the invention. In some embodiments the present invention includes compensating the calculated line pressure based upon the applied differential pressure. As used herein, the "primary"  electrodes and capacitors and "secondary"<br>
    electrodes and capacitors can be alternatively referred to as "primary" and "secondary", respectively. The measured or calculated line pressure can be used independently,  or  can  be  used  to,  for  example, compensate  for errors in the measured differential<br><br><br>
pressure.  It is contemplated that the measured line pressure can be used for other purposes.<br><br><br><br>

LINE PRESSURE MEASUREMENT USING<br>
DIFFERENTIAL PRESSURE SENSOR<br>
ABSTRACT<br>
         A pressure sensor assembly (56) for sensing<br>
a pressure of a process fluid includes a sensor body<br>
(220)  having a cavity  (132,134)  formed therein to<br>
couple to a process fluid pressure.  A deflectable<br>
diaphragm (100) in the cavity deflects in response to<br>
the first and second process fluid pressures. A first<br>
primary electrode  (144)  couples to a wall  (126) of<br>
the cavity and forms a first primary capacitor (Mx)<br>
between  the   first  primary  electrode  and  the<br>
deflectable diaphragm.  A first  secondary electrode<br>
(146) couples to the wall of the cavity to form a<br>
first  secondary  capacitor  (Rx)  between  the  first<br>
secondary electrode and the deflectable diaphragm. A<br>
second primary electrode (148)  and second secondary<br>
electrode  (150)  are preferably coupled to a wall<br>
(128)  of  the  cavity  opposite  the  first.    Line<br>
pressure of the process fluid is determined based<br>
upon variation in the secondary capacitors relative<br>
to the primary capacitors.<br></td>
