				<td>Pesticidal composition<br>
The present invention relates to a synergistic composition which comprises a pesticidal combination of active ingredients, to a method of controlling pests, to a process for the preparation of the composition, to its use, to plant propagation material treated with it, and to the use of a compound of the formula (A) below for preparing the composition.<br>
Certain mixtures of active ingredients are proposed in the literature for controlling pests. However, the biological properties of these mixtures of known compounds are not entirely satisfactory in the field of pest control, which is why there is a demand for providing further mixtures having synergistic pesticidal properties, in particular for controlling insects and representatives of the order Acarina. This object is achieved according to the invention by providing the present composition.<br>
The invention relates to a pesticidal composition which comprises a pesticidally-synergistically active combination, in variable proportions, of the pesticidally active compound of the formula<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>

The active combination according to the invention comprises the active ingredient of the formula (A) and one of the active ingredients (I) to (LXIX) preferably in a ratio of 100:1 to 1:50, especially 1:50 to 50:1, in particular in a ratio of between 1:20 and 20:1, especially between 10:1 and 1:10, very especially between 5:1 and 1:5, especially preferably between 2:1 and 1:2, also preferably between 4:1 and 2:1, very particularly in a ratio of 1:1, or 5:1, or 5:2, or 5:3, or 5:4, or 4:1, or 4:2, or 4:3, or 3:1, or 3:2, or 1:5, or 2:5, or 3:5, or 4:5, or 1:4, or 3:4, or 1:3, or 2:3, or 1:2. These ratios are to be understood as meaning, on the one hand, weight ratios, and on the other hand also molar ratios.<br>
A particularly effective composition has proved to be one which comprises four parts by weight of the compound of the formula (A) (diafenthiuron) and one part by weight of the compound (I) (ethyl 2-(4-phenoxyphenoxy)ethylcarbamate, fenoxycarb); a composition which is thus composed is very especially suitable for controlling representatives of the family Pyralidae, very especially representatives of the genus Hellula, in particular Hellula un-dalis, representatives of the family Plutellidae (Yponomeutoidae), in particular the genus Plutella, especially Plutella xylostella, and representatives of the family Noctuidae, especially the genus Spodoptera, in particular Spodoptera littoralis.<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that the combination of the active ingredient of the formula (A) or of a salt thereof with one of the active ingredients (I) to (LXIX) causes not only an additive widening of the spectrum of action on the pests to be controlled, which would be expected in principle, but also that it provokes a synergistic effect which extends the limits of the action of both preparations from two points of view:<br>
Firstly, the rates of application of the compound of the formula (A) and of the individual compounds (I) to (LXIX) are reduced while retaining an equally good action. Secondly, the combined mixture also achieves a high degree of pest control where both individual substances have become completely ineffective when unduly low rates are applied. This allows, on the one hand, a considerable widening of the spectrum of pests which can be controlled and, on the other hand, an increased safety upon use.<br>
In addition to the actual synergistic action with regard to the pesticidal activity, the compositions according to the invention additionally have other surprising advantages, which can also be termed synergistic in a wider sense: for example, they allow the control of pests which are not, or not sufficiently, controlled by the individual compounds (A) and (I) to (LXIX), and the compositions according to the invention are better tolerated by plants, i.e. they are less phytotoxic than the individual compounds (A) and (I) to (LXIX). Moreover, for example, various development stages of the insects can be controlled, which is in some cases not the case in the individual compounds (A) and (I) to (LXIX), since these compounds can, for example, only be used as adulticides or only as larvicides against very specific in-stars. In addition, for example, combinations of the compound (A) with certain compounds (I) to (LXIX) show up more favourable behaviour during ginding, mixing, storage and also spraying.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are valuable for preventive and/or curative treatment in the field of pest control even at low rates of application while being well tolerated by warm-blooded species, fish and plants and have a very favourable biocidal spectrum. The compositions according to the invention are active against all or individual development stages of normally sensitive, but also resistant, animal pests, such as insects and representatives of the order Acarina. The insecticidal and/or acaricidal action of the compounds according to the invention can become obvious either directly, i.e. by destroying<br>
the pests immediately or only after some time has elapsed, for example during an ecdysis, or indirectly, for example by a reduced oviposition rate and/or hatching rate, the good action corresponding to a destruction rate (mortality) of at least 50 to 60 %.<br>

The mixtures of active ingredients according to the invention can be used for controlling, i.e. containing or destroying, pests of the abovementioned type which occur in particular on plants, very especially in crop plants and ornamentals, in agricultural, in horticulture and in forests, or on parts of such plants, such as fruits, flowers, foliage, stalks, tubers or roots, and even parts of the plants which are formed at a later stage are protected in some cases against these pests.<br>
The pesticide mixture according to the invention can be applied advantageously for pest control in cereals, such as maize or sorghum; in fruit, for example pome fruit, stone fruit and soft fruit, such as apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries or berries, for example strawberries, raspberries and blackberries; in pulses, such as beans, lentils, peas or soya; in oil crops, such as oilseed rape, mustard, poppies, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor, cocoa or groundnuts; in cucurbits, such as pumpkins, cucumbers or melons; in fibre plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp or jute; in citrus fruit, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruit or tangerines; in vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbage species, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes or bell peppers, in the Lauraceae, such as avocado, cinnamomum or camphor, or in tobacco, nuts, coffee, egg plants, sugar cane, tea, pepper, grapevines, hops, Musaceae, latex plants or ornamentals, especially in maize, sorghum, pome and stone fruit, pulses, cucurbits, cotton, citrus fruit, vegetables, egg plants, grapevines, hops or ornamentals, in particular in maize, sorghum, apples, pears, plums, peaches, beans, peas, soya, olives, sunflowers, coconut, cocoa, groundnuts, cucumbers, pumpkins, citrus fruit, cabbage species, tomatoes, potatoes, grapevines or cotton, particularly preferably in grapevines, citrus fruit, apples, pears, tomatoes and cotton.<br>
Other fields of application of the mixtures of active ingredients according to the invention are the protection of stored products and stores and of material and, in the hygiene sector, in particular the protection of domestic animals and productive live stock against pests of the abovementioned type.<br>
The pesticides according to the invention are, depending on the intended aims and the prevailing circumstances, emulsifiable concentrates, suspension concentrates, ready-to-spray<br><br>
or ready-to-dilute solutions, spreadable pastes, dilute emulsions, soluble powders, dis-persable powders, wettable powders, dusts, granules or encapsulations in polymeric substances, all of these comprising the compound of the formula (A) or a salt thereof and one of the other active ingredients (I) to (LXIX) according to the invention.<br>
In these compositions, the active ingredients are employed in pure form, for example the solid active ingredients in a specific particle size, or, preferably, together with - at least - one of the auxiliaries conventionally used in the art of formulation, such as extenders, for example solvents or solid carriers, or surface-active compounds (surfactants).<br>
Examples of solvents which are suitable are: unhydrogenated or partially hydrogenated aromatic hydrocarbons, preferably the fractions C8 to Ci2 of alkylbenzenes, such as xylene mixtures, alkylated naphthalene or tetrahydronaphthalene, aliphatic or cycloaliphatic hydrocarbons, such as paraffins or cyclohexane, alcohols, such as ethanol, propanol or butanol, glycols and their ethers and esters, such as propylene glycol, dipropylene glycol ether, ethylene glycol, ethylene glycol monomethyl ether or ethylene glycol monoethyl ether, keto-nes, such as cyclohexanone, isophorone or diacetone alcohol, strongly polar solvents, such as N-methylpyrrolid-2-one, dimethyl sulfoxide or N,N-dimethylformamide, water, unepoxidi-zed or epoxidized vegetable oils, such as unepoxidized or epoxidized rapeseed, castor, coconut or soya oil, and silicone oils.<br>
Solid carriers which are used for example for dusts and dispersable powders are, as a rule, ground natural minerals, such as calcite, talc, kaolin, montmorillonite or attapulgite. Highly-disperse silicas or highly-disperse absorptive polymers may also be used to improve the physical properties. Suitable paniculate, adsorptive carriers for granules are porous types, such as pumice, brick grit, sepiolite or bentonite, and suitable non-absorptive carrier materials are calcite or sand. Moreover, a large number of granulated materials of inorganic or organic nature, in particular dolomite or comminuted plant residues, may be used. Suitable surface-active compounds are, depending on the nature of the active ingredient to be formulated, non-ionic, cationic and/or anionic surfactants or surfactant mixtures have good emulsifying, dispersing and wetting properties. The surfactants listed below are only given by way of example; a large number of other surfactants conventionally used in the art of formulation and suitable according to the invention are described in the relevant literature.<br><br>
-15-<br>
Suitable non-ionic surfactants are mainly polyglycol ether derivatives of aliphatic or cycloali-phatic alcohols, saturated or unsaturated fatty acids and alkylphenols, which can have 3 to 30 glycol ether groups and 8 to 20 carbon atoms in the (aliphatic) hydrocarbon radical and 6 to 18 carbon atoms in the alkyl radical of the alkylphenols. Also suitable are water-soluble polyethylene oxide adducts with polypropylene glycol, ethylene diaminopolypropylene glycol and alkyl polypropylene glycol having 1 to 10 carbon atoms in the alkyl chain and comprising 20 to 250 ethylene glycol ether groups and 10 to 100 propylene glycol ether groups. The abovementioned compounds conventionally have 1 to 5 ethylene glycol units per propylene glycol unit. Examples which may be mentioned are nonylphenol polyethoxyethanols, castor oil polyglycol ether, polypropylene/polyethylene oxide adducts, tributylphenoxypoly-ethoxyethanol, polyethylene glycol and octylphenoxypolyethoxyethanol. Also suitable are fatty acid esters or polyoxyethylene sorbitan, such as polyoxyethylene sorbitan trioleate.<br>
The cationic surfactants are mainly quaternary ammonium salts which have, as substitu-ents, at least one alkyl radical having 8 to 22 carbon atoms and as further substituents lower, halogenated or unhalogenated alkyl, benzyl or lower hydroxyalkyl radicals. The salts are preferably in the form of halides, methylsulfates or ethylsulfates. Examples are stearyl--trimethyl-ammonium chloride and benzyl di-(2-chloroethyl)ethylammonium bromide.<br>
Suitable anionic surfactants can be water-soluble soaps and also water-soluble synthetic surface-active compounds. Soaps which are suitable are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts and substituted or unsubstituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids (Ci0-022), such as the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or of natural fatty acid mixtures which can be obtained, for example, from coconut or tall oil; fatty acid methyltauri-nates should furthermore be mentioned. However, so-called synthetic surfactants are used more frequently, in particular fatty sulfonates, fatty sulfates, sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives or alkylarylsulfonates. The fatty sulfonates and fatty sulfates are, as a rule, in the form of alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or substituted or unsubstituted ammonium salts and have, as a rule, an alkyl radical of 8 to 22 carbon atoms, alkyl also including the alkyl moiety of acyl radicals, for example the sodium salt or calcium salt of lignosulfonic acid, of the dodecylsulfuric ester or of a fatty alcohol sulfate mixture prepared from natural fatty acids. This group also includes the salts of the sulfuric esters and sulfonic acids of fatty alcohol/ethylene oxide adducts. The sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives comprise pre-<br><br>
ferably 2 sulfonyl groups and a fatty acid radical having appproximately 8-22 carbon atoms. Alkylarylsulfonates are, for example, the sodium salts, calcium salts or triethanolammonium salts of dodecylbenzenesulfonic acid or of a naphthalenesulfonic acid/formaldehyde con-densate. Suitable phosphates, for example salts of the phosphoric ester of a p-nonylphenol/(4-14)-ethylene oxide adduct, or phospholipids, are also suitable.<br>
As a rule, the compositions comprise 0.1 to 99 %, in particular 0.1 to 95 %, of a mixture of the active ingredient of the formula (A) with one of the active ingredients (I) to (LXIX), and 1 to 99.9 %, in particular 5 to 99.9 %, of - at least - one solid or liquid auxiliary, it being possible, as a rule, for 0 to 25 %, in particular 0.1 to 20 %, of the compositions to be surfactants (% in each case meaning percent by weight). While concentrated compositions are more preferred as commercially available goods, the end consumer uses, as a rule, dilute compositions which have considerably lower concentrations of active ingredient. Preferred compositions are composed, in particular, as follows (% = percent by weight):<br><br>
Emulsifiable concentrates: Mixture of active ingredients: Surfactant: Solvent:<br><br>
1 to 90 %, preferably 5 to 20 % 1 to 30 %, preferably 10 to 20 % 5 to 98 %, preferably 70 to 85 %<br><br><br><br>
Dusts:<br>
Mixture of active ingredients:<br>
Solid carrier:<br><br>
0.1 to 10 %, preferably 0.1 to 1 % 99.9 to 90 %, preferably 99.9 to 99 %<br><br><br><br>
Suspension concentrates: Mixture of active ingredients: Water: Surfactant:<br><br>
5 to 75 %, preferably 10 to 50 % 94 to 24 %, preferably 88 to 30 % 1 to 40 %, preferably 2 to 30 %<br><br><br><br>
Wettable powders:<br>
Mixture of active ingredients:<br>
Surfactant:<br>
Solid carrier:<br><br>
0.5 to 90 %, preferably 1 to 80 % 0.5 to 20 %, preferably 1 to 15 % 5 to 99 %, preferably 15 to 98 %<br><br>
Granules:<br>
Mixture of active ingredients:	0.5 to 30 %, preferably 3 to 15 %<br>
Solid carrier:	99.5 to 70 %, preferably 97 to 85 %<br>
The compositions according to the invention can also comprise other solid or liquid auxiliaries, such as stabilizers, for example epoxidized or unepoxidized vegetable oils (for example epoxidized coconut oil, rapeseed oil or soya oil), antifoams, for example silicone oil, preservatives, viscosity regulators, binders and/or adhesives, and also fertilizers or other active ingredients for achieving specific effects, for example bactericides, fungicides, nematicides, molluscicides or herbicides.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are prepared in a known manner, for example in the absence of auxiliaries by grinding, screening and/or compressing a solid active ingredient or mixture of active ingredients, for example to a specific particle size, and, in the presence of at least one auxiliary, for example by intimately mixing and/or grinding the active ingredient or mixture of active ingredients with the auxiliary (auxiliaries). The process for the preparation of the compositions is therefore a further subject-matter of the invention.<br>
The mixtures of the compound of the formula (A) with one of the compounds (I) to (LXIX) are preferably employed with the auxiliaries conventionally used in the art of formulation and are therefore processed in a known manner to give, for example, emulsifiable concentrates, ready-to-spray or ready-to-dilute solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules, and also encapsulations, for example in polymeric substances. The methods of application, such as spraying, atomizing, dusting, wetting, scattering or pouring, and the type of composition are selected to suit the intended aims and the prevailing circumstances.<br>
The methods of application for the compositions, i.e. the methods of controlling pests of the abovementioned type, such as spraying, atomizing, dusting, brushing on, seed dressing, scattering or pouring, which are to be selected to suit the intended aims and the prevailing circumstances, and also the use of the compositions for controlling pests of the abovementioned type are further subject-matters of the invention. Typical rates of application are between 0.1 and 1000 ppm, preferably between 0.1 and 500 ppm, of active ingredient. The<br><br>
rate of application can vary within wide limits and depends on the nature of the soil, the type of application (foliar application; seed treatment; use in the seed furrow), the crop plant, the pest to be controlled, the respective climate prevailing, and other factors determined by type of application, timing of application and target crop. The rates of application per hectare are generally 1 to 2000 g of active ingredient per hectare, in particular 10 to 1000 g/ha, preferably 20 to 600 g/ha.<br>
A preferred method of application in the field of crop protection is application to the foliage of the plants (foliar application), it being possible to adjust frequency and rate of application depending on the risk of infestation of the pest in question. Alternatively, the active ingredients can reach the plants via the root system (systemic action), by drenching the locus of the plants with a liquid composition or by incorporating the active ingredients in solid form into the locus of the plants, for example the soil, for example in the form of granules (soil application). In the case of paddy rice, such granules can be metered into the flooded paddy-field.<br>
The compositions according to the invention are also suitable for protecting plant propagation material, for example seed, such as fruits, tubers or kernels, or nursery plants, against animal pests. The propagation material can be treated with the composition before planting, for example seed can be dressed before sowing. The active ingredients according to the invention can also be applied to seed kernels (coating), either by soaking the kernels in a liquid composition or by coating them with a solid composition. Alternatively, the composition can be applied to the planting site when planting the propagation material, for example into the seed furrow during sowing. These treatment methods for plant propagation material and the resulting treated plant propagation material are other subject-matters of the invention.<br>

The finely ground active ingredients are mixed intimately with the additives. This gives a suspension concentrate from which suspsensions of any desired concentration can be prepared by dilution with water.<br>
Frequently, it is more convenient to formulate the active ingredient of the formula (A) and one of the other components (I) to (LXIX) individually and only to combine them shortly before application in the applicator in the desired mixing ratio in the form of a "tank mix" in water.<br>
Biological examples. (% = percent by weight unless otherwise specified)<br>
A synergistic effect is always present when the action of the combination of the active ingredient of the formula (A) with one of the active ingredients (I) to (LXIX) exceeds the total of the action of the active ingredients applied individually.<br>
For example, the expected pesticidal action Ae for a given combination of two pesticides can be calculated as follows (cf. COLBY, S.R., "Calculating synergistic and antagonistic response of herbicide combinations", Weeds 15, pages 20-22,1967):<br>
In this formula:<br>
X =     Percent mortality when treated with the compound of the formula (A) at a rate of<br>
application of p kg per hectare in comparison with the untreated control (= 0 %).<br>
Y =     Percent mortality when treated with a compound (I) to (LXIX) at a rate of application of q kg per hectare in comparison with the untreated control.<br>
Ae =    Expected pesticidal action (percent mortality in comparison with the untreated control) after treatment with the compound of the formula (A) and a compound (I) to (LXIX) at a rate of application of p + q kg of active ingredient per hectare.<br>
If the actually observed action exceeds the expected value Ae, synergism is present.<br>
Example B1: Action against Bemisia tabaci<br>
Dwarf bean plants are placed into gauze cages and populated with Bemisia tabaci adults. After oviposition, all adults are removed. 10 days later, the plants and the nymphs thereon are sprayed with an aqueous suspension spray mixture comprising 50 ppm of the mixture of active ingredients. After a further 14 days, the percentage hatching rate of the eggs is evaluated in comparison with untreated control batches.<br>
In this experiment, the combinations of the active ingredient of the formula (A) with one of the active ingredients (I) to (LXIX) have a synergistic effect. In particular, a suspension spray mixture comprising 40 ppm of the compound (A) and 10 ppm of the compound (I) is very effective.<br>
Example B2: Action against Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars<br>
Young soya plants are sprayed with an aqueous emulsion spray mixture comprising<br>
360 ppm of the mixture of active ingredients. After the spray coating has dried on, the soya<br>
plants are populated with 10 third-instar Spodoptera littoralis caterpillars and placed in a<br>
plastic container. The test is evaluated 3 days later. The percentage reduction in population<br>
or the percentage reduction of feeding damage (% action) is determined by comparing the<br>
number of dead caterpillars and the feeding damage on the treated plants with those on the<br>
untreated plants.<br>
In this experiment, the combinations of the active ingredient of the formula (A) with one of<br>
the active ingredients (I) to (LXIX) have a synergistic effect. In particular, a suspension<br>
spray mixture comprising 300 ppm of compound (A) and 60 ppm of compound (I) and a<br>
suspension spray mixture comprising 270 ppm of compound (A) and 90 ppm of compound<br>
(I) are very effective.<br>
Example B3: Ovicidal action against Lobesia botrana<br>
Lobesia botrana eggs deposited on filter paper are immersed briefly into a test solution comprising 400 ppm of the mixture of active ingredients to be tested in acetone/water. After the test solution has dried on, the eggs are incubated in Petris dishes. After 6 days, the percentage hatching rate of the eggs is evaluated in comparison with untreated control batches (% reduction in hatching rate).<br>
In this test, the combinations of the active ingredient of the formula (A) with one of the active ingredients (I) to (LXIX) have a synergistic effect. In particular, a suspension spray mixture which comprises 200 ppm of compound (A) and 200 ppm of compound (I) and a suspension spray mixture which comprises 300 ppm of compound (A) and 100 ppm of compound (I) are very effective.<br>
Example B4: Ovicidal action against Heliothis virescens<br>
Heliothis virescens eggs deposited on filter paper are immersed briefly into a test solution comprising 400 ppm of the mixture of active ingredients to be tested in acetone/water. After the test solution has dried on, the eggs are incubated in Petri dishes. After 6 days, the percentage hatching rate of the eggs is evaluated in comparison with untreated control batches (% reduction in hatching rate).<br>
In this test, the combinations of the active ingredient of the formula (A) with one of the active ingredients (I) to (LXIX) have a synergistic effect. In particular, a suspension spray mixture which comprises 240 ppm of compound (A) and 160 ppm of compound (I) and a suspension spray mixture which comprises 300 ppm of compound (A) and 100 ppm of compound (I) are very effective.<br>
Example B5: Action against Plutella xvlostella caterpillars<br>
Young cabbage plants are sprayed with an aqueous emulsion spray mixture comprising 440 ppm of the active ingredient. After the spray coating has dried on, the cabbage plants are populated with 10 third-instar Plutella xylostella caterpillars and placed in a plastic container. The test is evaluated 3 days later. The percentage reduction in population or the percentage reduction in feeding damage (% action) is determined by comparing the number of dead caterpillars and the feeding damage on the treated plants with those on the untreated plants.<br>
In this experiment, the combinations of the active ingredient of the formula (A) with one of the active ingredients (I) to (LXIX) have a synergistic effect. In particular, a suspension<br>
spray mixture comprising 400 ppm of compound (A) and 40 ppm of compound (I) and a suspension spray mixture comprising 220 ppm of compound (A) and 220 ppm of compound (I) are very effective.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
