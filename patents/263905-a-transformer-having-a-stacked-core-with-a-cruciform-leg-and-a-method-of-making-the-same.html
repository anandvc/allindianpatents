A TRANSFORMER HAVING A STACKED CORE<br>
WITH A CRUCIFORM LEG AND A METHOD OF MAKING THE SAME<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to transformers and more particularly, to transformers<br>
having a stacked core with a cruciform leg and methods of making the same with reduced<br>
waste.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002]	A stacked transformer core is comprised of thin metallic laminate plates,<br>
such as grain oriented silicon steel. This type of material is used because the grain of<br>
the steel may be groomed in certain directions to reduce the magnetic field loss. The<br>
plates are stacked on top of each other to form a plurality of layers. A stacked core is<br>
typically rectangular in shape and can have a rectangular or cruciform cross-section. A<br>
cruciform cross-section increases the strength of a stacked core. In addition, a core leg<br>
having a cruciform cross-section provides more surface area for supporting a coil. An<br>
example of a conventional stacked transformer core having a cruciform cross-section is<br>
shown in U.S. Patent No. 4,283,842 to DeLaurentis et al. The core of the DeLaurentis<br>
et al. patent has upper and lower yokes with cruciform cross-sections, as well as legs<br>
with cruciform cross-sections.<br>
[0003]	Although a stacked core having a cruciform cross-section, such as the<br>
core of the DeLaurentis et al. patent, provides additional support and strength, such a<br>
core is typically more difficult to manufacture and results in more wasted steel.<br>
Therefore, it would be desirable to provide a stacked transformer core that has the<br>
benefits of a cruciform cross-section, but is simpler to manufacture and reduces the<br>
amount of steel that is wasted. The present invention is directed to such a transformer<br>
core and a method of making the same.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004]	In accordance with the present invention, a transformer is provided having<br><br>
WO 2006/105024	PCTAJS2006/011120<br>
a stacked core. The core is provided with a first yoke formed from a stack of plates and<br>
having an outer side and an inner side with a groove formed therein. The groove<br>
extends in a stacking direction of the plates and is located inwardly from the outer side.<br>
. The plates have the same width so as to provide the first yoke with a rectangular cross-<br>
section. The core is also provided with a second yoke formed from a stack of plates and<br>
having an outer side and an inner side with a groove formed therein. The groove<br>
extends in the stacking direction of the plates and is located inwardly from the outer<br>
side. A first end of an inner leg is disposed in the groove of the first yoke and a second<br>
of the inner leg is disposed in the groove of the second yoke. The inner leg has a<br>
cruciform cross-section and is formed from a stack of plates with different width. A coil<br>
winding is mounted to the inner leg.<br>
[0005]	Also provided in accordance with the present invention is a method of<br>
forming a transformer with a stacked core. In accordance with the method, a plurality of<br>
first and second outer leg plates and a plurality of inner leg plates are provided. The<br>
inner leg plates have different widths. A plurality of first yoke plates with the same width<br>
is also provided. Each of the first yoke plates has an outer side and an inner side with<br>
a notch formed therein. The notch is located inwardly from the outer side. The inner leg<br>
plates, the first yoke plates and the first and second outer leg plates are stacked to form<br>
first and second outer legs, a first yoke with a first groove, and an inner leg having a<br>
first end disposed in the first groove. The first outer leg is formed from the first outer leg<br>
plates, the second outer leg is formed from the second outer leg plates, the inner leg is<br>
formed from the inner leg plates and the first yoke is formed from the first yoke plates.<br>
The first groove extends in a stacking direction of the first yoke and is formed by the<br>
notches of the first yoke plates. The inner leg plates are stacked so as to provide the<br>
inner leg with a cruciform cross-section and the first yoke plates are stacked so as to<br>
provide the .first yoke with a rectangular cross-section. A coil winding is mounted to the<br>
inner leg.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0015]	It should be noted that in the detailed description that follows, identical<br>
components have the same reference numerals, regardless of whether they are shown<br>
in different embodiments of the present invention. It should also be noted that in order<br>
to clearly and concisely disclose the present invention, the drawings may not<br>
necessarily be to scale and certain features of the invention may be shown in<br>
somewhat schematic form.<br>
[0016] The present invention is directed to a transformer 10 (shown in Fig. 6), such<br>
as a distribution transformer, having a stacked core 12. The transformer 10 may bean oil-<br>
3<br><br>
WO 2006/105024	PCTAJS2006/011120<br>
filled transformer, i.e., cooled by oil, or a dry-type transformer, i.e., cooled by air. The<br>
construction of the core 12, however, is especially suitable for use in a dry transformer.<br>
Referring now to Fig. 1, the core 12 has a rectangular shape and generally comprises an<br>
upper yoke 14, a lower yoke 16, first and second outer legs 18, 20 and an inner leg 22.<br>
Upper ends of the first and second outer legs 18, 20 are connected to first and second<br>
ends of the upperyoke 14, respectively, while lower ends of the first and second outer legs<br>
18, 20 are connected to first and second ends of the lower yoke 16. The inner leg 22 is<br>
disposed midway between the first and second outer legs 18, 20. The inner leg 22 has an<br>
upper end connected to the upper yoke 14 and a lower end connected to the lower yoke<br>
16. With this construction, two windows 24 are formed between the innerleg 22 and the<br>
first and second outer legs 18, 20.<br>
[0017]	The upper yoke 14 has an inner side 14a and an outer side 14b, and the<br>
lower yoke 16 has an inner side 16a and an outer side 16b. The upperyoke 14 comprises<br>
a stack of plates 26, while the lower yoke 16 comprises a stack of plates 28. Both the<br>
plates 26 and the plates 28 are arranged in groups. In one exemplary embodiment of the<br>
present invention, the groups are groups of seven. Of course, groups of different numbers<br>
may be used, such as groups of four, which are used herein for ease of description and<br>
illustration. Each of the plates 26, 28 is composed of grain-oriented silicon steel and has a<br>
thickness in a range of from about 7 mils to about 14 mils, with the particular thickness<br>
being selected based on the application of the transformer 10. The plates 26, 28 each<br>
have a unitary construction and are trapezoidal in shape. In each of the plates 26, 28,<br>
opposing ends of the plate 26, 28 are mitered at oppositely-directed angles of about 45°;<br>
thereby providing the plate -26, 28 with major and minor sides. The plates 26 have the<br>
same width to provide the upper yoke 14 with a rectangular cross-section and the plates 28<br>
have the same width to provide the lower yoke 16 with a rectangular cross-section.<br>
However, the lengths of the plates 26 are not all the same and the lengths of the plates 28<br>
are not all the same. More specifically, the lengths within each group of plates 26 are<br>
different and the lengths within each group of plates 28 are different. The pattern of<br>
different lengths is the same for each group of plates 26 and the pattern of different lengths<br>
is the same for each group of plates 28. The difference in lengths within each group<br>
4<br><br>
WO 2006/105024	PCTAJS2006/011120<br>
permits the formation of multi-step lap joints with plates 30, 32 of the first and second outer<br>
legs 18, 20 as will be described more fully below.<br>
[0018]	A V-shaped upper notch 34 is formed in each of the plates 26 of the upper<br>
yoke 14 by an upper interior edge 36 and a V-shaped lower notch 38 is formed in each of<br>
the plates 28 of the lower yoke 16 by a lower interior edge 40. The upper interior edges 36<br>
in adjacent plates 26 of the upper yoke 14 have different depths for forming vertical lap<br>
joints with upper ends of inner leg plates 70 of the inner leg 22, as will be described more<br>
fully below. Similarly, the lower interior edges 40 in adjacent plates 28 of the lower yoke 16<br>
have different depths for forming vertical lap joints with lower ends of the inner leg plates<br>
70 of the inner leg 22, as will be described more fully below. The upper notches 34 form an<br>
upper groove 46 in the upper yoke 14, while the lower notches 38 form a lower groove 48<br>
in the lower yoke 14. The upper groove 46 is located inwardly from the outer side 14b,<br>
and the lower groove 48 is located inwardly from the outer side 16b. The upper and lower<br>
grooves 46, 48 extend in the stacking directions of the upper and lower yokes 14, 16,<br>
respectively.<br>
[0019]	The first outer leg 18 comprises a stack of the plates 30, while the second<br>
outer leg 20 comprises a stack of the plates 32. The plates 30, 32 have varying widths so<br>
as to provide the first and second outer legs 18, 20 with cruciform cross-sections. More<br>
specifically, the plates 30 are arranged in sections 50 of different widths and the plates 32<br>
are arranged in sections 52 of different widths. In each section 50, the plates 30 have the<br>
same width and in each section 52, the plates 32 have the same width. For example, and<br>
withreference now to Fig. 2, the first outer leg 18 has sections 50a,b,c,d,e,f, g of the plates<br>
30 that in a forward to rearward direction, first successively increase in width and, then<br>
after the midpoint, successively decrease in width. The sections 50a-g each comprise one<br>
or more groups of plates 30. Thus, the outermost.plates 30 in sections 50a and 50g each<br>
have a width W1, which is the smallest of the widths of the plates 30, and the plates 30 in<br>
the middle section 50d each have a width Wn, which is the largest of the widths of the<br>
plates 30. The thickness of the sections 50a-g in the stacking direction may vary. For<br>
example, as shown, the center section 50d may be substantially thicker than the other<br>
sections 50a,b,c,e,f,g. Although not shown, it should be appreciated that the sections 52 of<br>
5<br><br>
WO 2006/105024	PCTAJS2006/011120<br>
the second outer leg 20 have the same arrangement as the sections 50 of the first outer<br>
leg 18.<br>
[0020]	Within each section 50, 52, the plates 30, 32 are arranged in groups of the<br>
same number as the. plates 26, 28. Each of the plates 30, 32 is composed of grain-<br>
oriented silicon steel and has a thickness in a range of from about 7 mils to about 14 mils,<br>
with the particular thickness being selected based on the application of the transformer.<br>
The plates 30,32 each have a unitary construction and are trapezoidal in shape. In each of<br>
the plates 30, 32, opposing ends of the plate 30, 32 are mitered at oppositely-directed<br>
angles of about 45°, thereby providing the plate 30, 32 with major and minor side edges.<br>
The lengths of the plates 30 are not all the same and the lengths of the plates 32 are not<br>
all the same. More specifically, the lengths within each group of plates 30 are different and<br>
the lengths within each group of plates 32 are different. The pattern of different lengths is<br>
the same for each group of plates 30 and the pattern of different lengths is the same for<br>
each group of plates 32. The difference in lengths within each group permits the formation<br>
of the multi-step joints with the plates 28 of the first and second outer legs 18, 20, as will be<br>
described more fully below.<br>
[0021]	Referring now to Fig. 3 there is shown an enlarged view of the connection<br>
(represented by reference number 54) between the lower end of the first outer leg 18 and<br>
the first end of the lower yoke 16. The ends of the plates 30 form multi-step lap joints 56<br>
with the ends of the plates 28 of the lower yoke 16. For example, and with reference now<br>
also to Fig. 5, first through fourth plates 30a-d of the section 50a of the first outer leg 18<br>
form joints 56a-d with first through fourth plates 28a-d of the lower yoke 16. Since the<br>
plates 30a-d in the first section 50a are narrower than the plates 28a-d, the joints 56a-d do<br>
not extend the entire length of the mitered ends of the plates 28a-d, as is shown. The first<br>
through fourth plates 30a-d of the first outer leg 18 and the first through fourth plates 28a-d<br>
of the lower yoke 16 are located successively inward. The first through fourth plates 30a-d<br>
of the first outer leg 18 have successively longer lengths, whereas the first through fourth<br>
plates 28a-d of the lower yoke 16 have successively shorter lengths. With this construction,<br>
the first plate 28a overlaps the joint 56b between the second plates 28b, 30b, the second<br>
plate 28b overlaps the joint 56c between the third plates 28c, 30c and the third plate 28c<br>
6<br><br>
WO 2006/105024	PCT/US2006/011120<br>
overlaps the joint 56d between the fourth plates 28d, 30d. Although not shown, this pattern<br>
is repeated for the other groups of plates 30 in the first outer leg 18 and the corresponding<br>
other groups of plates 28 in the lower yoke 16. In this manner, the joints 56 that are formed<br>
between the plates 28 of the lower yoke 16. and the plates 30 of the first outer leg 18 are<br>
multi-step lap joints, with plates 28 of the lower yoke 16 overlapping plates 30 of the first<br>
outer leg 18, respectively.<br>
[0022]	The other connections (represented by reference numerals 58, 60, 62)<br>
between the first and second outer legs 18,20 and the upper and lower yokes 14,16 are<br>
constructed in the same manneras the connection 54 so as to have multi-step lap joints. It<br>
should be appreciated, however, that the connections 54, 58, 60, 62 may have a different<br>
type of construction. For example, instead of the connections 54, 58, 60, 62 having a four<br>
step lap joint pattern, the connections54, 58, 60, 62 may have a seven, or other number<br>
step lap joint pattern. In addition, instead of having plates 26, 28 of the upper and lower<br>
yokes 14, 16 overlapping'plates 30, 32 of the first and second outer legs 18, 20, plates 30,<br>
32 of the first and second outer legs 18, 20 may overlap plates 26, 28 of the upper and<br>
lower yokes 14, 16.<br>
[0023]	The inner leg 22 comprises a stack of inner leg plates 70. The inner leg<br>
plates 70 have varying widths so as to provide the inner leg 22 with a cruciform cross-<br>
section. More specifically; the inner leg plates 70 are arranged in sections 72 of different<br>
widths, wherein in each section 72, the inner leg plates 70 have the same width. This is<br>
best illustrated in Fig. 4, which shows the inner leg 22 having sections 72a,b,c,d,e,f, g of<br>
the inner leg plates 70 that in a forward to rearward direction, first successively increase in<br>
width and, then after the midpoint, successively decrease in width. The sections 72a-g<br>
each comprise one or more groups of inner leg plates 70. Thus, the outermost inner leg<br>
plates 70 in sections 72a and 72g each have a width W1, which is the smallest of the<br>
widths of the inner leg plates 70, and the inner leg plates 70 in the middle section 72d each<br>
have a width Wn, which is the largest of the widths of the inner (eg plates 70. As with the<br>
first and second outer legs 18, 20, the thickness of the sections 72a-g in the stacking<br>
direction may vary. For example, as shown, the center section 72d may be substantially<br>
thicker than the other sections 72a,b,c,e,f,g.<br>
7<br><br>
WO 2006/105024	PCT/US2006/011120<br>
[0024]	Within each section 72, the inner leg plates 70 are arranged in groups of the<br>
same number as the plates 26,28 (e.g. four). Each of the inner leg plates 70 is composed<br>
of grain-oriented silicon steel and has a thickness in a range of from about 7 mils to about<br>
14 mils, with the particular thickness being selected based on the application of the<br>
transformer 10. The inner leg plates 70 each have a unitary construction and include upper<br>
and lower pointed ortined ends, wherein each of the upper and lower tined ends is formed<br>
by a pair of miter cuts of about 45° each. The inner leg plates 70 may all have the same<br>
length if the joints are offset by vertically shifting the inner leg plates 70. Alternately, the<br>
inner leg plates 70 may have a plurality of different lengths if the joints are offset by the<br>
different lengths of adjacent inner leg plates 70.<br>
[0025]	Referring now to Fig. 5, when the lower end of the inner leg 22 is disposed in<br>
the lower groove 48, the ends of first, second,,third and fourth inner leg plates 70a, b, c, d<br>
of section 72a abut (form joints with) the lower interior edges 40a,b,c,d of the first, second,<br>
third and fourth plates 28a, b, c, d of the lower yoke 16, respectively. The first through<br>
fourth inner leg plates 70a-d are vertically offset such that lower ends thereof are located<br>
successively farther downward. In order to accommodate these differences in length, the<br>
lower interior edges 40a,b,c,d of the plates 28a-d are cut successively deeper. With this<br>
construction, the first plate 28a overlaps the joint between the second inner leg plate 70b<br>
and the second plate 28b, the second plate 28b overlaps the joint between the third inner<br>
leg plate 70c and the third plate 28c, and the third plate 28c overlaps the joint between the<br>
fourth inner leg plate 70d and the fourth plate 28d. Although not shown, this pattern is<br>
repeated for the other groups of inner leg plates 70 in the inner leg 22 and the<br>
corresponding other groups of plates 28 in the lower yoke 16. In this manner, vertical multi-<br>
step lap joints are formed between the plates 28 of the lower yoke 16 and the inner leg<br>
plates 70 of the inner leg 22, with plates 28 of the lower yoke 16 overlapping plates 70 of<br>
the inner leg 22.<br>
[0026]	Since the lower ends of the first through fourth inner leg plates 70a-d of the<br>
inner leg 22 are located successively farther downward, upper ends of the first through<br>
fourth inner leg plates 70a,b,c,d of the inner leg 22 are located successively farther<br>
downward. As a result, the upper interior edges 36 (and, thus, the upper notches 34) of the<br>
8<br><br>
WO 2006/105024	PCT/US2006/011120<br>
plates 26 within each group are successively shallower, which is the inverse of the lower<br>
yoke 16. With this construction, vertical multi-step lap joints are formed between the plates<br>
26 of the upper yoke 14 and the inner leg plates 70 of the inner leg 22, with inner leg plates<br>
70 overlapping plates 26 of the upper yoke 14.<br>
[0027]	It should be appreciated that the inner leg plates 70 of the inner leg 22 may<br>
be offset differently so as to have plates 26 of the upper yoke 14 overlapping inner leg<br>
plates 70 and inner leg plates 70 overlapping plates 28 of the lower yoke 16. In addition,<br>
the inner leg plates 70 may be offset to form a seven orother number step lap joint pattern,<br>
instead of the four step lap joint pattern.<br>
[0028]	In the embodiment where the inner leg plates 70 have different lengths,<br>
vertical multi-step lap joints are formed between the plates 26, 28 of the upper and lower<br>
yokes 14, 16 in a manner similar to that described above, however, the upper interior<br>
edges 36 (and thus the upper notches 34) of the plates 26 of the upper yoke 14 may have<br>
the same arrangement as the lower interior edges 40 (and thus the lower notches 38) of<br>
the plates 28 of the lower yoke 16 with regard to depth, because there is no vertical shifting<br>
of the inner leg plates 70.<br>
[0029]	The method of assembling the core 12 is dependent on the size of the core<br>
12. If the core 12 is large, such as would be the case if the transformer 10 was greater<br>
than 3000 kva, the core 12 is assembled with the lower yoke 16, the inner leg 22 and the<br>
first'and second outer legs 18, 20 initially being disposed horizontally, i.e., the lower yoke<br>
16, the inner leg 22 and the first and second outer legs 18, 20 are stacked in a vertical<br>
direction. In such a case the core 12 is assembled on a mounting fixture in a plurality of<br>
layers. In a first layer, a group of plates 28 is laid on the mounting fixture, with the major<br>
side disposed outwardly. Next, a group of plates 30 and a group of plates 32 are laid on<br>
the mounting fixture, with their major sides disposed outwardly and their ends abutting the<br>
ends of the group of plates 28, respectively, to form multi-step lap joints. A group of offset<br>
inner leg plates 70 are then laid on the mounting fixture, with the tined lower ends of the<br>
inner leg plates 70 abutting the lower interior edges 40 of the plates 28, respectively, to<br>
form multi-step vertical lap joints. This laying process is repeated for each layer until a<br>
desired stacking configuration is achieved. Once the lower yoke 16, the inner leg 22 and<br>
9<br><br>
WO 2006/105024	PCT/US2006/011120<br>
the first and second outer legs 18, 20 have been formed, the lower yoke 16 is clamped<br>
between a pair of end frames or supports 76 and bands 78 are disposed around the inner<br>
leg 22 and the first and second outer legs 18,20, respectively, as shown in Fig. .6. The<br>
partially formed core 12 is then moved to an upright position so that the inner leg 22 and<br>
 the first and second outer legs 18,20 extend vertically. Coil windings 80 are then disposed<br>
over the inner leg 22 and the first and second outer legs 18, 20, respectively. The upper<br>
yoke 14 is then stacked in groups of plates 26 onto the ends of the inner leg 22 and the<br>
first and second outer legs 18, 20.<br>
[0030]	If the core 12 is smaller, such as would be the case if the transformer 10 was<br>
less than 3000 kva, the core 12 is assembled in a similar manner as described above,<br>
except the core 12 is formed while being disposed vertically, i.e., the components of the<br>
core 12 are stacked in a horizontal direction.<br>
[0031]	After the core 12 with the coil windings 80 is fully constructed, the core 12 is<br>
enclosed within a housing (not shown). If the transformer 10 is an oil-filled type of<br>
transformer, the core 12 is immersed in oil within a compartment in the housing. If the<br>
transformer 10 is a dry-type of transformer, the core 12 is not immersed in oil and the<br>
housing is provided with louvers to permit air to enter the housing and pass over the core<br>
12.<br>
[0032]	Although the assembly of the core 12 set forth above describes three coil<br>
windings 80 being mounted to the core 12, such as occurs when the transformer 10 is a<br>
three-phase transformer, it should be appreciated that in another embodiment, a single coil<br>
winding 80 may be mounted to the inner leg 22 of the core 12, such as occurs when the<br>
transformer 10 is a single phase transformer.<br>
[0033]	Referring now to Fig. 7, there is shown a core 84 embodied in accordance<br>
with a second embodiment of the present invention. The core 84 has substantially the<br>
same construction, is constructed in substantially the same manner and may be used in a<br>
transformer in substantially the same manner as the core 12, except for the differences set<br>
forth below. Instead of having the inner leg 22, the core 84 has an inner leg 86, which<br>
comprises a firststack 88 of inner leg plates 90 and a second stack 92 of inner leg plates<br>
90. The first and second stacks 88, 92 abut each other along a seam 94 that extends in the<br>
10<br><br>
WO 2006/105024	PCT/US2006/011120<br>
longitudinal direction of the inner leg 86. Upper ends of the first and second stacks 88, 92<br>
are disposed in the upper groove 46 of the upper yoke 14 and lower ends of the first and<br>
second stacks 88, 92 are disposed in the lower groove 48 of the loweryoke 16. Each of the<br>
inner leg plates 90 has a unitary construction and is trapezoidal in shape. In each of the<br>
inner leg plates 90, opposing ends of the inner leg plate 90 are mitered at oppositely-<br>
directed angles of about 45°, thereby providing the inner leg plate 90 with major and minor<br>
side edges. In each layer of the inner leg 86, a major side edge of an inner leg plate 90 of<br>
the first stack 88 abuts a major side edge of an inner leg plate 90 of the second stack 92.<br>
With this orientation, the two mitered ends of the abutting inner leg plates 90 at each end<br>
of the layer cooperate to provide the end of the layer with a pointed ortined configuration.<br>
[0034]	The inner leg plates 90 have varying widths so as to provide the inner leg 86<br>
with a cruciform cross-section. More specifically, the inner leg plates 90 are arranged in<br>
sections 96 of different widths, wherein each section 96 comprises a portion of the first<br>
stack 88 and an adjacent portion of the second stack 92. The inner leg plates 90 in each<br>
section 96 have the same width. In each of the first and second stacks 88, 92, the major<br>
side edges of the inner leg plates 90,are aligned at the seam 94. The different widths,<br>
however, cause the minor sides to be offset, which helps form the cruciform cross-section<br>
of the inner leg 86.<br>
[0035]	The inner leg plates 90 in each section 96 may be cut from the same roll of<br>
metal in the manner described in co-pending U.S. Patent Application<br>
No.	filed on the same date herewith and entitled "ATRANSFORMER<br>
HAVING A STACKED CORE WITH A SPLIT LEG AND A METHOD OF MAKING THE<br>
SAME", which is assigned to the assignee of the present invention and is hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
[0036]	Referring now to Fig. 8, there is shown a core 100 embodied in accordance<br>
with a third embodiment of the present invention. The core 100 has substantially the same<br>
construction, is constructed in substantially the same manner and may be used in a<br>
transformer in substantially the same manner as the core 12, except for the differences set<br>
forth below. Instead of having only one inner leg 22, like the core 12, the core 100 has<br>
three inner legs 22. In addition, the core 100 has first and second outer legs 102,104 with<br>
 11<br><br>
WO 2006/105024	PCT/US2006/011120<br>
rectangular cross-sections, instead of cruciform cross-sections, as in the core 12. Also, the<br>
core 100 has upperand lower yokes 106,108, each of which is comprised of a plurality of<br>
stacks of plates, instead of only a single stack, as in the core 12. Further, the upper yoke<br>
106 of the core 100 has three upper grooves 46a, b, c and the lower yoke 108 of the core<br>
100 has three lower grooves 48a, b,c, instead of a single upper groove 46 and a single<br>
lower groove 48, as in the core 12. With the construction described above, the coil<br>
windings 80 are mounted to the three inner legs 22 of the core 100, respectively.<br>
[0037]	The upper yoke 106 comprises a center stack 110 of plates 112 and first and<br>
second outer stacks 114, 116 of plates 118. Similarly, the lower yoke 108 comprises a<br>
center stack 120 of plates 122 and first and second outer stacks 124, 126 of plates 130.<br>
Each of the plates 112, 122 is elongated and has opposing fined ends. Each of the plates<br>
118, 130 is trapezoidal in shape and has opposing ends mitered at oppositely-directed<br>
angles of about 45°. In the upper yoke 106, an inner end of the first outer stack 114<br>
cooperates with a first end of the center stack 110 to define the upper groove 46a, while an<br>
inner end of the second outer stack 116 cooperates with a second end of the center stack<br>
110 to define the upper groove 46c. Similarly, in the lower yoke 108, an inner end of the<br>
first outer stack 124 cooperates with a first end of the center stack 120 to define the lower<br>
groove 48a, while an inner end of the second outer stack 126 cooperates with a second<br>
end of the center stack 120 to define the lower groove 48c. The upper groove 46b is<br>
formed in the center stack 110, and the lower groove 48b is formed in the center stack 120.<br>
[0038]	In the upper yoke 106, the first and second outer stacks 114,116 may simply<br>
abut the center stack 110, i.e., form seams with the center stack 110, or the plates 118 of<br>
the first and second outer stacks 114, 116 may form multi-step lap joints with the plates<br>
112 of the center stack 110. Similarly, in the lower yoke 108, the first and second outer<br>
stacks 124, 126 may simply abut the center stack 120, i.e., form seams with the center<br>
stack 120, or the plates 130 of the first and second outer stacks 124,126 may form multi-<br>
step lap joints with the plates 122 of the center stack 120.<br>
[0039]	A transformer core embodied in accordance with the present invention<br>
provide a number of benefits over conventional transformer cores. For example, providing<br>
the transformer core with legs having cruciform cross-sections increases the strength of the<br>
12<br><br>
WO 2006/105024	PCT/US2006/011120<br>
core and provides the legs with larger surface areas for supporting coil windings, while<br>
providing the transformer core with yokes having rectangular cross-sections simplifies the<br>
construction of the yokes (and, thus, the core) and reduces the amount of metal wasted in<br>
constructing the yokes (and, thus, the core).<br>
