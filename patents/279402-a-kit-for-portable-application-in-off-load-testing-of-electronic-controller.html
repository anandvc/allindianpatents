				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to Electronic Controller (EC) for Electrostatic Precipitator<br>
(ESP) in general and to a test kit for portable application in off-load testing of<br>
Electronic Controllers, in particular.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The Electronic Controller (EC) is an integral part of Electrostatic Precipitator (ESP)<br>
used in Thermal Power stations for reducing pollution mainly caused by fly ash<br>
produced after combustion of Coal in the Boiler. The Electrostatic Precipitator unit<br>
comprises of a Electronic Controller, HVR (High Voltage Rectiformer) and the<br>
Precipitator refer fig 1(a). The Electronic Controller is a microprocessor based<br>
controller, which is used to achieve a High Voltage Constant Current. The constant<br>
current ensures optimum collection of ash particles on the collecting electrode.<br>
The testing of Electronic Controller involves wiring check, functional testing, no<br>
load testing, full load testing, calibration of meters, annunciation test etc. This<br>
takes minimum 4-5 hrs to prove the healthiness of the panel.<br>
Conventionally, refer fig 1(a), the testing of Electronic Controller is done by<br>
connecting each Electronic Control Panel, microprocessor based controller<br>
commonly known as BAPCON &amp; HVR (High Voltage Rectiformer) received form<br>
other sources. These equipments are project specific. So every time, due to<br>
change of rating, set-up has to be changed. BAPCON is very complex and sensitive<br>
equipment and it gets damaged due to any error in wiring. The output of HVR<br>
(High Voltage Rectiformer) is fed to resistance load bank for full load testing. The<br>
 <br>
amount of energy dissipated in load bank, while testing one panel at 95 kV DC<br>
peak and 1400 mA for 2-3 hrs, was about 200 kWhr considering about 800 to<br>
1000 panels are manufactured per year, the total energy consumption per annum<br>
due to this testing is estimated about 200 MWhr. To bridge the power gap, more<br>
number of thermal power plants are being set up and this quantity of panels will<br>
be in multiple of 2-3 times. Further there will be more dependency on HVR and<br>
BAPCON received from other sources for testing of Electronic Control Panel. There<br>
is only one test bed to test the panel. The panel has to be moved to the testing<br>
area by crane for complete testing of the panel as the other associated<br>
equipments, which are bulky and fixed at test bed area.<br>
In existing method of testing there was much dependency on other associated<br>
equipments for testing viz. HVR, input voltage regulator, the load bank and the<br>
microprocessor based controller, say BAPCON.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
This method had the following disadvantages:-<br>
1)	During the full load testing of Electronic Controller certain energy is<br>
consumed, which is a national loss.<br>
2)	Load Bank resistor is continuously cooled by fan. After excessive heating<br>
we have to stop the testing for some time.<br>
3)	There is regular maintenance of load bank due failure of resistance.<br>
4)	In case of defect in the wiring, it damages the BAPCON and other<br>
components.<br>
5)	The testing personnel have to operate at full voltage of 70/95 kV DC and<br>
full power which was hazardous.<br>
6)	Only one test bed is available, so only one panel can be tested at a time.<br>
 <br>
7) Every panel is to be shifted to the test bed area before and after testing by<br>
crane.<br>
To overcome above disadvantages, a portable Off-Load Test Kit was explored and<br>
invented for testing of Electronic Controller.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invented method has many advantages such as<br>
1)	No BAPCON, no HVR, no high voltage load bank required for testing.<br>
2)	No need of checking wiring manually.<br>
3)	Being portable test kit, the panel can be tested &amp; calibrated at the place of<br>
wiring at the location of the panel.<br>
4)	All circuits can be tested independently so there is no cross linking of faults.<br>
It saves other components.<br>
5)	All faults in the EC panel can be isolated.<br>
6)	Saving of power (EC panel tested at low power testing).<br>
7)	Saving of time (time for connection and disconnection to power, load bank<br>
and BAPCON saved).<br>
8)	Saving of man power (only one person required to test the job).<br>
9)	Enhanced safety.<br>
10)So far 1000 panels have been tested with the kit.<br>
ll)Every year approximately 200 MWh energy will be saved which will be a<br>
national gain, further if this electricity was being generated in thermal<br>
power station, it would have resulted in emission of about 250 tons of<br>
carbon dioxide.<br>
 <br>
The invention will now be described with the help of accompanying drawings<br>
which depict as exemplary embodiment of invention. However, there can be other<br>
embodiments all of which are deemed covered by the description.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF A PREFERRED EMBODIMENT OF THE<br>
INVENTION<br>
With the invented design of portable Off-Load test kit refer fig 2(a); the use of<br>
BAPCON, HVR and the load bank has been eliminated fully; coupled with the<br>
elimination of panel movement to the test bed. A kit (1) as shown in fig 2(b) has<br>
been developed which houses a single phase transformer (2) for input supply 0-<br>
415 V AC, Power Supply card (3), Firing Circuit card (4) for firing of thyristors in<br>
the Electronic Control Panel, single phase step down transformer (11) for light<br>
load, a single phase bridge rectifier (10), a light load resistor (9), AC Current meter<br>
(5), AC Voltmeter (6), DC Milliampere meter (7), DC Kilovoltmeter (8), set of LEDs<br>
(light emitting diodes)(12), for fault annunciation and set of micro-switches (13)<br>
for control command to Electronic Controller. The calibration of meters is provided<br>
by voltage and current feedback generated with in kit through a light load resistor<br>
(9). Other commands, faults and annunciation are simulated with the help of<br>
micro-switches and LEDs.<br>
