Field of the invention<br>
This invention relates to an interfacing device for manufacturing-productivity monitoring including interfacing with material processing machines for tracking of process related events including time-stamping and facilitating operator input of diverse parameters to monitor and measure man-machine productivity.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Competitiveness in the manufacturing sector is not only determined by high rate of product and process innovations but also by effective and optimized shop floor operations thereby demanding maximized man-machine productivity which would be facilitated by near real-time reliable monitoring of diverse parameters such as machine downtime, causes of breakdown, etc.<br>
Globally, Total Productivity Maintenance (TPM) uses Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) as a measure of productivity, determined as<br>
OEE % = Availability (B/A) x Performance (D/C) x Quality (F/E)<br>
wherein A= Planned Production time; B = Actual Running Time; C = Theoretical Machine Running Speed; D = Actual Production rate; E = Pieces Produced and F = Good Parts produced.<br>
It is therefore imperative that one should be able to monitor diverse parameters such as stoppage, speed of production, wastage, etc in near real-time to introduce mid-course corrections during the production process.<br>
Targeting any one of these three key areas for improvement, Availability, Performance or Quality, may seem a major task and addressing all three together may seem near impossible. However, somehow if these areas can be addressed simultaneously then significant improvements can be made, output can be increased, product variation can be expanded and production cost reductions can be achieved.<br>
OEE % = Availability % x Performance % x Quality %<br>
Availability % = actual running time / planned cell production time<br>
Performance % = pieces produced / the theoretical cell production rate<br>
Quality % = good pieces / total pieces made<br>
Calculating OEE is simple but tricky it focuses on individual items of process and allows their 'effectiveness' to be measured individually - machine wise or in groups (i.e. cells or entire plants). The OEE calculation is based on the product of all the three key production parameters, Availability, Performance, and Quality.<br>
Traditionally, production data is manually collected from machines and analyzed offline and therefore scheduling decisions have to be made on the basis of this old<br><br>
data related to actual cycle times, load / unload times, durations and causes of machine downtime.<br>
General purpose and special purpose data acquisition terminals are available for data collecting and data transporting functions that can be accessed in various internet sites including http://www.shoploqix.com and http://www.predator-software.com. Such systems are designed to capture and process variety of information from CNC machines and serve their purpose well in an environment where operator input is not required to record the diverse inputs that are vital for analyzing machine productivity.<br>
Off the shelf general purpose data collecting devices like PLCs and data transporting devices like serial to Ethernet communications converters are available for the purpose of tracking events and transporting them to central computing systems. These devices are excellent for the simple purpose of data collection and data transportation and are not designed to work beyond these two designed functions rwww.moxa.coml.<br>
To obtain all the relevant information for purposes of obtaining OEE for diverse machines performing diverse operations especially in the machine tools sector following aspects are essential:<br>
1.	Collection of production data in real time from CNC machines as well as conventional machines. E.g., capturing production data as it happens, in real time - number of parts made, target quantity, hourly rate of production.<br>
2.	Accuracy of production data from CNC machines as well as conventional machines. E.g. capturing production data accurately and removing the risks that exist of wrong recorded data leading to wrong decision making. To avoid this, data must be tracked directly through electronic signals from the machine.<br>
3.	Accurate collection of cutting and idle times from CNC machines as well as conventional machines. E.g. recording cutting and idle times of machines as they occur: cutting cycle times, part loading and unloading times, idle times -part setup, maintenance breakdown, inspection.<br>
4.	Recording of reasons for machine downtime from CNC machines as well as conventional machines. E.g. recording the reasons for machine downtime periods, as and when they occur.<br>
5.	Inspection data collection direct from the machine. Capturing inspection data in real time - number of good parts, rejected parts, reworked parts and measured values of critical dimensions.<br>
6.	Making data collected from machines available immediately to a computerized network so that it can be analyzed and acted upon. The key to proper decision-making is the availability of accurate shop floor data as the events occur. Speed of data delivery is vital.<br><br>
7.	Record traceability of parts and assist in tracing the source of a manufacturing defect on a part to a specific machine or a batch or cell after the part has been shipped out.<br>
8.	Continuous feedback to operator on his performance helps the operator to do self assessment and adjust his rate of production to achieve pre-set batch or shift targets. Providing current production figures in real-time to the machine operator is very important to his performance.<br>
9.	Collection of data for cutting tool inserts usage pattern for studying the number of inserts used and the time taken to change each insert. This data can be analyzed and used for selecting the proper cutting tool, predicting tool life and to determine the optimal cutting parameters.<br>
10.	Must be flexible and capable of quick installation using wireless communication protocols. Machine tool is moved around in the shop frequently therefore the device must be also be moved around with the machine tool to suit modified cell layouts in shop floor. Avoiding laying and maintaining of cables for data communication in a shop floor is important.<br>
11.	Must be capable of sending information quickly from the machine and have the ability to record/send reasons for machine downtime quickly to the central database without wasting much time in the process of sending itself. Should prevent dependence on machine operator's non-volatile memory and writing skills to manually record.<br>
12.	Must be capable of receiving information at the machine for the benefit of the machine operator. This closes the information loop and seeks to deliver information to the operator to take corrective steps based on the current production status. Example: special instructions like telling him to change the tool when its life is over; remind him to inspect the part if periodic inspection is required; tell him about his current production rate, shortfall, quality performance.<br>
13.	Must be capable of interfacing with all the diverse machines with a common device for simplifying operating procedures, training and maintenance. Diverse machines include- CNC, PLC based and conventional machines or any other material-processing machine, automatic, semi-automatic or manual machine.<br>
14.	Should be capable of operating 24x7 and independent of the host PC. Keeping the host computer up and running continuously for 24x7 operations in a shopfloor environment is not possible always. The data collected needs to be temporarily stored for the periods when the computer network is down and is therefore unable to receive the data. When the computer comes up again the device must be able to automatically synchronize and send the data.<br>
Several attempts to interface devices with machines especially in the machine tools sector have been made in prior art but they fail to comprehensively address all the aspects required to obtain OEE.<br><br>
US Patent Application 2004260481 describes a Method for monitoring a machine and such a machine, particularly a robot in which at I east two different measured quantities are detected and at least one of these measured quantities is processed to a first measure result in such a way that it is comparable with another measured quantity or a second measure result obtained on the basis thereof, that the first measure result is compared with another measured quantity or a measure result obtained on the basis thereof and that a signal characterizing the comparison result is provided.<br>

When the moving pulses of<br><br>
respective X, Y and Z axes and the like from pulse signal generators provided for a NC machine tool, are read in by a digital computer so as to be counted, the machine positions at present are thereby detected. And information on the intended operation paths of the NC machine tool is inputted out of a keyboard, so that it is thereby stored in a hard desk device. The difference between each counted value of the digital counter and each intended operation path is operated at high speeds by a co-processor to judge whether or not the machine tool is in a good operating condition. And when the operation of the machine tool is found to have been unsatisfactory, a machine operation suspension signal is directed by means of the parallel contact outputs of a D/O interface, so that the operation of the NC machine is thereby suspended. The aforesaid check is repeatedly processed at high speeds.<br>
SE525034 discloses a Method for monitoring a production process and for ascertaining the number of manufactured products, requires automatically determining the presence of a tool of the production machine in a first or in a second state wherein monitoring of production process can be carried out more accurately by equipping each production machine with sensors indicating the status of the machine e.g. tool open, tool closed, machine in fully automatic operation, machine in manual operation, and assigning a code to the various tools, and detecting an identification code for the actual tool in the machine etc, and by eliminating errors when ascertaining the number of manufactured parts.<br>
DE19802728 describes Machine parameter monitoring method for machine tool numerical control that provides redundant monitoring of the machine operating parameters using the 2 redundant processors (MCU, CCU) used for the machine tool numerical control, each providing a check sum (CRC1, CRC2) from the monitored parameters, compared with the previously calculated check sums obtained from a non-volatile memory, for initiating a fault procedure or halting the operation of the machine tool. An Independent claim for a machine parameter monitoring circuit for a machine tool numerical control is also provided.<br>
EP Patent 0737903 elaborates on a Method and device for monitoring machining on a machine-tool for use with work pieces of a conducting material, consists of a monitoring phase in which a voltage generator is connected between the tool holder and the work piece carrier to ensure an electrical contact between the tool and work piece. A fault signal is given out if the electrical contact is not correct, indicating that the tool is worn or the work piece is incorrectly positioned. The tool holder is isolated from the machine tool frame by insulators, while conductors form a circuit with the voltage generator and a current detector, which is linked to a comparator.<br>
JP9091014 describes a Method and device for monitoring machine tool to make it possible to monitor a current machine state in detail even from a position separated far from a machine tool by transmitting and displaying operation state information and an abnormality occurrence signal to an information receiving part arranged on a place separated from the machine tool through a telephone line. The machine number, the contents of the abnormality, etc., are quickly displayed by either one of numerals and characters or the combination of numerals and characters. When an information receiving part is a portable telephone set, the information of a monitored machine state is converted into a voice signal and transmitted.<br><br>

The cutting action may be turning, milling or a drill held in a chuck and operating on a work piece, wherein a carbon brush runs in contact with the chuck and leads connected respectively to the brush and work piece carry the e.m.f., produced by the cutting action.<br>
US Patent 3689839 discloses a Machine tool monitoring system for measuring the time during which a machine tool is performing useful work, such as cutting a work piece. During cutting, the work piece and a work member are in electrical contact with each other. But when both the work piece and work member are rotating with respect to each other and they are not cutting, they are electrically insulated from each other. An electrical circuit having a power source is connected to the machine tool. One terminal of the power source is electrically connected to the work piece and the other terminal is electrically connected to the work member. A first signal is detected during the rotation of the work piece and the work member with respect to each other and the time during which such rotation occurs is measured. A second signal is detected when the machine is performing work and the time during which the machine is performing work is measured.<br>
IL46438 describes a Method and apparatus for monitoring computer controlled machine tool systems wherein a diagnostic communication system for machine tools interlinks a computer controlled machine tool with diagnostic and analysis equipment located at a location remote from the machine tool. The computer associated with the machine tool is connected with the diagnostic apparatus over a telephone line, and the machine tool is caused to execute a predetermined routine as a result of<br><br>
instructions transmitted to the computer from the diagnostic apparatus. The operating characteristics of the machine are monitored during the operation of the machine, and are communicated to the diagnostic apparatus, where they are compared with corresponding characteristics previously collected for the same machine, and with design limit parameters. Such comparisons furnish an indication of the present operating condition of the machine tool, and establish trends, which are useful in identifying the nature and location of incipient faults or failures before they occur. The system is used both as a diagnostic tool for diagnosing abnormal machine conditions and as a preventative maintenance tool for performing preventative maintenance operations on a routine basis.<br>
US6302004 describes a Method and apparatus for increasing the productivity of CNC machine tools which has a turret, a reservoir of coolant, a pump supplying coolant under pressure from the reservoir to the turret, a tool holder mounted on the turret at a tool station opposite a rotatable spindle upon which a workpiece is mounted for a cutting operation to reduce the temperature gradient away from the friction face of the tool to prolong tool life and promote consistent chip breaking.<br>
WO2004053607 discloses a Computer-assisted production tracking system with production data traceability for one or more machines, whereby said machines consist of at least one primary real time system comprising at least one input which is connected to at least one machine and/or to at least one secondary real time system of the machine(s) and at least one output which is connected to at least one server. Moreover, the primary and/or secondary real time systems comprise a program, which can determine the operating mode of the aforementioned machine and/or the operating time in each of said modes. In addition, the server makes the above-mentioned information available to client computers. The invention is characterised in that the primary and/or secondary real time system(s) comprise a program which can (i) allocate a date and a time to each piece of dynamic information received and (ii) record said information in at least one timestamp file, such that the server can make said time-stamped information available to the client computers.<br>
JP2004355172 describes a Job shop type production system, tracking device, tracking method, program and recording medium to increase productivity by tracking presence information about work even if IDs can not be assigned direct to the work, in a product production line comprising a plurality of devices for work machining, assembly and the like including operators' operations of loading and removing work into and from the devices. The plurality of devices, assemblies / workpieces and operators are modeled, and from the modeling data and production plan data of the day, work loading and removing timing and operators' work allocation are decided. From the decision results, production performance and presence information about work are predicted in every device, and the production performance prediction is compared with actual production performance by the device, so that the determination of the presence information about the work provides accurate position tracking of the work.<br>
US2002065702 discloses a Real-time production tracking and scheduling system of enabling the management of an automotive repair shop to optimize production by computing a job completion target through optimally scheduling a sequence of tasks<br><br>
on the basis of the availability and historical efficiency of individual technicians and historical average idle time of technicians and vehicles during the performance of the job, and providing detailed performance data of individual technicians on individual jobs for problem evaluation if the computed optimized target is not met.<br>
JP9001446 discloses a Tracking method in production line to lessen the number of sensors as few as possible and miniaturize a system by dividing a line into blocks consisting of a plurality of continued stations and providing detecting means to detect the arrival of work pieces and means to indicate stored information at inlets of the respective blocks. When a work piece on a line reaches a predetermined block, the arrival is detected by a detecting means. The number of arrival work pieces is integrated in a program controller for tracking by the detecting means detecting the arrival, and the integrated number represents the order of the work piece. The work piece stored in a non-volatile memory means is called for on the basis of the order by the search from a terminal machine provided in the block. The operational information of the called-for work piece is searched by a server to be indicated on a display device provided in the block.<br>
Almost all the machine monitoring systems, methods and devices documented in the prior art are known to monitor statuses of various process and parameters like cutting tool behavior, bearing characteristics, spindle load, current or power consumption etc. Although a few of the prior art do capture machine process events they are limited to study their process characteristics and to determine if they are working as per designed parameters.<br>
US6999832 (B2) discloses a production machine with at least one signal output with the capability of transmitting production status information to a production control system or production monitoring system. Signal outputs of the production machine are picked up and the statuses of the signal outputs are passed on via data connections to an operator console. An operator manually transmits the obtained product status information via a data connection. Though this meets several of the requirements for a manufacturing-productivity monitoring system, the specification teaches the interfacing with a specific type of machine and is therefore limited to a type of machine only. The device is not generic and cannot be interfaced with any manufacturing system at will.<br>
The prior art therefore has several limitations namely:<br>
•	They do not address the problem of determining machine productivity indices or the measurement of productivity in terms of OEE. Only two of the required three vital data, Availability and Performance indices, can be captured. Quality / Inspection index has not hitherto been addressed.<br>
•	Lack of a human readable interface facility to the machine operator to input diverse information for maximizing productivity is not available.<br>
•	Absence of provision to input part tracking information through an external device.<br>
•	They cannot work independently, as in case of host PC off condition.<br>
•	Devices work in unidirectional information flow, that is machine to host only, the operator is uninformed and clueless of the current status.<br><br>
•	Devices are based on wired networks and aimed to work only with CNC machines. The devices in prior art cannot interface with conventional (non CNC) machines.<br>
•	Devices are incapable of interfacing with diverse machine interfaces. They have n o capability to be p rogrammed a nd therefore a re j ust d ata I oggers/ transporters. They also lack safety covers and are not advisable to be used in shop-floor conditions without coupling extra external safety devices.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a comprehensive interface device for manufacturing-productivity monitoring including interfacing with material processing machines and method to operate the said device so as to simultaneously capture and process transient information related to machine availability, performance and quality of the produced products from a manufacturing and / or processing means and transmit it to an analyzing system.<br>

Detailed Description of the invention<br>
The device comprises of a CPU (11), non-volatile memory (10), DRAM (16), Real Time Clock with power backup (12), Main serial port (1) with optical isolation (14), Auxiliary serial port (4), digital input lines (2) and analog input lines (3) with optical isolation (13), man-machine interface MMI with LCD display or touch screen graphics panel (7) and keypad (8), USB port (9), SDIO interface (34), network interface (30), speaker (6) and power supply (5).<br>
The processing engine (25) interfaces with an operating system (15) and performs the tasks of a) collecting information from the main serial port (1), auxiliary serial port (4), digital input /output lines (2), analog input/output lines (3), MMI keypad (8), USB port (9) and network interface (30) and b) sending out information through the touch screen graphics panel or LCD display (7), speaker (6) and network interface (30). The network interface (30) can adapt to use communication adapters of any communication systems like WiFi, Bluetooth, Infrared, Zigbee and Ethernet.<br>
When data is input into the device from any of the Input/Output interfaces (1,2,3,4,7,8,9) it is checked for validity.<br>
If the data comes as a stream of characters through any of the character Input/Output interfaces (1,4,8,9), it may consist of necessary and unnecessary characters. These characters are passed on to a character/ image-processing engine (23) through the serial port driver (20). The necessary characters are identified and extracted from the stream based on their being preceded by a valid pattern of header characters and succeeded by a valid pattern of footer characters. In the absence of a proper header, the data is assumed to be invalid and is rejected. If the data is valid, it is passed on to the processing engine (25). The header and footer are removed, and the residual pattern of characters is decoded to determine its meaning and to decide the next action.<br>
The data is then time-stamped with the date and time of its arrival into the device. The current date and time are retrieved from the real time clock (12), converted into a pattern of characters, and appended to the original pattern. This data is compressed and stored in the non-volatile memory (10).<br>
The characters are encrypted, formed into a packet of data and sent by the network communication engine (26) through the network communication device (30) to the host computer (31). If the host computer (31) and the network communication device (30) are active, the information is immediately transmitted. If either of these is not active, the information is retained in the non-volatile memory (10) till such time that<br><br>
they are active, and then transmitted. Stamping an event with the date and time of its occurrence is advantageous and necessary for storage and later transmission to the host computer. Encryption is advantageous for the purpose of information security during transmission.<br>
If the data comes as a digital signal through the digital Input/Output interface (2), it arrives in the form a change in the voltage in a wired circuit through the digital port driver (21). The change in voltage is detected by the digital engine (24) and decoded. Each digital line is pre-assigned to a specific state of the machine. The state of the machine corresponds to the change in voltage and is determined by whether the voltage has changed from low to high or vice-versa. The state of the machine is converted into a predefined character pattern and passed on to the processing engine (25). The data is then time-stamped with the date and time of its arrival into the device. The current date and time are retrieved from the real time clock (12), converted into a pattern of characters, and appended to the original pattern. This data is compressed and stored in the non-volatile memory (10).<br>
The characters are encrypted, formed into a packet of data and sent to the network communication engine (26) through the network communication device (30) to the host computer (31). If the host computer (31) and the network communication device (30) are active, the information is immediately transmitted. If either of these is not active, the information is retained in the non-volatile memory (10) till such time that they are active, and then transmitted. Stamping an event with the date and time of its occurrence is advantageous and necessary for storage and later transmission to the host computer. Encryption is advantageous for the purpose of information security during transmission.<br>
If the data comes as an analog voltage through the analog Input/Output interface (3), it i s i n t he form a v oltage v alue i n a w ired circuit. T he v oltage i s d etected by t he analog port driver (27), converted by the analog to digital converter (33) to a digital value and the digital value is passed on to the digital engine (24). Each analog line is pre-assigned to a specific parameter that is being measured on the machine, and the value of the voltage corresponds to the change in value of the parameter that is being measured. The value of the parameter is converted into a predefined character pattern and passed on to the processing engine (25). The data is then time-stamped with the date and time of its arrival into the device. The current date and time are retrieved from the real time clock (12), converted into a pattern of characters, and appended to the original pattern. This data is compressed and stored in the non-volatile memory (10).<br>
The characters are encrypted, formed into a packet of data and sent by the network communication engine (26) through the network communication device (30) to the host computer (31). If the host computer (31) and the network communication device (30) are active, the information is immediately transmitted. If either of these is not active, the information is retained in the non-volatile memory (10) till such time that they are active, and then transmitted. Stamping an event with the date and time of its occurrence is advantageous and necessary for storage and later transmission to the host computer. Encryption is advantageous for the purpose of information security during transmission.<br><br>
In one of the embodiments of the invention, the device is used to keep track of the current activity of a machine (28) through character data sent to the device by the said machine. Information arriving from the said machine (28) through the main serial port (1) may pertain to the events cycle start, cycle end, spindle on/off, tool change, axis on/axis off, pallet change, machine on/off or the start and end of any other event on the machine. Each event is sent as a different sequence of characters. The serial communication / port driver (20) collects this character sequence and sends it to the character/image engine (23), which processes the sequence to determine if it forms a qualified information packet. If it forms a qualified packet, it is sent to the processing engine (25). The data is then time-stamped with the date and time of its arrival into the device. The current date and time are retrieved from the real time clock (12), converted into a pattern of characters, and appended to the original pattern. This data is compressed and stored in the non-volatile memory (10).<br>
The characters are encrypted, formed into a packet of data and sent by the network communication engine (26) through the network communication device (30) to the host computer (31). If the host computer (31) and the network communication device (30) are active, the information is immediately transmitted. If either of these is not active, the information is retained in the non-volatile memory (10) till such time that they are active, and then transmitted.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the device is used to keep track of the current activity of a machine by reading the voltage levels of electrical signals on the said machine. Information arriving from the digital input lines (2) may pertain to the events cycle start, cycle end, spindle on/off, tool change, axis on/axis off, pallet change, machine on/off or the start and end of any other event on the machine. This information arrives in the form a change in the voltage in a wired circuit, and each event is sensed on a different line. The digital input monitor (21) continuously monitors the digital input lines (2). Whenever it senses a change in any of the input lines that signifies the occurrence of an event on the machine (28), it transports this information to the digital input-processing engine (24). The digital input-processing engine deciphers the information to determine the event that has occurred, and then converts this information into a qualified packet of text information and sends it to the processing engine (25). The data is then time-stamped with the date and time of its arrival into the device. The current date and time a re retrieved from the real time clock (12), converted into a pattern of characters, and appended to the original pattern. This data is compressed and stored in the non-volatile memory (10).<br>
The characters are encrypted, formed into a packet of data and sent by the network communication engine (26) through the network communication device (30) to the host computer (31). If the host computer (31) and the network communication device (30) are active, the information is immediately transmitted. If either of these is not active, the information is retained in the non-volatile memory (10) till such time that they are active, and then transmitted.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the device is used to receive process and communicate data arriving through the auxiliary serial port (4) from external data devices like bar code readers and inspection instruments, comparators and gauges. The data may pertain to part details like part identification, operator identification,<br><br>
batch quantity, shift and batch production targets, and measured inspection dimensions. This information arrives in the form a sequence of characters. The serial communication driver (20) collects this character sequence and sends it to the character/image engine (23), which processes the sequence to determine if it forms a qualified information packet and sends it to the processing engine (25). The data is then time-stamped with the date and time of its arrival into the device. The current date and time are retrieved from the real time clock (12), converted into a pattern of characters, and appended to the original pattern. This data is compressed and stored in the non-volatile memory (10).<br>
The characters are encrypted, formed into a packet of data and sent by the network communication engine (26) through the network communication device (30) to the host computer (31). If the host computer (31) and the network communication device (30) are active, the information is immediately transmitted. If either of these is not active, the information is retained in the non-volatile memory (10) till such time that they are active, and then transmitted.<br>
In yet another embodiment of the invention, the device receive, process and communicate data arriving from the MMI touch screen graphics panel or keypad (7,8), which has been entered by a machine operator. The data may pertain to operator identification, part identification, reason for machine downtime, measured values during inspection, quantity of parts rejected or reworked, tool change, consumable change, and SOS messages in emergencies. The data needs to be entered through the MMI touch screen graphics panel or keypad if there is no provision on a machine by which the data can be obtained automatically. The LCD and keypad drivers (18,19) continuously monitor the inputs from the MMI touch screen graphics panel or keypad (7,8). Whenever they detect a key press, they transport the information to the MMI interface-processing engine (22). The MMI interface-processing engine deciphers the information to determine the significance of the sequence of key presses, and then converts this information into a qualified packet of character information and sends it to the processing engine (25). The data is then time-stamped with the date and time of its arrival into the device. The current date and time are retrieved from the real time clock (12), converted into a pattern of characters, and appended to the original pattern. This data is compressed and stored in the non-volatile memory (10).<br>
The characters are encrypted, formed into a packet of data and sent by the network communication engine (26) through the network communication device (30) to the host computer (31). If the host computer (31) and the network communication device (30) are active, the information is immediately transmitted. If either of these is not active, the information is retained in the non-volatile memory (10) till such time that they are active, and then transmitted.<br>

The device of this invention can receive and process events which relate to the changing of cutting tools, cutting tool inserts, or any other consumables on the machine during the course of processing material. A particular example is the determining of tool life, production yield per tool, tool cost statistics and reduction of these costs to improve profitability. Using the touch screen graphics panel (7) or MMI keypad (8) an operator can enter any event related to changes in tools, such as the name of the tool changed, quantity of inserts changed, manufacturer etc. This information can be entered as text or may be selected from a menu of pre-entered options that is stored in the non-volatile memory (10).

The touch screen graphics panel (7) or MMI keypad (8) can be used by the operator to enter the relevant data when an event occurs. The SOS message can be entered as text or selected from a menu of pre-entered options that is stored in the non-volatile memory (10) and displayed on LCD or touch screen graphics panel (7). Information from the touch screen graphics panel (7) or MMI keypad (8) arrives in the form of characters and is then processed as explained earlier. The host computer can then take appropriate action based on the type of emergency - send an email to a pre-defined email address, send an SMS to a mobile phone, activate a hooter or activate an electronic display.<br>
The automatically tracked information on machine events got through the main serial port(1) and digital inputs (2) or analog inputs (3) can be supplemented by visual images, which can be still images from a digital camera of a vision inspection system or continuous video images from a surveillance system. This information arrives as digital image data. The USB communication driver (32) collects the data and sends it to the USB/Ethernet engine (29), which in turn sends it to the processing engine (25) from where it is sent to the host computer (31) through the network communicator (26) and the networking device (30).<br>
The device can display the current state of the machine and show comparisons between the actual state and the required ideal state. It can show on the touch screen graphics panel (7) or MMI keypad (8) information in text or graphics such as the operator's performance in terms of actual number of parts made versus target, prompt him to change an insert when its life is over, prompt him to inspect a part if periodic inspection is required and prompt him to adhere to a pre-decided maintenance time-table. The visual alerts and messages are reinforced with audio alerts on the speaker (6).<br>
The invention device displays critical information on a large LED display or a wide-screen public monitor so that the information can be viewed over long distances on production shop floors. This is particularly beneficial for data like machine breakdown alerts sent to maintenance personnel, and actual versus targeted production which<br><br>
is done by sending text and graphics data through the auxiliary serial port (4), USB port (9), or wirelessly through the network interface (30).<br>
The device can capture and process all information from a machine or mechanism that is required to calculate the Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE). Data for the three primary components of OEE - Availability, Performance and Quality - can be simultaneously and continuously captured and fed to a production monitoring system running on a host computer.<br>
The device can send critical information to mobile phones through SMS, or email it to specified email addresses. This is particularly beneficial for machine breakdown alerts sent to key personnel in the maintenance department, notification of shortfalls in production, performance indices, and measured parameters like temperature going out of range. Data is acquired and sent out through a GPRS modem interfaced to the invention through the network interface (30).<br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
