				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a spool loading mechanism in a lap former used in textile industry. More particularly, the invention is concerned about loading spools into the spool magazine from the trolley by way of subjecting the spool to a swing at an appropriate angle by means of spool loader means such that there is no mechanical disturbances in the trolley.<br>
BACKGROUND AND THE PRIOR ART<br>
The existence of Lap Package Production Machine for the preparation of higher volume and high density lap with trolley arrangement for feeding the high speed Combers is known.<br>
The empty spools carried from the Comber by the trolley is normally loaded to the lap package production machine by manual means. The known method of regulating mechanism used for the regulation of empty spool is not always reliable and occasionally more than one spool is delivered from the magazine at a time, which it undesirable<br>
Indian patent specification 200986 describe a method for loading the spool from the lap trolley to the spool magazine of the lap forming machine wherein the method adopted for transferring the empty spool present in the trolley is loaded into the spool magazine as "the spool loading cylinder which is located in the lap former machine<br><br>
is provided with a pusher plate.  The spool  is already placed in the spool swivel tray of the trolley. The spool swivel tray is held in its position by a rack and pinion arrangement. When the spool loading cylinder is actuated, the pusher plate pushes the rack in the trolley. The rack in turn rotates the pinion, which swings the spool holding tray that is attached to the pinion. Thereby the spool is released into the spool magazine of the lap former by virtue of the inclination of the spool tray.  A spring return arrangement,  which  is  executed  in  a  known way, ensures that the rack is returned to its original position, thereby swinging the spool tray to its original position, after the pusher plate is revert back.  Based on sensor feedback the  spool  loading cylinder retracts  so as to revert back the pusher plate to home position.  In this method, to release the spool from the trolley, a mechanical force is imparted on the trolley. That is , the spool tray is released by making a physical contact with the trolley, thus causing disturbances to the trolley.<br>
Disadvantages of this system are use of more components, more load required to release the spool from Trolley to Spool magazine, disturbs the trolley during each change over of the spool from the trolley to the spool magazine causing mechanical vibrations in the trolley because the spool is released form the trolley by making a physical contact with the trolley  and the system is costly.<br>
Thus there is a need to provide for a spool loading mechanism so as to load spools from the trolley to the spool magazine such that there is no mechanical vibration<br><br>
or disturbances produced in the trolley during the process of spool transmission from the trolley to the spool magazine.<br>
The present inventors have found that a unique arrangement of a spool loader mechanism could remove the mechanical disturbances while transmission of the spools from trolley to the spool magazine.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, one object of the present invention is to overcome the disadvantages prevailing in the prior art.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a spool loading mechanism which is cost effective.<br>

1.	The trolley with empty spools is presented in front of the spool magazine by the trolley indexing mechanism.<br>
2.	The spool loading means which is located in the lap lifter assembly of the lap former machine causes swinging of the spool loader about its hinge.<br>
3.	The spool loader lifts the spool out of the spool supporting members of the trolley. In this invention.<br><br>
the spool loader makes physical contact, only with the spool and does not make any physical contact with the trolley.<br>
4.	The spool is lifted out of the spool support members and droped into the spool magazine by the spool loader due to its swinging.<br>
5.	The spool loading means is actuated based on the signal from the sensing means .<br>
6.	The trolley is indexed to the next position based on the feedback from the sensing means provided in the spool magazine.<br>
7.	The cycle repeats for each doff.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the 3D view of the lap trolley carrying the empty lap spools positioned adjacent to the lap forming machine according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the side view of the lap trolley carrying the empty lap spools positioned adjacent to the lap forming machine according to the present invention.<br><br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING FIGURES<br>
Referring to figures where in LF represents the lap former and TR represents the lap trolley used for the transfer of the empty spool from the combing machine to the lap forming machine as well as to transfer the laps produced by the lap forming machine to the comber for subsequent processing.<br>
The spool loader assembly (1) comprising spool loader (2) and spool loading means (7), the one end of the said spool loader (2) is pivoted to the frame (3) of the lap lifter assembly (4) at a pivot axis (5) . The spool loader (2) is provided with a connecting sheet (2a) formed with a curved surface and further provided with shoulder portion (2b) arranged at both ends of the spool supporting portion (2a) for the proper taking up of the spool during its transfer from the lap trolley (TR) in to the spool magazine (6).<br>
The trolley (TR) comprises an arrangement for holding the spool in the form of a plurality of support members (14a,14b, 14c, 14d) arranged at a pre determined location parallel to the axis of the spool loader (2), The support members may be made of solid or tubular metallic or non metallic material of suitable cross section , for example cylindrical ,square, hexagonal. The location of the support members (14a,14b, 14c,14d) are so selected such that the support members (14a,14b) support the lap spool to facilitate the smooth passage of the spool loader(2) underneath the lap spool (11) for the transfer of the lap spool to the lap foming machine without making contact with<br><br>
any other portion of the trolley  (TR) .  This avoids the unnecessary mechanical disturbance.<br>
To minimize the mechanical damage to the lap spool (11) as well as to damp the noise which is likely to be caused during the process of the transfer of the lap spools - in to the trolley attached to combing machine position- the support members (14a,14b, 14c,14d) may be advantageously provided with covering made of synthetic material - for example polyurethane rubber. Poly vinyl chloride, polyethylene , or low density polyethylene. Alternatively the support members (14a, 14b, 14c, 14d) may be made of synthetic material - for example polyamide, polyethylene in which case the covering is not required. The support members (14a,14b, 14c,14d) being arranged as a cage. Also the support members (14a,14b, 14c,14d) are so located such that a pre determined a gap (L) (refer fig (2) present. The said gap (L) is so arranged that it is slightly more than the diameter of the lap spool (11) so as to permit the withdrawal or positioning of the lap spool (11) from the rear side of the trolley. This arrangement facilitates the withdrawal or positioning of the lap spool (11) from /on the support members (14a,14b) with out taking out the trolley which is attached to the lap forming machine.<br>
The Spool loading means (7) of the spool loader assembly (1) may be for example a pneumatic cylinder or hydraulic cylinder, mounted to the frame (3) of the lap lifter assembly(4) at a pre determined location at its clevis end(8) . The piston rod (9) of the cylinder being pivoted to the hinge member (10) attached to spool loader (2)in a known way. The arrangement facilitates the swinging of the<br><br>
spool loader (2) with respect to the pivot axis (5) to facilitate the lifting of the lap spool arranged in the lap trolley, when the piston rod(9) of the spool loading cylinder extends. The Spool loading means (7) may be a rotary actuator operated by pneumatic, hydraulic or electrical means. In such cases the rotary actuator is directly coupled to the pivot axis (5) in a known way. The spool loader is so configured that when the piston rod (9) of the spool loading cylinder extends , the shoulder (2b) of spool loader (2) which is farther to that of the hinged end gently passes over the bottom side of the lap spool(11) which is supported by the support rods (14a,14b) present in the trolley(TR). Further extension of the piston rod lifts the spool (11) and drops the same on to the opening (6a) of the spool magazine(6), During the process of change over of the lap spool (11) from the lap trolley (TR) in to the spool magazine (6) , the spool lap (11) is guided by the spool guide(12) which are positioned in the lap trolley so as to provide proper guidance to the lap spool (11).<br>
The spool magazine (6) being provided with suitable inclination so as to facilitate the smooth transfer of the lap by the gravitational force, to the indexing arm (15a) of the indexing mechanism (15) provided at the other end of the spool magazine for subsequent delivery of the spool to the lap lifter assembly of the lap forming machine. The trolley (TR) carries a plurality of lap spools delivered by the combing machine and Subsequent to the spool change, the trolley (TR) is indexed so as to present the next spool mounted on the lap trolley to the lap lifter region for transfer to the spool magazine (6) , based on the feed back<br><br>
signal from the sensor means (13) arranged in the spool magazine (6). The sensor means may be a Photo sensor, for example and located just above the spool magazine but this does not restrict the scope of the present invention and any other sensor means can be used. The sensor sense the absence of empty spool inside the magazine and provides signal to the control circuit to activate the spool loading means (7) to initiate lap spool change and to continue the cycle.<br>
Advantages :<br>
1.	The mechanism is of simple construction.<br>
2.	The mechanism is cost effective.<br><br>
3.	There is no mechanical disturbance to the trolley.<br>
4.	The mechanism requires less number of components, there by the reliability of the system is enhanced.<br>
