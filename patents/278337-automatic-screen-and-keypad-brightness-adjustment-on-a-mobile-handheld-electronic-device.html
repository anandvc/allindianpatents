				<td>AUTOMATIC SCREEN AND KEYPAD BRIGHTNESS ADJUSTMENT ON A MOBILE<br>
HANDHELD ELECTRONIC DEVICE<br>
[0001]       The present application relates generally to electronic devices and more particularly to a method for automatically adjusting screen and keypad brightness on a mobile electronic device.<br>
[0002]       Liquid crystal display (LCD) screen and keypad brightness on a handheld electronic device may be adjusted for different operating environments in order to provide an optimal user experience. For example, in outdoor or sunlight conditions the LCD backlight must be very bright in order to be readable, and the keypad backlight should be off to conserver battery power. In normal indoor or office conditions, the LCD backlight should operate at medium brightness while the keypad backlight is usually turned off. In dim or dark conditions, the LCD backlight must be at low intensity so as to avoid eye strain and the keypad backlight must be on.<br>
[0003]       Ambient lighting conditions can change rapidly as the user moves between different working environments. For example, walking from indoors to outdoors may render the LCD screen immediately unreadable unless i&gt;s LCD backlight brightness is increased. Conversely, when the user moves from a bright environment ;nto a dimly lit room, the keypad may be unreadable unless the keypad backlight is turned on [0004]       Prior art arrangements have been implemented in GPS displays and laptop computers for providing basic automatic screen and keypad backlighting adjustment. However, none of such prior art backlighting algorithms are known to address independent control of LCD and keypad backlighting adjustment as a user moves between different ambient lighting conditions. Moreover, none of the known prior art addresses the problem of providing rapid backlight adjustment in response to a user removing his or her handheld electronic device from a wearable hoister accessory, or the problem of detecting ambient light when the light sensor and message notification indicator for the device share a common light pipe, such ss described in co-pending United States patent application no. 11/187,867, filed July 25, 2005, ana entitled SHARED LIGHT PIPE FOR A MESSAGE INDICATOR AND LIGHT SENSOR. [0004a]      WO00/41378 discloses a hand portable device which comprises a user interface, a light detector for detecting the light incident on at least part of the user interface, a comparator for comparing the light detected with a given threshold and<br>
control means for controlling an illuminator for illuminating the user interface in<br>
dependence upon the output of the comparator.<br>
[0004b]      EP1505567 discloses a method and system for automatically adjusting a<br>
backlight intensity level for displays in electronic devices having a camera and digital<br>
backlight displays, such that the camera is used to determine an ambient light level and<br>
the backlight level is adjusted according to the determined ambient light level.<br>
[0005]       According to one aspect of this specification, a method is described for<br>
preferably automatically adjusting screen and keypad brightness for optimum legibility<br>
under varying lighting conditions, with minimal eye strain and distraction to the user.<br>
Preferably, correct screen and keypad adjustments are made responsive to the user<br>
pulling his or her handheld device out of its holster notwithstanding non-optimal ambient<br>
light detection while the device is being removed from the holster. According to another<br>
aspect, the described method allows for ambient light detection in a handheld device<br>
where the light sensor and a message notification indicator share a common light pipe.<br>
[0006]       Therefore, according to the present specification a method is provided for<br>
automatically adjusting screen and keypad brightness on a mobile electronic device<br>
having a light sensor, a display screen and a keypad, comprising: obtaining light level<br>
samples from said light sensor; and adjusting backlight intensity of said display screen<br>
independently of backlight intensity of a keypad backlight responsive to said light level<br>
samples, wherein adjustment of the backlight intensity of said display screen and said<br>
keypad backlight from brighter to dimmer is controlled to be gradual whereas adjustment<br>
of the backlight intensity of said display screen and said keypad backlight from dimmer<br>
to brighter is controlled to be quick.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0016]       Referring to Figure 1, a mobile handheld electronic device is indicated<br>
generally by the numeral 20. In the present embodiment, the electronic device 20 is<br>
based on the computing environment and functionality of a wireless personal digital<br>
assistant. It will be understood, however, that the electronic device 20 is not limited to a<br>
wireless personal digital assistant. Other electronic devices are possible, such as<br>
desktop computers, cellular telephones, GPS receivers, smart telephones, and laptop<br>
computers. Referring again to the present embodiment, the electronic device 20<br>
includes a housing 22 that houses a mechanical vibration meant (not shown) and<br>
frames an LCD display 24, a speaker 26, a message notification indicator 28, a track<br>
wheel 30, an exit key 32 and a keypad 34. Preferably, the message notification indicator<br>
28 is in the form of a light pipe having two internal branches terminating respectively in a<br>
Light Emitting Diode (LED) and an ambient light sensor, as set forth in co-pending<br>
United States patent application no. 11/187,867, filed July 25, 2005, and entitled<br>
SHARED LIGHT PIPE FOR A MESSAGE INDICATOR AND LIGHT SENSOR. The track<br>
wheel 30 and the exit key 32 can be inwardly depressed along the path of arrow "A" as a<br>
means of providing additional user-input. The housing 22 is made from a suitable<br>
material as will occur to those skilled in the art, and can be stored, for example, in a<br>
holster (not shown) that includes an attachment for attaching to a user's belt.<br>
[0017]       Referring now to Figure 2, a block diagram is provided of certain internal<br>
components within the device 20. The device 20 is based on a microcomputer including<br>
a processor 36 connected to a read-only-memory (ROM) 38 that contains a plurality of applications executable by the processor 36 for enabling the device 20 to perform certain functions. The processor 36 is also connected to a random access memory unit (RAM) 40 and a persistent storage device 42 which are responsible for various non¬volatile storage functions of the device 20. The processor 36 receives input from various input devices including the track wheel 30, the exit key 32, and the keypad 34. The processor 36 outputs to various output devices including the LCD display 24, the speaker 26, the indicator 28 and the mechanical vibration device 43. The processor 36 is also connected to an internal clock 44 and a modem and radio device 46. The modem and radio device 46 are used to connect to various wireless networks using an antenna 48.<br>
[0018]       Reference is now made to Figure 3, showing a flowchart of a method for automatically adjusting screen 24 and keypad 34 brightness on the mobile handheld electronic device of Figures 1 and 2. The method is implemented by an algorithm within an application executable by the processor 36 to correctly switch between three screen-specific ambient lighting modes (referred to herein as DIM, OFFICE and BRIGHT, respectively) and two keypad-specific ambient lighting mode (referred to herein as KEYPAD-ON and KEYPAD-OFF, respectively. The screen-specific modes are determined independently of the keypad-specific modes. In DIM mode, the screen 24 backlight is dimmed for low lighting environment. In OFFiCE mode, the screen 24 backlight is set to a brightness suitable for an office environment, in BRiGHT mode, and the screen 24 backlight is set at full brightness, suitable for legibility in bright sunlight (as indicated below, KEYPAD-OFF mode is enabled whenever BRIGHT mode is enabled). In KEYPAD-ON mode, the keypad backlight is turned on. In KEYPAD-OFF mode, the keypad backlight is turned off. The DIM, OFFICE, BRIGHT, KEYPAD-ON and KEYPAD-OFF modes are determined by detected ambient light conditions and operate to set the backlights to appropriate operating states, as discussed in greater detail below.<br>
[0019]       Each ambient lighting mode has a corresponding brightness/state value as set forth in Table A, where “%PWM” represents the duty cycle of a pulse width modulated signal of variable base frequency dependent on the specified duty cycle, and “Lux range” represents the range of ambient lighting intensity (measured in Lux units, where Lux represents the amount of visible light per square meter incident on a surface) in which each mode operates:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
[0020]       As indicated in Table A, the screen 24 backlight is adjustable in 5 or 10 discreet steps between 3% and 6.5% PWM, an additional 5 or 10 discreet steps from 10% to 40% PWM and may also be set to 100% PWM Backlight brightness control also permits a smoothly and quick fade (~200ms) and a slow fade (1-1.5s) between any of these steps (in addition to the off state). The keypad 34 backlight is adjustable in at least 5 discreet steps from 0% to 100%PWM, allowing for a sniooth quick fade (200ms) and a very slow fade (4-5 seconds, ideally) between each of these discreet levels and the off state.<br>
[0021]       Upon starting the algorithm (step 50) when the device 20 is turned on, the backlight mode is normally initialized to an appropriate mode using the ambient lighting sensed by the light sensor at that time. Next, light sensor samples are taken at set intervals and maintained in a buffer containing the five most recent samples at any given time (step 52). This buffer is referred to as the sample window because it is a moving window such that when each new sample is received, the oldest sample in the window is discarded from the buffer. The amount of time between each light sensor sample determines the sampling rate. A typical sampling rate is one sample per 1.2 seconds although in some situations the sampling rate may be increased to 400ms temporarily for 5 samples to facilitate quick adjustment of the screen and keypad backlights. At step 54, the median sample value is calculated by sorting all samples in the sample window and choosing the middle value (i.e. the third sample in the window).<br>
[0022]       When each sample is received, a new median in the sample window is calculated and compared to various thresholds (step 56) to determine if a backlight adjustment is necessary, according to the thresholds listed in state Table B, where ADC represents Analog to Digital Converter output values:<br>
(Table Removed)<br>
Keypad backlight modes are handled independently from the LCD backlight modes:<br>
<br>
(Table Removed) <br>
[0023]       The relationship between ADC threshold values expressed in Table B and light intensity values is as follows: ADC 7=16 Lux, ADC 14= 70 Lux, 16 ADC = 60 Lux, 50 ADC = 250 Lux, ADC 450 = 3000 Lux, and ADC 650 = 4400 Lux. Operation of the state Table B is depicted in the flowcharts of Figure 4, 5 and 6.<br>
[0024]       Thus, as shown in Figure 4, when the backlighting is in DIM mode, the median sample value is compared (step 58) to a threshold value of 14 (70 Lux) and if the value is greater than 14 OFFICE mode of backlight operation is selected (step 62) wherein the screen 24 backlight is at a brightness suitable for an office environment. However, if the median sample value is greater than 650 (step 64) then BRIGHT mode of backlight operation is selected (step 66) wherein the screen 24 backlight is set to full brightness.<br>
[0025]       As shown in Figure 5, when the backlighting is in OFFICE mode (step 68), the median sample value is compared (step 70) to a threshold value of 7 (16 Lux) and if the value is less than 7 DIM mode of backlight operation is selected (step 72) wherein the screen 24 backlight is dimmed. However, if the median sample value is greater than 650 (step 74) then BRIGHT mode of backlight operation is selected (step 76) wherein the screen 24 backlight is set to full brightness.<br>
[0026]       As shown in Figure 6, when the backlighting is in BRIGHT mode (step 78), the median sample value is compared (step 80) to a threshold value of 7 and if the value is less than 7 DIM mode of backlight operation is selected (step 82) wherein the screen 24 backlight is dimmed. If the median sample value is less than 450 (step 84) then OFFICE mode of backlight operation is selected (step 86) wherein the screen 24 backlight is at a brightness suitable for an office environment.<br>
[0027]       From Figures 4 and 5, it will be noted that the threshold for changing from DIM mode to OFFICE mode is higher than the threshold for changing from OFFICE to DIM mode. This compensates for situations where the ambient lighting ;s hovering around a particular threshold value and prevents constant transitioning between backlight states. A similar hysteresis is integrated into the threshold values between the OFFICE and BRIGHT modes (Figures 5 and 6).<br>
[0028]       As indicated above, keypad 34 lighting is controlled independently of screen 24 backlighting to allow the keypad to respond more quickly to dim environments, and to allow the LCD screen to respond more quickly to office and bright or sunlight environments. Hence, it is possible for the screen backlight to be in OFFICE or BRIGHT mode while the keypad backlight is still in KEYPAD-ON mode (temporarily. As set forth in Figure 7, while the keypad backlight is OFF (step 88), each sample value (rather than the median sample value) is compared (step 90) to a threshold value of 16 and if the value is less than 16 the keypad 34 backlight turns on right away (step 92). This ensures that the user does not have to wait to type if they are unable to see the keypad 34. This means that the keypad may sometimes turn on prematurely when the device 20 is not actually in a dim or dark environment but a single sample less than 16 is received for some reason. This ensures that the keypad 34 is never unusable, even though slightly more battery is drawn and the user may become slightly confused as to why the keypad backlight appears to turn on "randomly" in some circumstances. Ideally, the keypad 34 should turn on quickly (about 200ms) after receiving a single "dim" sample but fade off-very slowly so that it is barely noticeable (e.g. 5-10 seconds). This helps to remove distraction (and possible confusion) when the LCD screen 24 backlight is turned off.<br>
[0029]       While the keypad backlight is ON, consecutive sample values are compared (step 94) to a threshold value of 50 and once 30 seconds of contiguous samples greater than 50 have been received the keypad 34 is turned OFF (step 88). This avoids the possibility of "thrashing" the keypad backlight on and off in highly variable lighting environments, which would be quite distracting and annoying to the user.<br>
[0030]       By using the median sample in the sample window for mode-change decisions, brief lighting fluctuations (e.g. bright flashes lasting less than about 800ms) are effectively filtered out while still providing an acceptably quick response to entering an area with bright sunlight or pulling the device out of the holster in bright sunlight. Transitioning through a dim environment for less than about 5 seconds is also ignored because all five samples in the sample window are required to be less than the threshold value for the currently active mode to affect a mode change. Since it takes several seconds for a user's eyes to adjust to a dimmer environment, the LCD screen 24 brightness is permitted by the algorithm to adjust gradually.<br>
[0031]       As shown in Figure 8, light sensor samples are not taken (i.e. sleep mode) while the device 20 is off or in the holster (step 100) in order to save battery life and because samples are not likely to be valid because the light sensor is likely covered by an arm (device 20 is in holster) or in a bag or a pocket. When the light sensor software "wakes up" (step 102), sampling and backlight adjustment begins (step 106) with a fast sampling rate (400ms) for the next five samples. The first sample received is used to initialize the entire sample window, if the second sample is brighter than the first, then this value is used to initialize the entire sample window. If the third sample is brighter than the first two, then it is used to initialize the sample window.<br>
[0032]       Thereafter, the normal sampling rate is one sample every 1.2 seconds (step 108). Preferably, each light sensor sample is actually an average of multiple quick samples taken over a period of about 9ms. More particularly, at least 8 ADC readings are taken over a 9ms period so that they can be averaged out so as to increase the reliability of each sample and filter out small variances in AC indoor lighting.<br>
[0033]       When the device 20 is pulled out of its holster, removed from a pocket or bag, etc., it is highly likely that the light sensor will be temporarily partially covered by the user's hand or shirt. This means that the first couple samples could be below the threshold for transitioning to DIM mode, even if the device 20 is operating in the OFFICE mode. Likewise, the first couple of samples could be indicative of OFFICE mode even though the device is in a bright environment. However, it is nearly impossible for a brighter sample to be received when the device is in a dim environment. Hence, as discussed above, the entire sample window is initialized to the greatest sa-nple when the device 20 out of the holster.<br>
[0034]       If the screen 24 turns off due to a system timeout or the power button being pressed, but the device 20 has not been yet been turned off or returned to its holster (step 110), then light sensor sampling reverts to sleep mode (step 100) provided the screen 24 does not turn back on within the time it takes to receive the next five samples. This five sample delay is provided because the screen 24 may time out while the user is reading the screen. It is common for a user to handle this situation by hitting a key to -immediately wake up the screen again (which turns on the backlight). In this case, the sample window is not reset to sleep mode. If the LCD screen 4 stays off for more than a few seconds then the sample window is reset to sleep mode due to the likelihood that the device environment has changed.<br>
[0035]       Based on the foregoing, LCD screen 24 brightness responds to a change from a dimmer to a brighter environment within 800ms to 2 seconds. This is the amount of time that it takes to receive three brighter samples (which sets the median of the 5-sample window). The first sample in a brighter environment triggers the fast 400ms sampling rate (step 104). However, it can take up to 1.2 seconds before the first sample is received. LCD screen 24 brightness responds to a change from a brighter environment to a dimmer mode in about 6 seconds. It takes 5 consecutive samples in a dimmer mode to cause a transition to the new mode. When the screen 24 backlight brightness is adjusted downwardly, the backlight is slowly faded to the new brightness level. This fading takes from about 1s to 1.5s.<br>
[0036]       As discussed above in connection with Figure 1, the light sensor and message indicating LED share a common light pipe. If the sampling algorithm of Figure 8 requires a light sensor sample to be taken while the LED is on, then the sample is delayed until immediately after the LED turns off, unless the device 20 is in the process of being pulled out of its holster. In this case, an initial low light sample is "faked" if the LED is on while removing the device 20 from its holster, etc. so as not to delay turning on the LCD screen 24 backlight (which cannot occur until a sample has been received). Each LED on/off transition is controlled so that the state information can be provided to the automatic backlight software set forth herein of LED on/off transitions.<br>
[0037]       Preferably, coarse timers are used in the described method (e.g. -17-12.5% variance). The use of coarse timers minimizes the number of times the processor 36 must wake up due to timer events. Consequently, all times referred to i.-i this specification are characterized by a possible error of +/-12.5%.<br>
[0038]       If the power button of device 20 is pressed, the screen 24 brightness is increased significantly. This overrides the brightness adjustment algorithm temporarily until the screen is turned off, and normal screen brightness adjustment resumes when the screen 24 turns back on again.<br>
[0039]       The light sensor functionality set forth herein may be altered or disabled by the user via an "Automatic Backlight" option accessible through a Screen/Keyboard options screen displayed by device 20. This enables backlight functionality which allows the user to press the power button to cycle between 1) user-selected brightness; 2) super-bright; and 3) backlight/LCD off. When the LCD screen 24 is on, the keypad 34 backlight is always on. When the LCD screen 24 is off, the keypad 34 backlight is always off.<br>
[0040]       While the embodiments described herein are directed to particular<br>
implementations of the method for automatically adjusting screen and keypad brightness on a mobile handheld electronic device, it will be understood that modifications and variations to these embodiments are within the scope and sphere of the present application. For example, as indicated above the backlighting brightness adjustment methodology set forth herein is not limit in its application to handheld electronic devices but may advantageously applied to other electronic devices such as desktop computers, cellular telephones, GPS receivers, smart telephones, and laptop computers. Also, it is contemplated that the keypad backlighting, although independent of LCD screen backlighting adjustment, may advantageously transition between various lighting modes (such as DIM, OFFICE and BRIGHT) rather than simply switching between ON and OFF. Many other modifications and variations may occur to those skilled in the art. All such modifications and variations are believed to be within the sphere and scope of the present application.<br>
