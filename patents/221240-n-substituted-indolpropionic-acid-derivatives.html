The present invention is concerned with novel indolyl derivatives useful as insulin sensitizers, particularly PPAR activators.<br>
The invention is concerned especially with compounds of formula I<br><br>
wherein<br>
R1 is aryi or heteroaryi;<br>
R2 is hydrogen, alky! or cycloalkyl;<br>
R4 is hydrogen, alkyl or cycloalkyl; wherein anyone of R andR is<br><br><br>
and the other is hydrogen, alkyl or cycloalkyl and, wherein the bond between the carbon atoms C3 and Cb is a carbon carbon single or double bond;<br>
R3 is aryloxy, alkenyloxy, alkoxy or alkoxy substituted with one to three halogen atoms; R7 is hydrogen, alkyl or cycloalkyl;<br>
R8 is hydrogen, alkyl or cycloalkyl;<br>
wherein anyone of A and A1 is nitrogen and the other is oxygen or sulfur,<br>
nisi, 2 or 3;<br>
and pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters thereof.<br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and esters are novel and have valuable pharmacological properties. They are insulin sensitizers, particularly PPAR activators.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPAR's) are members of the nuclear hormone receptor super family, which are ligand-activated transcription factors regulating gene expression. Various subtypes thereof have been identified and cloned These include PPARa, PPARJ3 (also known as PPAR8), and PPARy. There exist at least two major isoforms of PPARy. While PPARyl is ubiquitously expressed in most tissues, the longer isoform PPARy2 is almost exclusively found in adipocytes. In contrast, PPARa is predominantly expressed in the liver, kidney and heart. PPAR's modulate a variety of body responses including glucose- and lipid- homeostasis, cell differentiation, inflammatory responses and cardiovascular events.<br>
Diabetes is a disease in which a patient's ability to control glucose levels in blood is impaired, because he has partially lost the ability to respond properly to the action of insulin. In type II diabetes (T2D), often referred to as non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM), which afflicts 80-90 % of all diabetic patients in developed countries, the Isles of Langerhans in the pancreas still produce insulin. However, the target organs, mainly muscle, liver and adipose tissue, exhibit a profound resistance to insulin stimulation, and the body compensates by producing unphysiologically high levels of insulin. In later stage of disease, however, insulin secretion decreases due to exhaustion of the pancreas. In addition to that T2D is a metabolic-cardiovascular disease sysndrome. Among the comorbidities associated with T2D are for example insulin resistance, dyslipidemia, hypertension, endothelial dysfunction and inflammatory atherosclerosis.<br>
Current first line treatment for diabetes generally involves low fat - and glucose - diet and exercise. However, compliance can be moderate and as the disease progresses,<br><br>
treatment with hypoglycemic drugs, e.g. sulfonylureas or metformin, becomes necessary. A promising new class of drugs has recently been introduced that resensitizes patients to their own insulin (insulin sensitizers), thereby reverting blood glucose and triglyceride levels to normal, and thus abolishing, or at least reducing, the requirement for exogenous insulin. Pioglitazone (Actos    ) and rosiglitazone (Avandia    ) belong to the thiazolidinediones (TZD) class of PPARy-agonists and were the first representatives who had been approved for NIDDM in several countries. These compounds, however, suffer from side effects including rare but severe liver toxicity (as seen with troglitazone), and they increase body weight in humans. Therefore, new, better and more efficacious drugs for the treatment of NIDDM are urgently needed. Recent studies provide evidence that a coagonism on PPARa and PPARy would result in compounds with enhanced therapeutic potential, i. e. with an improved lipid profile effect on top of the normalization of glucose-and insulin-levels (Keller and Wahli: Trends Endocrin. Metab. 1993; 4:291-296, Macdonald and Lane: Current Biology Vol5 pp.618-621 (1995)).<br>
The novel compounds of the present invention exceed the compounds known in the art, inasmuch as they bind to and activate both, PPARa and PPARy, simultaneously and very efficiently. Therefore, these compounds combine the anti-glycemic effect of PPARY activation with the anti-dyslipidemic effect of PPARa activation. Consequently, plasma glucose and insulin are reduced (=insulin sensitization), triglycerides lowered and HDL cholesterol increased (=improved lipid profile). In addition, such compounds may also lower LDL cholesterol, decrease blood pressure and counteract inflammatory atherosclerosis. Since multiple facets of the T2D disease syndrome are addressed by PPARa and y coagonists, they are expected to have an enhanced therapeutic potential compared to the compounds already known in the art.<br>

proteins fused to the ligand binding domains (LBD) of PPARy (aa 174 to 476) and PPARa<br><br>
(aa 167 to 469). To accomplish this, the portions of the cloned sequences encoding the LBDs were amplified from the full-length clones by PCR and then subcloned into the plasmid vectors. Final clones were verified by DNA sequence analysis.<br>
Induction, expression, and purification of GST-LBD fusion proteins were performed in £ coli strain BL21(pLysS) cells by standard methods (Ref. Current Protocols in Molecular Biology, Wiley Press, edited by Ausubel et aL).<br>
Radioligand Binding Assay<br>
PPARa receptor binding was assayed in TKE10 (10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8, 50 mM KC1, 2mM EDTA, O.lmg/ml fatty acid free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96 well 2.4 ug<br>
equivalent of GST-PPARcc-LBD fusion protein and radioligand, e.g. 40000 dpm 2(S)-(2-benzoyl-phenylamino)-3-{4-[l&gt;l-ditritio-2-(5-methyl-2-phenyl-oxazol"4-yl)-etiioxy]-phenylj-propionic acid, were incubated in 100 ul volume at RT for 2 hrs. Bound ligand was removed from unbound ligand by solid phase separation using MultiScreen plates (Millipore) filled with 80 ul of SG25 according to the manufacturer's recommendations.<br>
PPARy receptor binding was assayed in TKE50 (50mMTris-HCl, pH 8,50 mM KC1,2mM EDTA, 0.1 mg/ml fatty acid-free BSA and 10 mM DTT). For each 96 well reaction an 140 ng equivalent of GST-PPARy-LBD fusion protein was bound to 10 ug SPA beads (PharmaciaAmersham) in a final volume of 50 ul by shaking. The resulting slurry was incubated for Ih at RT and centrifuged for 2 min at 1300g. The supernatant containing unbound protein was removed and the semidry pellet containig the recptor-coated beads was resolved in 50 ul of TKE. For radioligand binding e.g. 10000 dpm 2(S)-(2-benzoyl-phenylammo)-3-{4-[l,l-ditritio<br>
propionic acid in 50 ul were added, the reaction incubated at RT for lh and scintillation proximity counting performed. All binding assays were performed in 96 well plates and the amount of bound ligand measured on a Packard TopCount using OptiPlates (Packard). Nonspecific binding was determined in the presence of 10"4 M unlabelled compound. Dose response curves were done in triplicates within a range of concentration from 10"10 M to 10"4 M.<br>
Luciferase Transcriptional Reporter Gene Assays<br>
Baby hamster kidney cells (BHK21ATCC CCL10) were grown in DMEM medium containing 10% FBS at 37°C in a 95%02:5%C02 atmosphere. Cells were seeded in 6 well plates at a density of 105 Cells/well and then transiently batch-transfected with either the<br><br>
pFA-PPARy-LBD or pFA-PPARoc-LBD expression plasmids plus the pFR-luc reporter plasmid and an expression plasmid encoding the secretable form of alkaline phosphatase (SEAP) as a normalization control. Transfection was accomplished with the Fugene 6 reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) according to the suggested protocol. Six hours following transfection, the cells were harvested by trypsinization and seeded in 96 well plates at a density of 104 cells/well. After 24 hours to allow attachment of cells, the medium was removed and replaced with 100 ul of phenol red-free medium containing the test substances or control ligands (final. 0.1% DMSO). Following incubation of the cells for 24 hours with substances, 50 ul of the supernatant was recovered and analyzed for SEAP activity (Roche Molecular Biochemicals). The remainder of the supernatant was discarded, 50 ul PBS was added per well followed by one volume of Luciferase Constant-Light Reagent (Roche Molecular Biochemicals) to lyse the cells and initiate the luciferase reaction. Luminescence for both SEAP and luciferase was measured in a Packard TopCount Luciferase activity was normalized to the SEAP control and transcriptional activation in the presence of a test substance was expressed as fold-activation over cells incubated in the absence of the substance. EC50 values were calculated using the XLfit program (ID Business Solutions Ltd. UK).<br>
The compounds of the present invention exhibit IC50 values of 0.1 nM to 50 jiM, preferably 1 nM to 10 pM, paricularly 1 - 3500 nM, more preferred 20 to 1000 nM, for PPARa and PPARy. The compounds further exhibit EC50 values of 0.1 nM to 50 jiM, preferably 1 nM to 10 pM, more preferably 1 - 3500 nM, particularly 20 to 1000 ^iM, for PPAR a and PPARy.<br>
The following table shows measured values for some selected compounds of the present invention and for a compound already known in the art (e.g.: Rosiglitazone, Drugs 1999, Vol 57(6), 921-930).<br><br><br>
The compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutical acceptable salts and esters can be used as medicaments, e.g. in the form of pharmaceutical preparations for enteral, parenteral or topical administration. They can be administered, for example, perorally, e.g. in the form of tablets, coated tablets, dragees, hard and soft gelatine capsules, solutions, emulsions or suspensions, rectally; e.g. in the form of suppositories, parenterally, e.g. in the form of injection solutions or infusion solutions, or topically, e.g. in the form of ointments, creams or oils.<br>
The production of the pharmaceutical preparations can be effected in a manner which will be familiar to any person skilled in the art by bringing the described compounds of formula I and their pharmaceutically acceptable, into a galenical administration form together with suitable, non-toxic, inert, therapeutically compatible solid or liquid carrier materials and, if desired, usual pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
Suitable carrier materials are not only inorganic carrier materials, but also organic carrier materials. Thus, for example, lactose, corn starch or derivatives thereof, talc, stearic acid or its salts can be used as carrier materials for tablets, coated tablets, dragdes and hard gelatine capsules. Suitable carrier materials for soft gelatine capsules are, for example, vegetable oils, waxes, fats and semi-solid and liquid polyols (depending on the nature of the active ingredient no carriers are, however, required in the case of soft gelatine<br><br>
capsules). Suitable carrier materials for the production of solutions and syrups are, for example, water, polyols, sucrose, invert sugar and the like. Suitable carrier materials for injection solutions are, for example, water, alcohols, polyols, glycerol and vegetable oils. Suitable carrier materials for suppositories are, for example, natural or hardened oils, waxes, fats and semi-liquid or liquid polyols. Suitable carrier materials for topical preparations are glycerides, semi-synthetic and synthetic glycerides, hydrogenated oils, liquid waxes, liquid paraffins, liquid fatty alcohols, sterols, polyethylene glycols and cellulose derivatives.<br>
Usual stabilizers, preservatives, wetting and emulsifying agents, consistency-improving agents, flavour-improving agents, salts for varying the osmotic pressure, buffer substances, solubilizers, colorants and masking agents and antioxidants come into consideration as pharmaceutical adjuvants.<br>
The dosage of the compounds of formula I can vary within wide limits depending on the disease to be controlled, the age and the individual condition of the patient and the mode of administration, and will, of course, be fitted to the individual requirements in each particular case. For adult patients a daily dosage of about 0.1 mg to about 1000 mg, especially about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg, comes into consideration. Further preferred daily dosages for adult patients are of about 1 mg to about 1000 mg, especially about 1 mg to about 100 mg. Depending on the dosage it is convenient to administer the daily dosage in several dosage units.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations conveniently contain about 0.05-500 mg, preferably 0.05-100 mg, of a compound of formula I. Preferred pharmaceutical preparations comprise about 0.5-500 mg, preferably 0.5-100 mg, of a compound of formula I.<br>
