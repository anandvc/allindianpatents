BACKGROUND<br>
Interleukin-12 CIL-12) is a heterodimeric cytokine (p70) composed of two subunits +35 and p40), and plays key roles in immune responses by bridgiag innate resistance and antigen-specific adaptive immunity. Trinchieri (1993) Immunol Today 14: 335. For example, it promotes type 1 Thelper cell (Thl) responses and, hence, cell-mediated immunity. Chan et al. il99\)JExp Med 173: 869; Seder et al. (1993) Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 90:10188; Manetti et al. (1993) J Exp Med 177:1199; and Hsieh et al. (1993) Science 260: 547. Overproduction of IL-12 causes excessive Thl responses, and may result in inflammatory disorders, such as insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, psoriasiSj Crohn's disease, or sepsis. See, for example, Gately et al. (1998) Annu Rev Immunol. 16:495; and Abbas etal {1996) Nature 3+3: 787. Thus, inhibiting IL-12 overproduction is an approach to treat the just-mentioned diseases. Trembleau et al. {1995) Immmunoi. Today 16: 383; and Adorini et al. (1997) Chem. Immunol. 68:175. For example, overproduction of 11+12 and the resultant excessive Thl type responses can be suppressed by modulating 11+12 production. A compound that down-regulates IL-12 production can be used for treating inflanunatory diseases. Ma et al. (1998) Eur Cytokine Netw 9: 54.<br><br><br>

Other features, objects, and advantages of the invention will be apparent from the description and from the claims,<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
The compounds described above can be prepared fay methods well known in the art, as well as by the synthetic routes disclosed herein. For example, a pyrimidine compound can be prepared by using 2, 4,6-trichloro-pyrimidine as a starting material.<br><br>
The three chloro groups can be displaced by various substitutes. More specifically, first chloro group (e.g., at position 6) can react with, e.g., morpholine, to form a morpholinyl pyrimidine. 2-Aryl and 2-alkylpyimidinde dichloro compounds can also be prepared by reacting an amidine with a malonic ester followed by treatment with phosphorous oxychloride. Second chloro group can be replaced by reacting with a nucleophile, such as an alcohol in the presence of base, e.g., sodium hydride. In othar examples, a compound of formula (I), wherein Y is CH2 (e.g., Compound 1), can be prepared by reacting the pyrimidine chloride with a.Grignard reagent, an organotin reagent, an organocopper reagent, an organoboric acid, or an organozinc reagent in the presence of an organopalladium compound as a catalyst Isomeric forms may be produced. The desired isomeric product can be separated firom others by, e.g., high performance liquid chromatogr+hy. Third chloro group undergoes a displacement reaction with, e.g., hydrazine, and the primary amine of the coupled hydrazine moiety iurther reacts with an aldehyde, e.g., indole-3-carboxaldehyde to form a hydrazone linkage. Thus, a pyrimidine compound of this invention is obtained. If preferred, other types of linkages can be prepared by similar reactions. Sensitive moieties on a pyrimidinyl intermediate and a nucleophile can be protected prior to couplii+.<br>
The chemicals used in the above-described synthetic routes may include, for example, solvents, reagents, catalysts, and protecting group and deprotecting group reagents. The methods described above may also additionally include steps, either before or after the steps described specifically herein, to add or remove suitable protecting groups in order to ultimately allow synthesis of the pyrimidine compoimds. In addition, various synthetic steps may be performed in an alternate sequence or order to give the desired compoimds. Synthetic chemistry transformations and protecting group methodologies protection and deprotection) useful in synthesizing applicable pyrimidine compounds aie known in the art and include, for example, those described in R. Larock, Comprehensive Organic Transformations, VCH Publishers (19S9); T.W. Greene and P.G.M. Wuts, Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis, 3"+ Ed., John Wiley aM Sons (1999); L. Fieser andM. Fieser, Fieser and Fieser's Reagents for Orgmiic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1994); and L Paquette, ed.. Encyclopedia of Reagents for Organic Synthesis, John Wiley and Sons (1995) and subsequent editions thereof.<br><br>
A pyrimidme compound thus obtained can be further purified by flash column chromatography, high performance liquid chromatograhy, or crystallization-<br>
Also within the scope of this invention is a pharmaceutical composition that contains an effective amount of one or more of the pyrimidine compounds of this invention and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Further, the present invention covers a method of administering an effective amount of such a compound to a subject in need of treatment of IL-12 overproduction related diseases (e.g,, rheumatoid Euthritis, sepsis, Crohn's disease, multiple SCLEROSIS, psoriasis, or insulin-dependent diabetra mellins). "An effective amount' refers to the amount of the compound whichls required to confer a therapeutic effect on the treated subject. The interrelationship of dosages for animals and humans (based on milligrams per meter squared of body surface) is described in Freireich et al, (1966) Cancer Chemother Rep 50: 219. Body surface area may be approximately determined from height and weight of the patient. See, e.g., Scientific Tables, Geigy Pharmaceuticals, Ardley, N.Y., 1970, 537. An effective amount of the pyrimddine compound of this invention can range from about 0.001 mg/Kg to about 1000 mg/Kg. Effective doses will also vary, as recognized by those skilled in the art, depending on die diseases treated, route of administration, excipient usage, and the possibility of co-usage with other therapeutic treatments such as use of other agents.<br>
To practice the method of the present invention, a pyrimidine compound, as a component of a pharmaceutical composition, can be administered orally, parenterally, by inhalation spray, topically, rectaliy, nasally, buccally, vaginally or via an implanted reservoir. The term '•parenteral" as used herein includes subcutaneous, intracutaneous, intravenous, intramuscular, intraarticular, intraarterial, intrasynovial, intrastemal, intrathecal, intralesional and intracranial injection or infusion techniques.<br>
A sterile injectable composition, for example, a sterile injectable aqueous or oleaginous suspension, can be formulated according to techniques known in the art using suitable dispereing or wettmg agents (such as, for example, Tween 80) and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation can also be a sterile injectable solution or suspension in a non-toxic parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that can be employed are mannitol, water. Ringer's solution and isotonic sodium<br><br>
chloride solution. In addition, sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium (e.g., synthetic mono- or diglycerides). Fatty acids, such as oleic acid and its glyceride derivatives are useful in the preparation of injectables, as are natural phannaceutically-acceptable oils, such as olive oil or castor oil, eqjecially in their polyoxyethylated versions. These oil solutions or suspensions can also contain a long-chain alcohol diluent or dispersant, or carboxymethyl cellulose or similar dispersing agents. Other commonly used surfactants such as Tweens or Spans or other similar emulsifying agents or bioavailability enhancers which are commonly used in the manufacture of pharmaceutically acceptable sohd, liquid, or other dosage forms can also be used for the purposes of formulation.<br>
A composition for oral administration can be any orally acceptable dosage form including, but not lunlted to, capsules, tablets, emulsions and aqueous suspensions, dispersions and solutions, hi the case of tablets for oral use, carriers which are commonly used include lactose and com starch. Lubricating agents, such as magnesium stearate, are also typically added. For oral administration in a capsule form, mefiil diluents include lactose and dried com starch. When aqueous suspensions or emulsions are administered orally, the active ingredient can be suspended or dissolved in an oily phase combined with emulsifying or suspending agents. If desired, certain sweetening, flavoring, or coloring agents can be added. A nasal aerosol or inhalation composition can be prepared according to techniques well-known in the art of pharmaceutical formulation and can be prepared as solutions in saline, employing benzyl alcohol or other suitable preservatives, absorption promoters to enhance bioavailability, fluorocarbons, and/or other solubilizing or dispersing agents known in the art. A pyrimidine compound of this invention can also be administered in the form of suppositories for rectal administratioa<br>
The carrier in the phamiaceutical composition must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible with the active ingredient of the formulation (and preferably, capable of stabilizing it) and not deleterious to the subject to be treated. For example, solubilizing agents such as cyclodextrins, which form specific, more soluble complexes with the compounds of this invention, or one or more solubilizing agents, can be utilized as phannaceutical excipients for delivery of the pyrimidine<br><br>
compounds. Examples of other carriers include colloidal silicon dioxide, magnesium stearate, cellulose, sodium lauryl sulfete, and D&amp;C Yellow # 10.<br>
The biological activities of a pyrimidine compound can be evaluated by a number of cell-based assays. One of such assays can be conducted using cells ftom human peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) or human monocytic cell line (THP-1). TTie cells are stimulated with a combination of human interferon-y (IFNy) and lipopolysaccharide or a combination of IFNy and Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I in the presence of a test compound. The level of inhibition of IL-12 production can be measured by detennining the amount of p70 by using a sandwich ELISA assay with anti-human lL-12 antibodies. IC50 of the test compound can then be determined. Specifically, PBMC or THP-1 cells are incubated witti the test compound. Cell viabiUty was assessed using the bioreduction of MTS [3-(4,5-dimethy]thiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazoIiuml (Promega, Madison, WI).<br>
A pyrimidine compoimd can also be evaluated by animal studies. For example, one of such studies involves the ability of a test compound to treat adjuvant arthritis (i.e., a IL-12 overproduction related disorder) in rats.<br>

Reagents. Staphylococcus aureus Cowan I (SAC) was obtained from Calbiochem (La Jolla, CA), and lipopolyaccharide (LPS, Serratia marscencens) was obtained from Sigma (St. Louis, MO). Human and mouse recombin+it IFNy were purchased from Boehringer Mannheim (Mannheim, Germany) and Pharmingen (San Diego, CA), respectively.<br>
Human In Vitro Assay. Human PBMC were isolated by cemtrifugation using Ficoli-Paque (Pharmacia Biotech, Uppsala, Sweden) and prepared in RPMI medium siqiplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS), 100 U/mL penicillin, and 100 jig/mL streptomycin. PBMC were plated in wells of a 96-well plate at a concentration of 5 x 10+ cells/well, and primed by adding IFNy (30 U/mL) for 22 h and stimulated by adding LPS (1 ng/mL), or by adding IFNy (100 U/mL) and then stimulated by adding SAC (0.01%). A test pyrimidine compound was dissolved in DMSO, and added to wells of the 96-well plate. The final DMSO concentration was adjusted to 0.25% in all cultures, including the compound-free control. Human THP-1 cells were plated in wells, primed by adding IFNy (100 U/mL) for 22 h and stimulated by adding SAC (0.025%) in the presence of different concentrations of the pyrimidine compound. Cell-free supematants were taken 18 h later for measurement of cytokines. Cell viability was assessed using the bioreduction of MTS. Cell survival was estimated by deteimining the ratio of the absorbance in compoimd-freated gro+gis VCTSUS compound-free control.<br>
The supernatant was assayed for the amount of IL-12p40, IL-12p70, or IL-10 by xising a sandwich ELISA with anti-human antibodies, i.e., a Human IL-12 p40 ELISA kit fivsm R&amp;D Systems (Berkeley. CA), and a Human 7Lr 12 p70 or IL-10 ELISA kit from Endogen (Cambridge, MA). Assays WCTO based on the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
Murine In Vitro Assay. Balb/c mice (Taconic, Gennantown, NY) were immunized with Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra (Difco, Defroit, MI). The splenocytes were harvested 5 days and preared in RPMI medium stipplemented with 10% FCS and antibiotics in a flat bottom 96-well plate with 1 x 106 cells/well. The<br><br>
splenocytes were then stimulated with a combination of IFNy (60 ng/mL) and SAC (0.025%) [or LPS (20 fig/mL)] in the presence of a test compound. Ceil-free supematants were taken 24 h later for the measurement of cytokines. The preparation of compound and the assessment of cell viability were carried out as described above. Mouse IL-12 p70, IL-IO, IL-lp, and TNFa were measured using ELISA kits from Endogen, according to the manufacturer's instructions.<br>
The biological activities of pyrimidine compounds were tested on human PBMC or THP+l cells. Unexpectedly, some of the test compounds have ICso values as low as

Treatment of adjuvant arthritis in rats: Adjuvant arthritis (AA) was induced in female Lewis rats by the intracutaneous injection (base of the tail) of 0.1 mL of a 10 mg/mL bacterial suspension made from ground, heat-killed Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Ra suspended in incomplete Freund's adjuvant. Rats were given a test compound orally once a day for 12 days, starting the day following the induction. The developmait of polyarthritis was monitored daily by macroscopic inspection and assi+mient of an arthritis index to each animal, during the critical period (days 10 to 25 post-immunization).<br>
The intensity of polyarthritis was scored according to the following scheme: (a) Grade each paw from 0 to 3 based on erythema, swelling, and deformity of &amp;e joints: 0 for no erythema or swelling; 0.5 if swelling is detectable in at least one joint; 1 for mild swelling and erythema; 2 for swelling and erythema of both tarsus and carpus; and 3 for ankylosis and bony deformity. Maximum score for all 4 paws was thus 12. (+) Grade for o&amp;erpartsofthe body: for each ear, 0.5 for redn+s and another 0.5 if knots are present; 1 for connective tissue swelling (saddle nose); and I for the presence of knots or kinks in the tail. The highest possible arthritic index was 16.<br>
Oral administration of pyrimidine compounds of this invention (e.g.. Compound 12) reproducibly reduced the arthritic score and delayed the development of polyarthritis in a dose-dependent manner. The arthritis score used in this model was a reflection ofthe inflammatory state ofthe structures monitored and theresults -<br><br>
therefore show the ability of the test compound to provide relief for this aspect of the pathology.<br>
Treatment of Crohn's disease in dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid-induced inflammatory bowel syndrome model rats: Wistar derived male or female rats weighing 200 ± 20 g and fasted for 24 hours were used. Distal colitis was induced by intra-colonic instillation of 2,4-dinitrobenzene sulfonic acid (DNBS, 25 mg in 0.5 mL ethanol 30%) after which air (2 mL) was gently injected through the cannula to ensure that Ihe solution remained in the colon. A test compound and/or vehicle was administered orally 24 and 2 hours before DNBS instillation and then daily for 5 days. One control group" was similarly treated with vehicle alone while the other is treated with vehicle plus DKBS. The animals were sacrificed 24 hours after the final dose of test compound admirustration and each colon was removed and weigihed. Colon-to~ body weight ratio was then calculated for each animal according to the formula: Colon (g)/BW X 100. The "Net" increase in ratio of Vehicle-control + DNBS group relative to Vehicle-control group was used as a base for comparison with test substance treated groups and expressed as *'% Deduction." Pyrimidine compounds of this invention (e.g.. Compound 12) reproducibly had about 30% deductioa A 30% or more reduction in colon-to-body weight ratio, relative to the vehicle treated control group, was considered significant.<br>
Rats treated with test substance orally showed a marked reduction in the inflammatory response. These experiments were repeated three times and the effects were reproducible.<br>
Treatment of Crohn's disease in CD4* CD45Rb''+ T cell-reconstituted SCW colitis model mice: Spleen cells were prepared from normal female BALB/c mice. For cell purification, the following anti-mouse antibodies were used to label non-CD4'+ T ceUs: B220 (RA3-6B2), CDUb (Ml/70), and CD8a (53-+.72). All antibodies were obtained from BioSource (Camarillo, CA). M450 anti-rat IgG-coated magnetic beads (Dynal, Oslo, Norway) were used to bind the antibodies and negative selection was accomplished using an MPC-1 magnetic concentrator. Ilie enriched CD4* cells were then labeled for cell sorting with FITC-conjugated CD45RB (16A, Phaimingen, San DiegOi CA) and PE-conjugated CD4 (CT-CD4, Caltag, BurUngame, CA). CD4'+ CD45RB'+* cells were operationally defined as the upper 40% of<br><br>
CD45Rb-staining CD4+ cells and sorted iinder sterile conditions by flow cytomedy. Harvested cells were resuspended at 4+ 1 O+AnL in PBS and injected 100 +L intraperitoneally iato female C.B-17 SCID mice. Pyrimidine compounds of this invention (e.g.. Compound 12) and/or vehicle was orally administCTed once a day, 5 days per week, starting the day following the transfer. The transplanted SCID mice were weighed wedcly and their clinical condition was monitored.<br>
Colon tissue samples were fixed in 10% buffered formalin and embedded in paraffin. Sections (4 μm) collected from ascending, .transverse, and descending colon were cut and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The severity of colitis was detenrdned based on histological examination of the distal colon sections, whereby the extent of colonic inflanamation was graded on a scale of 0-3 in each of four -criteria: crypt elongation, cell infiltration, dqiletion of goblet cells, and the number of crypt abscesses.<br>
LP lymphocytes were isolated from freshly obtmied colonic specimens. After removal of payer's patches, the colon was washed in Ca/Mg-fiee HESS, cut into 0.5 cm pieces and incubated twice in HESS containing EDTA (0.75 mM), DTT (1 mM), and antibiotics (amphotericin 2.5 p-g/mL, gentamicin 50 +g/mL flx)m Sigma) at SyC for 15 min. Next, the tissue was digested fiu+er in RPMI containing 0.5 mg/mL coUagenase D, 0.01 mg/mL DNase 1 (Boehringer Manheim), and aatibiotics at 37°C. LP cells were then layered on a 40-100% Percoll gradient (Phaimacia, Uppsala, Sweden), and lymphocyte-enriched populations were isolated from the cells at the 40-100% interface.<br>
To measure cytokine production, 48-well plates were coated with 10 jig/mL murine anti-CD3e antibody (145-2C11) in carbonate buffer (PH 9.6) overnight at 4*'C. 5xlO+LPceUs were then cultured in 0.5ml of complete medium in precoated wells in the presence of 1 fig/mL soluble anti-CD28 antibody (37.51). Purified antibodies were obtained from Pharmingai. Culture supematants were removed after 48 h and assayed for cytokine production. Murine IFNy was measured using an ELISA kit from +dogen (Cambridge, MA), according to the manufactuira's instnictions.<br>
Histological analysis showed that oral administration of pyrimidine compounds of tths invention (e.g., Compound 12) reduced colonic inflammation as compared to vehicle control. The supprrasive effect was dose-dependrait with a<br><br>
substantial reduction at a dose of 10 mg/kg. The calculated colon-to-body weight ratio was consistent with the histological score, showing atternation by treatment with the test compound. Furthennore, analysis of cytokines from LP cells in response to anti-CD3 antibody and anti-CD28 antibody demonstrated that LP cells from vehicle control produced an augmented level of IFNy and treatment with test substance greatly diminished the production. These results clearly demonstrated the potential of the test substance in treatment of inflammatory bowel disease represented hy Crohn's disease.<br>
