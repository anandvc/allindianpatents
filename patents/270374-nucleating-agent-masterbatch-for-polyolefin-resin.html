PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes the invention and the manner in which it is  to be performed : -<br><br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a nucleating agent masterbatch for polyolefin resin and a polyolefin resin composition using the masterbatch (hereinafter also referred to as simply "masterbatch" and "resin composition"). More particularly, the present invention relates to a nucleating agent masterbatch for polyolefin resin which is excellent in dispersifrility into a polyolefin resin and excellent in improving effects of transparency and mechanical strength of the polyolefin resin and a polyolefin resin composition using the masterbatch.<br>
Background Art<br>
In a crystalline polymer of the polyolefin resin such as polyethylene, polypropylene or polybutene-1, there were problems such as its long molding cycle due to its slow crystallization rate after heat molding. In addition, there were some cases where molded articles altered their shape because crystallization proceeded even after the molding. Also, since these - crystalline polymers generate large crystals when subjected to the heat molding, there were drawbacks in that the strength of the molded article are not sufficient and its transparency are poor.<br>
These drawbacks are originated from the crystalline ability of the crystalline polymer. It has been known that the drawbacks can be solved by rapidly generating fine crystals. Currently, in order to rapidly generate the fine crystals, a method of adding a nucleating agent, crystallization promoting agent or the like is employed, in addition to a method of rising a crystallization temperature.<br>
Examples of the above-mentioned nucleating agent or crystallization promoting agent include carboxylic acid metal salts such as sodium benzoate, aluminum 4-<br><br>
tertiary butyl benzoate salts or sodium adipic acid; phosphate metal salts such as sodium bis(4-tertiary butyl phenyl)phosphate or sodium 2,2'-methylenebis (4,6-di-tertiary butyl phenyl)phosphate; and compounds such as polyalcohol derivatives (e.g. dibenzylidene sorbitol, bis(methyl benzylidene)sorbitol or bis(dimethyl benzylidene)sorbitol). These nucleating agents and crystallization promoting agents are disclosed, for example, in Patent Documents 1 to 9.<br>
In addition, Patent Documents 10 to 14 report a combined use of a nucleating agent made of a phosphate metal salt and an aliphatic organic acid metal salt. Further, Patent Document 15 reports a nucleating agent made of a phosphate metal salt having an average diameter of the longer axis of not more than 10 um, an average aspect ratio of not more than 10 and a bulk specific gravity of not less than 0.1. Furthermore, as means for improving the transparency of crystalline resin, a technique using a nucleating agent and petroleum resin in combination has been known, which is reported, for example, in Patent Documents 16 to 19.<br>
Further, in a sole addition of the nucleating agent to resin, there are problems such as working environment accompanying an addition of powders; as well as a problem of handling ability such as blocking by secondary aggregation of the nucleating agent. Due to this, the nucleating agent has been made into a masterbatch and, for example, Patent Documents 20 and 21 report masterbatches for polyolefin resin.<br>

Disclosure of the Invention<br>
Problems to be Solved by the Invention<br>
As described above, with regard to the nucleating agent used in the polyolefin resin, thus far a wide variety of studies have been conducted, but sufficient results have not been obtained. For example, the nucleating agents disclosed in Patent Documents 10 to 14 are not sufficient in terms of compatibility with crystalline<br><br>
polymers and dispersibility into the crystalline polymers and therefore desired effects of addition are not attained, which is problematic. Also, the nucleating agent disclosed in Patent Document 15 has, when added to the crystalline polymer, effects of improving transparency and mechanical strength but has not been satisfactory. Further, the petroleum resins described in Patent Documents 16 to 19 are general petroleum resins of the market and any of these were not good. Furthermore, both of the masterbatches for polyolefin resin disclosed in Patent Documents 20 and 21 have a small nucleating agent content and a little merit as a masterbatch. Also, in general, a masterbatch containing a nucleating agent at a high concentration has poor dispersibility when added to the polyolefin resin. Because of this, the agent was not satisfactory in terms of nucleating effects such as transparency and mechanical strength of the resin.<br>
Therefore, an object of the present invention is to provide a nucleating agent masterbatch for polyolefin resin which is excellent in dispersibility into a polyolefin resin; the masterbatch being capable of improving transparency and mechanical strength of the polyolefin resin, which is a crystalline polymer; which masterbatch is further excellent in resistance to heat coloring; and a polyolefin resin composition using the masterbatch.<br>
Means for Solving the Problems<br>
In order to solve the above-mentioned problems, the present inventors intensively studied to discover that a masterbatch excellent in compatibility with a polyolefin resin can be obtained by blending a prescribed amount of a specific aromatic phosphate metal salt as a nucleating agent, in particular, a prescribed amount of a specific fatty acid metal salt, into a fully hydrogenated petroleum resin having a softening point of not lower than 100°C; and, by using this, a polyolefin resin<br><br>
excellent in transparency, mechanical strength and resistance to heat coloring can be obtained, thereby completing the present invention.<br>
Hence, the nucleating agent masterbatch for polyolefin resin according to the present invention comprises, based on 100 parts by mass of the fully hydrogenated petroleum resin (A) having a softening point of not lower than 100°C, 3 to 150 parts by mass of the aromatic phosphate metal salt (B) represented by the following general formula (1):<br><br>
(wherein, R1 represents a C4-C8 alkyl group; R2 represents a hydrogen atom or a C1 C8 alkyl group; R3 represents a C1-C4 alkylidene group; M1 represents an alkaline metal atom, an alkaline earth metal atom or an aluminum atom; in cases where M1 is the alkaline metal atom, p is 1 and q is 0, in cases where M1 is the alkaline earth metal atom, p is 2 and q is 0, and in cases where M1 is the aluminum atom, p is 1 or 2 and q equals to 3-p.)<br>
In the masterbatch according to the present invention, it is preferred that 0.1 to 100 parts by mass of the metal salt of fatty acid or hydroxy fatty acid (C) represented by the following general formula (2) is further blended:<br><br><br><br>
(wherein R4 represents a group introduced from a C8-C30 aliphatic organic acid; M2 represents an alkaline metal atom, an alkaline earth metal atom, an aluminum atom or a zinc atom; and r represents an integer of 1 to 3.)<br>
Also, the masterbatch according to the present invention is preferably used in polypropylene or polyethylene resin as a polyolefin resin.<br>
In addition, the polyolefin resin composition according to the present invention is added the above-mentioned nucleating agent masterbatch for polyolefin resin according to the present invention to a polyolefin resin.<br>
Effects of the Invention<br>
According to the present invention, by the above-mentioned structure, a nucleating agent masterbatch for polyolefin resin excellent in compatibility with a polyolefin resin, the nucleating agent masterbatch being capable of improving transparency and mechanical physical property of the polyolefin resin, which is a crystalline polymer, which nucleating agent masterbatch is excellent in resistance to heat coloring; and a polyolefin resin composition using the masterbatch can be attained.<br>
Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Preferred modes of the present invention will now be described in detail below.<br>
The fully hydrogenated petroleum resin (A) used in the present invention having a softening point of not lower than 100°C is a resin obtained by hydrogenating a polymer or copolymer of C5 fraction of distillate obtained by naphtha cracking, such as isoprene, cyclopentadiene or piperylene, and C9 fraction of distillate such as<br><br>
indene, vinyltoluene, styrene or a-methylstyrene, and the resin having a softening point (softening point measurement method: JIS K 2207 Ring and Ball method) of not lower than 100°C. Concrete examples thereof include trade name ARKON P-115 (softening point 114°C) manufactured by Arakawa Chemical Industries, Ltd., trade name ARKON P-140 (softening point 140°C) manufactured by Arakawa Chemical Industries, Ltd. and trade name MARUKAREZ H505 (softening point 103°C) manufactured by Maruzen Petrochemical Co., Ltd. Aliphatic petroleum resins and partially hydrogenated petroleum resins are not preferred because of their poor resistance to heat coloring when the polyolefin resin is added. Also, ones having a softening point of less than 100°C are not preferred because not only are transparency and mechanical physical property of the resin poor but heat discoloration of the resin and blocking of the master batch are likely to occur.<br>
In the aromatic phosphate metal salt (B) represented by the above-mentioned general formula (1) used in the present invention, examples of the C4-C8 alkyl group represented by R1 include butyl, secondary butyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, tertiary pentyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, heptyl, octyl, isooctyl and tertiary octyl.<br>
Examples of the C4-C8 alkyl group represented by R2 include methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, secondary butyl, tertiary butyl, pentyl, tertiary pentyl, hexyl, cyclohexyl, heptyl, octyl, isooctyl and tertiary octyl.<br>
Examples of the C1-C4 alkylidene group represented by R3 include methylene, ethylidene, propylidene and butylidene.<br>
Examples of the metals represented by M1 include alkali metals such as lithium, sodium or potassium, alkaline earth, metals such as magnesium or calcium, and aluminum.    Among these, the alkali metals are preferred because of their superior<br><br>
effects as a nucleating agent.<br>
Examples of a method for producing the aromatic phosphate metal salt ((B) component) represented by the above-mentioned general formula (1) according to the present invention include a method in which a cyclic phosphoric acid with a corresponding structure and a metal compound such as a metal hydroxide, metal oxide, metal halide, metal sulphate, metal nitrate and metal alkoxide compound, are allowed to react using, as necessary, a reagent such as a basic compound; a method in which a alkali metal salt of a cyclic phosphate with a corresponding structure and, a metal compound such as a metal hydroxide, metal oxide, metal halide, metal sulphate, metal nitrate and metal alkoxide compound, are subjected to a salt exchange reaction using, as necessary, a reagent; and a method in which cyclic phosphorus oxychloride is used as a starting substance to generate cyclic phosphoric acid by hydrolysis and is allowed to react with a metal compound.<br>
More specific examples of the compound represented by the above-mentioned general formula (1) include the following compounds Nos. 1 to 8. Yet, the present invention is by no means restricted by the following compounds.<br><br><br>
Concrete examples in cases where M1 is an alkaline earth metal atom include the following compounds Nos. 9 to 12.<br><br>
Concrete examples in cases where M1 is an aluminum atom include the following compounds No. 13 to No. 16.<br><br><br><br>
The blending ratio between the aromatic phosphate metal salt (B) represented by the above-mentioned general formula (1) according to the present invention and the fully hydrogenated petroleum resin (A) is 3 to 150 parts by mass of the (B) component based on 100 parts by mass of the (A) component. When the (B) component is less than 3 parts by mass, effects as a nucleating agent, such as transparentizing effects, decrease. Meanwhile, when the (B) component exceeds 150 parts by mass, compatibility with a polyolefin resin is impaired and properties such as transparency deteriorate.<br>
In the metal salt of fatty acid or hydroxy fatty acid (C) represented by the above-mentioned general formula (2) according to the present invention, the R4 group is a group introduced from a C8-C30 aliphatic organic acid. This aliphatic organic acid may have a hydroxyl group and may have an unsaturated bond. Concrete examples include capric acid, neodecanoic acid, undecanoic acid, lauric acid, tridecanoic acid, myristic acid, pentadecanoic acid, palmitic acid, margaric acid, stearic acid, nonadecanoic acid, arachidic acid, behenic acid, lignoceric acid, cerotic acid, montanic acid, melissic acid, obtusilic acid, linderic acid, tsuzuic acid, palmitoleic acid, petroselinic acid, oleic acid, elaidic acid, vaccenic acid, linoleic acid, linoelaidic acid, Y-linolenic acid, linolenic acid, ricinoleic acid, 12-hydroxystearic acid, naphthenic acid and abietic acid. Among these, stearic acid or 12-hydroxy stearic acid is preferred because of its low cost and prominent effect of use. Also, examples of the alkaline metal atom represented by M2 include lithium, sodium and potassium; and examples of the alkaline earth metal include magnesium, calcium, strontium and barium.<br>
The added amount of the fatty acid metal salt (C) according to the present invention<br>
is, based on 100 parts by mass of fully hydrogenated petroleum resin (A), preferably<br>
0.1 to 100 parts by mass because good effects of addition are attained, and more<br>
12<br><br>
preferably 1 to 50 parts by mass.<br>
A method for producing the masterbatch according to the present invention is not restricted and can be carried out by a conventional, known method. For instance, after dry blending of blend components, the resultant may be mixed using a Henschel mixer, a mill roll, a Banbury mixer, a super mixer or the like and then may be kneaded using a uniaxial extruder, a biaxial extruder or the like. This mixing and kneading is usually carried out at temperatures from not lower than a softening point temperature of a resin to approximately 300°C. From the viewpoint of resistance to heat discoloration after an addition to the polyolefin resin and performance such as transparency, it is preferred to be a low temperature range and temperatures from not lower than a softening point of the resin to 170°C are preferred.<br>
A polyolefin resin to which the masterbatch according to the present invention is applied is not restricted as long as it is a polyolefin resin, and any polyolefin resins can be employed. Concrete examples thereof include homopolymers or copolymers of a-olefins such as polypropylene, low density polyethylene, linear low density polyethylene, high density polyethylene, polybutene-1, poly-3-methylpentene, poly-4-methylpentene, cyclo-olefin polymer or ethylene-propylene copolymer.<br>
A method for blending the masterbatch according to the present invention in the polyolefin resin is not restricted and a known blending technique into resin is employed. Examples thereof include a method in which the masterbatch and powders or pellets of the polyolefin resin are mixed using a Henschel mixer or the like in the same manner as the above-mentioned conditions for the production of the masterbatch, and the resultant is kneaded using an extruder or the like.   The type of<br>
•4 n<br><br>
processing machines used, processing temperature, cooling conditions after the processing, and the like are also not restricted. It is preferred to select conditions where resin physical properties to be obtained are suitable to the intended use. This mixing and kneading is usually carried out at temperatures about 150 to 300°C<br>
The mass ratio when the masterbatch according to the present invention is blended in the polyolefin resin is an amount such that the (B) component in the masterbatch is 0.01 to 20 parts by mass, preferably 0.05 to 10 parts by mass, based on 100 parts by mass of the polyolefin resin.<br>
To the masterbatch according to the present invention or polyolefin resin composition in which the masterbatch is added in the polyolefin resin, various compounding agents which are usually used for each resin can be added as necessary. To the polyolefin resin composition according to the present invention, as these compounding agents, the above-mentioned nucleating agent (B) or fatty acid metal salt (C) may further be blended. In this case, the preferred amount of each component to be added can be determined independently of the amount of each component contained as the masterbatch in the polyolefin resin composition. Based on 100 parts by mass of the polyolefin resin, the amount of the nucleating agent (B) is in the range between 0.001 and 5 parts by mass and the amount of the fatty acid metal salt (C) is in the range between 0.001 and 5 parts by mass.<br>
Examples of various compounding agents include phenol antioxidants, sulfur antioxidants, phosphorus antioxidants, ultraviolet absorbers, hindered amine compounds, other nucleating agents, flame retardants, flame retardant assistants, lubricants, fillers, fibrous fillers, metallic soaps, hydrotalcites, antistatic agents, pigments and dyes. The amount of the compounding agent to be added to the masterbatch according to the present invention can be up to 20 parts by mass as a<br><br>
total amount of each compounding agent, based on 100 parts by mass of a masterbatch component. When the amount of the compounding agent to be added to the masterbatch is too much, effects of the present invention (dispersibility into the resin, improvement of transparency) are impaired, which is not preferred. And, the amount of the compounding agent to be added based on the polyolefin resin composition according to the present invention is as follows.<br>
Examples of the above-mentioned phenol antioxidant include 2,6-di-tert-butyl-p-cresol, 2,6-diphenyI-4-octadesiloxyphenol, distearyl(3,5-di-tert-buryl-4-hydroxybenzyl)phosphonate, l,6-hexamethylenebis[(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionic acid amide], 4,4'-thiobis(6-tert-butyl-m-cresol), 2,2'-methyIenebis(4-methyl-6-tert-butyIphenol), 2,2,-methylenebis(4-ethyl-6-tert-butylphenol), 4,4'-butylidenebis(6-tert-butyl-m-cresol), 2,2'-ethylidenebis(4,6-di-tert-butylphenol), 2,2'-ethylidenebis(4-sec-butyl-6-tert-butylphenol), l,l,3-tris(2-methyl-4-hydroxy-5-tert-butylphenyl)butane, l,3,5-tris(2,6-dimethyl-3-hydroxy-4-tert-butylbenzyl)isocyanurate, l,3,5-tris(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)isocyanurate, l,3,5-tris(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxybenzyl)-2,4,6-trimethylbenzene, 2-tert-butyl-4-methyl-6-(2-acryloyloxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylbenzyl)phenol, stearyl(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate, thiodiethylene glycol bis[(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate], l,6-hexamethyIenebis[(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionate], bis[3,3-bis(4-hydroxy-3-tert-butylphenyl)butyric acidjglycol ester, bis[2-tert-butyl-4-methyl-6-(2-hydroxy-3-tert-butyl-5-methylbenzyl)phenyl]terephthalate, l,3,5-tris[(3,5-di-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyphenyl)propionyloxyethyl]isocyanurate, 3,9-bis[l,l-dimethyl-2{[3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)propionyloxy}ethyl]-2,4,8,10-tetraoxaspiro[5.5]undecane and Methylene glycol bis[(3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxy-5-methylphenyl)propionate].

As clearly seen from the results shown in the above Tables 4 to 6, the haze values and bending modulus were prominently inferior when a masterbatch using a binder resin other than the petroleum resins of the present invention was added to polyolefin resin. Further, also regarding the type of the petroleum resin, it can be seen from the results in Table 5 that favorable resistance to heat discoloration (Y.I.) as well as relatively favorable haze values were obtained only in cases where a specific fully hydrogenated petroleum resin of the present invention was used. Moreover, it can be seen from the results in Table 6 that, also regarding the ratio of a specific fully hydrogenated petroleum resin and a specific nucleating agent, the haze values were increased, as in Comparative Example 3-1, in cases where the ratio was riot within the range of the present invention, and that favorable haze values were obtained only when the ratio was within the range of the present invention. Still further, it can be seen from the comparisons between Comparative Example 3-2 or 3-3 and Examples that the resins using the masterbatch of the present invention demonstrated a prominent effect to improve the haze value and bending modulus.<br><br>
As described in the above, by using a masterbatth in which a specific fully hydrogenated petroleum resin and a specific aromatic phosphate ester metal salt according to the present invention were employed, a polyolefin resin composition having an excellent compatibility with polyolefin resin, favorable haze value, excellent mechanical physical properties such as bending modulus and resistance to heat discoloration, can be obtained.<br><br>
