				<td>A PROCESS AND AN APPARATUS FOR PRODUCTION OF    METAL   MATRIX    COMPOSITE   TUBES<br>
FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to a process for production of metal matrix composite tubes. More particularly the process relates to a process which uses energy of shock waves generated through the detonation of an explosive powder to compact a composite powder to produce metal matrix composite tubes/tubular components.<br>
PRIOR ART;<br>
Conventional processes for production of metal matrix composite tubes involve cumbersome and expensive techniques like cold compaction, hot pressing and extrusion. One of the disadvantage of these conventional processes is that these processes involve high capital investments.<br>
Another disadvantage of the known processes is that these processes involve long processing times.<br>
Still another disadvantage of the known processes is that prolonged exposure to high temperature leads to the formation of coarse intermetallic compounds which adversely affect the properties of the composite tubes and the life of<br>
i<br>
the component is affected severely.<br>
Yet further disadvantage of the conventional processes is that in these processes there occurs degradation of the microstructure of the original powders.<br>
OBJECTS OF PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
The primary and the main object of the present invention is to provide an apparatus by which the powders of<br><br>
matrix and reinforcement materials can be compacted directly into the hollow tubular components.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an explosive compaction process for producing metal matrix composite tubes of improved quality using shock energy produced through detonation of an explosive.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to propose an explosive compaction process which produces metal matrix composite tubes of density almost similar to that obtained by conventional hot pressing and extrusion.<br>
Further object of the present invention is to propose an explosive compaction process which enables production of metal matrix composite tubes with higher volume percentages of the reinforcement of ceramic material to the extent of 50 percent by volume, which are difficult to produce by conventional processes.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to propose a process for producing metal matrix composite tubes, which is significantly economical as it avoids the requirement of large presses and extrusion machinery.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to propose an explosive compaction process which enables production of composite components directly from the raw material whereby eleminating the secondary forming operations like forging and extrusion.<br>
Still further object of the present invention is to propose a process for production of metal matrix composites which takes comparatively less time for the production of tubes as compared to the conventional processes.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to propose a process for production of metal matrix composites<br><br>
wherein  the original powder microstructure is  retained even after the compaction process is completed., DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>

DESCRIPTION OF APPARATUS<br>
Referring to Fig. 1, the apparatus for producing metal matrix composite tubes comprises of a cylindrical metallic container 2, preferably aluminium<br><br>
container,, which is axial ly located inside a collapsible cylindrical outer container 1. Container 1 may by way of example be of plastic. The metallic container 2 has a working example 20 .to 40mm internal diameter with 3 to 5mm wall thickness. A cylindrical core mandrel 3, made up of commercial wax or commercial salt,, is centrally located inside the metallic container 2,, The annular space between the mandrel 3 and the metallic container 2 is filled uniformly with the composite powder 4 to be compacted. After filling the container 2 with the powder mixture, two ends of metallic container are closed with the metallic plug 5 and 6. These plug 5 and 5 have the designs as shown in Fig. 2(c.) which are such that the projection of the plug perfectly fits into the bore of the metallic container 2. On the top end of the metallic container 2, a cone 7 ,, such as of wood is placed above the metallic, plug 5, the purpose of which is to modify the shock front. The annual cavity between the metallic container 2, wooden cone 7 and the outer plastic container 1 is packed to uniform density with explosive powder 8 containing ammonium nitrate,, TNT and a 1 u m i n i u m p o w d e r . A f t e r f i 11 i n g t  h e annular space between the metal container 2 and plastic<br><br>
container (1), the plastic container (1) is sealed from both the ends with two plastic lids (9) and (10) . The plastic cap (to) at the top end of the plastic container (1), has a hole to insert an electrical detonator (11) for detonation of the explosive.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF PROCESS<br>
According to the process of the present invention using the above-described apparatus, firstly the lower end of the metallic container (2) is closed with the metal plug (6) . Thereafter the mandrel (3) is placed at the centre of metallic container(2). The composite powder mix (4) is packed to uniform density along the length of the container (2) in the annular space between the metal container (2) and the mendrel (3). Subsequently the metal container (2) is closed on the upper end by the metal plug (5). This entire assembly is placed centrally inside the cylindrical plastic container<br>
(1)	which has been closed at lower end by plastic cap (9) . A<br>
wooden cone (7) is then placed at the top of the metallic<br>
container (2)  in order to modify the shock front.   The<br>
annular cavity between the metal container (2) and plastic<br>
container  (1)  is then packed to uniform density with<br>
explosive powder (8)containing ammonium nitrate containg TNT<br>
and aluminium powder. The upper end of the plastic container<br>
is closed with plastic cap (10). The electrical detonator<br>
(II)	is fixed in the hole at the centre of the plastic cap<br>
(11) .  The detonation of the explosive charge is done with<br>
electrical detonator (11) in  the vertical position.  This<br>
produces a convergent cylindrical shock wave which collapses<br>
the plastic container (1) and dompacts the composite powder<br>
(4) .   After compaction, the salt mandrel     are removed by<br>
dissolving in water and the wax mendrel are removed by heating the compact.<br>
Fig2(a) to 2(g) show the different perspective viqws of the components used in the apparatus shown in fig 1.<br><br>
Aluminium reinforced with Sic particulates was compacted using soluble mandrel. The tube produced is shown in Fig. 3. The tube was cut and its microstructure was studied. In these experiments distribution of SiC particulates was found to be uniform throughout the sample. This is evident from the microstruture shown in Fig.4.<br>
