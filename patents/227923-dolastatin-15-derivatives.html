				<td>DOLASTATIN 15 DERIVATIVES<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
A number of short peptides with significant activity as inhibitors of cell growth have been isolated from the Indian Ocean sea hare Dolabella  auricularia   (Bai et al. , Sioche.Ti. Pharmacology, 40:   1859-1364 (19S0) ; Beckwith et al.,   J.   Natl.   Cancer Inst.,   85:   483-488 (1993) and references cited therein).  These include Dolastatins 1-10<br>
[U.S. Patent No. 4,8iS,444, Issued to Pettit et al.)   and Dclastatin 15 (3uropean Patent Application No. 398558). Dolastatin 15, for example, markedly inhibits the growth of the National Cancer Institute"s P388 lymphocytic leukemia<br>
{PS system) cell line, a strong predictor of efficacy against various types of human malignancies .<br>
The exceedingly small amounts of the various Dolastatin peptides present in Dolabella  auricularia   (about<br><br>
difficulties in purifying amounts sufficient for evaluation and use, have motivated efforts toward the synthesis of these compounds (Roux et al., Tetrahedron 50; 5345-5360 (1994); Shioiri et al..   Tetrahedron  49: 1913-24 (1993); Patino et  al.,   Tetrahedron  48: 4115-4122 (1992) and references cited therein).  Synthetic Dolastatin 15, however, suffers from drawbacks which include poor solubility in aqueous systems and the need for expensive starting materials for its synthesis.  These, in turn, have led to the synthesis and evaluation of structurally modified Dolastatin 15 derivatives [of.: biorg. Med.   Chem. Lett.   4: 1947-50 (1994); WO 93 03054; JP-A-06234790; WO 93 23424] .<br>
However, there is a need for synthetic compounds with the biological activity of Dolastatin 15 which have useful aqueous solubility and can be produced efficiently and economically.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Compounds of the present invention include cell growth inhibitors which are peptides of Formula I,<br><br>
and acid salts thereof, wherein A, B, D, E, F, G and K are a-amino acid residues, and s and r are each, independently, 0 or 1.  L is a monovalent radical, such as, for example, an amino group, an N-substituted amino group, a p-hydroxylamino group, a hydrazido group, an alkoxy group, a thioalkoxy group, an aminoxy group, or an oximato group.<br><br>
Another aspect of the present invention includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
An additional embodiment of the present invention is a method for treating cancer in a mammal, such as a human, comprising administering to the mammal an effective amount of a compound of Formula I in a pharmaceutically acceptable composition.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to peptides having antineoplastic activity.  It also includes pharmaceutical compositions comprising these compounds and methods for treating cancer in a mammal, including a human, by administration of these compositions to the mammal.<br>
Dolastatin 15, a peptide isolated from the sea hare Dolabella  auricularia, is a potent inhibitor of cell growth.  This compound, however, is present in trace quantities in the sea hare, and is thus difficult to isolate.  Dolastatin 15 is also expensive to s"ynthesize and suffers from poor aqueous solubility.  As shown herein, however, Dolastatin 15 can serve as a starting point for the development of compounds which overcome these disadvantages while retaining antineoplastic activity or exhibiting greater antineoplastic activity than the natural product.  Applicants have discovered that certain structural modifications of Dolastatin 15 provide compounds with a surprisingly improved therapeutic potential for the treatment of neoplastic diseases as compared to Dolastatin 10 and Dolastatin 15.  Furthermore, the compounds of the present invention can be conveniently synthesized, as described below in detail.<br><br>
For the purposes cf the present invention, the term "monovalent radical" is intended to mean an  electrically-neutral molecular fragment capable of forming one covalent bond with a second neutral molecular fragment.  Monovalent radicals include the hydrogen atom, alkyl groups, such as methyl, ethyl and propyl groups, halogen atoms, such as fluorine, chlorine and bromine atoms, aryl groups, such as phenyl and naphthyl groups, and alkoxy groups, such as methoxy and ethoxy groups.  Two monovalent radicals on adjacent sigma-bonded atoms can also together form a pi bond between the adjacent atoms.  Two monovalent radicals may also be linked together, for example, by a polymethylene unit, to form a cyclic structure.  For example, the unit -N(R)R", wherein R. and R" are each a monovalent radical, can, together with the nitrogen atom, form a heterocyclic ring.  In addition, two monovalent radicals bonded to the same atom can together form a divalent radical, such as an oxygen atom or an alkylidene group, for example, a propylidene group.<br>
For the purposes of the present invention, the term "normal alkyl" refers to an unbranched, or straight chain, alkyl group, for example, normal propyl (rr-propyl, -CH2CH2CH3).<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be represented by Formula 1,<br><br>
wherein A, B, D, E, F, G, and K are a-amino acid residues; s and r are each, independencly, 0 or 1; and L is a monovalent radical   such as  an  amino group, an  N"-substituted amino group, a j3-hydroxy!amino group, a hydrazidc group, an<br><br>
alkoxy group, a thioalkoxy group, an aminoxy group, or an cximato group.<br>
The peptides of Formula I are generally composed of L-amino acids but they can contain one or more D-amino acids.  In the following discussion, reference to a particular amino acid includes both enantiomers unless a specific enantiomer is indicated.  The present compounds can also be present as salts with physiologically-compatible acids, including hydrochloric acid, citric acid, tartaric acid, lactic acid, phosphoric acid, methanesulfonic acid, acetic acid, formic acid, maleic acid, fumaric acid, malic acid, succinic acid, malonic acid, sulfuric acid, L-glutamic acid, L-aspartic acid, pyruvic acid, mucic acid, benzoic acid, glucuronic acid, oxalic acid, ascorbic acid and acetylglycine.<br>

Synthetic Methods<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be prepared by known methods of peptide synthesis.  Thus, the peptides can be assembled sequentially from individual amino acids or hy  linking suitable small peptide fragments.  In sequen¬tial assembly, the peptide chain is extended stepwise, starting at the C-terminus, by one amino acid per step.  In fragment coupling, fragments of different lengths can be linked together, and the fragments in turn can be obtained by sequential assembly from amino acids or by fragment coupling of still shorter peptides.<br>
In both sequential assembly and fragment coupling it is necessary to link the units by forming an amide linkage, which can be accomplished via a variety of enzymatic and chemical methods.  Chemical methods for forming the amide lin.kage ara described in detail in standard references on peptide chemistry, including Miiller, Methoden de?r praanischen Ch,emi&gt; Vol, XV/2, 1-364, Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart, (1974); Stewart: and Young, Solid Phase Peptide<br><br>
Synthegj-s. 31-34 and 71-82, Pierce Chemical Company, Rockford, IL (1984); Eodanszky et  ai. , Peptjie 5vnthe=;-i g. 85-128, John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York, (1976) .  Preferred methods include the azide method, the symmetric and mixed anhydride method, the use of in situ  generated or prsformed active esters, the use of urethane protected N-carboxy anhydrides of amino acids and the formation of the amide linkage using coupling reagents, such as carboxylic acid activators, especially dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC), diisopropylcarbodiimide (DIC) , l-ech.oxycarbcnyl-2-ethoxy-1,2-dihydroqiiinoline (EEDQ) , pivaloyl chloride, 1-ethyl-3 - {3-dimenhylaminopropyl)carbodiimide hydrochloride (EDCI), n-propanephosphonic anhydride (PPA), N",N"-bis (2-oxo-oxazolidinyl) amidophosphoryl chloride {BOP-Cl) , bromo-tris (pyrrolidine)phosphonium hexafluorophosphate (PyBrop), diphenylphosphoryl azide (DPPA), Castro"s reagent (SOP, PyBop),<br>
0-benzotrlazolyl-N,N,N",N"-tetramethyluronium salts (HBTU), 0-azabenzotriazolyl-N,N,N",N"-tetramethyluronium salts (HATU) , diethylph.osphoryl cyanide (DEPCN) ,<br>
2,5-diphenyl-2,3- dihydro-3-oxo-4- hydroxythiophene dioxide (Steglich"s reagent; HOTDO), and 1,1"-carbonyldiimidasole (GDI).  The coupling reagents can be employed alone or in combination with additives such as N,N-dimethyl-4-aminopyridine (DMA.P) , N-hydroxy-benzotriazole (HOBt), N-hydroxyazabenzotriasole (KOAt), K-hydroxybenzotriazine (HOOEt), N-hydroxysuccinimide (HOSu) or 2-hycroxypyridine.<br>
Although the use of protecting croups is generally noc necessary in enzymatic peptide synthesis, reversible protection of reactive groups not involved in formation of the amide linkage is necessary for both reactants in<br><br>
chemical synthesis.  Three conventional protective group techniques are preferred for chemical peptide synthesis: the benzyloxycarbonyl (Z), the t-butoxycarbonyl (Boc) and the 9-fluorenylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc) technicrues. Identified in each case is the protective group on the 3(-amino group of the chain-extending unit.  A detailed review of amino-acid protective groups is given by Miiller, Methoden der oraanischp.n Chemie Vol. XV/l, pp 20-906, Thieme Verlag, Stuttgart (1974).  The units employed for assembling the peptide chain can be reacted in solution, in suspension or by a method similar to that described by Merrifield, J.   Am.   Chem.   Soc.   85: (1963) 2149.<br>
Solvents suitable for peptide synthesis include any solvent which is inert under the reaction conditions, especially water, N,K-dimethylformamide (DMF), dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), acetonitrile, dichloromethane (DCM), 1,4-dioxane, tetrahydrofuran (THE), N-methyl-2-pyrrolidone (NMP) and mixtures of these solvents.<br>
Peptide synthesis on the polymeric support can be carried out in a suitable inert organic solvent in which the amino acid derivatives starting materials are soluble. However, preferred solvents additionally have resin-swelling properties, such as DMF, DCM, NMP, acetonitrile and DMSO, and mixtures of these solvents.  Following synthesis, the pepnide is removed from the polymeric support.  The conditions under which this cleavage is accomplished for various resin types are disclosed in the literature.  The cleavage reactions most commonly used are acid- or palladium-catalyzed, the former being conducted in, for example, liquid anhydrous hydrogen fluoride, anhydrous trifluoromethanesulfonic acid, dilute or concentrated trifluoroacetic acid, and acenic acid/<br><br>
dichloromethane/trifluoroethanol mixtures.  The latter can be carried out in THF or THF-DCM-mixtures in the presence of a weak base, such as morpholine.  Certain protecting groups are also cleaved off under these conditions.<br>
Partial deprotection of the peptide may also be necessary prior to certain derivatisaticn reactions.  For example, peptides dialkylated at the N-cerminus can be prepared by coupling the appropriate N,N-di- alkylamino acid to Che peptide in solution or on the polymeric support, by reductive alkylation of the resin-bound peptide in DMF/l% acetic acid with NaCNBHj and the appropriate aldehyde or by hydrogenation of the peptide in solution in the presence of the appropriate aldehyde or ketone and Pd/carbon.<br>
The various non-naturally occurring amino acids as well as the various non-amino acid moieties disclosed herein can be obtained from commercial sources or synthesized from comm.ercially available staring materials using methods known in the art.  For example, amino acid building blocks with R* and R groups can be prepared according to the method described by Wuensch and Weyl, Methodp der OraanischR Chemie. vol. XV, Springer Verlag: Stuttgart, p. 306 (1974) and references cited therein.<br>
Methods of Use of the Claimed Compounds<br>
In another eTJDodiment, the present invention comprises a method for partially or zotally inhibiting formation of, or otherwise treating (e.g. , reversing or inhibiting the further development of} sclid tumors {e.g., tumors of the lung, breast, colon, prostane, bladder, rectum, or endometrial tumors) or hematological malignancies (e.g., leukemias, lymphomas) in a mammal, for example, a hum.an, by<br><br>
administering to the mammal a therapeutically effective amount of a compound or a combination of compounds of Formula I.  The compound(s) may be administered alone or in a pharmaceutical composition comprising the compound(s) and an acceptable carrier or diluent.  Administration can be by any of the means which are conventional for pharmaceutical, preferably oncological, agents, including oral and parenteral means, such as subcutaneously, intravenously, intramuscularly and intraperitcneally, nasally or rectally. The compounds may be administered alone or in the form of pharmaceutical compositions  containing  a compound or compounds of Formula I together with a pharmaceutically accepted carrier appropriate for the desired routs of administration.  Such pharmaceutical compositions may be combination products, i.e., they may also contain other therapeutically active ingredients.<br>
The dosage to be administered to the mammal, such as a human, will contain a therapeutically effective amount of a compound described herein.  As used herein,<br>
"therapeutically effective amount" is an amount sufficient to inhibit (partially or totally) formation of a tumor or a hematological malignancy or to reverse development cf a solid tumor or other malignancy or prevent or reduce its further progression.  For a particular condition or method of treatment, the dosage is determined empirically, using known methods, and will depend upon factors such as the biological activity cf the particular com.pound employed; the means of administration; the age, health and body weight of the recipient; the nature and extent of the symptoms; the freq"j.ency at  treatment; the administration of other therapies; and the effect desired.  A typical daily dose will be from about 0.05 to about 50 milligrams per<br><br>
kilogram of body weight by oral administration and from about 0.01 to about 20 milligrams per kilogram of body //eight by parenteral administration.<br>
The compounds of the present invention can be administered in conventional solid or liquid pharmaceutical administration forms, for example, uncoated or (film-)coated tablets, capsules, powders, granules, suppositories or solutions,  These are produced in a ;onventional manner.  The active substances can for this purpose be processed with conventional pharmaceutical aids such as tablet binders, fillers, preservatives, tablet iisintegrants, flow regulators, plasticizers, wetting agents, dispersants, emulsifiers, solvents, sustained release compositions, antioxidants and/or propellant gases (cf. H. Sucker et al.:   pharmazeutische Technologje, rhieme-Verlag, Stuttgart, 1978).  The administration forms obtained in this way typically contain from about 1 to ibout 90% by weight of the active substance.<br>
The present invencion will now be illustrated by the rollowing examples, which are not limiting.<br><br>
EXAMPLES<br>
The proteinogenous amino acids are abbreviated in the examples using the known three-letter code.  Other abbreviations employed are; TFA = trifluoroacetic acid, Ac = acetic acid, DCM = dichlcromethane, DMSO =<br>
dimethylsulfoxide, Bu = butyl, Et = ethyl, Me = methyl, B2I = benzyl.  In the compounds listed, all proteinogenous amino acids are L-amino acids unless otherwise noted. Other abbreviations used: Me2Val = N,N-dimethylvaline, MeVal = N-methylvaline, Bn = benzyl, MejAib = [2-N",N"-dimethylaraino] -isobutyric acid.<br>
General Procedures<br>
The peptides of the invention are synthesized either by classical solution synthesis using standard Z- and Boc-methodology as described above or by standard methods of solid-phase synthesis using Boo and Fm.oc protective group techniques.<br>
In the case of solid phase synthesis, the N,N-dialkyl-penta- or hexapeptide acids are liberated from the solid support and further coupled with the corresponding C-terminal amines in solution. BOP-CI and PyBrop were used as reagents for coupling of the amino acid following the N-methylarriinc acids. The reaction times were correspondingly increased. For reductive alkylation of the N-terminus, the peptide-resin was deprotected at the N Cerininus and then reacted wich a 3-fold molar excess of aldehyde or ketone in DMF/1% acetic acid with addition of 3 equivalents of NaCNEKj. After the reaction was complete (negative Kaiser test) the resin was washed several times with water, isoprccanol, DM? and dichlcromethane.<br><br>
In solution synthesis, the use of either Boc-orotected amino acid NCAs (N-tert.-butyloxycarbonyl-amino acid-N-carboxy-anhydrides), Z-protected amino acid NCAs (N-benzyloxycarbonyl-amino acid-N-carboxy-anhydrides) , or the use of pivaloyl chloride as condensing agent" respectively is most advantageous for coupling of the amino acid following the N-methylamino acids. Reductive alkylation of the N terminus can e.g. be achieved hy reaction of the N-terminally deprotected peptides or amino acids with the corresponding aldehydes or ketones using NaCNBHa or hydrogen-Pd/C.<br>

In  vitro  Methodology<br>
Cytotoxicity was measured using a standard methodology for adherent cell lines, such as the microculture tetrazolium assay [MTT).  Details of this assay have been published {Alley, M.C. et al., Cancer Research  48: 539-601, (198S)).  Exponentially growing cultures of HT-29 colon carcinoma cells were used to make raicrotiter plate cultures.  Cells were seeded at 5000-20,000 cells per well in 96-well plates (in 150 mL of media), and grown overnight at STC.  Test compounds were added, in. 10-fold dilutions varying from 10"" M to 10"° M. Cells were then incubated for 4S hours.  To determine the number of viable cells in each well, the MTT dye was added (50 mL of a 3 mg/mL solution of 3-(4,5-dimethylthia2ol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazoliun bromide in saline).  This mixture was incubated at 37 C for 5 hours, and then 50 mi of 25% SDS, pH 2, was added to each well.  After an overnight incubation, the absorbance of each well at 550 nm was read using an ELISA reader. The values for the mean +/- SD of data from replicated wells were calculated, using the formula % T/C (% viable cells treated/control).  The concentration of test compound which gives a T/C of 50% growth inhibition was designated as the IC5Q,<br>
Table 3 presents the IC5Q values determined in the HT-29 assay for a series of compounds of the invention.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Compounds of this invention may be further tested in any of the various preclinical assays for in vivo  activity which are indicative of clinical utility.  Such assays are conducted with nude mice into which tumor tissue, preferably of human origin, has been transplanted ("xenografted"), as is well known in this field.  Test compounds are evaluated for their anti-tumor efficacy following administration to the xenograft-bearing mice.<br>
More specifically, human tumors grown in athymic nude mice can be transplanted into new recipient animals, using<br><br>
cumor rragmencs wnicn are aDOuc bu mg m size.  The day of transplantation is designated as day 0.  Six to ten days later, Che mice are treated with the test compounds given as an intravenous or intraperitoneal injection, in groups of 5-10 mice at each dose.  Compounds are given daily for 5 days, 10 days or 15 days, at doses from 10-100 mg/kg body weight.  Tumor diameters and body weights are measured twice weekly.  Tumor masses are calculated using the diameters measured with Vernier calipers, and the formula:<br><br>
Mean tumor weights are then calculated for each treatment group, and T/C values are determined for each group relative to the untreated control tumors.<br><br>
