FJELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention in general relates to the field of communication via Facsimile or Facsimile based Multi Function Peripheral (MFP) devices. Further, this invention relates to the sphere of remote controlling technology applied to facsimile devices. More particularly, this invention relates to a method for remote controlling of facsimile devices using protocol interpreting script.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Facsimile devices are usually connected to PSTN and operate on the ITU-T T.30 protocol. ITU-T T.30 is "procedures for document facsimile transmission in the general switched telephone network" according to recommendation T.30 of Telecommunication Standardization Sector and International Telecommunication Union (ITU). Modern facsimile devices can also work on IP networks (ITU-T T.38) while maintaining their compliance with T.30.<br>
Remote controlling techniques help in remote diagnostics, control and configuration of facsimile devices. Remote controlling works with the help of vendor-specific (the facsimile system and protocol as defined by each vendor) Non-Standard Facilities (NSF/NSC) signal options allowed by ITU-T T.30. Using remote controlling service, engineers can access the facsimile device via a network so that the diagnostic tests can be performed and logs etc. can be viewed. It is also possible to view and modify the settings whenever required.<br>
The need for remote controlling facsimile devices arises because of limitations in typical facsimile user interfaces. When there is a request from customers to set up or configure their machines, service or support engineers can connect to the facsimile device through telephone number and perform remote controlling using any of several remote controlling tools. A computer based remote controlling program with a graphical user interface is an efficient tool for such remote<br><br>
controlling. One major attraction of remote controlling is that the remote controlling byte-protocol by itself can accommodate future devices since it is the interpretation of byte codes, byte sequences and ranges of permissible values that change with models. It is also advantageous in remote controlling that the system can receive unsolicited information like Toner orders, Critical error reports etc from the facsimile-device.<br>
Unites States Patent no. 5,226,074 (Han July 6, 1993) titled "Remote control method of a facsimile device" assigned to Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (Suwon, KR) teaches a method of remote controlling a facsimile device using another facsimile device called a Center Fax Machine. Here the scope of remote controlling involves viewing and setting of configurable parameters such as Telephone Number, Speed Dial list, One Touch Dial list etc. on a facsimile machine in the network. But the Centre Fax Machine used here has to be of the same model as that of the device being controlled.<br>
Another method, which dynamically generates user-interfaces using an application protocol parser is known from United States Patent 6,292,186 (November 6, 1998) titled "Universal information appliance with parser"<br>
assigned to International Business Machines Corporation (Armonk, NY). It talks about storing the user-interface information in the application protocol format inside devices. This work covers a computer-implemented method for dynamically rendering a graphical user interface (GUI) based on the GUI establishing instructions extracted by parsing the stored user-interface information from the device.<br>
Both of the above patents are related to the present invention and therefore included herein by reference.<br>
Even though the referenced prior art achieves its technical effects it has some limitations. For example in the US Patent titled "Remote control method of a facsimile device" the scope of remote controlling is only restricted to viewing<br><br>
and setting of configurable parameters such as Telephone Number, Speed Dial list. One Touch Dial list etc. on a facsimile machine in the network where the configuring Fax Machine has to be of the same model as that of the device being controlled and it needs to show results by printing. Also there is no feature of generating a dynamic GUI creation which could assist in configuring any facsimile machine over computer based application. Similarly the US Patent titled "Universal information appliance with parser" talks about a computer based dynamic GUI generation but the work does not cover the method to transmit the stored GUI information on the device to the computer specifically for facsimile machines where the data can be retrieved over switched telephone network based on specific protocols.<br>
The present invention proposes to overcome the above drawbacks.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the present invention is, therefore, to provide a method for remote controlling of facsimile devices using protocol interpreting script.<br>
It is another object of this invention to provide a flexible method for the remote diagnosis and configuration of FAX machines by employing a single tool that can accommodate current and future devices with a scheme which understands the protocol via interpreting scripts and defines the user interface.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a tool that can accommodate a new device by acquiring its update from the device itself through facsimile polling.<br>
It is further object of the invention to provide support for new devices using script files to interpret protocol data so that the user interface will be generated dynamically for each model based on the script file.<br><br>
It is yet another object of the invention to provide a tool that can accept and store raw protocol data without interpreting and later interpret it for display when a protocol interpreting script becomes available.<br>
It is also an object of the invention to facilitate for storing the script files in device itself and thereby enabling it to be acquired by the remote controlling device when required.<br>
Accordingly the present invention comprises a method for remote controlling of facsimile devices using protocol-interpreting script, which interprets the protocol data using an application running on a remote controlling device, the method comprising the steps of:<br>
1.	accepting, storing and accessing the raw protocol data with a protocol data store located in the remote controlling device;<br>
2.	retrieving a corresponding interpretation script data from an interpretation data store located in the remote controlling device;<br>
3.	manipulating and interpreting the protocol data with the interpretation script using a facsimile simulator; and<br>
4.	creating a graphical user interface for remote diagnostics, control and configuration of the facsimile device by the simulator.<br>
Other advantages and features of the invention will become more clearly apparent from the following description of the embodiments of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF ACCOMPANYING DRAWING<br><br>
Figure 1 illustrates a network communication system connected with facsimile devices and the remote controlling devices.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawing. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
It is common knowledge to a person skilled in the art that facsimile communication involves setting up a telephone call (i.e., a fax session) to another fax machine and then exchanging digital data. A remote control facsimile session involves the exchange of protocol data on the communication line wherein the standard call setup procedures in T.30 allow the identification of the model name of the facsimile on the other end. With the advent of cyberspace technologies modern fax machines are also capable of having the fax session completely via Internet, though the digital data exchanged and their timings remain unchanged. A person having ordinary skill in the art will appreciate that the remote controlling of the Fax machines is more efficient with a computer based tool which simulates facsimile capability using a computer program and interfacing hardware for fax communication.<br>
Figure 1 is a block diagram that shows the remote controlling system according to the present invention and its arrangement with respect to other relevant<br><br>
existing systems. As already discussed, the prior art uses a special device called a Center Facsimile Machine (Also referred as a Special Remote Controlling Fax Machine). Such a system known from US Patent no 5,226,074 is shown connected to a telephone network in Figure 1. Fax machine, to be remote controlled, can be connected to the network for enabling the remote controlling operation. This method suggests remote-controlling a remote facsimile device from a center facsimile device, having a keyboard, a central processing unit for controlling the center facsimile device according to pressing keys of the keyboard. The signals generated by keyboard are transmitted to the device being configured over a modem. However this system of remote diagnostics is capable of remote controlling only a fixed set of models and cannot control additional models without a program upgrade.<br>
As a solution to the drawback in the prior art the invented art uses a computer facsimile simulator program, a store for raw protocol data and a store for the data that interprets and describes the protocol data. The "raw protocol data store" stores the general digital data (protocol data) from certain non-standard signals in a raw format and the "interpretation data store" functions as a template for the interpretation of meaning of the non-standard signal data so as to make it usable. The computer program that accesses these two data stores is capable of combining them for protocol-interpretation and creation of a User Interface so that the system can meaningfully display and manipulate the data. The manipulation of the data is performed using a processor equipped with a visual display unit as apparent from the figure. According to the teachings of the present invention, the data that interprets and describes protocol data can be stored in the device itself for later retrieval.<br>
A major attraction of the invention is the usage of script language that specifies all the necessary and vital information about the communication protocol (i.e. T.30 Non-Standard Facilities). The script file can be large and descriptive to cover scripting for as many of the custom data-types as is known. The script also contains information about the user interface for a parameter, its range of values<br><br>
and it's grouping in a user interface. It closely follows the original protocol specification such that the parameter data can be extracted from the protocol and stored whenever required.<br>
A user-application dealing with the protocol uses this script file to decode the protocol. The user-application need not require changes to itself to support new devices as each new device has a known script. Another advantage is that the script files are platform-independent (independent of operating system) so that user-applications can be written on any platform viz. UNIX, Windows, Palm, Symbian, etc. Since the support for new devices is provided using script files to interpret protocol data the need to redesign or rebuild the Remote Diagnosis &amp; Configuration Application is eliminated. The flexibility achieved herein is that the user interface will be generated dynamically for each model based on the script file. The script files may be stored on the device (to be controlled) itself to be fetched by the remote controller at a high-speed one-time operation. This facility is very advantageous when the user-application does not have a script file for that particular model. In such circumstances the script for that particular device can be fetched by "polling" the facsimile.<br>
Accordingly, the invention accomplishes a single tool for multiple facsimile models that can be easily updated to service future models. The invention confers extended functionality since all protocol data is stored in raw form and stored data can be interpreted as soon as an interpretation script file is available. It is possible because parameters are stored in the same format as they are received. They are stored as the very data stream buffer itself or as the direct corresponding text where each bit or each nibble (sequence of 4 bits) is stored as a corresponding single-text-character. Using this approach, the user interface is decided by the script. Unlike the prior art the remote controlling system receives unsolicited information like Toner orders, Critical error reports etc from the facsimile-device and advantageously stores this data without discarding or interpreting it. Therefore when a new script file is not available for a model, the known parameters only can be displayed and manipulated. Later when a script<br><br>
update  is  available  all  the  parameters  can   be  usefully  displayed  and manipulated.<br>
The script below is an example that can assist the application to generate the GUI Components:<br>

HEIGHT=20<br><br>
DEFAULT=BLANK RANGE=40<br>
This .ini like file format can be regarded as the sample script that be used to generate the dynamic GUI. This defines various configurable parameters on the facsimile machines and their respective styles on the GUI along with the sections defining the screen the respective parameter can be displayed.<br>
Even though the foregoing description assumed a particular architecture a person skilled in the art will understand and appreciate that the present invention may be used in numerous architectures and in numerous other examples with out deviating from the scope or ambit of the invention.<br>
It is to be noted that the term "Remote Control" used wherever in this document covers all remote operations on machines like Viewing Transmitted and Received message logs. Viewing and setting parameters, Performing Diagnostic Test Operations like Device Memory Test, Modem Test etc., Viewing status of Printer, Scanner etc. and Viewing value of the number of pages Printed, Scanned etc.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be denved from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, printer or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are<br><br>
apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the       appended       claims       unless       they       depart       there       from.<br><br><br><br><br>
