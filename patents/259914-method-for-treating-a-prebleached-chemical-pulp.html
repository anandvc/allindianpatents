				<td>METHOD FOR BLEACHING CHEMICAL PAPER PULPS BY FINAL OZONE TREATMENT AT<br>
HIGH TEMPERATURE<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The invention relates to the bleaching of chemical paper pulps, in particular kraft or<br>
sulphite pulps.<br>
In the context of the present invention, it has been demonstrated that the implementation<br>
of an ozone treatment, carried out at high temperature at the end of the bleaching<br>
sequence, served in particular to increase the brightness of the pulp, without reducing its<br>
quality.<br>
PRIOR ART<br>
In the method for producing bleached chemical paper pulps, a first phase called<br>
delignification consists in removing most of the lignin present in the pulp. This<br>
operation, conventionally carried out by chemical treatment with oxygen (O), is<br>
inherently accompanied by a bleaching of the pulp, due to the depletion of brown lignin.<br>
The next phase, called bleaching, consists in removing the residual lignin completely, so<br>
as to retain only the perfectly white "carbon hydrates" fraction (cellulose and<br>
hemicellulose).<br>
In general, chemical paper pulps are bleached using a succession of treatments, called a<br>
bleaching sequence, employing reagents such as chlorine dioxide (D), hydrogen<br>
peroxide (P), caustic soda (E) and again oxygen (O).<br>
For example, a modern and simple method for producing bleached chemical pulp may<br>
comprise all of the four ODED stages.<br>
Bleaching performance can be improved either by adding further stages, or by reinforcing<br>
the E stages by adding oxygen (O) or hydrogen peroxide (P). Thus, methods for<br>
producing bleached chemical pulp of the type OD(EO)D, OD(EP)D, OD(EO)DED,<br>
OD(EO)DP, D(EO)D(EP)D etc. are also found in the industry.<br>
Since 1992, ozone (Z) has been added to the list of reagents used in chemical pulp<br>
bleaching. Ozone is a highly effective oxidizing agent for lignin. However, it is a reagent<br><br>
that decomposes rapidly in aqueous medium, and which may partially oxidize the<br>
cellulose, requiring very accurate control of the operating conditions of its use.<br>
This has been done in the thirty plants in the world which have introduced ozone stages<br>
into their bleaching sequence. Various sequences are implemented, in which the ozone<br>
stage is always positioned at the start of the bleaching, that is in general after the<br>
delignification with oxygen as, for example, in the OZED, OZDED, OOZDED methods.<br>
In other words, the ozone treatment takes place before alkaline extraction (E) which may<br>
assume the E or EOP or EO or EP form.<br>
Several investigations have been conducted to identify the operating conditions<br>
promoting the bleaching action by ozone in this type of method.<br>
Thus, in the review TAPPI JOURNAL of January 1992, an article entitled "A survey of<br>
the use of ozone in bleaching pulps" by N. Liebergott et al. summarizes the conditions in<br>
which ozone must be used for bleaching pulps. It is described therein in particular that to<br>
obtain the best bleaching, the pH of the medium must be acidic, preferably about 2, and<br>
above all, that the temperature must also be as low as possible, close to 20°C, to prevent<br>
excessive decomposition of the ozone, thereby achieving a better degradation of the<br>
lignin. According to this teaching, the ozone treatment is therefore carried out in the early<br>
bleaching steps, called prebleaching, at a low temperature.<br>
In more recent articles, like the one published in the review TAPPI JOURNAL of<br>
September 1997 (Vol. 80, No. 9, pp 209-14), it has been proposed to use ozone at the end<br>
of bleaching. The application of an ozone stage on an incompletely bleached pulp, and<br>
therefore containing residual lignin, causes the virtually instantaneous disappearance of<br>
this lignin, resulting in a rapid increase in the brightness of the pulp. Although the<br>
method described is spectacular, it only serves "to gain 2 to 3 percentage points of<br>
brightness in most cases, if one wishes to avoid applying too much ozone and degrading<br>
the quality of the cellulose. In light of the prior teachings, the experiments reported have<br>
been performed taking care to avoid raising the temperature excessively.<br>
Document WO 2005/059241 also reports an ozone treatment carried out between 20 and<br>
60°C, but before the alkaline extraction, and necessarily associated with a prior<br>
acidification step at very high temperature. It also discourages exceeding these<br>
temperatures, because above this level, a degradation of the pulp is reported (loss of<br>
viscosity) and a decrease in efficiency.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is the object of the present invention to propose a more efficient ozone treatment,<br>
without increasing the quantity of ozone to be introduced nor damaging the material<br>
treated.<br>
Thus, the present invention relates to a method for treating a prebleached chemical pulp,<br>
comprising a step of ozone treatment of the said pulp, carried out at high temperature.<br>
In fact, it has been found surprisingly that if the temperature of the ozone treatment is<br>
raised above 20°C, the action of the ozone is more effective, contrary to the teachings of<br>
the prior art, which indicated that the higher the temperature, the lower the ozone activity.<br>
According to the invention, this step is advantageously carried out at a temperature above<br>
60°C, advantageously above 65°C and even more advantageously above or equal to 70°C.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment, the ozone treatment is carried out at a temperature<br>
of between 80 and 90°C. In practice, a temperature of about 80°C is preferable, in order<br>
to take advantage of the invention without compromising the energy balances of the plant<br>
and without having to work under pressure.<br>
Preferably, the ozone treatment is carried out at a temperature not exceeding 100°C.<br>
Chemical paper pulps which are intended for treatment using the method according to the<br>
invention, are hardwood and softwood pulps, and also non-wood pulps such as annual<br>
plants. The method of the invention also serves to treat pulps after kraft, sulphite and<br>
soda cooking.<br>
The method according to the invention is carried out after the delignification phase and<br>
after the first conventional steps of the bleaching sequence. It is therefore carried out on a<br>
pulp called a prebleached pulp.<br>
More precisely, the fact that a chemical pulp is prebleached can be evaluated according to<br>
its level of brightness and/or its residual lignin content.<br>
Thus, the inventive method is advantageously carried out on a pulp of which the<br>
brightness level is above 70%, advantageously above 80%, and preferably close to 85%.<br>
The brightness level is determined according to standard NF ISO 3688.<br><br>
A second criterion concerning the choice of prebleached pulps to be treated with the<br>
inventive method is the residual lignin content. Advantageously, the inventive method is<br>
carried out on a pulp of which the kappa number, correlated with the residual lignin<br>
content of the pulp, is lower than 2.5, advantageously lower than 2, and preferably lower<br>
than 1. These values should be compared with the kappa number of unbleached pulps<br>
which is generally between 20 and 30. The standard used for the kappa number is<br>
standard NF ISO 302.<br>
The inventive method is advantageously carried out on pulps meeting at least one of these<br>
two criteria (brightness and kappa number), or even both.<br>
According to one embodiment, the ozone treatment is the only step of the inventive<br>
method and therefore the final step of the treatment of the pulp. The ozone treatment is<br>
accordingly part of a more complex production method, of the type of those mentioned<br>
previously, containing stages with oxygen, with chlorine dioxide, with caustic soda, with<br>
hydrogen peroxide and optionally with ozone. For example, a complete sequence<br>
integrating the inventive method is of the type ODEDZ*, ODEDPZ*, OZEDZ*, where Z*<br>
is the treatment according to the invention.<br>
It clearly appears that the inventive method advantageously implementing on pulps at the<br>
end of treatment, and having in particular undergone an upstream alkaline extraction (E).<br>
Contrary to the prior art, no requirement exists concerning a prior treatment of the pulp,<br>
particularly a prior high temperature acidification.<br>
Alternatively, the inventive method comprises an ozone treatment step as described and at<br>
least one subsequent bleaching step. It then concerns a new ozone treatment (Z*) or a<br>
treatment with hydrogen peroxide (P), with chlorine dioxide (D), with caustic soda (E)<br>
and/or with oxygen combined with hydrogen peroxide (OP). The final bleaching<br>
treatments, which are the subject matter of the inventive method, may therefore be varied.<br>
Due to the small quantity of residual lignin in the chemical pulp to be treated, the ozone<br>
treatment of the invention is only carried out with small quantities of ozone: less than<br>
5 kg of ozone per tonne of dry pulp (or 0.5% by weight), preferably less than 2 kg of<br>
ozone per tonne (or 0.2% by weight). These moderate quantities reduce the risk of<br>
oxidizing the cellulose in a manner detrimental to its quality.<br><br>
Advantageously, the minimum proportion of ozone introduced is 0.01% or 0.05% by<br>
weight of dry pulp (0.1 kg and 0.5 kg of ozone per tonne of pulp, respectively).<br>
In the context of the invention, the pH of the pulp to be treated is not a problem because<br>
the ozone treatment step can take place at a pH of between 2 and 10. In particular, it has<br>
been demonstrated that the invention was equally advantageous at neutral pH, close to 7.<br>
Insofar as a prior acidification is not required, the inventive method may take place at a<br>
pH equal to or higher than 4. Due to the considerable advantage of being able to work at<br>
neutral pH (no addition of sulphuric acid, less corrosive liquor), the ozone treatment is<br>
advantageously carried out at a pH of between 4 (natural pH of the pulp after treatment<br>
with chlorine dioxide) and 8 (pH close to that of pure water).<br>
Particularly due to the wide range of acceptable pH, the ozone treatment of the invention<br>
can be carried out directly after the final step of the sequence used for the prior bleaching<br>
(prebleaching), and therefore without intermediate washing. This may be the case, for<br>
example, when the final stage is a treatment with chlorine dioxide.<br>
The method according to the invention, particularly the ozone treatment step, can be<br>
carried out on pulps having a wide range of consistency, corresponding to the mass ratio<br>
between the pulp and the mixture (pulp + water). Advantageously, the ozone treatment is<br>
carried out on a pulp with a consistency of between 1 and 45%, and more precisely<br>
between 2 and 3% when the low consistency technology is used, between 3 and 12%<br>
when the medium consistency technology is used, and between 35 and 40% when the<br>
high consistency technology is used.<br>
The ozone treatment method according to the present invention is particularly suitable for<br>
kraft pulps or sulphite pulps.<br>
As already stated, a more efficient ozone treatment is observed in the conditions of the<br>
invention, without increasing the quantity of ozone to be introduced nor damaging the<br>
treated material.<br>
Characteristically, it has been observed that for certain types of hardwood pulps<br>
(deciduous), this treatment further served to remove the residual compounds of the<br>
"pitch" type, and thereby to improve the cleanliness of the bleached pulp.<br><br>
EMBODIMENTS<br>
The invention and its advantages will appear more clearly from the following exemplary<br>
embodiments, in conjunction with the appended figures. However, these are non-limiting.<br>
Figure 1 shows the effect of temperature on the bleaching by ozone applied at the end of the<br>
bleaching sequence on a mixed hardwood kraft pulp.<br>
Figure 2 shows the effect of the temperature of the final bleaching treatment by ozone on the<br>
degree of polymerization of the cellulose in the case of a mixed hardwood kraft pulp.<br>
Figure 3 shows the effect of temperature on the bleaching by ozone applied at the end of a<br>
bleaching sequence on a softwood kraft pulp.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A softwood kraft pulp is treated in a known manner, having a residual lignin content<br>
corresponding to a kappa number close to 20, using a prebleaching D(EP)D sequence.<br>
The brightness obtained is 83.7% ISO.<br>
This pulp, after washing with water and acidification with sulphuric acid up to pH 2.7, is<br>
subjected to an ozone treatment, with a consistency of 35%, in a conventional laboratory<br>
device consisting of a rotating glass reactor in a water bath having a variable temperature<br>
between 20 and 80°C.<br>
A quantity of ozone close to 0.2% was progressively added to the pulp.<br>
After this treatment, the pulp was washed and its brightness measured by the usual<br>
standard methods.<br>
The results obtained are shown by the curve in Figure 1. They clearly show that the<br>
increase in the temperature of the Z stage improves the result of the bleaching, contrary to<br>
the teaching of the prior art, according to which, for example, the result at 80°C should be<br>
poorer than that at 20°C. However, it was observed that increasing the temperature above<br>
80°C was not advantageous.<br>
It is also interesting to observe in this example that the increase in efficiency of the ozone<br>
stage is not accompanied by a significant drop in the quality of the cellulose, of which the<br><br>
degree of polymerization (measured according to standard NF ISO 5351 after reduction<br>
with sodium borohydride) remains at very good levels. This is illustrated in Figure 2.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
A softwood wood kraft pulp is treated in a known manner, having a residual lignin<br>
content corresponding to a kappa number close to 27, with a DEDED bleaching sequence.<br>
The brightness obtained is 81.9% ISO.<br>
This pulp, after washing with water, had a pH close to 7. It was then subjected to an<br>
ozone treatment, with a consistency of 35%, in the same device as in example 1.<br>
A quantity of ozone of 0.19% was progressively added to the pulp. After this treatment,<br>
the pulp was washed and its brightness measured by the usual standard methods.<br>
The results of the bleaching by this final ozone stage are shown in Figure 3. They are<br>
similar to those obtained in example 1. This is particularly remarkable because the pH of<br>
the treatment is 7, and this, according to the teaching of the prior art, should lead to a<br>
rapid decomposition of the ozone and hence its loss of efficiency.<br>
In this example, it appears that the ozone treatment performance should be even better at a<br>
temperature above 80°C. However, the application of a temperature above 80°C may<br>
penalize the heat balance of the pulp plant.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
The same pulp as in the previous example was partially bleached by the DEDED<br>
sequence, in order to obtain a brightness of 81.9.<br>
Contrary to example 2, the pulp was not washed after the final D stage, but directly<br>
thickened to a consistency of 35%. Its pH was then close to 4.<br>
The ozone treatment according to the invention at a temperature of 80°C was applied to<br>
this pulp up to an ozone consumption of 0.19%.<br>
A brightness of 89% ISO was obtained, representing the same result as in example 2, in<br>
which washing had been carried out after the D stage.<br><br>
