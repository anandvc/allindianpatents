				<td>BELT TENSIONER AND METHOD FOR ASSEMBLY<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention  relates generally to tensioning devices, and more particularly to a belt tensioner and to a method for assembling a belt tensioner. Background Art<br>
The automotive industry utilizes belt tensioners to create a generally constant tension on a belt as it changes in length from normal wear, or from changes in span lengths due to span speed differences, wherein the belt is driven by a single drive pulley from the output shaft of the engine and wherein the belt rotates driven pulleys, each operating an automotive accessory. In known designs, the belt tensioner includes either a flat-wound spring or a helical spring, a spring casing, and an arm. One end of the spring is attached to the spring casing and the other end of the spring is attached to the arm. The arm pivots with respect to the spring casing when the spring exerts torque. The spring casing is attached to the engine, and an idler pulley is attached to the arm. The spring is preloaded by twisting the arm relative to the spring casing. The idler pulley on the arm is then placed against the belt. As the belt span lengthens, the torque from the preloaded spring continues to cause the idler pulley of the arm to apply pressure against the belt keeping the belt in tension.<br>
In one known arrangement patented as U.S. 5,772,549, a helical spring has a first end screwed into a first screw-like passage of the arm of the spring tensioner and has a second end screwed into a second screw-like passage of the spring casing. The spring is under tension and holds the parts together while permitting the arm to rotate relative to the spring casing. A cone-shaped bushing is disposed inside the spring between a portion of the arm and a portion of the spring casing to facilitate the rotation of the arm relative to the spring<br><br>
casing.   This arrangement is open to contamination and the spring configuration creates a moment loading.<br>
In one known example of a belt tensioner, a square-shaped hole in the idler pulley is engaged by a square head, often as would be common to a Vi" or %" leveraging or ratchet or similar wrench, to lift (preload) the arm. In a different known example, the idler pulley is mounted on a post of the arm, wherein the post has an annular rim which is deformed radially outward and over the bearing of the idler pulley creating a radial rivet joint to retain the idler pulley to the arm.<br>
In one known method, the arm is cast using a mold having first and second sections, and the spring case is cast using a mold having first and second segments. In this method, a path in the belt tensioner from the arm's seat for the bearing of the idler pulley to the engine mounting surface of the spring case crosses a line on the spring case corresponding to the parting line of the first and second segments.<br>
Still, engineers continue to seek improved belt tensioners. Disclosure of the invention<br>
A first expression of an embodiment of the invention is for a belt tensioner which includes a belt-tensioner arm, a belt-tensioner spring case, a belt-tensioner coil spring, and an arm plate. The arm is adapted to support an idler pulley and has a hook portion. The spring case is positioned in the arm and has a first spring seat. The spring is positioned in the spring case and has a longitudinal axis and longitudinally spaced apart first and second end portions. The arn plate is rotatable about the longitudinal axis and has a second spring seat. The spring is longitudinally compressed between the- arm plate and the spring case. The spring is in torsion, wherein the first end portion is rotationally seated against the first spring seat of the spring<br><br>
case, wherein the second end portion is rotationally seated against the second spring seat of the arm plate, and wherein the arm plate is rotationally disposed under the hook portion of the arm, thus securing the belt tensioner at least by compressive longitudinal spring force.<br>
A method of the invention is for assembling the belt tensioner described in the previous paragraph and includes several steps. One step includes placing the spring case in the arm. Another step includes placing the spring in the spring case. Another step includes using the arm plate to longitudinally compress the spring and rotating the arm plate until the spring is in torsion with the first end engaging the first spring seat, with the second end engaging the second spring seat, and with the arm plate longitudinally passing inward of the hook portion. Another step includes rotating the arm plate to release some of the torsion in the spring for the second end to rotationally urge the arm plate under the hook portion. Another step includes using the arm plate to release some of the longitudinal compression in the spring until the arm plate becomes trapped underneath the hook portion.<br>
A second expression of an embodiment of the invention is for a belt tensioner which includes a belt-tensioner arm, a belt-tensioner spring case, a belt-tensioner coil spring, an arm plate, and a pivot bushing. The arm is adapted to support an idler pulley. The spring case is positioned in the arm. The spring is positioned in the spring case. The spring is longitudinally compressed between the arm plate and the spring case. The pivot bushing circumferentially surrounds the spring, has a substantially outwardly or inwardly flared cone portion, and has a substantially constant diameter cylinder portion.<br>
Several benefits and advantages are derived from one or more of the expressions of an embodiment and method of the invention.   In one<br><br>
example, having a longitudinally compressed spring in torsion, a hool

Referring now to the drawings, Figures 1-3 illustrate an embodiment of the present invention. A first expression of the embodiment shown in Figures 1-3 is for a belt tensioner 10 including a belt-tensioner helical spring 12, a belt-tensioner arm 14, and a belt-tensioner spring case 16. The belt-tensioner helical spring 12 has inwardly projecting first and second end portions. Only the first end portion 18 of the helical spring 12 is shown in the figures with the understanding that, in one example, the second end portion is substantially identical to the first end portion 18. The belt-tensioner arm 14 is adapted to support an idler pulley 20 and has a first hook portion 22. The first end portion 18 of the helical spring 12 is retained by the first hool
In  one implementation of the first expression  of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the first 18 and second end portions of the<br><br>
helical spring 12 each project substantially radially inwardly. In one variation, the helical spring 12 is coiled about a longitudinal axis 23 defining an inner spring diameter, and the tip of the first end portion 18 of the helical spring 12 is disposed closer to the longitudinal axis 23 than to the inner diameter of the helical spring 12.<br>
In one example of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the helical spring 12 is in tension. It is noted that a controlled axial stretch of the helical spring 12 sustains force on, in one example, an alignment-controlling pivot bushing (to be described later) v\^ith the spring tension applying a continued force to the pivot bushing, for sustained damping and alignment control, even as the pivot bushing wears thinner throughout the duty cycle. In one application of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the helical spring 12 is rotationally pulled upon windup. This will cause the helical spring 12 to shorten upon windup and thus decrease the contact pressure and wear on, in one example, the pivot bushing. In one variation this is optimized for improved product function. In a different application (and mirrored coil and hook construction) of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the helical spring 12 is rotationally pushed upon windup. This will cause increased axial force to be placed upon, in one example, the pivot bushing enabling a level of positionally-asymmetric damping as can be appreciated by the artisan. In one variation of either or both applications, the helical spring 12 is a roundwire spring.<br>
In one enablement of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the belt tensioner 10 also includes a pivot bushing 24 disposed between, and in contact with, the arm 14 and the spring case 16 and circumferentially surrounding the helicarspring 12. In one variation, the helical spring 12 is in tension, the spring case 16 includes a protrusion 58 having a blocking surface, the arm 14 includes<br><br>
a locking portion 60 Inaving a blocl<ing surface at least one of the locking portion and protrusion has a leading inclined ramp wherein self unwinding helical spring disassembly belt tensioner is prevented by engagement blocking with this variation enables single motion self-locking method assembly as can be appreciated those skilled in art. example substantially consistent positioning from eliminates play its effect on torque variation.></ing>
In one modification, the pivot bushing 24 includes a substantially outwardly or inwardly flared cone portion 26 and a substantially constant diameter cylinder portion 28. In one configuration, the cone portion 26 is disposed closer to the first end portion 18 of the helical spring 12 than is the cylinder portion 28. In another configuration, not shown, the cone portion is disposed closer to the second end portion of the spring than is the cylinder portion. In one application, the cone portion 26 and the cylinder portion 28 are disposed radially between, and in contact with, the arm 14 and the spring case 16, the construction of which pemnits one to optimize for wear vs. load. The horizontal portion of cone 26 serves to minimize offset change with increased area, and the vertical portion of cone 26 works in conjunction with the cylinder portion 28 serving for alignment guidance as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
In one illustration, the belt tensioner 10 also includes an idler pulley 20 supported by the arm 14, wherein the pivot bushing 24 has a centroid (indicated by a dot 30 in Fig. 3), wherein the idler pulley 20 has a plane of belt loading (indicated by a dashed line 32), and wherein the centroid 30 is disposed proximate the plane of belt loading 32.   In one construction, the centroid 30 lies substantially in the plane<br><br>
of belt loading 32. Having the bushing centroid essentially in the plane of belt loading minimizes moment loading.<br>
In one arrangement, the spring case 16 has a case rim 34, and the cone portion 26 of the pivot bushing 24 is disposed proximate the case rim 34. Having the pivot bushing 24 be located in a most radially outward position takes full advantage of available annular wear surface.<br>
One procedure for assembling the belt tensioner 10 of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, wherein the helical spring 12 is rotationally pulled upon windup and the second hook portion of the spring case 16 is ramped, includes steps a) through c). Step a) includes disposing the first end portion 18 of the helical spring 12 in contact with the arm 14. Step b) includes disposing the second end portion of the helical spring 12 in contact with the spring case 16. Step c) includes relatively twisting the arm 14 and the spring case 16 trapping the first end portion 18 under the first hook portion 22 of the arm 14 and the second end portion under the second hook portion of the spring case 16 and pulling the helical spring 12 in tension. In one variation, counter rotation is prevented by a protrusion 58 on the spring case 16 and a locking portion 60 on the arm 14, the locking portion 60 having a leading inclined surface 62 and a blocking surface 64, wherein the protrusion 58 rides up and over the inclined surface 62 and down the blocking surface 64 of the locking portion 60 during step c), wherein counter rotation is prevented by counter rotational engagement of the protrusion 58 with the blocking surface 64 of the locking portion 60, and wherein disassembly is accomplished by pulling the spring case 16 and the arm 14 apart a distance to allow the protrusion 58 to clear the blocking surface 64 of the locking portion 60 whereupon counter rotation is enabled. In this variation, there is a self-locking together of the arm 14 and the spring case 16.   Self-locking<br><br>
tangs on the arm and spring case make for rapid, robust assembly. Ottier such variations providing seif-locl<ing having the protrusion on arm and be inclined are left to artisan. in a different variation fasteners used secure together spring case after first second end portions longitudinally trapped prevent counter rotation disassembly.></ing>
A second expression of the embodiment shown in Figures 1-3 is for a belt tensioner 10 including a belt-tensioner spring (e.g., helical spring 12), a belt-tensioner arm 14, a belt-tensioner spring case 16, and a pivot bushing 24. The belt-tensioner spring (e.g., helical spring 12) has first 18 and second end portions. The belt-tensioner arm 14 is in contact with the first end portion 18 of the spring (e.g., helical spring 12) and is adapted to support an idler pulley 20. The belt-tensioner spring case 16 is in contact with the second end portion of the spring (e.g., helical spring 12). The pivot bushing 24 circumferentially surrounds the spring (e.g., helical spring 12), has an outwardly-flared cone portion 26, and has a substantially constant diameter cylinder portion 28.<br>
In one example of the second expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the cone portion 26 is disposed closer to the first end portion 18 of the spring (e.g., helical spring 12) than is the cylinder portion 28. In another example, not shown, the cone portion is disposed closer to the second end portion of the spring than is the cylinder portion. In one construction, the spring is a helical spring 12. In another construction, not shown, the spring is a flat-wound spring. In one arrangement of the second expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the cone portion 26 is flared outwardly. In another arrangement, not shown, the cone portion is flared inwardly.<br>
In one implementation of the second expression of the<br><br>
embodiment of Figures 1-3, \he cone portion 26 and the cylinder portion 28 are disposed radially between, and in contact with, the arm 14 and the spring case 16. In one variation, the belt tensioner 10 also includes an idler pulley 20 supported by the arm 14. wherein the pivot bushing 24 has a centroid 30, wherein the idler pulley 20 has a plane of belt loading 32, and wherein the centroid 30 is disposed proximate the plane of belt loading 32. In one modification, the centroid 30 lies substantially in the plane of belt loading 32 to decrease moment loading.<br>
In one configuration of the second expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the spring case 16 has a case rim 34, and the cone portion 26 is disposed proximate the case rim 34. In one deployment of the second expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the belt tensioner 10 is substantially devoid of any gap between the spring case 16 and the pivot bushing 24 and between the arm 14 and the pivot bushing 24. This location of the pivot bushing 24 enables the pivot bushing 24 to act as a sealing device mitigating contaminant entry into the belt tensioner 10 as can be appreciated by those sl^illed in the art.<br>
The previously described examples, procedures, etc. of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3 are equally applicable to the second expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3.<br>
A third expression of the embodiment of Figures 1 -3 is for a belt tensioner 10 including an idler pulley 20 and a belt-tensioner arm 14. The idler pulley 20 has a bearing 36 including a mounting hole 38 having a longitudinal axis 40. The belt-tensioner arm 14 includes a post 42. The post 42 is disposed in the mounting hole 38 of the bearing 36 of the idler pulley 20 and extends longitudinally beyond the bearing 36. The post 42 has an annular rim 44 deformed radially outwardly and over the bearing 36 of the idler pulley 20 creating a<br><br>
radial rivet joint. Tlie post 42 has a non-circular hole portion 46 disposed longitudinally below the annular rim 44 and adapted for engagement by a belt-tensioner arm-lifting tool (not shown). In one arrangement, the non-circular hole portion 46 is a star-shaped orifice (such as identified in ISO standard 10664 for hexalobular internal driving features), and the non-circular head is a star-shaped head (such as a TORX® head). In other arrangements, not shown, the non-circular hole portion has a multi-lobed shape, a hex-shape, or a slot shape, in one implementation, the belt-tensioner arm-lifting tool is a wrench such as a ratchet or similar wrench. The annular rim 44 of the post 42 allows assembly of the idler pulley 20 to the post by a radial rivet joint (by simply deforming the annular rim 44 over the bearing 36 of the idler pulley 20) avoiding use of a bolt. The non-circular hole portion 46 (e.g., star-shaped orifice) of the post 42 below the annular rim 44 allows lifting (i.e., rotating) the arm 14 of an assembled belt tensioner 10 (when, for example, the spring case 16 is mounted to an automotive engine) with, for example, a ratchet or similar wrench equipped with a TORX® or hex head. Thus, the post 42 saves space in providing both the lift-lug geometry to lift the arm 14 and a radial rivet joint to secure the bearing 36 of the idler pulley 20.<br>
The previously described examples, procedures, etc. of the first and/or second expressions of the embodiment of Figures 1-3 are equally applicable to the third expression of the embodiment of Figures 1-3.<br>
A method of the invention is for manufacturing an arm 14 and a spring case 16 of a belt tensioner 10. The arm 14 has a bearing seat 48 adapted to support a bearing 36 of an idler pulley 20 and has an arm-to-bushing mounting surface 50 adapted to support a pivot-bushing 24. The spring case 16 includes an ear (the protruding portion of the spring case 16 having the mounting holes 56) having a belt-<br><br>
tensioner mounting surface (the longitudinally facing surface of the ear seen in Figure 1). The method includes several steps. One step includes obtaining a belt-tensioner-arm casting mold (not shown) including a first section and a second section, wherein the first section has a first surface portion for casting the bearing seat 48 and a second surface portion for casting the arm-to-bushing mounting surface 50. Another step includes disposing the first and second sections together along a parting line. Another step includes casting the arm 14 using the disposed first and second sections. Another step includes obtaining a belt-tensioner-spring-case casting mold (not shown) including a first segment and a second segment, wherein the first segment includes a surface portion for casting the belt-tensioner mounting surface of the ear. Another step Includes disposing the first and second sections together along a parting line. Another step includes casting the spring case 16 using the disposed first and second segments, wherein a path in the belt tensioner 10 from the bearing seat 48 to the belt-tensioner mounting surface does not cross a line on the arm 14 corresponding to the parting line of the first and second sections and does not cross a line on the spring case 16 corresponding to the parting line of the first and second segments.<br>
In one implementation of the method, the arm-casting step uses only the disposed first and second sections (i.e., there are no other mold sections). In the same or a different implementation, the spring-case-casting step uses only the disposed first and second segments (i.e., there are no other mold segments). In the same or a different implementation, the belt-tensioner mounting surface is disposable in contact with an engine.<br>
It is noted that having a path in the belt tensioner from the bearing seat 48 to the belt-tensioner mounting surface which does not cross a line on the arm 14 corresponding to the parting line of the first<br><br>
and second sections and which does not cross a line on the spring case 16 corresponding to the parting line of the first and second segments minimizes the casting effect on offset and alignment.<br>
In one variation, whether or not a parting line is crossed, having the belt-tensioner mounting surface of the ear of the spring case 16 be on the same segment of the belt-tensioner-spring-case casting moid as the surface of the spring case 16 that touches the pivot bushing 24 reduces the bending moment placed upon the pivot bushing 24 alleviating pinch-related wear and puts all in line with the hub load which minimizes stack-up of the arm/puller assembly offset.<br>
In one design of any one or more or ail of the expressions of the embodiment of Figures 1-3, the arm 10 includes a first end cap 52, and the spring case 16 includes a second end cap 54 and includes mounting holes 56 for mounting to, in one example, an automotive or heavy duty combustion engine. Non-automotive applications of the belt tensioner 10 are left to the artisan.<br>
Several benefits and advantages are derived from one or more of the expressions of an embodiment and method of Figures 1-3. Having inwardly projecting first and second end portions of a belt-tensioner helical spring avoids out-of-plane loads or couples from assembly forces. A pivot bushing with a substantially outwardly or inwardly flared cone portion and a substantially constant diameter cylinder portion delivers improved offset control (via the cone portion) and alignment guidance (via the cylinder portion). Having a belt-tensioner arm including a post having an annular rim and having a non-circular hole portion below the annular rim enables a radial rivet joint to secure an idler pulley to the post and enables access to the non-circular hole portion of the post by a belt-tensioner amn-lifting tool to lift the arm for placing it against a belt creating tension in the belt. In one example, having the pivot bushing centroid essentially in the plane of<br><br>
belt loading minimizes moment loading upon the bushing itself. In the same or a different example, locking hooks on the ami and spring case make for rapid, robust assembly with solid engagement that minimizes residual torque creep from tang movement. Having a path in the belt tensioner from the bearing seat to the belt-tensioner mounting surface which does not cross a line on the arm con-esponding to the parting line of the first and second sections and which does not cross a line on the spring case corresponding to the parting line of the first and second segments minimizes the casting effect on offset and alignment as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
Referring again to the drawings, Figures 4-9 illustrate a second embodiment of the present invention. A first expression of the embodiment shown in Figures 4-9 is for a belt tensioner 110 which includes a belt-tensioner arm 112, a belt-tensioner spring case 114, a belt-tensioner coil spring 116, and an arm plate 118. The arm 112 is adapted to support an idler pulley 120 and has a hook portion 122. The spring case 114 is disposed in the arm 112 and has a first spring seat 124. The spring 116 is disposed in the spring case 114 and has a longitudinal axis 126 and longitudinally spaced apart first and second end portions 128 and 130. The arm plate 118 is rotatable about the longitudinal axis 126 and has a second spring seat 132. The spring 116 is longitudinally compressed between the arm plate 118 and the spring case 114. The spring 116 is in torsion wherein the first end portion 128 is rotationally seated against the first spring seat 124 of the spring case 114, wherein the second end portion 130 is rotationally seated against the second spring seat 132 of the ami plate 118, and wherein the arm plate 118 (meaning at least a portion of the-arm plate 118 such as the second spring seat 132 of the arm plate 118) is rotationally disposed under the hook portion 122 of the arm 112.<br>
In   one   enablement   of   the   first   expression   of   the<br><br>
embodiment of Figures 4-9, the second end portion 130 is a substantiaily-radially-outwardly-extending second end portion. In one variation, the spring case 114 includes a radially outer annular wall 134 having a wall portion 136 including a radially inward protrusion 138 which defines the first spring seat 124. In one modification, the ann plate 118 includes an arm-plate portion 140 first extending radially outwardly, then extending in a circumferential or tangential direction, and then extending longitudinally, wherein the ann-plate portion 140 defines the second spring seat 132. In one example, the wall portion 136 includes an opposing radially inward recess 142 having circumferentially spaced apart recess ends 144, and the spring case 114 has a tab 146 disposed in the radially inward recess 142 to limit spring rotation about the longitudinal axis 126. It is noted that, in this example, limited spring rotation is achieved with a protrusion from the main body of the tensioner which enables the tensioner to fit in a tighter FEAD (front end accessory drive) package.<br>
In one configuration of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 4-9, the tapered arm 112 and spring case 114 joint profile seen in Figure 7 prevents the longitudinally compressed spring 116 from disassembling the belt tensioner 110 in a longitudinally downward direction, while the second spring seat 132 of the arm plate 118 being disposed underneath the hook portion 122 of the arm 112 prevents the longitudinally compressed spring 116 from disassembling the belt tensioner 110 in a longitudinally upward direction.<br>
In one arrangement of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 4-9, the belt tensioner 110 also includes a pivot bushing 148 disposed between, and in contact with, the arm 112 and the spring case 114 and circumferentially surrounding the spring 116. In one variation the pivot bushing 148 includes a substantially outwardly or inwardly flared cone portion  150 and a substantially<br><br>
constant diameter cylinder portion 152. In one nnodification, the cone portion 150 and the cylinder portion 152 are disposed radially between, and in contact with, the arm 112 and the spring case 114. In one example, the belt tensioner 110 also includes an idler pulley 120 supported by the arm 112, wherein the pivot bushing 148 has a centroid 154, wherein the idler pulley 120 has a plane of belt loading 156, and wherein the centroid 154 is disposed proximate the plane of belt loading 156. In one design, the centroid 154 lies substantially in the plane of belt loading 156. In one construction, the spring case 114 has a case rim 158, and the cone portion 150 is disposed proximate the case rim 158. In one utilization, the pivot bushing 148 is disposed radially outermost with significant axial length with the radially outer wall 134 of the spring case 114 acting as the pivot-bushing surface interface. This maximizes the surface and wear area of the combination alignment/offset/damping control pivot bushing 148. The pivot bushing 148 is very well contained and sealed. As the pivot bushing 148 wears, the spring force sustains near constant load aiding in offset and parallelism control and sustained damping over time, as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
In one employment of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 4-9, the spring 116 includes a conical coil spring (providing necessary torque in a specialized package size), and a first distance from the longitudinal axis 126 to the spring 116 proximate the second end portion 130 is greater than a second distance from the longitudinal axis 126 to the spring 116 proximate the first end portion 128. In the same or a different employment, the belt tensioner 110 also includes a mounting bolt 160 for mounting the belt tensioner 110, wherein the arm plate 118 and the spring case 114 each have a central hole 162, and wherein when the belt tensioner 110 is mounted, the mounting bolt 160 passes through each central hole 162<br><br>
and contacts only the spring case 114. In one variation, the spring case 114 longitudinally extends beyond the arm 112, and the spring case 114 has a longitudinally projecting alignnnent mounting pin 164 radially spaced apart from the central hole 162 of the spring case 114. In one construction, the spring 116 is a roundwire spring. In a different employment, not shown, the spring is a helical spring wherein the distance from the longitudinal axis to the spring is substantially constant along the longitudinal length of the spring. An optional 0-ring seal 166 is shown in Figures 4 and 7. In one implementation, the conical spring and tapered tensioner body act to naturally drain away contaminants.<br>
A method for assembling the belt tensioner 110 described in the fifth previous paragraph includes steps a) through e). Step a) includes disposing the spring case 114 in the arm 112. Step b) includes disposing the spring 116 in the spring case 114. Step c) includes using the ami plate 118 to longitudinally compress the spring 116 and rotating the arm plate 118 until the spring 116 is in torsion with the first end portion 128 engaging the first spring seat 124, with the second end portion 130 engaging the second spring seat 132, and with the arm plate 118 (meaning at least a portion of the arm plate 118 such as the second spring seat 132 of the arm plate 118) longitudinally passing inward of the hook portion 122. Step d) includes rotating the arm plate 118 to release some of the torsion in the spring 116 for the second end portion 130 to rotationally urge the arm plate 118 (meaning at least a portion of the arm plate 118) under the hooi
in   one   application   of   the   first   expression   of   the<br><br>
embodiment of Figures 4-9, when the belt tensioner 110 is assembled, the spring 116 is in torsional compression (wind up) and is in longitudinal compression. In a different application of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 4-9 (with the spring 116 wound in the opposite direction from that shown in Figure 4), when the belt tensioner 110 is assembled, the spring is in torsional expansion (unwinding) and is in longitudinal compression.<br>
In one extension, the method of the second previous paragraph is also for disassembling the assembled belt tensioner 110 and further includes steps f) through j). Step f) includes using the arm plate 118 to increase the longitudinal compression in the spring 116. Step g) includes rotating the arm plate 118 to increase the torsion in the spring 116 until the arm plate 118 rotationally clears the hook portion 122. Step h) includes using the arm plate 118 to retease all of the longitudinal compression and torsion in the spring 116. Step i) includes removing the spring 116 from the spring case 114. Step j) includes removing the spring case 114 from the arm 112.<br>
In another extension, the method of the third previous paragraph is also for mounting the assembled belt tensioner 110, wherein the arm plate 118 and the spring case 114 each have a central hole 162, and further includes steps f) through i). Step f) includes obtaining a threaded mounting bolt 160. Step g) includes disposing the spring case 114 of the assembled belt tensioner 110 against an engine (not shown) having a threaded mounting hole (not shown) with the central hole 162 of the spring case 114 substantially coaxially aligned with the mounting hole of the engine. Step h) includes passing the mounting bolt 160 through the central holes 162 of the arm* plate 118 and the spring case 114. Step i) includes threadably engaging the mounting bolt 160 with the mounting hole.<br>
A second expression of the embodiment of Figures 4-9 is<br><br>
for a belt tensioner 110 which includes a belt-tensioner arm 112, a belt-tensioner spring case 114, a belt-tensioner coil spring 116, an arm plate 118, and a pivot bushing 148. The arm 112 is adapted to support an idler pulley 120. The spring case 114 is disposed in the arm 112. The spring 116 is disposed in the spring case 114. The spring 116 is longitudinally compressed between the arm plate 118 and the spring case 114. The pivot bushing 148 circumferentially surrounds the spring 116, has a substantially outwardly or inwardly flared cone portion 150, and has a substantially constant diameter cylinder portion 152.<br>
The enablements, arrangements, employment, etc. of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 4-9 are equally applicable to the second expression of the embodiment of Figures 4-9.<br>
Referring once more to the drawings, Figure 10 illustrates an alternate second embodiment of the present invention. A first expression of the embodiment shown in Figure 10 is identical to the first expression of the embodiment shown in Figures 4-9 and described in the eleventh previous paragraph, and a method for assembling the belt tensioner 210 shown in Figure 10 is identical to the method for assembling the belt tensioner 110 shown in Figures 4-9 and described in the sixth previous paragraph. In a first expression of the embodiment shown in Figure 10, the arm plate 218 (meaning at least a portion of the arm plate 218 such as a portion of the outer periphery 268 of the arm plate 218) is rotationally disposed under the hook portion 222 of the arm 212.<br>
In one enablement of the embodiment of Figure 10, the arm plate 218 has an outer periphery 268 including a peripheral notch 270 (three notches are shown in Figure 10). In the same or a different enablement, the hook portion 222 (with one hook portion 222 per notch 270) has a first circumferential extent, the peripheral notch 270 has a<br><br>
second circumferential extent, and the second circumferential extent is greater than the first circumferential extent. In the same or a different enablement, the second spring seat 232 of the arm plate 218 is disposed radially inwardly of the outer periphery 268 of the arm plate 218.<br>
The enablements, arrangements, employment, etc. of the first expression of the embodiment of Figures 4-9 are equally applicable to the first expression of the embodiment of Figure 10 taking into account the differences in the arm plates 218 and 118, the second end portions 230 and 130 of the springs 216 and 116, and the hool
Several benefits and advantages are derived from one or more of the expressions of an embodiment and method of Figures 4-9. In one example, having a longitudinally and torsionally compressed spring, a hook portion of the arm, a first spring seat of the spring case, and a second spring seat of an arm plate allows assembly and disassembly of a belt tensioner without the use of assembly fasteners. In the same or a different example, having a pivot bushing with a substantially outwardly or inwardly flared cone portion and a substantially constant diameter cylinder portion delivers improved offset and damping control (via the cone portion) and alignment guidance (via the cylinder portion), as can be appreciated by those skilled in the art.<br>
The foregoing description of several expressions of embodiments and methods of the invention has been presented for purposes of illustration. It is not intended to be exhaustive or to limit the invention to the precise forms and steps disclosed, and obviously many modifications and variations are possible in light of the above<br><br>
teaching.   It is intended that the scope of the invention be defined by the claims appended hereto.<br><br><br>
