				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to an improved rickshaw.<br>
BACKGROUND OF INVENTION<br>
Cycle rickshaws presently known in the art comprise of a cycle with a front and two rear wheels. The rickshaw further comprises a chain sprocket system adapted to be driven manually through a pair of pedals by a driver. Several distinct disadvantages are associated with such a known rickshaw. One such disadvantage is that the driver has to apply considerable force and effort to move the rickshaw on the ascending ground. Yet another disadvantage is that the load or number of passengers carried by the rickshaw is limited.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
An object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a cycle rickshaw.<br>
Another object of this invention is to propose an improved construction of a cycle rickshaw having automotive means for imparting a drive thereto.<br><br>
Further objects of this invention will be more apparent from the ensuing description.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF INVENTION<br>
According to this invention there is provided an improved cycle rickshaw comprising of:<br>
a)	main frame having a handle at the front thereof and extending into a<br>
fork for rotatably supporting a front wheel, said handle having a brake<br>
lever for actuating the brakes of said rickshaw.<br>
b)	a driver seat mounted on said frame.<br>
c)	a drive sprocket having a pair pedals rotatably held to said frame and<br>
comprising a first drive means as herein described.<br>
d)	a rear frame held to said main frame and having a platform for<br>
supporting passenger seats,<br>
characterized in that is,<br>
e)	said rear frame supports, a second drive means having a motor, a d.c.<br>
power source adapted to be connected to said motor.<br>
f)	a rear axle of cycle rickshaw has the pair of rear wheels to impart a<br>
drive thereto during first or second drive means as herein described.<br><br>
In  accordance with this invention the  cycle rickshaw  comprises  a front, wheel and a  pair  of  rear wheels,,   a  sprocket  and  chain  system  for  manually driving said pair of rear wheels by a driver through   a pair  of pedals.  Such a first drive means is  known  in the art and does not form a concept of this invention.<br>
Spepcificailyâ€ž the present invention consists in  second drive means comprises a motor connected to  a source  such as storage batteries.  Means  are  provided for drivinq the rear wheels through said first or second drive means..  Alternatively, the second drive means  may compliment, the  first.  drive  means.<br>
Further   objects  and  advantages  of   this invention  will  foe  more  apparent  from  the   ensuing description   when   read  in   conjunction   with   the accompanying drawings, and wherein:<br>
Fig..  .1      shows  the  cyclerickshaw  of  the   presnet invention;<br>
Fig. 2       shows the end of view of the cyclerickshaw; and<br>
Fig.  3       shows  the  block  diagram  used  in   the c y c 1 e r ii c k s h aw o f f i g . 1.<br>
Referring  to  fig. is the cycle  rickshaw  1 comprises  a  main frame 7, the front fork  la  of  main<br><br>
frame 7 rotatably supporting a front wheel 2 in a manner known  in the art.  Frame I has a front, handle 3 with  a<br>
brake  lever 4 for actuation of the brakes.   Not  known from  the prior art is the provision of a motor  control<br>
switch 5,  provided in front handle 3&gt; for actuation of  a motor,  and more specifically a d.c,, motor 6  and  in  a<br>
manner  subsequently  described herein.   Main  frame  7 supports  a   driver  seat 8 so as to seal a  driver  to<br>
actuate the pedals 9 provided with a drive sprocket  10, and  which  constitutes the first  drive  means.   Drive<br>
sprocket 10 through a chain 1.2.<br>
Normally, sprocket 11 is mounted on the  rear<br>
axle of the cycle having the pair of rear wheels 20  and im pa r t i n g a d rive t her eto.<br>
In  distinction., sprocket 11 imparts a  drive-to a reduction assembly 13.  For this purpose, the cycle rickshaw  1  comprises said motor 6 having a  pulley  14<br>
mounted  on its output shaft, said pulley having a  beat 15   for driving a driven pulley 16.  Driven  pulley  16<br>
drives sprockeft 17 mounted on rear axle 13.  Sprocket 17 is  mounted  on  axle 18 in order  to  provide  a  drive<br>
thereto  from motor 6, said motor obtaining  power  from a  set of  batteries 19 upon ac.tuat.iori of motor  control<br>
switch  5.  Further, a sprocket 19  is mounted oil  axle<br><br>
18.   Sprocket  19  obtaining  a  drive  from   manually<br>
operated pedals 9,, Axle .18 imparts a movement, to rear wheels 20 by rec.ei.vinq power wheels 20 bv receiving<br>
power from wheels 20 by receiving power from either motor 6 or from pedals 9. A rear or passenger seat.<br>
frame 27 is held to or extends from main frame 1, said frame 2.7 supporting on axle 18 through shock<br>
absorbers 21.<br>
Break lever 4 is adapted to break drum 22	so<br>
as  to  cause  a  breaking action  on  rear  wheels	20.<br>
Further,  a  passenger seat assembly 23  is  mounted	on<br>
frame 27, said seat having a hood 24.<br>
The  rickshaw  1  of  the  present  invention further  comprises a control card 25 which controls  the flow of current from batteries 26 intro motor 6.<br>
Reference   is  now  made  to   fig. 3   which illustrates  the  block diagram of control  card( 25  to comprise  a  chopper  circuit 5.1 connected  to  a  power<br><br>
source through a diode 52. The power source is also connected to an enable circuit 53 having a start switch<br>
