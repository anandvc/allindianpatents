Modular Fieldbus Segment Protector<br>
This invention relates to a Modular Fieldbus Segment Protector for use in<br>
connecting electrical devices to a trunk connection bus.<br>
Known Fieldbus segment protection generally comprises a block containing a<br>
plethora of spur outlets. This is not an economic or versatile configuration as many<br>
spur outlets are often left unused.<br>
It is possible to use T couplers but these increase the footprint size, increase<br>
the number of terminal connections and generally increases the cost of manufacture<br>
and use.<br>
In addition, the known types of block couplers do not allow the live<br>
replacement of any faulty spur autonomous components. In order to remove a spur<br>
module the trunk connection must be broken.<br>
The present invention is intended to overcome some of the above problems.<br>
Therefore, according to a first aspect of the present invention a modular<br>
Fieldbus segment protector comprises a support means provided with trunk<br>
connection means, a trunk connection bus and a plurality of spur outlets, in which<br>
autonomous fault isolation means are removably mounted on the support means<br>
between the trunk connection bus and any one or more of the plurality of spur<br>
outlets.<br>
Therefore, the invention provides a modular system in which self-contained<br>
fault isolation means can be utilised where and when necessary by only being<br>
applied to particular spur outlets. As the fault isolation means are removable from<br>
the support means, they can also be moved about thereon and applied to the spur<br>
outlets as desired.<br><br>
WO 2007/010289	PCT/GB2006/002758<br>
-2-<br>
In addition, with this arrangement each spur outlet is provided with its own<br>
autonomous fault isolation means.<br>
It will be appreciated that the invention includes a modular Fieldbus segment<br>
protector in which removal of a fault isolation means from between the trunk<br>
connection bus and a spur outlet will isolate the spur outlet, and any spur connected<br>
thereto, from the trunk connection bus.<br>
However, in a preferred embodiment of the invention secondary switch means<br>
can be provided between the trunk connection bus and one or more of the plurality of<br>
spur outlets. Each secondary switch means can be adapted to connect its spur outlet<br>
to the trunk connection bus when a fault isolation means is not mounted between<br>
the trunk connection bus and that spur outlet<br>
The secondary switch means can be adapted to automatically connect its spur<br>
outlet to the trunk connection bus when a fault isolation means is removed from<br>
between them, and to automatically break that connection when a fault isolation<br>
means is returned to between them.<br>
With this arrangement the removal of one of the fault isolation means does<br>
not isolate the spur outlet, and therefore any spur connected thereto. As such a faulty<br>
fault isolation means can be removed and replaced without isolating a spur and<br>
interrupting electrical supply to a device connected thereto.<br>
In one arrangement the secondary switch means can be provided with<br>
deactivation means, the operation of which prevents the secondary switch means<br>
connecting its spur outlet to the trunk connection bus when a fault isolation means is<br>
not mounted between them. The deactivation means can be manual or otherwise.<br>
Thus, if it is desired to isolate a particular spur outlet, and a spur mounted<br>
thereon, then the deactivation means can be operated and the fault isolation means<br><br>
WO 2007/010289	PCT/GB2006/002758<br>
-3-<br>
can be removed from between the spur outlet and the trunk connection bus. Also, if a<br>
fault isolation means is not present, and the secondary switch means is connecting<br>
the spur outlet to the trunk connection bus, then the deactivation means can be<br>
operated at any time to isolate the spur.<br>
Preferably each one of the plurality of spur outlets is provided with a<br>
secondary switch means of any of the kinds described above.<br>
The fault isolation means can comprise an electrical circuit adapted to<br>
transition to high impedance if a short circuit or low resistance fault occurs at a spur.<br>
There are several known types of electrical circuit which can be used.<br>
The trunk connection means can be any known connector, such that the<br>
modular Fieldbus segment protector could be retrofit to an existing Fieldbus trunk.<br>
Alternatively, the trunk connection bus can be connected to a trunk by being<br>
integrally formed thereon. Such an arrangement would be suitable if the modular<br>
Fieldbus segment protector of the invention were integrated into a new Fieldbus<br>
trunk system.<br>
Likewise, the spur outlets can be any know connectors, such that the modular<br>
Fieldbus segment protector can be retrofit to an existing Fieldbus trunk, and such<br>
that different spurs can be connected and disconnected thereto as desired in use.<br>
Alternatively, spurs can be integrally formed onto the support means, and as such the<br>
spur connectors can comprise the connection points between the spurs and the<br>
support means. Such an arrangement would be suitable if the modular Fieldbus<br>
segment protector of the invention were integrated into a Fieldbus trunk system in<br>
which the spurs were not disconnectable.<br>
The support means can comprise a backplane carrying the trunk connection<br>
bus, the removable fault isolation means and the plurality of spur outlets.<br><br>
WO 2007/010289	PCT/GB2006/002758<br>
-4-<br>
However in a more advantageous construction of the invention, the support<br>
means can comprise a plurality of separate backplanes each carrying a trunk<br>
connection bus and a spur outlet. One or more of the backplanes can also carry a<br>
fault isolation means, according to the invention.<br>
With this construction the trunk connection means of the invention can<br>
comprise connectors which can connect the backplanes to a trunk. In addition, the<br>
connectors can also be adapted to connect one backplane to another, so any<br>
number of backplanes can be daisy-chained together between connections to the<br>
trunk. Such connectors might be so-called D connectors. With this arrangement a<br>
modular trunk connection bus runs through all the backplanes, and a separate spur<br>
outlet is provided at each backplane.<br>
This arrangement allows any number of backplanes to be incorporated into a<br>
Fieldbus system as required. This modular system eliminates the occurrence of<br>
redundant spur outlets.<br>
The support means of the invention can also be adapted to support other<br>
devices. For example, any device could be mounted between the trunk connection<br>
means and the trunk connection bus to serve any particular purpose. Such a device<br>
might be a simple direct spur connection module without any fault isolation features,<br>
or it could be a passive device with a PCB connection. Other types of additional<br>
circuitry could also be included here, for example voltage limiting components or<br>
modules, and/or additional spur protection electronics.<br>
As stated above, the modular Fieldbus segment protector of the invention<br>
could be fully integrated into a Fieldbus system.<br>
Therefore, according to a second aspect of the present invention a Fieldbus<br>
system is provided with a modular Fieldbus segment protector comprising a support<br>
means provided with trunk connection means, a trunk connection bus and a plurality<br><br>
WO 2007/010289	PCT/GB2006/002758<br>
-5-<br>
of spur outlets, in which autonomous fault isolation means are removably mounted<br>
on the support means between the trunk connection bus and any one or more of the<br>
plurality of spur outlets.<br>
Two embodiments of the invention will now be described by way of example<br>
and with reference to the accompanying drawings, in which:<br>
Figure 1 is a diagrammatic view of a first modular Fieldbus segment protector<br>
according to the present invention; and,<br>
Figure 2 is a diagrammatic view of a second modular Fieldbus segment<br>
protector according to the present invention.<br>
(In the following examples terminators are not included, but it will be<br>
appreciated that they may be inserted at any point in the system.)<br>
As shown in Figure 1 a modular Fieldbus segment protector comprises a<br>
support means, in the form of backplane 1, provided with trunk connection means, a<br>
trunk connection bus 6 and a plurality of spur outlets. (In the example shown the<br>
backplane 1 is simply mounted on a trunk 2, and as such the "trunk connection<br>
means" in this case comprises the incoming and outgoing trunk wires. In addition,<br>
the spurs, only one of which 7 is shown, are simply connected to the backplane 1,<br>
and as such the "spur outlets" of the invention comprise those connection points.)<br>
Autonomous fault isolation means, in the form of spur isolators 3,3a, and 3b to 3n<br>
are removably mounted on the support means (1) between the trunk connection bus<br>
6 and any one or more of the plurality of spur outlets, as is illustrated in Figure 1.<br>
Secondary switch means in the form of shunt switches, only one of which 4 is<br>
visible, are provided between the trunk connection bus 6 and the spurs 7. The shunt<br>
switches 4 automatically connect the spurs 7 to the trunk connection bus 6 when a<br>
spur isolator 3 is removed from between them. This connection is broken when a<br><br>
WO 2007/010289	PCT/GB2006/002758<br>
-6-<br>
spur isolator 3 is returned. The means by which the shunt switches 4 automatically<br>
connect the spurs 7 to, and disconnect the spurs 7 from, the trunk connection bus 6<br>
can be any known trip devices.<br>
The spur isolators 3, 3a and 3b to 3n comprise electrical circuits adapted to<br>
transition to high impedance if a short circuit or low resistance fault occurs at a spur<br>
7. Such technology is well known and is not further described here.<br>
In use the spur isolators 3, 3a and 3b to 3b connect the spurs 7 to the trunk<br>
connection bus 6, so that devices (not shown) connected to the spurs 7 are provided<br>
with electrical power and can operate.<br>
The spur isolators 3, 3a and 3b to 3n operate to protect the spur 7 and the<br>
trunk 2 from any short circuits or breaks which may occur in the system. As the spur<br>
isolators 3, 3a and 3b to 3n are autonomous they can Isolate separate parts of the<br>
system without affecting others.<br>
As the spur isolators 3, 3a and 3b to 3n are removable from the backplane 1<br>
they can be applied to connect particular spurs 7 to the trunk connection bus 6 as<br>
required. For example where a spur 7 is not being used, a spur isolator 3, 3a and 3b<br>
to 3n is not required and can be utilised elsewhere. This flexibility allows for a<br>
targeted, and therefore more economic, use of resources.<br>
If a spur isolator 3, 3a and 3b to 3n is removed from between the trunk<br>
connection bus 6 and a particular spur 7, as is shown in Figure 1, then the shunt<br>
switch 4 automatically connects the spur 7 directly to the trunk connection bus 6. As<br>
such, a spur isolator 3, 3a and 3b to 3n can be removed from the backplane 1 for<br>
whatever reason, and there will be no interruption in electrical supply to the spur 7,<br>
and any device connected thereto. This allows for the live removal and replacement<br>
of spur isolators 3, 3a and 3b to 3n in use. In particular it prevents devices from<br>
being disconnected by accident.<br><br>
WO 2007/010289	PCT/GB2006/002758<br>
-7-<br>
Figure 2 shows a variation of the invention in which the support means<br>
comprises a plurality of separate backplanes 1a and 1b to 1n, each carrying a single<br>
trunk connection bus and a spur outlet. In Figure 2 each backplane 1a and 1b to 1n<br>
also carries a spur isolator, and in each case shunt switches as described above are<br>
provided.<br>
Each of the backplanes la and 1b to 1n is provided with the female part of a<br>
D connector at one side, and the male part of a D connector at the opposite side (not<br>
shown). As such, each backplane 1a and 1b to 1n can be connected to the trunk,<br>
either at an inlet or an outlet, and the backplanes 1a and 1b to 1n can be connected<br>
together. Therefore, any number of backplanes can be daisy-chained together<br>
between connections to the trunk. In Figure 2 backplanes la and lb are connected<br>
together in such a chain, between connections to the trunk. It will be appreciated that<br>
any number of such backplanes can be connected together in this way, and the<br>
hashed outline of 1n in Figure 2 is intended to indicate this capability.<br>
With this arrangement a modular trunk connection bus 6 runs through these<br>
backplanes 1a and 1b to 1n, and a separate spur outlet is provided at each<br>
backplane 1a and 1b to 1n. It will be appreciated that this arrangement allows any<br>
number of backplanes to be incorporated into a Fieldbus system as required, and<br>
such a modular system eliminates the occurrence of redundant spur outlets.<br>
As such the modular Fieldbus segment protector shown in Figure 2 has two<br>
levels of modular flexibility. The spur isolators can be removed from the backplanes<br>
1a and 1b to 1n, and moved between them if desired, and in addition, the number of<br>
actual spur outlets provided can be adjusted by removing or adding backplanes.<br>
The present invention also includes a Fieldbus system provided with a<br>
modular Fieldbus segment protector as described above. This invention is supported<br>
by Figure 1, in which the modular Fieldbus segment protector is integrally mounted<br>
on a Fieldbus trunk, and the spurs are integrally mounted on the modular Fieldbus<br><br>
WO 2007/010289	PCT/GB2006/002758<br>
-8-<br>
segment protector. Therefore a Fieldbus system according to the second aspect of<br>
the present invention is supported by the Figures.<br>
The present invention can be altered without departing from the scope of<br>
Claim 1. In particular, in an alternative embodiment (not shown), the modular<br>
Fieldbus segment protector is provided with actual trunk connectors, and actual spur<br>
connectors, so the modular Fieldbus segment protector is a stand-alone device which<br>
can be readily plugged into an existing Fieldbus system.<br>
In another alternative embodiment (not shown) the modular Fieldbus segment<br>
protector is not provided with any secondary switch means, such that removal of a<br>
fault isolation means from between the trunk connection bus and a spur outlet<br>
isolates that spur outlet. Such a version may be preferred in some cases.<br>
In another alternative arrangement (not shown) the secondary switch means<br>
are provided with deactivation means, the operation of which prevents the secondary<br>
switch means connecting the spur outlets to the trunk connection bus when a fault<br>
isolation means is not mounted between them. Such a version provides greater<br>
flexibility of use.<br>
In a further alternative embodiments (not shown) the backplanes support<br>
other devices, including a simple direct spur connection module without any fault<br>
isolation features, and/or a passive device with a PCB connection and / or voltage<br>
limiting components or modules and/or additional spur protection electronics.<br>
Thus, Fieldbus segment protection is provided in a modular and flexible<br>
fashion, so the required devices can be utilized more effectively. In addition, the<br>
invention provides for removal of Fieldbus segment protection from individual spurs<br>
without any interruption in electrical supply. Further, each spur is provided with its<br>
own autonomous protection which prevents other parts of the system from being<br>
affected by faults.<br><br>
