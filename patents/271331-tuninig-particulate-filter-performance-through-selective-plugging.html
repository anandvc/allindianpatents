TUNING PARTICULATE FILTER PERFORMANCE THROUGH SELECTIVE<br>
PLUGGING AND USE OF MULTIPLE PARTICULATE FILTERS TO REDUCE<br>
EMISSIONS AND IMPROVE THERMAL ROBUSTNESS<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0001]	The invention relates to exhaust aftertreatment filters for<br>
filtering exhaust from internal combustion engines, including diesel engines.<br>
[0002]	Exhaust aftertreatment filters for diesel engines are known in the<br>
prior art. The filter traps contaminant particulate present in exhaust, and in order to<br>
remove the trapped particulate, the filter is heated to burn-off the trapped contaminant<br>
particulate as gas. Accordingly, the filter is regenerable and is composed of material<br>
on which trapped contaminant particulate from the engine exhaust is removed by<br>
addition of heat. Commonly used particulate filter materials include cordierite,<br>
silicon carbide, mullite, or aluminum titanate, which are manufactured as filter<br>
elements to capture the soot and other particulate generated by the engine.<br>
[0003]	Diesel particulate filters (DPF) are subject to high temperatures<br>
during use. The design of the DPF consists of a honeycomb structure with opposing<br>
channels blocked to force exhaust gases to flow through the porous channel walls,<br>
while trapping soot. The soot (composed primarily of carbon) accumulates in the<br>
DPF and must be removed periodically. Typically, the soot is removed from the filter<br>
by oxidation reactions between carbon in the soot and either oxygen (i.e., burning) or<br>
nitrogen dioxide, both of which are constituents of the exhaust. The carbon may react<br>
with oxygen or nitrogen dioxide according to the following reactions:<br><br>
Reaction (1) is the primary reaction that occurs during an active regeneration.<br>
Reaction (2) is the primary reaction that occurs during passive regeneration. Heat is a<br>
significant by-product of the reaction shown in Reaction (1) and, if not controlled, can<br>
cause thermal runaway of the filter, leading to fractures and/or melting of the filter<br>
and rendering it ineffective as a filter.<br><br>
[0004]	Although thermal runaway may be prevented by controlling the<br>
rate at which carbon is burned in the filter, nonetheless the DPF may be subject to<br>
thermal gradients caused by differential heating patterns, which also may lead to<br>
fractures. Differential heating may occur during active regeneration of the filter<br>
where carbon may be unequally distributed, either radially or axially, within the DPF.<br>
For example, carbon may be more highly distributed in the DPF at locations where<br>
the largest volume of exhaust passes through the filter (i.e., at locations where exhaust<br>
velocity is highest). These locations may exhibit a relatively high temperature during<br>
active regeneration as compared to other locations.<br>
[0005]	Although carbon distribution may be altered by modifying the<br>
design of a filter, particulate filter manufacturers are hampered by material strength<br>
issues that limit the maximum porosity that can be obtained in an extruded<br>
honeycomb structure. Filter manufacturers typically design filters that have the<br>
lowest back pressure and suitable filtration efficiency as required for a particular<br>
engine. However, ceramic filter manufacturers have difficulty designing filters that<br>
have the lowest back pressure and suitable filtration efficiency without greatly<br>
weakening the honeycomb structures. Furthermore, it is commonly believed that<br>
filtration efficiency drops precipitously with even a single unblocked or broken<br>
channel in the honeycomb structure of the filter, even though unblocked channels<br>
might lower back pressure.<br>
[0006]	Therefore, there is a need for filters having modified design<br>
characteristics in order to minimize back pressure and thermal gradients during<br>
regeneration. Furthermore, it is desirable that these modified design characteristics<br>
can be combined with control techniques to create filters that are more durable and<br>
resistant to structural damage which may occur during use of the filter (e.g., during<br>
regeneration).<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0007]	Disclosed are exhaust aftertreatment filters and systems for<br>
filtering engine exhaust flowing along an axial direction. The filters include a<br><br>
plurality of flow channels comprising a plurality of wall-flow channels and a<br>
plurality of flow-through channels. The plurality of wall-flow channels and the<br>
plurality of flow-through channels may be positioned in the filter in order to<br>
improve back pressure, reduce temperature, and/or increase velocity of exhaust<br>
through the filter while maintaining filtering efficiency. Also disclosed are methods<br>
of manufacturing filters having modified performance characteristics.<br>
[0008]	The disclosed filters may be regenerable and composed of<br>
monolithic material on which trapped contaminant particulate from the engine<br>
exhaust is removed by addition of heat. In some embodiments, the filters are<br>
composed of material comprising an axially extending filter element having wall<br>
segments extending axially between upstream and downstream ends. The wall<br>
segments may define a plurality of axial flow channels including wall-flow<br>
channels and flow-through channels. Typically, the wall segments define a first set<br>
of first wall-flow channels where the wall segments are alternately sealed to each<br>
other by a first set of plugs to define a first set of wall-flow channels closed by the<br>
plugs and having open downstream ends; and the wall segments define a set of<br>
second wall-flow channels interdigitated with the first set of flow channels and<br>
having open upstream ends, the wall segments being alternately sealed to each other<br>
by a second set of plugs closing the second set of flow channels. The wall<br>
segments further define a third set of flow-through channels positioned in the filter<br>
for modifying the performance of the filter (e.g., achieving reduced back pressure,<br>
reduced temperature, and/or increased velocity of exhaust) while maintaining<br>
adequate filtering efficiency (e.g., efficiency of at least about 95%, 90%, 85%,<br>
80%, 75%, 70%, 60%, or 50% for soot concentrations of about 2.0 gL or less).<br>
[0009]	The number of flow-through channels may be adjusted to<br>
achieve a desired filter performance. In some embodiments, the number of flow-<br>
through channels represents at least about 1% of total channels (or at least about 2%<br>
of total channels in some embodiments) while the maintained filtering efficiency is<br>
at least about 90% (e.g., for soot concentrations of about 2.0 g/L or less). In other<br><br>
embodiments, the number of flow-through channels represents at least about 5% of<br>
total channels (or at least about 10% of total channels in some embodiments) while<br>
the maintained filtering efficiency is at least about 80% (e.g., for soot<br>
concentrations of about 2.0 g/L or less).<br>
[0010]	The filter may include a coating. For example, the wall<br>
segments of the filter may be coated with a coating material, which optionally may<br>
include a catalytic agent. In some embodiments of the filters, wall segments<br>
defining flow-through channels are coated with a coating material that comprises a<br>
catalytic agent. Catalytic agents may include oxidizing catalysts and reducing<br>
catalysts. Catalytic agents may include catalysts for at least one reaction selected<br>
from the group consisting of C + O2 → CO2 and 2NO + O2 → 2NO2. Catalytic<br>
agents may include noble metals (e.g., platinum, rhodium, and palladium.)<br>
[0011]	The wall segments defining the flow-through channels may<br>
have an average thickness different than an average thickness of the wall segments<br>
defining the first set of wall-flow channels or the wall segments defining the second<br>
set of wall-flow channels. In some embodiments of the filters, the wall segments<br>
defining the flow-through channels have an average thickness greater than an<br>
average thickness of the wall segments defining the first set of wall-flow channels<br>
or the wall segments defining the second set of wall-flow channels.<br>
[0012]	The flow-through channels may be distributed in the filter in<br>
any suitable arrangement. In some embodiments, the flow-through channels are<br>
distributed in the filter in a gradient, where the filter has an increasing concentration<br>
of open channels in sections located at peripheral positions in the filter as compared<br>
to sections located at central positions of the filter.<br>
[0013]	The filter may include wall segments further defining a fourth<br>
set of channels having closed downstream ends and closed upstream ends (i.e.,<br>
closed channels). The closed channels may be positioned in the filter in order to<br>
reduce physical damage to the periphery of the filter. In some embodiments of the<br>
filters, the closed channels form a peripheral ring in the filter. Optionally, the wall<br><br>
segments defining the closed channels have an average thickness greater than an<br>
average thickness of the wall segments defining the first set of wall-flow channels<br>
or the wall segments defining the second set of wall-flow channels. In further<br>
embodiments, the flow-through channels may be arranged in a ring adjacent to a<br>
peripheral ring formed by the closed channels.<br>
[0014]	The filter may be composed of any suitable material. In some<br>
embodiments, the filter is composed of a ceramic material, examples of which are<br>
cordierite, silicon carbide, mullite, and aluminum titanate. The filter may be<br>
monolithic (i.e., composed of single piece of material), or segmented (i.e.,<br>
composed of multiple pieces of material bonded together).<br>
[0015]	The filters may be utilized alone or may be combined with<br>
additional components in an exhaust aftertreatment system for filtering engine<br>
exhaust flowing along an axial direction. For example, an exhaust aftertreatment<br>
system as disclosed herein may include the following components in series along an<br>
axial direction: a diesel oxidation catalyst, a first filter as disclosed herein, and<br>
optionally a second filter.<br>
[0016]	The disclosed exhaust aftertreatment systems for filtering<br>
engine exhaust flowing along an axial direction may comprise at least a first filter<br>
and a second filter arranged in series along the axial direction, where the first filter<br>
is positioned upstream of the second filter and has a lower filtration efficiency than<br>
the second filter. The first and second filter may be composed of a monolithic<br>
ceramic material such as cordierite, silicon carbide, mullite, and aluminum titanate<br>
(optionally having a honeycomb or ceramic bead structure). The first filter, second<br>
filter, or both filters may include a coating material that comprises a catalytic agent<br>
(e.g., an oxidizing catalyst for converting nitric oxide to nitrogen dioxide).<br>
Typically, at least one of the first and second filters includes a plurality of wall-flow<br>
channels and flow-through channels. Optionally, at least one of the first and second<br>
filters includes closed channels. The flow-through channels and closed channels, if<br>
present, may be arranged in any suitable formation, including a formation where a<br><br>
peripheral ring of closed channels surrounds an adjacent ring of flow-through<br>
channels.<br>
[0017]	In the disclosed systems, the first filter may be composed of a<br>
first regenerable material and the second filter may be composed of a second<br>
regenerable material that is different than the first regenerable material. For<br>
example, the first regenerable material may have a larger pore diameter than the<br>
second regenerable material. In some embodiments, the first filter is a high cell<br>
density flow-through element having a cell density of greater than 200 per square<br>
inch. In other embodiments, the first filter may be a partially plugged filter. In<br>
further embodiments, the second filter may have a high cell density (e.g., a cell<br>
density of greater than 200 per square inch), which may be higher than the first<br>
filter.<br>
[0018]	In the disclosed systems, the first filter may have a soot<br>
filtration efficiency that is lower than the second filter. In some embodiments, the<br>
first filter has a soot filtration efficiency of at least about 50% (e.g., about 50-60%<br>
in some embodiments) and the second filter has a soot filtration efficiency of at<br>
least about 90% (or at least about 95% in some embodiments).<br>
[0019]	The disclosed systems optionally include a catalytic converter<br>
element, such as a diesel oxidation catalyst element, which may be arranged in<br>
series with the first filter and the second filter along the axial direction. The<br>
catalytic converter element may be positioned upstream of the first filter and may<br>
include an oxidizing catalyst for at least one reaction selected from the group<br>
consisting of 2CO + O2 → 2CO2; 2NO + O2 → 2NO2; and 4CxHy + (4x+y)O2 →<br>
(4x)CO2 + (2y)H2O (where in some embodiments x is an integer from 1-25 and y is<br>
an integer from 0-52). In some embodiments, the first filter may include an<br>
oxidizing catalyst for at least one reaction selected from the group consisting of<br>
2CO + O2 → 2CO2; 2NO + O2 → 2NO2; and 4CxHy + (4x+y)O2 → (4x)CO2 +<br>
(2y)H2O (where in some embodiments x is an integer from 1-25 and y is an integer<br>
from 0-52). Optionally, the second filter may include an oxidizing catalyst for at<br><br>
least one reaction selected from the group consisting of 2CO + O2 → 2CO2; 2NO +<br>
 O2 → 2NO2; and 4CxHy + (4x+y)02 → (4x)CO2 + (2y)H2O (where in some<br>
embodiments x is an integer from 1-25 and y is an integer from 0-52).<br>
[0020]	Also disclosed are methods for manufacturing a modified<br>
exhaust aftertreatment filter for filtering engine exhaust flowing along an axial<br>
direction and having modified performance. The modified filter has a structure as<br>
described herein.<br>
[0021]	In some embodiments of the methods of manufacture, an<br>
unmodified filter is composed of regenerable material comprising an axially<br>
extending filter element having wall segments extending axially between upstream<br>
and downstream ends. The wall segments may define a plurality of axial flow<br>
channels including wall-flow channels and flow-through channels. Typically, the<br>
wall segments define a first set of first wall-flow channels where the wall segments<br>
are alternately sealed to each other by a first set of plugs to define a first set of wall-<br>
flow channels closed by the plugs and having open downstream ends; and the wall<br>
segments define a set of second wall-flow channels interdigitated with the first set<br>
of flow channels and having open upstream ends, the wall segments being<br>
alternately sealed to each other by a second set of plugs closing the second set of<br>
flow channels.<br>
[0022]	The methods of manufacture typically include selecting and<br>
removing at least one plug of the first set of plugs and the second set of plugs to<br>
provide open flow in at least one channel of the modified filter. In some<br>
embodiments, the selected plug for removal is located at a position in the unmodified<br>
filter whereby removing the plug reduces back pressure on the modified filter during<br>
operation while maintaining filtering efficiency. In other embodiments, the selected<br>
plug for removal is located at a position in the unmodified filter which is subject to<br>
relatively high temperature during operation of the unmodified filter as compared to a<br>
non-selected plug, thereby reducing the relatively high temperature during operation<br>
of the modified filter while maintaining filtering efficiency. In further embodiments,<br><br>
the selected plug for removal is located at a position in the unmodified filter where<br>
exhaust flow exhibits relatively low velocity during operation of the unmodified filter<br>
as compared to a position of a non-selected plug, thereby increasing the relatively low<br>
velocity during operation of the modified filter while maintaining filtering efficiency.<br>
[0023]	Also disclosed are exhaust aftertreatment filters for filtering<br>
engine exhaust prepared by the disclosed methods of manufacture. In some<br>
embodiments, the filters prepared by the methods of manufacture include a number of<br>
flow-through channels representing at least about 1% of total channels (or at least<br>
about 2% of total channels in some embodiments) while the maintained filtering<br>
efficiency of the modified filter is at least about 90% (or at least about 80% in some<br>
embodiments) (e.g., for soot concentrations of about 2.0 g/L or less).<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0032]	Figure 1 shows an exhaust aftertreatment filter 10 for filtering<br>
exhaust from an internal combustion engine, such as diesel engine 12, flowing<br>
along an axial flow direction 14. Figure 2 shows a section view of the filter of<br>
Figure 1. The filter is composed of particulate filtration material 16, as known in<br>
the prior art, for example ceramic such as a cordierite, silicon carbide, mullite, or<br>
aluminum titanate on which trapped contaminant particulate from the engine<br>
exhaust is removed by addition of heat. The filter 10 includes wall-flow channels<br>
formed by wall segments having an upstream plug 34 or a downstream plug 36.<br>
Contaminant particulate such as soot is trapped and accumulates in the filter, which<br>
trapped contaminant particulate is burned-off during regeneration. The filter<br>
includes a filter body 18 having an outer periphery 20 surrounding a central core 22.<br>
Outer periphery 20 and central core 22 may be subject to differential thermal<br>
expansion during thermal cycling during regeneration, due to outer periphery 20<br>
being cooler than central core 22. For example, Figure 2 shows central hot spot 24,<br>
which is hotter than outer periphery 20, and which may be more dominant at the<br>
downstream side of the filter where particulate contaminant may accumulate and<br>
clog. With or without clogging or a downstream hot spot such as 24, outer<br><br>
periphery 20 may run cooler than central core 22, as is known. The filter is<br>
typically mounted in a housing 26, such as a stainless steel canister, having a mat<br>
mounting material 28 surrounding the filter body and performing a number of<br>
functions including thermal resistance, dampening of vibration, and resistance to<br>
movement. The mat material is typically compressed between housing 26 and filter<br>
body 18.<br>
[0033]	The noted differential thermal expansion between hotter<br>
central core 22 and cooler outer periphery 20 may subject the filter body to<br>
separational axial tensile stress in the axial direction which in turn subjects the filter<br>
body to separational fracture and cracking, for example as shown at fracture or<br>
crack line 30 in Figure 1. It is known by catalyst and filter manufacturers that the<br>
radial compressive stress applied by pressure obtained from an expanding mat<br>
material 28 assists in reducing the fracture probability of filter body 18. However,<br>
the radial compressive stress reduces the probability of fracture along a fracture line<br>
parallel to axis 31 of the filter perpendicular to crack line 30), and does little to<br>
prevent fractures along a fracture or crack line such as 30. Furthermore, the mat<br>
material can degrade over time, resulting in loss of pressure. With larger and<br>
heavier filters and longer lifetimes, particularly for diesel particulate filters in wall-<br>
flow application versus automotive flow-through catalyst application, the noted<br>
pressure and compressive stress applied by mat material 28 will decrease more<br>
rapidly, particularly than that observed for automotive catalysts. Furthermore, an<br>
automotive catalyst can still function after cracking because of its flow-through<br>
application, whereas a contaminant particulate filter loses effectiveness if cracked<br>
because of the bypass flow path created. The filter may include a pre-stressed layer<br>
32 bonded to filter body 18 at outer periphery 20 and is compressively axially pre-<br>
stressed in the opposite axial direction to the noted separational axial tensile stress<br>
to counteract the latter during regenerative heating.<br>
[0034]	The modified exhaust aftertreatment filters disclosed herein<br>
include a plurality of flow-through channels obtained by removing an upstream<br><br>
plug 34 or downstream plug 36 in what otherwise would be a wall-flow channel in<br>
an unmodified filter. The selected flow-through channels may be located at any<br>
suitable position in the modified filter and may be patterned in the filter in order to<br>
modify the performance of the filter. In some embodiments, open-flow channels<br>
may be provided at locations that are normally are subject to relatively low exhaust<br>
gas flow {e.g., locations at the outer diameter of the filter), which may result in a<br>
decreased pressure drop. The modified filters may include a percentage of open-<br>
flow channels relative to total channels that does not significantly impair filtering<br>
efficiency as illustrated in Figure 3.<br>
[0035]	For a filter subject to low speed laminar flow with a parabolic<br>
exhaust velocity distribution, channels may be opened in such a pattern that the<br>
number of the open channels is inversely related to the pipe velocity as shown in<br>
Figure 4, and according to the equation N = kl/(Velocity Profile), where N is the<br>
number of open channels within a selected area of the filter and kl is a coefficient<br>
which can be tuned to optimize the flow distribution. If a filter is located right after<br>
a fitting due to space constrain (such as an elbow or an expansion tube) and the<br>
fitting causes sudden changes of flow pathlines, channels may be opened against<br>
the velocity profile as shown in Figure 5. For fully developed turbulent flows as<br>
shown in Figure 6, the following equation may be used to determine a suitable<br>
number of open channels for a given area of the filter: N = k2/(Velocity Profile)I/n,<br>
where N is the number of open channels within a selected area of the filter; k2 is a<br>
coefficient which can be tuned to optimize the flow distribution; and 1 
[0036]	The modified filters typically include open-flow channels {i.e.,<br>
unplugged channels). Optionally, the modified filters may include double-plugged<br>
channels {i.e., channels having both an upstream plug 34 and a downstream plug<br>
36, as compared to a single-plug channel having only an upstream plug 34 or a<br>
downstream plug 36 and defining a wall-flow channel). The unplugged channels<br>
and double-plugged channels may be arranged in any suitable formation. Figure 7<br>
illustrates an arrangement in filter having a peripheral ring of double-plugged<br><br>
channels (either 2-cells or 4-cells wide) adjacent to a ring of unplugged channels<br>
(either 2-cells or 4-cells wide). For both double-plugged and unplugged cells<br>
(optionally in a ring formation), the wall thickness may be higher than single-<br>
plugged cells. A filter having double-plugged or unplugged cells with thicker walls<br>
may be more robust to handling, regeneration thermal shock, or ringoff failures. In<br>
some embodiments of the filters, double-plugged and unplugged cells may have<br>
lesser wall porosity relative to single-plugged cells.<br>
[0037]	A variety of distributions of plugs in the filters could be used<br>
to change gas flow, particularly in combination with a series filtration approach.<br>
For example, the disclosed filters may be used in a modified diesel particulate filter<br>
design to lower engine back pressure and improve soot distribution. In some<br>
embodiments, the design includes two filter elements, where the first filter element<br>
may have lower filtration efficiency than the second filter element.<br>
[0038]	By modifying the element architecture, it may be possible to<br>
improve the soot distribution on the filter, reduce thermal gradients during an active<br>
regeneration, and increase the level of passive regeneration. In a modified diesel<br>
particulate filter design, the filter element may be broken into two or more elements<br>
with progressively increasing filtration efficiency. Commonly, DPFs have about<br>
90% filtration efficiency. In a modified diesel particulate filter design, the filter<br>
may be separated into two separate filter elements. For example, the first filter may<br>
have a filtering efficiency on the order of 50-60%, while the second filter may have<br>
a filtration efficiency of about 90%. The reduction in filtration efficiency for the<br>
first filter may be attained by several methods. One method may be to reduce the<br>
percentage of plugged channels, either randomly, or in a specific pattern in the first<br>
filter. A second method may be to increase the pore diameter of the filter material<br>
of the first filter, thus allowing more soot particles to pass through the walls. A<br>
third method may be to use a high cell density flow-through element for the first<br>
filter (e.g., an element having a cell density greater than about 200 cells per square<br>
inch).<br><br>
[0039]	Potential methods for decreasing filtration efficiency for the<br>
first filter element could be to use a high cell density flow-through element, higher<br>
pore size filters, or selective plugging of channels (partially plugged filter). The use<br>
of a partially plugged filter may be used to affect the flow distribution and<br>
temperature distribution within a modified diesel particulate filter design.<br>
[0040]	A filtration system, as shown in Figure 8, incorporates a DOC<br>
to heat the exhaust gases to burn the accumulated soot in the filters. The first filter<br>
may also incorporate a catalyst to burn hydrocarbons not burned in the DOC and to<br>
oxidize NO (nitric oxide). Optionally, the second filter may incorporate a catalyst.<br>
[0041]	Catalysts, as described herein, may include oxidation catalysts<br>
and reduction catalysts. Catalysts may include NOx adsorbers (e.g., where x is 1 or<br>
2). In some embodiments, the combustion product of diesel particulate matter is a<br>
soot oxidation product, e.g., CO, and the noted downstream NOx adsorber is<br>
regenerated with the assistance of CO derived from the oxidation of the diesel<br>
particulate matter. The downstream NOx adsorber is provided in sufficiently close<br>
proximity to the diesel particulate filter to maximize the probability that the CO will<br>
assist in regeneration of the NOx adsorber. Preferably, the CO assists NOx adsorber<br>
regeneration by releasing stored NOx, for example according to the reaction<br>
Ba(N03)2 + 3CO -&gt; BaC03 + 2NO + 2C02. Furthermore, the CO preferably assists<br>
in regeneration of the NOx adsorber by reducing the released NOx to benign N2, for<br>
example according to the reaction NO + CO -&gt; 1/2N2 + C02. Furthermore, the CO<br>
preferably assists in regeneration of the NOx adsorber by oxidizing CO (either<br>
through one of the above two reactions, or by reaction with 02 over the noble metal<br>
component of the NOx adsorber according to CO + l/202 -$ C02) with substantial<br>
heat release. Close proximity of the particulate filter to the NOx adsorber allows<br>
efficient utilization of this heat to assist regeneration of the filters and systems<br>
disclosed herein.<br>
