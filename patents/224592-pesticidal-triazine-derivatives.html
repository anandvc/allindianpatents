The insecticidal, ovicidal and/or acaricidal action of the active ingredients according to the invention may manifest itself directly, i.e. in the mortality of the pests, which occurs immediately or only after some time, for example during moulting, or of their eggs, or indirectly, for example in reduced oviposition and/or hatching rate, good activity corresponding to a mortality of at least 50 to 60 %.<br>
The said animal pests include, for example, those mentioned in European Patent Application EP-A-736 252. The pests listed therein are therefore included by reference in the subject matter of the present invention;<br>
representatives of the order Acarina are especially<br>
Acarus siro, Aceria sheldoni, Aculus schlechtendali, Amblyomma spp., Argas spp., Boophi-lus spp., Brevipalpus spp., Bryobia praetiosa, Calipitrimerus spp., Chorioptes spp., Derma-nyssus gallinae, Eotetranychus carpini, Eriophyes spp., Hyalomma spp., Ixodes spp., Oly-gonychus pratensis, Ornithodoros spp., Panonychus spp., Phyllocoptruta oleivora, Poly-phagotarsonemus latus, Psoroptes spp., Rhipicephalus spp., Rhizoglyphus spp., Sarcoptes spp., Tarsonemus spp. and Tetranychus spp..<br>
The compounds according to the invention can be used to control, i.e. to inhibit or destroy, pests of the mentioned type occurring especially on plants, more especially on useful plants and ornamentals in agriculture, in horticulture and in forestry, or on parts of such plants, such as the fruits, blossoms, leaves, stems, tubers or roots, while in some cases parts of plants that grow later are still protected against those pests.<br>
Target crops include both natural crops and crops that have been modified by breeding or genetic methods, especially cereals, such as wheat, barley, rye, oats, rice, maize and sorghum; beet, such as sugar beet and fodder beet; fruit, e.g. pomes, stone fruit and soft fruit, such as apples, pears, plums, peaches, almonds, cherries and berries, e.g. strawberries, raspberries and blackberries; leguminous plants, such as beans, JentJIs, peas and<br><br>
soybeans; oil plants, such as rape, mustard, poppy, olives, sunflowers, coconut, castor oil, cocoa and groundnuts; cucurbitaceae, such as marrows, cucumbers and melons; fibre plants, such as cotton, flax, hemp and jute; citrus fruits, such as oranges, lemons, grapefruit and mandarins; vegetables, such as spinach, lettuce, asparagus, cabbages, carrots, onions, tomatoes, potatoes and paprika; lauraceae, such as avocado, cinnamon and camphor; and tobacco, nuts, coffee, aubergines, sugar cane, tea, pepper, vines, hops, bananas, natural rubber plants and ornamentals.<br>
The compounds according to the invention are especially suitable for controlling insects and representatives of the order Acarina, especially plant-destructive feeding insects, such as Anthonomus grandis, Diabrotica balteata, Heliothis virescens larvae, Plutella xylostella and Spodoptera littoralis larvae, and spider mites, such as Tetranychus spp., in cotton, fruit, citrus, maize, soybean, rape and vegetable crops.<br>
Further areas of use of the compounds according to the invention are the protection of stored goods and stocks and of material, and also in the hygiene sector, especially in the protection of warm-blooded animals, including farm animals, such as cows, pigs, sheep and goats, poultry, such as hens, turkeys and geese, animals bred for their fur, such as mink, foxes, chinchillas, rabbits and the like, and also domestic animals and pets, such as cats and dogs, and even human beings, against pests of the mentioned type.<br>
For example, flea infestation in domestic animals and pets is a problem for the animal owner to which there have as yet been found only unsatisfactory solutions. Owing to the complicated life cycle of the flea, none of the known methods of controlling fleas is totally satisfactory, especially since most of the known methods are aimed principally at controlling the fully grown fleas in the coat and take no account at all of the various juvenile stages of the fleas, which live not only in the animal's coat, but also on the floor, on carpets, on the animal's sleeping place, on chairs, in the garden and in all the other places with which the infested animal comes into contact. Flea treatment is generally expensive and must be continued for a prolonged period, success generally only being achieved when the treatment is applied not only to the affected animal, e.g. the dog or cat, but also simultaneously to any places frequented by the affected animal.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) according to the invention can be used alone or in combination with other biocides. For example, in order to increase the effect they can be combined with pesticides having the samie direction of action or in order to broaden the spectrum of action they can be combined with substances having a different direction of<br><br>
action. Where it is desired to extend the spectrum of action to endoparasites, e.g. worms, the compounds of formula (I) are advantageously combined with substances having endoparasiticidal properties. They can of course also be used in combination with antibacterial agents. Since the compounds of formula (I) are "adulticides", that is to say they are effective especially against the fully grown stages of the target parasites, the addition of pesticides that are more effective against the juvenile stages of the parasite may be very advantageous, since in this way the entire spectrum of the parasite population will be reached and, furthermore, a substantial contribution is made to avoiding the development of resistance.<br>
The good pesticidal activity of the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention corresponds to a mortality of at least 50-60 % of the mentioned pests.<br>
The action of the compounds according to the invention and the compositions comprising them against animal pests can be significantly broadened and adapted to the given circumstances by the addition of other insecticides and/or acaricides. Suitable additives include, for example, representatives of the following classes of active ingredient: organophosphorus compounds, nitrophenols and derivatives, formamidines, thioureas, benzoylureas, carbamates, pyrethroids, neonicotinoids, chlorinated hydrocarbons and Bacillus thuringiensis preparations.<br>

The compounds of formula (I) are used in unmodified form or, preferably, together with the adjuvants conventionally employed in formulation technology and can therefore be formulated in known manner e.g. into emulsifiable concentrates, directly sprayable or dilutable solutions, dilute emulsions, wettable powders, soluble powders, dusts, granules, and also encapsulations in polymer substances.<br>
The formulations, that is to say the compositions, preparations or mixtures comprising the compound (active ingredient) of formula (I), or a combination of that active ingredient with other agrochemical active ingredients and, as appropriate, a solid or liquid adjuvant, are prepared in known manner, e.g. by homogeneously mixing and/or grinding the active ingredients with extenders, for example with solvents, solid carriers, and optionally surface-active compounds (surfactants) and the invention relates also thereto.<br><br>
The invention relates also to the methods of application of the compositions, i.e. the methods of controlling pests of the mentioned type, such as spraying, atomising, dusting, coating, dressing, scattering or pouring, which are selected in accordance with the intended objectives and the prevailing circumstances, and to the use of the compositions for controlling pests of the mentioned type. Typical rates of concentration are from 0.1 to 1000 ppm, preferably from 0.1 to 500 ppm, of active ingredient. The rates of application per hectare are generally from 1 to 2000 g of active ingredient per hectare, especially from 10 to 1000 g/ha, preferably from 20 to 600 g/ha.<br>
A preferred method of application in the area of plant protection is application to the foliage of the plants (foliar application), the frequency and the rate of application being dependent upon the risk of infestation by the pest in question. However, the active ingredient can also penetrate the plants through the roots (systemic action) by impregnating the locus of the plants with a liquid formulation or by incorporating the active ingredient in solid form into the locus of the plants, for example into the soil, e.g. in granular form (soil application). In the case of paddy rice crops, such granules may be applied in metered amounts to the flooded rice field.<br>
The crop protection agents of the invention are also suitable for protecting vegetative reproductive material, e.g. seeds, such as fruits, tubers or grains, or plant seedlings, from animal pests. The reproductive material can be treated with the composition before the start of cultivation, seeds for example being dressed before they are sown. The active ingredients of the invention can also be applied to sejeds (coating) by either soaking the seeds in a liquid composition or coating them with a solid composition. The composition can also be given when the reproductive material is introduced to the place of cultivation, e.g. when the seeds are sown in the seed furrow. The treatment procedures for vegetative reproductive material and the vegetative reproductive material thus treated are further objects of the invention.<br>
As formulation auxiliaries there are used, for example, solid carriers, solvents, stabilisers, "slow release" auxiliaries, dyes and optionally surface-active substances (surfactants). Suitable carriers and auxiliaries include all those substances customarily used in plant protection compositions. Suitable auxiliaries, such as solvents, solid carriers, surface-active compounds, non-ionic surfactants, cationic surfactants, anionic surfactants and other auxiliaries in the compositions used according to the invention, include e.g. those described in EP-A-736 252; they are included by reference in the subject matter of the present invention.<br><br>
Suitable anionic surfactants include both so-called water-soluble soaps and water-soluble synthetic surface-active compounds.<br>
Suitable soaps are the alkali metal salts, alkaline earth metal salts or unsubstituted or substituted ammonium salts of higher fatty acids (C10-C22), eg- the sodium or potassium salts of oleic or stearic acid, or of natural fatty acid mixtures which can be obtained e.g. from coconut oil or tall oil. Mention may also be made of fatty acid methyltaurine salts as surfactants.<br>
More frequently, however, so-called synthetic surfactants are used, as mentioned in EP-A-736 252, especially fatty sulfonates, fatty sulfates, sulfonated benzimidazole derivatives and alkylarylsulfonates.<br>
The compounds of formula (I) are distinguished inter alia also by excellent activity against fleas, not only adult fleas being rapidly killed but also, by a circuitous route, the juvenile stages of the fleas. Flea larvae hatching out from the flea eggs feed substantially on the excreta of the adult fleas. Since the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention kill the adult fleas very rapidly, the necessary excreta are missing and the juvenile stages are deprived of the nutrient medium, so that they perish before reaching the adult stage.<br>
The present invention therefore relates preferably to a method of controlling parasites on human beings, domestic animals, productive livestock and pets, wherein an effective amount of a composition comprising at least one compound of formula (1), or a physiologically tolerable salt thereof, is administered systemically or, preferably, topically to the warmblooded animal.<br>
The long-term action is achieved by the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention with various forms of administration, for example by administering the active ingredient in a formulated form externally or internally to the animal to be treated. "Formulated" in this case means, for example, in the form of a powder, a tablet or granules, in liposomes or a capsule, in the form of an emulsion, a foam or a spray, in microencapsulated form or in pour-on or spot-on form. It will be understood that all orally administrable compositions comprise, in addition to customary formulation substances, further additives that encourage the host animal to take the composition orally voluntarily, e.g. suitable odorants and flavourings.<br>
Percutaneous administration, e.g. by subcutaneous or intramuscular injection or as a depot preparation in the form of an implant, and topical application, for example in pour-on or spot-on form, represent preferred subjects of this invention on account of their being easy to carry<br><br>
out. A further mode of administration is oral administration, e.g. in the form of a tablet. Percutaneous and topical forms of administration are of particular interest and give excellent results.<br>
Percutaneous forms of administration include, for example, subcutaneous, intramuscular and even intravenous administration of injectable forms. In addition to the customary syringes with needles, it is also possible to use needle-less high-pressure syringe devices.<br>
Pour-on and spot-on formulations are especially preferred as topical forms of administration, but administration in the form of sprays, ointments, solutions or powders may also be expedient.<br>
By selection of a suitable formulation, it is possible to enhance the ability of the active ingredients to penetrate the living tissue of the host animal and/or to maintain their availability. That is important when, for example, more sparingly soluble active ingredients are used, the low solubility of which requires means for enhancing solubility, since in such cases the animal's body fluid is capable of dissolving only small amounts of active ingre-dients at a time.<br>
Furthermore, in order to obtain a strongly delayed release of active ingredient, a compound of formula (I) according to the invention may also be present in a matrix formulation which physically prevents the active ingredient from being released and excreted prematurely and maintains the bioavailability of the active ingredient. Such a matrix formulation is injected into the body, e.g. intramuscularly or subcutaneously, and remains there as a form of depot from which the active ingredient is released continuously. Such matrix formulations are known to a person skilled in the art. They are generally wax-like, semi-solid substances, for example vegetable waxes and polyethylene glycols having a high molecular weight, or solid polymer formulations, for example so-called microspheres.<br>
The rate of release of the active ingredient from the implant and thus the period of time over which the implant exhibits an action is generally determined by the accuracy with which the implant has been calibrated (amount of active ingredient in the implant), the environment around the implant and the polymer formulation from which the implant has been made.<br>
The administration of veterinary medicinal additives to animal feed is well known in the field of animal health. It is usual first to prepare a so-called premix in which the active ingredient is dispersed in a liquid or is in finely divided form in solid carriers. That premix can normally<br><br>
comprise about 1 to 800 mg of compound per kg of premix, depending on the desired final concentration in the food.<br>
Since the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention may be hydrolysed by the constituents of the food, they should be formulated in a protective matrix, for example in gelatin, before being added to the premtix.<br>
The present invention accordingly relates also to the aspect of controlling parasites by administering to the host animal with its food a compound of formula (I) that has been protected against hydrolysis.<br>
A compound of formula (I) according to the invention is advantageously administered in a dose of from 0.01 to 800 mg/kg, preferably from 0.1 to 200 mg/kg, especially from 0.5 to 30 mg/kg, body weight, based on the host animal.<br>
A good dose that can be routinely administered to the host animal is from 0.5 to 100 mg/kg, especially from 0.1 to 40 mg/kg, body weight. The administration is effected at suitable intervals in dependence upon the mode of administration and body weight.<br>
The total dose may vary from one species of animal to another and also within a species of animal for the same active ingredient, since it depends inter alia on the weight, age and constitution of the host animal.<br>
When used according to the invention, the compound of formula (I) according to the invention will normally be administered not in pure form but, preferably, in the form of a composition that comprises, in addition to the active ingredient, constituents that assist administration, suitable constituents being those that are tolerated by the host animal. It is of course possible, as well as controlling the adult parasites in accordance with the invention, additionally to use conventional methods to control the juvenile stages of the fleas, although the latter is not absolutely essential.<br>
Such compositions to be administered in accordance with the invention generally comprise from 0.1 to 99 % by weight, especially from 0.1 to 95 % by weight, of a compound of formula (I) according to the invention and from 99.9 to 1 % by weight, especially from 99.9 to 5 % by weight, of a solid or liquid, physiologically tolerable carrier, including from 0 to 25 % by weight, especially from 0.1 to 25 % by weight, of a non-toxic dispersant.<br>
Whereas commercial products will preferably be formulated as concentrates, the end user will normally employ dilute formulations.<br><br>
Such formulations may also comprise further auxiliaries, such as stabilisers, antifoams, viscosity regulators, binders and tackifiers as well as other active ingredients for obtaining special effects.<br>
The physiologically tolerable carriers known from veterinary medicinal practice for oral, percutaneous and topical administration can be used as formulation auxiliaries. Some examples are given below.<br>
Suitable carriers are especially fillers, such as sugars, e.g. lactose, saccharose, mannitol or sorbitol, cellulose preparations and/or calcium phosphates, for example tricalcium phosphate or calcium hydrogen phosphate, and binders, such as starch pastes using, for example, maize, wheat, rice or potato starch, gelatin, tragacanth, methylcellulose and/or, if desired, disintegrators, such as the above-mentioned starches, also carboxymethyl starch, cross-linked polyvinylpyrrolidone, agar, alginic acid or a salt thereof, such as sodium alginate. Adjuvants are especially flow conditioners and lubricants, for example silicic acid, talc, stearic acid or salts thereof, such as magnesium or calcium stearate, and/or polyethylene glycol. Dragee cores can be provided with suitable, optionally enteric, coatings, there being used inter alia concentrated sugar solutions which may comprise gum arabic, talc, polyvinylpyrrolidone, polyethylene glycol and/or titanium dioxide, or coating solutions in suitable organic solvents or solvent mixtures, or, for the preparation of enteric coatings, solutions of suitable cellulose preparations, such as acetylcellulose phthalate or hydroxypropylmethyl-cellulose phthalate. Dyes, flavourings or pigments may be added to the tablets or dragee coatings, for example for identification purposes or to indicate different doses of active ingredient.<br>
Other orally administrable preparations are hard gelatin capsules, and also soft sealed capsules made of gelatin and a plasticiser, such as glycerol or sorbitol. The hard gelatin capsules may comprise the active ingredient in the form of granules, for example in admixture with fillers, such as lactose, binders, such as starches, and/or glidants, such as talc or magnesium stearate, and, if desired, stabilisers. In soft capsules, the active ingredient is preferably dissolved or suspended in suitable liquids, such as fatty oils, paraffin oil or liquid polyethylene glycols, to which stabilisers may likewise have been added. Preference is given inter alia to capsules that may either easily be bitten through or swallowed without being chewed.<br>
The pour-on or spot-on method comprises applying the compound of formula (I) to a locally defined area of the skin or coat, advantageously on the back of the neck or the backbone of<br><br>
the animal. This is carried out, for example, by applying a swab or spray of the pour-on or spot-on formulation to a relatively small area of the coat from where the active ingredient becomes distributed over a wide area of the coat almost automatically as a result of the spreading constituents of the formulation assisted by the movements of the animal.<br>
Pour-on and spot-on formulations advantageously comprise carriers that assist rapid distribution over the surface of the skin and in the coat of the host animal and are generally termed spreading oils. There are suitable, for example, oily solutions; alcoholic and iso-propanolic solutions, e.g. solutions of 2-octyl dodecanol or oleyl alcohol; solutions in esters of monocarboxylic acids, such as isopropyl myristate, isopropyl palmitate, lauric acid oxalic ester, oleic acid oleyl ester, oleic acid decyl ester, hexyl laurate, oleyl oleate, decyl oleate, caproic acid esters of saturated fatty alcohols of chain length C12-C18; solutions of esters of dicarboxylic acids, such as dibutyl phthalate, diisopropyl isophthalate, adipic acid diisopropyl ester, di-n-butyl adipate or solutions of esters of aliphatic acids, e.g. glycols. It may be advantageous for a dispersant known from the pharmaceutical or cosmetic industry also to be present. Examples are pyrrolidin-2-one, N-aikylpyrrolidin-2-one, acetone, polyethylene glycol and its ethers and esters, propylene glycol or synthetic triglycerides.<br>
The oily solutions include e.g. vegetable oils, such as olive oil, groundnut oil, sesame oil, pine oil, linseed oil and castor oil. The vegetable oils may also be in epoxidised form. It is also possible to use paraffins and silicone oils.<br>
Generally a pour-on or spot-on formulation will contain from 1 to 20 % by weight of a compound of formula (I), from 0.1 to 50 % by weight dispersant and from 45 to 98.9 % by weight solvent.<br>
The pour-on or spot-on method can be used especially advantageously for herd animals, such as cattle, horses, sheep and pigs, where it is difficult or time-consuming to treat all the animals orally or via injection. By virtue of its simplicity, this method can of course also be used for all other animals, including individual domestic animals and pets, and is very popular with the keepers of the animals because it can often be carried out without the expert assistance of a veterinary surgeon.<br>
Suitable for parenteral and percutaneous administration are oily injection solutions or suspensions, there being used suitable lipophilic solvents or vehicles, such as fatty oils, for example sesame oil, or synthetic fatty acid esters, for example ethyl oleate, or triglycerides, or aqueous injection solutions or suspensions that comprise viscosity-increasing substances,<br><br>
for example sodium carboxymethylcellulose, sorbitol and/or dextran, and, optionally, stabilisers.<br>
The preparations of the present invention can be prepared in a manner known perse, for example by means of conventional mixing, granulating, confectioning, dissolving or lyophi-lising processes. For example, pharmaceutical preparations for oral administration can be obtained by combining the active ingredient with solid carriers, optionally granulating the resulting mixture, and processing the mixture or granules, if desired or necessary after the addition of suitable excipients, to form tablets or dragee cores.<br>

The following Examples illustrate the invention described above but do not limit the scope thereof in any way. Temperatures are given in degrees Celsius. The symbol 'h' stands for 'hour'.<br>
1. Synthesis Examples<br>
Example 1.1: 3-(4-Bromophenvl)-6-(2,6-difluorophenvl)-[1,2,4]triazine<br>
a)	40.6 g of 2,6-difluoroacetophenone are placed in 120 ml of chloroform, and 0.1 g of aluminium chloride is added. Then, at 0oC, 37 g of bromine in 240 ml of chloroform are added dropwise and stirring is earned out at 0oC for 1 h. The reaction mixture is then heated to room temperature and is concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The residue is distilled over a Vigreux column. In this way 2-bromo-1-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-ethanone having a boiling point of 101-1 l0°C at 9 mbaris obtained.<br>
b)	24.2 g of 4-bromobenzoic acid hydrazide and 9.17 g of silver acetate are placed in 290 ml of dimethoxyethane. The brown suspension is heated at 60°C, 12.9 g of 2-bromo-1-(2,6-di-fluorophenyi)-ethanone are added and stirring is then carried out, with reflux cooling (about 85°C), for 48 h. The suspension is cooled to 40°C and filtered, and the filtrate is concentrated using a rotary evaporator. The crude product is purified by means of flash chromato-<br><br>
graphy (silica gel; dichloromethane/n-hexane 1:1). In this way the title compound having a melting point of 167-169°C is obtained.<br>
Example 1.2: 6-(2,6-Difluorophenvl)-3-(4'4-trifluoromethoxvbiphenvl-4-vl)--[1.2,41triazine<br>
244 mg of 3-(4-bromophenyl)-6-(2,6-difluorophenyl)-[1,2.4]triazine are placed in 1.8 ml of 1,2-dimethoxyethane, and 2.5 mg of bis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(ll) dichloride. 159 mg of 4-trJfluoromethoxyphenylboric acid and 176 mg of sodium hydrogen carbonate in 1.8 ml of water are added in succession. The reaction mixture is then heated at 70°C for 5 h. After cooling to room temperature, the suspension is poured into IN sodium hydroxide solution and extracted with ethyl acetate. The organic phase is washed with saturated sodium chloride solution, dried over sodium sulfate, filtered and concentrated. The crude product is dissolved in a minimum of hot ethyl acetate, filtered clear and crystallised at 0°C. In this way the title compound having a melting point of 199-202°C is obtained.<br>
Example 1.3: 6-(4-Bromophenvl)-3-(2.6-diifluorophenvl)-[1, .2.4]triazine<br>
a)	Under nitrogen, 3.15 g of methylthio-2,6-difluorobenzimidinium iodide are dissolved in<br>
30 ml of absolute methanol, and 1.32 g of tert-butyl carbazate are added. After being stirred at room temperature for 17 hours the reaction mixture is concentrated using a rotary evaporator and the residue is dried under a high vacuum. In this way N'-[(2,6-difluorophenyl)-iminomethyl]-hydrazinecarboxylic acid tert-butyl ester is obtained in the form of a yellowish foam, which is reacted further without further purification.<br>
b)	19.9 g of 4-bromoacetophenone are placed in 150 ml of methanol under nitrogen, and<br>

Compounds of Tables 1 to 6 exhibit good activity in this test.<br>
C.	Ectoparasiticidal action<br>
3.12.	Control of adult fleas in cats by means of pour-on application<br>
In order to determine the effectiveness of the test compounds against fully grown fleas, four groups each of two cats are used. Each cat is infested with 100 cat fleas [Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche)] and treated with 20 mg of active ingredient per kg body weight. The treatment is effected by applying the formulation to a locally limited area on the back of the cat's neck. One group is infested with fleas but is treated only with a placebo, that is to say a formulation without active ingredient, and serves as control. Another group is treated with nitenpyram as comparison substance; the two remaining groups are treated with the test compounds. Evaluation is made in each case by combing surviving fleas out of the animal's coat, counting them and comparing the number counted with the number of fleas in the control group and in the group treated with nitenpyram. The procedure in detail is as follows: each cat is infested with 100 fleas immediately after treatment on day 0. On day +1, each animal is combed and the number of surviving fleas is determined; the surviving fleas are then<br><br>
replaced on the same cat and after 24 hours the combing and evaluation are repeated. The fleas still surviving after those 24 hours are not returned to the cat. The described procedure is then repeated on days +3, +7, +9, +14, +21, +28, +35, +42 and +49 and in this way the effectiveness and duration of action are determined. On every day on which surviving fleas are combed out, a blood sample of about 2.7 ml is taken from each cat - with the exception of the control group - and the content of active ingredient is measured. The effectiveness is determined in accordance with the following formula:<br><br>
It is shown that the compounds of formula (I) according to the invention achieve excellent long-term action in comparison with nitenpyram.<br>
In dogs the test proceeds in an entirely analogous manner. Similar effects are also observed when the substances are administered not in the form<br>
of a pour-on but in the form of an injection solution.<br>
3.13. Control of adult fleas in cats by means of subcutaneous injection<br>
In order to determine the effectiveness of the test compounds against fully grown fleas, four groups each of two cats aged from 1.5 to 4 years are used. Each cat is infested with 100 cat fleas [Ctenocephalides felis (Bouche)] and treated with 20 mg of active ingredient per kg body weight. The treatment is effected by subcutaneous injection of a solution of the active ingredient behind the left shoulder blade. One group is infested with fleas but is treated only with a placebo, that is to say a formulation without active ingredient, and serves as control. Another group is treated with nitenpyram as comparison substance; the two remaining groups are treated with the test compounds. The evaluation is in each case carried out analogously to the preceding Example.<br>
It is shown that after subcutaneous injection the compounds of formula (1) according to the invention achieve excellent long-term action in comparison with nitenpyram.<br>
