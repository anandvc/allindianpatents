				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for preparation of arylamine. More particularly the present invention relates to a process for preparing arylamines by contacting an aromatic halide and an aromatic primary amine in the presence of a catalyst and a base. Background of the invention<br>
Aryl amines are attractive targets for chemical synthesis because of their wide<br>
utility  in  fine  chemicals,  dyes  and polymers.   High  purity  triarylamines  find<br>
application in xerographic photoreceptors where, as concentrated solid solutions in<br>
polymeric transport layers, they function as efficient hole conductors (US Patent<br>
5,648,539 and 4,265,990). Triarylamines are also important to a number of emerging<br>
technologies like nonlinear optical chromophores useful in the design of integrated<br>
electrooptic switches and modulators (US Patent 5,654,482 &amp; 5,723,671). Various<br>
methods have been described in the prior art for the preparation of arylamines. There<br>
are several reports in the prior art on the synthesis of aryl amines (US Patent<br>
5,648,842 &amp; 5,654,482). These and other prior art illustrate the Ullmann condensation<br>
reaction at high temperatures like 160°C using non ligated cuprous oxide as catalyst.<br>
The drawback of these processes is that they are prone to produce troublesome<br>
impurities due to high operating temperatures, necessitating extensive purification.<br>
This  becomes  important  for applications  in  charge  transporting molecules  in<br>
xerographic imaging and other electronic applications. European Patent Publication<br>
EP 0 617 005 A2 discloses the synthesis of certain aryl amines using copper catalyst<br>
in the form of metallic copper powder, copper sulfate, cuprous oxide, copper iodide or<br>
copper nitrate. However, the drawback of this process is also the use of very high<br>
temperatures such as 200°C and very high reaction times such as 30 hours. Thus there<br>
is a need to develop improved catalyst system, which operates at lower reaction<br>
temperatures and preferably for shorter reaction times. There are several reports on<br>
the use of ligated copper catalyst, which operates at lower temperatures (~115°C) (US<br>
Patents 5,705,697, 5,648,539, 5,723,671, 5,654,482 &amp; 5,648,542). All these reports<br>
use only N- containing organic compounds and more specifically 1,10-phenanthroline<br>
as a ligand. There are few reports on the use of P-containing catalysts, which have<br>
good catalyst activity (Org. Lett. 3, 4315-4317, 2001), but no diphos ligands.<br>
However, in these cases use of preformed catalyst complex Cu (PPh3) Br is necessary<br><br>
and no arylamine formation was observed when CuCl and free phosphine were used as catalyst system (Tet. Lett. 42, 4791-4793, 2001). However the drawback of this process is requirement of very high reaction time (24-32 h) using primary amines/secondary amines as reactants.<br>
Because of the commercial interest in arylamines, increasing academic as well as industrial attention has been paid towards research in developing new methods for their preparation. In view of the advantages and features of the present invention, the process of this invention would be a significant advancement in the current state of the art related to the synthesis of aryl amines.

The amount of catalyst used in the process of this invention can vary within<br>
wide limits and there is no real upper level for it. Because of the very high activity of<br>
the catalytic system very low amounts of catalyst may be employed. Typically<br>
0.00001 to 1 molar equivalent of copper catalyst can be employed with respect to the<br>
arylamine component added, the range of 0.001 to 1 mol being preferred.<br>
The process according to the present invention is carried out in presence of<br>
base acting as a neutralizer for the hydrogen halide generated during the course of the<br>
reaction. Preferably the base used is a strong, inorganic, organic base such as KOt-Bu,<br>
NaOt-Bu, KOH, NaOH, K2CO3, Cs2CO3, NaOMe, TEA, tri-t-butylamine, NaHCO3,<br>
l,8-Diazabicyclo[5.4.0] undec-7-ene (DBU); l,5-Diazabicyclo[2.2.0] non-5-ene<br>
(DBN); l,4-Diazabicyclo[2.2.2] octane (DABCO) l,5-Diazabicyclo[4.3.0] none-5-<br>
ene, N,N-Dimethylbenzylamine. The amount of base employed should be sufficiently<br>
enough to quench the halide from aryl halide. Alternatively an excess of base can be<br>
used if desired.<br>
The temperature of the reaction is preferably in the range of 50-200°C, a<br>
temperature range of 100 to 140°C being preferred.<br>
The reaction time is not a true variable of and it depends on the nature and<br>
amounts of reactions, catalyst, solvent, pressure, temperature etc. Typically the<br>
reaction time of 0.1 to 100 hours can be used and may vary according to need.<br>
It is obviously preferred that the compounds used, according, to present<br>
invention, are stable and free from any other functionality which may react under the<br>
reaction condition or retard the formation of desired product.<br>
The embodiments and examples described here to illustrate the catalyst<br>
activity and the process by no way limit the scope of the present invention and variety<br>
of similar type of substrates, that react in presence of said catalyst and condition, to<br>
give arylamine can be used.<br>
The present invention is described herein below with reference to illustrative<br>
examples and should not be construed to limit the scope of the invention in any<br>
manner.<br>

round bottom flask was then stirred by magnetic needle and heated to 115°C in oil<br>
bath and the reaction was continued for 3. 5 hours. After cooling to room temperature,<br>
the reaction solution was filtered to remove the precipitated base and washed with<br>
solvent. Product was separated by column chromatography and analyzed by NMR,<br>
IR and GC. The isolated yield of N,N'-diphenylpiperazine was 79%.<br>
N, N'-diphenyl piperazine<br>
Example 8<br>
Amination reaction was carried out in a 50 ml capacity two neck round bottom<br>
flask. In a typical experiment, Toluene (23 ml) was charged to the round bottom flask<br>
followed by Cul (0.28mmol), Cis 1,2-bis (diphenylphosphino) ethylene (0.28mmol),<br>
Morpholine (7.85mmol), iodobenzene (16.48mmols), and KOt-Bu (23.5mmol). The<br>
Round bottom flask was flushed twice with nitrogen to ensure removal of air. The<br>
round bottom flask was then stirred by magnetic needle and heated to 115°C in oil<br>
bath and the reaction was continued for 3. 5 hours. After cooling to room temperature,<br>
the reaction solution was filtered to remove the precipitated base and washed with<br>
12<br>
solvent. Product was separated by column chromatography and analyzed by NMR,<br>
IR and GC. The isolated yield of N-phenyl morpholine was 75%.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
