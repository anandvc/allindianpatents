A VEHICLE LOCATING UNIT WITH IMPROVED<br>
POWER MANAGEMENT METHOD<br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to vehicle recovery systems and, in particular, a vehicle<br>
locating unit of such a system with improved power management techniques.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The applicant's successful and popular vehicle recovery system sold under the<br>
trademark LoJack® includes a small electronic vehicle locating unit (VLU) with a<br>
transponder hidden within a vehicle, a private network of communication towers each<br>
with a remote transmitting unit (RTU), one or more law enforcement vehicles<br>
equipped with a vehicle tracking unit (VTU), and a network center with a database of<br>
customers who have purchased a VLU. The network center interfaces with the<br>
National Criminal Information Center. The entries of that database comprise the VTN<br>
number of the customer's vehicle and an identification code assigned to the<br>
customer's VLU.<br>
When a LoJack® product customer reports that her vehicle has been stolen, the<br>
VIN number of the vehicle is reported to a law enforcement center for entry into a<br>
database of stolen vehicles. The network center includes software that interfaces with<br>
the database of the law enforcement center to compare the VIN number of the stolen<br>
vehicle with the database of the network center which includes VIN numbers<br>
corresponding to VLU identification codes. When there is a match between a VIN<br>
number of a stolen vehicle and a VLU identification code, as would be the case when<br>
the stolen vehicle is equipped with a VLU, and when the center has acknowledged the<br><br>
WO 2006/124925	PCT/US2006/018963<br>
2<br>
vehicle has been stolen, the network center communicates with the RTUs of the<br>
various communication towers (currently there are 130 nationwide) and each tower<br>
transmits a message to activate the transponder of the particular VLU bearing the<br>
identification code.<br>
The transponder of the VLU in the stolen vehicle is thus activated and begins<br>
transmitting the unique VLU identification code. The VTU of any law enforcement<br>
vehicles proximate the stolen vehicle receive this VLU transponder code and, based<br>
on signal strength and directional information, the appropriate law enforcement<br>
vehicle can take active steps to recover the stolen vehicle. See, for example, US<br>
Patent Nos. 4,177,466; 4,818,988; 4,908,609; 5,704,008; 5,917,423; 6,229,988;<br>
6,522,698; and 6,665,613 all incorporated herein by this reference.<br>
Since the VLU unit is powered by the vehicle's battery, power management<br>
techniques must be enfployed in the VLU to ensure the VLU does not drain the<br>
vehicle's battery. One prior technique employed by the applicant includes<br>
programming the VLU to "wake up" and check for messages from the communication<br>
towers only periodically, e.g., every 8 seconds for .2 seconds. The timing of the sleep<br>
and wake-up modes was synchronized to the transmission schedule of one<br>
communication tower. See US Patent No. 6,229,988.<br>
But, if the vehicle equipped with the VLU so programmed moves out of the<br>
transmission range of that tower, when the VLU wakes up, no signal will be received<br>
from that tower. According to prior methods, the VLU must wake up for a longer<br>
time in order to be sure to receive a tower transmission since the VLU has no memory<br>
of which time slot the tower is likely to transmit. This results in increased power<br>
consumption.<br><br>

BRIEF SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is therefore an object of this invention to provide a vehicle locating unit with<br>
improved power management technique.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide such a vehicle locating unit<br>
whose wake-up and sleep modes are synchronized to the communication source<br>
transmitting the strongest signal.<br>
It is a further object of this invention to provide such a vehicle locating unit<br>
which continuously updates its memory to store the identity of one or more<br>
communication towers with the strongest signals.<br>
The subject invention results from the realization that a more effective power<br>
management subsystem for a VLU is configured to alternately enter sleep and wake-<br>
up modes, to synchronize the wake-up mode to the communication source (e.g.,<br>
tower) transmitting the strongest signal, and to test the signal strength of at least one<br>
additional communication source in sequence.<br>
The subject invention, however, in other embodiments, need not achieve all<br>
these objectives and the claims hereof should not be limited to structures or methods<br>
capable of achieving these objectives.<br>
The subject invention features a vehicle locating unit with improved power<br>
management. A receiver receives a signal from a network of communication sources<br>
and a signal strength monitoring subsystem determines which of the communication<br>
sources are transmitting the strongest signals. The power management subsystem is<br>
responsive to the signal strength monitoring subsystem and is configured to:<br>
alternatively enter sleep and wake-up modes, synchronize the wake-up mode to the<br><br>
WO 2006/124925	PCT/US2006/018963<br>
4<br>
communication source transmitting the strongest signal, and test the signal strength of<br>
at least one additional communication source according to a predefined sequence.<br>
Typically, the power management subsystem is configured to test and store the<br>
identity of two communication sources with the two strongest signals, switch to<br>
synchronization with any communication source having a signal stronger than the<br>
strongest signal of the two stored communication sources, and store the identity of<br>
any communication source with a signal stronger than the signal of any previously<br>
stored communication source.<br>
In one embodiment, there are n (e.g., eight) communication sources each<br>
transmitting a signal at a different time every n seconds. Preferably, the power<br>
management system is configured to include a start-up mode wherein all<br>
communication sources are tested. In one preferred embodiment, the power<br>
management subsystem is implemented in a microcontroller which is configured to<br>
power down the receiver during the sleep mode and to power up the receiver during<br>
the wake-up mode. One example of a signal strength monitoring subsystem includes<br>
a demodulation circuit embodied in a transceiver.<br>
A method of checking messages from a network of communication sources in<br>
accordance with this invention includes initially testing the signal strength of a<br>
plurality of communication sources, storing the identity of the communication sources<br>
with the two strongest signals, alternatively entering a sleep mode and a wake-up<br>
mode, the wake-up mode synchronized to the communication source with the<br>
strongest signal, testing the signal strength of one additional communication source,<br>
switching synchronization to the additional communication source if said source<br>
presents a signal stronger than the signal of the stored communication source with the<br><br>
WO 2006/124925	PCT/US2006/018963<br>
5<br>
strongest signal, and replacing the identity of any stored communication source if an<br>
additional communication source tested in sequence presents a signal stronger than<br>
the signal of said stored communication source.<br>
For VLUs and other electronic receivers which receive a signal from a<br>
network of communication sources, a signal strength monitoring subsystem<br>
determines which of the communication sources are transmitting the strongest signals.<br>
A power management subsystem is responsive to the signal strength monitoring<br>
subsystem and is configured to: alternatively enter sleep and wake-up modes,<br>
synchronize the wake-up mode to the communication source transmitting the<br>
strongest signal, and test the signal strength of at least one additional communication<br>
source to ensure the wake-up mode is synchronized to the communication source<br>
transmitting the strongest signal.<br>
One embodiment features a vehicle locating unit power management system<br>
comprising a memory, and a controller configured to alternatively output sleep and<br>
wake-up mode signals, store in said memory the identity of at least a first<br>
communication source presenting the strongest signal, test the signal strength of at<br>
least one different communication source during the wake-up mode, synchronize the<br>
wake-up mode to the communication source identified in said memory, and update<br>
the memory to store the identity of a different communication source presenting a<br>
signal stronger than the first communication source.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENT<br>
Aside from the preferred embodiment or embodiments disclosed below, this<br>
invention is capable of other embodiments and of being practiced or being carried out<br>
in various ways. Thus, it is to be understood that the invention is not limited in its<br>
application to the details of construction and the arrangements of components set forth<br>
in the following description or illustrated in the drawings. If only one embodiment is<br>
described herein, the claims hereof are not to be limited to that embodiment.<br>
Moreover, the claims hereof are not to be read restrictively unless there is clear and<br>
convincing evidence manifesting a certain exclusion, restriction, or disclaimer.<br>
As discussed in the background section above, the applicant's successful and<br>
popular vehicle recovery system sold under the trademark LoJack® includes a small<br>
electronic vehicle locating unit (VLU) 10, Fig. 1, with a transponder 12 hidden within<br><br>
WO 2006/124925	PCT/US2006/018963<br>
7<br>
a vehicle 14, a private network of communication lowers 16 each with a remote<br>
transmitting unit (RTU) 18, one or more law enforcement vehicles 20 equipped with a<br>
vehicle tracking unit (VTU) 22, and network center 24.<br>
When a LoJack® product customer reports that her vehicle has been stolen, the<br>
VIN number of the vehicle is reported to law enforcement center 26 for entry into<br>
database 28 of stolen vehicles. Network center 24 includes software that interfaces<br>
with database 28 of law enforcement center 26 to compare the VIN number of the<br>
stolen vehicle with database 30 of network center 24 which includes VIN  numbers<br>
corresponding to VLU identification codes. When there is a match between a VIN<br>
number of a stolen vehicle and a VLU identification code, as would be the case when<br>
stolen vehicle 14 is equipped with VLU 10, network center 24 communicates with the<br>
RTUs 18 of the various communication towers 16 and each tower transmits a message<br>
to activate transponder 12 of VLU 10 bearing the particular identification code.<br>
Transponder 12 of VLU 10 in stolen vehicle 14, once activated, begins<br>
transmitting a unique VLU identification code. VTU 22 of law enforcement vehicle<br>
20 proximate stolen vehicle 14 receives this VLU transponder code and, based on<br>
signal strength and directional information, the appropriate law enforcement vehicle<br>
can take active steps to recover stolen vehicle 14.<br>
VLU 10', Fig. 2, in accordance with the subject invention includes transceiver<br>
40 or, in another example, a receiver without transmission capabilities. Signal<br>
strength monitoring subsystem 42, in one embodiment, is a demodulator circuit on a<br>
chip within transceiver 40 and outputs a signal identifying and characterizing the<br>
signal strength of all signals received by transceiver 40 via antenna 44 from the<br>
communication network and one or more communication towers 16, Fig. 1.<br><br>
WO 2006/124925	PCT/US2006/018963<br>
8<br>
Microcontroller 46, Fig. 2, (e.g., a Texas Instrument microcontroller model<br>
No. MSP430) receives the output of subsystem 42, is programmed to evaluate the<br>
signal strength of all signals received by transceiver 40, and is also programmed to<br>
alternatively cause transceiver 40 to enter sleep and wake-up modes to save battery<br>
power by outputting a signal to power supply unit circuitry 48 in accordance with the<br>
flow-chart of Fig. 3. Memory 47, Fig. 2, is shown separate from controller 47 but<br>
many microcontrollers, as is known by those skilled in the art, have internal memories<br>
including the controller example above.<br>
In the following example, there are eight communication sources or LoJack<br>
towers A-H, Fig. 4, transmitting signals to VLU 10', Fig. 2. Each transmits a<br>
synchronization signal at a different time t0-t7 each eight seconds and possibly a<br>
message (in the case of a reportedly stolen vehicle) in which instance microcontroller<br>
46, Fig. 2 would activate transponder 12.<br>
But, transceiver 40, if continuously left on to check for such a message, would<br>
more quickly drain the battery of the vehicle. According to the subject invention,<br>
microcontroller 46 at start-up, step 60, Fig. 3, tests the signal strength of towers A-H<br>
by analyzing the output of signal strength monitoring subsystem 42. In this test mode,<br>
the signal strength of each tower is noted and if any signal carries a message, the<br>
message is acted upon.<br>
The identity of the two strongest tower signals is stored in memory 47, Fig. 2,<br>
step 62, Fig. 3, and the wake-up mode is then synchronized, step 64, to the strongest<br>
of these two signals. Next, the sleep mode is entered and when the wake-up mode is<br>
activated in synchronization with the communication tower presenting the strongest<br>
signal, the signal strength of the two previously stored towers is tested as is the signal<br><br>
WO 2006/124925	PCT/US2006/018963<br>
9<br>
strength of one additional communication tower, in sequence.<br>
As an example, suppose towers A and B, Fig. 4, are transmitting the strongest<br>
signals by virtue of their proximity to VLU 10, Fig. 2. If tower A's signal is assumed<br>
to be stronger than tower B's signal, the wake-up mode synchronization is in<br>
accordance with tower A's signal. Thus, in each cycle, (typical wake up times are 8<br>
sec. apart), controller 46 would power up transceiver 40 by signaling power supply<br>
unit circuit 48 at time t0, Fig. 4, and sleep between times t0-t7, steps 66-68. At the<br>
next wake-up time, the signal strength of the two previously slored towers (A and B)<br>
is tested for strength as is the signal strength of the next tower according to a<br>
predefined sequence which, in this example, is tower C, step 70. In this way, if at any<br>
time due to movement of the vehicle a different tower in the sequence A-H presents a<br>
stronger signal than a) the tower upon which controller 46 synchronizes the wake-up<br>
mode or b) the stored identity of the tower with the second strongest signal, the<br>
identity of the new tower is stored in memory 47, Fig. 2, steps 72-74, Fig. 3, and<br>
synchronization to the tower with the strongest signal is ensured at step 64.<br>
Suppose, however, that tower C does not present a stronger signal than either<br>
towers A or B and that the wake up and sleep modes are still synchronized to tower A<br>
in step 66. At steps 68 and 70 towers A, B, and now D are tested and if tower D's<br>
signal strength is not stronger than either tower A or B and once again the sleep mode<br>
is entered, step 66. Upon entering the wake-up mode at step 68, still synchronized to<br>
tower A, the signal strength of towers A, B, and now E is checked, step 70.<br>
Now, if the signal strength of tower E is stronger than the signal strength of<br>
tower B, but not tower A, the identity of tower E is stored in memory 47, Fig. 2 at<br>
step 74, Fig. 3, replacing tower B. But at step 64 the wake-up mode is still<br><br>
WO 2006/124925	PCT/US2006/018963<br>
10<br>
synchronized to the strongest tower, namely tower A at steps 64-68.<br>
So, next, the signal strengths of towers A, E, and F are tested, step 70; and<br>
suppose at step 72 the signal strength of tower F is stronger than tower A and E but<br>
tower A is still stronger than tower E. Now, synchronization will be according to<br>
tower F at step 64 and at step 70, towers F, A, and G are tested, and so on.<br>
In another example, imagine towers C and D initially present the strongest<br>
first and second signals to the VLU. The wake up mode is initially synchronized to<br>
tower C and the identity of towers C and D are stored in memory. After the first sleep<br>
mode, the signal strength of towers C, D, and E are tested, and next towers C, D, and<br>
F, and then towers C, D, and G, and then towers C, D, and H, and so on - one<br>
additional tower during each subsequent wake-up mode. If during this wake-up/sleep<br>
mode cycle, towers C and D remain the strongest two towers, synchronization<br>
remains with tower C and the memory continues to store the identity of towers C and<br>
D. If during the next cycle, when tower A is tested and is found to present a signal<br>
stronger than tower D but not C, the memory is. updated to store the identity of towers<br>
C and A, synchronization continues according to tower C's transmission schedule,<br>
and during each subsequent wake-up mode the signal strength of towers C, A, and B;<br>
C, A, and D; C, A, and E; C, A, and F... and so on is tested.<br>
In this way, the identity of the towers which transmit the two strongest signals<br>
is always stored and controller 46, Fig. 2 in sequence checks another tower in the<br>
wake-up mode to maintain in storage 47, Fig. 2, the identity of the two towers<br>
emitting the strongest signals. Also, controller 46 ensures the wake-up mode is<br>
synchronized to only the tower emitting the strongest signal. Power is conserved but<br>
now in a way which ensures no communication message from any tower in the<br><br>
WO 2006/124925	PCT/US2006/018963<br>
11<br>
network is missed. To enter the sleep mode, microcontroller 46 sends a signal to<br>
power supply unit 48 which then powers down transceiver 40. To enter the wake-up<br>
mode, microcontroller 46 sends a signal to power supply unit 48 which then again<br>
provides power to transceiver 40 so that it can receive signals via antenna 44.<br>
The example presented above in reference to Figs. 3-4 assumes eight towers in<br>
a given region, continuous storage of the two strongest tower signals, and testing of an<br>
additional tower in a specific sequence, hut this is an example only and not a<br>
limitation of the subject invention: any number and combination of towers and storage<br>
of tower combinations can be used. The example above also assumes that the power<br>
management method of the subject invention applies to a VLU of a vehicle recovery<br>
system but the invention hereof may find applicability to battery powered electronic<br>
devices other than VLUs.<br>
Thus, although specific features of the invention are shown in some drawings<br>
and not in others, this is for convenience only as each feature may be combined with<br>
any or all of the other features in accordance with the invention. Moreover, the words<br>
"including", "comprising", "having", and "with" as used herein are to be interpreted<br>
broadly and comprehensively and are not limited to any physical interconnection.<br>
Also, any embodiments disclosed in the subject application are not to be taken as the<br>
only possible embodiments. Other embodiments will occur to those skilled in the art<br>
and are within the following claims.<br>
In addition, any amendment presented during the prosecution of the patent<br>
application for this patent is not a disclaimer of any claim element presented in the<br>
application as filed: those skilled in the art cannot reasonably be expected to draft a<br>
