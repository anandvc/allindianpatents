				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to a novel vaccine for use in treatment of AIDS as well as methods for production thereof.   More particularly the invention relates to a vaccine which may be produced in large quantities and which is non-cytolytic and avirulent. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Despite recent advances in antiviral therapy, there is no permanent cure for AIDS or HIV infection. Drug therapy, is a promising arena of investigation in terms of providing effective therapy, however because of side effects, compliance, and expense, progress has not been rapid. Compounding these difficulties is the fact that the availability of such drugs is limited in developing countries where it is estimated that 90% of HIV infections will occur by the year 2000.<br>
Due to the success that vaccines to infectious diseases have had, the most noteable being against small pox and polio, the search for an effective vaccine against AIDS continues. A variety of approaches have been tried. Indeed, most HIV-1 vaccine development has concentrated on subunit vaccines. The difficulty with the subunit vaccine approach has been the ability to produce optimal immunity. At present, it is not known exactly which components of the HIV antigen(s) and the immune system are necessary for protection from natural infection.<br>
Early vaccine trials have looked at recombinant subunit protein based immunogens, such as the HIV-1 envelope protein gplZO. The results from this approach have been disappointing, although, immunization regimens that employ both live recombinant virus and subunit protein have, in some individuals, elicited both envelope specific CD8+ CTL and neutralizing antibody to the HIV-1 envelope (Cooney EL, et al., Proc Natl Acad Sci USA 1993; 90: 1882-86; McElrath MJ, et al. J Infect Dis. 169: 41-47 (1994); Graham BS, et al. J Infect Dis 166: 244-52 (1992); and Graham BS, et al. J Infect Dis 167: 533-37 (1993)).<br>
Studies of the envelop glycoprotein of HIV have not yielded a plausible path to vaccine development. For example, in respect of HIV-1 gp!20, the signal sequence of HIV-1 envelop glycoprotein gp!20, which is referred to as NSS for HIV-1 natural signal sequence, has been found to be associated with the extent of secretion of gp!20. In this respect it has been shown that substitution of the NSS with either mellitin or IL-3 signal sequence renders a high level production and efficient secretion of gp!20 ( Li, Y., et al. Virology 204: 266-278 (1994); and Li, Y., et al. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci .93: 9606-9611 (1996). However, it-is not known whether the signal-sequence of HIV-1 gp!20 has a role to play in the pathogenicity of the virus.<br>
The preferred route is the use of whole, inactivated virus vaccines, such as inactivated polio virus vaccine, or attenuated live virus vaccines, such as oral<br><br>
polio vaccine. Unfortunately, this approach in the search for an AIDS virus vaccine appears too dangerous, given the potential for problems such as the "Cutter incident" in which inadequate inactivation of the polio vaccine resulted in actual clinical polio. A previous approach has incorporated use of the wild-type HIV-1, however, it was impossible to produce an adequate amount of virus for killed whole virus because the yield of HIV-1 infected T-cell lines was very low (Coffin et ai. Retroviruses, CSH Press, 1989). Assuming it is possible to increase yield, there is also concern about the potential liability in growing large volumes of infectious HIV-1.<br>
With respect to HIV vaccines it is known that deletion of the HIV nef gene attenuates the virus. Desrosiers and his associates have demonstrated that vaccination of macaques with nef-deleted SIV protected wild-type SIV challenge (Daniels, M.D. et al. Science 258:1938 (1992); Desrosiers, R.C., et d. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86:6353 (1989)) and others have demonstrated that nef gene is dispensable for SIV and HIV replication (Daniels, M.D. et al. Science 258:1938 (1992); Gibbs, J.S., et al. AIDS Res. and Human Retroviruses 10:343 (1994); Igarashi, T., et al. J. Gen. Virol. 78:985 (1997); Kestler III, H.W., et al. Cell 65:651 (1991)). Furthermore, deletion of nef gene renders the virus to be non-pathogenic in the normally susceptible host (Daniels, M.D. e t al. Science 258:1938 (1992)). Although this deletion does not provide a form of the virus which is possible to produce in large quantities. Neither too, has this form of the virus been shown to be safe for the production of a vaccine.<br>
Consequently, what is needed is a vaccine which is avirulent as well as being capable of being produced in large quantities, and without the previous concerns and problems of using wild-type HIV-1. SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present inventors have found that the natural signal sequence (NSS) of the Human Immunodeficiency Virus-1 (HIV-1) envelope glycoprotein gp120 is responsible for apoptosis as well as general necrosis of virus infected cells. The inventors have also found that replacement of the NSS with a more efficient signal sequence, such as meliitin or IL-3 signal sequence, generates a non-cytolytic HTV-1 which is capable of highly efficient replication and secretion of gp120. Consequently, the present invention relates to a non-cytolytic retrovirus which is capable of highly efficient viral replication and which is therefore useful in preparing a retroviral vaccine.

According to another embodiment, an essentially non-cytolytic retrovirus is also avirulent. Accordingly, the present invention provides an avirulent, essentially non-cytolytic retrovirus comprising a nucleic acid sequence addition or deletion that renders the virus avirulent and wherein the natural signal sequence of the virus' envelope glycoprotein is either modified or replaced to provide an essentially non-cytolytic signal sequence.<br>

As mentioned hereinabove, the present invention relates to an essentially non-cytolytic retrovirus wherein the natural signal sequence of HIV-1 envelope glycoprotein gp!20 (NSS) is modified to be essentially non-cytolytic or is replaced with an essentially non-cytolytic signal sequence. The term "essentially non-cytolytic" as used herein means that the retrovirus does not significantly damage or kill the cells it infects.<br>
In one embodiment, the present invention provides an essentially non-cytolytic recombinant HTV-1 capable of highly efficient replication wherein the NSS of the virus' envelope glycoprotein is modified sufficiently to prevent cell damage by the virus, preferably by eliminating positively charged amino acids, even more preferably, such elimination or modification resulting in no more than one (1) and preferably zero (0) positively charged amino acids. The positively charged amino acids which may be modified or replaced include lysine and arginine.<br>
In another embodiment, replacement of the natural signal sequence results in a more efficient replication of HIV. Accordingly the present invention provides an essentially non-cytolytic recombinant HIV-1 capable of highly efficient replication wherein the NSS of the virus' envelope glycoprotein is replaced with an essentially non-cytolytic and more efficient signal sequence. In a preferred embodiment, replacement of the NSS of the envelope glycoprotein of HIV-1 with either the mellitin or IL-3 signal sequence decreases the cytotoxicity of the retrovirus. As such, the present invention includes within its scope replacement of NSS with any signal sequence which<br>
renders the retrovirus essentially non-cytolytic. The inventors have also shown that replacement of the NSS with mellitin or IL-3 signal sequences results in a greater level of production and secretion of gp120, in addition to the reduced cytotoxicity. The inventors have also shown that replacement of the NSS results in partial deletion the upu gene. Studies have shown the upu gene can be completely deleted without any measurable impact on the virus' ability to replicate (James et al. AIDS Res. Human Retrovirus 10:343-350, 1994).<br>

The retrovirus may also have a portion of the i)pu gene deleted as a result of replacement of the NSS. Preferably the essentially non-cytolytic signal sequence is selected from the group consisting of the mellitin sequence and the IL-3 signal sequence.<br>
According to one embodiment, modification of the natural signal sequence of a retrovirus' envelope glycoprotein results in a more efficient replication of the virus, preferably HIV. Accordingly, the present invention provides a non-cytolytic recombinant HIV-1 capable of highly efficient replication wherein the NSS of the virus' envelope glycoprotein is modified sufficiently to prevent cell damage by the virus, preferably by eliminating positively charged amino acids, even more preferably,<br>
such elimination or modification resulting in no more than one (1) positively charged amino acid, more preferably no more than zero (0) positively charged amino acids.<br>

Accordingly, the present invention also includes a method of preventing or treating a retroviral infection comprising administering a vaccine of the present invention to an animal in need thereof. As used herein, "vaccine" includes all prophylactic and therapeutic vaccines. According to one embodiment the vaccine contains an avirulent and essentially non-cytolytic recombinant retrovirus, wherein the NSS of the virus' envelope glycoprotein is modified to provide an essentially non-cytolytic NSS or is replaced with an essentially non-cytolytic NSS and the virus is rendered avirulent by deleting a sufficient portion of the nef gene.<br>
The vaccine compositions of the invention are suitable for adminstration to subjects in a biologically compatible form in vivo. The expression "biologically compatible form suitable for administration in vivo" as used herein means a form of the substance to be administered in which any toxic effects are outweighed by the therapeutic effects. The substances may'be administered to any animal, preferably humans.<br>
The vaccines of the present invention may additionally contain suitable diluents, adjuvants and/or carriers. Preferably, the vaccines contain an adjuvant which can enhance the immunogenicity of the vaccine in vivo. The adjuvant<br>
may be selected from many known adjuvants in the art including the lipid-A portion of gram negative bacteria endotoxin, trehaJose dimycolate of mycobacteria, the phospholipid lysolecithin, dimethyldictadecyl ammonium bromide (DDA), certain linear polyoxypropylene-polyoxyethylene (POP-POE) block polymers, aluminum hydroxide, and liposomes. The vaccines may also include cytokines that are known to enhance the immune response including GM-CSF, IL-2, IL-12, TNF and IFNy.<br>
The dose of the vaccine may vary according to factors such as the disease state, age, sex, and weight of the individual, and the ability of antibody to elicit a desired response in the individual. Dosage regime may be adjusted to provide the optimum therapeutic response. For example, several divided doses may be administered daily or the dose may be proportionally reduced as indicated by the exigencies of the therapeutic situation. The dose of the vaccine may also be varied to provide optimum preventative dose response depending upon the circumstances.<br>
The vaccines may be administered in a convenient manner such as by injection  (subcutaneous,  intravenous,  intramuscular,  etc.),  oral administration, inhalation, transdermal administration (such as topical cream or ointment, etc.), or suppository applications. Prevention of Apoptosis<br>
The present invention also includes a method of preventing the NSS of a retrovirus from exerting its apoptotic effects on a cell, apoptosis induced by a retroviral infection. Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of preventing or inhibiting apoptosis comprising administering a sufficient amount of antagonist to NSS to an animal in need thereof. The antagonist may be any substance that can inhibit the NSS gene or its protein product referred to herein as "NSS protein", preferably the antagonist is an antibody or antisense molecule.<br>
In one embodiment, the antagonist is a substance that inhibits the NSS protein such as an NSS protein specific antibody. Antibodies to NSS protein may be prepared using techniques known in the art such as those described by Kohler and Milstein, Nature 256, 495 (1975) and in U.S. Patent Nos. RE 32,011, 4,902,614, 4,543,439, and 4,411,993 which are incorporated herein by reference. (See also Monoclonal Antibodies, Hybridomas: A New Dimension in Biological Analyses, Plenum Press, Kennett, McKearn, and Bechtol (eds.), 1980, and Antibodies: A Laboratory Manual, Harlow and Lane (eds.), Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, 1988, which are,also incorporated herein by reference). Within the context of the present invention, antibodies are understood to include moho'clonal antibodies, polyclonal antibodies, antibody fragments (e.g., Fab, and F(ab)2) and recombinantly produced binding partners. Consequently, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting the effects of the<br>
NSS of a retrovirus comprising administering an effective amount of an antibody that inhibits the NSS protein.<br>
In addition to antibodies, other antagonists or ligands that bind to the NSS protein and inhibit its function may also be used.   NSS protein ligands may be identified by assaying a sample for peptides that bind to NSS protein.   Any assay system or testing method that detects protein-protein interactions may be used including co-immunoprecipitation,   crosslinking  and   co-purification   through   gradients   or chromatographic columns may be used.  Biological samples and commercially available libraries may be tested for NSS protein-binding peptides.   For example, labelled NSS protein or soluble NSS protein may be used to probe phage display libraries.   In addition, antibodies that bind to NSS protein may be used to isolate other peptides with NSS protein binding affinity.   For example, labelled antibodies may be used to probe phage display libraries or biological samples.    Additionally, a nucleic acid sequence encoding a NSS protein may be used to probe biological samples or libraries for nucleic acids that encode NSS protein-binding proteins or ligands.<br>
In another embodiment, the NSS antagonist is an antisense oligonucleotide that inhibits the expression of NSS protein. Antisense oligonucleotides that are complimentary to a nucleic acid sequence from an NSS protein gene can be used in the methods of the present invention to inhibit NSS protein.<br>
Consequently, the present invention provides a method of inhibiting the effects of the NSS of a retrovirus comprising administering an effective amount of an antisense oligonucleotide that is complimentary to a nucleic acid sequence from an NSS protein gene to an animal in need thereof. Preferably the retrovirus is HTV-1.<br>
The term antisense oligonucleotide as used herein means a nucleotide sequence that is complimentary to its target.<br>
The term "oligonucleotide" refers to an oligomer or polymer of nucleotide or nucleoside monomers consisting of naturally occurring bases, sugars, and intersugar (backbone) linkages. The term also includes modified or substituted oligomers comprising non-naturally occurring monomers or portions thereof, which function similarly. Such modified or substituted oligonucleotides may be preferred over naturally occurring forms because of properties such as enhanced cellular uptake, or increased stability in the presence of nucleases. The term also includes chimeric oligonucleotides which contain two or more chemically distinct regions. For example, chimeric oligonucleotides may contain at least one region of modified nucleotides that confer beneficial properties (e.g. increased n.uclease resistance, increased uptake into cells), or two or more oligonucleotides of the invention may be joined to form "a chimeric oligonucleotide.<br>
The antisense oligonucleotides of the present invention may be ribonucleic or deoxyribonucleic acids and may contain naturally occurring bases including<br>
adenine, guanine, cytosine, thymidine and uracil. The oligonucleotides may also contain modified bases such as xanthine, hypoxanthine, 2-aminoadenine, 6-methyl, 2-propyl and other alkyl adenines, 5-halo uracil, 5-halo cytosine, 6-aza uracil, 6-aza cytosine and 6-aza thymine, pseudo uracil, 4-thiouracil, 8-halo adenine, 8-aminoadenine, 8-thiol adenine, 8-thiolalkyl adenines, 8-hydroxyl adenine and other 8-substituted adenines, 8-halo guanines, 8-amino guanine, 8-thiol guanine, 8-thiolalkyl guanines, 8-hydroxyl guanine and other 8-substituted guanines, other aza and deaza uracils, thymidines, cytosines, adenines, or guanines, 5-trifluoromethyl uracil and 5-trifluoro cytosine.<br>
Other antisense oligonucleotides of the invention may contain modified phosphorous, oxygen heteroatoms in the phosphate backbone, short chain alkyl or cycloalkyl intersugar linkages or short chain heteroatomic or heterocyclic intersugar linkages. For example, the antisense oligonucleotides may contain ph osph orothioa tes, phosphotriesters, methyl phosphonates, and phosphorodithioates. In an embodiment of the invention there are phosphorothioate bonds links between the four to six 3'-terminus bases. In another embodiment phosphorothioate bonds link all the nucleotides.<br>
The antisense oligonucleotides of the invention may also comprise nucleotide analogs that may be better suited as therapeutic or experimental reagents. An example of an oligonucleotide analogue is a peptide nucleic acid (PNA) wherein the deoxyribose (or ribose) phosphate backbone in the DNA (or RNA), is replaced with a polyamide backbone which is similar to that found in peprides (P.E. Nielsen, et al Science 1991, 254,1497). PNA analogues have been shown to be resistant to degradation by enzymes and to have extended lives in vivo and in vitro. PNAs also bind stronger to a complimentary DNA sequence due to the lack of charge repulsion between the PNA strand and the DNA strand. Other oligonucleotides may contain nucleotides containing polymer backbones, cyclic backbones, or acyclic backbones. For example, the nucleotides may have morpholino backbone structures (U.S. Pat. Nol 5,034, 506). Oligonucleotides may also contain groups such as reporter groups, a group for improving the pharmacokinetic properties of an oligonucleotide, or a group for improving the pharmacodynamic properties of an antisense oligonucleotide. Antisense oligonucleotides may also have sugar mimetics.<br>
The antisense nucleic acid molecules may be constructed using chemical synthesis and enzymatic ligation reactions using procedures known in the art. The antisense nucleic acid molecules of the invention or a fragment thereof, may be chemically synthesized using naturally occurring nucleotides or variously modified nucleotides designed to increase the biological stability of the molecules or to increase the physical stability of the duplex formed with mRNA or the native gene e.g. phosphorothioate derivatives and acridine substituted nucleotides. The antisense<br>
sequences may be produced biologically using an expression vector introduced into cells in the form of a recombinant plasmid, phagemid or attenuated virus in which antisense sequences are produced under the control of a high efficiency regulatory region, the activity of which may be determined by the cell type into which the vector is introduced.<br>
Furthermore, the present invention also contemplates a method for assaying for a substance that inhibits the NSS activity of a retrovirus comprising reacting a retrovirus containing an NSS with a test substance, under conditions which permit inhibition of the NSS, assaying for the ability of the retrovirus to induce apoptosis, and comparing to the ability to induce apoptosis obtained in the absence of the test substance, to determine the effect of the substance on the NSS of the retrovirus. Apoptosis in Cancer Cells<br>
The present invention further includes a method of killing or destroying target cells, preferably cancer cells, comprising administering to the cell or cells, an effective amount of a recombinant virus, preferably VSV or any other carrier RNA virus, specific for the target cells, containing, preferably the NSS of HIV-1. Preferably the cells are in an animal in need thereof, most preferably in human. Cells which are infected or cancerous, express cell specific markers for which a complementary recognition site may be incorporated into a suitable vector into which the NSS of HTV-1 has been incorporated. This approach has been taken with vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) which has been engineered to incorporate the genes for CD4 and CXCR4 thereby targeting the modified VSV to infect HIV-1 infected cells (Schnell, M.J. et al. Cell 90: 849-857 (1997)). Accordingly, the present invention provides a method of killing target cells, such as cancer cells, comprising administering a recombinant virus containing NSS and a recognition site specific to the target cells, to an animal in need thereof. In an embodiment, the NSS of HIV-1 is incorporated into a modified VSV-like vector which has been targeted to a specific cancer cell type based on a particular cancer cell surface antigen thereby providing the VSV with the ability to induce apoptosis in the targeted cancer cells.<br>
The following non-limiting examples are illustrative of the present invention:<br>
Examples Example 1 Construction of recombinant baculoviruses<br>
Construction of recombinant baculoviruses expressing HTV-1 gp!20-NSS, gp120-MSS, and gp120-AS has been described previously by Li et al.-(Virology 204:266-278, 1994).<br>
Construction   of   recombinant   baculovirus   expressing   VSV, glycoprotein (G) was described previously by Bailey et al. (Virology 169:323-331, 1989).<br>
Construction of recombinant baculovirus expressing VSVlnd G protein with HIV-1 env signal sequence (VSV-G-NSS):<br>
To replace the signal sequence of VSV-G protein, the present inventors first constructed VSV-G-AS by PCR with two primers:<br>
primer #1: 5'-GGC GGATCC GGATCA ACG TTC ACC ATA GTT-3'<br>
(5' primer)	BamHI       SphI  +1VSV-G<br>
primer #2: complementary to C-terminus gene of VSV-G (3' primer)<br>
5'GGC GGATCC TTA CTT TCC AAG TCG-3' BamHI    stop codon<br>
The plasmid pwKl (which contains VSVInd full-length G gene, and provided kindly by Dr. Robert R. Wagner, University of Virginia, U.S.A.) was used as the template, and amplified with the Gene amp kit by 30 cycles of PCR in a Perkin-Elmer Cetus Thermocycler (the cycles were 94°C, 1 min; 45°C, 2 min; 72°C, 3 min) from 20 ng of pwKl as the template and 1.0 fiM of each primer.<br>
All primers had BamHI sites at their 5' terminus so that the amplified VSV-G-AS DMA fragment could be inserted into BamHI site of the plasmid, pBluescript SK VECTOR (Stratagene). The clone in which 5' terminus of VSV-G -AS toward T7 promoter was selected, and digested with SphI plus Xhol restriction enzymes. The vector is shown in Figure 5. Amplification of HIV-1 signal sequence:<br>
The HIV-1  signal sequence of env  gene was  amplified from pBluescript-gpl20-NSS by PCR with the following two primers:<br>
primer #1	5' - AAT ACG ACT CAC TAT - 3'<br>
(T7 primer)<br>
primer #2	5' - GGC GCATGC ACT ACA GAT CAT - 3'<br>
(complementary	SphI<br>
to c-terminus of HIV-1 signal sequence gene)<br>
This is illustrated in Figure 6. The amplified DNA fragment containing HIV-1 signal sequence was digested with Xhol plus SphI restriction enzymes, and inserted into Xhol and SphI digested vector, pBluescript VSV-G-As. The resulting plasmid is designated as pBSK VSV-G-NSS, and the construct was further confirmed by DNA sequencing. This is illustrated in Figure 7.<br>
The BamHI fragment of VSV-G-NSS was inserted into the BamHI site of-a baculovirus pAcYMl (Li et al. Virology 204:266-278, 1994), and recombinant baculovirus expressing VSV-G-NSS was generated by standard transfection method (Li et al. Virology 204: 266-278, 1994). Example 2 Microscopic examination of recombinant baculoviruses infected cells<br>
SF21 cells were infected with recombinant AcNPV at a m.o.i. of 5 PFU/cell and incubated at 27°C for 48 hrs. The infected cells were examined by phase-contrast microscope. The results are shown in Figure 1. (A) wild-type AcNPV-infected cells; (B) vAcgp!20-NS-infected cells (rgp!20 with the HIV-1 natural signal sequence showing cell lysis); (C) vAcgp!20-AS-infected cells; (rgp!20 without the signal sequence showing intact cells); (D) vAc8gp!20-MS-infected cells (rgpl20 with mellitin signal sequence showing intact cells); (E) vAcVSV-G-infected cells (VSV G protein showing intact cells); (F) vAcVSV-G-NS-infected cells. (VSV G protein with the HIV-1 env natural signal sequence showing cell lysis).<br>
The above results demonstrate that the HIV-1 env signal sequence kills cells rapidly. Example 3<br>
Effects of the HTV-1 env signal sequence on cell death Trypan blue assay:<br>
SF21 cells were infected with recombinant AcNPV at an m.o.i. of 5 PFU/Cell for 1 hr, and the inoculum was removed and incubated with the complete medium TNM-FH containing 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). At 24, 48, and 72 hrs after infection, cells were stained with trypan blue (GIBCO, BRL) for 5 min. and the cells were counted through the microscope and the percent of dead cells was determined by using the following formulae:<br>
	Dead cells ( stained)	x 100 = % Dead Cells<br>
viable cells (unstained) + Dead cells<br>
Lactate Dehydrogenase Release Assay CLDRA):<br>
The LDRA was performed according to the instructions of the manufacturer (Boehringer Mannheim Cytotoxicity Detection Kit).<br>
SF21 cells were infected with recombinant AcNPV at an m.o.i. of 5 PFU/cell for 1 hr. and the inoculum was removed and incubated with complete medium at 27°C, culture medium was collected at regular intervals of 12 hr. and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 1 min. The culture supernatant was diluted 10 fold and 100_ µl of the supernatant was incubated with 100 µl of reaction mixture (cytotoxicity detection kit) for 30 min at room temperature. The absorbance of samples was measured at 490 run by<br>
quantitating the formazen dye formed by using a microplate (ELISA) reader (Bio-Rad 550).<br>
The results of the trypan blue and lactate dehydrogenase release assays are illustrated in Figure 2A and 2B, respectively. Figure 2A; percentage of cells permeablized by trypan blue (dead cells) after expressing rgp!20 or VSV-G proteins with different signal sequences. Figure 2B; Lactate dehydrogenese (LDH) release assay. (Boehnnger Mannheim's Cytotoxicity Detection Kit). The amounts of LDH released from SF21 cells infected with recombinant viruses expressing rgp!20 or VSV-G with different signal sequences were measured by quantitating the formazan dye formed in ELISA plates read at 490 nm.<br>
In conclusion rgp!20 and VSV-G with the HTV-1 env natural signal sequence kill cells much faster.   Cells survive much longer without the HIV-1 env natural signal sequence or with mellitin signal sequence. The HIV-1 env natural signal sequence is responsible for rapid cell death. Example 4<br>
Examination of apoptosis: Total DNA extraction method:<br>
SF21 cells (3 x 106) were infected with recombinant AcNPV at an m.o.i.<br>
of 5 PFU/cell for 1 hr. The inoculum was removed and incubated with complete medium<br>
at 27°C for 48 hr. Cells were pelleted at 2500 rpm for 10 min and extracted with TSE (10<br>
mM Tris, pH 8.0, ImM EDTA, 1% SDS, to which proteinase K to a final concentration of<br>
70 µg/ml was added). Then, samples were incubated for 2 hr at 37°C, and at the end of<br>
incubation NaCl was added to a final concentration of 1M and then samples were<br>
incubated at 4°C overnight.  The DNA was extracted with phenohchloroform (1:1) and<br>
with chloroform. Finally ethanol (100%) was added to precipitate the DNA (15 min at<br>
80°C) and the DNA precipitate was pelleted by micro-centrifugation at 12,000 rpm for<br>
15 min. The DNA pellet was washed once with 70% ethanol. resuspended in TE (10 mM<br>
Tris, pH 8.0, ImM EDTA) with RNase A (50 µg/ml), electrophoresed on 1.2% agarose gel<br>
and stained with ethiolium bromide. (N. Chejanovsky and E. Gershburg, Virology 209:<br>
519-525, 1995).  The results are illustrated in Figure 3.  Total cellular DNA (A) or low<br>
molecular weight DNA (B) was extracted at 48 hr. post infection and analyzed by 1.2%<br>
agarose gel electrophoresis in the presence of ethiolium bromide.    Lanes M, DNA<br>
marker; Lanes WT, wild-type AcNPV-infected cells; Lanes AS-infected cells (rgp120<br>
without the signal sequence); Lane NSS, vAcgp!20-NS-infected cells (rgp120 with the<br>
HIV-1 env natural signal sequence); Lanes MSS, vAcgp!20-MS-infected cells (rgp120<br>
with mellitin signal sequence).   The above results demonstrate that the HIV-1 env<br>
natural signal sequence induces apoptosis.<br>
Extraction of Fragmented DNA:<br>
SF21 cells were infected with vAcVSV-G (VSV-G) or vAcVSV-G-NSS (VSV-G-NSS) at a m.o.i. of 5 PFU/cell and incubated at 27°C for 48 hours. At 48 hr. postinfection, SF21 cells (3 x 106) were pelleted at 2500 rpm for 5 mm and lysed in solution containing l0mM Tris HC1 (pH 8,0), 10 mM EDTA, and 0.5% Triton X-100, and centrifuged at 12,000 rpm for 25 min in an Eppendorf microcentrifuge to pellet chromosome DNA. The supernatant was digested with 0.1 mg of RNaseA per ml at 37°C for 1 hr and then for 2 hr with 1 mg proteinase K per ml at 50°C in the presence of 1% SDS, extracted with phenol and chloroform, precipitated with cold ethanol. The precipitate was resuspended in TE and subjected to electrophoresis on 11.5% agarose gel containing 5|ig of ethidium bromide per ml. DNA was visualized by UV transillumination. (Rosario Leopardi and Bernard Roizman, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 93:9583-9587, 1996).<br>
The results are shown in Figure 3, Panel B and Figure 4, Panel B. Example 5<br>
Construction of Recombinant HIV-1 containing partial vpu and nef deletion and NSS substitution<br>
1.   Construction of plasmid pNL4-3 containing the NSS substitution (with MSS, IL-3 or any other signal sequences) and vpu deletion.<br>
An infectious HTV-1 proviral DNA clone, pNL4-3 (provided by Dr. Malcolm Martin through the AIDS Research and Reference Reagent program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH, Adachi et al, J. Virol. 59:284-291, 1986), contains two unique restriction enzyme sites; EcoRI (position 5744) and BamHI (position 8466). The env gene encoding region starts from position 6221 and ends at position 8785. To replace the natural signal sequence of HIV-1 env with mellitin, IL-3 or any other secretory protein signal sequences, the EcoRI-BamHI fragment of pNL4-3, is isolated from agarose gel, and subcloned into the EcoRI - BamHI site of pBluescript SK vector as illustrated in Figure 8. From this product, four primers are designed as follows: primer #1 (Forward): S'-GGCGAATTC TGCAACAAC TGC TG -3'<br>
EcoRI<br>
primer #2 (Reverse):<br>
5'-GGCCTGCAGTCATTAGGC ACT GTC TTC TGC TCTTTC-3' PstI     Stop codons<br>
primer #3 (Forward):<br>
5'-GGC CTG CAG CCA TGG ACA GAA AAA TTG TTG GTC ACA GTC-3'<br>
PstI        Ncol primer #4 (Reverse):<br>
5' - GGC  GGATCC  GTT CAC  TAA TCG   AAT GG - 3' BamHI<br>
The pBSK-env; as template plus primers #1 and #2 are used and PCR is performed to amplify the left portion of env region, 477bp fragment. Similarly, primers #3 and #4 are employed to amplify the right portion of env, 2245 bp. The EcoRI - Psti PCR product (477bp fragment) was digested with EcoRI + Psti whereas the Pstl-BamHI PCR product (2245bp fragment) was cut with Pstl + BamHI. Then, the Pstl-BamHI digested 2245bp fragment was cloned into the Pstl + BamHI sites of pBSK vector as<br>
shown in Figure 9.<br>
Following this, the pBSK-2245 was digested with EcoRI + Pstl and<br>
ligated with the EcoRI + Psti digested PCR products  (445bp fragment) resulting in the<br>
plasmid pBSK-enu-AS, as shown in Figure 10.<br>
The plasmid pBSK-env-AS was digested with Psti + Ncol  and then<br>
ligated with the synthetic oligonucleotide encoding MSS, IL-3 signal sequences or any<br>
other desired signal sequences.  This synthetic oligonucleotide contains a Psti site at 5'<br>
end and a Ncol site at 3' end.   Before ligation into the vector, these double strand<br>
oligonucleotides were first digested with Psti + Ncol.<br>

The resulting recombinant plasmid is shown in Figure 11. After sequencing to verify the correct modification, the plasmid was digested with EcoRI + BamHI to isolate the EcoRI - BamHI fragment, which was<br>
recloned   into the EcoRI-BamHI sites of  pNL4-3 proviral DNA vector.   The resulting plasmid is designated pHIV-1-MSS (or pHIV-l-IL3SS).).<br>
In addition, during the above construction, the NSS is substituted with not only MSS or 11-3 signal sequence, but also created partial vpu gene deletion. The vpu encodes 82aa and its 3' end overlaps with the signal sequence of HTV-1 env gene, about 28aa.   However, it is in a different reading frame (-1 reading frame).     Studies have shown that the deletion of vpu or nef genes did not alter the virus replication in either chimpanzee PBMCs, human PBMCs, or in the B/T cell hybrid line CEMxl74 Games et al, AIDS  Res.   Human  Retrovirus  10:343-350,   1994).     Therefore,  during  the  PCR amplification of 455 bp-fragment of the left portion of env with primers #1 and #2, two stop codons were added just in front of the start codon of env genes which results in the deletion of 28aa of vpu (see primer #2). 2. Construction of plasmid containing nef deletion.<br>
The nef gene coding sequence starts from position 8787 and ends at position 9407 in pNL4-3 proviral DNA clone. There are also two unique restriction enzyme sites; BamHI site at position 8466 in env gene and Xhol site at position 8887 in nef gene. To make the nef gene deletion, the plasmid HTV-1 MSS (or IL-3SS) was digested with BamHI and Xhol. The resulting 421 bp of BamHI-XhoI fragment was isolated and subcloned into the Bam HI-XhoI sites of pBSK vector as shown in Figure 12. Two primers were designed:<br>
Primer #5:	BamHI<br>
(Forward)	5' - GGC   GGATCC   TTA GCA CTT ATC TGG-3'<br>
XhoT<br>
Primer #6: 5' - GCC CTC GAG ICAHA ATA CTG CTC CCA CCC-3'<br>
Stop codons<br>
The nef gene encodes 260 aa according to the present design. Two stop codons were inserted at the Xhol site which results in the nef only coding 33 aa. After PCR amplification and BamHI + Xhol digestion, this 421 bp of PCR DNA fragment was cloned back into the BamHI-XhoI pHIV-1-MSS (or IL-3SS) vector. The resulting recombinant plasmid contains the NSS substitution and partial vpu and nef deletion, which is used for the vaccine test.<br>
