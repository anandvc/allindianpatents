TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing an additive for a disazo pigment and particularly a mixture of six disazo compounds produced by the said process. The invention also relates to a process for producing a pigment composition by mixing a disazo pigment with the additive so produced.<br>
This application is based on Patent Application No. Hei 10-127335, filed in Japan, the content of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
As examples of conventional methods for improving transparency and flow ability of printing inks containing disazo pigments, Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No, Sho 45-11026 discloses a method for mixing sulfonic acid compounds into disazo pigments; Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No. Sho, 55-49087 discloses a method for using a disazo pigment formed by using a mixture of non-polar coupling components and polar coupling components having carboxyl groups and/or sulfo groups as coupling components; and Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho 63-72762 and Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho 63-l 78169 respectively disclose a method of using a disazo pigment composition containing asymmetric disazo compounds which are formed from polar coupling components and non-polar coupling components, respectively.<br><br><br>
3 <br><br>
Among these disclosures, it is known that a disazo pigment composition disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho 63-178169 is more effective in improving the flow ability of printing inks.<br>
In addition, Japanese Patent Application, First Publication, No. Hei 4-275373 discloses a rosin surface-treated pigment, wherein a disazo compound mixture is formed by means of reacting 2 to 40 mol% of acetoacetic acid m-xylidide, 97.9 to 60 mol% of acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, and 0.1 to 10 mol% of 2-acetoacetylamino benzoic acid, as the coupler components, with a tetrazo compound of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, as the tetrazo component.<br>
In the printing industry, from the viewpoint of increased productivity, the printing speed is undergoing remarkable improvements. Currently, a printing machine capable of printing at a speed of 4 meter per second enjoys widespread use as the industry standard; however, a printing machine capable of printing 15 meter per second has been already developed. In accordance with this increasing printing speed, flow abilities greater than those obtained to date are highly desired for the printing inks.<br>
However, there exist limits with regard to the conventional technology for improving the flow ability of the printing ink obtained using a disazo pigment composition disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Sho. 63-178169.<br>
In addition, in the same manner, the flow ability of the printing ink, obtained using a rosin-treated disazo pigment disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, First Publication No. Hei 4-275373, are likewise inadequate.<br><br><br>

12<br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION The additive for a disazo pigment according to the present invention contains . at least the aforementioned compounds represented by Formulae (I), (IV), and (V).<br>
These   three   components,   which   respectively   comprise   asymmetric   chemical<br>
v<br>
structures, are essential components contributing to an improvement of the flow ability of a printing ink containing the pigment.<br>
The composition comprising a. disazo compound mixture according to the present invention, can be used as an additive for a disazo pigment, and the aforementioned three components consisting of, for example, acetoacetic acid m-xylidide, acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, and 2-acetoacetylamino benzoic acid can be used as coupler components. In this manner, the composition is able contain the compounds represented by the above Formulae (I), (TV), and (V). Moreover, the mixing ratio of the three components is not particularly limited, however, a ratio of 39 - 47 mol% of acetoacetic acid m-xylidide to 11 - 19 mol% of acetoacetic acid o-toluidide to 38 - 46 mol% of 2-acetoacetylamino benzoic acid is preferred.<br>
On the other hand, a disazo compound mixture, which is used to adjust the<br>
'!<br><br><br>
13<br>
disazo pigment composition disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, First Publication, No. Sho. 63-178169, is characterized in comprising two components consisting of acetoacetic acid m-xylidide and 2-acetoacetylamino benzoic acid, as coupler components, or alternatively, acetoacetic acid o-toluidide and 2-acetoacetylamino benzoic acid, as coupler components. Thus, even if the aforementioned components are synthesized independently, and then mixed together to prepare an additive for a disazo pigment, a compound represented by Formula (I) is not contained therein. On the contrary, the additive for a pigment according to the present invention contains a compound represented by the above Formula (I).<br>
The composition, comprising a disazo compound mixture according to the present invention, possesses fine crystal particles (grains) with little aggregative property between these crystal particles. Thus, it is easy to disperse the composition at the primary particle level, in the process of producing a lithographic ink. Accordingly, the composition comprising a disazo compound mixture can be adsorbed uniformly and firmly to the surface of a disazo pigment, thereby providing the resultant printing ink with a superior flow ability, in response to a high-speed printing machine.<br>
On the other hand, the disazo compound mixture, which is used to adjust the disazo pigment composition, disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, First Publication, No. Sho. 63-178169, possesses large crystal particles, with a large amount of aggregative property between these crystal particles. Thus, it is difficult to disperse this disazo compound mixture at the primary particle level, in the process of producing a lithographic ink. Accordingly, the disazo compound mixture cannot be adsorbed uniformly and firmly to the surface of a disazo pigment, and thus is not capable of producing a printing ink with a superior flow ability, in response to a highspeed printing machine.<br>
12<br><br><br>
14<br><br>
The additive for a disazo pigment according to the present invention can be obtained by means of reacting acetoacetic acid.m-xylidide, acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, and 2-acetoacetylamino benzoic acid, as coupler components, with a tetrazo component, wherein a greater amount of the disazo compound represented by the aforementioned formula (V) is contained than the disazo compound represented by the aforementioned formula (IV). Concretely, said additive can be formed by means of reacting 39 to 47 mol% of acetoacetic acid m-xylidide, 11 to 19 mol% of acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, 38 to 46 mol% of 2-acetoacetylamino benzoic acid, as coupler components, with a tetrazo compound of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, as a tetrazo component. The composition comprising the disazo compound mixture can be manufactured, for example, according 1o the following manufacturing method.<br>
(1) A tetrazo compound is first prepared according to a conventional method using<br>
3,3'-dichlorobenzidine (referred to as "tetrazo component").<br>
(2) An   aqueous   solution   or   dispersion   comprising   38   to   46   mol%   of   2-<br>
acetoacetylamino benzoic acid is then added to the tetrazo component (referred to<br>
as "tetrazo reactant").<br>
(3) A mixed coupler component comprising 39 to 47 mol% of acetoacetic acid m-<br>
xylidide and  11  to  19 mol% of acetoacetic acid o-toluidide is then prepared<br>
(referred to as "mixed coupler component").<br>
(4) The coupling reaction between the tetrazo reactant and the mixed coupler<br>
component  is  then  carried  out  in  a  conventional  manner  under  an  acidic<br>
environment of acetic acid without particular limitations.   The conditions at this<br>
time include a pH of 3 to 6, a temperature of 5 to 30°C, and a time of period of 30<br>
to 180 minutes (referred to as "reaction slurry"),<br>
(5) The reaction slurry is subsequently stirred while heating at 70 to 110°C for 0.5 to 4<br>
13<br><br><br>
15 <br><br>
hours, preferably at 90°C for 2 hours. (6) The resultant slurry is then filtered, washed with water, dried, and ground.<br>
In the aforementioned (1) to (6), the term "mol%" indicates the proportional content of the 3-type coupler component formed from 2-acetoacetylamino benzoic acid, acetoacetic acid m-xylidide, and acetoacetic acid o-toluidide.<br>
The disazo compound mixture obtained in this manner is a mixture comprising six disazo compounds possessing the respective chemical structures shown below.<br><br><br><br>
16<br><br>
1<br><br><br>
17<br><br>
The six-type disazo compound may also be obtained by means of mixing the aforementioned disazo compounds separately; however, the crystal particles of a mixture comprising six types of disazo compounds formed by means of reacting 39 to 47 mol% of acetoacetic acid m-xylidide, 11 to 19 mol% of acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, and 38 to 46 mol% of 2-acetoacetylamino benzoic acid, as the coupler components, with a tetrazo compound of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, as the tetrazo component, are finer and possess a low aggregative property between particles, such that at the time of manufacturing the lithographic ink, it is possible to easily disperse the mixture, all the way down to the level of the primary particles.<br>
This process is preferable, since the formation of primary particles from the mixture comprising six types of disazo compounds produces the effects of facilitating a sharp particle size distribution of the crystal particles, as well as a low aggregative property between crystal particles. In contrast, the crystal primary particles obtained from only a single type of disazo compound results in a different grain diameter for each of the six types of disazo compounds, such that the aforementioned superior effects are not obtained.<br>
Rather than using the composition formed from a mixture, comprising six<br>
15<br><br><br>
18<br><br>
types of disazo compounds formed by means of reacting 39 to 47 mol% of acetoacetic acid m-xylidide, 11 to 19 mol% of acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, and 38 to 46 mol% of 2-acetoacetylamino benzoic acid, as the coupler components, with a tetrazo compound of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, as the tetrazo component, as the pigment composition itself, it is preferable to use the aforementioned composition as a pigment composition after adding a separately prepared disazo pigment.<br>
It is preferable that the aforementioned mixture of the six types of disazo compounds is not treated with a rosin.<br>
Any conventionally used compound may be employed as the disazo pigment used in the present invention.<br>
Concrete examples of the aforementioned include (1) C. I. Pigment Yellow 13, 14, 55 and 12; (2) a mixture of two or more types of the pigments described in (1); (3) a mixed crystal of a disazo pigment disclosed in Japanese Patent Application, Second Publication No. Sho 48-26373, e.g., a mixed crystal of a disazo pigment formed by means of reacting a mixed coupler component, comprising acetoacetic acid m-xylidide and acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, with a tetrazo compound of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, as the coupler components; and (4) a disazo pigment formed from a disazo compound represented by the aforementioned Formula (I).<br>
As the disazo pigment for use in the present invention, from the major perspective of improving the flow ability, it is preferable to have at least one disazo pigment selected from the group consisting of C.I. Pigment Yellow 13, C.I. Pigment Yellow 14, and a disazo compound represented by the aforementioned Formula (I). This disazo pigment may be formed from a mixture of two or more types of disazo pigments each respectively comprising a single type of disazo compound; however, mixed crystals of the aforementioned are particularly preferred.<br>
16<br><br><br>
19<br><br>
The disazo pigment described concretely above is a disazo pigment formed by means of reacting at least one type of coupler component selected from the group consisting of acetoacetic acid m-xylidide, acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, acetoacetic acid p-toluidide, and acetoacetic acid anilide, with a tetrazo component comprising a tetrazo compound of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine.<br>
Moreover, the disazo pigment formed by means of reacting a mixed coupler component comprising acetoacetic acid m-xylidide and acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, with a tetrazo component, comprising a tetrazo compound of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, is a disazo pigment containing all of the aforementioned disazo compounds of C.I. Pigment Yellow 13, C.I. Pigment Yellow 14, and a disazo compound represented by the aforementioned Formula (I).<br>
Another preferred disazo pigment is one that includes a disazo compound represented by the aforementioned Formula (III), as an essential component. This is a disazo pigment formed by means of reacting acetoacetic acid m-xylidide, as an essential coupler component, with the a tetrazo compound of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, as the tetrazo component.<br>
From the standpoint of significantly improving the flow ability, and moreover, when used in a lithographic ink, achieving a high transparency and producing a clear printed material, a preferred composition includes a composition that is formed by means of reacting a mixed coupler component, comprising 10 to 90 mol% of acetoacetic acid m-xylidide and 10 to 90 mol% of acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, as the coupler components, as this results in maximal improvement in the flow ability; while a composition that is formed by means of reacting a mixed coupler component, comprising 60 to 80 mol% of acetoacetic acid m-xylidide and 20 to 40 mol% of acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, as the coupler components, is particularly preferred, as<br>
17<br><br><br>
20<br><br>
this results in the highest transparency and clearest printed material when used in a lithographic ink.<br>
The disazo pigment for use in the present invention can be manufactured, for example, according to the following manufacturing method.<br>
(1) A tetrazo compound is first prepared according to a conventional method using<br>
3,3'-dichlorobenzidine (referred to as "tetrazo component").<br>
(2) A coupler component selected from the group consisting of acetoacetic acid m-<br>
xylidide, acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, acetoacetic acid p-toluidide, and acetoacetic<br>
acid anilide is then prepared (referred to as "coupler component").<br>
(3) The coupling reaction between the tetrazo reactant and the coupler component is<br>
then carried out in a conventional manner under the acidic environment of acetic<br>
acid without particular limitations.   The conditions at this time include a pH of 3<br>
to 6, a temperature of 5 to 30°C, and a time of period of 30 to 180 minutes<br>
(referred to as "reaction slurry").<br>
(4) The reaction slurry is subsequently stirred while heating at 60 to 110°C for 0.2 to<br>
120 minutes, preferably at 80°C for 90 minutes.<br>
(5) The resultant slurry is then filtered, washed with water, dried, and ground.<br>
For the purpose of improving the dispersibility of the disazo pigment, it is possible to carry out surface treatment using any of the following: a nonionic surface active agent, a cationic surface active agent, an anionic surface active agent, a resin, and rosin.<br>
Among the aforementioned, surface treatment using rosin is preferred from the standpoint of significantly improving the dispersibility, and additionally improving the transparency thereof.<br>
18<br><br><br>
21 <br><br>
Surface treatment processes using rosin include, for example, the following method.<br>
(1) A reaction slurry is initially adjusted to a basic pH.<br>
(2) A rosin solution dissolved in an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide is then<br>
added thereto.<br>
(3) The reaction mixture is stirred while heating at 60 to 100°C for 0.2 to 120<br>
minutes, preferably at 90°C for 90 minutes.<br>
(4) Hydrochloric acid is then added dropwise thereto to bring about precipitation of<br>
the rosin; or alternatively an inorganic salt, e.g., calcium chloride, aluminum<br>
sulfate, aluminum chloride, etc. Is added to convert the rosin into a nonsoluble<br>
salt.<br>
(5) The resultant mixture is then filtered, washed with water, dried, and ground.<br>
As a method for manufacturing the pigment composition containing a disazo pigment and composition comprising the aforementioned disazo compound mixture, according to the present invention, the following two methods can be mentioned.<br>
(1) A method in which an aqueous suspension, containing a composition comprising<br>
the aforementioned disazo compound mixture, is added to an aqueous suspension,<br>
containing a disazo pigment.<br>
(2) A  method   in  which  a  composition,   comprising  the  aforementioned   disazo<br>
compound mixture in a powder form after grinding, is added to a disazo pigment,<br>
which has also been ground into powder form.<br>
In the present invention, there are cases of only small improvement in the flow ability, when the composition, comprising the aforementioned disazo compound mixture, is coated with rosin. Thus, the following methods are recommended as methods for manufacturing a rosin-treated disazo pigment and a pigment composition<br>
19<br><br><br>
22<br><br>
containing a disazo compound mixture.<br>
(1) A method in which, after preparing a rosin-treated disazo pigment by means of<br>
either precipitation of rosin using an acid or conversion of rosin to a nonsoluble<br>
salt,   an   aqueous   suspension,   containing   a   composition   comprising   the<br>
aforementioned disazo compound mixture, is added to an aqueous suspension,<br>
containing a rosin-treated disazo pigment.<br>
(2) A method in  which a composition,  comprising  the  aforementioned  disazo<br>
compound mixture in a powdered form, is added to a disazo pigment, which has<br>
also been ground into powder form.<br>
In other words, as a pigment composition according to the present invention, one comprising a rosin-treated disazo pigment, and a rosin-untreated composition comprising a disazo compound mixture, formed by means of reacting 39 to 47 mol% of acetoacetic acid m-xylidide, 11 to 19 mol% of acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, and 38 to 46 mol% of 2-acetoacetylamino benzoic acid, as the coupler components, with a tetrazo compound of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, as the tetrazo component, is preferred.<br>
This pigment composition according to the present invention provides a flow ability which is superior to that of a conventional disazo pigment used "as it is", i.e., using a pigment composition prepared by treating the surface of a disazo compound mixture with a rosin as the "disazo pigment" itself, the disazo compound being formed by means of reacting 2 to 40 mol% of acetoacetic acid m-xylidide, 97.9 to 60 mol% of acetoacetic acid o-toluidide, and 0.1 to 10 mol% of 2-acetoacetylamino benzoic acid, as the coupler components, with a tetrazo compound of 3,3'-dichlorobenzidine, as the tetrazo component.<br>
In the present  invention,  the proportional  content  of the disazo pigment<br>
20<br><br><br>
23<br>
comprises 85 to 99% by weight of the disazo pigment and 1 to 15% by weight of the composition formed from the aforementioned disazo compound mixture, and preferably 93 to 97% by weight of the disazo pigment and 3 to 7% by weight of the composition formed from the aforementioned disazo compound mixture. In this manner, regarding the pigment composition prepared, the improvement in the flow ability decreases as the proportional content of the composition formed from the aforementioned disazo compound mixture is decreased; while the tinting strength of the pigment decreases as the proportional content of the composition formed from the aforementioned disazo compound mixture is increased.<br>

Examples of the aforementioned varnish include a mixture comprising a resin. such as a rosin-modified phenol resin, petroleum resin, alkyd resin, or a drying oil-modified resin of the aforementioned resins: and when necessary, plant oils such as linseed oil, tung oil, soybean oil, and the like; and a solvent, such as n-paraffin, isoparaffm, aromatic, naphthene, (-olefin, and the like.    The mixing proportional<br>
21<br><br><br>
24<br><br>
weight of the aforementioned comprises a resin : plant oil : solvent ratio = 20-50 parts : 0 - 30 parts : 10-60 parts. In addition, a varnish containing an acrylic acid ester can also be mentioned.<br>
