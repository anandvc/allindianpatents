The Patents Rules, 2003 COMPLETE SPECIFICATION <br>
(See Section 10, and rule 13)<br>
1.   TITLE OF INVENTION<br>
NOVEL COMPOUNDS HAVING AN ANTIBACTERIAL ACTIVITY<br>
2.   APPLICANT(S)<br>
a)	Name        : MORPHOCHEM AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT  FUR<br>
KOMBINATORISCHE CHEMIE<br>
b)	Nationality : GERMAN Company<br>
c)	Address     : GMUNDER STR. 37-37A,<br>

3.   PREAMBLE TO THE DESCRIPTION<br>
The following specification particularly describes t invention and the manner in which it is to be performed :<br><br>
Resistance to the antibiotics used currently has increased appreciably in many countries of the world in recent years and in some cases has assumed alarming proportions. The main problem is that those pathogens exhibit not just a single resistance but, as a rule, multiple resistance. This is true especially for some gram-positive pathogen groups, such as staphylococci, pneumococci and enterococci (S. Ewig et al, Antibiotika-Resistenz bei Erregern ambulant erworbener Atemwegsinfektionen (Antibiotic resistance in pathogens of outpatient-acquired respiratory tract infections), Chemother. J. 2002, 11, 12-26; F. Tenover, Development and spread of bacterial resistance to antimicrobial agents: an overview, Clin. Infect. Dis. 2001 Sep 15, 33 Suppl. 3, 108-115).<br>
A long-feared development has recently occurred: In the USA, the first strain of Staphylococcus aureus has been described that is not only resistant to methicillin but also highly resistant to vancomycin (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Staphylococcus aureus resistant to vancomycin - United States, 2002, MMWR 2002, 51, 565-567). In addition to hygiene measures in hospitals, therefore, increased efforts are also required to find new antibiotics that as far as possible have a novel structure and a novel mechanism of action so as to be effective against those problem bacteria.<br>
The present invention describes new kinds of compounds having anti-bacterial activity. These compounds are, amongst others, of interest as inhibitors of Topoisomerase IV (Topo IV) as well as of DNA gyrase.<br>
