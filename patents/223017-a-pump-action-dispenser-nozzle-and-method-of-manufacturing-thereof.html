				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a pump action dispenser nozzle and method of manufacturing thereof.<br>
Pump action dispenser nozzles are commonly used to provide a means by which fluids, particularly viscous fluids such as soaps, shampoos, creams etc., can be dispensed from a non-pressurised container or other fluid source in response to the operation of the nozzle device by an operator.<br>
Conventional pump-action nozzle devices are adapted to be fitted to an outlet opening of a container and comprise an internal chamber which is compressed when  an  actuator of the nozzle device  is   operated.     The compression of the internal chamber results in an increase in pressure which forces liquid present in the chamber to be dispensed through the outlet of the device. Once the desired volume of liquid has been dispensed, or the chamber has been compressed to its fullest extent, the actuator is then released by the operator and the chamber is allowed to re-expand.   The re-expansion of the chamber causes the internal pressure within the chamber to reduce, which in turn causes more liquid to be drawn into the chamber from the associated container through an inlet.   One-way valves are provided at the inlet and the outlet to ensure that fluid can only be expelled from the internal chamber through the outlet and drawn into the chamber through the inlet.<br>
The actuator is typically a portion of the body of the nozzle device that can be depressed and subsequently released by an operator (generally known as pump nozzle devices), or a trigger that an operator can pull and then subsequently release (generally known as trigger-actuated nozzle devices), to cause the chamber to be compressed and then re-expanded respectively.<br><br><br>
There are a number of drawbacks associated with conventional pumpaction<br>
nozzle devices. Firstly, many of the conventional devices tend to be<br>
extremely complex in design and typically comprise numerous different<br>
component parts (usually between 8 and 10 individual components in pump<br>
nozzle devices and between 10 and 14 individual components in triggeractuated<br>
nozzle devices). As a consequence, these devices can be costly to<br>
manufacture due to the amount of material required to form the individual<br>
components and the assembly processes involved. Secondly, many of the<br>
conventional devices tend to be bulky (which again increases the raw material<br>
costs) and a proportion of this bulk is invariably disposed inside the container<br>
to which the device is attached. This creates a drawback in that the nozzle<br>
device takes up a proportion of the internal volume of the container, which can<br>
be a particular problem in small containers where the available space inside the<br>
container is limited. Finally, the size of the pump-action device is also dictated<br>
to certain extent by the size of the container to which it is attached. Thus, the<br>
size of the device is usually restricted in small containers, and especially small<br>
containers with narrow necks, and this limits the amount of pressure that can be<br>
generated by the device as well as the volume of fluid that can be dispensed,<br>
and, for this reason, can be detrimental to the performance of the device.<br>
Therefore, there is a desire for a pump-action nozzle device which is:<br>
(i) simpler in design;<br>
(ii) utilises less components; and<br>
(iii) is easy to operate and functions effectively.<br>
Examples of dispenser nozzles of simpler construction are disclosed in<br>
EP 0 442 858 A2, EP 0 649 684 and US 3,820,689. The dispenser nozzles<br>
disclosed in these publications are essentially formed from two separate<br>
component parts that are fitted together to define an internal chamber having an<br>
inlet equipped with an inlet valve and an outlet equipped with an outlet valve.<br>
One of the parts is a base formed from a rigid material, whereas the other part is<br>
a resiliently defonnable portion that is fitted to the upper surface of the base<br>
and, together with the base, defines the internal chamber, as well as forming the<br>
inlet and outlet valve members. The resiliently defonnable portion provides a<br>
means by which the internal chamber can be compressed to dispense fluid<br>
present therein.<br>
Although the provision of a resiliently defonnable upper part fixed to a<br>
rigid base provides some advantages, such as the provision of a soft touch feel<br>
and the ease with which it can be deformed to facilitate the compression of the<br>
chamber, there are some disadvantages, namely:<br>
(i) it is difficult to hold the two parts firmly together due to the<br>
different properties of the two materials;<br>
(ii) the pump-action differs substantially from conventional pump<br>
dispensers available on the market (in particular, the pump<br>
action is not the usual on/off action associated with a<br>
conventional pump dispensers); and<br>
(iii) the two parts need to be assembled together to form the<br>
assembled dispenser nozzle.<br>
The present invention provides a solution to at least some of the<br>
problems associated with known dispenser nozzles by providing, in a first<br>
aspect, a pump-action dispenser nozzle adapted to enable fluid stored in a fluid<br>
source to be dispensed through said nozzle during use, said nozzle having a<br>
body which defines an internal chamber having an inlet through which fluid<br>
may be drawn into said chamber and an outlet through which fluid present in<br>
the chamber may be expelled from the nozzle, said inlet comprising an inlet<br>
valve adapted to only permit fluid to flow into the chamber through the inlet<br>
when the pressure within the chamber falls below the pressure within the fluid<br>
source by at least a minimum threshold amount and said outlet comprising an<br>
outlet valve configured to only permit fluid to flow out of the chamber and be<br>
expelled from the nozzle when the pressure therein exceeds the external<br>
pressure at the outlet by at least a minimum threshold amount, and wherein at<br>
least a portion of the body which defines said chamber is configured to:<br>
(i) resiliently deform from an initial resiliently biased configuration to a<br>
distended or deformed configuration in response to the application of a<br>
pressure, whereby the volume of said chamber defined by said portion of the<br>
body is reduced as said portion of the body is deformed from said initial<br>
configuration to said distended or deformed configuration, said reduction in<br>
volume causing the pressure within the chamber to increase and fluid to be<br>
ejected through the outlet valve; and<br>
(ii) subsequently return to its initial resiliently biased configuration<br>
when the applied pressure is removed, thereby causing the volume of the<br>
chamber to increase and the pressure therein to fall such that fluid is drawn into<br>
the chamber through the inlet valve;<br>
characterised in that the body of the device is formed entirely from a<br>
rigid material, a flexible material or as a bi-injection moulding.<br>
By "bi-injection moulding" we mean that the body of the nozzle device<br>
is formed from two parts, a first of said parts being moulded in an initial<br>
moulding step together with a framework or base for a second of said parts<br>
from a first material, and a second material, which may be the same or different<br>
to said first material is moulded onto said base to complete the body of the<br>
device. Bi-injection mouldings are well known in the art.<br>
The term "fluid" is used herein to refer to any material capable of flow.<br>
Therefore, although the fluids pumped through the dispenser nozzle during use<br>
will usually be various liquids, in some cases the fluid may be a gas or a<br>
mixture of gasses, such as air. As an example, a small pump may be formed in<br>
the side of a food packaging or a bag to provide a means by which air can be<br>
pumped out.<br>
The dispenser nozzle devices of the present invention solve the<br>
aforementioned problems associated with many conventional pump-action<br>
dispenser nozzles by providing a device which is extremely simple in design<br>
and which will typically comprise no more than six separate component parts<br>
that are fitted together to form the assembled nozzle device. In preferred<br>
embodiments the device will comprise no more than three component parts or,<br>
more preferably, two separate component parts or, even more preferably, the<br>
device is formed from a single, integrally formed component. By "separate<br>
component parts" we mean that the parts are not linked in. any way, i.e. they are<br>
not integrally formed with one another (but each separate component part may<br>
comprise one or more integral parts or portions).<br>
In the dispenser nozzle of the present invention, the key to reducing the<br>
number of components lies in the discovery that all the necessary components<br>
can be integrally formed within the body of the device, even when it is prepared<br>
entirely from a rigid or a flexible material. For instance, the chamber, inlet,<br>
inlet valve, outlet, and outlet valve can all be defined by the body, thereby<br>
reducing the need to include separate components with all the consequential<br>
increases in component and assembly costs.<br>
The rigid and flexible material may be any suitable material from which<br>
the dispenser nozzle may be formed. For instance, it may be formed from<br>
metallic material such as aluntioium foil or a flexible material such as rubber.<br>
Preferably, however, the body of the device is formed entirely from a rigid<br>
plastic material or a flexible plastic material.<br>
The pump-action dispenser nozzle is preferably formed from a single<br>
rigid or flexible plastic material.<br>
The expression "rigid plastic material" is used herein to refer to a plastic<br>
material that possesses a high degree of rigidity and strength once moulded into<br>
the desire<j form but which can also be rendered more flexible or resiliency></j>
deformable in portions by reducing the thickness of the plastic. Thus, a thinned<br>
section of plastic can be provided to form the at least a portion of the body that<br>
defines the chamber and which is configured to resiliency deform.<br>
The term "flexible plastic" is used herein to denote plastics materials<br>
which are inherently flexible/resiliently deformable so as to enable the resilient<br>
displacement of at least a portion of the body to facilitate the compression of<br>
the chamber. The extent of the flexibility of the plastic may be dependent on<br>
the thickness of the plastic in any given area or region. Such "flexible plastic"<br>
materials are used, for example, in the preparation of shampoo bottles or<br>
shower gel containers. In. the fabrication of a dispenser nozzle of the present<br>
invention, portions of the body may be formed from thicker sections of plastic<br>
to provide the required rigidity to the structure, whereas other portions may be<br>
composed of thinner sections of plastic to provide the necessary deformability<br>
characteristics. If necessary, a framework of thicker sections, generally known<br>
as support ribs, may be present if extra rigidity is required in certain areas.<br>
The advantage of using a single material is that the entire dispenser<br>
nozzle can be moulded in a single tool and in a single moulding operation, as<br>
discussed further below.<br>
Preferably the fluid source is a container to which the dispenser nozzle<br>
of the invention is either attached or integrally formed with.<br>
The outlet of the dispenser nozzle may be of any suitable form.<br>
Preferably, however, the outlet comprises an outlet passageway that extends<br>
from the chamber to an outlet orifice of the device.<br>
The body of the dispenser nozzle<br>
It is preferred that body of the pump-action dispenser nozzle comprises<br>
two or more interconnected parts, which, when connected together define the<br>
chamber. It is especially preferred that the chamber of the dispenser nozzle is<br>
defined between two interconnected parts.<br>
It is also preferred that the at least two interconnected parts that define<br>
the chamber also between them define at least a portion of the outlet of the<br>
dispenser nozzle, or a passageway leading to the outlet from the chamber.<br>
It is most preferred that the two parts of the body of the dispenser nozzle<br>
that define the chamber are a base part and an upper part. The base part is<br>
preferably adapted to be fitted to the opening of a container by a suitable<br>
means. For example, it may be in the form of a screw-threaded cap that can be<br>
screwed onto a neck opening of a container. Furthermore, in addition to<br>
forming a portion of the body that defines the chamber, the base part also<br>
preferably defines the inlet as well as a portion of the passageway leading from<br>
the chamber to the outlet.<br>
The upper part is adapted to be fitted to the base so that between them<br>
they define the chamber and, in preferred embodiments, an outlet passageway<br>
and/or outlet orifice of the dispenser. In certain preferred embodiments of the<br>
invention, the base and upper part also define the outlet orifice. It is also<br>
preferred mat the upper part forms the resiliently deformable portion of the<br>
body defining the chamber.<br>
The portion of the body configured to resiliently deform could be a<br>
relatively thin section of a rigid plastic material which elastically deforms to<br>
compress the chamber when a pressure is applied and then subsequently returns<br>
to its initial resiliently biased configuration when the applied pressure is<br>
removed. Alternatively, the portion of the body configured to resiliently<br>
deform may comprise a substantially rigid portion surrounded by a deformable<br>
portion such that pressure applied to the rigid portion causes the surrounding<br>
resiliency deformable portion of deform and thereby enables the rigid portion<br>
to be displaced to compress the chamber. For example, the surrounding<br>
resiliently deformable portion could resemble a bellows, i.e. a rigid portion is<br>
surrounded by a deformable side wall that comprises a number of folded<br>
segments of rigid plastic which is configured such that applying a pressure to<br>
the rigid portion causes the folds of the sidewall to resiliently compress together<br>
to reduce the volume of the chamber. Once the applied pressure is removed,<br>
the side walls return to their original configuration.<br>
It is especially preferred that the at least two parts of the body are made<br>
from the same material and connected to one another by means of hinge or a<br>
foldable connection element This enables the two parts to be moulded together<br>
in a single moulding operation and then swung into contact with one another to<br>
form the assembled dispenser nozzle (e.g. the upper part can be swung into<br>
contact with the base).<br>
The two parts of the body may be permanently fixed together by, for<br>
example, ultrasonically welding or heat welding. If the base and upper part are<br>
to be moulded or welded together, then it is preferable that they are made from<br>
compatible materials. As previously indicated above, however, it is preferable<br>
that the body is formed from a single material.<br>
Alternatively, the two parts may be configured to fit tightly/resistively to<br>
one another to form the nozzle (e.g. by the provision of a snap-fit connection)<br>
in the absence of any welding. For instance, the edges of one part may be<br>
configured to fit into a retaining groove of the other part to form the dispenser<br>
nozzle.<br>
As a further alternative, a compatible plastic material may be moulded<br>
over the join of the two parts to secure them together. This can be achieved by<br>
moulding the two components simultaneously in a tool, joining them together in<br>
the tool to form the dispenser nozzle device and then moulding a suitable<br>
plastic material around them to hold the two parts together.<br>
In certain embodiments, the two parts may remain releasably attached to<br>
one another so that they can be separated during use to enable the chamber<br>
and/or the outlet to be cleaned.<br>
For most applications the dispenser would need to be made from a rigid<br>
material to provide the necessary strength and enable the two-parts to be either<br>
snap fitted or welded together. In such cases, the deformable portion of the<br>
body tends to deform only when a certain minimum threshold pressure is<br>
applied and this makes the pump action more like the on/off action associated<br>
conventional pump-action dispenser nozzles. However, in certain applications,<br>
a flexible material may be preferred. Examples of such applications include<br>
embodiments where the dispenser nozzle is integrally formed with the<br>
associated container, which may, for example, be in the form of a sachet, or<br>
where the fluid supply is stored in the device rather than a separate container.<br>
The Outlet Valve<br>
In order to function optimally, it is necessary that the outlet of the<br>
chamber is provided with, or is adapted to function as, a one-way valve. The<br>
one-way valve enables product stored in the chamber to be dispensed through<br>
the outlet only when a predetermined nikirnum threshold pressure is achieved<br>
within the chamber (as a consequence of the reduction in the volume of the<br>
internal chamber caused by the displacement of the resiliency deformable wall<br>
from its initial resilientiy biased configuration), and closes the outlet at all other<br>
times to form an airtight seal. The closure of the valve when the pressure in the<br>
chamber is below a predetermined minimum threshold pressure prevents air<br>
being sucked back through the outlet into the chamber when the applied<br>
pressure to the resilientiy deformable portion of the body is released and the<br>
volume of the chamber increases as the resiliently defonnable wall re-assumes<br>
its initial resiliently biased configuration.<br>
Any suitable one-way valve assembly that is capable of forming an<br>
airtight seal may be provided in the outlet. It is preferable that the valve is<br>
formed by the component parts of the body of the dispenser nozzle.<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention where the outlet comprises an<br>
outlet passageway extending from the chamber to an outlet orifice, it is<br>
preferred that the outlet passageway, or at least a portion thereof, and/or the<br>
outlet orifice is defined between the base and upper part of the dispenser<br>
nozzle. Most preferably, the passageway is defined between two abutting<br>
surfaces of the base and the upper part, and at least a portion of one of the<br>
abutment surfaces is resiliently biased against the opposing surface so as to<br>
form the one-way outlet valve in the passageway or at the outlet orifice. In this<br>
regard, the resiliently biased surfaces form a closure within the outlet<br>
passageway and/or outlet orifice that will only open and permit fluid to be<br>
dispensed from the chamber when the pressure within the chamber is sufficient<br>
to cause the resiliently biased abutment surface to deform away from the<br>
opposing abutment surface and thereby form an open channel through which<br>
fluid from the chamber can flow. Once the pressure falls below a<br>
predetermined mininium threshold value, the resiliently biased surface will<br>
return to its resiliently biased configuration and close off the passageway.<br>
It is especially preferred that the at least a portion of the resiliently<br>
defonnable abutment surface adapted to deform away from the opposing<br>
surface to open the outlet valve is integrally formed with the resiliently<br>
defonnable portion of the body, which defines the chamber.<br>
In embodiments where the flexible and resiliently defonnable part of the<br>
outlet passageway/valve is made from a thin section of a rigid plastic material,<br>
the resistance may not be sufficient to provide the required minimum pressure<br>
threshold. In such cases, a thickened rib of plastic, which extends across the<br>
passageway, may be formed to provide the necessary strength and resistance in<br>
the outlet passageway/valve. Alternatively, a rigid reinforcing rib could be<br>
provided above part of the outlet passageway/valve.<br>
In an alternative preferred embodiment, the outlet valve is formed by a<br>
resiliency deformable member which extends across the outlet channel to<br>
effectively close off and seal the passageway. The member is mounted to the<br>
device along one of its edges and has another of its edges (preferably the<br>
opposing edge) free, the free end being configured to displace when the<br>
pressure within the chamber exceeds a predetermined rninimum threshold<br>
value. The free end abuts a surface of the outlet channel to form a seal<br>
therewith when the pressure is below the predetermined minimum threshold<br>
value. However, when the pressure exceeds the predetermined minimum<br>
threshold value, the free end of the member is displaced from the abutment<br>
surface of the channel to form an opening through which the fluid present in the<br>
chamber can flow to the outlet. Preferably, the resiliency deformable member<br>
is positioned within a chamber formed along the length of the outlet channel or<br>
passageway. Most preferably, the abutment surface, which forms the seal with<br>
the free end of the member at pressures below the minimum threshold, is<br>
tapered or sloped at the point of contact with the free end of the member. This<br>
provides a point seal contact and provides a much more efficient seal. It will of<br>
course be appreciated that the slope or taper of the abutment surface must be<br>
arranged so that the free end of the resiliently deformable member contacts the<br>
slope when the pressure within the chamber is below the predetermined<br>
minimum threshold, but distends away from it when the predetermined<br>
minimum threshold is exceeded.<br>
Alternatively, the valve may be a post or plug formed on the abutment<br>
surface of one of the base or upper parts and which contacts the opposing<br>
abutment surface to close off and seal the passageway. The post or plug will be<br>
mounted to a defonnable area of the base or upper part so that when the<br>
pressure within the chamber exceeds a predetermined threshold value, the post<br>
or plug can be deformed to define an opening through which fluid can flow<br>
through the outlet. The pressure required to displace the post or plug could be<br>
set at any desired level (effectively forming a pre-compression valve that<br>
ensures that fluid is only ejected with the desired pressure).<br>
, In yet another preferred embodiment of the invention, the dispenser<br>
nozzle is configured so that the fluid is dispensed substantially horizontally or,<br>
more preferably, so that the fluid may be dispensed in a downward direction. In<br>
the latter case, the outlet orifice is preferably a downward facing opening<br>
defined by the base with an outlet passageway leading thereto from the chamber<br>
being defined by the upper surface of the base and the opposing under surface<br>
of the upper part. In addition to defining the outlet orifice, the base may also<br>
define a downwardly extending portion of the passageway. It is also preferable<br>
that the downward facing orifice or a downward extending portion of the<br>
passageway leading to a downward facing orifice is formed with a minimal<br>
internal volume (i.e. the passageway is of minimal length so that the volume is<br>
as small as possible, or the plug could fill the entire orifice volume to displace<br>
any fluid that may remain in this area). This provides a benefit in that outlet<br>
orifice is formed vertically and no side action on the tool is required to form it.<br>
For example, a forward sloping hole could be achieved by sloping the rear wall<br>
of the orifice forwards and keeping the front wall vertical. This arrangement<br>
would come off a tool with no side action. In addition, the minimised volume<br>
reduces problems of fluid retained in the passageway from dribbling out of the<br>
outlet after use and will minimise blockages caused by the presence of dried<br>
fluid. In such embodiments, the outlet valve is preferably formed by a plug<br>
formed on the under surface of the upper part which extends into the<br>
downwardly extending passage and/or outlet orifice defined by the base. The<br>
plug mounted to a resiliently defonnable area and is configured to be displaced<br>
from the downwardly extending passage and/or outlet orifice when the within<br>
the chamber exceeds the predetermined threshold value and then subsequently<br>
return to its resiliently biased configuration to close the outlet and prevent air<br>
being drawn into the chamber through the outlet.<br>
The predetermined minimum pressure that is required will depend on the<br>
application concerned and a person skilled in the art will appreciate how to<br>
modify the properties of the resilientiy deformable surface by the selection of<br>
an appropriate resiliently deformable material and varying the manner in which<br>
the surface is fabricated (e.g. by the inclusion of strengthening ridges).<br>
The Inlet valve<br>
To ensure that fluid is only ejected through outlet when the chamber is<br>
compressed by displacing the resilientiy deformable portion of the body into the<br>
chamber from its initial resiliently biased configuration, it is necessary to<br>
provide a one-way inlet valve disposed at or in the inlet of the nozzle device.<br>
Any suitable inlet valve may be used.<br>
The inlet valve may be adapted to only open and permit fluid to flow<br>
into the chamber when the pressure within the chamber falls below a<br>
predetermined minimum threshold pressure (as is the case when the pressure<br>
applied to the resiliently deformable portion of the chamber to compress the<br>
chamber is released and the volume of the chamber increases as the resiliently<br>
deformable portion reassumes it's initial resiliently biased configuration). In<br>
such cases, the inlet valve may be a flap valve which consists of a resiliently<br>
deformable flap positioned over the inlet opening. The flap is preferably<br>
resiliently biased against the inlet opening and adapted to deform so as to allow<br>
fluid to be drawn into the chamber through the inlet when the pressure within<br>
the chamber falls below a predetermined minimum threshold pressure. At all<br>
other times, however, the inlet will be closed, thereby preventing fluid flowing<br>
back from the chamber into the inlet. It is especially preferred that the<br>
resiliency deformable flap is formed as an integral extension of the resiliently<br>
deformable portion of the body which defines the chamber. It is also especially<br>
preferred that the base defines the inlet and the resiliently deformable portion of<br>
the body is formed by the upper part. It is therefore the preferred that the upper<br>
part comprises the resiliently deformable flap that extends within said chamber<br>
to cover the inlet opening to the chamber and form the inlet valve.<br>
Alternatively, the flap may not be resilientiy biased against the inlet<br>
opening and may instead be disposed over the inlet opening and configured<br>
such that it is pressed against the inlet only when the chamber is compressed<br>
and the pressure therein increases.<br>
Problems can arise, however, with the simple provision of a flap valve<br>
that is resiliently biased over the inlet opening. Specifically, over time the<br>
elastic limit of the material from which the flap is formed may be exceeded,<br>
which may cause it to not function properly. This problem applies particularly<br>
to embodiments of the invention in which the flap is formed from a thin section<br>
of a rigid material, although it also applies to a lesser extent to flexible<br>
materials and can occur due to deformation of the flap when the chamber is<br>
compressed, as well as when the flap deforms to open the valve. As a<br>
consequence, fluid could leak from the chamber back into the container through<br>
the inlet.<br>
For these reasons it is preferable that flap valve comprises a number of<br>
adaptations. In particular, it is preferred that the inlet has a raised lip extending<br>
around the inlet orifice that the resiliently deformable flap abuts to create a tight<br>
seal around the inlet. The provision of a lip ensures a good contact is obtained<br>
with the flap. In embodiments where the lip is very small it may be necessary<br>
to provide one or more additional support ribs at either side of the inlet opening<br>
to ensure that a proper seal is formed and to also prevent the lip from damage.<br>
A further preferred feature is that the flap possesses a protrusion or plug<br>
formed on its surface. The-protrusion or plug extends a short way into the inlet<br>
opening and abuts the side edges to further enhance the seal formed.<br>
It is also preferred that the inlet opening to the chamber is disposed at an<br>
elevated position within the chamber so that fluid flows into the chamber<br>
through the inlet and drops down into a holding or reservoir area. This prevents<br>
fluid resting on the top of the inlet valve over prolonged periods by effectively<br>
distancing the inlet opening from the main fluid holding/reservoir area of the<br>
chamber and thereby reduces the likelihood of any leaks occurring over time.<br>
It is also preferred that a second reinforcing flap or member contacts the<br>
opposing surface of the resiliency deformable flap to urge it into tight abutment<br>
with the inlet opening. It is also preferred that the second reinforcing flap<br>
contact the opposing surface of the resiliently deformable flap at or close to the<br>
portion of the opposing surface that covers the inlet orifice to maximise the<br>
vertical pressure of the main flap over the hole. Again this helps to maintain<br>
the integrity of the seal.<br>
Locking means<br>
The nozzle device may also be provided with a locking means to prevent<br>
the fluid being dispensed accidentally.<br>
Preferably the lock is integrally formed with the body. For instance, the<br>
locking means may be hinged bar or member that is integrally connected to a<br>
part of the body (e.g. either the base or upper part) and which can be swung into<br>
a position whereby the actuator cannot be depressed by an operator (e.g. the<br>
actuator engages the bar or member to prevent it being depressed by an operator<br>
to resiliently deform the portion of the body defining the chamber).<br>
The locking means may also comprise a rigid cover that can be placed<br>
over the resilientiy deformable portion of the body to prevent it being<br>
compressed. The cover may be connected to the dispenser nozzle by a hinge to<br>
enable it to be folded over when required. Alternatively, the rigid cover may be<br>
a slidable over cap that can be slid downwards to compress the chamber during<br>
use. The cover can be twisted to lock it and thereby prevent the accidental<br>
actuation of the device.<br>
Alternatively, the locking means may be in the form of a plug which is<br>
formed on one of the component parts of the body (e.g. upper part or the base)<br>
and which can be pushed into a tight, resistive engagement with a formation<br>
formed on the opposing component part and thereby form a blockage of the<br>
outlet which can only be removed by an operator removing the plug prior to<br>
use. In a particularly preferred embodiment, the plug is formed on the upper<br>
part of the body and is configured to selectively engage within, and block, the<br>
outlet orifice formed in the base. Thus, an operator can push the plug into the<br>
outlet orifice to lock the outlet and can pull the plug out of engagement with the<br>
outlet orifice prior to use, as described further below in reference to the<br>
accompanying drawings.<br>
Air Release/leak Valve<br>
The device may further comprise an air leak through which air can flow<br>
to equalise any pressure differential between the interior of the container and<br>
the external environment. In some cases, the air leak may simply occur through<br>
gaps in the fitting between the dispenser nozzle and the container, but this is not<br>
preferred because leakage may occur if the container is inverted or shaken. In<br>
preferred embodiments, the dispenser nozzle further comprises an air leak<br>
valve, i.e. a one-way valve that is adapted to permit air to flow into the<br>
container, but prevents any fluid leaking out of the container if it is inverted.<br>
Any suitable one-way valve system would suffice. It is preferred, however, that<br>
the air leak valve is integrally formed within the body of the dispenser or, more<br>
preferably, between two component parts of the body of the dispenser.<br>
Most preferably, the air leak valve is formed between the upper part and<br>
base which define the chamber of the dispenser nozzle.<br>
Preferably, the air leak valve comprises a valve member disposed within<br>
a channel that is defined by the body of the device and connects the interior of<br>
the fluid supply to the external environment. Most preferably, the valve<br>
member is resiliently biased so as to contact the sides of the channel and forms<br>
a sealing engagement therewith to prevent any liquid from leaking out of the<br>
container, the valve member being further adapted to either resiliently deform<br>
or displace from the sealing engagement with the sides of the channel to define<br>
an opening through which air can flow into the container when pressure within<br>
the container falls below the external pressure by at least a minimum threshold<br>
amount. Once the pressure differential between the ulterior and the exterior of<br>
the container has been reduced to below the minimum threshold pressure3 the<br>
valve member returns to it position in which the channel is closed.<br>
Preferably, the valve member is in the form of a plunger that extends<br>
into the channel and comprises an outwardly extending wall that abuts the sides<br>
of the channel to form a seal. Preferably, the outwardly extending wall is<br>
additionally angled towards the interior of the container. This configuration<br>
means that a high pressure within the container and exerted on the wall of the<br>
valve member will cause the wall to remain in abutment with the sides of the<br>
channel. Thus, the integrity of the seal is maintained thereby preventing liquid<br>
from leaking out through the valve. Conversely, when pressure within the<br>
container falls below the external pressure by at least a minimum threshold<br>
amount, the wall is deflected away from the sides of the container to permit air<br>
to flow into the container to equalise or reduce the pressure differential.<br>
It is especially preferred that the plunger is mounted on to a deformable<br>
base or flap which is capable of some movement when the dome is pressed to<br>
displace any residue that may have accumulated in the air leak valve. In<br>
addition, the provision of a moveable (e.g. resiliency defonnable) element<br>
within the air leak valve is preferred because it helps to prevent the valve<br>
becoming clogged during use.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention it is also preferred that a<br>
protective cover is provided over the opening of the female tube on the internal<br>
surface of the device to prevent liquid present in the interior of the container<br>
from contacting the valve member with a high or excessive force when the<br>
container is inverted or shaken aggressively. The cover will allow air and some<br>
fluid to flow past, but will prevent fluid impacting on the seal formed by the<br>
flared end of the plunger directly, and thus will prevent the seal being exposed<br>
to excessive forces.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the channel of the air leak valve may be<br>
resiliency defonnable instead of the male part. This arrangement can be<br>
configured so that the side walls of the channel distort to permit air to flow into<br>
the container.<br>
The valve member and channel could be made from the same material or<br>
different materials. For instance, they may both be made from a semi-flexible<br>
plastic or the female element may be made from a rigid plastic and the male<br>
part made from a resiliency deformable material.<br>
With certain products stored in containers over time there is a problem<br>
associated with gas building up inside the bottle over time. To release the build<br>
up of pressure, which can inevitably occur, a release valve is required. The air<br>
leak valve described above can be modified to additionally perform this<br>
function by providing one or more fine grooves in the side of the channel.<br>
These fine groove(s) will permit gas to slowly seep out of the container, bypassing<br>
the seal formed by the contact of the valve member with the sides of the<br>
channel, but prevent or minimise the volume of liquid that may seep out.<br>
Preferably, the groove or grooves formed in the side walls of the channel is/are<br>
formed on the external side of the point of contact between the valve member<br>
and the sides of the channel so that it/they are only exposed when the pressure<br>
inside the container increases and acts on the plunger to cause it to deform<br>
outwards (relative to the container). The plunger will return to its resiliency<br>
biased position in which the grooves are not exposed once any excess gas has<br>
been emitted. No liquid product should be lost during this process.<br>
Alternatively, the gas pressure within the container could urge the valve<br>
member outwards so that it is displaced from the channel and defines an<br>
opening through which the gas could flow.<br>
Seal<br>
In preferred embodiments of the invention comprising at least two<br>
component parts, it is preferred that a seal is disposed at the join between the at<br>
least two interconnected parts to prevent any fluid leaking out of the dispenser<br>
nozzle. Any suitable seal would suffice. For instance, the two parts could be<br>
welded to one another or one part could be configured to snap fit into a sealing<br>
engagement with the other part or have possess a flange around its perimeter<br>
that fits tightly around the upper surface of the other part to form a seal<br>
therewith.<br>
Preferably, the seal comprises a male protrusion formed on the abutment<br>
surface of one of the at least two parts that is received in a sealing engagement<br>
with a corresponding groove formed on the opposing abutment surface of the<br>
other part when the two parts are connected together.<br>
The seal preferably extends around the entire chamber and also the outlet<br>
so that fluid leaking from any position in the dispenser is prevented from<br>
seeping between the join between the two component parts.<br>
In certain embodiments that comprise an outlet passageway the<br>
. protrusion member may extend across the passageway and form the resiliency<br>
deformable valve member of the outlet valve. This portion of the protrusion<br>
will usually be thinner to provide the necessary resilience in the valve member<br>
to permit it to perform its function.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, the male protrusion may be<br>
configured to snap fit into the groove or, alternatively, the male protrusion may<br>
be configured to resistively fit into the groove in a similar manner to the way in<br>
which a plug fits into the hole of a sink.<br>
Dip Tube<br>
In most cases, a dip tube may be integrally formed with the dispenser, or<br>
alternatively the body of the dispenser may comprise a recess into which a<br>
separate dip tube can be fitted. The dip tube enables fluid to be drawn from<br>
deep inside the container during use and thus, will be present in virtually all<br>
cases.<br>
Alternatively, it may be desirable with some containers, particularly<br>
small volume containers, such as glues, perfume bottles and nasal sprays, to<br>
omit the dip tube, because the device itself could extend into the container to<br>
draw the product into the dispenser nozzle during use, or the container could be<br>
inverted to facilitate the priming of the dispenser with fluid. Alternatively, the<br>
device may further comprise a fluid compartment formed as an integral part of<br>
device from which fluid can be drawn directly into the inlet of the nozzle<br>
without the need for a dip tube.<br>
Internal chamber<br>
The chamber of the nozzle device may be of any form and it shall of<br>
course be appreciated that the dimensions and shape of the dome will be<br>
selected to suit the particular device and application concerned. Similarly, all<br>
the fluid in the chamber may be expelled when the dome is compressed or,<br>
alternatively, only a proportion of the fluid present in the chamber may be<br>
dispensed, again depending on the application concerned.<br>
In certain preferred embodiments of the invention, the chamber is<br>
defined by a generally dome-shaped resiliency deformable region of the body.<br>
Preferably, the dome-shaped region is formed on the upper surface of the body<br>
so that it is accessible for pressing by an operator. One problem with domeshaped<br>
chambers can be that a certain amount of dead space exists within the<br>
chamber when it is compressed by an operator, and for some applications it will<br>
be preferable that the dead space is minimised or virtually negligible. To<br>
achieve this property, it has been found that flattened domes or other shaped<br>
chambers whereby the resiliency deformable wall of chamber can be depressed<br>
such that it contacts an opposing wall of the chamber and thereby expels all of<br>
the contents present therein are generally preferred. For this reason, a flattened<br>
dome is especially preferred because it reduces the extent with which the dome<br>
needs to be pressed inwards in order to compress the chamber and actuate the<br>
dispensing of fluid stored therein. It also reduces the number of presses<br>
required to prime the chamber ready for the first use.<br>
In some cases, the resiliency deformable portion of the body may not be<br>
sufficiently resilient to retain its original resiliently biased configuration<br>
following deformation. This may be the case where the fluid has a high<br>
viscosity and hence tends to resist being drawn into the chamber through the<br>
inlet. In such cases, extra resilience can be provided by the positioning of one<br>
or more resiliency deformable posts within the chamber, which bend when the<br>
r.<br>
chamber is compressed and urge the deformed portion of the body back to its<br>
original resiliency biased configuration when the applied pressure is removed.<br>
Alternatively, one or more thickened ribs of plastic could extend from the edge<br>
of the resiliently deformable area towards the middle of this portion. These ribs<br>
will increase the resilience of the resiliency deformable area by effectively<br>
functioning as a leaf spring which compresses when a pressure is applied to the<br>
resiliency deformable portion of the body, and urges this portion back to its<br>
initial resiliency biased configuration when the applied pressure is removed.<br>
Yet another alternative is that a spring or another form of resilient means<br>
is disposed in the chamber. As above, the spring will compress when the wall<br>
is deformed and, when the applied pressure is removed, will urge the deformed<br>
portion of the body to return to its original resiliency biased configuration and,<br>
in doing so, urges the compressed chamber back into its original "noncompressed<br>
configuration".<br>
Two or more chambers<br>
The nozzle device of the invention may comprise two or more separate<br>
internal chambers.<br>
Each individual chamber may draw fluid into the nozzle device through<br>
a separate inlet from different fluid sources, e.g. separate fluid-filled<br>
compartments within the same container.<br>
Alternatively, one or more of the additional chambers may not comprise<br>
an inlet. Instead a reservoir of the second fluid may be stored in the chamber<br>
itself and the additional chamber or its outlet may be configured to only permit<br>
a predetermined amount of the second fluid to be dispensed with each<br>
actuation.<br>
As a further alternative, one or more chambers of the additional<br>
chambers may draw air in from outside the nozzle device. Whether the<br>
additional chamber or chambers contain air or some other fluid drawn from a<br>
separate compartment within the container, the contents of the two or more<br>
chambers can be ejected simultaneously through the outlet by simultaneously<br>
compressing both chambers together. The contents of the respective chambers<br>
will then be mixed within the outlet, either on, after or prior to, ejection from<br>
the nozzle device. It shall be appreciated that varying the relative volumes of<br>
the separate chambers and/or the dimensions of the outlet can be used to<br>
influence the relative proportions of constituents present in the final mixture<br>
expelled through the outlet. Furthermore, the outlet passageway may be<br>
divided into two or more separate channels, each channel extending from a<br>
separate chamber, and each separate channel may feed fluid into a spray nozzle<br>
passageway as discussed above where it is mixed prior to ejection.<br>
Where an additional chamber for the expulsion of air is present, it shall<br>
be appreciated that, once the expulsion of air is complete and the applied<br>
pressure is removed thereby allowing the chamber to deform back to its original<br>
expanded configuration, more air needs to be drawn into the chamber to<br>
replenish that expelled. This can be achieved by either sucking air back in<br>
through the outlet (i.e. not providing this additional chamber with an airtight<br>
outlet valve) or, more preferably, drawing air in though an inlet hole in the body<br>
defining the chamber. In the latter case, the inlet hole is preferably provided<br>
with a one-way valve similar to the inlet valve discussed above. This valve will<br>
only permit air to be drawn into the chamber and will prevent air being expelled<br>
back through the hole when the chamber is compressed.<br>
In most cases, it is desirable to co-eject the air. and fluid from the<br>
container at approximately the same pressure. This will require the air chamber<br>
to be compressed more (e.g. 3-200 times more - depending on the application<br>
concerned) than the fluid/liquid-containing chamber. This may be achieved by<br>
positioning the chambers so that, when a pressure is applied, the compression<br>
of the air-containing chamber occurs preferentially, thereby enabling the air and<br>
liquid to be ejected at the same or substantially the same pressure. For<br>
example, the air-containing chamber may be positioned behind the liquidcontaining<br>
chamber so that, when a pressure is applied, the air chamber is<br>
compressed first until a stage is reached when both chambers are compressed<br>
together.<br>
As an alternative, the nozzle device may also be adapted in such a way<br>
that the air pressure may be higher or lower than the liquid pressure, which may<br>
be beneficial for certain applications.<br>
The chambers may be arranged side by side or one chamber may be on<br>
top of another. In a preferred embodiment where one of the additional<br>
chambers contains air, the additional air chamber is positioned relative to the<br>
chamber of the nozzle device so that the compression of the air chamber causes<br>
the resiliency deformable portion of the body to deform and compress the<br>
chamber of the nozzle device.<br>
Preferably, the fluid present in each chamber are ejected simultaneously.<br>
However, it shall be appreciated that one chamber may eject its fluid before or<br>
after another chamber in certain applications.<br>
In alternative embodiments, air and fluid from the container may be<br>
present in a single chamber, rather than separate chambers. In such cases, fluid<br>
and air is co-ejected and may be mixed as it flows through the outlet. For<br>
example, where the outlet comprises an expansion chamber, i.e. a widened<br>
chamber positioned in the outlet passageway, the contents ejected from the<br>
chamber could be split into separate branches of the channel and enter the<br>
expansion chamber at different locations to encourage mixing.<br>
Integral part of a container<br>
In most cases it is preferable that the dispenser nozzle is adapted to be<br>
fitted to container by some suitable means, e.g. a snap fit or a screw thread<br>
connection. In certain cases, however, the dispenser could be incorporated into<br>
a container as an integral part. For instance, the dispenser device could be<br>
integrally moulded with various forms of plastic container, such as rigid<br>
containers or bags. This is possible because the device is preferably moulded<br>
as a single material and, therefore, can be integrally moulded with containers<br>
made from the same or a similar compatible material.<br>
According to a second aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>
a container having a pump-action dispenser nozzle as hereinbefore defined<br>
fitted to an opening thereof so as to enable the fluid stored in the container to be<br>
dispensed from the container through said dispenser nozzle during use.<br>
According to a third aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
container having a pump-action dispenser nozzle as hereinbefore defined<br>
integrally formed therewith so as to enable the fluid stored in the container to<br>
be dispensed from the container through said dispenser nozzle during use.<br>
According to a fourth aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
pump-action dispenser nozzle having a body which defines an internal chamber<br>
having an outlet through which fluid present in the chamber may be expelled<br>
from the nozzle, said outlet comprising an outlet valve configured to only<br>
permit fluid to flow out of the chamber and be expelled from the nozzle when<br>
the pressure therein exceeds the external pressure at the outlet by at least a<br>
minimum threshold amount, and wherein at least a portion of the body which<br>
defines said chamber is configured to resiliently deform from an initial<br>
resiliently biased configuration to a distended or deformed configuration in<br>
response to the application of a pressure, whereby the volume of said chamber<br>
defined by said portion of the body is reduced as said portion of the body is<br>
deformed from said initial configuration to said distended or deformed<br>
configuration, said reduction in volume causing the pressure within the<br>
chamber to increase and fluid to be ejected through the outlet valve.<br>
The nozzle arrangements of the fourth aspect of the invention are the<br>
same as those defined above for the first aspect of the invention, except that the<br>
dispenser does not comprise an inlet/ inlet valve through which fluid can be<br>
drawn into the internal chamber. Instead, the entire fluid supply is stored<br>
within the chamber. The device may be a single use dispenser whereby the<br>
entire contents of the chamber are dispensed when the resiliently defonnable<br>
portion of the body is deformed. Alternatively, the portion of the body may<br>
only be partially deformed to eject a proportion of the contents of the chamber<br>
and then deformed further if more fluid is desired to be dispensed.<br>
Another difference is that the body will just deform when a pressure is<br>
applied and will not subsequently return to its initial resiliency biased<br>
configuration due to the absence of the inlet.<br>
The outlet and outlet valve are preferably as defined above in relation to<br>
the first aspect of the present invention.<br>
The body of the device may be made from any suitable material. It may<br>
also be made from two or more interconnected parts, as previously described.<br>
Each part may be made from the same material or a different material.<br>
In some embodiments of the invention, the entire body defining the<br>
chamber may be resiliently deformable. Alternatively, only a portion of the<br>
body may be configured to resiliently deform.<br>
The dispenser may be of any suitable form. For example, the chamber<br>
could resemble a sachet or any similar form of fluid-filled vessel. In such<br>
cases, squeezing the body will cause the pressure therein to increase and fluid<br>
will then be ejected through the outlet.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
pump-action dispenser nozzle adapted to enable fluid stored in a fluid source to<br>
be dispensed through said nozzle during use, said nozzle having a body which<br>
defines an internal chamber having an inlet through which fluid may be drawn<br>
into said chamber and an outlet through which fluid present in the chamber may<br>
be expelled from the nozzle, said inlet comprising an inlet valve adapted to only<br>
permit fluid to flow into the chamber through the inlet when the pressure within<br>
the chamber falls below the pressure within tib.e fluid source by at least a<br>
minimum threshold amount and said outlet comprising an outlet valve<br>
configured to only permit fluid to flow out of the chamber and be expelled from<br>
the nozzle when the pressure therein exceeds the external pressure at the outlet<br>
by at least a minimum threshold amount, and wherein at least a portion of the<br>
body which defines said chamber is configured to:<br>
(i) resiliently deform from an initial resiliently biased configuration to a<br>
distended or deformed configuration in response to the application of a<br>
pressure, whereby the volume of said chamber defined by said portion of the<br>
body is reduced as said portion of the body is deformed from said initial<br>
configuration to said distended or deformed configuration, said reduction in<br>
volume causing the pressure within the chamber to increase and fluid to be<br>
ejected through the outlet valve; and<br>
(ii) subsequently return to its initial resiliently biased configuration when<br>
the applied pressure is removed, thereby causing the volume of the chamber to<br>
increase and the pressure therein to fall such that fluid is drawn into the<br>
chamber through the inlet valve;<br>
characterised hi that the body is composed of two parts that fit together<br>
to define said chamber, a first of said parts being formed entirely from a rigid<br>
material and a second of said parts being formed from a flexible/resiliently<br>
deformable material housed within a rigid material, wherein the rigid portion of<br>
the second part is configured to secure the second part to the base part to form<br>
the assembled dispenser nozzle and is connected to the rigid first part by means<br>
of a hinge or a foldable connection element.<br>
It shall be appreciated that the resiliently deformable material forms the<br>
resiliently deformable portion of the body defining the chamber.<br>
Apart from the materials, the dispenser nozzles are preferably as defined<br>
above.<br>
Preferably, the first part is a base part and the second part is an upper<br>
part, as previously defined above.<br>
Preferably the rigid material is a plastic material and most preferably the<br>
rigid first part and the second part are formed from the same material. It is<br>
especially preferred that the rigid plastic portions of the first part are integrally<br>
formed with one another in a single moulding operation. The resiliency<br>
deformable portion may then be incorporated by a bi-injection moulding<br>
process whereby the resiliency deformable portion is moulded onto or into the<br>
second part in a second step prior to folding the second part over about the<br>
hinge or foldable connection and fitting it to the first part to form the assembled<br>
nozzle. Alternatively, the resiliently deformable material may be an insert<br>
which is positioned within the second part and held in place by securing the<br>
second part to the base.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, there is provided a<br>
pump-action dispenser nozzle adapted to enable fluid stored in a fluid source to<br>
be dispensed through said nozzle during use, said nozzle having a body which<br>
defines an internal chamber having an inlet through which fluid may be drawn<br>
into said chamber and an outlet through which fluid present in the chamber may<br>
be expelled from the nozzle, said inlet comprising an inlet valve adapted to only<br>
permit fluid to flow into the chamber through the inlet when the pressure within<br>
the chamber falls below the pressure within the fluid source by at least a<br>
minimum threshold amount and said outlet comprising an outlet valve<br>
configured to only permit fluid to flow out of the chamber and be expelled from<br>
the nozzle when the pressure therein exceeds the external pressure at the outlet<br>
by at least a minimum threshold amount, and wherein at least a portion of the<br>
body which defines said chamber is configured to:<br>
(i) be displaceable from an initial resiliently biased configuration to a<br>
distended or deformed configuration in response to the application of a<br>
pressure, whereby the volume of said chamber defined by said portion of the<br>
body is reduced as said portion of the body is deformed from said initial<br>
configuration to said distended or deformed configuration, said reduction in<br>
volume causing the pressure within the chamber to increase and fluid to be<br>
ejected through the outlet valve; and<br>
(ii) subsequently return to its initial resiliently biased configuration<br>
when the applied pressure is removed, thereby causing the volume of the<br>
chamber to increase and the pressure therein to fall such that fluid is drawn into<br>
the chamber through the inlet valve;<br>
characterised in that the body of the device is formed entirely from a<br>
rigid material or a flexible material.<br>
Preferably the dispenser nozzle is as defined above.<br>
In addition, it is also preferable, the part of the body that can be<br>
displaced inwards to reduce the volume of the chamber and thereby cause fluid<br>
present in said chamber to be ejected through the outlet is a piston mounted<br>
within a piston channel. The piston channel may form the entire chamber or,<br>
alternatively, just a portion thereof.<br>
Preferably, the dispenser nozzle comprises a means for displacing the<br>
piston inwards from its initial position and then subsequently returning it is<br>
initial position. This may be achieved by any suitable means, such as, for<br>
example, a trigger or over cap connected to the piston which can be operated to<br>
displace the piston, when desired. Preferably, the means for displacing the<br>
piston inwards from its initial position is resiliently biased so that the piston<br>
will be returned to its initial position after use.<br>
Method of manufacture<br>
The nozzle devices of the present invention may be made by any suitable<br>
methodology know in the art.<br>
As previously described, preferred embodiments of the invention<br>
comprise a body having two parts (a base and upper part) which fit together to<br>
define at least the chamber of the device and, more preferably, the chamber and<br>
at least a portion of the outlet.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>
a method of manufacturing a nozzle device as hereinbefore defined, said nozzle<br>
device having a body composed of at least two interconnected parts and said<br>
method comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) moulding said parts of the body; and<br>
(ii) connecting said parts of the body together to form the body of the<br>
nozzle device.<br>
Each part of the body may be a separate component part, in which case<br>
the component parts are initially formed and then assembled together to form<br>
the nozzle device.<br>
Alternatively, and more preferably, the two parts of the body or one of<br>
the parts of the body and the trigger actuator may be integrally formed with one<br>
another and connected by a bendable/foldable connection element. In such<br>
cases, the connected parts are formed in a single moulding step and then<br>
assembled together with the remaining part to form the nozzle device. For<br>
instance, the base and upper part of the preferred embodiments of the device<br>
may be integrally formed and connected to one another by a foldable/bendable<br>
connection element. Thus, the entire device will be formed in a single<br>
moulding step from a single material. Once formed, the upper part can be<br>
folded over and connected to the base to form the assembled nozzle device.<br>
As an alternative, the nozzle device may be formed by a bi-injection<br>
moulding process whereby a first component part the body is formed and a<br>
second part is then moulded onto the first part. Each part may be moulded from<br>
the same or a different material. As before, the trigger actuator may be a<br>
separate component part that is then fitted to the body of the nozzle device, or it<br>
may be integrally formed with one of the parts of the body.<br>
Once the two parts of the body are connected to one another to form the<br>
assembled body of the device, the two parts may be over moulded with another<br>
plastic to hold the two parts together<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
method of manufacturing a nozzle device as hereinbefore defined, said nozzle<br>
device having a body composed of at least two interconnected parts and said<br>
method comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) moulding a first of said parts of the body in a first processing<br>
step; and<br>
(ii) over-moulding the second of said parts onto the first of said parts<br>
in a second processing step to form the body of the nozzle device.<br>
The at least two parts are preferably moulded within the same moulding<br>
tool in a bi-injection moulding process. Usually the first part will be the base<br>
part of the nozzle device and the second part will be the upper part.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
method of manufacturing a nozzle device as hereinbefore defined, said nozzle<br>
device having a body composed of at least two interconnected parts and said<br>
method comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) moulding a first of said parts of the body in a first processing step<br>
together with a framework or base for a second of said parts; and<br>
(ii) over-moulding onto the framework or base to form the second of<br>
said parts of the assembled nozzle device.<br>
The framework for the second part may be fitted to the base prior to the<br>
over-moulding step.<br>
Alternatively, the over-moulding may take place before the framework<br>
for the second part is fitted to the first part.<br>
The over-moulding may be the same material to that of the first part and<br>
the framework of the second part or it may be a different material.<br>
It is especially preferred that the base is moulded first from a rigid<br>
plastic material together with the framework support for the upper part. The<br>
framework for the upper part is preferably connected to the base by a hinged or<br>
foldable connection member, which enables the framework to be folded over<br>
and fitted to the base during the assembly of the final product. The framework<br>
is over moulded with a compatible flexible, resiliency deformable plastic<br>
material which forms the resiliently deformable portion of the body that defines<br>
the chamber. The resiliently deformable plastic material may also form<br>
resiliently deformable valve members for the outlet valve and the inlet valve. It<br>
may also extend over other parts of the nozzle surface to provide a soft-touch<br>
feel to the device when an operator grips it. The rigid framework of the upper<br>
part may form an outer edge of the upper part, which forms the point of<br>
connection with the base and, in embodiments where a spray nozzle<br>
passageway is present, the framework may also form an upper abutment surface<br>
which contacts a lower abutment surface formed the base to define the spray<br>
passageway and outlet orifice.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention there is provided a<br>
method of manufacturing a nozzle device as hereinbefore defined, said nozzle<br>
device having a body composed of at least two interconnected parts and said<br>
method comprising the steps of:<br>
(i) moulding a first of said parts of the body in a first processing step<br>
together with a framework or base for a second of said parts; and<br>
(ii) positioning an insert portion of the body such that said insert is<br>
retained within the framework of the second part of the body<br>
when said framework is connected to the first parts of the body,<br>
said framework and insert forming the second part of the body.<br>
According to a further aspect of the present invention, there is provided<br>
a method of manufacturing a nozzle device as hereinbefore defined, said nozzle<br>
device having a body composed of at least two interconnected parts and<br>
wherein said parts are connected to one another by a connection element such<br>
that said parts are moveable relative to one another, said method comprising the<br>
steps of:<br>
(i) moulding the parts of the body together with said connection<br>
elements in a single moulding step; and<br>
(ii) moving said parts of the body into engagement with one another<br>
to form the body of the nozzle device.<br>
The dispenser nozzles of the present invention may be made by a<br>
number of different moulding techniques.<br>
Blowing Agent<br>
Preferably, a blowing agent is incorporated into the mould together with<br>
the plastic material. The blowing agent produces bubbles of gas within the<br>
moulded plastic that prevent the occurrence of a phenomenon known as sinkage<br>
from occurring. The problem of sinkage and the use of blowing agents in the<br>
manufacture of blowing agents to address this problem is described further in<br>
the applicant's co-pending International Patent Publication No. W003/049916,<br>
the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The pump-action dispenser nozzle of the present invention is particularly<br>
suited to dispensing viscous fluids, such as soaps, shampoos, etc.<br>
In contrast to many conventional pump-action dispenser nozzles, the<br>
nozzles according to the present invention provide an inexpensive, simple,<br>
convenient and effective means by which a product may be dispensed from a<br>
non-pressurised container. In certain embodiments, the nozzles of the present<br>
invention require less effort (typically up to four times less effort) to pump an<br>
equivalent volume of fluid when compared with the conventional pump and<br>
trigger nozzle devices. Furthermore., in preferred embodiments where the<br>
dispenser nozzle is formed from a single material, the nozzle devices of the<br>
present invention possess a number of advantages over the dispenser nozzles<br>
disclosed in EP 0 442 858, US 3,820,689, and EP 0 649 684 discussed<br>
previously. Specifically, the formation of the dispenser nozzle from a single<br>
material, particularly in preferred embodiments where the two parts are<br>
integrally formed and connected to one another by a foldable connection<br>
element or a hinged joint so that the upper part can be swung into contact with<br>
the base part to form the assembled dispenser nozzle, avoids the requirement<br>
for the assembly of multiple, separate component parts. Furthermore, forming<br>
the dispenser nozzle from a single material provides the possibility of<br>
possibility of welding the two parts of the body together (e.g. by heat or<br>
ultrasonic welding) or, if the plastic material is a rigid plastic material, then a<br>
snap-fit connection can be formed between the upper part and the base. The<br>
latter option also enables the upper part and base to be disconnected<br>
periodically for cleaning, as well as enabling the base to possess sufficient<br>
strength.<br>
In contrast, the dispensers disclosed in EP 0 442 858, US 3,820,689, and<br>
EP 0 649 684 require the assembly of the two component parts together and, if<br>
a lock was to be included, then three component parts would be required. In<br>
addition, the join between the resiliently deforrnable material and the rigid<br>
plastic material is less than perfect, because .during use the resiliently<br>
deforrnable material can creep or even become detached from the rigid<br>
material. Thus, the requirement for a more reliable join remains.<br>

In the following description of the figures, like reference numerals are<br>
used to denote like or corresponding parts in different figures, where<br>
appropriate.<br>
The embodiment of a dispenser nozzle shown in Figure 1 comprises a<br>
body 400 formed of two parts, namely a base part 401 and an upper part/rigid<br>
top 402, which is fitted to the upper surface of the base part 401. The body 400<br>
is formed from a rigid plastic material.<br>
The base part 401 comprises a screw-threaded recess in its underside to<br>
enable the body to be secured to a screw-threaded neck of a container,<br>
effectively forming a screw-threaded cap. The upper part 402 is fitted to the<br>
upper surface base part 401, as shown in Figure 1, and forms a substantially<br>
dome-shaped protrusion on the upper surface of the body 400. This dome<br>
shaped protrusion is the resiliency deformable portion of the body, which can<br>
be pressed by an operator to course it to deform inwards to reduce the volume<br>
of the internal chamber. This causes fluid to be ejected from the chamber<br>
through the outlet orifice 403.<br>
A perspective view of the base part 401 is shown in Figure 2. Referring<br>
to Figure 2, the base part 402 comprises a downwardly extending portion 501,<br>
the under surface of which is provided with the screw threaded recess<br>
previously mentioned. The upper surface of the base 401 has a perimeter edge<br>
504, which encircles a central recessed portion 502. The recessed portion 502<br>
consists of a deeper portion 502a shaped substantially like an inverted dome,<br>
which extends to form the lower part of a generally spout-like outlet having an<br>
edge 505 that defines a portion of the outlet orifice. In the region of the outlet<br>
edge 505 of the base 401, the recessed portion 502 forms an abutment surface<br>
502b, which, together with the upper part 402, defines an outlet passage/valve<br>
of the dispenser nozzle leading to the outlet orifice formed by edge 505 and a<br>
corresponding edge of the upper portion.<br>
Positioned within recess 502, and just inside the edge 504, is a channel<br>
506, the significance of which will be come apparent in the discussion of<br>
Figures 3 below. Also positioned in the region 502a of the recess 502 is an<br>
inlet opening 503, through which fluid may be drawn into the dispenser nozzle<br>
from the associated container during use. The opening of the inlet 503 is<br>
positioned within a further recess 503 a, the significance of which will again<br>
become apparent in the discussion of Figure 3 below.<br>
The under surface of the upper part 402 is shown in more detail in<br>
Figure 3 (for the purpose of illustration, the upper part shown in Figure 3 is<br>
inverted). The under surface of the upper part 402 is surrounded by lip 601,<br>
which, when the upper part 402 is fitted to the base 401, is received within the<br>
channel 506 to form a tight seal between the base and the upper part, thereby<br>
preventing any fluid leakage occurring at the join between the base 401 and the<br>
upper part 402. The under surface of the upper part extends between the lip<br>
601 and assumes the configuration a substantially dome-shaped recess at 602a,<br>
which aligns with the recessed portion 502a when the base and upper part are<br>
connected together, and extends to form an abutment surface at region 602b,<br>
which contacts the opposing abutment surface 502b of the base 401 in the<br>
assembled dispenser nozzle to define the outlet passageway. The upper part<br>
additionally comprises a flap projection 603 which, when the upper surface is<br>
fitted to the base 401, sits within the recess 503 a and is resiliently biased<br>
against the inlet opening 503. The flap projection 603 forms the resiliently<br>
deformable valve member of the inlet valve.<br>
The internal structure and operation of the dispenser nozzle 400 shown<br>
in Figure 1 will be better understood by referring to the cross-sectional views<br>
shown in Figures 4A and 4B. Referring to Figure 4A, the base 401 comprises<br>
recesses 701 and 702 on it's under surface. The recess 701 comprises a screwthread<br>
(not shown) and is circular in profile so that it can be fitted to a circular<br>
screw-threaded neck opening of a container. The recess 702 on the other hand<br>
is adapted to receive a dip tube 704 and also extends to form the inlet opening<br>
503 of the dispenser valve. The portion 502 of the upper surface 502 of the<br>
base 401, together with the portion 602a under surface of the upper part 402,<br>
defines an internal chamber 700. The portion 502b of the upper surface,<br>
together with the portion 602b of the under surface of the upper part 402<br>
defines an outlet passage which leads to an outlet orifice 403 defined by the<br>
edge 505 of the base and edge 605 of the upper part. Thus, the portion 602a of<br>
the upper part 402 is made from a thin section of rigid plastic capable of<br>
undergoing a resilient deformation. This portion of the body 400 is therefore<br>
the resiliently deformable portion of the body that defines the chamber. The<br>
abutment surface formed by portion 602b of the upper part 402 is also<br>
configured to resiliently deform from the resiliently biased configuration<br>
whereby the outlet passageway is closed, as shown in Figures 4A and 4B, to a<br>
position in which the passageway is open. Thus, the resiliently deformable<br>
outlet passageway effectively forms the outlet valve of the device.<br>
Furthermore, the flap projection 603 of the upper part is received within the<br>
recess 503a surrounding the inlet 505 of the chamber to form an inlet flap<br>
valve, as previously discussed.<br>
Therefore, during use, the resilientiy deformable portion of the upper<br>
part 402, in the region 602a can be deformed downwards by the application of a<br>
pressure by, for example, an operator's finger pressing this region. The<br>
application of a pressure causes the volume of the chamber 700 to reduce and<br>
the pressure therein to increase. When the pressure within the chamber exceeds<br>
a predetermined minimum threshold value, the abutment surface 602b of the<br>
upper part will be caused to deform away from the opposing surface 502b of<br>
the base to define an open outlet passageway through which the fluid present in<br>
the chamber may pass through and be expelled through the outlet 403 of the<br>
dispenser nozzle. It will be appreciated that fluid is prevented from flowing out<br>
of the chamber through the inlet by the flap 603. As fluid is ejected, the<br>
pressure within the chamber 700 will gradually fall as the fluid present within<br>
the chamber is dispensed and when it falls below the minimum threshold value<br>
the resiliently deformable abutment surface of the outlet passageway 602b will<br>
deform back to position whereby it abuts the surface 502b and the and the<br>
outlet passageway is closed.<br>
If the pressure applied to the chamber in the region of 602a is then<br>
removed, the pressure within the chamber will decrease as the chamber deforms<br>
back to the expanded configuration by virtue of its inherent resilience. This<br>
reduction in pressure causes fluid to be drawn into the chamber through the<br>
inlet because the pressure differential between the inlet 503 and the chamber<br>
700 causes the flap projection 603 to be deflected away from the inlet orifice.<br>
Once the portion 602a of the upper part of the body assumes its initial<br>
resiliently biased configuration, the flap projection 603 deforms back to the<br>
position shown in Figure 4A whereby the inlet is closed.<br>
As an alternative, the body of the embodiment shown in Figures 1 to 4<br>
could be manufactured from a flexible plastic material. The dispenser could be<br>
made by any suitable moulding procedure. For example, the base 401 and<br>
upper part 402 could be moulded separately and then connected together either<br>
in the same mould or in separate moulds or, alternatively, one of the parts could<br>
be moulded first and the other part can be moulded onto the first part.<br>
An alternative embodiment of the invention is shown in Figures 5 A and<br>
5B. This embodiment is virtually identical to the embodiment shown in Figures<br>
1 to 4, as shown by the like reference numerals. The sole difference between<br>
this embodiment and the embodiment of Figures 1 to 4 is that the upper part<br>
402 is connected to the base 401 via a hinge or foldable connection 801, as<br>
shown in Figure 5A, which enables the upper part 402 to be folded over to<br>
engage the base 401 to form the assembled dispenser nozzle as shown in Figure<br>
5B. In this embodiment, the upper part is formed entirely from a rigid plastic<br>
material, but, in alternative embodiments, the upper part may comprise a<br>
framework of a rigid plastic (the same as that of the base) to which a flexible<br>
plastic material is over-moulded.<br>
The main advantage of the embodiment shown in Figures 5A and 5B is<br>
that the base 401 and the upper part 402 are integrally formed, which means<br>
that the entire body of the dispenser can be moulded in a single step from a<br>
single material, with all the consequential advantages of reduced costs due to<br>
minimal assembly and processing times. For instance, the dispenser could be<br>
moulded in the open configuration shown in Figure 5A, and the upper part<br>
could then be folded over about the connection element 801 to form the<br>
assembled nozzle device.<br>
Figure 6A shows a further embodiment of the invention, which is<br>
identical to the embodiment shown in Figure 5A, apart from the fact that this<br>
embodiment additionally comprises an air leak valve adapted to permit air to<br>
flow into the container from the outside to equalise any pressure differential<br>
between the container and the external environment that may exist (but prevent<br>
fluid flowing the other way if the container is inverted, for example).<br>
The air leak valve consists of a resiliently deformable valve member<br>
1101, which is received within an opening 1102 of the base when the dispenser<br>
nozzle is assembled, as shown in Figure 6B. The opening 1102, together with<br>
the groove 1103 defines a passageway through which air may flow into the<br>
container from the outside in the assembled dispenser nozzle. The tip of the<br>
resiliently deformable member 1101 is provided with a flared rim, the edges of<br>
which abut the internal walls of the opening 1102 to form an airtight seal. If a<br>
reduced pressure exists in the container as a consequence of expelling fluid<br>
through the dispenser nozzle, the pressure differential between the interior of<br>
the container and the external environment causes the flared rim of the member<br>
1101 to deform inwards, thereby permitting air to flow into the container from<br>
the external environment. Once the pressure differential has been equalised,<br>
the flared rim returns to its original resiliently biased configuration, as shown in<br>
Figure 6B. It shall also be appreciated that if the container is inverted, the<br>
product cannot leak past the rim of the resiliently deformable member 1101 and<br>
any pressure that is applied, by squeezing the container for example, simply<br>
pushes the flared rim into tighter abutment with the walls of the opening 1102.<br>
In an alternative embodiment, the air leak valve may be a post or flap<br>
positioned within a hole which can resiliently deform to open the passageway<br>
when a pressure differential exists, thereby allowing air to flow into the<br>
container from the external environment.<br>
In a further alternative, the resiliently deformable upper part 402 could<br>
comprise a fine slit above an opening similar to opening 1102. This slit could<br>
be configured to open when a pressure differential exists.<br>
In yet another alternative, the air release may be positioned closer to the<br>
resiliently deformable upper part 402 and configured such that, when the upper<br>
part is pressed downwards to expel the contents present in the chamber 700, the<br>
resiliently deformable member deforms in such a way that the air valve is<br>
opened, and air may flow into or out of the chamber to equalise any pressure<br>
differential that may exist.<br>
A further alternative embodiment of a dispenser nozzle of the present<br>
invention is shown in Figure 7. The dispensing device shown in Figure 7<br>
comprises many features of the embodiments previously described, as shown by<br>
the like referenced numerals. However, there are also a number of<br>
modifications.<br>
Specifically, the outlet 403 of the device 1401 has been modified so that<br>
the product is dispensed downwards in the direction of arrow 1405. Of course<br>
it shall be appreciated that the outlet may be configured to dispense the product<br>
at any angle (e.g. at 30-45° to the vertical).<br>
The outlet passageway has also been further adapted to incorporate a<br>
locking means. The locking means comprises a plug 1406 formed on the upper<br>
part 402. The plug extends to form a button 1407 on the upper surface of the<br>
upper part 402, which can be pressed to urge the plug 1406 into a sealing<br>
engagement with the outlet orifice 403, as shown in Figure 7. In this<br>
configuration, the plug 1406 seals the outlet 403 and prevents fluid being<br>
dispensed from the chamber. To release the seal and permit fluid to be<br>
dispensed through the outlet 403, an operator must pull the button 1407<br>
upwards to remove the plug 1406 from the outlet. Once released, the portion<br>
602b of the upper part can resiliency deform away from the abutment surface<br>
of the base 502b to define an open outlet passageway when the chamber is<br>
compressed. This deformation of portion 602b of the upper part when fluid is<br>
flowing towards the outlet 403 also removes the plug from the vicinity of the<br>
outlet 403 to define a passageway that fluid can flow through. As soon as the<br>
contents of the chamber have been dispensed, the portion 602b and the plug<br>
1406 of the upper part will deform back to close the outlet passageway. In this<br>
regard, the plug 1406 sits over the outlet 403 to effectively form a non-return<br>
valve, which prevents any air or product being drawn back into the chamber.<br>
After use, an operator can press the button 1407 to plug the outlet and prevent<br>
any accidental actuation of the device.<br>
A generally L-shaped member 1408 having a Up 1408a hangs down<br>
from the base of the plug 1406 and protrudes through the outlet 403. When the<br>
plug is in a sealing engagement with the outlet 403, as shown in Figure 7, the<br>
lip 1408a is displaced from the underside of the base. However, when the<br>
button 1407 is pulled to remove the plug 1407, the lip 1408a of the member<br>
1408 abuts the underside of the base and prevents the button 1407 being pulled<br>
too far. Any other means of preventing the button 1407 from being pulled too<br>
far can be used.<br>
The seal formed by the ridge 601 being received within a corresponding<br>
groove 506 has also been modified in two respects. Firstly, the seal extends<br>
around the entire perimeter of the chamber 700 and additionally, encompasses<br>
the outlet passageway defined between the abutment surfaces of portion 502b<br>
of the base and 602b of the upper part. Therefore, a complete seal is formed to<br>
prevent fluid seeping between the upper part 402 and the base part 401 and<br>
leaking out of the nozzle. Secondly, the thickness of the ridge protrusion tapers<br>
towards its base and the width of the groove 506 tapers correspondingly<br>
towards its opening. Hence, the ridge 601 can be pushed, or snap fitted, into<br>
the groove 506 to form a tight sealing engagement, which also functions to hold<br>
the upper part 402 the base 401 together. The sides of the male protrusion<br>
member and the corresponding sides of the groove that form the seal can be any<br>
shape including straight, upwards taper, one side straight and other tapered, or<br>
one side of the protrusion may comprise ridge which is received within a<br>
further groove formed in the side wall of the groove etc<br>
The flap valve member 603 at the inlet has also been provided with a<br>
support arm 603 a. The support arm 603 a is configured to resiliency bias the<br>
flap 603 over the inlet orifice and thereby increases the strength of the seal<br>
formed there between, as well as the pressure required to cause the flap 603 to<br>
deform away and open the inlet 503 during use.<br>
The dispenser nozzle shown in Figures 1 to 7 comprise a generally<br>
dome-shaped protrusion on the upper surface, which can be depressed by an<br>
operator to compress the chamber and cause the contents stored therein to be<br>
expelled through the outlet. One potential problem with such designs is that the<br>
operator needs to press the dome using their finger, which requires the operator<br>
to position their finger in the correct location to ensure that the chamber is<br>
compressed and fluid is ejected through the outlet. It has also been found that a<br>
relatively high pressure is required to press the dome to a sufficient extent,<br>
which can be a further disadvantage, especially as it is commonplace for people<br>
to actuate conventional pump dispensers by applying pressure with a different<br>
portion of the their hand, such as using their palm, or even using their elbow or<br>
forearm. In these instances, it would be much more problematical to adequately<br>
compress the dome using, for example, the palm of the hand in order actuate<br>
the ejection of fluid from the device.<br>
Accordingly, further modified embodiments of the present invention<br>
have been developed that can be actuated by an operator using any part of their<br>
hand or arm, one of which is illustrated in Figures 8A and 8B. These figures<br>
show cross-sectional and perspective views, respectively, of an alternative<br>
dispenser nozzle according to the present invention, which solves the<br>
aforementioned problems associated with device shown in Figures 1 to 7. The<br>
dispenser nozzle shown in these Figures is virtually the same as that shown in<br>
Figure 7, except that the dispenser nozzle additionally comprises a handle or<br>
over cap 2001, which is folded over from the front edge of the upper surface of<br>
the base, about a hinged connection 2002 to cover the base 401 and the upper<br>
part 402, as shown in Figure 8a. The leading edge 200la of the handle 2001<br>
extends right over the upper surface of the upper part and is received on a ledge<br>
2003 formed as the rear side of the base. The ledge 2003 prevents the cover<br>
being pushed downwards so that protrusions 2004 compress the chamber 700.<br>
Thus the actuation of the device is inhibited. To release the lock, the sides of<br>
the over cap can be squeezed inwards, as shown by arrows 2005 in Figure 8C,<br>
to displace the edge of the handle 2001 from the ledge. The handle 2001 may<br>
then be depressed to compress the chamber and actuate the dispensing of the<br>
fluid stored therein. The handle 2001 effectively forms a curved surface that<br>
the operator can press to actuate the dispensing of fluid from the chamber. The<br>
handle 2001 may be curved, as shown in Figures 8A, 8C and 8D, or flat.<br>
The chamber 700 and the protrusion 2004 can be moved further forward<br>
to increase the mechanical advantage/efficiency of the device (by effectively<br>
increasing the leverage when the handle is pressed.<br>
Figure 9A shows a dissembled embodiment of s further modified<br>
embodiment of the invention in which the base 401 and upper part 402 are<br>
disconnected from one another. This embodiment is in effect a simplified<br>
version of the embodiment shown in Figures 8a-d. The base 401 is connected<br>
to the upper part 402 by the bendable/foldable connection element 2002 and<br>
can be moulded from a single material and extracted from the mould in the<br>
configuration shown in Figure 9A. As previously described, the upper part can<br>
be swung over and fitted to the upper surface of the base 401 to form an<br>
assembled dispenser nozzle, as shown in Figure 9B.<br>
Referring to Figure 9B, it can be seen that, in the assembled<br>
configuration, the protrusion 601 extending around the perimeter of the upper<br>
surface of the base 401 is received in a sealing engagement with a groove 506<br>
formed in the upper part 402 to form a sealed connection between the base 401<br>
and the upper part 402, and the resiliently deformable flap 603 is received<br>
within the recess formed in the base surrounding the inlet 503 to form the inlet<br>
valve. Both of these arrangements have been previously described above. In<br>
contrast to the previously described embodiments, however, the upper part 402<br>
also possess two elements 2501 which comprise indents 250la adapted to<br>
receive the tips of two pivot protrusions 2502 formed on the upper surface of<br>
the base 401. This arrangement enables the upper part 402 to pivot relative to<br>
the base so that the portion 602a of the upper part can be displaced towards the<br>
portion 502a of the upper surface of the base 401 to compress the chamber 700,<br>
as shown in Figure 9C. The upper part is resiliency biased to assume the<br>
configuration shown in Figure 9B whereby the portions of the base and upper<br>
part that define the chamber 700, namely 502a and 602a respectively, are<br>
displaced from one another so that the chamber 700 assumes its maximum<br>
volume. The resilient bias is provided by the resiliency deformable wall 2504<br>
of the base 401, which can resiliency flex (as shown in Figure 9C) when a<br>
downward force is applied in the direction of arrow 2505, to permit the portions<br>
502a and 602a to corne closer together and reduce the volume of the chamber<br>
700. When the downward force is removed, the wall 2504 returns to its initial<br>
configuration, as shown in Figure 9B.<br>
Thus, an operator can apply a downward force by pressing on the upper<br>
part 402 anywhere in the region 2506 to compress the chamber and cause the<br>
contents stored therein to displace the plug 1406 from the outlet aperture 403<br>
and enable fluid to be dispensed through the outlet 403. The plug 1406<br>
effectively functions as a pre-compression valve as fluid will only be dispensed<br>
from the chamber 700 when the pressure therein is sufficient to displace the<br>
plug 1406 from the outlet orifice. When the downward pressure is removed,<br>
the chamber 700 re-expands as the wall 2504 returns to its original<br>
configuration and the pressure within the chamber will then fall causing more<br>
fluid to be drawn into the chamber through the inlet valve.<br>
The main difference between this embodiment and those previously<br>
described is that the upper part 402 is configured to remain rigid and the wall<br>
2504 of the base is instead configured to deform to permit the chamber to be<br>
compressed. This provides an advantage in that the operator can use any part of<br>
their hand, or even arm, to actuate the dispensing of fluid from the container.<br>
This arrangement also provides and increased mechanical efficiency and<br>
enables the operator to keep in contact with the upper part. The upper part<br>
could be made from a flexible material provided the sides wall 2504 is<br>
configured to deform preferentially.<br>
1 Any suitable outlet valve described herein may be used instead of the<br>
plug 1406. In addition, the device may optionally include a locking member<br>
2510 which is integrally formed with the upper part 402 and can be swung into<br>
abutment with the base 401, as shown in Figure 9B, to prevent the upper part<br>
402 from being able to pivot and compress the chamber 700. Hence, the device<br>
is locked and the accidental actuation will be inhibited. The locking member<br>
2510 can be disengaged from the base 401 to enable the device to be operated<br>
in the manner described above.<br>
In certain embodiments of the invention, a trigger actuator configured to<br>
depress the upper part 402 when the trigger is pulled by an operator may be<br>
provided.<br>
The embodiments shown in Figures 8a-d and 9a-c could be made from a<br>
single, integrally formed component part, as shown, or could be formed from<br>
several separate component parts that are assembled together to form the<br>
device. The device would usually be moulded from a rigid plastic, but could<br>
be moulded entirely from a flexible plastic for certain applications. The<br>
necessary deformability for certain parts of the structure can be provided by<br>
making these required sections of a reduced thickness, which imparts the<br>
necessary deformability characteristics into the design.<br>
Figure 10 shows a further alternative embodiment of the invention that<br>
incorporates a piston cylinder 2301 having a piston 2302 slidably mounted<br>
therein. Movement of the piston to compress the chamber 700, and thereby<br>
expel the contents stored therein, is facilitated by pressing the resiliently<br>
deformable portion of the body 2304, which is connected to the base 401 by a<br>
resilient deformable hinge 2303. Pressing this portion of the body urges the<br>
resiliently mounted piston 2302 inwards to compress the chamber 700. When<br>
the applied pressure is released, the hinge 2303 urges the piston back to its<br>
initial resiliently biased position, as shown in Figure 10.<br>
Figure 11 shows an alternative embodiment of a dispenser nozzle device<br>
of the invention in a dissembled configuration. Instead of comprising a single<br>
chamber, the embodiment shown in Figure 11 comprises two separate internal<br>
chambers formed by the alignment of portions 502a and 602a, as previously<br>
described, and portion 1150a and 115la when the upper part and base are<br>
connected together. Each chamber is provided with a separate inlet and<br>
separate outlet so that fluid can be drawn from separate compartments within<br>
the same container into the respective chambers and dispensed through separate<br>
outlets.<br>
The dispenser nozzle shown in Figure 11 also comprises two air leak<br>
valves, one for equalising the pressure within each separate compartment<br>
within the container to which the dispenser nozzle is attached.<br>
In alternative embodiments, the outlets of each chamber may merge so<br>
that the fluid present in each chamber mix either on or. prior to being dispensed<br>
through a common outlet orifice.<br>
Each chamber may comprise a liquid or the second chamber may<br>
comprise air or another gas instead.<br>
Figure 12A to 12C show various perspective views of dispenser device<br>
according to the present invention. The dispenser device as shown in Figures<br>
12A to 12C is a nasal spray device which comprises an elongate outlet 2401<br>
which is adapted to be inserted into a user's nose. Fluid is stored in an internal<br>
chamber of'the device, which is defined between an upper part 402 and a base<br>
401. Fluid is dispensed by pressing a resilientiy deformable portion of the<br>
upper part 602a to compress chamber and cause fluid to be dispensed through<br>
the outlet 403.<br>
The device may be a single use device whereby the entire contents of the<br>
chamber are dispensed following a single actuation. Alternatively, the chamber<br>
may be provided with an inlet though which a further dose of fluid can be<br>
drawn into the chamber when the applied pressure is released and the resiliently<br>
deformable portion of the body returned to its resiliently biased configuration.<br>
As a further alternative, the entire body of the device may be resiliently<br>
deformable, rather than just the portion 602a, so that the device can be<br>
squeezed between the fingers of an operator to trigger the dispensing of fluid.<br>
It shall be appreciated that the description of the embodiments of the<br>
invention described in reference to the figures is intended to be by way of<br>
