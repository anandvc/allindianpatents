This configuration comprises of machine bed (14) on which Y-axis assembly (53) and X-axis assembly (54) are mounted one over the other, in the front. Here the Y-axis guide-ways (15) are mounted directly on the bed and X-axis guide-ways (16) are mounted on Y-axis assembly (53). Thus the guide-ways of X and Y-axis are built into one another and are not separable. The Z-axis assembly (55) is mounted on vertical column (17), which is fixed on the machine base (14) on the rear side. The Z-axis guide-ways (18) are directly mounted on vertical column (17) and spindle assembly (19) is fixed to Z-axis assembly (55) is built integrally. The Automatic Tool Changer (56) is mounted on the vertical column (17) itself.<br>
