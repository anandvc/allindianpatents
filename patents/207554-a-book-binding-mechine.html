This invention relates to a binding machine.<br>
There are different methods of binding in vogue, like sewing, stitching (pinning) and binding using glue (called perfect binding).<br>
By this invention, however, perfect binding of books is done automatically, with a little manual aid.<br>
Conventionally, binding of books i© done manually. By this invention, however, binding of books i» done automatically, with little manual aid.<br>
Binding can be defined as joining various forms/sheets firmly to form an integral uni t, namely, a book.<br>
The binding machine, according to this invention, comprises a reciprocating carriage provided with means for imparting a forward movement and quick return thereto^ said carriage having a clamp for clamping a set of forms at the loading end of the traverse of the said carriage; a milling station over  which  the  carri age  passes,  said  milling<br><br>
station consisting of a milling cutter for milling the spine portion of the said forms, to expose the fibre of the paper; a gluing station consisting of a glue tank over which the carriage passes, to glue the milled spine of the said forms and also a portion at the sides of the spine; a cover station over which the carriage passes, the said station being provided with a centre plate having means for raising the same to bring it into contact with the glued forms; two nipping plates provided for the centre plate, said nipping plates having means for moving the same towards each other to press against the glued portions at either side of the spine, the carriage thereafter moving towards the delivery end, to open the clamp and release the book, before quick return of the carriage to the loading end. This invention will now be described with reference to the accompanying drawings which i1lustrate<br>
Fig.l illustrates the various stages in the perfect binding system<br><br>
Fig.2 illustrates the general layout of the drive system<br>
Fig.  3 illustrates the tilting mechanism and  the<br>
centre plate and nipping plates assembly<br>
and<br>
Fig.4  illustrates a separate view of  the  centre<br>
plate and nipping plates assembly.<br>
Referring to Fig. 1 the known manual binding procedure is i1lustrated by the four stages of shuff1ing the forms and arranging the same in orders milling the spine of he formsf gluing the forms and finally attaching the cover and nipping the same.<br>
In the binding machine proposed herein, all these operations are done automatically, except for manually inserting the forms in the clamp and cover insertion.<br>
The carriage unit containing the clamping arrangement moves from the feeding or loading mnd of the machine to the delivery mndf passing over the mi 11ing unit, gluing unit and the cover station.<br>
In this machine, exclusive design has been in corporated in the following function.<br>
(1)	Foward and reverse movement of the Carriage along the machine gui^e way.<br>
(2)	Provision of duel speed i.e., fast return and normal forward movements, to increase productivity.<br>
(3)	Carriage clamp opening /closing -made automatic. This will also help to increase productivity.<br>
(4)	In the Cover Station<br>
(a)	Adjustment is not required for the nipping plate opening with different<br>
thickness of the books. Constant nipping pressure is applied, irrespective<br>
orbook thickness.<br>
(b)	The Cover Station centre bed is tillable independently either to the left or<br>
right<br><br>
The details of the design are explained below<br>
1) Carriage Forward and Reverse motion;(Please refer fig: 2)<br>
The Sprockets S1 and S2 are mounted on the drive shaft of the reduction gearbox (1) Coupled to the drive motor. The rollerchains CI and C2 are driven by the above mentioned Sprockets in the direction indicated.<br>
The Carriage is fastened to sprockets S3, S4 and S5 through electromagnetic clutches. The chain CI is passing over the Sprocket S3 and the chain C2 is passing over the Sprocket S4. Due to the difference in number of teeth in S1 and S2 Sprockets, the chain C2 moves at a higher speed compared to chain CI.<br>
At the start i.e. at the book loading point, the electro magnetic clutch on S3 Sprocket is actuated and therefore the Carriage moves at a slower speed up to Cover Station. At this point the clutch on S3 Sprocket is deactivated and the clutch on the sprocket S4 is activated. This causes the Carriage to move faster up to the delivery point.<br>
As soon as it reaches the delivery point, the clutch on Sprocket S4 in deactivated and the clutch on S5 is activated. Since the Sprocket is engaging to the return line of the chain C2, the Carriage comes back at a rapid speed to the book loading point.<br>
At this point, the clutch on S3 Sprocket is reactivated while the Clutch on S5 is deactivated and carriage starts for repeating the cycle.<br>
The mechanism for automatic opening and closing of the Carriage clamp is as follows.<br>
As soon as the Carriage reaches the delivery^ point with the book in clamped condition, the electro magnetic clutch coupled to the Sprocket S6 is activated. The Sprocket S6 drives the two Sprockets S8 and S9 mounted on the lead screw of the Carriage opening mechanism in a clockwise direction. Thus the Clamp on the Carriage gets opened. The Carriage returns to the loading point with the clamp in open condition. Once the book is loaded, through an electronic sensor, the clutch coupled to Sprocket S7 is activated. This also drives the Sprockets S8 and S9 and rotates them in a clockwise direction. Thus the clamp gets closed over the book.<br><br>
COVHR STATION (Please refer fig.3)<br>
The Cover Station mainly consists of a Centre Plate (5) and two side nipping plates (1)&amp;(2).<br>
The cover for the book is placed in position in advance. As the clamp along the forms (after milling and application of glue on the spine) comes above the Cover Station, the Centre Plate along with nipping plates moves up and the cover gets stuck to the spine. Simultaneously the back nipping plate moves forward to a short distance of about 5 mm. The front nipping plate moves forward till it presses the Spine of the book against the back nipping plate. Thus the cover is glued firmly to the Spine and to a small portion to the sides of the book.<br>
The unique design feature in this arrangement is that there is no need for setting the gap between the back and front nipping plates. The back nipping plate moves forward a little to support the book and then the front nipping plate moves toward the book .The back nipping plate is actuated by a Cam (4) through a roller follower (9). It is guided along a support shaft (7). Linear Bearing (8) is used for smooth sliding operation. The unique design feature in this arrangement is that<br>
1)	Only one drive motor is used for both upward motion of the Centre Plate along with nipping plates as well as the movement of the nipping plates to press the Spine of the book.<br>
2)	The tilt of the Cover Station Centre Plate is adjustable independently on both right and left sides.<br>
3)	There is no need for pre-setting the gap between the back and front nipping<br>
plate to suit different thickness of books.	*<br>
The relevant mechanism is described below.<br>
The motor (21) drives the shaft (18) through pulleys (13) and (10), and the belt (11). The Cam (3) actuates the lifting lever (15) through the Cam follower (6), mounted on the tilting plate (14). The Centre Plate (5) is fixed to the lifting lever on both ends.<br>
As the Cam rotates in the direction shown, the Centre Plate along with the Nipping Plates moves up.<br>
The back nipping plate movement is obtained by means of the Cam (4) and follower (9), which is linked firmly to the back nipping plate. The Cam is mounted on a shaft (17), which gets the drive through the Cam shaft (18), by means of a set of Gears (12).<br><br>
The front nipping plate gets the movement through a rack (19) and pinion (20) of which the latter is keyed to the Camshaft. The Camshaft is driven by the motor (21); through pulleys 10 and 13 and the belt (11), The front nipping plate moves forward when the shaft is turned by the motor. When the front nipping plate encounters resistance beyond a certain value, the belt (11) on the pulley (13) slips there by the front nipping plate stops at that position. The holding time of nipping plates in the closed position is controlled by an electronic circuit and is variable from 1 to 5 seconds.<br>
The mechanism for independent tilt control of the Centre Plate is as follows:<br>
The knob with the Screw (22), when turned oscillates the tilting plate (14) as indicated by the arrows. This will change the position of the Cam follower (6) with respect to the top of the Centre Plate .A similar arrangement has been given in the other side of the Centre plate. Thus independent tilt control is possible.<br><br><br><br>
