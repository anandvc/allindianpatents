				<td>Field to which the invention relates<br>
This invention relates to a method for purifying polypeptides and to products obtained by<br>
the method. In particular, though not exclusively, the invention relates to a method for<br>
purifying polypeptides which have to fold before they are biologically active such as the<br>
tyrosine kinase receptors TrkA, TrkB and TrkC and biologically active variants and<br>
portions thereof (all referred to as "tyrosine kinase receptor-related polypeptides").<br>
Background<br>
The tyrosine kinase receptors TrkA, TrkB and TrkC bind neurotrophins. TrkA is<br>
biologically active in that it binds nerve growth factor (NGF) with high affinity. It is also<br>
biologically active in that it binds neurotrophin-3 (NT3) with high affinity. TrkB and TrkC<br>
bind other neurotrophins. TrkB binds brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) and<br>
neurotrophin-4 (NT4) with high affinity. TrkC binds NT3 with high affinity. The<br>
identification, cloning and sequencing of TrkB and TrkC are described in US6027927.<br>
Each receptor molecule comprises a number of regions or domains. The<br>
immunoglobulin-like domains (Ig) of the tyrosine kinase receptor molecule are of<br>
particular interest in therapeutic applications. More particularly, as disclosed in the<br>
applicant's co-pending patent application, WO99/53055, TrkAIg2 and variants, such as the<br>
splice variant TrkAIg26, have therapeutic application.<br>
There is a need to produce polypeptides derived from the tyrosine kinase receptors on a<br>
large scale, particularly for therapeutic applications. Production of recombinant<br>
polypeptides in bacterial expression systems is advantageous for several reasons,<br>
particularly because relatively high yields of polypeptide can be obtained. Typically yields<br>
can be ten times higher than in human cell systems.<br>
However, the expressed polypeptides such as TrkAIg2, the second immunoglobulin-like<br>
domain of TrkA, are difficult to work with in that they tend to be produced as a mixture of<br>
monomer, dimer and aggregate (i.e. aggregated dimer which may include monomer<br>
amongst the dimer) In particular in the case of TrkAIg2, but also in the cases of TrkBIg2<br>
and TrkCIg2, only the monomer is, however, active and therefore therapeutically useful. As<br>
discussed in Robertson A.G. S. et al (Biochemical and Biophysical Research<br>
Communications 282 (1): 131-141 Mar 23 2001) dimers of TrkAIg2 are not able to bind<br>
NGF and are not biologically active. It is likely that small amounts of dimer or aggregate<br>
seed the production of more aggregate leading to a decrease in amount of biologically<br>
active monomer. This is unusual, many proteins exist in an equilibrium between monomer,<br>
dimer and even tetramer, (e.g. human growth hormone). The removal of dimer is crucial to<br>
a long term stable preparation, which is a requirement for pharmaceutical formulation. Like<br>
many proteins, correct conformation of the tyrosine receptor-related polypeptide is<br>
important for biological activity. When expressed in a bacterial inclusion body the<br>
polypeptide is folded, but in an incorrect biologically inactive conformation. After<br>
expression in a recombinant system the polypeptide must be folded again to achieve that<br>
correct conformation. This further folding after expression is sometimes referred to as<br>
"refolding".<br>
We are only aware of two other groups that have tried to make recombinant TrkAIg2 in<br>
bacterial cells. Ultsch et al (J Mol Biol (1999) 290, 149-159) made TrkAIg2, TrkBIg2 and<br>
TrkCIg2. They made the TrkAIg2 as soluble protein, rather than in inclusion bodies, purified<br>
it by ion exchange, then hydrophobic interaction, ion exchange again and gel filtration. The<br>
gel filtration step here was not to allow refolding of the polypeptide - it would be assumed<br>
that the polypeptide was already correctly folded as it was in soluble form. TrkBIg2 and<br>
TrkCIg2, although expressed in the same way, were insoluble. They were solubilised in<br>
urea and dialysed to allow refolding and further purified by ion exchange. Solution of<br>
crystal structures of the resulting TrkAIg2, TrkBIg2 and TrkCIg2 revealed strand swapped<br>
dimers i.e. dimers where strand A of one monomer is paired with strand B of another<br>
monomer (see the accompanying Fig. 1). Fig. 1 shows a strand" swapped dimer consisting<br>
of two TrkAIg2 monomers in which the A strand from monomer X unfolds and binds with<br>
the B strand from monomer Y. Conversely the A strand from monomer Y unfolds and<br>
binds with the B strand from monomer X. These are inactive. In their discussion it was<br>
indicated that none of the dimers produced were capable of binding to the natural ligands,<br>
in contrast to the domains expressed as immunoadhesins in 293 cells (Urfer et al (1995)<br>
EMBO Journal 14, 12, p2795-2805). The apparent NGF binding activity of the TrkAIg2 -<br>
immunoadhesin molecule constructs in animal cells was probably due to the large<br>
immunoadhesion scaffold (the Fc portion of IgG) holding the TrkAIg2 region in a correct<br>
conformation, which would lead to extensive glycosylation, and would also be likely to<br>
significantly affect the binding of the construct to other molecules.<br>
Windisch et al (Windisch, J M. et al (1995) J. Biol Chem. 270 47 p28133-28138) produced<br>
TrkA derivatives including TrkAIg2 as maltose binding protein fusion constructs which<br>
were inactive and therefore would not be suitable for therapeutic use. Maltose binding<br>
protein constructs are used with "difficult" proteins. It was assumed that the constructs had<br>
folded correctly but it is now apparent that this was not the case.<br>
Wiesmann et al (Nature, 9th September 1999 401, 184-188) could only produce a<br>
co-crystal of NGF and TrkAIg2 by adding together NGF and TrkAIg1,2 i.e. a polypeptide<br>
comprising both Ig-like domains of TrkA. Over a period of many months the TrkAIg1<br>
region was 'nibbled' away leaving only the TrkAIg2 region bound to the NGF. Such a<br>
method is not suitable for commercial level production of tyrosine kinase receptor related<br>
polypeptides.<br>
One method of producing biologically active portions and derivatives of tyrosine kinase<br>
receptor-related polypeptides in inclusion bodies in Escherichia coli is disclosed in Holden<br>
et al (Holden, P.H. et al NatureBiotechnology, 15, July 1997 page 668- 672). This method<br>
involves a dialysis step, after extraction of the polypeptide from the inclusion bodies, to<br>
allow the expressed polypeptide to refold, and results in a yield of only about 16 mg/litre of<br>
polypeptide. WO99/53055 discloses a similar method of purifying portions and derivatives<br>
of TrkA, including TrkAIg2, from E. coli inclusion bodies in which the extracted<br>
polypeptide is also dialysed. This method leads to a yield of about ~ 50 mg/litre. This<br>
method produces a product which is relatively unstable, having to be snap frozen after<br>
production, and before it can be used further.<br>
As noted above, the methods described in Ultsch et al, WO99/53055 and in Holden et al<br>
involve a dialysis step. Dialysis is relatively disadvantageous in that it requires large<br>
amounts of dialysis buffer in order to limit the concentration of polypeptide (usually to<br>
about 0.1 mg/ml) and to limit aggregation of the polypeptide. The amount of dialysis buffer<br>
involved precludes the use of a method of producing tyrosine kinase receptor-related<br>
polypeptides involving dialysis on a commercially-useful scale.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a method of producing polypeptides,<br>
particularly tyrosine kinase receptor-related polypeptides, which provides improved yields<br>
compared to prior art processes. It is a further object of the present invention to provide a<br>
method which provides a product with improved stability compared to prior art processes.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
According to one aspect of the invention there is provided a method of producing tyrosine<br>
kinase receptor-related polypeptides, the method comprising expressing a tyrosine kinase<br>
receptor-related polypeptide in a recombinant expression system and separating expressed<br>
monomeric tyrosine kinase receptor-related polypeptide from multimeric form(s) of the<br>
expressed polypeptide in a separation step, the separation step allowing refolding of the<br>
expressed tyrosine kinase receptor-related polypeptide into a biologically active form.<br>
The method is advantageous over known processes for several reasons. First, the method<br>
produces significantly higher yields than known processes. Second, the method is scalable<br>
allowing production of polypeptide at commercially useful levels. Third, the method does<br>
not require a separate dialysis-based refolding step. Dialysis requires large amounts of<br>
expensive dialysis buffer since it requires refolding at low polypeptide concentrations, and<br>
a lengthy period of time for refolding. Methods involving a dialysis step require a recovery<br>
step for capture of the polypeptide. This can be done for instance by ion exchange or<br>
affinity separation. The use of ion exchange requires increased levels of NaCl to elute<br>
product; this is disadvantageous in that it causes further aggregation of the polypeptide.<br>
The use of affinity separation for example using a His tag on a nickel chelating column also<br>
requires relatively high NaCl levels and elution with irnidazole requires gel filtration to<br>
remove. Fourth, the process is much quicker than prior art processes involving dialysis,<br>
which is usually done overnight. Fifth, the product of the method is more stable. Rather<br>
than having to be snap frozen immediately after production, it can be kept normally<br>
refrigerated (at about 4°C) and is biologically active for at least three months. As the<br>
product has lower dimer levels there is less tendency for aggregation seeded by dimers to<br>
take place. Sixth, the product can be produced at higher concentrations (up to 650µM)<br>
without strand swap dimers being produced. Seventh, as the polypeptide product is not in<br>
contact with urea for the lengthy periods required during a dialysis procedure it is less<br>
likely to be amidated. Amidation can affect biological activity. It may also make it more<br>
difficult to couple the polypeptide to matrices using amine coupling methods. This makes<br>
products of the method of the present invention more useful in certain applications such as<br>
biosensors.<br>
The tyrosine kinase receptor may be native TrkA, TrkB, TrkC; or a biologically active<br>
homologue, variant, portion of those receptors or a construct including a homoiogue,<br>
variant, or portion thereof. Preferably the polypeptide is selected from TrkAIg2 and<br>
TrkBIg2. Particularly preferred polypeptides for production by the method of the present<br>
invention are the Ig2 subdomains of the TrkA, TrkB, and TrkC receptors. Most preferably<br>
the polypeptide is TrkAIg2 or TrkAIg2.6.<br>
Preferred constructs may include additional C terminal sequence from the corresponding<br>
native receptor.<br>
The polypeptide may be expressed with a histidine tag sequence. The tyrosine kinase<br>
sequence is preferably human. The tyrosine kinase receptor-related polypeptide may be<br>
expressed in insoluble form. Preferably the tyrosine kinase receptor-related polypeptide is<br>
expressed in bacterial inclusion bodies. The multimeric forms of the polypeptide may<br>
include dimers. The polypeptide is preferably able to bind a ligand of the corresponding<br>
native tyrosine kinase receptor with high affinity.<br>
The separation step preferably involves gel filtration. The separation step is preferably<br>
carried out at a salt concentration between 0 mM and 500 mM, and more preferably above<br>
25 mM and below 200 mM, most preferably at a salt concentration of about 100 mM, for<br>
example in the range 80 mM to 120 mM. The gel used in the gel filtration step is preferably<br>
able to separate molecules having a molecular weight of about 12 to 40 kDa. The gel may<br>
be for example Sephacryl 200, SuperDex 75 or SuperDex 200.<br>
The separation step is preferably carried out at an alkaline pH. Preferably, the separation<br>
step is carried out at a pH below one where denaturation occurs. For example, the step may<br>
be carried out at typically between pH 8 and 9. Most preferably, the filtration step is<br>
carried out at about pH 8.5. This is unexpected in the case of TrkA as TrkAIg2 has a<br>
calculated P; of between 4.6 and 6.0 dependant on the program used for the calculation.<br>
TrkAIg2 has a high level of ß sheet and most proteins like this aggregate and precipitate<br>
near their pI. TrkAIg2, however, precipitates and aggregates at pH's around physiological<br>
pH, and significantly different from its pI and at salt concentrations that normally maintain<br>
such proteins in solution.<br>
In a preferred arrangement, polypeptide is eluted from the gel filtration step at a flow rate<br>
of about 2.5 ml/min, and monomer is collected after about 93 minutes. This will, however,<br>
vary according to the apparatus and conditions under which it is operated. Preferably, the<br>
polypeptide is produced in a bacteria-based expression system.<br>
According to a preferred aspect of the invention there is provided a method of purifying<br>
recombinant TrkAIg2 or TrkAIg2.6 from inclusion bodies in a bacterial expression system in<br>
which monomeric TrkAIg2 is separated from a mixture including monomeric and<br>
multimeric TrkAIg2 by a gel filtration step and allowed to refold into a biologically active<br>
form. Typically, the multimeric TrkAIg2 will comprise dimeric TrkAIg2.<br>
The invention also provides a stable preparation of TrkAIg2 obtained, or obtainable, by a<br>
method according to the invention and comprising less than 20% of TrkAIg2 dimer or<br>
dimer aggregate, more preferably less than 1% of TrkAIg2 dimer or dimer aggregate, most<br>
preferably less than 0.1% of TrkAIg2 dimer or dimer aggregate.<br>
The invention also provides a stable preparation of TrkAIg2 obtained, or obtainable, by a<br>
method according to the invention and comprising more than 80% TrkAIg2 monomer, more<br>
preferably more than 99% TrkAIg2 monomer, most preferably 100% TrkAIg2 monomer.<br>
Preferably, the monomer is substantially all in a biologically active form.<br>
The invention also provides a preparation of TrkAIg2.6 obtained, or obtainable, by a<br>
method according to the invention and comprising less than 20% of TrkAIg2.6 dimer or<br>
dimer aggregate, more preferably less than 1% of TrkAIg2.6 dimer or dimer aggregate, most<br>
preferably less than 0.1% of TrkAIg2 dimer or dimer aggregate.<br>
The invention also provides a stable preparation of TrkAIg2.6 obtained or obtainable, by a<br>
method according to the invention and comprising more than 80% TrkAIg2.6 monomer,<br>
more preferably more than 99% TrkAIg2.6 monomer, most preferably 100% TrkAIg2.6<br>
monomer. Preferably, the monomer is substantially all in a biologically active form.<br>
The invention also provides a stable preparation of TrkBIg2 obtained, or obtainable, by a<br>
method according to the invention comprising less than 20% of TrkBIg2 dimer or dimer<br>
aggregate, more preferably less than 1% of TrkBIg2 dimer or dimer aggregate, most<br>
preferably less than 0.1% of TrkBIg2 dimer or dimer aggregate.<br>
The invention also provides a stable preparation of TrkBIg2 obtained, or obtainable, by a<br>
method according to the invention comprising more than 80% TrkBIg2 monomer, more<br>
preferably more than 99% TrkBIg2 monomer, most preferably 100% TrkBIg2 monomer.<br>
Preferably, the monomer is substantially all in a biologically active form.<br>
The invention also provides a stable preparation of TrkCIg2 obtained, or obtainable, by a<br>
method according to the invention and comprising less than 20% of TrkCIg2 dimer or<br>
dimer aggregate, more preferably less than 1% of TrkCIg2 dimer or dimer aggregate, most<br>
preferably less than 0.1% of TrkCIg2 dimer or dimer aggregate.<br>
The invention also provides a stable preparation of TrkCIg2 obtained, or obtainable, by a<br>
method according to the invention and comprising more than 80% TrkCIg2 monomer, more<br>
preferably more than 99% TrkCIg2 monomer, most preferably 100% TrkCIg2 monomer.<br>
Preferably, the monomer is substantially all in a biologically active form.<br>
According to another aspect of the invention there is provided a method of producing<br>
immunoglobulin-like polypeptide monomers from a mixture of monomeric and multimeric<br>
forms of the polypeptide, the method comprising expressing the polypeptide in a<br>
recombinant expression system and separating polypeptide monomers from multimeric<br>
forms of the polypeptide in a separation step, the separation step allowing the polypeptide<br>
to refold to a biologically active form. Thus the invention provides a method of purifying<br>
immunoglobulin-like polypeptides which has some or all of the advantages described<br>
above. The separation step preferably includes gel filtration.<br>

Specific Description<br>
Production of histidine-tagged Trklgs<br>
Production of recombinant TrkAIg2 6His and TrkAIg2.6 6His polypeptide<br>
Recombinant TrkAIg26His was produced in E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells using the method<br>
described in WO99/53055 in the section headed "Expression of TrkAIg1,2, TrkAIg1 and<br>
TrkAIg2" and incorporating a 6-histidine tag to the N-terminus of the polypeptide as shown<br>
in Fig. 2A. Recombinant TrkAIg2.6 6His was prepared in a similar manner.<br>
Purification and refolding of TrkAIg2 6His polypeptide<br>
The harvested cells were resuspended in 10% glycerol, frozen at -70°C in liquid nitrogen<br>
and the resulting pellet was passed three times through an XPress (AB Biox). The extract<br>
was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm, 4°C for 30 min to pellet the insoluble inclusion bodies<br>
containing the recombinant polypeptide.<br>
The inclusion bodies were washed in 500 ml 1% (v/v) Triton X-100, 10 mM TrisHCl<br>
pH8.0, 1mM EDTA followed by 500 ml 1M NaCl, 10 mM TrisHCl pH 8.0, 1mM EDTA<br>
and finally 10 mM TrisHCl pH8.0, lmM EDTA.<br>
The inclusion bodies were then solubilised in 20 mM Na Phosphate, 30 mM Imidazole, 8M<br>
Urea (pH 7.4) and clarified by centrifugation. 6M Guamdinium may also be used in place<br>
of 8M urea throughout.<br>
The resulting mixture was loaded on a 5 ml HisTrap column(Pharmacia), and washed with<br>
50 ml 20 mM NaPhosphate, 30 mM Imidazole, 8M Urea pH 7.4. The purified TrkAIg26His<br>
was eluted with 25 ml 20 mM NaPhosphate, 300 mM Imidazole, 8M Urea (pH7.4).<br>
In order to allow the purified recombinant TrkAIg26His polypeptide to refold, the eluant of<br>
the previous step was then applied to a SuperDex 200 gel filtration column, and<br>
equilibrated in 20 mM NaPhosphate, 100 mM NaCl, at pH 8.5. The column had a height of<br>
65cm, width 2.6cm and volume of 345ml when pre-packed by the manufacturer. The flow<br>
rate at maximum pressure was 2.5 ml/min.<br>
Any aggregate (i.e. dimer aggregates) eluted in the void volume. Dimer was eluted after<br>
about 80 min and monomer eluted after about 93 min. The elution time of a protein will be<br>
dependent on dimensions of column and is dependent on its size. This is described by the<br>
following formula:<br>
R = VO/Ve<br>
where R is retention coefficient of a protein, Ve is the volume at which the protein is<br>
eluted, VO is void volume<br>
where Ve = 232.5ml VO is 122ml<br>
122/232.5 = 0.53<br>
TrkAIg2 6His monomer on a SuperDex 200 gel has a retention coefficient of 0.53.<br>
By way of comparison the polypeptide was also folded by dialysis first against 20 mM<br>
TrisHCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.5, recaptured on a His Trap column and eluted with 25 ml 20<br>
mM NaPhosphate, 300 mM Imidazole, 8M Urea pH 7.4.<br>
Purification traces from the Biocad Sprint FPLC (Biocad) which show elution of monomer;<br>
dimer and aggregates of TrkAIg26His under various conditions were prepared. Figure 3<br>
shows an overlay trace comparing elution of TrkAlg26His with refolding by dialysis<br>
("Dialysis") and with refolding on a column in a method according to the invention<br>
("SuperDex"). It will be seen that the method of the invention produces higher levels of<br>
monomer compared to the prior art process.<br>
The splice variant TrkAIg2.66His was prepared and purified in a similar manner.<br>
Effect of pH on elution of TrkAIg26His<br>
TrkAIg26His was expressed in E, coli as described above. Purified inclusion bodies were<br>
solubilised in 20 mM Na Phosphate, 30 mM Imidazole, 8M Urea pH 7.4 and clarified by<br>
centrifugation. The resulting mutant was affinity purified on HisTrap column and eluted<br>
with 25 ml 20 mM NaPhosphate, 300 mM Imidazole, 8M Urea pH 7.4. The eluted<br>
TrkAIg26His was applied to SuperDex 200 gel filtration column (Pharmacia) and<br>
equilibrated in 20 mM NaPhosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.5. The flow rate was 2.5<br>
ml/min. The time taken for elution is determined by size of protein. Peaks of monomer,<br>
dimer and aggregate are indicated at approximately 93 minutes, 80 minutes and 50 minutes<br>
respectively. The results are given in Fig. 4 whichshows the results of elution at pH7.4, 8.0,<br>
8.5 and 9.0. The results indicate that pH 8.5 was best with the greatest yield, lowest amount<br>
of aggregate, and highest levels of monomer.<br>
Comparative Example: Separation of TrkAIg26His monomer, dimer and aggregate<br>
with refold by dialysis. Amount of dialysis buffer required. Subsequent analysis by<br>
elution from SuperDex 200.<br>
TrkAIg26His was expressed in E. coli. Purified inclusion bodies were solubilised in 20<br>
mM NaPhosphate, 30 mM Imidazole, 8M Urea pH 7.4 and clarified by centrifugation. The<br>
solution was affinity purified on HisTrap column and eluted with 25 ml 20 mM<br>
NaPhosphate, 300 mM Imidazole, 8M Urea pH 7.4. TrkAIg26His was folded by dialysis<br>
(using 1 litre, 2 litres or 4 litres) overnight against 20 mM TrisHCl, 50 mM NaCl, pH 8.5,<br>
recaptured on a HisTrap column and eluted with 25 ml 20 mM NaPhosphate, 50 mM<br>
EDTA, 8M Urea pH 7.4. Final analysis was using a SuperDex 200 gel filtration column<br>
equilibrated in 20 mM NaPhosphate, 100 mM NaCl, pH 8.5. Flow rate was 2.5 ml/min.<br>
2-4 litres were required for washing. 4 litres gave the highest yield of monomer: This<br>
shows how large volumes of buffer are needed if dialysis is to be used for refolding of the<br>
expressed polypeptide.<br>
Results are shown in Fig. 5.<br>
Characterisation of TrkAIg26His and TrkAIg2.66His Produced by Method of the<br>
Invention<br>
The expressed TrkAIg26His (A) and TrkAIg2.66His (B) polypeptides were subjected to<br>
MALDITOF mass spectrometry and the results are shown in Fig. 6. The molecular mass of<br>
the polypeptides was determined using a PE Biosystems Voyager-DE STR Matrix-Assisted<br>
Laser Desorption Time-of-Flight (MALDITOF) mass spectrometer with a nitrogen laser<br>
operating at 337nm. The matrix solution was freshly prepared sinapinic acid at a<br>
concentration of lmg/100µl in a 50:50 mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic<br>
acid. 0.5µl of sample and matrix were spotted onto the sample plate. The sample was<br>
calibrated against Calmix 3 (PE Biosystems) run as a close external standard. The spectrum<br>
was acquired over the range 5000-80,000Da, under linear conditions with an accelerating<br>
voltage of 25,000V, an extraction time of 750nsecs and laser intensity of 2700.<br>
The molecular weight of TrkAIg26His was found to be 15,717.96 Da. This is almost<br>
exactly as predicted by theoretical calculation of the molecular weight (15716.3 Da, after<br>
loss of the N-terminal methionine, which we have previously found to be removed in<br>
proteins incorporating the 6 histidine tag from the expression vector pET15b).<br>
The molecular weight of TrkAIg2.66His was found to be 16,575.3 Da. This is almost<br>
exactly as predicted by theoretical calculation of the molecular weight (16,574.4 Da).<br>
Stability<br>
TrkAIg26His and TrkAIg2.66His produced as described above has remained stable when<br>
kept at 4°C for three months and has retained its biological activity.<br>
Improvements in stability may be achieved using conventional additives such as glycerol.<br>
Biological activity of TrkAIg26His produced by the method of the invention<br>
i Guinea pig hind limb pain responses<br>
Biological activity of TrkAIg2 6His produced by the method of the invention was tested in<br>
guinea pigs (Djouhri, L. et al (2001) J. Neuroscience 21 p8722-8733). CFA (Complete<br>
Freund's Adjuvant) was injected into the hind limb and knee of guinea pigs. This causes<br>
inflammation which leads to an increase of NGF levels. This makes the animal more<br>
susceptible to feeling pain. Intracellular recordings were made from the cell bodies of L6<br>
(lumbar), and S1 (sacral) DRG neurons with glass microelectrodes and action potentials<br>
were evoked by stimulation of DRG with a pair of platinum electrodes. The recordings<br>
were made 1, 2 and 4 days after CFA administration. The C and AS fibres are nociceptive<br>
- they transmit pain signals to the brain, a and ß fibres do not. Spontaneous firing of<br>
nociceptive neurons without outside stimulation is thought to be responsible for<br>
inflammatory and neuropathic pain in humans.<br>
TrkAIg26His was injected on days 2, 3 and 4 with 0.45µg into hind limb and knee on<br>
guinea pig. Adding TrkAIg26His, which sequesters the endogenous NGF, abolished<br>
CFA-induced increases in following frequency and in spontaneous firing. This meant<br>
complete cessation of abnormal pain.<br>
TrkAIg26His was therefore able to inhibit pain response in CFA induced pain fibre firing in<br>
guinea pigs.<br>
ii PC12 cell bioassays<br>
Biological activity of TrkAIg26His produced by the method of the invention was tested by<br>
PC 12 neurite outgrowth bioassay. PC 12 cells are a rat phaeochromocytoma cell line which<br>
grow neurites in response to the presence of NGF, which binds receptors present on the cell<br>
surface. PC 12 cells were plated out at 2x104 cells per well in complete DMEM medium<br>
(including 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 µg/ml streptomycin, 10% horse serum, 10% Foetal<br>
Calf Serum (FCS) and 2 mM glutamine) on collagen-coated 24-well plates. NGF was<br>
added at Ing/ml and TrkAIg26His was added at varying concentrations. Results are shown<br>
in Figure 11, photographs of neurite outgrowth after 48 hours. Cells were fixed before<br>
photographing. Fig. 11A shows neurite outgrowth with 1ng/ml NGF and Fig. 11B shows<br>
no neurite outgrowth when 1.25µm TrkAIg26His is added.<br>
TrkAIg26His was therefore able to prevent neurite growth in response to NGF in the PC 12<br>
cell line.<br>
Sub-cloning of the TrkBIg26His domain<br>
The TrkBIg26His protein comprises residues 286 to 430 of the mature protein, and has a<br>
further 21 residues at the NH2 terminus which constitute the histidine expression tag and<br>
associated thrombin cleavage sequence. cDNA coding for the TrkBIg26His domain was<br>
PCR amplified from XZAP-pBluescriptllSK(-)/TrkB, a non-catalytic form of human TrkB<br>
cloned by us (Allen et al (1994) Neuroscience 60 p825-834). Primers (MWG Biotech)<br>
incorporated a Ndel site in the forward primer<br>
(CGCATATGGCACCAACTATCACATTTCTCGAATCTC), and a BamHI site in the<br>
reverse primer:<br>
(GCGGATCCCTATTAATGRRCCCGACCGGTTTTATC).<br>
The PCR product was subcloned into pET15b (Novagen), using Ndel and BamHI sites, to<br>
create the expression vector pET15b-TrkBIg2 6His.<br>
A truncated version of TrkBIg26His, shown in Fig 2B, was also produced in exactly the<br>
same way but using the amino acids 286-383. This form was co-crystallised with its ligand<br>
NT4 and an X-ray crystal structure solved.<br>
Production of recombinant TrkBIg2 6His polypeptide<br>
Electro-competent E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pET15b-TrkBIg2, and<br>
expression was carried out in accordance with the pET (Novagen) manual. After<br>
transformation, E. coli cell lysates were analysed by SDS-PAGE for expression of the 18.5<br>
kDa protein. TrkBIg26His protein was expressed at high levels in the urea-soluble fraction,<br>
but not in the other fractions. 2ml of 2YT broth (containing 200µg/ml ampicillin) was<br>
inoculated with a colony and grown at 37°C to mid log phase. This was used to inoculate<br>
50ml of 2YT broth (containing 200 µg/ml ampicillin), which was grown at 37°C to mid log<br>
phase. This was used to inoculate 5 litres of 2YT broth (containing 200 µg/ml ampicillm),<br>
which was grown to an optical density of 1.0 at 600 nm. 1mM IPTG was added to induce<br>
protein expression and cells were grown overnight at 37°C. The harvested cells were<br>
resuspended in 10% glycerol and frozen at -80°C (8 pellets). Pellets were lysed by passing<br>
3 times through an Xpress, then washed with 20 mM sodium phosphate buffers (pH 8.5)<br>
containing, in succession, 0.1M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and finally 1M NaCl. This<br>
removed all soluble matter, leaving inclusion bodies containing insoluble protein.<br>
Refolding of TrkBIg26His polypeptide<br>
Insoluble TrkBIg26His protein contained in the inclusion bodies was released from the cells<br>
with an Xpress, and washed to remove soluble matter. The purified inclusion bodies were<br>
solubilised in 8M urea buffer (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.5, 1mM<br>
ß-mercaptoethanol), with a "Complete" proteinase inhibitor cocktail tablet (Roche) and<br>
incubated at room temperature for 2 hours with gentle shaking. 6M Guanidinium may be<br>
substituted for 8M urea. TrkBIg26His protein was purified on a HisTrap nickel column<br>
(Pharmacia), under reducing conditions (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.5, 8M urea, 10<br>
mM imidazole), and eluted using 300 mM imidazole. Refolding took place under<br>
non-reducing conditions (20 mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.5, 100 mM NaCl) on a<br>
SuperDex 200 gel-filtration column (Pharmacia). Fractions from the peak corresponding to<br>
a molecular weight of approximately 18.5 kDa were pooled; these contained TrkBIg26His<br>
monomer.<br>
Characterisation of TrkBIg26His produced by Method of the Invention<br>
The molecular mass of TrkBIg26His was determined using a PE Biosystems Voyager-DE<br>
STR MALDITOF mass spectrometer, with a nitrogen laser operating at 337nm. The<br>
matrix solution was freshly prepared sinapinic acid at a concentration of 1mg/100 µl in a<br>
50:50 mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoroacetic acid. 0.5µl of sample and matrix<br>
were spotted onto the sample plate. The sample was calibrated against Calmix 3 (PE<br>
Biosystems) run as a close external standard. The spectrum was acquired over the range<br>
5000-80,000 Da, under linear conditions with an accelerating voltage of 25,000V, an<br>
extraction time of 750 ns and a laser intensity of 2700. Results are shown in Fig. 10.<br>
The molecular weight of TrkBIg26His was found to be 18,451.7 Da. This is almost exactly<br>
as predicted by theoretical calculation of the molecular weight (18,449.1 Da).<br>
Sub-Cloning of recombinant TrkCIg26His domain<br>
The TrkCIg26His protein comprises residues 300 to 399 of the mature protein, and has a<br>
further 21 residues at the NH2 terminus which constitute the histidine expression tag and<br>
associated thrombin cleavage sequence. cDNA coding for the TrkCIg26His domain was<br>
PCR amplified using a forward primer which incorporated a Ndel site<br>
(CGCATATGACTGTCTACTATCCCCCAC) and a reverse primer which incorporated a<br>
BamH1 site (GCGGATCCTTATCAGGGCTCCTTGAGGAAGTGGC). The PCR<br>
product was subcloned into pET15b (Novagen) using Ndel and BamHl restriction sites, to<br>
create the expression vector pET15b-TrkCIg26His.<br>
Production of recombinant TrkCIg26His polypeptide<br>
Electrocompetent E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pET15b-TrkCIg26His<br>
and expression was carried out in accordance with pET (Novagen) manual. After<br>
transformation E. coli lysates were anaylsed by SDS-PAGE for expression of the 13.8kDa<br>
protein. TrkCIg26His protein was expressed at high levels in the urea-soluble fraction but<br>
not in other fractions. 2ml of 2YT broth (containing 200 µg/ml ampicillin), was inoculated<br>
with a colony which was grown at 37°C to mid log phase. This was used to inoculate 50ml<br>
of 2YT broth (containing 200 µg/ml amplicillin) which was grown at 37°C to mid log<br>
phase. This was used to inoculate 5 litres of 2YT broth (containing 200 µg/ml ampicillin),<br>
which was grown to an optical density of 1.0 at 600nm. 1mM IPTG was added to induce<br>
protein expression and cells were grown overnight at 37°C. The harvested cells were<br>
resuspended in 10% glycerol and frozen at -80°C (8 pellets). Pellets were lysed by passing<br>
3 times through an Xpress, and then washed with 20mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH8.0)<br>
containing, in succession, 0.1M NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, and finally 1M NaCl. This<br>
removed all soluble matter, leaving inclusion bodies containing insoluble protein. All<br>
washes were at 4°C.<br>
Refolding of TrkCIg26His polypeptide<br>
Insoluble TrkCIg26His protein contained in the inclusion bodies was released from the cells<br>
with Xpress, and washed to remove soluble matter. The purified inclusion bodies were<br>
solubilised in 8M urea buffer (20mM sodium phosphate pH 8.0, 1mM p-mercaptoethanol)<br>
and incubated at room temperature for 2 hours with gentle shaking. 6M Guanidinium may<br>
be substituted for 8M urea. TrkCIg26His protein was purified on a HisTrap nickel column<br>
(Pharmacia) in 20mM sodium phosphate, pH 8.0, 8M urea, 10mM imidazole, 1mM<br>
p-mercaptoethanol and eluted using 300mM imidazole. Refolding was in 20mM sodium<br>
phosphate, pH 8.0, 100mM NaCl, 1mM p-mercaptoethanol on a SuperDex 200 gel<br>
filtration column (Pharmacia). Fractions from the peak corresponding to a molecular<br>
weight of approximately 13.8kDa were pooled. These contained TrkCIg26His monomer.<br>
The retention coefficient of TrkCIg26His is 0.51.<br>
Characterisation of TrkCIg26His produced by method of the invention<br>
The molecular mass of TrkCIg26His was determined using a PE Biosystems voyager-DE<br>
STR MALDITOF mass spectrometer, with a nitrogen laser separating at 337 nm. The<br>
matrix solution was freshly prepared sinapinic acid at a concentration of 1 mg/100µl in a<br>
50:50 mixture of acetonitrile at 0.1% trifluoracetic acid. 0.5 µl of sample and matrix were<br>
spotted onto the sample plate. The sample was calibrated against Calmix 3 (PE<br>
Biosystems) run as a close external standard. The spectrum was acquired over the range<br>
5000-80,000 Da, under linear conditions with an accelerating voltage of 25,000V, an<br>
extraction time of 750ns and a laser intensity of 2700. Results are shown in Fig. 12.<br>
The molecular weight of TrkCIg26His was found to be 13,681.9 Da. This is almost exactly<br>
as predicted by a theoretical calculation of the molecular weight (13,685.3 Da) taking into<br>
account loss of the N-terminal methionine, which we have previously found to be removed<br>
in proteins incorporating the 6 histidine tag from the expression vector pET15b.<br>
Activity studies: Binding activity of TrkAIg26His, TrkAIg2.66His, TrkBIg26His and<br>
TrkCIg26His<br>
The resulting monomeric recombinant TrkIg2 were shown to bind the natural ligands of the<br>
respective full length receptors with similar affinity to the wild type receptor i.e. this may<br>
be expected to be biologically active. In contrast strand swapped dimeric TrkBIg26His<br>
would be biologically inactive.<br>
The ability of TrkIg2 domains to bind to their respective ligands was measured using<br>
plasmon surface resonance with a BiaCore system (BiaCore). TrkIg2 was bound to the<br>
matrix of a CM5 chip by amine coupling.<br>
Binding activity of TrkIgs. Surface plasmon resonance<br>
i. TrkBIg26His<br>
BDNF was passed over the chip at 0.1-25nM. Association and dissociation rates were<br>
estimated according to a 1:1 Langmuir binding" model, giving a KD of 790pM. NT-4 was<br>
passed over the chip at 1-100nM. Association and dissociation rates were estimated<br>
according to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, giving a KD of 260pM. Results are shown in<br>
Fig. 7. Fig. 7A shows the results of experiments with BDNF at 0.1, 0.2, 0.5, 1,2, 5, 10 and<br>
25nM (all duplicate). Association and dissociation were fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir model,<br>
giving a KD of 790pM (Chi2 = 4.39).<br>
Fig. 7B shows the results of experiments with NT-4 at 1, 5, 25, 50, 75 and 100nM (all<br>
duplicate). Association and dissociation were fitted to a 1:1 Langmuir model, giving a KD<br>
of260pM (Chi2 = 2.85).<br>
ii. TrkAIg26His<br>
NGF was passed over the chip at 0.1-100nM. Association and dissociation rates were<br>
estimated according to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, giving a KD of 92.6pM. The results<br>
are shown in Fig. 8.<br>
iii. TrkAIg2.66His<br>
NGF was passed over the chip at 0.1-100nM. Association and dissociation rates were<br>
estimated according to a 1:1 Langmuir binding model, giving a KD of 79.2 pM. Results<br>
are shown in Fig. 9. This is a very high affinity and commensurate with known<br>
characteristics of the biological membrane bound wild type receptor.<br>
Djouhri, L. et al (supra) indicates TrkAIg26His is active in vivo to prevent abnormal fibre<br>
firing of noiceptive neurons.<br>
iv. TrkCIg26His<br>
NT-3 was passed over the chip at 0.1-100 nM. Regeneration was with 10 µl 10 mM<br>
glycine, pH 1.5. Association and dissociation rates were estimated according to a 1:1<br>
Langmuir binding model, giving KD of 200 urn. The results are shown in Fig. 13.<br>
Production of non-histidine-tagged TrkAIgs<br>
Cloning of TrkAIg2 noHis<br>
TrkAIg2 was cloned into pET24a for the expression of TrkAIg2 without the histidine tag<br>
(TrkAIg2 noHis). Without modification this does not express protein.<br>
It is known that secondary structure in the rnRNA transcript can interfere with the AUG<br>
translation initiation codon and/or the ribosome binding site. Using the software MFOLD<br>
(http://bioweb.pasteur.fr/seqanal/mterfaces/mfold.html) to investigate the secondary<br>
structure it was seen that the transcriptiori start site was not ideal for expression. Figure 14<br>
shows the predicted mRNA structure for TrkAIg2 6His in pET15b. The mRNA coding for<br>
the 6His tag is outlined, as is the ribosome binding site (RBS) and the codon for a proline<br>
residue (PRO). Figure 15 shows the predicted mRNA structure of TrkAIg2 noHis in<br>
pET24a. It can be seen that the initiation site is much less accessible than in the 6His<br>
version. Similar restrictions also arise in predicted structures of TrkBIg2noHis and<br>
TrkCI2noHis.<br>
Using computer software to predict the resulting mRNA structures, various silent<br>
mutations were introduced into the DNA structure of TrkAIg2 noHis to allow access to the<br>
RBS. Figure 16 shows an example of a resulting DNA sequence, compared with the<br>
wild-type. Mutated bases are marked bold. The resulting mRNA-structure predicted by<br>
MFOLD is shown in Figure 17. Examples of suitable mutated sequences for TrkBIg2noHis<br>
are shown in Figure 21 and for TrkCIg2noHis in Figure 22.<br>
TrkAIg2 was amplified by PCR from the pETl 5b-TrkAIg26His plasmid using the forward<br>
primer GGAATTCCATATGCCTGCTTCAGTACAATTACACACGGCGGTC which<br>
incorporates mutated bases and reverse primer<br>
CCGCTCGAGTTATCATTCGTCCTTCTTCTCCACCGGGTCTCCA. Primers include<br>
sites for Ndel and XhoI respectively at the 5' and 3' of TrkAIg2noHis. Between 100-1000<br>
pmol primers were used per reaction.<br>
Hot start PCR was carried out over 30 cycles in a thermal cycler. After an initial denaturing<br>
temperature of 94°C for 15 minutes, PFU polymerase was added and 30 cycles of<br>
denaturation at 94°C for 1 minute, annealing at 67°C for 1 minute and extension at 72°C for<br>
1 minute were carried out Final extension was 10 minutes at 72°C followed by a 4°C<br>
holding step. PCR products were analysed by agarose gel electrophoresis TrkAI2noHis<br>
mutants were subcloned into Ndel and Xhol digested pET24a to create the expression<br>
vector pET24a-TrkAIg2 noHis.<br>
Figure 18 shows SDS-PAGE analysis of TrkAIg2 noHis expressed in E. coli; (M) markers,<br>
(W) whole cell extract, (S) soluble extract, (I) insoluble extract. It can be seen that TrkAIg2<br>
noHis is expressed mainly in the insoluble fraction.<br>
Production of recombinant TrkAIg2 noHis polypeptide<br>
Electrocompetent E. coli BL21 (DE3) cells were transformed with pET24a-TrkAIg2 noHis<br>
and expression was carried out in accordance with the pET (Novagen) manual. After<br>
transformation E. coli lysates were analysed by SDS-PAGE for expression of the 13.5 kDa<br>
protein. TrkAIg2 noHis protein was expressed at high levels in the urea-soluble fraction<br>
but not in other fractions. 2ml of 2YT broth (containing 50 µg/ml kanomycin), was<br>
inoculated with a colony which was grown at 37°C to mid log phase. This was used to<br>
inoculate 50ml of 2YT broth (containing 50 µg/ml kanomycin), which was grown at 37°C<br>
to mid log phase. This was used to inoculate 5 litres of 2YT broth (containing 50 µg/ml<br>
kanomycin) which was grown to an optical density of 1.0 at 600nm. 1mM IPTG was<br>
added to induce protein expression and cells were grown for 3 hours at 37°C. The harvested<br>
cells were resuspended in 10% glycerol and frozen at -80°C (8 pellets).<br>
Inclusion body preparation<br>
Pressed cells were mixed in 20mM Tris buffer pH 8.5 1mM PMSF, 10mM EDTA, gently<br>
pipetted and 20mM Tris buffer pH 8.5 added. These were centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 60<br>
minutes, and supernatant removed. The procedure was repeated with 20mM Tris buffer pH<br>
8.5, lmM PMSF, lOmM EDTA and 1M NaCl, added and then with 1% Triton X- 100<br>
added. Then a final wash was carried out with 20mM Tris buffer pH 8.5, lmM PMSF,<br>
10mM EDTA. This was subsequently centrifuged at 9000 rpm for 30 minutes. Supernatant<br>
was removed. All washes were at 4°C. Inclusion bodies were frozen at -70°C.<br>
Inclusion bodies were solubilised in 8M urea in 20mM Tris buffer pH 8.5 with 25mM DTT<br>
added for three hours at 14°C.<br>
Refolding of TrkAIg2 noHis polypeptide<br>
Insoluble TrkAIg2 noHis protein contained in the inclusion bodies was released from the<br>
cells with an Xpress, and washed with salt and Triton X100 to remove soluble matter. The<br>
purified inclusion bodies were solubilised in 8M urea buffer (20mM Tris pH 8.5, 25mM<br>
DTT) and incubated at room temperature for 3 hours with gentle shaking.<br>
Purification was carried out using an anion exchange column, such as Q Sepharose Fast<br>
Flow (Pharmacia), equilibrated and run in 8M urea (pH 8.5) with lOmM DTT added.<br>
Protein was eluted with a gradient of NaCl, in which the protein eluted at approximately<br>
180mM NaCl or a step at 200 mM NaCl. Eluted protein was refolded at 1mg/ml on a gel<br>
filtration column in Tris pH 8.5 with 100mM NaCl.<br>
Refolding with gel filtration was successful with a variety of gel filtration media: SuperDex<br>
200, SuperDex 75, Sephacryl HR100, and Sephacryl HR200. In this system, TrkAIg2<br>
noHis ran with a retention coefficient of 0.55. Unexpectedly it ran a little faster than<br>
anticipated compared with TrkAIg2 6His under the same conditions. Increased monomeric<br>
form was observed with extended solubilisation. Additionally, the monomeric peak may<br>
be finally put onto a Poros Q column to concentrate the protein concentration.<br>
Characterisation of TrkAIg2 noHis produced by method of the invention<br>
The molecular mass of TrkAIg2 noHis was determined using a PE Biosystems Voyager-DE<br>
STR MALDITOF mass spectrometer with a nitrogen laser operating at 337nm, The matrix<br>
solution was freshly prepared sinapinic acid at a concentration of 100 mg/100 µl in a 50:50<br>
mixture of acetonitrile and 0.1% trifluoracetic acid. 0.5 µl of the sample and matrix were<br>
spotted onto the sample plate. The sample was calibrated against Calmix 3 (PE<br>
Biosystems) run as a close external standard. The spectrum was acquired over the range<br>
5000-80,000 Da, under linear conditions with an accelerating voltage of 25,000V, an<br>
extraction time of 750nsecs and laser intensity of 2700. Results are shown in Figure 19.<br>
The molecular weight of TrkAIg2 noHis was found to be 13,561.2 Da. This is almost<br>
exactly as predicted by theoretical calculation of the molecular weight (13,553 Da).<br>
Biological activity of TrkAIg2 noHis produced by the method of the invention: PC12<br>
cell bioassays<br>
Biological activity of TrkAIg2 noHis produced by the method of the invention was tested<br>
by PC 12 neurite outgrowth bioassay. PC 12 cells were plated out at 2x104 cells per well in<br>
complete DMEM medium (including 100 units/ml penicillin, 100 ng/ml streptomycin, 10%<br>
horse serum, 10% FCS and 2mM glutamine) on collagen-coated 24-well plates. NGF was<br>
added at 1ng/ml and TrkAIg2 noHis was added at varying concentrations.<br>
Results from an experiment using TrkAIg2 noHis refolded on a SuperDex 200 column are<br>
shown in Figure. 20. Photographs show neurite outgrowth after 48 hours. Cells were fixed<br>
before photographing. Fig. 20A shows neurite outgrowth with 1 ng/ml NGF; Fig. 20B<br>
shows no neurite outgrowth when no NGF is added; Fig. 20C shows reduced neurite<br>
outgrowth when 2.5 µm TrkAIg2 noHis is added; Fig. 20D shows no neurite outgrowth<br>
when 4.5 µm TrkAIg2 noHis is added.<br>
Similar results were obtained using TrkAIg2 noHis refolded on SuperDex 75, Sephacryl<br>
HR100 and Sephacryl HR200 columns.<br>
TrkAIg2noHis was therefore able to prevent neurite growth in response to NGF in the PC 12<br>
cell line.<br><br>
