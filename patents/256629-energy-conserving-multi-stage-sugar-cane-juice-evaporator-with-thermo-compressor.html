"HIGH EFFICIENCY ENERGY CONSERVING MULTISTAGE SUGAR CANE JUICE EVAPORATOR WITH THERMO COMPRESSOR"<br>
ASHOK DATTATRAYA ATRE, 'Pushpa Heights', 1st Floor, Bibwewadi Corner,<br>
PUNE -411 037, Maharashtra State, India Indian Citizen<br><br><br>
The following specification describes the nature of invention :-<br><br>
FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
This invention relates to High Efficiency Energy Conserving Multistage Sugar Cane Juice Evaporator using high pressure steam available from the steam boiler of the sugar mill, more particularly High Efficiency Energy Conserving Multistage Sugar Cane Juice Evaporator with Thermo - Compressor.<br>
PRIOR ART:<br>
The known and existing conventional Multistage Sugar Cane Juice Evaporators<br>
have following features -<br>
1)	The number of evaporation stages are in the range of 3 to 5.<br>
2)	Calendrias generally are of natural circulation raising film type and occasionally last stage calendria is made falling film type.<br>
3)	The material of construction of the tubes of the evaporator is Brass or alloy steel and the material of construction of the shell of the evaporator and the other parts of the evaporator are made of Carbon Steel.<br>
4)	The temperature of evaporation of water from sugar cane juice in the first stage is typically 120°C.<br>
5)	Steam re-compressor, i.e. - a mechanical re-compressor or thermo-compressor or equivalent device is not used in these conventional Multistage Sugar Cane Juice Evaporators.<br>
6)	The economy ratio (ratio of water evaporation from sugar cane juice to steam consumption) ranges from 3 to 5.<br>
7)	Residence time of juice in rising film calendria is in the order of several minutes leading to much higher inversion loss of sugar (Degradation of sugar cane syrup).<br>
With these features of known Multistage Sugar Cane Juice Evaporators, following drawbacks exists in these Evaporators -<br>
1) Due to the number of stages being only 3 to 5 and due to the absence of any type  of steam  re-compressor,  thermo-compressor or equivalent<br>
-2-<br><br>
device, the economy ratio (ratio of water evaporation from sugar cane juice to motive steam required) of the existing Multistage Sugar Cane Juice Evaporators is only 3 to 5. That is one kg of motive steam evaporates only 3 to 5 kg of water from juice.<br>
2)	Due to low evaporation efficiency, the steam consumption and hence the running cost of the Multistage Sugar Cane Juice Evaporators is high. Therefore the steam requirement of sugar mills is very high.<br>
3)	Due to the high steam consumption in the existing Multistage Sugar Cane Juice Evaporators, sugar mills are required to install large capacity steam boilers thereby increasing the capital cost and running cost of the sugar mills.<br>
4)	Due to high steam consumption of existing Multistage Sugar Cane Juice Evaporators, major portion of the bagasse generated by the Sugar Mills is consumed for steam generation within the sugar mills, thereby leaving very little quantity of bagasse for other use or for sale. This reduces the possible additional revenue generation from surplus bagasse.<br>
5)	Due to calendria type or rising film construction of the evaporator, the typical residence time of sugar cane juice in each stage of the evaporator is as high as 30 to 45 minutes in each stage. Such high residence time results in degradation of quality of sugar cane juice.<br>
6)	Due to long residence time of typically 45 minutes in each evaporator stage, the sugar molecules undergo inversion thereby degrading the quality of sugar cane juice. A typical rate of inversion of sugar molecules for various evaporation temperatures temperature is shown in the following table -<br>

NEED OF THE PRESENT INVENTION:<br>
Conventionally in sugar plants, evaporators of very poor economy ratio have been in use due to the following reasons.<br>
1.	Until very recent past conventional fuels like coal were much cheaper and bagasse was never considered as commercial fuel.<br>
2.	Because of very low bulk density and other associated reasons transportation of bagasse was very difficult and costly affair.<br>
3.	In the past technology of high pressure boilers for power generation was very costly. Hence boilers of low capacity but high pressure as required in modern sugar plants were not available.<br>
4.	High pressure steam turbines of low capacities were also either not available or very costly.<br>
-4-<br><br>
5.	Generally sugar plants are situated in remote / rural regions. Hence transmission of power generated on bagasse and to be supplied to grid was a costly &amp; difficult affair.<br>
6.	Generally no infrastructure for transportation of bagasse or transmission of power was available as sugar is a business of developing countries.<br>
7.	Sugar alone gave enough revenue and bagasse was never considered as a sellable byproduct to generate additional revenue.<br>
8.	Because of the above said reasons, bagasse was considered a waste to be disposed from sugar plants.<br>
9.	Until very recent past sugar plants encouraged consumers of bagasse to arrange their own transport and take away bagasse at nominal cost.<br>
10.	The capacity and pressure of steam boilers in sugar plants were so selected that the power and steam demand of the plant is just balanced.<br>
11.	Steam boilers of sugar plants were practically treated as incinerators to dispose all the bagasse generated from the plant.<br>
Present scenario and need for highly efficient evaporator:<br>
1.	Costs of conventional fuels like coal and oil have gone high and continue to rise at alarming rate. These fossil fuels are environmentally unfriendly. Hence industries are searching for cheaper sources of energy.<br>
2.	Biomass is considered the most environment friendly renewable energy source.<br>
3.	Bagasse briquettes are considered as very good fuel in commercial boilers.<br>
4.	Briquettes offer no transportation hassles and now transportation infrastructure is also easily available.<br>
5.	Cost of bagasse has gone up due to above reasons and now viewed as an important source of revenue.<br>
-5-<br><br>
6.	It has become very difficult for sugar industries to sustain by depending only on revenue from sugar as the sugar prices are falling &amp; bagasse fetches very good value. Therefore increase in surplus bagasse drastically increases sugar mill profitability.<br>
7.	High pressure boilers for driving steam compressors &amp; steam turbines are no longer costly in this range &amp; are easily available.<br>
8.	Hence in the present circumstances, highly efficient evaporators (major energy consumer in sugar plant) can save huge amount of bagasse to generate additional revenue. (Refer enclosed Comparison of newly invented high efficiency 7 stage juice concentrator with conventional systems)<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
Referring to the accompanying Figure 1, the Multistage Sugar Cane Juice Evaporator with Thermo-Compressor comprises of number of falling film evaporators. In the Figure 1, as a typical example seven sets of falling film evaporators are provided each of which is marked as Item No. 7. Each of the falling film evaporator is provided with juice preheater (marked as item No. 6) for preheating the juice before evaporation in each stage. Each of the falling film evaporator is provided with the juice recirculation &amp; transfer pump (marked as item No. 4), level indicator, level transmitter and flow control valve(s). A steam inlet and outlet is provided to each falling film evaporator. The sugar cane juice flows from inside the tubes in the form of thin film and steam flows around the tubes on the shell side of the evaporator. The steam generated in the falling film evaporator by evaporation from sugar juice is passed through the cyclone separator (marked as item No. 8) for separating &amp; removing the juice from wet water vapour or steam and dry steam or water vapour is supplied first to the juice pre-heater of the next stage and then to the main evaporator of the next stage. The outlet for the condensate is provided on the juice preheater which is connected on the bottom side of the shell of the corresponding falling film evaporator. The steam leaving the juice preheater is utilized in the falling film evaporator of the corresponding stage. The condensate leaving the falling film evaporator enters the juice preheater of the next stage and the condensate leaving the last stage of the falling film evaporators is passed through another heat exchanger, called Juice Cooled Steam Condenser (marked as Item No. 9 in the accompanying Figure 1). The steam generated in each stage &amp; separated in the cyclone separator of each stage is fed to the juice preheater of the next stage and steam generated from the cyclone separator of the last stage is passed through the juice cooled condenser as well as the water cooled condenser (marked as Item No. 10 in the accompanying Figure 1). The condensate leaving<br>
-8-<br><br>
the juice cooled condenser and water cooled condenser is discharged to the condensate tank (marked as Item No. 12 in the accompanying Figure 1) from where it is transferred to the required application point in the sugar mill through the condensate transfer pump (marked as Item No. 14 in the accompanying Figure 1).<br>
The raw sugar cane juice from the sugar mill is stored in a raw juice tank (marked as Item No. 1 in the accompanying Figure 1). There two options for introducing raw sugar cane juice in the evaporator system.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
Option 1: When the juice supplied to the system is at a temperature higher then<br>
boiling point of juice in the first stage (typically higher then 90 Deg.C):<br>
Since juice supplied to the evaporator system is adequately hot, there is no need to circulate the raw juice in to preheaters. Hence raw sugar cane juice enters directly to the first stage evaporator. If the temperature of raw sugar cane juice is much higher then the boiling point of juice in the first stage evaporator, then the juice cools down by giving away its sensible heat and generating flash steam. Flash steam thus generated contributes to substantial evaporation in the subsequent stages there by reducing the motive steam requirement. Hence the economy ratio (kg of water evaporated per kg of motive steam input) increases rapidly with temperature of raw sugar cane juice beyond boiling point of juice in the first stage Refer the figure 2 enclosed. Since as a functional requirement for juice filtrations system (which precedes juice evaporator), juice must be heated to typically 110 to 120 °C, juice evaporation plant will always operate as described here in. Hence this plant will generally operate with high economy ratio typically in the range of 20 to 28 (kg of water evaporated from cane juice per kg of motive steam supplied). Refer figure 2 enclosed herewith.<br>
There is also a provision of further preheating of the raw sugar cane juice before it enters the first stage juice preheater using the heat of condensate generated by other steam consuming equipment in the sugar mill.   The heat<br>
-9-<br><br>
exchanger for preheating the raw sugar cane juice using the external condensate is marked as Item No. 15 in the accompanying Figure 1.<br>
Option 2: When the juice supplied to the system is at a temperature less then boiling point of juice in the first stage (typically less then 90 Deg.C):<br>
This situation can arise occasionally while cold start or due to prolonged storage of filtered sugar cane juice.<br>
The raw sugar cane juice is circulated through a juice cooled condenser and returned back to the same raw juice tank, thus, partially preheating the sugar cane juice. A recirculation pump (marked as Item No. 2 in the accompanying Figure 1) is used for this purpose. The partially preheated raw sugar cane juice is fed to the juice preheater of the first evaporation stage using the juice feed pump (marked as Item No. 3 in the accompanying Figure 1). The preheated sugar cane juice in the first stage preheater enters the first stage evaporator.<br>
The flow path for sugar cane juice as described in option 1 or option 2 may be selected either automatically using a three way diverting control valve working on juice temperature signal or manually using isolation &amp; bypass valves for juice preheaters.<br>
The partially concentrated juice at the end of the first stage evaporation is collected in the sump provided at the bottom part of the evaporator and the steam generated due to evaporation from sugar cane juice is fed to the next stage preheater as well as evaporator. The partially concentrated juice is transferred to the next stage using juice recirculation &amp; transfer pump (marked as Item No. 4 in the accompanying Figure 1). The rate of transfer for the partially concentrated juice is controlled by providing the bypass control valve at the outlet of the juice transfer pump, which is controlled by the level transmitter fitted on the sump of the first stage evaporator, which maintains a constant level of juice in the sump. The same process, i.e. juice preheating, juice evaporation, steam transfer to the next stage and juice transfer to the next stage continue in each stage of the multi stage evaporator.<br>
-10-<br><br>
The first stage of the plant, i.e.-juice preheater and the evaporator receive external motive steam which is typically at 63 bar(g) pressure. This high pressure steam, before entering the first stage of the plant, passes through the Thermo-Compressor (marked as item no. 16 in figure 1) which is a device similar to steam ejector. A part of steam evaporated in an intermediate stage (third stage in Figure 1) evaporator is also fed to the throat of the Thermo-Compressor. The combination of high pressure motive steam (typically at 63 bar(g) pressure) and a part of steam generated from the intermediate stage (third stage in Figure 1) evaporator results in generation of steam at around 1.1 to 1.5 bar(a) pressure which actually enters the first stage of the plant. Use of Thermo-Compressor raises the pressure of the steam partially diverted after the intermediate stage (third stage in Figure 1) of the evaporation by consuming a small quantity of high-pressure steam typically at 63 bar(g) pressure, thus improving the economy ratio of the Multistage Sugar Cane Juice Evaporator. The economy ratio varies typically from 11 to 28 depending upon the temperature of raw sugarcane juice from the sugar mill. A graph showing the variation of economy ratio with respect to variation in temperature of raw sugarcane juice from sugar mill is shown in the accompanying Figure 2.<br>
The temperature of raw sugar cane juice at inlet to the multistage evaporator system in the present sugar mills varies typically between 100 to 120 Deg. C. This temperature is governed by the functional requirement of juice filters currently in use. Any improvement / up gradation in this filtration technology in future may reduce this temperature requirement. The performance of this multistage evaporator can then vary as per the illustrative graph shown in the accompanying Figure 2.<br>
A dedicated high pressure dry &amp; saturated steam boiler (typically of 64 barg pressure) using bagasse as fuel can be installed for supplying steam to the evaporator plant there by making the concentrator system &amp; power generation system independent.<br>
-11-<br><br>
The entire Multistage Sugar Cane Juice Evaporator with Thermo-Compressor can be designed to operate under positive pressure or vacuum. The non-condensable vapours present in the system or entering into the system or getting generated within the system need to be removed continuously online to prevent loss of vacuum in the system. The non-condensable vapours present in the system successively travel through each stage of the evaporation along with the steam generated in the respective stage. The steam generated in the last stage along with the non-condensable gases, if any enter the juice cooled evaporator wherein majority of the steam is condensed giving its heat to the juice circulated through the tubes of the juice cooled condenser. This leaves only non-condensable gases with small part of steam. This mixture of non-condensable gases and small part of steam enters the last heat exchanger i.e. water cooled evaporator. This water cooled evaporator has construction similar to the juice cooled evaporator with cooling water circulated through the tubes using a cooling water circulation pump (marked as Item No. 18 in the accompanying Figure 1) instead of raw sugar cane juice. The entering cooling water is typically at the temperature of 28 to 32 Deg.C depending upon the ambient condition of the site and it condenses the balance quantity of steam by absorbing the latent heat, thereby leaving only non-condensable gases left over in the water cooled condenser. These non-condensable vapours are removed from the system by using a water ring type vacuum pump or a similar device which can be automatically put on and off by sensing the vacuum level in the system. The cooling water coming out of the water cooled condenser is cooled in a conventional cooling tower (marked as Item No. 17 in the accompanying Figure<br>
1).<br>
Advantages of present invention (High Efficiency Energy Conserving Multistage Sugar Cane Juice Evaporator with Thermo-Compressor) are as under -<br>
-12-<br><br>
1)	The high economy ratio (11 kg/kg. to 28 kg/kg. in case of seven stage evaporator as shown in Figure 1 &amp; Figure 2 thereby substantially reducing the energy consumption of the sugar mill.<br>
2)	Reduction in energy consumption of the sugar mill results in substantial saving in bagasse which can generate additional revenue for sugar mills.<br>
3)	Due to use of falling film type evaporator and automated operation, the residence time of sugar cane juice in each stage is typically 1 minute. This improves the quality of concentrated sugar cane juice by reducing the thermal degradation of the sugarcane juice due to reduced contact time with steam.<br>
4)	Use of state of art instrumentation makes the plant fully automatic and the operating conditions of the plant can be varied to suit the different qualities of sugar cane juice coming from different grades of sugar cane.<br>
5)	The overall steam consumption of the sugar mill reduces substantially thereby reducing the installed capacity of the steam boilers in the sugar mill, which in turn substantially reduces the capital cost of the sugar mill.<br>
6)	The economy ratio can be further improved if the condensate from other source in the sugar mill is available for initial preheating of the raw sugar cane juice.<br>
7)	Use of saved bagasse as raw material for paper industry helps in reducing the use wood which is alternative used for paper making. This reduces the deforestations and helps sustainable development.<br>
8)	Use of saved bagasse for power generation / co-generation reduces the consumption of conventional fossil fuels such as coal in conventional power plants. This helps in reducing emission of green house gases.<br>
-13-<br><br>
9)	Use of saved bagasse as alternative fuel in process industries can reduce consumption of petroleum fuels and also helps in reducing SOx emissions to the atmosphere.<br>
10)	Due to low residence time, typically 1 minutes, in each evaporator stage the rate of inversion of sugar molecules is practically negligible. Thus the quality of sugar produced is superior.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
