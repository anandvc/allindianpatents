COMPOSITIONS AND METHOD FOR TREATING MICROBIAL AND PARASITIC<br>
INFECTIONS IN CATTLE AND OTHER ANIMALS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to compositions and methods for the treatment of bacterial infections, parasitic infections and parasitic infestations in animals. More particularly, the invention relates to a composition containing both an antibiotic and parasiticide for use in the treatment of bacterial infections, parasitic infections and parasitic infestations in animals such as cattle, sheep and swine.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
All references cited herein are hereby incorporated in their entirety by reference.<br>
Feedlots are in general use with beef cattle in the United States, Canada and other areas of the world. When cattle arrive at a feedlot, they are usually administered parasiticides to eradicate the internal and external parasites, which they acquired from pastures contaminated with helminth larvae, where the calves grazed prior to their shipment to the feedlot. Elimination of external and internal parasites at this time breaks the cycle of parasitism and prevents their spread to the other animals in the feedlot as calves and other animals are less likely to acquire parasites in the feedlot because they eat feeds that are free of parasites from bunks or mangers.<br>
Without the use of parasiticides, internal and external parasites have been one of the most economically-important constraints in raising livestock. The<br><br>
damage worms cause ranges from decreased productivity of the animals to their death.<br>
First line therapy for the treatment of parasitic worms is often carried out via the administration of an antiparasitic compound. One class of these compounds is avermectins. The avermectin family of compounds is a series of very potent antiparasitic agents known to be useful against a broad spectrum of endoparasites and ectoparasites in mammals.<br>
In addition to the risks of parasitic infestation and widespread infection of cattle or other animals in the feedlot, the commingling of calves and other livestock from different sources causes the calves and other animals to be exposed to pathogens for which immunity has not developed. The stresses of shipping and change in diet reduces the calves' and other animals' immune defenses. Additionally the poor weather of autumn, when calves and other livestock are usually moved from pastures to feedlots, further increases the risk of illness. Together, these circumstances result in a high incidence of respiratory disease in the cattle or other animals when they first arrive at the feedlot and soon thereafter. It has become common to administer antimicrobial drugs to calves and other feedlot animals at the time of arrival into a feedlot, in order to reduce the incidence and severity of respiratory illness in the feedlot cattle and other stock.<br>
Without the use of antimicrobial agents, bovine respiratory disease (BRD) has been one of the leading causes of economic loss to the cattle industry throughout the world. Excessive mortality, reduced weight gains, and the cost of treatment and prevention have placed a heavy burden on the industry.<br><br>
Bovine respiratory disease (BRD) occurs in both dairy and beef cattle and is one of the leading causes of economic loss to the cattle industry throughout the world. These economic losses are due to excessive mortality, reduced weight gains as well as treatment and prevention costs. BRD is often referred to as the "bovine respiratory diseases complex" due to the multifactorial etiology.<br>
The cost of death losses due to respiratory diseases vary around the world. Death losses in the U.S. are estimated to approach $1 billion annually. Losses in various European countries range from $75 to $120 million. Cattle with clinical or sub-clinical BRD do not gain weight or produce milk as well as healthy animals. Beef cattle with BRD gain less weight, have reduced feed efficiency and often produce a lower grade carcass at slaughter. Perino L J., Apley MM Bovine Respiratory Disease, in CURRENT VETERINARY THERAPY 4 (FOOD ANIMAL PRACTICE), 4TH ED. 446-455 (Howard J.L., Smith R.A., eds., 1999); A direct correlation between pulmonary lesions observed at slaughter and reduced weight gains has been established in cattle with sub-clinical infections. Whittem T.E. et a/., J. Am. Vet Med. Assoc, 209:814-818 (1996).<br>
In addition to the production losses associated with mortality and morbidity, significant costs are associated with the treatment of BRD due to the costs of various therapeutic agents and the labor required to administer these agents, along with the extra labor to isolate and observe these animals.<br>
The pathogenesis of BRD is thought to be due to the interaction of environmental and physiological stresses coupled with infectious agents. Mannheimia (Pasteureila) haemolytica, Pasteurella multocida and Haemophilus<br><br>
somnus are considered part of the normal flora of the bovine upper respiratory tract. When environmental and physiological stress factors reduce the natural resistance and inhibit the pulmonary defense mechanisms these organisms proliferate and colonize the lower respiratory tract In addition, various bovine viruses such as infectious bovine rhinotracheitis virus (IBRV), bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV), bovine respiratory syncytial virus (BRSV) and parainfluenza 3 virus (PI-3) are known to have immunosuppressive effects in the lung.<br>
Similarly, swine respiratory disease (SRD) also has a multifactional etiology. Bacterial infections caused by P. multocida, H. parasuis, Bordetella bronchiseptica, Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae, Streptococcus suis, Salmonella cholerasuis and Mycoplasma sp. can result in respiratory disease in swine, resulting in significant economic losses. Stresses such as crowding, mixing and moving of pigs and transient viral infections can contribute to the intensification of the disease.<br>
For years antimicrobial therapy has been the mainstay of BRD therapy. There are many effective antimicrobial agents currently available for the treatment of BRD. NUFLOR®, an injectable formulation of the broad spectrum antibiotic Florfenicol, has emerged as one of the leading antibiotics on a global basis. It is indicated for the treatment and control of BRD associated with M. haemolytica, P. multocida and H. somnus as well as for the prevention of respiratory disease in cattle at high risk of developing BRD associated with these bacteria. NUFLOR® is also indicated for the treatment of bovine interdigital phlegmon (footrot, acute interdigital necrobacillosis, infectious pododermatitis) associated with<br><br>
Fusobacterium necrophorum and Bacteroides melaninogenicus. NUFLOR® may be administered subcutaneously as well as intramuscularly.<br>
The above mentioned products are typically administered as a single active component formulation - typically by some form of injection, pour on formulation or by oral administration. When the formulation is injectable, there are certain considerations that need to be taken into account. Multiple injections at the same or different sites can lead to local inflammation and irritation. Additionally, as the subject to be treated often must be caught and handled, there is an increase in the labor involved in administering the medication. Thus, it would be beneficial to use a formulation that contained both an antibiotic in combination with an antiparasitic agent to remedy the aforementioned problems. Accordingly, there is a need for conveniently administered, stable compositions that can control and prevent the infections associated with bovine respiratory disease and other infectious diseases as well as control and prevent parasitic infections.<br>

Fluorine-containing analogs of antibiotics chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol have been shown to have antibiotic activity, both against organisms sensitive to and resistant to chloramphenicol and thiamphenicol. See Schafer, T.W. et a/., "Novel Fluorine-Containing Analogs of Chloramphenicol and Thiamphenicol: Antibacterial and Biological Properties," in CURRENT CHEMOTHERAPY AND INFECTIOUS DISEASE PROCEEDINGS OF THE 1 1TH ICC AND THE 19™ ICAAC AMERICAN SOCIETY OF MICROBIOLOGY 1980,444-446. Examples of such compounds, and methods for their manufacture, are described and claimed in U.S. Patent No. 4,235,892. The medical profession has become increasingly concerned about the transference of bacterial resistance to humans when antibiotics useful in treating humans are administered to livestock. Because the chloramphenicol group of antibiotics is infrequently used now to treat humans, its derivatives are particularly appropriate for veterinary use. Of particular interest are the 3-fluoro, 3-deoxy derivatives.<br><br>

The compositions according to the present invention are particularly useful for cattle and other bovids, swine, and other large mammals. In addition to the treatment of bovine respiratory disease, the compositions of this invention are also<br><br>
suitable for the treatment of infectious such as swine respiratory disease, footrot, acute mastitis, pinkeye (infectious keratoconjunctivitis), acute pneumonia, metritis and enteritis. The dosage regimen for treatment of such diseases would be as described above.<br>
Pinkeye is an acute infectious disease of cattle, sheep and other animals that is characterized by inflammation of the tissues of the eye, accompanied by nasal discharge, lacrimation and copious ocular discharge. Affected animals may display extreme discomfort, resulting in a drop in milk production; in extreme cases permanent blindness occurs. The disease, which is caused by Moraxella bovis in cattle, is widespread, especially among range and feedlot cattle, and is of great economic importance to the cattle industry.<br>
Footrot (interdigital phlegmon) is an acute infection of the interdigital space that occurs throughout the world in both beef and dairy cattle. Fusobacterium necrophorum is the major cause of footrot, although other organisms, including Bacteroides melaninogenicus, can be involved. The major symptoms include pain, severe lameness, fever, anorexia, and reduced milk production.<br>
Currently, footrot is treated by antibiotic therapy; recommended therapy can involve treatment for up to five days. The use of the formulations of the present invention for the treatment of footrot would be an improvement over presently known treatments because it would provide the proven efficacy of Florfenicol (with fewer administrations).      The compositions of the present invention are also useful for the prevention of these diseases in animals at high risk of developing those diseases. For example, the presently-claimed compositions can be<br><br>
administered to cattle at high risk of developing bovine respiratory disease at the same dosages recommended for treatment of bovine respiratory disease.<br>
The invention will be set forth with more particularity by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
Example 1<br>
A formulation within the scope of the present invention was prepared according to procedures customary in the art. The formulation contained the following concentrations of ingredients as set forth in the table below.<br><br>
The formulation demonstrated an acceptable stability profile when subjected to temperature cycling and assayed by high performance liquid chromatography as set forth in the table below.<br><br><br>
Example 2<br>
The formulation prepared in accordance wrth Example 1 was administered to animals. The following study was conducted using the formulation prepared in accordance with Example 1. 10 calves were administered either the formulation of Example 1 administered as a single subcutaneous injection of Florfenicol dose of 40 mg/kg and an Ivermectin dose of 0,2 mg/kg or the calves were administered a single Ivermectin dose of 0.2.mg/kg. Mean serum concentrations were determined. The formulation of Example 1 was also compared against data previously obtained with the administration of commercially available formulations of Florfenicol as a single active agent. The formulations of Example 1 achieved acceptable mean serum levels obtained postdose as those obtained with the administration of commercially available formulations containing either Florfenicol or Ivermectin as single active agents.<br>
