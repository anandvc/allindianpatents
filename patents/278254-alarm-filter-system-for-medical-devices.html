				<td>A)	TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001] The present invention generally relates to a medical device such as a Patient Monitoring System (PMS) like a Central Nursing Station (CNS) provided to monitor the patients in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The present invention more specifically relates to an alarm filter for selecting the alarms output fi-om the patient monitoring units installed at the bed side of each patient, based on parameter or, time period or both during an observation of a patient in critical condition or under intensive care.<br>
B)	BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0002] Generally the various physiological parameters of an individual are measured using monitors known as, "vital sign parameter bed side monitor" or " vital sign monitoring systems", to measure heart rate level, blood pressure, artery pressure etc. One of the important vital signs measured by healthcare providers is Electrocardiography (ECG), impedance cardio vasography, and non-invasive cardiac output. The monitored parameters are displayed at a central nursing station to enable medical personnel like doctors, nursing assistants, and medical attendants, to monitor patients under critical conditions or under intensive care and to take immediate remedial care during emergency conditions.<br>
[0003] The Central Nursing Station (CNS) has different screens to provide an efficient and convenient way to display the real-time patient related data as well as trend data of different patients. The Central Nursing Station (CNS) has different<br>
 <br>
display formats to provide an efficient and convenient way to display the real-time patient related data corresponding to different patients.<br>
[0004] The Alarm levels are indications to the medical personnel to alert them on the critical nature of a sick patient under care in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU). The Alarms are set according to the general health condition of the patient and it is necessary that the alarm levels are patient specific. Generally no two cases are identical and hence we carmot generalize the alarm levels or symptoms for a measured or monitored physiological parameter. The general condition of a specified patient is accessed based on the initial tests conducted on the specified patient. The alarm limits for the specified patient are set based on the results of the initial tests conducted on the patient,<br>
[0005] Whenever the monitored physiological parameter exceeds the preset level, an audio alarm and a visual alarm are output to draw the attention of the medical personnel monitoring the patient activity. The generated alarm is registered in an alarm recall system provided in the CNS, detecting the patient condition/parameter. The alarm recall system may store only a preset number of alarm conditions. When a new alarm is generated after the saturation of the register in the alarm recall system, the oldest alarm condition stored on the register is easily replaced by the new alarm condition. The alarm recall system is modelled on the lines of First in First out (FIFO) logic circuit so that the oldest alarm may be replaced by the new alarm.<br>
 <br>
[0006] The Central Nursing Station has the ability to store about 250 alarms. For a particular patient in a critical condition, these alarms could be of all types. When a consultant studies a particular patient, sometimes he is keen to observe the alarms related to a particular parameter individually or otherwise with other parameters collectively so that he is able to study the overall human system's behaviour. At times, the viewing of all the related alarms in a single screen could be disturbing and lead to confusion. When all of the alarms generated during a particular period or particular event are not related to each other, then the display of all the alarms together is not of any significance and may in some cases be a hindrance for observation and diagnosis.<br>
[0007] Sometimes the consultant may be interested in viewing the details related to a particular event. He may have information regarding the time of occurrence of the particular event. Hence he may wish to view all alarms that have occurred in a given period of time. Moreover the user may sometimes wish to observe the alarms generated related to a particular parameter and during the particular time period to study and diagnose a particular event during a particular time period.<br>
[0008] Hence there is a need to select the alarms based on the selected parameter or particular event or period or on both of them together so that the medical doctor may study and diagnose a particular event to provide the best possible medical care to the patient in intensive care.<br>
 <br>
C)	OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0009] The primary object of the invention is to develop an alarm filter system to select and view all the generated alarms based on a particular parameter, to study and diagnose a particular event to provide most appropriate medical care to the patient under critical condition.<br>
[0010] Another object of the invention is to develop an alarm filter system to select and view all the generated alarms during the given period of time to study and diagnose a particular event to provide most appropriate medical care to the patient under critical condition filters based on a time period.<br>
[0011] Yet another object of the invention is to develop an alarm filter system to select and view all the generated alarms due to a particular parameter and during the given period of time to study and diagnose a particular event to provide most appropriate medical care to the patient under critical condition.<br>
[0012] These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent firom the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
D)	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] The above-mentioned shortcomings, disadvantages and problems are addressed herein. It will be understood by reading and studying the following specifications:<br>
 <br>
[0014] The various embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for filtering the generated alarms based on a selected parameter or time period or both of them to observe and study the selected alarms to diagnose and study a particular event to provide the most appropriate medical care to the patient in the intensive care unit.<br>
[0015] According to one embodiment of the present invention, the alarm filtering system provides a tool to enable a user to input a desired parameter data or start and end time data of a particular event or both the parameter data and time data to select and view all the alarms that are generated during the particular time period or particular event to diagnose an event to provide a suitable medical care to the patient under observation.<br>
[0016] The CNS is provided with a system to provide an interface to display the screen containing an alarm filter button. When the button is clicked, a menu screen is displayed to provide an option window to enter a parameter data or time data or both to enable the alarm filtering process using a selected parameter or event data or using a time data or by using both the parameter and time data to select and view all the alarms generated during a particular event or time period to help diagnose an event to provide the best possible medical care to the patient under observation in the ICU.<br>
[0017] According to another embodiment of the present invention, an alarm filtering method is provided to select and view all the alarms generated during a particular<br>
 <br>
event or time period by inputting the given parameter data or time data or both the parameter data and time data. A graphical user interface is provided in the CNS to display a menu bar including windows to fill the desired parameter data or to fill the start and end time periods to filter the alarm data stored in an alarm database to display all the desired alarm data related to a parameter or to a time period or to both, when an alarm filter button provided in the CNS is activated.<br>
[0018] Thus the various embodiments of the invention provide a user with an additional tool to enable the user to select the alarms he wishes to examine. The system enables the monitoring medical personnel to select all the alarm data related to a specified parameter or to a time period or to a specified event. The system provides the user only with the relevant information and not all the available information thereby attracting the attention of the physician only to the requested data or the most relevant data related to a particular event. The system displays only the requested alarm data and not all the alarm data thereby preventing the generation of confusion and commotion in displaying the alarm data. Thus the system helps the medical consultant to acquire the desired alarm data related to an event to diagnose an event quickly to provide an appropriate and suitable medical treatment.<br>
[0019] The alarm information requested by a doctor is filtered firom the stored alarm data, which are 250 alarms at the maximum. Since the screening and viewing of many alarm conditions in series could be exhausting, the system helps the consultant medical doctor in decision making process and assists the doctor to make a decision quickly and easily by displaying only the desired alarm data. The system helps the<br>
 <br>
physician to specify the parameter along with the time period to get a list of very specific alarm thereby improving the efficiency and the performance of the CNS. The system filters the alarms based on selected parameter or time period or an event or both the time period and the parameters so that the desired alarms are alone displayed thereby saving the precious time of the doctor and the life of the patient in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).<br>
[0020] These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
E) BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWING<br>
[0021] The other objects, features and advantages will occur to those skilled in the art from the following description of the preferred embodiment and the accompanying drawings in which:<br>
[0022] FIGURE. 1 illustrates the functional block diagram of a central nursing station provided with an alarm filtering system according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
[0023] FIGURE.2 illustrates a flow chart explaining the operation of an alarm filtering system in a central nursing station, according to one embodiment of the present invention.<br>
 <br>
[0024] Although specific features of the present invention are shown in some drawings and not in others, this is done for convenience only as each feature may be combined with any or all of the other features in accordance with the present invention.<br>
F) DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
[0025] In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which the specific embodiments that may be practiced is shown by way of illustration. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the embodiments and it is to be understood that the logical, mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the scope of the embodiments. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense.<br>
[0026] The various embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for filtering the generated alarms based on a selected parameter or time period or both of them to observe and study the selected alarms to diagnose and study a particular event, to provide the most appropriate medical care to the patient in intensive care<br>
[0027] According to one embodiment of the present invention, the alarm filtering system provides a tool to enable a user to input a desired parameter data or start and end time data of a particular event or both the parameter data and time data to select<br>
 <br>
and view all the alarms that are generated during the particular time period or particular event to diagnose an event to provide a suitable medical care to the patient under observation.<br>
[0028] The CNS provides a system to provide a graphical user interface to display a screen containing an alarm filter button. When the button is clicked, a menu screen is displayed to provide an option window to enter a parameter data or time data or both to execute the alarm filtering process based on a selected parameter data or event data or a time data or based on both the parameter and time data to select and view all the alarms generated during a particular event or time period, to help diagnose an event to provide the best possible medical care to the patient under observation in the ICU.<br>
[0029] One of the three available options may be selected to display an appropriate screen to enable the user/ consultant/ medical doctor to fill in the required data such as the parameter data, event data, start time, end time, time period data, etc., to filter and extract the desired information. Thus the user is able to retrieve and view the required/requested/desired data that will assist him in making a decision or support his decision.<br>
[0030] According to another embodiment of the present invention, an alarm filtering method is provided to select and view all the alarms generated during a particular event or time period by inputting the given parameter data or time data or both the parameter data and time data. A graphical user interface is provided in the CNS to display a menu bar including windows to fill the desired parameter data or to fill the<br>
 <br>
start and end time periods to filter the alarm data stored in an alarm database to display all the desired alarm data related to a parameter or to a time period or to both, when an alarm filter button provided in the CNS is activated.<br>
[0031] The FIG.l shows a central nursing station provided with an alarm filter system according one embodiment of the present invention to display an alarm list which is selected based on the input parameter data or time data or both the parameter and time data.<br>
[0032] The CNS is connected to the pluralities of the monitors that are installed at the bed side of each patient in the intensive care unit to detect and measure the various physiological parameters like ECG, EEG, artery pressure, cardiac output etc., through a converter card module. The CNS has an acquisition module to collect all the measured physiological parameters of the patients. The collected physiological parameters are stored in a shared buffer. The stored parameters in the shared buffer are forwarded to a display subsystem through a decoder. The stored parameters are decoded with the decoder. The decoded parameters are displayed in the display windows such as multipara screen and multibed screen in a digital format or wave form format. The multipara screen displays all the measured physiological parameter of a specific patient, while the multibed screen displays the most vital parameters of all the patients. The parameters may be displayed in a digital format or in a Waveform format.<br>
 <br>
[0033] An alarm condition is generated when the received parameter level exceeds the pre set alarm condition. The generated alarm conditions are stored in an alarm list in the alarm recall database. The alarm recall database has a limited storage capacity so that only a preset number of alarm conditions are stored in the database. When a new alarm is generated and the storage space in the alarm recall data base is filled completely, the alarms stored in the database are deleted using the First in First out (FIFO) principal.<br>
[0034] A graphical user interface is provided to display a screen containing an alarm filter button, when a doctor wants to retrieve a desired alarm data from the alarm list. When the button is clicked, a menu screen is displayed to provide an option window to enter a parameter data or time data or both to execute the alarm filtering process based on a selected parameter data or event data or a time data or based on both the parameter and time data to select and view all the alarms generated during a particular event or time period, to help diagnose an event to provide the best possible medical care to the patient under observation in the ICU.<br>
[0035] One of the three available options may be selected to display an appropriate screen to enable the user/ consultant^ medical doctor to fill in the required data such as the parameter data, event data, start time, end time, time period data, etc., to filter and extract the desired information. Thus the user is able to retrieve and view the required/requested/desired data that will assist him in making a decision or support his decision.<br>
 <br>
[0036] The FIG. 2 illustrates a flow chart explaining the operation of the alarm display priority-setting device according to one embodiment of the preset invention. The collected physiological parameters of all the patients are received from the pluralities of the monitors installed in the bed side of each patient in the intensive care unit. The received most vital parameter data from all the monitors are displayed in a multibed screen. When a multipara option is selected on the menu bar and a bed number is chosen corresponding to a specific patient, all the measured physiological parameters of the specific patient are displayed in the multipara screen.<br>
[0037] A graphical user interface is provided in the CNS to display a menu bar including windows to fill the desired parameter data or to fill the start and end time periods, when an alarm related to an event or parameter or time or both the time and the parameter is required by a doctor to diagnose an event. The alarm data stored in an alarm recall database is filtered based on the input time data or parameter data or event data to display all the desired alarm data related to a parameter or to a time period or to an event. A time data and a parameter data are entered in the window to filter the stored alarm data in the alarm recall database to acquire a specified alarm data to diagnose a critical event to provide a suitable and best possible medical care.<br>
[0038] Thus the various embodiments of the invention provide a user with an additional tool to enable the user to select the alarms he wishes to examine. Thus the selection of the alarm is parameter dependant or time dependant or event dependent. The system also helps the consultant physician to get the list of very specific alarm by entering the parameter data, the time period data or both.<br>
 <br>
[0039] The alarm filtering system of the present invention allows the user to view the selected alarms that are chosen either by parameter or by time period specification or by both. Thus the user will be presented only with relevant information and not all the available information. The user has to click only the option of Alarm Filter on the screen and then enter the requested data, such as the parameter data, the time period or both so that the required information is filtered and displayed to the user.<br>
[0040] All the alarm information might be important but not necessary at every point in time. Sometimes an overall view is required while in some other occasion, only specific information alone is required. Thus the system provides the user with required information to improve the efficiency of the entire system.<br>
[0041] The user is given an option to view the required alarms based on parameters alone i.e., all alarms of a particular parameter or parameters alone will be displayed. Alternately a desired alarm may be retrieved based on the specified time period. Thus all the recorded alarms in a stipulated time period selected by the user alone will be displayed. Also the required or specific alarm list may be displayed based on the input parameter, the time period or both. Thus the need for the consultant physician to look through a maximum of 250-recorded alarms is avoided thereby enabling the medical personnel to view only the required alarm list easily.<br>
[0042] The system provides the user only with the relevant information and not all the available information. The requested information by a doctor is filtered from the stored alarm data, which is 250 alarms at its maximum. Since the screening and the<br>
 <br>
viewing of many alarm conditions in series could be exhausting, the system helps the consultant medical doctor in his decision making process.<br>
[0043] Thus the CNS of the present invention is provided with an alarm filtering system to appropriately filter the alarms based on selected and input parameters or the stipulated time period or both thereby providing the medical consultant with the much needed information. Hence the medical doctor will find h beneficial in terms of saving precious time and in making a critical decision for a critically ill patient. For a patient in the ICU, the time factor is most important. A moment saved in diagnosis and treatment will make a big difference in the condition of the patient. Precious time is saved for a patient in the ICU by filtering and providing the doctor only with the information that is required by the doctor at the moment of decision-making. Thus the system saves precious time for a doctor in acquiring the required data and hence the life of the critically ill patient..<br>
G) ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0044] Thus the various embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for filtering the stored alarm list to retrieve the desired specific alarm list based on the input parameter data or time period data or both the time period data and the parameter data easily and efficiently. The consultant physician or the medical doctor is able to acquire the much needed alarm data with respect to particular event or specific parameter or time period easily, quickly and efficiently to provide the<br>
 <br>
appropriate, suitable and much needed medical care to the critically ill patient in the ICU.<br>
[0045] The system provides the doctor, only with the required alarm data and not all the alarm data thereby saving time and the life of the patient. The system equips the user with an additional tool to enable him to pick the desired alarms quickly. Thus the system provides the user with the required data and assists him in making a decision or supports his decision. Hence the user will find the system beneficial in terms of saving precious time in making a critical decision for a critically ill patient.<br>
[0046] The various embodiments of the invention provide a user with an additional tool to enable the user to select the alarms he wishes to examine. The system enables the monitoring medical personnel to select all the alarm data related to a specified parameter or to a time period or to a specified event. The system provides the user only with the relevant information and not all the available information thereby attracting the attention of the physician only to the requested data or the most relevant data related to a particular event. The system displays only the requested alarm data and not all the alarm data thereby preventing the generation of confusion and commotion in displaying the alarm data. Thus the system helps the medical consultant to acquire the desired alarm data related to an event to diagnose an event quickly to provide an appropriate and suitable medical treatment.<br>
[0047] The alarm information requested by a doctor is filtered from the stored alarm data, which are 250 alarms at the maximum. Since the screening and viewing of many alarm conditions in series could be exhausting, the system helps the consultant<br>
 <br>
medical doctor in decision making process and assists the doctor to make a decision quickly and easily by displaying only the desired alarm data. The system helps the physician to specify the parameter along with the time period to get a list of very specific alarm thereby improving the efficiency and the performance of the CNS.<br>
[0048] The system filters the alarms based on selected parameter or time period or an event or both the time period and the parameters so that the desired alarms are alone displayed thereby saving the precious time of the doctor and the life of the patient in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).<br>
[0049] Although the invention is described with various specific embodiments, it will be obvious for a person skilled in the art to practice the invention with modifications. However, all such modifications are deemed to be within the scope of the claims.<br>
[0050] It is also to be understood that the following claims are intended to cover all of the generic and specific features of the present invention described herein and all the statements of the scope of the invention which as a matter of language might be said to fall there between.<br>

D)	SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0013] The above-mentioned shortcomings, disadvantages and problems are addressed herein. It will be understood by reading and studying the following specifications:<br>
 <br>
[0014] The various embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for filtering the generated alarms based on a selected parameter or time period or both of them to observe and study the selected alarms to diagnose and study a particular event to provide the most appropriate medical care to the patient in the intensive care unit.<br>
[0015] According to one embodiment of the present invention, the alarm filtering system provides a tool to enable a user to input a desired parameter data or start and end time data of a particular event or both the parameter data and time data to select and view all the alarms that are generated during the particular time period or particular event to diagnose an event to provide a suitable medical care to the patient under observation.<br>
[0016] The CNS is provided with a system to provide an interface to display the screen containing an alarm filter button. When the button is clicked, a menu screen is displayed to provide an option window to enter a parameter data or time data or both to enable the alarm filtering process using a selected parameter or event data or using a time data or by using both the parameter and time data to select and view all the alarms generated during a particular event or time period to help diagnose an event to provide the best possible medical care to the patient under observation in the ICU.<br>
[0017] According to another embodiment of the present invention, an alarm filtering method is provided to select and view all the alarms generated during a particular<br>
 <br>
event or time period by inputting the given parameter data or time data or both the parameter data and time data. A graphical user interface is provided in the CNS to display a menu bar including windows to fill the desired parameter data or to fill the start and end time periods to filter the alarm data stored in an alarm database to display all the desired alarm data related to a parameter or to a time period or to both, when an alarm filter button provided in the CNS is activated.<br>
[0018] Thus the various embodiments of the invention provide a user with an additional tool to enable the user to select the alarms he wishes to examine. The system enables the monitoring medical personnel to select all the alarm data related to a specified parameter or to a time period or to a specified event. The system provides the user only with the relevant information and not all the available information thereby attracting the attention of the physician only to the requested data or the most relevant data related to a particular event. The system displays only the requested alarm data and not all the alarm data thereby preventing the generation of confusion and commotion in displaying the alarm data. Thus the system helps the medical consultant to acquire the desired alarm data related to an event to diagnose an event quickly to provide an appropriate and suitable medical treatment.<br>
[0019] The alarm information requested by a doctor is filtered firom the stored alarm data, which are 250 alarms at the maximum. Since the screening and viewing of many alarm conditions in series could be exhausting, the system helps the consultant medical doctor in decision making process and assists the doctor to make a decision quickly and easily by displaying only the desired alarm data. The system helps the<br>
 <br>
physician to specify the parameter along with the time period to get a list of very specific alarm thereby improving the efficiency and the performance of the CNS. The system filters the alarms based on selected parameter or time period or an event or both the time period and the parameters so that the desired alarms are alone displayed thereby saving the precious time of the doctor and the life of the patient in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).<br>
[0020] These and other objects and advantages of the present invention will become readily apparent from the following detailed description taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>

[0024] Although specific features of the present invention are shown in some drawings and not in others, this is done for convenience only as each feature may be combined with any or all of the other features in accordance with the present invention.<br>
F) DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE PRESENT INVENTION<br>
[0025] In the following detailed description, reference is made to the accompanying drawings that form a part hereof, and in which the specific embodiments that may be practiced is shown by way of illustration. These embodiments are described in sufficient detail to enable those skilled in the art to practice the embodiments and it is to be understood that the logical, mechanical and other changes may be made without departing from the scope of the embodiments. The following detailed description is therefore not to be taken in a limiting sense.<br>
[0026] The various embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for filtering the generated alarms based on a selected parameter or time period or both of them to observe and study the selected alarms to diagnose and study a particular event, to provide the most appropriate medical care to the patient in intensive care<br>
[0027] According to one embodiment of the present invention, the alarm filtering system provides a tool to enable a user to input a desired parameter data or start and end time data of a particular event or both the parameter data and time data to select<br>
 <br>
and view all the alarms that are generated during the particular time period or particular event to diagnose an event to provide a suitable medical care to the patient under observation.<br>
[0028] The CNS provides a system to provide a graphical user interface to display a screen containing an alarm filter button. When the button is clicked, a menu screen is displayed to provide an option window to enter a parameter data or time data or both to execute the alarm filtering process based on a selected parameter data or event data or a time data or based on both the parameter and time data to select and view all the alarms generated during a particular event or time period, to help diagnose an event to provide the best possible medical care to the patient under observation in the ICU.<br>
[0029] One of the three available options may be selected to display an appropriate screen to enable the user/ consultant/ medical doctor to fill in the required data such as the parameter data, event data, start time, end time, time period data, etc., to filter and extract the desired information. Thus the user is able to retrieve and view the required/requested/desired data that will assist him in making a decision or support his decision.<br>
[0030] According to another embodiment of the present invention, an alarm filtering method is provided to select and view all the alarms generated during a particular event or time period by inputting the given parameter data or time data or both the parameter data and time data. A graphical user interface is provided in the CNS to display a menu bar including windows to fill the desired parameter data or to fill the<br>
 <br>
start and end time periods to filter the alarm data stored in an alarm database to display all the desired alarm data related to a parameter or to a time period or to both, when an alarm filter button provided in the CNS is activated.<br>
[0031] The FIG.l shows a central nursing station provided with an alarm filter system according one embodiment of the present invention to display an alarm list which is selected based on the input parameter data or time data or both the parameter and time data.<br>
[0032] The CNS is connected to the pluralities of the monitors that are installed at the bed side of each patient in the intensive care unit to detect and measure the various physiological parameters like ECG, EEG, artery pressure, cardiac output etc., through a converter card module. The CNS has an acquisition module to collect all the measured physiological parameters of the patients. The collected physiological parameters are stored in a shared buffer. The stored parameters in the shared buffer are forwarded to a display subsystem through a decoder. The stored parameters are decoded with the decoder. The decoded parameters are displayed in the display windows such as multipara screen and multibed screen in a digital format or wave form format. The multipara screen displays all the measured physiological parameter of a specific patient, while the multibed screen displays the most vital parameters of all the patients. The parameters may be displayed in a digital format or in a Waveform format.<br>
 <br>
[0033] An alarm condition is generated when the received parameter level exceeds the pre set alarm condition. The generated alarm conditions are stored in an alarm list in the alarm recall database. The alarm recall database has a limited storage capacity so that only a preset number of alarm conditions are stored in the database. When a new alarm is generated and the storage space in the alarm recall data base is filled completely, the alarms stored in the database are deleted using the First in First out (FIFO) principal.<br>
[0034] A graphical user interface is provided to display a screen containing an alarm filter button, when a doctor wants to retrieve a desired alarm data from the alarm list. When the button is clicked, a menu screen is displayed to provide an option window to enter a parameter data or time data or both to execute the alarm filtering process based on a selected parameter data or event data or a time data or based on both the parameter and time data to select and view all the alarms generated during a particular event or time period, to help diagnose an event to provide the best possible medical care to the patient under observation in the ICU.<br>
[0035] One of the three available options may be selected to display an appropriate screen to enable the user/ consultant^ medical doctor to fill in the required data such as the parameter data, event data, start time, end time, time period data, etc., to filter and extract the desired information. Thus the user is able to retrieve and view the required/requested/desired data that will assist him in making a decision or support his decision.<br>
 <br>
[0036] The FIG. 2 illustrates a flow chart explaining the operation of the alarm display priority-setting device according to one embodiment of the preset invention. The collected physiological parameters of all the patients are received from the pluralities of the monitors installed in the bed side of each patient in the intensive care unit. The received most vital parameter data from all the monitors are displayed in a multibed screen. When a multipara option is selected on the menu bar and a bed number is chosen corresponding to a specific patient, all the measured physiological parameters of the specific patient are displayed in the multipara screen.<br>
[0037] A graphical user interface is provided in the CNS to display a menu bar including windows to fill the desired parameter data or to fill the start and end time periods, when an alarm related to an event or parameter or time or both the time and the parameter is required by a doctor to diagnose an event. The alarm data stored in an alarm recall database is filtered based on the input time data or parameter data or event data to display all the desired alarm data related to a parameter or to a time period or to an event. A time data and a parameter data are entered in the window to filter the stored alarm data in the alarm recall database to acquire a specified alarm data to diagnose a critical event to provide a suitable and best possible medical care.<br>
[0038] Thus the various embodiments of the invention provide a user with an additional tool to enable the user to select the alarms he wishes to examine. Thus the selection of the alarm is parameter dependant or time dependant or event dependent. The system also helps the consultant physician to get the list of very specific alarm by entering the parameter data, the time period data or both.<br>
 <br>
[0039] The alarm filtering system of the present invention allows the user to view the selected alarms that are chosen either by parameter or by time period specification or by both. Thus the user will be presented only with relevant information and not all the available information. The user has to click only the option of Alarm Filter on the screen and then enter the requested data, such as the parameter data, the time period or both so that the required information is filtered and displayed to the user.<br>
[0040] All the alarm information might be important but not necessary at every point in time. Sometimes an overall view is required while in some other occasion, only specific information alone is required. Thus the system provides the user with required information to improve the efficiency of the entire system.<br>
[0041] The user is given an option to view the required alarms based on parameters alone i.e., all alarms of a particular parameter or parameters alone will be displayed. Alternately a desired alarm may be retrieved based on the specified time period. Thus all the recorded alarms in a stipulated time period selected by the user alone will be displayed. Also the required or specific alarm list may be displayed based on the input parameter, the time period or both. Thus the need for the consultant physician to look through a maximum of 250-recorded alarms is avoided thereby enabling the medical personnel to view only the required alarm list easily.<br>
[0042] The system provides the user only with the relevant information and not all the available information. The requested information by a doctor is filtered from the stored alarm data, which is 250 alarms at its maximum. Since the screening and the<br>
 <br>
viewing of many alarm conditions in series could be exhausting, the system helps the consultant medical doctor in his decision making process.<br>
[0043] Thus the CNS of the present invention is provided with an alarm filtering system to appropriately filter the alarms based on selected and input parameters or the stipulated time period or both thereby providing the medical consultant with the much needed information. Hence the medical doctor will find h beneficial in terms of saving precious time and in making a critical decision for a critically ill patient. For a patient in the ICU, the time factor is most important. A moment saved in diagnosis and treatment will make a big difference in the condition of the patient. Precious time is saved for a patient in the ICU by filtering and providing the doctor only with the information that is required by the doctor at the moment of decision-making. Thus the system saves precious time for a doctor in acquiring the required data and hence the life of the critically ill patient..<br>
G) ADVANTAGES OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0044] Thus the various embodiments of the present invention provide a system and method for filtering the stored alarm list to retrieve the desired specific alarm list based on the input parameter data or time period data or both the time period data and the parameter data easily and efficiently. The consultant physician or the medical doctor is able to acquire the much needed alarm data with respect to particular event or specific parameter or time period easily, quickly and efficiently to provide the<br>
 <br>
appropriate, suitable and much needed medical care to the critically ill patient in the ICU.<br>
[0045] The system provides the doctor, only with the required alarm data and not all the alarm data thereby saving time and the life of the patient. The system equips the user with an additional tool to enable him to pick the desired alarms quickly. Thus the system provides the user with the required data and assists him in making a decision or supports his decision. Hence the user will find the system beneficial in terms of saving precious time in making a critical decision for a critically ill patient.<br>
[0046] The various embodiments of the invention provide a user with an additional tool to enable the user to select the alarms he wishes to examine. The system enables the monitoring medical personnel to select all the alarm data related to a specified parameter or to a time period or to a specified event. The system provides the user only with the relevant information and not all the available information thereby attracting the attention of the physician only to the requested data or the most relevant data related to a particular event. The system displays only the requested alarm data and not all the alarm data thereby preventing the generation of confusion and commotion in displaying the alarm data. Thus the system helps the medical consultant to acquire the desired alarm data related to an event to diagnose an event quickly to provide an appropriate and suitable medical treatment.<br>
[0047] The alarm information requested by a doctor is filtered from the stored alarm data, which are 250 alarms at the maximum. Since the screening and viewing of many alarm conditions in series could be exhausting, the system helps the consultant<br>
 <br>
medical doctor in decision making process and assists the doctor to make a decision quickly and easily by displaying only the desired alarm data. The system helps the physician to specify the parameter along with the time period to get a list of very specific alarm thereby improving the efficiency and the performance of the CNS.<br>
[0048] The system filters the alarms based on selected parameter or time period or an event or both the time period and the parameters so that the desired alarms are alone displayed thereby saving the precious time of the doctor and the life of the patient in the Intensive Care Unit (ICU).<br>
