FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a method of restoration of stator windings for global<br>
VPI wound generator and the restored stator thereof. More specifically the invention<br>
relates to a method of repair of stator windings by replacing the faulty coil in the<br>
post VPI stage on developing repair method in the slot portion of the winding by<br>
removal of the top bar and bottom bar.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
The insulation system for High voltage stator winding adopted for medium and large<br>
capacity Turbo generators up to 200 MVA is Global VPI (Vacuum Pressure<br>
Impregnation) sys tern. In this system, the copper strips of stator coils are<br>
manufactured as an universal practice in half coil/bar form with 360/540 degrees<br>
Roebal transposition. Subsequently, the coils are insulated with resin poor porous<br>
mica glass tape to the required number of layers as per the voltage rating of the<br>
machine. These coils are placed in the stator slots as per the winding scheme.<br>
Normally, three phase star connected double layer lap wound stator winding scheme<br>
is followed up to 200 MVA capacity. After the completion of the winding, the<br>
complete stator (Core and Winding) is impregnated in a VPI process where in the<br>
winding is vacuum dried before being flooded with epoxy resin mixture and place<br>
under high pressure for effective penetration of resin in to inner layers.<br><br>
-3-<br>
Subsequently, the job is post cured in an oven at elevated temperature. This kind of<br>
insulation system makes the job a single monolith with high electrical, mechanical,<br>
thermal and chemical properties resulting in high reliability and life of the generator.<br>
There is no prior patent reference regarding repair of global VPI wound generator.<br>
The repair of VPI wound Turbo generator (TG) stator winding for large capacity<br>
turbo generators employing Roebel bars is relatively unknown. M/s SIEMENS has<br>
suggested local repair of the winding with replacement of affected coil/bar with pre-<br>
insulated conductor and in situ curing. But such method results in loss of integration<br>
of winding in post repair stage with regard to mechanical and electrical properties of<br>
the stator.<br>
The drawback of this system of insulation is that, in case of any inadvertent fault in<br>
the winding, the repair becomes cumbersome to replace the faulty coil compared to<br>
those of winding with pre-cured individual coils/bars as in the earlier case removal of<br>
the bar becomes extremely difficult.<br>
To solve the above limitation of poor reliability the VPI wound winding, a novel<br>
method was searched for since long for removal of the faulty bar, particularly with<br>
Rebel transposition of the strips.<br><br>
-4-<br>
The proposed invention is related to solve the difficulties of prior state of arts by<br>
pulling out the entire faulty coil, of the VPI wound generator winding, rewinding on<br>
placing mica taped bar and subsequently globally impregnating the job.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
According to one object of the invention is to first detect the fault in the slot portion<br>
of the winding, at the top bar or bottom bar location.<br>
According to another object of the invention when the fault is detected in the top<br>
bar location, the top bar is removed from end to end and removing the strip by<br>
cutting.<br>
According to a further object of the invention when the fault is at the bottom bar<br>
location, suitable numbers of top bars are first removed end to end to make<br>
adequate space in the winding overhang and removing straight portion of the<br>
bottom bar beyond the bend zone on both sides by cutting and removing the strip<br>
by cutting.<br><br>
-5-<br>
According to a still further object of the invention after removal of the bars, the<br>
remaining portion of the winding is thoroughly cleaned, tested for high voltage<br>
withstanding ability, placing a new bottom bar with resin poor insulation cut only up<br>
to the bend, brazing the strips to strip of incoming bar to the existing strips of cut<br>
overhang portion of the bar on bath sides followed by placement of new resin poor<br>
mica insulated top bars.<br>
A yet another object of the invention is to impregnate the repaired job once again<br>
globally impregnated by a modified step of impregnation after repair to prevent<br>
incomplete reaction/ polymerization of resins on mica tape due to less content of<br>
accelerator and incomplete curing during curing after impregnation stage of repaired<br>
winding, bottles of accelerator are placed in the corners of the oven along with<br>
spraying accelerator on the job and during post curing in the oven, the job is rotated<br>
till the stipulated temperature is reached.<br>
High voltage Insulation system of large capacity synchronous Turbo generators,<br>
operating in various power plants play very important role of withstanding the<br>
voltage stress called the dielectric stress of the machine. In order to serve this<br>
primary function, a commercial insulation has to ensure good mechanical, chemical<br>
and thermal properties also. The combination of all the above will ensure long life of<br>
insulation and thus the machine reliability.<br><br>
-6-<br>
The high voltage insulation, has undergone several changes from bituminous Class-B<br>
thermoplastic system more than five decades before to present system of<br>
thermosetting global VPI (Vacuum pressure impregnation) today.<br>
The insulated bars are placed in the slots of the generator stator core and connected<br>
electrically as per the winding scheme. Later on the stator is processed in a VPI cycle<br>
where in the job is first vacuum dried at an elevated temperature followed by<br>
flooding with epoxy resin and hardener system supported by pressurization by a<br>
neutral gas for effective penetration of resin through all the radial layers of porous<br>
mica tape. The accelerator content in the tape helps in reaction /polymerization of<br>
the resin mixture and formation of gelling. Subsequently, the job is post cured at an<br>
elevated temperature in an oven for total consolidation and drying.<br>
Followings are the typical characteristics<br>
of the detailed global VPI insulation:<br>
ADVANTAGES:<br>
(i)      Higher dielectric strength, lesser insulation thickness ad thus machine<br>
size,<br><br>
-7-<br>
(ii)     Lesser dielectric loss, void free insulation, better electrical life of the<br>
machine,<br>
(iii)     better mechanical rigidity, lesser vibration and wear and tear,<br>
(iv)    higher thermal conductivity of insulation, machine is cooler,<br>
(v)      higher resistance to moisture, acids and alkalis, lesser aging of insulation,<br>
(vi)     lesser flammability, lesser damage to insulation in case of eventual fire in<br>
winding faults,<br>
(vii)    higher power/ weight of the machine,<br>
Disadvantages:<br>
(i) Poor reparability.<br>
According to the invention there is provided a method of restoration of stator<br>
winding for global vacuum pressure impregnation (VPI) wound generator stator<br>
comprising the steps of: detecting the fault of winding at the slots in the top or<br>
bottom bar location of a stator; removing faulted portion of the top bar only end to<br>
end when the fault is in top bar by cutting open the top insulation of the bar and<br><br>
-8-<br>
removing the copper strip by cutting on both sides; in case of fault detected at the<br>
bottom bar, removing first suitable number of top bar beyond the bend zone on both<br>
sides by cutting and removing the strip on cutting; Cleaning thoroughly the<br>
remaining portion of the winding after removal of bars and testing for high voltage<br>
withstanding ability; placing a new bottom bar with resin poor insulation cut only up<br>
to the bend, brazing to the strips to strip of incoming bar of the existing strips<br>
followed by placement of resin poor mica insulated top bars; globally impregnating<br>
the repaired job once again through VPI procedure, on placing bottles of accelerator<br>
at the corner of the oven along with spraying of the accelerator on the repaired job<br>
during curing to prevent incomplete reaction/polymerization of resins on mica tape<br>
and rotating the job during post curing till the stipulated temperature of the oven is<br>
reached to prevent excess deposition of wet resin liquid in any pocket.<br>
The proposed invention will be better understood from the following description with<br>
reference to the accompany drawings in which:<br>
Figure 1        represents details of TG Stator bars with Roebel Transposition with<br>
global VPI insulation systems as practiced in the existing art.<br>
Figure 2       represents transposition details of VPI insulation systems of<br>
strips of conductors in the top and bottom bar positions placed on the<br>
slots of generator stator core with overhang and transposition<br>
zone of a winding design of a TG stator.<br><br>
-9-<br>
Figure 3       shows graphically the repairing process of faulted winding detected in<br>
slot portion of the stator according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 4       shows in actual photograph showing bottom bar cut at second<br>
bend of copper strip according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 5       shows in photograph removal of copper strips of<br>
failed bar according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 6       shows in photograph a view of insulation through after removal<br>
of copper strip according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 7       shows a view of brazed bottom bar after repair<br>
according to the present invention.<br>
Figure 8       shows a brazed repaired bar under insulation by a<br>
modified VPI process according to the invention.<br>
In the VPI system of insulation, the copper conductors are insulated with resin poor<br>
(less binder) porous mica glass based tape for the required number of layer as per<br>
rated terminal voltage of the generator. Necessary transposition of the strips of the<br>
conductors is made to equalize the induced voltage among the strips as represented<br>
in Figures 1 and 2.<br><br>
-10-<br>
Figures 1 &amp; 2 show the main components of Roebel stator bars and windings and<br>
manner of insulation. Normally the Roebel Bar design of the stator bars are used for<br>
medium and large sized high voltage generator stator winding. In such case, either<br>
single or double layer star connected lap-winding design is adopted. In case of the<br>
Roebel bars, several insulated copper strips are transposed, i.e. bent traversed from<br>
top to bottom in single/two planes similar to plaiting to minimize the copper losses<br>
due to any possible difference in the induced electro motive force (EMF) among the<br>
copper strips. The bars after transposition and stacking of strips, are insulated with<br>
several layers of resin poor (less binder) porous mica tape with glass fabric as base<br>
layer. Necessary outer corona and end corona protection tapes are applied as outer<br>
layers for high voltage machines. During winding assembly, the overhang winding is<br>
braced with conformable resin poor mats and sleeves.<br>
Figures 3 to 8 show clearly how the proposed invention has developed an improved<br>
method of restoration of stator windings for global VPI wound TG generator and the<br>
restored stator through repairing course. The turbo generator stator winding is<br>
electrically tested for Insulation resistance, High voltage and dielectric loss after the<br>
VPI process. Any kind of weakness in the winding such as damage to winding due to<br>
external metallic object, VPI process deviation etc are revealed resulting in failure at<br>
this stage. (Winding can also fail in operation at power plant due to any inadvertent<br>
foreign object during overhaul etc.) In such a case, if the fault is detected in the slot<br>
portion of the winding, following repair process is suggested based on the two<br>
possible situations according to the procedure as laid down in figure 3.<br><br>
-11-<br>
(i)      Fault is in the top bar.<br>
(ii)     Fault is in the bottom bar.<br>
In case the fault is located in the top bar, only the top bar is removed from end to<br>
end. In case the fault is in the bottom bar, suitable number to top bars are first (6-<br>
10) removed end to end to make provision of adequate space in the winding<br>
overhang for removal of straight portion by cutting of the bottom bar and later on<br>
brazing a suitable portion (beyond the winding involute bend).<br>
Removal of TOP Bar:<br>
a.	Debraze the eye joints on both side of the winding.<br>
b.	Remove the wedge form slot portion and cut open the top insulation of bar and<br>
make the copper visible.<br>
c.	Pull the copper strip form eye end up to the transposition bend.<br>
d.	Cut and remove the strip.<br>
e.	Follow (c) and (d) above for the next strip till the transposition bend.<br><br>
-12-<br>
f.	Repeat the above steps from the other end to remove the strips of second half<br>
till all copper strips are removed from the bar.<br>
g.	Remove the U-shape of left out insulation from overhang and slot part by<br>
chiselling followed by buffing.<br>
Removal of Bottom Bar: (In case of bottom bar fault)<br>
a.	First remove the suitable number of top bars as detailed above.<br>
b.	Make a cut of the bar on overhang beyond the bend zone on both side.<br>
c.	Remove the copper strips in the same manner as detailed in the top bar removal.<br>
After removal of the bars, the remaining portion of the winding is thoroughly cleaned<br>
and tested for high voltage withstanding ability.<br>
Place a new bottom bar with resin poor insulation cut only up to the bend (Not Eye<br>
to eye). Braze the strips to strip of incoming bar to the existing strips of cut<br>
overhang porting of the bar on both sides. This will follow placement of new resin<br>
poor mica insulated top bars. Electrical connection of top bars are made on end eye<br>
joints and insulated with resin poor tapes. Figures 4 to 8 show the manner of repair<br>
of the top or bottom bar of the stator and replacement of the faulted portion of the<br>
strips.<br><br>
-13-<br>
Impregnation after repair:<br>
The global VPI process as detailed hereinbefore needs slight modification for a<br>
repaired winding due to the reason that the number of bars to be impregnated are<br>
very few and thus the total content of accelerator for the total job is less. Secondly,<br>
excess wet resin during the process may get settled in various pockets and crevices<br>
of already large portion of cured winding and may not get cures. This may result in<br>
tracking and electrical discharge during subsequent stage of testing of the winding<br>
after repair.<br>
To prevent this from happening, two precautions are taken:<br>
i. During the curing after impregnation stage of repaired winding,<br>
bottles of accelerator are placed in the corners of oven as well as<br>
spray of the accelerator on the job.<br>
ii. During post curing in the oven, the job is rotated till the stipulated<br>
temperature to prevent excess deposition of wet resin liquid in any<br>
pocket.<br>
Rest part of the VPI process including the parameters are same as original stator.<br><br>
-14-<br>
Following the repair of the winding, the same is electrically tested for Insulation<br>
resistance, absorption coefficient, polarization Index, Dielectric losses (Tan Delta and<br>
tip up) and High voltage at original level to ensure the quality of repair.<br>
The illustrated invention as herein narrated above has developed a method of<br>
removal of the failed bar from an impregnated generator stator by removing /<br>
pulling out strips after strips from both ends of the machine following the Roebel<br>
transposition bending of the bar which is unique in repair of large capacity Globally<br>
impregnated Turbo Generator stators.<br>
Advantages:<br>
The proposed method of repair of winding of turbo generator with global vacuum<br>
pressure Impregnation ensures the following advantages:<br>
a.	Ease of removal of failed coils from impregnated stator winding<br>
b.	Fast repair process.<br>
c.	Ensure original properties of Global VPI insulation.<br>
d.	Better reliability of repair and longer life of machine.<br><br>
-15-<br>
The invention as described herein above with an exemplary embodiment should not<br>
be read and construed in a restrictive manner as various modifications, alterations<br>
and adaptations are possible within the scope and ambit of the invention as defined<br>
in the encompassed appended claims.<br><br>
