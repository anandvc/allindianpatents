				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING 5-HYDROXY-4-THIOMETHYLPYRAZOLE<br>
COMPOUND<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for producing a 5-hydroxy-4-thiomethylpyrazole compound, which is useful as an intermediate in the production of pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals.<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
The 5-hydroxy-4-thiomethylpyrazole compound obtained by the present invention is useful as an intermediate in the production of pharmaceutical and agricultural chemicals.<br>
As for the process for producing a 4-<br>
thiomethylpyrazole compound, a method of reacting a 4-chloromethylpyrazole compound and a sulfur compound is known (see, Patent Document 1) .<br>
In order to obtain a 4-chloromethylpyrazole compound used as the raw material of this reaction, for example, after once synthesizing a pyrazole compound having a methyl group at the 4-position by a ring-closing reaction of corresponding p-ketoesters with hydrazines, the methyl group must be converted into a chloromethyl group by chlorination.  Furthermore, for obtaining a 4-thiomethylpyrazole compound, this chloromethyl group must be reacted with an organic sulfur compound (see, Patent Document 1).  However, this method is not satisfied as the industrial process for producing a 4-thiomethylpyrazole compound, because the reaction comprises multiple stages and the yield is not high due to difficulty in the selective monohalogenation of the methyl group at the 4-position of pyrazole.<br>
As for the process for producing the 4-chloromethylpyrazole compound as the raw material in the<br><br>
above-described method, a method of directly chloromethylating a pyrazole compound unsubstituted at the 4-position is also known (see, Non-Patent Document 1).  However, this method is problematic and hardly employable as the industrial production method, because the reaction is associated with by-production of a bis(chloromethyl) ether which is a carcinogenic substance.<br>
Furthermore, a reaction of directly thiomethylating a pyrazole compound is not known.<br>

DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method capable of solving those drawbacks in conventional techniques and simply and easily producing a 5-hydroxy-4-thiomethylpyrazole compound in a good yield has been demanded.<br>
Under these circumstances, the present inventors have made intensive studies on the process for producing a 5-hydroxy-4-thiomethylpyrazole compound, as a result, it has been found that surprisingly, when a 5-hydroxypyrazole compound represented by formula (1) shown later is reacted with a sulfur compound represented by formula (2) shown later in the presence of a base and formaldehyde, a 5-hydroxy-4-thiomethylpyrazole compound represented by formula (3) shown later is produced.  The present invention has been accomplished based on this finding.<br>
According to the process of the present invention having such a constitution, a 5-hydroxy-4-thiomethylpyrazole compound represented by formula (3) can be produced from a 5-hydroxypyrazole compound represented by formula (1) in a good yield through a single step by a simple and easy operation method under<br><br>
mild conditions without using a special reaction apparatus or an expensive catalyst or transition metal. Moreover, in the process of the present invention, a harmful waste derived from a catalyst or transition metal is substantially not produced and therefore, this process is environment-friendly and has high industrial utility value.<br>
In addition, according to the embodiment of using water as the solvent in the process of the present invention, a more environment-friendly process having a higher industrial utility value is provided.<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention is described in detail below. In the following, unless otherwise indicated, the "parts" and "%" denoting a quantitative ratio are on the mass basis.<br>

The present invention relates to a process for producing a 5-hydroxy-4-thiomethylpyrazole compound represented by formula (3), comprising reacting a 5-hydroxypyrazole compound represented by formula (I) with a sulfur compound represented by formula (2) in the presence of a base and formaldehyde. (Isomer)<br>
The 5-hydroxypyrazole compound represented by formula (1) used as the raw material in the present invention and the 5-hydroxy-4-thiomethyl pyrazole compound represented by formula (3) as the product may be present in the form of a keto-enol tautomer.  In the present invention, the raw material compound and the product are represented by a structure based on the enol form as in formulae (1) and (3), but in practice, the compositional ratio of the keto-enol tautomer sometimes varies depending on, for example, the solvent for dissolving the compound and even in such a case, the raw material or product in the process of the present invention includes both isomers of keto form/enol form. (5-Hydroxypyrazole Compound)<br>
The 5-hydroxypyrazole compound represented by formula (1) used as the raw material in the present invention is described below.<br>
The method for obtaining the 5-hydroxypyrazole compound represented by formula (1) is not particularly limited.  That is, any one method in the following examples may be used or other methods may also be used. (Examples of Synthesis Method)<br>
With respect to the synthesis method of the 5-hydroxypyrazole compound, for example, Hiroshi Yamanaka et al., Hetero-Kan Kagobutsu no Kagaku (Chemistry of Heterocyclic Compounds) , Chap. 5, Kodansha Scientific (1988), and J.A. Joule and K. Mills, Handbook of Heterocyclic Chemistry, 2nd ed., Chap. 4.3.2.3, Pergamon (2000) may be referred to.<br>
For example, a method of reacting a corresponding p-<br><br>
ketoester compound with a hydrazi'ne, more specifically, a method where l-methyl-5-hydroxy-3-trifluoromethylpyrazole can be synthesized in a yield of 49% by refluxing ethyl 4,4,4-trifluoroacetoacetate and methylhydrazine with a water solvent under heating for 2 hours, is reported in Journal of Heterocyclic Chemistry, Vol. 27, page 243 (1990).<br>
Similarly, a method of reacting an oxaloacetic diester with a hydrazine to obtain a 3-(alkoxycarbonyl)-5-hydroxypyrazole compound, and a method of converting the alkoxycarbonyl group of the obtained compound into a cyano group are described in detail in Kokai (Japanese Unexamined Patent Publication) No. 10-287654.<br>
Also, a method for obtaining a 3-cyano-5-hydroxypyrazole compound by a reaction of an cc-cyanosuccinic acid with a diazonium salt is described in Kokoku (Japanese Examined Patent Publication) No. 51-33556. (Substituent RI)<br>

3-(3,5-Dinitrophenyl)-5-hydroxy-l-methylpyrazole (0.65 g (2.5 mmol)) synthesized in Reference Example 4 and 0.15 g (3.8 mmol) of sodium hydroxide were dissolved in 5 mL of ethanol.  While stirring the resulting<br><br>
solution at room temperature, 0.5 g (5.5 mmol) of a 35% formalin solution was added dropwise thereto, followed by stirring at the same temperature for 1 hour. Subsequently, 0.45 g (2.5 mmol) of sodium p-toluenesulfinate was charged thereto at room temperature, and the obtained mixture was stirred for 2 hours.  After the reaction, 2.5 g (25 mmol) of 35% hydrochloric acid was added dropwise thereto, 15 mL of water was further added, and the precipitated crystal was collected by filtration, washed twice with 10 mL of water and dried by a hot air drier to obtain 0.9 g (yield: 89.3%) of the title compound as a brown crystal.<br>
