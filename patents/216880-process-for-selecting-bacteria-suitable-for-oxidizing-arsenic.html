				<td>PROCESS FOR SELECTING BACTERIA SUITABLE FOR OXIDIZING ARSENIC<br>
The present invention relates to process for selecting bacteria suitable<br>
for oxidizing arsenic, and in particular, to oxidize arsenic in the form of<br>
arsenite As(III) into arsenate As (V). It also applies to a process for the<br>
selection of such bacteria, as well as their applications for treating arsenic in<br>
the form of As(III).<br>
The presence of arsenic can be observed in natural media, as in<br>
materials and residues resulting from human activities.<br>
It is thus found in underground water, and originates in the geo-<br>
chemical bottom. It is also detectable, for example, in residual, industrial,<br>
waste-water effluents, mineral-processing residues, coal combustion, waste-<br>
treatment, deposits of industrial residues, or when fertilizers are used.<br>
Various methods of eliminating arsenic were proposed, given that the<br>
valency under which arsenic emerges from processing is very substantial in<br>
elimination outputs.<br>
Thus, the best eliminated form corresponds to the As(V) in the<br>
following treatments: co-precipitation by iron salts or by aluminium salts, or<br>
during decarburisation with lime, and reverse osmosis.<br>
Another method of elimination is based on absorption in columns.<br>
The most frequently-used material is constituted of<br>
activated aluminium, which allows good retention of arsenic (III) and<br>
arsenic (V). However, the regeneration of the column necessitates the use of<br>
concentrated caustic soda. It ensues that the recovery of the As(III) is two<br>
times less high than that of the As(V).<br>
Other techniques, which use ion-exchange resins or nanofiltration are<br>
complicated to use and involve high investment and maintenance costs. In<br>
addition, the nanofiltration and reverse osmosis involves the loss of apart of<br>
the water in the form of an arsenic-concentrated effluent.<br>
However, a recent study carried out by the "Geological Survey of<br>
Finland" has shown that the three methods currently proposed for the<br>
elimination of arsenic in water emanating from private drillings, were not<br>
efficient in the long term. These methods correspond to the use of cartridges<br>
with activated aluminium, activated-carbon cartridges, or ion-exchange<br>
resins. The best results were obtained by oxidizing As(III) into As(V) and<br>
then combining two methods of purification.<br>
As stressed in literature, the efficiency of most of these treatments<br>
depends on the stage of oxidation of the As(III) into As(V).<br>
The oxidation of As(III) may be carried out by chemical means, with,<br>
for example, chloride, ferric chlorine, potassium permanganate or ozone.<br>
The works of inventors in this field have shown that, in an<br>
unexpected way, such an oxidation process could be carried out by<br>
biological catalysis. It therefore<br>
appeared that it was possible to economise on chemical-oxidation reagents<br>
by using bacteria selected for their specific oxidizing properties, enabling<br>
As(III) to be oxidized into As(V).<br>
The object therefore of the invention is to supply novel bacteria<br>
capable of oxidizing As(III) into As(V), less toxic, less mobile and therefore<br>
easier to eliminate by conventional physico-chemical treatments of the<br>
treated media.<br>
According to another aspect, the invention relates to a process for the<br>
selection of such bacteria, as well as selection media as novel products.<br>
According again to another aspect, the invention also relates to the<br>
use of novel bacteria for the treatment of media containing arsenic.<br>
The bacteria according to the invention are characterised in that they<br>
are isolated, autotrophic, aerobic bacteria, capable of oxidizing As(III) into<br>
As(V), using CO2 as the sole source of carbon and As(III) as the sole source<br>
of energy, and of which the 16S ribosomal DNA presents at least 95%<br>
identity with SEQ ID no. 1 or SEQ ID no. 2.<br>
However, at least the part of the DNA of the bacteria according to the<br>
invention conferring the said properties on them, is capable of hybridising<br>
with the genome of the phylum filed with CNCM 28, rue du Dr Roux Paris,<br>
France, on 20 June 2001, under no. I-2687.<br>
It indeed appeared that the bacteria according to the invention<br>
emanated from a selection process as described hereinafter for the most part<br>
fall within a single species. This<br>
observation ensues from a sequencing of the region of the DNA encoding<br>
for the 16S ribosomal DNA, hereinafter called 16S rDNA, after<br>
amplification of the region of the genome of these bacteria, corresponding<br>
to region 18-1492 of the genome of E.coli, of which the accession number is<br>
cited by the European Molecular Biology Library (EMBL) under number<br>
EMBL J01195, in accordance with the method provided in Brosius et al,<br>
1981, Journal of Molecular Biology, 148: 107-127. This amplified 16S<br>
rDNA was cloned in E. coli, then sequenced.<br>
The rDNA sequences thus obtained, carried out on 54 different clones<br>
indicate a divergence rate in excess of 5 %, with all the bacterial species<br>
listed, and a divergence of less than 3 % between the various, selected<br>
clones analysed, as explained in detail in Example 1, hereinafter.<br>
The sequences ID no. 1 and no. 2 represent the 16S rDNA emanating<br>
from clones C02 and C19 obtained from sample CAsOl; the phylum<br>
CAsOl containing the sequence ID no. 2 was filed with the CNCM on 20<br>
June 2001 under number 1-2687.<br>
The bacteria of the invention present moreover at least one of the<br>
following characteristics:<br>
- they withstand up to at least 1 g. 1-1 of As(III) without losing their<br>
ability for oxidizing the As(III),<br>
- the oxidation rate of the As(III) by these bacteria in a bioreactor<br>
reaches at least 4 mg. 1-1.h-1,<br>
- their specific activity of oxidizing the As(III) reaches at least 5x10-<br>
7 mg of As(III) per bacterium, per hour. With such a specific<br>
activity value, a<br>
bacterial suspension containing 107 bacteria per ml is capable of<br>
oxidizing 5 mg of As(III) per litre per hour. It ensues that the<br>
oxidation of the As(III) by the bacteria, according to the invention,<br>
necessitates only a very low production of bacterial organic matter.<br>
Consequently, the quantities of nutriments to supply for the<br>
development of the bacteria (nitrogen, phosphorous) are also very<br>
low.<br>
- they are capable of reducing the residual concentration of As(III)<br>
to less than 50 µ g.l-1.<br>
The bacteria according to the invention and presenting the characteristics<br>
hereinabove are comprised within a group constituted of:<br>
a) the phylum filed with the CNCM on 20 June 2001 under<br>
number I-2687 and named CAsO1 hereinafter;<br>
b) phyla of which the genome presents 80 % identity,<br>
preferably 90% identity, with the phylum in a), the identity<br>
being understood by a capacity for identical transcription<br>
and translation.<br>
The invention also relates to a process of selection and isolation of the<br>
bacteria described hereinabove. This process is characterised in that it<br>
comprises the contacting of a sample susceptible of containing such<br>
bacteria, in particular taken from a material contaminated by arsenic, with a<br>
selection medium containing a ratio of 50 to 500 mg. 1-1 of arsenic in the<br>
form of arsenite, not containing an additional source of carbon and<br>
supplying solely the As(III) as a source of energy for the bacteria. The<br>
sample and the selection medium are placed in conditions of sterile and<br>
aerobic culture. The material containing the bacteria which<br>
it is desired to select, represents 5 to 20% of the final culture mass<br>
The incubation temperature is comprised between 20 and 35°C, and<br>
preferably in the region of 25°C and the pH comprised between 5.5 and 6.5.<br>
The contaminated material originates, for example, from a mining or<br>
industrial site.<br>
In the course of the culture, dosages of As(III) and As(V) are carried<br>
out each day. The culture is sub-sampled when all the As(III) has been<br>
oxidized. Given that the selection medium is inoculated with a sample<br>
capable of containing compounds able to permit the growth of undesirable<br>
bacteria, it is preferable to carry out successive sub-samplings, in order to<br>
dilute the undesirable compounds. Sub-samplings at approximately 10%<br>
are advantageously carried out about every four weeks for the first 3 sub-<br>
samplings, then each week for the following.<br>
The selection medium gradually enables the proportion of the<br>
autotrophic bacteria oxidizing As(III) into As(V) to increase in relation to<br>
the proportion of the other bacteria present or undesirable. Moreover, the<br>
absence of additional sources of carbon also provide the development of<br>
the sole autotrophic bacteria capable of developing, using the atmospheric<br>
CO2 as a source of carbon. In short, the absenec of source of energy other<br>
than the As(III) contributes to the elimination of the undesirable bacteria.<br>
Such a selection medium is novel and, as such, also enters into the field of<br>
the invention. It is also usable for the conservation of the bacteria.<br>
For the growth of the bacteria, apart from As(III), with a<br>
concentration comprised between 50 and 500 mg.l-1, this medium contains<br>
to advantage mineral salts and/or trace elements and/or vitamins in an<br>
aqueous solution, to advantageous effect, it being understood that these<br>
nutriments must not constitute a pool of oxidizable compounds which<br>
might be used by undesirable bacteria as a source of energy.<br>
The mineral elements comprise to advantage nitrogen, phosphorous,<br>
potassium, magnesium, calcium, sodium and a chloride.<br>
An appropriate medium for the selection of the bacteria according to<br>
the invention is a medium buffered with a pH substantially equal to 6 and<br>
containing :<br>
- arsenite As(III) with a concentration of 50 to 500 mg 1-1;<br>
- ammonium = 14 mg.l-1, representing 10 mg.l-1 of nitrogen;<br>
- mineral salts providing a nutriment function and/or the buffering<br>
effect mentioned;<br>
The following mineral salts may be:<br>
- Phosphates of di- and mono- potassium, which also serve as a pH<br>
buffer comprised between 0.05 and 2 g. 1-1<br>
- A non-biologically oxidizable magnesium, such as the sulphate of<br>
magnesium between 0.05 and 1 g. 1-1<br>
- A non-biologically oxidizable calcium, such as the calcium<br>
chloride between 0.05 and 1 g. 1-1<br>
- Sodium and chloride, notably in the form of sodium chloride or<br>
another non-biologically oxidizable salt between 0.05 and lg. 1-1.<br>
- Metals: (trace elements): traces<br>
It was observed that the growth of the bacteria corresponding to the<br>
invention is correlated with the oxidation rate of the As(III), as shown in<br>
the examples.<br>
The bacteria able to be selected by the process hereinabove, using the<br>
selection medium as defined, also form a part of the invention.<br>
The invention also concerns a process for treating media containing<br>
arsenic to oxidize the arsenites into arsenates characterised by the<br>
inoculation of these media in a bioreactor, with a bacterial population<br>
essentially constituted of bacteria such as those defined and selected above.<br>
It is advantageous to work in an aqueous environment.<br>
A bacterial culture is used to seed a medium to be treated in such a<br>
way that the final concentration of bacteria are comprised between 5X105<br>
and 5x106 bacteria per ml, and preferably approximately 106 bacteria per<br>
ml. In a discontinuous culture, or a batch, that can be obtained by<br>
inoculating the medium for treatment with 10 % volume in the volume of a<br>
bacterial culture at confluence, i.e. approximately 107 bacteria per ml.<br>
In another embodiment, the bacteria may be at least partly<br>
concentrated in the bioreactor with the mean of a support on which the<br>
bacteria may adhere.<br>
When it is desired to accelerate the oxidation, mineral salts serving<br>
as nutritive elements are added to the aqueous solution and/or the air is<br>
injected when the oxygen concentration in the medium to be treated is<br>
limiting (which depends on the initial As(III) concentration).<br>
The mineral elements are used in a ratio of approximately 0.1 to<br>
0.5 g.l-1, notably of 0.01 to 0.1 g.l-1 of the inoculated medium and treated. It<br>
is advantageous for these elements to be chosen from among nitrogen,<br>
phosphorous, potassium and magnesium.<br>
It is advantageous for the treatment process to be carried out with a<br>
pH comprised between 5.5 and 6.5, preferably in the vicinity of 6, and at a<br>
temperature comprised between 20 and 35°C, preferably between 24 and<br>
26°C.<br>
The microbiological treatment is started in batch mode: the As(III)<br>
contained in the solution to be treated is oxidized by the bacteria. The<br>
bioreactor can then be supplied by a medium to be treated continuously.<br>
Mineral elements as indicated hereinabove will, if necessary, be added to<br>
this medium.<br>
It is advantageous for the work to be carried out in conditions<br>
enabling a homogenous and effective contact of the aqueous medium with<br>
the bacteria.<br>
To this effect, the reactional medium is subjected, for example, to<br>
agitation, using a bioreactor fitted with an agitation device. As a variant, a<br>
column bioreactor with a fixed bacterial bed is used.<br>
The use of this process enables the toxicity of the medium to be<br>
reduced, leading to residual concentrations<br>
of As(III) of less than 50 µg.l-1, as required by the European Directive<br>
dated 3 November 1998, relating to the limit concentration value of arsenic<br>
in water intended for human consumption. The arsenates formed can easily<br>
be eliminated because their mobility is lower than that of the arsenites. The<br>
solution recovered from the bioreactor which mainly contains arsenic in the<br>
form of As(V) and a residual concentration of As(III) lower than its initial<br>
concentration in the medium treated, is directed to a device for the<br>
elimination of the As(V). This device permits, for example, a co-<br>
precipitation to be effected by iron salts or aluminium salts or a co-<br>
precipitation during treatments of de-carburisation with lime, a reverse<br>
osmosis, an absorption into columns, or any other process or combination<br>
of processes leading to the elimination of the As(V).<br>
The process of the invention is, in particular, usable to treat media<br>
rich in arsenic, such as water intended for human consumption, communal<br>
supply or private drillings, as well as the effluents, whether mining or<br>
industrial, or underground water, notably in a reactive-barrier, "in situ"<br>
process.<br>
Although not limitative, described hereinafter, by way of examples,<br>
will be various embodiments of the present invention, having reference to<br>
the accompanying drawings, in which :<br>

(V) as a function of the bacteria batch-oxidation time constituting the<br>

Example 1: molecular identification of a bacterial population used for<br>
the treatment of arsenic<br>
- Techniques used<br>
Principle of the molecular inventory<br>
The identification effected is based on an analysis of the RNA<br>
16S<br>
of the bacterial ribosomal sub-unit, and of the 16 S rDNA sequence of<br>
which it is transcribed, as a basis of comparison with other bacteria. It<br>
should be borne in mind that it is<br>
allowed in this regard for a divergence of 3% corresponds to the<br>
phenotypic distinction between two species.<br>
After amplification, the cloning in E-coli of the 16S rDNA of each<br>
bacterium present in the sample is initiated, then the sequencing, a partial<br>
sequencing of 500 pb in all cases, and complete sequencing of 1500 pb if<br>
the diversity is narrow.<br>
The sequences obtained are firstly compared among themselves<br>
using a computer software to distinguish each species present on the basis<br>
of the percentage divergence.<br>
An interrogation of databanks then enables the micro-organisms most<br>
closely-related to the sequences representing each species listed to be<br>
inventoried.<br>
Genbank and Ribosomal Data Project were therefore interrogated.<br>
The sequences representing the species inventoried were once again<br>
compared with those of the related micro-organisms, on the basis of the<br>
percentage of divergence.<br>
SSCP Analysis<br>
The SSCP technique (Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism)<br>
is based on the secondary conformation which a fragment of single-strand<br>
DNA adopts in non-denaturing conditions (thanks mainly to Van der Waals<br>
type attractions) and which is dependent on its primary structure<br>
(sequence). A particular region of the 16S rDNA (region V3 situated<br>
. approximately between positions 300 and 500) of the micro-organisms<br>
present,<br>
is amplified, denatured to separate the<br>
DNA strands, then analysed by electrophoresis on electrophoresis gel in<br>
non-denaturing conditions.<br>
The SSCP analysis profile of the total population enables its<br>
complexity to be determined and each micro-organism present to be<br>
differentiated, on account of the migration speed of its rDNA fragment.<br>
The assignment of each peak is then carried out by comparison with<br>
the individual, SSCP-analysis profiles of each clone representing the<br>
species registered during the molecular inventory.<br>
Results<br>
- stabilization of the samples<br>
From a sample of 15 ml, containing approximately 2x109 bacteria/ml,<br>
7 ml of sample is taken, which is immediately centrifuged and the residue is<br>
absorbed in 250 µl of guanidine thiocyanate and 10% of 37.5 µl of N-<br>
lauryl sarcosine.<br>
The sample thus stabilised is preserved at -20°C until the total DNA-<br>
extraction stage.<br>
- analysis and inventory of the bacterial population.<br>
The DNA extracted from the sample was subjected to an<br>
amplification<br>
reaction of the V3 region of the 16S rDNA present, and was analysed<br>
according to the SSCP technique.<br>
The SSCP electrophoregram showed that one species is essentially<br>
the majority one, since a single peak appears on the SSCP profile of the<br>
total population.<br>
Subsequent analysis of the sequences of the clones for the inventory<br>
of the bacterial population, as well as the individual SSCP analyses of<br>
clones confirm this observation.<br>
To carry out the inventory, a library of 54 clones was constituted<br>
each containing a bacterial 16S rDNA fragment.<br>
In order to differentiate the various populations present, a screening<br>
was carried out by means of a digestion with the restriction enzyme Hae III<br>
of the 16S rDNA fragment of each clone, followed by an electrophoresis on<br>
agarose gel.<br>
The 54 clones analysed showed an identical digestion profile. This<br>
result confirms the heavy-majority presence of a single species, such that<br>
solely the rDNA of this species is amplified and is detectable.<br>
A search in two databanks indicated that the majority population,<br>
exclusively detected by the techniques hereinabove, from a phylogenetic<br>
viewpoint, does not belong to any species already known and listed on the<br>
databanks. Indeed, the most closely-related species is Thiomonas<br>
thermosulfata (Proteobacteria; subdivision Beta; Thiomonas) with a<br>
relatively high percentage of divergence, since comprised between 7.9 and<br>
7.3% in the best of cases (Table 1).<br>
Table 1. Clones, the 16S rDNA of which was sequenced and the<br>
percentage divergence in terms of the most closely-related organism from a<br>
phylogenetic viewpoint, which is Thiomonas Thermosulfata.<br>
*: a divergence of less than 3% corresponding to the same species.<br>
- An individual SSCP analysis of the clones and assignment<br>
An SSCP analysis was carried out on 4 clones taken at random, in<br>
view, on the one hand, of the simplicity of the SSCP profile of the<br>
total population, and on the other hand of the perfect preservation of<br>
region V3 of the 16S rDNA of the clones of which the sequence was<br>
analysed.<br>
The SSCP profile of the 4 clones analysed was exactly<br>
superimposed on the peak of the SSCP profile of the total<br>
population thus conclusively confirming the exclusive detection<br>
of one species of bacterium.<br>
- complete analyses of the 16S rDNA sequences.<br>
In view of the substantial divergence of the first 500 nucleotides of<br>
the<br>
16S rDNA sequence of the species detected in the sample (3.7. to 7.9%)<br>
with the sequences listed in the databanks, an analysis of the complete<br>
sequence of the 16S rDNA of the 2 groups of main sequences listed, i.e.<br>
groups C6 and C2 was carried out. Although the percentage of divergence<br>
in the first 500 nucleotides of the 16S rDNA is considered to be<br>
representative of the totality of the<br>
sequence, this additional data will thus enable the phylogenetic originality<br>
of the species detected to be confirmed.<br>
The analysis of the 16S rDNA of the C02 clones (group C2) and C19<br>
(group C6) shows on the one hand that the sequences are divergent from<br>
one another by only 0.1% and on the other hand that after comparison with<br>
the databanks these sequences belong indeed to a different species from<br>
those currently known and listed (Table 2).<br>
Table 2. Percentage divergence of the 16S rDNA of the C02 and C19<br>
clones with those of the most closely-related micro-organisms**.<br>
**: a divergence of less than 3% corresponds to the same species.<br>
The 16S rDNA sequences corresponding to the C02 and C19 clones are<br>
supplied respectively in the ID No. 1 and ID No. 2 sequences.<br>
GenBank indicates that the most closely-listed sequence is that of a<br>
beta Proteobacterium of the Comamonadaceae family called<br>
dehydroabietic acid-degrading bacterium DhA-7.<br>
The Ribosomal Data Project databank indicates that the most closely-<br>
related sequences are those of Leptothrix discophora str. SS-1 and<br>
Leptothrix mobilis str. Feox-1 also of the Comamonadaceae.<br>
The molecular inventory study carried out on the population of the<br>
CAsOl sample thus shows that a single<br>
population was detected and the micro-organisms that are the most closely<br>
related from a phylogenetic viewpoint are the beta Proteobacteria<br>
Thiomonas thermosulfata, Dehydroabietic acid-degrading bacterium DhA-<br>
71,Leptothrix discophora str. SS-1 and Leptothrix mobilis str. Feox-1.<br>
The detection of a single species of micro-organism in the CAsOl<br>
sample indicates that the medium of the sample is extremely selective and<br>
close to the conditions of a pure culture (no other contaminating species<br>
was detected among the 54 clones analysed).<br>
The comparative works show that the population of CAsOl is novel,<br>
since no known bacterium listed in the databanks possesses a divergence<br>
lower than at least 6.2 % with the organism inventoried.<br>
Example 2: Composition of a selection medium<br>
I — Preparation of the culture medium<br>
• Base medium<br>
The base medium is composed of a solution A and a solution B.<br>
Solution A:<br>
Solution A is prepared in a glass flask of 1 litre. The pH of the<br>
solution is adjusted to pH 6.<br>
Solution B :<br>
Solution B is prepared in a glass flask of 500 ml.<br>
Solutions A and B are sterilised by autoclaving for 20 minutes at<br>
120°C.<br>
• Solution of As(III)<br>
An aqueous solution of As2O3 of 13 g.l-1, corresponding to a<br>
solution of 10 g.l-1 of As(III) is prepared in the following way. As<br>
AS2O3 dissolves little in water, it is necessary to initiate a warm<br>
dissolution in a basic medium (0.55 g of NaOH in 100 ml of boiling<br>
water).<br>
The solution of As(III) is poured in a 1 litre sterile glass<br>
flask.<br>
• Solution of trace-elements<br>
The trace-element solution is sterilised by filtration at 0.45 µm in a<br>
sterile glass flask.<br>
• Solution of vitamins<br>
The vitamin solution is sterilised by filtration at 0.45 µm.<br>
II - Preparation of the complete medium<br>
In sterile conditions, it is necessary to add to the media the following<br>
solutions.<br>
The medium is stored at ambient temperature.<br>
Example 3: Batch oxidation process of As(III) by bacteria constituting<br>
the CAsO1 population<br>
The CAsOl bacterial population, selected with the medium in<br>
example 2, is cultivated in a medium containing 100 mg.l-1 of As(III). The<br>
experiments are carried out in sterile Erlenmeyer glass flasks of 500 ml,<br>
placed on an agitation table incited by a "to and fro" motion,<br>
thermostatically-regulated at a temperature of 25°C. These Erlenmeyer<br>
flasks containing 250 ml of the medium in example 2, are inoculated with<br>
10% of CAsOl bacterial suspension at a concentration of 10 7bacteria ml-1.<br>
Without a previous adaptation phase, this bacterial population is used to<br>
inoculate media containing between 100 and 1000 mg. 1-1 of As(III).<br>
The oxidation kinetics of the As(III) into As(V) thus obtained are<br>
shown in the graph of figure 1, where the axis of the ordinates shows the<br>
concentration of As(V) generated by the oxidation of the As(III), of mg. 1-1,<br>
and the axis of the abscissa shows the time in hours.<br>
When the medium is initially adjusted to pH 6, the oxidation of the<br>
As(III) into As(V) is correlated with a drop in pH.<br>
This example shows that the CAsOl bacterial population keeps its<br>
capacity to oxidize the As(III) when it is placed in a solution containing<br>
1000 mg.l-1 of As(III), i.e. ten times the concentration of As(III) present in<br>
its usual culture medium.<br>
Example 4: Continuous process of oxidation of the As(III) by the<br>
bacteria constituting the CAsOl population<br>
The CAsOl bacterial population, selected with the medium of<br>
example 2, was used to inoculate a reactor provided with an agitation shaft<br>
fitted with a screw, and a system of air supply. This bioreactor was filled<br>
with a solution containing 100 mg. 1-1 of As(III). After the batch phase,<br>
during which the bacteria entirely oxidized the As(III) into As(V), the bio-<br>
reactor was continuously supplied with a solution containing 100 mg. 1-1<br>
of As(III). The supply flow of the solution charged with arsenic was<br>
gradually increased.<br>
The time of residence of the solution in the bioreactor was thus reduced<br>
from 150 hours to 10 hours. The percentage oxidation of the arsenite by the<br>
bioreactor was always greater than 99%. The increase in the rate of the<br>
oxidation of the As(III) in the bioreactor is shown in the graph of figure 2,<br>
where the axis of the ordinates represents the rate of the oxidation of the As<br>
(III) of mg. l-1.h-1, and the axis of the abscissa represent the time in hours.<br>
It shows that the oxidation rate may be 12 mg AS(III). l-1.h-1, while<br>
in a batch, this rate is a maximum of 4 mg. l-1.h-1.<br>
Example 5: Continuous process of oxidation of the As(III) in a<br>
bioreactor with a bed fixed by the bacteria constituting the CAsO1<br>
population<br>
The bacterial population was used to inoculate a fixed-bed column<br>
reactor, containing pozzolana as the mineral support on which the bacteria<br>
may adhere. An injection of air at the base of the column enabled<br>
oxidization of the system to be supplied. The bioreactor was continuously<br>
supplied with a culture medium containing 100 mg.l-1 of As(III). The<br>
nutriments were supplied in the following proportions: 50 mg.l-1 of (NH4)<br>
2SO4, 50 mg. 1-1 of MgSO4, 7 H2O, 50 mg. 1-1 of K2HPO4, 50 mg.l-1 of<br>
KH2PO4, 50 mg. 1-1 of NaCl. It was not necessary to add a source of<br>
calcium to this medium, as the latter was prepared with tap water already<br>
containing calcium. The treatment was carried out in non-sterile conditions.<br>
The supply flow of the solution charged with arsenic was gradually<br>
increased. The time during which the solution resided in the bioreactor was<br>
thus reduced from 300 hours to 2 hours. The percentage of oxidation of the<br>
arsenic (III) by the bioreactor was always greater than 95%. The increase in<br>
the oxidation rate of the As(III) by the bioreactor and the diminution in the<br>
time of residence are shown in the graph 3 of figure 3, in which the axis of<br>
the left ordinates represent the time of residence in hours, the axis of the<br>
right ordinates represent the oxidation rate of<br>
the As(III) at mg. 1-1.h-1 and the axis of the abscissa represents the time in<br>
days. In such conditions, it was possible to obtain a rate of oxidation at<br>
least equal to 38 mg. 1-1 h-1.<br>
Example 6: Influence of the pH on the oxidation rate of the As(III) by<br>
bacteria constituting the CAsO1 population<br>
The CAsOl bacterial population was used to inoculate reactors of<br>
which the usable volume was of 1 litre, and which was equipped with<br>
means of agitation constituted of a shaft fitted with a screw, and a system of<br>
air supply.<br>
These reactors were filled with one litre of mineral medium containing 100<br>
mg.l-1 of As(III). The initial pH of the medium in these reactors was<br>
adjusted to different values comprised between 2 and 10, as shown in<br>
figure 4. The reactors were inoculated with 100 ml of CAsOl culture. The<br>
cultures were produced in so-called "batch" condition, which means that<br>
the medium has not been renewed. Frequent samplings were done in the<br>
reactors and enabled the process of the oxidation of the As(III) to be<br>
monitored, and the oxidation rate of the latter to be computed for each pH<br>
condition.<br>
The influence of the pH on the oxidation rate of the As(III) by the<br>
CAsOl bacterial population is therefore illustrated in figure 4, and it is<br>
observed in the latter that this rate is maximum at pH between pH 5 and pH<br>
7. It should also be noted that the rate is still high between pH 3 and pH 8,<br>
but becomes low for pH values of less than 3 and greater than 8.<br>
Example 7: Influence of the concentration of oxygen on the oxidation<br>
rate of the As(III) by bacteria constituting the CAsO1 bacterial<br>
population<br>
This CAsOl bacterial population was used to inoculate a reactor with a<br>
usable volume of 10 litres, equipped with agitation means constituted of a<br>
shaft fitted with a screw and a system to enable injection of nitrogen or air<br>
into the culture medium. The reactor was filled with 10 litres of mineral<br>
medium containing 100 mg.l-1 of As(III). The initial pH of the medium in<br>
this reactor was adjusted to 6. The air present in this reactor was entirely<br>
chased by a flow of nitrogen, then the concentration of oxygen in the<br>
medium was adjusted to different values comprised between 0 and 0.3<br>
mMole 1-1 by injection of low volumes of air. The reactor was inoculated<br>
with one litre of CAsOl culture. Successive tests with different<br>
concentrations of oxygen were carried out, as previously, in batch<br>
conditions. Frequent samplings carried out in the reactor enabled the<br>
process of the oxidation of the As(III) to be monitored and the oxidation<br>
rate of the latter to be computed for each oxygen concentration.<br>
The influence of the oxygen concentration on the oxidation rate of<br>
the As(III) by the CAsO1 bacterial population is illustrated in figure 5. This<br>
maximum oxidation rate was obtained as soon as the initial dissolved-<br>
oxygen concentration reached 0.05 mMole. 1-1, i.e. approximately 10% of<br>
the concentration when the liquid medium was saturated with oxygen. In<br>
these conditions, it was observed that the oxygen requirement of the<br>
CAsO1 bacterial population to oxidize the As(III) is law.<br>
Example: Influence of the temperature on the oxidation rate of the As<br>
(III) by bacteria constituting the CAsOl bacterial population<br>
As well as previously, the CAsOl bacterial population was used to<br>
inoculate reactors of which the usable volume was this time one litre, and<br>
which was equipped with means of agitation and a system of air supply.<br>
The reactors were filled with one litre of a mineral medium containing 100<br>
mg. 1-1 of As(III). The initial pH of the medium in these reactors was<br>
adjusted to 6. The reactors were thermostatically-regulated reactors by the<br>
circulation of water emanating from a cryothermostat in a double shell. The<br>
temperature was maintained at different fixed values comprised between<br>
10°C and 35°C. The reactors were inoculated with 100 ml of CAsOl<br>
culture. These cultures were produced in batch condition as previously.<br>
Frequent samplings executed in the reactors enabled the process of the<br>
oxidation of the As(III) to be monitored, and the oxidation rate of the As<br>
(III) to be computed for each temperature condition.<br>
The influence of the temperature on the oxidation of the As(III) is<br>
illustrated in figure 6. It was observed in the latter that the oxidation rate of<br>
the As(III) by the CAsOl bacterial population is the maximum from a<br>
temperature of 20°C, and that this oxidation rate is still high at<br>
temperatures of 20°C, and even 15°C, but that it is substantially lower at a<br>
temperature of 10°C.<br>
