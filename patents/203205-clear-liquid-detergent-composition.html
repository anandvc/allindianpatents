				<td>Technical Field<br>
This invention relates to a novel liquid detergent containing an alkylbenzenesuifonate salt anionic surfactant and liquid sodium solicate, and more specifically to a clear liquid detergent containing an alkylbenzensulfonic<br>
anionic surfactant and liquid sodium silicate in water.<br>
Background Art<br>
As a technique established to manufacture a liquid detergent which utilizes an alkylbenzenesuifonate salt which is an anionic surfactant, it is know to neutralize a soft or linear alkylbenzenesulfonic acid by adding thereto sodium hydroxide in a certain amount of water, to combine therewith other surfactants, water, a pH adjusting agent, a buffering agent-, a thickener, a clouding inhibitor and the like. As the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid, a hard type (a type having an alkyl group consisting of a tetramer of propylene) has ben. conventional used; however nowadays, a linear type is mainly usec. As the other surfactants, polyoxyethylene alkyl ether, which is a nonionic surfactant, is used. Further, as a softener which imports a softness to an  article to be washed,   an<br>
2<br><br>
2<br>
aliphatic quaternary ammonium salt, which is a cationic surfactant, is used.  Furthermore, polyethylene glycol is used for the purposes of preventing the freezing of the liquid detergent, stabilization of the viscosity, and improvement of the compatibility with the other surfactant, and its moistness.<br>
Until now, various studies have been conducted in an attempt to further improve the detergency power of the liquid detergent containing an alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant such as described above; however a satisfactory results have not yet been achieved.<br>
Incidentally, it is known that sodium silicate, which is a liquid silicate salt, potentially has a detergency power higher than that of any other surfactants.  Therefore, the detergency power is expected to be further enhanced, if sodium silicate can be blended into the above-described conventional liquid detergent containing alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant.<br>
However, it is recognized by ordinary persons skilled in the art that it is technically difficult to obtain a liquid detergent by mixing the conventional liquid agent having the above-described composition and sodium silicate together.  In fact, when they are mixed together, a severe reaction takes place to bring about gelation.  Thus, at present, as a detergent containing<br><br>
an alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant and sodium silicate, only the powdery detergent is produced by utilizing the gelation reaction.<br>
In order to produce the powdery detergent, it is necessary to dry the gel and make it into powder, thus increasing the production cost.  In addition, in some cases, the powder detergent does not dissolve into cleaning water depending upon the temperatures at use. The undissolved detergent powder may remain to be attached to an article to be washed, such as a cloth. Such remaining detergent may cause a skin affection such as skin allergy to a person who wears the cloth.<br>
It is therefore an object of the present invention to provide a clear liquid detergent which contains sodium silicate together with alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant, which cannot be achieved by the conventional technique, and which can be diluted and dissolved easily into water and does not generate a precipitate or become cloudy over a long period of time.<br><br>
To achieve the aforementioned subject, the present<br>
invention provide a clear liquid detergent composition<br>
comprising 5.15% by wt. of an alkylbenzenesulfonate salt<br>
anionic surfactant; 1-7.5% by wt. of liquid sodium silicate; al-10% by wt. of polyoxyethylene alkyl or aryl<br>
ether nonionic surfantant and 1-15% by wt. of an<br>
alkylethersulfate salt anionic surfactant and optionally<br>
.5-3% by wt. of metal-chelating agent, .05 -5% by wt. of a<br>
pH adjusting agent and 0.1 -3% by wt. of freezing clouding<br>
inhibitor.<br>

The liquid detergent of the present invention, when diluted 1000-fold, exhibits a weak alkalinity {a pH value of higher than 7 but lower than 8). Best Mode of Carrying Out the Invention<br>
The present invention will now be described in more detail.<br>
It is preferable that the alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant used characteristically in the clear liquid detergent of the present invention be made of a linear alkylbenzenesulfonate salt such as linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate salt, in particular. The linear alkylbenzenesulfonate can be represented by general formula RC6H4SO3M, where R represents preferably a linear C11 to C14  alkyl group, particularly, a linear dodecyl group, and M represents an alkali metal, particularly, sodium.  Although such a linear alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant may be commercially available, it is preferable that<br>
9<br><br>
the surfactant be prepared by neutralizing a linear alkylbenzenesulfonic acid with an alkali metal hydroxide, such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, in water.<br>
Liquid sodium silicate contained characteristically, together with the alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant, in the clear liquid detergent of the present invention, imparts an excellent detergency power to the detergent, together with predetermined surfactants, which will be explained later, and is an essential component for the detergent to function as such a detergent.  The clear liquid detergent of the present invention exhibits such an excellent and high detergency power that cannot be achieved by a conventional detergent, by containing liquid sodium silicate.<br>
As such liquid sodium silicate, use may be made of sodium silicate No. 1 as specified by JIS (specific gravity: 59.2 Be (Baume degree) or higher (15°C); silicon dioxide (SiO2): 35 to 38% by weight; sodium oxide (Na2o): 17 to 19% by weight, iron (Fe): 0.03% by weight or less, and water-insoluble component: 0.2% by weight or less), sodium silicate No. 2 as specified by JIS {specific gravity: 54 Be or higher (15°C); silicon dioxide (SiO2): 34 to 36% by weight; sodium oxide (Na2O): 14 to 15% by weight, iron {Fe): 0.03% by weight or less, and water-insoluble component: 0.2% or less by<br>
10<br><br>
weight), and sodium silicate No. 3 as specified by Jis (specific gravity: 40 Be or higher (15°C); silicon dioxide (Si02): 28 to 30% by weight; sodium oxide (Na2o): 9 to 10% by weight, iron (Fe): 0.02% by weight, and water-insoluble component: 0.2% by weight or less). In general, sodium silicate used in the present invention can be represented also by formula: Na2o nSi02, and in the case where n = about 2 to 4, it is liquid.  Apart from the JIS products or commercially available products, a prepared product obtained by mixing sodium oxide and silicon dioxide at a ratio of 1 mole of the former to 2 to 4 moles of the latter, can be used.  As liquid sodium silicate, JIS sodium silicate No. 2 and sodium silicate No. 3 are preferable, and in particular the silicate No. 2 is more preferable.<br>
Additional surfactants which are used in the clear liquid detergent of the invention together with the alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant and the liquid sodium silicate are a polyoxyethylene alkyl or aryl ether nonionic surfactant and an alkylethersulfate salt anionic surfactant.  Further, a fluorosurfactant can also be used.  As these surfactants, commercially available products can be used.<br>
Preferable examples of the polyethylene-alkyl or aryl ether nonionic surfactant are polyoxyethylene primary or secondary alkyl ethers, and polyethylene alkylphenyl ethers.  A mixture of these can be used.<br>
11<br><br>
Polyoxyethylene alkyl ether can be represented by general formula:<br><br>
where R represents a primary or secondary alkyl group, preferably a Cg to C18 alkyl group, particularly, a C12 alkyl group, and n represents 7 to 10.  Polyoxyethylene alkylphenyl ether can be represented by general formula:<br><br>
where R represents an alkyl group, preferably a Cg to C9 alkyl group, and n represents 9 to 12.<br>
Preferable examples of the alkylethersulfate salt anionic surfactant are primary or secondary higher alcoholethoxysulfates, alkylphenolsulfates, and a mixture of these.  Of these, primary and secondary alcoholethoxysulfates are particularly preferable, each of which has an excellent detergency and an excellent foaming property, and is less irritative to skin.<br>
Primary alcoholethoxysulfate can be represented by general formula:<br><br>
where R represents a primary alkyl group, particularly, a C12 alkyl group, M represents a cation, particularly an alkali metal such as sodium, and n represents 1 to 10.  Secondary alcoholethoxysulfate can be represented by general formula:<br><br><br>
where R represents an alkyl group, particularly, a c6-c10 alkyl group, R1 represents an alkyl group, particularly, a C2-C4 alkyl group, M represents a cation, particularly an alkali metal such as sodium, and n represents 1 to 10.<br>
The fluorosurfactant, which may be optionally blended in the detergent of the present invention, is preferably a surfactant having a perfluorocarbon chain, and exhibits a very excellent surface activity at low concentrations.  As the fluorosurfactant, an anionic type, nonionic type or ampholytic type can be used. Preferable examples of the fluorosurfactant are perfluoroalkylcarboxylic acid (C7 - C13), perfluorooctanesulfonic acid diethanolamide, perfluoroalkyl (C4 - C12) sulfonate salt (Li salt, K salt, Na salt or the like),<br>
N-propyl-N-(2-hydroxyethyl)perfluorooctanesulfonamide, perfluoroalkyl<br>

The clear liquid detergent of the present invention contains the alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant in an amount of preferably about<br>
13<br><br>
5 - about 15.5% by weight, more preferably about 5.125 - about 15.375% by weight, particularly preferably about 5 - about 8.5% by weight, and the sodium silicate in an amount of preferably about 1 - about 7% by weight, particularly preferably about 4 - about 5.5% by weight.  Further, the clear liquid detergent of the present invention contains the polyoxyethylene alkyl or aryl ether nonionic surfactant in an amount of preferably about 1 - about 10% by weight, more preferably about 1 - about 8.5% by weight, and the alkylethersulfate salt anionic surfactant in an amount of preferably about 1 - about 15% by weight, more preferably about 1 - about 14% by weight.  The clear liquid detergent may contain the fluorosurfactant in an amount of 0 - about 0.1% by weight, preferably about 0.01 - about 0.1% by weight, more preferably about 0.01  - about 0.09% by weight.<br>
Further, it is preferable that the clear liquid detergent of the present invention contain a metal-chelating agent, a pH adjusting agent and a freezing/clouding inhibitor.<br>
The metal-chelating agent chelates sodium silicate so as to capture it, thus stabilizing it. Preferable examples of the metal-chelating agent are ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-based metal-chelating agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate salt, disodium<br><br>
ethylenediaminetetraacetate salt and a mixture of these, and tetrasodium ethylenediaminetetraacetate salt is particularly preferable.<br>
As the pH adjusting agent, a malic acid (particularly DL-malic acid), citric acid and/or sodium citrate can be preferably used.  Citric acid and/or DL-malic acid are particularly preferable. The freezing/clouding inhibitor inhibits the freezing and suppress the clouding of the clear liquid detergent of the present invention, and fatty acid alkanolamide, which is a nitrogen-containing nonionic surfactant, is preferably used.  Fatty acid alkanolamide can function also as an agent for inhibiting reattachment of dirt.  The fatty acid alkanolamide is a condensation product of a fatty acid (preferably C8 to C18 fatty acid), such as capric acid, lauric acid, coconut oil fatty acid, myristic acid, stearic acid or oleic acid, with an alkanolamine (preferably C6 to C18 alkanolamine), such as diethanolamine, monoethanolamine or isopropanolamine. Such fatty acid alkanolamides are commercially available.  The fatty acid alkanolamide can be used in the form of mixture.<br>
in the clear liquid detergent of the present invention, the metal-chelating agent is contained preferably in an amount of about 6% by weight or less, more preferably in an amount of about 0.5% - about 3%<br>
15<br><br>
by weight, most preferably in an amount of about 0.5% - about 2.5% by weight.<br>
In the clear liquid detergent of the present invention, the pH adjusting agent is contained preferably in an amount of about 5.5% by weight or less, more preferably in an amount of about 0.05% - about 5% by weight, most preferably in an amount of about 0.05% - about 4% by weight.<br>
In the clear liquid detergent of the present invention, the freezing/clouding inhibitor is contained preferably in an amount of about 0.1% - about 3% by weight, more preferably in an amount of about 0.1% - about 2.5% by weight.<br>
Thus, in a particularly preferable embodiment, the clear liquid detergent of the present invention contains the alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant in an amount of about 5 - about 15.5% by weight, more preferably about 5.125 - about 15.375% by weight, particularly preferably about 5 - about 8.5% by weight, the sodium silicate in an amount of about 1 - about 7% by weight, particularly preferably about 4 - about 5.5% by weight, the pplyoxyethylene alkyl or aryl ether nonionic surfactant in an amount of about 1 - about 10% by weight, more preferably about 1 - about 8.5% by weight, the alkylethersulfate salt anionic surfactant in an amount of about 1 - about 15% by weight, more preferably about 1 - about 14% by<br>
                        16<br><br>
weight, the metal-chelating agent in an amount of about 0.5% - about 3% by weight, more preferably in an amount of about 0.5% - about 2.5% by weight, the pH adjusting agent in an amount of about 0.05% - about 5% by weight, more preferably in an amount of about 0.05% - about 4% by weight, the freezing/clouding inhibitor in an amount of about 0.1% - about 3% by weight, more preferably in an amount of about 0.1% - about 2.5% by weight, and the balance of water.  The detergent can contain the fluorosurfactant in an amount of 0 - about 0.1% by weight, preferably about 0.01 - about 0.1% by weight, more preferably about 0.01 - about 0.09% by weight. In another preferable aspect, the clear liquid detergent of the present invention can be prepared by blending liquid sodium silicate in an amount of about 1 - about 7.5% by weight, especially in an amount of about 1 - about 6% by weight, the metal-chelating agent in an amount of about 0.5 - about 3% by weight, especially in an amount of about 0.5 - about 2.5% by weight, the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid in an amount of about 5 - about 15% by weight, especially in an amount of about 5 - about 12.5% by weight, the alkali metal hydroxide in an amount of about 1 - about 4.5% by weight, especially in an amount of about 1 - about 4% by weight, the fluorosurfactant in an amount of 0 - about 0.1% by weight, especially in an amount of 0 - about 0.09% by weight, the polyoxyethylene alkyl<br>
                       17   <br><br>
or aryl ether nonionic surfactant in an amount of about 1 - about 10% by weight, especially in an amount of about 1 - about 8.5% by weight, the alkylethersulfate salt anionic surfactant in an amount of about 1 - about 15% by weight, especially in an amount of about 1 - about 14% by weight, the freezing/clouding inhibitor in an amount of about 0.1 - about 3% by weight, especially in an amount of about 0.1 - about 2.5% by weight, and the balance of water.  In this case, needless to say, the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid and the alkali metal hydroxide are present in the final clear liquid detergent not as they are in original states, but the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid are present in the final clear liquid detergent in the form of alkali metal salts after reacted with the alkali metal. The amount of the alkylbenzenesulfonate, corresponding . to the amount of alkylbenzenesulfonic acid used, can be calculated stoichiometrically.<br>
A particularly preferable method for preparing the clear liquid detergent of the present invention is to prepare in advance (a) an aqueous solution of an alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant by adding, to an alkylbenzenesulfonic acid, water and an alkali metal hydroxide (such as sodium hydroxide or potassium hydroxide, preferably sodium hydroxide) as a neutralizing agent for the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid in order to neutralize the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid;<br>
18<br><br>
(b) an aqueous solution of sodium silicate, which contains liquid sodium silicate, a metal-chelating agent, a pH adjusting agent and water; and (c) an aqueous solution of a mixed surfactant by blending a polyoxyethylene alkyl or aryl ether nonionic surfactant, a freezing/clouding inhibitor, an alkylethersulfate salt anionic surfactant, water and, optionally, a fluorosurfactant.<br>
Then, particularly preferably, the aqueous solution of sodium silicate (b) is gradually added to and mixed with the aqueous solution of the mixed surfactant (c), and the aqueous solution of the alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant (a) is gradually added to and mixed with the resultant mixture, thus preparing the clear liquid detergent of the present invention.<br>
The composition of each of the solution (a), solution (b) and solution (c) will now be described. In the following, the solution (a), solution (b) and solution (c) are mixed so that the total is 100 parts by weight.<br>
when preparing the aqueous solution (a) of alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant, the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid should be blended preferably in an amount of about 5 - about 15 parts by weight. If the amount of the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid blended is less than 5 parts by weight, a sufficient detergency<br><br>
power may not be obtained.  On the other hand, if the blended amount exceeds 15 parts by weight, a deposit may be created in the final detergent composition due to the interaction with sodium silicate.  It is particularly preferable that the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid be blended in an amount of about 5 - about 12.5 parts by weight.<br>
The alkali metal hydroxide, particularly sodium hydroxide, which is used as a neutralizing agent for the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid in order to prepare the aqueous solution (a) of the alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant, is blended preferably in an amount of about 1 - about 4.5 parts by weight.  If the amount of the alkali metal hydroxide is less than 1 part by weight, a sufficient neutralization of the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid may not be achieved.  On the other hand, the blended amount exceeding 4.5 parts by weight exceeds the necessary amount for the neutralization of the alkylbenzenesulfonic acid, and is not economical, and may lead to too much alkali.  It is particularly preferable that the alkali metal hydroxide be blended in an amount of about 1 - about 4 parts by weight.<br>
In the aqueous solution (a) of the alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant, water is blended preferably in an amount of about 20 - about 48.5 parts by weight.  If the amount of water blended<br>
20<br><br>
is less than 20 parts by weight, the viscosity of alkylbenzenesulfonate salt excessively increases due to the neutralization, and therefore it may become difficult to handle the solution (a).  In the solution (a), it is particularly preferable that water be blended in an amount of 20 to 44.95 parts by weight.<br>
It should be noted that when preparing the aqueous solution (a) of the alkylbenzenesulfonate salt surfactant, the metal-chelating agent can be blended in an amount of about 3 parts by weight or less, preferably in an amount of 0.5 - about 3 parts by weight, more preferably in an amount of about 0.5 - about 2.5 parts by weight, and the pH adjusting agent can be blended in an amount of about 0.5 parts by weight or less, preferably in an amount of about 0.05 - about 0.5 parts by weight, more preferably in an amount of 0.05 to about 0.45 parts by weight. In the case where the metal-chelating agent and the pH adjusting agent are added, the amount of water blended in the solution (a) should preferably be 20 to 45 parts by weight, particularly, 20 to 45 parts by weight. However, the addition of the metal-chelating agent and the pH adjusting agent tends to cause a layer separation in the solution (a) of the alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant, thus necessitating continuous stirring of the solution (a) of the alkylbenzenesulfonate salt surfactant in<br><br>
continuously producing the clear liquid detergent of the invention.<br>
In the sodium silicate aqueous solution <b the liquid sodium silicate is blended preferably in an amount of about parts by weight. if less than part weight a sufficient detergency effect may not be obtained whereas exceeds silica deposit created. it preferable that to></b>
In the sodium silicate aqueous solution (b), the metal-chelating agent is blended preferably in an amount of about 0.5 - about 3 parts by weight.  If the blended amount of the metal-chelating agent is less than 0.5 parts by weight, a sufficient chelating effect for the sodium silicate may not be obtained.  If the blended amount exceeds 3 parts by weight, the chelating effect is not particularly improved.  It is particularly preferable that the metal-chelating agent be blended in an amount of about 0.5 to about 2.5 parts by weight.<br>
In the sodium silicate aqueous solution (b), the pH adjusting agent is blended preferably in an amount of about 0.05 - about 5 parts by weight.  If the blended amount of the pH adjusting agent is less than<br>
22<br><br>
0.05 parts by weight, it may not contribute to the adjustment of pH (lowering of pH).  If the blended amount exceeds 5 parts by weight, pH may be excessively lowered.  It is particularly preferable that the Ph adjusting agent be blended in an amount of about 0.05 - about 4 parts by weight.<br>
In the sodium silicate aqueous solution (b), water is blended preferably in an amount of about 1 - about 20 parts by weight.  If the amount is less than 1 part by weight, organic acids such as the pH adjusting agent may not sufficiently dissolve.  In the solution (b), it is particularly preferable that water be blended in an amount of about 1 to about 18 parts by weight.<br>
Next, in the aqueous solution (c) of the mixed surfactant, the polyoxyethylene alkyl or aryl ether nonionic surfactant is blended preferably in an amount of about 1 - about 10 parts by weight.  If the amount of the nonionic surfactant blended is less than 1 part by weight, a sufficient detergency effect may not be obtained.  On the other hand, if the blended amount exceeds 10 parts by weight, the viscosity may excessively increase or foaming may occur, causing a difficulty in handling the obtained solution (c). It is particularly preferable that the nonionic surfactant be blended in an amount of about 1 - about 8.5 parts by weight.<br>
In the aqueous solution (c) of the mixed<br>
23<br><br>
surfactant, the alkylethersulfate salt anionic surfactant be blended preferably in an amount of about 1 - about 15 parts by weight.  If the amount of the anionic surfactant blended is less than 1 part by weight, a sufficient detergency effect may not be obtained.  On the other hand, if the blended amount exceeds 15 parts by weight, the viscosity may excessively increase or foaming may be generated, causing a difficulty in handling the obtained solution (c).  It is particularly preferable that the anionic surfactant should be in an amount of about 1 - about 14 parts by weight.<br>
In the aqueous solution (c) of the mixed surfactant, the freezing/clouding inhibitor is blended preferably in an amount of about 0.1 - about 3 parts by weight,  if the amount of the freezing/clouding inhibitor blended is less than 0.1 part by weight, a sufficient freezing/clouding inhibiting effect may not be obtained.  On the other hand, if the blended amount thereof exceeds 3 parts by weight, the detergency effect may become an equilibrium state or foaming may be generated causing a difficulty in handling the obtained solution (c).  It is particularly preferable that the freezing/clouding inhibitor be blended in an amount of abut 0.1 - about 2.5 parts by weight.<br>
In the aqueous solution <c of the mixed surfactant water is blended preferably in an amount></c>
24<br><br>
about 10 to about 30.1 parts by weight.  If the amount of water blended is less than 10 part by weight, the viscosity of the solution (c) may become excessively high, causing a difficulty in handling the obtained solution.  It is particularly preferable that water be blended in an amount of about 10 - about 28.09 parts by weight.<br>
In the aqueous solution (c) of the mixed surfactant, the fluorosurfactant, if contained, is blended preferably in an amount of about 0.1 part by weight or less, more preferably about 0.01 - 0.1 part by weight.  If the amount of the fluorosurfactant is less than 0.01 part by weight, a sufficient detergency power to be obtained from the surfactant may not be exhibited sufficiently.  On the other hand, if the blended amount thereof exceeds 0.1 part by weight, the detergency effect may not be further improved.  It is particularly preferable that the fluorosurfactant be blended in an amount of 0.01 - about 0.09 parts by weight.  In the case where the fluorosurfactant is added, the amount of water blended into the aqueous solution (c) of the mixed surfactant is preferably about 10 to about 30 parts by weight, particularly preferably about 10 to about 2 8 parts by weight.<br>
The water used in the present invention may be any water including distilled water, purified pure water, ion exchanged soft water, regular tap water, and ground<br>
25<br><br>
water.  However, it is preferable that water from which iron component has been removed be used.<br>
Further, the clear liquid detergent of the present invention can contain a viscosity adjusting agent such as carboxymethylcellulose for the purpose of adjusting the viscosity.<br>
In the case where alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant itself is used as the starting material, the alkali metal hydroxide as a neutralizing agent is not necessary.  In such a case, it is possible to prepare an aqueous solution, corresponding to the aqueous solution (a) of the alkylbenzenesulfonate salt anionic surfactant, by using about 5 - about 15.5 parts by weight of alkylbenzenesulfonate (preferably about 5.125 parts by weight - about 15.375 parts by weight), 0 - about 3 parts by weight of the metal-chelating agent, 0 - about 0.5 parts by weight of the pH adjusting agent, and about 21.55 - 30 parts by weight of water (preferably about 21.55 - about 29.5 parts by weight).  Then, the clear liquid detergent of the present invention can be prepared by using this together with the aqueous solution (c) of the mixed surfactant and the aqueous solution (b) of sodium silicate and blending them similarly.<br>
The clear liquid detergent of the present invention maintains the transparency of a so-called crystal-clear type, which does not generate a deposit<br><br>
or precipitate (precipitate such as silica precipitated from sodium silicate, or sodium sulfate made by the reaction between the surfactant and alkali) without creating cloud even the temperature varies, and the detergent is readily dissolved in water.  Further, the detergent of the present invention is far superior to the conventional detergent in terms of detergency power. The clear liquid detergent composition of the present invention exhibits an excellent detergency power in cleaning of clothes, and cleaning of a washing niche, toilet, bathroom including a bath tub.  Further, when diluted with water, the detergent exhibits an excellent power in cleaning dishes.  When diluted with water 1000-fold, the clear liquid detergent of the present invention exhibits a weak alkalinity (a pH value of higher than 7, but less than 8).  Further, since the amount of the nonionic surfactant used is extremely limited, the detergent is environmentally friendly. For example, in the case where the clear liquid detergent of the present invention is used for washing clothes, it is preferable that the clear liquid detergent of the present invention be dissolved at ratio of 0.8 to l.Og per 1L (liter) of water.

As to the clear liquid detergents A to D obtained as above, the amounts of the components in % by weight are shown in TABLE 1 below.  Further, for each of the clear liquid detergents A to D, a pH value and a pH<br>
34<br><br>
value measured in accordance with JIS K3362-1990 (that is, pH value obtained when diluted with water by 1000-fold: in TABLE 1, it is indicated as a 1000-fold diluted pH value) are indicated in TABLE 1, as well. It should be noted that the pH measurement was carried out by using HM-202, a glass electrode pH meter of TOA DENPA INDUSTRIES Ltd., at a temperature of 15°C.<br><br><br><br>
35<br>
The clear liquid detergents A to D obtained in the above EXAMPLES 1 to 4 were measured in terms of transparency, detergency power, stability, cloudiness and viscosity as described below.<br><transparency><br>
200 mL (mililiter) of each of the detergents is placed in a respective clear glass container having a diameter of 60 mm, and it is evaluated as to whether or not letters in a normal-size Japanese to English dictionary can be identified through the liquid detergent, on the basis of the following standards:<br>
O: letters can be clearly read<br>
A: they can be read, but with some difficulty<br>
X: they cannot at all be read<br><evaluation of detergency power><br>
The evaluation of the detergency power was made by the method of evaluating a synthetic detergent for clothes defined in JIS K3362-1990, 7.1, as follows.<br>
a)  Preparation of Dirty Collar Cloth<br>
An Indian cotton white cloth was cut into a size of 11 X 13 cm, and two cut cloth pieces were sewed together to match the short and long sides in the same texture pattern direction with a seam allowance of 1 cm. Thus, a collar cloth (11 X 24 cm) was made.  A many number of such cloth pieces were prepared.<br>
The collar cloth pieces were stitched onto the collars of work clothes, and the work clothes were worn<br>
37<br><br>
by workers, who work under ordinary working conditions for 2 to 7 days, thus preparing dirty collar clothes.<br>
Of the dirty collar clothes, those which became dirty uniformly to the left and right of the seam line were selected, and they were divided into three levels, that is, very dirty, fairly dirty and little dirty, in accordance with the degree of the dirtiness.  5 of dirty collar clothes were prepared for each level, and therefore a total of 15 clothes were prepared.  Then, the thread sewing the seaming allowance portion of each dirty collar cloth was removed, to separate it into two, which were to be used for test.  Before the thread on the sewing allowance portion is removed from each dirty collar cloth, symbols which indicate that dirty collar closes are of a symmetrical pair (for example, No. 1 and No. li) were marked on both corners of the cloth with an oil marking pen.<br>
In the manner described as above, 8 sets each consisting of 15 test cloth pieces were prepared.<br>
b)  Preparation of Detergency Power Determining Test Solution<br>
1.  Reference Detergent for Determining Detergency power<br>
Sodium linear dodecylbenzenesulfonate, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium silicate, sodium carbonate, sodium carboxymethylcellulose and sodium sulfate, each of which were prescribed, were mixed at a weight ratio<br>
38<br><br>
of 15 : 17 : 10 : 3 : 1 : 58, and dried at about 105°C, then made into powder.  1.33g of the powder, in terms of the amount of anhydride, was weighed out and dissolved into 1000 ml of the prescribed use water (obtained by dissolving 133 mg of potassium chloride dihydrate to water to make a total amount of 1000 ml).<br>
There were prepared four of such a reference detergent solution.<br>
2.  Each of the liquid detergents A to D of EXAMPLES 1 to 4 was dissolved into 1000 ml of the prescribed use water at 1 g/L.<br>
c) Operation<br>
(1)	Into 1L of each of the reference detergent<br>
solutions for determining the detergency power and the<br>
aqueous detergent solutions of EXAMPLES 1 to 4 (at 30°C),<br>
one set of dirty collar cloth (15 pieces) prepared as<br>
test cloth was put.  Meanwhile, one set of dirty collar<br>
cloth (15 pieces) which make pairs with the above,<br>
was put into 1L of each of the reference detergent solutions.  The dirty collar cloth was washed in each detergent solution for 10 minutes using a detergency power testing machine of the prescribed mixing mode (rotation number 120±5 rotations per minute).<br>
(2)	After finishing the washing, each sample<br>
cloth was squeezed softly and put into 1L of the<br>
prescribed use water of 30°C, so as to be rinsed for<br>
30 minutes, using the mixing type detergency power<br>
39<br><br>
testing machine noted above.  This operation was repeated two times.<br>
(3)  After finishing the rinsing, each test cloth was air-dried, and a test cloth cleaned with a reference detergent solution and a corresponding test cloth cleaned with a detergent solution of a respective one of EXAMPLES 1 to 4, were stitched together into a pair, followed by ironing.  In this manner, test samples of 15 X 4 were prepared in total.<br>
d)  Evaluation<br>
15 pairs of test sample cloth pieces were placed in the order of marked symbols, and the degree of removing of the dirt on a sample cloth cleaned with the detergent solution of the present invention, as compared to the test cloth of each pair, which was cleaned with the reference detergent solution, was evaluated by three panelists on the basis of the following standard while they compared the test cloth pieces on the left and right sides, of each pair with each other.<br>
-2 : clearly inferior<br>
-1 : somewhat inferior 0 : not substantially different<br>
+1 : somewhat superior<br>
+2 : clearly superior<br>
The results were indicated in TABLES 2 to 5.<br>

The four 400 mL-glass containers were filled with 5    the detergents of EXAMPLES 1 to 4, and they were air-tightly stoppered.  After preserved for one month at 35oC, the stability was evaluated on the basis of the following standards.<br>
O = Separation between alkylbenzenesulfonate and 10     sodium silicate was not observed<br>

200 ml of each of the detergents of EXAMPLES 1 to 4 was placed in a respective glass container with a stopper, having a diameter of 60 mm, and the cloudiness created by silica in sodium silicate and alkylbenzenesulfonate was evaluated by eye on the basis of the following standards.<br>
O = No cloudiness at all<br>
? = A little cloudy<br>
X = Cloudy<br><viscosity><br>
The detergents A to D obtained in EXAMPLES 1 to 4 were measured in terms of viscosity (cP) using a C-type viscosity meter of TOKYO KEIKI (Co., Ltd.) at 20°C.<br>
The results for the transparency, detergency power evaluation, stability, cloudiness and viscosity are indicated in TABLE 6 below.<br><br><br><br>
EXAMPLES 5 to 8<br>
Clear liquid detergents E to H having compositions specified in TABLE 7 were prepared in similar manner to those of EXAMPLES 1 to 4 except that the amount of components blended was varied in preparation of the solution (a) and solution (b).  In these examples, the aqueous solutions (a) of the alkylbenzenesulfonate salt surfactants did not create the separation of layer at all, and therefore it was not necessary to carry out stirring.  Thus, it was made possible to facilitate the continuous production of the clear liquid detergent.<br>
The clear liquid detergents E to H were evaluated in terms of the transparency, detergency power evaluation, stability, cloudiness and viscosity, and substantially the same results as those of the detergents A to D of EXAMPLES 1 to 4 were obtained, which were indicated in TABLE 8 below.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
As is clear from the results of the above-described EXAMPLES, the clear liquid detergent of the present invention has an excellent transparency, and is stable, does not become cloudy, and exhibits an excellent detergency power.<br>
As described above, according to the present invention, there is provided a clear liquid detergent containing an alkylbenzenesulfonate anionic salt surfactant and sodium silicate, which has an excellent transparency and extremely high detergency power, maintains its transparency for a long period of time, and does not create the separation phenomenon due to the difference in specific gravity, cloudiness, gelation or the like.  There has been no such a clear liquid detergent conventionally, but it is provided for the first time by the present invention.  Further, with the clear liquid detergent of the present invention, since it contains sodium silicate, the amount of the synthetic surfactant used can be reduced significantly, and therefore it is environmentally preferable detergent.<br>
