The following specification particularly describes the invention and the<br>
manner in which it is to be performed.<br><br>
l<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical composition comprising Misoprostol for vaginal suppository dosage form and process for preparation thereof.<br>
The objective of the present invention is to provide pharmaceutical composition using active pharmaceutical ingredient Misoprostol for cervical ripening, labor induction, mid-trimester terminations of pregnancy.<br>
One another objective of the present invention is to provide Misoprostol composition for the vaginal suppository (ovules) dosage form to counteract postpartum hemorrhage.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide the Misoprostol composition for the vaginal suppository dosage form with higher efficacy, quick onset of action due to enhanced absorption as well as faster disintegration and faster dissolution than the conventional misoprostol formulation. PRIOR ART:<br>
Misoprostol is used for obstetric and gynecological problems or gynecological dysfunction to the human body. Misoprostol is effective drug for the treatment of such problems, with low cost and easy administeration by vaginal route.<br>
2<br><br>
Misoprostol is an analog of Prostaglandin El. Prostaglandin are naturally occurring fatty acids produced by many tissues in the body. Prostaglandin El causes myometrial contractions by interacting with specific receptors on myometrial cells. This interaction results in a cascade of events, including a change in calcium concentration, thereby initiating muscle contraction.<br>
By interacting with prostaglandin receptors, Misoprostol causes the cervix to soften and the uterus to contract, resulting in the expulsion of the uterine contents. Misoprostol is relatively metabolically resistant, and thus has prolonged action.<br>
Misoprostol regimen begins with the vaginal administration of 800 ug of Misoprostol. Misoprostol has also been shown effective in treating postpartum hemorrhage and early pregnancy failure.<br>
In the beginning of early 1990s, Misoprostol alone was used as a method of terminating early pregnancies. A growing body of evidence has now shown that Misoprostol can be used as a single agent to induce early abortion.<br>
Mesoprostol is a low cost drug. It is stable at ambient temperature and hence does not require refrigeration for storage. Due to this stable<br>
3<br><br>
nature, there is an ease in transportation of the product. These characteristic of misoprostol enhances its significance as medication for absortion.<br>
Nearly every measure of adequacy of labor induction was significantly better with Misoprostol, including time from induction to delivery and lack of necessity for oxytocin.<br>
Patent Application No. 020607 is based on delayed release oral tablet of Diclofenac Sodium and Misoprostol. The dosage form contains 0.2 mg Misoprostol and 50 mg or 75 mg of Diclofenac Sodium.<br>
Patent Application No. 019268 is based on oral tablet of Misoprostol. The dosage form is prepared by using 0.1 mg or 0.2 mg Misoprostol drug.<br>
Patent Application No. 076095 is based on oral tablet of Misoprostol. The dosage form is prepared by using 0.1 mg or 0.2 mg Misoprostol drug.<br>
China patent application No. 00123869 describes, suppository for treating cervical erosion and vaginitis. The suppository is prepared by using five Chinese medicinal material including Cortex Phellodendri, Rhizoma Zedoariae, pofygoni avicularis herba, alumen and pricklyash and through the processes pulverizing Chinese medicinal materials in to fine powder, heating the mixture of glycerin, gelatin and distilled water in water bath to<br>
4<br><br>
dissolve into medium, mixing the hot medium, the medicinal materials and honey, molding, cooling naturally, packing and disinfecting. This is good medicine of preventing and treating cervical erosion, vaginitis and other diseases of women.<br>
Patent no. WO 00/09134 is claiming use of Misoprostol or Misoprostol acid for preparing of a pharmaceutical product applied to be topically to the clitoris or/and the vagina in order to cure sexual dysfunction in women. The use of Misoprostol and its acids in the form of various galenic preparations (solutions, ointments, endourethral sticks, systems of controlled-transdermal absorption). The pharmaceutical product is prepared in combination with other vasodilatory drugs as alprostadil for the synergistic action, as well as "passage accelerators" used normally in pharmaceutical technology to increase absorption of drugs through the skin or mucosa. Pharmaceutical product using Misoprostol or its acid is also prepared in combination with cyclodextrin or other substances to retard the undesired effects of the drug or prolong their pharmaceutical action.<br>
US patent no. 6,664,290 relates to a method of limiting postpartum hemorrhage comprising administering orally a single effective dose of misoprostol to a woman during the third stage of the labor.<br>
5<br><br>
At present Misoprostol is available as oral tablets of strength 100 ug and 200 \xg. Misoprostol is available in tablet dosage form is also administered in female vagina, two to four tablets are required at a time for vaginal insertion. Tablet wetted with water is administered in vagina. There may be chances of non dissolution of tablet in the vagina. After the administration of tablet, other excipients present in the tablet may not dissolve in vagina and may come out of it giving ugly feeling. To over come from such drawbacks, there is need to prepare a novel composition of Misoprostol.<br>
Pharmaceutical formulations of Misoprostol are widely available in market for the treatment of stomach ulcers.<br>
The above mentioned prior art and other market search shows that, at present Misoprostol is available in tablet dosage form comprising one or more pharmaceutical excipients and/or drugs in the treatment of male erectile dysfunction, gastric and duodenal ulcers, female sexual dysfunction and hepto biliary diseases.<br>
In the present invention of pharmaceutical composition containing misoprostol is in the form of for suppository (ovule) and, is administered through the. vaginal route. Pharmaceutical composition of misoprostol as prepared as in the present invention is having good efficacy, quick onset of<br>
6<br><br>
action due to enhanced absorption because of synergistic effect of other excipients, faster disintegration and faster dissolution. The present pharmaceutical composition is used for cervical ripening, labor induction and to counteract postpartum hemorrhage. In the preparation process of pharmaceutical composition for suppository dosage form, the use of other pharmaceutical ingredients in addition to misoprostol gives synergistic effect in enhancing of drug absorption in systemic circulation, which results into rapid onset of action. Isopropyl myristate and cholesterol enhances the absorption of misoprostol through vaginal walls.<br>
Moreover, in the said invention Misoprostol composition prepared for the suppository dosage form administered through vaginal route, imparts several advantages over conventional dosage forms. Suppository form (i) melts at body temperature, (ii)easy to use, (iii)ability and flexibility to deliver the drug with different release rates, (iv) required less frequent doses, (v) easily removable if needed (vi) can be administered in unconscious patients.<br>
Comparative analysis has been carried out between the Misoprostol composition for suppository dosage form of the present invention and Misoprostol Tablets (X) as presently available dosage form in the market. Comparative  disintegration  study  has  been  carried  out.   Results  are<br>
7<br><br>
mentioned in the table given below and are compared by plotting the graph of Formulation Vs Disintegration time in minutes. The graph is annexed as in figure 1.<br><br>
Drug Formulation	Disintegration Time (Minutes)<br>
Misoprostol Oral Tablets	10 Minutes<br>
Misoprostol in oily base Suppository dosage form.	3 Minutes<br>
Misoprostol in Polyethylene Glycol base(water     soluble)     Suppository dosage form.	5 Minutes<br>
From the  above results  it  is  concluded that the Misoprostol<br>
suppository in Oily Base and Suppository in Aqueous Base require less<br>
time   for   disintegration   than   Oral   tablets   of Misoprostol.      Faster<br>
disintegration occurs in Misoprostol leads to faster dissolution, that results<br>
into rapid site specific onset of action over existing oral dosage form of<br>
Misoprostol.<br>
Comparative analysis on application of Presently invented Misoprostol composition Vs conventional tablet for the various treatments:<br><br>
