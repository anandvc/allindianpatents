TITLE OF THE INVENTION SUBSTITUTED AMIDES ACTIVE AT THE CANNABINOID-1 RECEPTOR<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
Not applicable. BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Marijuana (Cannabis saliva L.) and its derivatives have been used for centuries for medicinal and recreational purposes. A major active ingrethent in marijuana and hashish has been determined to be A-tetrahydrocannabinol (A-THC). Detailed research has revealed that the biological action of A9-THC and other members of the cannabinoid family occurs through two G-protein coupled receptors termed CB1 and CB2. The CB1 receptor is primarily found in the central and peripheral nervous systems and to a lesser extent in several peripheral organs. The CB2 receptor is found primarily in lymphoid tissues and cells. Three endogenous ligands for the cannabinoid receptors derived from arachidonic acid have been identified (anandamide, 2-arachidonoyl glycerol, and 2-arachidonyl glycerol ether). Each is an agonist with activities similar to A-THC, including sedation, hypothermia, intestinal immobility, antinociception, analgesia, catalepsy, anti-emesis, and appetite stimulation.<br>
The genes for the respective cannabinoid receptors have each been disrupted in mice. The CB 1 -I- receptor knockout mice appeared normal and fertile. They were resistant to the effects of A-THC and demonstrated a strong reduction in the reinforcing properties of morphine and the severity of withdrawal syndrome. They also demonstrated reduced motor activity and hypoalgesia.     Excessive exposure to A-THC can lead to overeating, psychosis, hypothermia, memory loss, and sedation. There is at least one CBl modulator characterized as an inverse agonist or an antagonist, N-(l-piperidinyl)-5-{4-chlorophenyl)-l-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methylpyrazcle-3-carboxamide (SR141716A), in clinical trials for treatment of eating disorders at this time. There still remains a need for potent low molecular weight CB 1 modulators that have pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties suitable for use as human pharmaceuticals.<br>
Treatment of asthma with CB 1 receptor modulators (such as CB! inverse agonists) is supported by the finding that presynaptic cannabinoid CB 1<br><br>
receptors mediate the inhibition of noradrenaline release (in the guinea pig lung) (Europ. J. of Pharmacology, 2001, 431 (2), 237-244).<br>
Treatment ofcirrhosisofthe liver with CBl receptor modulators is supported by the finding that a CBl receptor modulator will reverse the low blood pressure observed in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis and will lower the elevated mesenteric blood flow and portal vein pressure (Nature Medicine, 2001,7(7), 827-832).<br>

Examples of "cycloheteroalkyl" include indolyl, azaindolyl and the like. The cycloheteroalkyl ring may be substituted on the ring carbons and/or the ring nitrogens.<br>
"Halogen" includes fluorine, chlorine, bromine and iodine.<br>
When any variable (e.g., Rl, R, etc.) occurs more than one time in any constituent or in formula I, its definition on each occurrence is independent of its definition at every other occurrence. Also, combinations of substituents and/or variables are permissible only if such combinations result in stable compounds.<br>
Under standard nomenclature used throughout this disclosure, the terminal portion of the designated side chain is described first, followed by the adjacent functionality toward the point of attachment. For example, a C1-5 alkylcarbonylamino C1.6 alkyl substituent is equivalent to<br><br>
In choosing compounds of the present invention, one of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that the various substituents, i.e. R, R, etc., are to be chosen in conformity with well-known principles of chemical structure connectivity and stability.<br>
The term "substituted" shall be deemed to include multiple degrees of substitution by a named substitutent. Where multiple substituent moieties are disclosed or claimed, the substituted compound can be independently substituted by one or more of the disclosed or claimed substituent moieties, singly or plurally. By independently substituted, it is meant that the (two or more) substituents can be the same or different.<br>
Compounds of Formula I may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers.<br><br>
diastereomeric mixtures and individual diastereomers. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I.<br>
Some of the compounds described herein contain olefinic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.<br>
Tautomers are defined as compounds that undergo rapid proton shifts from one atom of the compound to another atom of the compound. Some of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers with different points of attachment of hydrogen. Such an example may be a ketone and its enol form known as keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixture thereof are encompassed with compounds of Formula I.<br>
Compounds of the Formula I may be separated into diastereoisomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example, finctional crystallization fi-om a suitable solvent, for example MeOH or EtOAc or a mixture thereof The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual stereoisomers by conventional means, for example by the use of an optically active amine as a resolving agent or on a chiral HPLC column.<br>
Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound of the general Formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration.<br>
It is generally preferable to administer compounds of the present invention as enantiomerically pure formulations. Racemic mixtures can be separated into their individual enantiomers by any of a number of conventional methods. These include chiral chromatography, derivatization with a chiral auxiliary followed by separation by chromatography or crystallization, and fractional crystallization of diastereomeric salts.<br>
Furthermore, some of the crystalline forms for compounds of the present invention may exist as polymorphs and as such are intended to be included in the present invention. In addition, some of the compounds of the instant invention may form solvates with water or common organic solvents. Such solvates are encompassed within the scope of this invention.<br>
The term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic or organic bases and inorganic or organic acids. Salts derived from inorganic bases<br><br>
include aluminum, ammonium, calcium, copper, ferric, ferrous, lithium, magnesium, manganic salts, manganous, potassium, sodium, zinc, and the like. Particularly preferred are the ammonium, calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium salts.

Compounds of the present invention are modulators of the CBl receptor. In particular, the compounds of structural formula I are antagonists or inverse agonists of the CBl receptor.<br>
An "agonist" is a compound (hormone, neurotransmitter or synthetic compound) which binds to a receptor, inducing a conformational change in the receptor which, in turn, produces a response such as contraction, relaxation, secretion, change in enzyme activity, etc, similar to that elicited by the physiologically relevant agonist ligand(s) for that receptor.   An "antagonist" is a compound which attenuates<br><br>
the effect of an agonist. An "inverse agonist" is a compound which acts on a receptor but produces the opposite effect produced by the agonist of the particular receptor.<br>
Compounds of this invention are modulators of the CBl receptor and as such are useful as centrally acting drugs in the treatment of psychosis, memory deficits, cognitive disorders, migraine, neuropathy, neuro-inflammatory disorders including multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barre syndrome and the inflammatory sequelae of viral encephalitis, cerebral vascular accidents, and head trauma, anxiety disorders, stress, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, movement disorders, and schizophrenia. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of substance abuse disorders, particularly to opiates, alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of obesity or eating disorders associated with excessive food intake and complications associated therewith. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of constipation and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of cirrhosis of the liver. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of asthma.<br>
The terms "administration of and or "administering a" compound should be understood to mean providing a compound of the invention or a prodrug of a compound of the invention to the individual in need of treatment.<br>
The administration of the compound of structural formula I in order to practice the present methods of therapy is carried out by administering an effective amount of the compound of structural formula I to the patient in need of such treatment or prophylaxis. The need for a prophylactic administration according to the methods of the present invention is determined via the use of well known risk factors. The effective amount of an individual compound is determined, in the final analysis, by the physician in charge of the case, but depends on factors such as the exact disease to be treated, the severity of the disease and other diseases or conditions from which the patient suffers, the chosen route of administration other drugs and treatments which the patient may concomitandy require, and other factors in the physician's judgment.<br>
The utilities of the present compounds in these diseases or disorders may be demonstrated in animal disease models that have been reported in the literature. The following are examples of such animal disease models: a) suppression of food intake and resultant weight loss in rats (Life Sciences 1998, 63, 113-117); b) reduction of sweet food intake in marmosets (Behavioural Pharm. 1998, 9, 179-181);<br><br>
c) reduction of sucrose and ethanol intake in mice (Psychopharm. 1997, 132, 104-106); d) increased motor activity and place conditioning in rats (Psychophann. 1998, 135, 324-332; Psychopharmacol 2000, 151: 25-30); e) spontaneous locomotor activity in mice (J. Phann. Exp. Ther. ] 996, 277, 586-594); f) reduction in opiate self-administration in mice (Sci. 1999, 283, 401-404); g) bronchial hyperresponsiveness in sheep and guinea pigs as models for the various phases of asthma (for example, see W. M. Abraham et al., "a4-Integrins mediate antigen-induced late bronchial<br>
responses and prolonged airway hyperresponsiveness in sheep." J. Clin. Invest. 93, 776 (1993) and A. A. Y. Milne and P. P. Piper, "Role of VLA-4 integrin in leucocyte recruitment and bronchia) hyperresponsiveness in the gunea-pig." Eur. J. Pharmacol., 282, 243 (1995)); h) mediation of the vasodilated state in advanced liver cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (Nature Medicine, 2001, 7 (7), 827-832); i) amitriptyline-induced constipation in cynomolgus monkeys is beneficial for the evaluation of laxatives (Biol. Pharm. Bulletin (Japan), 2000, 23(5), 657-9); j) neuropathology of paediatric chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and animal models related to the neuropathology of paediatric chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (Journal of Pathology (England), 2001,194 (3), 277-88).<br>
The magnitude of prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of Formula I will, of course, vary with the nature of the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound ofFormula I and its route of administration. It will also vary according to the age, weight and response of the individual patient. In general, the daily dose range lie within the range of from about 0.001 mg to about lOOragperkgbody weight of a mammal, preferably O.OI mg to about 50 mg per kg, and most preferably 0.1 to lOmgper kg, in single or divided doses. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages outside these limits in some cases.<br>
For use where a composition for intravenous administration is employed, a suitable dosage range is from about 0.001 mg to about 25 mg (preferably from 0.01 mg to about 1 mg) of a compound of Formula I per kg of body weight per day and for preventive use from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg (preferably from about 1 mg to about 100 mg and more preferably from about 1 mg to about 10 mg) of a compound of Formula I per kg of body weight per day.<br>
In the case where an oral composition is employed, a suitable dosage range is, e.g. from about 0.01 mg to about 1000 mg of a compound ofFormula I per day, preferably from about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing from 0.01<br><br>
to 1,000 mg, preferably 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750 or 1000 milligrams of the active ingrethent for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprises a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term "composition", as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingrethent{s), and the inert ingrethent(s) (pharmaceutically acceptable excipients) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingrethents, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingrethents, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingrethents. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of Formula I, additional active ingrethent(s), and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dosage of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula 1 as an active ingrethent or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingrethents. By "pharmaceutically acceptable" it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingrethents of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof In particular, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids.<br>
The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (aerosol inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingrethent. They may be<br><br>
conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
For administration by inhalation, the compounds of the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or nebulizers. The compounds may also be delivered as powders which may be formulated and the powder composition may be inhaled with the aid of an insufflation powder inhaler device. The preferred delivery systems for inhalation are metered dose inhalation (MDI) aerosol, which may be formulated as a suspension or solution of a compound of Formula I in suitable propellants, such as fluorocarbons or hydrocarbons and dry powder inhalation (DPI) aerosol, which may be formulated as a dry powder of a compound of Formula I with or without additional excipients.<br>
Suitable topical formulations of a compound of formula I include transdermal devices, aerosols, creams, solutions, ointments, gels, lotions, dusting powders, and the like. The topical pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of the present invention ordinarily include about 0.005% to 5% by weight of the active compound in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Transdermal skin patches useful for administering the compounds of the present inveniton include those well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
In practical use, the compounds of Formula I can be combined as the active ingrethent in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microciystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like in the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case<br><br>
solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the presem invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules (including timed release and sustained release formulations), pills, cachets, powders, granules or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingrethent, as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion, incluidng elixirs, tinctures, solutions, suspensions, syrups and emulsions. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingrethent with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingrethents. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingrethent with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingrethents. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine, the active ingrethent in a free-flowing form such as powder or granules, optionally mixed with a binder, lubricant, inert diluent, surface active or dispersing agent. Molded tablets may be made by molding in a suitable machine, a mixture of the powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. Desirably, each tablet contains from 0.01 to 1,000 mg, particularly 0.01, 0.05, 0,1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15, 25, 50, 75, 100, 125, 150, 175, 180, 200, 225, 500, 750 and 1,000 milligrams of the active ingrethent for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated, and each cachet or capsule contains from about 0,02 to 1,000 mg, particularly 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.5, 3, 5, 6, 10, 15,25,50,75,100,125, 150, 175, 180, 200, 225, 500, 750 and 1,000 milligrams of the active ingrethent for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated.<br>
Additional suitable means of administration of the compounds of the present invention include injection, intravenous bolus or infusion, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous, intramuscular and topical, with or without occlusion.<br>
Exempliiying the invention is a phannaceutical composition comprising any of the compounds described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Also exemplifying the invention is a pharmaceutical composition made by<br><br>
combining any of the compounds described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. An illustration of the invention is a process for making a pharmaceutical composition comprising combining any of the compounds described above and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier.<br>
The dose may be administered in a single daily dose or the total daily dosage may be administered in divided doses of two, three or four times daily. Furthermore, based on the properties of the individual compound selected for administration, the dose may be administered less frequently, e.g., weekly, twice weekly, monthly, etc. The unit dosage will, of course, be correspondingly larger for the less frequent administration.<br>
When administered via intranasal routes, transdermal routes, by rectal or vaginal suppositories, or through a continual intravenous solution, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>

Compounds of Formula I may be used in combination with other drugs that are used in the treatment/prevention/suppression or amelioration of the diseases or conditions for which compounds of Formula I are useful. Such other drugs may be administered, by a route and in an amount commonly used therefor, contemporaneously or sequentially with a compound of Formula I. When a compound of Formula I is used contemporaneously with one or more other drugs, a pharmaceutical composition containing such other drags in addition to the compound of Formula I is preferred. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention include those that also contain one or more other active ingrethents, in addition to a compound of Formula I. Examples of other active ingrethents that may be combined with a compound of Formula 1 include, but are not limited to: antipsychotic agents, cognition enhancing agents, anti-migraine agents, anti-asthmatic agents, antiinflammatory agents, axiolytics, anti-Parkinson's agents, anti-epileptics, anorectic agents, and serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and other anti-obesity agents which may be administered separately or in the same pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
It will be appreciated that for the treatment or prevention of eating disorders, including obesity, bulimia nervosa and compulsive eating disorders, a compound of the present invention may be used in conjunction with other anorectic agents.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for the treatment or prevention of eating disorders, which method comprises administration to a patient in need of such treatment an amount of a compound of the present invention and an amount of an anorectic agent, such that together they give effective relief.<br><br>
"Obesity" is a condition in which there is an excess of body fat. The operational definition of obesity is based on the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is calculated as body weight per height in meters squared (kg/m2). "Obesity" refers to a condition whereby an otherwise healthy subject has a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2, or a condition whereby a subject with at least one co¬morbidity has a BMI greater than or equal to 27 k;g/m2. An "obese subject" is an otherwise healthy subject with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 or a subject with at least one co-morbidity with a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2. A "subject at risk for obesi" is an otherwise healthy subject with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 to less than 30 kg/m2 or a subject with at least one co-morbidity with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 to less than 27 kg/m2.<br>
The increased risks associated with obesity occur at a lower Body Mass Index (BMI) in Asians, In Asian countries, including Japan, "obesity" refers to a condition whereby a subject with at least one obesity-induced or obesity-related co¬morbidity that requires weight reduction or that would be improved by weight reduction, has a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2. In Asian countries, including Japan, an "obese subject" refers to a subject with at least one obesity-induced or obesity-related co-morbidity that requires weight reduction or that would be improved by weight reduction, with a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2. In Asian countries, a "subject at risk for obesity" is a subject with a BMI of greater than 23 kg/m2 to less than 25 kg/m2.<br>
As used herein, the term "obesity" is meant to encompass all of the above definitions of obesity.<br>
Obesity-induced or obesity-related co-morbidities include, but are not limited to, diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus - type 2, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, insulin resistance syndrome, dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperuricacidemia, gout, coronary artery disease, myocardial infarction, angina pectoris sleep apnea syndrome, Pickwickian syndrome, fatty liver; cerebral infarction, cerebral thrombosis, transient ischemic attack, orthopedic disorders, arthritis deformans, lumbodynia, emmeniopathy, and infertility. In particular, co-morbidities include: hypertension, hyperlipideraia, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, and other obesity-related conditions.<br>
"Treatment" (of obesity and obesity-related disorders) refers to the administration of the compounds or compositions of the present invention to reduce or<br><br>
maintain the body weight of an obese subject. One outcome of treatment may be reducing the body weight of an obese subject relative to that subject's body weight immediately before the administration of the compounds or compositions of the present invention. Another outcome of treatment may be preventing regain of body weight previously lost as a result of thet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of treatment may be decreasing the occurrence of and/or the severity of obesity-related diseases. The treatment may suitably result in a reduction in food or calorie intake by the subject, including a reduction in total food intake, or a reduction of intake of specific components of the thet such as carbohydrates or fats; and/or the inhibition of nutrient absorption; and/or the inhibition of the reduction of metabolic rate; and in weight reduction in patients in need thereof. The treatment may also result in an alteration of metabolic rate, such as an increase in metabolic rate, rather than or in addition to an inhibition of the reduction of metabolic rate; and/or in minimization of the metabolic resistance that normally results from weight loss.<br>
"Prevention" {of obesity and obesity-related disorders) refers to the administration of the compounds or compositions of the present invention to reduce or maintain the body weight of a subject at risk for obesity. One outcome of prevention may be reducing the body weight of a subject at risk for obesity relative to that subject's body weight immediately before the administration of the compounds or compositions of the present invention. Another outcome of prevention may be preventing body weight regain of body weight previously lost as a result of thet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of prevention may be preventing obesity from occurring if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of obesity in a subject at risk for obesity. Another outcome of prevention may be decreasing the occurrence and/or severity of.obesity-related disorders if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of obesity in a subject at risk for obesity. Moreover, if treatment is commenced in already obese subjects, such treatment may prevent the occurrence, progression or severity of obesity-related disorders, such as, but not limited to, arteriosclerosis, Type II diabetes, polycystic ovarian disease, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, derraatological disorders, hypertension, insulin resistance, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridemia, and cholelithiasis.<br>
Obesity-related disorders are associated with, caused by, or result from obesity. Examples of obesity-related disorders include overeating and bulimia, hypertension, diabetes, elevated plasma insulin concentrations and insulin resistance, dyslipidemias, hyperiipidemia, endometrial, breast, prostate and colon cancer.<br><br>
osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, cholelithiasis, gallstones, heart disease, abnormal heart rhythms and anythmias, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, sudden death, stroke, polycystic ovarian disease, craniopharyngioma, the Prader-Willi Syndrome, Frohlich's syndrome, GH-deficient subjects, normal variant short stature. Turner's syndrome, and other pathological conditions showing reduced metabolic activity or a decrease in resting energy expenditure as a percentage of total fat-free mass, e.g, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Further examples of obesity-related disorders are metabolic syndrome, also known as syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome, sexual and reproductive dysfunction, such as infertility, hypogonadism in males and hirsutism in females, gastrointestinal motility disorders, such as obesity-related gastro-esophageal reflux, respiratory disorders, such as obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), cardiovascular disorders, inflammation, such as systemic inflammation of the vasculature, arteriosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, hyperuricaemia, lower back pain, gallbladder disease, gout, and kidney cancer. The compositions of the present invention are also useful for reducing the risk of secondary outcomes of obesity, such as reducing the risk of left ventricular hypertrophy.<br>
The term "diabetes," as used herein, includes both insulin-dependent diabetes meUitus (i.e., IDDM, also known as type I diabetes) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (i.e., NIDDM, also known as Type II diabetes. Type 1 diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes, is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. Type II diabetes, or insulin-independent diabetes (i.e., non-insuHn-dependent diabetes mellitus), often occurs in the face of normal, or even elevated levels of insulin and appears to be the result of the inability of tissues to respond appropriately to insulin. Most ofthe Type II diabetics are also obese. The compounds and compositions ofthe present invention are usefiil for treating both Type I and Type II diabetes. The compounds and compositions are especially effective for treating Type II diabetes. The compounds and compositions ofthe present invention are also useful for treating and/or preventing gestational diabetes mellitus.<br>
As used herein, the term "substance abuse disorders" includes substance dependence or abuse with or without physiological dependence. The substances associated with these disorders are: alcohol, amphetamines (or amphetamine-like substances), caffeine, cannabis, cocaine, hallucinogens, inhalants, marijuana, nicotine, opioids, phencyclidine (or phencyclidine-like compounds).<br><br>
sedative-hypnotics or benzodiazepines, and other (or unknown) substances and combinations of all of the above.<br>
In particular, the term "substance abuse disorders" includes drug withdrawal disorders such as alcohol withdrawal with or without perceptual disturbances; alcohol withdrawal delirium; amphetamine withdrawal; cocaine withdrawal; nicotine withdrawal; opioid withdrawal; sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal with or without perceptual disturbances; sedative, hypnotic or anxiolytic withdrawal delirium; and withdrawal sjonptoms due to other substances. It will be appreciated that reference to treatment of nicotine withdrawal includes the treatment of symptoms associated with smoking cessation.<br>
Other "substance abuse disorders" include substance-induced anxiety disorder with onset during withdrawal; substance-induced mood disorder with onset during withdrawal; and substance-induced sleep disorder with onset during withdrawal.<br>
It will be appreciated that a combination of a conventional antipsychotic drug with a CB1 receptor modulator may provide an enhanced etTect in the treatment of mania. Such a combination would be expected to provide for a rapid onset of action to treat a manic episode thereby enabling prescription on an "as needed basis". Furthermore, such a combination may enable a lower dose of the antispychotic agent to be used without compromising the efficacy of the antipsychotic agent, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse side-effects. A yet further advantage of such a combination is that, due to the action of the CB 1 receptor modulator, adverse side-effects caused by the antipsychotic agent such as acute dystonias, dyskinesias, akathesia and tremor may be reduced or prevented.<br>
The present invention also provides a method for the treatment or prevention of mania, which method comprises administration to a patient in need of such treatment or at risk of developing mania of an amount of a CBl receptor modulator and an amount of an antipsychotic agent, such that together they give effective relief<br>
It will be appreciated that the CBl receptor modulator and the antipsychotic agent may be present as a combined preparation for simultaneous, separate or sequential use for the treatment or prevention of mania.<br>
It will beappreciated that when using a combination of the present invention, the CB 1 receptor modulator and the antipsychotic agent may be in the same<br><br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and therefore administered simultaneously. They may be in separate pharmaceutical carriers such as conventional oral dosage forms which are taken simultaneously. The term "combination" also refers to the case where the compounds are provided in separate dosage forms and are administered sequentially. Therefore, by way of example, the antipsychotic agent may be administered as a tablet and then, within a reasonable period of time, the CBl receptor modulator may be administered either as an oral dosage form such as a tablet or a fast-dissolving oral dosage form. By a "fast-dissolving oral formulation" is meant, an oral delivery form which when placed on the tongue of a patient, dissolves within about 10 seconds.<br>
It will be appreciated that a combination of a conventional antipsychotic drug with a CBl receptor modulator may provide an enhanced effect in the treatment of schizophrenic disorders. Such a combination would be expected to provide for a rapid onset of action to treat schizophrenic symptoms thereby enabling prescription on an "as needed basis". Furthermore, such a combination may enable a lower dose of the CNS agent to be used without compromising the efficacy of the antipsychotic agent, thereby minimizing the risk of adverse side-effects. A yet further advantage of such a combination is that, due to the action of the CB1 receptor modulator, adverse side-effects caused by the antipsychotic agent such as acute dystonias, dyskinesias, akathesia and tremor may be reduced or prevented.<br>
It will be appreciated that a combination of a conventional anti¬asthmatic drug with a CBl receptor modulator may provide an enhanced effect in the treatment of asthma.<br>

An appropriate stock solution of A'-[2,3-bis{4-chlorophenyl)-l-methylpropyl]-amine hydrochloride (alpha isomer) was prepared immediately prior to use in pyridine with 0.05 equivalents (relative to N-[2,3-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-l-methylpropyl]-amine hydrochloride (alpha isomer)) of dimethylaminopyridine added; the diverse carboxylic acids available from commercial sources were dissolved immediately prior to use in DMSO. The relative amounts of reactants and coupling reagents are listed in Table 1. Table I.<br><br>
Procedure: To vessel one of a total of 192 dry, 10 mL fritted MYRIAD reaction vessels under nitrogen was added the appropriate diverse acid subunit (1.0 mL, 0.2 mmoles, 0.2 M in DMSO); this was repeated for the remaining 191 reactions until the diversity acids had been enumerated to all 192 reaction vessels. To each of 192 reaction vessels under nitrogen was then added the EDCiWOBt cocktail (0.8 mL, 0.2 mmoles, 0.25 M each in deuterated chloroform). Finally, to each of the 192 reaction<br><br>
vessels was added A'-|;2,3-bis(4-chlorophenyl)-l-methylpropyl]-ainine hydrochloride (alpha isomer) (0.6 mL, 0.12 mmoles, 0.2M in pyridine).

EXAMPLE 65 Cannabinoid Receptor-1 (CBl) Binding Assay.<br>
Binding affinity determination is based on recombinant human CBl receptor expressed in Chinese Hamster Ovary (CHO) cells (Felder et al, Mol. Pharmacol. 48: 443-450,1995). Total assay volume is 250 il (240 nl CBl receptor membrane solution plus 5 |al test compound solution plus 5 1 [3H]CP-55940 solution). Final concentration of [3H]CP-55940 is 0.6 nM. Binding buffer contains 50mMTris-HCi, pH7,4, 2.5 mM EDTA, 5mM MgCl2, 0.5mg/mL fatty acid free<br>
bovine serum albumin and protease inhibitors (Cat#P8340, from Sigma). To initiate the binding reaction, 5 fj.1 of radioligand solution is added, the mixture is incubated with gentle shaking on a shaker for 1.5 h at 30**C. The binding is terminated by using 96-well harvester and filtering through GF/C filter presoaked in 0.05% polyethylenimine. The bound radiolabel is quantitated using scintillation counter.<br><br>
Apparent binding affinities for various compounds are calculated from IC50 values (DeBlasi et al.. Trends Pharmacol Sci 10: 227-229, 1989).<br>
The binding assay for CB2 receptor is done similarly with recombinant human CB2 receptor expressed in CHO ceJIs.<br>
EXAMPLE 66 Cannabinoid Receptor-1 fCBH Functional Activity Assay.<br>
The functional activation of CBl receptor is based on recombinant human CBl receptor expressed in CHO cells (Felder et al, Mol. Pharmacol. 48: 443-450, 1995). To determine the agonist activity or inverse agonist activity of any test compound, 50 ul of CB1 -CHO cell suspension are mixed with test compound and 70 ul assay buffer containing 0.34 mM 3-isobutyl-l-methylxanthine and 5.1 uM of forskolin in 96-well plates.   The assay buffer is comprised of Earle's Balanced Sah Solution supplemented with 5 mM MgCl2,1 mM glutamine, 10 mM HEPES, and 1<br>
mg/mL bovine serum albumin. The mixture is incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, and terminated by adding 30uL/well of 0.5M HCl. The total intracellular cAMP level is quantitated using the New England Nuclear Flashplate and cAMP radioimmunoassay kit.<br>
To determine the antagonist activity of test compound, the reaction mixture also contains 0.5 nM of the agonist CP55940, and the reversal of the CP55940 effect is quantitated. Alternatively, a series of dose response curves for CP55940 is performed with increasing concentration of the test compound in each of the dose response curves.<br>
The functional assay for the CB2 receptor is done similarly with recombinant human CB2 receptor expressed in CHO cells.<br>
