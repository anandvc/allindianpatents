FUNGICIDES<br>
This invention relates to novel derivatives of naphthyridines. to processes for preparing them, to certain intermediate chemicals used in their manufacture, to compositions containing them and to methods of using them to combat fungi, especially fungal infections of plants.<br>
Derivatives of the nitrogen-containing 5,6 ring system S-l,2,4-triazolo[l,5-a]pyri-Ynidine are known from the patent literature as being useful for controlling phytopathogenic fungi. Examples of recent patent publications include EP-A-1249452, WO 02/051845, WO 02/083676, WO 02/083677, WO 02/088125, WO 02/088126, WO 02/088127. The plant fungicidal activity of certain derivatives of naphthyridines is described in EP-A-0410762 and US 4801592. Other naphthyridine derivatives are described, for example, in WO 92/07468 and US 525S356 as herbicides and in WO 93/13097 and WO 92/22533 for pharmaceutical applications.

In another aspect the present invention provides a fungicidal composition comprising a fungicidally effective amount of a compound of foR""ula (1) and a suitable carrier or diluent therefor.<br>
In a still further aspect the invention provides a method of combating and controlling fungi at a loC1-6s, which comprises treating the fungi, or the loC1-6s of the fangi with a fungicidally effective amount of a composition comprising a compound of foR""ula (1).<br>
The compositions can be chosen from a number of foR""ulation types, including dustable powders (DP), soluble powders (SP), water soluble granules (SG), water dispersible granules (WG), wettable powders (WP), granules (GR) (slow or fast release), soluble concentrates (SL), oil miscible liquids (OL), ultra low volume liquids (UL), emulsifiable concentrates (EC), dispersible concentrates (DC), emulsions (both oil in water (EW) and water in oil (EO)), micro-emulsions (ME), suspension concentrates (SC), aerosols, fogging/smoke foR""ulations, capsule suspensions (CS) and seed treatment foR""ulations. The foR""ulation type chosen in any instance will depend upon the partiC1-6lar purpose envisaged and the physical, chemical and biological properties of the compound of foR""ula (1).<br>
Dustable powders (DP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of foR""ula (1) with one or more solid diluents (for example natural clays, kaolin, pyrophyllite, bentonite, alumina, montmorillonite, kieselguhr, chalk, diatomaceous earths, calcium phosphates, calcium and magnesium carbonates, sulphur, lime, flours, talc and other organic and inorganic solid carriers) and mechanically grinding the mixture to a fine powder.<br>

and, optionally, one or more wetting agents, one or more dispersing agents or a mixture of said agents to improve water dispersibiiity/solubility. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to foR"" water soluble granules (SG).<br>
 Wettable powders (WP) may be prepared by mixing a compound of foR""ula (1) with one or more solid diluents or earners, one or more wetting agents and, preferably, one or more dispersing agents and, optionally, one or more suspending agents to facilitate the dispersion in liquids. The mixture is then ground to a fine powder. Similar compositions may also be granulated to foR"" water dispersible granules (WG).<br>
Granules (GR) may be foR""ed either by granulating a mixture of a compound of foR""ula (1) and one or more powdered solid diluents or carriers, or from pre-foR""ed blank granules by absorbing a compound of foR""ula (1) (or a solution thereof, in a suitable agent) in "a porous granular material (such as pumice, attapulgite clays, fuller's earth, kieselguhr, diatomaceous earths or ground corn cobs) or by adsorbing a compound of foR""ula (1) (or a solution thereof, in a suitable agent) on to a hard core material (such as sands, silicates, mineral carbonates, sulphates or phosphates) and drying if necessary. Agents which are commonly used to aid absorption or adsorption include solvents (such as aliphatic and aromatic petroleum solvents, alcohols, ethers, ketonesand esters) and sticking agents (such as polyvinyl acetates, polyvinyl alcohols, dextrins, sugars and vegetable oils). One or more other additives may also be included in granules (for example an emulsifying agent, wetting agent or dispersing agent).<br>
Dispersible Concentrates (DC) may be prepared by dissolving a compound of foR""ula (1) in water or an organic solvent, such as a ketone, alcohol or glycol ether. These solutions may contain a surface active agent (for example to improve water dilution or prevent crystallisation in a spray tank).<br>
Emulsifiable concentrates (EC) or oil-in-water emulsions (EW) may be prepared by dissolving a compound of foR""ula (1) in an organic solvent (optionally containing one or more wetting agents, one or more emulsifying agents or a mixture of said agents).

product may spontaneously emulsify on addition to water, to produce an emulsion with sufficient stability to allow spray application through appropriate equipment. Preparation of an EW involves obtaining a compound of foR""ula (1) either as a liquid (if it is not a liquid at room temperature, it may be melted at a reasonable temperature, typically below 70°C) or in solution (by dissolving it in an appropriate solvent) and then emulsifying the resultant liquid or solution into water containing one or more SFAs, under high shear, to produce an emulsion. Suitable solvents for use in EWs include vegetable oils, chlorinated hydrocarbons (such as chlorobenzenes), aromatic solvents (such as alkylbenzenes or alkylnaphthalenes) and other appropriate organic solvents that have a low solubility in water.<br>

A compound of foR""ula (1) is present initially in either the water or the solvent/SFA blend. Suitable solvents for use in MEs include those hereinbefore described for use in in ECs or in EWs. An ME may be either an oil-in-water or a watej-in-oil system (which system is present may be deteR""ined by conductivity measurements) and may be suitable for mixing water-soluble and oil-soluble pesticides in the same foR""ulation. An ME is suitable for dilution into water, either remaining as a microemulsion or foR""ing a conventional oil-in-water emulsion.<br>
Suspension concentrates (SC) may comprise aqueous or non-aqueous suspensions of finely divided insoluble solid particles of a compound of foR""ula (1).

. compound of foR""ula (1) may be mixed in the dry state with a pyrotechnic mixture to fo       composition suitable for generating, in an enclosed space, a smoke containing the<br><br>
Capsule suspensions (CS) may be prepared in a manner similar to the preparation of EW foR""ulations but with an additional polymerisation stage such that an aqueous dispersion of oil droplets is obtained, in which each oil droplet is encapsulated by a polymeric shell and contains a compound of foR""ula ;!) and, optionally, a carrier or diluent therefor. The polymeric shell may be produced by either an interfacial polycondensation reaction or by a coacervation procedure. The compositions may provide for controlled release of the compound of foR""ula (1) and they may be used for seed treatment. A compound of foR""ula (1) may also be foR""ulated in a biodegradable polymeric matrix to provide a slow, controlled release of the compound.<br>
A composition may include one or more additives to improve the biological perfoR""ance of the composition (for example by improving wetting, retention or distribution on surfaces; resistance to rain on treated surfaces; or uptake or mobility of a compound of foR""ula (1)). Such additives include surface active agents, spray additives based on oils, for example certain mineral oils or natural plant oils (such as soy bean and rape seed oil), and blends of these with other bio-enhancing adjuvants (ingredients which may aid or modify the    ^ action of a compound of foR""ula (1)).<br>
  A compound of foR""ula (1) may also be foR""ulated for use as a seed treatment, for<br>
example as a powder composition, including a powder for dry seed treatment (DS), a water soluble powder (SS) or a water dispersible powder for slurry treatment (WS), or as a liquid composition, including a flowable concentrate (FS), a solution (LS) or a capsule suspension (CS). The preparations of DS,SS, WS, FS and LS compositions are very similar to those of, respectively, DP, SP, WP, SC and DC compositions described above. Compositions for treating seed may include an agent for assisting the adhesion of the composition to the seed (for example a mineral oil or a film-foR""ing barrier).<br>
Wetting agents, dispersing agents and emulsifying agents may be SFAs of the cationic, anionic, amphoteric or non-ionic type.<br>
Suitable SFAs of the cationic type include quaternary ammonium compounds (for example cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide), imidazolines and amine salts.    Suitable anionic SFAs include alkali metals salts of fatty acids, salts of aliphatic monoesters of sulphuric acid (for example sodium lauryl sulphate), salts of sulphonated aromatic compounds <br><br>
sodium laureth-3-sulphate), ether carboxylates (for example sodium lauretho-carboxylate), phosphate esters (products from the reaction between one or more fatty alcohols and phosphoric acid (predominately mono-esters) or phosphorus pentoxide (predominately di-esters), for example the reaction between lauryl alcohol and tetraphosphoric acid; additionally these products may be ethoxylated), sulphosuccinamates, paraffin or define sulphonates, taurates and lignosulphonates.<br>
Suitable SFAs of the amphoteric type include betaines, propionates and glycinates.<br>

A compound of foR""ula (1) may be applied by any of the known means of applying fungicidal compounds. For example, it may be applied, foR""ulated or unfoR""ulated, to any part of the plant, including the foliage, stems, branches or roots, to the seed before it is planted or to other media in which plants are growing or are to be planted (such as soil surrounding the roots, the soil generally, paddy water or hydroponic C1-6lture systems), directly or it may be sprayed on, dusted on, applied by dipping, applied as a cream or paste foR""ulation, applied as a vapour or applied through distribution or incorporation of a composition (such as a granular composition or a composition packed in a water-soluble bag) in soil or an aqueous environment,<br>
A compound of foR""ula (1) may also be injected into plants or sprayed onto vegetation using electrodynamic spraying techniques or other low volume methods, or applied by land or aerial irrigation systems.<br>
Compositions for use as aqueous preparations (aqueous solutions or dispersions) are generally supplied in the foR"" of a concentrate containing a high proportion<br><br>
withstand storage for prolonged periods and, after such storage, to be capable of addition to water to foR"" aqueous preparations which remain homogeneous for a sufficient time to enable them to be applied by conventional spray equipment. Such aqueous preparations may contain varying amounts of a compound of foR""ula (1) (for example 0.0001 to 10%, by weight) depending upon the purpose for which they are to be used.<br>
A compound of foR""ula (1) may be used in mixtures with fertilisers (for example nitrogen-, potassium- or phosphorus-containing fertilisers). Suitable foR""ulation types include granules of fertiliser. The mixtures suitably contain up to 25% by weight-of the compound of foR""ula (1).<br>
The invention therefore also provides a fertiliser composition comprising a fertiliser and a compound of foR""ula (1).<br>
The compositions of this invention may contain other compounds having biological activity, for example micronutrients or compounds having'similar or complementary fungicidal activity or which possess plant growth regulating, herbicidal, insecticidal, .. nematicidal or acaricidal activity.<br>
By including another fungicide, the resulting composition may have a broader spectrum of activity or a greater level of intrinsic activity than the compound of foR""ula (1) alone. Further the other fungicide may have a synergistic effect on the fungicidal activity of the compound of foR""ula (1).<br>
The compound of foR""ula (1) may be the sole active ingredient of the composition o it maybe admixed with one or more additional active ingredients such as a pesticide, fungicide, synergist, herbicide or plant growth regulator where appropriate. An additional active ingredient may: provide a composition having a broader spectrum of activity or increased persistence at a loC1-6s; synergise the activity or complement the activity (for example by increasing the speed of effect or overcoming repellency) of the compound of foR""ula (1); or help to overcome or prevent the development of resistance to individual components. The partiC1-6lar additional active ingredient will depend upon the intended utility of the composition.<br>
Examples of fungicidal compounds which may be included in the composition of the invention are AC 382042 <br><br><br><br>
trifloxystrobim triflumizole, trifonne, triticonazole. validamycin A, vapam, vinclozolin, XRJD-563, zineb, ziram, zoxamide and compounds of the foR""ulae:<br><br>
The compounds of foR""ula (1) may be mixed with soil, peat or other rooting media for the protection of plants against seed-borne, soil-borne or foliar fungal diseases.<br>
Some mixtures may comprise active ingredients, which have significantly different physical, chemical or biological properties such that they do not easily lend themselves to the same conventional foR""ulation type. In these cirC1-6mstances other foR""ulation types may be prepared. For example, where one active ingredient is a water insoluble solid and the other a" water insoluble liquid, it may nevertheless be possible to disperse each active ingredient in the same continuous aqueous phase by dispersing the solid active ingredient as a suspension (using a preparation analogous to that of an SC) but dispersing the liquid active ingredient as an emulsion (using a preparation analogous to that of an EW). The resultant composition is a suspoemulsion (SE) foR""ulation.<br><br><br><br>
