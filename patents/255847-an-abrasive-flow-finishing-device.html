				<td>MAGNETORHEOLOGICAL ABSRASIVE FLOW FINISHING PROCESS AND<br>
DEVICE THEREFOR<br>
The present invention provides a magnetorheological abrasive flow finishing process<br>
for the finishing of metals and non-metals with close tolerances as well as a device therefore.<br>
Precise control of finishing forces is an important consideration for fine finishing of<br>
metals and non-metals with close tolerances and without damaging surface topography. The<br>
major bottleneck hi existing finishing technologies lies hi their incapability of controlling<br>
abrading forces, hence final surface finish. The nature and strength of bonding material used<br>
to hold the abrasive particles together determines the extent of abrasion and quality of the<br>
finished surface. Advance fine finishing processes hi which efforts were made to precisely<br>
control and abrading forces are Magnetic Abrasive Finishing (MAP), Magnetic Float<br>
Polishing, (MFP), Magnetorheological Finishing (MRF) and Abrasive Flow Machining<br>
(AFM). In MAP, MRF and MFP, the magnetic field is used to control the abrading forces,<br>
but the applications of these processes are limited to specific simple geometries only due to<br>
restriction on relative movement of finishing medium and workpiece. These are incapable of<br>
finishing any geometry by allowing abrasive laden polymetric medium to flow over it. In<br>
AFM, the medium acts as complaint lap and overcomes shape limitation inherent in almost<br>
all traditional finishing processes. As abrading forces hi AFM process mainly depend on<br>
rheological behaviour of polymeric medium, which is least controllable by external means,<br>
hence lacks determinism. MRF process was developed for polishing optical flats, spheres<br>
and aspheres up to nanometer level using slurry comprised of aqueous MR-fluid and cerium<br>
oxide abrasives.<br>
The present invention provides a new precision finishing process based on both<br>
magnetic and rheological abrasive flow finishing. The process of the invention has been<br>
termed Magneto-Rheological Abrasive Flow Finishing (MRAFF), for superfinishing of<br>
complex internal and external metallic as well as non-metallic surfaces in nanometer range<br>
using specially prepared Magneto-Rheological Polishing (MRP) fluid. The MRP-fluid used<br>
is comprised of carbonyl iron powder particles and silicon carbide abrasives dispersed in the<br>
viscoplastic base of grease and heavy paraffin liquid. This smart fluid exhibits change in its<br>
rheological properties, hence bonding forces on abrasive particles, on the application of<br>
external magnetic field. The smart controllable behaviour of MRP-fluid provides better inprocess<br>
control of finishing forces on abrasive particles and final surface finish by controlling<br>
the magnetizing current in the electromagnets used. A hydraulically powdered MRAFF<br>
machine consists of two MRP-fluid cylinders, two hydraulic actuators, electromagnet, fixture<br>
and supporting frame is designed, developed and fabricated by the inventors. Experiments<br>
were successfully conducted on stainless steel workpieces to study the process performance<br>
and results are quite encouraging. Due to the unique characteristic of the process to extrude<br>
the MRP-fluid through the passage formed by workpiece and fixture, there is no limitation on<br>
geometry to finish. Apart from it, there is selective abrasion on surfaces where magnetic field<br>
is present preventing wear and tear of machine components.<br>
Abrasive Flow Machining (AFM) and Magnetorheological Finishing (MRF)<br>
processes are two existing process whose limitation are overcome hi the process of the<br>
invention.<br>
AFM was developed by Extrude Hone Corporation, USA in 1960 to deburr, polish,<br>
radius difficult to reach surface and edges of critical aircraft hydraulic and fuel system<br>
components. It works on principle of extruding abrasive laden viscoelastic polymeric medium<br>
through passage formed by workpiece surface and specially designed fixture. Researchers<br>
worked on AFM process have unanimously agreed on considering viscosity as one of the<br>
main process parameter and have found that the viscosity of abrasive laden medium<br>
temporarily rises hi restricted passages and significantly affect the finishing performance of<br>
the process. Depending on the flow pattern, for uniformly abrading the walls of large<br>
passages, more viscous medium is required as compared to radiusing edges and finishing<br>
small passages.<br>
It is also emphasized that rheological properties of the abrasive laden medium has<br>
significant role to play during finishing operation. But it is irony that the most significant<br>
parameter of AFM is least controllable. The viscosity of abrasive medium in AFM process<br>
depends upon the shape of passage involved; hence abrasion can not be controlled by any<br>
external means. It varies according to the workpiece shape. Another difficulty associated<br>
with abrasive laden polymeric medium is hi uniformly mixing of abrasives in it due to high<br>
viscosity of base viscoelastic polymer. The inventors were familiar with all these limitations<br>
as part of their research work on AFM process hi the past.<br>
Another process bear close resemblance with the present invention is<br>
Magnetorheological Finishing (MRF). MRF process was developed and brought to<br>
production stage by Center for Optics Manufacturing (COM) Rochester, USA for finishing<br>
high precision lenses, ceramics and semiconductor wafers. They used aqueous<br>
magnetorheological fluid with cerium oxide abrasives as a complaint replacement for the<br>
conventional rigid polishing lap.<br>
In the region where the workpiece surface and the magnetorheological polishing<br>
(MRP) fluid are brought hi contact, because of the applied magnetic field, a shear flow of<br>
Bingham plastic MRP fluid occurs through the gap resulting in material removal. Due to<br>
high magnetic flux density hi polishing zone, a polishing spot formed on the workpiece<br>
moves relative to its surface correcting surface errors by removing asperities. The dwelling<br>
time of workpiece hi moving MRP fluid ribbon determines the polishing characteristics.<br>
The application of MRF process is limited to finishing flat, spherical and aspherical<br>
external surfaces only because of its mechanism of action by dwelling workpiece in moving<br>
MRP fluid ribbon. It is incapable of finishing internal passages or complex geometries due to<br>
biggest limitation on relative movement of abrasives hi MR-fluid to workpiece surface. Also<br>
the standard MR polishing fluid compositions are effective for finishing optical glasses, glass<br>
ceramics, plastics and some non-magnetic metals. They have very little effect on hard<br>
materials.<br>
The MRAFF process of the invention overcomes the disadvantages of the prior art<br>
process and relies on extrusion of specially prepared magnetorheological polishing (MRP)<br>
fluid through passage formed by workpiece surface and fixture hi the presence of externally<br>
controlled magnetic field.<br>
Magnetorheological polishing fluid was prepared indigenously by dispersing carbonyl<br>
iron particles (CIPs) of size~ 18 jam and black silicon carbide abrasives of grit size 800 in<br>
viscoplastic base medium of heavy paraffin liquid and APS grease. Experiments were<br>
conducted on stainless steel workpieces to study the effect of magnetic field strength on<br>
change in surface roughness (Ra) and the results (Fig. 6) were quite encouraging and as per<br>
expectations. The improvement hi surface finish is higher at high magnetic field strength due<br>
to the increased bonding strength of carbonyl iron particle chains around abrasive particles<br>
trapped in between them.<br>
Magnetorheological Abrasive Flow Finishing (MRAFF) process was developed for<br>
super finishing of internal geometries of hard materials. This process relies for their<br>
performance on magnetorheological effect exhibited by carbonyl iron particles along with<br>
abrasive particles hi non-magnetic viscoplastic base medium. The extent of finishing action<br>
depends on radial and tangential forces coming on abrasive particles due to carbonyl iron<br>
particles (CIPs) arranged hi columnar structure in the presence of external magnetic field.<br>
The effects of abrasives and CIPs size on surface finish improvement were investigated.<br>
Experiments were conducted on stainless steel work pieces with different combinations of<br>
CIP and SiC particles in MRP-fluid for same volume concentration. The CIP chain structures<br>
were also observed microscopically to understand the chain formation and alignment around<br>
abrasive particles on the application of external magnetic field. Magnitudes of the forces on<br>
abrasive particles were then calculated and change in surface roughness model was developed<br>
to simulate final surface roughness. The improvement in surface finish hi case of MRP-fluid<br>
with CIP of average diameter 18 um for all combination of SiC particle size is more than CIP<br>
of diameter 3.5 um. The reduction hi surface roughness value for same CIP size decreases<br>
with decrease hi SiC particle size. The possible structure for all combination of CIP and SiC<br>
particle sizes are determined and surface roughness profile is generated after calculating<br>
forces coming on single SiC particle. The results are hi close agreement with the<br>
experimental values. For the same volume concentration of SiC and CIPs hi MRP-fluid, their<br>
relative size plays an important role in finishing action during MRAFF process. The bonding<br>
strength of CEP around SiC particles to a large extent is governed by the arrangement of CIPs<br>
hi the vicinity of SiC particles hi fluid.<br>

The ultra precision finishing technologies have grown rapidly over recent years, and<br>
have tremendous impact on the development of new products and materials. With the advent<br>
of these new materials, manufacturing engineers are facing challenge of machining and<br>
finishing these materials to meet their functional requirements. The available traditional and<br>
advanced finishing processes alone are incapable of producing desired surface characteristics<br>
on internal geometries, and in exercising in-process control on finishing action. Abrasive<br>
Flow Machining (AFM) process was developed to finish internal complex geometries by<br>
allowing abrasive laden polymeric medium to flow over it under pressure. The abrading<br>
forces in AFM process are function of viscosity of viscoelastic polymeric base medium,<br>
which is very difficult to control during operation. This lacks determinism in the control of<br>
finishing action. In another process developed for automated lens finishing,<br>
Magnetorheological finishing (MRF), external magnetic field is used to control the<br>
Theological properties of polishing medium, hence add determinism in controlling generated<br>
surface topography during finishing. The present applications of MRF process are limited to<br>
flat, spherical and aspherical surfaces due to dwelling of workpiece hi the moving MRP-fluid<br>
ribbon. To meet the finishing requirements of internal geometries and incorporating better inprocess<br>
control of finishing forces, a hybrid process from AFM and MRF,<br>
Magnetorheological Abrasive Flow Finishing (MRAFF) was developed hi the present<br>
invention. The hydraulically powered device of the invention is depicted in Figure 1.<br>
Since the process of the invention is novel, earlier experimental data is not available<br>
on its performance. Experiments were conducted to study the effect of magnetic field strength<br>
(B) on the surface finish and to have an insight into the finishing mechanism. Flat stainless<br>
steel workpieces of size 35x5x2 mm with supporting fixture were prepared. Initial center line<br>
average (CLA) surface roughness R« of approx. 0.5 - 0.6 um was obtained by grinding<br>
workpieces. Magnetorheological polishing fluid with 20 vol. % carbonyl iron powder (Grade<br>
CS from BASF, avg. particle size 18 um), 20 vol. % silicon carbide abrasive powder of 400<br>
mesh size and 60 vol. % of viscoplastic base medium ( 20 wt. % APS grease and 80 wt. %<br>
paraffin liquid heavy) was prepared. The suspension was prepared by mixing abrasive and<br>
iron particles into continuous phase (grease + oil) and stirring with the help of specially<br>
designed multiple blade mixer. This results hi uniform dispersion of iron and abrasive<br>
particles hi the base medium. Magnetic field of around 0.574 Tesla (at 6A current) across the<br>
workpiece was produced with the help of C- shaped electromagnet, made of cold rolled<br>
annealed steel. Experiments were conducted at different magnetic field strengths. The surface<br>
scanning electron micrographs are shown in Fig. 2.<br>
After preliminary study, the finishing performance of MRAFF process is found to be<br>
mainly dependent on MRP-fluid composition for the same magnetic field strength, extrusion<br>
pressure and number of finishing cycles. MRP-fluid composition is one of the key parameters<br>
affecting final surface roughness in MRAFF process due to its role in fluid structure<br>
formation; hence it is taken up as a main factor for this study. In this study the effect of<br>
silicon carbide (SiC) abrasives and carbonyl iron particles (CIPs) size on decrease hi surface<br>
roughness value was investigated on stainless steel work pieces. A microscopic study of CIP<br>
chain structure formation was conducted. Based on this observation and suitable assumptions<br>
related to structure formation; final surface roughness was simulated and compared with the<br>
experimental results as discussed in the following sections.<br>
Finishing forces in MRAFF process are controlled by Theological properties of MRPfluid<br>
which comprises of carbonyl iron particles and very fine abrasives dispersed in<br>
viscoplastic base medium of mineral oil and grease. This composition exhibits unique<br>
reversible change in it* Theological properties on application and removal of external<br>
magnetic field. The magnetic field dependent yield stress and viscosity of MRP-fluid can be<br>
controlled by controlling magnetizing current in the electromagnet coils producing magnetic<br>
field across the finishing zone. The carbonyl iron particles acquire magnetic dipole moment<br>
proportional to magnetic field strength, and aggregate into chain like structure aligned in the<br>
field direction, embedding non-magnetic abrasive particles in between. Depending on the size<br>
and volume concentration of abrasives and carbonyl iron particles (CIPs), the bonding<br>
strength gained by abrasives through surrounding CIPs chains varies. To finish internal<br>
workpiece surfaces in MRAFF process, the MRP-fluid was extruded through the workpiece<br>
passage in the presence of magnetic field. Abrasion occurs selectively only where the change<br>
in rheological properties of MRP-fluid takes place from near Newtonian to Bingham plastic<br>
due to CIPs chain formation. Due to CIPs chain formation, non-magnetic abrasive particles<br>
get embedded between the chains, and gain bonding strength in proportion to magnetic field<br>
strength to perform finishing action. In this way the extent of abrasion of peaks by abrasives<br>
is controlled by magnetic field strength and the desired finishing characteristics are controlled<br>
by changing magnetizing current in the electromagnet.<br>
Finishing experiments were conducted on specially designed and developed<br>
hydraulically powered MRAFF setup. All experiments were conducted for 200 finishing<br>
cycles at 3.75 MPa hydraulic extrusion pressure and 0.531 Tesla magnetic flux density. The<br>
MRP-fluid was prepared with 20 vol. % carbonyl iron powder and 20 vol. % silicon carbide<br>
abrasives in 60 vol. % base medium of paraffin liquid and AP3 grease. The polishing fluid<br>
was prepared by mixing abrasive and iron particles into nearly continuous phase (grease +<br>
oil) and stirring with the help of specially designed multi-blade mixer. This results in uniform<br>
dispersion of iron and abrasive particles in the base medium. Magnetic field across the<br>
workpiece was produced with the help of C- shaped electromagnet, made of cold rolled<br>
annealed steel. Experiments were conducted on stainless steel ground workpieces (flat<br>
surfaces) with initial Ra value of ~0.30^m. Experiments were conducted using two different<br>
grades of carbonyl iron powders from BASF, CS and HS along with black silicon carbide of<br>
mesh size 800, 1200, and 2000. Before and after every experiment, the surface roughness<br>
profiles were recorded by Mahr Federal Surfanalyzer 5000.<br>
The surface roughness measurement results are summarized in Table 1. The highest<br>
improvement from 0.32 |j.m to 0.09 nm is observed in case of MRP-fluid containing CIP-CS<br>
and SiU-SUO and the least improvement is found in CIP-HS and SiC-2000 combination for<br>
There was not much improvement in surface roughness for Expt. Nos. 4-6 (Table-1)<br>
corresponding to CIPs of 3.5 urn diameter much smaller than SiC diameter, though small<br>
change in R» value was noticed. The changes in Ra value in these cases are very less. The<br>
obvious reason for this observation is that the chains formed from small carbonyl iron<br>
particles of HS grade (3.5um) are not strong enough to hold the bigger abrasive particles, and<br>
are unable to provide required finishing forces. This reasoning is supported in the following<br>
sections by theoretical analysis of chain structure formation and surface roughness profile<br>
simulation.<br>
The study of chain structure formation on application of magnetic field helped to<br>
understand the role of particle size on surface finish improvement. The structures of six<br>
different MRP-fluid compositions were investigated.<br>
To study the magnetic forces coming on abrasive particles during finishing operation,<br>
structural arrangement of carbonyl iron particles around abrasive particles are calculated<br>
theoretically considering their occupancy in a unit cube. It is known that the carbonyl iron<br>
particles acquire magnetic dipole moment in the presence of external magnetic field. When<br>
the dipolar interaction forces between particles exceed their thermal interactions, the particles<br>
aggregate into chains of dipoles aligned in the field direction. These chains form columnar<br>
structure at higher concentration of carbonyl iron particles. For simplifying theoretical<br>
simulation of chain structure, it is assumed that iron particles rearrange around SiC particles<br>
in the direction of magnetic field and repeat itself in complete volume spanning from one end<br>
to the other of the fixture between electromagnet poles. Due to the presence of non-magnetic<br>
abrasive particles in the MRP-fluid, the chains are rarely continuous; instead terminate at the<br>
abrasive particles if come in between chain path.<br>
Iron particles are assumed to be uniform in size and homogenously distributed spheres<br>
that can be magnetically modeled as identical induced dipole moments. The chain is formed<br>
by the alignment of spherical CIPs in the magnetic field, touching end to end diametrically.<br>
For non-magnetic silicon carbide abrasive particles, it is assumed that there is little movement<br>
of the particles hi MRP-fluid on the application of external magnetic field. They get trapped<br>
between the iron chains wherever they were before the application of magnetic field with<br>
slight adjustment. So, the numbers of silicon carbide particles hi unit area are calculated by<br>
considering their uniform distribution inside the MRP-fluid. On the basis of our assumptions,<br>
forces on abrasive particles used for finishing during MRAFF process are calculated<br>
considering similar arrangements of CIPs around SiC particles. Calculations were done to<br>
estimate number of particles per unit cell (volume depends on particle sizes) for particle sizes<br>
specified hi Table 1 and the results are summarized hi Table 2. A unit cell occupies the MRPfluid<br>
volume available around integer number of SiC particles. Depending on the volume<br>
concentration, the volume available around one SiC particle is calculated. Based on particle<br>
sizes, the number of CIP per SiC is calculated and then these numbers of iron particles are<br>
arranged around SiC based on the possible equilibrium positions and space available.<br>
required to calculate the forces on abrasive particles during finishing action. In MRAFF<br>
process, the spherical abrasive particle penetrates into the workpiece surface under the action<br>
of the normal magnetic force on carbonyl iron particles in the presence of external magnetic<br>
field. The abrasive grain produces a groove on the workpiece surface whose section<br>
corresponds to the profile of the penetrated portion of the grain. Under hydraulic pressure,<br>
when the penetrated abrasive grain is translated horizontally, the shearing of workpiece<br>
material hi front of abrasive grain takes place when shear force by the fluid (Fshear) on the<br>
projected area of the penetrating abrasive (above the portion embedded into the surface) is<br>
greater than the reaction force (Rshear) on the embedded projected area of the abrasive due to<br>
the strength of the workpiece material as shown in Fig. 3.<br>
Condition for shearing, Fshear &gt; Rshear<br>
Where, A = total projected area of abrasive grain, A'— projected area of embedded<br>
portion of abrasive in workpiece surface, ay = yield stress of stainless steel workpiece in<br>
shear, and ry = fluid shear stress. On comparison after calculations using Eqs. (1) and (2), the<br>
Fshear is found to be greater than Rshear to perform finishing action.<br>
For finishing experiments two multilayered copper coils each with 2000 turns of 17<br>
SWG were used to produce magnetic field in the gap of 30 mm (Fig. 4). To calculate normal<br>
force on any ferromagnetic particle (act as magnetic dipole) in the external magnetic field,<br>
variation of magnetic flux density (B) is calculated between the pole pieces. Using formula<br>
for magnetic flux density due to a finite solenoid, the value of B at any point, at a distance<br>
' x' from coil 1 (Fig. 4), is the vector sum of BI, flux density due to coil 1 and 82, flux<br>
density due to coil 2.<br>
Where, TJ, r2 and/, are core radius, outer radius and length of electromagnet coil,<br>
respectively, x is the distance from pole face, //0 is magnetic permeability of free space, /<br>
is magnetizing current, and n is number of turns per unit length. The variation of flux<br>
density in the air gap due to electromagnet used was also experimentally measured using a<br>
Gauss meter, with cold rolled annealed iron core. The measurements were done from coil 1 to<br>
coil 2 in forward direction and then from coil 2 to coil 1, backward. Both readings were<br>
almost overlapping so average is taken and value of B is plotted along with theoretical<br>
variation hi Fig. 5. The relative permeability of iron core was found out by measuring B in<br>
presence and absence of iron core and was 7.26. Theoretical and experimental variation of B<br>
with distance x is plotted hi Fig. 5 for the values of x = 0 to x = 24 mm as per the coordinate<br>
axis shown hi Fig. 4. The theoretical variation of B hi the gap is quadratic, therefore after<br>
fitting the quadratic equation (dashed curve hi Fig. 4) to the experimentally obtained variation<br>
Force on a small ferromagnetic particle of mass m is given by,<br>
where, //0 is magnetic permeability of free space, zm is magnetic susceptibility of carbonyl<br>
iron particles (CIPs), m is mass of CIP, and H is Magnetic field strength. For practical<br>
purposes, it is advantageous to replace field strength with magnetic induction using<br>
relation B = n0H , so that Eq. (7) becomes<br>
......... (8)<br>
Owing to the bigger size of flat pole piece hi comparison to the diameter of workpiece<br>
fixture, the variation of B hi y direction is negligible, hence after neglecting it the <br>
To calculate the force on abrasive particles due to magnetic force on carbonyl iron<br>
particles near workpiece surface, their structural arrangement and alignment are drawn as per<br>
possible equilibrium structure hi unit cell and are shown schematically hi Fig. 6. The Eq. (9)<br>
for calculating force involves the mass susceptibility^ of carbonyl iron particle. To calculate<br>
the mass susceptibility Xm of CS and HS grades, the M-H curves are plotted using "Parallel<br>
field vibrating sample magnetometer (VSM) model 150A". The forces for each experiment<br>
are calculated in the following paragraphs.<br>
From Table 2 it is found that there are -1.18 carbonyl iron particles per abrasive<br>
particle in unit cell volume which are in contact with the workpiece surface for experiment 1.<br>
Considering configuration of Fig.6 (a), the force on abrasive particle is calculated as follows:<br>
The possible arrangement of one CIP around one SiC in a cube of 25.46 urn edge is<br>
their arrangement along diagonal. Magnetic force Fm on CS grade carbonyl iron particle of<br>
diameter 18um at a distance 20.18 urn from work piece surface and at x = 3.02018 mm (3<br>
mm fixture and workpiece thickness + perpendicular distance of CIP from work piece<br>
surface) is calculated fromEq. (6) as,<br>
£ = 0.557618 Tesla<br>
Differentiating Eq. (6) with respect to x and substituting value of x (0.003028) we get,<br>
— = -3.85028<br>
dx<br>
The value of^mat B = 0.557618 Tesla obtained from M-H curve is %„ =3.985x10"4<br>
m3/kg. Substituting these values in Eq. (9), we get Fm ~ 16.216x10'9 N. Following the above<br>
procedure, forces for five other experiments whose configurations are shown in Figs. 6b - 6f<br>
have been computed and the same are given in Table 3.<br>
(Table Removed)  Where, Dp and L, are MRPF-cylinder piston diameter and stroke length respectively. Df is<br>
the fixture's inside diameter. The number of abrasive particles in an extrusion length of<br>
459.201 mm is calculated from/,,/**, where 'a' is the edge of cube around each abrasive<br>
particle or linear spacing between center of two adjacent abrasive particles (Fig. 7). Numbers<br>
of abrasive particles passing over a roughness peak per stroke are calculated as number of<br>
abrasive particles in an extrusion length, Le/a.<br>
Initial surface roughness data input to the model was taken from the Surfanalyser<br>
5000 instrument in the form of ordinates of all sampled points in the profile at equal interval.<br>
To update the surface profile after each stroke, depth of indentation by spherical abrasive on<br>
each peak is calculated from Eq. (1 1) (this equation can be derived from the AOAB in Fig. 3)<br>
and subtracted from the peak height as shown in Fig. 8.<br>
The indentation diameter Dt in Eq. (11) is calculated from Brinell hardness number<br>
given below,<br>
Where, Dg is the abrasive grain diameter in m, Dt is the indentation diameter in m, i<br>
normal indenting force on abrasive in N, and HBHN is the work piece Brinell hardness. The<br>
new peak height Y{ after one stroke with Ng active grains/stroke is given by,<br>
 (14)<br>
If the point is not a peak point hi the data file (for example Ya and Ya in Fig. 8), then<br>
it is transferred to final profile as it is. To update the peak heights, new peak points were<br>
calculated after each stroke and updated profile data were passed for processing <br>
stroke. Before and after all strokes, the center-line-average surface roughness value (Ra)<br>
from profile data points was calculated using Eq. (15),<br>
Where, N is number of data points and Yt is roughness height at those points. To calculate<br>
final Ra value based on theoretical indentation values, software in 'C' programming<br>
language was written as per flow chart shown in Fig. 9. The theoretically obtained final Ra<br>
values after simulation are summarized in Table 4. The theoretically calculated Ra values are<br>
in close agreement with the experimental results with maximum error of 12% except for<br>
Expt. 1. For Expt. 2 and 5, the simulated and actual profile is shown hi Fig. 10 and 1 1 after<br>
200 cycles. Comparatively large indentations are obtained theoretically when the abrasive<br>
particles and CDPs are of approximately same size (Expt. 1) as compared to the case when<br>
CIPs are smaller hi size compared to abrasive particles in Expt. 4-6. This conclusion closely<br>
resembles with the experimental observations.<br>
Thus it can be concluded that the theoretical modeling clearly captures the fact that<br>
CLP and abrasive particle size ratio plays an important role hi final roughness value <br>
Following assumptions are identified as the main reasons for the variation between<br>
the experimental and theoretical Ra values:<br>
i) The carbonyl iron chains and SiC structure are assumed to repeat and span from one<br>
end to another of the fixture. This assumption is made to simplify the physical model,<br>
though in actual case the chain like structures formed between magnetic poles are<br>
more complex as can be seen in Fig. la. Iron chains many times terminate at the<br>
abrasive particles that come in their way and form clusters by aggregating into<br>
cylindrical columns.<br>
ii) All abrasive particles are assumed spherical of average diameter, calculated from thenmesh<br>
size. In practice, no two abrasive particles resemble each other in shape and<br>
size.<br>
iii) The abrasive particles are assumed uniformly distributed in MRP-fluid. It is observed<br>
microscopically also that this assumption is not very much true in case of carbonyl<br>
iron particles which are smaller as compared to abrasive particles. The number of<br>
abrasive particles on the workpiece surface reduces significantly when mixed with<br>
smaller CIPs.<br>
iv) Though change in surface roughness values hi experiment number 4-6 with very fine<br>
CIPs was observed, but the surface roughness profile was not reflecting substantial<br>
change.<br>
/) The normal magnetic force on iron particle in a stationary system (no shearing<br>
applied) on the application of magnetic field shows steady increase with time after an<br>
initial jump. This normal force decreases with strain and reaches plateau value at large<br>
strains. In calculating normal indentation force this decrease is not considered and the<br>
normal force is assumed constant, which results in comparatively higher indentation.<br>
The effect of CIP and abrasive particle size in MRP-fluid composition on change in<br>
surface roughness is investigated hi the study. Theoretical justifications are derived through<br>
efforts to understand the physics involved during finishing action in MRAFF process.<br>
Following are the main conclusions made after experimental study and theoretical modeling:<br>
1. The role of magnetic field strength in MRAFF process is clearly distinguished, as at<br>
zero field conditions no improvement hi surface finish is observed, and the<br>
improvement is significant at high magnetic field strength. This is because, in the<br>
absence of magnetic field the carbonyl iron particles and abrasive particles flow over<br>
the workpiece surface without any finishing action due to the absence of bonding<br>
strength of CIPs. As the magnetic field strength increased by increasing magnetizing<br>
current, carbonyl iron particles chains keep on holding abrasives more firmly and<br>
thereby result hi increased finishing action. Even magnetic flux density of 0.1521<br>
Tesla is capable of removing to some extent, loosely held ploughed material left after<br>
grinding process and expose the actual grinding marks made by abrasives.<br>
i) For the same magnetic flux density, the finishing forces on abrasive particles are<br>
mainly dependent on the number of CIPs in their vicinity, their microstructural<br>
arrangement and size. The magnetic force on a carbonyl iron particle is a function of<br>
particle volume, volume susceptibility, and its position in the field. Owing to this,<br>
size of CIP in comparison with abrasive size is an important factor affecting final<br>
surface roughness in MRAFF process. Smaller size CIPs are incapable to provide<br>
necessary finishing forces for bigger abrasive particles, hence result in weak<br>
bonding strength. Due to these weak bonding forces there was negligible or very less<br>
improvement in surface finish.<br>
ii) For the same CIP size the surface finish improvement decreases with decrease in<br>
abrasive particles size due to decrease in indenting forces and distribution of forces<br>
on more abrasive particles.<br>
