This invention relates to an apparatus for sensing thickness variation in fibre batt for sensing and controlling the lap or loose fibers in the fibre batt fed to a carding machine in order to achieve lesser sliver coeficient of variation.<br>
In a carding machine the output silver quality depends on the uniformity in weight per unit length of the feed material in the form of lap or loose fibers. Normally in any carding machine the feed material, whether in lap form or loose fibers, is bound to have variations in weight per unit length, both in length wise and width wise. Since there is a huge draft between feed and delivery, a small variation in feed is multiplied heavily on the delivery sliver. Hence controlling the feed weight per unit length is very important for the output sliver quality.<br>
At present the feed material is controlled by means of sensing and controlling the speed of feed roller. Here the sensors are fitted at both ends of the feed roller and the feed roller is allowed to move up and down, against a predetermined spring load. This movement depends on the variation in feed weight per unit length. The sensing and corrections are carried out in a single roller only. The width wise variations are not taken into consideration.<br>
Sliver coefficient of variation (CV%) is a statistical term which indicates the magnitude of variations in sliver weight per unit length. Number of samples taken are 20 and the cut length is 5m. Weight is measured in gms. Lesser sliver CV% reduce the yarn count variations. Consequently, stripmess is eliminated in woven and knitted fabrics.<br><br>
The feed roller, placed along the machine width, adjacent to the lick:er_ in, is driven by a motor through chains. The motor speed is varied by an inverter servo drive through an electromc control device which is getting signals from sensing means and averaging it to feed a uniform weight per unit length material to the licker_in. Bearing housings are fitted at both end shafts of the feed roller and the housings are supported in two end brackets. Needle bearings may be used for smooth, continuous rotation. The brackets are rigidly fixed over the feed plate. A coating may be given on the feed roller surface to avoid lap licking. The feed roller is loaded with springs at both ends.<br>
The invention provides an apparatus for sensing thickness variation of feed in a carding machine comprising a sensing roller supported on two end brackets rigidly fixed to a support frame and placed along the width of a carding machine, close to the feed roller of the carding machine, the said sensing roller being driven at the same speed of the feed roller, a sensing plate consisting of plurality of segments, each said sensing plate segments having a sensing stud and a spring holding stud hinged at one end on a hing bracket, a spring being provided on each of the spring holding stud to hold the fibre batt fed by the feed roller between the sensing roller and sensing plate and a sensing means attached to the sensing stud to provide electrical signal corresponding to the thickness variation in the fibre batt passing between the sensing plate and sensing roller.<br><br>
A preferred sensing means is an inductive proximity sensor which provides a signal in response to the movement of the sensing stud of the sensing plate segment. Another preferred sensing means is a load cell which provides a signal in response to the movement of the sensing stud of the sensing plate. Since the apparatus according to the invention senses the thickness variation of the fibre batt along the length of the feed roller by means of the movement of the plurality of segments of the sensing plate, a more accurate measure of the thickness variation of the feed batt will be obtained. The signal corresponding to the average measure of the thickness variation is used to controll the feed roller drive to obtain a fibre batt of uniform thickness.<br>
The feed plate is preferably a solid iron component having a curved profile at the top side. The feed plate top surface preferably has a special finish and coatings to avoid wear resistance and lap licking. Feed roller end brackets are mounted over the feed plate. The position of the feed roller is ensured by two locating pins and fasteners. Feed plate is placed across the width of the machine and mounted over the main frame. The gap between the feed plate and feed roller is maintained by spring. When the feed material is fed between the feed plate and feed roller, the roller gets loaded by means of the spring. The material fed to the lickerin from feed plate and feed roller is under the grip due to the spring loading.<br>
The apparatus according to the invention sense the feed thickness variation which corresponds to the weight variations in both length wise and width wise. It can provide accurate control of the feed to achieve a uniform weight per unit length of textile material feed to card licker  in.<br><br>
The apparatus according to the invention will be described below with reference to the accompanying drawings :<br>
Figure 1 shows the apparatus according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2A shows a preferred embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention.<br>
Figure 2B shows another preferred embodiment of the apparatus according to the invention.<br>
Figure 3 shows a magnified portion showing details of the sensing roller, sensing plate and sensing means according to the invention.<br>
A sensing roller (1) is rotatably mounted with two end brackets (6) with roller bearings (7) and the end brackets (6) are fixed to a support frame (8). The sensing roller (1) is located close to feed roller (3) and feed plate (4) of the carding machine. The feed roller (3) is located close to the licker_in (5) of the carding machine. The sensing roller (1) is driven against the multiple segments of the sensing plate (2) at the same speed as the speed of the feed roller (3). Each segments of the sensing plate (2) are hinged at one end on a hing bracket (9) mounted on a support frame (8). Each sensing plate segments is provided with a sensing stud (2a) and a spring holding stud (2b) hinged to one end on a hing bracket (9). A spring (10) is provided on each of the spring holding stud (2b) to hold the fibre batt fed by the feed roller (3) between the  sensing roller (1) and sensing plate<br><br>
(2). A sensing means (11, 12) is attached to the sensing stud (2a) to provide electrical signal corresponding to the thickness variation in the fibre batt passing between the sensing plate (2) and the sensing roller (1). A preferred sensing means is an inductive proximity sensor (11) which provides a signal in response to the thickness variation of the fibre batt Another prefered sensing means is a load cell (12) to provide a signal in response to the thickness variation of the fibre batt. The signal corresponding to the thickness variation in the fibre batt is used to control the drive of the feed roller in order to get uniform weight per unit length for the fibre batt fed to the licker_in (5).<br>
Preferably the surface of the sensing roller (1) is coated with a suitable coating to avoid lap licking. The sensing roller surface may have a knurled profile, a saw tooth clothing mounted on a plain roller or diamond pattern depending upon the textile materials processed.<br>
