PRIORITY CLAIM<br>
The present application claims priority to U.S. Patent Application Serial No. 60/494,862,<br>
which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Technical Field:<br>
The present invention relates in general to communication and, in particular, to methods,<br>
systems and program products for communication via a wireless communication<br>
network. Still more particularly, the present invention is related to methods, systems and<br>
program products for regulating data messaging by a mobile station in a wireless<br>
communication network.<br>
2.	Description of the Related Art:<br>
With the adoption of new digital technologies, over-the-air radio frequency (RF)<br>
communication provides an ever increasing number of voice and data services to users of<br>
mobile stations, such as digital pagers and mobile telephones. In order to permit<br>
interoperability of mobile stations between networks, standards organizations have<br>
promulgated a number of specifications to define required features and behaviors of<br>
access networks, core networks and network devices providing over-the-air RF<br>
communication. For example, the 3rd Generation Parmership Project 2 (3GPP2) defines a<br>
number of specifications for communicationsemploying the 3rd generation (3G) Code<br>
Division Multiple Access (cdma2000) protocols, which support wireless voice and data<br>
services.<br><br>
Among the many specifications promulgated by 3GPP2, is C.S0005-D vl .0 (TIA-2000.5-<br>
D), entitled "Upper Layer (Layer 3) Signalling Standard for cdma2000 Spread Spectrum<br>
Systems Release D," which is dated February 2004, is incorporated by reference herein in<br>
its entirety, and hereinafter referred to as the "Standard." As indicated by its title, the<br>
Standard specifies the signaling protocols and messaging format of network layer (Layer<br>
3) communication in a cdma2000-compliant communication network.<br>
The present invention recognizes that conventional wireless communication protocols, as<br>
exemplified by the Standard, do not support sufficient regulation of data messaging by<br>
mobile stations. For example, the Standard permits a base station to delay certain types<br>
of messaging by a mobile station (e.g., origination messages and resource requests), but<br>
does not support the regulation c f data burst messages by individual mobile stations. As<br>
a result, when network or radio channel congestion occurs, a base station may not be able<br>
to appropriately process or respond to data burst messages, resulting in lost data and<br>
unnecessary utilization of airlink resources.<br>
The present invention recognizes that it would be useful and desirable to reduce or<br>
eliminate such needless utilization of airlink resources by promoting improved regulation<br>
of data messaging by mobile stations.<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
In view of the foregoing and other shortcomings in the art, the present invention provides<br>
improved methods, systems and program products for communicating and/or controlling<br>
communication supporting enhanced regulation of data messaging by mobile stations.<br>
In accordance with at least one embodiment of the present invention, a communication<br>
network includes a base station in radio frequency communication with amobile station.<br>
In order to regulate packet data messaging by the mobile station, the base station<br>
transmits a message over-the-air to the mobile station. The message indicates that the<br>
mobile station is to delay transmitting packet data messages and a duration of delay. In<br>
response to receipt of the message from the base station, the mobile station delays over-<br>
the-air transmission of packet data messages (e.g., Data Burst Messages) in accordance<br>
with the indicated duration.<br>
All objects, features, and advantages of the present invention will become apparent in the<br>
following detailed written description.<br><br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF ILLUSTRATIVE EMBODIMENT<br>
With reference to the figures and in particular with reference to Figure 1, there is<br>
illustrated a high level block diagram of an exemplary communication network 100 in<br>
which the present invention may advantageously be implemented. As shown,<br>
communication network 100 comprises a number of geographically distributed<br>
transmission antennas 102, which transmit and receive radio frequency (RF) signals 104<br>
to and from network entities including mobile stations (MSs) 105. RF signals 104, which<br>
may employ any of a number of signaling protocols, such as Code Division Multiple<br>
Access (CDMA) or Global System for Mobiles (GSM), are generated by base transceiver<br>
stations (BTSs) 106, which are each affiliated with a respective one of the transmission<br>
antennas 102. BTSs 106 are in turn coupled to and controlled by base station controller<br>
(BSC) 108. Coupled to BSC108 are various network and communication terminals that<br>
originate and receive the communications transmitted over-the-air as RF signals.<br>
For example, in the depicted embodiment, network terminals from which<br>
communications originate include circuit voice and data network (e.g., a public switched<br>
telephone network (PSTN)) 110 and packet data network (PDN) 112. In the illustrated<br>
embodiment, PSTN 110 is connected to BSC 108 via a land line and a mobile switching<br>
center (MSC) 114. PDN 112 in connected to BSC 108 via a Packet Data Serving Node<br>
(PDSN) 116 and the Internet 118. It is understood that both PSTN 110 and PDN 112<br>
may comprise wireless devices (e.g., mobile telephones).<br>
Within communication networt 100, a network entity, such as amobile station or BSC,<br>
may be the source and/or recipient of both data and voice communications. Additionally,<br>
like network entities may function as both sources and recipients of voice and data<br>
network communications.<br><br>
Figure 2 depicts a more detailed block diagram of an exemplary base station (BS) 200<br>
within communication network 100 in accordance with the present invention. As shown,<br>
BS 200 comprises a data processing system or processor (e.g., computer, router, switch<br>
and/or switching center) to communicate voice and/or data over-the-air with one or more<br>
mobile stations 105. BS 200 includes a processor 202 that controls (i.e., executes)<br>
operations in accordance with the present invention. Processor 200 may perform such<br>
operations under the control of software or firmware residing within data storage 204<br>
(e.g., volatile and/or non-volatile storage) coupled to processor 202 by an interconnect<br>
206 or received by processor 2011 from a network interface unit or other Input/Output<br>
(I/O) device 208.<br>
BS 200 further includes a base transceiver station (BTS) 106, coupled to processor 200<br>
by interconnect 206, which opera tes as the carrier frequency controller. That is, BTS 106<br>
allocates RF communication channels to voice and data traffic and routes such traffic to<br>
and from an antenna 102 coupled to BTS 106.<br>
With reference now to Figure 3, :here is illustrated a more detailed block diagram of an<br>
exemplary mobile station 105 within communication network 200 in accordance with the<br>
present invention. As shown, mobile station 105 includes a controller 300 that generally<br>
includes a processor 302 and a memory 304 Processor 302 executes a control program<br>
stored within memory 304 to implement the subscriber unit side of the multiple-access<br>
protocol employed by communication network 100. Mobile station 105 further includes<br>
a speaker (ear piece) 306 by which controller 300 presents audio outputs to a subscriber<br>
and a microphone (mouth piece) 308 that receives audio inputs from the subscriber.<br>
Mobile station 105 also has a keypad 310 by which the subscriber can enter callee<br>
telephone numbers and other keyed inputs and a display 312 through which controller<br>
300 can visually present alphanumeric and graphical outputs for viewing by the<br>
subscriber. Finally, mobile station 300 includes a radio frequency transceiver 314 for<br><br>
sending and receiving wireless signals, including the messaging described herein, over-<br>
the-air.<br>
Although the invention may be implemented in communication networks supporting<br>
various protocols for RF communication, preferred embodiments of the invention will<br>
now be described in detail with reference to a CDMA network. In particular, preferred<br>
embodiments will be described with reference to a CDMA network implementing the<br>
Standard, which network utilizes Retry Order messages to regulate data burst messaging<br>
by particular mobile stations it. communication with a base station of a wireless<br>
communication network.<br>
Section 3.7.4.7 of the Standard defines a Retry Order message, which may be sent by a<br>
network entity (e.g., base station) on either the common channel or a traffic channel to<br>
indicate that a particular service is rejected and to specify a retry delay for the service.<br>
The fields within a conventional Retry Order message are summarized in Table I below.<br><br>
Of these conventional Retry Order fields defined by the Standard, the RETRY_YPE<br>
field defines the type of service tc be delayed.<br>
In accordance with a preferred embodiment of the present invention, the types of services<br>
that may be specified by the RETRY_TYPE field are expanded to include additional<br>
services, such as data burst messages. The possible values of the RETRY _TYPE field<br>
may thus be expanded, as summarized in Table II.<br><br><br>
In particular, as indicated by binary values '100' and '101', the RETRY_TYPE of a<br>
Retry Order message may specity data burst messages (DBMs) generally, or as shown in<br>
the particular embodiment of Table II, may specify a particular type of DBM (e.g., Short<br>
Data Burst or Short Message Service (SMS)) or a combination of a DBM and one or<br>
more other services or service requests. For example, the binary value '101' specifies a<br>
delay for Short Data Burst messages as well as Origination, Reconnect and Enhanced<br>
Origination Messages.<br>
Thus, a BS experiencing traffic congestion or other inability to process DBMs (or other<br>
selected message types) transmitted by a MS may transmit a Retry Order message to the<br><br>
MS (on the common channel or a traffic channel) to regulate the transmission of DBMs<br>
by the MS. The MS, in response to receipt of such a Retry Order message, disables<br>
transmission of the specified message type(s) to the BS for a delay indicated by the<br>
RETRY_DELAY field of the Retry Order message. This delay, which may be enforced<br>
by reference to a countdown counter within the MS, may be a matter of seconds or<br>
minutes. Alternatively, the delay may be indefinite. The MS preferably indicates (e.g.,<br>
via a text message presented within a display 312 of the MS) the type of service that has<br>
been disabled, and optionally the duration of the retry delay. It will be appreciated that<br>
the delay imposed by the BS applies individually to the MS receiving the Retry Order<br>
message and not to all MSs in communication with the BS.<br>
As indicated above in Table I, the Standard employs one value of the RETRY_TYPE<br>
field of the Retry Order message (i.e., '000') to indicate that all retry delays previously<br>
imposed by the BS are to be cleared at the MS. In accordance with another aspect of the<br>
present invention, the values of the RETRY_TYPE field are further expanded to permit<br>
the BS to selectively remove retry delays for selected types of messaging (e.g., Resource<br>
Request and Origination messages) and to optionally retain retry delays imposed on the<br>
MS by the BS for one or more other types of messaging (e.g., DBMs). This further<br>
expansion of the values of this RETRY_TYPE field is shown in Table HI below with the<br>
binary value '110'.<br><br><br>
In order to precisely specify which retry delays imposed by the BS on the MS are to be<br>
removed, the conventional Retry Order message represented in Table I is preferably<br>
augmented to include an optional NUM_TYPE_CLEAR field and, if it is present, one or<br>
more CLBAR_TYPE fields, as shown in Table TV.<br><br><br>
The NUM_TYPE_CLEAR field, which is preferably included within the Retry Order<br>
message only if RETRY_TYPE is set to '110' and is omitted otherwise, indicates the<br>
number of retry delay type(s) to be cleared by the Retry Order message. For example, in<br>
one implementation, the NUM_TYPE_CLEAR field is set by the BS to the number of<br>
retry delay types includec. in the Retry Order message minus one. In this<br>
implementation, if NUM _TYPE_CLEAR is included in the message, the BS also<br>
includes NUM_TYPE_CLE AR plus one occurrences of the CLEARJTYPE field, each<br>
of which indicates the Retry Type (e.g., '001' through '101') for which the imposed<br>
delay is to be cleared. Of course, the BS should not set any CLEAR_TYPE field to '000'<br>
and ' 110' in the depicted embodiment because these Retry Types are assigned to Retry<br>
Types that clear retry delays.<br>
In response to a Retry Order message with RETRY_TYPE set to '110', the MS clears the<br>
retry delay, if any, for each of the specifically identified Retry Types (but not necessarily<br>
all Retry Types). The MS may clear the retry delay by, for example, clearing a<br>
countdown timer within the MS utilized to enforce a retry delay imposed by the BS.<br><br>
Referring now to Figure 4A, there is illustrated a high level logical flowchart of a<br>
process by which aBS within a wireless communication network regulates messaging by<br>
a MS utilizing a Retry Order message in accordance with a preferred embodiment of the<br>
present invention. The illustrated process may be implemented, for example, as software<br>
or firmware stored within data storage 204 and executed by processor 202 of BS 200 of<br>
Figure 2. Alternatively or additionally, the process may be implemented utilizing<br>
hardware circuitry within BTS 106 and/or processor 202. The illustrated process maybe<br>
performed iteratively or in response to a dynamic network conditions or selected<br>
messaging patterns by one or more MSs.<br>
As shown the process begins at block 400 and thereafter proceeds to block 402, which<br>
depicts the BS determining whether or not it should regulate the transmission by a MS of<br>
a particular message type, such is DBMs. This determination may be made, for example,<br>
by reference to a messaging frequency of the MS (either in general or with reference to<br>
the particular message type) and/or one or more other criteria, such as network or radio<br>
channel congestion. In response to a determination that the BS does not need to regulate<br>
DBMs, the process proceeds from block 402 to block 406, which is described below. If,<br>
on the other hand, the BS determines at block 402 that itneeds to regulate transmission of<br>
DBMs by a MS, the process passes to block 404.<br>
Block 404 depicts the BS transmitting a Retry Order message over-the-air to the MS in<br>
order to impose a retry delay for DBMs (or for a particular type of DBM, such as Short<br>
Data Burst or Short Message Service). As described above, the Retry Order message<br>
identifies DBMs in the RETRY _TYPE field and, in the RETRY_DELAY field, specifies<br>
a particular delay interval or an indefinite delay. Next, at block 406, the BS determines<br>
whether or not it has the ability to process particular messages (e.g., DBMs) from a MS<br>
upon which the BS has imposed a retry delay. If not, the process terminates at block 410.<br>
If, however, the MS now has the ability to process a message type upon which the BS<br>
has imposed a retry delay, the BS transmits a Retry Delay message to the relevant MS, as<br><br>
shown at block 408. The Retry Order message contains a RETRY_TYPE field set to<br>
signify either "Clear All" ('000') or "Clear" ('110') in order to remove one or more retry<br>
delays. As noted above, with the "Clear" RETRYJTYPE, the BS may remove fewer<br>
than all existing retry delays for the MS. Thereafter, the process terminates at block 410.<br>
With reference now to Figure 415, there is depicted a high level logical flowchart of a<br>
process by which a mobile station in communication with a wireless communication<br>
network processes a Retry Order message in accordance with a preferred embodiment of<br>
the present invention. As will be appreciated by those skilled in the art, the illustrated<br>
process may be implemented in hardware circuitry with controller 300 and/or RF<br>
transceiver 314 of MS 105, or alternatively or additionally, as software or firmware<br>
stored within memory 304 and executed by processor 302.<br>
As shown, the process of Figure 4B begins at block 420 and thereafter proceeds to block<br>
422, which illustrates the MS determining whether or not a message received from the<br>
BS is a Retry Order message. If not, the process shown in Figure 4B terminates at bock<br>
434, and the MS processes the message in a conventional manner. If the MS determines<br>
at block 422 that the received message is a Retry Order message, the process proceeds to<br>
block 424, which illustrates the MS examining the Retry Type specified within the Retry<br>
Order message. If the Retry Type indicates that the Retry Order message is intended to<br>
clear a retry delay imposed by the BS (e.g., the Retry Type field is set to '000' or * 110'),<br>
the process proceeds to block 426. Otherwise, the process passes from block 424 to<br>
block 430.<br>
Referring now to block 426, the MS responds to a Retry Order message specifying a<br>
"Clear All" or "Clear" Retry Typo by enabling the transmission by the MS of one or<br>
more message types indicated by the Retry Order message. The MS also resets the<br>
countdown counter(s), if any, allocated to measure the retry delay of the indicated<br>
message types. Thereafter, the process terminates at block 434.<br><br>
With reference now to block 430, the MS processes a Retry Order message that specifies<br>
a retry delay for one or more message types (e.g., DBMs) by disabling transmission by<br>
the MS of the indicated message type(s). In addition, as shown at block 432, the MS<br>
allocates and starts a countdown counter for each retry delay quantified by the Retry<br>
Order message (i.e., the non-indefinite retry delays). The MS will be enabled to transmit<br>
the message types subject to retry delay after the earliest to occur of the expiration of the<br>
retry delay and the receipt of a Retry Order message clearing the retry delay. Thereafter,<br>
the process depicted in Figure 4B terminates at block 434.<br>
Turning now to Figures 5A and 5B, there are illustrated two exemplary message flows in<br>
which data messaging by a MS is regulated utilizing a Retry Order message in<br>
accordance with the present invention. In Figure 5A, MS 105 first transmits a DBM<br>
500, such as a Short Data Burst, to BS 200. In response to being unable to process the<br>
DBM 500, for example, because of traffic channel or network congestion, BS 200<br>
transmits a Retry Order message 502 to MS 105. As indicated, Retry Order message 502<br>
contains a Retry Type field set to '100' in order to impose a retry delay on the<br>
transmission of DBMs by MS 105.<br>
Thereafter, when BS 200 is again able to process DBMs, BS 200 transmits a second<br>
Retry Order0. message 504 to MS 105 in order to clear the retry delay. In the depicted<br>
scenario, Retry Order message 504 contains a Retry Type field set to '110' in order to<br>
clear only the retry delay for DBMs earlier imposed on MS 105. In response to Retry<br>
Order message 504, MS 105 clears the retry delay for DBMs and is therefore able to<br>
again transmit DBMs, such as DEM 506.<br>
Figure 5B illustrates a second message flow in accordance with apreferred embodiment<br>
of the present invention. In this message flow, BS 200 first transmits a Retry Order<br>
message 510 to MS 105 to impose a retry delay on the transmission of DBMs by MS<br><br>
105. It should be noted that in the message flow of Figure 5B, the retry delay is<br>
transmitted in response to detection of network congestion generally rather than in<br>
response to specific messaging by MS 105. The Retry Order message specifies a<br>
particular retry delay interval, which as described above, is timed by MS 105. After the<br>
expiration of the specified retry delay interval, MS 105 is again permitted to transmit<br>
DBMs, such as Short Data Burst 512. In the depicted message flow, no Retry Order<br>
message is transmitted by BS 200 to clear the retry delay for DBMs.<br>
As has been described, the present invention provides improved methods, systems and<br>
program products for improved regulation of messaging by mobile stations in over-the-<br>
air communication with a base station in a wireless communication network. In<br>
accordance with the present invention, a BS can regulate transmission of one or more<br>
particular message types such as DBMs (or even particular types of DBMs, such as Short<br>
Data Bursts) by transmitting a message (e.g., Retry Order) to a MS. The disabling of the<br>
particular message can be of an indefinite or definite duration. The BS can also re-enable<br>
transmission of one or more message type(s) by the MS by transmitting to the MS an<br>
additional message (e.g., a Retry Order message). In one embodiment, the additional<br>
message may clear fewer than all messaging delays imposed by the BS on the MS.<br>
While the invention has been particularly shown as described with reference to a<br>
preferred embodiment, it will be understood by those skilled in the art that various<br>
changes in form and detail may be made therein without departing from the spirit and<br>
scope of the invention. For example, although the present invention has been described<br>
with respect to a particular Standard and specified field names, it will be appreciated that<br>
the present invention is also applicable to wireless communication employing other<br>
standards and/or technologies and/or utilizing different fields and/ormessage to regulate<br>
messaging by mobile stations.<br><br>
In addition, although aspects of the present invention have been described with respect to<br>
systems (e.g., mobile stations and base stations) executing software that directs the<br>
functions of the present invention, it should be understood that present invention may<br>
alternatively be implemented a 3a program product for use with a data processing system.<br>
Programs defining the functions of the present invention can be delivered to a data<br>
processing system via a variety of signal-bearing media, which include, without<br>
limitation, non-rewritable storage media (e.g., CD-ROM), rewritable storage media (e.g.,<br>
a floppy diskette or hard disk drive), and communication media, such as digital and<br>
analog networks. It should be understood, therefore, that such signal-bearing media,<br>
when carrying or encoding computer readable instructions that direct the functions of the<br>
present invention, represent alternative embodiments of the present invention.<br><br>
