The invention relates to a process for the preparation of a compound containing one or more amide bonds, in particular peptides, especially for processes performed in solution.<br>
Peptides are synthesized either in solution or on a solid support. In both approaches coupling and deprotection steps repetitively alternate and may be separated by intermittent purifications. An excess of an activated carboxylic component is preferably used in each coupling step to ensure quantitative coupling to an amino component; thus the occurrence of deletion sequences in the final product can be avoided. In solid phase peptide synthesis residual activated carboxylic component is usually removed by filtration at the end of each coupling step. In solution phase synthesis it is usually assumed that the residual activated carboxylic component is destroyed and removed during the intermittent aqueous work-up. Insertion peptide sequences, however, are often encountered in solution phase synthesis as impurities of the final peptide due to incomplete removal of residual (activated) carboxylic component after a coupling step, which subsequently has coupled following deprotection. In order to avoid the occurrence of said side-reactions a scavenging step may be introduced directly after the coupling step to scavenge (inactivate) the residual activated carboxylic functions. Amines are usually applied as scavengers. The use of polyamines as scavengers leads to scavenged compounds which may be actively extracted into a - preferably acidic -aqueous phase, depending on their polarity [e.g. Kisfaludy, L. et al (1974) Tetrahedron Lett. 19, 1785-1786]. This extraction is usually performed before the deprotection step to avoid loss of the growing peptide into the aqueous phase. However, this procedure has in numerous cases been found to result in incomplete intermittent purification due to the hydrophobicity of the scavenged compound: the intrinsic hydrophobicity of the amino acyl part of the carboxylic component is enhanced by the still present amino-protecting group. Aqueous extraction is thus not completely effective.<br>
Recently, Carping, L. A. et al [(1999) /. Org. Chem. 64, 4324-4338] reported an improvement of the scavenging method. In addition to the use of a polyamine as a scavenger the amino-protecting group l,l-dioxobenzo[b]thiophene-2-ylmethoxycarbonyl (Bsmoc) was applied in the process. The Bsmoc function has very high liability towards base. As a result thereof, residual<br><br>
activated carboxylic functions are scavenged and Bsmoc functions are removed in one and the same step using a polyamine.<br>
A new process has now been found for the preparation of peptides, wherein an excess of an activated Carboxylic component is used to acylate an amino component, and wherein after the acylation an amine comprising a free anion or a latent anion {i.e. anion forming upon deprotection) is used as a scavenger of residual activated carboxylic functions. This new process allows an essentially arbitrary choice of the protecting group at the N-terminus of the activated carboxylic component, since - in contrast to the Carping process - deprotection thereof does not necessarily take place under the same reaction conditions as the scavenging of excess of activated carboxylic functions. Furthermore, the process of this invention allows for highly efficient removal of residual activated carboxylic component without encountering the hydrophobicity problems of other prior art processes in which polyamines are used as scavengers. Preferably, the process of the invention takes place in solution. However, the process may also be applied in solid phase peptide synthesis. The process of the invention is also suitable for the preparation of other compounds containing one or more amide bonds. In a preferred embodiment, an amine comprising a latent anion is used as the scavenger. Preferably, the latent anion in the scavenging amine bears a temporary protecting group which can be selectively removed in the presence of any permanent protecting group attached to the growing peptide. In a particularly prefeixed embodiment the protecting group of the latent anion in the scavenging amine displays a lability similar to that of the temporary protecting group present at the N-temainus of the growing peptide. This allows the deprotection of the scavenger yielding the anion and the N-terminal deprotection of the growing peptide to talked place in a single process step. Especially preferred is the process of the invention wherein the temporary protecting groups, present at the N-tuitions of the growing peptide and optionally present in the scavenger, are hydrogenolytically removable groups whereas the permanent protecting groups are acidolytically removable protecting groups. Preferably, said temporary protecting groups are of the benzyl type, e.g. (substituted) benzyl and benzyloxycarbonyl groups. A preferred scavenger is a primary amine comprising a free anion or a latent anion, and in particular a C-terminally protected amino acid derivative. Besides carboxylate, the scavenging amine may comprise other anionic functions such as - but not limited to - sulfonate, sulfate, phosphonate, phosphate or phenolate. A highly preferred amino acid for use as a scavenger is (5-<br><br>
alanine or a derivative thereof (e.g, an ester or silyl ester derivative). The most preferred<br>
scavenger is benzyl p-alaninate or a salt thereof.<br>
A thiol comprising a fire or a latent anion may also be used as a scavenger instead of an amine<br>
comprising a free or a latent anion according to tlie process of this invention.<br>
Tlie scavenger is preferably used in a two- to six fold molar excess with respect to the residual<br>
active component that needs to be scavenged.<br>
The use of a scavenger according to the present invention leads to hydrophilic scavenged<br>
compounds which may be actively extracted into a basic aqueous phase after the deprotection<br>
step: upon deprotection (if applicable), hydrophobicity is enhanced by the presence of both a free<br>
amino function and a free carboxylic function in the scavenged species. Thus, the process of<br>
this invention results in a very effective intermittent purification due to the possibility of<br>
actively extracting a hydrophilic scavenged compound. In addition, a possibly present excess of<br>
carboxylic component which was not activated and whose temporary protecting group was also<br>
removed during deprotection, is extracted from the reaction mixture at the same time.<br>
The new process of this invention may conveniently be used in the preparation of oligo- and<br>
polypeptides and, more generally, in the preparation of compounds containing one or more<br>
amide bonds.<br>
A suitable process according to the present invention is the coupling of an excess of a carboxylic component to an amino component, wherein the carboxylic function is reactivated or activated in situ using a coupling reagent and, if desired, an additive. Following the coupling step, residual activated carboxylic functions are scavenged by adding the scavenger to the reaction mixture. Subsequently, temporary protecting groups are removed using suite methods known in the art, followed by removal of the scavenged compound by basic aqueous extraction. At the same time, a possibly present excess of carboxylic component which was not activated and whose temporary protecting group was also removed during deprotection, is extracted from the reaction mixture.<br>
The term amino component refers to a molecule comprising a free amino function. In particular, the amino component may be any amine, amino acid or oligopeptide which bears a free amino function and whose other functional groups are protected in such a manner that they do not interfere with the desired coupling reaction. The C-terminal function of the applied amino acid<br><br>
or oligopeptide may be protected as a substituted or unsubstituted amide or as an ester; examples of the latter include - but are not limited to - methyl, ethyl, ^butyl, benzyl, phenacyl, 3-(3-methyl)pentyl (Mpe), 2-(2-phenyl)propyl (Pp), 2-chlorotrityl (Clt), diphenyl(4-pyridyl)methyl (PyBzh), dicyclopropylmethyl (Dcpm), 9-fluorenyhnethyl (Fm), allyl (All), 2-(trimethylsilyl)ethyl (Tmse), 4-{N-[l-(4,4-dimethyl-2,6-dioxocyclohexyHdene)-3-methylbutyl]-amino} benzyl (Dmab) esters and enzymatically cleavable esters [Roeske, R.W.

The tenn carboxyhc component refers to a molecule comprising a free carboxylic function. In particular, the carboxylic component may be any carboxylic acid, amino acid or oligopeptide which bears a free carboxylic function and whose other functional groups are protected in such a manner that they do not interfere with the desired coupling reaction. In a preferred<br><br>
embodiment, the amino group of the applied amino acid or oligopeptide is temporarily protected by a benzyloxycarbonyl (Z) function; other examples include - but are not limited to - the Boc, Trt, fluoren-9-ylmethoxycarbonyl (Fmoc), 2-(methylsulfonyl)ethoxycarbonyl (Msc), allyloxycaxbonyl (Alloc) functions, functions of the arylsulfonyl type, such as ortho-nitrobenzenesulfonyl (o-NBS) and enzymatically cleavable functions [Geiger, R. and Konig, W. (1981) in: 'The Peptides  vol 3 (Gross, E. and Meienliofer, J., eds.) Academic Press, New York, pp. 1-99; for Alloc: Kunz, H. and Unverzagt, C. (1984) Angew. Chem. 96, 426-427; for arylsulfonyl: Fukuyama, T. et al (1997) Tetrahedron Lett. 38, 5831-5834]. Functions of the t-butyl type or functions of similar labihty are preferred for the permanent protection of other functional groups in the carboxylic component as described above for the amino component. The carboxylic component may be preactivated as an active ester, preferably an 7\^-hydroxysuccinimide, benzotriazol-1-yl, pentafluorophenyl or 4-nitrophenyl ester, a halide, an 7\^-carboxyanhydride or as a symmetric anhydride. Alternatively, the carboxylic component may be activated in situ as a mixed anhydride or using a coupling reagent, such as a caxbodiimide, preferably MA'-dicyclohexylcarbodiimide (DCC) or l-(3'-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride (EDC), a uronium or a phosphonium salt in the possible presence of a coupling additive, preferably A -hydroxysuccinimide (HONSu), 1-hydroxybenzotriazole (HOBt)' 3"hydroxy-4-oxo-3,4-dihydro-l,2,3-benzotriazine (HOOBt), 1-hydroxy-7-azabenzotriazole (HOAt) or 6-chloro-l-hydroxybenzotriazole (Cl-HOBt) and if required in the presence of a tertiary amine ['The Peptides  vol. 1 (1979) (Gross, E. and Meienhofer, J., eds.) Academic Press, New York; Li, P. and Xu, J.-C. (2000) Chin, J. Chem. 18, 456-466].<br>
The temporary protecting group may be removed according to methods known in the art {vide supra). The Z function may be removed by hydrogenolysis using (standard) procedures that apply, e.g. hydrogen gas or formiate as a hydrogen donor. During this proces all benzyl-type protecting groups aim’s removed and protecting groups of the r-butyl type or functions of similar lability are maintained. The latter may be removed by acidolysis according to the methods known in the art.<br>
A person skilled in the art will understand what is meant with the term basic aqueous extraction. However, basic aqueous extractions are preferably performed using aqueous solutions of sodium hydrogencarbonate or sodium carbonate, if desired in the presence of sodium chloride<br><br>
or potassium nitrate. The term active aqueous extraction refers to an extraction in which either an amino component is extracted under acidic conditions in the protonated form (ammonium) or a carboxylic component is extracted under basic conditions in the deprotonated form (carboxylate).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of a compound containing one or more amide bonds using an excess of an activated carboxylic component to acylate an amino component, wherein after the acylation an amine comprising a latent anion or a thiol comprising a free anion or a latent anion is used as a scavenger of residual activated carboxylic functions.<br>
