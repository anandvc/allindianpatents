This invention relates to a medical chair for efficient haemodialysis treatment, blood collection and the like medical purpose and more specifically, the chair used by medical professionals to place a patient in a desired position and continuously display the weight during the treatment. The chair according to this invention besides having the ability to display the weight of the patient seated on it and also has ability to raise, lower and recline a patient seated within the chair and also the ability to recline the patient's back support and raise the patient's lower leg support by way of a pivoting seat, back rest and leg rest individually. It has also ability to simply tilt the patient's seat without changing the position of patient.<br>
Many chairs have been developed in the medical field for placing patients in a desired position for treatment or diagnosis. These include dental chairs and ophthalmologic chairs. Most of these chairs have restricted movement which limits patient's comfort positioning. The medical/therapy or treatments like haemodialysis needs to measure patient's weight before and after treatment as key monitoring parameter of the treatment. Particularly in the haemodialysis treatment, the Patient has to under go the treatment of four hours thrice a week and has to be weighed before and after treatment for recording the fluid removal from the patient body during the treatment. It was very difficult for medical professionals to weigh those patients who cannot stand without support and were not able to get correct body weight, which is key parameter of the haemodialysis treatment to check for its effectiveness. The patient has to get treatment every second day for four hours hence it was very discomfortable for them to be in particular position continuously for four hours. The existing chairs provide some limited flexibility to change patient position and only with help of caretaker or other nursing staff. Various chairs have been proposed in the past; however, no chair has adequately and efficiently allowed a patient to feel comfortable during or after diagnosis or haemodialysis treatment and weighing of the physically disabled patients as well as aged patients in seating position.<br>
For these and other reasons, the main object of this invention is to provide a<br>
medical/therapy chair with weight display system, which is cost efficient and facilitates<br>
the medical professional to weight patients who cannot stand on conventional weighing<br>
scale without support and which can be used by a medical professional, dialysis centers,<br>
blood collection units and hospitals for both weight display and to position a patient in<br>
desired	comfortable	position.<br>
The chair of this invention has a wired handset that provides flexible patient positioning without the help of caretakers. This will make patient to utilize the treatment time for other activity like reading, watching TV or listening music and also provide freedom to do his activities like drinking water, food etc. The major advantage of this invention is that the patient will be weighed correctly and paramedical staff can online monitor the weight loss continuously as a result of haemodialysis treatment.<br>
Additional advantages and objects of the invention will become more readily apparent to those of ordinary skill upon review of the following detailed description of the preferred embodiment   taken   in   conjunction   with   the   accompanying   drawings   wherein:<br><br>
FIG. 1 shows an elevation of a medical/ medical/therapy chair with weight display system constructed in accordance with this invention in entry position with arm rest control panel and head cushion. (Armrest is shown without cushion for better view.)<br>
FIG. 2 is an elevation similar to FIG. 1 but showing the chair in seat-tilted position and having certain conventional items, such as the arm rests, headrest control panel, removed for clarity;<br>
FIG. 3 is an elevation similar to FIG. 2 but showing the chair in seat tilted position and leg rest up position;<br>
FIG. 4 is an elevation similar to FIG. 2 but showing the chair in safety trendelenburg position;<br>
FIG.5 is an elevation similar to FIG. 1 but showing the chair in Entry position;<br>
FIG. 6 is a view of user-friendly hand set;<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a medical medical/therapy chair with weight display constructed in accordance with a preferred embodiment of this invention. The medical/therapy chair comprises an individually lockable castor mounted base 1, weight measuring device 2, isolation member 3, pivoted arms 4 &amp;5, seat support member 6, seat member 7, back rest member 8, digital display box 9, leg rest member 10, foot rest 11, arm rest 12, head cushion 13, mattress 14, control panel 15, safety trendelenburg push button 16, weight system       control       box       17,       and       zero       set       push       button       18.<br>
As shown in FIG. 1 the detachable mattress 14 divided in three parts is fixed to back rest, seat and leg rest members with quick tie strap. This enables easy removal of mattress for cleaning and disinfections. The adjustable head cushion 13 is tied with backrest over the mattress. This provides flexibility to accommodate different height of patients. The armrests 12 are pivoted with seat and backrest members. The armrest can be moved to side and set at any desired position, which facilitates medical professionals and paramedical staff to perform difficult task of vascular access. The footrest 11 is slide fixed to leg rest 10 and can be set to desired distance.<br>
As shown in FIG.l, the backrest member 8 is pivoted with seat support member 6 and the linear actuator 26 is pivoted between extended part of backrest and bracket 30 mounted at bottom of seat member. This enables individual movement of backrest alone.<br>
The leg rest 10 is pivoted with knee joint end of seat member 7 and the linear actuator 27 for leg rest 10 is pivoted between bracket 31 mounted at bottom of the leg rest 10 and seat member 7. This enables individual setting of leg rest without changing other positions of the chair.<br>
The seat member 7 is pivoted with seat support member 6 along with linear actuator 28 pivoted between bracket 32 mounted at bottom ot seat member 7 and seat support<br><br>
member 6. This enables the chair to turn into safety trendelenburg position from the bed position.<br>
The seat support member 6 is attached to isolation member 3 through pivoted arms 4 and 5 with pin and bushings. A linear actuator 29 is pivoted between the pivoted arm 5 and isolation member 3 to enable up/ down movement of the medical/therapy chair.<br>
The isolation member 3 is attached with base member through, on line weight measuring device 2 and provides separation from other parts of medical/therapy chair. A weight system control box 17 is located at the bottom of the base member. A weight zero set push buttons 18 is also provided at the side of base member. A control circuit for linear actuators and power source are fixed in a control panel 15 hanged at the bottom of seat member. The wired handset is connected to control panel. All linear actuators are secured with members with pin and locking means for pivoted action.<br>
FIG 2.is showing inclined positioning of seat member, which provides maximum comfort to the patient. The seat is tilted at 15° angle from horizontal through operating linear actuator 26 in forward direction with the help of handset.<br>
FIG 3. Illustrates a view of forward movement of linear actuators 26 and 27. This also shows different comfort positioning of patient with medical/therapy chair. This position can be achieved by pressing button on handset for forward movement of respective linear actuators.<br>
FIG 4. is showing a safety trendelenburg position of chair. During treatment, if patient suffers from hypotension due to low blood pressure, it is necessary to provide enough blood flow to heart. A separate button in red is provided in handset that synchronizes the movement of all actuators and converts the medical/therapy chair into safety trendeleburg position from any state. This is a very critical condition therefore a separate push button 16 is provided on control panel 15 where a caretaker can also operate the chair in emergency conditions.<br>
FIG 5 shows entry position of chair. Where the chair is at minimum height and seat is also in horizontal plane, the other members are in chair position and the armrest is moved vertically up to facilitate a patient to enter or come out of the chair. This position can be achieved by pressing the separate button provided on the hand set which converts chair to entry position from any state.<br>
FIG 6 describes push buttons on handset to facilitate functioning of medical/therapy chair. There are eight buttons for individual forward and backward movement of four linear actuators. Three synchronized movement buttons for converting medical/therapy chair in to safety trendeleburg, bed and entry position and the last red button is for call to attendant.<br>
