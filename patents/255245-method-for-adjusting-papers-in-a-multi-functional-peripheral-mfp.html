				<td>FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the field of Multi Functional Peripheral (MFPs). Particularly, the invention proposes a method for adjusting the position of paper in Laser Beam Printers. More particularly the present invention relates to a method and system for adjusting paper in printer/scanner.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
Patent no. GB2232640A, titled." Initializing position of continuous stationery in selective printers", describes a printer for setting the start position of the printing operation at a desired position on the printing paper. The desired start position of the paper can be set by observing a setting value displayed on the LCD device of the printer. The setting value can be incremented or decremented by operating the up and down switches provided on the LCD device.<br>
Another patent no. JP2255352A, titled," Adjusting apparatus for distance of paper of printer", patent publication proposes a method for automatically adjusting the suitable distance of paper in a printer. An operating unit is used to set a detent number, which is displayed on a display unit. A stepping motor is then rotated by an amount corresponding to the displayed detent number to adjust the paper.<br>
In yet anther patent no. US2005146760A1, titled," Apparatus and method for scanning specific area of document in a scanning apparatus", discloses a flatbed type scanning apparatus wherein a specific area of a document can be scanned. The specific area to be scanned is input by a user by coordinate input means provided on the operation panel of the scanning apparatus. After receiving input from the user, a scanning module is moved to the scanning start position for scanning the document. However, the document is not adjusted in this case; rather it is the scanning module that is moved.<br><br>
The concept of adjusting the initial position of a paper in a printer using keys of the operation panel has been disclosed in the patent publication GB2232640A. The Japanese patent publication JP2255352A also mentions a similar concept. However, JP2255352A has been analysed based on its title and abstract available in English. Further, the concept of displaying the setting value or the amount of distance moved by the printer has also been disclosed in the patent publication GB2232640A. The concept of scanning a specified portion of the paper has been disclosed in the patent publication US2005146760A1. However, the publication mentions the scanning to start from a specified position, rather than adjusting the position of paper within the scanner before starting the scan.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The invention relates to the field of Multi Functional Peripheral (MFPs). Particularly, the invention proposes a method for adjusting the position of paper in Laser Beam Printers. A user can adjust the printing position according to his requirements before printing the document. The input to the printer is given by pressing buttons (one for each direction) present on the panel of the printer. The forward or backward movement of the paper can be calculated and controlled by keeping track of the motor count value for the printer. Further, the distance moved by the paper can be displayed on an output device or a display panel of a printer.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method for adjusting papers in an MFP comprising the steps of:<br>
a.	setting a threshold value for a key press event by a user;<br>
b.	calibrating the forward or backward movement of the paper by<br>
keeping track of the motor count value for the printer;<br>
c.	comparing a current motor count value and the set threshold value;<br>
d.	displaying the distance moved by the paper on an output device or a<br>
display panel of the MFP; and<br>
e.	setting the paper adjustment accordingly in the printer.<br><br>
The motor count value, is proportional to the number of times the motor rotates to move the paper. The input to the printer is given by pressing buttons present on the panel of the MFR If the user presses forward button the paper moves forward and the distance moved is calculated by using the motor count value. If the user presses backward button the paper moves backward and the distance moved is calculated by using the motor count value. Paper from paper source is adjusted and moved forward or backward when a key press event is detected by pressing either forward or backward keys. When a key is pressed then the current motor count value is checked against the threshold values. If the current motor count value is less than the threshold value for forward direction then the paper is moved step by step till the user releases the key or till the maximum threshold limit is reached. After moving paper backward the motor count value is decremented accordingly till the said count either reaches the minimum threshold for the backward direction or till the user presses the backward key.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a system for adjusting papers in an MFP comprising:<br>
a.	interface for setting a threshold value for a key press event by a user;<br>
b.	calibrating means for calculating the forward or backward movement<br>
of the paper by keeping track of the motor count value for the printer;<br>
c.	comparison means for comparing a current motor count value and the<br>
set threshold value; and<br>
d.	an interface for displaying the distance moved by the paper on an<br>
output device or a display panel of the MFP.<br>
These and other objects, features and advantages of the present invention will become more apparent from the ensuing detailed description of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 is a flow chart depicting the proposed invention<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The preferred embodiments of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiments are merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail.<br>
In accordance with the proposed invention, the user can avail the facility of controlling the paper to be moved forward or backward as per requirement, by keeping track of the motor count value i.e, the number of times the motor rotates to move the paper.<br>
For printing, paper is taken from the input tray and is pushed (moved) forward in the guided paper path. The movement of paper is aided by the motor that will be in contact with the paper. By counting how many times the motor has rotated the length of paper that has been moved forward will be calculated.<br>
If the user presses forward button it will move the paper forward and calculates the distance moved forward by using the motor count value. Then the same is communicated to user by means of standard Output device (Display Panel),<br><br>
Referring to figure 1 paper from paper source can be adjusted and moved forward or backward by pressing either up or down keys. The paper adjust menu is selected (step 2 of Fig 1) and then key press event is detected (step 3 of fig 1). If no key press event is detected after timeout value it returns to the default. On key press event is send to (usually a rotator mechanism like motor) which control's the movement of paper (step 4 of Fig 1). Read the value of current Motor Count from the above mechanism (step 5 of Fig 1). If forward key is pressed then the current read value is checked against the threshold values (step 6 of Fig 1). Threshold values are the maximum values till which a paper can be moved forward or backward from the current position so that there is some printable or scan area left in paper. These are pre set tables and vary from one model to another model of printer. Also these values will vary based on the current paper size selected. If Current Motor value is less than the threshold value for forward direction then move the paper step by step and update display in the Ul till the user releases the key or till the Maximum threshold limit is reached (step 8 a of Fig 1). Then exit or return, (step 9 a of Fig 1). If not forward key then check the current value is greater than the threshold value for backward direction. In this case after moving paper backward the motor count value is decremented accordingly till it either reaches the minimum threshold for the backward direction or till the user presses the backward key. (Step 8 b of fig 1). An additional (step 7 of Fig 1) is required to send event to paper control mechanism to reverse the direction of paper motion. Set Motor Rotating Direction to default value and return (step 9 b of Fig 1). Display corresponding messages or errors in case of either maximum or minimum threshold has been reached. All the above steps will allow the paper of selected size to be adjusted either by moving it further forward or backward as per the required printing or scanning needs.<br>
The proposed invention can be further implemented for scan input tray, where in paper is taken for scanning. This has an advantage that if the user wants to scan only a particular portion of the paper, say only the bottom portion, user can position the paper in such a manner that only the required portion gets scanned, even before initiating scanning.<br><br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a microchip, microprocessor, handheld communication device, computer, rendering device or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart therefrom.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
