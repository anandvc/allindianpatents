				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to a process for producing high strength steel plates of minimum yield strength 450 MPa and thickness upto 32 mm.<br>
The invention relates more particularly to  a process for producing 8 to 32 mm thick high strength steel plates which are microalloyed with Nb,  Ti and V,  and of minimum yield strength (YS)   450 MPa,   tensile strength (TS)  570 MPa,  elongation % (EL)   19, Charpy Impact Energy  (CIE)  30 J at 0°C and 20 J at -20°C,   and bend 3 T,  and are meant for use  in the construction of bridges, dams,   converters,  plant machinery,   mining machinery,   impellers, excavators etc.<br>
In the existing processes,   two grades  of high tensile strength steel plates,   namely grades I and II,  having specified minimum mechanical properties YS 350 MPa,   TS 490 MPa,   EL% 21, CIE 40 J at 0°C and 30 J at -20°C,   bend 3 T;   and YS 410 MPa, TS 540 MPa,  EL% 20,   CIE 35 J at 0°C and 25 J at -20°C,  bend 3 T; respectively are produced.<br>
The  drawbacks of the existing processes are:     (a)  the mechanical properties are not of such high values as to allow use  of plates of reduced thickness for lowering consumption of steel in the  construction of bridges,  plants and machineries; and (b)  an additional  cost for applying the normalising treatment of the plates of thickness &gt;12 mm is required to meet the specified mechanical properties thereof.<br>
The objective  of the  invention is to provide a process for producing steel plates of thickness 8-32  mm having the<br>
-    2     -<br><br>
specified improved mechanical properties along with satisfactory weldability thereof.<br>
The other objective is to reduce the  consumption of steel by lowering the  thickness of steel plates for a given tensile  strength thereof and reduce thereby the effective cost of the plates for given end uses.<br>
The existing process comprises the following steps in sequence  :-<br>
(i)      preparing molten steel of chemical composition,   as given in Table I for Grades I and II steel in a BOF converter in the  following method.     Hot metal  from blast furnace is used as the  input metal along with Fe-Mn,   Fe-Si,  Al,  lime,   fluorspar etc.     Oxygen is blown,   deslagged and the liquid metal is poured into the ladle.     Ferroalloy additions are done to arrive at the desired chemistry.     The liquid steel is then subjected to secondary refining in a ladle  furnace  (LF)  or vacuum arc degassing (VAD)  unit to reduce the  S level and the  inclusion content in the steel.<br>
Ti is added in the final stages of steelmaking,  after the liquid steel is completely dexoidised with Al and Si.     This prevents loss of Ti in the form of TiO and facilitates formation of TiN and TiCN during the hoi rolling process which adds to the strength;<br>
(ii)     converting the molten steel into slabs  by ingot/ continuous casting;<br>
(iii)     reheating the slabs to a temperature of 125O°C max in a furnace:<br>
-    3    -<br><br>
(iv)      rolling the  slabs at an initial temperature  of about 1150°C in a roughening stand;<br>
(v)      finish rolling the slabs in a finishing stand at an initial temperature of 1000°C max and finish rolling temperature of 850-900°C into plates of thickness 8-40 mm for grade I and 8-32 mm for grade II steel;<br>
(vi)      cooling the plates of thickness 20-40 mm by water spraying to a temperature of 720 ± 20°C;<br>
(vii)      subjecting the plates of thickness  12-40 mm and 12-32 mm respectively of the two grades to a normalising treatment in a furnace at a temperature  of 910 ± 10°C for attaining the specified mechanical properties thereof through uniform distribution of the fine grains in the microstructure  of the steel.<br>
The invented process comprises the following steps in sequence :-<br>
(i)      preparing molten steel of chemical composition as given for grade III steel in Table I,   in a BOF converter;<br>
(ii) secondary refining the chemical composition of the molten steel in a ladle furnace (LF) or in a VAD (vacuum are degassing) unit to  reduce the  S level and the  inclusion content;<br>
(iii)       converting the molten steel into slabs of preferred cross-section 200 x 1500 mm or 250 x 1500 mm by continuous casting at  tundish temperature  of 154O-155OOC,   casting speed of 0.6-0.8 m/min,   cooling water consumption in secondary cooling  stage of 0.45-0.50 litre/kg of steel produced,  and unbending point slab temperature  of above 850°C;<br>
-    4    -<br><br>
(iv)      reheating the slabs to a temperature of 123O°C max in a furnace;<br>
(v)       rolling the slabs at an initial temperature of 1100°C max in a roughing stand, with  reduction in slab thickness  of 15% min in each rolling pass;<br>
(vi)       rolling the slabs in a finishing stand at an initial temperature of 900°C max and finish rolling temperature of 810 ± 10°C for plates of thickness  20-32 mm and  of 830°C max for plates  of thickness less than 20 mm with minimum cumulative reduction in plate  thickness of 60% and minimum reduction in plate thickness in the last rolling pass of 10%;<br>
(vii)       cooling the plates of thickness 20-32 mm by water-spraying at a cooling rate of 5-9°C/sec to a temperature of 650  + 20°C;   followed by air cooling to ambient  temperature;<br>
(viii)     air-cooling the  plates  of thickness 8-20 mm.<br>
The improved mechanical properties of grade III steel plates produced in the invented process as given in Table II has been attained v/ithout applying the   normalising  treatment on the finished plates,   as  followed in the  existing processes  for producing grades  I and II steel.     This has been achieved partly through the modification of the  chemical composition of the steel  and partly  through  the  optimisation of the  casting and rolling parameters  in the  invented process,   such as herein described.     Certain special features  of the chemical  composition of the steel are  further discussed below.<br>
(i)       Carbon content is restricted to 0.13-0.15% for plates of thickness below 20 mm and to 0.14-0.16% for plates of thickness 20-32 mm.<br>
-    5    -<br><br>
(ii)       Titanium is added in a small proportion of 0.02-0.03% to reduce the Austenite grain size during the reheating treatment of the slabs and thereby produce a relatively fine Perrite-Pearlite grain size in the finish rolled plates with consequent improvement in the mechanical properties of the plates.<br>
The presence of Titanium in the  steel prevents also grain coarsening during welding of the steel in the heat affected zones thereof and improves thereby the  toughness and integrity of the waldded joints of the plates.<br>
(iii)    The content of sulphur which has a deleterious effect on the mechanical properties of steel,  particularly on the ductility and toughness thereof is restricted to 0.01% through the secondary refining  treatment applied on the molten steel using a VAD plant.<br>
The cost effectiveness of the  process is increased by elimination of the  "normalising process" and by replacement of "V with Ti".    Elimination of the normalising treatment leads  to a saving of Rs.   500/- per ton   and replacement of V with Ti results in an additional saving of Rs.  250/- per ton.     The cost effectiveness is further increased by the use of plates of reduced thickness for the required mechanical properties thereof.<br>
