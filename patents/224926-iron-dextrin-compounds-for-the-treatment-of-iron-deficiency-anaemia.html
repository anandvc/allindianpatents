				<td>IRON DEXTRIN COMPOUNDS FOR THE TREATMENT OF IRON DEFICIENCY ANAEMIA<br>
The invention relates to novel iron dextrin compounds and to processes for the manufacture thereof. Further the invention relates to the use of the iron dextrin for the manufacture of pharmaceutical compositions for the treatment of iron deficiency anaemia in humans or domestic livestock.<br>
BACKGROUND FOR THE INVENTION<br>
Iron-deficiency anaemia has been described as one of the most common - possibly the most common -pathological conditions among humans when viewed on a global basis. Also in modern farm-breeding of pigs and other domestic animals iron-deficiency anaemia is a problem unless suitable prophylactic measures are taken.<br>
Although iron-deficiency anaemia can often be prevented or cured by oral administration of iron-containing preparations, it is in many cases preferred to use parenterally administrable iron preparations to avoid variations in bio availability of oral administrations and to ensure effective administration.<br>
Therefore, iron-containing preparations for parenteral use, that means subcutaneous, intramuscular or intravenous administration, have for many years been at the disposal of the veterinary or human medical practitioner.<br>
Although various iron-containing substances have been used or suggested as components in parenterally injectable preparations against iron-deficiency anaemia, the most common preparations accepted today are such which comprise a combined product of ferric oxy-hydroxide (or ferric hydroxide) in association with<br><br>
dextran. Dextran is a polymeric carbohydrate produced by the microorganisms Leuconostoc mesenteroides.<br>
Even though dextran in many ways is a desirable compound it has the disadvantages that it is metabolised only in a limited extend in the human body. Further dextran may give rise to anaphylactic reactions when administered parenterally.<br>
An iron-containing preparation for parenteral injection should obviously satisfy several requirements including ready availability of the iron for haemoglobin synthesis, absence of local or general side-effects and stability on storage enabling a satisfactory shelf-life at ambient temperature.<br>
Often it is desirable to administer an iron preparation orally because this is most convenient for the recipients. A frequent disadvantage encountered after administration of iron preparations orally is impaired digestion. Good iron preparations should provide iron to the body in the'gastro intestinal tract in a controlled way in order to provide sufficient iron to be assimilated through the intestinal epithelium and should not have an adverse influence on the digestion as such.<br>
GB 1,076,219 disclose a method for the manufacture of a complex containing iron, low molecular weight dextrin or dextran and sorbitol for the prophylaxis or treatment of iron deficiency anaemia.<br>
US 4,927,756 disclose a procedure for the manufacture of an iron dextran compound wherein the molecular weight of the dextrans is in the range of 2000-4000. It is further stated that dextran and saccharides having a molecular weight below 1000 Da decomposes in the reaction conditions leading to toxic products.<br>
WO 9900160 discloses iron dextrans consisting of dextrans having a weight average molecular weight of 700 to 1400 and number average molecular weight of 400 to 1400 Daltons in stable association with ferric oxyhydroxide. The disclosed iron dextrans complexes<br><br>
give rise to a reduced number of incidences of anaphylactic side effects.<br>
Additional iron preparations for the. treatment ' of iron deficiency anaemia are know such as iron-sucrose and iron-gluconate compounds. These compounds binds iron less tight with the consequence that the concentration of free Fe3+ ions are higher which increases the toxicity of the iron compounds when administered parenterally and may lead to disturbance of digestion when administered orally.<br>
It has been described that among the Banthu people the occurrence of iron-deficiency anaemia is very low and contrary incidences of iron overload are frequent. The iron is mainly supplied by the diet as a consequence of the traditional preparation of corn gruel diet in iron pots. Even though no direct evidence have been provided it is assumed that the iron is solubilized by the acid medium of the stomach, ' mixed with sugars from the hydrolysed dietary starch and then delivered into the small intestine where the bolus, rich in sugar and iron is neutralized to form soluble carbohydrate complexes of the iron. These soluble iron sugar complexes are readily transported and adsorbed by the intestinal tract with no mucosal block observed. (Spiro and Saltman. Polynuclear complexes of Iron and their biological Implications: Structure and bonding pp. 116-156) .<br>
Despite the above mentioned progress regarding the manufacture of iron products it is desirable to provide a iron compound useable for the preparation of compositions for the treatment or prophylaxis of iron deficiency anaemia, which iron compound does not provide the problems inherently connected with dex-trans-<br><br><br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
It is an object of .the pr.esent ■ invention ' to provide new iron preparations for the treatment of" iron deficiency anaemia, which preparations fulfil all the following requirements:<br>
-high availability of iron for adsorption in the intestine without causing problems with the digestion, when administered orally; -providing iron in a form that is readily adsorbed in the intestine;<br>
-high availability of iron without risk for toxicity caused by high local concentration of Fe3+, when administered parentarally; -not connected with anaphylactic reaction; -comprising a high amount of iron; -capable of forming stable solutions of said iron' preparation comprising a high amount of iron, which solutions fulfil the basal requirements for pharmaceutical compositions, i.e. can be sterilized, preferably by autoclaving, and which are stable during storage for a long period at ambient temperatures.<br>
The present inventors has surprisingly realised that all the above requirements are met by the iron dextrin compounds according to the invention.<br>
According to the present invention an iron(III)-dextrin compound is provided.<br>
The dextrin compound is prepared by hydrolysis of starch. Dextrins are saccharides composed of glucose<br>
units linked together predominantly by a-1,4-glucosidic bonds.<br>
Dextrins are usually made by depolymerisation of starch using known depolymerising means such as acids, bases or enzymes. Depending on the origin starch<br>
contains also few a-1,6-glucosidic bonds positioned at branch points of a polyglucose chain. Therefore dextrins may also contain a similar low fraction of<br><br>
a-1, 6-glucosidic bonds. By adjusting the conditions for the depolymerisation of the starch it may be ■possible to favour breakage of a-1,4-glucosidic bonds<br>
or a-1,6-glucosidic bonds so that the ratio between these types of bonds differs between the originating starch and the prepared dextrins.<br>
One of the characteristic properties of starch and dextrin is their gelling properties. In contrast to dextrans starch and higher dextrins gellify even at modest concentrations, which makes the handling more difficult.<br>
The gelling properties of starch and dextrins can be reduced by reducing the molecular weight by hydrolysis, however, the hydrolysis should not be to extensive as it is known that sugars and small dextrins may give rise to toxicity problems when combined with iron in an association complex.<br>
It is preferred that the starch is .hydrolysed until it does not form strong coloured complexes with iodine. Solutions of starch hydrolysed to that extend comprise high amounts of dextrins in the desired molecular size range, and has a viscosity that is sufficient low to allow the handling of the solutions to be easy and accurate.<br>
According to the invention the molecular weight of the starch is preferably performed as an acid hydrolysis, using a strong mineral acid such as sulphuric acid, phosphoric acid or hydrochloric acid. Hydrochloric acid is a preferred acid for the hydrolysis of starch.<br>
Further the inventors have realized that it is desirable to purify the dextrins to a narrow molecular weight distribution in order to obtain more uniform iron-dextrin complexes.<br>
Therefore it is an important feature of the invention that the dextrin is hydrolysed to a suitable low molecular weight, and is fractioned to a narrow range of molecular weights avoiding high molecular weight<br><br>
dextrins and low molecular saccharides.<br>
The weight average molecular weight (Mw) of the dextrins to be combined with iron according to the invention must be less than 3000 Dal tons and the number average molecular weight (Mn) must be higher that 400 Daltons.<br>
As the molecular weight of the dextrin must be narrow it is another important feature of the invention that the 10 % fraction of the dextrins having the highest molecular weight has an average molecular weight of less than 4500 Daltons, and that 90 % of the dextrins are having molecular weights of less than 3000 Daltons. It is further important that the 10 % fraction having the lowest molecular weight has a weight average molecular weight of 34 0 Daltons or more.<br>
In a preferred embodiment the 10% fraction of the dextrins having.the highest molecular weights has an average molecular weight less than 4000 Da, 90% of the dextrins having molecular weights of less than 3000 Daltons, and the 10 % fraction having the lowest molecular weights has a weight average molecular weight of 800 Daltons or more.<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly discovered that such a dextrin fraction has a sufficient low viscosity that allow easy and reliable handling of solut ions of the dextrin, and further that such a dextrin fraction provides association complexes with iron in a very uniform size.<br>
The fractionation may in principle be done using known procedures for fractionation of oligosaccharides that are suitable for fractioning to a narrow range of molecular weights. Such procedures include chromatographic purification, ion chromatographic methods and purifications using membrane separation technology, where purification by membrane processes is preferred. It is particular preferred that a membrane process using a membrane having a cut-off in the range of 340-800 Daltons is used for removing the<br><br>
low molecular weight saccharides.<br>
In contrast to the fractioning using membrane processes the traditionally used fractionation technique based on precipitations is not a suitable -fractionation technique for the present invention, presumably because the dextrin fraction obtained will not be sufficiently narrow. Consequently, iron dextrin compounds prepared using a dextrin fractioned by traditional precipitation will not possess the beneficial properties of the iron dextrin compounds according to the present invention.<br>
Before being combined with iron the reducing capability of the dextrins is removed. This may be done by hydrogenation of the terminal aldehyde groups of the dextrins to alcohols. This reduction may be performed using well known procedures. Hydrogenation using sodium borohydride is preferred.<br>
After the hydrogenation the reducing capability of the dextrins should be less than 3.0 %'determined using cupri oxidation method.<br>
The purified and hydrogenated dextrin as an aqueous solution is combined with at least one water soluble ferric salt; base is added to the resulting solution to form ferric hydroxide, and the resulting mixture is heated to transform the ferric hydroxide into ferric oxyhydroxide as an association compound with the dextrin.<br>
A preferred example of a water soluble ferric salt is ferrichloride.<br>
A preferred embodiment of the process comprises the following:<br>
(i) preparing an aqueous solution comprising the purified hydrogenated dextrin and at least one water-soluble ferric salt;<br>
(ii)    adjusting the pH of said aqueous solution to a value above 7 by addition of a base; (iii)  heating the mixture to a temperature above 85°C until it turns to a black or dark brown col-<br><br>
loidal solution which can be filtered through a 0.45 pm filter; and<br>
(iv) further purification and stabilization using filtration, heating and membrane processes and addition of one or more stabilizers, and optionally drying the solution to obtain the desired iron-dextrin compound as a stable powder.<br>
It is even more preferred that the pH of the aqueous solution in step (ii) is adjusted to a value above 8.5 by addition of a base.<br>
The stabilization suitably takes place by addition of a salt of an organic hydroxy acid, preferably a citrate.<br>
In one preferred aspect the invention relates to an iron dextrin compound being a water soluble powder comprising up to 50% (w/w) iron. Preferably the iron content of the powder is in the range of 10-50% (w/w), more preferred in the range of 20-45% (w/w) , and even more preferred in the range of 30-42% (w/w) .<br>
The present invention thus deals with iron-dextrin compounds having an extremely low frequency of non-desired side effects and being satisfactory stable, also during sterilization and storage as aqueous solutions, which iron-dextrin compound can be used as component in a pharmaceutical composition for prophylaxis or treatment of iron-deficiency in animal or human subjects by parenteral or oral administration, the iron-dextrin compound being characterized in that it comprises hydrogenated dextrin having a weight average molecular weight (Mw) less than 3, 000 Daltons, preferably approximately 1,000 Daltons, a number average molecular weight (Mn) equal to or higher than 40 0 Daltons in stable association with ferric oxyhy-droxide.<br>
Alternatively the drying operation is omitted, and an injection liquid is produced from the purified solution without intermediate drying thereof.<br><br>
In a further preferred embodiment the hydro-genation of the dextrin is performed by means of sodium borohydride in aqueous solution.<br>
The present inventors have surprisingly discovered that the iron dextrin compound according to the invention possess significant advantages compared with previously known iron dextrin compounds.<br>
First using the method according to the invention it is possible to prepare an iron dextrin having a very high iron content calculated as the ratio between iron and the total iron dextrin complex.<br>
Secondly, the iron dextrin compounds according to the invention are highly soluble in water, which make it possible to prepare aqueous solutions of the iron dextrins according to the invention containing very high amount of iron. These solutions are stable and do not deteriorate by storage such as by gellifi-cation or precipitation.<br>
Further solution of the iron dextrin compounds according to the invention can be sterilized by auto-claving without substantial physical changes of the solutions. Thus the solutions may be autoclaved without any significant change of the molecular weights of the complexes or the viscosity of the solution.<br>
Consequently, the iron dextrin compounds according to the invention provides the possibility of preparing pharmaceutical compositions comprising very high amounts of iron per mass unit, which composition fulfils all requirements for pharmaceutical' compositions such as being autoclavable and stable for a long period at ambient temperature.<br>
For example injection liquids comprising 2 0% iron may be prepared according to the invention. Such injection liquids comprising high amount of iron offers the advantage that a smaller amount of the liquid needs to be in j ected in the sub j ect being treated, which obviously is an advantage for the subject being treated as well for the person performing<br><br>
the treatment.<br>
Thus in a further aspect the invention provides .aqueous solutions comprising the iron dextrin compound according to the invention, wherein the iron content is up to 35%. Preferably the iron content is in the range of 1-3 5%, more preferred in the range of 5-3 5%, even more preferred in the range of 5-30%, and most preferred in the range of 10-25%. Aqueous solutions comprising 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 25 or 30% iron are also preferred embodiments of the invention.<br>
The aqueous solutions may be preserved using any recognized preserving techniques such as auto-claving, filtration through a 0.2-0.5 micron filter under sterile conditions or addition a preserving agent. As an example of preserving agents can be mentioned 0.5% phenol.<br>
Autoclaving is a preferred method for preserving the aqueous solutions according to the invention. Particular preferred is autoclaving at a- temperature of 121-135°C in a period of 5-40 minutes. If the pH of the aqueous solutions is below 7.5 it is preferred to autoclave the solution for a period of less than 40 minutes.<br>
In a further preferred embodiment said aqueous solutions are pharmaceutical compositions.<br>
The term Pharmaceutical compositions should in<br>
the present specification be understood broadly and<br>
comprises compositions for treating or preventing<br>
iron deficiency anaemia in a human individual or an<br>
'   animal, such as a domestic animal.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions comprising iron dextrin compounds according to the invention may be prepared using procedures that are well known for skilled person.<br>
In one embodiment injection liquids are prepared by providing an aqueous solution of iron dextrin according to the invention, dilution in a suited solvent if desired, adjustment of pH, sterilizing by<br><br>
filtration and filling into previous sterilized ampoules or vials.<br>
In another embodiment injection liquids are prepared ' by providing an aqueous solution of iron dextrin according to the invention, dilution in a suited solvent if desired, adjustment of pH, filling into previous sterilized ampoules or vials followed by sterilization by autoclaving of the filled ampoules or vials.<br>
One preferred embodiment of the invention provides an injection liquid intended for the administration in a human comprising 1-20% iron per mass unit of the injection liquid.<br>
Another preferred embodiment of the invention provides an injection liquid intended for the administration in an animal comprising 10-30% iron per mass unit of the injection liquid.<br>
Preparations for oral use may be produced using procedures well known for the person skilled in the art. As examples of preparations for oral use can be mentioned tablets, capsules, syrups, pastes and mixtures .<br>
Pharmaceutical preparations comprising the iron dextrin compound according to the invention may be formulated with additional nutritional or pharmaeuti-cal useful agents, such as vitamins, preferably wa-tersoluble vitamins, micro nutrients such as trace metals e.g. cobalt, copper, zinc or selenium, or antibiotics such as tylosin. Vitamins insoluble in water may even be emulsified into an aqueous solution comprising the iron dextrin compound according to the invention using a suitable emulsifier.<br>
The skilled person will appreciate the advantage that in contrast to dextrans no anaphylactic problems are connected to dextrins. This has the consequence that even if the removal of high molecular weight molecules is less efficient than intended, the<br><br>
risks for induction of adverse reactions in the recipients are minimized because dextrins in all molecular weights are safe and not prone to inducing any anaphylactic reactions.<br>
Surprisingly the iron dextrins according to the invention can bind an equal amount or more iron per weight unit of carbohydrate and be more soluble compared with iron dextrins according to the prior art. Further dextrins contain primary alcohol groups located at the 6-position of the sugar groups, where the protons of the primary alcohol groups may be removed under basic conditions. Without wishing to be bound by any theory it is assumed that the bonding properties of said primary alcohol groups is responsible for the fact that dextrins binds to iron differently that dextrans.<br>
Compared to previous known iron dextrin com-• pounds the iron dextrin compounds according to the invention are more soluble and have less tendency to gellify during manufacture and storage.<br>
When the iron dextrin compound according to the invention is administered orally in a pharmaceutical efficient dose, a satisfactory availability of iron for assimilation in the intestines is provided without any adverse effect on the digestion.<br>
The invention is now further illustrated by the following non-limiting examples.<br>
EXAMPLES<br>
Example 1<br>
Hydrolysis and hydrogenation of dextrin<br>
Gelatine forming dextrin of Mw &gt; 3 0 00 was hy-<br><br>
drolysed at pH 1.5 at a temperature of 95°C. The reaction was monitored by taking samples and analysing these chromatographically using gel permeation- chromatography.<br>
When the molecular weight of the dextrins had reached a desirable value i.e. weight average molecular weight less than 3 000 Da the hydrolysis was terminated, by cooling and neutralisation.<br>
By the hydrolysis low molecular weight dextrins and glucose is formed.<br>
The cool and neutralised dextrin solution was subjected to membrane purification processes having a .cut. off value of 340 - 800 Da in order to remove glucose and smaller dextrins formed during the hydrolysis , whereafter the content of dextrins was determined using a refractometer and the reducing sugars were determined using cupri oxidation.<br>
The reducing capability (RC) was decreased by treatment with sodium borohydride. After the sodium borohydride treatment the reducing capability was less than 3.0 %.<br>
Next the solution was neutralized to pH
