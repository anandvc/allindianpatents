				<td>GRAY GLASS COMPOSITION INTENDED FOR THE MANUFACTURE OF<br>
WINDOWS<br>
The invention relates to a glass composition of the soda-<br>
lime-silicate type intended for the production of flat glass<br>
of gray tint. Although .the invention is not limited to such<br>
an application, it will be more particularly described with<br>
reference to automobile applications, especially for forming<br>
windshields and side windows located at the front of a<br>
vehicle.<br>
Windows intended for the automobile industry are subject<br>
to requirements of various kinds. With regard to optical<br>
properties, these requirements are governed by regulations,<br>
for example in the case of the light transmission of a<br>
windshield, or else governed by concern for the comfort of<br>
the user, for example as regards energy transmission, or<br>
else for esthetic reasons, especially as regards color.<br>
Apart from the requirements relating to light<br>
transmission and to energy transmission, the windows located<br>
at the front of vehicles must satisfy the esthetic desires<br>
of automobile manufacturers as regards color, in particular<br>
relative to the dominant wavelength and to purity.<br>
Although coloring agents typical of giving such or such a<br>
color are generally known, it is difficult to find a<br>
particular color in terms of wavelength and purity, combined<br>
with specific characteristics, for example light<br>
transmission and energy transmission factors within a well-<br>
defined range of values.<br>
Thus to obtain a gray glass, it is known to add coloring<br>
agents to the batch materials intended to be melted in order<br>
to produce the glass matrix. These coloring agents are, for<br>
example iron, selenium, nickel, cobalt, cerium, or erbium,<br>
etc.<br>
Some of these agents, such as erbium, are expensive and<br>
for this reason are not employed or are added to the glass<br>
composition only in a very small amount.<br>
Others are deemed to be highly polluting and require the<br>
fitting of substantial filtration systems, which generates a<br>
high cost burden. This is especially the case with selenium,<br>
which is commonly employed for producing gray glass, but 70<br>
to 85% by weight of it is released into the atmosphere when<br>
it is melted. Consequently, the filtration systems specific<br>
to this element, with which melting plants are fitted so as<br>
to prevent pollution of the atmosphere, increase the<br>
production cost of such glass. Moreover, such glass is<br>
difficult to process because selenium has several oxidation<br>
states.<br>
Yet other coloring agents allow the desired color to be<br>
obtained only if their content in the glass composition is<br>
relatively high. Introducing a large amount of colorant<br>
containing nickel into the glass composition results in the<br>
formation of nickel sulfide beads within the glass. Window<br>
panes produced from such glass have a tendency to fracture<br>
when they are subjected thereafter to a thermal toughening<br>
treatment because of the presence of these beads.<br>
It is already known to produce gray-colored glass using a<br>
glass composition containing iron oxide, cobalt oxide and<br>
selenium. Such glass is, however, very dark and consequently<br>
does not meet the conditions required for front windows of a<br>
vehicle.<br>
Compositions have been proposed in EP-A-0 653 386 for<br>
obtaining gray glass that can be used for automobiles. These<br>
compositions are characterized in that they contain either a<br>
mixture of iron oxide, cobalt oxide and selenium, or a<br>
mixture of iron oxide, cobalt oxide and nickel oxide, and<br>
possibly selenium. The compositions comprising nickel oxide<br>
contain cobalt oxide in an amount at least equal to 20 ppm.<br>
Such glass obtained from compositions of the latter category<br>
has a light transmission factor (TLA) ranging from about 60%<br>
to about 72%, which meets the conditions required for use as<br>
a windshield and/or a front side window. However, windows<br>
having a TLA factor equal to or greater than 70% do not have<br>
a high energy transmission factor (TE) , this being at best<br>
equal to about 58%.<br>
The object of the present invention is to propose a gray<br>
glass composition of the soda-lime-silicate type that has an<br>
overall light transmission under illuminant A (TLa)<br>
compatible with use as a front window of an automobile, in<br>
particular a windshield, and a satisfactory overall energy<br>
transmission, and which can be sheeted on a bath of metal<br>
using the float glass technique.<br>
The subject of the present invention is a glass<br>
composition that allows a window having a relatively neutral<br>
gray coloration to be obtained.<br>
The subject of the present invention is also a glass<br>
composition that can be produced under the oxidation-<br>
reduction conditions usually observed for a standard float<br>
glass, and the cost of which is close to the cost of the<br>
latter.<br>
These objects are achieved according to the invention<br>
thanks to a gray glass composition of the soda-lime-silicate<br>
type having an overall light transmission under illuminant A<br>
(TLA) greater than 67% for a glass thickness equal to<br>
3.85 mm, which comprises the constituents below within the<br>
following limits by weight:<br>
SiO2 64 - 75%<br>
A12O3 0-5%<br>
B2O3 0-5%<br>
CaO 5 - 15%<br>
MgO 0-5%<br>
Na2O 10 - 18%<br>
and the coloring agents below within the following limits by<br>
weight:<br>
Fe2O3 0.25 - 0.65% and preferably 0.5 - 0.65%<br>
CoO less than 20 ppm, preferably less than or<br>
equal to 15 ppm and better still 5-15 ppm<br>
NiO 40 - 250 ppm and preferably 70 - 150 ppm<br>
Se 0-5 ppm<br>
where Fe2O3 is the total iron.<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the<br>
overall energy transmission (TE) is less than or equal to<br>
55%, preferably less than 50%, for a thickness of 3.85 mm.<br>
Such requirements correspond in particular to those required<br>
in the automobile field in order to provide for the thermal<br>
comfort of passengers in the passenger compartment.<br>
Also preferably, the glass composition has a dominant<br>
wavelength under illuminant D6s of between 480 and 550 nm,<br>
preferably between 490 and 510 nm, and an excitation purity<br>
under the same illuminant of less than 6%, preferably less<br>
than 5%, for a thickness of 3.85 mm. Such requirements<br>
correspond in particular to those required for the desired<br>
neutral coloration in the case of front side windows of<br>
automobiles. The glass obtained may have a tint ranging from<br>
gray-blue to gray-green depending on the dominant<br>
wavelength.<br>
Also preferably, the glass composition has a redox value<br>
of less than 0.55 and preferably less than 0.35, and better<br>
still greater than 0.18. The redox value is defined by the<br>
ratio of the FeO content to the total iron content,<br>
expressed in Fe2O3 form, the contents being expressed as<br>
percentages by weight.<br>
According to an advantageous embodiment of the invention,<br>
the composition contains no intentionally added selenium,<br>
except for the impurities that may be introduced by certain<br>
raw materials.<br>
According to another particularly advantageous embodiment<br>
of the invention, and especially for applications of the<br>
windshield and side window type for automobiles, the overall<br>
light transmission under illuminant A (TLfl) is greater than<br>
or equal to 69%, preferably greater than or equal to 70%,<br>
and the energy transmission is less than 50%, preferably<br>
less than 48%, for a thickness of 3.85 mm.<br>
In the glass according to the invention, the silica is<br>
generally maintained within very narrow limits for the<br>
following reasons: above about 75%, the viscosity of the<br>
glass and its ability to devitrify greatly increase, which<br>
makes it more difficult for the glass to melt and to flow on<br>
a bath of molten tin, while below 64% the hydrolytic<br>
resistance of the glass rapidly decreases.<br>
This reduction in the hydrolytic resistance of the glass<br>
may be compensated for, at least in part, by the<br>
introduction of A12O3, but this oxide contributes to<br>
increasing its viscosity and reducing the transmission in<br>
the visible. Consequently, it is envisioned to use it only<br>
in a very small amount.<br>
The alkali metal oxides Na2O and K2O facilitate<br>
melting of the glass. K2O may be used up to about 5%, since<br>
above this the problem of the high cost of the composition<br>
arises. The sum of the Na2O and K2O contents, expressed as<br>
percentages by weight, is preferably equal to or greater<br>
than 13%.<br>
Alkaline-earth metal oxides play a key role in obtaining<br>
the properties of the glass according to the invention.<br>
As regards the oxide MgO, according to a first embodiment<br>
of the invention, its content is advantageously greater than<br>
2%, especially for economic reasons.<br>
According to another embodiment, its content is less than<br>
2%. This is because it has been demonstrated that limiting<br>
the MgO content to 2% has the effect of shifting the maximum<br>
in the FeO absorption band toward longer wavelengths, thus<br>
making it possible to increase the infrared absorbtivity<br>
without impairing the transmission in the visible. Complete<br>
elimination of MgO, which plays an important role in the<br>
viscosity, may be compensated for, at least in part, by<br>
increasing the content of Na20 and/or SiO2.<br>
BaO makes it possible to increase the light transmission,<br>
and it may be added to the composition according to the<br>
invention with a content of less than 4%. This is because<br>
BaO has a much smaller effect than MgO and CaO on the<br>
viscosity of the glass. Within the context of the invention,<br>
the increase in BaO takes place essentially to the detriment<br>
of the alkali metal oxides, MgO and especially CaO. Any<br>
significant increase in BaO therefore contributes to<br>
increasing the viscosity of the glass, especially at low<br>
temperatures. In addition, introducing a high percentage of<br>
BaO substantially increases the cost of the composition.<br>
Preferably, the glass according to the invention contains no<br>
BaO. When it does contain BaO, its content is preferably<br>
between 0.5 and 3.5% by weight.<br>
Apart from complying with the limits defined above for<br>
the variation in the content of each alkaline-earth metal<br>
oxide, it is preferable in order to obtain the desired<br>
transmission properties to limit the sum of the percentages<br>
of MgO, CaO and BaO by weight to a value equal to or less<br>
than 14%.<br>
When it is desired to produce selective glasses (that is<br>
to say glasses capable of absorbing radiation within a<br>
desired wavelength range, for example corresponding to<br>
ultraviolet or infrared radiation, without appreciably<br>
affecting the light transmission), the glass compositions<br>
may furthermore include at least one optical absorption<br>
agent, such as CeO2, TiO2, Cr2O3, V2O5, W03, La2O3, etc. The<br>
total content of this (these) agent (s) is generally<br>
maintained at less than 2% by weight of the composition, and<br>
preferably less than 1%.<br>
The glass according to the invention may also contain up<br>
to 1% of other constituents provided by the impurities in<br>
the glass raw materials and/or by introducing recycled<br>
cullet into the glass batch and/or by using a refining agent<br>
(S03, Cl, Sb2O3, As2O3) .<br>
To facilitate melting, and especially to make this<br>
mechanically useful, the matrix advantageously has a<br>
temperature, corresponding to a viscosity T| such that log<br>
n = 2, which is less than 1500°C. More preferably,<br>
especially when it is desired to obtain the glass in the<br>
form of a glass ribbon using the float glass technique, the<br>
matrix has a temperature corresponding to the viscosity 11,<br>
expressed in poise, such that logn = 3.5 (denoted by<br>
Tlogn = 3.5) and a liquidus temperature (denoted by Taq) which<br>
satisfy the equation:<br>
Tlogn - 3.5 ~ Tliq &gt; 20 C,<br>
and preferably the equation:<br>
Tlogn) = 3.5 ~ Tliq &gt; 50 C.<br>
A better appreciation of the advantages of the present<br>
invention will be gained from the examples of glass<br>
compositions given below.<br>
In these examples, the values of the following<br>
properties, measured for a thickness of 3.85 mm, are<br>
indicated:<br>
• the overall light transmission factor under illuminant<br>
A (TLA) between 380 and 780 ran;<br>
• the overall energy transmission factor (TE) integrated<br>
between 29b and 2500 nm according to the ISO 9050 standard<br>
(Parry Moon, air mass 2);<br>
• the ultraviolet solar radiation transmission factor<br>
(Tov) calculated according to the ISO 9050 standard;<br>
• the dominant wavelength (Xd) under illuminant D6s; and<br>
• the excitation purity (Pd6s) under illuminant D65.<br>
The light transmission (TLa) / the dominant wavelength (X.d)<br>
and the purity (P) were calculated using the 1931 CIE ,<br>
(Commission Internationale de l'Eclairage) colorimetric<br>
reference observer.<br>
Each of the compositions given in the table was produced<br>
from the following glass matrix, the contents of which are<br>
expressed as percentages by weight, each being corrected in<br>
terms of silica in order to be adjusted to the total content<br>
of coloring agents added:<br>
SiO2 71.00%<br>
A12O3 0.70%<br>
CaO 8.90%<br>
MgO 3.80%<br>
Na2O 14.10%<br>
K2O 0.10%. -<br>
The temperatures Tlogn=2 and Tlogn=3.5, corresponding to the<br>
viscosities, expressed in poise, such that logn = 2 and<br>
logn = 3.5 respectively, together with the liquidus<br>
temperature Tliq are identical for all the glass compositions<br>
given (these being produced from the same glass matrix) and<br>
are the following:<br>
Tlogn=2 1410°C<br>
Tlogn,-3.5 1100°C<br>
Tliq 1060°C.<br>
The glasses of examples 1 to 5 are examples produced<br>
according to the invention, the compositions of which were<br>
measured, whereas the glasses of examples 6 to 18 are given<br>
with their theoretical compositions.<br>
Examples 1 to 18 according to the invention show that,<br>
within a wide range of coloring agents, it is possible to<br>
obtain neutral gray glass that meets the optical<br>
constraints, namely a high overall light transmission (TLA &gt;<br>
67%) and a relatively low energy transmission, at most equal<br>
to 55%. These good glass properties result to a large extent<br>
from the fact that the cobalt oxide content in the<br>
composition is less than 20 ppm. The examples also show that<br>
the target optical properties can be achieved without adding<br>
selenium, this being particularly advantageous as regards<br>
costs and the risk of polluting the environment.<br>
Any glass obtained from the compositions according to the<br>
invention is compatible with the usual techniques for<br>
manufacturing flat glass. The thickness of the glass ribbon<br>
obtained by sheeting out the molten glass on a bath of tin<br>
may be up to 20 mm, and in general this will vary between<br>
0.8 and 10 mm.<br>
Window glass (obtained by cutting the glass ribbon) may<br>
subsequently undergo a bending and/or enameling operation,<br>
especially when it is used for automobile windows.<br>
To produce windshields or side windows, the window glass<br>
is initially cut from a glass ribbon whose thickness<br>
generally varies between 3 and 5 millimeters. With these<br>
thicknesses, the glass ensures good thermal comfort. The<br>
windshields or side windows in question may be laminated, in<br>
which case they are formed from several glass sheets, at<br>
least one of which is obtained from the composition<br>
according to the invention.<br>
The windows falling within the scope of the present<br>
invention may be subjected beforehand to surface treatments<br>
or may receive, for example, an organic coating, such as a<br>
polyurethane-based film with antilacerating properties, or a<br>
film that provides sealing should a window shatter.<br>
These windows may also be coated with at least one metal<br>
oxide layer obtained by high-temperature chemical deposition<br>
using pyrolysis or chemical vapor deposition (CVD) or vacuum<br>
deposition techniques.<br>
