NOVEL CYCLIC UREA DERIVATIVES, PREPARATION THEREOF AND PHARMACEUTICAL USE OF THE SAME AS KINASE INHIBITORS<br>
The present invention relates to nbvel cyclic urea derivatives, to a process for preparing them, to their use as medicinal products, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to the pharmaceutical use of such derivatives for preventing and treating, complaints that may be modulated by inhibiting the activity of protein kinases.<br>
The present invention relates to novel cyclic urea derivatives that have inhibitory effects on protein kinases.<br>
The products of the present invention may thus be used especially for preventing or treating complaints capable of being modulated by inhibiting the activity of protein kinases.<br>
The inhibition and regulation of protein kinases especially constitute a powerful new mechanism of action for treating a large number of solid tumors.<br>
Such complaints that the products of the present patent application can treat are thus most particularly solid tumors.<br>
Such protein kinases belong especially to the following group: EGFR, Fak, FLK-1, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR5, flt-1, IGF-IR, KDR, PLK,PDGFR, tie2, VEGFR, AKT, Raf.<br>
The protein kinase IGF1-R (Insulin Growth Factor-1 Receptor) is particularly indicated.<br>
The protein kinase FAK is also indicated.<br>
The protein kinase AKT is also indicated.<br>
The present invention thus relates particularly to novel inhibitors of the IGF-IR receptor that may be used for oncology treatments.<br><br>
The present invention also relates to novel FAK receptor inhibitors that may be used for oncology treatments.<br>
The present invention also relates to novel AKT receptor inhibitors that may be used for oncology treatments.<br>
Cancer remains a disease for which the existing treatments are clearly insufficient. Certain protein kinases, especially including IGF-1R (Insulin Growth Factor 1 Receptor) , play an important role in many cancers. The inhibition of such protein kinases is potentially important in the chemotherapy of cancers, especially for suppressing the growth or survival of tumors. The present invention thus relates to the identification of novel products that inhibit such protein kinases.<br>
Protein kinases participate in signaling events that control the activation, growth and differentiation of cells in response either to extracellular mediators or to changes in the environment. In general, these kinases belong to two groups: those that preferentially phosphorylate serine and/or threonine residues and those that preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues [S.K. Hanks and T. Hunter, FASEB. J., 1995, 9, pages 576-596] . The serine/threonine kinases are, for example, the isoforms of the protein kinases C [A.C. Newton, J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, pages 28495-28498] and a group of cycline-dependent kinases, for instance cdc2 [J. Pines, Trends in Biochemical Sciences, 1995, 18, pages 195-197]. Tyrosine kinases comprise growth factor receptors, for instance the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor [S. Iwashita and M. Kobayashi, Cellular Signalling, 1992, 4, pages 12 3-132], and cytosol kinases, for instance p56tck, p59fYn and ZAP-70 and the kinases csk [C. Chan et. al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 1994, 12, pages 555-592].<br><br>
Abnormally high levels of kinase protein activity have been implicated in many diseases, resulting from abnormal cellular functions. This may arise either directly or indirectly from a dysfunction in the mechanisms for controlling the kinase activity, linked, for example, to a mutation, an overexpression or an inappropriate activation of the enzyme, or an over- or underproduction of cytokines or of growth factors, also involved in the transduction of the signals upstream or downstream of the kinases. In all these cases, a selective inhibition of the action of the kinases offers hope of a beneficial effect.<br>
The type 1 receptor for in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I-R) is a transmembrane receptor with tyrosine kinase activity which binds firstly to IGFI, but also to IGFI I and to insulin with lower affinity. The binding of IGFI to its receptor results in oligomerization of the receptor, the activation of tyrosine kinase, intermolecular autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of cell substrates (main substrates: IRS1 and She) . The receptor activated by its ligand induces mitogenic activity in normal cells. However, IGF-I-R plays an important role in "abnormal" growth.<br>
Several clinical reports underline the important role of the IGF-1 route in the development of human cancers:<br>
IGF-I-R is often found overexpressed in many types of tumor (breast, colon, lung, sarcoma, etc.) and its presence is often associated with a more aggressive phenotype.<br>
High concentrations of circulating IGFI are strongly correlated with a risk of prostate cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer.<br>
Furthermore, it has been widely documented that IGF-I-R is necessary for establishing and maintaining the transformed phenotype in vitro as in vivo  [Baserga R,<br><br>
Exp. Cell. Res., 1999, 253, pages 1-6]. The kinase activity of IGF-I-R is essential for the transformation activity of several oncogenes: EGFR, PDGFR, the large T antigen of the SV40 virus, activated Ras, Raf, and v-Src. The expression of IGF-I-R in normal fibroblasts induces a neoplastic phenotype, which may then result in the formation of a tumor in vivo. The expression of IGF-I-R plays an important role in substrate-independent growth. IGF-I-R has also been shown to be a protector in chemotherapy-induced and radiation-induced apoptosis, and cytokine-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the inhibition of endogenous IGF-I-R with a negative dominant, the formation of a triple helix or the expression of an antisense sequence brings about suppression of the transforming activity in vitro and reduction of tumor growth in animal models.<br>
Among the kinases for which a modulation of the activity is desired, FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase) is also a preferred kinase.<br>
FAK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays an<br>
important role in tranducing the signal transmitted by<br>
the integrins, a family of heterodimeric receptors of<br>
cellular adhesion. FAK and the integrins are colocalized<br>
in perimembrane structures known as adhesion plaques. It<br>
has been shown in many cell types that the activation of<br>
FAK and its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues and in<br>
particular its autophosphorylation on tyrosine 397 were<br>
lependent  on the binding of the  integrins  to their<br>
extracellular ligands and thus induced during cellular<br>
idhesion [Kornberg L, and al. J. Biol. Chem. 267(33) :<br>
13439-442  (1992)].  The autophosphorylation on tyrosine<br>
-97 of FAK represents a binding site for another tyrosine<br>
:inase, Src, via its SH2 domain [Schaller et al. Mol.<br>
'ell. Biol. 14 : 1680-1688 1994 ; Xing et al. Mol. Cell.<br>
iol. 5 : 413-421 1994] . Src can then phosphorylate FAK<br>
n tyrosine 925, thus recruiting the adapter protein Grb2<br><br>
and inducing in certain cells activation of the ras and MAP kinase pathway involved in controlling cellular proliferation [Schlaepfer et al. Nature ; 372 : 786-791 1994; Schlaepfer et al. Prog. Biophy. Mol. Biol. 71: 435-478 1999 ; Schlaepfer and Hunter, J. Biol. Chem. 272: 13189-13195 1997].<br>
The activation of FAK can thus induce the jun Nonterminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway and result in the progression of the cells to the Gl phase of the cellular cycle [Oktay et al., J. Cell. Biol.145: 1461-1469 1999]. Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3-kinase) also binds to FAK on tyros ine 3 97 and thi s interact ion might be necessary for the activation of PI3-kinase [Chen and Guan, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 91: 10148-10152 1994/ Ling et al. J. Cell. Biochem. 73: 533-544 1999]. The FAK/Src complex phosphorylates various substrates, for instance paxillin and pl3 0CAS in fibroblasts [Vuori et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 16: 2606-2613 1996].<br>
The results of numerous studies support the hypothesis that FAK inhibitors might be useful in treating cancer. Studies have suggested that FAK might play an important role in in vitro cell proliferation and/or survival. For example, in CHO cells, certain authors have demonstrated that the overexpression of pi 2 5 FAK induces an acceleration of the Gl to S transition, suggesting that pl25FAK promotes cellular proliferation [Zhao J.-H et al. J. Cell Biol. 143: 1997-2008 1998]. Other authors have shown that tumor cells treated with FAK antisense oligonucleotides lose their adhesion and go into apoptosis (Xu et al, Cell Growth Differ. 4: 413-418 1996) . It has also been demonstrated that FAK promotes the migration of cells in vitro. Thus, fibroblasts that are deficient for the expression of FAK ("knockout" mice for FAK) show a rounded morphology and deficiencies in cell migration in response to chimiotactic signals, and these defects are suppressed by<br><br>
reexpression of FAK [DJ. Sieg et al. , J. Cell Science. 112: 2677-91 1999] . The overexpression of the C-terminal domain of FAK (FRNK) blocks the stretching of adherent cells and reduces cellular migration in vitro [Richardson A. and Parsons J.T. Nature. 380: 538-540 1996], The overexpression of FAK in CHO or COS cells or in human astrocytoma cells promotes migration of the cells. The involvement of FAK in promoting the proliferation and migration of cells in numerous cell types in vitro suggests the potential role of FAK in neoplastic processes. A recent study has effectively demonstrated the increase in the proliferation of tumor cells in vivo after induction of the expression of FAK in human astrocytoma cells [Cary L.A. et al. J. Cell Sci. 109: 1787-94 1996; Wang D et al. J. Cell Sci. 113: 4221-4230 2000] . Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies on human biopsies have demonstrated that FAK is overexpressed in prostate cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, cancer of the colon, melanoma, brain cancer and lung cancer, the level of expression of FAK being directly correlated to the tumors having the most aggressive phenotype [Weiner TM, et al. Lancet. 342 (8878): 1024-1025 1993; Owens et al. Cancer Research. 55: 2752-2755 1995; Maung K. et al. Oncogene 18: 6824-6828 1999; Wang D et al. J. Cell Sci. 113: 4221-4230 2000].<br>
Protein kinase AKT (also known as PKB) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) are involved in a cell signaling pathway that transmits signals from growth factors activating membrane receptors.<br>
This transduction pathway is involved in numerous cellular functions: regulation of apoptosis, control of transcription and translation, glucose metabolism, angiogenesis and mitochondrial integrity. First identified as an important component of insulin-dependent signaling pathways regulating metabolic responses, serine/threonine kinase AKT was then identified as a<br><br>
mediator playing a key role in survival induced with growth factors. It has been shown that AKT can inhibit death by apoptosis induced by various stimuli, in a certain number of cell types and tumor cells. In accordance with these findings, it has been shown that AKT can, by phosphorylation of given serine residues, inactivate BAD, GSK3(3, caspase-9, and Forkhead transcription factor, and can activate IKKalpha and e-NOS. It is interesting to note that the protein BAD is found hyper-phosphorylated in 11 human tumor cell lines out of 41 studied. Furthermore, it has been shown that hypoxia modulates the induction of VEGF in cells transformed with Ha-ras by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and by involving the binding sequence of the HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible factor-1) transcription factor known as HRE for nhypoxy-responsive element".<br>
AKT plays a very important role in cancer pathologies. The amplification and/or overexpression of AKT has been reported in many human tumors, for instance gastric carcinoma (amplification of AKT1), ovary carcinoma, breast carcinoma or pancreatic carcinoma (amplification and overexpression of AKT2) and breast carcinomas deficient in estrogen receptors, and also androgen-independent prostate carcinomas (overexpression of AKT3). Furthermore, AKT is constitutively activated in all the PTEN (-/-) tumors, the PTEN phosphatase being deleted or inactivated by mutations in many types of tumors, for instance carcinomas of the ovary, of the prostate, of the endometrium, glioblastomas and melanomas. AKT is also involved in the oncogenic activation of bcr-abl (references: Khawaja A. , Nature 1999, 401, 33-34; Cardone et al.

The products of formula (I) of the present patent application as defined above, for which p represents the integer 0 and which thus constitute hydantoin derivatives, may be synthesized according to the process indicated above and especially according to the general scheme below which describes this synthesis on a solid support. The protocol that follows this scheme gives the operating conditions for such a synthesis on solid support of the products of formula (I) of the present patent application.<br>
The experimental section below more particularly gives an illustration of such a synthesis on a solid support according to the above protocol with the preparation of Examples 1 to 56 of the present patent application.<br>
Such a synthesis may be performed according to the general protocol below.<br>
Rink resin, protected with an Fmoc group, is deprotected with a 20% solution of piperidine in DMF. The resulting amine resin is coupled with an amino acid protected with an Fmoc group, in the presence of iiisopropylaminecarbodiimide (DIC) and hydroxybenzo-:riazole (HOBt). The supported N-Fmoc amino acid is then ieprotected with a 20% solution of piperidine in DMF. The free amine is reacted with an aldehyde dissolved in a 50/5 0 mixture of THF and triethyl orthoformate (TEOF) to jive a Schiff's base, which is reduced with sodium :yanoborohydride. The resulting amine is coupled with an .socyanate or an isothiocyanate to give the corresponding irea or thiourea. When the isocyanate is not commercially ivailable,  it may be prepared from the corresponding<br><br>
amine by reaction with 1/3 equivalent of triphosgene in the presence of 2 equivalents of pyridine. The product is then cleaved with a 95% trifluoroacetic acid/water mixture. The urea thus released cyclizes to give the expected hydantoinine. In certain cases, the cleavage solution must be heated to 80 °C to obtain complete cyclization.<br>
The products of formula (I) of the present patent application as defined above, for which p represents the integer 1 and which thus constitute dihydrouracil derivatives, may be synthesized according to the process indicated above and especially according to the general scheme below which describes this synthesis on a solid support. The protocol that follows this scheme gives the operating conditions for such a synthesis of the products of formula (I) of the present patent application on a solid support.<br>
The experimental section below more particularly gives an illustration of such a synthesis on a solid support according to the above protocol with the preparation of Example 5 of the present patent application.<br>
For the synthesis of the dihydrouracils on a solid support, the protocol that follows may be used.<br>
Wang polystyrene resin (1.7 mmol/g) is used, for example, which resin is treated with a mixture of p-amino acid, 2,6-dichlorobenzoyl chloride and pyridine in DMF. After washing the resin is treated with a 10% solution of piperidine in DMF. The resulting free amine is reacted with an aldehyde in a mixture of THF/trimethyl orthoformate (TMOF). The resulting Schiff's base is reduced with sodium cyanoborohydride in a mixture of methanol, THF and acetic acid. The secondary amine obtained is acylated with phosgene and the resulting carbomoyl chloride is treated with a primary amine to give  the  corresponding  urea.  Cyclization  to  the<br><br>
dihydrouracil and cleavage of the final product are performed by treating with a strong base such as diazabicycloundecene (DBU).<br>
The products of formula (I) of the present patent application may thus be synthesized on a solid support as described above or in liquid phase according to the process indicated below: the experimental section of the present patent application gives an illustration of such a liquid-phase synthesis with the preparation of Examples 57 to 62.<br>
For this liquid-phase synthetic process, two routes A and B may be performed, each involving two steps. Route A:<br>
step a: the alkylation of the amino ester may be performed by reductive amination with an aromatic or heterocyclic aldehyde according to the general process described in Advanced Organic Reaction, March, third edition, page 798-800. In particular, the formation of the Schiff's base (intermediate) may be performed using an amino ester optionally in salt form, an aldehyde and optionally a dehydrating agent (for example magnesium sulfate) in a solvent, for instance dichloromethane or dichloroethane, at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux point of the solvent. The imine formed may be isolated. The imine formed is reduced with a metal hydride, for instance sodium borohydride, in a solvent, for instance an alcohol (for example ethanol or methanol), at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux point of the solvent.<br>
step b: the amino ester obtained is coupled with an isocyanate in a solvent, for instance THF or dichloromethane, with or without the presence of a base (for example triethylamine) or an acid (for example trifluoroacetic acid), at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux point of the solvent. When the isocyanates are not commercially available, they are prepared from<br><br>
the corresponding amines and triphosgene or diphosgene or phosgene in the presence of a base (for example pyridine or triethylamine) according to the general procedure described in Advanced Organic Reaction, March, third edition, page 370. Route B:<br>
step a: the formation of the isocyanate may be performed by coupling an aromatic or heterocyclic amine with diphosgene in the presence of activated plant charcoal, in a solvent, for instance toluene, at a temperature of between -40°C and the reflux point of the solvent. The isocyanate formed is not isolated, and may react with the amino ester or its salt in the same solvent in the presence of a base, for instance triethylamine, at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux point of the solvent, to give the 3-arylimidazolidine-2,4-dione derivative.<br>
step b: the coupling of this derivative with an alkyl halide is performed in the presence of a base, for instance potassium tert-butoxide or sodium hydride, in a solvent, for instance THF or DMF, at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux point of the solvent. The products of formula (I) of the present patent application that constitute examples 201 to 2 07 of the present patent application were prepared as indicated below in the experimental section and as indicated in the schemes that follow: in these schemes, example I represents example 201, example II represents example 202, example III represents example 203, example IV represents example 204, example V represents example 205, example VI represents example 206 and example VII represents example 207.<br><br><br><br><br>
The synthesis of the products of formula (I) of the present patent application that constitute the products of examples 208 to 243 was performed using route B. The alkyl halide may be prepared from the corresponding carboxylic acids.<br><br><br>
The ethyl carboxylates were prepared by esterification of the carboxylic acids in ethanol in the presence of sulfuric acid, repeating the conditions described in Synthesis 2000, 1138.<br>
The reduction of the ethyl carboxylates to alcohol was performed in ethanol in the presence of sodium borohydride, repeating the conditions described in Synthesis 2000, 1665.<br>
The conversion of the alcohols thus obtained into alkyl halides was performed using dibromotriphenylphosphorane as halogenating agent, repeating the conditions described in J. Heterocyclic Chem., 30, 631 (1993).<br><br><br>
The alkyl halides may also be prepared by f ree-radical bromination of the corresponding methylenes in the presence of N-bromosuccinimide and benzoyl peroxide in carbon tetrachloride, repeating the conditions described in J. Heterocyclic Chem., 30, 631 (1993).<br>
Thus, we functionalized the pyridine nucleus in position 2 with a bromine or fluorine atom or alternatively with a nitrile group.<br>
The latter compound will also allow us to prepare various carbonyl compounds.<br><br><br>
The acidic hydrolysis of the nitrile in the presence of sulfuric acid, repeating the conditions described in J. Med. Chem. 1991, 34, 281-290, led to the carboxamide in dimeric form. Hydrolysis of the nitrile under milder conditions allowed us to obtain the expected carboxamide.<br>
Acidic hydrolysis of the nitrile in the presence of 5N hydrochloric acid, repeating the conditions described in J. Heterocyclic Chem. , 30, 631 (1993) , led to the corresponding carboxylic acid.<br>
The amide may be prepared from the carboxylic acid using       1- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride  as  coupling  agent  in  dichloromethane, repeating the conditions described in J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 95, 875, (1973) .<br><br>
Various amine analogs were obtained by nucleophilic substitution of the chlorointermediate with amines under irradiation in a microwave oven, based on the conditions described in Tetrahedron 2002, 58, 1125.<br><br>
The amino analog was obtained by deprotection of the p-methoxybenzylamine group in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid, based on the conditions described in J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1, 2002, 428-433.<br>
This amino derivative allowed access to other chemical functions, for instance the amide function, the carbamate function or the sulfonamide function.<br><br><br>
The acetamido derivative was obtained by acylation of the amine derivative in the presence of acetic anhydride, based on the conditions described in Tetrahedron Lett. 2002, 43, 3121. We also prepared the methyl and tert-butyl carbamates on the basis of the conditions described in J. Heterocyclic Chem., 22, 313 (1985) and in J. Org. Chem. 2002, 67, 4965. The amine derivative was also sulfonylated with mesyl chloride, based on the conditions described in J. Med. Chem., 1985, 28, 824.<br><br><br>
The above conditions were also used for the synthesis of compounds containing a disubstituted phenyl group.<br>
The hydantoin containing a pyridine nucleus disubstituted in position -2,6 with a bromine atom was prepared using the above conditions, starting with 2,6-dibromo-4-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine described in Synthesis 2000, 1665.<br><br><br>
The products may be purified as follows:<br>
Purification by LC/MS<br>
The products may be purified by LC/MS using a Waters FractionLynx system composed of a Waters model 600 gradient pump, a Waters model 515 regeneration pump, a Waters Reagent Manager dilution pump, a Waters model 2700 autoinjector, two Rheodyne model LabPro valves, a Waters model 996 diode array detector, a Waters model ZMD mass spectrometer and a Gilson model 2 04 fraction collector. The system was controlled by the Waters FractionLynx software. The separation was performed alternatively on two Waters Symmetry columns (C1Q, 5 /xM, 19x50 mm, catalog reference 186000210), one column undergoing regeneration with a 95/5 (v/v) water/acetonitrile mixture containing 0.07% (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid, while the other column was being used for separation. The elution of the columns was performed using a linear gradient of from 5% to 95% of acetonitrile containing 0.07% (v/v) of trif luoroacetic acid in water, at a flow rate of 10 mL/min. At the outlet of the separation column, a thousandth of the effluent is separated with an LC Packing Accurate, diluted with methyl alcohol at a flow<br><br>
rate of 0.5 mL/min and conveyed to the detectors, in a proportion of 75% to the diode array detector, and the remaining 25% to the mass spectrometer. The rest of the effluent (999/1000) is conveyed to the fraction collector, where the flow is discarded as long as the mass of the expected product is not detected by the FractionLynx software. The molecular formulae of the expected products are supplied to the FractionLynx software, which triggers the collection of the product when the detected mass signal corresponds to the ion [M+H]+ and/or to the [M+Na]+. In certain cases, depending on the analytical LC/MS results, when a strong ion corresponding to [M+2H]++ was detected, the value corresponding to half of the calculated molecular mass (MW/2) is also supplied to the FractionLynx software. Under these conditions, the collection is also triggered when the signal for the mass of the ion [M+2H]++ and/or [M+Na+H]++ is detected. The products were collected in tared glass tubes. After collection, the solvents were evaporated of f, in a Savant AES 2 00 0 or Genevac HT8 centrifugal evaporator and the product masses were determined by weighing the tubes after evaporation of the solvents.<br>
The LC/MS analyses were performed on a Micromass model LCT machine connected to an HP 1100 machine. The abundance of the products was measured using an HP G1315A diode array detector over a 200-600 nm wavelength range and a Sedex 65 light scattering detector. The mass spectra were acquired over a range from 180 to 800. The data were analyzed using the Micromass MassLynx software. The separation was performed on a Hypersil BDS CI8, 3 /zm column (50 x 4.6 mm) , eluting with a linear gradient of from 5% to 90% of acetonitrile containing 0.05% (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water containing 0.05% (v/v) of TFA, over 3.5 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.<br><br>
The  total  analysis  time,  including  the  column  re-equilibration time, is 7 minutes.<br>

2 g (1.02 mmol) of Polystyrene AM RAM (Rink resin) (0.51 mmol/g) are suspended in 20 ml of DMF in a 50 ml syringe fitted with a sinter. After agitation for 10 minutes, the DMF is filtered and replaced with 10 ml of a 2 0% solution of piperidine in DMF. After agitation for one hour at room temperature, the solution is filtered and the resin washed successively with 3 x 10 ml of DMF, 2 x 10 ml of methanol and 3 x 10 ml of DMF.

The syringe is agitated overnight at room temperature and the resin is then washed successively with 5 x 10 ml of DMF, 3 x 10 ml of MeOH and 5 x 10 ml of DCM. Next, 10 ml of a 20% solution of piperidine in DMF are introduced into the syringe. After agitation for 1 hour, the solution is filtered and the resin washed with 5 x 10 ml of DMF, 2 x 10 ml of MeOH, 3 x 10 ml of DCM and 3 x 10 ml of THF. Next, a solution of 0.79 g of quinoline-4-carboxaldehyde (5.1 mmol) in 10 ml of a 50/50 THF/TEOF mixture is added to the resin. After agitation overnight at room temperature, the solution is filtered and the resin washed with 10 x 10 ml of THF. 0.63 g of sodium cyanoborohydride in a mixture of 1.5 ml of MeOH, 3.5 ml of dichloroethane and 0.1 ml of acetic acid is then added to the resin.

In parallel, a solution of 0.563 g of 4-(trifluoro-methanesulfonyl)aniline (2.5 mmol) is treated with 0.25 g of  triphosgene  (0.83  mmol),  followed by  0.23 ml  of<br><br>
pyridine (2.5 mmol) at 0°C under nitrogen. After the temperature has warmed gradually to room temperature, the reaction is stirred for 2 hours and a further 0.23 ml of pyridine in 1 ml of DMF is added to the mixture. The solution obtained is transferred into the syringe, which is agitated for 2 hours. The solution is then filtered and the resin washed with 5 x 10 ml of DCM, 3 x 10 ml of MeOH and 5 x 10 ml of DCM. Finally, the resin is treated with 5 ml of a 95% solution of trif luoroacetic acid in water. The mixture is agitated for 2 hours and then filtered. The resin is washed with 2 ml of MeOH, followed by 2 ml of DCM. The combined filtrates are evaporated under vacuum. 2 80 mg of crude product are thus obtained.

NOVEL CYCLIC UREA DERIVATIVES, PREPARATION THEREOF AND PHARMACEUTICAL USE OF THE SAME AS KINASE INHIBITORS<br>
The present invention relates to nbvel cyclic urea derivatives, to a process for preparing them, to their use as medicinal products, to pharmaceutical compositions containing them and to the pharmaceutical use of such derivatives for preventing and treating, complaints that may be modulated by inhibiting the activity of protein kinases.<br>
The present invention relates to novel cyclic urea derivatives that have inhibitory effects on protein kinases.<br>
The products of the present invention may thus be used especially for preventing or treating complaints capable of being modulated by inhibiting the activity of protein kinases.<br>
The inhibition and regulation of protein kinases especially constitute a powerful new mechanism of action for treating a large number of solid tumors.<br>
Such complaints that the products of the present patent application can treat are thus most particularly solid tumors.<br>
Such protein kinases belong especially to the following group: EGFR, Fak, FLK-1, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3, FGFR4, FGFR5, flt-1, IGF-IR, KDR, PLK,PDGFR, tie2, VEGFR, AKT, Raf.<br>
The protein kinase IGF1-R (Insulin Growth Factor-1 Receptor) is particularly indicated.<br>
The protein kinase FAK is also indicated.<br>
The protein kinase AKT is also indicated.<br>
The present invention thus relates particularly to novel inhibitors of the IGF-IR receptor that may be used for oncology treatments.<br><br>
The present invention also relates to novel FAK receptor inhibitors that may be used for oncology treatments.<br>
The present invention also relates to novel AKT receptor inhibitors that may be used for oncology treatments.<br>
Cancer remains a disease for which the existing treatments are clearly insufficient. Certain protein kinases, especially including IGF-1R (Insulin Growth Factor 1 Receptor) , play an important role in many cancers. The inhibition of such protein kinases is potentially important in the chemotherapy of cancers, especially for suppressing the growth or survival of tumors. The present invention thus relates to the identification of novel products that inhibit such protein kinases.<br>
Protein kinases participate in signaling events that control the activation, growth and differentiation of cells in response either to extracellular mediators or to changes in the environment. In general, these kinases belong to two groups: those that preferentially phosphorylate serine and/or threonine residues and those that preferentially phosphorylate tyrosine residues [S.K. Hanks and T. Hunter, FASEB. J., 1995, 9, pages 576-596] . The serine/threonine kinases are, for example, the isoforms of the protein kinases C [A.C. Newton, J. Biol. Chem., 1995, 270, pages 28495-28498] and a group of cycline-dependent kinases, for instance cdc2 [J. Pines, Trends in Biochemical Sciences, 1995, 18, pages 195-197]. Tyrosine kinases comprise growth factor receptors, for instance the epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor [S. Iwashita and M. Kobayashi, Cellular Signalling, 1992, 4, pages 12 3-132], and cytosol kinases, for instance p56tck, p59fYn and ZAP-70 and the kinases csk [C. Chan et. al., Ann. Rev. Immunol., 1994, 12, pages 555-592].<br><br>
Abnormally high levels of kinase protein activity have been implicated in many diseases, resulting from abnormal cellular functions. This may arise either directly or indirectly from a dysfunction in the mechanisms for controlling the kinase activity, linked, for example, to a mutation, an overexpression or an inappropriate activation of the enzyme, or an over- or underproduction of cytokines or of growth factors, also involved in the transduction of the signals upstream or downstream of the kinases. In all these cases, a selective inhibition of the action of the kinases offers hope of a beneficial effect.<br>
The type 1 receptor for in the insulin-like growth factor (IGF-I-R) is a transmembrane receptor with tyrosine kinase activity which binds firstly to IGFI, but also to IGFI I and to insulin with lower affinity. The binding of IGFI to its receptor results in oligomerization of the receptor, the activation of tyrosine kinase, intermolecular autophosphorylation and the phosphorylation of cell substrates (main substrates: IRS1 and She) . The receptor activated by its ligand induces mitogenic activity in normal cells. However, IGF-I-R plays an important role in "abnormal" growth.<br>
Several clinical reports underline the important role of the IGF-1 route in the development of human cancers:<br>
IGF-I-R is often found overexpressed in many types of tumor (breast, colon, lung, sarcoma, etc.) and its presence is often associated with a more aggressive phenotype.<br>
High concentrations of circulating IGFI are strongly correlated with a risk of prostate cancer, lung cancer and breast cancer.<br>
Furthermore, it has been widely documented that IGF-I-R is necessary for establishing and maintaining the transformed phenotype in vitro as in vivo  [Baserga R,<br><br>
Exp. Cell. Res., 1999, 253, pages 1-6]. The kinase activity of IGF-I-R is essential for the transformation activity of several oncogenes: EGFR, PDGFR, the large T antigen of the SV40 virus, activated Ras, Raf, and v-Src. The expression of IGF-I-R in normal fibroblasts induces a neoplastic phenotype, which may then result in the formation of a tumor in vivo. The expression of IGF-I-R plays an important role in substrate-independent growth. IGF-I-R has also been shown to be a protector in chemotherapy-induced and radiation-induced apoptosis, and cytokine-induced apoptosis. Furthermore, the inhibition of endogenous IGF-I-R with a negative dominant, the formation of a triple helix or the expression of an antisense sequence brings about suppression of the transforming activity in vitro and reduction of tumor growth in animal models.<br>
Among the kinases for which a modulation of the activity is desired, FAK (Focal Adhesion Kinase) is also a preferred kinase.<br>
FAK is a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that plays an<br>
important role in tranducing the signal transmitted by<br>
the integrins, a family of heterodimeric receptors of<br>
cellular adhesion. FAK and the integrins are colocalized<br>
in perimembrane structures known as adhesion plaques. It<br>
has been shown in many cell types that the activation of<br>
FAK and its phosphorylation on tyrosine residues and in<br>
particular its autophosphorylation on tyrosine 397 were<br>
lependent  on the binding of the  integrins  to their<br>
extracellular ligands and thus induced during cellular<br>
idhesion [Kornberg L, and al. J. Biol. Chem. 267(33) :<br>
13439-442  (1992)].  The autophosphorylation on tyrosine<br>
-97 of FAK represents a binding site for another tyrosine<br>
:inase, Src, via its SH2 domain [Schaller et al. Mol.<br>
'ell. Biol. 14 : 1680-1688 1994 ; Xing et al. Mol. Cell.<br>
iol. 5 : 413-421 1994] . Src can then phosphorylate FAK<br>
n tyrosine 925, thus recruiting the adapter protein Grb2<br><br>
and inducing in certain cells activation of the ras and MAP kinase pathway involved in controlling cellular proliferation [Schlaepfer et al. Nature ; 372 : 786-791 1994; Schlaepfer et al. Prog. Biophy. Mol. Biol. 71: 435-478 1999 ; Schlaepfer and Hunter, J. Biol. Chem. 272: 13189-13195 1997].<br>
The activation of FAK can thus induce the jun Nonterminal kinase (JNK) signaling pathway and result in the progression of the cells to the Gl phase of the cellular cycle [Oktay et al., J. Cell. Biol.145: 1461-1469 1999]. Phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase (PI3-kinase) also binds to FAK on tyros ine 3 97 and thi s interact ion might be necessary for the activation of PI3-kinase [Chen and Guan, Proc. Nat. Acad. Sci. USA. 91: 10148-10152 1994/ Ling et al. J. Cell. Biochem. 73: 533-544 1999]. The FAK/Src complex phosphorylates various substrates, for instance paxillin and pl3 0CAS in fibroblasts [Vuori et al. Mol. Cell. Biol. 16: 2606-2613 1996].<br>
The results of numerous studies support the hypothesis that FAK inhibitors might be useful in treating cancer. Studies have suggested that FAK might play an important role in in vitro cell proliferation and/or survival. For example, in CHO cells, certain authors have demonstrated that the overexpression of pi 2 5 FAK induces an acceleration of the Gl to S transition, suggesting that pl25FAK promotes cellular proliferation [Zhao J.-H et al. J. Cell Biol. 143: 1997-2008 1998]. Other authors have shown that tumor cells treated with FAK antisense oligonucleotides lose their adhesion and go into apoptosis (Xu et al, Cell Growth Differ. 4: 413-418 1996) . It has also been demonstrated that FAK promotes the migration of cells in vitro. Thus, fibroblasts that are deficient for the expression of FAK ("knockout" mice for FAK) show a rounded morphology and deficiencies in cell migration in response to chimiotactic signals, and these defects are suppressed by<br><br>
reexpression of FAK [DJ. Sieg et al. , J. Cell Science. 112: 2677-91 1999] . The overexpression of the C-terminal domain of FAK (FRNK) blocks the stretching of adherent cells and reduces cellular migration in vitro [Richardson A. and Parsons J.T. Nature. 380: 538-540 1996], The overexpression of FAK in CHO or COS cells or in human astrocytoma cells promotes migration of the cells. The involvement of FAK in promoting the proliferation and migration of cells in numerous cell types in vitro suggests the potential role of FAK in neoplastic processes. A recent study has effectively demonstrated the increase in the proliferation of tumor cells in vivo after induction of the expression of FAK in human astrocytoma cells [Cary L.A. et al. J. Cell Sci. 109: 1787-94 1996; Wang D et al. J. Cell Sci. 113: 4221-4230 2000] . Furthermore, immunohistochemical studies on human biopsies have demonstrated that FAK is overexpressed in prostate cancer, breast cancer, thyroid cancer, cancer of the colon, melanoma, brain cancer and lung cancer, the level of expression of FAK being directly correlated to the tumors having the most aggressive phenotype [Weiner TM, et al. Lancet. 342 (8878): 1024-1025 1993; Owens et al. Cancer Research. 55: 2752-2755 1995; Maung K. et al. Oncogene 18: 6824-6828 1999; Wang D et al. J. Cell Sci. 113: 4221-4230 2000].<br>
Protein kinase AKT (also known as PKB) and phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K) are involved in a cell signaling pathway that transmits signals from growth factors activating membrane receptors.<br>
This transduction pathway is involved in numerous cellular functions: regulation of apoptosis, control of transcription and translation, glucose metabolism, angiogenesis and mitochondrial integrity. First identified as an important component of insulin-dependent signaling pathways regulating metabolic responses, serine/threonine kinase AKT was then identified as a<br><br>
mediator playing a key role in survival induced with growth factors. It has been shown that AKT can inhibit death by apoptosis induced by various stimuli, in a certain number of cell types and tumor cells. In accordance with these findings, it has been shown that AKT can, by phosphorylation of given serine residues, inactivate BAD, GSK3(3, caspase-9, and Forkhead transcription factor, and can activate IKKalpha and e-NOS. It is interesting to note that the protein BAD is found hyper-phosphorylated in 11 human tumor cell lines out of 41 studied. Furthermore, it has been shown that hypoxia modulates the induction of VEGF in cells transformed with Ha-ras by activating the PI3K/AKT pathway and by involving the binding sequence of the HIF-1 (hypoxia inducible factor-1) transcription factor known as HRE for nhypoxy-responsive element".<br>
AKT plays a very important role in cancer pathologies. The amplification and/or overexpression of AKT has been reported in many human tumors, for instance gastric carcinoma (amplification of AKT1), ovary carcinoma, breast carcinoma or pancreatic carcinoma (amplification and overexpression of AKT2) and breast carcinomas deficient in estrogen receptors, and also androgen-independent prostate carcinomas (overexpression of AKT3). Furthermore, AKT is constitutively activated in all the PTEN (-/-) tumors, the PTEN phosphatase being deleted or inactivated by mutations in many types of tumors, for instance carcinomas of the ovary, of the prostate, of the endometrium, glioblastomas and melanomas. AKT is also involved in the oncogenic activation of bcr-abl (references: Khawaja A. , Nature 1999, 401, 33-34; Cardone et al.

A list of such ester radicals may be found, for example, in European patent EP 0 034 536.<br>
The term "amidated carboxyl" means radicals of the type -CONR5R6 as defined above: also intended are the radicals NCOR6R7 in which the radicals R6 and R7, which may be identical or different, represent a hydrogen atom or an alkyl radical containing from 1 to 4 carbon atoms such as methyl, ethyl, propyl, isopropyl, butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl or tert-butyl radicals and especially amino, alkylamino and dialkylamino radicals.<br><br>
The term "alkylamino radical" means linear or branched methylamino, ethylamino, propylamino or butylamino radicals. Alkyl radicals containing not more than 4 carbon atoms are preferred, the alkyl radicals possibly being chosen from the alkyl radicals mentioned above.<br>
The term Mialkylamino radical" means, for example, dimethylamino, diethylamino and methylthylamino radicals. As previously, alkyl radicals containing not more than 4 carbon atoms, chosen from the list indicated above, are preferred.<br>

It may be recalled that stereoisomerism may be defined in its broad sense as the isomerism of compounds having the same structural formulae but whose various groups are arranged differently in space, especially such as in monosubstituted cyclohexanes whose substituent may be in an axial or equatorial position, and the various possible rotational conformations of ethane derivatives. However, there is another type of stereoisomerism, due to the different spatial arrangements of fixed substituents, either on double bonds or on rings, which is often referred to as geometrical isomerism or cis-trans isomerism. The term "stereoisomer" is used in the present patent application in its broadest sense and thus relates to all the compounds indicated above.<br>

The products of formula (I) of the present patent application as defined above, for which p represents the integer 0 and which thus constitute hydantoin derivatives, may be synthesized according to the process indicated above and especially according to the general scheme below which describes this synthesis on a solid support. The protocol that follows this scheme gives the operating conditions for such a synthesis on solid support of the products of formula (I) of the present patent application.<br>
The experimental section below more particularly gives an illustration of such a synthesis on a solid support according to the above protocol with the preparation of Examples 1 to 56 of the present patent application.<br>
Such a synthesis may be performed according to the general protocol below.<br>
Rink resin, protected with an Fmoc group, is deprotected with a 20% solution of piperidine in DMF. The resulting amine resin is coupled with an amino acid protected with an Fmoc group, in the presence of iiisopropylaminecarbodiimide (DIC) and hydroxybenzo-:riazole (HOBt). The supported N-Fmoc amino acid is then ieprotected with a 20% solution of piperidine in DMF. The free amine is reacted with an aldehyde dissolved in a 50/5 0 mixture of THF and triethyl orthoformate (TEOF) to jive a Schiff's base, which is reduced with sodium :yanoborohydride. The resulting amine is coupled with an .socyanate or an isothiocyanate to give the corresponding irea or thiourea. When the isocyanate is not commercially ivailable,  it may be prepared from the corresponding<br><br>
amine by reaction with 1/3 equivalent of triphosgene in the presence of 2 equivalents of pyridine. The product is then cleaved with a 95% trifluoroacetic acid/water mixture. The urea thus released cyclizes to give the expected hydantoinine. In certain cases, the cleavage solution must be heated to 80 °C to obtain complete cyclization.<br>
The products of formula (I) of the present patent application as defined above, for which p represents the integer 1 and which thus constitute dihydrouracil derivatives, may be synthesized according to the process indicated above and especially according to the general scheme below which describes this synthesis on a solid support. The protocol that follows this scheme gives the operating conditions for such a synthesis of the products of formula (I) of the present patent application on a solid support.<br>
The experimental section below more particularly gives an illustration of such a synthesis on a solid support according to the above protocol with the preparation of Example 5 of the present patent application.<br>
For the synthesis of the dihydrouracils on a solid support, the protocol that follows may be used.<br>
Wang polystyrene resin (1.7 mmol/g) is used, for example, which resin is treated with a mixture of p-amino acid, 2,6-dichlorobenzoyl chloride and pyridine in DMF. After washing the resin is treated with a 10% solution of piperidine in DMF. The resulting free amine is reacted with an aldehyde in a mixture of THF/trimethyl orthoformate (TMOF). The resulting Schiff's base is reduced with sodium cyanoborohydride in a mixture of methanol, THF and acetic acid. The secondary amine obtained is acylated with phosgene and the resulting carbomoyl chloride is treated with a primary amine to give  the  corresponding  urea.  Cyclization  to  the<br><br>
dihydrouracil and cleavage of the final product are performed by treating with a strong base such as diazabicycloundecene (DBU).<br>
The products of formula (I) of the present patent application may thus be synthesized on a solid support as described above or in liquid phase according to the process indicated below: the experimental section of the present patent application gives an illustration of such a liquid-phase synthesis with the preparation of Examples 57 to 62.<br>
For this liquid-phase synthetic process, two routes A and B may be performed, each involving two steps. Route A:<br>
step a: the alkylation of the amino ester may be performed by reductive amination with an aromatic or heterocyclic aldehyde according to the general process described in Advanced Organic Reaction, March, third edition, page 798-800. In particular, the formation of the Schiff's base (intermediate) may be performed using an amino ester optionally in salt form, an aldehyde and optionally a dehydrating agent (for example magnesium sulfate) in a solvent, for instance dichloromethane or dichloroethane, at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux point of the solvent. The imine formed may be isolated. The imine formed is reduced with a metal hydride, for instance sodium borohydride, in a solvent, for instance an alcohol (for example ethanol or methanol), at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux point of the solvent.<br>
step b: the amino ester obtained is coupled with an isocyanate in a solvent, for instance THF or dichloromethane, with or without the presence of a base (for example triethylamine) or an acid (for example trifluoroacetic acid), at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux point of the solvent. When the isocyanates are not commercially available, they are prepared from<br><br>
the corresponding amines and triphosgene or diphosgene or phosgene in the presence of a base (for example pyridine or triethylamine) according to the general procedure described in Advanced Organic Reaction, March, third edition, page 370. Route B:<br>
step a: the formation of the isocyanate may be performed by coupling an aromatic or heterocyclic amine with diphosgene in the presence of activated plant charcoal, in a solvent, for instance toluene, at a temperature of between -40°C and the reflux point of the solvent. The isocyanate formed is not isolated, and may react with the amino ester or its salt in the same solvent in the presence of a base, for instance triethylamine, at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux point of the solvent, to give the 3-arylimidazolidine-2,4-dione derivative.<br>
step b: the coupling of this derivative with an alkyl halide is performed in the presence of a base, for instance potassium tert-butoxide or sodium hydride, in a solvent, for instance THF or DMF, at a temperature of between 0°C and the reflux point of the solvent. The products of formula (I) of the present patent application that constitute examples 201 to 2 07 of the present patent application were prepared as indicated below in the experimental section and as indicated in the schemes that follow: in these schemes, example I represents example 201, example II represents example 202, example III represents example 203, example IV represents example 204, example V represents example 205, example VI represents example 206 and example VII represents example 207.<br><br><br><br><br>
The synthesis of the products of formula (I) of the present patent application that constitute the products of examples 208 to 243 was performed using route B. The alkyl halide may be prepared from the corresponding carboxylic acids.<br><br><br>
The ethyl carboxylates were prepared by esterification of the carboxylic acids in ethanol in the presence of sulfuric acid, repeating the conditions described in Synthesis 2000, 1138.<br>
The reduction of the ethyl carboxylates to alcohol was performed in ethanol in the presence of sodium borohydride, repeating the conditions described in Synthesis 2000, 1665.<br>
The conversion of the alcohols thus obtained into alkyl halides was performed using dibromotriphenylphosphorane as halogenating agent, repeating the conditions described in J. Heterocyclic Chem., 30, 631 (1993).<br><br><br>
The alkyl halides may also be prepared by f ree-radical bromination of the corresponding methylenes in the presence of N-bromosuccinimide and benzoyl peroxide in carbon tetrachloride, repeating the conditions described in J. Heterocyclic Chem., 30, 631 (1993).<br>
Thus, we functionalized the pyridine nucleus in position 2 with a bromine or fluorine atom or alternatively with a nitrile group.<br>
The latter compound will also allow us to prepare various carbonyl compounds.<br><br><br>
The acidic hydrolysis of the nitrile in the presence of sulfuric acid, repeating the conditions described in J. Med. Chem. 1991, 34, 281-290, led to the carboxamide in dimeric form. Hydrolysis of the nitrile under milder conditions allowed us to obtain the expected carboxamide.<br>
Acidic hydrolysis of the nitrile in the presence of 5N hydrochloric acid, repeating the conditions described in J. Heterocyclic Chem. , 30, 631 (1993) , led to the corresponding carboxylic acid.<br>
The amide may be prepared from the carboxylic acid using       1- (3-dimethylaminopropyl)-3-ethylcarbodiimide hydrochloride  as  coupling  agent  in  dichloromethane, repeating the conditions described in J. Am. Chem. Soc. , 95, 875, (1973) .<br><br>
Various amine analogs were obtained by nucleophilic substitution of the chlorointermediate with amines under irradiation in a microwave oven, based on the conditions described in Tetrahedron 2002, 58, 1125.<br><br>
The amino analog was obtained by deprotection of the p-methoxybenzylamine group in the presence of trifluoroacetic acid, based on the conditions described in J. Chem. Soc., Perkin Trans. 1, 2002, 428-433.<br>
This amino derivative allowed access to other chemical functions, for instance the amide function, the carbamate function or the sulfonamide function.<br><br><br>
The acetamido derivative was obtained by acylation of the amine derivative in the presence of acetic anhydride, based on the conditions described in Tetrahedron Lett. 2002, 43, 3121. We also prepared the methyl and tert-butyl carbamates on the basis of the conditions described in J. Heterocyclic Chem., 22, 313 (1985) and in J. Org. Chem. 2002, 67, 4965. The amine derivative was also sulfonylated with mesyl chloride, based on the conditions described in J. Med. Chem., 1985, 28, 824.<br><br><br>
The above conditions were also used for the synthesis of compounds containing a disubstituted phenyl group.<br>
The hydantoin containing a pyridine nucleus disubstituted in position -2,6 with a bromine atom was prepared using the above conditions, starting with 2,6-dibromo-4-(hydroxymethyl)pyridine described in Synthesis 2000, 1665.<br><br><br>
The products may be purified as follows:<br>
Purification by LC/MS<br>
The products may be purified by LC/MS using a Waters FractionLynx system composed of a Waters model 600 gradient pump, a Waters model 515 regeneration pump, a Waters Reagent Manager dilution pump, a Waters model 2700 autoinjector, two Rheodyne model LabPro valves, a Waters model 996 diode array detector, a Waters model ZMD mass spectrometer and a Gilson model 2 04 fraction collector. The system was controlled by the Waters FractionLynx software. The separation was performed alternatively on two Waters Symmetry columns (C1Q, 5 /xM, 19x50 mm, catalog reference 186000210), one column undergoing regeneration with a 95/5 (v/v) water/acetonitrile mixture containing 0.07% (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid, while the other column was being used for separation. The elution of the columns was performed using a linear gradient of from 5% to 95% of acetonitrile containing 0.07% (v/v) of trif luoroacetic acid in water, at a flow rate of 10 mL/min. At the outlet of the separation column, a thousandth of the effluent is separated with an LC Packing Accurate, diluted with methyl alcohol at a flow<br><br>
rate of 0.5 mL/min and conveyed to the detectors, in a proportion of 75% to the diode array detector, and the remaining 25% to the mass spectrometer. The rest of the effluent (999/1000) is conveyed to the fraction collector, where the flow is discarded as long as the mass of the expected product is not detected by the FractionLynx software. The molecular formulae of the expected products are supplied to the FractionLynx software, which triggers the collection of the product when the detected mass signal corresponds to the ion [M+H]+ and/or to the [M+Na]+. In certain cases, depending on the analytical LC/MS results, when a strong ion corresponding to [M+2H]++ was detected, the value corresponding to half of the calculated molecular mass (MW/2) is also supplied to the FractionLynx software. Under these conditions, the collection is also triggered when the signal for the mass of the ion [M+2H]++ and/or [M+Na+H]++ is detected. The products were collected in tared glass tubes. After collection, the solvents were evaporated of f, in a Savant AES 2 00 0 or Genevac HT8 centrifugal evaporator and the product masses were determined by weighing the tubes after evaporation of the solvents.<br>
The LC/MS analyses were performed on a Micromass model LCT machine connected to an HP 1100 machine. The abundance of the products was measured using an HP G1315A diode array detector over a 200-600 nm wavelength range and a Sedex 65 light scattering detector. The mass spectra were acquired over a range from 180 to 800. The data were analyzed using the Micromass MassLynx software. The separation was performed on a Hypersil BDS CI8, 3 /zm column (50 x 4.6 mm) , eluting with a linear gradient of from 5% to 90% of acetonitrile containing 0.05% (v/v) of trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) in water containing 0.05% (v/v) of TFA, over 3.5 min at a flow rate of 1 mL/min.<br><br>
The  total  analysis  time,  including  the  column  re-equilibration time, is 7 minutes.<br>
