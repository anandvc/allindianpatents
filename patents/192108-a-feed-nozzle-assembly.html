The invention relates to a feed nozzle for introÂ¬ducing a gas and a liquid into a vessel, particularly for introducing steam and hydrocarbon feed into a catalytic cracking reactor.<br>
Many oil refinery and chemical plant units utilize nozzles for distributing liquid and/or gaseous feed to the unit. In some units, the ability of the nozzle to distribute the feed to the unit is very important to the productivity of the unit. For example, a catalytic cracking unit is a reactor for cracking large chain hydrocarbon molecules found in crude oil into smaller and more valuable commercial products such as gasoline range hydrocarbons and diesel oils. Typically, vacuum distillates are introduced through feed nozzles in an upflow riser reactor where the feed is contacted with regenerated particulate solid catalysts. The catalyst selectively aids desirable cracking reactions.<br>
For peak performance of the reactor, it is essential that the nozzle distribute the feed in a fine spray having a uniform coverage and a narrow droplet size distribution. Such a spray increases the surface area of the feed droplets and facilitates contacting with the catalyst particles. Existing nozzles have difficulty, however, in achieving this desired performance. Some nozzles use very small openings or complex tip design which easily become plugged by various impurities in the feed. The down time and replacement expense in repairing such a blockage is very disadvantageous. Existing nozzles cannot produce fine droplets and/or a desirable spray pattern.<br>
Accordingly, it would be advantageous to have a nozzle capable of achieving a narrow distribution of fine<br><br>
droplets, a thin layer of spray, and not having a tendency for blockage.<br>
To this end the feed nozzle assembly for introducing gas, for example steam, and liquid, for example a heavy petroleum hydrocarbon, into a vessel, for example a catalytic cracking reactor, according to the present invention comprises:<br>
(a)	a nozzle body having a substantially cylindrical inner tube defining a gas conduit and an outer tube arranged around the inner tube, wherein the outer surface of the inner tube and the inner surface of the outer tube define an annular liquid conduit, and wherein each of the tubes have an inlet end and an opposite outlet end;<br>
(b)	a first nozzle tip fixedly attached to the outlet end of the inner tube having a substantially cylindrical inlet end attached to the outlet end of the inner tube and an opposite dome-shaped outlet end, which dome-shaped outlet end is provided with at least one passageway;<br>
(c)	a second nozzle tip fixedly attached to the outlet end of the outer tube and arranged around the first nozzle tip, which second nozzle tip has a substantially cylindrical inlet end attached to the outlet end of the outer tube and an opposite dome-shaped outlet end provided with at least one elongated slit having substantially parallel walls, which the dome-shaped outlet end of the second nozzle tip extends beyond the dome-shaped outlet end of the first nozzle tip.<br>
The invention will now be described by way of example in more detail with reference to the accompanying drawings, wherein<br>

Reference is made to Figures 1, 2 and 3, showing an embodiment of the invention. The feed nozzle assembly 100 for introducing gas, for example steam, and liquid, for example a heavy petroleum hydrocarbon, into a vessel (not shown), for example a catalytic cracking reactor comprises a nozzle body 101 having a substantially cylindrical inner tube 105 defining a gas conduit 106 and an outer tube 115 arranged around the inner tube 105, wherein the outer surface of the inner tube 105 and the inner surface of the outer tube 115 define an annular liquid conduit 116. The inner tube 105 has an inlet end 120 and an opposite outlet end 130, and the outer tube 115 has an inlet end 125 and an opposite outlet end 135.<br><br>
The central longitudinal axis of the inner tube 105 is referred to with reference numeral 136.<br>
The feed nozzle assembly 100 further comprises a first nozzle tip 140 fixedly attached to the outlet end 130 of the inner tube 105. The nozzle tip 140 has a substantially cylindrical inlet end 141 attached to the outlet end 130 of the inner tube 105 and an opposite dome-shaped outlet end 142. The dome-shaped outlet end 142 is provided with at least one passageway 145.<br>
The feed nozzle assembly 100 further comprises a second nozzle tip 150 fixedly attached to the outlet end 135 of the outer tube 115 and arranged around the first nozzle tip 140. The second nozzle tip 150 has a substantially cylindrical inlet end 151 attached to the outlet end 135 of the outer tube 115 and an opposite dome-shaped outlet end 152 provided with at least one elongated slit 155 having substantially parallel walls 156 (see Figure 2). The dome-shaped outlet end 152 of the second nozzle tip 150 extends beyond the dome-shaped outlet end 142 of the first nozzle tip 140.<br>
The inner tube 105 and the outer tube 115 are fixedly joined by spacer studs 310.<br>
Reference is now made to Figures 4A, 4B, and 4C which show in particular embodiments, the dome-shaped outlet end 142 of the first ("steam") nozzle tip 140. The first nozzle tip 140 is provided with two rows of passageÂ¬ways 145.<br>
The dome-shaped outlet end 142 has a hemi-spherical shape or a hemi-elliptical shape.<br>
The angle formed from substantially the centre (not shown) of the dome-shaped outlet end 142 through the length a row of passageways 145 is suitably in the range of from 45Â° to 120Â°, and suitably from 75Â° to 105Â°. It will be understood that when the outlet end 142 is hemiÂ¬spherical, the centre is the spherical centre and when<br><br>
the outlet end is hemi-elliptical the centre is the elliptical centre.<br>
Reference is now made to Figures 5A/ 5B, and 5C which show in particular embodiments, the dome-shaped outlet end 152 second ("hydrocarbon feed") nozzle tip 150. The second nozzle tip 150 is provided with two parallel elongated slits 155.<br>
The dome-shaped outlet end 152 has a hemi-spherical shape or a hemi-elliptical shape.<br>
The angle formed from substantially the centre (not shown) of the dome-shaped outlet end 152 of the second nozzle tip 150 through the length of the elongated slit(s) 155 is substantially contiguous with the angle formed from the centre of the dome-shaped outlet end 142 of the first nozzle tip 140 through the length of the row(s) 145. It will be understood that when the outlet end 152 is hemi-spherical, the centre is the spherical centre and when the outlet end is hemi-elliptical the centre is the elliptical centre.<br>
The feed nozzle assembly is suitably used in a process for catalytically cracking a heavy petroleum hydrocarbon. In such a process a heavy petroleum hydrocarbon is preheated, mixed with steam, and fed into a catalytic cracking reactor riser. The heavy petroleum hydrocarbon are then contacted with a cracking catalyst to produce light hydrocarbons and spent catalyst coated with fine coke layer. The light hydrocarbons are removed from the reactor. A portion of the spent catalyst coated with fine coke layer is passed to a regenerator reactor. At least a portion of the coke is then burned off the spent catalyst. This results in a regenerated catalyst.<br>
During normal operation of the feed nozzle assembly 100 according to the present invention steam is passed through the substantially cylindrical inner tiobe 105 and the heavy hydrocarbon is supplied to the inlet end 125 of<br><br>
the outer tube 115 and passes through the annular liquid conduit 116.<br>
Steam exiting the passageways 145 passes into the hydrocarbon results in the forming of a fine two-phase mixture of steam bubbles jetting through the hydrocarbon mixture. The function of the second nozzle tip 150 is the passage of the mixture of steam and heavy petroleum hydrocarbon out of the feed nozzle assembly 100. The second nozzle tip 150 is adapted to substantially uniformly atomize the mixture of steam and heavy petroleum hydrocarbon into a catalytic cracking reactor (not shown). This results in a mixture of steam and heavy petroleum hydrocarbon which is passed into the catalytic cracking reactor.<br>
The passageways 145 out of the outlet end 142 of the gas conduit 106 do not foul. Fouling due to coking of the heavy petroleum feed is avoided since the flow of heavy petroleum feed around the outside of the outlet end 142 of the gas conduit 106 has a cooling heat transfer function. Thus, the temperature at the passageways 142 is sufficiently low that the contact of steam and heavy petroleum does not result in coking and blockage of the passageways 142.<br>
An aspect of the present invention is a nozzle assembly for feeding a heavy petroleum hydrocarbon into a catalytic cracker riser reactor. The nozzle body 101 is typically oriented horizontally, vertically, or diagonally into the riser reactor (not shown). Other orientations are possible. When vertically oriented, the nozzle body 101 typically will extend upward from the bottom or inlet end of the reactor. When not vertical, the nozzle body 101 will typically protrude through the walls of the reactor in an orientation between vertical and horizontal. Different orientations will typically require different outlet designs since the ideal spray pattern depends on the nozzle orientation. The nozzle<br><br>
r<br>
assembly 100 of the invention is suited for any of these orientations since the configuration of the elongated slits 155 of the second outlet end 150 can be modified to achieve the desired spray pattern.<br>
Typically with a vertically oriented nozzle body 101, the elongated slits 155 will be a half-moon or crescent shape or other non-linear shape in order to configure the spray to fit the conduit. In a side entry nozzle body 101, the elongated slits 155 or substantially straight lines when viewed from straight on as in Figure 5A.<br>
The first nozzle tip 140 as shown in Figures 4A-4C is provided with two rows of passageways 145, in other embodiments there may only be one passageway, or one row of passageways depending on the application.<br>
The second nozzle tip 150 as shown in Figures 5A-5B is provided with two parallel elongated slits 155, in other embodiments there may only be one slot depending on the application.<br>
The dome-shaped outlet end 142 typically has at least one passageway 145 corresponding with each elongated slit 155 in the outlet end 152 of the second nozzle tip 150. For example, if the second nozzle tip 150 has two elongated slits 155, then the first nozzle tip 140 will have least two corresponding openings passageways 145. A row of passageways 145 can be replaced by a slit.<br>
Typically the passageways 145 in the first nozzle tip 140 will consist of at least one row of small holes which line up with each corresponding elongated slit 155 in the second nozzle tip 150. However, the first nozzle tip 140 may have more than one row of holes corresponding to each elongated slit 155 in the second nozzle tip 150. Preferably the number of passage v.-ays per row is in the range of from 7 to 15.<br>
The angle formed from the centre of the dome-shaped outlet<br>
end 152 of the second nozzle tip 150 through the length of the<br>
elongated slits 155 is preperably substantially contiguous with<br>
the angle formed from the centre of the dome-shaped outlet end<br>
142 of the first -		<br>
-8 OCT 200?-	DUPLICATE-<br><br>
nozzle tip 140 through the width of the row of passageÂ¬ways 145.<br>
Suitably outer tube 115 has a diameter in the range of from 0.05 to 0.25 m (2-9 inches), or from 0.1 to 0.25 m (4-9 inches), or from 0.12 to 0.2 m (5-7 inches).<br>
The distance the dome-shaped outlet end 152 of the second nozzle tip 150 extending beyond the dome-shaped outlet end 142 of the first nozzle tip 140 is adapted to substantially uniformly atomize the mixture of steam and heavy petroleum hydrocarbon into a catalytic cracking reactor. Suitably the distance between the dome-shaped outlet end 152 of the second nozzle tip 150 and the dome-shaped outlet end 142 of the first nozzle tip 140 is typically from about 0.006 to 0.030 m (0.25-1.25 inches).<br>
The first nozzle tip 140 is fixedly attached to the outlet end 130 of the inner tube 105, the attachment is by any conventional means such as a threaded connection or a welded connection. Such connection is also applicable to the second nozzle tip 150 attached to the outer tube 115.<br>
Optionally, an erosion-resistant material is used as an overlay 158 (see Figure 5C) at erosion sensitive areas of the elongated slits 155 and the outlet end 152 of the second nozzle tip 150. Typically, such areas are the portions of the elongated slits 155 and outlet end 152 in contact with catalyst particles. Such particles are abrasive and thus an erosion resistant overlay prolongs the life of the outlet end. An example of such erosion-resistant material is STELLITE, trade name for a series of alloys with cobalt, chromium, tungsten and molybdenum in various proportions.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 6 which shows a frontal view of an alternative of the dome-shaped outlet end 150 shown in Figure 5C. In this embodiment each elongated slit 155 is integrally connected at one point 157 along its walls to provide structural strength.<br><br>
In the feed nozzle assembly as described with reference to Figures 1-6, the plane (not shown) defined by a row of passageways 145 is substantially parallel to the central longitudinal axis 136 (see Figure 1) of the inner tube 105. Also the plane (not shown) defined by an elongated slit 155 is substantially parallel to the central longitudinal axis 136 of the inner tube 105.<br>
However, there are applications, for example for riser reactors with currently available nozzle designs, where the adjustment of the injection angle of the feed requires expensive modifications of the apparatus. It would therefore be desirable to be able to only replace the feed nozzle in order to adjust the feed injection angle without the need for other equipment modifications.<br>
Reference is now made to Figure 7 which shows a sectional view of an alternative of the dome-shaped outlet end 140 of the first nozzle as shown in Figure 4B drawn to a different scale. In the embodiment shown, the angle between the plane 14 6 defined by a row of passageÂ¬ways 145 and the central longitudinal axis 136 of the inner tube (not shown) is in the range of from 3Â° to 60Â°. Where the nozzle assembly is a side entry into the reactor this angle will be from about 0Â°, or about 3Â° to about 45Â°. Where the feed nozzle assembly is a bottom entry, the angle will be greater, for example, from about 0Â° to about 60, or preferably from about 15Â° to about 45Â°, or from about 20Â° to about 40, or from about 25Â° to about 35Â°. For bottom entry configurations, the angle is typically toward the centre of the riser reactor from the longitudinal axis of the steam conduit. This angle for the first nozzle tip passageways in the outlet end will substantially equal the angle for elongated slits in the outlet end of the second nozzle tip.<br>
Reference is further made to Figure 8 showing a sectional view of an alternative of the dome-shaped outlet end of the second nozzle 150 as shown in<br><br>
Figure 5B, wherein the angle between the plane 156 defined by an elongated slit 155 and the central longitudinal axis 136 of the inner tube (not shown) is in the range of from 3Â° to 60Â°. Where the nozzle assembly is a side entry into the reactor this angle will be from about 0", or about 3Â° to about 45Â°. Where the feed nozzle assembly is a bottom entry, the angle will be greater, for example, from about 0Â° to about 60", or preferably from about 15Â° to about 45Â°, or from about 20Â° to about 40Â°, or from about 25Â° to about 35Â°. For bottom entry configurations, the angle is typically toward the centre of the riser reactor from the longitudinal axis of the steam conduit. This angle for the second nozzle tip elongated slits in the outlet end will substantially equal the angle for passageways in the outlet end of the first nozzle tip.<br>
Typically, where the nozzle assembly is a side entry into the reactor the angle between the central longitudinal axis of the inner tube and the central longitudinal axis of the reactor will be from about 0Â°, or about 3Â° to about 45Â°.<br>
Reference is made to Figure 9 showing a longitudinal partly-sectional view of a side entry reactor configuration. The feed nozzle assembly 100 according to the present invention is arranged in the side wall 380 of a reactor 390, which side wall is internally lined with heat insulating material 395. The feed nozzle assembly 100 comprises a housing 400 in which are arranged the outer tube 115 and the inner tube 105. In the embodiment as shown, the angle between the central longitudinal axis 136 of the inner tube 105 and the central longitudinal axis 410 of the reactor 390 is 45Â°, and the angle between the planes 14 6 and 156 defined by a row of passageways 145 and defined by an elongated slit 155, respectively and the central longitudinal axis 136 of the inner tube 105 is 30Â°.<br><br>
The angle between the plane 146 defined by a row of passageways 145 and the central longitudinal axis 136 of the inner tube 105 is substantially contiguous with the angle between the plane 156 defined by an elongated slit L55 and the central longitudinal axis 136 of the inner bube 105, so that during normal operation the direction Df the fluid leaving the passageways 145 is directed towards the elongated slit(s) 155.<br>
The feed nozzle assembly of the present invention is suitable for both bottom entry and side entry feed ::onfiguration riser reactors. In the process of renovating a side entry configuration riser reactor, optionally, only the nozzle and associated steam and feed conduits are replaced. In bottom entry configurations, the nozzle of the invention is particularly beneficial in aconomic savings. There is a very high cost associated fiith  renovating a bottom entry riser reactor into a side 2ntry riser reactor. The renovation may be uneconomical Lf the improved performance of a side entry reactor is offset too much by the high renovation costs. Using the lozzle of the invention this economic problem is overcome. A bottom entry riser reactor can remain so and still have the benefits of a side entry riser reactor. In this embodiment of the invention the feed and steam ::onduits will rise, optionally, parallel to the wall and along the outer circumference of the inside of the riser reactor. The nozzle with angled outlets are then attached to the respective steam and feed conduits. This, in affect, simulates a side entry riser reactor without the ligh cost of actually having side entry.<br>
Reference is now made to Figures lOA and lOB which iepict a known nozzle 3 from European patent application publication No. 423 876. This nozzle 3 is used in the Experiment discussed in the illustrated embodiment section below in comparing performance of it against an smbodiment of the feed nozzle assembly of the invention.<br>
13<br><br>
As shown in Figures lOA and lOB, the known nozzle 3 has open-ended conduits 7 for hydrocarbon feed and an outer space 10 for steam which surrounds the conduits 7 and which is closed at its downstream end. The outer conduits 7 have multiple side inlets 8 for the passage of steam from the outer space 10.<br>
The invention is further described in the following illustrative embodiments. The illustrative embodiment are for illustrative purposes only and are not intended to limit the scope of the invention in any way.<br>
In the following illustrative embodiment an experiment was run to compare the niamerous performance factors which resulted from operation of one embodiment of the feed nozzle assembly of the invention as shown in Figures 1-5 with that of known nozzle as depicted in European patent application publication No. 423 876, as depicted in Figures lOA and lOB.<br>
For simplification of the experiment air and water was used rather than steam and a heavy petroleum hydrocarbon. Air was fed into the steam conduit and water was fed into the heavy hydrocarbon petroleum annular conduit. Feed rates, feed pressures, and temperatures were substantially the same for each nozzle.<br>
Table 1 gives the results of the experiment.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
Table 2 (cont'd). Results of a comparison between the known feed nozzle assembly and the feed nozzle assembly as described with reference to Figures 7 and 8.<br><br>
As shown in the results above, the feed nozzle assembly of the invention had a superior performance in 8 of the 9 categories, moreover with the feed nozzle assembly of the invention off axis injection is possible.<br>
Small droplet size is important since surface is increased. A uniform spray is desirable since this results in uniform utilization of catalyst. The coverage of the spray in the reactor is significant since the greater the coverage the greater the contacting with the catalyst. A quick expansion of the spray is required to obtain contacting with more catalyst. A single contact zone of the spray with the catalyst is important in order to control the contact time of the catalyst with the feed. The "operation window" refers to the range of the ratio of steam to hydrocarbon feed over which the nozzle can effectively operate. A large range is desirable since fluctuations routinely occur in steam availability during normal refinery operations. Operation without any steam flow is useful in the case of a total steam outage. It is very useful in reducing turnaround and down time to be<br><br>
able to have quick access to the steam orifices since they may sometimes become obstructed. Moreover a fast mixing of the feed and catalysts is desirable to vaporize the feed.<br>
The fine two-phase mixture passes through the feed nozzle outlet into the catalytic cracking reactor. One benefit of the nozzle assembly of this invention is that, for example, where two outlet elongated slits are used, two sheet-like fans of spray are produced which, possibly due to a vacuum effect between them, converge into one sheet while still in close proximity to the tip or outlet. Thus, fine atomization is obtained while also achieving a desirable uniform spray pattern, i.e., a flat sheet when the nozzle outlets are straight lines. It is noted that theorization as the scientific principle which produces the single sheet of spray is not meant to limit the invention as other explanations may be applicable.<br><br><br><br>
