FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for the preparation of high purity anastrozole. Anastrozole which is (2,2'-[5-(lH-l,2,4-triazol-l-ylmethyI)-l,3-phenylene] dJ(2-methylpropio-nitri]e) has the formula-I<br><br>
The invention also relates to an improved process for the preparation of or its acid addition salts of anastrozole.<br>
Anastrozole is an aromatase inhibitor useful for the treatment of breast cancer<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Anastrozole is reported for the first time by Imperial Chemical Industries in EP 296749 (equivalent US pat. 4935437). Pharmacology and pharmacokinetics of anastrozole is reviewed in Breast Cancer Res. Treat. 30, 103-Ul (1994) and J. Steroid Biochem. Moke. Biol 53, 175-179, (1995). Clinical trial of anastrozole in advanced breast cancer is published in Cancer. 79, 730 (1997).<br>
Two processes are described in EP 296749 for the preparation of anastrozole. The first process consists of conversion of 3,5-(bisbromomethyl)toluene of the formula-II to the corresponding nitrile of the formula-Ill by treatment with potassium cyanide (Scheme-I).<br>
The nitrile compoimd of the formula-Ill is reacted with sodium hydride and methyl iodide to get the corresponding tetramethyl derivative of the formula-IV. Compound of the formula'IV is reacted with N-bromosuccinimide to get the romomethyl derivative of<br><br>
the formula-V, which on treatment with sodium 1,2,4-triazole gave the crude anastrozole of the formula-h Crude anastrozole was purified by column chromatography and crystallization from cyclohexane/ethyl acetate to get the purified material with a melting point of 81-82°C. Neither the yield nor the HPLC purity of this material is mentioned in<br><br>
Attempts to make anastrozole by the above-mentioned process gave poor yield (
In the second process methyl 3,5-dimethylbenzoate is reacted with NBS to get methyl 3,5-bis(bromomelhyl)benzoate of the formula-VIl (Scheme-II). The bromo derivative of the formula-Vn is reacted with potassium cyanide to get the corresponding nitrile derivative of the formula-VIIL Methylation with methyl iodide followed by reduction of the ester group present in compound of the formula-IX with lithium borohydride gave the compound of the formula-X. Conversion of the hydroxy group present in compound of<br><br>
the formula-X to the chloro derivative using thionyl chloride followed by reaction with 1,2,4-triazole gave the required anastrozole along with the isomer derivative of the formuIa-VI. The required anastrozole was separated from the isomeric impurity by column chromatography.<br><br>
The main disadvantage in this process is the formation of isomeric impurity. As the removal of this impurity requires column chromatograph, which is not a convenient operation on production scale this process is not commercially viable.<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
Keeping in view of the difficulties in commercialization of the above process mainly with respect to yield and quality of anastrozole we aimed to develop a simple purification process, which will enhance the purity without losing much of the anastrozole while<br>
purification.<br>
Anastrozole has been picking up fast as a remedy for treatment of breast cancer. Keeping in view of the difficulties in commercialization of the above-mentioned processes for the preparation of anastrozole, we aimed to develop a simple and economical process for commercial production of anastrozole.<br>
We observed that a promising approach for such a process is to (a) improve the process to avoid/reduce the formation of isomeric impurities (b) improve the quality of anastrozole without losing much of it during the purification (c) avoid the usage of costly and uncommon column chromatography technique to purify anastrozole as such process would produce a lot of solvent waste.<br>
Accordingly, the main objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of anastrozole of the formula-I which avoids/reduces the formation of impurities.<br>
Still another objective of the present invention is to provide an improved process for the preparation of anastrozole of formula-I, which avoids the usage of column chromatography.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide a process for the preparation of &gt;99.8% purity anastrozole of formula-I with all the impurities below 0,1% level.<br>
The present invention has been developed based on our finding that the isomeric impurity of formula-VI cannot be removed to 
 <br>
&gt;0.5% even after repeated crystallization. Surprisingly, this impurity can be reduced to below 0.1% level by purification of anasrozole acid addition salts. After removal of this impurity neutralization of the acid addition salt gives pure anastrozole of formula-I with more than 99.8% purity and all the impurities below 0.1% level. Purification of anastrozole to &gt;99.8% via formation of acid addition salts is novel and applied for the first time in making high purity anastrozole.<br>
During process development of anastrozole on commercial scale we observed that with increasing batch size isomer content in crude product increased (from 0.8-1.0% on less than 100 g scale to 3-5% on more than kilogram scale). Introduction of a non-polar solvent in this coupling reaction along with DMF reduced the level of isomeric impurity formation during scale up operations. The nonpolar solvents selected for this reaction include aromatic solvent such as toluene, xylenes, hydrocarbon solvents such as hexane, heptane, cyclohexane, etc.<br>
