TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
[0001]<br>
The present invention relates to an improved process for producing nitroisourea derivatives that is an important intermediate of nitroguanidine derivatives having an insect icidal activity.<br>
BACKGROUND ART [0002]<br>
A process for producing nitroguanidine derivatives having an insecticidal activity has been disclosed in Japanese Patent No. 2779403, Japanese Patent No. 2546003, Japanese Patent No. 2766848.  However, for example, as described in Japanese Patent No. 2766848, the problem occurs in the production method that substitution reactions between isothiourea derivatives and amines are used thereby releasing mercaptans as by-products having a strong distasteful odor.  As an alternative method, in Japanese Patent Laid-open No. 2000-10 3 776, there has been disclosed a process for producing nitroisourea derivatives in which nitroisourea derivatives and amines or a salt thereof are reacted at the pH of 7.0 to 9.0. However, in a production method according to this method,<br><br>
the desired yield of the nitroisourea derivatives are not<br>
sufficiently high and thus the method is economically<br>
disadvantageous in some cases. [0003]<br>

BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
[0015]<br>
The present invention will be illustrated in detail below.<br>
The process for producing nitroisourea derivatives of the present invention is a process for producing nitroisourea derivatives represented by the following general formula (3), in which nitroisourea derivatives represented by the following genera 1 formula ( 1) with amines represented by the following general formula (2) or a salt thereof are reacted in the presence of a catalytic amount of a hydrogen carbonate,<br>
[0016]<br>
(Formula Removed).<br><br>
[0017]<br>

[0022 ]<br>
In the present invention, according to the method in which nitroisourea derivatives represented by the general formula (1) and amines represented by the general formula (2) or a salt thereof are reacted in the presence of a catalytic amount of a hydrogen carbonate, it is possible to suppress the generation of by-products such as nitroguanidine derivatives represented by the following general formula (4) or the like, and it is possible to obtain nitroisourea derivatives represented by the general formula (3) in a high yield,<br>
[0023]<br><br>
(Formula Removed)<br><br>
[0024]<br>
wherein, in the formula, R2 represents an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms; and R 3 represents a hydrogen atom or an alkyl group having 1 to 4 carbon atoms.<br>
[ 0025 1<br>
Examples of the hydrogen carbonate in the present invention include alkali metal hydrogen carbonates such as lithium hydrogen carbonate, sodium hydrogen carbonate, potassium hydrogen carbonate and the like; and alkaline earth metal hydrogen carbonates such as magnesium hydrogen carbonate, calcium hydrogen carbonate, barium hydrogen carbonate and the like.   Preferably, potassium hydrogen carbonate and sodium hydrogen carbonate can be used.  In the present invention, one or more kinds of these hydrogen carbonates can be used.  It is important that the amount of hydrogen carbonate should be a catalytic amount, and specifically from 0.01 to 0.5 mole and preferably from 0.05 to 0.2 mole, based on 1 mole of the foregoing nitroisourea derivatives represented by the general formula (1).<br>
[0026]<br>
The amount of the hydrogen carbonate within the above range makes it possible to obtain nitroisourea derivatives represented by the general formula (3) in a higher yield.<br>
[0027]<br>
Examples of the salt of the amines of the general formula (2) include salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloride, bromate, iodate, sulfate, nitrate, chlorate, perchlorate,<br>
phosphate and the like; and salts of organic acids such as acetate, oxalate, benzensulfonate and the like. Hydrochloride and sulfate are preferably used.<br>
[0028]<br>
The amount of the amines of the general formula (2) or a salt thereof used in the reaction is important because this undergoes a competing reaction with ammonia generated during the reaction. The amine needs to be used more than 2 mole equivalents based on the nitroisourea derivatives represented by the general formula ( 1 ) . From the economic perspectives, the amount is preferably from more than 2 to not more than 3 mole equivalents.<br>
[0029]<br>
The nitroisourea derivatives represented by the general formula (1) is a known compound, and can be produced, for example, by a method described in Reel. Trav. Chim. Pays-Bas, Vol. 81, p. 6 9 (1962) or a method similar thereto.<br>
[0030]<br>
Examples of the solvent used for the reaction include water; alcohol solvents such as methanol, ethanol, propanol, butanol and the like; halogenated hydrocarbon solvents such as dichloromethane, chloroform and the like; aromatic hydrocarbon solvents such as benzene, toluene, xylene and the like; polar aprotic solvents such as dimethyl formamide (DMF), dimethylacetamd.de, dimethyl sulfoxide, 1,3-dimethyl-2-imidazolidinone,<br>
1-methy1- 2-pyrro1idone and the like; ether solvents such as ethyl ether, tetrahydrofuran, dioxane and the like; nitrile solvents such as acetonitri1e, propionitrile and the like; and ketone solvents such as acetone, isopropyl ketone and the like. Of these solvents, particularly preferably used are water and alcohols. Furthermore, the reaction can be carried out with a mixed solvent of water and the organic solvent cited before.<br>
[0031]<br>
When water is selected as a solvent and an aqueous solution containing a neutral inorganic salt is used, it is effective in further enhancing the yield of the nitroisourea derivatives.  Such an inorganic salt refers to an inorganic salt other than the hydrogen carbonate, and examples thereof include alkali metal salts such as lithium chloride, sodium chloride, potassium chloride, lithium iodide, sodium iodide, potassium iodide, lithium bromide, sodium bromide, potassium bromide, lithium sulfate, sodium sulfate, potassium sulfate, sodium nitrate, potassium nitrate, sodium chlorate and the like; and alkaline earth metal salts such as magnesium chloride, calcium chloride, magnesium bromide, calcium bromide, magnesium iodide, calcium iodide, magnesium sulfate, calcium sulfate, magnesium nitrate, calcium nitrate and the like.  As the inorganic salt, sodium chloride can be preferably used from the viewpoint of the above effect. In the present invention, the inorganic salt can be<br>
selected from one or more kinds of these salts and used. The amount of the salt is properly selected in the range of 0.1% concentration to saturation in water, for carrying out the reaction.<br>
[0032 ]<br>
In the present invention, by using a hydrogen carbonate, it is possible to suppress the generation of by-products such as the aforementioned nitroguanidine derivatives represented by the general formula (4) o r the like. Further, by using an inorganic salt other than the hydrogen carbonate, it is possible to suppress the decomposition of a starting material and a product.  For this reason, it is possible to obtain nitroisourea derivatives in a further high yield by a more convenient operation than that used in the prior art.  In this way, by the use of a hydrogen carbonate and an inorganic salt other than the hydrogen carbonate, the method can be further excellent in the productivity, environmental sustainabi1ity and economical efficiency, and is further useful as an industrial production method.<br>
[0033]<br>
The reaction temperature is usually in the range of about -20 to 100 degree centigrade and preferably in the range of about 0 to 50 degree centigrade.  The reaction time is usually in the range of about 10 minutes to 50 hours and preferably in the range of 1 to 20 hours.<br>
[0034]<br>
The nitroisourea derivatives of the general formula (3) produced in the present invention can be separated by extraction with a properly selected organic solvent or the like, or it can be separated by filtration as a crystal as it is.  Furthermore, when it is separated by filtration as a crystal, the nitroisourea derivatives can be extracted with an organic solvent such as ethyl acetate or the like from the filtrate and used for the reaction again.<br>
