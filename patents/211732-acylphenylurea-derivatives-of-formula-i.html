Description<br>
Acylphenylurea derivatives, a process for their preparation and their use as pharmaceuticals<br>
The invention relates to acylphenylurea derivatives and their physiologically tolerated salts and physiologically functional derivatives.<br>
Acylphenylurea derivatives have already been described in the prior art as insecticides (EP 0 136 745, EP 0 167 197, DE 29 26 480, J. Agric. Food Chem. 1999,47,3116-3424).<br>
The invention was based on the object of providing compounds which display a blood glucose-lowering effect which can be exploited therapeutically.<br>

and physiologically tolerated salts thereof, for producing a medicine for lowering the blood glucose level and treating type II diabetes.<br>
The invention relates to compounds of the formula I in the form of their racemates,<br>
racemic mixtures and pure enantiomers, and to their diastereomers and mixtures<br>
thereof.<br>
The alkyl radicals in the substituents R1, R2, R3, R4, R5f R6, R7, A and B may be<br>
both straight-chain and branched.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable salts are particularly suitable for medical applications because of their greater solubility in water compared with the initial or basic compounds. These salts must have a pharmaceutically acceptable anion or cation. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable acid addition salts of the compounds of the invention are salts of inorganic acids such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic, phosphoric, metaphosphoric, nitric, sulfonic and sulfuric acids, and organic acids such as, for example, acetic acid, benzenesulfonic, benzoic, citric, ethanesulfonic, fumaric, gluconic, glycolic, isethionic, lactic, lactobionic, maleic, malic, methanesulfonic, succinic, p-toluenesulfonic and tartaric acids. Suitable pharmaceutically acceptable basic salts are ammonium salts, alkali metal salts (such as sodium and potassium salts) and alkaline earth metal salts (such as magnesium and calcium salts).<br>
Salts with a pharmaceutically unacceptable anion such as, for example, trifluoroacetate likewise belong within the framework of the invention as useful intermediates for the preparation or purification of pharmaceutically acceptable salts and/or use in nontherapeutic, for example in vitro, applications.<br>
The term "physiologically functional derivative" used herein refers to any physiologically tolerated derivative of a compound of the formula I of the invention,<br><br>
for example an ester, which on administration to a mammal such as, for example, a human is able to form (directly or indirectly) a compound of the formula I or an active metabolite thereof.<br>
Physiologically functional derivatives include prodrugs of the compounds of the invention, as described, for example, in H. Okada et al,, Chem. Pharm. Bulk 1994, 42, 57-61. Such prodrugs can be metabolized in vivo to a compound of the invention. These prodrugs may themselves be active or not.<br>
The compounds of the invention may also exist in various polymorphous forms, for example as amorphous and crystalline polymorphous forms. All polymorphous forms of the compounds of the invention belong within the framework of the invention and are a further aspect of the invention.<br>
All references to "compound(s) of formula I" hereinafter refer to compound(s) of the formula I as described above, and their salts, solvates and physiologically functional derivatives as described herein.<br>
The amount of a compound of formula I necessary to achieve the desired biological effect depends on a number of factors, for example the specific compound chosen, the intended use, the mode of administration and the clinical condition of the patient. The daily dose is generally in the range from 0.3 mg to 100 mg (typically from 3 mg and 50 mg) per day and per kilogram of bodyweight, for example 3-10 mg/kg/day. An intravenous dose may be, for example, in the range from 0.3 mg to 1.0 mg/kg, which can suitably be administered as infusion of 10 ng to 100 ng per kilogram and per minute. Suitable infusion solutions for these purposes may contain, for example, from 0.1 ng to 10 mg, typically from 1ng to 10 mg, per milliliter. Single doses may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 10 g of the active ingredient. Thus, ampoules for injections may contain, for example, from 1 mg to 100 mg, and single-dose formulations which can be administered orally, such as, for example, capsules or tablets, may contain, for example, from 1.0 to 1000 mg, typically from 10 to 600 mg. For the therapy of the abovementioned conditions, the compounds of formula I may be used as the compound itself, but they are preferably in the form of a pharmaceutical composition with an acceptable carrier. The carrier must, of course, be acceptable in the sense that it is compatible with the other ingredients of the composition and is not harmful for the patient's health. The carrier may be a solid or a liquid or both and is preferably<br><br>
formulated with the compound as a single dose, for example as a tablet, which may contain from 0.05% to 95% by weight of the active ingredient. Other pharmaceutical^ active substances may likewise be preferable, including other compounds of formula I. The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention can be produced by one of the known pharmaceutical methods, which essentially consist of mixing the ingredients with pharmacologically acceptable carriers and/or excipients.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the invention are those suitable for oral, rectal, topical, peroral (for example sublingual) and parenteral (for example subcutaneous, intramuscular, intradermal or intravenous) administration, although the most suitable mode of administration depends in each individual case on the nature and severity of the condition to be treated and on the nature of the compound of formula I used in each case. Coated formulations and coated slow-release formulations also belong within the framework of the invention. Preference is given to acid- and gastric juice-resistant formulations. Suitable coatings resistant to gastric juice comprise cellular acetate phthalate, polyvinal acetate phthalate, hydroxypropylmethylcellulose phthalate and anionic polymers of methacrylic acid and methyl methacrylate.<br>
Suitable pharmaceutical compounds for oral administration may be in the form of several units such as, for example, capsules, wafers, suckable tablets or tablets, each of which contain a defined amount of the compound of formula I; as powders or granules, as solution or suspension in an aqueous or nonaqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water or water-in-oil emulsion. These compositions may, as already mentioned, be prepared by any suitable pharmaceutical method which includes a step in which the active ingredient and the carrier (which may consist of one or more additional ingredients) are brought into contact. The compositions are generally produced by uniform and homogeneous mixing of the active ingredient with a liquid and/or finely divided solid carrier, after which the product is shaped if necessary. Thus, for example, a tablet can be produced by compressing or molding a powder or granules of the compound, where appropriate with one or more additional ingredients. Compressed tablets can be produced by tableting the compound in free-flowing form such as, for example, a powder or granules, where appropriate mixed with a binder, glidant, inert diluent and/or one or more surface-active/dispersing agent(s) in a suitable machine. Molded tablets can be produced<br><br>
by molding the compound which is in powder form and is moistened with an inert liquid diluent in a suitable machine.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions which are suitable for peroral (sublingual) i     administration comprise suckable tablets which contain a compound of formula I with a flavoring, normally sucrose and gum arabic or tragacanth, and pastilles which comprise the compound in an inert base such as gelatin and glycerol or sucrose and gum arabic.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions suitable for parenteral administration comprise preferably sterile aqueous preparations of a compound of formula I, which are preferably isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient. These preparations are preferably administered intravenously, although administration may also take place by subcutaneous, intramuscular or intradermal injection. These preparations can preferably be produced by mixing the compound with water and making the resulting solution sterile and isotonic with blood. Injectable compositions of the invention generally contain from 0.1 to 5% by weight of the active compound.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for rectal administration are preferably in the form of single-dose suppositories. These can be produced by mixing a compound of the formula I with one or more conventional solid carriers, for example cocoa butter, and shaping the resulting mixture.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for topical use on the skin are preferably in the form of ointment, creme, lotion, paste, spray, aerosol or oil. Carriers which can be used are petrolatum, lanolin, polyethylene glycols, alcohols and combinations of two or more of these substances. The active ingredient is generally present in a concentration of from 0,1 to 15% by weight of the composition, for example from 0.5 to 2%.<br>
Transdermal administration is also possible. Pharmaceutical compositions suitable for transdermal uses can be in the form of single plasters which are suitable for long-term close contact with the patient's epidermis. Such plasters suitably contain the active ingredient in an aqueous solution which is buffered where appropriate, dissolved and/or dispersed in an adhesive or dispersed in a polymer. A suitable active ingredient concentration is about 1% to 35%, preferably about 3% to 15%. A particular possibility is for the active ingredient to be released by electrotransport<br><br>
or iontophoresis as described, for example, in Pharmaceutical Research, 2(6): 318 (1986).<br>

Conversion of compounds of the formula I into their salts takes place by adding one equivalent of the appropriate acid or base in an organic solvent such as, for example, acetonitrile or dioxane or in water and by subsequent removal of the solvent.<br>
The examples listed hereinafter serve to illustrate the invention without, however, restricting it. The measured solidification or decomposition points (m.p.) have not been corrected and generally depend on the heating rate.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
The compounds of the formula I are distinguished by beneficial effects on glucose metabolism; in particular, they lower the blood glucose level and are suitable for treating type II diabetes. The compounds can be employed alone or in combination with other blood glucose-lowering active ingredients. Examples of such other blood glucose-lowering active ingredients are sulfonylureas (such as, for example, glimerpiride, glibenclamide), glitazones (such as, for example, troglitazone, rosiglitazone), alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (such as, for example, acarbose, miglitol) or insulins.<br>
The activity of the compounds was assayed as follows:<br>
Glycogen phophorvlase a activity assay<br>
The effect of compounds on the activity of the active form of glycogen phosphorylase (GPa) was measured in the reverse direction by following the synthesis of glycogen from glucose 1-phosphate by determining the liberation of inorganic phosphate. All the reactions were carried out as duplicate determinations in microtiter plates with 96 wells (Half Area Plates, Costar No 3696), measuring the change in absorption owing to the formation of the reaction product at the wavelength specified hereinafter in a Multiskan Ascent Elisa Reader (Lab Systems, Finland).<br>
In order to measure the GPa enzymic activity in the reverse direction, the general method of Engers et al. (Engers HD, Shechosky Sf Madsen NB, Can J Biochem 1970 Jul;48(7):746-754) was used to measure the conversion of glucose 1-phosphate into glycogen and inorganic phosphate, with the following modifications: human glycogen phosphorylase a (for example with 0.76 mg of protein/ml (Aventis Pharma Deutschland GmbH), dissolved in buffer solution E (25 mM p-glycerophosphate, pH 7.0, 1 mM EDTA and 1 mM dithiotreitol) was diluted with buffer T (50 mM Hepes, pH 7.0,100 mM KCI, 2.5 mM EDTA, 2.5 mM MgCI2'6H20) and addition of 5 mg/ml glycogen to a concentration of 10 pg of protein/ml. Test substances were prepared as 10 mM solution in DMSO and diluted to 50 pM with buffer solution T, To 10 pi of this solution were added 10 pi of 37,5 mM glucose, dissolved in buffer solution T, and 5 mg/ml glycogen, plus 10 pi of a solution of human glycogen phosphorylase a (10 pg of protein /ml) and 20 pi of glucose 1-phosphate, 2,5 mM. The baseline glycogen phosphorylase a activity in the absence of test substance was determined by adding 10 pi of buffer solution T (0.1% DMSO). The mixture was incubated at room temperature for 40 minutes, and the liberated organic phosphate was measured by the<br><br>
general method of Drueckes et al. (al (Drueckes P, Schinzel R, Palm D, AnalBiochem 1995 Sep 1;230(1): 173-177) with the following modifications: 50 pi of a stop solution of 7.3 mM ammonium molybdate, 10.9 mM zinc acetate, 3.6% ascorbic acid, 0.9% SDS are added to 50 pi of the enzyme mixture. After incubation at 45°C for 60 minutes, the absorption at 820 nm was measured. To determine the background absorption, in a separate mixture the stop solution was added immediately after addition of the glucose 1-phosphate solution.<br>
This test was carried out with a concentration of 10 pM of the test substance in order to determine the particular inhibition of glycogen phosphorylase a in vitro by the test substance.<br><br><br><br>
It is evident from the table that the compounds of the formula I inhibit the activity of glycogen phosphorylase a and thus are very suitable for lowering the blood glucose level-<br><br>
The preparation of some examples is described in detail below, and the other compounds of the formula I were obtained analogously: Experimental part:<br>

7.5 g (22.4 mmol) of 6-(4-acetylamino-2,6-dichlorophenoxy)hexanoic acid in 140 ml of 1 m potassium hydroxide solution in methanol/water (3:1) [lacuna] boiled under reflux overnight. The methanol is removed in a rotary evaporator, and the residue is diluted with about 30 ml of water and acidified to pH 5 with glacial acetic acid. The mixture is stirred in an ice bath for 30 minutes and then filtered with suction. The crude product is subjected to column chromatography using<br><br>
n-heptane/ethyl acetate = 1/1 and affords 4.3 g (14.7 mmol, 66%) of the required product.<br>

A solution of 7,5 g (41.1 mmol) of 2-chlorobenzoyl isocyanate in 300 ml of acetonitrile are added to a suspension of 10.0 g (34.2 mmol) of 6-(4~amino-2,6-dichlorophenoxy)hexanoic acid in 700 ml of dry acetonitrile under a protective gas atmosphere at room temperature. The mixture is boiled under reflux for 2 hours and cooled to room temperature. The resulting precipitate is filtered off with suction and washed with 50 ml of acetonitrile. The residue is stirred with 100 ml of methanol, filtered off with suction, washed with a little methanol and dried at40°C under vacuum overnight. 13.7 g (28.9 mmol, 85%) of the required product are obtained..
