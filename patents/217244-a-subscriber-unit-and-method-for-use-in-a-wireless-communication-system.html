				<th>Abstract</th>
				<td>A set of individually gain adjusted subscriber channels (AI BI CI Pilot) are formed via the use of a set of orthogonal subchalU1el codes (Walsh +- Walsh++--) having a small number of PN spreading chips per orthogonal waveform period. Data to be transmitted via one of the transmit chaMels is low code rate error correction encoded and sequence repeated before being modulated with one of the sub channel codesl gain adjustedl and summed with data modulated using the other subchannel codes. The resulting summed data (316) is modulated using a user long code and a pseudorandom spreading code (PN code) and up converted for transmission. The use of the short orthogonal codes provides interference suppression while still allowing extensive error correction coding and repetition for time diversity to overcoroe the Raleigh fading commonly experienced in terrestrial mreless systems. The set of sub-channel codes may comprise four Waish codesl each orthogonal to the remaining codes of the set. The use of four sub-channels is preferred as it allows shorter orthogonal codes to be usedl however, the use of a greater number of channnels and therefore longer codes is acceptable. Preferably the pilot data and control data are combined onto one channel. The remaining two transmit channels are used for transmitting non-specified digital data including user data or signaling data, or both.</td>
