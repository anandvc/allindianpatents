COMPLETE SPECIFICATION<br>
[See Section 10]<br>
"EXHAUST EMISSION CONTROL DEVICE"<br><br><br><br><br>
HONDA GIKEN KOGYO KABUSHIKI KAISHA, a corporation of Japan, having a place of business at 1-1, Minamiaoyama 2-chome, Minato-ku, Tokyo, Japan,<br>
The following specification particularly describes; the nature of the invention and the manner in which it is to be performed:-<br><br><br>
GRANTED<br>
27/12/2004<br><br>
[DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION]<br>
[Industrial Field of Utilization]<br>
The present  invention relates to an exhaust emission<br>
control device for a motorcycle in which a secondary air is<br>
introduced into an exhaust system fitted with a catalyst for<br>
the purpose of catalyst activation and, more particularly, to<br>
an advantageous structure of arrangement of the same.<br><br>
[Prior Art]      <br>
This type of exhaust emission control device is a known<br>
art; for example, an exhaust emission control device disclosed<br>
in Japanese Patent Laid-Open No. H6-330740 is mounted vertically<br>
on one side of the engine, in which the secondary air is supplied<br>
from an engine intake air cleaner through a valve.  Also known<br>
is a similar exhaust emission control device using no air cleaner<br>
which has been disclosed in Japanese Utility Model No. 2581292.<br>
In the present invention, the directions "upper and lower" and<br>
"right and left" of components are orientations in which the<br>
components are attached on the vehicle body.<br><br><br>
[Problem to Be Solved by the Invention]<br>
In the exhaust emission control device, it is desired that<br>
pre-cleaned! air be taken in as the secondary air from the air<br>
cleaner.  However, if the engine intake air cleaner is used as<br>
disclosed iri Japanese Patent Laid-Open No . H6-330740, there will<br>
arise such a; problem that a decreased quantity of engine intake<br><br>
air will result  It is, therefore, preferable to mount a special<br>
air cleaner for secondary air to be supplied separately from<br>
the engine  intake air.<br>
Therefore, it is considered to arrange the air cleaner<br>
for secondary air specially configured as previously stated and<br><br>
the valve on one side of the cylinder section. According to<br><br>
such arrangement, however, the air cleaner and the valve are forced to be mounted in a very narrow space or are hard to install,<br><br>
resulting in a substantially low degree of flexibility in arrangement land lowered maintainability.<br>
In view of the above described problems, therefore, it is a primary object of the invention to provide an exhaust<br>
emission control device capable of resolving the<br>
above described problems, decreasing the component count,<br>
facilitating mounting, and reducing noise.<br><br><br>
[Means for Solving the Problem]	<br>
A first aspect of the exhaust emission control device is<br>
 characterized in that an engine is located nearly at the center<br>
    of the vehiclje body; exhaust gases are introduced to a catalyst through an exhaust pipe connected to the engine; the secondary<br><br>
air passage is connected at one end to the exhaust pipe to supply the secondary air for cleaning the exhaust gases and at the other end to the air cleaner for secondary air through the valve. In this exhaust emission control device, the air cleaner for secondary air is mounted on one side of the engine and the valve is mounted on the other side of the engine. That is, the air cleaner for secondary air and the valve are separately mounted on both the right and left sides of the engine. <br><br>
A second aspect is characterized in that, in the first<br>
aspect stated above, the valve is covered with a boot made of<br>
i an elastic material; the boot being supported on a valve stay<br>
mounted on the engine.<br>
A third aspect is characterized in that, in the second<br>
	'<br>
aspect described  above, the valve stay serves also as a<br><br>
supporting member for supporting the lower part of a radiator<br>
mounted in the front of the engine.<br><br><br>
A fourth aspect is characterized in that, in the first aspect described above, the air cleaner for secondary air is provided with a water-prevention wall which covers the front of the outside air inlet of the air cleaner.<br>
A  fifth aspect is characterized in that, in the first aspect described above, there is provided an air cleaner stay to support tine air cleaner for secondary air on the engine, and the air cleaner stay is fastened together with its components<br><br>
to   the   engine.<br><br><br>
r[Effect  of [the   Invention]<br>
According to the first aspect, the air cleaner for secondary air and the valve are separately mounted on the right and left sides of the engine, either being supported on the engine.  Therefore, the air cleaner and valve thus mounted have<br>
a relatively high degree of freedom and high maintainability<br>
notwithstanding the limited mounting space on the side surface<br>
of the engine.<br><br><br>
According to the second aspect, the valve is covered with<br><br>
     a boot made of an elastic material, which reduces an operating<br>
    sound of thejvalve  and besides the valve can easily be supported<br>
by supporting the boot on the valve stay attached on the engine.<br><br><br>
According tp the third aspect, since the valve stay serves also as a supporting member which supports the lower part of<br>
the radiator mounted in the front of the engine, it is possible<br><br>
to reduce the component count and to facilitate mounting of the<br>
exhaust emission control device.<br><br><br><br>
According to the fourth aspect, since the air cleaner for<br>
Isecondary air is provided with the water-prevention wall<br><br>
covering the front of the outside air inlet thereof, entry of<br>
	'   '	<br>
rain water into the air cleaner for secondary air can be prevented by the wall during driving in rain, making it easy to drive under such an adverse operating condition.<br><br>
According to the fifth aspect, the air cleaner stay for supporting the air cleaner for secondary air is fastened<br>
together with its components to the engine.  It is, therefore,<br>
possible to decrease the component count and to facilitate<br>
mounting of the device.<br><br>
Accordingly!, the present invention relates to an exhaust emission control device for motorcycles which introduces exhaust gases through an exhaust pipe connected to an engine mounted at about the center of a vehicle body,<br><br>
with one end of a secondary air passage for supplying the secondary air for cleaning the exhaust gases connected to said exhaust pipe and with the other end of said secondary air passage connected to an air cleaner for secondary air through a valve; said exhaust emission control device, characterized in that said air cleaner for secondary air is mounted on one side of said engine and said valve is mounted on the other side of said engine; that is, said air cleaner for secondary air and said valve are mounted separately on both right and left sides of said engine.<br><br>

The interior of the air cleaner for secondary air 22 is<br>
separated into two rooms by the air filter 42: a clean room 45<br><br>
and a dirty room 47.  The clean room 45 is located above the<br>
air filter 42.  From the clean room 45, clean secondary air flows<br>
through a joint pipe 46 formed unitarily and projecting on the<br>
side of the upper-case 40, being sent out into the reed valve<br><br>
24 through the connecting pipe 21a connected to the joint pipe<br>
46 and then through the upper secondary air passage 21 located<br>
after the connecting pipe 21a (Fig. 1).<br><br>
The dirty room 47 is located under the air filter 42. At<br><br><br>
the bottom (section of the lower case 41, an intake duct 48 is<br>
formed unitarily,, projecting downward. An opening formed in<br>
the forward end of the intake duct 48 is an outside air intake<br>
port. Around the intake duct 48, a first tubular<br><br>
water-prevejntion wall 49 arranged, with a spacing, provided, for<br>
covering the intake port is formed unitarily with the bottom<br>

As shown in these configurations, the lower boot 26 is located oppositely to the upper boot 25 . The bottom section 26a is an approximately square box type in a plan view, and opens upward. An insertion hole 80 is provided at about the center of the bottom section 26a for inserting one end portion of the lower secondary air passage 23. There are provided slits 81, 81, which are formed vertically through in the front and rear side walls located between the insertion ho!le 80, enabling insertion of the inserting portions<br>
62, 62.    <br>
In the bottom section 26a, projections 82 and 83 are<br>
unitarily formed, protruding downward at a pair of corners on<br><br>
a diagonal line.  Furthermore, formed is a groove 84 which is<br>
extended longitudinally along the vicinity of the left side<br><br>
portion of the bottom section 26a and goes in upward, with the<br>
forward end portion thereof passing the central portion of the<br><br><br>
projection 83.  An upward projecting band section 85 is<br>
unitarily formed with the formation of the groove 84.<br><br>
In a position of the band section 85 above the projection<br>
83, a projection 86 is unitarily formed, projecting upward. At<br>
the central part of the projection 83 where the groove 84 passes,<br>
  a gap portion 87 is formed.  The slits 71, 71 and 81, 81, grooves<br>
74 and 85, and projections 76 and 83 are located in upper and<br>
lower corresponding positions.<br><br><br>
When tihe upper boot 25 and the lower boot 26 are assembled, the upper end portion 88 of the side wall of the lower boot 26 fits in the side wall of the upper boot 25, being engaged at<br>
the stepped portion 78.  The front and rear slits 71, 71 are<br><br>
aligned with corresponding slits 81, 81, either forming one<br>
vertically continuous slit.  In this state, the  inserting<br>
portions 62, 62 (Fig. 7) of the valve stay 27 can be inserted<br>
simultaneously into the upper and lower slits 71 and 81.<br>
	:<br>
The band section 85 fits around the reed valve 24 inserted<br>
between the upper boot 25 and the lower boot 26.  In this state,<br>
the band secttion 85 enters the upper boot 25 to fit in the groove<br>
74 and the projection 86 fits in the gap portion 77.  The<br>
projection 73, therefore, appears as if the gap portion 77 were<br>
not present, just like another projection 72.<br>
     Furthermore, the band section 75 is fitted from below to<br>
the groove 84, being wound on the outside of the bottom section<br>
26a of the lower boot 26; and the projection 76 fits in the gap<br>
portion 87; therefore the projection 83, together with the<br>
projection 76|, appears as if the gap portion 87 were not present<br>
just like the projection 82.  The grooves 74 and 84 and the band<br>
sections 75 and 85: fit each other, being closed.<br>
Next, operation of the present embodiment will be<br>
explained.  First, the reed valve 24 is housed almost<br><br><br>
hermetically in the boot including the upper boot 25 and the<br>
lower boot 26 which were assembled by the aforementioned<br><br>
procedure, and the upper secondary air passage 21 and the lower secondary air passage 23 are connected at each one end. At this time, the reed valve 24 fixed by the band section, 85 is secured so tightly as not to move inside the boot, thus jointing the<br><br>
upper boot 25 and. the lower boot 26 by the band section 75. In<br>
i this manneri installing the reed valve 24 in the boot and<br>
jointing the upper; boot 25 to the lower boot 26 are accomplished. The sliits 71 and 81 formed in the front and rear side walls<br>
of the valve unit, 20 thus assembled mutually vertically<br>
communicate, and therefore the inserting portions 62, 62 of the<br>
valve stay 27 attached on the left side of the engine 8 are<br>
inserted in lithe pair of slits provided in the front and rear<br>
side walls, thereby supporting the valve unit 20 easily and<br>
quickly to the left side of the cylinder head 15.<br>
In the meantime, the air cleaner for secondary air 22 is<br><br><br>
supported on  the right side of the engine 8 through the air cleaner stays 57, and is connected to the connecting pipe 21a<br>
laterally behind the cylinder head cover 16 and above the<br>
cylinder head 15, thereby connecting the valve unit 20 to the<br>
exhaust pipe lO.  Furthermore, the other end of the lower<br>
secondary air passage 23 is connected to the connecting pipe<br>
23a, thus completing the exhaust emission control device which<br>
	]<br>
is  connected to  the exhaust pipe  10   through  the valve unit 20<br>
from   the  air cleaner  22   for   secondary  air.<br>
i!To attach the' air cleaner stay 57 to the engine 8 side,<br><br><br>
the cylinder head cover 16 is placed on the cylinder head 15<br>
with stud bolts 17, 17 inserted. Then, with the nuts 18, 18<br>
left not tightened, the engine mounting lugs 58, 58 are aligned<br>
with the nuts 18, 18 and the stud bolts 17, 17 are inserted into<br>
the through holes 58a, 58a. The nuts 18, 18 are installed on<br>
the forward ends o'f the stud bolts 17 , 17, and then are tightened<br>
together with the! cylinder head cover 16 to the cylinder head<br>
15.	     <br><br>
The air cleaner for secondary air 22 and the valve unit 20, being separately arranged on the right and left sides of the engine 8 as previously stated and supported on the engine 8 side, can be mounted with a relatively high degree of flexibility of arrangement and high maintainability notwithstanding an extremely limited mounting space on the engine 8 side, particularly on the cylinder head 15 and cylinder<br>
head cover 16 sides.<br>
i,<br>
Because the reed valve 24 is covered with a boot made of<br><br>
an elastic material, valve operating noise can be reduced by<br>
this boot. Besides, the reed valve 24 is tightly supported,<br>
also decreasing the noise. Furthermore, since the boot is<br>
supported by the insertion type valve stay 27 attached on the<br>
engine, the reed valve 24 can be easily supported and moreover<br>
contact noise resulting from vibrations of the reed valve 24<br>
and the valve stay 27 can be reduced.	<br><br>
In addition, ; the boot is a split type including the upper<br><br>
boot 25 and the lower boot 26, which are provided with the band sections 75 and 85.  It is, therefore, possible to improve tightness between the reed valve 24 and the boot and between the upper boot 25 and the lower boot 26 by the use of the band sections 7 5; and 85.  Furthermore, these band sections 75 and<br><br>
85 are formed by the provision of the grooves 74 and 84, it is<br><br>
possible to adopt a similar and simple die structure.<br><br>
Furthermore, the lower part of the radiator 9 can be<br>
supported easil 'and quickly by inserting the pin 33, which<br>
projects from the lower tank 32 of the radiator 9, into the<br>
insertion hole 66 provided in the radiator support portion 31<br>
of the valve stay,27.  Besides, since the valve stay 27 serves<br>
also as the radiator support member, both the valve unit 20 and<br>
the radiator 9 can be supported simultaneously by a single part,<br>
thereby enabling the use of multifunctional components,<br>
decrease in component count, and facilitation of installation.<br>
Furthermore the air cleaner for secondary- air 22 is<br><br>
provided witih the first water-prevention wall 49 and the<br>
secondary waiter-prevention wall 50 which cover the front part<br><br>
of the intake duct 48.  The use of the two -stage water-prevention wall structure prevents entry of water into the air cleaner 22<br><br>
 for secondary air, facilitating driving under such an adverse<br>
driving condition as driving in rain.  Moreover, outside air<br>
	ii<br>
being drawn in from below through the intake duct 48 goes upward<br>
in the intakke air,passage 54, and is diverted at the ceiling<br>
section 55, going out sideward from the outlet port 56.<br><br><br>
Therefore, the intake air passage 54 serves as a kind of labyrinth passage.  The adoption of the labyrinth passage that takes in the outside air from below further improves a waterproof performance.<br>
Furthermore, the air cleaner stay 57 is tightened together with the cylinder head cover 16, and therefore it is unnecessary to install a special mounting portion of the air cleaner stay<br>
57 to the cylinder head cover 16 and accordingly no special bolt<br>
     is needed for tightening the air cleaner stay 57, thereby<br>
reducing the component count and facilitating installation.<br><br>
