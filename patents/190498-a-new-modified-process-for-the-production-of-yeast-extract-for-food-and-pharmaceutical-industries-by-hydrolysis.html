The Patents Act, 1970 (39 of 1970)<br>
Complete Specification (See Section 10)<br>
Title : A New Modified Process for the production of Yeast Extract for food and pharmaceutical industries by Hydrolysis.<br>
Applicant: Burns Philp India Ltd.(Formerly The Indian Yeast Company Ltd.), Uran factory, Post - Kegaon, Uran, Raigad 400702,Maharastra, INDIA<br>
A Company incorporated under the Indian Companies Act, 1956.<br>
The following Specification particularly describes and ascertains the nature of this invention and the manner in which it is to be performed .<br><br><br>
The present invention relates to a new modified process for the production of Yeast Extract for Food and Pharmaceutical Industries by Hydrolysis.<br>
Yeast Extract which is composed of proteins, low molecular weight polypeptides, amino acids, nucleotides, glycogen, trehalose, sugars, B-vitamins and many unidentified flavour compounds as well as other intercellular material has long been used as an additive to food products, such as soups, sauces, gravies, meat products, meat flavours, cocktail snacks, seasonings and ready-made dishes, cheese products, spreads and canned vegetables and also added to the tonic formulations. Yeast Extracts are prepared by hydrolysis, plasmoiysis and autoiysis.<br>
Yeast plamolysis can be carried out by addition of sugar, salt or other material of high osmotic pressure to pressed yeast cake. The cake liquefies immediately after treatment because of removal of moisture from the interior of the cells. This process could also be called Osmolysis.<br>
Autoiysis (self solubilization) occurs because of activation of enzymes present in the cells which are mainly implicated in the autoiysis of cells during which proteins are degraded to low molecular weight, polypeptides and amino acids. The process of autoiysis is carried out by using solvents like higher alcohol at appropriate proportion and at controlled digestion temperature to get paste or spray dry powder, which is having special flavour, colors, consistency with high proteins and vitamins useful for food, fermentation and petrochemical industries. Apart from autoiysis process, following modified process was developed and standardized in the R&amp;D Center which is called Yeast Hydrotysate Process and forms the subject of Patent applied herewith.<br>
In the proposed process, yeast cake or yeast cream (Baker's, Distiller's or Brewer's) on 25 to 30% dry matter basis (preferably at 28-29% dry matter) is taken in a sterilized stainless steel vessel, concentrated hydrochloride acid is added at the rate of 8 to 16 litres per 100 kgs of cake basis (preferably 10-12 litres per 100 kgs of cake basis) mash is agitated with agitator and temperature gradually increased to 90 to 100°C (preferably 95°C). The agitation is continued for a period of 24 to 40 hours or until half of the total nitrogen is obtained. Then gradually temperature of vessel decreased to 50 to 60°C (preferably 55°C) and then pH of acid digested slurry adjusted to 5.0 to 6.0 (preferably to 5.8) with caustic and then proteolytic enzymes 0.1 to 0.2% (preferably 0.15%) on the cake basis and meta-bi-sutphite 0,01 to 0.03% on cake basis (preferably 0.03% on cake basis) added to slurry and agitation continued for a period of 24 to 48 hours (preferably 30 hours) to complete breakdown of polypeptides into free protein forms and special flavour develops in the hydrolysate slurry.<br>
The enzymes are then deactivated by holding the digested slurry at 90 to 100°C (preferably 95°C) for a period of 1 to 2 hours. Again pH of digested material adjusted to 5.3 to 5.5 with hydrochloric acid.<br>
-2-<br><br>
This digested slurry filtered through filter press lined with filter aids like Kieseighur till all material got filtered and filtration continued at 70 to 80°C (preferably 75°C) in the way that every batch is exposed to this temperature for fixed time period of say 15 to 20 hours.<br>
Filtrate collected and evaporated under vacuum at a temperature not exceeding 75°C till the concentration of solubles reach upto 35 to 40% total solids. The most important criteria is that evaporator should be filled with fixed volume of filtrate, heating surface should always be covered with material and material is exposed to fixed hours of evaporation. The steam pressure and vacuum are regulated to reduce the batch to batch variation in flavour development.<br>
The concentrated material is taken out of the evaporator chilled further for 12 to 24 hours subject to a low temperature - about 4 to 8°C (preferably 4 to 5°C) wherein some material crystallizes out. The chilled material is passed through a filter press lined with filter aids like Kieselguhr and material is taken into evaporator and evaporated under vacuum and constant temperature not more than 75°C. The volume of material in the evaporator, steam pressure and vacuum are kept constant so that material is exposed to same amount of heat treatment. The material is taken out of the evaporator when refractorneter solfds read 70% (around 65 to 6fi%) and packed in 40 kgs of HOPE carboys.<br>
According to this invention, there is provided process for the production of Yeast Extract for food and pharmaceutical industries by new modified hydrolysis which comprises the step of:<br>
A.	Taking yeast cake/dried yeast/yeast cream (Baker's, Distiller's Brewer's) on 25<br>
to 30% dry solids basis (preferably on 28-29%) in sterilized stainless steel<br>
vessel.<br>
B.	Adding concentrated hydrochloric acid to said yeast at the rate of 8 to 16 litres<br>
per 100 kg of cake basis.<br>
C.	Agitating the mash at a temperature of 90 to 100°C (preferably 95°C) for a<br>
period of 24 to 40 hours whereby half of the total nitrogen is obtained.<br>
D.	Then temperature of vessel decreased to 50 to 60°C (preferably 5°C) and pH<br>
adjusted to 5.0 to 6.0 (preferably 5.8) with caustic soda and then addition of<br>
protolytic enzymes 0.1 to 0.2% (preferably 0.15%) on cake basis and meta-bi-<br>
sulfite 0.01 to 0.03% (preferably 0.03%) on cake basis with agitation ON for a<br>
period of 24 to 48 hours whereby a special flavour develops in the hydrolysate<br>
slurry.<br>
-3-<br><br>
E.	Holding  the   hydrolysate  slurry  of Step  (D)  at temperature  of'90-100°C<br>
(preferably     95°C) for a period of 1 to 2 hours to deactivate the enzymes and<br>
pH adjustment to 5.3 to 5.5.<br>
F.	Subjecting the hydrolysate slurry of Step (E) to filtration through filter press to<br>
obtain a concentrated filtrate having initially dry solids about 12 to 20% dry<br>
matter subject to filtration of all slurry till clear filtrate obtained and evaporating<br>
under vacuum at a temperature not above 75°C to obtain 35 to 40% dry solids.<br>
G.	Subjecting the concentrated Yeast Extract Paste of Step (F) for chilling at<br>
temperature 4 to 8°C (preferably 4 to 5°C) whereby yeast extract crystallizes out<br>
for a period of 15 to 20 hours.<br>
H.        Salt content is automatically adjusted to 10-12% by neutralizing the acid digested slurry to pH 5.5 to 6.0.<br>
!.         The chilled material of 4 to 5°C is again passed through a filter press lined with filter aids and filtrate evaporated under vacuum at constant temperature not more than 75°C. The volume of material in the evaporator, steam pressure and vacuum are kept constant so that material is exposed to the same amount of heat treatment.<br>
J.        Material is taken out of the evaporator when refractometer solids read 71 %<br>
(around 65 to 68%) dry matter and packed syrupy paste in 40 kgs HOPE carboys.<br>
Our co-pending Application No. is 631 / BOM / 99.<br>
By following the new process a standard quality of Yeast Extract with a special flavour and color with syrupy consistency product can be obtained.<br>
The process has been tried out in Pilot Plant Scale and gives product of uniform quality. The material obtained meets the specifications as detailed in Annexure-C.<br>

EXAMPLE - 2<br>
To 2400 kgs of yeast cake of 28% dry matter basis equivalent cream was charged in to the 5000 litre capacity stainless steel digesters, sterilized previously. 240 Litres of concentrated hydrochloric acid was added slowly by agitating mash with agitator. The hyudrolysis was carried out at 95C for 24 hours. After 24 hours half of the total nitrogen was obtained, then temperature of digester gradually decreased to 55°C and pH of the acid digested material adjusted to 5.8 with caustic. Then protolytic enzyme 3.6 kgs alongwith meta-bi-sulphite 0.72 kg were added and digestion continued for the period of 30 hours. Then enzymes were deactivated by heating at 95°C for 1 hour then again pH adjusted to 5.4. The volume of digested slurry adjusted to its original level.<br>
Then this digested slurry filtered through filter press lined with filter aids like Kieselguhr till all material got filtered. Filtration continued at 75-80°C in way that every batch was exposed to this temperature for the period of 18 hours.<br>
Filtrate collected and evaporated under vacuum at 28" and steam supply of constant 10 LB pressure, temperature of evaporator not exceeded above 75°C. This material concentrated to 40% refractometric solids level in 15 hours. The level of material in the evaporator was kept above the heating surface to avoid burnt flavour. The material was then chilled at 4°C for 18 hours wherein some material crystallizes out. Then this chilled material is passed through a filter press lined with filter aid. The sparkling clear material was kept in to evaporator for concentrating at 28" vacuum and at temperature 70-75°C to 71% refractometer solids i.e. 68% dry solids. Total yeast extract obtained 552 kgs i.e. 23% yield on 100 kg of cake on 28% dry solids. The material exhibited specifications as given in Example-1 and gave satisfactory results when used in food stuffs, tonic formulations etc.<br>
