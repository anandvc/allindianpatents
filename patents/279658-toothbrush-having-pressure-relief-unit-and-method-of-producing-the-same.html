â–¡Invention Title<br>
TOOTHBRUSH HAVING PRESSURE RELIEF UNIT AND METHOD OF<br>
PRODUCING THE SAME<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates, in general, to<br>
toothbrushes and methods of producing the same and, more<br>
particularly, to a toothbrush in which a pressure relief<br>
unit is installed in a head part of the toothbrush, and a<br>
method of producing the same.<br>
Background Art<br>
Generally, to produce a toothbrush, first, a<br>
toothbrush body having holes in a head part thereof is<br>
manufactured. Subsequently, bristles, folded in half, are<br>
set in the holes of the head part. The bristles are<br>
fastened to the toothbrush body by inserting wires, which<br>
are made of elastic metal and have a length greater than<br>
the diameter of the hole, into the holes.<br>
However, such a toothbrush production method has<br>
disadvantages in that, because bristles are not reliably<br>
fixed to the toothbrush body, the bristles are easily<br>
removed from the toothbrush body, and impurities are easily<br>
held in the holes formed in the head part of the<br>
1<br>
 <br>
toothbrush. As well, this toothbrush producing method is<br>
problematic in that bristles cannot be set in various<br>
patterns.<br>
As an example of techniques to overcome the above-<br>
mentioned problems, in Korean Patent No. 360977, bristles<br>
are set in a mold of an injection molding machine having a<br>
bristle setting device. Thereafter, portions of the<br>
bristles protruding into the mold are thermally welded<br>
through a heat treatment process. Subsequently, a<br>
toothbrush body is injection-molded along with the bristles<br>
so that the bristles are integrated with the toothbrush<br>
body. In this technique, the bristles are reliably fixed to<br>
the toothbrush body. Furthermore, because it is not<br>
necessary to form holes in a head part of the toothbrush,<br>
the problems of the prior art are solved.<br>
However, the above-mentioned conventional technique<br>
has disadvantages as follow.<br>
First, because toothbrushes are manufactured using a<br>
mold having a constant shape, it is very difficult to<br>
change the shape of the toothbrush body. The toothbrush<br>
body is frequently subject to changes due to trends.<br>
Therefore, the difficulty in changing the shape of the<br>
toothbrush body is a serious problem. Of course, toothbrush<br>
bodies having different shapes may be simultaneously<br>
manufactured by mounting several different molds to a<br>
single injection molding machine. However, in this case,<br>
2<br>
 <br>
there is a problem in that the same number of different<br>
toothbrushes must be manufactured and marketed.<br>
Second, there is a problem in that if an error occurs<br>
even in one process of a series of manufacturing processes,<br>
all other processes must also be stopped. That is, the<br>
conventional technique consists of processes as follow: (1)<br>
a process of setting bristles in the mold, (2) a process of<br>
thermally welding parts of the bristles which protrude into<br>
the mold, and (3) a process of injection-molding a<br>
toothbrush. If an error occurs in even one among the above-<br>
mentioned processes, the production must be stopped.<br>
Third, the injection molding machine is not operated<br>
during the setting and thermal welding processes.<br>
Accordingly, in consideration of the expensive injection<br>
molding machine having the bristle setting device,<br>
productivity per hour is markedly reduced.<br>
To solve the above-mentioned problems, another<br>
technique was proposed in Korean Patent Application No. 10-<br>
2003-0036887.<br>
In this technique, bristles are set in through holes<br>
formed through a head insert 10, which is made of plastic<br>
and has a thickness ranging from 1.5 to 3.0 mm, such that<br>
parts of the bristles protrude from a back surface of the<br>
head insert 10 by 1 to 3 mm. Thereafter, the protruded<br>
parts of the bristles are thermally welded, thus separately<br>
manufacturing the head insert 10 which has the bristles and<br>
3<br>
 <br>
is a partial-product. Subsequently, the head insert 10<br>
having the bristles is placed in a cavity of the mold such<br>
that the bristles are placed outside the cavity of the<br>
mold. Thereafter, a toothbrush body is injection-molded by<br>
injecting resin into the mold using a normal injection<br>
molding machine, thus producing a toothbrush.<br>
In this technique, a process of setting the bristles<br>
in the head insert 10, a process of thermally welding parts<br>
of the bristles which protrude from the back surface of the<br>
head insert 10, and a process of placing the head insert 10<br>
having the bristles in the mold and injection-molding a<br>
toothbrush body are separately conducted. Therefore, even<br>
if an error occurs in one process, other processes can be<br>
conducted. Therefore, the rate of operation of equipment is<br>
markedly enhanced. Furthermore, the shape of the toothbrush<br>
can be easily changed merely by manufacturing an additional<br>
mold for the injection molding machine, which is relatively<br>
inexpensive.<br>
However, in this technique, when injection-molding<br>
the toothbrush body after the head insert 10 having the<br>
bristles is placed in the mold, a phenomenon, in which<br>
resin may flow out along the bristles due to injection<br>
pressure, frequently arises. As such, if resin flows out<br>
along the bristles, the bristles become bonded to each<br>
other, so the value of the product is deteriorated.<br>
Meanwhile, another toothbrush manufacturing method,<br>
4<br>
 <br>
in which a head insert 10 having bristles is separately<br>
manufactured and is then bonded to a toothbrush body,<br>
manufactured through a separate process, using ultrasonic<br>
waves, was proposed. In this technique, because a process<br>
of manufacturing the head insert 10 and a process of<br>
manufacturing the toothbrush body are separately conducted,<br>
the problem of deterioration of workability is solved.<br>
However, in this technique, because the head insert 10 is<br>
inserted into a head part of the toothbrush body and<br>
integrated with the toothbrush body using an ultrasonic<br>
bonding method, the head insert 10 must be precisely<br>
aligned with the toothbrush body. Therefore, an accurate<br>
mold is required, thus the price of equipment is<br>
excessively increased. Furthermore, there is a problem in<br>
that the head part of the toothbrush becomes too thick.<br>
Generally, a head part of a toothbrush that is thin<br>
and narrow is more convenient for a user and increases<br>
tooth brushing efficiency. However, in the above-mentioned<br>
technique, because the head insert is bonded to the head<br>
part of the toothbrush along a bonding line (b) defined on<br>
a sidewall of the head part, the head part of the<br>
toothbrush becomes relatively thick (see, FIG. 1) . To<br>
reduce the thickness of the head part of the toothbrush,<br>
the bonding operation may be conducted on the front surface<br>
of the head part. However, this bonding method requires an<br>
increase in the area of the head part and may cause damage<br>
5<br>
 <br>
to the bristles. Therefore, this bonding method should not<br>
be conducted.<br>
Disclosure<br>
Technical Problem<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made<br>
keeping in mind the above problems occurring in the prior<br>
art, and an object of the present invention is to provide a<br>
toothbrush production method which solves problems of the<br>
conventional arts when holes are formed in a head part of a<br>
toothbrush body and wires are used, and which increases the<br>
productivity and permits the shape of a toothbrush body to be<br>
easily changed. Another object of the present invention is<br>
to provide a toothbrush production method in which even if<br>
an error occurs in one production process, other production<br>
processes are not affected. A further object of the present<br>
invention is to provide a toothbrush producing method which<br>
prevents resin from flowing out along set bristles during an<br>
injection molding process. Yet another object of the present<br>
invention is to provide a toothbrush which has a thin head<br>
part.<br>
Technical Solution<br>
In order to accomplish the above objects, the present<br>
invention provides a method of producing a toothbrush,<br>
including: setting bristles in a plurality of through holes<br>
6<br>
 <br>
formed through a head insert, which is made of plastic and<br>
has a thickness ranging from 1.5 to 3.0 mm, such that parts<br>
of the bristles protrude from a back surface of the head<br>
insert by 1 to 3 mm; fastening the bristles to the head<br>
insert by thermally welding the protruded parts of the<br>
bristles to the head insert, thus manufacturing the head<br>
insert with bristles; placing the head insert having the<br>
bristles in a cavity of a mold for manufacturing a<br>
toothbrush body such that the bristles are placed outside<br>
the cavity of the mold; and injecting resin and forming a<br>
toothbrush body. The method of the present invention<br>
further includes the step of placing a pressure relief unit<br>
having a plate shape on the back surface of the head insert<br>
before the step of injecting resin into the mold.<br>
Advantageous Effects<br>
In the present invention, bristles can be set in a<br>
toothbrush body without wires. The work efficiency of an<br>
expensive injection molding machine is maximized.<br>
Furthermore, because a normal mold, which is manufactured<br>
in a desired shape, can be mounted to the injection molding<br>
machine, the shape of the toothbrush body is easily<br>
changed. As well, even if an error occurs in one production<br>
process, because other production processes are not affected,<br>
the productivity is maximized.<br>
Particularly, the present invention can prevent a<br>
7<br>
 <br>
problem of resin flowing out along set bristles, experienced<br>
in Korean Patent Application No. 10-2003-0036887, which was<br>
filed by the inventor of the present invention. Furthermore,<br>
in the case that an appropriate pressure relief unit is used,<br>
a functional toothbrush such as an antibacterial toothbrush<br>
can be provided. Moreover, the present invention can produce<br>
a high grade toothbrush having reduced thickness. In<br>
addition, because the present invention uses the pressure<br>
relief unit (r) serving as a core material, the present<br>
invention solves a problem of the head part breaking during<br>
use due to its reduced thickness.<br>

Best Mode<br>
A toothbrush of the present invention includes a<br>
pressure relief unit (r) which has a plate shape and a size<br>
that is sufficient to cover bristles set in a head part of<br>
the toothbrush.<br>
Hereinafter, the present invention will be described<br>
in detail with reference to the attached drawings.<br>
FIG. 2 is a perspective view of a head insert 10<br>
which is used in the present invention. The head insert 10<br>
is made of plastic and has a thickness ranging from 1. 5mm<br>
to 3.0mm. If the thickness of the head insert 10 is less<br>
than the above-mentioned range, the head insert 10 may<br>
undesirably bend during a thermal welding process. If the<br>
thickness of the head insert 10 is greater than the above-<br>
mentioned range, the head part of a toothbrush is<br>
excessively thick.<br>
The head insert 10 has through holes 11 therein so<br>
that bristles are set in the through holes 11. The through<br>
holes 11 may have different sizes, unlike conventional arts<br>
using wires. In other words, in consideration of the<br>
setting pattern of bristles, the size and shape of the<br>
through holes 11 may be appropriately adjusted.<br>
10<br>
 <br>
To set bristles in the through hole 11 of the head<br>
insert 10, first, bristles are cut to predetermined lengths<br>
and are held by a first receiving unit 20 having the shape<br>
shown in FIG. 3. Thereafter, the bristles set in the head<br>
insert 10 are transferred to a second receiving unit 30<br>
shown in FIG. 4 and, then, are transferred to the head<br>
insert 10. Here, the first receiving unit 20, the second<br>
receiving unit 30 and the head insert 10 have through holes<br>
corresponding to each other.<br>
Furthermore, because the first receiving unit 20 and<br>
the second receiving unit 30 serve to repeatedly transfer<br>
bristles (h) to head inserts 10, they must be made of metal<br>
having superior durability.<br>
A process of receiving bristles (h) into the first<br>
receiving unit 20 is as follows. The bristles (h) are<br>
received into the first receiving unit 20 by pushing the<br>
bristles (h) into the through holes 11 of the first<br>
receiving unit 20 using a pushing plate 40 (see, FIG. 5)<br>
provided with insert rods 41 having shapes corresponding to<br>
shapes of the through holes 11 of the first receiving unit<br>
20.<br>
A process of setting the bristles (h) in the head<br>
insert 10 is as follows. The first and second receiving<br>
units 20 and 30 and the head insert 10 come into contact<br>
with each other such that their through holes 11 are<br>
aligned with each other. Thereafter, the pushing plate 40<br>
11<br>
 <br>
pushes the bristles (h) , which are received in the first<br>
receiving unit 20, in the direction of the head insert 10<br>
through the second receiving unit 30 (see, FIG. 6). At this<br>
time, the bristles (h) are set in the head insert 10 such<br>
that parts of the bristles (h) protrude from a back surface<br>
of the head insert 10 by 1 to 3 mm. If the protruding<br>
length of the bristles is less than the above-mentioned<br>
range, there is difficulty in closing the through holes 11<br>
through a thermal welding process which will be explained<br>
later herein. If the protruding length of the bristles is<br>
greater than the above-mentioned range, there is a problem<br>
in that the head part of a toothbrush becomes excessively<br>
thick.<br>
After the bristles (h) are set in the head insert 10,<br>
the parts of the bristles (h) which protrude from the back<br>
surface of the head insert 10 are melted by heating and<br>
thus are fastened to the head insert 10 by partially<br>
closing the through holes 11 (see, FIG. 7) . The head insert<br>
10 which has the bristles (h) and is a semi-finished<br>
product is shown in FIG. 8.<br>
Prior to an injection molding process, a pressure<br>
relief unit (r) is layered on the back surface of the head<br>
insert 10 (which is the surface opposite to a side on which<br>
the bristles are placed) to which the bristles are fastened<br>
by thermal welding. The pressure relief unit (r) prevents<br>
resin from flowing out along the set bristles during the<br>
12<br>
 <br>
injection molding process.<br>
As shown in FIG. 9, the pressure relief unit (r) has<br>
a size smaller than the size of the head insert, but has a<br>
predetermined size that can cover all through holes 11,<br>
which are formed through the head insert. If the size of<br>
the pressure relief unit (r) is greater than the above-<br>
mentioned range, there is a problem in that the head insert<br>
10 cannot be integrated with a toothbrush body. If the size<br>
of the pressure relief unit (r) is less than the above-<br>
mentioned range, resin may undesirably flow outside through<br>
the set bristles.<br>
The pressure relief unit (r) is made of metal or<br>
synthetic resin having a melting point higher than that of<br>
bristles. Preferably, a silver plate or silvered plate is<br>
used as the material for the pressure relief unit (r). The<br>
pressure relief unit (r) made of such a silver or silvered<br>
plate prevents resin from flowing out along the bristles<br>
and, as well, has an antibacterial effect and a dental<br>
calculus prevention effect thanks to the emission of silver<br>
ions. To ensure the above-mentioned effects, it is required<br>
to form a hole (k) , which extends from the back surface of<br>
the head part to the pressure relief unit (r) (see, FIG.<br>
10).<br>
Preferably, the pressure relief unit (r) has a<br>
thickness ranging from 0.05 to 0.3mm. If the thickness of<br>
the pressure relief unit (r) is less than the above-<br>
13<br>
 <br>
mentioned range, a pressure relief effect becomes<br>
insufficient. If the thickness of the pressure relief unit<br>
(r) is greater than the above-mentioned range, the head<br>
part of the toothbrush becomes excessively thick, thus<br>
reducing tooth brushing efficiency.<br>
After the pressure relief unit (r) is layered on the<br>
back surface of the head insert 10 in which the bristles<br>
(h) are set, as shown in FIG. 11, the head insert 10 is<br>
placed in a cavity of a toothbrush forming mold using an<br>
automatic movable insertion device (s) such that the<br>
bristles (h) are placed outside the cavity of the mold.<br>
Thereafter, resin is injected into the mold, thus<br>
completing the manufacture of the toothbrush. Here, to<br>
prevent the head insert 10 having the bristles (h) from<br>
being pushed out by the injection pressure of resin, it is<br>
necessary to support the head insert 10 using a support pin<br>
(P).<br>
More preferably, as shown in FIG. 12, a holding unit<br>
(q) , which has through holes formed in the same pattern as<br>
the setting pattern of the bristles, is used in place of<br>
the support pin (p) . In this case, every bristle passes<br>
through the through holes of the holding unit (q) , and a<br>
front surface of the head insert 10 comes into close<br>
contact with the holding unit (q) . The holding unit (q)<br>
prevents the head insert 10 from being pushed out by the<br>
injection pressure and, as well, solves a problem of the<br>
14<br>
 <br>
use of the support pin (p) in that the imprint of the<br>
support pin (p) remains on the front surface of the head<br>
insert 10. Furthermore, even in the case that the holding<br>
unit (q) is integrally mounted in the lower mold, the same<br>
effect is ensured.<br>
As such, the bristles (h) , the head insert 10 and the<br>
toothbrush body are integrated together through the above-<br>
mentioned production process. Furthermore, the present<br>
invention reliably prevents resin from flowing out along<br>
the bristles (h) . The toothbrush produced according to the<br>
present invention is shown in FIG. 13.<br>
