DUAL PROCESSOR POWER SUPPLY<br>
B. RELATED APPLICATIONS AND CLAIM OF PRIORITY<br>
This application claims the priority benefit of U.S. Provisional<br>
Application no. 60/974,599 filed September 24, 2007, and U.S. Provisional<br>
Application no. 60/974,896 filed September 25, 2007, each of which are hereby<br>
incorporated by reference.<br>
C.-E. NOT APPLICABLE<br>
F. BACKGROUND<br>
This application discloses an invention that is related, generally and<br>
in various embodiments, to a power supply having a dual processor architecture and a<br>
method of using a power supply having a dual processor architecture.<br>
In certain applications, high voltage, high current power supplies<br>
utilize modular power cells to process power between a source and a load. Such<br>
modular power cells can be applied to a given power supply with various degrees of<br>
redundancy to improve the availability of the power supply. A control system may be<br>
incorporated to act as an interface between a user of the power supply, the power<br>
supply itself, and any load applied to the power supply. For example, FIG. 1<br>
illustrates various embodiments of a power supply (e.g., an AC motor drive) having<br>
nine such power cells. The power cells in FIG. 1 are represented by a block having<br>
input terminals A, B, and C; and output terminals Tl and T2. In FIG. 1, a transformer<br>
or other multi-winding device 110 receives three-phase, medium-voltage power at its<br>
primary winding 112, and delivers power to a load 130 such as a three-phase AC<br>
motor via an array of single-phase inverters (also referred to as power cells). Each<br>
phase of the power supply output is fed by a group of series-connected power cells,<br>
called herein a "phase-group".<br>
The transformer 110 includes primary windings 112 that excite a<br>
number of secondary windings 114 - 122. Although primary winding 112 is<br>
illustrated as having a star configuration, a mesh configuration is also possible.<br>
Further, although secondary windings 114 - 122 are illustrated as having a delta or an<br>
extended-delta configuration, other configurations of windings may be used as<br>
described in U. S. Patent No. 5,625,545 to Hammond, the disclosure of which is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety. In the example of FIG. 1 there is a<br>
separate secondary winding for each power cell. However, the number of power cells<br>
and/or secondary windings illustrated in FIG. 1 is merely exemplary, and other<br>
numbers are possible. Additional details about such a power supply are disclosed in<br>
U.S. Patent No. 5,625,545.<br>
Any number of ranks of power cells are connected between the<br>
transformer 110 and the load 130. A "rank" in the context of FIG. 1 is considered to<br>
be a three-phase set, or a group of three power cells established across each of the<br>
three phases of the power delivery system. Referring to FIG. 1, rank 150 includes<br>
power cells 151-153, rank 160 includes power cells 161-163, and rank 170 includes<br>
power cells 171-173. A master control system 195 sends command signals to local<br>
controls and receives status/feedback information from each cell over fiber optics or<br>
another wired or wireless communications medium 190. Similarly, communications<br>
medium 192 is used by the master control system 195 for communications with a user<br>
of the power supply. Commands may be received from the user, and any<br>
status/feedback information may be transmitted back to the user. As with<br>
communications medium 190, communications medium 192 may be fiber optics or<br>
another wired or wireless medium. It should be noted that the number of cells per<br>
phase depicted in FIG. 1 is exemplary, and more than or less than three ranks may be<br>
possible in various embodiments.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates various embodiments of a power cell 210 which is<br>
representative of various embodiments of the power cells of FIG. 1. The power cell<br>
210 includes a three-phase diode-bridge rectifier 212, one or more direct current (DC)<br>
capacitors 214, and an H-bridge inverter 216. The rectifier 212 converts the<br>
alternating current (AC) voltage received at cell input 218 (i.e., at input terminals A,<br>
B and C) to a substantially constant DC voltage that is supported by each capacitor<br>
214 that is connected across the output of the rectifier 212. The output stage of the<br>
power cell 210 includes an H-bridge inverter 216 which includes two poles, a left pole<br>
and a right pole, each with two switching devices. The inverter 216 transforms the<br>
DC voltage across the DC capacitors 214 to an AC output at the cell output 220 (i.e.,<br>
across output terminals Tl and T2) using pulse-width modulation (PWM) of the<br>
semiconductor devices in the H-bridge inverter 216.<br>
As shown in FIG. 2, the power cell 210 may also include fuses 222<br>
connected between the cell input 218 and the rectifier 212. The fuses 222 may<br>
operate to help protect the power cell 210 in the event of a short-circuit failure.<br>
According to other embodiments, the power cell 210 is identical to or similar to those<br>
described in U.S. Patent No. 5,986,909 and its derivative U.S. Patent No. 6,222,284 to<br>
Hammond and Aiello, the disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference in<br>
their entirety.<br>
Returning to FIG. 1, the master control system 195 includes a single<br>
processor which receives operational information (voltage, current, etc.) associated<br>
with the power supply, processes the information, and based on the processed<br>
information, generates commands to control the operation of the power supply.<br>
In many applications, users and/or owners of a given power supply<br>
utilize information associated with the power supply to control the operation of one or<br>
more systems external to the power supply, and also utilize information associated<br>
with the one or more systems to control the operation of the power supply. For such<br>
implementations, the processor receives and processes the operational information<br>
associated with the power supply, as well as the information associated with the one<br>
or more systems external to the power supply.<br>
For some of such applications, the single processor can still provide<br>
real time control of the power supply. However, for other applications in which there<br>
is a requirement of processing and providing of more external information, the single<br>
processor is limited in the amount of data that can be processed and provided while<br>
still maintaining real time control of the power supply.<br>
G. SUMMARY<br>
In one general respect, this application discloses a power supply. The<br>
power supply includes multiple power cells and a master control system in<br>
communication with each of the power cells. The master controller includes a control<br>
processor configured to receive power cell control information and a host in<br>
communication with the control processor wherein the host is configured to receive<br>
command and status information.<br>
In another general respect, this application discloses a method for<br>
controlling a power supply, the method including receiving drive information at a first<br>
processor of the power supply, generating a first control command based on the power<br>
cell control information, receiving command and status information at a second<br>
processor of the power supply, generating an instruction based on the command and<br>
status information, communicating the instruction to the first processor, and<br>
generating a second control command based on the instruction.<br>

I. DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
It is to be understood that at least some of the figures and descriptions<br>
of the invention have been simplified to focus on elements that are relevant for a<br>
clear understanding of the invention, while eliminating, for purposes of clarity, other<br>
elements that those of ordinary skill in the art will appreciate may also comprise a<br>
portion of the invention. However, because such elements are well known in the art,<br>
and because they do not necessarily facilitate a better understanding of the invention,<br>
a description of such elements is not provided herein.<br>
FIG. 3 illustrates various embodiments relating to a master control<br>
system in a power supply 230. The power supply 230 is similar to the multi-cell<br>
power supply of FIG. 1, but includes a different master control system 232 that<br>
overcomes the limitations of a single processor based system. As shown in FIG. 3,<br>
the master control system 232 includes a field programmable gate array (FPGA), a<br>
control processor in communication with the FPGA, an electrically programmable<br>
logic device (EPLD), and a host. The master control system 232 also includes a<br>
parallel bus, and the FPGA, the EPLD, and the host are each connected to the parallel<br>
bus.<br>
According to various embodiments, the FPGA is RAM-based and is<br>
configured for communication with one or more digital-to-analog converters (DAC),<br>
one or more an analog-to-digital converters (ADC), a power cell bypass system<br>
(Bypass), a plurality of power cells (Cell), an encoder, one or more input/output<br>
interfaces (Critical I/O), and an internal network (Drive/Drive).<br>
The digital-to-analog converter may be utilized to convert selected<br>
digital signals to analog signals. The one or more analog-to-digital converters may be<br>
utilized to convert various analog signals (e.g., voltage amplitudes, current<br>
amplitudes, cell temperatures, etc.) to digital signals. The power cell bypass system<br>
may be utilized to bypass one or more failed power cells of the power supply 230.<br>
Each power cell of the power supply 230 sends operating information to the FPGA,<br>
and receives operation commands via the FPGA. The encoder is associated with a<br>
motor (e.g., a motor being driven by the power supply), converts the rotary motion or<br>
position of the motor to a code of electronic pulses, and communicates the electronic<br>
pulses to the FPGA. The one or more input/output interfaces may be embodied, for<br>
example, as switches, potentiometers, etc., and allows a user and/or owner of the<br>
power supply 230 to define how the power supply 230 fits into a larger system. The<br>
internal network may be utilized to facilitate the interconnection of multiple power<br>
supplies.<br>
Collectively, the information to or from the DAC, each ADC, the<br>
power cell bypass system, each power cell, the encoder, each input/output interface,<br>
and the internal network may be considered ;'drive" information. This drive<br>
information may include specific information related to power cell control. In<br>
operation, the FPGA performs logic operations on the received drive information,<br>
then passes the resultant information to the control processor. The control processor<br>
receives the resultant information, processes the resultant information, and based on<br>
the processed information, generates operational commands which are passed to the<br>
FPGA for distribution to the appropriate interfaces (e.g., an interface to a given ADC,<br>
an interface to a given power cell, etc.). Essentially, the FPGA handles internal<br>
housekeeping and unique communications to the appropriate interfaces. The control<br>
processor may be embodied as a digital signal processor, and together with the FPGA,<br>
provides functionality to control the load (e.g., a motor). As shown in FIG. 3, the<br>
control processor may be configured for communication with flash memory and/or<br>
random access memory (RAM).<br>
According to various embodiments, the EPLD is in communication<br>
with one or more communication modules (e.g., Network 1, Network 2, etc.), a<br>
memory device (NVRAM), and one or more ASCII serial devices (e.g., MODBUS,<br>
PROFIBUS, etc.). The EPLD is embodied as a flash device. The communication<br>
modules may be utilized to allow the power supply to communicate using standard<br>
communication protocols. The memory device is a non-volatile memory device, and<br>
may be utilized to store information (e.g., parameters, history, etc.) which the user<br>
and/or owner do not want to be lost when power is lost. The one or more serial<br>
interfaces allows the EPLD to communicate over a variety of different field buses.<br>
According to various embodiments, the host includes a processor<br>
mounted to a printed circuit board. The host is configured for communication with a<br>
compact flash device, a user I/O interface, an Ethernet interface, a video graphics<br>
array (VGA) interface, a keypad interface, and one or more USB interfaces.<br>
Collectively, the respective interfaces may be considered "non-drive" interfaces.<br>
Collectively, any information received from these interfaces may be considered "non-<br>
drive" information or command and status information.<br>
The compact flash device may be utilized to store programs executed<br>
by the host. The user I/O may allow a user to request and/or provide information to<br>
the host. Such information may include, for example, a status query, configuration of<br>
power supply parameters, log information, etc. The Ethernet interface may be<br>
embodied as, for example, an RJ45 Ethernet connector, and may be utilized to allow<br>
the host to communicate with a device connected thereto. The VGA interface may be<br>
embodied as, for example, a DB 15 video connector, and may be utilized to drive a<br>
given display connected thereto. The keypad interface may be embodied as, for<br>
example, an RS485 interface, and may be utilized to allow the host to communicate<br>
with a keypad connected thereto. The one or more USB interfaces may be utilized to<br>
allow the host to communicate with one or more devices connected thereto. For<br>
example, according to various embodiments, the host may utilize the USB interfaces<br>
to communicate with a USB mouse, a USB keyboard, a USB jump drive, etc.<br>
In operation, the host receives and/or provides the command and<br>
status information, executes system programs, controls the non-drive interfaces,<br>
controls the modules/devices connected to the EPLD, and communicates information<br>
to the control processor via the parallel bus and the FPGA. The information provided<br>
to the control processor may subsequently result in the control processor generating<br>
an operation command which produces a change in the operation of the power supply.<br>
Such information may include for example, an indication of the number of power<br>
cells in the power supply 230, an indication of how many power cells can be<br>
bypassed, an instruction to change the acceleration of a motor connected to the power<br>
supply 230 when the motor reaches a particular speed, etc. In contrast to the control<br>
processor, the host does not provide motor control functionality.<br>
According to various embodiments, as shown in FIG. 3, the master<br>
control system 232 may further include a universal serial bus (USB) client connected<br>
to the parallel bus. The USB client may be utilized to interface tools which run on a<br>
separate personal computer connected thereto. For example, a field service technician<br>
may utilize the USB client to interface diagnostic tools to the master control system<br>
232.<br>
FIG. 4 illustrates various embodiments of a method 300 for<br>
controlling a power supply. For purposes of simplicity, the method 300 will be<br>
described in the context of its use with the power supply 230.<br>
The process begins at block 310, where power cell control (or<br>
"drive") information is received by the FPGA. From block 310, the process advances<br>
to block 320, where the FPGA performs a logic operation on the power cell control<br>
information and communicates the operated on power cell control information to the<br>
control processor. From block 320, the process advances to block 330, where the<br>
control processor processes the operated on power cell control information, and<br>
generates a control command based thereon. From block 330, the process advances to<br>
block 340, where the control command is communicated to a power cell via the<br>
FPGA. From block 340, the process advances to block 350, where the power cell<br>
receives the control command, and changes its operation based thereon.<br>
From block 350, the process advances to block 360, where the host<br>
receives command and status (or "non-drive") information. From block 360, the<br>
process advances to block 370, where the host processes the command and status<br>
information, and generates an instruction based on the processed command and status<br>
information. From block 370, the process advances to block 380, where the<br>
instruction is communicated to the control processor via the parallel bus and the<br>
FPGA. From block 380, the process advances to block 330 where the same process<br>
as discussed above with respect to blocks 330,340 and 350 repeats. A control<br>
command is generated at block 330 based upon the command and status information.<br>
According to various embodiments, the second control command may simply be a<br>
modification of the control command generated at block 330 based upon the power<br>
cell control information, or may be an entirely different control command. From<br>
block 330, the process advances to block 340, where the second control command is<br>
communicated to at least one power cell via the FPGA. From block 340, the process<br>
advances to block 350, where the at least one power cell receives the second control<br>
command, and changes its operation based thereon.<br>
Although the method 300 is described in the context of a sequential<br>
process, it will be appreciated that the described sequence may vary, and some steps<br>
of the process may be performed concurrently and/or simultaneously. For example,<br>
when the FPGA is receiving the power cell control information at block 310, the host<br>
may also be receiving the command and status information at block 360.<br>
Therefore, while several embodiments of the invention have been<br>
described herein by way of example, those skilled in the art will appreciate that<br>
various modifications, alterations, and adaptions to the described embodiments may<br>
be realized without departing from the spirit and scope of the invention defined by the<br>
