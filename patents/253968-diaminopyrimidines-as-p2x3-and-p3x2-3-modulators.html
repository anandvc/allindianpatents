This invention pertains to compounds useful for treatment of diseases associated with P2X purinergic receptors, and more particularly to P2X3 and/or P2X2/3antagonists usable for treatment of genitourinary, pain, gastrointestinal and respiratory diseases, conditions and<br>
disorders.<br>
The urinary bladder is responsible for two important physiological functions: urine storage and urine emptying. This process involves two main steps: (1) the bladder fills progressively until the tension in its walls rises above a threshold level; and (2) a nervous reflex, called the micturition reflex, occurs that empties the bladder or, if this fails, at least causes a conscious desire to urinate. Although the micturition reflex is an autonomic spinal cord reflex, it can also be inhibited or mediated by centers in the cerebral cortex or brain.<br>
Purines, acting via extracellular purinoreceptors, have been implicated as having a variety of physiological and pathological roles. (See, Burnstock (1993) Drug Dev, Res. 28:195-206.) ATP, and to a lesser extent, adenosine, can stimulate sensory nerve endings resulting in intense pain and a pronounced increase in sensory nerve discharge. ATP receptors have been classified into two major families, the P2Y- and P2X-purinoreceptors, on the basis of molecular structure, transduction mechanisms, and pharmacological characterization. The P2Y-purinoreceptors are G-protein coupled receptors, while the P2X-purinoreceptors are a family of ATP-gated cation channels. Purinergic receptors, in particular, P2X receptors, are known to form homomultimers or heteromultimers. To date, cDNAs for several P2X receptor subtypes have been cloned, including: six homomeric receptors, P2Xi; P2X2; P2X3; P2X4; P2X5; and P2X7; and three heteromeric receptors P2X2/3, P2X4/6, P2Xi,5 (Sec, e.g., Chen et al. (1995) Nature 377:428-431; Lewis et al. (1995) Nature 377:432-435; and Burnstock (1997) Neurophamacol. 36:1127-1139). The structure and chromosomal mapping of mouse genomic P2X3 receptor subunit has also been described (Souslova et al. (1997) Gene 195:101-111). In vitro, co-expression of P2X2 and P2X3 receptor subunits is necessary to produce ATP-gated currents with the properties seen in some sensory neurons (Lewis et al. (1995) Nature 377:432-435).<br>
P2X receptor subunits are found on afferents in rodent and human bladder urothelium. Data exists suggesting that ATP may be released from epithelial/endothelial cells of the urinary bladder or other hollow organs as a result of distention (Burnstock (1999) J. Anatomy 194:335-342; and Ferguson et al. (1997) J. Physiol. 505:503-511). ATP released in<br><br>
this manner may serve a role in conveying information to sensory neurons located in subepithelial components, e.g., suburothelial lamina propria (Namasivayam et al. (1999) BJU Intl. 84:854-860). The P2X receptors have been studied in a number of neurons, including sensory, sympathetic, parasympathetic, mesenteric, and central neurons (Zhong et al. (1998) Br. J. Pharmacol. 125:771-781). These studies indicate that purinergic receptors play a role in afferent neurotransmission from the bladder, and that modulators of P2X receptors are potentially useful in the treatment of bladder disorders and other genitourinary diseases or conditions.<br>
Recent evidence also suggests a role of endogenous ATP and purinergic receptors in nociceptive responses in mice (Tsuda et al. (1999) Br. J. Pharmacol. 128:1497-1504). ATP-induced activation of P2X receptors on dorsal root ganglion nerve terminals in the spinal cord has been shown to stimulate release of glutamate, a key neurotransmitter involved in nociceptive signaling (Gu and MacDermott, Nature 389:749-753 (1997)). P2X_-% receptors have been identified on nociceptive neurons in the tooth pulp (Cook et al., Nature 387:505-508 (1997)). ATP released from damaged cells may thus lead to pain by activating P2X3 and/or P2X2/3 containing receptors on nociceptive sensory nerve endings. This is consistent with the induction of pain by intradermally applied ATP in the human blister-base model (Bleehen, Br J Pharmacol 62:573-577 (1978)). P2X antagonists have been shown to be analgesic in animal models (Driessen and Starke, Naunyn Schmiedebergs Arch Pharmacol 350:618-625 (1994)). This evidence suggests that P2X2 and P2X3 are involved in nociception, and that modulators of P2X receptors are potentially useful as analgesics.<br>
Other researchers have shown that P2X3 receptors are expressed in human colon, and are expressed at higher levels in inflamed colon than in normal colon (Yiangou et al, Neuro-gastroenterol Mot (2001) 13:365-69). Other researchers have implicated the P2X3 receptor in detection of distension or intraluminal pressure in the intestine, and initiation of reflex contractions (Bian et al, J Physiol (2003) 551,1:309-22), and have linked this to colitis (Wynn et al., Am J Physiol Gastrointest Liver Physiol (2004) 287:G647-57).<br>
Inge Brouns et al. {Am J Respir Cell Mol Biol (2000) 23:52-61) found that P2X* receptors are expressed in pulmonary neuroepithelial bodies (NEBs), implicating the receptor in pain transmission in the lung. More recently, others have implicated P2X2 and P2X^<br><br>
receptors in pC&gt;2 detection in pulmonary NEBs (Rong et ah, J Neurosci (2003) 23(36):11315-21).<br>
There is accordingly a need for methods of treating diseases, conditions and disorders mediated by P2X3 and/or P2X2/3 receptors, as well as a need for compounds that act as modulators of P2X receptors, including antagonists of P2Xj and P2X2/3 receptors. The present invention satisfies these needs as well as others.<br><br>

When desired, formulations can be prepared with enteric coatings adapted for sustained or controlled release administration of the active ingredient. For example, the compounds of the present invention can be formulated in transdermal or subcutaneous drug delivery devices. These delivery systems are advantageous when sustained release of the compound is necessary and when patient compliance with a treatment regimen is crucial. Compounds in transdermal delivery systems are frequently attached to an skin-adhesive solid support. The compound of interest can also be combined with a penetration enhancer, e.g., Azone (l-dodecylazacycloheptan-2-one). Sustained release delivery<br><br>
systems are inserted subcutaneously into the subdermal layer by surgery or injection* The subdermal implants encapsulate the compound in a lipid soluble membrane, e.g., silicone rubber, or a biodegradable polymer, e.g., polylactic acid.<br>
The pharmaceutical preparations are preferably in unit dosage forms. In such form, the preparation is subdivided into unit doses containing appropriate quantities of the active component. The unit dosage form can be a packaged preparation, the package containing discrete quantities of preparation, such as packeted tablets, capsules, and powders in vials or ampoules. Also, the unit dosage form can be a capsule, tablet, cachet, or lozenge itself, or it can be the appropriate number of any of these in packaged form.<br>

Example 8:    P2X3/P2X2/3 FLIPR (Fluorometric Imaging Plate Reader) Assay<br>
CHO-K1 cells were transfected with cloned rat P2X3 or human P2X2/3 receptor subunits and passaged in flasks, 18-24 hours before the FLIPR experiment, cells were released from their flasks, centrifuged, and resuspended in nutrient medium at 2.5 x 10s cells/ml. The cells were aliquoted into black-walled 96-well plates at a density of 50,000 cells/well and incubated overnight in 5% C02 at 37°C. On the day of the experiment, cells were washed in FLIPR buffer (calcium- and magnesium-free Hank's balanced salt solution, 10 mM HEPES, 2 mM CaCl2, 2.5 mM probenecid; FB). Each well received 100 |al FB and 100 ^1 of the fluorescent dye Fluo-3 AM [2 \xM final cone*]. After a 1 hour dye loading incubation at 37°C, the cells were washed 4 times with FB, and a final 75 (xl/well FB was left in each well.<br>
Test compounds (dissolved in DMSO at 10 mM and serially diluted with FB) or vehicle were added to each well (25 fxl of a 4X solution) and allowed to equilibrate for 20 min at RT. The plates were then placed in the FLIPR and a baseline fluorescence measurement<br><br>
(excitation at 488 nm and emission at 510-570 nm) was obtained for 10 seconds before a 100 ^I/well agonist or vehicle addition. The agonist was a 2X solution of a,P-meATP producing a final concentration of 1 |xM (P2X3) or 5 (xM (P2X2/3)- Fluorescence was measured for an additional 2 min at 1 second intervals after agonist addition. A final addition of ionomycin (5 MM, final concentration) was made to each well of the FLIPR test plate to establish cell viability and maximum fluorescence of dye-bound cytosolic calcium. Peak fluorescence in response to the addition of a,p-meATP (in the absence and presence of test compounds) was measured and inhibition curves generated using nonlinear regression. PPADS, a standard P2X antagonist, was used as a positive control. Using the above procedure, compounds of the invention exhibited activity for the P2X$ receptor. The compound 5-(7-Isopropyl-quinolin-6-yloxy)-pyrimidine-234-diamine, for example, exhibited a pIC&gt;o of approximately 7.42 for the P2X3 receptor, and approximately 7.30 for the P2X2/3 receptor, using the above assay.<br>
Example 9:    In vivo Assay for Asthma and Lung Function<br>
BALb/cJ mice are immunized with a standard immunization protocol. Briefly, mice (N=8/group) are immunized i.p. with ovalbumin (OVA; 10 jag) in alum on days 0 and 14. Mice are then challenged with aerosolized OVA (5%) on day 21 and 22. Animals receive vehicle (p.o.) or a compound of the invention (100 mg/kg p.o.) all starting on day 20. Lung function is evaluated on day 23 using the Buxco system to measure PenH in response to an aerosol methacholine challenge. Mice are then euthanized and plasma samples collected at the end of the study.<br>
Example 10:  Volume Induced Bladder Contraction Assay<br>
Female Sprague-Dawley rats (200-300g) were anesthetized with urethane (1.5 g/kg, sc). The animals were tracheotomized, and a carotid artery and femoral vein were cannulated for blood pressure measurement and drug administration, respectively. A laparotomy was performed and the ureters were ligated and transected proximal to the ligation. The external urethral meatus was ligated with silk suture and the urinary bladder was cannulated via the dome for saline infusion and bladder pressure measurement.<br>
Following a 15-30 min stabilization period the bladder was infused with RT saline at 100 jal/min until continuous volume-induced bladder contractions (VIBCs) were observed. The<br><br>
infusion rate was then lowered to 3-5 (xl/min for 30 min before the bladder was drained and allowed to rest for 30 min. All subsequent infusions were performed as indicated except the lower infusion rate was maintained for only 15 min instead of 30 min* Bladder filling and draining cycles were repeated until the threshold volumes (TV; the volume needed to trigger the first micturition bladder contraction) varied by less than 10% for two consecutive baselines and contraction frequency was within 2 contractions for a 10 minute period following the slower infusion rate. Once reproducible TVs and VIBCs were established the bladder was drained and the animal was dosed with drug or vehicle (0.5 ml/kg, i/v.) 3 min prior to the start of the next scheduled infusion.<br>
Example 11:  Formalin Pain Assay<br>
Male Sprague Dawley rats (180-220 g) are placed in individual Plexiglas cylinders and allowed to acclimate to the testing environment for 30 min. Vehicle, drug or positive control (morphine 2 mg/kg) is administered subcutaneously at 5 ml/kg. 15 min post dosing, formalin (5% in 50 /u\) is injected into plantar surface of the right hind paw using a 26-gauge needle. Rats are immediately put back to the observation chamber, Mirrors placed around the chamber allow unhindered observation of the formalin-injected paw. The duration of nociphensive behavior of each animal is recorded by a blinded observer using an automated behavioral timer* Hindpaw licking and shaking / lifting are recorded separately in 5 min bin, for a total of 60 min. The sum of time spent licking or shaking in seconds from time 0 to 5 min is considered the early phase&gt; whereas the late phase is taken as the sum of seconds spent licking or shaking from 15 to 40 min. A plasma sample is collected.<br>
Example 12:  Colon Pain Assay<br>
Adult male Sprague-Dawley rats (350-425 g; Harlan, Indianapolis, IN) are housed 1-2 per cage in an animal care facility. Rats are deeply anesthetized with pentobarbital sodium (45 mg/kg) administered intraperitoneally. Electrodes are placed and secured into the external oblique musculature for electromyographic (EMG) recording. Electrode leads are tunneled subcutaneously and exteriorized at the nape of the neck for future access. After surgery, rats are housed separately and allowed to recuperate for 4-5 days prior to testing. The descending colon and rectum are distended by pressure-controlled inflation of a 7-8 cm-long flexible latex balloon tied around a flexible tube. The balloon is lubricated, in-<br><br>
serted into the colon via the anus, and anchored by taping the balloon catheter to the base of the tail. Colorectal distension (CRD) is achieved by opening a solenoid gate to a constant pressure air reservoir, Intracolonic pressure is controlled and continuously monitored by a pressure control device. Response is quantified as the visceromotor response (VMR), a contraction of the abdominal and hindlimb musculature. EMG activity produced by contraction of the external oblique musculature is quantified using Spike2 software (Cambridge Electronic Design). Each distension trial lasts 60 sec, and EMG activity is quantified for 20 sec before distension (baseline), during 20 sec distension, and 20 sec after distention. The increase in total number of recorded counts during distension above baseline is defined as the response. Stable baseline responses to CRD (10, 20, 40 and 80 mmHg, 20 seconds, 4 min apart) are obtained in conscious, unsedated rats before any treatment.<br>
Compounds are evaluated for effects on responses to colon distension initially in a model of acute visceral nociception and a model of colon hypersensitivity produced by intracolonic treatment with zymosan (1 mL, 25 mg/mL) instilled into the colon with a gavage needle inserted to a depth of about 6 cm. Experimental groups will consist of 8 rats each* Acute visceral nociception: For testing effects of drug on acute visceral nociception, 1 of 3 doses of drug, vehicle or positive control (morphine, 2.5 mg/kg) are administered after baseline responses are established; responses to distension are followed over the next 60-90 min.<br>
Visceral hypersensitivity: For testing effects of drug or vehicle after intracolonic treatment with zymosan, intracolonic treatment is given after baseline responses are established. Prior to drug testing at 4 hours, responses to distension are assessed to establish the presence of hypersensitivity. In zymosan-treated rats, administration of 1 of 3 doses of drug, vehicle or positive control (morphine, 2.5 mg/kg) are given 4 hours after zymosan treatment and responses to distension followed over the next 60-90 min.<br>
Example 13:  Cold allodynia in Rats with a Chronic Constriction Injury of the Sciatic Nerve<br>
The effects of compounds of this invention on cold allodynia are determined using the chronic constriction injury (CCI) model of neuropathic pain in rats, where cold allodynia<br><br>
is measured in a cold-water bath with a metal-plate floor and water at a depth of 1,5-2.0 cm and a temperature of 3~4°C (Gogas et al., Analgesia, 1997, 3,1-8)* Specifically, CCI, rats are anesthetized; the trifurcation of the sciatic nerve is located and 4 ligatures (4-0, or 5-0 chromic gut) are placed circumferentially around the sciatic nerve proximal to the trifurcation. The rats are then allowed to recover from the surgery. On days 4-7 after surgery, the rats are initially assessed for cold-induced allodynia by individually placing the animals in the cold-water bath and recording the total lifts of the injured paw during a 1-min period of time: The injured paw is lifted out of the water. Paw lifts associated with locomotion or body repositioning are not recorded. Rats that displayed 5 lifts per min or more on day 4-7 following surgery are considered to exhibit cold allodynia and are used in subsequent studies. In the acute studies, vehicle, reference compound or compounds of this invention are administered subcutaneously (s*c.) 30 min before testing. The effects of repeated administration of the compounds of this invention on cold allodynia are determined 14, 20 or 38 h following the last oral dose of the following regimen: oral (p.o.) administration of vehicle, reference or a compound of this invention at -12 h intervals (BID) for 7 days.<br>
Example 14:  Cancer Bone Pain in C3H/HeJ Mice<br>
The effects of compounds of this invention on bone pain are determined between Day 7 to Day 18 following intramedullary injection of 2472 sarcoma cells into the distal femur of C3H/HeJ mice.<br>
Specifically, NCTC 2472 tumor cells (American Type Culture Collection, ATCC), previously shown to form lytic lesions in bone after intramedullary injection, are grown and maintained according to ATCC recommendations.
