				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>The present invention relates to an arrangement for forming and lifting parcels.<br>
The present invention relates fo means for forming parcels of goods comprising a lifting and load carrying means that can be lifted by a lifting device. In particular the invention relates to improved means for forming large parcels or packages of at least two units of goods.<br>
The Applicant's own patent application WO 98/26977 discloses a lifting belt that surrounds one pair of stacks of units of goods, where the belt is in the form of a closed loop having a width substantially equal to the transverse width of the stacks.  The belt is formed into a closed loop comprising a suspension loop for lifting the parcel. For joining belt ends there is proposed different methods such as sewing, application of various types of glue and hot melt. The lifting eye is formed by slitting an opening in said belt in the area just above the two self-clamping stacks of bags where an opening is provided in the belt for pulling the belt through, and then forming a loop. In this application there is suggested that the belt may constitute of any cloth material having the required strength. Such materia] could be polypropylene, polyethylene, jute etc. and even paper.<br>
One problem related to the above mentioned solution is that as a consequence of the load may become swinging in dynamic load handling conditions or by otherwise rough/skew handling, transverse tearing forces may occur in the vincinity of the slit in the belt where the loop is pulled through the belt. In case of a severe rupture of the band, the parcel may become unstable and thus the handling operation should be cancelled.<br>
One object of the invention is to provide a mean? for forming and lifting parcel where the above mentioned problems can be reduced or in some situations be avoided. In accordance with the present invention the mearis is provided with reinforcements that will oppose tearing forces that may occur in lifting or handling conditions.<br>
GB 1463055 discloses a sling intended to surround two units of goods where its ends can be joined by means of one or more bridging pieces allowing a lifting loop to pass through it. This solution implies that the sling have to be joined in the region where the lifting loop is arranged, and<br><br><br>
followingly, the joint can be disposed to unwanted high forces in dynamic or skew handling situati-ons. The sling can be reinforced at its free ends to which the bridging pieces are attached in order to prevent the material splitting in this region. These reinforcements are arranged in the transversal direction of the sling.<br>
The applicant now see a potential for making improvements to prior art constructions. In particular, the lifting means in the form of one or more bands can be adapted in an manner where plural advan-tages occur. With the present invention the band can be adapted to suit the force distribution in lifting operations in a more precise manner than that disclosed in the prior art. In accordance with<br><br>
the invention there can be arranged at least one symmetrically reinforcement in the longitudinal direction of the band at critical regions, such as at the outermost sides thereof and/or at the central mid-section while the band can be of less dimensions in other transverse regions. In accordance with the invention there can be gained overall-savings in material costs related to the band while at the same time security and stability of the load can be improved.<br>
In accordance with the present invention it is now possible to handle goods comprising at least one pair of stacks or units of goods surrounded by at least one load carrying band, where the band has provisions to stabilize and reinforce the band in a symmetrical manner with respect to the opening through which the loop/lifting eye is formed. This feature will imply improved stability of the parcel in handling situations and reduced risk for tearing of the band in the regions of the slit. Further, in accordance with the invention there can be arranged reinforcements at strategic locations in the transverse direction of the band such as at the outer side regions of the band or at the central raid-section of the band, while the band in an embodiment can be of relatively reduced strength and thickness outside the reinforcements. Reinforcements at the outermost sides of the band will contri-bute to improved overall stability of the parcels, and thus reduce the risk of transversal movements of the loop and the lifting eye with respect to the slit throug which the loop is passed. Reinforce-ments at the region of the slit itself will more directly strengthen the band against rupture in this region.<br>
These and further advantages may be achieved in accordance with the invention as defined in accor-dance with the accompanying claims and which relates to means for forming and lifting parcels comprising at least two stacks or units of goods comprising at least one load carrying band that is arranged to surround the stacks in a manner where it follows the outer periphery of the stacks thus forming a parcel, and where a loop of the band is arranged to protrude upwards in an intermediate space between the stacks and further through an opening in an upper part of the band to form a lifting eye above said stacks, and where the load carrying band comprises at least one reinforcement that is symmetrically arranged with respect to the central length axis of the band.<br>
In the following the present invention will be further described by examples and figures where:<br>
Fig. la       shows a load carrying band with one reinforcement in accordance with the present invention,<br><br>
Fig. 1b       is a sketch showing the load carrying band of Figure la forming a loop that can surround two units of goods, seen in a perspective view,<br>
Fig. 2a       shows a load carrying band with reinforcements at its outermost sides in accordance with the present invention,<br>
Fig. 2b       is a sketch showing the load carrying band of Figure 2a forming a loop that can surround two units of goods, seen in a perspective view,<br>
Fig, 3a       shows a load carrying band with two reinforcements close to the central length axis of the band in accordance with the present invention,<br>
Fig, 3b       is a sketch showing the load carrying band of Figure 3a forming a loop mat can surround two units of goods, seen in a perspective view.<br>
In figure la there is shown a band 1 stored on a spool 2. The band is provided with one reinforcement 3 arranged symmetrically with respect to the central longitudinal axis of the band.<br>
In figure Ib there is shown the same band as in figure la where it is arranged to surround two stacks or units of goods (not shown). The stacks may comprise piles of sacks or any other type of load that can be surrounded by a band 1, thus forming a parcel P, a loop 14 and a lifting eye 15. The band itself is symmetrically arranged with respect to the parcels, and the lifting eye protrudes the band in its middle transversal region. The lifting eye can be pleated and surrounded by a sleeve 16.<br>
The band 2 is preferably of a width appropriate for securing the load in a satisfactory manner. It should be understood that the band 2 can be applied as a endless loop where it is made out of pre-cut lengths where the ends of the band are joined by an appropriate joining operation such as sewing, glueing, welding or the like. Alternatively, the joining operation may be performed in situ by appropriate machinery. The joint is indicated as reference numeral 4 in the figure.<br>
As seen in the Figure, the lifting eye protrudes the upper part 11of the band 1 through a slit 5. The centrally arranged reinforcement 3 is that wide that it will reinforce the sides of the slit. It should be understood that the reinforcement is slitted before the loop is entered in a manner that it will cover both sides of the slit.<br><br>
In figure 2a there is shown a band 101 stored on a spool 102. The band is provided with reinforcements 103, 104 at its outermost sides and further symmetrically arranged with respect to the central longitudinal axis of the band.<br>
In figure 2b there is shown the same band as in figure 2a where the band is arranged to surround two stacks or units of goods (not shown). The stacks may comprise piles of sacks or any other type of load that can be surrounded by a band 101, thus forming a parcel P1, a loop 114 and a lifting eye 115. The lifting eye can be pleated and reinforced by a sleeve 116.<br>
The band 101 is preferably of a width appropriate for securing the load in a satisfactory manner. Preferably the width of the band is similar to that of the load. It should be understood that the band 101 can be applied as a endless loop where it is made out of pre-cut lengths where the ends of the band are joined by an appropriate joining operation such as sewing, glueing, welding or the like. Alternatively, the joining operation may be performed in situ by appropriate machinery. The joint is indicated as reference numeral 106 in the figure.<br>
As seen in the figure, the lifting eye protrudes through the upper part 101' of the band 101 through a slit 105. The symmetrically arranged reinforcements 103, 104 at the outermost sides of the band will in lifting/handling operations contribute to improvements in stability caused among other reasons by the triangular force distribution from the lifting eye and downwards to the bottom part of the load. This yoke-like distribution of forces will be advantagous and give the parcel a self-stabi-lising nature. For some type of loads the band may be wider than the load itself and this implicates that the band has a width positively wider than the width of the load. In this manner the protruding part of the band will tend to fold inwards against the front- and back sides of the load and consequently the goods will be well secured against falling out of the load carrying band. In the handling operations for forming the load carrying band around at least two parcels of goods, this solution having additional reinforcements at the transverse ends of the band will be more easy to handle through the packaging machinery because there will be little risk of skew-tracking and mal-align-ment of the band in the machinery.<br>
In figure 3a there is shown a band 201 stored on a spool 202. The band is provided with symmetri-cal reinforcements 203, 204 at each side of its central longitudinal axis, and close to the same.<br>
In figure 3b there is shown the same band as in figure 3a where the band is arranged to surround two stacks or units of goods (not shown). The stacks may comprise piles of sacks or any other type<br><br>
of load that can be surrounded by the band 201, thus forming a parcel P11, a loop 214 and a lifting eye 215. The lifting eye can be pleated and reinforced by a sleeve 216.<br>
The band 201 is preferably of a width appropriate for securing the load in a satisfactory manner. Thus, the width of the band can be similar to that of the load. It should be understood that the band 201 can be applied as a endless loop where it is made out of pre-cut lengths where the ends of the band are joined by an appropriate joining operation such as sewing, glueing, welding or the like. Alternatively, the joining operation may be performed in situ by appropriate machinery. The joint is indicated as reference numeral 204 in the figure.<br>
As seen in the Figure, the lifting eye protrudes through the upper part 201' of the band 201 through a slit 205. The symmetrically arranged reinforcements 203, 204 at the sides of the slit will in lifting/handling operations contribute to improvements in stability and to reduce the risk of rupture of the upper part of the band 201' in the area of the slit.<br>
The band in accordance with the invention can be of any suitable material such as polyethylene, polypropylene, any appropriate plastic material, paper, jute etc. The band may be constituted of any type of material such as a homogenous band with additional reinforcing elements, a net, woven fabric or knitted band with the appropriate reinforcements. A suitable band can be made out of different materials to imply both elastic and deformable (ductile) properties to give the best fit for the actual application. Further, the embodiments as shown above are not intended to limit the scope of the protection. Thus, any combination of symmetrically distributed reinforcements can be applied in accordance with the invention. For instance the baud can be reinforced at its sides together with a centrally arranged reinforcement or alternatively by the application of two centrally reinforcements.<br>
In case the load carrying band is made out of a material having longitudinal filaments, the longitudinal filaments in the band can be arranged in a more dense manner in the region where the reinforcements are desired. In case only one reinforcement is applied, this is applied in a symmetrical manner with respect to the longitudinal axis of the band and hence it is located to the region where the slit is formed thus covering both sides of the slit.<br>
It should be understood that the reinforcements may be constituted by additional bands or the similar attached to the band hi an appropriate manner and appropriate locations. Such reinforcements may be of any appropriate band material that may be fixed to the load carrying band by<br><br>
appropriate methods such as hot melt, glue, sewing or the similar. This can easily be carried out in case the band is made out of polypropylene or paper or the similar.<br>
In a band made out of a woven material the reinforcements may comprise that the lengthwise filaments in the looming are arranged in a more dense manner at the locations where reinforcements are desired. In a knitled material the reinforcements may be provided by making the knitting more tight at the locations to be reinforced<br>
It should be understood that the reinforcements can be provided by folding the band at appropriate locations, thus forming one or more additional layers of the band where the band is to be reinforced. Such folds can further be secured against separation by means similar to that of the joining of the ends, i.e. by sewing, glueing, welding or the like. In some applications there will be sufficient just to press the folded edge to keep the fold closed.<br>
The reinforcement may be continuous or non-continous in the longitudinal direction of the band. In case the length of each piece of band forming a loop is known at the production stage of the band, the reinforcement can be applied at the regions corresponding to the required degree of reinforcement. For instance, in case the band is just reinforced in the central region to reinforce the band at the area of the slit a short piece of reinforcement can be applied just at this section. Such reinforcement may be provided by any appropriate material fixed to the band at this location. It should be understood however that in addition there may be applied continuous reinforcements at each outermost side of the band.<br>
Similar to that given above, appropriate reinforcements can be arranged to give the lifting eye desired properties. For instance, there can be arranged non-continuous reinforcements at the area of the band corresponding to that which will form part of the loop and the lifting eye. In this area there can be added reinforcements to distribute lifting forces and/or to withstand mechanical wear. Further, such reinforcements can have elastic and/or plastic properties such that the lifting eye will stand upraised above the parcel and thus make the entrance of a lifting hook easier.<br>
The above mentioned embodiments deal with a single load carrying band having different configurations of reinforcements. However, it shall be understood that the lifting means may comprise plural load carrying bands that may overlap with their side regions or be physically integrated with each other in some appropriate manner and still make profit of the inventive concept. For instance, in one not shown embodiment comprising two bands arranged to overlap with their mutual side<br><br>
edges thus forming one resulting composite band having a central lengthwise joint, additional reinforcements still can be provided symmetrically with respect to the central length axis of that band in accordance with the invention. In this specific embodiment the reinforcement may be constituted by the ovelapping joint itself. The similar will apply to other multiply of overlapping/physically integrated bands.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
