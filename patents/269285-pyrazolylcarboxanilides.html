Plant-strengthening (resistance-inducing) substances are understood as meaning, in the present context, those substances which are capable of stimulating the defence system of plants in such a way that, when subsequently inoculated with undesired microorganisms, the treated plants display a substantial degree of resistance to these microorganisms.<br>
In the present case, undesired microorganisms are understood as meaning phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and viruses. Thus, the substances according to the invention can be employed for protecting plants against attack by the abovementioned pathogens within a certain period of time after the treatment. The period of time within which their protection is effected is generally extended from 1 to 10 days, preferably 1 to 7 days, after the plants have been treated with the active compounds.<br>
The fact that the active compounds, at the concentrations required for the controlling of plant diseases, are well tolerated by plants permits the treatment of aerial plant parts, of vegetative propagation material and seed, and of the soil.<br>
In this context, the active compounds according to the invention can be employed particularly successfully for controlling cereal diseases such as, for example, against Puccinia species and of diseases in viticulture, fruit production and vegetable production such as, for example against Botrytis,<br><br>
Venturia or Alternaria species.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention are also suitable for increasing the yield. Moreover, they display a low degree of toxicity and are well tolerated by plants.<br>
If appropriate, the active compounds according to the invention can also be used in certain concentrations and application rates as herbicides, for influencing plant growth and for controlling animal pests. If appropriate, they can also be employed as intermediates and precursors for the synthesis of further active compounds.<br>
All plants and plant parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. Plants are understood as meaning, in the present context, all plants and plant populations, such as desired and undesired wild plants or crop plants (including naturally occurring crop plants). Crop plants may be plants which can be obtained by conventional breeding and optimization methods or else by biotechnological and genetic engineering methods or by combinations of these methods, including the transgenic plants and including the plant varieties capable or not capable of being protected by Plant Breeders' rights. Plant parts are understood as meaning all aerial and subterranean plants and organs of the plants, such as shoot, leaf, flower and root, examples which may be mentioned being leaves, needles, stalks, stems, flowers, fruiting bodies, fruits and seeds, and also roots, tubers and rhizomes. The plant parts also include harvested material and vegetative and generative propagation material, for example cuttings, tubers, rhizomes, slips and seeds.<br>
The treatment according to the invention with the active compounds, of the plants and plant parts, is carried out directly or by acting on their environment, habitat, or store by the customary treatment methods, for example by immersion, spraying, vaporizing, fogging, broadcasting, painting on and, in the case of propagation material, in particular in the case of seeds, furthermore by coating with one or more coats.<br>
In the protection of materials, the substances according to the invention can be employed for protecting industrial materials against attack and destruction by undesired microorganisms.<br>
In the present context, industrial materials are understood as meaning non live materials which have been made for use in technology. For example, industrial materials which are to be protected by active compounds according to the invention from microbial modification or destruction can be glues, sizes, paper and board, textiles, leather, timber, paints and plastic articles, cooling lubricants and other materials which are capable of being attacked or destroyed by microorganisms. Parts of<br><br>
production plants, for example cooling-water circuits, which can be adversely affected by the multiplication of microorganisms may also be mentioned within the materials to be protected. Industrial materials which may be mentioned with preference for the purposes of the present invention are glues, sizes, paper and board, leather, timber, paints, cooling lubricants and heat-transfer fluids, especially preferably wood.<br>
Microorganisms which are capable of bringing about a degradation or modification of the industrial materials and which may be mentioned are, for example, bacteria, fungi, yeasts, algae and slime organisms. The active compounds according to the invention are preferably active against fungi, in particular moulds, wood-discolouring and wood-destroying fungi (Basidiomycetes) and against slime organisms and algae.<br>
Examples which may be mentioned are microorganisms of the following genera:<br>
Alternaria such as Alternaria tenuis,<br>
Aspergillus such as Aspergillus niger,<br>
Chaetomium such as Chaetomium globosum,<br>
Coniophora such as Coniophora puetana,<br>
Lentinus such as Lentinus tigrinus,<br>
Penicillium such as Penicillium glaucum,<br>
Polyporus such as Polyporus versicolor,<br>
Aureobasidium such as Aureobasidium pullulans,<br>
Sclerophoma such as Sclerophoma pityophila,<br>
Trichoderma such as Trichoderma viride,<br>
Escherichia such as Eseherichia coli,<br>
Pseudomonas such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa,<br>
Staphylococcus such as Staphylococcus aureus.<br>
Depending on their respective physical and/or chemical properties, the active compounds can be converted to the customary formulations, such as solutions, emulsions, suspensions, powders, foams, pastes, granules, aerosols, very fine capsules in polymeric substances and in coating compositions for seed, and also ULV cold- and warm-fogging formulations.<br>
These formulations are produced in a known manner, for example by mixing the active compounds with extenders, that is, liquid solvents, pressurized liquefied gases and/or solid carriers, optionally with the use of surface-active agents, that is emulsifers and/or dispersants, and/or foam formers. If the extender used is water, it is also possible to employ for example organic solvents as cosolvents.<br><br>
Suitable liquid solvents are essentially: aromatics, such as xylene, toluene or alkylnaphthalenes, chlorinated aromatics or chlorinated aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as chlorobenzenes, chloroethylenes or methylene chloride, aliphatic hydrocarbons, such as cyclohexane or paraffins, for example mineral oil fractions, alcohols, such as butanol or glycol as well as their ethers and esters, ketones, such as acetone, methyl ethyl ketone, methyl isobutyl ketone or cyclohexanone, strongly polar solvents, such as dimethylformamide and dimethyl sulphoxide, and also water. Liquefied gaseous extenders or carriers are those liquids which are gaseous at ambient temperature and at atmospheric pressure, for example aerosol propellents such as halogenated hydrocarbons and also butane, propane, nitrogen and carbon dioxide. As solid carriers there are suitable: for example ground natural minerals, such as kaolins, clays, talc, chalk, quartz, attapulgite, montmorillonite or diatomaceous earth, and ground synthetic minerals, such as finely divided silica, alumina and silicates. As solid carriers for granules there are suitable: for example crushed and fractionated natural rocks such as calcite, marble, pumice, sepiolite and dolomite, and also synthetic granules of inorganic and organic meals, and granules of organic material such as sawdust, coconut shells, maize cobs and tobacco stalks. As emulsifiers and/or foam formers there are suitable: for example non-ionic and anionic emulsifiers, such as polyoxyethylene fatty acid esters, polyoxyethylene fatty alcohol ethers, for example alkylaryl polyglycol ethers, alkylsulphonates, alkyl sulphates, arylsulphonates and protein hydrolysates. As dispersants there are suitable: for example lignin-sulphite waste liquors and methylcellulose.<br>
Tackifiers such as carboxymethylcellulose and natural and synthetic polymers in the form of powders, granules or latices, such as gum arabic, polyvinyl alcohol and polyvinyl acetate, as well as natural phospholipids, such as cephalins and lecithins, and synthetic phospholipids, can be used in the formulations. Other possible additives are mineral and vegetable oils.<br>
It is possible to use colorants such as inorganic pigments, for example iron oxide, titanium oxide and Prussian Blue, and organic dyestuffs, such as alizarin dyestuffs, azo dyestuffs and metal phthalocyanine dyestuffs, and trace nutrients such as salts of iron, manganese, boron, copper, cobalt, molybdenum and zinc.<br>
The formulations in general contain between 0.1 and 95% by weight of active compound, preferably between 0.5 and 90%.<br>
The active compounds according to the invention, as such or in their formulations, can also be used as a mixture with known fungicides, bactericides, acaricides, nematicides, or insecticides, for example, to improve the activity spectrum or prevent the development of resistance, in many<br><br>
instances, synergistic effects are obtained, i.e. the activity of the mixture exceeds the activity of the individual components.<br>

In addition, the compounds of the formula (I) according to the invention also have very good antimycotic activity. They have a very broad antimycotic spectrum of action, in particular against dermatophytes and budding fungi, moulds and diphasic fungi (for example against Candida species such as Candida albicans, Candida glabrata) and Epidermophyton floccosum, Aspergillus species such as Aspergillus niger and Aspergillus fumigatus, Trichophyton species such as Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporon species such as Microsporon canis and audouinii. The enumeration of these fungi is no restriction whatsoever of the mycotic spectrum which can be controlled and is provided by illustration only.<br>
The active compounds can be employed as such, in the form of their formulations or the use forms prepared therefrom, such as ready-to-use solutions, suspensions, wettable powders, pastes, soluble powders, dusts and granules. They are applied in the customary manner, for example by pouring, spraying, atomizing, broadcasting, dusting, foaming, painting on and the like. It is furthermore possible to apply the active compounds by the ultra-low-volume method, or to inject the active compound preparation or the active compound itself into the soil. The seed of the plant can also be treated.<br>
When employing the active compounds according to the invention as fungicides, the application rates can be varied within a substantial range, depending on the type of application. In the treatment of plant parts, the application rates of active compound are generally between 0.1 and l0 000 bg/ha, preferably between 10 and 1000 g/ha. For the treatment of seed, the application rates of active compound are generally between 0.001 and 50 g per kilogram of seed, preferably between 0.01 and 10 g per kilogram of seed. For treating the soil, the application rates of active compound are generally<br><br>
between 0.1 and 10 000 g/ha, preferably between 1 and 5000 g/ha.<br>
As already mentioned above, all plants and their parts can be treated in accordance with the invention. In a preferred embodiment, plant species and plant varieties which are found in the wild or are obtained by traditional biological breeding methods, such as hybridization or protoplast fusion, and parts of the former are treated. In a further preferred embodiment, transgenic plants and plant varieties which have been obtained by recombinant methods, if appropriate in combination with traditional methods (genetically modified organisms) and their parts are treated. The term "parts" or "parts of plants" or "plant parts" has been illustrated above.<br>
Particularly preferably, plants of the plant cultivars which are in each case commercially available or in use are treated according to the invention. Plant cultivars are understood as meaning plants with new properties ("traits") which have been obtained by conventional cultivation, by mutagenesis or else by recombinant DNA techniques. These may be cultivars, biotypes or genotypes.<br>
Depending on the plant species or plant cultivars, their location and growth conditions (soils, climate, vegetation period, nutrition), the treatment according to the invention may also result in superadditive ("synergistic") effects. Thus, for example, reduced application rates and/or extensions of the activity spectrum and/or an increase in the activity of the substances and compositions that can be used according to the invention, better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salinity, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher harvest yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products which exceed the effects which were actually to be expected are possible.<br>
The preferred transgenic plants or plant cultivars (i.e. those obtained by genetic engineering) which are to be treated according to the invention include all plants which, as a result of the recombinant modification, received genetic material which imparted particularly advantageous useful properties ("traits") to these plants. Examples of such properties are better plant growth, increased tolerance to high or low temperatures, increased tolerance to drought or to water or soil salinity, increased flowering performance, easier harvesting, accelerated maturation, higher yields, better quality and/or a higher nutritional value of the harvested products, better storage stability and/or processability of the harvested products. Further and particularly emphasized examples of such properties are a better defence of the plants against animal and microbial pests, such as against insects, mites, phytopathogenic fungi, bacteria and/or viruses, and also increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds. Examples of transgenic plants which may be mentioned are the important crop plants, such as cereals (wheat, rice),<br><br>
maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco, oilseed rape and also fruit plants (with the fruits apples, pears, citrus fruits and grapes), and particular emphasis is given to maize, soya beans, potatoes, cotton, tobacco and oilseed rape. Traits that are emphasized in particular are increased defence of the plants against insects, arachnids, nematodes, slugs and snails as the result of toxins formed in the plants, in particular those formed in the plants by the genetic material from Bacillus thuringiensis (for example by the genes CrylA(a), CrylA(b), CrylA(c), CryllA, CrylllA, CryIIIB2, Cry9c, Cry2Ab, Cry3Bb and CrylF and also combinations thereof) (hereinbelow referred to as "Bt plants"). Traits which are also particularly emphasized are the increased defence of plants against fungi, bacteria and viruses by systemic acquired resistance (SAR), systemin, phytoalexins, elicitors and resistance genes and the correspondingly expressed proteins and toxins. Traits that are furthermore particularly emphasized are the increased tolerance of the plants to certain herbicidally active compounds, for example imidazolinones, sulfonyl-ureas, glyphosate or phosphinothricin (for example the "PAT" gene). The genes which impart the desired traits in question can also be present in combination with one another in the transgenic plants. Examples of "Bt plants" which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties, soya bean varieties and potato varieties which are sold under the trade names YIELD GARD® (for example corn, cotton, soya beans), KnockOut® (for example corn), StarLink® (for example corn), Bollgard® (cotton), Nucoton® (cotton) and NewLeaf® (potato). Examples of herbicide-tolerant plants which may be mentioned are maize varieties, cotton varieties and soya bean varieties which are sold under the trade names Roundup Ready® (tolerance to glyphosates, for example maize, cotton, soya bean), Liberty Link® (tolerance to phosphinothricin, for example oilseed rape), IMI® (tolerance to imidazolinones) and STS® (tolerance to sulfonylureas, for example maize). Herbicide-resistant plants (plants bred in a conventional manaer for herbicide tolerance) which may be mentioned also include the varieties sold under the name Clearfield® (for example maize). Of course, these statements also apply to plant cultivars having these genetic traits or genetic traits still to be developed, which cultivars will be developed and/or marketed in the future.<br>
The plants listed can be treated according to the invention in a particularly advantageous manner with the compounds of the general formula (I) or the active compound mixtures according to the invention. The preferred ranges stated above for the active compounds or mixtures also apply to the treatment of these plants. Particular emphasis is given to the treatment of plants with the compounds or mixtures specifically mentioned in the present text.<br>
The preparation and the use of the active compounds according to the invention is illustrated by the examples below.<br><br>
Preparation examples<br>
Example 1<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
1.6 ml (18.4 mmol) of oxalyl dichloride and 0.2 ml of dimethylformamide are added to a mixture consisting of 2.96 g (16.8 mmol) of 3-difluoromethyl-l-methyl-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxylic acid in 100ml of dichloromethane. After 2 hours at room temperature, a solution consisting of 3.83 g (16.0 mmol) of 4'-chloro-5,3'-difluorobiphenyl-2-yl-amine and 2.9 ml (20.8 mmol) in 100ml of dichloromethane is added. The reaction mixture is stirred for 16 hours at room temperature. For work-up, the reaction mixture is poured into water, and the organic phase is separated, dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated in vacuo. Column chromatography (petroleum ether/acetone 3:1) yields 5.94 g (93% of theory) of N-(4'-chloro-3',5-difluorobiphenyl-2-yl)-3-(difluoromethyl)-l-methyl-1 H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide with a logP (pH 2.3) of 3.05.<br>
The following compounds are obtained analogously to Example 1 and in accordance with the general experimental protocols in the description:<br>
N -(5,3 '-difl uoro-4'-methy I bipheny 1-2-y l)-3 -difluoromethy 1-1 -methyl-1 H-pyrazole-4-carboxamide logP(pH 2.3)-3.05<br>
N-(5,3'-difluoro-4'-methylbiphenyl-2-yl)-l-methyl-3-trifluoromethyl-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide logP(pH2.3)-3.27<br>
N-(4'-chloro-5,3'-difluorobiphenyl-2-yl)-l-methyl-3-trifluoromethyl-lH-pyrazole-4-carboxamide logP(pH2.3) = 3.26<br>
Preparation of starting materials of the formula (III)<br>
Example (III-1)<br>
(Formula Removed)<br>
Under protective gas atmosphere, a mixture consisting of 30.0 g (0.17 mol) of 4-chloro-3-fluorophenyl-boronic acid and 29.7 g (0.16 mol) of 2-bromo-4-fluoroaniline in 170 ml of toluene and 17 ml of ethanol is treated with 3.6 g (0.003 mol) of tetrakis(triphenylphosphine)palladium(0) and stirred for 16 h at 80°C. After addition of 200 ml of toluene and 200 ml of water, the organic phase is separated off, dried over magnesium sulphate and concentrated in vacuum. Column chromatography (petroluem ether/ acetone 4:1) yields 26.1 g (70% of theory) of 4'-chloro-5,3'-difluorobiphenyl-2-yl-amine with a logP (pH 2.3) of 3.18.<br>
Example (I1I-2)<br>
Starting from 4-methyl-3-fluorophenylboronic acid and 2-bromo-4-fluoroaniline and proceeding analogously to Example (III-l), the compound 5,3'-difluoro-4'-methylbiphenyl-2-ylamine with a logP (pH 2.3) of 2.94 is obtained.<br>
The logP values stated in the above tables and preparation examples are determined as described in EEC Directive 79/831 Annex V.A8 by means of HPLC (high performance liquid chromatography) on a reversed-phase column (C 18). Temperature: 43°C.<br>
The determination is effected in the acidic range at pH 2.3 using 0.1% aqueous phosphoric acid and acetonitrile as eleuents; linear gradient from 10% acetonitrile to 90% acetonitrile.<br>
The calibration is effected with unbranched alkan-2-ones (having 3 to 16 carbon atoms) whose logP values are known (determination of the logP values with reference to the retention times by linear interpolation between two successive alkanones).<br>
The lambda-max values were determined with reference to the UV spectra from 200 nm to 400 nm in the maxima of the chromatographic signals.<br>
