				<td>FIELD OF INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to the Facsimile Technology. Further, this invention relates to automatic retrieval of documents. More particularly, the present invention relates to method and system of automatic retrieval of document through digital data transfer when data retrieval fails during fax polling.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE RELATED ART<br>
In the conventional fax machines there is no support for handling of failure during retrieval of document. The transceiver which requests the particular document through polling usually retries for 'n' number of times in case failure occurs, where n is configured by the user.<br>
A US Patent No. 6,157,706 describes a system and method that enables a fax machine to send and receive electronic mails in the form of e-mail messages. A user, to whom the fax has to be sent, sends a fax message to the sender of the fax. The fax message contains the e-mail address to which the fax has to be sent. However, the device always sends a document as an e-mail message and not only in the event of failure of fax transmission, as described in the invention disclosure. However the system does not send the document as an attachment in the e-mail. Further, the patent does not claim a method of sending the document through an FTP server.<br>
Another published Patent No. W09710668A1 describes a device and method for transmitting and receiving faxes in the form of e-mail attachments. The device may be an MFP or an interface connectable between a conventional fax machine and a telephone line. The device also connects to the Internet via a PSTN. However, the device always sends a fax document as an e-mail attachment and not only in the event of failure of a fax transmission, as described in the invention disclosure. The e-mail address of a recipient is either manually entered by the user or selected from<br>
- A .<br>
a database. Also, the patent application does not disclose a method of sending the document through an FTP server.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of this invention is therefore to invent a method for handling failure during document retrieval using conventional fax polling or Internet fax polling.<br>
The present invention relates to a method and system for automatic retrieval of documents through e-mail when the retrieval of the documents fails during fax polling. Basically Fax polling is a method of retrieving documents from a fax related machine, referred to as a polled machine. In this method, a fax related machine (referred to as a polling machine) sends a request to a polled machine for a document. The method described in the present invention is initiated when a user inputs a telephone number (PSTN) or an Internet Protocol (IP) address required for polling. In case of failure of fax transmission during polling, the user is given an option between receiving the document through e-mail or through an FTP server. The user may choose either, or both of the options. Accordingly, the polling machine requests the user to enter an e-mail address, an FTP server address or both. The polling machine sends the e-mail address or the FTP server address through a Calling subscriber Internet Address (CIA) frame. The polled machine extracts the e-mail address or the FTP address and stores it. In case the document transmission fails, the polled machine sends the document as an attachment to the e-mail address or uploads the document to the FTP server (as defined by the FTP server address), depending on the user's choice.<br>
Accordingly, this invention explains a method of automatic retrieval of document through digital data transfer when data retrieval fails during fax polling wherein the said method comprising the steps of:<br>
(a) sending a request to a polled machine for a document by a polling machine; <br>
(b)	inputting a telephone number or an Internet Protocol address required for polling by the user;<br>
(c)	configuring the option of receiving the document through e-mail and/or through an FTP server by the user;<br>
(d)	choosing the e-mail and/or FTP option in case of failure of fax transmission during polling;<br>
(e)	requesting the user to enter an e-mail address, an FTP server address or both by the polling machine in case of a failure of fax;<br>
(f)	sending the e-mail address or the FTP server address through a Calling subscriber Internet Address (CIA) frame by the polling machine;<br>
(g)	extracting and storing the e-mail address or the FTP address by the polled machine; and<br>
(h)	sending the document as an attachment to the e-mail address or uploading the document to the FTP server accordingly by the polled machine in case of document transmission failure.<br>
Accordingly, this invention further explains a system for automatic retrieval of document through digital data transfer when data retrieval fails during fax polling wherein the said system comprising:<br>
(a)	means for sending a request to a polled machine for a document by a polling machine;<br>
(b)	means for inputting a telephone number or an Internet Protocol address required for polling by the user;<br>
(c)	means for configuring the option of receiving the document through e-mail and/or through an FTP server by the user;<br>
(d)	means for choosing the e-mail and/or FTP option in case of failure of fax transmission during polling;<br>
(e)	means for requesting the user to enter an e-mail address, an FTP server address or both by the polling machine in case of a failure of fax;<br>
(f)	means for sending the e-mail address or the FTP server address through a Calling subscriber Internet Address (CIA) frame by the polling machine;<br>
(g)	means for extracting and storing the e-mail address or the FTP address by the polled machine; and<br>
(h)	means for sending the document as an attachment to the e-mail address or uploading the document to the FTP server accordingly by the polled machine in case of document transmission failure.<br>
Other advantages and features of the invention will become more clearly apparent from the following description of the embodiments of the invention taken in conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE ACCOMPANYING DRAWINGS<br>
Figure 1 shows the polling machine using PSTN line to retrieve a document from the remote machine<br>
Figure 2 shows the polling machine which is an internet aware machine and using real time fax over IP protocol to poll the document from the remote machine.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
A preferred embodiment of the present invention will now be explained with reference to the accompanying drawings. It should be understood however that the disclosed embodiment is merely exemplary of the invention, which may be embodied in various forms. The following description and drawings are not to be construed as limiting the invention and numerous specific details are described to provide a thorough understanding of the present invention, as the basis for the claims and as a basis for teaching one skilled in the art how to make and/or use the invention. However in certain instances, well-known or conventional details are not described in order not to unnecessarily obscure the present invention in detail. <br>
Figure 1 and Figure 2 show the drawings depicting the entire system. The polling machine is an Internet aware Fax device connected to internet or G3 fax machine connected to PSTN line. The remote machine is assumed to be capable of sending email attachment or FTP the scanned document.<br>
Figures 1 and 2 shows two different scenarios wherein the current invention is applicable. In Fig 1 the polling machine uses PSTN line to retrieve a document from the remote machine. In this scenario user at the polling machine enters the remote machine's telephone number and document identity and initiates fax polling. Once connection is established between two apparatus, remote apparatus sends the requested document back to the polling machine. In Fig 2 the polling machine is an internet aware machine and uses real time fax over IP protocol (T.38) to poll the document from the remote machine. User enters remote machine's network address and performs the polling.<br>
Objective of this invention is to suggest a method to handle failure during retrieval of the document during fax polling. Proposed method involves retrieving document through email or through FTP, with relevant file format, in case fax polling fails. Suggested method involves two facsimile apparatus. The apparatus which polls the document from a remote, ask the email id or FTP server IP from the user who does the polling. This information will be added in the "Calling subscriber Internet Address" (CIA) which is sent to the apparatus, which is polled, during "Capability exchange" phase of Fax protocol. In case the document retrieval fails due to any reason, the remote polled apparatus will send the document as an attachment to the email address which is extracted from the CIA. In case IP address is sent which will be considered as the FTP server IP and document will be uploaded there.<br>
The operation of the Invention is observing the Following steps involved in the suggested method. With reference to Fig 1, the operation is initiated by inputting telephone number (PSTN) of the remote polled device at the polling machine. User will be prompted to enter email or FTP server Address in case he wishes to receive the document through email or in an FTP server. FTP server address is assumed to be a TCP/IP address. The polling machine connects to the remote machine through the PSTN line and establishes a connection. Once connection is established as part of the normal facsimile procedure remote machine transmits it's capabilities through DIS command. In case remote machine is internet aware machine, it is identified through DIS bits 1 and 3. If the remote machine is an internet aware machine, polling machine transmits optional CIA frame with inputted email address or FTP server address. As per facsimile protocol specifications the email address or FTP address is encoded in the ISP (Internet Selective Polling) format and sent to the remote polled machine. Remote machine extracts the email or FTP server address and stores locally. Remote machine completes the normal polling procedure where in it transmits the document to the polling machine and gets the confirmation from the polling machine. In case error occurs due to the poor quality of PSTN line or any other reason, remote machine uses the email address which is extracted and stored locally from CIA, to send the document in the form of email attachment in a specific file format. In case the internet address specified is an FTP server address, remote machine uploads the document in a specific file format to the FTP server using FTP protocol. The user at the polling machine checks his mailbox or the FTP server to receive it in electronic form.<br>
With reference to figure 2, wherein the polling machine uses internet for polling a document from an internet aware remote machine. User enters internet address of the polled machine instead of PSTN number. As part of the normal protocol for real time facsimile polling over internet (T.38), optional CIA frames are sent to the remote machine over internet with user entered email or FTP address. Remote machine extracts the email address or FTP address from CIA and stores it locally. In case remote machine is unable to complete the polling due to network jitters (delays in network), polled machine uses the email to send the document in the form of email attachment in a specific file format. In case the internet address specified is an FTP server address, remote machine uploads the document in a specific file format to the FTP server using FTP protocol. The user at the polling machine checks his mail box or the FTP server to receive it in electronic form. In <br>
another embodiment remote machine always chooses to send the document to the extracted email address or upload to FTP server address regardless of whether document polling is success or not.<br>
Following are the implementation changes required to do be done in the existing system.<br>
1.	A typical fax polling apparatus usually has numerical keypad and an LCD display to display the user entered fax numbers. To implement the current invention user interface module is changed to ask email address of the user or an FTP server address during fax polling. Since email addresses generally consist of printable characters, QWERTY key board needs to be added to the polling device. The user entered email address or FTP address is stored internally to use during actual fax sending.<br>
2.	Fax module which implements fax protocol (ITUT T.30) is changed so as to use inputted email address/FTP address, encode this information in ISP format and send ISP encoded email/FTP address in the optional CIA frame.<br>
3.	Fax module is changed so as to use the optional CIA frame received from the polling device. The polling machine (encodes -&gt;decodes) the ISP coded email or FTP address and stores locally in the memory. Fax apparatus without current invention ignores the CIA sent from the polling apparatus.<br>
4.	A typical fax apparatus is implemented to retry the fax polling 'n' number of times, in case fax polling fails. In the proposed invention, the fax module is changed so that polling device doesn't retry. Instead the polled machines fax module, initiates an email job or an FTP job if the fax polling fails. Email job consists of encoding the scanned document in a relevant file format and sending as an email attachment through an SMTP server. FTP job involves sending the encoded files into an FTP server though IP network using, FTP, file transfer protocol.<br>
5.	In the other embodiment, fax module is changed so that polled device starts an email or FTP job using the scanned document always, regardless of the result of the fax polling.<br>
The Advantage(s) of the Invention are as follows:<br>
•	No manual intervention in terms sending back up email address.<br>
•	Even if the document sending fails document is received through email.<br>
•	Through a User Interface the user can give email address/FTP Server address which will be used as back while initiating polling.<br>
•	No extra cost involved to receive a document.<br>
•	No modifications to existing fax protocol.<br>
It will also be obvious to those skilled in the art that other control methods and apparatuses can be derived from the combinations of the various methods and apparatuses of the present invention as taught by the description and the accompanying drawings and these shall also be considered within the scope of the present invention. Further, description of such combinations and variations is therefore omitted above. It should also be noted that the host for storing the applications include but not limited to a computer, mobile communication device, mobile server or a multi function device.<br>
Although the present invention has been fully described in connection with the preferred embodiments thereof with reference to the accompanying drawings, it is to be noted that various changes and modifications are possible and are apparent to those skilled in the art. Such changes and modifications are to be understood as included within the scope of the present invention as defined by the appended claims unless they depart there from. <br>
