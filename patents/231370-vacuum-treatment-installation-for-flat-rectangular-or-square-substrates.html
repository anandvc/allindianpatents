				<td>Vacuum treatment installation for flat rectangular<br>
or square substrates<br>
[0001] The invention relates to a vacuum treatment installation for flat rectangular or square<br>
substrates in an at least substantially perpendicular position, comprising a vacuum chamber with<br>
at least two treatment chambers distributed on the circumference of the vacuum chamber and<br>
open at the chamber side, a charging interlock, a discharging interlock and a rotatable<br>
arrangement of substrate holders within the vacuum chamber, with a driving mechanism for the<br>
sequential rotation and the advance and retraction of the substrate holders relative to the<br>
treatment chambers.<br>
[0002] Continuously operating treatment or coating installations, which are operated under<br>
vacuum up to the performance limit of the vacuum motor pump sets and in which different<br>
treatments are carried out in individual treatment stations on so-called substrates, include, as a<br>
rule, the following assemblages:<br>
[0003] a)	at least one vacuum chamber<br>
[0004] b)	at least one evacuation or pumping system,<br>
[0005] c)	treatment stations occcssible from the vacuum chamber with treatment sources,<br>
[0006] d)	optionally inner interlock valves at the entrance of the treatment stations,<br>
[0007] e)	supply facilities for the treatment sources (current and/or gas sources),<br>
[0008] f)	at least one interlock system with interlock valves for the transfer of the substrates<br>
in and out of the vacuum chamber through the interlock,<br>
[0009] g) transport systems for the two or multi-dimensional transport of the substrates,<br>
[0010] h) substrate holders or carriers in cooperation with the transport systems, and<br><br>
[0011] i) optionally superposed sets of machinery for the purpose of providing and/or<br>
removing the substrates in front of the interlock system of the installation.<br>
[0012] To the extent installations with rotary and optionally radial transport paths are involved<br>
and treatment stations or chambers connected to at least one, at least substantially rotationally<br>
symmetric, main vacuum chamber, such installations are also referred to as "cluster<br>
installations",<br>
[0013] In the treatment processes are employed prencaring (outgassing) and coating or the<br>
substrates, vacuum vapor deposition, cathode sputtering, plasma treatment (for example<br>
incandescence for cleaning and adhesion promotion), PVD, CVD, and PCVD processes. For<br>
these processes numerous process paraneters and device components are known. "P" denotes<br>
here "physical", "C" chemical, "V" "vacuum" and "D" "deposition". Some of these processes,<br>
for which the designations have become internationally established usage, can be completed<br>
reactively (with the supply of reaction gises or gas mixtures) or nonreactively (in the presence of<br>
inert gases). Added to these are etching processes for surface treatment including generation of<br>
specific "background [surface] pattern" and contact lines on the substrates. Depending on the<br>
requirements made of the end products, all of these process steps and device components are also<br>
appropriate for the subject matter of the nvention.<br>
[0014] their historical development the continuous "cluster installations" were initially applied<br>
in the case of relatively small substrates such as disks, chips, data stores and wafers. However,<br>
the further development in reference to larger substrates, such as window panes and displays,<br>
encountered considerable problems, such as for example the dimensions of the installation, the<br>
space requirement for handling the substrates and optionally the substrate holders, for example<br>
raising substrates supplied in the horizontal position into a substantially perpendicular position,<br>
the hazard of elastic deformation, breakage and/or mechanical damage of the substrates and/or<br>
their coatings and contamination, especially through the accumulation of coatings on<br>
components continuously or temporarlly in the installations, and opelling of these contaminations<br>
due to different process parameters, especially through temperature changes or mechanical<br>
effects.<br><br><br>
[0015]For example, according to EP ( 136 562 B1, which will be discussed later, each substrate<br>
is supplied to an interlock system lying horizontally; in it is first raised upwardly by means of a<br>
lifting device and subsequently swiveled with a pivot device into a perpendicular position, in<br>
which it is secured on a substrate holder. During the transport out in a second interlock system,<br>
the sequence of these steps is subsequently reversed. In the case of large-area rectangular<br>
substrates this would lead to considerable space problems, large interlock and chamber volumes<br>
as well as long evacuation times and/or high evacuation performances of the vacuum pumps.<br>
[0016] EP 0 136 362 B1 disclosed forming in a continuous cathode sputtering installation for<br>
small circular disk-form substrates such as disks, semiconductors and wafers, a vacuum chamber<br>
of two pot-form chambers, namely of a pentagonal outer chamber and a concentric cylindrical<br>
inner Chamber, both of which are connected with one another fixedly and vacuum -tight by on<br>
annular upper cover. The bottoms have a small vertical distance from one another. The outer<br>
chamber is provided on the circumference equiclistantly with an interlock installation and four<br>
chamber-form treatment stations. Suih installations are also generally referred to as "cluster<br>
installations.<br>
[0017] Between outer and inner chamber is rotatably disposed a further polygonal pot, on whose<br>
body five substrate holders are disposer by means of leaf swings, which in the operating position<br>
close the interlock installation as well as the processing chambers by means of seals and a valve<br>
function. The substrate holder pot also has a bottom disposed between the bottoms of outer and<br>
inner chamber. The radial movemer ts of the substrate holders, which remain continuously in the<br>
vacuum chamber, are generated synchronously through a central cone and five slide rods, which<br>
are guided in the body of the inner chamber and through its wall at approximately half its height<br>
and which, consequently, cannot take part in the rotation. The drive unit with its cone is also<br>
stationary.<br>
[0018] The substrate holder pot is rotated stepwise by a further drive unit. In order to be able to<br>
rotate the substrate holder pot within the vacuum chamber from station to station, said slide rods<br>
must be cyclically retracted from their circular or cylindrical movement path of the substrate<br>
holder pot and be advanced again. Since during the rotation of the substrate holders from station<br><br>
to station the openings of the treatment stations are made clear, coating material escapes at half<br>
its height into the space between outer and inner chamber and there condenses on the surfaces,<br>
thus also on the ends of the slide rods, its guides and, on the leaf springs on the substrate holder<br>
pot. The layer thickness of these condensates, which increases from operating cycle to operating<br>
cycle, from time to time becomes spalled off in the form of particles and leads to contaminations,<br>
and specifically also on the surface of the rotatingly guided substrates, which thereby become<br>
unusable and consequently represent expensive rejects. Especially damaging are the peeling<br>
processes of the condensates at the inner ends of the slide rods.<br>
[0019] It is asserted that in this structuring and operating manner the contaminations of the<br>
substrates through spalled off particles coming front above of collected layer material are said to<br>
be avoided; however, this applies at best to an absolutely perpendicular position of the substrate<br>
surfaces on the entire transport path within the vacuum chamber. But this presupposes the<br>
securement of the relatively small substrates on their holders.<br>
[0020] Through EP 0 665 193 B1 and DE 695 04 716 T2 it is known in a cluster installation for<br>
the purpose of the delimiting placement areas and chamber volumes to transport through an<br>
interlock substrates comprised of glass for large-area flat and rectangular or square displays with<br>
dimensions of 450 mm x 550 mm and greater in continuously perpendicular position by means<br>
of one substrate holder each from the environment into a system of vacuum chambers and to<br>
transport them out again to the environment by means of the same substrate holder together with<br>
it. Between a central buffer chamber and the individual treatment chambers valve gates are<br>
disposed in each instance. In the buffer chamber is disposed concentrically and with vertical axis<br>
a rotary table, with which the substrates; with their holders and with their main planes, thus nearly<br>
radially, oriented toward the particular treatment chamber and from this position are moved into<br>
the treatment chambers and retracted again. However, the rotary table does not have substrate<br>
holders of its own. For transporting the substrate holders, in each treatment chamber and on the<br>
rotary table, separate from each other and driven separately, conveying facilities with rollers are<br>
disposed for the substrate holders. The constructional expenditures and the driving and control<br>
facilities are considerable; in particular on the rotary table several conveying facilities with<br>
rollers can also be disposed independently of one another. If a circle is drawn about the<br><br>
rotational axis of the rotary table, which also includes the radially projecting treatment chambers,<br>
a large requirement of placement area for the complete device results, especially also because the<br>
substrates are held "standing on one of their point!?" in the large-area substrate holders such that<br>
the diagonal dimensions of the substrates determine the diameter of said circle. The problem is<br>
thereby not eliminated of repeated transport of all substrate holders between the environment and<br>
the interior of the installation with the consequence of the spelling off of accumulated layers due<br>
to temperature changes in the installation.<br>
[0021] 200 22 564 U1 discloses transferring carriers with substrates for coating purposes<br>
through a first interlock into a vacuum, guiding them continuously on a circular or partially<br>
circular path and, lastly, after the coating transferring them out again through a second interlock<br>
Radial movements or movements with a radial component of the carriers within the vacuum<br>
chamber and opposite to the coating stations, deviating from the circular path, are not provided.<br>
The return transport of the empty carriers from the discharging interlock to the charging interlock<br>
outside of the vacuum chamber should :ake place on the shortest possible path or as rapidly as<br>
possible in order to limit the spalling of the layers accumulating on the carriers within the<br>
vacuum chamber due to temperature fuctuations.<br>
[0022] DE 102 05 167 Cl discloses connecting in an in-line vacuum coating installation two<br>
buffer chambers with rotatable exchange units for carriers with substrates with one another<br>
through two linear transport paths of variable length, in order to be able to change the number of<br>
coating stations, The carriers can be transported in perpendicular or minimally inclined<br>
positions. The one transport path is provided for discontinuous transport and has at both ends,<br>
adjoining onto the buffer chambers, one. interlock chamber each with two valves, and in front of<br>
it or following it a loading and an unloading station for the carriers. The other transport path is<br>
provided for the continuous transport and has at both ends, adjoining the buffer chambers via<br>
valves, one transfer region each for the carriers, each with the substrates. Means for a carrier<br>
movement transversely to the direction of transpose within the installation are not provided and<br>
specifically neither on the linear transport paths nor in the buffer chambers, nor in the transfer<br>
regions. The buffer chambers are only provided with means for heating and cooling.<br><br>
[0023] It is known from US 2002/0078892 Al to transport large-area rectangular substrates with<br>
dimensions of 1 m x 1.2 m and greater for LCD displays pairwise and perpendicularly parallel to<br>
one another or at the upper edges inclined toward one another at an acute angle on different<br>
transport paths from atmosphere to atmosphere through vacuum installations - including cluster<br>
installations. For this purpose serve substrate holders with a horizontal plate, on the upper side<br>
of which, disposed mirror symmetrically two frames, open at the inside, are disposed as<br>
substrate holders and at whose under side along the plane of symmetry a bracket plate with<br>
bilateral toothed bara is disposed, by means of which the substrate holders can be driven by<br>
scries of pinions driven by toothed belts, in different and changing directions.<br>
[0024] Again, as the central part of the transport device serves here also a rotationally symmetric<br>
throughpassage or buffer chamber with a rotary table, on whose underside such a pinion drive is<br>
disposed with six pinions and a motor for guidance, change of displacement direction and for the<br>
radial displacement of the substrate holders. On the circumference of the buffer chamber are<br>
disposed, separated via gate valves, an interlock system and at least three treatment chambers for<br>
diverse vacuum processes. The substrata holders are moved in the radial longitudinal direction<br>
into the treatment chambers, which, consequently, must have the corresponding radial<br>
dimensions, such that an imaginary circle about the entire installation has a large diameter,<br>
leading to a correspondingly large placement area. The longitudinal displacement and<br>
corresponding drive units in the treatment chambers arc also required for the reason that such<br>
treatment chambers can also be arranged serially in radial directions.<br>
[0025]As prior cut is described in US 2002/0078892 Al a rotary table with ft transfer robot and<br>
two grippers, which are actuated in the ladial direction via articulation members in the manner of<br>
a scissors articulation. However, the patent expressly states that herein the substrates are held on<br>
the entire transport path eccentrically and in the horizontal position and that with increasing<br>
dimensions of the substrates for displays, for example, for wall display screens, this leads to<br>
space and volume problems as well as longer pumping times and to flexure or breaking under<br>
their own weight of the substrates which are only 0.7 mm thick. An enlargement of the<br>
horizontal dimensions of the substrates leads to the twofold value of the diameter enlargement,<br><br>
for example beyond 2 m, which is tied to additional enlargements of the interlock valves and to<br>
problems of mass during acceleration and delay and to tolerance problems,<br>
[0026] US 2002/0078892 Al further specifics that the bracket plate of the rotary table can be<br>
raised from a guidance rail by means of a magnetic lifting drive unit in order to avoid dust<br>
development through abrasion. However, not addressed is the problem of avoidance of dust<br>
formation through the spalling off of layer material cumulatively collected on the substrate<br>
holders due to the transport from atmosphere to atmosphere and heating within the vacuum<br>
chambers, as well as through abrasion from the pinion drive units. A further significant<br>
disadvantage of the known configuration is, however, that with the number of the treatment<br>
chambers connected to the central or buffer chamber, the number grows of transport mechanisms<br>
in the interior of the chamber, which must be compatible with the transport mechanism of the<br>
rotary table in the buffer chamber in order for the transfer into and out of the treatment chambers<br>
to be possible at all.<br>
[0027] In conjunction with the above prior art it was shown that, due to the continual<br>
enlargement of the substrate dimensions and the decrease of the inherent shape stability and<br>
nondeformability due to the decrease of the substrate thickness, with advancing development<br>
new problems were generated, which have led to highly complex and expensive constructional<br>
principles and complicated<br>
[0028] Operating sequences, and yet, nevertheless, the problem of placement area and of<br>
contamination of the substrates through particles of accumulated layers on installation<br>
components could not be successfully solved to satisfaction.<br>
[0029] The invention therefore addresses the problem of specifying constructional principles and<br>
operation sequences leading to a further decrease of the placement area, the chamber volumes,<br>
the evacuation times and to a further simplification of the "handling" of the substrates outside<br>
and within the vacuum chamber and ye: especially to a marked reduction of the contamination<br>
hazard of the substrates through particles of spalled off layer packets.<br><br>
[0030] The solution of the posed problem is achieved according to the invention through the<br>
characteristics in the characterizing clause of patent claim 1, namely thereby that the substrate<br>
holders are connected in their lower regions via connecting rod configurations with the driving<br>
mechanism and that at least the lower pivot bearings of the connecting rod configurations are<br>
disposed below a horizontal center line of the height of the bearing surface of the substrate<br>
holders.<br>
[0031] Through this solution the posed overall problem is fully solved to satisfaction, in<br>
particular constructional principles and operation sequences are specified, which lead to a further<br>
decrease of the placement area, the chamber volumes, the evacuation times and to a further<br>
simplification of the "handling" of the substrates outside and within the vacuum chamber and yet<br>
lead especially to a marked decrease of the contamination hazard of the substrates through<br>
particles of spalled off layer packets. The constructional expenditure and the number of rajacts<br>
are decreased and the product quality is considerably enhanced.<br>

coaxial mounting flange 2 for the secure nent on a (not shown here) lower bottom of the vacuum<br>
chamber. This driving mechanism 1 bears in its upper region a rotatable chamber 3 with square<br>
outline at whose corners overall arc fastened eight extension arms 4, which are braced on a<br>
cylindrical substructure 6 of the chamber 3 via oblique struts 5 and specifically in each instance<br>
joined together pairwise via four radially projecting extension arms 7 (see Figure 2).<br>
[0069] On the extension arms 4 [sic; 7] which pairwise extend parallel toward one another and<br>
form a right-angled cross, are downwarlly suspended overall eight parallelogram connecting rod<br>
configurations 8 via upper fixed pivot bearings. The lower ends of the parallelogram connecting<br>
rod configurations 8 are pivotably supported on horizontal U-form stirrups 9 with shanks 9a<br>
pairwise parallel to one another, whose outwardly directed ends are connected by one crosstie<br>
bar 10 each. Each of the crosstie bars 10 carries at least two projecting rollers 11, which serve as<br>
supports for substrates, not shown here, and arc optionally drivable and/or<br>
arrcatable. Each of the crosstie bars if supports toward the too a frame structure 12, directed<br>
obliquely and upwardly at an angle between 3 and 15 degrees with respect to the vertical with<br>
longitudinal and transverse struts in the manner of a framework, which is braced via vertical<br>
uprights 12a on the particular stirrup 9.<br>
[0070] The outsides of the crosstie bars 10 and of the frame structure 12 are disposed in a<br>
common plane, whose outline corresponds at least substantially to the outline of the particular<br>
substrate. These parts thereby form a dimensionally stable substrate holder 13. In the direction<br>
of their said planee these [holders] have a height "H" and define in their midpoints (H/2) a<br><br>
horizontal virtual center line "M", below which all connecting rod configurations and their pivot<br>
articulations are disposed.<br>
[0071] The two substrate holders 13 shewn we thereby movable oppositely in the direction of<br>
arrows 14 and essentially radially toward one another. It must be emphasized that only two of<br>
the substrate holders 13 are shown. The two remaining substrate holders disposed in front of and<br>
behind the driving mechanism 1 are not depicted for the sake of clarity. They arc also radially<br>
movable in opposite directions and specifically at right angles to the two arrows 14.<br>
[0072] The frame structures 12 are perferated at numerous sites and connected to a (not shown)<br>
gas source, such that the substrate can be loaded in the charging position in the manner of an "air<br>
cushion vehicle" free of friction and preserving form onto the particular substrate holder 13<br>
guided by rollers 11. The gas supply is subsequently interrupted in order for the gas atmospheres<br>
in the individual treatment chambers not to be impaired.<br>
[0073] Fig. 3 and 4 show the rotation system according to Fig. 1 and 2 integrated into a vacuum<br>
chamber 15 with a vertical axis A-A. The vacuum chamber 15 is comprised of an inner pot-<br>
form chamber component 16 with a bottom 17, into which is set vacuum-tight the upper end<br>
region of the driving mechanism 1 by means of a flange 18, The vertical bracing takes place via<br>
four anchor struts 19 whose effective length is variable via adjusting elements 20. Of these only<br>
the two adjusting elements 20 located behind the vertical section plane (E-E in Figure 6) are<br>
shown, which are suspended on radial guset plates 21.<br>
[0074] The vacuum chamber 15 comprises furthermore an outer chamber component 22 in the<br>
form of a square truncated pyramid with a bottom 23, through which is guided under vacuum<br>
seal the lower end region 24 of the driving mechanism 1. The inner and the outer chamber<br>
component 16 or 22 are connected vacuum-tight through a roof 25 The walls of the outer<br>
chamber component 22 are provided with four equidistantly distributed rectangular openings 26,<br>
of which here also only two diametrically opposite openings 26 arc evident. Onto the openings<br>
26 are set treatment chambers 27 and 28, which can be equipped with (not shown) facilities for<br>
the most diverse vacuum processes. The outer walls 27a and 28a of the treatment chambers 27<br><br>
and 28 arc provided with ribbings 30 for absorbing the forces of atmospheric pressure (esp. Fig.<br>
7).<br>
[0075] Between the horizontal bottoms 17 and 23 are located the essential rotatablc parts of<br>
driving mechanism 1, which will be explained in further detail in conjunction with Fig. 5. Into<br>
the annular space 29 between the inner and the outer chamber components 16 or 22 project from<br>
below upwardly the rotatable substrate holders 13 displaccable with radial components. Slide<br>
leadthroughs through the cylindrical wall of the inner chamber component 16 are not provided.<br>
The displacement of the substrate holders 13 from the position according to Fig. 3 into that<br>
according to Fig. 4 takes place rather througr the already described parallelogram connecting rod<br>
configurations 8, in which the spatial position of the pivot bearings is already evident from the<br>
definition "parallelogram connecting rod configurations" Only that much is stated that the<br>
lowest points of the lower pivot bearings are disposed below the corresponding upper pivot<br>
bearings of the particular identical connectinc rod. Consequently, a symmetric swiveling about a<br>
center position is carried out. Through the adequate dimensioning of the length of the<br>
connecting rods at a given dimensioning of the pivot angle or of the radial movement component<br>
it can be attained that the vertical movement component becomes minimal. In contrast to slide<br>
leadthroughs, such pivot bearings generate virtually no abrasion and also no dust of coating<br>
material which could affect the layer qualitie; on the substrates. Added to this is that the<br>
engagement of the U-form stirrups 9 on the substrate holders 13 takes place at their lower edge<br>
and not in the substrate center as is the case with the subject matter of EP 0 136 562 Bl. The<br>
lower pivot bearings of the already described parallelogram connecting rod configurations 8 are<br>
located only at the smallest possible distance above the top sides of stirrups 9 and on the<br>
backsides of the substrate holders 13, such that for this reason also an abrasion cannot reach the<br>
outsides of the substrates.<br>
Fig. 5 depicts an enlarged cutaway portion from the driving mechanism 1 in its position<br>
according to Fig. 4. The previously used refference symbols are used and will continue to be<br>
used. In the rotatable chamber 3 are disposed a drive motor for the stepwise rotational<br>
movement as well as horizontal control rods 30 for the cyclic movement of the already described<br>
parallelogram connecting rod configurations 8, the control rods 30, guided and driven in the<br><br>
interior of chamber 3, projecting with their outer ends from chamber 3 and engaging the<br>
particular inner connecting rods via pivot bearings 31.<br>
[0077]The driving mechanism I comprises i coaxial shaft 32 passing through bottoms 17 and<br>
23, which shaft is guided by means of a first vacuum-tight rotational leadthrough 33 through the<br>
upper bottom 17, and by means of a second vacuum-tight rotational leadthrough 34 and through<br>
a radial boating 35 through the lower bottom 23. A group of connection fittinge 36 covered for<br>
supplying treatment media and, if required, also for the current feed.<br>
[0078] Fig. 6 depicts a schematic representation of the superimposed movement sequences in the<br>
circumferential direction and in the radial ditection. Parallel to the outer chamber component 22,<br>
which can also be implemented in the manner of a truncated cone according to the dashed circle<br>
22a, extends parallel to a tangent on the vacuum chamber 15 a series of interlocks 37 comprised<br>
of a charging interlock 38, a transfer chamber 39 and a discharging interlock 40. The interlock<br>
series 37 includes vacuum valves 41 of known structural type, Line E-E represents the vertical<br>
section plane of Fig. 3 and 4.<br>
[0079] The linear stepwise transport direction of the substrates in oblique position or guided in<br>
oblique position without substrate holder through the interlock series 37 is indicated by the series<br>
of arrows 42, Opposite to the transfer chamber 39 is a further treatment chamber 43. In the<br>
interior of the annular space 29 the movement sequences are indicated by thick arrow lines.<br>
Starting at the transfer chamber 39, the stepwise rotational movement takes place by 90 degrees<br>
in each instance along the closed arrow line 14. At each of the four stopping points directly in<br>
front of the transfer chamber 39 and the treatnent chambers 27, 43 and 28 the advance and<br>
retraction of the substrates are indicated by radial double arrows 45. The advance of the<br>
substrates takes place up to immediately in front of shielding frame-form screens 46 disposed in<br>
the opening regions of the treatment chambers 27, 43 and 28. However, a sealing effect between<br>
the substrates and these screens 46 is not required for the reason alone that the extremely thin<br>
substrates cannot or must not perform a [sealling] contribution. As soon as the rearward<br>
movements of the substrate holders are completed, these are rotated by 90 degrees in front of the<br><br>
particular next treatment chamber, and at the end of the treatment, in front of the transfer<br>
chamber 39 for further transport into the discharging interlock 40.<br>
[0080] Fig. 7 shows a perspective exterior view of an entire installation with the means and the<br>
reference symbols according to Fig, 1 to 6. On both sides of the transfer chamber 39 the<br>
charging interlock 38 and the discharging int:rlock 40 are indicated in dashed lines. Of the<br>
transfer chamber 39 is shown the oblique entrance slot 39a and also a pumping fitting 47<br>
connected thereon with a gate valve 48 and a cryopump 49. Clearly evident are the ribbings 50<br>
of the transfer chamber 39 and of the treatment chamber 28 against atmospheric pressure.<br>
[0081] The highly compact implementation of the installation saving space and volume is<br>
especially evident in Fig. 6 and 7, especially the fact that the substrate holders do not have to be<br>
transported out to the atmosphere through an interlock. In all cases are also disposed in the<br>
interlock chambers 38 and 40 perforated substrate holders with compressed gas supply over the<br>
entire substrate surface and rollers at the lower end, such that the substrates can be slid free of<br>
friction via gas cushions onto the substrate holders and again be slid off. For the evacuation and<br>
during standstill of the substrates on their ho ders, the gas supplies are temporarily switched off.<br>
This applies also to the time interval in which the substrates on their substrate holders are located<br>
in vacuum chamber 15. This applies also to the following embodiment example.<br>
[0082] Fig. 8 and 9 depict a variant of the subject matter according to Fig. 1 to 7 with the<br>
continued use of the previous reference symbols. Different is here the rotation and advance drive<br>
unit for the substrate holders 13. In the pot-form inner chamber component 16 with bottom 17 is<br>
here disposed a rotary and lifting drive unit M comprising a first motor 52 with step-down<br>
gearing 53 for generating a rotational movement and a second motor 54 with step-down gearing<br>
55 fur generating a lifting and lowering movement of a common shaft 56. Four double<br>
trapezoidal connecting rod configurations 57 are disposed on a rotary plate 58, which can be set<br>
stepwise into rotation through the shaft 56. The substrate holders 13 arc shown in Fig. 8 with<br>
continuous lines in their retracted positions.<br>
[0083] By lifting the shaft 56, which include s a bearing flange 63, via connecting rods 64 (Fig,<br>
9) suspended thereon and nearly perpendicular, four angle levers 59 are swiveled outwardly<br><br>
about their fixed bearing 60, whereby the trapezoidal connecting rod configurations 57 are<br>
swiveled at their upper ends outwardly as is shown in Fig. 9, The uppermost and shortest<br>
members 65 of the trapezoidal connecting rod configurations 57 are implemented in the form of<br>
a T and are provided in their midpoints with further articulations, two serially connected<br>
trapezoidal connecting rod configurations 57 being connected by horizontal distance connecting<br>
rods 62, such that each of the serially connected trapezoidal connecting rod configurations 57<br>
assumes the same angular positions with respect to the rotary plate 58. The T-form<br>
implementation of the members 65 takes place through a connection with further connecting rods<br>
65a, joined torsionally tight, whose lower ends are connected via pairs of not especially<br>
emphasized pivot bearings with the horizontal lower edges of wedge-form extension arms 61,<br>
disposed at the lower ends of substrate holders 13. This movement forced by the angle levers 59<br>
is tracked synchronously by all other trapezedidal connecting rod configurations 57.<br>
[0084] Thereby the extension arms 61 are pulled in and the substrate holders 13 secured thereon<br>
standing in oblique position. The layout of the trapezoidal connecting rod configurations 57 is<br>
made such that a vertical component of the radial movement is minimal. At the end of the radiai<br>
movement the substrate holders 13 assume the positions 13a, indicated in Fig. 8 in dot-dash<br>
lines, opposite the treatment chambers 27 and 28. The same applies to the positions of the<br>
substrate holders 13 opposite the further treatment chamber and the transfer chamber, which<br>
have here been omitted for the sake of clarity The radially outer end position of the substrate<br>
holders 13 is shown in Fig. 9 by means of continuous lines.<br>
[0085] In conjunction with Fig, 10, Figs. 8 and 9 are compared with one another utilizing the<br>
[0086] previous reference symbols and their continuation. Shaft 56 is guided through the bottom<br>
17 of the inner chamber component 16 by means of a a combination 66 of an upper rotary<br>
bearing and a vacuum leadthrough by means of a torsion-tight circular disk-form support plate<br>
67. The lower end of shaft 56 is axially displaceable in a lower rotary bearing 68, which, in rum,<br>
is supported in a further rotary disk 69, which in the upward direction bears a cylindrical riser 70<br>
with penetrations 71 and a radial flange 72, onto which is s« the rotary plate 58 with the<br>
trapezoidal connecting rod* configurations 57. The sealing toward the downward direction takes<br><br>
place through a stationary support plate 73, which is set vacuum-tight into the bottom 23 of the<br>
outer chamber component 22 and beneath the end of the shaft 56 is provided with a pot-form<br>
prolongation 74 for the lowering of the shift 56.<br>
[0087] It is clearly evident lhat through the lifting of the shaft 56 in the direction of arrow 75 the<br>
entire trapezoidal connecting rod configurations 57, and therewith the substrate holders 13, are<br>
synchronously displaceable via the angle levers 59 and the distance connecting rods 62 in the<br>
direction of arrow 76, since the extension atoms 61 are articulatedly pivoted on the lower ends of<br>
the connecting rods 65a fixedly connected with the members 65.<br>
