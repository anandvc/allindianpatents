 Chemical Compounds<br>
The present invention relates to certain novel compounds. In particular, the present<br>
invention relates to compounds that activate human peroxisome proliferator activated receptors<br>
("hPPARs"). The present invention also relates to method for preparing the compounds, their use<br>
in medicine, pharmaceutical compositions containing them and methods for the prevention or<br>
treatment of PPAR mediated diseases or conditions.<br>
Several independent risk factors have been associated with cardiovascular disease. These<br>
include hypertension, increased fibrinogen levels, high levels of triglycerides, elevated LDL<br>
cholesterol, elevated total cholesterol, and low levels of HDL cholesterol. HMG CoA reductase<br>
inhibitors ("statins") are useful for treating conditions characterized by high LDL-c levels. It has<br>
bean shown that lowering LDL-c is not sufficient for reducing the risk of cardiovascular disease in<br>
some patients, particularly those with normal LDL-c levels. This population pool is identified by<br>
the independent risk factor of low HDL-c. The increased risk of cardiovascular disease<br>
associated with low HDL-c levels has not yet been totally successfully addressed by drug therapy<br>
(Bisgaier, C. L.; Pape, M. E. Curr. Pharm. Des. 1998, 4, 53-70).<br>
Syndrome X (including metabolic syndrome) is loosely defined as a collection of<br>
abnormalities including hyperinsulemia, obesity, elevated levels of the following: triglycerides, uric<br>
acid, fibrinogen, small dense LDL particles, and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1), and<br>
decreased levels of HDL-c.<br>
NlDDK/I is described as insulin resistance, which in turn causes anomalous glucose output<br>
and a decrease in glucose uptake, by skeletal muscle. These factors eventually lead to impaired<br>
glucose tolerance (IGT) and hyperinsulinemia.<br>
Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors (PPARs) are orphan receptors belonging to<br>
the steroid/retinoid receptor superfamily of ligand-activated transcription factors. See, for<br>
example Willson T.M. and Wahli, W., Curr. Opin. Chem. B!ol., 1, pp235-241 (1997) and Willson<br>
T.M. et. al., J. Med. Chem., 43, p527-549 (2000). The binding of agonist ligands to the receptor<br>
results in changes in the expression level of mRNAs encoded by PPAR target genes.<br>
Three mammalian Peroxisome Proliferator Activated Receptors have been isolated and<br>
termed PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma, and PPAR delta (also known as NUC1 or PPAR beta).<br>
These PPARs regulate expression of target genes by binding to DNA sequence elements, termed<br>
PPAR response elements (PPRE). To date, PPREs have been identified in the enhancers of a<br>
number of genes encoding proteins that regulate lipid metabolism suggesting that PPARs play a<br>
pivotal role in the adipogenic signalling cascade and lipid homeostasis (H. Keller and W. Wahli,<br>
Trends Endocrinol. Metab 291 -296, 4 (1993)).<br>
It has now been reported that the thiazolidinedione class of drugs are potent and selective<br>
activators of PPAR gamma and bind directly to the PPAR gamma receptor (J. M. Lehmann et. al.,<br>
J. Biol. Chem. 12953-12956, 270 (1995)), providing evidence that PPAR gamma is a possible<br>
target for the therapeutic actions of the thiazolidinediones.<br>
Activators of the nuclear receptor PPAR?, for example rosiglitazone, have been shown in<br>
the clinic to enhance insulin-action, reduce serum glucose and have small but significant effects<br>
on reducing serum triglyceride levels in patients with Type 2 diabetes. See, for example, D. E.<br>
Kelly et al., Curr. Opin. Endocrinol. Diabetes, 90-96, 5 (2), (1998); M. D. Johnson et al., Ann.<br>
Pharmacother., 337-348,32 (3), (1997); and M. Leutenegger et al., Curr. Ther. Res., 403-416, 58<br>
(7), (1997).<br>
The mechanism for this triglyceride lowering effect appears to be predominantly increased<br>
clearance of very low density lipoproteins (VLDL) through induction of lipoprotein lipase (LPL)<br>
gene expression. See, for example, B. Staels et al., Arterioscler. Thromb., Vase. Biol., 1756-<br>
1764,17 (9), (1997).<br>
Fibrates are a class of drugs which may lower serum triglycerides 20-50%, lower LDLc 10-<br>
15%, shift the LDL particle size from the more atherogenic small dense to normal dense LDL, and<br>
increase HDLc 10-15%. Experimental evidence indicates that the effects of fibrates on serum<br>
liplds are mediated through activation of PPARa. See, for example, B. Staels et al., Curr. Pharm.<br>
Des., 1-14,3 (1), (1997). Activation of PPARa results in transcription of enzymes that increase<br>
fatty acid catabolism and decrease de-novo fatty acid synthesis in the liver resulting in decreased<br>
triglyceride synthesis and VLDL production/secretion. In addition, PPARa activation decreases<br>
production of apoC-lll. Reduction in apoC-lll, an inhibitor of LPL activity, increases clearance of<br>
VLDL. See, for example, J. Auwerx et al., Atherosclerosis, (Shannon, Ire!.), S29-S37,124<br>
(Suppl), (1996).<br>
Certain compounds that activate or otherwise interact with one or more of the PPARs have<br>
been implicated in the regulation of triglyceride and cholesterol levels in animal models. See, for<br>
example, U.S. Patents 5,847,008 (Doebber et al.) and 5,859,051 (Adams et al.) and PCT<br>
publications WO 97/28149 (Leibowitz et al.), WO99/04815 (Shimokawa et al.) and WO 01/00603<br>
(Glaxo Group Ltd.). Oliver et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci, 98, 5306-5311 (2001) reports raising of<br>
HDLc and lowering of serum triglycerides in the obese rhesus monkey following administration of<br>
a PPAR delta agonist.<br>
Accordingly the invention provides a compound of formula 1 and pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable salts and solvates and hydrolysable esters thereof.<br>
wherein:<br>
R1 and R2 are independently H or C1-3 alkyl;<br>
X represents a O or (CH2)n where n is 0,1 or 2;<br>
R3and R4 independently represent H, C1-6 alkyl, -OCH3, -CF3, allyl, or halogen;<br>
XI represents O, S, SO2, SO, or CH2;<br>
R5 and R6 independently represent hydrogen, C1-6alkyl (including branched alkyl and<br>
optionally substituted by one or more halogens or C1-6alkoxy), or together with the carbon atom to<br>
which they are bonded form a 3-6 membered cycloalkyl ring;<br>
R7 represents a phenyl or a 6 membered heteroaryl group containing 1, 2 or 3 nitrogen<br>
atoms wherein the phenyl or heteroaryl group is substituted by 1,2 or 3 moieties selected from<br>
the group consisting of halogen, C1-6alkoxy, C1-6 alkyl, CF3, hydroxy, or phenyl (which may be<br>
optionally substituted by one or more C1-3 alkyl, -OC1-3 alkyl, CN, acetyl, hydroxy, halogen or CF3).<br>
In another aspect, the present invention discloses a method for prevention or treatment of a<br>
disease or condition mediated by one or more human PPAR alpha, gamma or delta ("hPPARs")<br>
comprising administration of a therapeutically effective amount of a compound of this Invention.<br>
hPPAR mediated diseases or conditions include dyslipidemia including associated diabetic<br>
dyslipidemia and mixed dyslipidemia, syndrome X (as defined in this application this embraces<br>
metabolic syndrome), heart failure, hypercholesterolemia, cardiovascular disease including<br>
atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis, and hypertriglyceridemia, type II diabetes mellitus, type I<br>
diabetes, insulin resistance, hyperlipidemia, Alzheimers disease and other cognitive disorders,<br>
inflammation, epithelial hyperproliferative diseases including eczema and psoriasis and conditions<br>
associated with the lung and gut and regulation of appetite and food intake in subjects suffering<br>
from disorders such as obesity, anorexia bulimia, and anorexia nervosa. In particular, the<br>
compounds of this invention are useful in the treatment and prevention of diabetes and<br>
cardiovascular diseases and conditions including atherosclerosis, arteriosclerosis,<br>
hypertriglyceridemia, and mixed dyslipidaemia.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions comprising<br>
a compound of the invention, preferably in association with a pharmaceutically acceptable diluent<br>
or carrier.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides a compound of the invention for use in<br>
therapy, and in particular, in human medicine.<br>
In another aspect, the present invention provides the use of a compound of the invention for<br>
the manufacture of a medicament for the treatment of a hPPAR mediated disease or condition.<br>
As used herein, "a compound of the invention" means a compound of formula (I) or a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salt, or solvate, or hydrolysable ester thereof.<br>
While hydrolyzable esters are included in the scope of this invention, the acids are<br>
preferred because the data suggests that while the esters are useful compounds, it may actually<br>
be the acids to which they hydrolyse that are the active compounds. Esters that hydrolyse readily<br>
can produce the carboxylic acid in the assay conditions or in vivo. Generally the carboxylic acid is<br>
active in both the binding and transient transfection assays, while the ester does not usually bind<br>
well but is active in the transient transfection assay presumably due to hydrolysis. Preferred<br>
hydrolysable esters are C1-6alkyl esters wherein the alkyl group may be straight chain or<br>
branched chain. Methyl or ethyl esters are more preferred.<br>
Preferably R1 and R2 are both H or both Me. More preferably both R1 and R2are H.<br>
Preferably R3 and R4 are independently H or C1-3 alkyl. More preferably, at least one of R3<br>
and R4 are hydrogen and when one of R4 and R3 is hydrogen and the other is not, then the<br>
one that is not hydrogen is preferably ortho to the depicted moiety X. Most preferably the<br>
one that is not hydrogen is methyl.<br>
Preferably X is O.<br>
Preferably X1 is O or S.<br>
Preferably R5 and R8 are independently hydrogen or C1-6 alkyl (optionally substituted by<br>
C1-6 alkoxy). More preferably one of R5 and R6 is H. Most preferably one of R5 and R6 is H<br>

Preferably R7 is phenyl or a 6 membered heterocycle selected from pyrimidine, pyridine,<br>
pyridazine, pyrazine, each of which phenyl or heterocycle is substituted by phenyl<br>
(optionally substituted by one or more C1-3 alkyl, CN, CF3, halogen). More preferably R7 is a<br>
phenyl or pyridine ring which is substituted meta to the depicted moiety X1 by para<br>
-C6H4CF3, para -C8H4Me, para -C6H4CN or para -C8H4CI.<br>

While the preferred groups for each variable have generally been listed above separately<br>
for each variable, preferred compounds of this invention include those in which several or each<br>
variable in Formula (I) Is selected from the preferred, more preferred, or most preferred groups for<br>
each variable. Therefore, this invention is intended to include all combinations of preferred and<br>
most preferred groups.<br>
Those skilled in the art will recognize that stereocentres exist in compounds of formula (I).<br>
Accordingly, the present invention includes all possible stereoisomers and geometric isomers of<br>
formula (I) and includes not only racemic compounds but this invention is also intended to cover<br>
each of these isomers in their racemic, enriched, or purified forms. When a compound of formula<br>
(I) is desired as a single enantiomer, it may be obtained either by resolution of the final product or<br>
by stereospecific synthesis using an optically active catalyst or a catalytic system with optically<br>
active ligands or isomerically pure starting material or any convenient intermediate. Resolution of<br>
the final product, an intermediate or a starting material may be effected by any suitable method<br>
known in the art. See, for example, Stereochemistry of Carbon Compounds by E. L. Eliel<br>
(Mcgraw Hill, 1962) and Tables of Resolving Agents by S. H. Wllen. Additionally, in situations<br>
where tautomers of the compounds of formula (I) are possible, the present invention is intended<br>
to include all tautomeric forms of the compounds. In particular, in many of the preferred<br>
compounds of this invention the carbon atom to which R5 and R6 are bonded is chiral. In some of<br>
these chiral compounds the activities at the various PPAR receptors varies between the S and R<br>
isomers. Which of these isomers is preferred depends on the particular desired utility of the<br>
compound. In other words, even with the same compound, it Is possible that the S isomer will be<br>
preferred for some uses, while the R isomer will be preferred for others.<br>
The hPPAR agonists of formula (I) may be agonists of only one type ("selective agonists"),<br>
agonists for two PPAR subtypes ("dual agonists"), or agonists for ail three subtypes ("pan<br>
agonists"). As used herein, by "agonist", or "activating compound", or "activator", or the like, is<br>
meant those compounds which have a pKi of at least 6.0 preferably at least 7.0 to the relevant<br>
PPAR, for example hPPARS in the binding assay described below, and which achieve at least<br>
50% activation of the relevant PPAR relative to the appropriate indicated positive control in the<br>
transfection assay described below at concentrations of 10-5 M or less. More preferably, the<br>
agonists of this invention achieve 50% activation of at least one human PPAR in the relevant<br>
transfection assay at concentrations of 10-6 M or less. Preferably the compounds are hPPARS<br>
agonists. More preferably the compounds are selective hPPARS agonists.<br>
It will also be appreciated by those skilled in the art that the compounds of the present<br>
invention may also be utilised in the form of a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof.<br>
The physiologically acceptable salts of the compounds of formula (I) include conventional salts<br>
formed from pharmaceutically acceptable inorganic or organic acids or bases as well as<br>
quaternary ammonium acid addition salts. More specific examples of suitable acid salts include<br>
hydrochloric, hydrobromic, sulfuric, phosphoric, nitric, perchloric; fumaric, acetic, proplonlc,<br>
succinic, glycolic, formic, lactic, maleic, tartaric, citric, palmoic, malonic, hydroxymaleic,<br>
phenylacetic, glutamic, benzoic, salicylic, fumaric, toluenesulfonic, methanesulfonic, naphthalene-<br>
2-sulfonic, benzenesulfonic hydroxynaphthoic, hydroiodic, malic, steroic, tannic and the like.<br>
Other acids such as oxalic, while not in themselves pharmaceutically acceptable, may be useful in<br>
the preparation of salts useful as intermediates in obtaining the compounds of the invention and<br>
their pharmaceutically acceptable salts. More specific examples of suitable basic salts include<br>
sodium, lithium, potassium, magnesium, aluminium, calcium, zinc, N.N'-dibenzylethylenediamine,<br>
chloroprocaine, choline, diethanolamine, ethylenediamine, N-methylglucamine and procaine salts.<br>
Those skilled in the art of organic chemistry will appreciate that many organic compounds can<br>
form complexes with solvents in which they are reacted or from which they are precipitated or<br>
crystallized. These complexes are known as "solvents". For example, a complex with water is<br>
known as a "hydrate". Solvates of the compound of formula (I) are within the scope of the<br>
invention. References hereinafter to a compound according to the invention include both<br>
compounds of formula (I) and their pharmaceutically acceptable salts and solvates.<br>
The compounds of the invention and their pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives are<br>
conveniently administered in the form of pharmaceutical compositions. Such compositions may<br>
conveniently be presented for use in conventional manner in admixture with one or more<br>
physiologically acceptable carriers or excipients.<br>
While it is possible that compounds of the present invention may be therapeutically<br>
administered as the raw chemical, it is preferable to present the active Ingredient as a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation. The carriers) must be "acceptable" in the sense of being compatible<br>
with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further provides for a pharmaceutical formulation<br>
comprising a compound of formula (I) or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt or solvate thereof<br>
together with one or more pharmaceutically acceptable carriers therefore and, optionally, other<br>
therapeutic and/or prophylactic ingredients.<br>
The formulations include those suitable for oral, parenteral (including subcutaneous e.g. by<br>
injection or by depot tablet, intradermal, intrathecal, Intramuscular e.g. by depot and intravenous),<br>
rectal and topical (including dermal, buccal and sublingual) administration although the most<br>
suitable route may depend upon for example the condition and disorder of the recipient. The<br>
formulations may conveniently be presented in unit dosage form and may be prepared by any of<br>
the methods well known in the art of pharmacy. All methods include the step of bringing into<br>
association the compounds ("active ingredient") with the carrier, which constitutes one or more<br>
accessory ingredients. In general the formulations are prepared by uniformly and intimately<br>
bringing into association the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid carriers or<br>
both and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired formulation.<br>
Formulations suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as<br>
capsules, cachets or tablets (e.g. chewable tablets in particular for paediatric administration) each<br>
containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient; as a powder or granules; as a<br>
solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid or a non-aqueous liquid; or as an oil-in-water liquid<br>
emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion. The active ingredient may also be presented as a<br>
bolus, electuary or paste.<br>
A tablet may be made by compression or moulding, optionally with one or more accessory<br>
ingredients. Compressed tablets may be prepared by compressing in a suitable machine the<br>
active ingredient in a free-flowing form such as a powder or granules, optionally mixed with a<br>
other conventional excipients such as binding agents, (for example, syrup, acacia, gelatin,<br>
sorbitol, tragacanth, mucilage of starch or polyvinylpyrrolidone), fillers (for example, lactose,<br>
sugar, microcrystalline cellulose, maize-starch, calcium phosphate or sorbitol), lubricants (for<br>
example, magnesium stearate, stearic acid, talc, polyethylene glycol or silica), disintegrants (for<br>
example, potato starch or sodium starch glycollate) or wetting agents, such as sodium lauryl<br>
sulfate. Moulded tablets may be made by moulding in a suitable machine a mixture of the<br>
powdered compound moistened with an inert liquid diluent. The tablets may optionally be coated<br>
or scored and may be formulated so as to provide slow or controlled release of the active<br>
ingredient therein. The tablets may be coated according to methods well-known in the art.<br>
Alternatively, the compounds of the present invention may be incorporated into oral liquid<br>
preparations such as aqueous or oily suspensions, solutions, emulsions, syrups or elixirs, for<br>
example. Moreover, formulations containing these compounds may be presented as a dry<br>
product for constitution with water or other suitable vehicle before use. Such liquid preparations<br>
may contain conventional additives such as suspending agents such as sorbitol syrup, methyl<br>
cellulose, glucose/sugar syrup, gelatin, hydroxyethylcellulose, carboxymethyl cellulose, aluminum<br>
stearate gel or hydrogenated edible fats; emulsifying agents such as lecithin, sorbitan mono-<br>
oleate or acacia; non-aqueous vehicles (which may include edible oils) such as almond oil,<br>
fractionated coconut oil, oily esters, propylene glycol or ethyl alcohol; and preservatives such as<br>
methyl or propyl p-hydroxybenzoates or sorbic acid. Such preparations may also be formulated<br>
as suppositories, e.g. containing conventional suppository bases such as cocoa butter or other<br>
glycerides.<br>
Formulations for parenteral administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile<br>
injection solutions which may contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which<br>
render the formulation isotonic with the blood of the intended recipient; and aqueous and non-<br>
aqueous sterile suspensions which may include suspending agents and thickening agents.<br>
The formulations may be presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example<br>
sealed ampoules and vials, and may be stored in a freeze-dried (lyophilised) condition requiring<br>
only the addition of a sterile liquid carrier, for example, water-for-injection, immediately prior to<br>
use. Extemporaneous injection solutions and suspensions may be prepared from sterile<br>
powders, granules and tablets of the kind previously described.<br>
Formulations for rectal administration may be presented as a suppository with the usual<br>
carriers such as cocoa butter, hard fat or polyethylene glycol.<br>
Formulations for topical administration in the mouth, for example buccally or sublingually,<br>
include lozenges comprising the active ingredient in a flavoured basis such as sucrose and acacia<br>
or tragacanth, and pastilles comprising the active ingredient in a basis such as gelatin and<br>
glycerin or sucrose and acacia.<br>
The compounds may also be formulated as depot preparations. Such long acting<br>
formulations may be administered by implantation (for example subcutaneously or<br>
intramuscularly) or by intramuscular injection. Thus, for example, the compounds may be<br>
formulated with suitable polymeric or hydrophobic materials (for example as an emulsion in an<br>
acceptable oil) or ion exchange resins, or as sparingly soluble derivatives, for example, as a<br>
sparingly soluble salt.<br>
In addition to the ingredients particularly mentioned above, the formulations may include<br>
other agents conventional in the art having regard to the type of formulation in question, for<br>
example those suitable for oral administration may include flavouring agents.<br>
It will be appreciated by those skilled in the art that reference herein to treatment extends to<br>
prophylaxis as well as the treatment of established diseases or symptoms. Moreover, it will be<br>
appreciated that the amount of a compound of the invention required for use in treatment will vary<br>
with the nature of the condition being treated and the age and the condition of the patient and will<br>
be ultimately at the discretion of the attendant physician or veterinarian. In general, however,<br>
doses employed for adult human treatment will typically be in the range of 0.02-5000 mg per day,<br>
preferably 1-1500 mg per day. The desired dose may conveniently be presented in a single dose<br>
or as divided doses administered at appropriate intervals, for example as two, three, four or more<br>
sub-doses per day. The formulations according to the invention may contain between 0.1-99% of<br>
the active ingredient, conveniently from 30-95% for tablets and capsules and 3-50% for liquid<br>
preparations.<br>
The compound of formula (I) for use in the instant invention may be used in combination<br>
with other therapeutic agents for example, statins and/or other lipid lowering drugs for example<br>
MTP inhibitors and LDLR upregulators. The compounds of the invention may also be used in<br>
combination with antidiabetic agents, e.g. metformln, sulfonylureas and/or PPAR gamma, PPAR<br>
alpha or PPAR alpha/gamma agonists (for example thiazolidinediones such as e.g. pioglitazone<br>
and rosiglitazone). The compounds may also be used in combination with antihypertensive<br>
agents such as angiotensin antagonists e.g. telmisartan, calcium channel antagonists e.g.<br>
lacidipine and ACE inhibitors e.g. enalapril. The invention thus provides in a further aspect the<br>
use of a combination comprising a compound of formula (I) with a further therapeutic agent in the<br>
treatment of a hPPAR mediated disease.<br>
When the compounds of formula (I) are used in combination with other therapeutic agents,<br>
the compounds may be administered either sequentially or simultaneously by any convenient<br>
route.<br>
The combinations referred to above may conveniently be presented for use in the form of a<br>
pharmaceutical formulation and thus pharmaceutical formulations comprising a combination as<br>
defined above optimally together with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier or excipient comprise<br>
a further aspect of the invention. The individual components of such combinations may be<br>
administered either sequentially or simultaneously in separate or combined pharmaceutical<br>
formulations.<br>
When combined in the same formulation it will be appreciated that the two compounds must<br>
be stable and compatible with each other and the other components of the formulation and may<br>
be formulated for administration. When formulated separately they may be provided in any<br>
convenient formulation, conveniently in such a manner as are known for such compounds in the<br>
art.<br>
When a compound of formula (I) is used in combination with a second therapeutic agent<br>
active against the same hPPAR mediated disease, the dose of each compound may differ from<br>
that when the compound is used alone. Appropriate doses wilt be readily appreciated by those<br>
skilled in the art.<br>
Compounds of this invention may be conveniently prepared by a general process wherein a<br>
moiety like (A) is coupled to an alcohol (B) using the Mitsunobu protocol (O. Mitsunobu, 1981,<br>
Synthesis p1) or by alklylaton of (A) using a suitable non nucleophilic base such as K2CO3,<br>
Cs2CO3 or NaH, with an alkyl halide (C).<br>
Compounds of this invention may be conveniently prepared by a general process wherein a<br>
moiety like (A) is coupled to an alcohol (B) using the Mitsunobu protocol (O. Mitsunobu, 1981,<br>
Synthesis p1) or by alklylaton of (A) using a suitable non nucleophilic base such as K2CO3,<br>
Cs2CO3 or NaH, with an alkyl halide (C).<br>
Note this synthesis is preferably carried out with the acid group protected by R to give<br>
intermediate (D). Preferably R is C1-6alky! which can be hydrolysed to give an acid of formula (1),<br>
or if readily hydrolyzable, the resulting ester can be administered. The groups R1-R7 and X1 of<br>
intermediate (D) can be further modified to provide further compounds of formula (1) by standard<br>
chemistry.<br><br>
Intermediates of formulae (A), (B), (C) and (D) are commercially available or may be<br>
synthesised as outlined below. Alcohol (B) can be converted to alkyl halide (C) using standard<br>
halogenation conditions.<br>
For example, when X1 is O or S, the following synthetic schemes may be followed.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
Mitsunobu followed by hydrolysis<br>
The following synthetic schemes may be followed to prepare intermediate (B) where R5 is H<br>
and 'ring" represents a phenyl or a 6 membered heteroaryl group containing 1, 2 or 3 nitrogen<br>
atoms:<br>
Scheme 8<br>
Alkylation, then Suzuki followed by reduction (or reduction followed by Suzuki) of a<br>
carboxylic acid derivative (E).<br>
Scheme 9<br>
Oxidation, then Suzuki followed by alkylation (or alkylation followed by Suzuki) of an alcohol<br>
derivative (F).<br>
Other intermediates may be prepared as described in text below or in published literature<br>
e.g. WO 01/00603 and their synthesis will be apparent to a person skilled in the art.<br>
The following illustrates Intermediates and Examples of Formula 1 which should not be<br>
construed as constituting a limitation thereto.<br>

General procedure for Examples 123-126<br>
The following compounds were prepared using a similar procedure to Examples 113-117<br>
except the mixtures were not reduced after the Mitsunobu reaction but were treated directly with<br>
MeOH (2 mL) and aqueous NaOH (2 mL), stirred for 3 h and then quenched with aqueous HCI<br>
(2N, 2 mL) and reduced. The residue was then suspended in a DCM (ca. 1 mL) and filtered<br>
through a bond elut cartridge directly onto a SPE (silica, 5 g cartridge) washing with a more DCI<br>
(2 x 0.5 mL). The cartridge was left to dry and the compound purified using the OPTIX-SPE (Si<br>
cartridge, 5g) eluting with cyclohexane:EtOAc (gradient 85:15 to 0:1) over 15 mins to afford the<br>
desired products which were purified further by repeated SPE or mass directed autoprep HPLC<br>

This compound was used as a PPAR alpha reference in the transfection assay described<br>
below and was prepared according to method reported in WO200140207-A1<br>
(iii) 5-{[4-({2-[Methyl(2-pyridtnyl)amino]ethyl}oxy)phenyl]methyl}-1,3-thia2olidine-2,4-dione<br>
This compound was used as a PPAR gamma reference in the transfection assay described<br>
below and was prepared according to method reported in J.Med.Chem. 1994, 37(23), 3977<br>
Binding Assav:<br>
Compounds were tested for their ability to bind to hPPAR gamma, hPPAR alpha, or hPPAR<br>
. delta using a Scintillation Proximity Assay (SPA). The PPAR ligand binding domain (LBD) was<br>
expressed in E. coli as polyHis tagged fusion proteins and purified. The LBD was then labelled<br>
with biotin and immobilised on streptavidin-modif ted scintillation proximity beads. The beads were<br>
then incubated with a constant amount of the appropriate radioligand (3H-BRL 49653 for PPAR<br>
gamma, and labelled GW 2433 (see Brown, P. J et al. Chem. Bio!., 4, 909-918 (1997) for the<br>
structure and synthesis of this ligand) for PPAR alpha and PPAR delta and variable<br>
concentrations of test compound, and after equilibration the radioactivity bound to the beads was<br>
measured by a scintillation counter. For each compound tested, plots of ligand concentration vs.<br>
CPM of radioligand bound were constructed and apparent Ki values were estimated from<br>
nonlinear least squares fit of the data assuming simple competitive binding. The details of this<br>
assay have been reported elsewhere (see, Blanchard, S. G. et. al. Development of a Scintillation<br>
Proximity Assay for Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma Ligand Binding Domain.<br>
Anal. Biochem., 257,112-119 (1998)).<br>
Transfection assay:<br>
Compounds were screened for functional potency in transient transfection assays in CV-1<br>
cells for their ability to activate the PPAR subtypes (transactivation assay). A previously<br>
established chimeric receptor system was utilized to allow comparison of the relative<br>
transcriptional activity of the receptor subtypes on the same target gene and to prevent<br>
endogenous receptor activation from complicating the interpretation of results. See, for example,<br>
lehmann, J. M.; Moore, L B.; Smith-Oliver, T. A.; Wilkison, W. O.; Willson, T. M.; Kliewer, S. A.,<br>
An antidiabetic thiazolidinedione is a high affinity ligand for peroxisome proliferator-activated<br>
receptor gamma (PPARgammaJ, J. Biol. Chem., 270, 12953-6 (1995). The ligand binding<br>
domains for murine and human PPAR alpha, PPAR gamma, and PPAR delta were each fused to<br>
the yeast transcription factor GAL4 DNA binding domain. CV-1 cells were transiently transfected<br>
with expression vectors for the respective PPAR chimera along with a reporter construct<br>
containing five copies of the GAL4 DNA binding site driving expression of secreted placenta!<br>
alkaline phosphatase (SPAP) and beta-galactosidase. After 16 h, the medium was exchanged to<br>
DME medium supplemented with 10% delipidated fetal calf serum and the test compound at the<br>
appropriate concentration. After an additional 24h, ceil extracts were prepared and assayed for<br>
alkaline phosphatase and beta-galactosidase activity. Alkaline phosphatase activity was<br>
corrected for transfection efficiency using the beta-galactosidase activity as an internal standard<br>
(see, for example, Kliewer, S. A., et. al. Cell 83, 813-819 (1995)). Rosiglitazone (BRL 49653) was<br>
used as a positive control in the hPPAR gamma assay. The positive control in the hPPAR alpha<br>
assays was 2-methyl-2-[(4-{[({4-methyl-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,3-thiazol-5-<br>
yl}carbonyl)amino]methyl}phenyl)oxy]propanoic acid. The positive control for PPAR delta assays<br>
was ({2-methyl-4-[({4-methyl-2-[4-(trifluoromethyl)phenyl]-1,3-thtazol-5-<br>
yl}methyl)thio]phenyl}oxy)aceticacid.<br>
All of the above acid Examples showed at least 50% activation of PPAR8 relative to the<br>
positive control at concentrations of 10-7 M or less.<br>
