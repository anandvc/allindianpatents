				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of corrosion protection copolymer coating of iron based surfaces.<br>
More particularly the invention relates to a copolymer of aniline and o-phenetidine and a process for the preparation of the said copolymer.<br>
The corrosion of iron and mild steel is an enormous problem throughout the world. Giving an anticorrosion treatment to articles of iron and materials containing iron is considered essential for durability of the articles due to hostile environmental parameters of humidity, salinity of water. Many kinds of treatment, paints and coatings have been developed over the years to address this problem For a coating to protect iron against corrosion, it should restrict access of water, oxygen and other oxidants to the iron surface. In some instances, corrosion inhibitors such as zinc coatings or organic amines are used. Recently much interest has been shown in the use of conductive polymers in corrosion protection of articles made from iron or mild steel. These articles may be such as huge ships used for marine transport.<br>
Reference may be made to disclosure by Thompson et. Al., in "Corrosion-Protective<br>
Coatings from Electrically Conductive Polymers", Proceedings from Technology 2001, San<br>
Jose, California. In this disclosure is reported conductive polymer coatings for the protection<br>
of iron surfaces from corrosion. These coatings involved electrically conducting forms of<br>
several polymers, including polyaniline which had been appropriately doped with additives<br>
such as serving as electron acceptors to increase conductivity of the polymer. These<br>
polymers were used by applying un doped chemically prepared polymers to the steel surface<br>
and subsequent doping of the	coated surface to the conductive<br><br>
steel surface and subsequent doping of the coated surface to the conductive state. Doped polyaniline was converted to a non-conducting emeraldine base which was dissolved in an organic solvent such as, N-methyl-pyrrolidinone (NMP) and coated on steel after which the coating was doped to the conducting state. The dopants used were tosylate ions, zinc nitrate and tetracyanoethylene. After doping a top coat of standard fully cured epoxy was applied to provide abrasion resistance. In this disclosure the coating of the polymer dissolved in NMP is effected for curing by heating to a temperature of at least 95°C. The use of high temperature with NMP as the solvent is highly undesirable as during high temperature treatment the NMP releases toxic gases. This work reported a corrosion barrier coating for steel made from an electrically conducting polymer which resists the transfer of electrons from iron to the oxidizing environment. The coating was said to have two layers: an undercoat of polyaniline on steel surface and an epoxy top coat for durability. The bilayer coating was reported to be more effective in resisting corrosion than a coating with epoxy alone. In another disclosure (US Patent, 5441772 of August 1995) a method of protecting carbon steel substrates from corrosion environments is provided by a coating of emeraldine base which has been chemically prepared and cast onto the substrate from NMP solution. The coating also includes other polymers such as polyimides, epoxies and urethane linked diisocyanates, among others. This invention also suffers from the disadvantage of the use of NMP which uses high temperature treatment for effecting a protective coating.<br><br>
US Patent #5441772 (August 1995) provides a method of protecting carbon steel substrates from corrosion environments by a coating of emeraldine base which has been chemically prepared and cast onto the substrate from NMP solution. The coating also includes other polymers such as polyimides, epoxies and urethane linked diisocyanates, among others. In this patent disclosure, emeraldine base is dissolved in N-methyl pyrrolidinone which is then applied on carbon steel substrates. A temperature of 80-90°C is required to evaporate the NMP solution resulting in toxic NMP vapours.<br>
US Paten t# 5853621 (December 1998) describes an anti corrosion paint of the type comprising one or more polymeric binders dispersed in liquid medium with an effective amount of non-conductive conjugated polymers. In this patent disclosure, polyaniline is mixed with a dispersant from Daniel Products in a solvent propylene glycol methyl ether acetate and aromatic naptha 100. US Patent # 5922466 (July 1999) relates to the development of a composite comprising a metal substrate and a corrosion protecting layer on at least one major surface, a composition comprising a thermoset or thermoplastic polymeric matrix and a conductive filler component comprising polyaniline, and other conducting polymers. In this patent, a composition of thermoplastic or thermoset polymeric matrix along with polyaniline is applied on iron substrate. For thermoplastic coating a temperature ranging from 100-200°C is required which is the melting point of the polymeric material. This blend is then applied on the iron surface. In this case first the temperature needed is very high and secondly this type of process is not suitable for industrial applications because the coating can<br><br>
be applied only when it is in the melt stage and once the temperature lowers down, solidification will start leading to the requirement of again raising the temperature to desired level to effect the coating..<br>
US Patent # 6015613 (January 2000) provide a method of forming corrosion inhibition multilayer coatings. When the coating is bonded to a substrate, it forms an inter layer between the metal and substrate. The laminates serve to protect the metal surface from corrosion in acid, salt and alkaline corrosive environments. In the said patent disclosure, C1018 steel electrodes were brush coated with a dispersion of polyaniline and poly(butylmethylacrylate) in butyrolactone. The coating coupons were allowed to dry at 30°C in an air convection oven. An epoxy topcoat of Carboline 890 was then applied at 60°C. In this case, only a dispersion of polyaniline in solvent is used which may not spread uniformly on the surface and once the surface is exposed to hostile atmosphere, corrosion rate may be accelerated.<br>
US Patent # 6239251 (May 2001) discloses a method of forming low molecular weight oligomers of aniline based compounds which are end fictionalized and capable of being reacted with other monomeric species to form a variety of copolymers. In this patent, aniline is polymerized in the presence of 1,4-phenylenediamine, 1,4-aminodiphenyl amine, n.n'diphenylhydrazine, benzidine and the like. The coating of the above copolymer was prepared by dissolving the copolymer in dimethylformamide (DMF) and then combining with epoxy resin in the form of bisphenol-A-diglycidyl ether. Curing was then done at 120°C for 1 pur. The temperature required for curing in the disclosure is 120°C.<br><br>
The main objective of the present invention is to provide a conducting copolymer useful for corrosion protection coating of iron and mild steel which obviates the drawbacks as mentioned above.<br>
Another objective of the present invention is to provide process for the preparation of copolymer of aniline and o-phenetidine as a common organic solvent soluble polymer useful for the prevention of corrosion of iron and mild steel in hostile saline atmosphere.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide a single coat of copolymer for the anti corrosive coating.<br>
An improved method of protection of corrosion for iron and mild steel is provided by applying to the surface of steel a coating of a copolymer of aniline and substituted aniline comprising of phenetidine, hexyl aniline and phenoxy aniline. As a further embodiment of our invention, mild steel is coated with a protective film of copolymer of aniline and substituted aniline which are soluble in common organic solvents unlike the parent polymer polyaniline base for which an organic solvent N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) is used which requires 80-100°C for drying on the surface. In the present case a coating of copolymer mixed with other materials like polyimides, epoxy resins, CTE Resin is also applied on the surface for the corrosion protection of iron and mild steel against hostile environment like saline water comprising NaCI, MgCI2, BaCI2 and so on. The coating gives anti corrosive property which is stable for at least one year and upto a temperature of about 400 ° C<br><br>

In still another embodiment of the present invention the good quality water may<br>

In a further embodiment of the present invention the copolymer may be stable up<br>
to a temperature of 400 ° C.<br>
The process of preparation of conducting    polymer is described herewith.<br>
Monomer   aniline and monomer o-phenetidine are taken in a glass reaction<br>
vessel containing concentrated    hydrochloric acid    kept at 0°C. This reaction<br>
mixture is stirred and drop wise aqueous solution of an  oxidant is added. The<br>
oxidant may be ammonium peroxysulphate, potassium persulphate, sodium<br>
persulphate, ferric chloride, ferric p-toluene sulphonate and the like..More<br>
preferably ammonium peroxysulphate is taken. The reaction mixture is stirred<br>
preferably for 4 hours, till a brownish precipitate of copolymer is obtained. The<br>
mixture is filtered and washed thoroughly with good quality water and preferably<br>
distilled water though de ionised water may also be suitably used,, till the colour<br>
of the filtrate is colourless. The polymer so obtained is treated with aqueous<br>
ammonia solution and stirred for about 2 hours. The reaction mixture is again<br><br>
filtered and washed thoroughly with god quality    water. The precipitate so<br>
obtained is vacuum dried at about 55°C. The resultant copolymer was dissolved<br>
in an organic solvent   to get the   solution.   The organic solution used was<br>
preferably  methanol and the said copolymer solution was used on iron electrode<br>
to study its behaviour as a corrosion preventive coat in saline water.<br>
The    Copolymer of aniline and phenetidine was coated on iron surface by<br>
spraying/brush coating. Multiple coats were given on the surface and the amount<br>
coated was determined by weighing the electrode before coating and after<br>
coating.<br>
Weight loss measurements and Tafel Plot Electrochemical measurements were<br>
carried out to determine the corrosion inhibition efficiency.<br>
In the weight loss experiments blank iron electrodes and iron electrodes coated<br>
with copolymer were suspended in saline water preferably with 3.5% NaCI (This<br>
value was taken   because the saline water has this much % age of sodium<br>
chloride in it) for 15 days. The weight of iron electrodes were then noted and the<br>
weight loss in both cases were used for evaluating the corrosion inhibition<br>
efficiency. By the following expression<br>
Corrosion inhibition efficiency = [ (W1 - W2 ) / W1]   x 100<br>
where Wi is the weight loss of iron electrode in saline water without coat and W2<br>
is the weight loss of iron electrode coated with copolymer in saline water.<br>
Corrosion inhibition efficiency was also calculated by electrochemical technique<br>
using Tafel  Extrapolation  Method where electrochemical parameters were<br>
determined by taking iron electrode in 3.5 % NaCI and iron electrode coated with<br><br>
copolymer in 3.5 % NaCI with Platinum as the counter electrode and saturated calomel electrode as the reference electrode. The parameters determined gave the corrosion inhibition efficiency of: 95.6 %<br>
Besides giving a corrosion resistance to a bare iron based surface by a coat of copolymer, the corrosion inhibition efficiency may also be increased by applying coat of a mixture of an epoxy with the copolymer. Preferably a 10% mixture of coal tar epoxy mixed with copolymer may be used to coat the iron surface. However a mixture of 1-20% cola tar epoxy with copolymer may be used . In this case of coating of copolymer with a pre-coat of a mixture of coal tar epoxy and copolymer a corrosion inhibition efficiency of 99.995 was achieved.<br>
Organic compounds and polymers inhibit corrosion by absorbing at the metal surfaces Modes of absorption are dependent on Chemical structure of the molecule like presence of ° bonds or available loan pair of electrons., type of metal surfaces, electrochemical potential at the metal solution surface and complexing of molecules with metal ions neutralizing corrodant.<br>
In case of conducting polymer coating adsorption takes place via functionalised nitrogen atoms of polymer nucleus oriented towards the metal surface and through the de localized  electrons with the aromatic rings parallel<br>
to the electrode surface.<br>
The novelty of the present invention is the low temperature processing (30-50 °C ) of application of co polymer coating on iron or mild steel substrates for anti corrosion with an efficiency of at least 95% A further novelty of the invention lies in eliminating the use of toxN methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP) Both?,<br><br>
these novelties are realized  due to the inventive step  of preparation of copolymer of aniline and o-phenetidine by oxidation .<br>
The following examples are given to illustrate the process of the present invention and should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
