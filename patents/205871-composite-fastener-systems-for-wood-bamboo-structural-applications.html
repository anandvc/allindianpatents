GRANTED<br>
ORIGINAL<br>
2-6-2005<br><br>
This invention relates to novel, cost-effective and easy to install wood-bamboo composite fastener systems to achieve desired strength and load transfer capacity with displacements restricted to stipulated limits, under all conditions of loading. Further, attachments and inserts, along with tension bolts and stress lamination devices of high strength corrosion resistant materials, with provision for retightening, to compensate dimensional changes are incorporated in the wood-bamboo composite fastener system.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
There are two categories of wood engineering applications.<br>
This first category is based on round wood poles of diameter of 100 mm -200 mm and length of 3-5m used as columns and piles and to construct space frames. A publication titled "Thin poles of round wood for structural engineering applications in building" by P. Huybers in Structural engineering review 1990, Delft University", p.p. 169-182 discloses the cost effective use of round poles for a variety of structures. For joinery, dowels with wire lacing tools are used. The wire-lacing tool does not allow cyclic tightening process to reduce residual deformation. However the advantage of this technique is the prospect of using short rotation forestry wood or coppice timber<br>
Other publications that describe the use of joinery as applied to wood are 'Maximum strength of wire laced dowel joints for round wood" by Rogier Houtman et.al, in proceedings of the 5th World conference on Timber engineering, Montreux, Switzerland, Aug 17-20, 1998 Vol. 2, p.p. 161-176 ; The block Shear joint, a new joint for Round wood structures" by Erik W.P.SIuis et.al published in proceedings of the 5th World conference on Timber engineering, Montreux, Switzerland, Aug17-20,1998 p.p.268-275 &amp; 500-OU7.<br>
In the Indian situation, the availability of round wood in the above mentioned sizes is yet limited. Efforts have been made to extend the joinery techniques for fabrication with bamboo as its supply can be rapidly augmented with short rotation farm forestry. Bamboo has been used extensively in South America employing such joinery techniques. A comprehensive review of joinery of bamboo in its natural circular section is available in the INBAR report by Jules .A. Janssen (INBAR report- A review of techniques for joints is available in "Designing and Building with Bamboo " INBAR Technical report no. 20, Jules .A. Janssen,2000). Although techniques reported in the above mentioned reports, open up possibilities of large-scale use of bamboo as structural material, yet the range of applications is restricted by limited capacities of the members &amp; joints.<br>
It is therefore, necessary to focus attention on wood-bamboo composites to build up large sections for use as beams, columns, and members for a range of other major structural applications.<br><br><br>
The use of wood &amp; bamboo for this purpose belongs to the second category of major wood engineering applications based on laminates &amp; built up members<br>
Present wood engineering practice for major applications is based on the use of laminates of 4 to 20 mm thickness to form glue or stress laminated members of large size upto 200 x 600 mm or more. These laminates are used in conjunction with built up members of cut wood in the range of 50-100mm to 150-300mm with lengths of 3-5m.Current engineering practice is described in standard publication such as "Wood engineering handbook", Forest Product Laboratory, USDA, 1956 and "Timber design and construction handbook", 1956 published by F.W. Dodge Corporation. New York, p.p.52-72.<br>
"Glulam semi-Rigid Portal frames Composed of Hardwood Wedges &amp; Metal Wares" by Kohei Komatsu &amp; Kiyoshi Hosokawa, published in the proceedings of the 5th World conference on Timber engineering, Montreux, Switzerland Aug17-20, 1998 Vol.2, p.p. 246 -253 and "Mechanical performance of Fiberglass Reinforced Timber joints" by Chen Chi-Jen, published in proceedings of the 5th World conference on Timber engineering, Montreux, Switzerland, Aug17-20, 1998 Vol. 2 p.p. 500-507 disclose recent advances in wood engineering technology. Dan A. Tingley, wood science &amp; Technology Institute, 1996 CERF Charles Pankow Award for Innovation winner, Washington DC and "Design, Testing and Erection of the Hiroshima Airport Bridge" by P.C.Gilham and Y.limura, published in the proceedings of the International Wood Engineering Conference, Louisiana, USA, Oct 28-31, 1996 Vol. 2 p.p. 2/209-2/216 convincingly establish the capability of engineered wood as material of adequate durability &amp; structural strength to build large bridges and roof supports, ranging from 20 to 70 m span respectively.<br>
In this category of applications, the raw material consists of high quality wood from natural forests or plantations with rotation period exceeding 20 years. Such material is not easily available in India. Another disadvantage is the high cost glue for lamination &amp; large investments are required for processing &amp; fabrication<br>
An invention for cost effective manufacture of wood bamboo composites is disclosed in a co-pending patent application number 2345/RQ/2004 J8_t/MUM/2003, which is based on the dependable tensile strength of bamboo"" &amp; their ready availability in sufficiently long lengths(3-5m).The invention overcomes the disadvantage of low inter-fiber bond of bamboo &amp; uses stress-lamination techniques with designed interface irregularities to assemble members of required size (e.g100mm-600mm) with wood of 50 mm x 50mm of relatively short lengths. The invention also includes high strength bamboo micro and macro fiber laminates and resin blend of phenol and lignin liquor.<br><br>
"Strength of Filled Bamboo Joint" by Morisco and Fitri Mardjono, published in the Proceedings of the Vth International Bamboo Workshop and the IVth International Bamboo Congress, Ubud, Bali, Indonesia, June 19-22, 1995 Vol. 3, INBAR Technical Report No. 8, p.p. 113-120 discloses that if no hollows are left, the performance of the joint improves however in this case hollow is filled by cement mortar which is subject to dimensional instability due to shrinkage/swelling of mortar/bamboo. In the present invention, split bamboo is used &amp; normal stress on the surface of the filling is applied by use of fixtures such as band, bolts which makes retightening possible.<br>
Fasteners of various types consisting of nails, spikes, bolts &amp; special connectors such as split-ring connectors, tubular dowels, shear plates, toothed rings, spiked grids, clamping plates etc. are used in conventional wood engineering practices. Wood applications which require high-grade timber to fabricate structural assemblies such as beams, columns, trusses and other forms of built up sections are described in Timber design and construction handbook, 1956 published by F.W. Dodge Corporation. New York, p.p.52-72. Fasteners are required to resist forces acting on them while the deformation under load has to be restricted to meet design requirements.<br>
The type of loading is a decisive factor in the choice of fastenings. For example, duration of load influences allowable loads while the duration of loading is determined by the use of structural component / type of fastening. Vibrations or reversal of loads tend to loosen some fastenings. Unless appropriately designed, some fasteners tend to loosen under such loading e.g. a tight fit is difficult to achieve in bolts. A line contact occurs in loose fitting bolts. This is also a cause of local high stresses and consequent increase in displacement of the joint and reduction in joint capacity. The stress concentration at the contact of the fastener with the hole in the wood-bamboo, causes splitting and lowers the bearing strength of wood and bamboo.<br>
"The Concept of the Prestressed DVW (Densified Veneer Wood) Reinforced Joint with Expanded Tubes" is disclosed by Ad.J.M. Leijten in the Proceedings of International Wood Engineering conference, Louisiana,USA Oct 28-31,1996 Vol. 2 p.p. 2/295-299 ). These techniques require high cost materials as well as tools to achieve designed capacity and to limit deformation under the load.<br>
Joints in bamboo &amp;wood (including round timber poles) members used in structural applications have been a major problem. Connectors in the prior art, also do not give reliable load transfer in small wood and bamboo due to poor inter-viber bond and cracking, brooming, splitting which occur at the contact with b amboo. Additional provisions are necessary for small wood and bamboo applications subjected to crushing and brooming of the fibers and splitting in the zcnes of stress concentration even under normal loads<br><br>
It has been a long-standing need in wood engineering and bamboo applications to develop high performance fastener system to achieve tight fit without stress concentration thereby mitigating crushing and splitting of wood and bamboo and controlling the deformation. Further the fasteners system should be capable of being fabricated and installed without the use^special and costly equipments. Such high performance yet economical fastener system would overcome the limitations of conventional fasteners such as bolts, nails, shear plates, split rings, clamping plates and wedges and have desired capacity considerably higher than the conventional fasteners. The high performance fastener system would perform satisfactorily in bamboo and common grades of small wood, which are susceptible to crushing, cracking and splitting at the holes, notches, near knots and other defects. Use of high-grade timber produced in the main forests would be avoided as far as possible.<br><br>

Brief Description of the Drawings<br>
Figure 1 shows different forms of the fasteners.<br>
Figure 2 shows wedge shaped composite dowels with stress lamination bolts.<br>
Figure 3 shows a complete assembly of cylindrical dowels, inserts of high strength bamboo laminates, tension bolts with washers in over size holes and stress lamination bands.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The invention consists of a composite system of fasteners of various forms and materials to facilitate use of wood and bamboo and their composites to fabricate and assemble structural members for various engineering applications.<br>
The performance requirements, with regard to strength, load transfer capacity with specified deformations, can be achieved only when the wood-bamboo composite fastener system is adopted by using designed irregularities, along with stress lamination devices and dowels, inserts, bolts/bands for inducing confinement. Individual components such as composite wedges used in isolation in the prior art cannot guarantee the performance.<br><br><br>
Various forms of fasteners e.g. circular, rectangular wedges, diamond shaped inserts, split sleeve etc. are used in the invention with stress lamination devices, bands, wires and tension bolts to improve bearing strength and resistance to indentation and splitting/ brooming. Metal plates with serrations &amp; indentations are used in combination with the stress lamination bolts or bands to transfer the load from the individual member to another. The plates are also bent and shaped to bond with the diamond shaped inserts. Consequently high capacity, low deformation under long-term loading, reduced creep and ability to withstand stress repetition and reversal are achieved.<br>
The invention aims at overcoming the limitations of bamboo arising from poor inter fiber bond and tendency of brooming and splitting at locations subjected to stress concentration, resulting from transfer of loads from one member to other or from one part of the member to other portions as required to perform the structural function.<br>
By use of composite fastener systems, structural components and their assemblies can perform the desired functions as struts, ties, beams, etc.<br>
Monolithic action of the assembly and shear resistance of the members and joints is realised through stress lamination achieved by use of steel rods / bolts with nuts and washers or bands, assembly of wires etc. The loads are transferred through the inserts and dowels by bearing, or by gripping action of serrated plates or friction at the interface.<br>
By use of various devices, the designed load transfer capacity is achieved with the designed margin of safety with reference to yield or failure. The deformations resulting from the load transfer are limited to the design levels by precompression of the dowels and wedges.<br>
The geometry and the forms chosen are such as to ensure that loss of shear resistance due to dimensional changes is prevented. This is achieved through a combined action of stress lamination bolts and designed irregularities, like serrations, undulations, etc.<br>
The capacity of bolts or dowels to transfer the loads by bearing is enhanced by virtue of the confining stress induced by the action of stress lamination devices consisting of bolts, bands, etc. Further improvement in bearing capacity is achieved by providing metal plates or by insertion of laminates in critical zones subjected to high bearing stress. The wedges and split sleeves are tightened to ensure that load transfer is achieved with displacement limited to allowable \ alues as per design requirements.<br>
Figure 1 shows foims of fasteners for making composite wood bamboo assembly. The numbered parts are as follows:<br><br><br>
Hard wood wedges (1) for getting a,tight fit of the split tube dowel in wood and bamboo and expanding the split metal tube (3). A bamboo laminate insert (2) installed in the wood to give a good bearing surface for the split tube dowel. A type of hard wood wedge dowel (4) strengthened by metal wedges (5) on both bearing surfaces. A diamond shaped insert (6) .A variant of the diamond shaped insert (7). Another variant of the diamond shaped insert, with strengthening metal plates bent around the periphery (8). A metal dowel with threaded ends (9), over which nuts can be tightened to induce normal stress.<br>
Figure 2 shows composite dowels and tension bolts inducing stress lamination. U bolts (1) are used for inducing normal stress on the irregularities / undulations (3) created at the interfaces of wood and split bamboo (4). A nail plate (5) is pressed down by a washer plate (6) in the flattened region by the U-bolt (1). A high strength bamboo fiber laminate dowel (2) is used for connecting split bamboo (4) to the wood. A variant of the wedge dowel, is a hardwood wedge dowel strengthened by a metal plate bent around its periphery (7). Another variant is a high strength bamboo fiber laminate wedge dowel (8). In another variant of the wedge dowel, a vertical bolt is introduced (9).<br>
Figure 3 shows composite assemblies of wood and bamboo using dowels, inserts, tension bolts and stress lamination bands. The figure shows a method of connection of half split bamboo (1) to wood (2) through hardwood inserts (4). Stress lamination is achieved through bands / wire loops (3). The loops / bands are tensioned by tightening of the transverse bolts (7) which press onto the plates (5) welded to the loops/bands (3). A split circular tube dowel (10) consisting of the split metal tube (9) and the wedging wood pieces (8). A serrated nail plate (6) is fixed to top surface of bamboo by means of nails and screws.<br>
The present invention makes use of wedge shaped dowels to transfer load from bamboo to wood. The problem of poor inter-fiber bond is overcome by applying confining stress using bands, tension bolts, wire etc. So also interface shear is mobilized by designed irregularities such as indentation, undulation, serration, &amp; using inserts of high strength woods reinforced by metal plates or fiber reinforced plastics (FRP).<br>
Presence of confining bolts and designed irregularities results in reduced space for making wood-to-wood connections. This entails use of special fasteners for transferring load from wood to wood e.g. tubular dowels are usually preferred over bolts for vibratory, reversible, and impact loading.<br>
High strength low compressibility fiber lami late inserts are used to mobilize specified dowel strengths with deformations limited to designed requirements which can be as small as 1 mm at working lo ad.<br><br><br>
Steel tube dowels are used with * inserts of densified wood veneer with surface reinforcement of glass fibre. The present invention is an improvement, which obviates the need for special tools and expand dowel &amp; precompress the densified wood veneer. The dowel system uses split metal tubes with hard wood wedges and inserts of bamboo laminates to achieve capacity &amp; reduce the deformation while reducing the cost &amp; using simple tools.<br>
A composite fastener of this invention is an improvement over conventional fasteners comprising wedges or dowels of wood and bamboo of low strength. The invention combines the benefit of higher strength of steel or other metals and fiberglass and the compressibility of wood, which ensure closeness of fit. In the case of composite fastener the operations are significantly simplified as the pre-compression of the hole is done only in the wood component of the member.<br>
By using bamboo / fiber laminate of high strength of this invention, improved capacity is achieved without pre-compression of the holes in the bamboo fiber laminate inserts. In contrast to the conventional mechanical fasteners, the composite fastener systems of this invention, installed in the pre-bored holes with a tight fit, ensure relatively high bearing capacity without brooming or splitting failure, particularly in the zones of stress concentration.<br>
Incorporation of tension bolt on either side of the dowel adds to the capacity by mobilizing interface friction, and increases the bearing capacity of the wood or bamboo by bolt-induced confining stress. The composite fastener combines action of several resisting mechanisms apart from increasing the strength achieved by virtue of the strength of the steel or the fiber reinforced plastic added to the low cost easy to install wedges of wood or bamboo fiber laminates. The composite fasteners of this invention are amenable to installation in the stress-laminated members where the bolts or bands used for stress lamination enhance the resistance to cracking. Further the interface friction and shear resistance helps to add to the capacity. Individually the components such as wedge shaped dowels, diamond shaped inserts &amp; stress lamination without design irregularity does nor ensure that load transfer capacity is achieved with deformation limited to values specified in the design.<br>
The invention has the benefits of various mechanisms used in combination, such as bearing of the fasteners on the surface of tight fitting holes and stress lamination achieved by use of tension bolts. Use of oversized holes for tension bolts minimizes the adverse effects of stress concentration and crushing at the line contact of the bolts. The tension bolts induce normal stresses in the potential slippage plane thereby enhancing the interface shear resistance. Such confining stress also improves the resistance to indentation on the surfaces of the holes where the fasteners are installed.<br>
The dowel of this invention can be installed using simple tools similar to those used for installing conventional wood and bamboo dowels and wedges. The<br><br><br>
split sleeve and wooden wedges allow lateral expansion to ensure a tight fit in the hole.<br>
High strength bamboo /fiber laminate used as insert or attachment provides higher strength, lower compressibility thereby eliminating the need to precompress the portion of the hole where the high strength laminate is provided. Thus the operations for the final assembly can be simplified.<br>
Crack formation due to defects in the wood is arrested where ever the surfaces of wood is bonded with fiber-reinforced piastic or high strength bamboo /fiber laminates. Surfaces of holes are coated with fiberglass or suitable adhesive. In addition, bamboo can be impregnated with suitable resin to prevent splitting or cracking or brooming or local failure by indentation.<br>
Durability of the construction is ensured by using composite dowels of hollow tubes of corrosion resistant metal, mouldings of wedge shape or other shapes of high strength bamboo fiber laminate, fiber reinforced plastic etc. The fastener may be used with advantage for joints, splices &amp; connections of high capacity wood /bamboo composite members. Fasteners would ensure monolithic action for reinforcement of wood /bamboo composites attached externally to concrete or brick masonry.<br>
Prior art reported in "Design, Testing and Analysis of Bamboo-wood-concrete composite Beams by the Society for Advancement of Renewable Materials and Energy Technology (SARMET), March 2001 submitted to the International Network for Bamboo ana Rattan (INBAR), discloses that, the deformation caused by presence o: the hollow in the bamboo culms compromises the efficacy of stress lamination.<br>
In this invention use of wood filler of appropriate grade size and geometry, to fill the hollow of split bamboo is obligatory to ensure that deformation during tightening does not compromise the stress lamination benefits. The invention also uses tension bolts and precompression devices, which are located optimally and placed in the appropriate direction so that the designed confining and normal stress level is realised at the critical zones.<br>
The fasteners disclosed in this invention extend the range of applications of the wood bamboo composites for various uses as described below:<br>
&gt;	Beams, rafters, trusses, columns, posts applied to construction of buildings, bridges &amp; industrial structures.<br>

&gt;	Wood /bamboo gabions for coffer dams storage reservoirs, overflow diversion weirs etc.<br><br><br>

Following non-limiting examples illustrate applications of the composite joinery system of this invention.<br>
Example-1 :<br>
Wood bamboo composite exhibited in Example-1 is typically an axial force resisting member applied to construction of trusses. The assembly consists split bamboo segments with fillers (2) attached to wood (3) using a threaded steel dowel (1). High strength bamboo fiber laminate inserts (4) are placed at the interface of wood (3) and bamboo (2) to enhance the bearing capacity. Hardwood wedges (5) are then fitted on either side of the steel dowel (1) to<br><br><br>
give a tight fit . A thin metal plate (6) is connected to the top surface of the bamboo (2) and enables transfer of load from the steel dowel (1) to the outer hard skin of the bamboo. This form / module can be easily built up, using transverse bolts or dowels, into members of a wide range of capacities. Applications include, space frame member, stanchions, tower-legs, etc.<br>
Example-2 :<br>
The wood bamboo composite assembly shown in Example-2 is designed to serve as a tower-leg. The member consists of thin bamboo strips (1) arranged one over another with adequate hardwood / wood filler (3) inserted in the hollows. These strips (1) are connected to the wood (2) by diamond shaped inserts (4) which bear on the wedges (5) which in turn bear on the high strength bamboo fiber laminate wedge dowels (6) or the threaded steel dowels (7), which transfer the load from the bamboo strips (1) to the wood (2) by bearing. Metal strips (8) with adequate holes / slots for bolts / dowels are used to distribute the confining stress developed by the bolts / dowels, uniformly over the surface of the assembly. Intermittently serrated plates (10) are introduced at the interfaces of bamboo and wood to enhance the transfer of shear.<br><br><br><br>
