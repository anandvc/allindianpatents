				<td>TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a diffused gas aeration apparatus used for: water treatment and water purification, of industrial effluent, supplied water and sewage, lakes and marshes, rivers, groundwater, and so on; removing and collecting foreign substances in gas; and a bioreactor or the like. Specifically, the present invention relates to an operation to mix and agitate gas and liquid to make a gas-liquid contact, and relates to a diffused gas aeration apparatus used for: dissolving oxygen in the air in water by aerating air in the water; diffusing a volatile substance such as ammonia., trichloroethane, methylene chloride, chlorine or trihalomethane that remains dissolved in water; removing and collecting a foreign substance in gas such a.s hydrogen chloride, sulfur dioxide or dust by means of reaction absorption and trapping; and further, enzymatic reaction, micro-organic reaction, and so on. BACKGROUND ART<br>
Conventional  diffused  gas  aeration  apparatuses  can  be<br>
classified  broadly  into  those  of  an  air-diffusing  method<br>
(bubble)  and those of a mechanical agitation method  (surface<br>
agitation).    As  shown  in  FIG.  16,  regarding  an  aeration<br>
processing apparatus 110 by means of the air-diffusing system in<br><br>
particular, a large number of panel diffusers 112, diffuser pipes and the like are disposed on the bottom of an aeration tank 111, and pressurized air is supplied thereto through an air blower 113 and a pneumatic dispatch line 114 to execute aeration processing. Further, when a nitrogen compound such as ammonia which remains dissolved in liquid is diffused and then cleaned and collected, a packed column, a plate column or the like is frequently used as shown in FIG. 17. In the case of a diffusion processing apparatus 115 of the packed column method, liquid is supplied from the upper part of a packed column 116, and gas is supplied from the lower part of the column. While gas-liquid contact takes place by a countercurrent through packing 117 placed inside the column, a volatile substance such as ammonia (NH4+), organic solvent, etc. in the liquid is diffused toward the gas side, so that the cleaning and collecting of the liquid are executed.<br>
Further, as a gas-liquid contact reactor for an apparatus of processing exhaust gas which contains dust and sulfurous acid gas, a cylindrical exhaust gas diffuser pipe with a number of gas blowoff holes is used. An exhaust gas treating method which uses this exhaust gas diffuser pipe is disclosed in Japanese Published Patent Application No. H7-308536 and Japanese Published Patent Application No. H9-8 65; however, gas-liquid contact efficiency between liquid and bubbles which pour out of a number of gas blowoff holes is low.  In addition, there is a<br><br>
problem of blockage caused by the accretionary growth of calcium sulfate, which is a reaction product.<br>
Further, regarding a diffused gas aeration apparatus using a conventional static mixer, oxygen absorption efficiency is low due to structural reasons; also, it is difficult to manufacture a diffused gas aeration apparatus with a wide bore (500mm or more in diameter), and even if possible, gas-liquid contact efficiency will be low. Further, the cost of production will be high.<br>
Furthermore, the bore diameter of an air blowoff hole of an air-supplying pneumatic dispatch tube that is disposed in the lower part of a conventional static mixer is in the range of 10 to 40mm. One or more blowoff holes are provided on the upper surface of this pneumatic dispatch tube.<br>
Since the diameter of each bubble supplied from the blowoff holes is large, gas-liquid contact efficiency is low and contact time is long.<br>
As a result, the total length of a static mixer becomes long, and apparatus cost becomes high.<br>

[Problems to be solved by the Invention]<br>
A conventional diffused gas aeration apparatus requires a large area, because oxygen dissolving efficiency and gas absorption efficiency are low. Further, more air than necessary that contains oxygen is pressurized and supplied to panel diffusers and the like to execute mixture and agitation in an aeration tank.  Thus, a great deal of electric power is consumed.<br><br>
Also, a conventional diffusion processing apparatus such as a packed column or a plate column requires periodic maintenance, because a calcium compound, microorganisms and the like in liquid adhere to packing, plates, etc. and grow, causing clogging. Further, a diffused gas aeration apparatus using a conventional static mixer has been low in oxygen absorption efficiency and it is difficult to increase in size. Accordingly, the present invention aims at providing a diffused gas aeration . apparatus in which effluent and the like are purified and also foreign substances in gas are removed and collected with improving gas-liquid contact efficiency, and executing aeration, diffusion and reaction treatment extremely effectively, in an energy-saving and space-saving manner, at low cost and without the need for maintenance. Further, the present invention aims at providing a bioreactor capable of being used for highly efficient enzymatic reaction and micro-organic reaction. [Means for Solving the Problems]<br>
A first diffused gas aeration apparatus of the present invention for solving the above-described problems is a diffused gas aeration apparatus including: a cylindrical passage tube substantially disposed vertically in which fluid passes in the longitudinal direction and in which a static mixer is provided, and a gas blowoff portion disposed on the lower end side of the passage tube, which gushes and supplies gas to the inside of the passage tube through a pneumatic dispatch line and in which a<br><br>
spray nozzle is provided; wherein gas is supplied to the gas blowoff portion of the pneumatic dispatch tube, liquid is introduced into the passage tube from the lower side of the passage tube, the gas and liquid flow upward in a parallel direction in the passage tube, and the gas and liquid come to gas-liquid contact inside the passage tube to be discharged into liquid from the upper end side of the passage tube. In such diffused gas aeration apparatus is disposed a static mixer which mixes and agitates fluid utilizing the flow energy of fluid requiring no mixture agitation power and is disposed a gas blowoff portion below the static mixer; and liquid is introduced from under the gas blowoff portion by means of the gushing energy. The gas and liquid flow in a parallel direction through the passage tube from the lower end side to the upper end side to be in gas-liquid contact and mixture, and then aeration, diffusion and reaction treatment are executed.<br>
Further, a second diffused gas aeration apparatus of the present invention for solving the above-described problems is a diffused gas aeration apparatus including: a cylindrical passage tube substantially disposed vertically in which fluid passes in the longitudinal direction and in which a static mixer is provided, and a gas blowoff portion disposed on the lower part of the passage tube, which gushes and supplies gas to the inside of the passage tube and in which a static mixer is provided; wherein gas is supplied to the gas blowoff portion, liquid is<br><br>
introduced into the passage tube from the lower side of the passage tube, the gas and liquid flow upward in a parallel direction in the passage tube, and the gas and liquid come to gas-liquid contact and mixture inside the passage tube to be discharged from the upper end side of the passage tube into liquid.<br>
Further, each of the static mixers disposed in the passage tube and disposed in the gas blowoff portion has a plurality of spiral blades which are either right twisted or left twisted to form a plurality of fluid passages, and the fluid passages are joined through an opening of blades in the longitudinal direction to each other, and the blades are formed of perforated boards.<br>
[Effect of the Invention]<br>
According to the diffused gas aeration apparatus of the present invention, power consumption can be reduced considerably, because gas-liquid contact efficiency is improved. Further, time required for aeration, diffusion and reaction treatment is reduced by improving gas-liquid contact efficiency. Furthermore, since gas-supplying ability is improved by the unit area with respect to the diffused gas aeration apparatus, a large area in the horizontal direction is not required for installation, leading to saving the space and to reducing construction engineering costs and apparatus costs to be low. Further, the construction cost of air-supplying pipes or the like is lowered.<br><br>
Moreover, no shutdown of operation owing to clogging arises, so that maintenance costs and manufacturing management costs become low.   Further,  since no stagnant part  (dead space)  of fluid exists, enlargement of the apparatus is facilitated. BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>

[Embodiment 6]<br>
FIG. 6 is a schematic diagram of a diffused gas aeration apparatus according to the first embodiment of the present invention. A diffused gas aeration apparatus 40 includes a cylindrical passage tube 43 in which a static mixer 41 is provided and a space portion 42 is provided below the static mixer 41, and two supporting boards 46 in which a gas blowoff portion 44 is provided to be connected to a pneumatic dispatch tube 45 which supplies gas. The pneumatic dispatch tube 45 has the gas blowoff portion 44 provided with a spray nozzle that gushes gas in the vertical direction, and the side opposite to the side where gas enters is closed. The diffused gas aeration apparatus 40 thus constructed is disposed in liquid, and with respect to gas (FG), pressurized gas (FG) is supplied from the gas blowoff portion 44 to the inside of the space portion 42 of the passage tube 43 through the pneumatic dispatch tube 45 by means of a blower, compressor or the like. The gas (FG) involving liquid (FL) from a liquid-introducing portion 47 on the lower end of the passage tube 43 and making the liquid (FL) accompany the gas (FG) by means of air-lift effect generated by the ascending force of the gas (FG) supplied, the gas (FG) and the liquid (FL) flow in a parallel direction, through the static mixer 41 to be in gas-liquid contact, and then are discharged into liquid, where aeration, diffusion and reaction treatment are performed.   Using the spray nozzle for the gas blowoff<br><br>
portion 44, gas (FG) is dispersed in liquid (FL) efficiently, thereby improving gas-liquid contact efficiency. It is preferable that this spray nozzle 48 be the one shown in FIG. 7, which is a conical, multilayered structure capable of being in a blowoff state. [Embodiment 7]<br>
FIG. 8 is a schematic diagram of a diffused gas aeration apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention. Similarly to FIG. 6, a diffused gas aeration apparatus 4 9 includes a cylindrical passage tube 50 which has at its lower part a space portion 52 and a liquid-introducing portion 53, a cylindrical pneumatic dispatch tube 55 which has a static mixer 51 and a gas blowoff portion 54, and two supporting boards 56 which support the passage tube 50 and the pneumatic dispatch tube 55. At the gas blowoff portion 54 is disposed a static mixer 57 formed of a plurality of right twisted spiral blades. Gas-liquid contact effect between gas (FG) and liquid (FL) is omitted on the grounds that it is similar to the above-described FIG. 6; since the static mixer 57 has been disposed at the gas blowoff portion 54 of the pneumatic dispatch tube 55, gas (FG) flows upward together with liquid (FL) in the space portion 52 of the passage tube 50 made to be fine by means of the occurrence of turbulence. The gas (FG) which has been made into fine structure and the liquid (FL) flow through the static mixer 51 to be in gas-liquid contact highly efficiently, and<br><br>
then are discharged into liquid, where aeration, diffusion and reaction treatment are operated.<br>
FIG. 9 is a partly schematic bottom view of a diffused gas aeration apparatus according to the second embodiment of the present invention. The bottom surface of a diffused gas aeration apparatus 58 includes three right twisted blades 60 provided inside a cylindrical passage tube 59 and a cylindrical pneumatic dispatch tube 61. The blades 60 are formed of perforated boards with a number of holes 62 bored in the thickness direction and have an opening 63 in the whole longitudinal direction of the blades 60.<br>
FIG. 10 is a partly schematic perspective view of a gas blowoff portion according to the second embodiment of the present invention. A pneumatic dispatch tube 64 has an inverted T-shape, a gas blowoff portion 65 is provided with three right twisted spiral blades 66 to form three fluid passages 67, and the fluid passages 67 are continuously joined to each other in the whole longitudinal direction of the blades 66 through an opening 68. The blades 66 are formed of perforated boards with a number of holes 69 that have been bored in the thickness direction. In this pneumatic dispatch tube "64, with respect to the flow of gas (FG), turbulence is caused by straight flow which moves straight through the opening 68, spiral flow which flows along the three spiral blades 66, and divided flow which passes through the holes 69 of the blades 66, so that gas (FG)<br><br>
is made into fine structure. Utilizing the gas (FG) of the fine structure, gas-liquid contact efficiency further improves. It should be noted that the twist direction of the blades 66, the twist angle thereof, the combination of the twist direction and angle thereof, the diameter of the holes thereof, and the aperture ratio of the holes thereof can be selected accordingly from a variety of examples. Further, it is preferable that the gas blowoff portion 65 be positioned at the distance of 0.2 to 3 times the diameter of the passage tube away from the lower end side of the static mixer provided in the above described passage tube 59. [Embodiment 8]<br>
FIG. 11 is a schematic sectional view of a diffused gas aeration apparatus according to the third embodiment of the present invention. With respect to a diffused gas aeration apparatus 70, two or more 90° right twisted blades 72 are provided in a cylindrical passage tube 71 in which fluid passes to form a static mixer 73; a cylindrical pneumatic dispatch tube 75 which supplies gas is disposed through an opening 74 in the static mixer 73; two gas blowoff portions 7 6 are disposed; and static mixers 77 are provided in the gas blowoff portions 76. The blades 72 are formed of. perforated boards with a number of holes 78. In the diffused gas aeration apparatus 70 thus constructed, gas (FG) pressurized by gas-supplying means such as a blower, compressor, gas cylinder (not shown in the figure),<br><br>
etc. is gushed and supplied in the upward direction from below the static mixer 73 through the pneumatic dispatch tube 75, the gas blowoff portion 7 6 and a space portion 79. By means of airlift effect generated by the ascending force of the gas (FG), liquid (FL) is introduced from a liquid-introducing portion 8 0 at the lower end of the passage tube 71 into the space portion 79 in the passage tube 71. the gas (FG) and accompanying liquid (FL) flow upward in a parallel direction in the passage tube 71 through the static mixer 73 to be made into fine structures and to be made in gas-liquid contact by means of mixture and agitation, and then are discharged into liquid. Thus, aeration, diffusion or chemical reaction continuously proceeds with liquid and gas being in gas-liquid contact with high efficiency. It should be noted that, similarly to the above described embodiments, the twist direction of spiral blades used in the embodiment; the twist angle thereof; the number thereof; the diameter of the holes thereof; the aperture ratio, diameter and height of perforated boards; etc. can be decided accordingly to the use. Since the bore of the passage tube 71 has been enlarged a great deal (500mm or more in diameter) , it is possible for the diffused gas aeration apparatus 7 0 to obtain energy saving due to improvement in gas-providing ability per piece of apparatus, leading to reaction management time to be shortened, space saving due to decrease in the volume of an aeration tank, and maintenance-free nature with a construction in which stagnant<br><br>
parts (dead spaces) of fluid do not arise. [Embodiment 9]<br>

Further, when a diffused gas aeration apparatus 81 with a diameter of 150mm is used, the area for aeration and agitation per piece of apparatus is 3 to 8m2. Furthermore, the blowoff pressure of the blower 83 may be the sum of the underwater pressure and the pressure loss of the pneumatic dispatch line 84.<br>
When comparing air-flow resistance of a. conventional panel diffuser method to that of the method according to the present invention, the resistance by the method of the present invention is 1/5 to 3/5. Further, the compared results of performance of conventional methods A, B, and C in which static mixers provided inside diffuser pipes are used, with the method by the present invention is shown in Table 1. As shown in Table 1, according to the. method of the present invention, the air-supplying ability per piece of apparatus is 100Nm3/m2 •Hr, whereas the conventional methods are 80, 12, and 17Nm3/m2•Hr.
