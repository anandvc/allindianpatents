DRAPE FOR CLEAN OPERATION<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to a drape for clean operation. The drape for clean operation is a medical device designed to maintain a substantially closed space around an operation site to allow the physician to perform an aseptic operation within the closed space, and used for avoidance of physician's contamination and bedside contamination by the blood. Background Art<br>
Up to now, surgical operations in operating rooms and catheter diagnosis or treatments in angiographic imaging rooms are performed in an environment that takes into account the protection of patients against bacterial infection.<br>
However, it is difficult to say that such an environment includes sufficient consideration of the physician's risks of infection caused by blood bled from the operative field or punctured site of the vessel. Thus, the physicians are obliged to perform operations in an environment where they are exposed to the risk of blood infection. Even in the conventional practice, the physician's risk of infection has been somewhat avoided by use of operating gowns and masks. However, these goods are designed for the main purpose of protection of the patients and are insufficient for<br><br>
avoidance of the physician's risk of infection.<br>
Accordingly, there are eager desires for supply of a device that enables to avoid the physician's risks of blood infection easily and completely without decreasing the freedom of the surgical procedure. On the other hand, the treatments involving surgical operations will have problems associated with the bedside contamination caused by the blood.<br>
Disclosure of Invention Problems to be solved by the invention<br>
The present invention has been made in view of the above circumstances and is intended to provide a drape for clean operation designed to provide a substantially closed space, which enables to perform an aseptic operation as well as to prevent both the bedside contamination and the physician's risk of infection caused by the blood.
