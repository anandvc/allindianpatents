Dispersion powders  containing fatty acid   anhydrides<br>
The invention   relates  to water-redispersible polymer   powder corrpositions  containing fatty acid  anhydrides  and  the use of these powders   in   hydraulically setting  systems.<br>
Polymers   based   on  vinyl   esters,   vinyl  chloride,    ( meth) acrylate monomers,   styrene,   butadiene  and   ethylene are used,    especially in the form of   their  aqueous  dispersions   or wat er-r edispersible polymer   powders,   in   many applications,   for   example  as   coating compositions   or  adhesives  for  a wide variety of   substrates.    To hydrophobicize the  mineral  corrpositions,   these dispersion powders   generally contain  fatty acid   esters   and/or   silanes.<br>
EP  1193287   A2   relates   to the use  of   powder  compositions comprising   at   least   one carboxylic   ester  for  hydrophobicizing building  c ompositions.    WO  02/30846   Al   discloses   granulated materials   f or   hydrophobicizati on  which  c ontain   f att y acids   or f att y acid   est ers ,   if   d esir ed   in  combination  with   organopoly-siloxanes ,   applied to carri er  particles.    Wat er-r edispersible, hydrophobicizing  additives  which contain  fatty acids   or  fatty acid   esters   are described  in   WO  2004/103928   Al.<br>
When the free fatty acid  is   used,   there is  frequently the danger  that  the mineral  composition  will   become stiff prematurely and  no  longer   remain  processible.    The  same danger exists   when  the corresponding   alkali   metal   or   alkaline   earth metal  salts   of  the fatty acids   are used.    To avoid  these problems,   recourse is  frequently  made to the use  of   esters   of fatty acids.    These are typically  methyl   or   ethyl   esters   or esters   of   low   molecular  weight   polyalkylene glycols   such  as ethylene glycol,   diethylene glycol  and  similar  compounds.    All these compounds  hydrolyse under   alkaline conditions   and therefore have a  hydrophobicizing   action   but   at   the same time liber at e undesirable   emission-relevant   substanc es   such   as methanol,    ethanol   or   ethylene  glycol.<br>
it   was   therefore an   object   of   the invention  to develop   a<br><br>
dispersion  powder  which  avoids  the disadvantages   of   the prior art.<br>
The invention   provides   wat er-r edispersible polymer   powder compositions  containing from 0. 1   to 70%   by weight   of   one  or more fatty acid   anhydrides,   based   on  the total  weight   of  the polymer  powd er  corrposition.<br>
Suitable fatty acid  anhydrides   are those of   branched   or unbranched,   saturated   or  unsaturated  fatty acids   having,   in each case,   from 8   to 22   carbon   atoms.    It   is   also possible to use  mixed   ( unsymmetrical)    anhydrides   of   the abovementioned fatty acids.    It   is   likewise possible to use mixed   anhydrides   of the abovementioned  fatty acids   with carboxylic   acids   having from 2   to 6   carbon   atoms,    e. g.    acetic   acid   or  propionic   acid. Preference is   given  to  symmetrical  fatty acid   anhydrides. Particular   preference is   given  to symmetrical  fatty acid anhydrid es   of   saturat ed   or   unsaturat ed   f att y acids   having,   in each case,   from 10   to  18   carbon   atoms,   for   example lauric   acid ( n-dodecanoic   acid) ,   myristic   acid   ( n-t etradecanoic   acid) , palmitic   acid   ( n-hexad ecanoic   acid) ,   st earic   acid   ( n-octa-decanoic   acid)   and   oleic   acid   ( 9-dode enoic   acid).<br>
These anhydrides   are prepared  by methods  with which those skilled   in  the art   are familiar.    A preferred   method   is   the reaction   of   an   acid  chloride with  an   acid,   with  the hydro¬chloric   acid  liberated   being driven   off.    Anhydrides  can   also  be obtained   by reaction   of  two fatty acid   molecules  with  a  strong mineral  acid.    If  two different   fatty acids   are used  here,   a mixture  of   symmetrical   and  unsymmetrical  anhydrides   is obtained.<br>
In   a  preferred   embodiment,   the wat er-r edispersible polymer powder  composition  comprises<br>
a)   from 60   to  99. 9%   by weight   of   one  or   more water-insoluble, f ilm-forming   bas e polymers   bas ed   on   homopolymers   or  copolymers of   one  or   more  monomers   from the group  consisting   of   vinyl est ers   of   unbranched   or   branched   alkylcarboxylic   acids   having<br><br>

c)	from 0  to 30%   by weight   of   one or   more protective colloids, in   each case based  on the total weight   of  the polymer  powder composition.<br>

The choice  of   monomers   and  the choice  of  the proportions   by weight   of  the comonomers   are  made so that   a  glass  transition terrperature Tg   of   from -50° C  to  +50° C,   preferably from -30° C  to +40° C,   results.    The glass   transition  terrperature Tg   of  the polymers  can   be determined   in   a  known   manner   by  means   of differential   scanning calorimetry (DSC).    The Tg  can   also  be calculated   approximately beforehand   by  means   of   the Fox equation.    According  to Fox  T.    G. ,   Bull.    Am    Physics   Soc.    1,   3, page  123   (1956):    1/Tg   =xl/Tgl   +  x2/Tg2   +  ...    +   xn/Tgn,   where xn   is   the   mass   fraction   (%   by weight/100)    of  the  monomer   n   and Tgn  is  the glass  transition temperature in  kelvin   of  the homopolymer   of   the  monomer  n.    Tg values  f or  homopolymers   are given   in  the  Polymer   Handbook   2nd   Edition,   J.    Wiley &amp;   Sons,    New York   (1975).<br>
The homopolymers   and copolymers  are prepared  by the  emulsion polymerization  process   or   by the suspension  polymerization process,   preferably by the  emulsion  polymerization  process, with the polymerization terrperature generally being from 40° C to  100° C,   preferably from 60° C to  90° C.    The copolymerization   of gaseous  comonomers  such  as   ethylene,   1,3-butadi ene or  vinyl chloride can   also  be carried   out   under  superat mospheric pressure,   generally in the range from 5   bar to  100   bar.<br>
The polymerization  is   initiated   by  means   of   the water-soluble or   monomer-soluble initiators   or  redox initiator  combinations customary for   emulsion  polymerization   or  suspension polymerization.    Examples   of  water-soluble initiators   are the sodium,   potassium and   ammonium salts   of   peroxodisulphuric   acid,.<br><br>
hydrogen  peroxide,   t-but yl  peroxide,   t-but yl hydroperoxide, potassium per oxodiphosphat e,   t ert -but yl  peroxopivalat e,   cumen e hydroperoxide,   isopropylbenz ene mon©hydroperoxide and  azobis -isobut yronitrile.    Examples   of   monomer-soluble initiators   are dicetyl peroxydicarbonat e,   dicyclohexyl  peroxydicarbonat e, dibenzoyl  peroxide.    The initiators   mentioned  are generally used in   an   amount   of   from 0.001   to 0.02%   by weight,   preferably from 0.001   to 0.01%   by weight,   in   each case based  on  the total w ei g ht   of  the   monomer s.<br>
As  redox initiators,   use is   made of  combinations   of   the above-mentioned  initiators  in  combination  with reducing  agents. Suitable reducing agents   are the sulphites  and   bisulphites   of the  alkali   metals   and   of   ammonium,   for   exarrple  sodium sulphit e, the derivatives   of   sulphoxyl   acid   such   as   zinc   or   alkali   metal formaldehyde sulphoxylat es ,   for   exarrple sodium hydr oxymethane-sulphinate,   and   ascorbic   acid.    The amount   of   reducing   agent   is generally from 0.001   to 0.03%   by weight,   preferablyfromO.OOl to 0.015%   by weight,   in   each  case  based   on  the total  weight   of the  monomers.<br>
To control  the  molecular  weight,   regulating substances   can   be used  during the polymerization.    If   regulators   are used,   they are usually used  in   amounts   of   from 0.01   to 5.0%   by weight, based   on  the  monomers  to  be polymerized,   and  are introduced separately or  premixed  with reaction components.    Examples   of such  substances   are n-dodecyl   mercaptan,   tert-dodecyl mere apt an ,   mere apt opr opi onic   ac id,   met h yl   mere at opr opi on at e, isopr opanol  and  ac etaldehyde.<br>
Suitable protective colloids  c)   for  the polymerization   are polyvinyl  alcohols;   polyvinyl  ac eta Is;   polyvinylpyrrolidones; polysaccharides   in  water-soluble form,    e. g.    starches   (amylose and   amylopectin) ,   celluloses   and their  carboxymethyl,    methyl, hydroxyethyl,   hydroxypropyl  derivatives;    prot eins   such   as cas ein   or  cas einat e,   s oya  prot ein,   gelatin;   lignosulphonat es; synthetic   polymers  such  as  poly( meth) acrylic   acid,   copolymers of   ( meth) acrylates   with  carboxyl-function  comonomer   units,.<br><br>
polyl meth) acrylamide,   polyvinylsulphonic   acids   and  their  water-soluble copolymers;    melamin-e f oriraldehyde sulphonates, napthalene formaldehyde sulphonates,   styrene-rraleic   acid  and vinyl   ether-maleic   acid  copolymers.<br>
Preference is   given  to partially hydrolysed  or  fully hydrolysed polyvinyl  alcohols   having a degree of   hydrolysis   of  from 80   to 100   mol%,   in  particular  partially hydrolysed polyvinyl   alcohols having  a  degree  of   hydrolysis   of   from 80   to  95   mol%   and   a Hoppler  viscosity in   4%  strength  aqueous   solution   of  from 1  to 30   mPas   (Hoppler   method   at   20°C,   DIN 53015).    Preference is   also given  to partially hydrolysed,   hydrophobically  modified polyvinyl   alcohols   having  a degree  of   hydrolysis   of   from 80   to 95   mol%   and   a   Hoppler  viscosity in   4%  strength  aqueous   solution of   from 1   to  30   mPas.    Examples   are partially hydrolysed copolymers   of   vinyl   ac etat e with  hydrophobic  comonomers   such  as isopropenyl   ac etat e,   vinyl  pivalat e,   vinyl   ethylhexanoat e, vinyl   est ers   of   saturat ed   alpha-branched   monocarboxylic   acids having  5   or  9  to 11  carbon   atoms,   dialkyl   rraleates   and  dialkyl fumarates,    e. g.   diisopropyl   maleate and diisopropyl fumarate, vinyl  chloride,   vinyl  alkyl   ethers   such  as  vinyl   butyl   ether, olefins   such  as   ethene and  decene.    The proportion   of   hydro¬phobic   units   is   preferably from 0. 1   to 10%   by weight,   based   on the total weight   of  the partially hydrolysed  polyvinyl  alcohol. It   is   also possible to use  mixtures   of  the polyvinyl  alcohols mention ed.<br>
The greatest   preference is   given  to polyvinyl   alcohols   having  a degree of   hydrolysis   of  from 85  to  94   mol%  and   a  Hoppler viscosity in   4%   strength  aqueous   solution   of  from 3  to  15   mPas (Hoppler   method  at   20°C,   DIN 53015).    The prot ective colloids mentioned  can   be  obtained   by  means   of   methods   known  to those skilled   in  the art   and   are generally added   in   a  total   amount   of from 1  to 20%  by weight,   based  on the total weight   of  the monomers,   in  the polymerization.<br>
If  the polymerization  is  carried  out  in the presence of emulsifiers,   they are present   in   an   amount   of   from 1   to  5%   by<br><br>
weight,   based   on the amount   of   monomers.    Suitable  emulsifiers include anionic,   cationic   and   also nonionic   errulsif i ers,   for example anionic   surfactants  such  as   alkylsulphat es  having  a chain   length   of   from 8   to  18   carbon   atoms,   alkyl   or   alkylaryl ether   sulphates   having  from 8   to  18   carbon   atoms   in  the hydro¬phobic   radical  and  up to  40   ethylene oxide or propylene oxide units,   alkylsulphonat es   or   alkylar ylsulphonat es   having  from 8 to 18   carbon  atoms,   esters   and   monoesters   of   sulphosuccinic acid  with   monohydric   alcohols   or   alkylphenols,   or  nonionic surfactants   such  as   alkyl  polyglycol   ethers   or   alkylaryl polyglycol   ethers  having from 8  to  40   ethylene  oxide units.<br>
After  the polymerization,   an  aft er-polymerization can   be carri ed   out   using  known   methods   toremove residual   monomers, generally  by  means   of   an   aft er-polymerization  initiat ed   by a redox catalyst.    Volatile residual   monomers  can   also  be removed by  means   of   distillation,   pr ef erably under  r educ ed   pr essur e, and,   if   appropriate,   with  inert   entrainer   gases   such  as   air, nitrogen   or  steam being passed   over   or  through the polymerization   mixture.    The aqueous  dispersions  which can   be obtained  in  this  way have a  solids   content   of  from 30   to  75%   by weight,   preferably from 50   to 60%   by weight.<br>
To produce the wat er-r edispersible polymer  powder  compositions, the fatty acid   anhydride component   b)   is   mixed  in  any desired way with  the aqueous   dispersion   of   the polymer   a)    and  the dispersion   is   subsequently dri ed.    Drying  is  carried   out,   for example,   by  means   of   f luidiz ed-bed  drying,   freeze drying   or spray drying.    Preference is   given  to spray drying.    Spray drying is  carried   out   in conventional  spray drying units,   with atomization   being  able to  be carried   out   by means   of   single-fluid,   two-fluid   or   multifluid  nozzles   or   a rotary atomizer disc.    The  outlet  temperature is   generally set   in  the range from 45°C  to 120°C,   preferably from 60° C to  90° C,   depending   on  the unit,   the Tg   of  the resin  and the desired  degree of  drying.<br>
Furthermore,   protective colloids  c)   can  additionally be used   as drying  aids   in  the production   of  the wat er-r edispersible<br><br>
polymer  powder  compositions.    The group   of   suitable drying   aids is  the same as   the abovementioned   group   of   protective colloids c)   for the polymerization.    The polymer  powder composition preferably contains  from 1  to 30%   by weight   of  protective colloid  c),   based   on   its  total  weight.<br>
In  spray drying,   a content   of   up to 1.5%   by weight   of   antifoam, based   on  the base polymer,   has  frequently been  found to  be<br>
advantageous.<br>
The viscosity  of  the feed  to  be  atomized  is   set   via  the solids content   so that   a value of    30%, preferably   &gt;   40%.<br>
In   a  further   preferred   embodiment,   the wat er-r edispersible polymer   powder  compositions   do not   contain   any polymer component   a),    but   instead  corrprise<br>
b)	from 5   to  70%   by weight   of   one  or   more fatty acid   anhydrides and<br>
c)	from 30   to  95%   by weight   of   one  or   more protective colloids, in   each case based   on the total  weight   of  the polymer  powder<br>
c omposition.<br>
To produce this   embodiment,   the fatty acid  anhydride is generally  mixed with  an  aqueous   solution   of  the protective colloid   and  the  mixture is   subsequently dried,   preferably spray dried.    Suitable and  preferred  fatty acid  anhydrides,   suitable and  preferred  protective colloids   and  suitable and  preferred drying   methods  correspond to the  embodiments   mentioned   above.<br>
Regardless   of   the conposition   of   the wat er-redispersible polymer  powder compositions,   further  additives  can   be added during  drying  to  improve the use properties.   Further constituents   of  the polymer  powder  compositions  which  are present   in  preferred   embodiments   are,   for   example,   antifoams, pigments,   foam stabilizers.<br><br>
Further  constituents   of   the wat er-r edispersible polymer   powder compositions  which  are present   in   preferred   embodiments   are organic   and  inorganic   additives.    Possible additives,   which  are not,   however,   restricted to the compounds   mentioned   below,   can be:    antifoams,   inorganic   or   mineral  antiblocking  agents   or fillers,   the additives  can   each   be present   in  an   amount   of   up to 50%   by weight,   preferably up to 30%   by weight,   particularly preferably up to 20%   by weight,   based   on the total weight   of the wat er-r edispersible polymer  powder  compositions.    Antifoams are usually present   in the wat er-r edispersible polymer  powder corrpositi ons   in   a  proportion   of   up  to  5%   by weight.<br>
It   is   also possible for   inorganic   or   mineral compounds   to  be present   in   the wat er-r edispersible polymer   powder  composition, preferably in   a proportion   of  from 5  to 30%  by weight.    These inorganic   additives   improve the storability of   the polymer powder  composition   by improving  the  blocking  stability,   in particular   in   the case  of   powders   having  a   low   glass  transition temperature.    Exanples   of   customary antiblocking   agents (anticaking  agents)    are Ca   or   Mg  carbonate,   talc,   gypsum, silica,   kaolins,   silicates   having particle sizes   of   preferably from 10   nm to  100   µm<br>
The water-r edisperisbl e polymer  powder  corrpositi ons   can   be used in  the fields   of   application  typical   of   them    They can   be used either   alone or  in combination  with conventional  redispersion powders.    They can   be used,   for   example,   in   building  chemical products,   if   appropriate in combination with hydraulically setting   binders  such  as  cements   (portland cement,   alumina cement,   pozzolanic  cement,   slag cement,   magnesia cement, phosphate cement) ,   gypsum plaster   and  water  glass,   for  the production   of   building   adhesives,   in   particular   tile adhesives and thermal  insulation   adhesives,   plasters   and  renders,   scim coat,   knifing  fillers,   flooring compositions,   self-levelling screeds,   sealing  slurries,   jointing   mortars   and   paints.    Further applications   are gunned   mortar, and  gunned concrete for   building and  construction   and   also for  the lining   of  tunnel  walls.    The<br><br>
wat er-r edispersible polymer  powder  compositions   can   also  be used   as   hydrophobicizing  agents  for  sand,   clay,   paper, textiles,   natural   or   synthetic   fibres.    The wat er-r edispersible polymer  powder  compositions  can   also  be used to   modify or coat surf ac es,   f or   example in  coating  and  varnish  applications.<br>
Surprisingly,   bett er  hydrophobicization  properties   are  obtained by  means   of   these polymer  powder  compositions  than   by  means   of the  more  mobile fatty acid   ester derivatives   or  the acids  which are directly present   in  the aqueous   phase.    Although  the fatty acid  anhydrides   are less  water-soluble and   also  less   mobile in order  to   migrate from the  organic   polymer  to the interface and to  hydrolyse,    excellent   hydrophobicizing  properti es   ar e nevertheless   obtained.    An  advantage here is  found  to  be that one  molecule  of   anhydride gives  two   molecules   of   fatty acid salt  which  are  each  activa    A further   advantage is  that   no emission-r elevant  corrpounds   are formed.<br>
Examples:<br>
Powders:<br>
The powders   were produced   by spray drying   a  polyvinyl   alcohol-stabilized  dispersion   of   an   ethyl en e-vinyl   acetate copolymer with   addition   of   6%   by weight   of   a  polyvinyl  alcohol   having   a degree of   hydrolysis   of   88   mol%   and  a  Hoppler  viscosity  of 4   mPas   and  with  addition   of   the fatty acid  derivative in  the amounts   indie at ed.<br>
The dispersion  was  then  sprayed   by means   of   a two-fluid  nozzle. Air  which   had   been  pr ecorrpr ess ed  to  4   bar   served   as   atomizing component,   and  the droplets   formed  were dried  in  cocurrent   by means   of   air  heated to 125° C.    The dry powder   obtained  was admixed  with  10%   by weight   of   commercial   antiblocking   agent (calcium rragnesium carbonat e) .<br>
Powder   PI:   containing  1%   by weight   of   lauric   anhydride<br>
Powder   P2:   containing   4%   by weight   of   lauric   anhydride<br><br>
1<br>
Powder   P3:    c ontaining  1%   by weight   of   palmitic   anhydrid e<br>
Powder   P4:   containing  2%   by weight   of   a   mixed  anhydride  of lauric   acid   and   ac etic   acid<br>
Comparative powder P5: containing 1% by weight of methyl laurat e  as   hydrophobicizing   agent<br>
Comparative powder   P6:    containing   4%   by weight   of   methyl<br>
laurat e  as   hydrophobicizing  agent<br>
Testing:<br>
Determination   of   the hydrophobicit y:<br>
To determine the hydrophobicit y,   a   mineral  composition  was   made up from 30%   by weight   of  c ement,   68%   by weight   of   sand   and   2% by weight   of   dispersion  powder.    After   addition   of   water,   a  test specimen  was   produced   and  dried.    A drop   of  water  was   then placed   on  this  test   specimen   by  means   of   a pipette and  the time for  which this  drop remained     on  the surface was   measured.<br><br>
It can be seen from the data that the hydrophobicization achieved using the product according to the invention is clearly superior  to that   obtained   using the standard   products.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
