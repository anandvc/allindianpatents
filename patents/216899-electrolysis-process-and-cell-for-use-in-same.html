				<td>ELECTROLYSIS PROCESS AND CELL FOR USE IN SAME<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The present invention relates generally to an electrolysis process for the<br>
recovery of metals from an aqueous solution and to an improved cathode for use in such<br>
a process. The primary application of the invention disclosed herein is in relation to the<br>
recovery of copper, although the invention finds equal application with electro-recovery<br>
of other metals such as nickel, lead, zinc etc.<br>
Background Art<br>
Processes for leaching base metals from ores and concentrates with subsequent<br>
recovery of the base metal in electrolytic cells are known in the field of the<br>
hydrometallurgy. One example is disclosed in Indian Patent Application No.<br>
656/Del/93 (187010). This process is multi-stage and produces a pregnant liquor<br>
stream following leaching of the mineral in a chloride medium. The pregnant liquor<br>
stream is electrolysed in an electrolysis cell to recover the metal from the solution<br>
which deposits on a cathode of the cell. Under high current densities, dendritic copper<br>
of high purity is produced on the cathode . In the past it has been necessary to regularly<br>
remove the cathodes to strip the plates of the metal deposits so as to maintain current<br>
efficiency in the cell.<br>
Optimisation of the electrowinning operation is a function of the purity of the<br>
pregnant liquor stream, and general cell parameters such as current density, stripping<br>
cycle, cell configuration and the degree of agitation. Accordingly, an aim of the present<br>
invention is to improve the efficiency of the electrowinning operation. In particular, an<br>
aim is to provide an electrolysis process and cell configuration which is able to better<br>
control current density across the deposition surface of the cathode so as to assist in<br>
both formation and removal of the metal deposit.<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
In a first aspect the present invention provides an electrolysis process for the<br>
recovery of metal from an aqueous solution wherein on electrolysing the solution metal<br>
is caused to deposit on a deposition surface of a cathode, the process including the step<br>
of<br>
inducing a non-uniform current density across the deposition surface so as<br>
to form areas of high current density interspaced by areas of flow current<br>
density, the difference between the areas of high current density and low<br>
current density being sufficient to cause metal deposition to be concentrated on<br>
the areas of high current density so as to promote non-uniform deposition of<br>
metal across the deposition surface.<br>
In the context of the invention, the deposition surface may be of unitary<br>
structure or alternatively may be formed from discrete elements which may be spaced<br>
apart or in direct contact with one another.<br>
Providing a non-uniform current density across the deposition surface provides<br>
a mechanism by which the deposition of metal on that surface can be controlled. In<br>
particular, it allows the metal deposition to be concentrated in certain areas (i.e. the<br>
areas of high current density) so as to promote non-uniform deposition across the<br>
surface. Non-uniform deposition of the metal is beneficial as it is easier to remove from<br>
the cathode which assists in the metal recovery process. ,.<br>
Preferably, the metal deposition is heavily concentrated on the areas of hi|;h<br>
current density so that the metal deposition is effectively discontinuous across the<br>
deposition surface. Preferably, the concentration of metal deposition in operation of the<br>
cell is greater than 80% in the areas of high current density and more preferably greater<br>
than 95%.<br>
Preferably, the areas of high current density and low current density extend<br>
along the surface in one direction and alternate across the surface in an opposite<br>
direction. With this arrangement, the metal deposits in a series of generally linear bands<br>
which is ideally suited for removal using a wiping action as will be described in more<br>
detail below.<br>
Preferably, the electrolysis process induces a non-uniform current density<br>
across the deposition surface by providing a cathode which in operation of the cell,<br>
creates a non-uniform electrical field having areas of strong electrical field and weak<br>
electrical field. With this arrangement, the areas of strong electrical field induce the<br>
areas of the high current density and the areas of weak electrical field induce the areas<br>
of low current density.<br>
The non-uniform electrical field can be created through numerous mechanisms,<br>
including the geometry of the surface, and by varying the electrical resistance between<br>
the cathode and anode along the deposition surface, or by a combination of both these<br>
mechanisms.<br>
The geometry of the surface influences the electrical field and is related to its<br>
surface curvature. Electrical fields are always perpendicular to the surface so that,<br>
sharp edges, or peaks at the deposition surface induce areas of high electrical field as<br>
compared to areas of flat surface, or valleys. The electrical resistance can be varied by<br>
using different materials along the deposition surface (e.g. providing sections with<br>
insulating material) or by changing the current path length between the cathode and the<br>
anode.<br>
In a preferred form, the non-uniform electrical field is induced at the deposition<br>
surface by the geometry of the surface and in particular by forming a series of alternate<br>
ridges and valleys across the surface. By virtue of this geometry, in operation of the<br>
cell, there is a higher electrical field along the ridges as compared to the valleys. In<br>
addition, the current path length at the ridges is shorter as compared to the valleys<br>
thereby creating a situation where there is less resistance at the ridges as compared to<br>
the valleys.<br>
The variation in current density across the deposition surface maybe such that<br>
there is a sharp demarcation between the areas of high current density and low current<br>
density, or alternatively there may be a more gradual transition between the areas of<br>
highest current density and lowest current density.<br>
The applicant has found that inducing a gradual transition between the areas of<br>
highest and lowest current density still provides good deposition patterns so as to<br>
promote substantially discontinuous growth across the deposition surface. In particular,<br>
the applicant has found that using a cathode which includes a deposition surface having<br>
ridges and valleys which do not include a sharp transition between the ridge and valleys<br>
so that there is a more gradual change between the highest current density and the<br>
lowest current density provides excellent performance. This arrangement induces<br>
secondary effects which assist in concentration of the metal deposition at the ridges as<br>
described in more detail below and also provides for easier removal of the metal as it<br>
allows easier access to the entire deposition surface in contrast to a sharp transition<br>
between the ridge and the valley may provide areas which are difficult to access!<br>
In a preferred form, where the cell is operative to remove copper from an<br>
aqueous solution current density in the areas of high current density is in the range<br>
of 500 to 2,500A/m2 and more preferable 1,000 AM/2. Preferably, the areas of low<br>
current density is in the range of 0 to 2,050A/m2 and more preferably 0 to 500A/m2.<br>
Where there is a gradual transition between the areas of highest current density<br>
and lowest current density, the demarcation between an area of "high current density"<br>
and "low current density" is somewhat arbitrary. In this arrangement, the transition<br>
region may be regarded as an area of moderate current which in turn is located between<br>
areas of adjacent "high current density" and areas of "low current density".<br>
Preferably, the process further includes the step of removing deposited metal<br>
from the deposition surface by passing an element over the surface.<br>
Preferably, in the arrangement where the areas of high current density and low<br>
current density extend along the surface in one direction and alternate across the surface<br>
in an opposite direction, the element is moved in the direction in which Hie areas of high<br>
and low current density extend.<br>
Preferably, the deposited jngtal is removed by the element whilst maintaining<br>
current flow in the aqueous solution, In this way, the process can be substantially<br>
continuous.<br>
In yet a further aspect, the present invention relates to an electrolysis cell for<br>
the electrorecovery of metal from an aqueous solution, the cell including a cathode<br>
which includes a deposition surface on which metal is deposited on electrolysing of the<br>
aqueous solution,-wherein in operation of the cell, the deposition surface has a non-<br>
uniform electrical field so as to have areas of strong electrical field interspaced by areas<br>
of low electrical field, the difference between the areas of high electrical field and low<br>
electrical field being sufficient to cause metal deposition to be concentrated on the areas<br>
of high electrical field so as to promote non-uniform deposition of metal on the surface.<br>
Preferably, the areas of high electrical field and low electrical field extend<br>
along the surface in one direction and alternate across the surface in an opposite<br>
direction. In a particularly preferred form, the deposition surface of the cathode<br>
includes an array of alternate ridges and valleys, with the ridges forming areas of high<br>
electrical field and the valleys forming the areas of low electricalfield.<br>
Profiling the deposition surface to have an array of alternate ridges and valleys<br>
has significant benefit in promoting substantially discontinuous metal deposition on the<br>
cathode. Typically such profiling promotes metal deposition as a dendrite growth on<br>
each of the ridges. Advantageously, the resulting dendrites are easy to remove (as<br>
described below). Not only does the profile provide, in the initial operation of the cell,<br>
the appropriate non-uniform current density to concentrate metal deposition as dendrites<br>
on the ridges, but it also assists in maintning discontinuous growth as the process<br>
continues. As will be appreciated, once metal deposits on the deposition surface, the<br>
deposited metal forms an extension of a deposition surface. An advantage of having an<br>
arrangement of ridges and valleys is that as the dendrites grow on the ridges, they tend<br>
to "shadow" the valleys which further inhibits metal deposition in the valleys. In<br>
addition, the aqueous solution tends to stagnate in the valleys which further inhibits<br>
deposition of metal in the valleys. In tests conducted by the applicant, using a profile of<br>
alternate ndges and valleys, more than 98.8% of metal was deposited on the ridges of<br>
the deposition surface.<br>
Whilst the beneficial effects of including the ridges and valleys may be<br>
achieved over a range of profiles, the applicants have found that a regular profile where<br>
the surfaces between the top of the ridge and the base of the valley is substantially linear<br>
and have an internal angle of approximately 60o between adacent surfaces provides<br>
good results. Furthermore preferably the pitch distance between adjacent ridges is in<br>
the order of 1 0-40mm, and more preferably 15-25mm, and the depth between the ridge<br>
and the valley is in the order of 8-32mm and more preferably in the range of 12-2Qmm.<br>
A deposition surface having these characteristics has been found to produce<br>
substantially discontinuous metal deposits. A further advantage is that this profile<br>
enables the surface to be substantially cleaned without creating "hot spots" of current<br>
density which would lead to impure metal deposits. If the current density at a site is too<br>
high, as the deposition progresses, it leads to concentration polarisation (which takes<br>
place around the growing deposit). When mis phenomenon occurs, a relative increase<br>
in impurity inclusions in the depositing metal (e.g. in copper) can occur. Thus it is<br>
important to control the current density at the site, The advantage of the profile<br>
mentioned above is that the areas of high current density where metal deposits still<br>
takes up a substantial part of the total area of the cathode(i.c. in the vicinity of 25-35%<br>
of the total area of the deposition surface). With this arrangement, the current is able to<br>
be maintained at a substantially constant rate regardless of whether the surface is clean<br>
of metal deposits or whether deposition has already occurred. As such, there is no need<br>
to ramp up the current on initiating the cell as the profile itself does not tend to induce<br>
strong "hot spots" of current density which is likely to cause problems in initial metal<br>
deposition.<br>
In a particularly preferred form, the cathode includes a sheet having at least<br>
one major surface which forms the deposition surface of the cathode, the sheet being<br>
preformed so as to incorporate the j}tematejridges_and valleys. The sheet may thus<br>
define a corrugated profile. Preferably, this preforming operation is achieved by folding<br>
of the sheet but it could be made by any other appropriate process such as a stamping,<br>
milling, swaging, casting process or combinations thereof.<br>
In a particularly preferred form, the sheet is formed from titanium or similar<br>
oxidation resistant material. Whilst other oxidation resistant materials may be used,<br>
such asjplatitmm, stainless steel, corrosion resistant metal alloys, titanium is most<br>
preferred because of its excellent oxidation resistance, its capcity to resist forming a<br>
metallurgical bond with metals such as copper, and because of its relative availability.<br>
A further advantage of using a corrugated profile is that it assists in<br>
maintaining dimensional stability for the sheet Such an arrangement can assist in<br>
overcoming the disadvantages of prior art arrangements where sheet cathodes had a<br>
tendency to flex and buckle. Further, when metal deposits on the sheet as a dendriticor<br>
crystalling growth the dimensional stability of the sheet enables wiping methods to be<br>
used to easily remove the deposit from the sheet The applicants have found that<br>
titamium sheets in the order of 1,6mm thickness provide sufficient dimensional stability<br>
for this process.<br>
Preferably, the sheet is adapted in use for attachment to a conductive header<br>
bar. This header bar supports the cathode in use andsupplies electrons to it<br>
In one form, the opposite major surfaces of the folded sheet axe used as<br>
deposition surfaces in operation of the cathode.<br>
m an alternative form, me cathode is made from a composite structure and<br>
further includes a conducting element which extends along the sheet The conducting<br>
element is in electrocommunication with the sheet so as in use to supply the deposition<br>
surface with electrons in the electrolysis process. One advantage of using a conducting<br>
element which extends along the sheet is that it minimises ohmic drop which occurs<br>
when the electrons are supplied solely from one edge of the sheet A second advantage<br>
of using a conducting element is mat is may be of sufficient size to provide rigidity to<br>
the sheet to further assist in maintaining dimensional stability of the cathode. With the<br>
composite arrangement it may thus be possible to use thinner sheet structures for the<br>
deposition surfaces).<br>
m a preferred form of this latter arrangement, the cathode includes a second<br>
sheet which is connected to the first sheet and which has a major surface which forms a<br>
second deposition surface of the cathode, the second sheet being preformed so as to<br>
incorporate the alternate ridges and valleys along that deposition surface. Preferably,<br>
the second sheet is connected to the first sheet of the cathode so as to form a plurality of<br>
pockets which extend in the direction of the alternate ridges and valleys. At least some<br>
of these pockets are operative to receive the conducting element of the cathode.<br>
In a preferred form, the wiping device is operative to pass over a deposition<br>
surface of the cathode so as to remove deposited material from the deposition surface.<br>
In a particularly preferred form, where the cathode includes the ridge and valley profile,<br>
the wiping device includes a plurality of projections which are operative to locate<br>
within respective valleys of the deposition surface. In a preferred form, these<br>
projections are made from a ceramic material but can be made of any other corrosive<br>
resistant material.<br>
In a preferred form, the projections are movable between a first and a second<br>
position and are operative to pass over the surface in either of these positions, m a first<br>
position, the element is in contact or in close proximity to the deposition surface so as to<br>
remove substantially all of the deposition material from mat surface. In the second<br>
position, preferably the element is spaced from the deposition surface and is operative<br>
to remove deposited material which extends a predetermined distance from the<br>
deposition surface.<br>
In yet a further aspect, the present invention relates to a cathode for use in a<br>
process or electrolysis cell as defined in any form above.<br>
In yet a further aspect, the present invention relates to a wiping system for use<br>
in an electrolysis cell in any form as defined above.<br>
In yet a further aspect, the present invention relates to a cathode for use in an<br>
electrolysis cell for the electrorecovery of metal from an aqueous solution, trie cathodes<br>
including a deposition surface having a plurality of ridges which are interspaced by a<br>
plurality of valleys, the profile of the cathode being operative on operation of the cell to<br>
cause metal deposition to be concentrated on the ridges so as to promote non-uniform<br>
deposition of metal on that surface.<br>

Modes for Carrying out the Invetion<br>
la Figure 1, a schematic representation of a combined process 100 including<br>
leach and electrorecovery 104 of metal is depicted. In a preferred form of this process,<br>
ground copper sulfide 106 is fed to a multistage counter current leaching process in<br>
which the metals are solubilised through oxidation by a lixiviant. La a preferred form,<br>
the IMviant includes a complex halide species which is formed in the anode of the<br>
subsequent electrolysis stage and is fed back into the leach stage as part of the<br>
electrolyte recycle 108.<br>
Dissolved metals in desirable oxidation states are removed at various stages<br>
from the leach process in the leachate. The leachate is passed through filtration 110 to<br>
remove unwanted solids such as sulfur and ferric oxide. The leachate is then passed to<br>
purification 112 to remove metals which may otherwise contaminate subsequent<br>
electrolysis (such as silver and mercury). The contaminant metals may be precipitated<br>
as the metal oxide or carbonate form.<br>
The purified leachate is then fed to the electrolysis stage 104 which may<br>
include a plurality of electrolysis cell groups in series and/or in parallel Jn each group, a<br>
different metal may be produced, with typically copper metal being electrorecovered in<br>
a first cell group and metals such as zinc, lead and nickel being recovered in subsequent<br>
or parallel cell groups. The electrolysis process is typically operated such that a highly<br>
oxidising lixiviant (such as a complex halide species) is produced at the anode. The<br>
spent electrolyte (anolyte) is then recycled to the leaching stage and includes the highly<br>
oxidising lixiviant which participates in further counter current leaching. Thus, the<br>
process can operate continuously.<br>
The present invention is concerned with optimising the electrorecovery of<br>
metals and relates to significant design improvements in the electrolysis process,<br>
including improved cathode design and geometry.<br>
Referring now to Figures 2-5 the electrolysis cell 10 for use in the process 100<br>
includes a series of cathode plates 11 which are disposed within the electrolysis cell<br>
tank SO and interspaced by anodes 12. Electrolyte fed to the cell enables current flow<br>
between the anodes and the cathodes. The outer surfaces 13,14 of the respective<br>
cathodes form a deposition surface for the cell on which the metal to be recovered<br>
deposits in operation of the cell 10. As will be described in more detail below, the<br>
cathode plates are formed from a generally corrugated profile having alternate ridges<br>
and valleys so as to influence the mode of deposition of the metal on the respective<br>
deposition surfaces 13 and 14.<br>
The cell 10 includes a wiper system 15 which includes a plurality of wiper sets<br>
16 operative to interfit between respective cathodes and anodes with the wipers 17 of<br>
respective wiper sets 16 being operative to move across the deposition surfaces 13 and<br>
14 of respective cathodes 11 so as to remove metal deposits from those surfaces. The<br>
wipers 17 are arranged to be wiped down the respective deposition surfaces 13 and 14<br>
at predetermined intervals to cause the dislodged metal to drop to the bottom of the cell<br>
10 wherein it is transferred to a conveyor 18 for removal from the cell.<br>
To achieve this wiping action, the wiping system 15 includes two principle<br>
movements; the first being a vertical movement to allow the wiper sets 16 to move<br>
between the top and the bottom of the respective cathodes 11, the second being to allow<br>
the wipers 17 in each set 16 to move from an open position (as best illustrated in Figueg"<br>
7) to a closed position (as best illustrated in Figure 8).<br>
The wiper sets 16 are mounted on a frame 32 which is secured at its upper end<br>
to four supporting struts 19, 20, 21 and 22. Each of the struts include a helical track 23<br>
which cooperates with a worm gear 24 connected to the frame 32. In this way, the<br>
frame 32 moves relative to the struts. An electric motor 25 mounted on a cross beam 26<br>
is operative to drive the worm gears 24 so as to achieve the vertical movement of the<br>
wiper sets relative to the deposition surfaces 13 and 14. Under this action, the wipers<br>
are able to move between a lower position as disclosed in Figure 2 to an upper position<br>
as disclosed in Figure 4.<br>
The frame 32 supports a linkage assembly 27 which in turn is connected to the<br>
wiper sets 16. The linkage assembly 27 includes a pair of link plates 28 at each end of<br>
the wiper sets 16 which are connected to respective link arms 29. A crank 30 is<br>
pivotally connected to respective pairs of the link plates 28 through pivot points 31.<br>
Crank arms 40 extend from the crank 30 to the wiper sets 16 so as to support each end<br>
of the wiper sets. The link arms 29 are capable of vertical movement through a second<br>
actuator 41. In the illustrated form, the second actuator is in the form of worm gears<br>
which cooperate with helical tracks formed on the respective link arms. The worm<br>
gears rotate which impacts the rotation to the the link arms 29 to cause vertical<br>
displacement of those arms relative to the frame 32 which in turn drives the crank 30 so<br>
as to move the wipers between their open and closed positions. The second activator<br>
can be damped to prevent over-tightening and jamming of the wipers against the<br>
cathode. Damping can be provided by a spring-loaded coupling or by using a pneumatic<br>
cylinder in place of the worm gear.<br>
As best illustrated in Figure 6 each line of cathodes in the cell 10 is formed<br>
from a plurality of cathode plates 11 which are connected to a header bar 34 so that the<br>
individual plates are suspended in the tank SO. The header bar 34 is conductive and<br>
connected to a power source so as to supply electrons to the cathode.<br>
Typically the electrolyte is highly corrosive, resulting from typically a 5 molar<br>
or greater concentration of alkali or alkaline-earth metal halides. To enable the<br>
components to be able to operate in this environment, the wiper system IS is made from<br>
a corrosion resistant material which is preferably titanium. Other suitable materials<br>
 include platinum stanless steel corresion resists metal allows (such as hastalloy C.<br>
22), or even some plastics. Also, titanium is most preferred for the cathode because of<br>
its excellent corrosion resistance and its capacity to resist forming a metallurgical bond<br>
with metal such as copper, and because of its relative availability (hence cost benefit).<br>
Its resistance to forming a metallurgic bond improves the ability of the plates to be<br>
 stripped using the wiper system described above.<br>
Figures 9 and 10 illustrate the construction of the individual cathode plates 11.<br>
In the illustrated form, the cathode plate 11 is formed from a titanium sheet having a<br>
thickness which is preferably about 1.6mm. Sheets of this thickness have been found<br>
by the applicant to give adequate rigidity to the cathode plate to prevent buckling in use.<br>
 The titanium sheet is folded to form a generally corrugated profile so as to provide on<br>
each deposition surface 13,14 alternate valleys and ridges 35,36 respectively. These<br>
corrugations run along the entire length of the cathode between its upper and lower<br>
edges 37,38.<br>
In the illustrated form, the distance between adjacent ridges 36 is 20mm,<br>
 whereas the depth between the top of the ridges 36 and the bottom of the valleys 35 is<br>
approximately 16mm. The wall surfaces 43 formed on the corrugated sheet are<br>
generally linear and have an internal angle at the top at the ridges and bottom of the<br>
valleys of approximately 60°.<br>
A primary purpose for incorporating the corrugations in the cathode is to<br>
 influence the current density on the deposition surfaces 13,14 under operation of the<br>
cell. In particular, the corrugations on the deposition surface cause a non-uniform<br>
electrical field across that surface in operation of the cell.<br>
The corrugated deposition surface on the cathode creates bands of high current<br>
density along the ridges of the cathode due to its corresponding high electrical field at<br>
 those areas and relatively low current densities in the valleys. This causes metal<br>
deposition to be concentrated in the areas of high current density and promotes non-<br>
uniform deposition across the surface so that the vast majority of the deposition<br>
includes in the ridge regions 35 of the deposition surface. Creating substantially<br>
discontinuous deposition improves the ability to be able to remove recovered metal<br>
from the cathode using the wiping system 15.<br>
The profile of the deposition surface with the valleys and ridges causes the<br>
non-uniform electric field by two mechanisms. Firstly, in view of the geometry of the<br>
profile, the electrical field will be stronger at the ridges than the valleys because of its<br>
surface curvature. In general, the electric field lines are always perpendicular to the<br>
surface. Therefore, at each ridge there will be a concentration of a field along those<br>
points. Secondly, the current flow path at the ridges is less than the current flow path at<br>
the valleys. As a result, there is less resistance at the ridges than there is at the valleys.<br>
In addition, the use of the corrugated profile of the cathode allows better<br>
control at the main sites of deposition (i.e. along the ridges). If the current density at a<br>
site is too high, as deposition progresses, it leads to concentration polarisation (which „<br>
takes place around the growing deposit). When this phenomenon occurs, a relative<br>
increase in impurity inclusion in the depositing metal (e.g. in copper) can occur. With<br>
the corrugated profile, the main sites of deposition account for approximately 25-35%<br>
of the total surface area of the cathode. As a function of the mass transfer, ideally the<br>
current at the deposition surface should be in the vicinity of l,000A/m2 or less. As the<br>
dendrites grow on the surface, the actual area of deposition surface increases as metal is<br>
deposited on the previously deposited metal. If the initial deposition sites on the<br>
cathode are too small, then there is a tendency that once the dendrite is removed from<br>
the cathode the current density at that site becomes too high. Through trials conducted<br>
by the applicant, using the corrugated profile, it is found that the current density at the<br>
deposition sites both on initial operation of the cell and after dendritic growth has<br>
occurred, it is able to be maintained in the vicinity of l,000A/m2 so as to provide high<br>
quality metal deposition. As such, there is no need to vary the current during the<br>
process.<br>
A further advantage of using the corrugated profile on the cathode is that it<br>
improves the rigidity of the cathode plate, as the corrugated profile is inherently stiffer<br>
than a flat plate along the direction of the ridges and valleys. In addition, the corrugated<br>
profile is ideally suited to be cleaned using the wiping blade system as is described in<br>
more detail below.<br>
With reference to Figures 11 to 15, the wipers 17 include fingers 39 which are<br>
mounted between a pair of rails 42. In the illustrated form, each of the individual<br>
fingers are formed from a ceramic material with the rails being made of titanium. Each<br>
of the fingers is spaced along the rail 42 so that the wipers 17 conform generally to the<br>
shape of the corrugated cathode plate 11, with the individual fingers locating within the<br>
valleys 35 of the deposition surface and over the associated ridges 36.<br>
As best illustrated in Figure 12, the wiping system 15 is designed so that when<br>
the wiper sets 16 are in their closed position, the wipers 17 are angled to the cathode<br>
plate 11 so that the individual fingers 39 are in a trailing position relative to the line of<br>
movement of the wiper 17 down the cathode plate 11. This arrangement is preferred as.<br>
it inhibits jamming of the fingers in the valleys as may occur if the fingers 39 v&amp;ere in a<br>
leading position relative to the direction of movement of the wipers down the cathode<br>
plate.<br>
As described above, in view of the configuration of the cathode plates 11, the<br>
metal recovered from the electrolysis cell is concentrated on the ridges of the respective<br>
deposition surfaces of the cell. As such, when the wiper 17 is moved across the<br>
deposition surface the dislodged material from the ridges tends to move into the<br>
adjacent valleys of the deposition surface. This causes an accumulation of the metal<br>
within the valleys which tends to envelop the fingers 39 thereby protecting the ceramic<br>
fingers 39 from wear. In addition, there is a build up in frictional force as the mass of<br>
material is moved down the deposition surface thereby aiding removal of material as the<br>
material is dragged from the surface under this frictional force. It is not necessary that<br>
the fingers 39 are in direct contact with the deposition surface to ensure adequate<br>
cleaning of that surface.<br>
Another advantage of the design of the wiping system 15 is that it enables<br>
different stages of cleaning of the cathodes. In particular, as described above, the<br>
wipers 17 can be operated to remove the bulk of the deposited material on the<br>
deposition surfaces by dragging across those surfaces when in their closed position.<br>
The wipers can also be moved across the deposition when in their open position. This<br>
is used not to fully clean the deposition surface but rather to ensure that there is no<br>
extended dendritic growth on part of the deposition surface which could otherwise grow<br>
to an extent that it contacts the anode and thereby causes short circuiting of the<br>
electrolysis cell. Also, this allows for more consistent growth across the ridges of the<br>
cathode, which aids in control of the current density along the deposition surface.<br>
Figures 14 and 15 illustrate some variations in the design of the wipers 17. As<br>
in the arrangement of Figure 13, each of the wipers 17 include ceramic fingers 39.<br>
However, rather than using the rail arrangement 42 as disclosed in Figure 13, the fingers<br>
39 are interconnected by an internal connecting bar 44. In the embodiment of Figure 14<br>
the bar 44 is formed as a square section, whereas in Figure 15 the connecting bar is<br>
made up of two cylindrical bars 45.<br>
Referring now to Figures 16 and 17, an alternative cathode construction is<br>
depicted. In this embodiment the cathode is formed as a composite structure wherein<br>
the outer deposition surfaces 13,14 are defined by separate sheets which are fastened<br>
together along their respective lateral edges 60,61, and which may optionally be<br>
fastened together at intermittent regions 62.<br>
In this embodiment, a plurality of conducting bars 63 form part of the<br>
construction and extend downwardly from the header bar 34, the conducting bars<br>
typically also being formed from titanium (or a titanium coated copper bar to further<br>
improve conductively). Typically the conducting bars extend for the full length the<br>
plates 13,14 through each of the passages defined between a plate and are fastened<br>
thereto. Such an arrangement provides enhanced distribution of electrons through the<br>
assembly, thereby minimising ohmic drop which can occur when the elections are<br>
supplied solely to one edge of the sheet In addition, it has been found that the<br>
composite arrangement, including the arrangement of the conducting bars in the<br>
passages, enhances the dimensional stability of the sheet so that thin plate structures<br>
(e.g. as small as lmm) or alternatively wide plate structures can be employed for the<br>
cathode. Otherwise, the principles of operation of the cathode of Figures 16 and 17 are<br>
described above.<br>
Whilst the invention has been described with reference to a number of<br>

many other forms.<br>
