				<td>The present invention relates to an improved process for racemization of [1S, 2S-(+)-2- amino-1-(4- nitro phenyl)-1,3-propanediol]<br>
Chloramphenicol	[(1 R,2R)-2-Dichloroacetamino-1-(4-nitrophenyl)-1,3-<br>
propanediol ] of formula 1 shown in the drawing accompanying the specification processes a fairly wide spectrum of anti- microbial activity against gram-negative bacteria while it's threo 1S.2S diastereomer is devoid of anti bacterial activity. It's precursor i.e. I base (1R, 2R)-1-(4-nitrophenyl)-2-amino-1,3-propanediol of formula 3 is obtained in large scale from racemic dl-base of formula 2 by entertainment resolution [J.Jacques, A. Collet, S.H. Willem" Enantiomers, racemetes and resolution "John wiley and sons 1987, p 223] . The d-base of formula 4 obtained in same chemical and optical purity, as I- base of formula 3_has no antibacterial activity and hence discarded having no industrial applications. The present invention relates to an improved process of racemization of d-base, an undesired product to d l-base i.e. dl-thero-2-amino-1-(4-nitrophenyl) 1,3-propanediol of the formula 2, the starting material for l-base of the formula 3. The invention relates to drug and pharmaceutical industry.<br>
Prior Art: In principal two strategies exist for conversion of 1S,2S (+)2- amino-1-<br>
(4- nitrophenyl )-1,3-propanediol 4 in to l-base 3_[ (1R, 2R ) (-)2- amino-1-(4-<br>
nitrophenyl )-1,3- propanediol]. The first involves a recemization of d-base to dl-<br>
base, the precursor of l-base and second deals with direct conversion of d- base 4<br>
to l-base 3. The processes have been studied which allow the racemization of 2S,<br>
3S- 2- amino-1-(4-nitrophenyl )-1,3-propanediol of formula 4 to	2-amino-(4-<br>
nitrophenyl)-1,3-propanediol  (racemic, threo base) of formula 2  ,a  1:1   mixture<br>
(1R,2R ) (-) isomer 3 and (1S.2S ) (+)isomer of formula 4 is described in Tetrahedron letters 29, 5561 (1988) and references cited therein ; &amp; V. Hozak ; F. Moezie ; R. F. X. Klein ; C. Giordeno ; Synthesis , 1984, 839 ; G. Jommi ; D. Dellabella ;D. Chiarino; M. Fantucci; Italian pat. Applied 20968 (1985; Italian pat. 1186716, (1987) followed by entertainment resolution [L.M. Long, U.S. pat. 2, 767, 313(1956)]. In above process, the 2-amino and 3- hydroxy functionally of amino propanediol of formula 4_is protected and the free benzylic alcohol function is oxidized to the keto compound. The racemized keto compound is reduced to obtain a mixture of threo and erthro propanediol in a ratio of 90:10, thus erythro isomer remains a contaminant in the production of racemic threo base of formula 2 .In the second strategy involving the direct conversion of one enantiomer i.e. d- base to I-base with out recemization has been developed by Zambon group of Italy . 4 or d-base of thiamphenicol is converted directly to I - base i. e. (1R.2R ) (-)-2- amino-1-aryl- 3-propanediol by a process based upon dynamic kinetic resolution [C.Giodano , S. Cavicchioli , S. Levi , M. Villa; J. Organic chemistry , 1991, 56; 6114-6118 ; M.Villa, C.Giordano.S.Cavicchioli, and S.Levi ;U.S.patent 5,401,852 (1995) ] . In large-scale operation such process is usually cost prohibititive. . For both the strategies, presence of three functionalities i.e. one amino and two hydroxyl groups complicates the problems of chemo- selectivity. The latter strategy though elegant requires large number of steps i.e. at least 9 steps and the industrially less feasible than the former strategy. As racemic threo base of formula 2 can be easily separated to I- base of formula 3 and d- base of formula 4 by<br>
entrainment resolution, racemization of 4 to obtain 2 is economical for utilization of undesired isomer and minimization of waste disposal.<br>
In the drawing accompanying the specification formula 1 represents Chloramphenicol. Racemic threo base (2-amino-(4-nitrophenyl)-1,3- propanediol), I base [1R.2R-1- (4-nitrophenyl)-2- amino- 1,3 - propanediol], d-base [1S, 2S (+)2- amino-1-(4-nitrophenyl ) 1,3- propanediol] are represented by formulae 2, 3.and ,4 respectively. Formulae 5 a represents 4S, 5S-(+)- 2-methyl-4- hydroxymethyl-5- (4- nitrophenyl)-1,3 oxazoline and 5b represents 4S, 5S-(+)- 2-phenyl-4- hydroxymethyl-5- (4- nitrophenyl)-1,3 oxazoline. 4S,5S/R-2-Methyl-4- formyl-5- (4- nitrophenyl)-1,3 oxazoline and 4S.5S/R-2- phenyl-4-formyl-5- (4- nitrophenyl)-1,3 oxazoline are represented by formulae 6a and 6b respectively. 4S,5R/S-2-Methyl-4- hydroxymethyl-5- (4- nitrophenyl)-1,3 oxazoline and 4S,5S/R-2- phenyl-4- hydroxymethyl -5-(4- nitrophenyl)-1,3 oxazoline are represented by formulae   7a and 7b respectively<br>

Conversion of d-base 4 to dl- base 2 requires recemization at both C1 and C2 stereoogenic centers with threo disposition of Ci- OH between C2-NH2 functionalities. The aim of oxidizing the primary hydroxyl group of d- base 4 is  o facilitate the racemization at C2 stereogenic center of 4.Derivatization cehmical were<br>
to oxazoline 5 protects C1- OH and C2-NH2 and allows regio-selective oxidation of C3- OH. Facile abstraction of C4- H of oxazoline aldehyde paves away the racemization at C4 of aldehyde 6 leading to formation 1: 1 mixture threo (4R, 5S) and erythro (4S, 5S) stereomers of 6. We recall that according to nomenclature convention, the replacement of CH2OH group by CHO group modifies the denomination of configuration of the carbon atom position C4 of oxazoline 6 but this does not mean that absolute configuration is changed. Subsequent reduction of aldehyde 6 furnishes a 1:1 mixture of oxazoline alcohol 7 having configuration 4R, 5S (erythro ) and 4S,5S (threo). Heating this mixture in acidic medium leads to epimerisation of only erythro stereomer (4R, 5S) to thermodynamically more stable<br>
threo stereomer (4R, 5R) whereas the threo stereomer (4S,5S) does not epimerize. The oxazoline ring undergo hydrolysis under reaction condition to obtain corresponding amido alcohol which without isolation and purification directly hydrolyzed to racemic dl- base (1:1 mixture of l-base 3 and d- base 4) by treatment with alkali. The product is isolated by filtration and recrystallization. The examples given here should not be construed to limit the scope of the present invention. Example 1<br>

Yield = 3.0 g (74 %) M.P. = 162-4 °C [α =0° (C = 2.4 % in 1.0 (N) HC1). Example 9<br>
To a solution of 4-(R/S), 5 S-2- phenyl-4- hydroxymethyl-5-(4- nitrophenyl)- 1,3- oxazine 7b (11.5 g , 0.04 mol) in acetic acid (80 ml), acetic anhydride (4ml) is added. The mixture is heated to reflux with stirring for 1 hr. The solution is evaporated under suction. To the resulting residual crude product, aqueous sodium hydroxide (4 g in 50 ml water) is added. The resulting suspension is heated to reflux for 8 hrs. The mixture is cooled and diluted with 20 ml of water and stored at 10- 15° for 4 hrs. The precipitated product is filtered under suction. The residue is washed with ice cold water and finally recrystallized from water to yield 8.3 g of threo- (+)- 2- amino-1- (4- nitrophenyl)- 1,3- propanediol. 2 Yield =6.5 g (74 % )        M.P. =162-4 °C    [α]    = 0° (C = 2.4 % in 1.0 (N) HCI<br>
Advantage :<br>
Chlorophenicol, a broad spectrum antibiotics is produced from 1R, 2R- 2- amino-1-<br>
aryl- 1 ,3- propandiol 3 which obtained by entrainment resolution of threo racemic<br>
1- aryl-2- amino- propane-1,2- diol 2 . The parallel processing of undesired 1S, 2R-<br>
1- aryl-2- amino propane-1, 2-diol 4 or d- base as the source of I- base offers an<br>
opportunity to develop a practical route with maximizing the utilization of raw<br>
material and minimizing waste disposal. Recemization of d- base 4 to obtain threo<br>
recemic base 2 requires less number of steps then to the direct conversion to I-<br>
base 3 In the known of racemization of d- base 4. A mixture of racemic threo 2and<br>
it's enthreo isomers are obtained in a ratio of 9:1 due to involvement of oxidation of<br>
benzylic alcohol function of 2,3-protected derivative of 4 and diastereoselective<br>
reduction of the resulting ketone in the subsequent step . In the present invention<br>
3- hydroxyl group of 5 is oxidized to aldehyde 6 and reduction of the aldehyde<br>
furnished only threo alcohol 6 hence formation of erythro isomer does not arise. .<br>
Thus 1S, 2R isomer (d-base) is racemised by a process with high yield, low cost<br>
and less number of steps with out formation of erythro isomer in the present<br>
invention. Following similar process, the d- base of fluorfenicol, thiamphenicol can<br>
be	racemized	to	threo	dl-	base.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
