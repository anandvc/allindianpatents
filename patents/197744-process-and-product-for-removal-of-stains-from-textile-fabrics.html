Technical field<br>
The present invention is concerned with a process and product suitable for removing stains from textile fabrics. The process is especially suitable for use when washing fabrics by hand.<br>
Background<br>
In the handwash, for example, as practised on the Indian subcontinent, successful removal of stains from textile fabrics is a persistent problem and acceptable results are difficult to obtain using conventional laundry detergent products and traditional handwashing methods.  Removal of strongly coloured stains, for example, tea, coffee, red mud and rust, is especially problematic.<br>
Prior art<br>
JP 58 008 180A (Kao) discloses a process for removing coloured disinfectant stains from hospital clothing, in which the clothing is first machine-washed in an acid solution at pH 2.5-4.0, for example at 60°C, then machine-washed with a solution containing sodium hypochlorite bleach, for example at 40°C.  The preferred acid for the first step is phosphoric acid, but citric acid may also be<br><br>
used. The acid solution used for the first step may contain a neutral detergent.<br>
GB 2 09525j4A__XKreussler) discloses a composition for reducing discolouration of textiles during washing or dry cleaning, the composition comprising tertiary amine salts of citric acid or tricarballylic acid.<br>

I<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The first aspect of the invention is a wet treatment process.   In this process the fabrics are soaked successively in two different aqueous liquors and then rinsed.  Optionally the fabrics may be rinsed between the two soaking steps.<br>
The process of the invention is especially useful, as a supplement to the normal laundry process, for removal of particularly stubborn stains.<br>
The process of the invention is suitable for carrying out by hand, using simple utensils such as buckets or bowls as are usually used in laundering fabrics by hand.  However, the process may also be carried out by machine.<br>
The second aspect of the invention is a product comprising two separately packaged particulate products which may be used to prepare the two aqueous liquors used in the process of the invention.<br>
The first aqueous liquor<br>
The first aqueous liquor has a relatively low pH, in the range of from 2 to 5, and advantageously in the range of from 3.5 to 4.5, most preferably about 4.0.  However, lower pH values, for example, 2 to 3.5, are also within the scope of the invention.<br>
The first aqueous liquor contains as an essential ingredient a water-soluble solid acid.<br><br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the water-soluble acid is an organic carboxylic acid, for example, citric acid, oxalic acid, tartaric acid, malonic acid, succinic acid, or ascorbic acid.   Acids containing two or more carboxyl groups are especially preferred.<br>
Examples of some suitable solid acids include the following:<br><br>
Acid	Formula<br>
DL-Lactic acid	H3C-CHO-COOH<br>
Glycolic acid	H2-C-OH-COOH<br>
Fumaric acid	HOOC-CH=HC-COOH<br>
Malonic acid	HOOC-CH2-COOH<br>
Malic acid	HOOC - CH2 - CHOH- COOH<br>
Salicylic acid	OH- (C6H4) -COOH<br>
Oxalic acid 2aq	HOOC-COOH<br>
Succinic acid	HOOC-CH2-CH2-COOH<br>
Benzoic acid	(C6H4) -COOH<br>
Tartaric acid	HOOC-HCOH-HCOH-COOH<br>
Adipic acid	HOOC - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - CH2 - COOH<br>
Glutaric acid	HOOC-CHOH-CHOH-CHOH-COOH<br>
Glycine	H2-N-CH2-COOH<br>
Sokalan DCS	Mixed adipic glutaric succinic acids<br>
Citric acid laq	HO-(-C-COOH)3<br>
Ascorbic acid	HO-CH2-CHOH-CH-CH=CH-C=0..0(3-6)<br>
Boric acid	HBO3<br>
Asparagine laq	HOOC - CH2 - NH2 - CH2 - COOH<br>
Sodium dihydrogen phosphate 2aq	NaH2P04<br>
Arginine	H2N-C(=NH- (CH2)3-CH(NH2)-COOH<br>
Salicyl salicylic acid	OH- (C6H4) -COO- (C6H4) -COOH<br>
Cysteine	HS - CH2 - CH (NH3) - COOH<br>
According to a preferred embodiment of the invention, the acid is used in admixture with a corresponding water-soluble<br><br>
salt, preferably a sodium salt.  The pH may then be controlled by choice of the ratio of free acid to salt.<br>
Thus a preferred acid (i)(a) in accordance with the invention is a solid organic carboxylic acid, preferably containing two or more carboxyl groups, optionally in admixtures with a water-soluble salt thereof.<br>
The preferred acid for use in the present invention is citric acid, optionally and more preferably used in admixture with sodium citrate.<br>
The concentration of the acid, plus salt if present, in the first aqueous liquor is preferably at least 1 .g/litre, and more preferably at least 3 g/litre.<br>
Desirably the first aqueous liquor also contains an effective amount of an oxidising agent capable of masking and/or neutralising sulphurous odours.  Such odours may be generated when the blueing agent widely used in the Indian subcontinent is converted to a colourless form.   Suitable materials are especially oxidative bleaches, preferably selected from alkali metal and alkaline earth metal iodates, peroxomonosulphates, benzenecarboperoxoates and monoperoxyphthalates, and hydrogen peroxide.  Especially preferred are alkali metal iodates, more especially potassium iodate.<br>
The amount required to neutralise sulphurous odours may be determined by means of a lead acetate titration test, which is carried out as follows.   A monitor is prepared by impregnating a 1 cm x 10 cm strip of Whatman IPS phase-separating filter paper (silicone treated) with lead acetate solution (1 g of lead acetate trihydrate in 100 ml<br><br>
demineralised water).  A fabric monitor is placed in 100 ml sample of the treatment liquor (first aqueous liquor) in a 400 ml beaker, the lead acetate strip is moistened with demineralised water and placed above the treatment liquor, and the beaker is closed with a transparent lid.  If hydrogen sulphide is formed during the treatment, the lead acetate strip becomes black/brown due to the formation of lead sulphide, and this indicates that the liquor contains an insufficient amount of the oxidising agent.<br>
According to an especially preferred embodiment of the invention, the first aqueous liquor may contain a bleach stable and effective at a pH of from 2 to 5.  By "stable and effective" is meant that the bleach must be stable in a product on storage at a pH of from 2 to 5, soluble when the product is dissolved in water, and function effectively as a bleach at the pH of the product.<br>
Some but not all of the materials disclosed above as odour-masking or odour-neutralising agents are also stable and effective bleaches at a pH of from 2 to 5.  However, if the chosen oxidising agent is, for example, potassium iodate, it may be preferred for an additional bleach stable at low pH also to be present.   Preferred bleaches are alkali metal dichlorocyanurates.<br>
Materials that may function both as odour-masking or neutralising agents and as stable and effective bleaching agents at a pH below 5.0 include magnesium 0  monoperoxyphthalate and potassium benzenecarboperoxoate.<br>
The first aqueous liquor may also advantageously contain one or more surfactants.  Anionic and/or nonionic surfactants are preferred, especially anionic surfactants used alone and<br><br>
combinations of anionic and nonionic surfactants in which the anionic surfactant predominates.  A preferred surfactant system comprises an anionic surfactant selected from linear alkylbenzene sulphonate and alpha-olefin sulphonate, optionally together with at least one ethoxylated C8-C2o alcohol nonionic surfactant having an average degree of ethoxylation of from 2 to 10.<br>
Other ingredients, for example perfumes, may be present, generally in minor amounts.<br>
In the first step of the process of the invention, the fabrics are allowed to soak in the first aqueous liquor for at least 1 minute, preferably from 1 to 60 minutes, more preferably from 10 to 45 minutes, and most preferably from 15 to 30 minutes.<br>
With or without an intermediate rinse, the fabrics are then allowed to soak in the second aqueous liquor.<br>
The second aqueous liquor<br>
The second aqueous liquor contains as an essential ingredient a bleach.  Other ingredients including surfactants and alkaline buffering agents may if desired be present, but that is not essential.<br>
Suitable bleaches include chlorine bleaches such as alkali metal hypochlorite, organic chloramides (eg alkali metal dichlorocyanurate (DCCA) or trichlorocyanurate); peracids, for example, N,N'-phthaloylaminoperoxycaproic acid (PAP), diperdodecanoic acid (DPDA); inorganic persalts, for example, alkali metal perborate or percarbonate, together<br><br>
with a bleach activator (peracid precursor) such as<br>
alkylsulphophenyl carbonate (ASPC),<br>
cholylsulphophenylcarbonate (CSPC), or SNOBS and similar<br>
materials.  If desired, two or more bleaches may be used in<br>
combination.<br>
Preferred bleaches are alkali metal hypochlorite, alkali metal dichlorocyanurate (DCCA), alkali metal perborate, and N,N'-phthaloylaminoperoxycaproic acid (PAP), and combinations thereof.  Especially preferred bleaches are sodium DCCA, PAP, and combinations thereof.<br>
Advantageously the second aqueous liquor may also contain a bleach stabiliser (heavy metal sequestrant), for example, an aminopolycarboxylate or aminopolyphosphonate.  Preferred materials include EDTA, NTA, EDDS, and EDTMP and DETPMP (Dequests (Trade Mark)).<br>
A sequestrant is desirable or preferred when the bleach system includes PAP, but may be omitted if the bleach is NaDCCA.<br>
The concentration of bleach in the second aqueous liquor is preferably at least 0.05 g/litre, more preferably at least 0.1 g/litre and most preferably at least 0.2 g/litre.<br>
Surfactants may also be present.  Especially preferred are anionic and/or nonionic surfactants.  As in the first aqueous liquor, anionic surfactants alone and anionic/nonionic combinations in which the anionic surfactant predominates are preferred.<br>
The second aqueous liquor may also contain an alkaline buffering agent, which may suitably be selected from sodium<br><br>
carbonate, sodium bicarbonate, sodium sesquicarbonate, sodium silicate and combinations of these.<br>
It may also contain one or more builder and/or filler salts, suitably selected from sodium tripolyphosphate, other sodium phosphates, sodium sulphate, and combinations of these.<br>
The second aqueous liquor may also comprise one or more detergent enzymes, preferably selected from proteases, cellulases and combinations thereof.<br>
Thus the second aqueous liquor may be purely a bleach solution;  or may to a greater or lesser extent contain other detergent or cleaning ingredients.   At one extreme the second aqueous liquor may be generated purely by dissolving bleach in water;   at the other extreme, the seocnd aqueous liquor may be generated by dissolving or dispersing a fully formulated bleaching detergent composition, or a fully formulated non-bleaching detergent composition plus separate bleach, in water.<br>
In the second step of the process of the invention, the fabrics are allowed to soak in the second aqueous liquor for a period of at least 1 minute, preferably from 1 to 60 minutes, more preferably from 10 to 30 minutes.<br>
In a final step, the fabrics are rinsed in water.<br>
The product of the invention<br>
In the product of the invention, a first particulate composition is used to prepare the first aqueous liquor.<br><br>

EXAMPLE 5:  stain removal<br>
The stain removal performance of the product of Example 1 was compared with that of a commercially available laundry detergent powder sold on the Indian market.<br>
All wash liquors were prepared, and rinses carried out, using 24° (French) hard water.<br>
Stained cotton monitors were each soaked for 3 0 minutes in a 5.0 g/1 solution of composition 1(a), then soaked for 30 minutes in a 5.0 g/l solution of composition 1(b), then rinsed twice in large volumes of water and allowed to dry.<br>
In a control experiment, monitors carrying the same stains were each soaked for 30 minutes in a 5.0 g/1 solution of a commercially available Indian laundry detergent powder, rinsed twice in large volumes of water, and allowed to dry. The commercial product contained LAS, nonionic surfactant, sodium tripolyphosphate, sodium carbonate, sodium carboxymethylcellulose, photobleach, protease, cellulase, lipase and conventional minor ingredients.<br>
Reflectance increases (AR) at 460 nm and at 600 nm were measured before and after treatment.  The results are shown in the following Table.<br><br>
