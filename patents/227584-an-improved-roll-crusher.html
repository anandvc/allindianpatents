				<td>Field of invention<br>
The present invention relates to an improved roll crusher. The present invention<br>
particularly relates to a roll crusher with improved crushing index and reduced<br>
micro fines in the crushed output. The present invention further relates to a<br>
method of improved crushing. Roll crushers of the present invention are useful in<br>
various applications especially where the size distribution of the output plays an<br>
important role in the end use of the crushed particles for example in crushing of<br>
coke.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
Crushing index is described as the percentage of weight of particles which pass<br>
through 3mm screen after crushing in roll crusher. Commonly used roll crushers<br>
are double roll crushers. One of the several applications of roll crushers is the<br>
crushing of nut coke/coke breeze which is used as fuel in the sinter plant. Over<br>
size (+3mm) particles in the crushed sinter mix cause overheating of the charge<br>
mix whereas micro fines (-0.5mm or below) are not able to generate sufficient<br>
heat for sintering. Hence it is essential that -3mm fraction is maximum and at the<br>
same time micro fines (-0.5mm) are minimum to the extent possible. Similarly in<br>
other applications it is desired that the particles in the crushed output are within a<br>
predetermined size range.<br>
Conventionally roll crushers are used for crushing of fuel in raw material handling<br>
plant or sinter plant. In such roll crushers either two rolls or four rolls are used for<br>
crushing the coke. The output of the first two rolls is used as input of the other two<br>
rolls. Alternatively there are two crushers, first in the circuit is known as primary<br>
crusher and the other crusher which receives the output of primary crusher as<br>
input is known as secondary roll crusher. Both of the rolls are driven through same<br>
speed motors with same reduction ratio, so that their roll speed is same.<br>
Several attempts have been made in the past to improve the crushing index.<br>
Certain standard practices include maintaining of optimum gap between two rolls,<br>
maintaining size of the input material which is conductive for desired output size<br>
and regular replacement of rolls after their wear for monitoring the roll gap.<br><br><br>
The above practices although improve crushing index, but also lead to increase of<br>
micro fines.<br>
Various methods are employed to reduce fines (0.5mm) such as mechanical<br>
screening, air classifier etc. However, these methods cannot be introduced in<br>
industry due to the need of fundamental changes and reconstruction of crushing<br>
departments. Such changes require substantial investments and in some cases<br>
are difficult to implement due to space constraints.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
Therefore the primary objective of the present invention is to provide an improved<br>
roll crusher which exhibits better crushing index.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide an improved roll crusher<br>
which results in decreased amount of micro fines in the output.<br>
A further object of the present invention is to provide an improved roll crusher<br>
which is achieved by simple and easy modification of known roll crushers.<br>
Yet further object of the present invention is to provide a process of improved<br>
crushing with better crushing index and lower amounts of micro fines.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, one aspect of the present invention provides an improved roll crusher<br>
with improved crushing index and reduced micro fines of crushed output, the roll<br>
crusher comprising two rolls which create a nip through which the materials pass<br>
and are subjected to crushing, characterized in that the two rolls of said roll<br>
crusher are adapted to rotate at a differential speed.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention there is provided a method of<br>
crushing comprising:<br>
feeding the material required to be crushed into a roll crusher wherein the rolls of<br>
the said roll crusher are adapted to rotate at a differential speed; and<br><br><br>
receiving crushed material from said roll crusher.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Improved crushing index is achieved along with reduction of micro fines by the roll<br>
crusher of the present invention. Whenever crushing is carried out in conventional<br>
roll crushers of, say for example, of coke either in four roll crusher or two roll<br>
crusher with target of higher crushing index, over pulverization of coke takes<br>
place. It is due to the fact that the smooth rolls of the crusher work as a pair on the<br>
principle of crushing and partial abrasion. A piece of coke pulled into gap between<br>
the rolls, which rotate at the same speed is acted upon by pressure forces of<br>
equal magnitude and opposite sign. Crushing of brittle material is accompanied by<br>
cracking resulting in the formation of individual smaller pieces. These pieces are<br>
abraded by each other as they are without rotation into the convergent roll gap.<br>
This also helps to produce a large number of small dust sized fractions of coke in<br>
the crushed product.<br>
According to the present invention the rolls are rotated at a differential speed. As a<br>
result, when the top of the rolls rotate at different speeds, one side of the lump<br>
travels faster than the other side and the lump is reoriented so that it falls and<br>
pulled through the rolls of its narrow sides. This helps to reduce the applied forces<br>
and amount of over-pulverized material (micro fines). Also since one side of lump<br>
travels faster, there is some change in the action of the breaking forces. Shear<br>
forces appear along with the crushing (compressive) forces. The shear forces<br>
crush the thin wall of the cavities in the lump before the compressive forces have<br>
a chance to act, thus effectively diminishing the latter.<br>
Since the shear action takes place over the weakest parts of the cavities, this type<br>
of fracture requires less force than the fracture by crushing. It will, therefore<br>
precede the latter. The newly formed small lumps rotate between and pass<br>
through rolls without experiencing additional compressive forces or wearing by<br>
each other. Also less force will be needed to further crush largest of these lumps,<br>
which also serves to reduce over pulverization of the fuel.<br><br><br>
In usual and existing practice roll crusher rolls are driven by electric motors and<br>
the required reduction in speed is achieved through pulleys. One smaller pulley is<br>
mounted over the shaft of motor and other bigger pulley is mounted over the roll<br>
shaft. Power transmission from motor to roll takes place through a set of belts.<br>
Both of the rolls are rotated at same speed with set value of speed reduction.<br>
For achieving the advantages of present invention, a very simple modification is<br>
required in conventional roll crushers. In the present system size of one of the<br>
pulley over motor shaft is changed marginally, so that one roll rotates at<br>
differential speed of 5-15 rpm. This change in speed changes the nature of forces<br>
and reduces the micro fines as discussed above.<br>
Conventional roll crushers have two rolls. The diameter of the crusher rolls is<br>
usually around 1000mm. The two rolls are supported over bearings and incased in<br>
close space. Gap between the rolls is kept as per requirement of the output size,<br>
for example 1.5 to 2.0 mm. One pulley is mounted over the shaft of each roll.<br>
Each roll is driven by a motor and pulley. The pulley which is mounted over the<br>
motor shaft is usually smaller in size. Power is transmitted to crusher rolls from<br>
drive through belts. The pulleys over the crusher rolls are three to four times<br>
bigger in diameter of the pulleys on motor shaft, so that a substantial reduction in<br>
speed of 3 to 4 times depending on the motor speed and the desired speed of the<br>
rolls is achieved. The entire system is mounted over a rigid frame.<br>
In case of differential speed crushing of the present invention, speed of one of roll<br>
is varied, which can be either increased or decreased for getting a differential<br>
speed. This can be achieved by a variation in the size of the either of the pulleys<br>
mounted on the roll crusher or the one mounted on the motor with respect to one<br>
of the rolls. However, procurement of smaller pulley with minor change in diameter<br>
is easier and economical and marginal increase in speed of one of the crusher roll<br>
is achieved by increasing the diameter of one of the pulley on motor shaft. Same<br>
can be achieved by also decreasing the diameter. Other dimensions of the pulley<br>
on motor shaft are unchanged. Therefore, a simple change in the diameter of a<br>
pulley is required.<br><br><br>
Value of the differential speed is a very important parameter in the present<br>
context. If the difference is too small, the system is not effective. If the difference<br>
is too large, the system has adverse effect on the life of the crusher rolls.<br>
The present invention also provides a method of crushing where the material for<br>
crushing is fed into a roll crusher as described above. The material is crushed and<br>
the output is received. The micro fine content in the output is found to be<br>
substantially less and the crushing index is also high.<br>
- Description of preferred embodiment<br>
The invention will now be illustrated with reference to the accompanying drawings<br>
wherein:<br>
Figure 1 shows a schematic arrangement of roll crusher of the present invention.<br>
Figure 2 shows a sectional view of the drive pulley.<br>
Figure 3a, 3b and 3c show the forces acting on the particle being crushed in the<br>
roll crushers.<br>
Schematic arrangement of roll crusher is shown in Figure 1. The roll crusher has<br>
two rolls (1). The diameter of the crusher rolls is 1000mm. The two rolls are<br>
supported over bearings and encased in close space. Gap between the rolls is<br>
kept as per requirement of the output size. In the preferred embodiment the gap is<br>
2.0mm. One pulley (2) is mounted over the shaft of each roll. One of the pulleys is<br>
slightly bigger than the other to impart differential speed of the rolls. Each roll is<br>
driven by a motor and pulley (3 and 4). One pulley, usually the smaller one is<br>
mounted over the motor shaft. Power is transmitted to crusher rolls from drive<br>
through belts (5). The pulleys over the crusher rolls are three to four times bigger<br>
in diameter of the pulleys on motor shaft, so that a substantial reduction in speed<br>
for example 3 to 4 times depending on the motor speed and the desired speed of<br>
the rolls. The entire system is mounted over a rigid frame (6).<br>
One of the pulleys (3) on the motors is slightly smaller to achieve a differential<br>
speed of 5 rpm.<br><br><br>
A sectional view of the pulley on the motor shaft is shown in Figure 2.<br>
The forces acting on a particle while being crushed is shown in Figure 3. Figures<br>
3a and 3b shows rolls of conventional crushers where the rolls rotate at the same<br>
speed. Whenever a particle (1) is crushed between rolls (2), the smooth rolls of<br>
the crusher work as a pair on the principle of crushing and partial abrasion. The<br>
particle is pulled into gap between the rolls, which rotate at the same speed is<br>
acted upon by pressure forces of equal magnitude and opposite sign. Thus only<br>
compressive forces act on the particle.<br>
Figure 3c shows rolls of the crusher in accordance to the present invention, which<br>
rotate at differential speed of AN. As a result, one side of the lump travels faster<br>
than the other side and the lump is reoriented so that it falls and pulled through<br>
the rolls of its narrow sides. This reduces the applied forces and amount of over<br>
pulverized material (micro fines). Also since one side of lump travels faster, there<br>
is some change in the action of the breaking forces. Shear forces appear along<br>
with the crushing (compressive) forces which lead to the advantages of the<br>
present invention.<br>
Example: Demonstration of improved crushing index and reduction of micro fines<br>
A comparative study of the performance of a conventional crusher with the<br>
crusher of the present invention in terms of the Crushing Index and percent micro<br>
fines produced was carried out. Crushing operations were carried out in both the<br>
crushers with different settings of crusher gap. The roll speed in the conventional<br>
crusher was 326 rpm for both rolls. In the crusher in accordance with the present<br>
invention, the speed of one of the rolls was increased to 331 rpm. The result of the<br>
study is shown in table 1.<br><br>
