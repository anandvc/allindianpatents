FIELD OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present disclosure relates to turbocharger lubrication, and more particularly<br>
to control of turbocharger lubrication in a hybrid electric vehicle.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Engines, such as internal combustion engines and diesel engines, produce drive<br>
torque that is transferred to a drivetrain. A forced induction system, such as a<br>
turbocharger, can increase the drive torque of the engine without significantly<br>
adding weight. By increasing the charge air density in the cylinder, additional fuel<br>
can be added and a higher combustion pressure is generated in each cylinder<br>
thereby improving the power-to-weight ratio for the engine. In order to achieve<br>
this boost in drive torque, a turbocharger converts exhaust gas flow energy to<br>
mechanical energy via a turbine. The turbine is connected to an intake air<br>
compressor via a shaft. The turbine is positioned in the exhaust flow and the<br>
compressor is positioned in the air intake flow.<br>
The turbocharger can operate at a high temperature due to the exhaust gas<br>
flowing therethrough. Additionally, the turbine, shaft, compressor, and<br>
associated bearings can spin at a high rate of speed, such as up to 100,000 rpm<br>
or more. The turbocharger utilizes lubricant, such as engine oil, to lubricate the<br>
rotating members and also to cool the turbocharger. The oil is provided by the<br>
engine's mechanical oil pump.<br>
The turbocharger can fail when the temperature of the turbocharger bearings is<br>
higher than the operating limit for the turbocharger. The turbocharger can also<br>
fail when the lubricant flow is insufficient to lubricate the rotating components.<br><br>
The turbocharger can also fail when the lubricant cokes in the turbocharger<br>
bearings due to high temperature with low or stagnant lubricant flow.<br>
The drive torque generated by the engine is transferred through a transmission<br>
that multiplies the drive torque by a gear ratio. Transmissions generally include<br>
multiple gear ratios through which the drive torque is transferred. Automatic<br>
transmissions automatically shift between gear ratios based on driver input and<br>
vehicle operating conditions. Hybrid powertrains typically include an electric<br>
machine and an energy storage device (ESD). In one mode, the electric machine<br>
drives the transmission using energy stored in the ESD. In another mode, the<br>
electric machine is driven by the engine to charge the ESD.<br>
Traditional transmission control systems determine shift decisions based on<br>
vehicle speed and throttle. The shift strategy is developed based on vehicle<br>
performance, drivability, and fuel economy based on anticipated driving<br>
conditions. The shift strategy also must account for engine sub-systems (e.g.,<br>
variable valve timing (WT)) and other features including, but not limited to,<br>
powertrain braking, throttle-position, sensor-based shifting, and hybrid vehicle<br>
functions. In a hybrid powertrain, the shift control strategy must also account for<br>
electrical requirements (i.e., driving or powering the electric machine).<br>
Hybrid powertrains can be operated to improve the efficiency of the powertrain.<br>
As such, the electric machine can be activated during advantageous operating<br>
conditions to provide supplemental and/or the entire drive torque transferred<br>
through the transmission. As a result of this architecture, the engine is frequently<br>
turned on and off during normal operation of the vehicle. Additionally, the<br>
turning on and off of the engine can be done abruptly. That is, the engine can be<br><br>
shut off immediately when an opportunity to improve the efficiency through the<br>
use of the electric machine is presented or at the completion of a charging<br>
operation. The abrupt shutoff does not allow the operation of the engine to<br>
slowly shut down, such as when coasting (accelerator pedal let off) and/or<br>
parking a vehicle wherein the engine is gradually reduced to idle as typically<br>
occurs in a non-hybrid vehicle. Additionally, the abrupt shutting off of the engine<br>
may result in the accessories being driven by operation of the engine also being<br>
turned off abruptly, such as the engine's mechanical oil pump.<br>
The frequent on and off events present a significant challenge in terms of<br>
meeting the lubricating and cooling needs of the turbocharger. Of particular<br>
concern is the supplying of an adequate lubricant flow to lubricate the<br>
turbocharger and provide cooling thereto during periods when the engine is<br>
turned off. When the engine is turned off, the engine oil pump is also shut down<br>
and no longer supplies oil to the turbocharger. The components of the<br>
turbocharger, however, depending on the operating condition immediately prior<br>
to engine shutoff, may continue to spin and generate heat as the turbocharger<br>
spools down. Hybrid powertrains present additional difficulties as the shutoff of<br>
the engine can be abrupt and can occur during a high rpm situation wherein the<br>
turbocharger is active and rotating at high rpms. As a result, when a<br>
turbocharged engine is utilized in a hybrid powertrain the control strategy must<br>
account for the lubricating and cooling needs of the turbocharger when the<br>
engine is being frequently turned on/off and when such turning off happens<br>
abruptly.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a lubrication control system to<br><br>
selectively supply a supplemental oil flow in a hybrid electric vehicle including an<br>
electric machine and a turbocharged engine. The lubrication control system<br>
utilizes an accumulator to store oil. The accumulator can be filled with oil during<br>
operation of the engine. A control valve can be selectively operated to allow oil<br>
stored in the accumulator to flow to the turbocharger. At least one control<br>
module can control operation of the hybrid electric vehicle. The at least one<br>
control module can determine an operating condition of the engine and<br>
command the control valve to open and close based on the operating condition.<br>
In another feature, the at least one control module determines if the engine if<br>
running. The at least one control module commands the control valve to open<br>
and close based upon whether the engine is running.<br>
In yet another feature, the at least one control module determines if an<br>
impending engine startup condition occurs. The at least one control module<br>
commands the control valve to open and close based upon whether an<br>
impending engine startup is occurring.<br>
In still another feature, the at least one control module monitors an oil pressure<br>
produced by operation of an oil pump driven by operation of the engine. The at<br>
least one control module commands the control valve to open and close based<br>
upon the oil pressure.<br>
In other features, the at least one control module can command the control<br>
valve to remain open for a predetermined period of time. Alternatively, the at<br>
least one control module can command the control valve to modulate open and<br>
closed for a predetermined period of time.<br>
In yet another feature, the at least one control module can monitor an operating<br><br>
speed of the turbocharger. The at least one control module can command the<br>
control valve to remain open so long as the operating speed is greater than a<br>
reference speed.<br>
Further areas of applicability will become apparent from the description provided<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The following description of the embodiments is merely exemplary in nature and<br>
is in no way intended to limit the invention, its application, or uses. For purposes<br>
of clarity, the same reference numbers will be used in the drawings to identify<br>
similar elements. As used herein, the term module refers to an application<br>
specific integrated circuit (ASIC), an electronic circuit, a processor (shared,<br>
dedicated, or group) and memory that execute one or more software or firmware<br>
programs, a combinational logic circuit, or other suitable components that<br>
provide the described functionality.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 1A, an exemplary hybrid vehicle 11 is schematically<br>
illustrated. Hybrid vehicle 11 includes an engine 12 and an electric machine 14,<br>
which selectively drive a transmission 16. More specifically, electric machine 14<br>
supplements engine 12 to produce drive torque to drive transmission 16. In this<br>
manner, fuel efficiency is increased and emissions are reduced. In one mode,<br>
engine 12 drives electric machine 14 to generate power used to recharge an<br>
energy storage device (ESD) 18, such as a battery. In another mode, electric<br>
machine 14 drives transmission 16 using energy from ESD 18.<br>
Engine 12 and electric machine 14 can be coupled via a belt-alternator-starter<br>
(BAS) system (not shown) that includes a belt and pulleys. Alternatively, engine<br>
12 and electric machine 14 can be coupled via a flywheel-alternator-starter (FAS)<br>
system (not shown), wherein electric machine 14 is operably disposed between<br><br>
engine 12 and transmission 16. It is anticipated that other systems can be<br>
implemented to couple engine 12 and electric machine 14 including, but not<br>
limited to, a chain or gear system that is implemented between electric machine<br>
14 and a crankshaft.<br>
Transmission 16 can include, but is not limited to, a continuously variable<br>
transmission (CVT), a manual transmission, an automatic transmission and an<br>
automated manual transmission (AMT). Drive torque is transferred from engine<br>
12 to transmission 16 through a coupling device 20. Coupling device 20 can<br>
include, but is not limited to, a friction clutch or a torque converter depending<br>
upon the type of transmission implemented. In the case of a CVT, coupling<br>
device 20 includes a torque converter and a torque converter clutch (TCC).<br>
Transmission 16 multiplies the drive torque through one of a plurality of gear<br>
ratios to drive a vehicle driveline (not shown).<br>
In an alternate configuration, as shown in FIG. 1B, transmission 16' can include<br>
an electrically variable transmission incorporating the electric machine 14' and<br>
can be controllable to selectively provide both a fixed ratio-operating mode (such<br>
as through fixed gears) and an electrically variable operating mode. In this<br>
configuration, two motors/generators can be included in transmission 16' and<br>
does not require the electric machine 14' to be directly coupled to engine 12' or<br>
to a fly wheel (not shown).<br>
Hybrid vehicle 11 can include a turbocharger 22 that pumps air into engine 12 to<br>
increase performance. Turbocharger 22 can be connected to an exhaust system<br>
24 to receive exhaust gases from engine 12 to drive a turbine (not shown)<br>
therein. Turbocharger 22 is also disposed in intake air system 28 of engine 12.<br>
Intake air is compressed with a compressor (not shown) within turbocharger 22<br><br>
and is forced into the combustion chambers (not shown) of engine 12. The<br>
intake air can pass through an intercooler 30 prior to flowing into the combustion<br>
chambers of engine 12. Intercooler 30 can be an air-to-air intercooler or an air-<br>
to-liquid intercooler and can extract heat from the compressed intake air prior to<br>
flowing into the combustion chambers in engine 12. The turbine and compressor<br>
in turbocharger 22 are interconnected by a shaft (not shown) and convert<br>
exhaust gas flow energy to mechanical energy that is utilized to compress the<br>
intake air. Although FIG. 1 depicts turbocharger 22 as being a single<br>
turbocharger, it can be appreciated that hybrid vehicle 11 may include additional<br>
turbochargers 22. For example, hybrid vehicles having twin turbochargers or<br>
more are contemplated. Turbochargers 22 can be single or dual-stage turbos.<br>
Turbocharger 22 may include a variable geometry turbine. Turbocharger 22 may<br>
include a fixed geometry turbine. One or more blow-off valves (not shown) may<br>
be included in intake air system 28. Turbocharger 22 may include liquid-cooled<br>
bearing housings to enhance hybrid-vehicle turbocharger durability in<br>
combination with the lubrication and cooling effects of the present invention.<br>
A control module 32 regulates operation of vehicle 11 and implements the<br>
lubrication control system of the present invention. A current sensor 34<br>
generates a current signal that is sent to control module 32. A voltage sensor 36<br>
generates a battery voltage signal that is sent to control module 32. Control<br>
module 32 determines a state of charge (SOC) of ESD 18 based on current and<br>
voltage signals. There are several methods that can be implemented to<br>
determine the SOC. An exemplary method is disclosed in commonly assigned U.S.<br>
Pat. No. 6,646,419, issued on Nov. 11, 2003, and entitled "State of Charge<br>
Algorithm for Lead-Acid Battery in a Hybrid Electric Vehicle," the disclosure of<br>
which is expressly incorporated herein by reference. An accelerator pedal (not<br><br>
shown) enables a driver to indicate a desired engine torque output. A position<br>
sensor can be responsive to a position of the accelerator pedal. The position<br>
sensor can generate a position signal that indicates the desired engine torque<br>
output. Control module 32 generates shift signals (i.e., upshift, downshift) based<br>
on the driver input.<br>
Control module 32 will operate engine 12 and/or electric machine 14 to meet the<br>
desired torque output. During the controlling of the desired torque output,<br>
control module 32 can frequently turn engine 12 on and off and provide desired<br>
torque output solely with electric machine 14. Control module 32 can also<br>
operate engine 12 to charge ESD 18.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 2, an exemplary turbocharger lubrication circuit 40 is<br>
schematically illustrated. Lubrication circuit 40 can utilize the lubrication circuit of<br>
engine 12. Specifically, lubrication circuit 40 can include oil sump 42, engine oil<br>
pump 44, and filter 46. Oil sump 42 can be part of engine 12. Engine oil pump<br>
44 can be a mechanical pump within engine 12 that operates during operation of<br>
engine 12. A pressure sensor 48 generates a pressure signal that is sent to<br>
control module 32. Control module 32 can ascertain the oil pressure P0M based on<br>
the pressure signal. A supply line 50 supplies oil from downstream of pressure<br>
sensor 48 to turbocharger 22. A return oil line 52 directs oil from turbocharger 22<br>
back into sump 42.<br>
In lubrication circuit 40, an accumulator 56 communicates with oil supply line 50<br>
upstream of turbocharger 22. An inlet line 58 interconnects oil supply line 50<br>
with an oil reservoir 60 in accumulator 56. An outlet line 62 interconnects oil<br>
reservoir 60 with oil supply line 50 downstream of inlet line 58 and upstream of<br>
turbocharger 22. Accumulator 56 includes a gas reservoir 64 separated from oil<br><br>
reservoir 60 by a piston or bladder 66. Gas reservoir 64 includes a gas, such as<br>
nitrogen or air. Piston 66 serves to separate the oil in oil reservoir 60 from the<br>
gas in gas reservoir 64. Other accumulator designs including an energy storage<br>
device such as a spring may also be used.<br>
To control the flow of oil into and out of accumulator 56, a first check valve 70 is<br>
disposed in oil supply line 50 upstream of inlet line 58. A second check valve 72<br>
is disposed in inlet line 58. A control valve 74 is disposed in outlet line 62.<br>
Control valve 74 is normally closed. Control valve 74 is operated by control<br>
module 32. Check valves 70, 72 provide very little or a small resistance to flow<br>
and allow oil flowing through oil supply line 50 to flow into oil reservoir 60 of<br>
accumulator 56. When control valve 74 is closed, oil reservoir 60 will fill with oil<br>
and achieve a pressure about the same as the line pressure in oil supply line 50.<br>
First check valve 70 prevents downstream oil from backflowing in oil supply line<br>
50 past first check valve 70. Second check valve 72 prevents oil in oil reservoir<br>
60 from discharging back into oil supply line 50 through inlet line 58.<br>
Turbocharger 22 can include a speed sensor 78 that generates a signal that is<br>
sent to control module 32. Speed sensor 78 enables control module 32 to<br>
ascertain the speed STC at which the turbine and/or compressor are spinning<br>
within turbocharger 22.<br>
Control module 32 can include multiple modules therein to control the various<br>
aspects of hybrid vehicle 11. For example, as shown in FIG. 2, control module 32<br>
can include an engine control module (ECM) 80 and a hybrid control module<br>
(HCM) 82. ECM 80 can receive signals from engine 12, pressure sensor 48 and<br>
speed sensor 78. ECM 80 can control operation of engine 12, turbocharger 22<br>
and other related components.<br><br>
ECM 80 includes a valve module 84 to control operation of control valve 74 to<br>
supply oil from accumulator 56 to turbocharger 22, as described below. ECM 80<br>
and HCM 82 communicate with one another. HCM 82 controls and coordinates<br>
the overall operation of hybrid vehicle 11 including the operation of electric<br>
machine 14, transmission 16, and ESD 18, along with engine 12 and<br>
turbocharger 22 through ECM 80. Current and voltage sensors 34, 36 can<br>
communicate with HCM 82 as shown in FIG. 1. HCM 82 can inform ECM 80 of a<br>
desired operational condition of engine 12 and when to shut down and turn on<br>
engine 12. Additionally, HCM 82 can inform ECM 80 of an impending shutdown<br>
and startup condition, allowing ECM 80 to prepare for same. HCM 82, when<br>
appropriate, commands ECM 80 to shut engine 12 off and turn engine 12 on.<br>
ECM 80 includes an operating condition detection module (OCDM) 86 operable to<br>
determine whether an operating condition of turbocharged engine 12 exists. For<br>
example, OCDM 86 may determine if engine 12 has been shut down by<br>
evaluating a signal from speed sensor 78 or signals from engine 12. Furthermore,<br>
OCDM 86 may determine if an oil pressure provided by engine oil pump 44 is<br>
below a predetermined threshold. Valve module 84 opens a valve to supply oil to<br>
turbocharger 22 if the predetermined condition exists. Although FIG. 2 depicts<br>
control module 32 as containing several distinct modules communicating with<br>
one another, it can be appreciated that control module 32 can be a single<br>
integral control module or may include additional control modules to control<br>
operation of hybrid vehicle 11.<br>
Lubrication circuit 40 can supply oil to turbocharger 22 during operation of<br>
engine 12, when engine 12 is shut down, and also prior to engine 12 startup.<br>
Specifically, turbocharger 22 is supplied oil from engine oil pump 44 through oil<br>
supply line 50 when engine 12 is operating. When engine 12 is shut down or<br><br>
prior to engine 12 startup, accumulator 56 can be operated to supply oil flow to<br>
turbocharger 22. Specifically, control valve 74 can be opened to allow oil within<br>
pressurized oil reservoir 60 to flow to turbocharger 22 through control valve 74,<br>
outlet line 62, and oil supply line 50. First check valve 70 prevents oil flowing<br>
from oil reservoir 60 from backflowing in oil supply line 50. When valve 74 is<br>
closed and engine 12 is running, oil reservoir 60 will refill due to a portion of the<br>
oil in oil supply line 50 flowing through inlet line 58 and second check valve 72<br>
while control valve 74 is closed. In this manner, oil reservoir 60 automatically<br>
refills when control valve 74 is in its normally closed state and engine 12 is<br>
running/starts up.<br>
The communication between HCM 82 and ECM 80 allows HCM 82 to inform ECM<br>
80 of an impending or upcoming shutdown or startup. This advance notification<br>
can allow ECM 80 to anticipate the need to supply a supplemental oil supply to<br>
turbocharger 22. ECM 80 can then begin to supply the supplemental oil flow to<br>
turbocharger 22 instantaneous with, just prior to, or immediately following<br>
shutdown of engine 12 and instantaneous with or just prior to startup of engine<br>
12 by commanding control valve 74 to open. If control valve 74 opens prior to<br>
engine 12 being shut down, oil in oil reservoir 60 will remain therein until the oil<br>
pressure P0N in the supply line 50 drops below the oil pressure P0H res in oil<br>
reservoir 60. Once the oil pressure P0N in supply line 50 drops below the pressure<br>
Poii res in oil reservoir 60, oil will begin to flow from oil reservoir 60 through outlet<br>
line 62 and into supply line 50 for supply to turbocharger 22. As a result, oil flow<br>
from oil reservoir 60 can begin to occur as soon as the oil pressure P0n in supply<br>
line 50 drops below the oil pressure P0n res in accumulator 56. If control valve 74<br>
opens just prior to or instantaneously with startup of engine 12, oil in oil<br>
reservoir 60 can immediately begin flowing from oil reservoir 60 through outlet<br><br>
line 62 and into supply line 50 for supply to turbo charger 22. As a result, oil flow<br>
from oil reservoir 60 can begin to occur as soon as or just prior to operation of<br>
turbo charger 22 in conjunction with startup of engine 12.<br>
The lubrication control system of the present invention accounts for engine 12<br>
being abruptly turned on and off to supply a supplemental oil flow from<br>
accumulator 56 to turbocharger 22. Referring now to FIG. 3, the steps executed<br>
by the lubrication control system according to the first embodiment of the<br>
present teachings will be described in detail. In step 100, control monitors the<br>
status of engine 12. In step 102, control determines whether engine 12 is<br>
operating or being shut off. If engine 12 is operating, control continues to<br>
monitor the engine status in step 100. Control continues to monitor the status of<br>
engine 12 and performs steps 100 and 102 until control determines that engine<br>
12 is shutting off. When control determines engine 12 is shutting down, control<br>
goes to step 104 and implements a supplemental oil supply mode.<br>
The lubrication control system according to the present invention can operate in<br>
a variety of modes to supply supplemental oil to turbocharger 22. Control utilizes<br>
one of these supplemental oil supply modes to supply oil to turbocharger 22<br>
when instructed in step 104.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 4, the steps executed when control implements a first<br>
supplemental oil supply mode will be described in detail. In step 200, control<br>
opens control valve 74. The opening of control valve 74 allows oil within oil<br>
reservoir 60 to flow through outlet line 62 and into turbocharger 22. In step 202,<br>
control starts timer T0 that is utilized to control the duration for which control<br>
valve 74 remains open. In step 204, control monitors time T0for which control<br><br>
valve 74 has been open. In step 206, control monitors the status of engine 12.<br>
In step 208, control ascertains if engine 12 is running. If engine 12 is not<br>
running, control implements step 210.<br>
In step 210, control compares time T0 to a reference time Tref. Tref is the<br>
maximum time period for which control valve 74 is to remain open. The duration<br>
Tref can be based on modeling of lubrication circuit 40 and the flow resistance<br>
therethrough and can be set to ensure that all or some portion of the usable oil<br>
within oil reservoir 60 is supplied to turbocharger 22 for lubrication and cooling<br>
therein. If T0 is not greater than Tref, control goes back and implements step 204.<br>
Control will continue to implement steps 204, 206, 208, and 210 as long as<br>
engine 12 remains off and the open time T0 is not greater than Tref. When T0&gt;Tref;<br>
control implements step 212. In step 212, control closes control valve 74. In step<br>
214, control ends implementation of the first supplemental oil supply mode.<br>
If engine 12 is started while control is implementing the first supplemental oil<br>
supply mode, control moves from step 208 to step 212 and closes control valve<br>
74 and accumulator 56 refills with oil being supplied by the operation of engine<br>
12. In step 214, control ends implementation of the first supplemental oil supply<br>
mode.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 5, the steps executed when control implements a second<br>
supplemental oil supply mode will be described in detail. In step 300, control<br>
begins modulating the opening and closing of control valve 74. To modulate<br>
control valve 74, control commands control valve 74 to be open for a first<br>
predetermined period of time and then remain closed for a second<br>
predetermined period of time. Control continues to open and close control valve<br><br>
74 for the first and second predetermined periods of time. The first and second<br>
predetermined periods of time can be the same or differ from one another. The<br>
modulating of control valve 74 results in accumulator 56 supplying pulses of flow<br>
of oil from oil reservoir 60 to turbocharger 22. The modulating can extend the<br>
duration of time that accumulator 56 can supply oil to turbocharger 22 for a<br>
given volume of oil in oil reservoir 60.<br>
In step 302, control starts a timer Tm that is utilized to control the duration for<br>
which control valve 74 is modulated open and closed. In step 304, control<br>
monitors time Tm for which control valve 74 has been modulating open and<br>
closed. In step 306, control monitors the status of engine 12. In step 308,<br>
control ascertains if engine 12 is running. If engine 12 is not running, control<br>
implements step 310.<br>
In step 310, control compares time Tm to a reference time Tref. Tref is the<br>
maximum time period for which control valve 74 is modulated open and closed.<br>
The duration of Tref can be based on a model of lubrication circuit 40 and the<br>
flow resistance therethrough and can be selected to ensure that all or some<br>
portion of the useable oil within oil reservoir 60 is supplied to turbocharger 22 for<br>
lubrication and cooling therein. Control will go back to step 304 if Tm is not<br>
greater than Tref. Control will continue to implement steps 304, 306, 308, and<br>
310 as long as engine 12 remains off and Tm is not greater than Tref.<br>
When Tm&gt;Tref, control implements step 312. In step 312, control closes control<br>
valve 74 and the modulation ends. In step 314, control ends implementation of<br>
the second supplemental oil supply mode.<br>
If engine 12 is started while control is implementing the second supplemental oil<br><br>
supply mode, control moves from step 308 to step 312 and ceases the<br>
modulation of control valve 74 and accumulator 56 refills with oil being supplied<br>
by operation of engine 12. In step 314, control ends implementation of the<br>
second supplemental oil supply mode.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 6, the steps executed when control implements a third<br>
supplemental oil supply mode will be described in detail. In step 400, control<br>
opens valve 74 to allow oil in oil reservoir 60 to flow to turbocharger 22. In step<br>
404, control monitors the speed STC of turbocharger 22. The speed STC of<br>
turbocharger 22 is utilized to ascertain the duration for which control valve 74 is<br>
to remain open and oil is to flow from oil reservoir 60 to turbocharger 22.<br>
In step 406, control monitors the status of engine 12. In step 408, control<br>
ascertains if engine 12 is running. If engine 12 is not running, control<br>
implements step 410.<br>
In step 410, control compares speed STC of turbocharger 22 to a reference speed<br>
Sref. The reference speed Sref is utilized as a setpoint at which control valve 74<br>
can be closed and the use of supplemental oil from accumulator 56 ended. Sref<br>
can be chosen to reflect a speed at which damage to turbocharger 22 will not<br>
occur or is unlikely when spooling down and oil flow thereto has ceased. If STC is<br>
not less than Sref, control returns to step 404. Control continues to implement<br>
steps 404, 406, 408, and 410 as long as engine 12 remains off and STC is not less<br>
than Sref.<br>
When STc<sref control implements step in closes></sref>
valve 74 thereby ceasing the flow of oil from oil reservoir 60 to turbocharger 22.<br>
Depending upon the quantity of oil in oil reservoir 60 at the beginning of<br><br>
implementation of the third supplemental oil supply mode and the rate at which<br>
turbocharger 22 spools down, the oil may run out prior to SJC being less than Sref.<br>
In step 414, control ends implementation of the third supplemental supply mode.<br>
If engine 12 is started while control is implementing the third supplemental oil<br>
supply mode, control moves from step 408 to step 412 and closes control valve<br>
74 and accumulator 56 refills with oil being supplied by the operation of engine<br>
12. In step 414, control ends implementation of the third supplemental oil supply<br>
mode.<br>
Thus, the lubricant control system according to the first embodiment can monitor<br>
the status of engine 12 and implement a supplemental oil supply mode when<br>
engine 12 is shut down. The supplemental oil supply modes allow oil from<br>
accumulator 56 to flow to turbocharger 22 and continue to lubricate and cool<br>
turbocharger 22 as it spools down. The lubrication control system can start up<br>
again once engine 12 is turned on.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 7, the steps executed by the lubrication control system<br>
according to the second embodiment of the present teachings will be described<br>
in detail. In this embodiment, the oil pressure R0si in lubrication circuit 40 is<br>
utilized as an indicator of whether engine 12 is operating or not. In step 500,<br>
control monitors the oil pressure Poii in lubrication circuit 40. In step 502, control<br>
compares the oil pressure P0N to a reference pressure Pref and ascertains if P0H is<br>
less than Pref. Pref can be the minimum oil pressure in lubrication circuit 40 which<br>
is indicative of engine oil pump 44 operating and supplying oil to lubrication<br>
circuit 40. If P0n is not less than Preference/ control continues to monitor the oil<br>
pressure P0n in step 500. Control continues to monitor oil pressure P0N and<br><br>
perform steps 500 and 502 until control determines that P0ii<pref- when control></pref->
determines that P0n<pref control goes to step and implements a></pref>
supplemental oil supply mode.<br>
The lubrication control system according to the present invention can operate in<br>
a variety of modes to supply supplemental oil to turbocharger 22. Control utilizes<br>
one of the supplemental oil supply modes to supply oil to turbocharger 22 when<br>
instructed in step 504.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 8, the steps executed when control implements a fourth<br>
supplemental oil supply mode will be described in detail. The fourth<br>
supplemental oil supply mode is similar to the first supplemental oil supply mode<br>
described above, the difference being that control monitors the oil pressure P0n<br>
and compares that to a reference pressure Pref instead of directly monitoring the<br>
engine status. In step 600, control opens control valve 74. The opening of<br>
control valve 74 allows oil within oil reservoir 60 to flow through outlet line 62<br>
and into turbocharger 22. In step 602, control starts timer T0that is utilized to<br>
control the duration for which control valve 74 remains open. In step 604,<br>
control monitors time T0 for which control valve 74 has been open. In step 606,<br>
control monitors oil pressure P0n in lubrication circuit 40. In step 608, control<br>
ascertains if oil pressure P0n is less than reference pressure Pref. If P0ii<pref></pref>
control implements step 610.<br>
In step 610, control compares time T0 to a reference time Trer. Trer is the<br>
maximum time period for which control valve 74 is to remain open. The duration<br>
Tref can be based on modeling of lubrication circuit 40 and the flow resistance<br>
therethrough and can be set to ensure that all or some portion of the usable oil<br><br>
within oil reservoir 60 is supplied to turbocharger 22 for lubrication and cooling<br>
therein. If T0 is not greater than Tref, control goes back and implements step 604.<br>
Control will continue to implement steps 604, 606, 608, and 610 as long as R0n<br>
remains less than Pref and the open time T0 is not greater than Tref. When T0&gt;Tref,<br>
control implements step 612. In step 612, control closes control valve 74. In step<br>
614, control ends implementation of the fourth supplemental oil supply mode.<br>
If Poii becomes greater than or equal to Pref (indicting that oil is being supplied by<br>
engine oil pump 44) while control is implementing the fourth supplemental oil<br>
supply mode, control moves from step 608 to step 612 and closes control valve<br>
74 and accumulator 56 refills with oil being supplied by the operation of engine<br>
12. In step 614, control ends implementation of the fourth supplemental oil<br>
supply mode.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 9, the steps executed when control implements a fifth<br>
supplemental oil supply mode will be described in detail. The fifth supplemental<br>
oil supply mode is similar to the second supplemental oil supply mode discussed<br>
above, the difference being that control monitors the oil pressure P0ii and<br>
compares that to a reference pressure Pref instead of directly monitoring the<br>
engine status. In step 700, control begins modulating the opening and closing of<br>
control valve 74. To modulate control valve 74, control commands control valve<br>
74 to be open for a first predetermined period of time and then remain closed for<br>
a second predetermined period of time. Control continues to open and close<br>
control valve 74 for the first and second predetermined periods of time. The first<br>
and second predetermined periods of time can be the same or differ from one<br>
another. The modulating of control valve 74 results in accumulator 56 supplying<br>
pulses of flow of oil from oil reservoir 60 to turbocharger 22. The modulating can<br><br>
extend the duration of time that accumulator 56 can supply oil to turbocharger<br>
22 for a given volume of oil in oil reservoir 60.<br>
In step 702, control starts a timer Tm that is utilized to control the duration for<br>
which control valve 74 is modulated open and closed. In step 704, control<br>
monitors time Tm for which control valve 74 has been modulating open and<br>
closed. In step 706, control monitors oil pressure P0H in lubrication circuit 40. In<br>
step 708, control ascertains if P0n is less than reference pressure Pref. If P0ii<pref></pref>
control implements step 710.<br>
In step 710, control compares time Tm to a reference time Tref. Tref is the<br>
maximum time period for which control valve 74 is modulated open and closed.<br>
The duration of Tref can be based on a model of lubrication circuit 40 and the<br>
flow resistance therethrough and can be selected to ensure that all or some<br>
portion of the usable oil within oil reservoir 60 is supplied to turbocharger 22 for<br>
lubrication and cooling therein. Control will go back to step 704 if Tm is not<br>
greater than Tref. Control will continue to implement steps 704, 706, 708, and<br>
710 as long as P0M is less than Pref and Tm is not greater than Tref. When Tm&gt;Tref,<br>
control implements step 712. In step 712, control closes control valve 74 and the<br>
modulation ends. In step 714, control ends implementation of the fifth<br>
supplemental oil supply mode.<br>
If P0ji becomes greater than or equal to Pref (indicating that oil is being supplied<br>
by engine oil pump 44) while control is implementing the fifth supplemental oil<br>
supply mode, control moves from step 708 to step 712 and ceases the<br>
modulation of control valve 74 and accumulator 56 refills with oil being supplied<br>
by operation of engine 12. In step 714, control ends implementation of the fifth<br><br>
supplemental oil supply mode.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 10, the steps executed when control implements a sixth<br>
supplemental oil supply mode will be described in detail. The sixth supplemental<br>
oil supply mode is similar to the third supplemental oil supply mode described<br>
above, the difference being that control monitors the oil pressure R0si and<br>
compares that to a reference pressure Pref instead of directly monitoring the<br>
engine status. In step 800, control opens valve 74 to allow oil in oil reservoir 60<br>
to flow to turbocharger 22. In step 804, control monitors the speed Src of<br>
turbocharger 22. The speed STC of turbocharger 22 is utilized to ascertain the<br>
duration for which control valve 74 is to remain open and oil is to flow from oil<br>
reservoir 60 to turbocharger 22. In step 806, control monitors the oil pressure R0ii<br>
in lubrication circuit 40. In step 808, control ascertains if oil pressure P0si is less<br>
than reference pressure Pref. If P0ii<pref control implements step></pref>
In step 810, control compares speed STC of turbocharger 22 to a reference speed<br>
Sref. The reference speed Sref is utilized as a setpoint at which control valve 74<br>
can be closed and the use of supplemental oil from accumulator 56 ended. Sref<br>
can be chosen to reflect a speed at which damage to turbocharger 22 will not<br>
occur or is unlikely when the spooling down and oil flow thereto has ceased. If<br>
STC is not less than Sref, control returns to step 804. Control continues to<br>
implement steps 804, 806, 808, and 810 as long as P0H is less than Prefand STC is<br>
not less than Sref.<br>
When STc<sref control implements step in closes></sref>
valve 74, thereby ceasing the flow of oil from oil reservoir 60 to turbocharger 22.<br>
Depending upon the quantity of oil in oil reservoir 60 at the beginning of<br><br>
implementation of the sixth supplemental oil supply mode and the rate at which<br>
turbocharger 22 spools down, the oil may run out prior to STC being less than Sref.<br>
In step 814, control ends implementation of the sixth supplemental supply mode.<br>
If Poii becomes greater than or equal to Pref (indicating that oil is being supplied<br>
by engine oil pump 44) while control is implementing the sixth supplemental oil<br>
supply mode, control moves from step 808 to step 812 and closes control valve<br>
74 and accumulator 56 refills with oil being supplied by the operation of engine<br>
12. In step 814, control ends implementation of the sixth supplemental oil supply<br>
mode.<br>
Thus, the lubricant control system according to the second embodiment can<br>
monitor the status of the oil pressure P0n in lubrication circuit 40 and implement a<br>
supplemental oil supply mode when P0N is less than a reference pressure Pref. The<br>
supplemental oil supply modes allow oil from accumulator 56 to flow to<br>
turbocharger 22 and continue to lubricate and cool turbocharger 22 as it spools<br>
down. The lubrication control system will start up again once engine 12 is turned<br>
on and engine oil pump 44 begins to supply oil to turbocharger 22.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 11, the steps executed by the lubrication control system<br>
according to the third embodiment of the present teachings will be described in<br>
detail. In this embodiment, control looks for an impending engine startup. In<br>
step 900, control monitors the status of engine 12. In step 902, control<br>
determines whether engine 12 is about to be started (impending engine startup).<br>
If an impending engine startup condition is not occurring, control continues to<br>
monitor the engine status in step 900. Control continues to monitor the status of<br>
engine 12 and perform steps 900 and 902 until control determines that startup<br><br>
of engine 12 is impending. When control determines that an impending startup<br>
of engine 12 is occurring, control goes to step 904 and implements a<br>
supplemental oil supply mode.<br>
The lubrication control system according to the present invention can operate in<br>
a variety of modes to supply supplemental oil to turbocharger 22. Control utilizes<br>
one of the supplemental oil supply modes to supply oil to turbocharger 22 when<br>
instructed in step 904.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 12, the steps executed when control implements a seventh<br>
supplemental oil supply mode will be described in detail. In step 1000, control<br>
opens control valve 74. The opening of control valve 74 allows oil within oil<br>
reservoir 60 to flow through outlet line 62 and into turbocharger 22. In step<br>
1002, control starts timer T0 that is utilized to control the duration for which<br>
control valve 74 remains open. In step 1004, control monitors time T0 for which<br>
control valve 74 has been open.<br>
In step 1010, control compares time T0 to a reference time Tref. Tref is the<br>
maximum time period for which control valve 74 is to remain open. The duration<br>
Tref can be based on modeling of lubrication circuit 40 and of engine 12 startup<br>
and can be set to ensure that all or some portion of the useable oil within oil<br>
reservoir 60 is supplied to turbocharger 22 for lubrication and cooling therein. If<br>
T0 is not greater than Tref, control goes back and implements step 1004. Control<br>
will continue to implement steps 1004 and 1010 as long as the open time T0 is<br>
not greater than Tref. When T0&gt;Tref, control implements step 1012. In step 1012,<br>
control closes control valve 74. In step 1014, control ends implementation of the<br>
seventh supplemental oil supply mode.<br><br>
Referring now to FIG. 13, the steps executed when control implements an eighth<br>
supplemental oil supply mode will be described in detail. In step 1100, control<br>
begins modulating the opening and closing of control valve 74. To modulate<br>
control valve 74, control commands control valve 74 to be open for a first<br>
predetermined period of time and then remain closed for a second<br>
predetermined period of time. Control continues to open and close control valve<br>
74 for the first and second predetermined periods of time. The first and second<br>
predetermined periods of time can be the same or differ from one another. The<br>
modulating of control valve 74 results in accumulator 56 supplying pulses of flow<br>
of oil from oil reservoir 60 to turbocharger 22. The modulating can extend the<br>
duration of time that accumulator 56 can supply oil to turbocharger 22 for a<br>
given volume of oil in oil reservoir 60.<br>
In step 1102, control starts a timer Tmthat is utilized to control the duration for<br>
which control valve 74 is modulated open and closed. In step 1104, control<br>
monitors time Tm for which control valve 74 has been modulating open and<br>
closed.<br>
In step 1110, control compares time Tm to a reference time Tref. Tref is the<br>
maximum time period for which control valve 74 is modulated open and closed.<br>
The duration of Tref can be based on a model of lubrication circuit 40 and the<br>
startup of engine 12 and can be selected to ensure that all or some portion of<br>
the useable oil within oil reservoir 60 is supplied to turbocharger 22 for<br>
lubrication and cooling therein. Control will go back to step 1104 if Tm is not<br>
greater than Tref. Control will continue to implement steps 1104 and 1110 as long<br>
as Tm is not greater than Tref.<br><br>
When Tm&gt;Tref, control implements step 1112. In step 1112, control closes control<br>
valve 74 and the modulation ends. In step 1114, control ends implementation of<br>
the eighth supplemental oil supply mode.<br>
Referring now to FIG. 14, the steps executed when control implements a ninth<br>
supplemental oil supply mode will be described in detail. In step 1200, control<br>
opens control valve 74, The opening of control valve 74 allows oil within oil<br>
reservoir 60 to flow through outlet line 62 and into turbocharger 22. In step<br>
1204, control monitors the oil pressure P0» in lubrication circuit 40.<br>
In step 1210, control compares the oil pressure P0N to a reference pressure Pref.<br>
Pref is the oil pressure at which supplemental oil flow from accumulator 56 is not<br>
required. Pref can be based on modeling of the lubrication circuit 40 and the<br>
lubrication and cooling needs of turbocharger 22 and can be set to ensure that<br>
an adequate supply of oil is flowing to turbocharger 22 for lubrication and cooling<br>
therein. If Poii is not greater than Pref, control goes back and implements step<br>
1204. Control will continue to implement steps 1204 and 1210 as long as P0ii<br>
remains less than Pref.<br>
When Poii&gt;Pref (indicating that an adequate flow of oil is being supplied by engine<br>
oil pump 44), control moves to step 1212. In step 1212, control closes control<br>
valve 74. In step 1214, control ends implementation of the ninth supplemental<br>
oil supply mode.<br>
Thus, the lubricant control system according to the third embodiment can<br>
monitor the status of engine 12 and implement a supplemental oil supply mode<br>
when an impending engine startup condition exists. The supplemental oil supply<br>
modes allow oil from accumulator 56 to flow to turbocharger 22 and provide<br><br>
lubrication and cooling to turbocharger 22 prior to or instantaneous with the<br>
startup of engine 12 and of turbocharger 22. The third embodiment utilizes oil<br>
stored in accumulator 56 from a prior shutdown of engine 12. The lubrication<br>
control system will startup again once another impending startup of engine 12<br>
condition exists.<br>
The lubrication control systems according to the present teachings can supply a<br>
supplemental oil flow to a turbocharger when the engine is shut down and prior<br>
to startup. The ability to supply a supplemental oil flow is particularly<br>
advantageous in a hybrid application wherein the engine can be started up and<br>
shut down abruptly and oil flow to the turbocharger ceased immediately<br>
regardless of its current operating state. The lubrication control system can<br>
utilize a self-replenishing reservoir to supply the oil to the turbocharger. When<br>
the engine is operating, the reservoir automatically refills to be available to<br>
supply a supplemental oil flow upon a subsequent engine shutdown. The<br>
lubrication control system can anticipate the imminent shutdown of the engine to<br>
minimize or reduce a lag time between the supplying of oil to the turbocharger<br>
from the engine to supplying the supplemental oil flow from the accumulator.<br>
The lubrication control system can also anticipate the imminent startup of the<br>
engine to supply oil to the turbocharger prior to or instantaneous with the<br>
startup of the engine and/or the turbocharger. The lubrication control system<br>
can monitor the status of the engine and/or an oil pressure. When the engine is<br>
shut off, is about to be started, and/or the oil pressure drops below a reference<br>
value, the lubrication control system can implement one of a variety of<br>
supplemental oil supply modes to continue to supply oil to the turbocharger.<br>
Those skilled in the art can now appreciate from the foregoing description that<br><br>
the broad teachings of the present disclosure can be implemented in a variety of<br>
forms. Therefore, while this disclosure has been described in connection with<br>
particular examples thereof, the true scope of the disclosure should not be so<br>
limited since other modifications will become apparent to the skilled practitioner<br>
upon a study of the drawings, the specification, and the following claims.<br><br>
