				<td>HEMIASTERLIN DERIVATIVES AND USES THEREOF<br>
Priority Claim<br>
[0001] The present application claims priority to U.S. Provisional Patent<br>
Application Number 60/366,592, filed March 22, 2002, the entire contents of which<br>
are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
[0002] Hemiasterlin (1) was first isolated from the sponge Hemiasterella minor<br>
(class, Demospongiae; order, Hadromedidia; family, Hemiasterllidae) collected in<br>
Sodwana Bay, South Africa (see, Kashman et al. U.S. patent 5,661,175). It was<br>
reported that Hemiasterlin exhibited antitumor activity against several cell lines,<br>
including human lung carcinoma, human colon carcinoma and human melanoma.<br><br>
[0003] After the initial isolation and reporting of this compound, additional<br>
hemiasterlins were isolated, and several hemiasterlin derivatives were synthesized and<br>
their biological activity was also investigated. It was subsequently reported that<br>
Hemiasterlin and certain analogs thereof exhibit antimitotic activity and thus are<br>
useful for the treatment of certain cancers (see, U.S. Patent No. 6,153,590 and PCT<br>
application WO 99/32509). However, only a rather limited number of Hemiasterlin<br>
analogs were prepared, half of which were the natural products themselves, isolated<br>
from Cymbastela sp., or were obtained by modifications to the natural products. Thus<br>
the number and types of derivatives that could be prepared and evaluated for<br>
biological activity were limited.<br>
[0004] Clearly, there remains a need to develop synthetic methodologies to access<br>
and examine the therapeutic effect of a variety of novel derivatives of Hemiasterlin,<br>
particularly those that are inaccessible by making modifications to the natural product.<br>
It would also be of particular interest to develop novel compounds that exhibit a<br>
fariable therapeutic profile in vivo (e.g., are safe and effective, while retaining<br>
stability in biological media).<br>
Summary of the Invention<br>
[0005] As discussed above, there remains a need to develop novel Hemiasterlin<br>
analogs to evaluate their potential as therapeutic agents for the treatment of cancer.<br>
The present invention provides novel compounds of general formula (I),<br><br>
and additionally provides methods for the synthesis thereof and methods for<br>
the use thereof in the treatment of cancer, wherein R1-R7, X1, X2, R, Q, and n are as<br>
defined herein. The inventive compounds also find use in the prevention of restenosis<br>
of blood vessels subject to traumas such as angioplasty and stenting.<br>
Detailed Description of Certain Preferred Embodiments of the<br>
Invention<br>
[0006] In recognition of the need to access and further explore the biological<br>
activity of novel derivatives of Hemiasterlin, and this class of peptides in general, the<br>
present invention provides novel peptide compounds, as described in more detail<br>
herein, which demonstrate antitumor activity. Thus, the compounds of the invention,<br>
and pharmaceutical compositions thereof, are useful for the treatment of cancer. In<br>
certain embodiments, the compounds of the present invention can be used for the<br>
treatment of diseases and disorders including, but not limited to prostate, breast,<br>
colon, bladder, cervical, skin, testicular, kidney, ovarian, stomach, brain, liver,<br>
pancreatic or esophageal cancer, lymphoma, leukemia and multiple myeloma. In<br>
certain other embodiments, the inventive compounds also find use in the prevention<br>
of restenosis of blood vessels subject to traumas such as angioplasty and stenting.<br>

[0070] Some of the foregoing compounds can comprise one or more asymmetric<br>
centers, and thus can exist in various isomeric forms, e.g., stereoisomers and/or<br>
diastereomers. It is to be understood that the invention encompasses every possible<br>
isomer such as geometric isomer, optical isomer, stereoisomer and tautomer based on<br>
asymmetric carbon, which can occur in the structures of the inventive compounds,<br>
and mixtures of such isomers, and is not limited to the specific stereochemistry shown<br>
for the compounds disclosed in the present specification. It will be further appreciated<br>
that the absolute stereochemistry of some of the compounds recited in the<br>
Exemplification herein has not been determined, and that when a stereochemistry was<br>
assigned for those compounds it is meant to be tentative and to indicate that a set of<br>
diastereomers exists for those compounds and/ot that a diastereomer was isolated in<br>
pure form. Thus, inventive compounds and pharmaceutical compositions thereof may<br>
be in the form of an individual enantiomer, diastereomer or geometric isomer, or may<br>
be in the form of a mixture of stereoisomers. In certain embodiments, the compounds<br>
of the invention are enantiopure compounds. In certain other embodiments, mixtures<br>
of stereoisomers or diastereomers are provided.<br>
[0071] Furthermore, certain compounds, as described herein may have one or<br>
more double bonds that can exist as either the Z or E isomer, unless otherwise<br>
indicated. The invention additionally encompasses the compounds as individual<br>
isomers substantially free of other isomers and alternatively, as mixtures of various<br>
isomers, e.g., racemic mixtures of stereoisomers. The invention also encompasses<br>
tautomers of specific compounds as described above. In addition to the above-<br>
mentioned compounds per se, this invention also encompasses pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivatives of these compounds and compositions comprising one or more<br>
compounds of the invention and one or more pharmaceutically acceptable excipients<br>
or additives.<br>
[0072] Compounds of the invention may be prepared by crystallization of<br>
compound of formula (I) under different conditions and may exist as one or a<br>
combination of polymorphs of compound of general formula (I) forming part of this<br>
invention. For example, different polymorphs may be identified and/or prepared using<br>
different solvents, or different mixtures of solvents for recrystallization; by<br>
performing crystallizations at different temperatures; or by using various modes of<br>
cooling, ranging from very fast to very slow cooling during crystallizations.<br>
Polymorphs may also be obtained by heating or melting the compound followed by<br>
gradual or fast cooling. The presence of polymorphs may be determined by solid<br>
probe NMR spectroscopy, IR spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, powder<br>
X-ray diffractogram and/or other techniques. Thus, the present invention<br>
encompasses inventive compounds, their derivatives, their tautomeric forms, their<br>
stereoisomers, their polymorphs, their pharmaceutically acceptable salts their<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable solvates and pharmaceutically acceptable compositions<br>
containing them.<br>
[0073] 2) Compounds and Definitions<br>
[0074] As discussed above, this invention provides novel compounds with a range<br>
of biological properties. Compounds of this invention have biological activities<br>
relevant for the treatment of diseases or other disorders such as proliferative diseases,<br>
including, but not limited to cancer. In certain other embodiments, the inventive<br>
compounds also find use in the prevention of restenosis of blood vessels subject to<br>
traumas such as angioplasty and stenting.<br>
[0075] Compounds of this invention include those specifically set forth above and<br>
described herein, and are illustrated in part by the various classes, subgenera and<br>
species disclosed elsewhere herein.<br>
[0076] Additionally, the present invention provides pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
derivatives of the inventive compounds, and methods of treating a subject using these<br>
compounds, pharmaceutical compositions thereof, or either of these in combination<br>
with one or more additional therapeutic agents. The phrase, "pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivative", as used herein, denotes any pharmaceutically acceptable salt,<br>
ester, or salt of such ester, of such compound, or any other adduct or derivative which,<br>
upon administration to a patient, is capable of providing (directly or indirectly) a<br>
compound as otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
Pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives thus include among others pro-drugs. A pro-<br>
drug is a derivative of a compound, usually with significantly reduced<br>
pharmacological activity, which contains an additional moiety which is susceptible to<br>
removal in vivo yielding the parent molecule as the pharmacologically active species.<br>
An example of a pro-drug is an ester which is cleaved in vivo to yield a compound of<br>
interest. Pro-drugs of a variety of compounds, and materials and methods for<br>
derivatizing the parent compounds to create the pro-drugs, are known and may be<br>
adapted to the present invention. Certain exemplary pharmaceutical compositions and<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivatives will be discussed in more detail herein below.<br>
[0077] Numerous suitable prodrug moieties, and information concerning their<br>
selection, synthesis and use are well known in the art. Examples of prodrug moieties<br>
of interest include, among others, prodrug moieties that can be attached to primary or<br>
secondary amine-containing functionalities. Examples of such prodrug moieties<br>
include the following:<br>
Other examples of prodrug moieties of interest include prodrug moieties that can be<br>
attached to hydroxyl-containing functionalities. Such prodrug moieties a well-known<br>
in the art, and will be readily identified by a person skilled in the relevant art. The<br>
present invention encompasses any prodrug form of the compounds described herein.<br>
[0078] Certain compounds of the present invention, and definitions of specific<br>
functional groups are also described in more detail below. For purposes of this<br>
invention, the chemical elements are identified in accordance with the Periodic Table<br>
of the Elements, CAS version, Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 75th Ed., inside<br>
cover, and specific functional groups are generally defined as described therein.<br>
Additionally, general principles of organic chemistry, as well as specific functional<br>
moieties and reactivity, are described in "Organic Chemistry", Thomas Sorrell,<br>
University Science Books, Sausalito: 1999, the entire contents of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference. Furthermore, it will be appreciated by one of<br>
ordinary skill in the art that the synthetic methods, as described herein, utilize a<br>
variety of protecting groups. By the term "protecting group", as used herein, it is<br>
meant that a particular functional moiety, e.g., 0, S, or N, is temporarily blocked so<br>
that a reaction can be carried out selectively at another reactive site in a<br>
multifunctional compound. In preferred embodiments, a protecting group reacts<br>
selectively in good yield to give a protected substrate that is stable to the projected<br>
reactions; the protecting group must be selectively removed in good yield by readily<br>
available, preferably nontoxic reagents that do not attack the other functional groups;<br>
the protecting group forms an easily separable derivative (more preferably without the<br>
generation of new stereogenic centers); and the protecting group has a minimum of<br>
additional functionality to avoid further sites of reaction. As detailed herein, oxygen,<br>
sulfur, nitrogen and carbon protecting groups may be utilized. For example, in certain<br>
embodiments, as detailed herein, certain exemplary oxygen protecting groups are<br>
utilized. These oxygen protecting groups include, but are not limited to methyl ethers,<br>
substituted methyl ethers (e.g, MOM (methoxymethyl ether), MTM<br>
(methylthiomethyl ether), BOM (benzyloxymethyl ether), PMBM (p-<br>
methoxybenzyloxymethyl ether), to name a few), substituted ethyl ethers, substituted<br>
benzyl ethers, silyl ethers (e.g, TMS (trimethylsilyl ether), TES (triethylsilylether),<br>
TIPS (triisopropylsilyl ether), TBDMS (t-butyldimethylsilyl ether), tribenzyl silyl<br>
ether, TBDPS (t-butyldiphenyl silyl ether), to name a few), esters (e.g., formate,<br>
acetate, benzoate (Bz), trifluoroacetate, dichloroacetate, to name a few), carbonates,<br>
cyclic acetals and ketals. In certain other exemplary embodiments, nitrogen<br>
protecting groups are utilized. These nitrogen protecting groups include, but are not<br>
limited to, carbamates (including methyl, ethyl and substituted ethyl carbamates (e.g,<br>
Troc), to name a few) amides, cyclic imide derivatives, N-Alkyl and N-Aryl amines,<br>
imine derivatives, and enamine derivatives, to name a few. Certain other exemplary<br>
protecting groups are detailed herein, however, it will be appreciated that the present<br>
invention is not intended to be limited to these protecting groups; rather, a variety of<br>
additional equivalent protecting groups can be readily identified using the above<br>
criteria and utilized in the present invention. Additionally, a variety of protecting<br>
groups are described in "Protective Groups in Organic Synthesis" Third Ed. Greene,<br>
T.W. and Wuts, P.G., Eds., John Wiley &amp; Sons, New York: 1999, the entire contents<br>
of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
[0079] It will be appreciated that the compounds, as described herein, may be<br>
substituted with any number of substituents or functional moieties. In general, the<br>
term "substituted" whether preceded by the term "optionally" or not, and substituents<br>
contained in formulas of this invention, refer to the replacement of hydrogen radicals<br>
in a given structure with the radical of a specified substituent. When more than one<br>
position in any given structure may be substituted with more than one substituent<br><br>
selected from a specified group, the substituent may be either the same or different at<br>
every position. As used herein, the term "substituted" is contemplated to include all<br>
permissible substituents of organic compounds. In a broad aspect, the permissible<br>
substituents include acyclic and cyclic, branched and unbranched, carbocyclic and<br>
heterocyclic, aromatic and nonaromatic substituents of organic compounds. For<br>
purposes" of this invention, heteroatoms such as nitrogen may have hydrogen<br>
substituents and/or any permissible substituents of organic compounds described<br>
herein which satisfy the valencies of the heteroatoms. Furthermore, this invention is<br>
not intended to be limited in any manner by the permissible substituents of organic<br>
compounds. Combinations of substituents and variables envisioned by this invention<br>
are preferably those that result in the formation of stable compounds useful in the<br>
treatment, for example of cancer. The term "stable", as used herein, preferably refers<br>
to compounds which possess stability sufficient to allow manufacture and which<br>
maintain the integrity of the compound for a sufficient period of time to be detected<br>
and preferably for a sufficient period of time to be useful for the purposes detailed<br>
herein.<br>
[0080] The term "aliphatic", as used herein, includes both saturated and<br>
unsaturated, straight chain (i.e., unbranched) or branched aliphatic hydrocarbons,<br>
which are optionally substituted with one or more functional groups. As will be<br>
appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, "aliphatic" is intended herein to<br>
include, but is not limited to, alkyl, alkenyl, alkynyl moieties. Thus, as used herein,<br>

the properties of aliphatic and cyclic compounds and include but are not limited to<br>
cyclic, or polycyclic aliphatic hydrocarbons and bridged cycloalkyl compounds,<br>
which are optionally substituted with one or more functional groups. As will be<br>
appreciated by one of ordinary skill in the art, "alicyclic" is intended herein to<br>
include, but is not limited to, cycloalkyl, cycloalkenyl, and cycloalkynyl moieties,<br>
which are optionally substituted with one or more functional groups. Illustrative<br>
alicyclic groups thus include, but are not limited to, for example, cyclopropyl, -CH2-<br>
cyclopropyl, cyclobutyl, -CH2-cyclobutyl, cyclopentyl, -CH2-cyclopentyl-n,<br>
cyclohexyl, -CH2-cyclohexyl, cyclohexenylethyl, cyclohexanylethyl, norborbyl<br>
moieties and the like, which again, may bear one or more substituents.<br>
[0083] The term "alkoxy" (or "alkyloxy"), or "thioalkyl" as used herein refers to<br>

[0095] 3) Synthetic Methodology<br>
[0096] According to the present invention, any available techniques can be used<br>
to make or prepare the inventive compounds or compositions including them. For<br>
example, a variety of solution phase synthetic methods such as those discussed in<br>
detail below may be used. Alternatively or additionally, the inventive compounds<br>
may be prepared using any of a variety combinatorial techniques, parallel synthesis<br>
and/or solid phase synthetic methods known in the art.<br>
[0097] In one aspect, the present invention provides novel peptides having<br>
formula (I) as described above and in certain classes and subclasses herein. Examples<br>
of synthetic methods for preparing exemplary types of compounds of the invention<br>
are provided below, as detailed in Schemes 1-12, and in the Exemplification herein.<br>
It will be appreciated that the methods as described herein can be applied to each of<br>
the compounds as disclosed herein and equivalents thereof. Additionally, the reagents<br>
and starting materials are well known to those skilled in the art. Although the<br>
following schemes describe certain exemplary compounds, it will be appreciated that<br>
the use of alternate starting materials will yield other analogs of the invention. For<br>
example, compounds are described below where X1 and X2 are each C=O, R5 is<br>
hydrogen, R6 is tert-butyl and R7 is methyl; however, it will be appreciated that<br>
alternate starting materials and/or intermediates can be utilized to generate<br>
compounds where, for example, X1 and X2 may be independently C=O, CH2, SO2,<br>
and R5-R7 may represent moieties other than those depicted herein, such as alkyl,<br>
heteroalkyl, aryl, heteroaryl, etc. It will also be appreciated that any available<br>
techniques known in the art can be used to make the inventive compounds or<br>
compositions including them. A person of ordinary skill in the art will recognize that<br>
suitable synthetic methods are not limited to those depicted in Schemes 1-12 below,<br>
and that any suitable synthetic methods known in the art can be used to prepare the<br>
inventive compounds.<br>
[0098] In certain embodiments, the inventive compounds, have the general<br>
structure (I') as shown in Scheme 1, where R, R' and Q are aliphatic, heteroaliphatic,<br>
aryl or heteroaryl moieties. In preferred embodiments, R, R' and Q are moieties such<br>
as those described in classes and subclasses herein. Examples of preferred structures<br>
for R, R' and Q are depicted in Scheme 1.<br>
Scheme 1<br>
[0099] In certain embodiments, the inventive compounds belong to class (1a) and<br>
subclasses thereof, as described herein. Scheme 2 depicts the synthesis of exemplary<br>
compounds of this class (compounds of general structure 11). As shown in Scheme 2,<br>
the dipeptide core can be constructed, for example, from N-Boc-N-methyl-valinal (2)<br>
and N-Boc-tert-leucine (4). The N-terminal moiety of the compounds of the invention<br>
(R' in Scheme 1) may be provided by (S)-N-Boc-neo-phenylalanine (6). As depicted<br>
in Scheme 2, a variety of synthetic methods allow access to a variety of analogs, for<br>
example, carboxylic esters of general structure 7, carboxylic acid 8 or amides of<br>
general structure 11. The reader will appreciate that other synthetic methods known<br>
in the art can be used to prepare other derivatives.<br>
Scheme 2<br>
[0100] An exemplary synthetic approach for the preparation of intermediate 6<br>
is depicted in Scheme 3. The method afforded (S)-N-Boc-neo-phenylalanine (6) in<br>
20% overall yield.<br>
[0101] In certain other embodiments, the inventive compounds belong to class<br>
(1b) and subclasses thereof, as described herein. Schemes 4-6 depict the synthesis of<br>
exemplary types of compounds of this class (for example, Amine Esters, Amine<br>
Acids, Amine Amides and N-Acetyl Amine Amides of general structure 18, 20, 23,<br>
respectively as seen in Schemes 4; See also Amine Esters, Amine Acids, Amine<br>
Amides and N-Acetyl Amine Amides of general structure 25, 26 and 27, respectively<br>
in Scheme 5). In certain embodiments, R may be a nitrogen-containing heteroalkyl<br>
moiety (see Schemes 4 and 5) or an unsaturated oxygen-containing heteroalkyl<br>
moiety (see Scheme 6). Although Schemes 4-6 depict compounds comprising an N-<br>
terminal moiety derived from (S)-N-Boc-neo-phenylalanine (6), a person of ordinary<br>
skill in the art would appreciate that a wide variety of organic moieties other than<br>
those described in Schemes 4-6 may be used to construct the compounds of the<br>
invention. Similarly, Schemes 4-6 recite compounds where the C-terminal moiety<br>
may be carboxylic esters, carboxylic acids or amides. It is to be understood that the<br>
scope of the invention is not limited to these compounds, but rattier encompasses<br>
derivatives and analogs of these compounds, or compounds obtained from different<br>
starting materials.<br>
[0102] In certain other embodiments, the inventive compounds belong to class<br>
(Ic) and subclasses thereof, as described herein. Schemes 7-10 depict the synthesis of<br>
exemplary types of compounds of this class (for example Amine Esters, Amine Acids<br>
and Amine Amides of general structure 42, 43 and 45, respectively, as seen in<br>
Scheme 7). In certain embodiments, the compounds of the invention comprise a<br>
nitrogen-containing heterocyclic N-terminal moiety. For example, the heterocyclic<br>
moiety may be a piperidine ring (Schemes 7, 8 and 9) or a thiazolidine ring (Scheme<br>
10). Examples of other suitable moieties are described in the Examplification herein,<br>
or will be apparent to the person of ordinary skill in the art. As dicussed above, R may<br>
be a nitrogen-containing heteroalkyl moiety (Scheme 7) or an unsaturated alkyl<br>
moiety (Schemes 8,9 and 10).<br>
[0103] In certain other embodiments, the inventive compounds belong to class<br>
(Id) and subclasses thereof, as described herein. One skilled in the art would<br>
appreciate that the exemplary heterocyclic starting materials described in Schemes 7-<br>
10, that are used in the preparation of compounds of class (Ic) (namely compounds<br>
38, 60 or 65) could be substituted for acyclic a-amino acid moieties to access<br>
compounds of class (Id), as illustrated in Scheme 11 below.<br>
[0104] For example, reaction of diethylglycine (72) with amine HC1 salt 49<br>
gives the ^-terminal gem-diethyl ethyl ester 73, or the corresponding carboxylic acid<br>
74, after hydrolysis under suitable conditions (Scheme 12).<br>
[0105] It will be appreciated that each of the reactions described in Schemes<br>
2-12 above can be carried out using reagents and conditions as described for the<br>
synthesis of various types of exemplary compounds described above, or they may be<br>
modified using other available reagents or starting materials. For example, a variety<br>
of amide formation conditions, esterification, hydrolysis and aromatic nucleus<br>
functionalization conditions are well-known in the art and can be utilized in the<br>
method of the invention. See, generally, March, Advanced Organic Chemistry, 5th<br>
ed., John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2001; and "Comprehensive Organic Transformations, a<br>
guide to functional group preparations", Richard C. Larock, VCH publishers, 1999;<br>
the entire contents of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
[0106] As mentioned above, it will be appreciated that the invention is not<br>
limited in scope to the compounds recited herein. Synthetic strategies or starting<br>
materials other than those described herein may be used to prepare compounds of<br>
general structure (I). It will also be appreciated that each of the components/starting<br>
materials used in the synthesis of the compounds of the invention can be diversified<br>
either before synthesis or alternatively after the construction of the peptide construct.<br>
As used herein, the term "diversifying" or "diversify" means reacting an inventive<br>
compound, as defined herein, at one or more reactive sites to modify a functional<br>
moiety or to add a functional moiety. For example, where an aromatic ring is present<br>
in the compound, the aromatic ring can be diversified (prior to or after reaction) to<br>
either add functionality (e.g., where hydrogen is present, a halogen or other<br>
functionality can be added) or to modify functionality (e.g., where a hydroxyl group is<br>
present on the aromatic ring, the aromatic ring can be diversified by reacting with a<br>
reagent to protect the hydroxyl group, or to convert it into an aliphatic or<br>
heteroaliphatic moiety). Described generally below are a variety of schemes to assist<br>
the reader in the synthesis of a variety of analogues, either by diversification of the<br>
intermediate components or by diversification of the peptide construct.<br>
[0107] In certain embodiments, the preparation of chemically diverse<br>
derivatives may be achieved by diversifying the C-terminal moiety of the compounds.<br>
For example, where the C-terminal moiety is a carboxylic acid, examples of chemical<br>
transformations suitable to achieve such derivatization include, but are not limited to,<br>
reduction to the corresponding aldehyde or alcohol, amidation, Wittig reaction,<br>
decarboxylation, esterification, addition of nucleophiles, conversion to ketones,<br>
imines, hydrazones, azides, etc... Examples of such transformations are depicted in<br>
Schemes 12 and 13. One skilled in the art will recognize that possible chemical<br>
transformations suitable to achieve diversification of the compounds of the invention<br>
are not limited to those depicted in Schemes 1-13. Rather, any suitable synthetic<br>
methods known in the art can be used to achieve desired chemical transformations.<br>

[0125] Pharmaceutical Compositions<br>
[0126] As discussed above this invention provides novel compounds that have<br>
biological properties useful for the treatment of cancer. In certain embodiments,<br>
certain of the compounds as described herein act as inhibitors of tumor growth and<br>
thus are useful in the treatment of cancer and in the inhibition of tumor growth and in<br>
the killing of cancer cells. In certain embodiments, the inventive compounds are<br>
useful for the treatment of solid tumors or non-solid tumors. In still other<br>
embodiments of interest, the inventive compounds are useful for the treatment of<br>
glioblastoma, retinoblastoma, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon and rectal cancer,<br>
leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer (including, but not limited to small cell lung<br>
cancer), melanoma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian cancer,<br>
pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and gastric cancer, to name a few. The inventive<br>
compounds also find use in the prevention of restenosis of blood vessels subject to<br>
traumas such as angioplasty and stenting.<br>
[0127] Accordingly, in another aspect of the present invention, pharmaceutical<br>
compositions are provided, which comprise any one of the compounds described<br>
herein (or a prodrug, pharmaceutically acceptable salt or other pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable derivative thereof), and optionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
carrier. In certain embodiments, the compounds are capable of inhibiting the growth<br>
of or killing cancer cells. In certain embodiments, these compositions optionally<br>
further comprise one or more additional therapeutic agents. Alternatively, a<br>
compound of this invention may be administered to a patient in need thereof in<br>
combination with the administration of one or more other therapeutic agents. For<br>
example, additional therapeutic agents for conjoint administration or inclusion in a<br>
pharmaceutical composition with a compound of this invention may be a cytotoxic<br>
agent or anticancer agent approved for the treatment of cancer, as discussed in more<br>
detail herein, or it may be any one of a number of agents undergoing approval in the<br>
Food and Drug Administration that ultimately obtain approval for the treatment of an<br>
immune disorder or cancer. It will also be appreciated that certain of the compounds<br>
of present invention can exist in free form for treatment, or where appropriate, as a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof. According to the present invention, a<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable derivative includes, but is not limited to,<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable salts, esters, salts of such esters, or a prodrug or other<br>
adduct or derivative of a compound of this invention which upon administration to a<br>
patient in need is capable of providing, directly or indirectly, a compound as<br>
otherwise described herein, or a metabolite or residue thereof.<br>
[0128] As used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salt" refers to<br>
those salts which are, within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in<br>
contact with the tissues of humans and lower animals with little or no undue toxicity,<br>
irritation, allergic response and the like, and are commensurate with a reasonable<br>
benefit/risk ratio. Pharmaceutically acceptable salts of amines, carboxylic acids, and<br>
other types of compounds, are well known in the art. For example, S.M. Berge, et al.<br>
describe pharmaceutically acceptable salts in detail in J. Pharmaceutical Sciences, 66:<br>
1-19 (1977), incorporated herein by reference. The salts can be prepared in situ<br>
during the final isolation and purification of the compounds of the invention, or<br>
separately by reacting a free base or free acid function with a suitable reagent, as<br>
described generally below. For example, a free base function can be reacted with a<br>
suitable acid. Furthermore, where the compounds of the invention carry an acidic<br>
moiety, suitable pharmaceutically acceptable salts thereof may, include metal salts<br>
such as alkali metal salts, e.g. sodium or potassium salts; and alkaline earth metal<br>
salts, e.g. calcium or magnesium salts. Examples of pharmaceutically acceptable,<br>
nontoxic acid addition salts are salts of an amino group formed with inorganic acids<br>
such as hydrochloric acid, hydrobromic acid, phosphoric acid, sulfuric acid and<br>
perchloric acid or with organic acids such as acetic acid, oxalic acid, maleic acid,<br>
tartaric acid, citric acid, succinic acid or malonic acid or by using other methods used<br>
in the art such as ion exchange. Other pharmaceutically acceptable salts include<br>
adipate, alginate, ascorbate, aspartate, benzenesulfonate, benzoate, bisulfate, borate,<br>
butyrate, camphorate, camphorsulfonate, citrate, cyclopentanepropionate, digluconate,<br>
dodecylsulfate, ethanesulfonate, formate, fumarate, glucoheptonate,<br>
glycerophosphate, gluconate, hernisulfate, heptanoate, hexanoate, hydroiodide, 2-<br>
hydroxy-ethanesulfonate, lactobionate, lactate, laurate, lauryl sulfate, malate, maleate,<br>
malonate, methanesulfonate, 2-naphthalenesulfonate, nicotinate, nitrate, oleate,<br>
oxalate, palniitate, pamoate, pectinate, persulfate, 3-phenylpropionate, phosphate,<br>
picrate, pivalate, propionate, stearate, succinate, sulfate, tartrate, thiocyanate, p-<br>
toluenesulfonate, trifluoroacetate, undecanoate, valerate salts, and the like.<br>
Representative alkali or alkaline earth metal salts include sodium, lithium, potassium,<br>
calcium, magnesium, and the like. Further pharmaceutically acceptable salts include,<br>
when appropriate, nontoxic ammonium, quaternary ammonium, and amine cations<br>
formed using counterions such as halide, hydroxide, carboxylate, sulfate, phosphate,<br>
nitrate, loweralkyl sulfonate and aryl sulfonate.<br>
[0129] Additionally, as used herein, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable<br>
ester" refers to esters that hydrolyze in vivo and include those that break down readily<br>
in the human body to leave the parent compound or a salt thereof. Suitable ester<br>
groups include, for example, those derived from pharmaceutically acceptable aliphatic<br>
carboxylic acids, particularly alkanoic, alkenoic, cycloalkanoic and alkanedioic acids,<br>
in which each alkyl or alkenyl moeity advantageously has not more than 6 carbon<br>
atoms. Examples of particular esters include formates, acetates, propionates,<br>
butyrates, acrylates and ethylsuccinates.<br>
[0130] Furthermore, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable prodrugs" as used<br>
herein refers to those prodrugs of the compounds of the present invention which are,<br>
within the scope of sound medical judgment, suitable for use in contact with the<br>
issues of humans and lower animals with undue toxicity, irritation, allergic response,<br>
and the like, commensurate with a reasonable benefit/risk ratio, and effective for their<br>
intended use, as well as the zwitterionic forms, where possible, of the compounds of<br>
the invention. The term "prodrug" refers to compounds that are rapidly transformed<br>
in vivo to yield the parent compound of the above formula, for example by hydrolysis<br>
in blood. A thorough discussion is provided in T. Higuchi and V. Stella, Pro-drugs as<br>
Novel Delivery Systems, Vol. 14 of the A.C.S. Symposium Series, and in Edward B.<br>
Roche, ed., Bioreversible Carriers in Drug Design, American Pharmaceutical<br>
Association and Pergamon Press, 1987, both of which are incorporated herein by<br>
reference.<br>
[0131] As described above, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present<br>
invention additionally comprise a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier, which, as used<br>
herein, includes any and all solvents, diluents, or other liquid vehicle, dispersion or<br>
suspension aids, surface active agents, isotonic agents, thickening or emulsifying<br>
agents, preservatives, solid binders, lubricants and the like, as suited to the particular<br>
dosage form desired. Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, Sixteenth Edition, E. W.<br>
Martin (Mack Publishing Co., Easton, Pa., 1980) discloses various carriers used in<br>
formulating pharmaceutical compositions and known techniques for the preparation<br>
thereof. Except insofar as any conventional carrier medium is incompatible with the<br>
compounds of the invention, such as by producing any undesirable biological effect or<br>
otherwise interacting in a deleterious manner with any other components) of the<br>
pharmaceutical composition, its use is contemplated to be within the scope of this<br>
invention. Some examples of materials which can serve as pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carriers include, but are not limited to, sugars such as lactose, glucose and<br>
sucrose; starches such as corn starch and potato starch; cellulose and its derivatives<br>
such as sodium carboxymethyl cellulose, ethyl cellulose and cellulose acetate;<br>
powdered tragacanth; malt; gelatine; talc; excipients such as cocoa butter and<br>
suppository waxes; oils such as peanut oil, cottonseed oil; safflower oil, sesame oil;<br>
olive oil; corn oil and soybean oil; glycols; such as propylene glycol; esters such as<br>
ethyl oleate and ethyl laurate; agar; buffering agents such as magnesium hydroxide<br>
and aluminum hydroxide; alginic acid; pyrogenfree water; isotonic saline; Ringer's<br>
solution; ethyl alcohol, and phosphate buffer solutions, as well as other non-toxic<br>
compatible lubricants such as sodium lauryl sulfate and magnesium stearate, as well<br>
as coloring agents, releasing agents, coating agents, sweetening, flavoring and<br>
perfuming agents, preservatives and antioxidants can also be present in the<br>
composition, according to the judgment of the formulator.<br>
[0132] Uses and Formulations of Compounds of the Invention<br>
[0133] As described in more detail herein, in general, the present invention<br>
provides compounds useful for the treatment of cancer and proliferative disorders.<br>
[0134] As discussed above, certain of the compounds as described herein act<br>
as inhibitors of tumor growth and thus are useful in the treatment of cancer and in the<br>
inhibition of tumor growth and in the killing of cancer cells. The invention further<br>
provides a method for inhibiting tumor growth and/or tumor metastasis. The method<br>
involves the administration of a therapeutically effective amount of the compound or<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable derivative thereof to a subject (including, but not<br>
limited to a human or animal) in need of it. In certain embodiments, the inventive<br>
compounds are useful for the treatment of solid tumors or non-solid tumors. In still<br>
other embodiments of interest, the inventive compounds are useful for the treatment<br>
of glioblastoma, retinoblastoma, breast cancer, cervical cancer, colon and rectal<br>
cancer, leukemia, lymphoma, lung cancer (including, but not limited to small cell lung<br>
cancer), melanoma, multiple myeloma, non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, ovarian cancer,<br>
pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer and gastric cancer, to name a few.<br>
[0135] As described in more detail herein, in general, the present invention<br>
provides compounds useful for the treatment of cancer, particularly solid and non-<br>
solid tumors. Specifically, certain compounds of the invention have been shown to<br>
inhibit the growth of certain tumor cell lines in vitro, as described in more detail<br>
herein, and are useful for the treatment of cancer, including solid and non-solid<br>
tumors.<br>
[0136] As discussed above, the inventive compounds also find use in the<br>
prevention of restenosis of blood vessels subject to traumas such as angioplasty and<br>
stenting. For example, it is contemplated that the compounds of the invention will be<br>
useful as a coating for implanted medical devices, such as tubings, shunts, catheters,<br>
artificial implants, pins, electrical implants such as pacemakers, and especially for<br>
arterial or venous stents, including balloon-expandable stents. In certain embodiments<br>
inventive compounds may be bound to an implantable medical device, or<br>
alternatively, may be passively adsorbed to the surface of the implantable device. In<br>
certain other embodiments, the inventive compounds may be formulated to be<br>
contained within, or, adapted to release by a surgical or medical device or implant,<br>
such as, for example, stents, sutures, indwelling catheters, prosthesis, and the like.<br>
[0137] In certain exemplary embodiments, the inventive compounds may be<br>
used as coating for stents. A stent is typically an open tubular structure that has a<br>
pattern (or patterns) of apertures extending from the outer surface of the stent to the<br>
lumen. It is commonplace to make stents of biocompatible metallic materials, with the<br>
patterns cut on the surface with a laser machine. The stent can be electro-polished to<br>
minimize surface irregularities since these irregularities can trigger an adverse<br>
biological response. However, stents may still stimulate foreign body reactions that<br>
result in thrombosis or restenosis. To avoid these complications, a variety of stent<br>
coatings and compositions have been proposed in the prior art literature both to<br>
reduce the incidence of these complications or other complications and restore tissue<br>
function by itself or by delivering therapeutic compound to the lumen. For example,<br>
drugs having antiproliferative and anti-inflammatory activities have been evaluated as<br>
stent coatings, and have shown promise in preventing retenosis (See, for example,<br>
Presbitero P. et al., "Drug eluting stents do they make the difference?", Minerva<br>
Cardioangiol, 2002, 50(5):431-442; Ruygrok P.N. et al., "Rapamycin in<br>
cardiovascular medicine", Intern. Med. J., 2003,33(3):103-109; and Marx S.O. et aL,<br>
"Bench to bedside: the development of rapamycin and its application to stent<br>
restenosis", Circulation, 2001, 104(8):852-855, each of these references is<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety). Accordingly, without wishing to be<br>
bound to any particular theory, Applicant proposes that the inventive compounds,<br>
having antiproliferative effects, can be used as stent coatings and/or in stent drug<br>
delivery devices, inter alia for the prevention of restenosis. A variety of compositions<br>
and methods related to stent coating and/or local stent drug delivery for preventing<br>
restenosis are known in the art (see, for example, U.S. Patent Nos.: 6,517,889;<br>
6,273,913; 6,258,121; 6,251,136; 6,248,127; 6,231,600; 6,203,551; 6,153,252;<br>
6,071,305; 5,891,507; 5,837,313 and published U.S. patent application No.:<br>
US2001/0027340, each of which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
For example, stents may be coated with polymer-drug conjugates by dipping the stent<br>
in polymer-drug solution or spraying the stent with such a solution. In certain<br>
embodiment, suitable materials for the implantable device include biocompatible and<br>
nontoxic materials, and may be chosen from the metals such as nickel-titanium alloys,<br>
steel, or biocompatible polymers, hydrogels, polyurethanes, polyethylenes,<br>
ethylenevinyl acetate copolymers, etc. In certain embodiments, the inventive<br>
compound, is coated onto a stent for insertion into an artery or vein following balloon<br>
angioplasty.<br>
[0138] The invention may be described therefore, in certain broad aspects as a<br>
method of inhibiting arterial restenosis or arterial occlusion following vascular trauma<br>
comprising administering to a subject in need thereof, a composition comprising an<br>
inventive compound conjugated to a suitable polymer or polymeric material. In the<br>
practice of the method, the subject may be a coronary bypass, vascular surgery, organ<br>
transplant or coronary or any other arterial angioplasty patient, for example, and the<br>
composition may be administered directly, intravenously, or even coated on a stent to<br>
be implanted at the sight of vascular trauma.<br>
[0139] In another aspect, the invention encompasses implants and surgical or<br>
medical devices, including stents and grafts, coated with or otherwise constructed to<br>
contain and/or release any of the inventive compounds disclosed herein. In certain<br>
embodiments, the compounds have antiproliferative activity. In certain other<br>
embodiments, the compounds inhibit smooth muscle cell proliferation. Representative<br>
examples of the 'inventive implants and surgical or medical devices include<br>
cardiovascular devices (e.g., implantable venous catheters, venous ports, tunneled<br>
venous catheters, chronic infusion lines or ports, including hepatic artery infusion<br>
catheters, pacemaker wires, implantable defibrillators); neurologic/neurosurgical<br>
devices (e.g., ventricular peritoneal shunts, ventricular atrial shunts, nerve stimulator<br>
devices, dural patches and implants to prevent epidural fibrosis post-larninectomy,<br>
devices for continuous subarachnoid infusions); gastrointestinal devices (e.g., chronic<br>
indwelling catheters, feeding tubes, portosystemic shunts, shunts for ascites,<br>
peritoneal implants for drug delivery, peritoneal dialysis catheters, implantable<br>
meshes for hernias, suspensions or solid implants to prevent surgical adhesions,<br>
including meshes); genitourinary devices (e.g., uterine implants, including intrauterine<br>
devices (lUDs) and devices to prevent endometrial hyperplasia, fallopian tubal<br>
implants, including reversible sterilization devices, fallopian tubal stents, artificial<br>
sphincters and periurethral implants for incontinence, ureteric stents, chronic<br>
indwelling catheters, bladder augmentations, or wraps or splints for vasovasostomy);<br>
phthalmologic implants (e.g., multino implants and other implants for neovascular<br>
glaucoma, drug eluting contact lenses for pterygiums, splints for failed<br>
dacrocystalrhinostomy, drug eluting contact lenses for corneal neovascularity,<br>
implants for diabetic retinopathy, drug eluting contact lenses for high risk corneal<br>
transplants); otolaryngology devices (e.g., ossicular implants, Eustachian tube splints<br>
or stents for glue ear or chronic otitis as an alternative to transtempanic drains); plastic<br>
surgery implants (e.g., prevention of fibrous contracture in response to gel- or saline-<br>
containing breast implants in the subpectoral or subglandular approaches or post-<br>
mastectomy, or chin implants), and orthopedic implants (e.g., cemented orthopedic<br>
prostheses).<br>
[0140] Implants and other surgical or medical devices may be coated with (or<br>
otherwise adapted to release) compositions of the present invention in a variety of<br>
manners, including for example: (a) by directly affixing to the implant or device an<br>
inventive compound or composition (e.g., by either spraying the implant or device<br>
with a polymer/drug film, or by dipping the implant or device into a polymer/drug<br>
solution, or by other covalent or noncovalent means); (b) by coating the implant or<br>
device with a substance such as a hydrogel which will in turn absorb the inventive<br>
compound or composition; (c) by interweaving inventive compound- or composition-<br>
coated thread (or the polymer itself formed into a thread) into the implant or device;<br>
(d) by inserting the implant or device into a sleeve or mesh which is comprised of or<br>
coated with an inventive compound or composition; (e) constructing the implant or<br>
device itself with an inventive compound or composition; or (f) by otherwise adapting<br>
the implant or device to release the inventive compound. In certain embodiments, the<br>
composition should firmly adhere to the implant or device during storage and at the<br>
time of insertion. The inventive compound or composition should also preferably not<br>
degrade during storage, prior to insertion, or when warmed to body temperature after<br>
insertion inside the body (if this is required). In addition, it should preferably coat the.<br>
implant or device smoothly and evenly, with a uniform distribution of inventive<br>
compound, while not changing the stent contour. Within preferred embodiments of<br>
the invention, the inventive implant or device should provide a uniform, predictable,<br>
prolonged release of the inventive compound or composition into the tissue<br>
surrounding the implant or device once it has been deployed. For vascular stents, in<br>
addition to the above properties, the composition should not render the stent<br>
thrombogenic (causing blood clots to form), or cause significant turbulence in blood<br>
flow (more than the stent itself would be expected to cause if it was uncoated).<br>
[0141] In the case of stents, a wide variety of stents may be developed to<br>
contain and/or release the inventive compounds or compositions provided herein,<br>
including esophageal stents, gastrointestinal stents, vascular stents, biliary stents,<br>
colonic stents, pancreatic stents, ureteric and urethral stents, lacrimal stents,<br>
Eustachian tube stents, fallopian tube stents and tracheal/bronchial stents (See, for<br>
example, U.S. Patent No.: 6,515,016, the entire contents of which are incorporated<br>
herein by reference). Stents may be readily obtained from commercial sources, or<br>
constructed in accordance with well-known techniques. Representative examples of<br>
stents include those described in U.S. Pat. No. 4,768,523, entitled "Hydrogel<br>
Adhesive"; U.S. Pat. No. 4,776,337, entitled "Expandable Intraluminal Graft, and<br>
Method and Apparatus for Implanting and Expandable Intraluminal Graft"; U.S. Pat.<br>

Applications"; U.S. Pat. No. 5,147,370, entitled "Nitinol Stent for Hollow Body<br>
Conduits"; U.S. Pat. No. 5,176,626, entitled "Indwelling Stent"; U.S. Pat. No.<br>

Disease in Hollow Tubular Organs and Other Tissue Lumens."<br>
[0142] As discussed above, the stent coated with (or otherwise adapted to<br>
release) compositions of the present invention may be used to eliminate a vascular<br>
obstruction and prevent restenosis and/or reduce the rate of restenosis. Within other<br>
aspects of the present invention, stents coated with (or otherwise adapted to release)<br>
compositions of the present invention are provided for expanding the lumen of a body<br>
passageway. Specifically, a stent having a generally tubular structure, and a surface<br>
coated with (or otherwise adapted to release) an inventive compound or composition<br>
may be inserted into the passageway, such that the passageway is expanded. In certain<br>
embodiments, the stent coated with (or otherwise adapted to release) compositions of<br>
the present invention may be used to eliminate a biliary, gastrointestinal, esophageal,<br>
tracheal/bronchial, urethral or vascular obstruction.<br>
[0143] In another aspect of the invention, methods for the treatment of cancer<br>
are provided comprising administering a therapeutically effective amount of a<br>
compound of formula (I), as described herein, to a subject in need thereof. In certain<br>
embodiments, the inventive compounds are useful for the treatment of solid and non-<br>
solid tumors. It will be appreciated that the compounds and compositions, according<br>
to the method of the present invention, may be administered using any amount and<br>
any route of administration effective for the treatment of cancer. Thus, the expression<br>
"effective amount" as used herein, refers to a sufficient amount of agent to kill or<br>
inhibit the growth of tumor cells, or refers to a sufficient amount to reduce the growth<br>
of tumor cells. The exact amount required will vary from subject to subject,<br>
depending on the species, age, and general condition of the subject, the severity of the<br>
infection, the particular anticancer agent, its mode of administration, and the like.<br>
The compounds of the invention are preferably formulated in dosage unit form for<br>
ease of administration and uniformity of dosage. The expression "dosage unit form"<br>
as used herein refers to a physically discrete unit of therapeutic agent appropriate for<br>
the patient to be treated. It will be understood, however, that the total daily usage of<br>
the compounds and compositions of the present invention will be decided by the<br>
attending physician within the scope of sound medical judgment. The specific<br>
therapeutically effective dose level for any particular patient or organism will depend<br>
upon a variety of factors including the disorder being treated and the severity of the<br>
disorder; the activity of the specific compound employed; the specific composition<br>
employed; the age, body weight, general health, sex and diet of the patient; the time of<br>
administration, route of administration, and rate of excretion of the specific compound<br>
employed; the duration of the treatment; drugs used in combination or coincidental<br>
with the specific compound employed; and like factors well known in the medical arts<br>
(see, for example, Goodman and Gilman's, "The Pharmacological Basis of<br>
Therapeutics", Tenth Edition, A. Gilman, J.Hardman and L. Limbird, eds., McGraw-<br>
Hill Press, 155-173,2001, which is incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
[0144] In certain other embodiments, methods are provided for using the<br>
inventive implants and other surgical or medical devices coated with (or otherwise<br>
adapted to release) compounds and compositions of the present invention. In certain<br>
embodiments, methods are provided for preventing restenosis, comprising inserting a<br>
stent into an obstructed blood vessel, the stent having a generally tubular structure, the<br>
surface of the structure being coated with (or otherwise adapted to release) an<br>
inventive compound or composition, such that the obstruction is eliminated and the<br>
inventive compound or composition is delivered in amounts effective to prevent<br>
restenosis and/or reduce the rate of restenosis. In other embodiments, methods are<br>
provided for preventing restenosis, comprising inserting a stent into an obstructed<br>
blood vessel, the stent having a generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure<br>
being coated with (or otherwise adapted to release) an inventive compound or<br>
composition, such that the obstruction is eliminated and the inventive compound or<br>
composition is delivered in amounts effective to inhibit smooth muscle cell<br>

[0145] Within other aspects of the present invention, methods are provided for<br>
expanding the lumen of a body passageway, comprising inserting a stent into the<br>
passageway, the stent having a generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure<br>
being coated with (or otherwise adapted to release) an inventive compound or<br>
composition, such that the passageway is expanded. In certain embodiments, the<br>
lumen of a body passageway is expanded in order to eliminate a biliary,<br>
gastrointestinal, esophageal, tracheal/bronchial, urethral and/or vascular obstruction.<br>
[0146] In certain embodiments, methods are provided for eliminating biliary<br>
obstructions, comprising inserting a biliary stent into a biliary passageway, the stent<br>
having a generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure being coated with (or<br>
otherwise adapted to release) an inventive compound or composition, such that the<br>
biliary obstruction is eliminated. Briefly, tumor overgrowth of the common bile duct<br>
results in progressive cholestatic jaundice which is incompatible with life. Generally,<br>
the biliary system which drains bile from the liver into the duodenum is most often<br>
obstructed by (1) a tumor composed of bile duct cells (cholangiocarcinoma), (2) a<br>
tumor which invades the bile duct (e.g., pancreatic carcinoma), or (3) a tumor which<br>
exerts extrinsic pressure and compresses the bile duct (e.g, enlarged lymph nodes).<br>
Both primary biliary tumors, as well as other tumors which cause compression of the<br>
biliary tree may be treated utilizing stents Implants and other surgical or medical<br>
devices may be coated with (or otherwise adapted to release) compositions of the<br>
present invention. One example of primary biliary tumors are adenocarcinomas<br>
(which are also called Klatskin tumors when found at the bifurcation of the common<br>
hepatic duct). These tumors are also referred to as biliary carcinomas,<br>
choledocholangiocarcinomas, or adenocarcinomas of the biliary system. Benign<br>
tumors which affect the bile duct (e.g., adenoma of the biliary system), and, in rare<br>
cases, squamous cell carcinomas of the bile duct and adenocarcinomas of the<br>
gallbladder, may also cause compression of the biliary tree and therefore, result in<br>
biliary obstruction. Compression of the biliary tree is most commonly due to tumors<br>
of the liver and pancreas which compress and therefore obstruct the ducts. Most of the<br>
tumors from the pancreas arise from cells of the pancreatic ducts. This is a highly fatal<br>
form of cancer (5% of all cancer deaths; 26,000 new cases per year in the U.S.) with<br>
an average of 6 months survival and a 1 year survival rate of only 10%. When these<br>
tumors are located in the head of the pancreas they frequently cause biliary<br>
obstruction, and this detracts significantly from the quality of life of the patient. While<br>
all types of pancreatic tumors are generally referred to as "carcinoma of the pancreas"<br>
there are histologic subtypes including: adenocarcinoma, adenosquamous carcinoma,<br>
cystadenocarcinoma, and acinar cell carcinoma. Hepatic tumors, as discussed above,<br>
may also cause compression of the biliary tree, and therefore cause obstruction of the<br>
biliary ducts.<br>
[0147] In certain embodiments, a biliary stent is first inserted into a biliary<br>
passageway in one of several ways: from the top end by inserting a needle through the<br>
abdominal wall and through the liver (a percutaneous transhepatic cholangiogram or<br>
"PTC"); from the bottom end by cannulating the bile duct through an endoscope<br>
inserted through the mouth, stomach, and duodenum (an endoscopic retrograde<br>
cholangiogram or "ERCP"); or by direct incision during a surgical procedure. In<br>
certain embodiments, a preinsertion examination, PTC, ERCP, or direct visualization<br>
at the time of surgery is performed to determine the appropriate position for stent<br>
insertion. A guidewire is then advanced through the lesion, and over this a delivery<br>
catheter is passed to allow the stent to be inserted in its collapsed form. If the<br>
diagnostic exam was a PTC, the guidewire and delivery catheter is inserted via the<br>
abdominal wall, while if the original exam was an ERCP the stent may be placed via<br>
the mouth. The stent is then positioned under radiologic, endoscopic, or direct visual<br>
control taking particular care to place it precisely across the narrowing in the bile<br>
duct. The delivery catheter is then removed leaving the stent standing as a scaffolding<br>
which holds the bile duct open. A further cholangiogram may be performed to<br>
document that the stent is appropriately positioned.<br>
[0148] In certain embodiments, methods are provided for eliminating<br>
esophageal obstructions, comprising inserting an esophageal stent into an esophagus,<br>
the stent having a generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure being coated<br>
with (or otherwise adapted to release) an inventive compound or composition, such<br>
that the esophageal obstruction is eliminated. Briefly, the esophagus is the hollow<br>
tube which transports food and liquids from the mouth to the stomach. Cancer of the<br>
esophagus or invasion by cancer arising in adjacent organs (e.g., cancer of the<br>
stomach or lung) results in the inability to swallow food or saliva. In certain<br>
embodiments, a preinsertion examination, usually a barium swallow or endoscopy is<br>
performed in order to determine the appropriate position for stent insertion. A catheter<br>
or endoscope may then be positioned through the mouth, and a guidewire is advanced<br>
through the blockage. A stent delivery catheter is passed over the guidewire under<br>
radiologic or endoscopic control, and a stent is placed precisely across the narrowing<br>
in the esophagus. A post-insertion examination, usually a barium swallow x-ray, may<br>
be utilized to confirm appropriate positioning.<br>
[0149] In certain embodiments, methods are provided for eliminating colonic<br>
obstructions, comprising inserting a colonic stent into a colon, the stent having a<br>
generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure being coated with (or<br>
otherwise adapted to release) an inventive compound or composition, such that the<br>
colonic obstruction is eliminated. Briefly, the colon is the hollow tube which<br>
transports digested food and waste materials from the small intestines to the anus.<br>
Cancer of the rectum and/or colon or invasion by cancer arising in adjacent organs<br>
(e.g., cancer of the uterus, ovary, bladder) results in the inability to eliminate feces<br>
from the bowel. In certain embodiments, a preinsertion examination, usually a<br>
barium enema or colonoscopy is performed in order to determine the appropriate<br>
position for stent insertion. A catheter or endoscope may then be positioned through<br>
the anus, and a guidewire is advanced through the blockage. A stent delivery catheter<br>
is passed over the guidewire under radiologic or endoscopic control, and a stent is<br>
placed precisely across the narrowing in the colon or rectum. A post-insertion<br>
examination, usually a barium enema x-ray, may be utilized to confirm appropriate<br>
positioning.<br>
[0150] In certain embodiments, methods are provided for eliminating<br>
tracheal/bronchial obstructions, comprising inserting a tracheal/bronchial stent into a<br>
trachea or bronchi, the stent having a generally tubular structure, the surface of the<br>
structure being coated with (or otherwise adapted to release) an inventive compound<br>
or composition, such that the tracheal/bronchial obstruction is eliminated. Briefly, the<br>
trachea and bronchi are tubes which carry air from the mouth and nose to the lungs.<br>
Blockage of the trachea by cancer, invasion by cancer arising in adjacent organs (e.g.,<br>
cancer of the lung), or collapse of the trachea or bronchi due to chondromalacia<br>
(weakening of the cartilage rings) results in inability to breathe. In certain<br>
embodiments, preinsertion examination, usually an endoscopy, is performed in order<br>
to determine the appropriate position for stent insertion. A catheter or endoscope is<br>
then positioned through the mouth, and a guidewire advanced through the blockage. A<br>
delivery catheter is then passed over the guidewire in order to allow a collapsed stent<br>
to be inserted. The stent is placed under radiologic or endoscopic control in order to<br>
place it precisely across the narrowing. The delivery catheter may then be removed<br>
leaving the stent standing as a scaffold on its own. A post-insertion examination,<br>
usually a bronchoscopy may be utilized to confirm appropriate positioning.<br>
[0151] In certain embodiments, methods are provided for eliminating urethral<br>
obstructions, comprising inserting a urethral stent into a urethra, the stent having a<br>
generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure being coated with (or<br>
otherwise adapted to release) an inventive compound or composition, such that the<br>
urethral obstruction is eliminated. Briefly, the urethra is the tube which drains the<br>
bladder through the penis. Extrinsic narrowing of the urethra as it passes through the<br>
prostate, due to hypertrophy of the prostate, occurs in virtually every man over the age<br>
of 60 and causes progressive difficulty with urination. In certain embodiments, a<br>
preinsertion examination, usually an endoscopy or urethrogram is first performed in<br>
order to determine the appropriate position for stent insertion, which is above the<br>
external urinary sphincter at the lower end, and close to flush with the bladder neck at<br>
the upper end. An endoscope or catheter is then positioned through the penile opening<br>
and a guidewire advanced into the bladder. A delivery catheter is then passed over the<br>
guidewire in order to allow stent insertion. The delivery catheter is then removed, and<br>
the stent expanded into place. A post-insertion examination, usually endoscopy or<br>
retrograde urethrogram, may be utilized to confirm appropriate position.<br>
[0152] In certain embodiments, methods are provided for eliminating<br>
vascular obstructions, comprising inserting a vascular stent into a blood vessel, the<br>
stent having a generally tubular structure, the surface of the structure being coated<br>
with (or otherwise adapted to release) an inventive compound or composition, such<br>
that the vascular obstruction is eliminated. Briefly, stents may be placed in a wide<br>
array of blood vessels, both arteries and veins, to prevent recurrent stenosis at the site<br>
of failed angioplasties, to treat narrowings that would likely fail if treated with<br>
angioplasty, and to treat post-surgical narrowings {e.g., dialysis graft stenosis).<br>
Suitable sites include, but ar enot limited to, the iliac, renal, and coronary arteries, the<br>
superior vena cava, and in dialysis grafts. In certain embodiments, angiography is first<br>
performed in order to localize the site for placement of the stent. This is typically<br>
accomplished by injecting radiopaque contrast through a catheter inserted into an<br>
artery or vein as an x-ray is taken. A catheter may then be inserted either<br>
percutaneously or by surgery into the femoral artery, brachial artery, femoral vein, or<br>
brachial vein, and advanced into the appropriate blood vessel by steering it through<br>
the vascular system under fluoroscopic guidance. A stent may then be positioned<br>
across the vascular stenosis. A post-insertion angiogram may also be utilized in order<br>
to confirm appropriate positioning.<br>
[0153] Furthermore, after formulation with an appropriate pharmaceutically<br>
acceptable carrier in a desired dosage, the pharmaceutical compositions of this<br>
invention can be administered to humans and other animals orally, rectally,<br>
parenterally, intracisternally, intravaginally, intraperitoneally, topically (as by<br>
powders, ointments, or drops), bucally, as an oral or nasal spray, or the like,<br>
depending on the severity of the infection being treated. In certain embodiments, the<br>
compounds of the invention may be administered at dosage levels of about 0.001<br>
mg/kg to about 50 mg/kg, from about 0.01 mg/kg to about 25 mg/kg, or from about<br>
0.1 mg/kg to about 10 mg/kg of subject body weight per day, one or more times a day,<br>
to obtain the desired therapeutic effect. It will also be appreciated that dosages<br>
smaller than 0.001 mg/kg or greater than 50 mg/kg (for example 50-100 mg/kg) can<br>
be administered to a subject. In certain embodiments, compounds are administered<br>
orally or parenterally.<br>
[0154] Liquid dosage forms for oral administration include, but are not limited<br>
to, pharmaceutically acceptable emulsions, microemulsions, solutions, suspensions,<br>
syrups and elixirs. In addition to the active compounds, the liquid dosage forms may<br>
contain inert diluents commonly used in the art such as, for example, water or other<br>
solvents, solubilizing agents and emulsifiers such as ethyl alcohol, isopropyl alcohol,<br>
ethyl carbonate, ethyl acetate, benzyl alcohol, benzyl benzoate, propylene glycol, 1,3-<br>
butylene glycol, dimethylformamide, oils (in particular, cottonseed, groundnut, com,<br>
germ, olive, castor, and sesame oils), glycerol, tetrahydrofurfuryl alcohol,<br>
polyethylene glycols and fatty acid esters of sorbitan, and mixtures thereof. Besides<br>
inert diluents, the oral compositions can also include adjuvants such as wetting agents,<br>
emulsifying and suspending agents, sweetening, flavoring, and perfuming agents.<br>
[0155] Injectable preparations, for example, sterile injectable aqueous or<br>
oleaginous suspensions may be formulated according to the known art using suitable<br>
dispersing or wetting agents and suspending agents. The sterile injectable preparation<br>
may also be a sterile injectable solution, suspension or emulsion in a nontoxic<br>
parenterally acceptable diluent or solvent, for example, as a solution in 1,3-<br>
butanediol. Among the acceptable vehicles and solvents that may be employed are<br>
water, Ringer's solution, U.S.P. and isotonic sodium chloride solution. In addition,<br>
sterile, fixed oils are conventionally employed as a solvent or suspending medium.<br>
For this purpose any bland fixed oil can be employed including synthetic mono- or<br>
diglycerides. In addition, fatty acids such as oleic acid are used in the preparation of<br>
injectables.<br>
[0156] The injectable formulations can be sterilized, for example, by filtration<br>
through a bacterial-retaining filter, or by incorporating sterilizing agents in the form<br>
of sterile solid compositions which can be dissolved or dispersed in sterile water or<br>
other sterile injectable medium prior to use.<br>
[0157] In order to prolong the effect of a drug, it is often desirable to slow the<br>
absorption of the drug from subcutaneous or intramuscular injection. This may be<br>
accomplished by the use of a liquid suspension or crystalline or amorphous material<br>
with poor water solubility. The rate of absorption of the drug then depends upon its<br>
rate of dissolution that, in turn, may depend upon crystal size and crystalline form.<br>
Alternatively, delayed absorption of a parenterally administered drug form is<br>
accomplished by dissolving or suspending the drug in an oil vehicle. Injectable depot<br>
forms are made by forming microencapsule matrices of the drug in biodegradable<br>
polymers such as polylactide-polyglycolide. Depending upon the ratio of drug to<br>
polymer and the nature of the particular polymer employed, the rate of drug release<br>
can be controlled. Examples of other biodegradable polymers include<br>
(poly(orthoesters) and poly(anhydrides). Depot injectable formulations are also<br>
prepared by entrapping the drug in liposomes or microemulsions which are<br>
compatible with body tissues.<br>
[0158] Compositions for rectal or vaginal administration are preferably<br>
suppositories which can be prepared by mixing the compounds of this invention with<br>
suitable non-irritating excipients or carriers such as cocoa butter, polyethylene glycol<br>
or a suppository wax which are solid at ambient temperature but liquid at body<br>
temperature and therefore melt in the rectum or vaginal cavity and release the active<br>
compound.<br>
[0159] Solid dosage forms for oral administration include capsules, tablets,<br>
pills, powders, and granules. In such solid dosage forms, the active compound is<br>
mixed with at least one inert, pharmaceutically acceptable excipient or carrier such as<br>
sodium citrate or dicalcium phosphate and/or a) fillers or extenders such as starches,<br>
lactose, sucrose, glucose, mannitol, and silicic acid, b) binders such as, for example,<br>
carboxymethylcellulose, alginates, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidinone, sucrose, and<br>
acacia, c) humectants such as glycerol, d) disintegrating agents such as agar-agar,<br>
calcium carbonate, potato or tapioca starch, alginic acid, certain silicates, and sodium<br>
carbonate, e) solution retarding agents such as paraffin, f) absorption accelerators<br>
such as quaternary ammonium compounds, g) wetting agents such as, for example,<br>
cetyl alcohol and glycerol monostearate, h) absorbents such as kaolin and bentonite<br>
clay, and i) lubricants such as talc, calcium stearate, magnesium stearate, solid<br>
polyethylene glycols, sodium lauryl sulfate, and mixtures thereof. In the case of<br>
capsules, tablets and pills, the dosage form may also comprise buffering agents.<br>
[0160] Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in<br>
soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as<br>
well as high molecular weight polyethylene glycols and the like. The solid dosage<br>
forms of tablets, dragees, capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings<br>
and shells such as enteric coatings and other coatings well known in the<br>
pharmaceutical formulating art. They may optionally contain opacifying agents and<br>
can also be of a composition that they release the active ingredients) only, or<br>
preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally, in a delayed manner.<br>
Examples of embedding compositions that can be used include polymeric substances<br>
and waxes. Solid compositions of a similar type may also be employed as fillers in<br>
soft and hard-filled gelatin capsules using such excipients as lactose or milk sugar as<br>
well as high molecular weight polethylene glycols and the like.<br>
[0161] The active compounds can also be in micro-encapsulated form with<br>
one or more excipients as noted above. The solid dosage forms of tablets, dragees,<br>
capsules, pills, and granules can be prepared with coatings and shells such as enteric<br>
coatings, release controlling coatings and other coatings well known in the<br>
pharmaceutical formulating art. In such solid dosage forms the active compound may<br>
be admixed with at least one inert diluent such as sucrose, lactose and starch. Such<br>
dosage forms may also comprise, as in normal practice, additional substances other<br>
than inert diluents, e.g., tableting lubricants and other tableting aids such as<br>
magnesium stearate and microcrystalline cellulose. In the case of capsules, tablets<br>
and pills, the dosage forms may also comprise buffering agents. They may optionally<br>
contain opacifying agents and can also be of a composition that they release the active<br>
ingredient(s) only, or preferentially, in a certain part of the intestinal tract, optionally,<br>
in a delayed manner. Examples of embedding compositions which can be used<br>
include polymeric substances and waxes.<br>
[0162] Dosage forms for topical or transdermal administration of a compound<br>
of this invention include ointments, pastes, creams, lotions, gels, powders, solutions,<br>
sprays, inhalants or patches. The active component is admixed under sterile<br>
conditions with a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and any needed preservatives or<br>
buffers as may be required. Ophthalmic formulation, ear drops, and eye drops are<br>
also contemplated as being within the scope of this invention. Additionally, the<br>
present invention contemplates the use of transdermal patches, which have the added<br>
advantage of providing controlled delivery of a compound to the body. Such dosage<br>
forms are made by dissolving or dispensing the compound in the proper medium.<br>
Absorption enhancers can also be used to increase the flux of the compound across<br>
the skin. The rate can be controlled by either providing a rate controlling membrane<br>
or by dispersing the compound in a polymer matrix or gel.<br>
[0163] It will also be appreciated that the compounds and pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the present invention can be formulated and employed in<br>
combination therapies, that is, the compounds and pharmaceutical compositions can<br>
be formulated with or administered concurrently with, prior to, or subsequent to, one<br>
or more other desired therapeutics or medical procedures. The particular combination<br>
of therapies (therapeutics or procedures) to employ in a combination regimen will<br>
take into account compatibility of the desired therapeutics and/or procedures and the<br>
desired therapeutic effect to be achieved. It will also be appreciated that the<br>
therapies employed may achieve a desired effect for the same disorder (for example,<br>
an inventive compound may be administered concurrently with another anticancer<br>
agent), or they may achieve different effects (e.g., control of any adverse effects). For<br>
example, other therapies or anticancer agents that may be used in combination with<br>
the inventive anticancer agents of the present invention include surgery, radiotherapy<br>
(in but a few examples, y-radiation, neutron beam radiotherapy, electron beam<br>
radiotherapy, proton therapy, brachytherapy, and systemic radioactive isotopes, to<br>
name a few), endocrine therapy, biologic response modifiers (interferons,<br>
interleukins, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) to name a few), hyperthermia and<br>
cryotherapy, agents to attenuate any adverse effects (e.g., antiemetics), and other<br>
approved chemotherapeutic drugs, including, but not limited to, alkylating drugs<br>
(mechlorethamine, chlorambucil, Cyclophosphamide, Melphalan, Ifosfamide),<br>
antimetabolites (Methotrexate), purine antagonists and pyrimidine antagonists (6-<br>
Mercaptopurine, 5-Fluorouracil, Cytarabile, Gemcitabine), spindle poisons<br>
(Vinblastine, Vincristine, Vinorelbine, Paclitaxel), podophyllotoxins (Etoposide,<br>
Irinotecan, Topotecan), antibiotics (Doxorubicin, Bleomycin, Mitomycin),<br>
nitrosoureas (Carmustine, Lomustine), inorganic ions (Cisplatin, Carboplatin),<br>
enzymes (Asparaginase), and hormones (Tamoxifen, Leuprolide, Flutamide, and<br>
Megestrol), to name a few. For a more comprehensive discussion of updated cancer<br>
therapies see. The Merck Manual, Seventeenth Ed. 1999, the entire contents of which<br>
are hereby incorporated by reference. See also the National Cancer Institute (NCI)<br>
website (www.nci.nih.gov) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) website for<br>
a list of the FDA approved oncology drugs (www.fda.gov/cder/cancer/druglistframe -<br>
See Appendix A).<br>
[0164] In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
present invention further comprise one or more additional therapeutically active<br>
ingredients (e.g., chemotherapeutic and/or palliative). For purposes of the invention,<br>
the term "Palliative " refers to treatment that is focused on the relief of symptoms of a<br>
disease and/or side effects of a therapeutic regimen, but is not curative. For example,<br>
palliative treatment encompasses painkillers, antinausea medications and anti-sickness<br>
drugs. In addition, chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery can all be used<br>
palliatively (that is, to reduce symptoms without going for cure; e.g., for shrinking<br>
tumors and reducing pressure, bleeding, pain and other symptoms of cancer).<br>
Treatment Kits<br>
[0165] In other embodiments, the present invention relates to a kit for<br>
conveniently and effectively carrying out the methods in accordance with the present<br>
invention. In general, the pharmaceutical pack or kit comprises one or more<br>
containers filled with one or more of the ingredients of the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the invention. Such kits are especially suited for the delivery of solid<br>
oral forms such as tablets or capsules. Such a kit preferably includes a number of unit<br>
dosages, and may also include a card having the dosages oriented in the order of their<br>
intended use. If desired, a memory aid can be provided, for example in the form of<br>
numbers, letters, or other markings or with a calendar insert, designating the days in<br>
the treatment schedule in which the dosages can be administered. Alternatively,<br>
placebo dosages, or calcium dietary supplements, either in a form similar to or distinct<br>
from the dosages of the pharmaceutical compositions, can be included to provide a kit<br>
in which a dosage is taken every day. Optionally associated with such containers)<br>
can be a notice in the form prescribed by a governmental agency regulating the<br>
manufacture, use or sale of pharmaceutical products, which notice reflects approval<br>
by the agency of manufacture, use or sale for human administration.<br>

partitioning between water and a suitable water-immiscible solvent (eg. ethyl acetate,<br><br>
dichloromethane, diethyl ether). The desired product containing extracts were washed<br>
appropriately with water followed by a saturated solution of brine. On occasions<br>
where the product containing extract was deemed to contain residual oxidants, the<br>
extract was washed with a 10% solution of sodium thiosulphate in saturated aqueous<br>
sodium bicarbonate solution, prior to the aforementioned washing procedure. On<br>
occasions where the product containing extract was deemed to contain residual acids,<br>
the extract was washed with saturated aqueous sodium bicarbonate solution, prior to<br>
the aforementioned washing procedure (except in those cases where the desired<br>
product itself had acidic character). On occasions where the product containing<br>
extract was deemed to contain residual bases, the extract was washed with 10%<br>
aqueous citric acid solution, prior to the aforementioned washing procedure (except in<br>
those cases where the desired product itself had basic character). Post washing, the<br>
desired product containing extracts were dried over anhydrous magnesium sulphate,<br>
then filtered. The crude products were then isolated by removal of solvent(s) by<br>
rotary evaporation under reduced pressure, at an appropriate temperature (generally<br>
less than 45 °C).<br>
[0199] On occasions where triphenylphosphine oxide was a major byproduct<br>
of the reaction, the reaction mixture was added directly to a large volume of well-<br>
stirred hexane. The resultant precipitate of triphenylphosphine oxide was removed by<br>
filtration and the filtrate processed in the usual manner.<br>
[0200] General Purification Procedures:<br>
[0201] Chromatographic purification refers either to flash column<br>
chromatography on silica, using a single solvent or mixed solvent as eluent, or HPLC<br>
on a CIS column. Suitably purified desired product containing elutes were combined<br>
and concentrated under reduced pressure at an appropriate temperature (generally less<br>
than 45 °C) to constant mass. Final compounds were prepared for biological testing<br>
by either a) dissolved in 50% aqueous acetonitrile, filtered and transferred to vials,<br>
then freeze-dried under high vacuum; or b) dissolved in methanol, filtered and<br>
transferred to vials, then concentrated to dryness using a Centrifugal vacuum<br>
evaporator.<br>

mmol), HBTU (628.3rag, 1.66 mmol), were combined. CH2Cl2 (7mL) was added,<br>
followed by DIEA (0.72mL, 4.14mmol). The solution was stirred at room<br>
temperature under nitrogen for 1 hour. The solution was concentrated in vacuo, and<br>
the crude was purified by flash chromatography (SiC^) eluting with 4% ElOAc in<br>
hexanes. This provided compound 6Z (476.8mg) as a colorless oil in 86.7% yield.<br><br>
[0395] Compound 6Z (450mg, 1.13mmol) was dissolved directly in 4N<br>
HCl/dioxane (2.8mL). The reaction was stirred for overnight and then concentrated in<br>
vacuo to give compound 7Z (374.8mg) as a white solid, quantitatively.<br>
[0396] Preparation of compound ER-808815<br>
[0399] A procedure similar to that used for the preparation of compound ER-<br>
808367 was used.<br>
[0400] Example 19: Biological Assays:<br>
[0401] In certain embodiments, compounds of the invention were tested for in<br>
vitro and in vivo activity. Screening methods included standard in vitro cell growth<br>
inhibition assays using a panel of human cancer cell lines, a U937 (ATCC accession<br>
number CRL 1593) mitotic block reversibility assay, mouse serum stability assay,<br>
MDR assay, and cytotoxicity assay. In certain other emdodiments, compounds of the<br>
invention were evaluated in tumor xenograft in vivo growth inhibition assays.<br>
[0402] In vitro potency was determined in the MDA-MB-435 cell growth<br>
inhibition assay, and active compounds (IC50 
reversibility, MDR, and mouse serum stability assays. In addition, the active<br>
compounds were tested in the IMR-90 cytotoxicity assay and in additional cell growth<br>
inhibition assays in a panel of human cancer cell lines, both solid and non-solid<br>
tumors.<br>
[0403] Cell growth inhibition assay: Cultured human cancer cells (including<br>
breast, prostate, colon, lung, leukemia, lymphoma and other) were plated in 96-well<br>
plates and grown in the continuous presence of test compounds for 72 or 96 hours.<br>
The human cell lines used in this cell growth inhibition assay, include, but are not<br>
limited to, the following solid tumor cell lines and non-solid tumor cell lines: DLD-1<br>
colon cancer cells (ATCC accession number CCL-221), DU 145 prostate cancer cells<br>
(ATCC accession number HTB-81), H460 non small cell lung cancer, HCT-15 colon<br>
cancer cells (ATCC accession number CCL-225), HEL erythroleukemia cells, HL-60<br>
promyelocyte leukemia cells (ATCC accession number CCL-240), K562 leukemia<br>
(ATCC accession number CCL-243), LOX melanoma, MDA-MB-435 breast cancer<br>
cells, U937 lymphoma cells (ATCC accession number CRL 1593), PANC-1<br>
pancreatic cancer (ATCC accession number CRL-1469), HCC-2998 colon cancer<br>
(NCI-Frederick Cancer DCTD Tumor/Cell Line Repository), HCT 116 colon cancer<br>
(ATCC accession number CCL-247), HT-29 colon cancer (ATCC accession number<br>
HTB-38), LoVo colon cancer (ATCC accession number CCL-229), SW-480 colon<br>
cancer (ATCC accession number CCL-228), SW-620 colon cancer (ATCC accession<br>
number CCL-227) and COLO-205 colon cancer (ATCC accession number CCL-222).<br>
For monolayer cultures, growth was assessed using modifications (Amin et al, Cancer<br>
Res., 47: 6040-6045, 1987) of a methylene blue-based microculture assay (Finlay et<br>
al, Anal. Biochem., 139: 272-277, 1984). Absorbances at 620 and 405 nm were<br>
measured on a Titertek Multiscan MCC/340 plate reader and absorbances at 405 nm<br>
were subtracted from absorbances at 620 nm. For suspension cultures, growth was<br>
assessed using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyl tetrazolium bromide-<br>
based assay (Mosmann et al, J. Immunol. Methods, 65: 55-63, 1983) modified as<br>
follows. After 4 days of incubation with test compounds, sterile-filtered 3-(4,5-<br>
dimethylthiazol-2- yl)-2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide was added to each well (final<br>
concentration, 0.5 mg/ml), and plates were incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Acid-<br>
isopropanol (0.1 N HCl in isopropanol, 150 mL) was then added to each well, and the<br>
resultant formazan crystals were dis-solved by gentle mixing. Absorbances at 540 nm<br>
were measured on a Titertek Multiscan MCC/340 plate reader.<br>
[0404] Mitotic block reversibility assay was performed as described (See,<br>
Patent US 6,214,865 Bl, by B. Littelfield et al, 4/10/01; which is incorporated herein<br>
be reference in its entirety).<br>
[0405] Briefly, U937 (ATCC accession number CRP 1593) were exposed to<br>
various concentration of compounds for 12 hours. The compounds were washed<br>
away and the cells were allowed to recover for an additional 10 hours. The cells were<br>
collected by centrifugation and fixed overnight in 70% ethanol. The cells were<br>
washed in PBS, incubated with RNase A and stained with propidium iodide. Single<br>
channel flow cytometry was performed on a Becton Dickinson FACScan; the<br>
collection and analysis of data were performed using Becton Dickinson CELLQuest<br>
software. Doublet events were eliminated from analyses by proper gating on FL2-<br>
W/FL2-A primary plots before histogram analysis of DNA content (measured as FL2-<br>
A).<br>
[0406] Determination of activity in vitro utilizing the MDR assay. This is a<br>
modification of the standard cell growth inhibition assays described above. Two<br>
cultured himan cancer cell lines were used: human uterine sarcoma MDR negative<br>
MES-SA cells (ATCC accession number CRL-1976) and human uterine sarcoma<br>
MDR-positive MES-SA/Dx5 cells (ATCC accession number CRL-1977). Cells were<br>
plated in a 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 7500 cells / well. The cells were<br>
incubated in the presence or absence of test compounds for 96 hours. Cell growth was<br>
assessed using modifications (Amin et al, Cancer Res., 47: 6040-6045, 1987) of a<br>
methylene blue-based microculture assay (Finlay et al, Anal. Biochem., 139: 272-<br>
277, 1984). Absorbances at 620 and 405 nm were measured on a Titertek Multiscan<br>
MCC/340 plate reader and absorbances at 405 nm were subtracted from absorbances<br>
at 620 nm. The ratio of the concentrations of the compounds inhibiting the growth of<br>
cells by 50% was calculated and used to estimate the sensitivity of the compounds to<br>
MDR (multidrug-resistance, or P-glycoprotein-mediated drug efflux). In some cases, .<br>
a different pair of cell lines was used: MDR-negative murine leukemia cells P388/S,<br>
and MDR-positive murine leukemia cells P388/VMDRC.04. Cells were plated in a<br>
96-well microtiter plates at a density of 4000 cells / well. The cells were incubated in<br>
the presence or absence of test compounds for 72 hours. Cell growth was assessed<br>
using a 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5- diphenyl tetrazolium bromide-based assay<br>
(Mosmann et al, J. Immunol. Methods, 65: 55-63,1983) modified as follows. After 3<br>
days of incubation with test compounds, sterile-filtered 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2- yl)-<br>
2,5-diphenyl tetrazolium bromide was added to each well (final concentration, 0.5<br>
mg/ml), and plates were incubated at 37°C for 4 h. Acid-isopropanol (0.1 N HCl in<br>
isopropanol, 150 mL) was then added to each well, and the resultant formazan<br>
crystals were dis-solved by gentle mixing. Absorbances at 540 nm were measured on<br>
a Titertek Multiscan MCC/340 plate reader.<br>
[0407] Stability to esterase degradation was determined in the mouse serum<br>
stability assays. The enzymatic activity of mouse serum can result in inactivation of<br>
compounds in vivo despite their promising in vitro activity. A modification of the<br>
standard cell growth inhibition assays described above was used to determine stability<br>
of the test compounds to esterase degradation. Human breast carcinoma cell line<br>
MDA-MB-435 or human prostate carcinoma cell line DU 145 were used. The cells<br>
were plated in a 96-well microtiter plates at a density of 7500 cells / well. Prior to<br>
adding the test compounds to cells in the cell growth inhibition assay, the test<br>
compounds were incubated in 100% mouse serum or normal growth medium for 6<br>
hours at 37 °C. After that, the test compounds were added to the 96-well microtiter<br>
plates containing the cells. The cells were incubated in the presence or absence of test<br>
compounds for 96 hours. Cell growth was assessed using modifications (Amin et al,<br>
Cancer Res., 47: 6040-6045, 1987) of a methylene blue-based microculture assay<br>
(Finlay et al, Anal. Biochem., 139: 272-277, 1984). Absorbances at 620 and 405 nm<br>
were measured on a Titertek Multiscan MCC/340. Ability of test compounds to<br>
inhibit cell growth after compounds' exposure to mouse serum esterases was assessed.<br>
[0408] Cytotoxicity assay. To determine toxicity of compounds against<br>
normal, non-dividing cells, quiescent IMR-90 normal human fibroblasts (ATCC<br>
accession number CCL-186) were used. IMR-90 cells were plated in a 96-well<br>
microtiter plate format and grown to confluency (for 72 hours). After the 72-hour<br>
growth, the cells were washed and the medium was replaced from normal medium<br>
containing 10% fetal bovine serum to medium containing low concentration of serum<br>
(0.1%). Cells were made quiescent by incubation in 0.1% serum-containing growth<br>
medium for additional 72 hours. Cells were incubated with the test compounds for 24<br>
hours. Cellular ATP levels were measured using a ViaLight HS kit (LumiTech Ltd).<br>
A cytotoxic compound carbonyl cyanide was used in all assays as a positive control<br>
for cytotoxicity.<br>
[0409] Determination of antitumor activity in vivo in mice. In vivo tumor<br>
xenograft studies were performed in immunocompromised (nude) mice. Mice<br>
(female Ncr athymic) were implanted subcutaneously with human tumor xenografts<br>
(including breast MDA-MB-435, colon COLO-205, HCT-15, HCT-116, HCC-299S,<br>
HT-29, SW-620, DLD-1, LoVo, melanoma LOX, lung H522, pancreatic PANC-1).<br>
After the xenografts reached an average size of 75-200 mm3 or 400-600 mm3, the<br>
animals were weighed and randomly divided into groups of 8-10 on the first day of<br>
compound administration. Test compounds were administered intravenously or<br>
intraperitoneally. Tumor and body weight measurements were done twice weekly.<br>
