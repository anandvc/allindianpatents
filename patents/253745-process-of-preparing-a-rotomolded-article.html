				<td>Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to the use in rotomolding or in slush molding<br>
applications of a polyolefin composition comprising a processing aid and<br>
optionally a UV-stabilizer. The polyolefin composition can also be used for<br>
the production of articles by other processes such as injection molding, cast<br>
film, blown film, calendering, sheet extrusion.<br>
Background of the invention<br>
The present invention primarily concerns the fabrication of articles by<br>
rotomolding, also called rotational molding. In rotomolding a premeasured<br>
amount of polymer is placed in one half of the mold, the mold is closed and<br>
then heated until the polymer is molten. The mold is rotated so as to get good<br>
distribution of the polymer in the mold. The mold can be rotated either<br>
uniaxially or biaxially, but biaxial rotation is widely preferred, i.e. simultaneous<br>
rotation around two perpendicular axes. In the following the mold is cooled,<br>
opened and the formed article is removed from the mold. Rotomolding can<br>
also be used for multilayer molding, for example by using more than one<br>
polymer sequentially. Rotomolding allows the production of hollow articles<br>
with good wall thickness distribution and good mechanical properties.<br>
Slush molding is a process that is closely related to rotomolding. In the<br>
following the term rotomolding is therefore used to imply both, rotomolding<br>
and slush molding applications.<br><br>
The most widely used polymer in rotomolding is polyethylene. Therefore a lot<br>
of effort has been invested to improve the processability of polyethylene in<br>
rotomolding.<br>
US 6,362,270 discloses polymer compositions particularly suited for<br>
rotomolding. These polymer compositions comprise of at least 94 % by<br>
weight of one or more thermoplastic polymers and a maximum of 6 % by<br>
weight of one or more processing additives. The thermoplastic polymer may<br>
be selected from copolymers of ethylene and styrene, ethylene and/or C3-C20<br>
alpha-olefin homo- or copolymers, nylon, polyethylene terephthalate,<br>
polycarbonate, acrylic polymer, polystyrene, and blends of these polymers.<br>
Suitable processing additives include aromatic or aliphatic hydrocarbon oils,<br>
esters, amides, alcohols, acids, and their organic or inorganic salts as well as<br>
silicone oils, polyether polyols, glycerol monostearate (GMS), pentaerytritol<br>
monooleate, erucamide, stearamides, adipic acid, sebacic acid, styrene-<br>
alpha-methyl-styrene, calcium stearate, zinc stearate, phthalates and blends<br>
thereof. The processing additive preferably decreases the composition's melt<br>
viscosity and/or elasticity at zero or low shear rates to allow for a reduction in<br>
sintering time, cycle time and/or maximum mold temperature.<br>
A recent report (L.T. Pick, E. Harkin-Jpnes, Third Polymer Processing<br>
Symposium, 28-29.01.2004, Belfast, p. 259-268) shows a correlation<br>
between the number of bubbles in a rotomolded article and its impact<br>
performance, with a higher number of bubbles resulting in lower impact<br>
performance. In addition, a high number of bubbles has a negative influence<br>
on the optical properties of the finished articles.<br>
There is thus a need to provide a rotomolded article with a reduced number<br>
of bubbles.<br>
There is also a need to provide a rotomolded article with improved optical<br>
properties.<br><br>
There is also a need to provide a rotomolded article with improved<br>
mechanical properties.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide a rotomolded article based<br>
on a polyolefin composition with improved processability in rotomolding<br>
applications.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a rotomolded article<br>
based on a polyolefin composition that improves the sintaring and<br>
densification processes in rotomolding applications.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a rotomolded article<br>
based on a polyolefin composition that reduces bubble formation in the<br>
rotomolding process.<br>

based on a polyolefin composition that improves optical properties of the<br>
articles produced by rotomolding applications.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a rotomolded article<br>

Summary of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process of preparing a rotomolded<br>
article comprising placing a premeasured amount of a polyolefin composition in a<br>
mold, heating and rotating the mold, cooling the mold and removing the article<br>

Detailed description of the invention<br>
The densification aid comprises a polyether-block co-polyamide,optionally<br>
consisting essentially of a mixture of a polyether-block co-polyamide as major<br>
component with a minor component selected from the group consisting of<br>
thermoplastic polyurethane, polyetherester, polyethylene glycol and<br>
fluoropolymer.<br>
By major component it is meant that such a component makes up more than<br>
50 % by weight By minor component it is meant that such a component<br>
makes up less than 50 % by weight.<br>
Polyether-block co-polyamides are represented by the general formula<br><br>
wherein PA represents the polyamide segment and PEth the polyether<br>
segment For example the polyamide segment can be a PA 6, PA 66, PA 11<br>
or a PA 12. The polyether segment can for example be a polyethylene glycol<br><br>
(PEG) or a polypropylene glycol (PPG) or a polytetramethylenglycol (PTMG).<br>
The molecular weight M„ of the polyamide sequence is usually between 300<br>
and 15,000. The molecular weight M„ of the polyether sequence is usually<br>
between 100 and 6000. Such materials are commercially available for<br>
example from Atofina under the Pebax® trade name.<br>
The copolymers having polyamide blocks and polyether blocks are generally<br>
obtained from the polycondensation of polyamide blocks having reactive end<br>
groups with polyether blocks having reactive end groups, such as, inter alia:<br>
1)	polyamide blocks having diamine chain ends with polyoxyalkylene<br>
blocks having dicarboxylic chain ends;<br>
2)	polyamide blocks having dicarboxylic chain ends with<br>
polyoxyalkylene blocks having diamine chain ends, obtained by<br>
cyanoethylation and hydrogenation of aliphatic dihydroxylated<br>
α,ω-polyoxyalkylene blocks called polyetherdiols; and<br>
3)	polyamide blocks having dicarboxylic chain ends with polyetherdiols,<br>
the products obtained being, in this particular case, polyetheresteramides.<br>
The polyamide blocks having dicarboxylic chain ends derive, for example,<br>
from the condensation of polyamide precursors in the presence of a chain-<br>
stopping carboxylic diacid.<br>
The polyamide blocks having diamine chain ends derive, for example, from<br>
the condensation of polyamide precursors in the presence of a chain-<br>
stopping diamine.<br>
The polymers having polyamide blocks and polyether blocks may also<br>
include randomly distributed units. These polymers may be prepared by the<br>
simultaneous reaction of the polyether and of the precursors of the polyamide<br>
blocks.<br><br>
For example, a polyetherdiol, polyamide precursors and a chain-stopping<br>
diacid may be made to react together. A polymer is obtained which<br>
essentially has polyether blocks and polyamide blocks of very variable<br>
length, but in addition the various reactants that have reacted randomly,<br>
which are distributed in a random fashion along the polymer chain.<br>
A polyether diamine, polyamide precursors and a chain-stopping diacid may<br>
also be made to react together. A polymer is obtained which has essentially<br>
polyether blocks and polyamide blocks of very variable length, but also the<br>
various reactants that have reacted randomly, which are distributed in a<br>
random fashion along the polymer chain.<br>
The amount of polyether blocks in these copolymers having polyamide<br>
blocks and polyether blocks is advantageously from 10 to 70% and<br>
preferably from 35 to 60% by weight of the copolymer.<br>
The polyetherdiol blocks may either be used as such and copolycondensed<br>
with polyamide blocks having carboxylic end groups, or they may be<br>
aminated in order to be converted into polyetherdiamines and condensed<br>
with polyamide blocks having carboxylic end groups. They may also be<br>
blended with polyamide precursors and a diacid chain stopper in order to<br>
make the polymers having polyamide blocks and polyether blocks with<br>
randomly distributed units.<br>
The number-average molar mass Mn of the polyamide blocks is usually<br>
between 300 and 15,000, except in the case of the polyamide blocks of the<br>
second type. The mass M„ of the polyether blocks is usually between 100<br>
and 6000.<br>
As regards the polyetheresters, these are copolymers having polyester<br>
blocks and polyether blocks. They generally consist of soft polyether blocks,<br>
which are the residues of polyetherdiols, and of hard segments (polyester<br><br>
blocks), which usually result from the reaction of at least one dicarboxylic<br>
acid with at least one chain-extending short diol unit. The polyester blocks<br>
and the polyether blocks are generally linked by ester linkages resulting from<br>
the reaction of the acid functional groups of the acid with the OH functional<br>
groups of the polyetherdiol. The short chain-extending diol may be chosen<br>
from the group consisting of neopentyl glycol, cyclohexanedimethanol and<br>
aliphatic glycols of formula HO(CH2)nOH in which n is an integer varying from<br>
2 to 10. Advantageously, the diacids are aromatic dicarboxylic acids having<br>
from 8 to 14 carbon atoms. Up to 50 mol% of the dicarboxylic aromatic acid<br>
may be replaced with at least one other dicarboxylic aromatic acid having<br>
from 8 to 14 carbon atoms, and/or up to 20 mol% may be replaced with a<br>
dicarboxylic aliphatic acid having from 2 to 12 carbon atoms.<br>
As examples of dicarboxylic aromatic acids, mention may be made of<br>
terephthalic, isophthalic, dibenzoic, naphthalenedicarboxylic acids,<br>
4,4'-diphenylenedicarboxylic acid, bis(p-carboxyphenyl)methane acid,<br>
ethylenebis(p-benzoic acid), 1,4-tetramethylenebis(p-oxybenzoic acid),<br>
ethylenebis(paraoxybenzoic acid) and 1,3-trimethylene bis(p-oxybenzoic<br>
acid). As examples of glycols, mention may be made of ethylene glycol,<br>
1,3-trimethylene glycol, 1,4-tetramethylene glycol, 1,6-hexamethylene glycol,<br>
1,3-propylene glycol, 1,8-octamethylene glycol, 1,10-decamethylene glycol<br>
and 1,4-cyclohexylenedimethanol. The copolymers having polyester blocks<br>
and polyether blocks are, for example, copolymers having polyether blocks<br>
derived from polyether diols, such as polyethylene glycol (PEG),<br>
polypropylene glycol (PPG) or polytetramethylene glycol (PTMG),<br>
dicarboxylic acid units, such as terephthalic acid, and glycol (ethanediol) or<br>
1,4-butanediol units. The chain-linking of the polyethers and diacids forms<br>
soft segments while the chain-linking of the glycol or the butanediol with the<br>
diacids forms the hard segments of the copolyetherester. Such<br>
copolyetheresters are disclosed in patents EP 402 883 and EP 405 227.<br>
These polyetheresters are thermoplastic elastomers. They may contain<br>
plasticizers.<br><br>
Polyetheresters can for example be obtained from Du Pont Company under<br>
the Hytrel® trademark.<br>
As regards the polyurethanes, these in general consist of soft polyether<br>
blocks, which usually are residues of polyetherdiols, and hard blocks<br>
(polyurethanes), which may result from the reaction of at least one<br>
diisocyanate with at least one short diol. The short chain-extending diol may<br>
be chosen from the glycols mentioned above in the description of the<br>
polyether esters. The polyurethane blocks and polyether blocks are linked by<br>
linkages resulting from the reaction of the isocyanate functional groups with<br>
the OH functional groups of the polyether diol.<br>
Thermoplastic polyurethanes can for example be obtained from Elastogran<br>
GmbH under the Elastollan® trade name or from Dow Chemical Company<br>
under the Pellethane® trade name.<br>
Polyethylene glycols have the general formula<br><br>
Polyethylene glycols are commercially available in a wide range of molecular<br>
weights and viscosities. Depending upon their molecular weights<br>
polyethylene glycols can be liquid or solid. The polyethylene glycols used in<br>
the present invention usually have an average molecular weight from 100 to<br>
2000 g/mol and more preferably from 150 to 700 g/mol. Suitable polyethylene<br>
glycols can for example be obtained from Dow Chemical Company or BASF<br>
under the Carbowax® and Piuriol E® trade names.<br>
The fluoropolymers suited as processing aid in the present invention are for<br>
example polymers of vinylidene fluoride (H2C=CF2) and/or copolymers of<br>
vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene (F2C=CF-CF3). Though the<br><br>
copolymers of vinylidene fluoride and hexafluoropropylene do not have<br>
elastomeric properties they are commonly referred to as "fluoroelastomers".<br>
The content of the comonomer hexafluoropropylene in a fluoroelastomer is<br>
usually in the range of 30 to 40 % by weight. Fluoropolymers suited as<br>
processing aids in the current invention are for example commercially<br>
available under the Dynamar®, Viton® and IKynar® trade names from Dyneon,<br>
DuPont-Dow Elastomers or Atofina.<br>
Polyethylenes prepared with a Ziegler-Natta or with metallocene catalyst or<br>
with late transition metal catalyst systems are typically used in rotomolding<br>
applications. Other materials can also be used, such as for example<br>
polypropylene. Linear low density polyethylene is preferably used as<br>
disclosed for example in "Some new results on rotational molding of<br>
metallocene polyethylenes" by D. Annechini, E. Takacs and J. Vlachopoulos<br>
in ANTEC, vol. 1,2001.<br>
The preferred polyolefin used in the composition according to the present<br>
invention is a homo- or co-polymer of ethylene produced with a catalyst<br>
comprising a metallocene on a silica/aluminoxane support. More preferably,<br>
the metallocene component is ethylene-bis-tetrahydroindenyl zirconium<br>
dichloride or bis-(n-butyl-cyclopentadienyl) zirconium dichloride or dichloro-<br>
(dimethylsilylene)bis(2-methyl-4-phenyl-indenylidene) zirconium dichloride.<br>
The most preferred metallocene component is ethylene-bis-tetrahydroindenyl<br>
zirconium dichloride.<br>
In this description, the term copolymer refers to the polymerization product of<br>
one monomer and one or more comonomers. Preferably the monomer and<br>
the one or more comonomers are alpha-olefins with two to ten carbon atoms,<br>
with monomer and comonomer(s) being different alpha-olefins. More<br>
preferably the monomer is either ethylene or propylene and the one or more<br>
comonomers are alpha-olefins with two to eight carbon atoms. Most<br><br>
preferably the monomer is ethylene and the comonomer is either 1-butene or<br>
1-hexene.<br>
The melt index of the polyethylene or polypropylene resin preferably used in<br>
i<br>
the present invention typically falls in the following ranges:<br>
-	if the polyolefin of the present invention is a homo- or co-polymer of<br>
ethylene, its melt index MI2 is typically in the range 0.1 to 25 dg/min,<br>
preferably in the range 0.5 to 15 dg/min and most preferably in the<br>
range 1.5 to 10 dg/min. The MI2 is measured according to ASTM D<br>
1283 at a temperature of 190°C and a load of 2.16 kg.<br>
-	If the polyolefin of the present invention is a homo- or copolymer of<br>
propylene, its melt flow index (MR) is typically in the range 0.1 to 40<br>
dg/min, preferably in the range 0.5 to 30 dg/min and most preferably in<br>
the range 1 to 25 dg/min. The MFI is measured according to ASTM D<br>
1283 at a temperature of 230°C and a load of 2.16 kg.<br>
For the homo- and co-polymers of ethylene that can be used in the present<br>
invention, the density is typically in the range 0.910 to 0.975 g/ml and<br>
preferably in the range 0.915 to 0.955 g/ml, and most preferably in the range<br>
0.925 to 0.945 g/ml. The density is measured according to ASTM D 1505 at<br>
23°C.<br>
The polyolefins of the present invention may also have a bi- or multimodal<br>
molecular weight distribution, i.e. they may be a blend of two or more<br>
polyolefins with different molecular weight distributions, which can be<br>
blended either physically or chemically, i.e. produced sequentially in two or<br>
more reactors.<br>
The polydispersity D of the polyolefins used in the present invention is<br>
defined as the ratio Mw/Mn of the weight average molecular weight Mw over<br>
the number average molecular weight Mn. It is in the range 2 to 20,<br>
preferably 2 to 8, more preferably less than or equal to 5, and most<br><br>
preferably less than or equal to 4, the latter range being typically associated<br>
with the preferred metallocene-prepared polyethylene resins.<br>
The polyolefins of the present invention may also comprise other additives<br>
such as for example antioxidants, acid scavengers, antistatic additives, fillers,<br>
slip additives or anti-blocking additives.<br>
When a polyolefin composition is used as starting material, the composition<br>
comprises:<br>
-	from 50 to 99 % by weight of a first polyolefin, preferably polyethylene;<br>
-	from 1 to 50 % by weight of a second polymer, which is different from<br>
the processing aid, and which is preferably selected from the group<br>
consisting of polyamide, copolyamide, a second polyolefin different<br>
from the first one, copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate (EVA),<br>
copolymers of ethylene and vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polystyrene,<br>
polycarbonate and polyvinyl chloride (PVC).<br>
It is also possible to use a polyolefin comprising a densification aid as one or<br>
more layers of a multilayered rotomolded article with the other layers<br>
comprising a polymer preferably selected from the group consisting of<br>
polyamide, copolyamide, a second polyolefin different from the first one,<br>
copolymers of ethylene and vinyl acetate (EVA), copolymers of ethylene and<br>
vinyl alcohol (EVOH), polystyrene, polycarbonate and polyvinyl chloride<br>
(PVC).<br>
The one or more UV-stabilizers can be selected from any known UV-<br>
stabilizer known in the art. The preferred UV-stabilizers are hindered amine<br>
light stabilizers (HALS). Commercially available examples of HALS include<br>
Chimassorb® 944, Tinuvin® 622 or Tinuvin® 783 from Ciba Specialty<br>
Chemicals.<br><br>
Surprisingly, it has been found that the addition of 0.001 % by weight to 1 %<br>
by weight of a processing aid improves the processability of a polyolefin in<br>
rotomolding by modifying the sintering and the densification behavior.<br>
The use of a processing aid according to the present invention results in<br>
cycle time reductions of at least 10 %, preferably by at least 20 %. In order to<br>
obtain the same number of bubbles in the rotomolded articles the peak<br>
internal air temperature (PIAT) can be reduced by at least 10 degrees<br>
centigrade.<br>
Even more surprisingly, it has been found that the further addition of from<br>
0.025 % by weight to 0.500 % by weight of one or more UV-stabilizers to the<br>
composition described hereabove comprising 0.001 % by weight to 1 % by<br>
weight of a processing aid even further improves the processability of the<br>
polyolefin in rotomolding.<br>
It is believed that there is a synergy between the processing aid and the UV-<br>
stabilizer, and it is thus preferred to use both.<br>
In rotomolding a premeasured amount of polymer is placed in one half of the<br>
mold, the mold is closed and then heated until the polymer is molten. The<br>
mold is rotated so as to get an even distribution of the polymer in the mold.<br>
The mold can be rotated either uniaxially or biaxially, but biaxial rotation is<br>
widely preferred, i.e. simultaneous rotation!around two perpendicular axes. In<br>
the following step the mold is cooled, opened and the formed article is<br>
removed from the mold.<br>
The rotomolding cycle comprises three main steps,each of which has an<br>
impact on cycle time and the properties of the so-produced article. The three<br>
steps, comprise:<br>
-	sintering or coalescence,<br>
-	densification or bubble removal, and<br><br>
- crystallization.<br>
This is illustrated in Figure 1 giving the air temperature in the mold,<br>
expressed in degrees centigrade, as a function of time, expressed in<br>
minutes, during an exemplary molding cycle. The first inflexion in the curve<br>
noted as point A marks the beginning of the sintering or coalescence of the<br>
polymer particles. Sintering in the present application represents the<br>
coalescence of the polymer particles. The next inflexion in the curve noted as<br>
point B marks the beginning of the densification process of the molten<br>
polymer. Densification in the present application means bubble removal.<br>
Throughout this application sintering and densification are seen as two<br>
distinct processes; they vary independently with the rotomolding parameters<br>
and with the resin properties.<br>
Point C on the curve represents the Peak Internal Air Temperature (PIAT),<br>
followed by point D that marks the beginning of the crystallization process.<br>
Point E is associated with the time at which the rotomolded article is<br>
completely solidified and starts receding from the walls of the mold. Point F<br>
marks the opening of the mold, i.e. the end of the rotomolding cycle.<br>
The present invention is mostly concerned with the modification of the<br>
polymer behavior in the sintering (coalescence) and densification (bubble<br>
removal) phases of the rotomolding cycle and slush molding cycle. Sintering<br>
is measured according to a method described for example by Bellehumeur et<br>
al. (C.T. Bellehumeur, M.K. Bisaria, J. Vlachopoulos, Polymer Engineering<br>
and Science, 36, 2198, 1996). Densification and bubble formation has been<br>
discussed by Kontopoulo et al. (M. Kontopoulo, E. Takacs, J. Vlachopoulos,<br>
Rotation, 28, January 2000). During melting air pockets or bubbles are<br>
trapped, thus delaying the formation of a homogeneous melt and also<br>
affecting the aesthetical and/or mechanical properties of the finished product.<br><br>
For the present invention a charge-coupled device (CCD) camera was used<br>
to characterize the properties of polyolefin powders during a rotomolding<br>
cycle or during sintering and/or densification simulations.<br>
Examples<br>
Characterization of the processing behavior was analyzed using a megapixel<br>
progressive scan interline CCD with on-chip circuits commercially available<br>
from	Kodak. It has the following characteristics:<br>
-	architecture: interline CCD, progressive scan, non-interlaced<br>
-	pixel count: 1000(H) x 1000(V)<br>
-	pixel size: 7.4 um(H) x 7.4 um(V)<br>
-	photosensitive area: 7.4 mm(H) x 7.4 mm(V)<br>
-	output sensitivity: 12 µV/electron<br>
-	saturation signal: 40,000 electrons<br>
-	dark noise: 40 electrons rms<br>
-	dark current (typical): 
-	dynamic range: 60 dB<br>
-	quantum efficiency at 500,540,600 nm : 36%, 33%, 26%<br>
-	blooming suspension: 100X<br>
-	image lag : 
-	smear :
-	maximum data rate: 40 MHz/channel (2 channels)<br>
-	integrated vertical clock drivers<br>
-	integrated correlated double sampling (CDS)<br>
-	integrated electronic shutter driver<br>
The high performance 15-bit (16 bits minus 1 bit for control) CCD sensor with<br>
transparent gate electrode provides 32,768 unsigned levels of gray, allows<br>
the acquisition of about 10,000 frames/s and covers a broad spectrum of<br>
from 400 to 1000 nm.<br><br>
The camera set-up used to study sintering and densification behavior is<br>
illustrated in Figure 2 with the CCD camera (1), the IR probe (2), the<br>
computer (3), the heating system (4) and the annular lighting system (5). A<br>
typical example for sintering is shown in Figure 3 and a typical example for<br>
densification or bubble removal in Figure 4.<br>
The progressive disappearance of bubbles as a function of time and<br>
temperature is clearly and instantaneously followed. In addition to the visual<br>
aspect, the computer instantaneously produces a set of parameters resulting<br>
from picture analysis. These parameters are explained in Table I.<br><br><br>
The average distance between two bubbles Dav is defined as<br><br><br>
wherein the equivalent bubble diameter Daq, is defined in terms of the<br>
average surface of one bubble S by the equation S = 4TT (Deq/2)2.<br>
The base polyethylenes were supplied as pellets. The pellets were ground at<br>
40 to 80°C on commercial grinding equipment, e.g. a Wedco Series SE<br>
machine, to a powder with grain sizes from 100 µm to 800 µm. The<br>
processing aid or a blend of processing aids and a UV-stabilizer or a blend of<br>
UV-stabilizers were added to the powder in commercial mixing equipment<br>
Irganox® B 215 is a blend of Irgafos® 168 and Irganox® 1010 and is<br>
commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals. Tinuvin® 783 is a UV-<br>
stabilizer commercially available from Ciba Specialty Chemicals. Cyasorb<br>
THT® 4611 and Cyasorb THT® 4802 are UV-stabilizers commercially<br>
available from Cytec Industries. Pebax® MV 1074 SN01 is a polyether-block<br>
co-polyamide polymer commercially available from Atofina.<br>
Examples 1 and 2 and Comparative Examples A and B<br>
The polyethylene used for examples 1 and 2 and comparative examples A<br>
and B was a monomodal polyethylene with a MI2 of 8.0 dg/min and a density<br>
of 0.934 g/ml; it was produced using a supported metallocene catalyst<br>
system. It is commercially available from Atofina under the name Rnacene®<br>
M3S82.<br>
The processing aids, UV-stabilizers and other additives are given in Table II,<br>
together with their respective amounts.<br><br>
The samples were evaluated on a 10 L canister prepared by rotomolding<br>
using a commercial rotomolding equipment Peak Internal Air Temperature<br>
(PIAT) was 210°C in all cases.<br>
The effect of a polyether-block co-polyamide polymer, here Pebax® MV 1074<br>
SN01, and of the combination of a polyether-block co-polyamide polymer and<br>
a UV-stabilizer, here Tinuvin® 783, were demonstrated by a drastic<br>
improvement in densification, i.e. bubble removal, leading to a much reduced<br>
number of bubbles per mm2 in rotomolded articles.<br><br>
Table II clearly shows the additional effect of using the processing aid and<br>
the UV-stabilizer in combination.<br>
Examples 3 to 6 and comparative examples C and D<br>
The polyethylene used for examples 3 to 6 and comparative examples C and<br>
D was a monomodal polyethylene having a MI2 of 4.0 dg/min and a density<br>
of 0.940 g/ml; it was produced using a supported metallocene catalyst<br>
system. It is commercially available from Atofina under the name Finathene®<br><br>
ER2296. The processing aids, UV-stabilizers and other additives are given in<br>
Table III, together with their respective amounts.<br><br>
Examples 3 to 6 and comparative examples C and D have been analyzed<br>
regarding densification using the CCO camera set-up already described in<br>
the present invention.<br>
Results for examples 3 to 6 and comparative results C and D are illustrated<br>
in Figures 5 and 6 representing the number of bubbles Na per mm2 as a<br>
function of temperature in degree centigrade. It is evident that the addition of<br>
a polyether block amide strongly improves processability of the polyethylene<br>
by allowing for lower processing temperatures to accomplish bubble removal.<br>
The addition of a polyether-block co-polyamide polymer together with a UV-<br>
stabilizer even further improves processability of the polyethylene .<br><br>
For example 3 and comparative example C the sintering time has been<br>
determined using the method described by Bellehumeur et al. (C.T.<br>
Bellehumeur, M.K. Bisaria, J. Vlachopoulos, Polymer Engineering and<br>
Science, 36, 2198,1996). For comparative example C a sintering time of 520<br>
seconds and for example 3 a sintering time of 340 seconds has been<br>
determined, again showing that the addition of a polyether-block co-<br>
polyamide polymer improves the processing in rotomolding applications by<br>
decreasing the cycle time.<br><br>
