				<td>METHODS FOR DESIGNING TINTED CONTACT LENSES<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
The invention relates to tinted contact lenses. In particular, the invention<br>
provides methods for designing contact lenses that either enhance or change the<br>
color of one or more of a lens wearer's iris, limbal ring, and pupil.<br>
Background of the Invention<br>
The use of tinted, or colored, contact lenses to either or both alter the natural<br>
color of the eye and to mask ophthalmic abnormalities is well known. Typically,<br>
these lenses incorporate a pattern in the portion of the lens that overlies one or more<br>
of the iris, pupil, and limbal ring of the lens wearer when the lens is on-eye.<br>
The conventional method for providing the pattern is drawing the pattern by<br>
hand or by using a computer graphics program. Alternatively, the pattern may be<br>
formed by taking a digital image of one or more of an actual iris, pupil or limbal ring<br>
and extracting portions of the images for use in a pattern. These methods are<br>
disadvantageous in that accurately describing the resulting patterns for purposes of<br>
creating tooling for production of lenses incorporating the pattern, application of the<br>
pattern to a lens mold, pattern metrology and the like are challenging due to the<br>
complex geometries of the patterns.<br>

Detailed Description of the Invention and Preferred Embodiments<br>
The invention provides methods for designing patterns for use in tinted<br>
contact lenses, methods for the manufacture of such lenses, and lenses incorporating<br>
the patterns in which the patterns are generated using algorithms. The resulting<br>
patterns, when incorporated into a contact lens, serve to enhance or alter the color of<br>
one or more of the wearer' iris, pupil, and limbal ring. The method of the invention<br>
provides an objective description of the pattern for purposes of tooling, metrology<br>
and manufacturing of a lens incorporating the pattern.<br>
In one embodiment, the invention provides a method for producing patterns<br>
for tinted contact lenses comprising, consisting essentially of, and consisting of the<br>
step of generating at least a portion of a pattern using at least one algorithm. For<br>
purposes of the invention by "algorithm" is meant a set of rules that produce a set of<br>
points and includes, without limitation, one or more mathematical formulae.<br>
In the method of the invention, one or more algorithms are used to generate<br>
at least a portion of a pattern useful in a tinted contact lens. Algorithms for use in<br>
the invention are fractal in nature. Suitable algorithms may be derived from<br>
structures such as, without limitation, chaotic systems, diffusion systems,<br>
aggregation systems, L-systems, P-system, cellular automata and the like.<br>
As one example, the algorithm is derived from an L-system. Shown in<br>
Figure 1 is a flow diagram for deriving such an algorithm and producing a pattern<br>
according to the invention. In a first step (101), the inner and outer pattern<br>
boundaries are defined. The boundaries may be of any suitable size and shape.<br>
Typically, the boundaries will be that of the average radius of one or more of the<br>
human pupil, iris, and limbal ring. The outer and inner boundaries may be changed<br>
by adding or subtracting a small fraction, deltainner or deltaouter, of the corresponding<br>
 <br>
starting radius to the boundary (102). This change may be made stochastic by<br>
multiplying deltainner or deltaouter by a random number between 0 and 1, the resulting<br>
effect of which will be to make the boundary appear more natural. The change may<br>
be made, and random variable selected, at each iteration step, meaning at each time a<br>
line segment is drawn. Additionally, a starting angle, travel distance, and change<br>
angle are randomly selected (103) along with the starting string, iteration string, and<br>
number of iterations to be executed (104). The algorithm is then run to generate a<br>
pattern (105) and a determination is made as to whether the resulting pattern is<br>
acceptable (106). If the pattern is not acceptable, the process is repeated changing<br>
some or all of the parameters and constraints.<br>
In a more specific example, an algorithm is derived from an L-system and<br>
the boundary conditions limit the graphical commands of the L-system's symbols to<br>
an area that is substantially equal to the area covered by a conventional cosmetic<br>
lens iris pattern. Additionally and preferably, a stochastic element is provided to this<br>
L-system. More particularly, a 5th order L-system is constrained to produce a<br>
pattern within a region defined by two circles. In other words, the pattern ("P") is<br>
produced within a region defined by:<br>
 <br>
wherein Router Â± deltaouter is a radius of a circle, which radius is substantially equal to<br>
the average radius of the human iris plus or minus a fraction of the radius multiplied<br>
by a random variable between 0 and 1; and<br>
Rinner Â± deltainner is a radius of a circle, which radius is substantially equal to the<br>
average radius of the human pupil plus or minus a fraction of the radius multiplied<br>
by a random variable between 0 and 1.<br>
 <br>
The algorithm for this system begins with a starting string, or axiom,<br>
composed of symbols representing graphical commands. The commands are used<br>
by computer code to draw line segments, defined in units of pixels, that compose a<br>
pattern for use in a tinted lens. For example, the axiom may be the symbols "F-F"<br>
and, during the first iteration, an iteration string randomly chosen by the designer is<br>
substituted for each "F." The code then executes the command in the new string. In<br>
a second iteration, the iteration string is substituted for each "F" in the previous<br>
string and the code executes these commands.<br>
For example, if the iteration string for the axiom "F-F" is "F+F+", after the<br>
first iteration the string is "F+F+-F+F+." After the second iteration, the string is<br>
"F+F++F+F+F++-F+F++F+F++." Subsequent iterations are carried out until a<br>
predefined number of iterations, determined by the order of the system, has<br>
occurred. For example, 5 iterations would be carried out for a 5th order L-system.<br>
The order used will be determined by observation of which order provides the<br>
desired pattern.<br>
Graphical meanings are associated with the symbols for the axiom. For<br>
example, the symbols for the axiom above are set forth in the table below.<br>
 <br>
In the table above, the travel distance is the selected length. The values for<br>
the travel distance, or length, of the line segment drawn when the F symbol is<br>
 <br>
encountered, the turning angle, or the change in angle occurring when a "+" or "&amp;"<br>
symbol is encountered, the iteration string, and the new starting position of the line<br>
segments when a boundary condition violation has occurred are all selected by the<br>
designer. Each of these values will be determined by the values that produce a<br>
desirable pattern, meaning a pattern that when incorporated into a lens achieves a<br>
desirable on-eye cosmetic effect.<br>
The starting position of the first line segment is chosen randomly at a<br>
position near the inner circle. If the line segments are to be drawn within Router<br>
deltaouter and within Rinner Â± deltainner and a line segment is greater than Router<br>
deltaouter or less than Rinner Â± deltainner, a new starting position for the segments that<br>
is within these constraints will be randomly chosen at a distance times a random<br>
number between 0 and 1 from Rinner after which the code will continue with the<br>
execution of the graphical commands. If a line segment is within Router Â± deltaouter<br>
and Rinner Â± deltainner, no change will be made In Figure 2 is a flow diagram of such<br>
a method.<br>
Figures 3 through 5 are examples of patterns generated by the methods<br>
shown in Figures 1 and 2. For purposes of these figures, the outer and inner circles<br>
are 350 and 150 pixels, respectively. As shown in Figures 3 through 5, the inner and<br>
outer circle boundaries are fuzzy meaning that, when the final position of each line<br>
segment is defined, the algorithm checks to determine whether a boundary that<br>
changes randomly about the inner and outer circle boundaries was exceeded.<br>
Additionally, there is a stochastic nature to the algorithm used in that, if the<br>
boundary condition has been exceeded, a new starting position for the line segment<br>
will be selected randomly.<br>
In Figure 3 is depicted a pattern 10 suitable for use as a pattern in a cosmetic<br>
contact lens. The pattern 10 was generated after five iterations using the axiom F-F<br>
and the iteration string of F&amp;F&amp;F&amp;F&amp;F+F+F+F+. The starting angle was 180<br>
 <br>
degrees from the horizontal, the travel distance was 5 pixels, and the turning angle<br>
was 45 degrees and the rimover distance was 150 pixels. Figure 4 depicts pattern 20<br>
generated after 5 iterations and using the same axiom, iteration string, starting angle<br>
and travel distance as for Figure 3, but using a turning angle of 22.5 degrees and a<br>
rimover distance of 200 pixels. The pattern 30 of Figure 5 was generated as was the<br>
pattern for Figure 3 except that a travel distance of 2 pixels was used.<br>
The designs shown in Figures 3 through 5 are the result of the use of an<br>
algorithm used to draw line segments. As another example, an algorithm may be<br>
used to generate patterns similar to a physical process, such as diffusion. For<br>
example, a pattern may be developed by launching a defined number of circles and<br>
allowing each circle to find its location.<br>
Figure 6 shows a flow diagram of such a process. In a first step (201),<br>
horizon and substrate pattern boundaries, preferably which are circles, are defined.<br>
By horizon is meant the position from which the circles are launched. By substrate<br>
is meant the position at which the launched circles accumulate. The horizon and<br>
substrate circles may be of any radii, but preferably the horizon circle is concentric<br>
with and has a larger radius than the substrate circle. The horizon and substrate<br>
boundaries may be altered (202) at each iteration step by adding or subtracting a<br>
randomly chosen fraction of the corresponding starting horizon or substrate radius.<br>
The extent of this randomly chosen fraction will be determined by visually<br>
inspecting the impact this alteration has on the resultant pattern.<br>
In this embodiment of the method of the invention, the criteria for selecting<br>
the minimum and maximum number of circles to be launched (203) is based on the<br>
extent to which the area between the circles is to be filled so as to produce a<br>
desirable pattern. This will be determined by visually inspecting the impact made<br>
on the resultant pattern when changing the minimum and maximum number of<br>
circles. The same criteria is used to select the maximum and minimum radius of the<br>
 <br>
launched circles (204). The algorithm is then run to generate a pattern (205) and a<br>
determination is made as to whether the pattern is acceptable (206).<br>
More specifically by way of example and as shown in the flow diagram of<br>
Figure 7, the algorithm may be such that small circles are launched from a circular<br>
horizon using random locations and trajectories (301). Each circle is permitted to<br>
move until it either encounters another circle (302) or exceeds the Rhorizon Â±<br>
deltahorizon boundary (303). If a launched circle comes in contact with another such<br>
circle, it is placed at the point of contact and another circle is then launched from<br>
that point. If a launched circle moves beyond the Rhorizon Â± deltahorizon boundary, it is<br>
removed (304) and another circle is launched or if a launched circle is within the<br>
Rhorizon Â± deltahorizon boundary, no change is made (305). Alternatively, the horizon<br>
circle's radius may be randomly changed by a small amount when a query is made<br>
as to whether a particle has moved beyond the horizon circle radius.<br>
As a launched circle traverses the region between other circles and the<br>
substrate circle, it may collide with a background particle. A background particle is<br>
a particle, preferably invisible, that changes the trajectory of one of the circles used<br>
to define the pattern Such a collision is elastic in that the circle's trajectory may be<br>
changed by some random factor due to the collision. The probability of having such<br>
a collision may be controlled by use of a variable that acts similarly to a temperature<br>
and density variable and, thus, may be considered as a diffusion coefficient.<br>
Along with the collision probability, the designer may vary the horizon and<br>
substrate radii and the number of launched circles and their radii. In Figures 8 and 9<br>
are shown examples using such an algorithm. For purposes of these examples, the<br>
diffusion coefficient was infinite, meaning that there were no background collisions.<br>
In the Figure 8 is shown pattern 40 generated using the above-described<br>
diffusion algorithm, a horizon radius of 750 pixels, a substrate radius of 450 pixels<br>
 <br>
and 100,000 circles each having a radius of 1 pixel. Pattern 50 shown in Figure 9<br>
was generated using the diffusion algorithm, a horizon radius of 750 pixels, a<br>
substrate radius of 550 pixels, and 100,000 launched circles each with a radius of 1<br>
pixel.<br>
Using the method of the invention, patterns for tinted contact lenses may be<br>
created, which patterns are defined by one or more algorithms. The patterns may be<br>
used in a lens for either enhancing or altering one or more of the wearer's iris, pupil,<br>
and limbal ring color and the elements of the pattern may be translucent or opaque<br>
depending on the desired on-eye result. For purposes of the invention, by<br>
"translucent" is meant a color that permits an average light transmittance ( % T) in<br>
the 380 to 780 nm range of about 60 to about 99 %, preferably about 65 to about 85<br>
% T. By "opaque" is meant a color that permits an average light transmittance ( %<br>
T) in the 380 to 780 nm range of 0 to about 55, preferably 7 to about 50 % T.<br>
The color of the pattern elements may be substantially the same as, or<br>
complementary to, each other and the color selected for the pattern elements will be<br>
determined by the natural color of the lens wearer's iris and the enhancement or<br>
color change desired. Thus, elements may be any color including, without<br>
limitation, any of a variety of hues and chromas of blue, green, gray, brown, black<br>
yellow, red, or combinations thereof Preferred colors for a limbal ring include,<br>
without limitation, any of the various hues and chromas of black, brown and gray.<br>
The pattern elements, may be made from any organic or inorganic pigment<br>
suitable for use in contact lenses, or combinations of such pigments. The opacity<br>
may be controlled by varying the concentration of one or both of the pigment and<br>
titanium dioxide used, with higher amounts yielding greater opacity. Illustrative<br>
organic pigments include, without limitation, pthalocyanine blue, pthalocyanine<br>
green, carbazole violet, vat orange # 1, and the like and combinations thereof.<br>
Examples of useful inorganic pigments include, without limitation, iron oxide black,<br>
 <br>
iron oxide brown, iron oxide yellow, iron oxide red, titanium dioxide, and the like,<br>
and combinations thereof. In addition to these pigments, soluble and non-soluble<br>
dyes may be used including, without limitation, dichlorotriazine and vinyl sulfone-<br>
based dyes. Useful dyes and pigments are commercially available.<br>
The dye or pigment selected may be combined with one or more of a pre-<br>
polymer, or binding polymer, and a solvent to form the colorant used to produce the<br>
translucent and opaque layers used in the lenses of the invention. Other additives<br>
useful in contact lens colorants also may be used. The binding polymers, solvents,<br>
and other additives useful in the color layers of the invention are known and either<br>
commercially available or methods for their making are known.<br>
The elements may be applied to, or printed on, one or more surfaces of a lens<br>
or may be printed onto one or more surfaces of a mold into which a lens forming<br>
material will be deposited and cured In a preferred method for forming lenses<br>
incorporating the designs of the invention, a thermoplastic optical mold, made from<br>
any suitable material including, without limitation, cyclic polyolefins and<br>
polyolefins such as polypropylene or polystyrene resin is used. The elements are<br>
deposited onto the desired portion of the molding surface of the mold. By "molding<br>
surface" is meant the surface of a mold or mold half used to form a surface of a lens.<br>
Preferably, the deposition is carried out by pad printing as follows.<br>
A metal plate, preferably made from steel and more preferably from stainless<br>
steel, is covered with a photo resist material that is capable of becoming water<br>
insoluble once cured. The elements are selected or designed and then reduced to the<br>
desired size using any of a number of techniques such as photographic: techniques,<br>
placed over the metal plate, and the photo resist material is cured.<br>
 <br>
The plate is subsequently washed with an aqueous solution and the resulting<br>
image is etched into the plate to a suitable depth, for example about 20 microns. A<br>
colorant containing a binding polymer, solvent, and pigment or dye is then deposited<br>
onto the elements to fill the depressions with colorant. A silicon pad of a geometry<br>
suitable for use in printing on the surface and varying hardness, generally about 1 to<br>
about 10, is pressed against the image on the plate to remove the colorant and the<br>
colorant is then dried slightly by evaporation of the solvent. The pad is then pressed<br>
against the molding surface of an optical mold. If necessary, the mold is degassed<br>
for up to 12 hours to remove excess solvents and oxygen after which the mold is<br>
filled with lens material. A complementary mold half is then used to complete the<br>
mold assembly and the mold assembly is exposed to conditions suitable to cure the<br>
lens material used. Such conditions are well known in the art and will depend upon<br>
the lens material selected. Once curing is completed and the lens is released from<br>
the mold, it is equilibrated in a buffered saline solution.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, a clear, pre-polymer layer is used, which pre-<br>
polymer layer overlays the pattern and may form the entirety of the lens' outermost<br>
surface. The clear, pre-polymer layer preferably is first applied to the; mold surface<br>
and the colorant is subsequently applied to the pre-polymer. The pre-polymer may<br>
be any polymer that is capable of dispersing the pigment and any opacifying agent<br>
used.<br>
The invention may be used to provide tinted hard or soft contact lenses made<br>
of any known lens-forming material, or material suitable for manufacturing such<br>
lenses. Preferably, the lenses of the invention are soft contact lenses, the material<br>
selected for forming the lenses being any material suitable for producing soft contact<br>
lenses. Suitable preferred materials for forming soft contact<br>
lenses using the method of the invention include, without limitation, silicone<br>
elastomers, silicone-containing macromers including, without limitation, those<br>
 <br>
disclosed in United States Patent Nos. 5,371,147, 5,314,960, and 5,057,578<br>
incorporated in their entireties herein by reference, hydrogels, silicone-containing<br>
hydrogels, and the like and combinations thereof. More preferably, the lens is made<br>
from a material containing a siloxane functionality, including, without limitation,<br>
polydimethyl siloxane macromers, methacryloxypropyl polyalkyl siloxanes, and<br>
mixtures thereof, a silicone hydrogel or a hydrogel made of monomers containing<br>
hydroxy groups, carboxyl groups, or both and combinations thereof. Materials for<br>
making soft contact lenses are well known and commercially available. Preferably,<br>
the lens material is acquafilcon, etafilcon, genfilcon, lenefilcon, balafilcon,<br>
lotrafilcon, or galyfilcon.<br>
