				<td>METHODS AND APPARTUS FOR CONTROLLING INTERFERENCE TO BROADCAST SIGNALING IN A PEER TO PEER NETWORK<br>
RELATED APPLICATIONS<br>
[0001]    The present application claims the benefit of U.S. Provisional Patent Application S.N. 60/948,968 filed on July 10,2007, titled "METHODS AND APPARATUS FOR SENDING BROADCAST/MULTICAST MESSAGES IN A PEER-TO-PEER NETWORK", and assigned to the assignee hereof and vsch is hereby expressly incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
FIELD<br>
[0002]    Various embodiments relate to wireless communications, and more particularly, to methods and paratus related to supporting broadcast communications in a peer to peer network.<br>
[0003]    In a wireless communications system there is typically a fixed amount of air link resources available for utilization by wireless communications devices for combined control signaling and trafiSc signaling. In a wireless communications system lacking centralized control, e.g., an ad hoc peer to peer network, the scheduling of traffic air link resources is a challenging task.<br>
[0004]    A first device in a peer to peer networic may desire to broadcast data to a plurality of other devices in the network, e.g., an open end !»t of devices, which may happen to be in its local vicinity at the time. Similarly, a second device in the peer to peer network may also desire to broadcast data to a plurality of other devices in the netwoik vsch may h&gt;pen to be in its local vicinity. Using a broadcast signaling approach can, at times, be more efficient than having to sclwdule and transmit the same unicast data signals to multiple devices over multiple peer to peer connections. However, if both the first and second device were to broadcast at the same time using the same air link resource in a peer to peer network, recovery of the broadcast signal information by possible receiver devices may be unacceptable depending upon device locations, transmission power levels, channel conditions, receiver Ciq)abilities, etc. Based on the above discussion, there is a need for methods and iqparatus which support<br>
 <br>
broadcast data signaling in a peer to peer network and provide for interference management.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0005]    Methods and paratus related to broadcasting data and/or interference management in a peer to peer wireless communications networic are described. In various embodiments scheduling of trafBc air link resources is performed on a slot by slot basis in a decentralized manner. Wireless devices intending to broadcast traffic signals transmit broadcast request signals, sometimes alternatively referred to as broadcast indicator signals. A priority level is associated with each of the broadcast request signals. A receiver device intending to receive broadcast signals detects the broadcast request signals and makes an interference determination as to whether the higher priority broadcast traffic signal can be successfully recovered in the presence of lower priority broadcast traffic signals. If the determination is that the expected interference fix&gt;m the lower priority broadcast traffic is unacceptable, the receiver device generates and transmits an interference control signal. The interference control signal, expected to be received by the lower priority device which intended to broadcast, communicates to the lower priority device that the receiver device commands or requests ttat the lower priority device not broadcast.<br>
[0006]    An exemplary broadcast transmission method in accordance with some embodiments comprises: transmitting a broadcast indicator signal indicating an intent to broadcast data; monitoring for interference control signals following transmission of said broadcast indicator signal; and making a decision iiether or not to proceed with broadcasting data based on the result of said monitoring. An exemplary wireless tenninal in accordance with some embodiments comprises: a broadcast indicator signal generation module configured to generate a broadcast indicator signal indicating an intent to broadcast data; a broadcai indicator signal control module configured to control a wireless transmitter module to bromkast said generated broadcast indicator signal; a response monitoring module configured to monitor for interference control signals following transmission of said broadcast indicator signal; and a broadcast decision module configured to make a decision Mvliether or not to proceed with broadcasting data based on the result of said monitoring.<br>
 <br>
[0007]    An exemplary method of operating a first device in accordance with some embodiments comprises: receiving, fix&gt;m a second device a first broadcast indicator signal having a first priority corresponding to said second device, said first broadcast indicator signal indicating an intent by the second device to broadcast data; receiving fix)m a third device a second broadcast indicator signal having a second priority corresponding to said third device, said second broadcast indicator signal indicating an intent by the third device to broadcast data; and making a decision as to whether or not to transmit an interference control signal as a function of the relative priority of the first and second broadcast indicator signals. An exemplary wireless communications device, in accordance with some embodiments, comprises: a wireless receiver module configure to receive signals; and a broadcast sigrml monitoring module configured to: (i) detect in said received signals a first broadcast indicator signal fix)m a second device, said first broadcast indicator signal having a first priority corresponding to said second device, said first broadcast indicator signal iiKiicating an intent by the second device to broadcast data; and (ii) ctetect in said received signals a second broadcast indicator signid fiom a third device, said second broadcast indicator signal having a secomi priority corresponding to said third device, said second broadcast indicator signal indicating an mtent by the third device to broadcast data. The exemplary wireless communications device further conrises an interference control signaling decision module for making a decision as to wliether or not to transmit an interference control signal as a function of the relative priority of the first and second broadcast mdicator signals.<br>

[0020]    Figure 1 is a drawing of an econplary peer to peer network 100, e.g., an<br>
ad-hoc communications network, m accordance with an exemplary embodiment. The<br>
 <br>
exemplary network supports broadcast traffic signaling by peer to peer devices. The exemplary network supports broadcast traffic signaling by peer to peer devices. Broadcasting includes, at least in some embodiments, multicasting and can be open in terms of the number of devices which may receive the broadcast. Broadcast differs from what is sometimes called Groupcast in that in Groupcast the transmission is to a closed group of users, e.g., where the number of listeners is often known. In the case of broadcast, the broadcasting device may, but normally does not know, the number of listeners to the broadcast.<br>
[0021]    Exemplary peer to peer network 100 includes a plurality of wireless devices (peer to peer broadcast capable communications device 1 102, peer to peer broadcast capable communications device 2 104, peer to peer broadcast ctble communications device 3 106, peer to peer broadcast capable communications device 4 108,..., peer to peer l»x}adcast capable communications device N 110) siq)porting peer to peer traffic signaling and broadcast traffic signaling. In some embodiments, the network 100 includes a reference signal transmitter 116, e.g., a beacon transmitter. In some embodiments, reference signal transmitter or another device in the network communicates netwoik configuration control information such as information identifying a mixture between slots designated as broadcast/unicast traffic slots and slots designated as unicast slots.<br>
[0022]    The wireless devices (102,104,106,108,..., 110) in the communications network 100 can establish connections with one another, e.g., peer to peer connections, transmit unicast peer to peer traffic signals, and transmit broadcast traffic signals. There is a recurring tuning structure used in the netwoiic 100. In some embodiments a reference signal, e.g., an OFDM beacon signal from reference signal transmitter 116, is used by a wireless device to synchronize with resprot to the timing structure. Alternatively, a signal used to synchronize with the timing structure may be sourced from another device, e.g., a OPS transmitter, a base station or anotha: peer to peer device. The tuning structure used in the network includes a plurality of individual traffic slots.<br>
[0023]    Figure 2 is a flowchart 200 of an exemplary method of operating a first device, e.g., a wireless communications device siqjportii broadcast signaling and unicast signaling. Operation starts in step 202 where the first device is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds from start step 202 to step 204 and step 210.<br>
 <br>
[0024]    In step 204, which is performed on an ongoing basis, the first device monitors for data to be transmitted. Step 204 may, and sometimes does include sub-step 206, in which the first device receives data to be transmitted, e.g., fix)m a user I/O device. For received data to be transmitted, opwation proceeds fix&gt;m step 204 to step 207 and step 208. In step 207 the first device stores the received data in a queue. In step 208 the first device designates the received data to be transmitted as broadcast data or unicast data.<br>
[0025]    Returning to step 210, in step 210 the first device determines if there is currently queued data waiting to be transmitted. If the determination of step 210 is that there is queued data waiting to be transmitted, then operation proceeds firom step 210 to step 212; otherwise, operation proceeds finm the output of step 210 to  input of step 210 for another test at a lata: point in time as to vetira: or iu&gt;t there is queued data waiting to be transmitted.<br>
[0026]    Returning to step 212, in step 212 the first device determines whether broadcast data is to be transmitted or whether unicast data is to transmitted. Step 212 mcludes sub-steps 214 and 216. At times sub&gt;step 214 is performed in vAmh the first device determines that broadcast data is to be trananitted. In such a situation, operation proceeds fix)m sub-step 214 to step 218. At times, sub-step 216 is performed in vch the Gist device determines that unicast data is to be transmitted. In such a situation, operation proceeds from sub-step 216 to step 226.<br>
[0027]    Returning to step 218, in step 218 the first device identifies a broadcast transmission request resource in a recurring timing stricture inclwling transmission request intervals of a first type which support broadcast transmission requests and a second time which are limited to supporting unicast trammission requests. In some embodunents, transmission request intervals of the first type su{rt both broadcast and unicast transmission requests. In some embodiments, the numb of second type request intervals exceeds the number of first type request intervals.<br>
[0028]    In various embodiments, the recurring timing structure includes slots dedicated to unicast transmissions and slots that support brocdcast transmissions. In some such embodiments, at least some of the slots ch siqrt broadcast transmissions also sujirt unicast transmissions. In some such onbodiments, broadcast transmission request resources corresponding to a slot which suirts both unicast and<br>
 <br>
broadcast transmissions have a higher priority than unicast transmission request resources corresponding to that slot.<br>
[0029]    Operation proceeds from step 218 to step 220. In step 220 the first device transmits a transmission request in said identified broadcasts transmission request resource. In some embodiments, transmitting a transmission request said identified broadcast transmission request resource includes transmitting in a slot which supports broadcast transmissions. Operation proceeds firom step 220 to step 222. In step 222 the first device determines whether or not it received a transmission request response, e.g., an interference control signal, in a higher priority request response resource. If it has not received a higher priority request response, then operation proceeds fix&gt;m step 222 to step 224 where the first device transmits broadcast data; otherwise, operation proceeds from step 222 to connecting node A 234. Operation proceeds from step 224 to connecting node A 234.<br>
[0030]    Returning to step 226, in step 226 the first device identifies a unicast transmission request resource in said recurring timing structure. Operation proceeds from step 226 to step 228, in which the first device transmits a transmission request in the identified unicast request resource which is in a transmission slot. In some embodiments, transmitting a transmission request in said identified unicast transmission request resource includes transmitting a request in a transmission slot which supports unicast transmissions. Operation proceeds fix)m step 228 to step 230. In step 230 the first device determines if it has received a request response in response to the transmitted transmission request of step 228 and if it has decided not to yield. If the first device has received a request response and has decided not to yield, then operation proceeds fix)m step 230 to step 232, v/hen the first device transmits unicast data; otherwise, operation proceeds from step 230 to connecting node A 234. In some embodiments, traffic data transmission intervals in the recurring timing structure Mch are lunited to unicast data transmission are limited to corresponding transmission request intervals of the second type.<br>
[0031] Operation proceeds from step 232 to connecting node A 234. Operation proceeds from connecting node A 234 to step 210, v/bexc the first device checks if there is any queued data is waiting to be transmitted.<br>
[0032]    In some embodiments, the exemplary method also includes steps 241 and 243. In step 241, which in some embodiments is performed on an ongoing basis, the<br>
 <br>
first device monitors for system configuration information signals, e.g., at predetermined times in a recurring timing structure. Step 241 may, and sometimes does, includes sub-step 242 in which the first device receives configuration information, e.g., information indicating a number of first type slots and second type slots in a recurring timing structure, information indicating a pattern of first type slots and second type slots in a recurring timing structure, information indicating a distribution of first type slots and second type slots in a recurring timing strucUire, and/or information indicating one of a plurality of alternative recurring timing structures. Operation proceeds from sub-step 242 to step 243, in which the first dcAdce implements and/or adjusts operations in accordance with the received configuration information. In some embodiments, configuration information in a region of the network can be, and sometimes is, adjusted dynamically, e.g., in response to current networic conditions and/or needs. For example, the timing structure may be modified to include more or less slots supporting broadcast traffic to satisfy current conditions and/or needs. In some embodunents, the configuration mformation is communicated via a fixed location transmitter, e.g., a beacon transmitter.<br>

For example, unicast resource identification module 346 identifies a transmission unit within unicast request resource information 380, within unicast request resource information 391, or within unicast request resource information of information 393, associated with a conroction identifier currently held by wireless terminal 300 corresponding to the peer to peer connection over which wireless terminal 300 desixcs to transmit the unicast traffic data.<br>
[0046]    Unicast transmission request signal generation module 348 generates a unicast transmission request v/bea the unicast determination module 338 determines that unicast data is to be transmitted. Unicast reqiwst control module 350 controls the wireless transmitter module 304 to transmit the generated unicast transmission request<br>
 <br>
in the identified unicast transmission request resource in a transmission slot which supports unicast transmissions.<br>
[0047]    Broadcast response module 352 monitors for, detects and measures received interference control signals communicated on broadcast transmission request resources, e.g., resources identified by information 376. Broadcast response module 352 makes a decision as to whether or not the wireless terminal 300 should proceed with an intended broadcast transmission or perform transmitter yielding and not transmit the intended broadcast traffic signal. In some embodiments, the broadcast response module 352 makes a decision to yield when it detects a control interference signal corresponding to a higher priority intended broadcast transmission above a threshold.<br>

[0049]    Broadcast traffic module 356 generates a broadcast traffic signal, v\4ien the broadcast response module 352 decides to proceed with the intended tvoadcast traffic transmission. Broadcast traffic module 356 contzols the wireless trananitto' module 304 to the transmit the generated broadcast traffic signal in the data resource, e.g., traffic segment, corresponding to the broadcast transmission request. For example, the traffic segment used to carry the broadcast traffic signal may be identified by data resource information 386 corresponding to a broadcast transmissiMi request conveyed in a broadca traiemission request resource identified by information 374. In this<br>
 <br>
exemplary embodiment, the broadcast traffic signal is transmitted at a predetermined data rate, e.g., a low data rate such that the broadcast traffic signal may be expected to be recoverable under adverse channel conditions.<br>
[0050]    Unicast traffic module 358 generates a unicast traffic signal, when the unicast response module 354 decides to proceed with the intended unicast traffic transmission. Unicast traffic module 358 controls the wireless transmitter module 304 to the transmit the generated unicst traffic signal in the data resource, e.g., traffic segment, corresponding to the unicast transmission request which wireless terminal 300 previously transmitted. For example, if the unicast request was communicated using a resource identified by information 380, a data resource, e.g., traffic segment, identified by information 386 is used to carry the unicast traffic signal. Alternatively, if the unicast request was communicated using a resource identified by information 391, a data resource, e.g., traffic segment, identified by information 395 is used to carry the unicast traffic signal.<br>
[0051]    Unicast traffic module 358 also controls the data rate used for unicast data transmission. The data rate used for unicast traffic may be, and sometimes does, vary fi:om one slot to another, e.g., as a fimction of channel qulaity feedback information communicated in response to a pilot signal. The pilot signal and the corresponding chaimel quality feedback information are conmiunicated using preamble resources, e.g., resources identified by information 384 or information 394 dqiending upon the slot.<br>
[0052]    In this exemplary embodiments, unicast traffic acknowledgments are communicated in response to received unicast traffic signals. Unicast traffic module 354 also monitors for and (tetects unicast traffic acknowledgments signals after it has transmitted unicast traffic signals, e.g., using an acknowledgment resource identified by information 388 or information 396 depending vapon the slot.<br>
[0053]    Wireless tenninal 300 utilizes a recurring tiining structure including slots of a first type supporting both broadcast and unicast signaling and slots of a second type siportmg unicast signaling but not broadcast signaling. Thus a Sist type of slot, e.g., a broadcast/unicast slot such as that identified by infomudon 366, includes reqi»sts interval resources to accommodate both broadcast transmission requests and unicast transmission requests. A second type of slot, e.g., a slot such as that idmtified by unicast slot information 368 include request interval resources accommodating unicast<br>
 <br>
traffic transmission request but no request resources accommodating broadcast traffic transmission requests. In this embodiment, the number of the second type of slots exceeds the number of the first type of slots in the recurring timing structure.<br>
[0054]    In this exemplary embodiment, transmission request intervals of a first type support both broadcast and unicast transmission requests. The transmission request interval for a broadcast/unicat slot identified by information 372 includes a number of consecutive transmission request sub-intervals which may be non-contiguous, e.g., separated by response intervals. For example, a first transmission request sub-interval may corresponding to broadcast request resource information 374 and a second sub-interval may correspond to unicast request resource information 382.<br>
[0055]    In this exemplary embodiment, the trananission request intervals of the second type are limited to supporting unicast transmission requests. The transmission request interval for a unicat slot identified by information 368 includes a number of consecutive transmission request sub-intervals which may be non-contiguous, e.g., separated by response intervals, which support unicast transmission requests but do not support broadcast transmission request.<br>
[0056]    The number of second type transmission requests intervals exceeds the number of first type trananission request intervals in the recurring timing structure. Slot type sequence information 370 includes information identifying the sequence and number of broadcast/unicast slots and the sequence and number of unicast slots in the recurring timing structure.<br>
[0057]    In this exemplary embodiment, data transmission intervals which are limited to unicast data transmission are limited to corresponding transmission request intervals of the second type. For example, a data transmissicm interval identified by data resource information 39S is limited to correspondii transmission request intervals of the second type.<br>
[0058]    It may be observed that the recurring timing structure identified by information 362 includes slots dedicated to unicast transmission and slots that sijport broadcast transmissions. At least some of the slots &gt;ch support broadcast transmissions also support umcast transmissions, e.g., a slot identified by information 366 supports both broadcast and unicast transmissions.<br>
[0059]    In this exemplary embodiment, transmission request resources corresponding to lnt)adcast transmissions in a slot isUch supports both unicast and<br>
 <br>
broadest transmission have a higher priority than transmission request resources corresponding to unicast transmission for the same slot For example, resources identified by broadcast resource information 374 have higher priority than resources identified by unicast request resource information 382.<br>
[0060]    Configuration module 359 detects configuration signals, e.g., fim a beacon transmitter or other device communicating system information, and implements a configuration in accordance with the information conveyed by the received configuration signals. In one embodiment, a configuration signal communications information used to set up and/or change the mixture between the number of slots designated to broadcast/unicast slots and the number of slots designated to be unicast slots in the recurring timing system being utilized in the vicinity.<br>

The exemplary method starts in step 402, where the communications device is powered on and initialized. Operation proceeds fi?om start step 402 to step 404. In step 404, the communications device determines a ptianty level for a broadcast iiKlicator signal. In some embodiments step 404 includes one or more of sub-steps 406 and 408. In sub-step 406 the communications device determines the priority level based on a time varying function. In sub-step 408 the communications device determines the priority level based on an identifier corresponding to the communications device. Operation proceeds firom step 404 to step 410.<br>
[0062]    In stq) 410 the communications device transmits the broadcast indicator signal indicating an intent to broadcast data. In some embodiments, the broadcast indicator signal is transmitted on a single tone of an OFDM symbol. Operation proceeds from step 410 to step 412. In step 412 the communications device monitors for interference control signals. Operation proceeds from step 412 to step 414. Instep 414 the communications device makes a decision whetiier or not to proceed with broadcasting data based on the result of the monitoring of step 412.<br>
[0063]    In some embodiment, the broadcast indicator signal is tnmsmitted at a determined priority level and individual interference control signals detected by the monitoring each have a priority level, and making a decision whether or not to proceed with broadcastii includes determining if an interferoice control signal having a higher priority than the priority level of the transmitted broadcast indicator signal was received.<br>
 <br>
In some such embodiments, making a decision whether or not to proceed with broadcasting includes, when an interference control signal having a higher priority than the priority of the transmitted broadcast indicator signal was received, making an interference determination based on the power level of at least one received interference control signal having a higher priority than the priority level of the trananitted broadcast indicator signal. In some embodiments, making a decision Aether or not to proceed with broadcasting includes deciding not to broadcast when the interference determination determines that an interference level above a threshold level will be caused to the device which transmitted the interference control signal having the higher priority than the priority level of the transmitted broadcast indicator signal, if the broadcast proceeds.<br>
[0064]    Operation proceeds from step 414 to step 416. In stq) 416, if the decision of step 414 is to proceed with the broadcast, then opostion jH-oceeds from step 416 to step 418, where the communications device transmits data in a traffic slot corresponding to the transmitted broadcast indicator signal; otherwise, operation proceeds from step 416 to connecting node A 420. C)eration proceeds from step 418 to connecting node A 420. Operation proceeds from connecting node A 420 to step 404.<br>
[0065]    Consider an example, where the commtmications device performs two iterations of the flowchart. In a first iteration, a first broadcast indicator signal indicating an intent to broadcast data may be transmitted at a first imority level, vsle during a second iteration, a second broadcast signal indicating an intent to broadcast data may be transmitted at a second priority level which is different from the first priority level. In some embodiments, priority correspondii to a device identifier is varied in accordance with a hofg pattern in a recurring timing structure. This feature of variation of priority facilitates broadcast opportuniti for different ctevices which may be in conflict due to interference issues.<br>

Detected interference control signals information 556 may, and sometimes does, include information corresponding to one or more detected interference control signals ((detected control interference signal 1 564, received power<br>
 <br>
level information for detected control interference signal 1 566, priority level information associated with detected interference control signal 1 568),..., (detected control interference signal N 570, received power level information for detected control interference signal N 572, priority level information associated with detected interference control signal N 574)).<br>
[0072]    Broadcast indicator signal generation module 526 generates a broadcast indicator signal indicating an intent to broadcast data, e.g., signal 549. Broadcast indicator signal control module 528 controls the wireless transmitter module 504 to broadcast a generated broadcast indicator signal.

In some embodiments, an interference control signal is a request from another wireless terminal not to broadcast data.<br>
[0074]    In some embodiments, the broadcast indicator signal is transmitted at a first priority level and individual interference control signals detected by the monitoring each have a priority level. In some such embodiments, priority level is associated with position of an air link resource used to carry the signal of interest, e.g., the broadcast indicator signal and/or the interference control signal, in a timing/frequency structure. Broadcast indicator signal priority level determination module 542 determines a priwity level associated with a broadcast indicator signal to be transmitted by the wireless terminal based on a time varying function and/or based on an identifier corresponding to the wireless terminal. For example, wireless terminal 500 may currentiy hold a device identifier associated with broadcast traosanission request air link resources and broadcast request response air link resources. In addition, a recurring tinung structure in use, and known to wireless terminal 500, may implemoit a hopping sequence such that a particular device identifier to be used for broadcast has different priority levels from one slot to another in the timing structure.<br>
 <br>
[0075]    Priority comparison module 534 determines if an interference control signal having a higher priority than the first priority was received, the first priority being the priority level associated with the broadcast indicator signal transmitted by wireless terminal 500. Broadcast decision module 532 makes a decision whether or not to proceed with broadcasting data as a function of the priority comparison module 534 determination.<br>
[0076]    Power measurement module 536 measures the power level of received interference control signals. Broadcast decision module 532 makes a decision \ether or not to proceed with broadcasting data based on tibe power level of at least one received interference control signal having a higher priority than the first priority level when an interference control signal having a first priority level was detected by the response monitoring module 530.<br>

[0079]    Broadcast traffic signaling control module 546 controls the wireless transmitter module 504 to broadcast data in a traffic slot corresponding to a transmitted tnroadcast indicator signal when the decision by the broadcast decision module 532 is a decision to broadcast data.<br>
 <br>

Operation proceeds from step 606 to step 608.<br>
[0082]    In step 608 the first device makes a decision vether or not to transmit an interference control signal as a function of the relative priority of the first and second broadcast indicator signals. Step 608 includes sub-stei» 610,612,614 and 616. In sub-step 610 the first device determines if broadcasting data by the low«: priority one of the second and third device will produce an unacceptable level of interference to the higher priority one of the second and third devices.

 <br>
in the same slot in a recurring timing structure in use, both a second and third device may intend to transmit broadcast traffic signals using the same air link data resource, e.g., the same traffic segment, and each may have transmitted a broadcast indicator signal which was received and detected by the broadcast indicator signal monitoring module 726 and different priorities may be associated with the two different detected broadcast iodicator signals.<br>
[0093]    Interference control signaling decision module 728 makes a decision whether or not to transmit an interference control signal as a function of the relative priority of first and second received detected broadcast indicator signals. Interference tolerance determination sub-module 730 determines if a broadcast by the lower priority one of the second and third devices will produce an unacceptable level of interference to the higher priority one of the second and third devices. In other words, interference tolerance determination sub-module 730 determines if allowing the lower priority device to broadcast data concurrently with the higher priority device is expected to unacceptably impact the successful recovery by wireless terminal 700 of the broadcast data from the higher priority device.<br>
[0094]    Interference control signal generation module 732 generates an interference control signal, e.g., signal 766. In some embodiments, the interference control signal is a signal uistructing at least one lower priority device vsch intends to broadcast to refrain from broadcasting. In some embodiments, the interference control signal is a signal requesting at least one lower priority device which intends to broadcast to refrain from broadcasting. In various embodiments, the interference control signal is a signal communicated using a single tone of an OFDM symbol.<br>
[0095]    Interference control signal control module 734 controls the wireless transmitter module 704 to transmit a generated control interfermce signal when the interference control signaling decision module 728 decides to transmit an interference control signal. Interference control signaling decision module 728 decides to transmit an interference control signal when the interference tolerance determination sub-module 730 determines that the level of interference is unacceptable. The interference control signal control module 734 is configured to control the wireless transmitter module 704 to transmit a generated interference control signal at a priority level corrrapondii to the priority level of the higher priority one of the second and third devices, the second and<br>
 <br>

[0096]    Response resource selection module 736 selects an interference signaling air link resource from a plurality of interference signal transmission resources having the priority level of the higher one of the second and third devices. For example, for a given slot in the recurring structure, corresponding to each broadcast device identifier there is (i) a single broadcast transmission request resource designated to carry a broadcast indicator signal and (ii) a corresponding plurality of broadcast transmission request response resources each of which may be used to carry a interference control signal, and response resource selection module 736 makes a selection of which one of the plurality of broadcast transmission request response resources corresponding to the higher priority device to use to send the control interence signal. In some embodiments, response resource selection module 736 makes its selection pseudo-randomly. In some embodiments, the interference signal transmission resources are individual OFDM tone-symbols, where an OFDM tone-symbol is one ODFM tone for the duration of one OFDM symbol transmission time interval.<br>
[0097]    Broadcast traffic signal recovery module 738 recovers broadcast data signals and information communicated in a traffic segment, e.g., broadcast signals corresponding to the highest piority broadcast indicator signal wch was detected for the slot. Note the recovery may be, and sometimes is, facilitated by transmitto: yielding performed by one or more of the lower priority devices vMch had intended to broadcast during the same slot but which yielded in response to an interference control signal from wireless terminal 700.<br>
[0098]    Recurring timing structure information 740 includes information identifying a plurality of slots supporting broadcast transmission cq)ability, and information identifying air link resources within those slots. Air link resources for an individual slot iiKlude air link resources designated to carry broadcast indicator signals, e.g., broadcast request resources, air link resources designated to carry interference control signals, e.g., broadcast request response resources, and resources designated to carry traffic signals which may include broadcast trafiBc signals, e.g., a traffic segment. Device ID/priority/mdex mformation 742 includes information which associates a particular broadcast device identifier with a particular priority for each of a plisrality of slots in the recurring structure. The priority level associated with a particular broadcast<br>
 <br>
device identifier can be, and sometimes is, different for at least some different slots, e.g., in accordance with a hopping sequence. In some embodiments, priority is associated with position in a resource block, e.g., position of a transmission unit in a broadcast transmission request block and/or position of a transmission unit or set of transmission units in a broadcast transmission request response block. By varying the priority associated with a broadcast device identifier over the recurring timing structure, different devices are afforded the opportunity to be allowed to broadcast where interference occurs, e.g., the same device is not continually blocked via control interference signals.<br>
[0099]    Detected broadcast indicator signals information 744 represents infonnation corresponding to signals detected by broadcast indicator monitoring module 726. Identified highest priority detected broadcast indicator signal 758 includes infonnation identifying one of the signals in information 744. Determined estimated interference 760 is a result of processing by interference tolerance determination sub-module 730. Interference tolerance threshold information 762 is a limit value, e.g., a predetermined stored value, used by interference tolerance detennination sub-module 730, dong with determined estimate interference 760 in making a determination. Interference control signal transmission decision 764 is an output of interference control signaling decision module 728 and used an input by interference control signal control module 734. Information identifymg a set of response resources associated with a highest priority detected broadcast indicator signal 768 is an input of response resource selection module 736, while selected response transmission unit 770 is an output of module 736. Received broadcast traffic signals datanformation 772 is an ouut of broadcast traffic signal recovery module 738.<br>
[0100]    It should be appreciated that, corresp(»)ding to a single broadcast indicator signal associated with a high priority broadcast device identifier, multiple receiver devices may, and sometimes do, decide that allowing a low priority data broadcast data concurrently with a broadcast from that high priority device is unacceptable in terms of being able to recover the higher priority data broadcast In such a situation, the multiple receiver devices, of which device 700 may be one, may each send out a control interference signal. By each receiver device selecting pseudo-randomly one transmission unit fix)m a plurality of transmission units associated with the higher priority device for which to send its control interference signal, the likelihood<br>
 <br>
of collision between two control interference signals is reduced. A collision with construction interference could result in unintended broadcasting devices deciding to refrain from transmitting. A collision with destructive interference could result in a device for which a control interference signal is intended failing to detect the signal and failing to cancel its intended broadcast transmission.<br>
[0101]    Figure 8 is a drawing 800 illustrating an exemplary recurring timing structure used in some embodiments. The exemplary structure of Figure 8 may be using in any of the networks of devices described with respect to Figures 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10 or 11. Drawing 800 illustrates time axis 801 and a plurality of slots (peer discovery slot 802, broadcast/unicast slot 804, unicast slot 806, unicast slot 808, broadcast/unicast slot 810, unicast slot 812,.,., peer discovery slot 814,...). Peer discovery slot 802 is used by wireless peer to peer devices to communicate device identifier signals with one anotiber, establish connections with one another, and/or obtain resources associated with a connection and/or a broadcast opportunity. A broadcast/unicast slot, e.g., slot 804, is structured to support broadcast data traffic signaling and unicast data traffic signaling, e.g., peer to peer unicast data traffic signaling. A unicast slot, e.g., slot 806 is structured to siq)port unicast data traffic signaling, e.g., peer to peer data traffic signaling. In this exemplary embodiment, tha« are more unicast slots than there tax broadcast/unicast slots for one iteration of the recurring timing structure. In some embodiments, the periodicity of broadcast enabled slots is controlled by a system parameter. In some such embodiments, tiie parameter can be changed dynamically during operation to adjust the balance between broadcast/unicast slots and unicast slots to accommodate current needs.<br>
[0102]    Exemplary broadcast unicast/slot 804 includes a broadcast pre-amble air link resource portion 816, a unicast pre-amble air link resource portion 818, a preamble air link resource portion 820, a data air link resource portion 822, and an acknowledgment air link resource portion 824. Broadcast pre-amble 816 includes a broadcast transmission request air link resource portion 826, a broadcast receiver response air link resource portion 828, a unicast transmission request air link resource portion 830, and a unicast receiver transmission requ rewnse air link resource portion 832. In this example, iHoadca transmission requests communicated in broadcast transmission request air link portion 826 have higbo: priority than unicast transmission requests communicated in unicast tranannission request air link resource<br>
 <br>
portion 830. The requests, whether a broadcast request or a unicast request are requests to use the corresponding data air link resource portion in the slot.<br>
[0103]    Broadcast signaling, if requested, takes precedence over unicast signaling for broadcast/unicast slot 804. However, if there is no broadcast traffic in a neighborhood, then the data air link resource portion 822 can be, and sometimes is, used to carry peer to peer unicast traffic signals.<br>
[0104]    Broadcast pre-amble 816 is used for scluling of broadcast traffic to be communicated in data resource 822. Unicast pre-amble 818 is used for schedudii of peer to peer traffic to be communicated in data resource 822. Preamble 822 is used for rate scheduling of peer to peer traffic to be communicated using data resource 822. Preamble 818 in some embodiments, includes resources allocated to pilot signals and resources allocated to channel quality information and/or data rate information signals. Data resource 822 is used to carry broadcast traffic signals and/or peer to peer traffic signals. Acknowledgment resource 824 is used to carry traffic acknowledgments for peer to peer traffic signals when communicated.<br>
[OlOS]    In some embodiments, the pre-amble resource 820 and/or the acknowledgment resource 824 are not used for broadcast signaling purposes. In some embodiments, a broadcast channel is a single rate broadcast channel, e.g., with data coded at a low predetermined rate, and thus the pre-amble portion is not needed nor used to determine and set a broadcast data rate. In some embodiments, a device which intends to broadcast will send out a pilot for unicast receivers to receive and utilize in estimating interference damage. In some embodiments, such a pilot is communicated in preamble 820, while in other embodiments such a pilot may be communicated in another portion, e.g., a discovery signal from the b'oadcast device may be utilized.<br>
[0106]    Broadcast transmission request air link resource portion 826 is used to carry broadcast requests, sometimes alternatively referred to as bnulcast indicator signals, from wireless devices. Broadcast receiver response air link resource 828 is used to carry interference control signals from receivers of the broadcast transmission request signals. Unicast transmission request air link resource 830 is used to carry peer to peer transmission request signals, while unicast receiver transmission request response air link resource 832 is used to carry transmission request response signals in response to received peer to peer transmission request signals.<br>
 <br>
[0107]    In some embodiments, a different structure is utilized for the broadcast/unicast slot. For example, in another exemplary embodiment, a structure is used in which the broadcast transmission request resource is joined with the unicast transmission request resource, e.g., in one block, and then the block is followed by a request response resource block.<br>
[0108]    Figure 9 illustrates exemplary broadcast transmission request air link resource 826 and exemplary broadcast receiver response air link resource 828 in more detail. In this exemplary embodiment regarding broadcasting, more resources are allocated to response resources than to request resources. Exemplary broadcast request resource 826 includes 12 individual transmission request units, each associated with a different broadcast connection identifier. For example for this particular slot, broadcast transmission request transmission unit 902 is associated with broadcast identifier 2, while broadcast transmission request unit 904 is associated with broadcast identifier 5. Each position within the broadcast transmission request air link resource 826 is associated with a priority, e.g., a different priority. In this example, transmission unit 902 has higher priority than transmission unit 904. In some embodiments, fixun one broadcast/unicast slot to another broadcast/unicast slot, ibs priority associated with a particular t»x}adcast device identifio* changes, e.g., in {wcordance with a hopping sequence which maps the l»:oadcast identifier to differrat transmission unit location within the broadcast transmission request resources.<br>
[0109]    Broadcast receiver response resource 828 includes sets of transmission units associated with each broadcast device identifier. For example, corresponding to broadcast device identifier 2, there are six transmission units (906,908,910,912,914, 916) allocated to carry control interference signals. Similariy, corresponding to broadcast device identifier S, there are six transmission units (918,920,922,924,926, 928) allocated to carry control interference signals. Priority is also associated with the different device identifiers withm the resource 828.<br>
[0110]    Figure 10 includes a drawmg 1000 illustrating exemplary signaling in a region of a peer to peer network in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. In the example, of Figure 10, assume t the broadcast transmission request resource 826 and the broadcast receiver response resource 828 described with respect to Figures 8 and 9 are utilized. In this example, WT A 1001 and WT A' 1003 want to broadcast data in the same air link data resource 822. Assume that WT A 1001 currently holds broadcast<br>
 <br>
connection identifier 2 associated with broadcast request transmission unit 902 and broadcast receiver response transmission units (906,908,910,912,914,916). Assume that WT A' 1002 currently holds broadcast connection identifier 5 associated with broadcast request transmission unit 904 and broadcast receiver response transmission units (918,920,922,924,926,928). Assume that for this slot the broadcast request associated with connection identifier 2 has higher priority tiian &amp;e broadcast request associated with connection identifier 5.<br>
[Dili]    WT A 1001 generates broadcast transmission request signal 1002 vMch is communicated using transmission unit 902. The broadcast request signal 1002 is received and recovered by WT B 1005, WT C 1007. and WT D 1009. WT A' 1003 generates broadcast transmission request signal 1004 which is received and recovered by WT B 1005. WT C 1007 and WT D 1009 are sufficiently far enough away from WT A' 1003 so that they do not detect tiie broadcast request signal 1004 from WT A' 1003 or detect it at such a low power level that it does not provide an interference problem with regard to receiving broadcast signals from WT A1001.<br>
101121 WT B 1005 decides that it would like WT A' 1003 to refrain from broadcasting since from WT B's receiver perspective, concurrrat broadcast signals from WT A' 1003 will unacceptably interfere with its reception of broadcast signals fix&gt;m WT A 1001 which has higher priority. Therefore, WT B 1005 selects, e.g., randomly one of the response transmission units from the set of transmission units associated with WT A (906,908,910,912,914,916). In this case WT B 1005 selects to use transmission unit 910. WT B 1005 generates and transmits interference control signal 1006 using air link resource transmission unit 910.<br>
(0113]    WT A 1001 monitors for interference control signals on resources associated with higher priority than its own priority level. WT A 1001 does not detect any such interference control signals so it determines that it is ok to proceed with its intended broadcast.<br>
[0114]    WT A' 1003 monitors for interference control signals on resources associated with higher priority than its own priority level, and detects interference control signal 1006 on resource 910. The interference control signal 1006 is received by WT A' 1003 at a level above a threshold. Therefore, WT A' 1003 determines that it is not permitted to broadcast data, and refrains from broadcasting a traffic signal in data resource 822.<br>
 <br>
[0115]    WT A 1001 transmits broadcast traffic signal 1008 in data resource 822 which is successfully received and recovered by WT B 1005, WT C 1007 and WT D 1009.<br>
[0116]    Figure 11 includes a drawing 1100 illustrating exemplary signaling in a region of a peer to peer network in accordance with an exemplary embodiment. In the example, of Figure 11, assume that the broadcast transmission request resource 826 and the broadcast receiver response resource 828 described with respect to Figures 8 and 9 are utilized. In this example, WT A 1101 and WT A 1103 want to broadcast data in the same air link data resource 822. Assume that WT A 1101 currently holds broadcast connection identifier 2 associated with broadcast request transmission unit 902 and broadcast receiver response transmission units (906,908,910,912,914,916). Assume that WT A' 1102 currently holds broadcast connection identifier 5 associated with broadcast request transmission unit 904 and broadcast receiver response transmission units (918,920,922,924,926,928). Assume that for this slot the broadcast request associated with connection identifier 2 has higher priority than the broadcast request associated with connection identifier 5.<br>
[0117]    WT A 1101 generates broadcast transmission request signal 1102 which is communicated usmg transmission unit 902. The broadcast request ngnal 1102 is received and recovered by WT B 1105, WT C 1107, and WT D 1109. WT A 1103 generates broadcast transmission request signal 1104 which is received and recovered by WT B 1105 and WT C 1107. WT D 1109 is sufficiently far enough away fix)m WT A 1103 so that it does not detect the broadcast request signal 1104 fi«m WT A' 1103 or detects it at such a low power level that it does not provide an interfermce problem with regard to receiving broadcast signals from WT A 1101.<br>
[0118] WT B 1105 decides that it would like WT A 1103 to refiin fit)m broadcasting since from WT B's receiver perspective, concurrent broadcast signals finm WT A 1103 will unacceptably interfere with its reception of broadcast signals from WT A1101 which has higher priority. Therefore, WT B 1105 selects, e.g., randomly one of the response transmission units fix&gt;m the set of transmission units associated with WT A (906,908,910,912,914,916). In this case WT B 1105 selects to use transmission unit 910. WT B 1105 generates and transmits interference control signal 1106 using air link resource transmission unit 910.<br>
 <br>
[0119] WT C 1107 decides that it would like WT A' 1103 to refrain from broadcasting since from WT Cs receiver perspective, concurrent broadcast signals from WT A' 1103 will unacceptably interfere with its recq)tion of broadcast signals fix)m WT A 1101 which has higher priority. Therefore, WT C 1107 selects, e.g., randomly one of the response transmission units from the set of transmission units associated with WT A (906,908,910,912,914,916). In this case WT C 1107 selects to use transmission unit 914. WT C 1107 generates and transmits mterference control signal 1108 using air link resource transmission unit 914.<br>
[0120]    WT A 1101 monitors for interference control signals on resources associated with higher priority than its own priority level. WT A 1101 does not detect any such interference control signals so it determines that it is ok to proceed with its intended broadcast.<br>
[0121]    WT A' 1103 monitors for interference control signals on resources associated with higher priority than its own priority level, and detects interference control signal 1106 on resource 910 and interference control signal 1108 on resource 914. WT A' 1103 compares each of the received detected higher priority interinrence c(Mitrol signals to a threshold. In this example, at least one of the detected higher priority control signals exceeds a threshold. Therefore, WT A' 1103 decides not to broadcast data, and refrains from broadcasting a traffic signal in data resource 822.<br>
[0122]    WT A 1101 transmits broadcast traffic signal 1110 in data resource 822 which is successfully received and recovered by WT B 1105, WT C 1107 and WT D 1109.<br>
