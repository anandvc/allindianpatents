FIELD OF TECHNOLOGY<br>
This invention relates to the field of wireless mobile ad-hoc networks. Further, this invention relates to device handover procedure for wireless personal area networks that are based on wireless mobile ad-hoc networks. Particularly, this invention relates to the effective mechanisms of handing over the device from child piconet to parent piconet and parent piconet to child piconet in the centralized wireless personal area networks. More particularly, this invention encompasses a system and method for device handover in wireless personal area networks based on ultra wide band (UWB) systems.<br>
DESCRIPTION OF RELATED ART<br>
The wireless personal area networks are defined to operate in the personal operating space, i.e. at a distance of approximately 10 meters. The IEEE (http://www.ieee.org) is involved in defining standards for such wireless personal area networks. The Ultra Wide Band (UWB) technology can provide data rates exceeding several hundreds of Mbps in this personal operating space. Medium Access Control mechanisms to deal with such high data rates are currently being discussed in IEEE draft P802.15.3/D17. The medium access control mechanisms broadly include how a device may join the network, how it can transfer data at the required rate to another device, how the medium is best used etc.<br>
Figure 1 illustrates the IEEE-802.15.3 based wireless personal area network. It involves a network referred as piconet, in which a device may act as coordinator (referred as piconet coordinator or PNC herein). The PNC performs the functions of allowing a device (referred as DEV) to join, allocating it a channel (time slot) to transmit to another device, synchronization mechanisms etc. This is a centralized WPAN system which is formed in an ad-hoc fashion.<br>
Dependant piconet is a piconet that exists entirely within a channel time allocation<br><br>
of another piconet, the parent piconet. Child piconet is a subtype of dependant piconet that exists entirely within a channel time allocation of another piconet, the parent piconet, is controlled by a device that is a member of the parent piconet. Neighbor piconet is also a subtype of dependant piconet that exists entirely within a channel time allocation of another piconet, the parent piconet, is controlled by a device that is not a member of the parent piconet.<br>
A child piconet is one that is formed under an established piconet. The established piconet then becomes the parent piconet. The child piconet functionality is useful for either extending the area of coverage of the piconet or shifting some computational or memory requirements to another PNC capable device. It is possible for the parent piconet to have more than one child piconet. In addition, it is also possible for a child PNC to allow a child piconet as a part of its own piconet.<br>
The child piconet uses a distinct piconet ID (PNID) and acts as an autonomous piconet except that it is dependent on a private CTA from the parent piconet. Association and security membership for the child piconet are handled within the child piconet and do not involve the parent PNC.<br>
The child PNC is a member of the parent piconet and thus is able to exchange data with any DEV in the parent piconet. The child PNC is also a member of the child piconet and thus is able to exchange data with any DEV in the child piconet.<br>
The invention also considers the Indian patent application bearing application No. 221/CHE/2004 titled "SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR MEDIUM ACCESS CONTROL IN WIRELESS MOBILE AD-HOC NETWORKS" as part of current art. Superframe structure described in that patent document is an enhanced superframe which is specified in IEEE draft P802.15.3/D17.<br>
Figure 2 illustrates the superframe structure. Superframe is channel distribution specified by the PNC among the DEVs in piconet. It is informed to DEVs through beacon frame, which is being broadcasted by PNC.<br><br>
Superframe is composed of 3 parts:<br>
1.	Beacon: It is used to set the timing allocations and to communicate management Information for the piconet. All the associated devices listen to this beacon.<br>
2.	Contention access period (CAP): It is used to communicate commands from the DEV to PNC or vice versa. It may also be used for asynchronous data if it is present in the superframe. The length of the CAP is determined by the PNC and communicated to the DEVs in the piconet via the beacon. The CAP uses CSMA/CA protocol for the medium access.<br>
3.	Channel time allocation period (CTAP): It consists of channel time allocations (CTAs), including management CTAs (MCTAs). CTAs are used for commands, isochronous streams and asynchronous data connections. A PNC may choose to use MCTAs instead of the CAP for sending command frames, unless otherwise restricted by the physical layer (PHY). An open MCTA is one where the SrcID is the BcstID; Any DEV that is associated in the piconet may attempt to send a command frame to the PNC in an open MCTA. An MCTA with the UnassocID as the SrcID is an association MCTA. Any DEV not currently associated in the piconet may attempt to send an Association Request command to the PNC in an association MCTA.<br>
Device Access Period (DAP): DAP is used by all the associated DEVs in piconet to send their respective heart beat frames. By listening to the heart beat frames as contained in DAP, it is possible for a first associated device to know exactly whether a second associated device is in range(reachable) or not, depending upon whether the first associated device was able to listen to the heart beat frame sent by the second associated device in the DAP.<br>
The CTAP, in contrast to CAP, uses a standard TDMA protocol where the devices (DEVs) have specified time windows which are called the CTAs.<br><br>
MCTAs are either assigned to a specific source/destination pair for management traffic and use TDMA for access or they are shared MCTAs that are accessed using the slotted aloha protocol.<br>
Beacon frame is illustrated in figure 3. Information Elements (lEs) in figure 3 are encoded in type, length, value format. The lEs in the beacon payload may appear in any order except for the channel time allocation (CTA) lEs, which is the first IE of the beacon payload following the piconet synchronization parameters field. CTA IE consists of information about the CTAs in the superframe. Figure 4 shows the structure of ADIE.<br>
Heart beat frame is a very small MAC frame which is always broadcasted by all the associated DEVs in the piconet. Format of the heart beat frame in the current art is illustrated in figure 5. One of purpose of the heart beat frame is to advertise its own presence of its neighbors and PNC.<br>
Associated Devices Information Element (ADIE) is broadcasted by the PNC to all the devices in the piconet. Usage of the ADIE is to provide the information to all the devices to schedule their heart beat frames in DAP. This information element must be sent with beacon if there is at least one device associated with the PNC.<br>
LIMITATIONS<br>
The present state of art in this field, as discussed in IEEE 802.15.3 (http://www.ieee.org) and as described in above mentioned patent, has certain limitations, namely, there is no mechanism when a device in child piconet is also in range of parent piconet and can effectively become a part of parent piconet and release resources for child PNC. Consequently, if there is no device left in child piconet then operation of child piconet can be terminated. Also, there is no mechanism for joining a child piconet by a device, when device in parent piconet<br><br>
moves out of the range of the parent PNC but still in range of child PNC. Stating same at broad level, there is no mechanism for device handover from child to parent piconet and parent to child piconet in current art.<br>
Currently in the medium access control mechanism as defined in current art; there is no mechanism for the following:<br>
1.	When device in child piconet is in radio range of parent piconet also, then there is no mechanism, that parent PNC can take over the device, associate the device with itself (Parent PNC) and child PNC can disassociate the device from itself (Child PNC);<br>
2.	When device in parent piconet moves out of the radio range of parent PNC, but if it is still in range of child PNC of the parent piconet, then there is no mechanism for child to become a part of child piconet without disassociation because of ATP timeout and scanning procedure again; and<br>
3.	In other words, current art does not provide the method for device handover from child to parent PNC and parent to child PNC.<br>
OBJECTS OF THE INVENTION<br>
The primary object of the invention is to provide a system and method for device handover from child to parent PNC and parent to child PNC in medium access control for the UWB wireless personal area networks, which are based on wireless ad-hoc networks, in a centralized network topology.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a mechanism where the device in child piconet is in radio range of the parent PNC then parent PNC and child PNC can communicate with each other and parent PNC can take over the charge of the device and child PNC can disassociate the device from child piconet.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide the mechanism for device handover from child to parent PNC, in which device does not require disassociating itself from<br><br>
child PNC by initiating disassociation process, it does not require scanning and it does not require sending association request for associating itself with parent PNC.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide a mechanism for where the device moves out of the radio range of the parent PNC but it is still in radio range of the child PNC, then parent PNC and child PNC can communicate with each other and child PNC can take over the charge of the device and parent PNC can disassociate the device from parent PNC.<br>
It is another object of the invention to provide the mechanism for device handover from parent to child PNC, in which device does not require to disassociate itself from parent PNC because of ATP timeout.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system that provides the mechanism of device handover from child to parent piconet and parent to child piconet in the Wireless Personal Area Networks based on mobile ad-hoc networks.<br>
In detail, the present invention provides the mechanism of device handover from child to parent and vice versa, without device to be disassociated from its PNC, so this handover is handled by coordination between child and parent PNCs.<br>
The present invention comprises of system and method which would overcome the inability of device handover with current art, in the following manner:<br>
There are two scenarios for device handover. One is device handover from child to parent PNC and other is device handover from parent to child PNC.<br>
1.  Device handover from Child to Parent PNC<br><br>
Figure 6 displays the topology for child to parent PNC handover of the device which is part of child PNC, and also it is in range of parent PNC.<br>
The present invention uses some mechanisms provided by current art to achieve the objectives of invention, so parent PNC is able to hear the heart beat of the device which is in range of parent PNC.<br>
The mechanism of the present invention defines new signaling and proposes that parent PNC sends device handover request to child PNC. According to the current art, child PNC is always in range of parent PNC and also it is a part of parent piconet so can communicate with parent PNC. The present invention proposes the mechanism wherein the parent PNC will send a new device ID for the device, which is going to be a part of parent, which is part of child PNC currently.<br>
The present invention provides the mechanism that, child PNC sends device handover information to the device which is part of child PNC and is range in parent PNC, also it informs in which superframe this handover will be complete.<br>
The present invention provides the mechanism that, child PNC sends device handover Response to the parent PNC, if device handover information is sent successfully.<br>
According to the present invention, in specified superframe, the device will be part of parent PNC and considered to be disassociated from child PNC.<br>
The present invention suggests that if there are no devices in child piconet, other than child PNC then child PNC should stop the operation and should work as a device of the parent PNC.<br>
2.  Device handover from Parent to Child PNC<br><br>
Figure 7 displays the topology for parent to child PNC handover of the device which is no more able to hear the beacons from parent PNC because of movement, and now it is in range of child PNC.<br>
The present invention uses some of mechanisms provided by the current art to achieve the objectives of the invention, so the present invention proposes that the parent PNC announces about device which has moved out of range, but that device can be there in range of child PNC.<br>
The present invention provides a mechanism for device to join child PNC, device is there in range of child PNC, so child PNC is able to hear the heart beat of the device, so child PNC associates the device because that device is known to child PNC, because of information provided by parent PNC about moved out devices.<br>
According to the present invention, device becomes part of child piconet and parent PNC broadcasts the information that device is disassociated from parent PNC.<br>
The present invention also defines the content for the messages required for signaling the above mentioned handover procedures. Additional messages are introduced by invention are Device Handover Request, Device Handover Response and Device Handover Information Request. The present invention also introduces one Information Element named Device Moved IE for broadcast of the information of moved out devices from the range of the PNC.<br>
The present invention also defines the message sequence for performing device handover in above described scenarios.<br><br>

(a)	sending device handover request command by parent PNC to child PNC with information of parent piconet ID, and DEVID of the device and new suggested DEVID for the device;<br>
(b)	sending device handover information request command to the device by the child PNC with information of handover if the device is free;<br>
(c)	sending device handover response command to parent PNC by the child PNC with response of SUCCESS and information of handover if device handover information request is sent properly; and<br>
(d)	disassociating the device from child PNC and associating to parent PNC at the specified superframe number.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention further comprises a method of device handover from parent PNC to child PNC in the centralized wireless personal area networks based on mobile ad-hoc networks comprising the steps of:<br>
(a)	broadcasting the information of DEVID and Device Address of the devices which are likely to move out of its range by parent PNC;<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
The present invention relates to a system that allows a device handover from child to parent PNC and parent to child PNC in the Centralized Wireless Personal Area Networks based on mobile ad-hoc networks.<br>
The system and method of the present invention comprises of new frames for signaling of the device handover procedure, which includes Device Handover Request, Device Handover Response and Device Handover Information Request.<br>
The system and method of the present invention also comprises of a new information element for broadcasting the information of the device which are moved out of the range of the PNC, named Device Moved Information Element.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides the better reachability for the devices in a piconet.<br>
Accordingly, the invention provides the basic backbone for Mesh Networking.<br>
Accordingly, the invention also facilitates child PNC to stop its operation, if there are no devices under child PNC, because of handover of its devices to parent PNC.<br>
The subsequent subsections describe the invented individual procedures for invention.<br>
1.  Figure 8 illustrates the proposed MSC for device handover from child PNC to parent PNC.<br>
-	As described in topology in figure 6, device is a part of child piconet, but it is also in range of parent PNC. Because of topology parent PNC is able to hear the heart beat from the device.<br>
-	According to the invented mechanism, parent PNC sends Device Handover Request Command to child PNC with information of Parent<br><br>
piconet ID, and DEVID of the device and new suggested DEVID for the device. Parent PNC had learnt the DEVID of the device under child PNC by listening to its heart beats. Parent PNC expects an immediate acknowledgement for the command message sent to child PNC.<br>
-	Child PNC checks that device, which is considered for handover by parent PNC is free to be handed over. If yes then child PNC sends Device Handover Information Request Command to the device with information of handover, some of them which child PNC had got from parent PNC. This information includes new piconet ID, new DEVID and superframe number when actual handover to be done and device will become part of parent piconet. Child PNC expects immediate acknowledge for the Device Handover Information Request Command.<br>
-	If device is busy and cannot be handed over then child PNC does not send Device Handover Information command to the device, also it sends Device Handover Response command with the response of FAILURE to parent PNC with appropriate reason code.<br>
-	If Device Handover Information Request is sent properly then child PNC will send Device Handover Response command to parent PNC with response of SUCCESS and information of handover. This information includes new suggested DEVID, device address of the device which is going to be handed over, superframe number in which device will be considered to be handed over. Child PNC also expects the immediate acknowledgement for this message.<br>
-	According to the present invention, at the specified superframe number, the device is considered to be disassociated from child PNC and considered to be associated to parent PNC. In the same superframe parent PNC sends its beacon with information of association of the device with parent PNC and similarly child PNC sends its beacon with information of disassociation of the device from<br><br>
child PNC.<br>
-	Parent PNC starts device handover timeout timer, when it had started<br>
the Device Handover Process. If it could not be done by the device<br>
handover timeout then it should be terminated, and if it is over by the<br>
time then timer should be stopped.<br>
2.  Figure 9 illustrates the proposed MSC for device handover from parent PNC to child PNC.<br>
-	As described in topology in figure 7, device is moved out of parent piconet, but it is still in range of child PNC, which is part of parent piconet. In this situation according to invented system, parent PNC broadcasts the information of DEVID and Device Address of the devices which are likely to move out of its range.<br>
-	As described in invented method above, the child PNC is aware of the DEVID and device address pair which are moved out from parent PNC. Also device is in range of child PNC, so child PNC is able to hear heart beat of device. By this heart beat child PNC can find out the DEVID of the device and PNID for that device, also by using the information provided by parent PNC, child PNC can conclude that device is known device, which is moved out from parent PNC's range or some alien device.<br>
-	If device is known device then child PNC sends Device Handover Information Request command to the device with information of new DEVID, new PNID and superframe number when handover actually is going to happen. This information command will be sent with PNID of the parent PNID because device is still part of parent piconet. Child PNC expects an immediate acknowledge for this command.<br>
-	If Device Handover Information Request is sent properly then child PNC will send Device Handover Response command to parent PNC with response of SUCCESS and information of handover. This information includes new suggested DEVID, device address of the device which is going to be handed over, superframe number in which<br><br>
device will be considered to be handed over. Child PNC also expects the immediate acknowledgement for this message. According to the invention, at the specified superframe number, the device is considered to be disassociated from parent PNC and considered to be associated to child PNC. In the same superframe child PNC sends its beacon with information of association of the device with child PNC and similarly parent PNC sends its beacon with information of disassociation of the device from parent PNC. Parent PNC starts device handover timeout timer, when it had started the Device Handover Process, means when parent PNC had sent its first beacon with information of the device which is supposed to be moved out. If it could not be done by the device handover timeout then it should stop sending that information in beacon and should consider that device being disassociated, and if it procedure is over with SUCCESS or FAILURE by the time then timer should be stopped.<br>
The subsequent subsections describe the additional entities introduced to effect the invention.<br>
1. Device Handover Request<br>
This command is proposed by invention to perform the invented signaling mechanism for device handover. Following are the elements which are part of newly invented Device Handover Request command.<br>
-	Old DEVID: The Old DEVID is the DEVID of the device, when it is a member of child piconet.<br>
-	New DEVID: The New DEVID is the DEVID of the device, when it would be a member of parent piconet.<br>
-	ATP: The ATP is association timeout period for the device, when it would join to parent piconet.<br>
The Source ID for this command is to be set to PNCID of parent PNC.<br><br>
The Destination ID for this command is to be set to DEVID of the device in parent piconet, which is also working as a child piconet's PNC.<br>
2.	Device Handover Response<br>
This command is also proposed by invention to perform the invented signaling mechanism for device handover. Following are the elements which are part of newly invented Device Handover Response command.<br>
-	Old DEVID: The Old DEVID is the DEVID of the device before handover process is over.<br>
-	Device Address: It is the MAC address of the device, whose DEVID is specified as Old DEVID.<br>
-	Handover Beacon Number: The Handover beacon number is the beacon number of the parent PNC, when the actual handover process will happen.<br>
-	Reason Code: If process is successful then reason code as SUCCESS, else appropriate reason code as FAILURE<br>
The Source ID is to be set to DEVID of the device in parent piconet, which is also working as a child piconet's PNC. The Destination ID is to be set to PNCID of parent PNC.<br>
3.	Device Handover Information Request<br>
This command is also proposed by invention to perform the invented signaling mechanism for device handover. Following are the elements which are part of newly invented Device Handover Information Request command.<br>
-	New PNID: It is PNID of parent piconet in case of child to parent device handover, and it is PNID of child piconet in case of parent to child device handover.<br>
-	New DEVID: The New DEVID is the DEVID of the device, when device will be handed over.<br>
-	ATP: The ATP is association timeout period for the device, when it would be handed over.<br>
-	Handover beacon number: It is the beacon number of the child PNC,<br><br>
when the device will be under control of the parent PNC, and beacon number of parent PNC, when the device will be under control of the child PNC.<br>
The source ID is to be set to DEVID of the device.<br>
The destination should be set to PNCID of the child PNC.<br>
4.  Device Moved Information Element<br>
This invented information element named Device Moved IE is sent by the PNC along with its beacon, which contains the information about DEVID and Device Address of the all devices which are supposed to be moved out from the range of PNC, and PNC is able to find out these devices because it would not hear the heart beat from those devices.
