				<td>AN IMMUNOGENIC COMPOSITION<br>
The present invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions and methods for inducing<br>
an immune response against tumours-related antigens. More specifically, the invention<br>
relates to polynucleotides, herein referred to as CASB7439 polynucleotides, polypeptides<br>
encoded thereby (referred to herein as CASB7439 polypeptides), recombinant materials<br>
and methods for their production.. In another aspect, the invention relates to methods for<br>
using such polypeptides and polynucleotides, including the treatment of cancer, more<br>
particularly colorectal cancer, and autoimmune diseases and other related conditions. In<br>
another aspect, the invention relates to pharmaceutical compositions containing<br>
CASB7439 polypeptides and polynucleotides, to methods of manufacture of such<br>
compositions and to their use in medicine. In a further aspect, the invention relates to<br>
methods for identifying agonists and antagonists/inhibitors using the materials provided<br>
by the invention, and treating conditions associated with CASB7439 polypeptide<br>
imbalance with the identified compounds. In a still further aspect, the invention relates to<br>
diagnostic assays for detecting diseases associated with inappropriate CASB7439<br>
polypeptide activity or levels.<br>
Polypeptides and polynucleotides of the present invention are believed to be important<br>
immunogens for specific prophylactic or therapeutic immunization against tumours, because<br>
they are specifically expressed or highly over-expressed in tumours compared to normal<br>
cells and can thus be targeted by antigen-specific immune mechanisms leading to the<br>
destruction of the tumour cell. They can also be used to diagnose the occurrence of tumour<br>
cells. Furthermore, their inappropriate expression in certain circumstances can cause an<br>
induction of autoimmune, inappropriate immune responses, which could be corrected<br>
through appropriate vaccination using the same polypeptides or polynucleotides. In this<br>
respect the most important biological activities to our purpose are the antigenic and<br>
immunogenic activities of the polypeptide of the present invention. A polypeptide of the<br>
present invention may also exhibit at least one other biological activity of a CASB7439<br>
polypeptide, which could qualify it as a target for therapeutic or prophylactic intervention<br>
different from that linked to the immune response.<br>
In a first aspect, the present invention relates to CASB7439 polypeptides. Such peptides<br>
include isolated polypeptides, comprising an amino acid sequence which has at least 70%<br>
identity, preferably at least 80% identity, more preferably at least 90% identity, yet more<br>
preferably at least 95% identity, most preferably at least 97-99% identity, to that of SEQ<br>
ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID<br>
NO: 12 or SEQ ID NO: 14 over the entire length of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ<br>
ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12 or SEQ ID NO: 14<br>
respectively, with the proviso that said isolated polypeptide is not SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ<br>
ID NO: 12 or SEQ ID NO: 14- Such polypeptides include those comprising the amino<br>
acid of SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO: 10 and SEQ ID NO: 11-<br>
Further peptides of the present invention include isolated polypeptides, in which the<br>
amino acid sequence has at least 70% identity, preferably at least 80% identity, more<br>
preferably at least 90% identity, yet more preferably at least 95% identity, most<br>
preferably at least 97-99% identity, to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO "2 SEQ<br>
ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12 or SEQ ID<br>
NO: 14 over the entire length of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID<br>
NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12 or SEQ ID NO: 14 respectively, with the<br>
proviso that said isolated polypeptide is not SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO: 12 or SEQ ID<br>
NO: 14- Such polypeptides include the polypeptides of SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7,<br>
SEQ ID NO: 10 and SEQ ID NO: 11.<br>
Preferably the aforementioned polypeptides are recombinantly produced. Most preferably<br>
the polypeptides according to the invention are purified, and are substantially free of any<br>
other proteins or contaminating host-originating material.<br>
Further peptides of the present invention include isolated polypeptides encoded by a<br>
polynucleotide comprising the sequence contained in SEQ ID NO:1.<br>
The invention also provides an immunogenic fragment of a CASB7439 polypeptide, that is a<br>
contiguous portion of the CASB7439 polypeptide which has the same or similar<br>
immunogenic properties to the polypeptide comprising the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID<br>
NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12<br>
or SEQ ID NO: 14- That is to say, the fragment (if necessary when coupled to a carrier or<br>
as part of a larger fusion protein) is capable of raising an immune response which recognises<br>
the CASB7439 polypeptide. Such an immunogenic fragment may include, for example, the<br>
CASB7439 polypeptide lacking an N-terminal leader sequence, a transmembrane domain or<br>
a C-terminal anchor domain. In a preferred aspect the immunogenic fragment of<br>
CASB7439 according to the invention comprises substantially all of the extracellular<br>
domain of a polypeptide which has at least 70% identity, preferably at least 80% identity,<br>
more preferably at least 90% identity, yet more preferably at least 95% identity, most<br>
preferably at least 97-99% identity, to that of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID<br>
NO:7, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12 or SEQ ID NO: 14 over the<br>
entire length of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID<br>
NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12 or SEQ ID NO: 14, respectively- Preferably an immunogenic<br>
fragment according to the invention comprises at least one epitope.<br>
Peptide fragments incorporating an epitope of CASB7439 typically will comprise at least<br>
7, preferably 9 or 10 contiguous amino acids from SEQ ID NO:2. Preferred epitopes are<br>
shown in SEQ ID NO: 16 to SEQ ID NO:33.<br>
Peptides that incorporate these epitopes form a preferred aspect of the present invention.<br>
Mimotopes which have the same characteristics as these epitopes, and immunogens<br>
comprising such mimotopes which generate an immune response which cross-react with<br>
an epitope in the context of the CASB7439 molecule, also form part of the present<br>
invention.<br>
The present invention, therefore, includes isolated peptides encompassing these epitopes<br>
themselves, and any mimotope thereof. The meaning of mimotope is defined as an entity<br>
which is sufficiently similar to the native CASB7439 epitope so as to be capable of being<br>
recognised by antibodies which recognise the native molecule; (Gheysen, H.M., et al.,<br>
1986, Synthetic peptides as antigens. Wiley, Chichester, Ciba foundation symposium<br>
119, pl30-149; Gheysen, H.M., 1986, Molecular Immunology, 23,7, 709-715); or are<br>
capable of raising antibodies, when coupled to a suitable carrier, which antibodies cross-<br>
react with the native molecule.<br>
Peptide mimotopes of the above-identified epitopes may be designed for a particular<br>
purpose by addition, deletion or substitution of elected amino acids. Thus, the peptides of<br>
the present invention may be modified for the purposes of ease of conjugation to a protein<br>
carrier. For example, it may be desirable for some chemical conjugation methods to<br>
include a terminal cysteine to the epitope. In addition it may be desirable for peptides<br>
conjugated to a protein carrier to include a hydrophobic terminus distal from the<br>
conjugated terminus of the peptide, such that the free unconjugated end of the peptide<br>
remains associated with the surface of the carrier protein. This reduces the<br>
conformational degrees of freedom of the peptide, and thus increases the probability that<br>
the peptide is presented in a conformation which most closely resembles that of the<br>
peptide as found in the context of the whole molecule. For example, the peptides may be<br>
altered to have an N-terminal cysteine and a C-terminal hydrophobic amidated tail.<br>
Alternatively, the addition or substitution of a D-stereoisomer form of one or more of the<br>
amino acids may be performed to create a beneficial derivative, for example to enhance<br>
stability of the peptide. Those skilled in the art will realise that such modified peptides, or<br>
mimotopes, could be a wholly or partly non-peptide mimotope wherein the constituent<br>
residues are not necessarily confined to the 20 naturally occurring amino acids. In<br>
addition, these may be cyclised by techniques known in the art to constrain the peptide<br>
into a conformation that closely resembles its shape when the peptide sequence is in the<br>
context of the whole molecule. A preferred method of cyclising a peptide comprises the<br>
addition of a pair of cysteine residues to allow the formation of a disulphide bridge.<br>
Further, those skilled in the art will realise that mimotopes or immunogens of the present<br>
invention may be larger than the above-identified epitopes, and as such may comprise the<br>
sequences disclosed herein. Accordingly, the mimotopes of the present invention may<br>
consist of addition of N and/or C terminal extensions of a number of other natural<br>
residues at one or both ends. The peptide mimotopes may also be retro sequences of the<br>
natural sequences, in that the sequence orientation is reversed; or alternatively the<br>
sequences may be entirely or at least in part comprised of D-stereo isomer amino acids<br>
(inverso sequences). Also, the peptide sequences may be retro-inverso in character, in<br>
that the sequence orientation is reversed and the amino acids are of the D-stereoisomer<br>
form. Such retro or retro-inverso peptides have the advantage of being non-self, and as<br>
such may overcome problems of self-tolerance in the immune system.<br>
Alternatively, peptide mimotopes may be identified using antibodies which are capable<br>
themselves of binding to the epitopes of the present invention using techniques such as<br>
phage display technology (EP 0 552 267 B1). This technique, generates a large number of<br>
peptide sequences which mimic the structure of the native peptides and are, therefore,<br>
capable of binding to anti-native peptide antibodies, but may not necessarily themselves<br>
share significant sequence homology to the native peptide. This approach may have<br>
significant advantages by allowing the possibility of identifying a peptide with enhanced<br>
immunogenic properties, or may overcome any potential self-antigen tolerance problems<br>
which may be associated with the use of the native peptide sequence. Additionally this<br>
technique allows the identification of a recognition pattern for each native-peptide in<br>
terms of its shared chemical properties amongst recognised mimotope sequences.<br>
The covalent coupling of the peptide to the immunogenic carrier can be carried out in a<br>
manner well known in the art. Thus, for example, for direct covalent coupling it is<br>
possible to utilise a carbodiimide, glutaraldehyde or (N-[?-maleimidobutyryloxy]<br>
succinimide ester, utilising common commercially available heterobifunctional linkers<br>
such as CDAP and SPDP (using manufacturers instructions). After the coupling reaction,<br>
the immunogen can easily be isolated and purified by means of a dialysis method, a gel<br>
filtration method, a fractionation method etc.<br>
The types of carriers used in the immunogens of the present invention will be readily<br>
known to the man skilled in the art. The function of the carrier is to provide cytokine help<br>
in order to help induce an immune response against the peptide. A non-exhaustive list of<br>
carriers which may be used in the present invention include: Keyhole limpet<br>
Haemocyanin (KLH), serum albumins such as bovine serum albumin (BSA), inactivated<br>
bacterial toxins such as tetanus or diptheria toxins (TT and DT), or recombinant<br>
fragments thereof (for example, Domain 1 of Fragment C of TT, or the translocation<br>
domain of DT), or the purified protein derivative of tuberculin (PPD). Alternatively the<br>
mimotopes or epitopes may be directly conjugated to liposome carriers, which may<br>
additionally comprise immunogens capable of providing T-cell help. Preferably the ratio<br>
of mimotopes to carrier is in the order of 1:1 to 20:1, and preferably each carrier should<br>
carry between 3-15 peptides.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention a preferred carrier is Protein D from Haemophilus<br>
influenzae (EP 0 594 610 Bl). Protein D is an IgD-binding protein from Haemophilus<br>
influenzae and has been patented by Forsgren (WO 91/18926, granted EP 0 594 610 Bl).<br>
In some circumstances, for example in recombinant immunogen expression systems it<br>
may be desirable to use fragments of protein D, for example Protein D l/3rd (comprising<br>
the N-terminal 100-110 amino acids of protein D (GB 9717953.5)).<br>
Another preferred method of presenting the peptides of the present invention is in the<br>
context of a recombinant fusion molecule. For example, EP 0 421 635 B describes the use<br>
of chimaeric hepadnavirus core antigen particles to present foreign peptide sequences in a<br>
virus-like particle. As such, immunogens of the present invention may comprise peptides<br>
presented in chimaeric particles consisting of hepatitis B core antigen. Additionally, the<br>
recombinant fusion proteins may comprise the mimotopes of the present invention and a<br>
carrier protein, such as NS1 of the influenza virus. For any recombinantly expressed<br>
protein which forms part of the present invention, the nucleic acid which encodes said<br>
immunogen also forms an aspect of the present invention.<br>
Peptides used in the present invention can be readily synthesised by solid phase<br>
procedures well known in the art. Suitable syntheses may be performed by utilising "T-<br>
boc" or "F-moc" procedures. Cyclic peptides can be synthesised by the solid phase<br>
procedure employing the well-known "F-moc" procedure and polyamide resin in the fully<br>
automated apparatus. Alternatively, those skilled in the art will know the necessary<br>
laboratory procedures to perform the process manually. Techniques and procedures for<br>
solid phase synthesis are described in 'Solid Phase Peptide Synthesis: A Practical<br>
Approach' by E. Atherton and R.C. Sheppard, published by IRL at Oxford University<br>
Press (1989). Alternatively, the peptides may be produced by recombinant methods,<br>
including expressing nucleic acid molecules encoding the mimotopes in a bacterial or<br>
mammalian cell line, followed by purification of the expressed mimotope. Techniques for<br>
recombinant expression of peptides and proteins are known in the art, and are described<br>
in Maniatis, T., Fritsch, E.F. and Sambrook et al, Molecular cloning, a laboratory<br>
manuab 2nd Ed.; Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, New York<br>
(1989).<br>
In a further embodiment of the invention is provided a method of producing a<br>
polypeptide as described herein. The process of the invention may be performed by<br>
conventional recombinant techniques such as described in Maniatis et al., Molecular<br>
Cloning - A Laboratory Manual; Cold Spring Harbor, 1982-1989. Accordingly there is<br>
provided a process for producing a polypeptide according to the invention, comprising<br>
culturing a host cell under conditions sufficient for the production of said polypeptide<br>
and recovering the polypeptide from the culture medium. In particular, the process of<br>
the invention may preferably comprise the steps of:<br>
i) preparing a replicable or integrating expression vector capable, in a host<br>
cell, of expressing a DNA polymer comprising a nucleotide sequence that<br>
encodes the protein or an immunogenic derivative thereof;<br>
ii) transforming a host cell with said vector;<br>
ii) culturing said transformed host cell under conditions permitting expression<br>
of said DNA polymer to produce said protein; and<br>
iv) recovering said protein.<br>
The polypeptides or immunogenic fragment of the invention may be in the form of the<br>
"mature" protein or may be a part of a larger protein such as a precursor or a fusion<br>
protein. It is often advantageous to include an additional amino acid sequence which<br>
contains secretory or leader sequences, pro-sequences, sequences which aid in<br>
purification such as multiple histidine residues, or an additional sequence for stability<br>
during recombinant production. Furthermore, addition of exogenous polypeptide or lipid<br>
tail or polynucleotide sequences to increase the immunogenic potential of the final<br>
molecule is also considered.<br>
In one aspect, the invention relates to genetically engineered soluble fusion proteins<br>
comprising a polypeptide of the present invention, or a fragment thereof, and various<br>
portions of the constant regions of heavy or light chains of immunoglobulins of various<br>
subclasses (IgGs IgM, IgA, IgE). Preferred as an immunoglobulin is the constant part of<br>
the heavy chain of human IgG, particularly IgGl, where fusion takes place at the hinge<br>
region. In a particular embodiment, the Fc part can be removed simply by incorporation<br>
of a cleavage sequence which can be cleaved with blood clotting factor Xa. Furthermore,<br>
this invention relates to processes for the preparation of these fusion proteins by genetic<br>
engineering, and to the use thereof for drug screening, diagnosis and therapy. A<br>
particularly preferred aspect of the invention relates to the use of a polypeptide or a<br>
polynucleotide in the manufacture of a vaccine for immunotherapeutically treating a<br>
patient suffering from or susceptible to carcinoma, especially colon cancer or other colon-<br>
associated tumours or diseases. A further aspect of the invention also relates to<br>
polynucleotides encoding such fusion proteins. Examples of fusion protein technology<br>
can be found in International Patent Application Nos. WO94/29458 and WO94/22914.<br>
The proteins may be chemically conjugated, or expressed as recombinant fusion proteins<br>
allowing increased levels to be produced in an expression system as compared to non-<br>
fused protein. The fusion partner may assist in providing T helper epitopes<br>
(immunological fusion partner), preferably T helper epitopes recognised by humans, or<br>
assist in expressing the protein (expression enhancer) at higher yields than the native<br>
recombinant protein. Preferably the fusion partner will be both an immunological fusion<br>
partner and expression enhancing partner.<br>
Fusion partners include protein D from Haemophilus influenza B and the non-structural<br>
protein from influenzae virus, NS1 (hemagglutinin). Another immunological fusion<br>
partner is the protein known as LYTA. Preferably the C terminal portion of the molecule<br>
is used. Lyta is derived from Streptococcus pneumoniae which synthesize an N-acetyl-L-<br>
alanine amidase, amidase LYTA, (coded by the lytA gene {Gene, 43 (1986) page 265-<br>
272} an autolysin that specifically degrades certain bonds in the peptidoglycan backbone.<br>
The C-terminal domain of the LYTA protein is responsible for the affinity to the choline<br>
or to some choline analogues such as DEAE. This property has been exploited for the<br>
development of E.coli C-LYTA expressing plasmids useful for expression of fusion<br>
proteins. Purification of hybrid proteins containing the C-LYTA fragment at its amino<br>
terminus has been described {Biotechnology: 10, (1992) page 795-798}. It is possible to<br>
use the repeat portion of the Lyta molecule found in the C terminal end starting at residue<br>
178, for example residues 188 - 305.<br>
The present invention also includes xenogeneic forms (also termed ortholog<br>
forms) of the aforementioned polypeptides, said xenogeneic forms referring to an<br>
antigen having substantial sequence identity to the human antigen (also termed<br>
autologous antigen) which serves as a reference antigen but which is derived from a<br>
different non-human species. In this context the substantial identity refers to<br>
concordance of an amino acid sequence with another amino acid sequence or of a<br>
polynucleotide sequence with another polynucleotide sequence when such sequence are<br>
arranged in a best fit alignment in any of a number of sequence alignment proteins<br>
known in the art. By substantial identity is meant at least 70-95 %, and preferably at<br>
least 85-95%, most preferably at least 90%-95%, sequence identity between the<br>
compared sequences. Therefore according to the invention the xenogeneic CASB7439<br>
polypeptide will be a CASB7439 polypeptide which is xenogeneic with respect to<br>
human CASB7439, in other words which is isolated from a species other than human.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the polypeptide is isolated from mouse, rat, pig, or rhesus<br>
monkey, most preferably from mouse or rat. Accordingly the present invention also<br>
provides a method of inducing an immune response against human CASB7439 having<br>
an amino acid sequence as set forth in any of the sequences SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID<br>
NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO: 10 or SEQ ID NO: 11 in a human, comprising<br>
administering to the subject an effective dosage of a composition comprising a<br>
xenogeneic form of said human CASB7439 as described herein. A preferred<br>
embodiment is a method of inducing an immune response against human CASB7439<br>
using the xenogeneic CASB7439isolated from mouse, rat, pig or rhesus monkey.<br>
Another preferred method of inducing an immune response according to the present<br>
invention is using an antigen composition including a live viral expression system which<br>
expresses said xenogeneic antigen. The preferred xenogeneic CASB7439 polypeptide<br>
has the sequence set forth in SEQ ID N°12 (mouse) or in SEQ ID N°14 (rat).<br>
The isolated xenogeneic CASB7439 polypeptide will generally share substantial<br>
sequence similarity, and include isolated polypeptides comprising an amino acid sequence<br>
which has at least 70% identity, preferably at least 80% identity, more preferably at least<br>
90% identity, yet more preferably at least 95% identity, most preferably at least 97-99%<br>
identity, to that of SEQ ID NO:12 or SEQ ID NO:14 over the entire length of SEQ ID<br>
NO: 12 or SEQ ID NO: 14. Accordingly the xenogeneic polypeptide will comprise an<br>
immunogenic fragment of the polypeptide °f SEQ ID NO: 12 or SEQ ID NO: 14 in which<br>
the immunogenic activity of the immunogenic fragment is substantially the same as the<br>
polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 12 or SEQ ID NO: 14. In addition the xenogeneic<br>
CASB7439 polypeptide can be a fragment of at least about 20 consecutive amino acids,<br>
preferably about 30, more preferably about 50, yet more preferably about 100, most<br>
preferably about 150 contiguous amino acids selected from the amino acid sequences as<br>
shown in SEQ ID NO:12 or in SEQ ID NO: 14. More particularly xenogeneic CASB7439<br>
fragments will retain some functional property, preferably an immunological activity, of<br>
the larger molecule set forth in SEQ ID NO:12 or in SEQ ID NO: 14,and are useful in the<br>
methods described herein (e.g. in pharmaceutical and vaccine compositions, in<br>
diagnostics, etc.). In particular the fragments will be able to generate an immune response<br>
against the human counterpart, such as the generation of cross-reactive antibodies which<br>
react with the autologous human form of CASB7439 as set forth in any of the SEQ ID<br>
NO: 2. In a specific embodiment the xenogeneic polypeptide of the invention may be<br>
part of a larger fusion, comprising the xenogeneic CASB7439 polypeptide or fragment<br>
thereof and a heterologous protein cr part of a protein acting as a fusion partner as<br>

The present invention also includes variants of the aforementioned polypeptides, that is<br>
polypeptides that vary from the referents by conservative amino acid substitutions, whereby<br>
a residue is substituted by another with like characteristics. Typical such substitutions are<br>
among Ala, Val, Leu and He; among Ser and Thr, among the acidic residues Asp and Glu;<br>
among Asn and Gln; and among the basic residues Lys and Arg; or aromatic residues Phe<br>
and Tyr. Particularly preferred are variants in which several, 5-10,1-5,1-3,1-2 or 1 arnino<br>
acids are substituted, deleted, or added in any combination.<br>
Polypeptides of the present invention can be prepared in any suitable manner. Such<br>
polypeptides include isolated naturally occurring polypeptides, recombinantly produced<br>
polypeptides, synthetically produced polypeptides,. or polypeptides produced by a<br>
combination of these methods. Means for preparing such polypeptides are well understood<br>
in the art.<br>

The present invention also provides a nucleic acid encoding the aforementioned<br>
xenogeneic proteins of the present invention and their use in medicine. In a preferred<br>
embodiment, the xenogeneic CASB7439 polynucleotide for use in pharmaceutical<br>
compositions has the sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 13 (mouse) or in SEQ ID NO: 15<br>
(rat). The isolated xenogeneic CASB7439 polynucleotides according to the invention<br>
may be single-stranded (coding or antisense) or double-stranded, and may be DNA<br>
(genomic, cDNA or synthetic) or RNA molecules. Additional coding or non-coding<br>

variants having substantial identity to the sequences disclosed herein in SEQ ID NO: 13 or<br>
in SEQ ID NO: 15, for example those comprising at least 70% sequence identity,<br>
preferably at least 75%, 80%, 85%, 90%, 95%, 96%, 97%, 98%, or 99% or higher,<br>
sequence identity compared to a polynucleotide sequence of this invention using the<br>
methods described herein, (e.g., BLAST analysis using standard parameters). In a<br>
related embodiment, the isolated xenogeneic polynucleotide of the invention will<br>
comprise a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide mat has at least 90%, preferably<br>
95% and above, identity to the ammo acid sequence of SEQ ID NO: 12 or of SEQ ID<br>
NO:14, over the entire length of SEQ ID NO:12 or of SEQ ID NO:14; or a nucleotide<br>
sequence complementary to said isolated polynucleotide.<br>
The invention also provides polynucleotides which are complementary to all the above<br>
described polynucleotides.<br>
Said polynucleotides can be inserted in a suitable plasmid, recombinant microorganism<br>
vector or a recombinant live microorganism and used for immunization ( see for example<br>
Wolff et al., Science 247:1465-1468 (1990); Corr et. al., J. Exp. Med. 184:1555-1560<br>
(1996); Doe et al., Proc. Nail. Acad. Sci. 93:8578-8583 (1996)). Accordingly there is<br>
provided in the present invention an expression vector or recombinant live microorganism<br>
comprising said polynucleotides as hereabove defined.<br>
The invention also provides a fragment of a CASB7439 polynucleotide which when<br>
administered to a subject has the same immunogenic properties as the polynucleotide of<br>
SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID<br>
NO:9, SEQ ID NO: 13 or SEQ ID NO: 15-<br>
The invention also provides a polynucleotide encoding an immunological fragment of a<br>
CASB7439 polypeptide as hereinbefore defined.<br>
The fragments have a level of immunogenic activity of at least about 50%, preferably at<br>
least about 70% and more preferably at least about 90% of the level of immunogenic<br>
activity of a polypeptide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID<br>
NO:7, SEQ ID NO: 10 or SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12 or SEQ ID NO: 14 or a<br>
polypeptide sequence encoded by a polynucleotide sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1,<br>
SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID NO:9, SEQ ID<br>
NO:13 or SEQ ID NO:15.<br>
The polypeptide fragments according to the invention preferably comprise at least about<br>
5, 10,15, 20,25, 50, or 100 contiguous amino acids, or more, including all intermediate<br>
lengths, of a polypeptide composition set forth herein, such as those set forth in SEQ ID<br>
NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO:12<br>
or SEQ ID NO: 14, or those encoded by a polynucleotide sequence set forth in a sequence<br>
of SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ<br>
ID NO:9, SEQ ID NO: 13 or SEQ ID NO: 15-<br>
The nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:1 is a cDNA sequence which comprises a<br>
polypeptide encoding sequence (nucleotide 545 to 1126) encoding a polypeptide of 193<br>
amino acids, the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:2. The nucleotide sequence encoding the<br>
polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:2 may be identical to the polypeptide encoding sequence<br>
contained in SEQ ED NO:1 or it may be a sequence other than the one contained in SEQ<br>
ID NO:1, which, as a result of the redundancy (degeneracy) of the genetic code, also<br>
encodes the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:2. The polypeptide of the SEQ ID NO:2 is<br>
structurally related to other proteins of the achaete scute family, and is also named "human<br>
Achaete Scute homologue 2" (HASH2) (accession number NP_005161 and AAB86993).<br>
Human Achaete Scute homologue 2 (HASH2) gene, officially designated human ASCL2<br>
(Achaete Scute complex like 2) is a homologue of the Drosophila Achaete and Scute genes.<br>
Human ASCL2 is expressed in the extravillus trophoblasts of the developing placenta only,<br>
and maps on chromosome 11pl5 close to IGF2 and H19. The mouse achaete-scute<br>
homolog-2 gene (MASH2) encodes a transcription factor playing a role in the development<br>
of the trophoblast. The Mash2 gene is paternally imprinted in the mouse, and the lack of<br>
human ASCL2 expression in non-malignant hydatidiform (androgenetic) moles indicates<br>
that human Ascl2 is also imprinted in man.<br>
Ascl2 genes are members of the basic helix-loop-helix (BHLH) family of transcription<br>
factors. They activate transcription by binding to the E box (5'-CANNTG-3'). Dimerization<br>
with other BHLH proteins is required for efficient DNA binding. They are involved in the<br>
determination of the neuronal precursors in the peripheral nervous system and the central<br>
nervous system in drosophila melanogaster, and probably in mammals as well.<br>
The complementary strand of the nucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 is the<br>
polynucleotide sequence of SEQ ID NO:6. This strand also comprises two other polypeptide<br>
encoding sequences. The first polypeptide encoding sequence (nucleotide 1184 to 399 of<br>
SEQ ID: 1, nucleotide 608 to 1393 of SEQ ID NO:6) encodes a polypeptide of 262 amino<br>
acids, the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:3. The second polypeptide encoding sequence<br>
(nucleotide 840 to 262 of SEQ ID NO:1, nucleotide 952 to 1530 of SEQ ID NO:6) encodes<br>
a polypeptide of 193 amino acids, the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 11. The nucleotide<br>
sequence encoding the polypeptides of SEQ ID NO:3 and SEQ ED NO:11 may be identical<br>
to the polypeptides encoding sequence contained in SEQ ID NO: 6 or it may be a sequence<br>
other than the one contained in SEQ ID NO: 6, which, as a result of the redundancy<br>
(degeneracy) of the genetic code, also encodes the polypeptides of SEQ ID NO:3 and 11.<br>
The polypeptide of the SEQ ID NO:3 is structurally related to other proteins of the splicing<br>
coactivator protein family, having homology and/or structural similarity with homo sapiens<br>
splicing coactivator subunit srm300 (genbank accession AAF21439). The polypeptide of<br>
SEQ ID NO:11 is not related to any known protein. Polypeptide sequences as set forth in<br>
SEQ ID NO:3 and SEQ ID NO:11, and polynucleotide sequences as set forth in SEQ ID<br>
NO:6 are novel and also form part of the invention.<br>
Preferred polypeptides and polynucleotides of the present invention are expected to have,<br>
inter alia, similar biological functions/properties to their homologous polypeptides and<br>
polynucleotides. Furthermore, preferred polypeptides, immunological fragments and<br>
polynucleotides of the present invention have at least one activity of either SEQ ED NO: 1,<br>
SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3 or SEQ ID NO:11 as appropriate.<br>
The present invention also relates to partial or other incomplete polynucleotide and<br>
polypeptide sequences which were first identified prior to the determination of the<br>
corresponding full length sequences of seQ ID NO:1, SEQ ED NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, and SEQ<br>
ID NO: 11.<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention provides for an isolated<br>
polynucleotide which:<br>
(a) comprises a nucleotide sequence which has at least 70% identity, preferably at least<br>
80% identity, more preferably at least 90% identity, yet more preferably at least 95%<br>
identity, even more preferably at least 97-99% identity to SEQ ID NO:4 and 5 over the<br>
entire length of SEQ ID NO 4 and 5;<br>
(b) has a nucleotide sequence which has at least 70% identity, preferably at least 80%<br>
identity, more preferably at least 90% identity, yet more preferably at least 95% identity,<br>
even more preferably at least 97-99% identity, to SEQ ID NO:1 or SEQ ID NO:6 over the<br>
entire length of SEQ ID NO:4 and SEQ ED NO:5 respectively;<br>
(c) the polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO:4 and SEQ ID NO:5; or<br>
(d) a nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide which has at least 70% identity,<br>
preferably at least 80% identity, more preferably at least 90% identity, yet more<br>
preferably at least 95% identity, even more preferably at least 97-99% identity, to the<br>
amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 and SEQ ID NO:7 respectively, over the entire<br>
length of SEQ ID NO:2 and 7, as well as the polynucleotides of SEQ ID NO:4 and 5.<br>
The present invention further provides for a polypeptide which:<br>
(a) comprises an amino acid sequence which has at least 70% identity, preferably at least<br>
80% identity, more preferably at least 90% identity, yet more preferably at least 95%<br>
identity, most preferably at least 97-99% identity, to that of SEQ ID NO:2 and 7 over the<br>
entire length of SEQ ID NO:2 or 7;<br>
(b) has an amino acid sequence which is at least 70% identity, preferably at least 80%<br>
identity, more preferably at least 90% identity, yet more preferably at least 95% identity,<br>
most preferably at least 97-99% identity, to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or<br>
7 over the entire length of SEQ ID NO:2 or 7;<br>
(c) comprises the amino acid of SEQ ID NO:2 or 7; and<br>
(d) is the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 7;<br>
as well as polypeptides encoded by a polynucleotide comprising the sequence contained ..<br>
in SEQ ID NO:4 and 5.<br>
Polynucleotides of the present invention may be obtained, using standard cloning and<br>
screening tecnniques, from a cDNA library derived from mRNA in cells of human colon<br>
cancer, (for example Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed.,<br>
Cold Spring harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring harbor, N.Y. (1989)). Polynucleotides of<br>
the invention can also be obtained from natural sources such as genomic DNA libraries or<br>
can be synthesized using well known and commercially available techniques.<br>
When polynucleotides of the present invention are used for the recombinant production of<br>
polypeptides of the present invention, the polynucleotide may include the coding sequence<br>
for the mature polypeptide, by itself; or the coding sequence for the mature polypeptide in<br>
reading frame with other coding sequences, such as those encoding a leader or secretory<br>
sequence, a pre-, or pro- or prepro- protein sequence, or other fusion peptide portions. For<br>
example, a marker sequence which facilitates purification of the fused polypeptide can be<br>
encoded. In certain preferred embodiments of this aspect of the invention, the marker<br>
sequence is a hexa-histidine peptide, as provided in the pQE vector (Qiagen, Inc.) and<br>
described in Gentz et al, Proc Natl Acad Sci USA (1989) 86:821-824, or is an HA tag. The<br>
polynucleotide may also contain non-coding 5' and 3' sequences, such as transcribed, non-<br>
. translated sequences, splicing and polyadenylation signals, ribosome binding sites and<br>
sequences that stabilize mRNA.<br>
Further embodiments of the present invention include polynucleotides encoding polypeptide<br>
variants which comprise the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID<br>
NO:7, SEQ ID NO:11, SEQ ID NO: 13 or SEQ ID NO: 15 and in which several, for instance<br>
from 5 to 10, 1 to 5, 1 to 3, 1 to 2 or 1, amino acid residues are substituted, deleted or added,<br>
in any combination.<br>
Polynucleotides which are identical or sufficiently identical to a nucleotide sequence<br>
contained in SEQ ID NO:1 or in SEQ ID NO:6, may be used as hybridization probes for<br>
cDNA and genomic DNA or as primers for a nucleic acid amplification (PCR) reaction, to<br>
isolate full-length cDNAs and genomic clones encoding polypeptides of the present<br>
invention and to isolate cDNA and genomic clones of other genes (including genes encoding<br>
paralogs from human sources and orthologs and paralogs from species other than human)<br>
that have a high sequence similarity to SEQ ID NO:1 or to SEQ ID NO:6. Typically these<br>
nucleotide sequences are 70% identical, preferably 80% identical, more preferably 90%<br>
identical, most preferably 95% identical to that of the referent. The probes or primers will<br>
generally comprise at least 15 nucleotides, preferably, at least 30 nucleotides and may have<br>
at least 50 nucleotides. Particularly preferred probes will have between 30 and 50<br>
nucleotides. Particularly preferred primers will have between 20 and 25 nucleotides. In<br>
particular, polypeptides or polynucleotides derived from sequences from homologous<br>
animal origin could be used as immunogens to obtain a cross-reactive immune response to<br>
the human gene.<br>
A polynucleotide encoding a polypeptide of the present invention, including homologs from<br>
species other than human, may be obtained by a process which comprises the steps of<br>
screening an appropriate library under stringent hybridization conditions with a labeled<br>
probe having the sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO:6 or a fragment thereof; and<br>
isolating full-length cDNA and genomic clones containing said polynucleotide sequence.<br>
Such hybridization techniques are well known to the skilled artisan. Preferred stringent<br>
hybridization conditions include overnight incubation at 42°C in a solution comprising: 50%<br>
formamide, 5xSSC (150mM NaCl, 15mM trisodium citrate), 50 mM sodium phosphate<br>
(pH7.6), 5x Denhardt's solution, 10 % dextran sulfate, and 20 micTogram/ml denatured,<br>
sheared salmon sperm DNA; followed by washing the filters in 0.1 x SSC at about 65°C.<br>
Thus the present invention also includes polynucleotides obtainable by screening an<br>
appropriate library under stingent hybridization conditions with a labeled probe having the<br>
sequence of SEQ ID NO: 1 or SEQ ID NO:6 or a fragment thereof.<br>
The skilled artisan will appreciate that, in many cases, an isolated cDNA sequence will be<br>
incomplete, in that the region coding for the polypeptide is short at the 5' end of the<br>
cDNA.<br>
There are several methods available and well known to those skilled in the art to obtain<br>
full-length cDNAs, or extend short cDNAs, for example those based on the method of<br>
Rapid Amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) (see, for example, Frohman et al., PNAS<br>
USA 85, 8998-9002, 1988). Recent modifications of the technique, exemplified by the<br>
MarathonTM technology (Clontech Laboratories Inc.) for example, have significantly<br>
simplified the search for longer cDNAs. In the MarathonTM technology, cDNAs have<br>
been prepared from mRNA extracted from a chosen tissue and an 'adaptor' sequence<br>
ligated onto each end. Nucleic acid amplification (PCR) is then carried out to amplify the<br>
'missing' 5' end of the cDNA using a combination of gene specific and adaptor specific<br>
oligonucleotide primers. The PCR reaction is then repeated using 'nested' primers, that is,<br>
primers designed to anneal within the amplified product (typically an adaptor specific<br>
primer that anneals further 3' in the adaptor sequence and a gene specific primer that<br>
anneals further 5' in the known gene sequence). The products of this reaction can then be<br>
analysed by DNA sequencing and a full-length cDNA constructed either by joining the<br>
product directly to the existing cDNA to give a complete sequence, or carrying out a<br>
separate full-length PCR using the new sequence information for the design of the 5'<br>
primer.<br>
Recombinant polypeptides of the present invention may be prepared by processes well<br>
known in the art from genetically engineered host cells comprising expression systems.<br>
Accordingly, in a further aspect, the present invention relates to an expression system which<br>
comprises a polynucleotide of the present invention, to host cells which are genetically<br>
engineered with such expression sytems and to the production of polypeptides of the<br>
invention by recombinant techniques. Cell-free translation systems can also be employed to<br>
produce such proteins using RNAs derived from the DNA constructs of the present<br>
invention.<br>
For recombinant production, host cells can be genetically engineered to incorporate<br>
expression systems or portions thereof for polynucleotides of the present invention.<br>
Introduction of polynucleotides into host cells can be effected by methods described in many<br>
standard laboratory manuals, such as Davis et al, Basic Methods in Molecular Biology<br>
(1986) and Sambrook et al., Molecular Cloning: A Laboratory Manual, 2nd Ed., Cold<br>
Spring Harbor Laboratory Press, Cold Spring Harbor, N.Y. (1989). Preferred such methods<br>
include, for instance, calcium phosphate transfection, DEAE-dextran mediated transfection,<br>
transvection, microinjection, cationic lipid-mediated transfection, electroporation,<br>
transduction, scrape loading, ballistic introduction or infection.<br>
Preferably the proteins of the invention are coexpressed with thioredoxin in trans (TIT).<br>
Coexpression of thioredoxin in trans versus in cis is preferred to keep antigen free of<br>
thioredoxin without the need for protease. Thioredoxin coexpression eases the<br>
solubilisation of the proteins of the invention. Thioredoxin coexpression has also a<br>
significant impact on protein purification yield, on purified-protein solubility and quality.<br>
Representative examples of appropriate hosts include bacterial cells, such as Streptococci'<br>
Staphylococci E. coli Streptomyces and Bacillus subtilis cells; fungal cells, such as yeast<br>
cells and Aspergillus ceIls; insect cells such as Drosophila S2 and Spodoptera Sf9 cells;<br>
animal cells such as CHO, COS, HeLa, C127, 3T3, BHK, HEK 293 and Bowes melanoma<br>
cells; and plant cells.<br>
A great variety of expression systems can be used, for instance, chromosomal, episomal<br>
and virus-derived systems, e.g., vectors derived from bacterial plasmids, from<br>
bacteriophage, from transposons, from yeast episomes, from insertion elements, from<br>
yeast chromosomal elements, from viruses such as baculoviruses, papova viruses, such as<br>
SV40, vaccinia viruses, adenoviruses, fowl pox viruses, pseudorabies viruses and<br>
retroviruses, and vectors derived from combinations thereof, such as those derived from<br>
plasmid and bactsriophage genetic elements, such as cosmids and phageraids. The<br>
expression systems may contain control regions that regulate as well as engender<br>
expression. Generally, any system or vector which is able to maintain, propagate or<br>
express a polynucleotide to produce a polypeptide in a host may be used. The appropriate<br>
nucleotide sequence may be inserted into an expression system by any of a variety of<br>
well-known and routine techniques, such as, for example, those set forth in Sambrook et<br>
al., Molecular Cloning, A Laboratory Manual (supra). Appropriate secretion signals may<br>
be incorporated into the desired polypeptide to allow secretion of the translated protein<br>
into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum, the periplasmic space or the extracellular<br>
environment. These signals may be endogenous to the polypeptide or they may be<br>
heterologous signals.<br>
The expression system may also be a recombinant live microorganism, such as a virus or<br>
bacterium. The gene of interest can be inserted into the genome of a live recombinant<br>
virus or bacterium. Inoculation and in vivo infection with this live vector will lead to in<br>
vivo expression of the antigen and induction of immune responses.<br>
Therefore, in certain embodiments, polynucleotides encoding immunogenic polypeptides<br>
of the present invention are introduced into suitable mammalian host cells for expression<br>
using any of a number of known viral-based systems. In one illustrative embodiment,<br>
retroviruses provide a convenient and effective platform for gene delivery systems. A<br>
selected nucleotide sequence encoding a polypeptide of the present invention can be<br>
inserted into a vector and packaged in retroviral particles using techniques known in the<br>
art. The recombinant virus can then be isolated and delivered to a subject. A number of<br>
illustrative retroviral systems have been described (e.g., U.S. Pat. No. 5,219,740; Miller<br>
and Rosman (1989) BioTechniques 7:980-990; Miller, A. D. (1990) Human Gene<br>
Therapy 1:5-14; Scarpa et al. (1991) Virology 180:849-852; Bums et al. (1993) Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 90:8033-8037; and Boris-Lawrie and Temin (1993) Cur. Opin.<br>
Genet. Develop. 3:102-109.<br>
In addition, a number of illustrative adenovirus-based systems have also been described.<br>
Unlike retroviruses which integrate into the host genome, adenoviruses persist<br>
extrachromosomally thus minimizing the risks associated with insertional mutagenesis<br>
(Haj-Ahmad and Graham (1986) J. Virol. 57:267-274; Bett et al. (1993) J. Virol.<br>
67:5911-5921; Mittereder et al. (1994) Human Gene Therapy 5:717-729; Seth et al.<br>
(1994) J. Virol. 68:933-940; Barr et al. (1994) Gene Therapy 1:51-58; Berkner, K. L.<br>
(1988) BioTechniques 6:616-629; and Rich et al. (1993) Human Gene Therapy 4:461-<br>
476).<br>
Various adeno-associated virus (AAV) vector systems have also been developed for<br>
polynucleotide delivery. AAV vectors can be readily constructed using techniques well<br>
known in the art. See, e.g., U.S. Pat. Nos. 5,173,414 and 5,139,941; International<br>
Publication Nos. WO 92/01070 and WO 93/03769; Lebkowski et al. (1988) Molec. Cell.<br>
Biol. 8:3988-3996; Vincent et al. (1990) Vaccines 90 (Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory<br>
Press); Carter, B. J. (1992) Current Opinion in Biotechnology 3:533-539; Muzyczka, N.<br>

and Zhou et al. (1994) J. Exp. Med. 179:1867-1875.<br>
Additional viral vectors useful for delivering the nucleic acid molecules encoding<br>
polypeptides of the present invention by gene transfer include those derived from the pox<br>
family of viruses, such as vaccinia virus and avian poxvirus. By way of example, vaccinia<br>
virus recombinants expressing the novel molecules can be constructed as follows. The<br>
DNA encoding a polypeptide is first inserted into an appropriate vector so that it is<br>
adjacent to a vaccinia promoter and flanking vaccinia DNA sequences, such as the<br>
sequence encoding thymidine kinase (TK). This vector is then used to transfect cells<br>
which are simultaneously infected with vaccinia. Homologous recombination serves to<br>
insert the vaccinia promoter plus the gene encoding the polypeptide of interest into the<br>
viral genome. The resulting TK.sup.(-) recombinant can be selected by culturing the cells<br>
in the presence of 5-bromodeoxyuridine and picking viral plaques resistant thereto.<br>
A vaccinia-based infection/transfection system can be conveniently used to provide for<br>
inducible, transient expression or coexpression of one or more polypeptides described<br>
herein in host cells of an organism. In this particular system, cells are first infected in<br>
vitro with a vaccinia virus recombinant that encodes the bacteriophage T7 RNA<br>
polymerase. This polymerase displays exquisite specificity in that it only transcribes<br>
templates bearing T7 promoters. Following infection, cells are transfected with the<br>
polynucleotide or polynucleotides of interest, driven by a T7 promoter. The polymerase<br>
expressed in the cytoplasm from the vaccinia virus recombinant transcribes the<br>
transfected DNA into RNA which is then translated into polypeptide by the host<br>
translational machinery. The method provides for high level, transient, cytoplasmic<br>
production of large quantities of RNA and its translation products. See, e.g., ELroy-Stein<br>
and Moss, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1990) 87:6743-6747; Fuerst et al. Proc. Natl.<br>
Acad. Sci. USA (1986) 83:8122-8126.<br>
Alternatively, avipoxviruses, such as the fowlpox and canarypox viruses, can also be used<br>
to deliver the coding sequences of interest. Recombinant avipox viruses, expressing<br>
immunogens from mammalian pathogens, are known to confer protective immunity when<br>
administered to non-avian species. The use of an Avipox vector is particularly desirable<br>
in human and other mammalian species since members of the Avipox genus can only<br>
productively replicate in susceptible avian species and therefore are not infective in<br>
mammalian cells. Methods for producing recombinant Avipoxviruses are known in the<br>
art and employ genetic recombination, as described above with respect to the production<br>
of vaccinia viruses. See, e.g., WO 91/12882; WO 89/03429; and WO 92/03545.<br>
Any of a number of alphavirus vectors can also be used for delivery of polynucleotide<br>
compositions of the present invention, such as those vectors described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,843,723; 6,015,686; 6,008,035 and 6,015,694. Certain vectors based on Venezuelan<br>
Equine Encephalitis (VEE) can also be used, illustrative examples of which can be found<br>
in U.S. Patent Nos. 5,505,947 and 5,643,576.<br>
Moreover, molecular conjugate vectors, such as the adenovirus chimeric vectors<br>
described in Michael et al. J. Biol. Chem. (1993) 268:6866-6869 and Wagner et al. Proc.<br>
Natl. Acad. Sci. USA (1992) 89:6099-6103, can also be used for gene delivery under the<br>
invention.<br>
Additional illustrative information on these and other known viral-based delivery systems<br>
can be found, for example, in Fisher-Hoch et al., proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. USA 86: :317-321,<br>

The recombinant live microorganisms described above can be virulent, or attenuated in<br>
various ways in order to obtain live vaccines. Such live vaccines also form part of the<br>
invention.<br>
In certain embodiments, a polynucleotide may be integrated into the genome of a target<br>
cell. This integration may be in the specific location and orientation via homologous<br>
recombination (gene replacement) or it may be integrated in a random, non-specific<br>
location (gene augmentation). In yet further embodiments, the polynucleotide may be<br>
stably maintained in the cell as a separate, episomal segment of DNA. Such<br>
polynucleotide segments or "episomes" encode sequences sufficient to permit<br>
maintenance and replication independent of or in synchronization with the host cell cycle.<br>
The manner in which the expression construct is delivered to a cell and where in the cell<br>
the polynucleotide remains is dependent on the type of expression construct employed.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, a polynucleotide is administered/delivered as<br>
"naked" DNA, for example as described in Ulmer et al., Science 259-1745-1749,1993<br>
and reviewed by Cohen, Science 259:1691-1692, 1993. The uptake of naked DNA may<br>
be increased by coating the DNA onto biodegradable beads, which are efficiently<br>
transported into the cells.<br>
In still another embodiment, a composition of the present invention can be delivered via a<br>
particle bombardment approach, many of which have been described. In one illustrative<br>
example, gas-driven particle acceleration can be achieved with devices such as those<br>
manufactured by Powderject Pharmaceuticals PLC (Oxford, UK) and Powderject<br>
Vaccines Inc. (Madison, WI), some examples of which are described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
5,846,796; 6,010,478; 5,865,796; 5,584,807; and EP Patent No. 0500 799. This approach<br>
offers a needle-free delivery approach wherein a dry powder formulation of microscopic<br>
particles, such as polynucleotide or polypeptide particles, are accelerated to high speed<br>
within a helium gas jet generated by a hand held device, propelling the particles into a<br>
target tissue of interest.<br>
In a related embodiment, other devices and methods that may be useful for gas-driven<br>
needle-less injection of compositions of the present invention include those provided by<br>
Bioject, Inc. (Portland, OR), some examples of which are described in U.S. Patent Nos.<br>
4,790,824; 5,064,413; 5,312,335; 5,383,851; 5,399,163; 5,520,639 and 5,993,412.<br>
Polypeptides of the present invention can be recovered and purified from recombinant cell<br>
cultures by well-known methods including ammonium sulfate or ethanol precipitation, acid<br>
extraction, anion or cation exchange chromatography, phosphocellulose chromatography,<br>
hydrophobic interaction chromatography, affinity chromatography, hydroxylapatite<br>
chromatography and lectin chromatography. Most preferably, ion metal affinity<br>
chromatography (IMAC) is employed for purification. Well known techniques for<br>
refolding proteins may be employed to regenerate active conformation when the polypeptide<br>
is denatured during intracellular synthesis, isolation and or purification.<br>
Another important aspect of the invention relates to a method for inducing, re-inforcing<br>
or modulating an immunological response in a mammal which comprises inoculating the<br>
mammal with a fragment or the entire polypeptide or polynucleotide of the invention,<br>
adequate to produce antibody and/or T cell immune response for immunoprophylaxis or<br>
for therapeutic treatment of cancer, more particularly colorectal cancer, and autoimmune<br>
disease and related conditions. Yet another aspect of the invention relates to a method of<br>
inducing, re-inforcing or modulating immunological response in a mammal which<br>
comprises, delivering a polypeptide of the present invention via a vector or cell directing<br>
expression of the polynucleotide and coding for the polypeptide in vivo in order to induce<br>
such an immunological response to produce immune responses for prophylaxis or<br>
treatment of said mammal from diseases.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to an immunological/vaccine formulation<br>
(composition) and to their use in medicine. These compositions, when introduced into a<br>
mammalian host, induce, re-inforce or modulate an immunological response in that<br>
mammal to a polypeptide of the present invention wherein the composition comprises a<br>
polypeptide or polynucleotide of the invention or an immunological fragment thereof as<br>
herein before defined. More particularly the immunogenic composition according to the<br>
present invention comprises a safe and effective amount of a CASB7439 polypeptide, or<br>
immunogenic fragment thereof wherein the CASB7439 polypeptide is selected from the<br>
group comprising SEQ ID NO:2, SEQ ID NO:3, SEQ ID NO:7, SEQ ID NO: 10, SEQ<br>
ID NO: 11, SEQ ID NO: 12 or SEQ ID NO: 14. In another embodiment, the imunogenic<br>
composition comprises a safe and effective amount of a CASB7439 -encoding<br>
polynucleotide, or fragment thereof wherein the CASB7439-encoding polynucleotide is<br>
selected from the group comprising SEQ ID NO:1, SEQ ID NO:4, SEQ ID NO:5, SEQ<br>
ID NO:6, SEQ ID NO:8, SEQ ID NO:9, SEQ ID NO: 13 or SEQ ID NO: 15.<br>
The vaccine formulation according to the invention may further comprise a suitable, i.e.<br>
pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. Since a polypeptide may be broken down in the<br>
stomach, it is preferably administered parenterally (for instance, subcutaneous,<br>
intramuscular, intravenous, or intradermal injection). Formulations suitable for parenteral<br>
administration include aqueous and non-aqueous sterile injection solutions which may<br>
contain anti-oxidants, buffers, bacteriostats and solutes which render the formulation<br>
isotonic with the blood of the recipient; and aqueous and non-aqueous sterile suspensions<br>
which may include suspending agents or thickening agents. The formulations may be<br>
presented in unit-dose or multi-dose containers, for example, sealed ampoules and vials<br>
and may be stored in a freeze-dried condition requiring only the addition of the sterile<br>
liquid carrier immediately prior to use.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to the in vitro induction of immune responses to a<br>
fragment or the entire polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention or a<br>
molecule comprising the polypeptide or polynucleotide of the present invention, using<br>
cells from the immune system of a mammal, and reinfusing these activated immune cells<br>
of the mammal for the treatment of disease. Activation of the cells from the immune<br>
system is achieved by in vitro incubation with the entire polypeptide or polynucleotide of<br>
the present invention or a molecule comprising the polypeptide or polynucleotide of the<br>
present invention in the presence or absence of various immunomodulator molecules.<br>
A further aspect of the invention relates to the immunization of a mammal by<br>
administration of antigen presenting cells modified by in vitro loading with part or the<br>
entire polypeptide of the present invention or a molecule comprising the polypeptide of<br>
the present invention and administered in vivo in an immunogenic way. Alternatively,<br>
antigen presenting cells can be transfected in vitro with a vector containing a fragment or<br>
the entire polynucleotide of the present invention or a molecule comprising the<br>
polynucleotide of the present invention, such as to express the corresponding polypeptide,<br>
and administered in vivo m an immunogenic way. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical<br>
compositions of the invention will comprise an effective amount of antigen presenting<br>
cells, modified by in vitro loading with a CASB7439 polypeptide, or genetically<br>
modified in vitro to. express a CASB7439 polypeptide and a pharmaceutically effective<br>
carrier.<br>
According to another embodiment, the pharmaceutical/immunogenic compositions<br>
described herein will comprise one or more immunostimulants in addition to the<br>
immunogenic polynucleotide, polypeptide, antibody, T-cell and/or antigen presenting cell<br>
(APC) compositions of this invention. Accordingly there is herein provided a process for<br>
the production of said immunogenic composition, comprising admixing a CASB7439<br>
polypeptide or a CASB7439 -encoding polynucleotide with a suitable<br>
adjuvant/immunostimulant, diluent or other pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. An<br>
immunostimulant refers to essentially any substance that enhances or potentiates an<br>
immune response (antibody and/or cell-mediated) to an exogenous antigen. One<br>
preferred type of immunostimulant comprises an adjuvant. Many adjuvants contain a<br>
substance designed to protect the antigen from rapid catabolism, such as aluminum<br>
hydroxide or mineral oil, and a stimulator of immune responses, such as lipid A,<br>
Bortadella pertussis or Mycohactenum tuberculosis derived proteins. Certain adjuvants<br>
are commercially available as, for example, Freund's Incomplete Adjuvant and Complete<br>
Adjuvant (Difco Laboratories, Detroit, MI); Merck Adjuvant 65 (Merck and Company,<br>
Inc., Rahway, NJ); AS-2 (SmithKline Beecham, Philadelphia, PA); aluminum salts such<br>
as aluminum hydroxide gel (alum) or aluminum phosphate; salts of calcium, iron or zinc;<br>
an insoluble suspension of acylated tyrosine; acylated sugars; cationically or anionically<br>
derivatized polysaccharides; polyphosphazenes; biodegradable microspheres;<br>
monophosphoryl lipid A and quil A. Cytokines, such as GM-CSF, interleukin-2, -7, -12,<br>
and other like growth factors, may also be used as adjuvants.<br>
Within certain embodiments of the invention, the adjuvant composition is preferably one<br>
that induces an immune response predominantly of the Thl type. High levels of Thl -<br>
type cytokines (e.g., IFN-?. TNFa, IL-2 and IL-12) tend to favor the induction of cell<br>
mediated immune responses to an administered antigen. In contrast, high levels of Th2-<br>
type cytokines (e.g., IL-4, IL-5, IL-6 and IL-10) tend to favor the induction of humoral<br>
immune responses. Following application of a vaccine as provided herein, a patient will<br>
support an immune response that includes Thl- and Th2-type responses. Within a<br>
preferred embodiment, in which a response is predominantly Thl-type, the level of Thl-<br>
type cytokines will increase to a greater extent than the level of Th2-type cytokines. The<br>
levels of these cytokines may be readily assessed using standard assays. For a review of<br>
the families of cytokines, see Mosmann and Coffman, Ann. Rev. Immunol. 7-145-173,<br>
1989.<br>
Certain preferred adjuvants for eliciting a predominantly Thl-type response include, for<br>
example, a combination of monophosphoryl lipid A, preferably 3-de-O-acylated<br>
monophosphoryl lipid A, together with an aluminum salt. MPL® adjuvants are available<br>
from Corixa Corporation (Seattle, WA; see, for example, US Patent Nos. 4,436,727;<br>
4,877,611; 4,866,034 and 4,912,094). CpG-containing oligonucleotides (in which the<br>
CpG dinucleotide is unmethylated) also induce a predominantly Thl response. Such<br>
oligonucleotides are well known and are described, for example, in WO 96/02555, WO<br>
99/33488 and U.S. Patent Nos. 6,008,200 and 5,856,462. Immunostimulatory DNA<br>
sequences are also described, for example, by Sato et al., Science 273:352, 1996.<br>
Another preferred adjuvant comprises a saponin, such as Quil A, or derivatives thereof,<br>
including QS21 and QS7 (Aquila Biopharmaceuticals Inc., Framingham, MA); Escin;<br>
Digitonin; or Qypsophila Or Chenopodium quinoa saporans . Other preferred<br>
formulations include more than one saponin in the adjuvant combinations of the present<br>
invention, for example combinations of at least two of the following group comprising<br>
QS21, QS7, Quil A, b-escin, or digitonin.<br>
Alternatively the saponin formulations may be combined with vaccine vehicles composed<br>
of chitosan or other polycationic polymers, polylactide and polylactide-co-glycolide<br>
particles, poly-N-acetyl glucosamine-based polymer matrix, particles composed of<br>
polysaccharides or chemically modified polysaccharides, liposomes and lipid-based<br>
particles, particles composed of glycerol monoesters, etc. The saponins may also be<br>
formulated in the presence of cholesterol to form particulate structures such as liposomes<br>
or ISCOMs. Furthermore, the saponins may be formulated together with a<br>
polyoxyethylene ether or ester, in either a non-particulate solution or suspension, or in a<br>
particulate structure such as a paucilamelar liposome or ISCOM. The saponins may also<br>
be formulated with excipients such as CarbopolR to increase viscosity, or may be<br>
formulated in a dry powder form with a powder excipient such as lactose.<br>
In one preferred embodiment, the adjuvant system includes the combination of a<br>
monophosphoryl lipid A and a saponin derivative, such as the combination of QS21 and<br>
3D-MPL® adjuvant, as described in WO 94/00153, or a less reactogenic composition<br>
where the QS21 is quenched with cholesterol, as described in WO 96/33739. Other<br>
preferred formulations comprise an oil-in-water emulsion and tocopherol. Another<br>
particularly preferred adjuvant formulation employing QS21, 3D-MPL® adjuvant and<br>
tocopherol in an oil-in-water emulsion is described in WO 95/17210.<br>
Another enhanced adjuvant system involves the combination of a CpG-containing<br>
oligonucleotide and a saponin derivative particularly the combination of CpG and QS21<br>
as disclosed in WO 00/09159. Preferably the formulation additionally comprises an oil in<br>
water emulsion and tocopherol.<br>
Additional illustrative adjuvants for use in the pharmaceutical compositions of the<br>
invention include Montanide ISA 720 (Seppic, France), SAP (Chiron, California, United<br>
States), ISCOMS (CSL), MF-59 (Chiron), the SBAS series of adjuvants (e g., SBAS-2 or<br>
SBAS-4, available from SmithKline Beecham, Rixensart, Belgium), Detox (Enhanzyn®)<br>
(Corixa, Hamilton, MT), RC-529 (Corixa, Hamilton, MT) and other aminoalkyl<br>
glucosaminide 4-phosphates (AGPs), such as those described in pending U.S. Patent<br>
Application Serial Nos. 08/853,826 and 09/074,720, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference in their entireties, and polyoxyethylene ether adjuvants<br>
such as those described in WO 99/52549A1.<br>
Other preferred adjuvants include adjuvant molecules of the general formula (I):<br>
HO(CH2CH2O)n-A-R<br>
Wherein, n is 1-50, A is a bond or -C(O)-, R is C1-50 alkyl or Phenyl C1-50 alkyl.<br>
One embodiment of the present invention consists of a vaccine formulation comprising a<br>
polyoxyethylene ether of general formula (I), wherein n is between 1 and 50, preferably<br>
4-24, most preferably 9; the R component is C1-50, preferably C4-C20 alkyl and most<br>
preferably C12 alkyl, and A is a bond. The concentration of the polyoxyethylene ethers<br>
should be in the range 0.1-20%, preferably from 0.1-10%, and most preferably in the<br>
range 0.1-1%. Preferred polyoxyethylene ethers are selected from the following group:<br>
polyoxyethylene-9-lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene-9-steoryl ether, polyoxyethylene-8-<br>
steoryl ether, polyoxyethylene-4-lauryl ether, polyoxyethylene-35-lauryl ether, and<br>
polyoxyethylene-23-lauryl ether. Polyoxyethylene ethers such as polyoxyethylene lauryl<br>
ether are described in the Merck index (12th edition: entry 7717). These adjuvant<br>
molecules are described in WO 99/52549.<br>
The polyoxyethylene ether according to the general formula (I) above may, if desired, be<br>
combined with another adjuvant. For example, a preferred adjuvant combination is<br>
preferably with CpG as described in the pending UK patent application GB 9820956.2.<br>
Preferably a carrier is also present in the vaccine composition according to the invention.<br>
The carrier may be an oil in water emulsion, or an aluminium salt, such as aluminium<br>
phosphate or aluminium hydroxide.<br>
A preferred oil-in-water emulsion comprises a metabolisible oil, such as squalene, alpha<br>
tocopherol and Tween 80. In a particularly preferred aspect the antigens in the vaccine<br>
composition according to the invention are combined with QS21 and 3D-MPL in such an<br>
emulsion. Additionally the oil in water emulsion may contain span 85 and/or lecithin<br>
and/or tricaprylin.<br>
Typically for human administration QS21 and 3D-MPL will be present in a vaccine in the<br>
range of µg - 200µg, such as 10-100µg, preferably 10µg - 50µg per dose. Typically the<br>
oil in water will comprise from 2 to 10% squalene, from 2 to 10% alpha tocopherol and<br>
from 0.3 to 3% tween 80. Preferably the ratio of squalene: alpha tocopherol is equal to<br>
or less than 1 as this provides a more stable emulsion. Span 85 may also be present at a<br>
level of 1 %. In some cases it may be advantageous that the vaccines of the present<br>
invention will further contain a stabiliser.<br>
Non-toxic oil in water emulsions preferably contain a non-toxic oil, e.g. squalane or<br>
squalene, an emulsifier, e.g. Tween 80, in an aqueous carrier. The aqueous carrier may<br>
be, for example, phosphate buffered saline.<br>
A particularly potent adjuvant formulation involving QS21, 3D-MPL and tocopherol in<br>
an oil in water emulsion is described in WO 95/17210.<br>
The present invention also provides a polyvalent vaccine composition comprising a vaccine<br>
formulation of the invention in combination with other antigens, in particular antigens useful<br>
for treating cancers, more particularly colorectal cancer, autoimmune diseases and related<br>
conditions. Such a polyvalent vaccine composition may include a TH-1 inducing adjuvant<br>
as hereinbefore described.<br>
According to another embodiment of this invention, an immunogenic composition<br>
described herein is delivered to a host via antigen presenting cells (APCs), such as<br>
dendritic cells, macrophages, B cells, monocytes and other cells that may be engineered<br>
to be efficient APCs. Such cells may, but need not, be genetically modified to increase<br>
the capacity for presenting the antigen, to improve activation and/or maintenance of the T<br>
cell response, to have anti-tumor effects per se and/or to be immunologically compatible<br>
with the receiver (i.e., matched HLA haplotype). APCs may generally be isolated from<br>
any of a variety of biological fluids and organs, including tumor and peritumoral tissues,<br>
and may be autologous, allogeneic, syngeneic or xenogeneic cells.<br>
Certain preferred embodiments of the present invention use dendritic cells or progenitors<br>
thereof as antigen-presenting cells. Dendritic cells are highly potent APCs (Banchereau<br>
and Steinman, Mature 392:245-251, 1998) and have been shown to be effective as a<br>
physiological adjuvant for eliciting prophylactic or therapeutic antitumor immunity (see<br>
Timmerman and Levy, Ann. rev. Med.50:507-529, 1999). In general, dendritic cells<br>
may be identified based on their typical shape (stellate in situ, with marked cytoplasmic<br>
processes (dendrites) visible in vitro), their ability to take up, process and present<br>
antigens with high efficiency and their ability to activate naive T cell responses.<br>
Dendritic cells may, of course, be engineered to express specific cell-surface receptors or<br>
ligands that are not commonly found on dendritic cells in vivo or ex vivo and such<br>
modified dendritic cells are contemplated by the present invention. As an alternative to<br>
dendritic cells, secreted vesicles antigen-loaded dendritic cells (called exosomes) may be<br>
used within a vaccine (see Zitvogel et al., Nature Med. 4:594-600, 1998).<br>
Dendritic cells and progenitors may be obtained from peripheral blood, bone marrow,<br>
tumor-infiltrating cells, peritumoral tissues-infiltrating cells, lymph nodes, spleen, skin,<br>
umbilical cord blood or any other suitable tissue or fluid. For example, dendritic cells<br>
may be differentiated ex vivo by adding a combination of cytokines such as GM-CSF, IL.-<br>
4, IL-13 and/or TNFa to cultures of monocytes harvested from peripheral blood.<br>
Alternatively, CD34 positive cells harvested from peripheral blood, umbilical cord blood<br>
or bone marrow may be differentiated into dendritic cells by adding to the culture<br>
medium combinations of GM-CSF, IL-3, TNFa, CD40 ligand, LPS, flt3 ligand and/or<br>
other compound(s) that induce differentiation, maturation and proliferation of dendritic<br>
cells.<br>
Dendritic cells are conveniently categorized as "immature" and "mature" cells, which<br>
allows a simple way to discriminate between two well characterized phenotypes.<br>
However, this nomenclature should not be construed to exclude all possible intermediate<br>
stages of differentiation. Immature dendritic cells are characterized as APC with a high<br>
capacity for antigen uptake and processing, which correlates with the high expression of<br>
Fc? receptor and mannose receptor. The mature phenotype is typically characterized by a<br>
lower expression of these markers, but a high expression of cell surface molecules<br>
responsible for T cell activation such as class I and class II MHC, adhesion molecules<br>
(e.g., CD54 and CD11) and costimulatory molecules (e.g., CD40, CD80, CD86 and 4-<br>
1BB).<br>
APCs may generally be transfected with a polynucleotide of the invention (or portion or<br>
other variant thereof) such that the encoded polypeptide, or an immunogenic portion<br>
thereof, is expressed on the cell surface. Such transfection may take place ex vivo, and a<br>
pharmaceutical composition comprising such transfected cells may then be used for<br>
therapeutic purposes, as described herein. Alternatively, a gene delivery vehicle that<br>
targets a dendritic or other antigen presenting cell may be administered to a patient,<br>
resulting in transfection that occurs in vivo. In vovo and ex vivo transfection of dendritic<br>
cells, for example, may generally be performed using any methods known in the art, such<br>
as those described in WO 97/24447, or the gene gun approach described by Mahvi et al.,<br>
Immunology and cell Biology 75::456-460, 1997. Antigen loading of dendritic cells may<br>
be achieved by incubating dendritic cells or progenitor cells with the rumor polypeptide,<br>
DNA (naked or within a plasmid vector) or RNA; or with antigen-expressing<br>
recombinant bacterium or viruses (e.g., vaccinia, fowlpox, adenovirus or lentivirus<br>
vectors). Prior to loading, the polypeptide may be covalently conjugated to an<br>
immunological partner that provides T cell help (e.g., a carrier molecule). Alternatively,<br>
a dendritic cell may be pulsed with a non-conjugated immunological partner, separately<br>
or in the presence of the polypeptide.<br>
While any suitable carrier known to those of ordinary skill in the art may be employed in<br>
the pharmaceutical compositions of this invention, the type of carrier will typically vary<br>
depending on the mode of administration. Compositions of the present invention may be<br>
formulated for any appropriate manner of administration, including for example, topical,<br>
oral, nasal, mucosal, intravenous, intracranial, intraperitoneal, subcutaneous and<br>
intramuscular administration.<br>
Carriers for use within such pharmaceutical compositions are biocompatible, and may<br>
also be biodegradable. In certain embodiments, the formulation preferably provides a<br>
relatively constant level of active component release. In other embodiments, however, a<br>
more rapid rate of release immediately upon administration may be desired. The<br>
formulation of such compositions is well within the level of ordinary skill in the art using<br>
known techniques. Illustrative carriers useful in this regard include microparticles of<br>
poly(lactide-co-glycolide), polyacrylate, latex, starch, cellulose, dextran and the like.<br>
Other illustrative delayed-release carriers include supramolecular biovectors, which<br>
comprise a non-liquid hydrophilic core (e.g., a cross-linked polysaccharide or<br>
oligosaccharide) and, optionally, an external layer comprising an amphiphilic compound,<br>
such as a phospholipid (see e.g., U.S. Patent No. 5,151,254 and PCT applications WO<br>
94/20078, WO/94/23701 and WO 96/06638). The amount of active compound contained<br>
within a sustained release formulation depends upon the site of implantation, the rate and<br>
expected duration of release and the nature of the condition to be treated or prevented.<br>
In another illustrative embodiment, biodegradable microspheres (e.g., polylactate<br>
polyglycolate) are employed as carriers for the compositions of this invention. Suitable<br>
biodegradable microspheres are disclosed, for example, in U.S. Patent Nos. 4,897,268;<br>
5,075,109; 5,928,647; 5,811,128; 5,820,883; 5,853,763; 5,814,344, 5,407,609 and<br>
5,942,252. Modified hepatitis B core protein carrier systems, such as described in<br>
WO/99 40934, and references cited therein, will also be useful for many applications.<br>
Another illustrative carrier/delivery system employs a carrier comprising particulate-<br>
protein complexes, such as those described in U.S. Patent No. 5,928,647, which are<br>
capable of inducing a class I-restricted cytotoxic T lymphocyte responses in a host<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the invention will often further comprise one or<br>
more buffers (e.g., neutral buffered saline or phosphate buffered saline), carbohydrates<br>
(e.g., glucose, mannose, sucrose or dextrans), mannitol, proteins, polypeptides or amino<br>
acids such as glycine, antioxidants, bacteriostats, chelating agents such as EDTA or<br>
glutathione, adjuvants (e.g., aluminum hydroxide), solutes that render the formulation<br>
isotonic, hypotonic or weakly hypertonic with the blood of a recipient, suspending agents,<br>
thickening agents and/or preservatives. Alternatively, compositions of the present<br>
invention may be formulated as a lyophilizate.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions described herein may be presented in unit-dose or<br>
multi-dose containers, such as sealed ampoules or vials. Such containers are typically<br>
sealed in such a way to preserve the sterility and stability of the formulation until use. In<br>
general, formulations may be stored as suspensions, solutions or emulsions in oily or<br>
aqueous vehicles. Alternatively, a pharmaceutical composition may be stored in a freeze-<br>
dried condition requiring only the addition of a sterile liquid carrier immediately prior to<br>
use.<br>
The development of suitable dosing and treatment regimens for using the particular<br>
compositions described herein in a variety of treatment regimens, including e.g., oral,<br>
parenteral, intravenous, intranasal, and intramuscular administration and formulation, is<br>
well known in the art, some of which are briefly discussed below for general purposes of<br>
illustration.<br>
In certain applications, the pharmaceutical compositions disclosed herein may be<br>
delivered via oral administration to an animal. As such, these compositions may be<br>
formulated with an inert diluent or with an assimilable edible carrier, or they may be<br>
enclosed in hard- or soft-shell gelatin capsule, or they may be compressed into tablets, or<br>
they may be incorporated directly with the food of the diet.<br>
The active compounds may even be incorporated with excipients and used in the form of<br>
ingestible tablets, buccal tables, troches, capsules, elixirs, suspensions, syrups, wafers,<br>
and the like (see, for example, Mathiowitz et al., Nature 1997 Mar 27;386(6623):410-4;<br>
Hwang et al. Crit Rev Ther Drug Carrier Syst 1998;15(3):243-84; U. S. Patent<br>
5,641,515; U. S. Patent 5,580,579 and U. S. Patent 5,792,451). Tablets, troches, pills,<br>
capsules and the like may also contain any of a variety of additional components, for<br>
example, a binder, such as gum tragacanth, acacia, comstarch, or gelatin; excipients, such<br>
as dicalcium phosphate; a disintegrating agent, such as corn starch, potato starch, alginic<br>
acid and the like; a lubricant, such as magnesium stearate; and a sweetening agent, such<br>
as sucrose, lactose or saccharin may be added or a flavoring agent, such as peppermint,<br>
oil of wintergreen, or cherry flavoring. When the dosage unit form is a capsule, it may<br>
contain, in addition to materials of the above type, a liquid carrier. Various other<br>
materials may be present as coatings or to otherwise modify the physical form of the<br>
dosage unit. For instance, tablets, pills, or capsules may be coated with shellac, sugar, or<br>
both. Of course, any material used in preparing any dosage unit form should be<br>
pharmaceutically pure and substantially non-toxic in the amounts employed. In addition,<br>
the active compounds may be incorporated into sustained-release preparation and<br>
formulations.<br>
Typically, these formulations will contain at least about 0.1% of the active compound or<br>
more, although the percentage of the active ingredient(s) may, of course, be varied and<br>
may conveniently be between about 1 or 2% and about 60% or 70% or more of the<br>
weight or volume of the total formulation. Naturally, the amount of active compound(s)<br>
in each therapeutically useful composition may be prepared is such a way that a suitable<br>
dosage will be obtained in any given unit dose of the compound. Factors such as<br>
solubility, bioavailability, biological half-life, route of administration, product shelf life,<br>
as well as other pharmacological considerations will be contemplated by one skilled in<br>
the art of preparing such pharmaceutical formulations, and as such, a variety of dosages<br>
and treatment regimens may be desirable.<br>
For oral administration the compositions of the present invention may alternatively be<br>
incorporated with one or more excipients in the form of a mouthwash, dentifrice, buccal<br>
tablet, oral spray, or sublingual orally-administered formulation. Alternatively, the active<br>
ingredient may be incorporated into an oral solution such as one containing sodium<br>
borate, glycerin and potassium bicarbonate, or dispersed in a dentifrice, or added in a<br>
therapeutically-effective amount to a composition that may include water, binders,<br>
abrasives, flavoring agents, foaming agents, and humectants. Alternatively the<br>
compositions may be fashioned into a tablet or solution form that may be placed under<br>
the tongue or otherwise dissolved in the mouth.<br>
In certain circumstances it will be desirable to deliver the pharmaceutical compositions<br>
disclosed herein parenterally, intravenously, intramuscularly, or even intraperitoneally.<br>
Such approaches are well known to the skilled artisan, some of which are further<br>
described, for example, in U. S. Patent 5,543,158; U. S. Patent 5,641,515 and U. S. Patent<br>
5,399,363. In certain embodiments, solutions of the active compounds as free base or<br>
pharmacologically acceptable salts may be prepared in water suitably mixed with a<br>
surfactant, such as hydroxypropylcellulose. Dispersions may also be prepared in<br>
glycerol, liquid polyethylene glycols, and mixtures thereof and in oils. Under ordinary<br>
conditions of storage and use, these preparations generally will contain a preservative to<br>
prevent the growth of microorganisms.<br>
Illustrative pharmaceutical forms suitable for injectable use include sterile aqueous<br>
solutions or dispersions and sterile powders for the extemporaneous preparation of sterile<br>
injectable solutions or dispersions (for example, see U. S. Patent 5,466,468). In all cases<br>
the form must be sterile and must be fluid to the extent that easy syringability exists. It<br>
must be stable under the conditions of manufacture and storage and must be preserved<br>
against the contaminating action of microorganisms, such as bacteria and fungi. The<br>
carrier can be a solvent or dispersion medium containing, for example, water, ethanol,<br>
polyol (e.g., glycerol, propylene glycol, and liquid polyethylene glycol, and the like),<br>
suitable mixtures thereof, and/or vegetable oils. Proper fluidity may be maintained, for<br>
example, by the use of a coating, such as lecithin, by the maintenance of the required<br>
particle size in the case of dispersion and/or by the use of surfactants. The prevention of<br>
the action of microorganisms can be facilitated by various antibacterial and antifungal<br>
agents, for example, parabens, chlorobutanol, phenol, sorbic acid, thimerosal, and the<br>
like. In many cases, it will be preferable to include isotonic agents, for example, sugars<br>
or sodium chloride. Prolonged absorption of the injectable compositions can be brought<br>
about by the use in the compositions of agents delaying absorption, for example,<br>
aluminum monostearate and gelatin.<br>
In one embodiment, for parenteral administration in an aqueous solution, the solution<br>
should be suitably buffered if necessary and the liquid diluent first rendered isotonic with<br>
sufficient saline or glucose. These particular aqueous solutions are especially suitable for<br>
intravenous, intramuscular, subcutaneous and intraperitoneal administration. In this<br>
connection, a sterile aqueous medium that can be employed will be known to those of<br>
skill in the art in light of the present disclosure. For example, one dosage may be<br>
dissolved in 1 ml of isotonic NaCl solution and either added to 1000 ml of<br>
hypodermoclysis fluid or injected at the proposed site of infusion, (see for example,<br>
"Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences" 15th Edition, pages 1035-1038 and 1570-1580).<br>
Some variation in dosage will necessarily occur depending on the condition of the subject<br>
being treated. Moreover, for human administration, preparations will of course<br>
preferably meet sterility, pyrogenicity, and the general safety and purity standards as<br>
required by FDA Office of Biologies standards.<br>
In another embodiment of the invention, the compositions disclosed herein may be<br>
formulated in a neutral or salt form. Illustrative pharmaceutically-acceptable salts include<br>
the acid addition salts (formed with the free amino groups of the protein) and which are<br>
formed with inorganic acids such as, for example, hydrochloric or phosphoric acids, or<br>
such organic acids as acetic, oxalic, tartaric, mandelic, and the like. Salts formed with the<br>
free carboxyl groups can also be derived from inorganic bases such as, for example,<br>
sodium, potassium, ammonium, calcium, or ferric hydroxides, and such organic bases as<br>
isopropylamine, trimethylamine, histidine, procaine and the like. Upon formulation,<br>
solutions will be administered in a manner compatible with the dosage formulation and in<br>
such amount as is therapeutically effective.<br>
The carriers can further comprise any and all solvents, dispersion media, vehicles,<br>
coatings, diluents, antibacterial and antifungal agents, isotonic and absorption delaying<br>
agents, buffers, carrier solutions, suspensions, colloids, and the like. The use of such<br>
media and agents for pharmaceutical active substances is well known in the art. Except<br>
insofar as any conventional media or agent is incompatible with the active ingredient, its<br>
use in the therapeutic compositions is contemplated. Supplementary active ingredients<br>
can also be incorporated into the compositions. The phrase<br>
"pharmaceutically-acceptable" refers to molecular entities and compositions that do not<br>
produce an allergic or similar untoward reaction when administered to a human.<br>
In certain embodiments, the pharmaceutical compositions may be delivered by intranasal<br>
sprays, inhalation, and/or other aerosol delivery vehicles. Methods for delivering genes,<br>
nucleic acids, and peptide compositions directly to the lungs via nasal aerosol sprays has<br>
been described, e.g., in U. S. Patent 5,756,353 and U. S. Patent 5,804,212. Likewise, the<br>
delivery of drugs using intranasal microparticle resins (Takenaga et. al., J Controlled<br>
Release 1998 Mar 2;52(l-2):81-7) and lysophosphatidyl-glycerol compounds (U. S.<br>
Patent 5,725,871) are also well-known in the pharmaceutical arts. Likewise, illustrative<br>
transmucosal drug delivery in the form of a polytetrafluoroetheylene support matrix is<br>
described in U. S. Patent 5,780,045.<br>
In certain embodiments, liposomes, nanocapsules, microparticles, lipid particles, vesicles,<br>
and the like, are used for the introduction of the compositions of the present invention<br>
into suitable host cells/organisms. In particular, the compositions of the present invention<br>
may be formulated for delivery either encapsulated in a lipid particle, a liposome, a<br>
vesicle, a nanosphere, or a nanoparticle or the like. Alternatively, compositions of the<br>
present invention can be bound, either covalently or non-covalently, to the surface of<br>
such carrier vehicles.<br>
The formation and use of liposome and liposome-like preparations as potential drug<br>
carriers is generally known to those of skill in the art (see for example, Lasic, Trends<br>
Biotechnol 1998 Jul; 16(7):307-21; Takakura, Nippon Rinsho 1998 Mar;56(3):691-5;<br>
Chandran et al.,., Indian J Exp Biol. 1997 Aug;35(8):801-9; Margalit, Crit Rev Ther Drug<br>
Carrier Syst. 1995;12(2-3):233-61; U.S. Patent 5,567,434; U.S. Patent 5,552,157; U.S.<br>
Patent 5,565,213; U.S. Patent 5,738,868 and U.S. Patent 5,795,587, each specifically<br>
incorporated herein by reference in its entirety).<br>
Liposomes have been used successfully with a number of cell types that are normally<br>
difficult to transfect by other procedures, including T cell suspensions, primary<br>
hepatocyte cultures and PC 12 cells (Renneisen et al., J Biol Chem. 1990 Sep<br>
25;265(27): 16337-42; Muller et al. DNA Cell Biol. 1990 Apr;9(3):221-9). In addition,<br>
liposomes are free of the DNA length constraints that are typical of viral-based delivery<br>
systems. Liposomes have been used effectively to introduce genes, various drugs,<br>
radiotherapeutic agents, enzymes, viruses, transcription factors, allosteric effectors and<br>
the like, into a variety of cultured cell lines and animals. Furthermore, he use of<br>
liposomes does not appear to be associated with autoimmune responses or unacceptable<br>
toxicity after systemic delivery.<br>
In certain embodiments, liposomes are formed from phospholipids that are dispersed in<br>
an aqueous medium and spontaneously form multilamellar concentric bilayer vesicles<br>
(also termed multilamellar vesicles (MLVs).<br>
Alternatively, in other embodiments, the invention provides for pharmaceutically-<br>
acceptable nanocapsule formulations of the compositions of the present invention.<br>
Nanocapsules can generally entrap compounds in a stable and reproducible way (see, for<br>
example, Quintanar-Guerrero et al. Drug Dev Ind Pharm. 1998 Dec;24(12):l 113-28).<br>
To avoid side effects due to intracellular polymeric overloading, such ultrafine particles<br>
(sized around 0.1 µm) may be designed using polymers able to be degraded in vivo. Such<br>
particles can be made as described, for example, by Couvreur et al. Crit Rev Ther Drug<br>
Carrier Syst. 1988;5(l):l-20; zur Muhlen et al. Eur J Pharm Biopharm. 1998<br>
Mar;45(2): 149-55; Zambaux et al. J Controlled Release. 1998 Jan 2;50(l-3):31-40; and<br>
U.S. Patent 5,145,684.<br>
This invention also relates to the use of polynucleotides, in the form of primers derived from<br>
the polynucleotides of the present invention, and of polypeptides, in the form of antibodies<br>
or reagents specific for the polypeptide of the present invention, as diagnostic reagents.<br>
The identification of genetic or biochemical markers in blood or tissues that will enable the<br>
detection of very early changes along the carcinogenesis pathway will help in determining<br>
the best treatment for the patient. Surrogate tumour markers, such as polynucleotide<br>
expression, can be used to diagnose different forms and states of cancer. The identification<br>
of expression levels of the polynucleotides of the invention will be useful in both the<br>
staging of the cancerous disorder and grading the nature of the cancerous tissue. The staging<br>
process monitors the advancement of the cancer and is determined on the presence or<br>
absence of malignant tissue in the areas biopsied. The polynucleotides of the invention can<br>
help to perfect the staging process by identifying markers for the aggresivity of a cancer, for<br>
example the presence in different areas of the body. The grading of the cancer describes<br>
how closely a tumour resembles normal tissue of its same type and is assessed by its cell<br>
morphology and other markers of differentiation. The polynucleotides of the invention can<br>
be useful in determining the tumour grade as they can help in the determination of the<br>
differentiation status of the cells of a tumour.<br>
The diagnostic assays offer a process for diagnosing or determining a susceptibility to<br>
cancers, autoimmune disease and related conditions through diagnosis by methods<br>
comprising determining from a sample derived from a subject an abnormally decreased or<br>
increased level of polypeptide or mRNA. This method of diagnosis is known as<br>
differential expression. The expression of a particular gene is compared between a<br>
diseased tissue and a normal tissue. A difference between the polynucleotide-related<br>
gene, mRNA, or protein in the two tissues is compared, for example in molecular weight,<br>
amino acid or nucleotide sequence, or relative abundance, indicates a change in the gene,<br>
or a gene which regulates it, in the tissue of the human that was suspected of being<br>
diseased.<br>
Decreased or increased expression can be measured at the RNA level. PolyA RNA is<br>
first isolated from the two tissues and the detection of mRNA encoded by a gene<br>
corresponding to a differentially expressed polynucleotide of the invention can be<br>
detected by, for example, in situ hybridization in tissue sections, reverse trascriptase-<br>
PCR, using Northern blots containing poly A+ mRNA, or any other direct or inderect<br>
RNA detection method. An increased or decreased expression of a given RNA in a<br>
diseased tissue compared to a normal tissue suggests that the transcript and/or the expressed<br>
protein has a role in the disease. Thus detection of a higher or lower level of mRNA<br>
corresponding to SEQ ID NO: 1 relative to normal level is indicative of the presence of<br>
cancer in the patient.<br>
mRNA expression levels in a sample can be determined by generation of a library of<br>
expressed sequence tags (ESTs) from the sample. The relative representation of ESTs in<br>
the library can be used to assess the relative representation of the gene transcript in the<br>
starting sample. The EST analysis of the test can then be compared to the EST analysis<br>
of a reference sample to determine the relative expression levels of the polynucleotide of<br>
interest.<br>
Other mRNA analyses can be carried out using serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE)<br>
methodology (Velculescu et. Al. Science (1995) 270:484) , differential display<br>
methodology (For example, US 5,776,683) or hybridization analysis which relies on the<br>
specificity of nucleotide interactions.<br>
Alternatively, the comparison could be made at the protein level. The protein sizes in the<br>
two tissues may be compared using antibodies to detect polypeptides in Western blots of<br>
protein extracts from the two tissues. Expression levels and subcellular localization may<br>
also be detected immunologically using antibodies to the corresponding protein. Further<br>
assay techniques that can be used to determine levels of a protein, such as a polypeptide of<br>
the present invention, in a sample derived from a host are well-known to those of skill in the<br>
art. A raised or decreased level of polypeptide expression in the diseased tissue compared<br>
with the same protein expression level in the normal tissue indicates that the expressed<br>
protein may be involved in the disease.<br>
In the assays of the present invention, the diagnosis can be determined by detection of gene<br>
product expression levels encoded by at least one sequence set forth in SEQ ID NO: 1. A<br>
comparison of the mRNA or protein levels in a diseased versus normal tissue may also be<br>
used to follow the progression or remission of a disease.<br>
A large number of polynucleotide sequences in a sample can be assayed using<br>
polynucleotide arrays. These can be used to examine differential expression of genes and to<br>
determine gene function. For example, arrays of the polynucleotide sequences SEQ ID<br>
NO:1 can be used to determine if any of the polynucleotides are differentially expressed<br>
between a normal and cancer cell. In one embodiment of the invention, an array of<br>
oligonucleotides probes comprising the SEQ ID NO:1 nucleotide sequence or fragments<br>
thereof can be constructed to conduct efficient screening of e.g., genetic mutations. Array<br>
technology methods are well known and have general applicability and can be used to<br>
address a variety of questions in molecular genetics including gene expression, genetic<br>
linkage, and genetic variability (see for example: M.Chee et al., Science, Vol 274, pp 610-<br>
613 (1996)).<br>
"Diagnosis" as used herein includes determination of a subject's susceptibility to a<br>
disease, determination as to whether a subject presently has the disease, and also the<br>
prognosis of a subject affected by the disease.<br>
The present invention, further relates to a diagnostic kit for performing a diagnostic assay<br>
which comprises:<br>
(a) a polynucleotide of the present invention, preferably the nucleotide sequence of SEQ<br>
ID NO: 1, or a fragment thereof;<br>
(b) a nucleotide sequence complementary to that of (a), preferably the nucleotide<br>
sequence of SEQ ED NO: 6;<br>
(c) a polypeptide of the present invention, preferably the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO: 2 or<br>
3, or a fragment thereof; or<br>
(d) an antibody to a polypeptide of the present invention, preferably to the polypeptide of<br>
SEQ ID NO:2 or 3.<br>
The nucleotide sequences of the present invention are also valuable for chromosomal<br>
localisation. The sequence is specifically targeted to, and can hybridize with, a particular<br>
location on an individual human chromosome. The mapping of relevant sequences to<br>
chromosomes according to the present invention is an important first step in correlating<br>
those sequences with gene associated disease. Once a sequence has been mapped to a<br>
precise chromosomal location, the physical position of the sequence on the chromosome can<br>
be correlated with genetic map data. Such data are found in, for example, V. McKusick,<br>
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (available on-line through Johns Hopkins University Welch<br>
Medical Library). The relationship between genes and diseases that have been mapped to<br>
the same chromosomal region are then identified through linkage analysis (coinheritance of<br>
physically adjacent genes).The differences in the cDNA or genomic sequence between<br>
affected and unaffected individuals can also be determined.<br>
The polypeptides of the invention or their fragments or analogs thereof, or cells expressing<br>
them, can also be used as imrnunogens to produce antibodies immunospecific for<br>
polypeptides of the present invention. The term "immunospecific" means that the antibodies<br>
have substantially greater affinity for the polypeptides of the invention than their affinity for<br>
other related polypeptides in the prior art<br>
In a further aspect the invention provides an antibody immunospecific for a polypeptide<br>
according to the invention or an immunological fragment thereof as hereinbefore defined.<br>
Preferably the antibody is a monoclonal antibody.<br>
Antibodies generated against polypeptides of the present invention may be obtained by<br>
administering the polypeptides or epitope-bearing fragments, analogs or cells to an animal,<br>
preferably a non-human animal, using routine protocols. For preparation of monoclonal<br>
antibodies, any technique which provides antibodies produced by continuous cell line<br>
cultures can be used. Examples include the hybridoma technique (Kohler, G. and Milstein,<br>
C., Nature (1975) 256:495-497), the trioma technique, the human B-cell hybridoma<br>
technique (Kozbor et al. Immunology Today (1983) 4:72) and the EBV-hybridoma<br>
technique (Cole et al., Monoclonal Antibodies and Cancer Therapy, 77-96, Alan R. Liss,<br>
Inc., 1985).<br>
Techniques for the production of single chain antibodies, such as those described in U.S.<br>
Patent No. 4,946,778, can also be adapted to produce single chain antibodies to polypeptides<br>
of this invention. Also, transgenic mice, or other organisms, including other mammals, may<br>
be used to express humanized antibodies.<br>
The above-described antibodies may be employed to isolate or to identify clones expressing<br>
the polypeptide or to purify the polypeptides by affinity chromatography.<br>
The antibody of the invention may also be employed to prevent or treat cancer, particularly<br>
colorectal cancer, autoimmune disease and related conditions.<br>
Another aspect of the invention relates to a method for inducing or modulating an<br>
immunological response in a mammal which comprises inoculating the mammal with a<br>
polypeptide of the present invention, adequate to produce antibody and/or T cell immune<br>
response to protect or ameliorate the symptoms or progression of the disease. Yet<br>
another aspect of the invention relates to a method of inducing or modulating<br>
immunological response in a mammal which comprises, delivering a polypeptide of the<br>
present invention via a vector directing expression of the polynucleotide and coding for<br>
the polypeptide in vivo in order to induce such an immunological response to produce<br>
antibody to protect said animal from diseases.<br>
It will be appreciated that the present invention therefore provides a method of treating<br>
abnormal conditions such as, for instance, cancer and autoimmune diseases, in particular,<br>
colorectal cancer, related to either a presence of, an excess of, or an under-expression of,<br>
CASB7439 polypeptide activity. Other abnormal conditions related to CASB7439<br>
expression that the invention seeks to treat are chronic lymphocytic leukemiae and germ cell<br>
tumours.<br>
The present invention further provides for a method of screening compounds to identify<br>
those which stimulate or which inhibit the function of the CASB7439 polypeptide. In<br>
general, agonists or antagonists may be employed for therapeutic and prophylactic purposes<br>
for such diseases as hereinbefore mentioned. Compounds may be identified from a variety<br>
of sources, for example, cells, cell-free preparations, chemical libraries, and natural product<br>
mixtures. Such agonists, antagonists or inhibitors so-identified may be natural or modified<br>
substrates, ligands, receptors, enzymes, etc., as the case may be, of the polypeptide; or may<br>
be structural or functional mimetics thereof (see Coligan et al., Current Protocols in<br>
Immunology l(2):Chapter 5 (1991)). Screening methods will be known to those skilled in<br>
the art. Further screening methods may be found in for example D. Bennett et al., J Mol<br>
Recognition, 8:52-58 (1995); and K. Johanson et al., J Biol Chem, 270(16):9459-9471<br>
(1995) and references therein.<br>
Thus the invention provides a method for screening to identify compounds which stimulate<br>
or which inhibit the function of the polypeptide of the invention which comprises a method<br>
selected from the group consisting of:<br>
(a) measuring the binding of a candidate compound to the polypeptide (or to the cells or<br>
membranes bearing the polypeptide) or a fusion protein thereof by means of a label<br>
directly or indirectly associated with the candidate compound;<br>
(b) measuring the binding of a candidate compound to the polypeptide (or to the cells or<br>
membranes bearing the polypeptide) or a fusion protein thereof in the presense of a<br>
labeled competitior,<br>
(c) testing whether the candidate compound results in a signal generated by activation or<br>
inhibition of the polypeptide, using detection systems appropriate to the cells or cell<br>
membranes bearing the polypeptide;<br>
(d) mixing a candidate compound with a solution containing a polypeptide of claim 1, to<br>
form a mixture, measuring activity of the polypeptide in the mixture, and comparing the<br>
activity of the mixture to a standard; or<br>
(e) detecting the effect of a candidate compound on the production of mRNA encoding<br>
said polypeptide and said polypeptide in cells, using for instance, an ELISA assay.<br>
The polypeptide of the invention may be used to identify membrane bound or soluble<br>
receptors, if any, through standard receptor binding techniques known in the art. Well<br>
known screening methods may also be used to identify agonists and antagonists of the<br>
polypeptide of the invention which compete with the binding of the polypeptide of the<br>
invention to its receptors, if any.<br>
Thus, in another aspect, the present invention relates to a screening kit for identifying<br>
agonists, antagonists, ligands, receptors, substrates, enzymes, etc. for polypeptides of the<br>
present invention; or compounds which decrease or enhance the production of such<br>
polypeptides, which comprises:<br>
(a) a polypeptide of the present invention;<br>
(b) a recombinant cell expressing a polypeptide of the present invention;<br>
(c) a cell membrane expressing a polypeptide of the present invention; or<br>
(d) antibody to a polypeptide of the present invention;<br>
which polypeptide is preferably that of SEQ ID NO:2 or 3.<br>
It will be readily appreciated by the skilled artisan that a polypeptide of the present<br>
invention may also be used in a method for the structure-based design of an agonist,<br>
antagonist or inhibitor of the polypeptide, by:<br>
(a) determining in the first instance the three-dimensional structure of the polypeptide;<br>
(b) deducing the three-dimensional structure for the likely reactive or binding site(s) of<br>
an agonist, antagonist or inhibitor;<br>
(c) synthesing candidate compounds that are predicted to bind to or react with the<br>
deduced binding or reactive site; and<br>
(d) testing whether the candidate compounds are indeed agonists, antagonists or<br>
inhibitors.<br>
Gene therapy may also be employed to effect the endogenous production of CASB7439<br>
polypeptide by the relevant cells in the subject. For an overview of gene therapy, see<br>
Chapter 20, Gene Therapy and other Molecular Genetic-based Therapeutic Approaches,<br>

Vaccine preparation is generally described in Pharmaceutical Biotechnology, Vol.61<br>
Vaccine Design - the subunit and adjuvant approach, edited by Powell and Newman,<br>
Plenum Press, 1995. New Trends and Developments in Vaccines, edited by Voller et al.,<br>
University Park Press, Baltimore, Maryland, U.S.A. 1978. Encapsulation within<br>
liposomes is described, for example, by Fullerton, U.S. Patent 4,235,877. Conjugation of<br>
proteins to macromolecules is disclosed, for example, by Likhite, U.S. Patent 4,372,945<br>
and by Armor et al., U.S. Patent 4,474,757.<br>
The amount of protein in each vaccine dose is selected as an amount which induces an<br>
immunoprotective response without significant, adverse side effects in typical vaccinees.<br>
Such amount will vary depending upon which specific immunogen is employed.<br>
Generally, it is expected that each dose will comprise l-lOOO^g of protein, preferably<br>
2-100µg, most preferably 4-40µg. An optimal amount for a particular vaccine can be<br>
ascertained by standard studies involving observation of antibody titres and other<br>
responses in subjects. Following an initial vaccination, subjects may receive a boost in<br>
about 4 weeks.<br>
"Isolated" means altered "by the hand of man" from the natural state. If an "isolated"<br>
composition or substance occurs in nature, it has been changed or removed from its<br>
original environment, or both. For example, a polynucleotide or a polypeptide naturally<br>
present in a living animal is not "isolated," but the same polynucleotide or polypeptide<br>
separated from the coexisting materials of its natural state is "isolated", as the term is<br>
employed herein.<br>
"Polynucleotide" generally refers to any polyribonucleotide or polydeoxribonucleotide,<br>
which may be unmodified RNA or DNA or modified RNA or DNA including single and<br>
double stranded regions.<br>
"Variant" refers to a polynucleotide or polypeptide that differs from a reference<br>
polynucleotide or polypeptide, but retains essential properties. A typical variant of a<br>
polynucleotide differs in nucleotide sequence from another, reference polynucleotide.<br>
Changes in the nucleotide sequence of the variant may or may not alter the amino acid<br>
sequence of a polypeptide encoded by the reference polynucleotide. Nucleotide changes<br>
may result in amino acid substitutions, additions, deletions, fusions and truncations in the<br>
polypeptide encoded by the reference sequence, as discussed below. A typical variant of<br>
a polypeptide differs in amino acid sequence from another, reference polypeptide.<br>
Generally, differences are limited so that the sequences of the reference polypeptide and<br>
the variant are closely similar overall and, in many regions, identical. A variant and<br>
reference polypeptide may differ in amino acid sequence by one or more substitutions,<br>
additions, deletions in any combination. A substituted or inserted amino acid residue<br>
may or may not be one encoded by the genetic code. A variant of a polynucleotide or<br>
polypeptide may be a naturally occurring such as an allelic variant, or it may be a variant<br>
that is not known to occur naturally. Non-naturally occurring variants of polynucleotides<br>
and polypeptides may be made by mutagenesis techniques or by direct synthesis.<br>
"Identity," as known in the art, is a relationship between two or more polypeptide sequences<br>
or two or more polynucleotide sequences, as determined by comparing the sequences. In the<br>
art, "identity" also means the degree of sequence relatedness between polypeptide or<br>
polynucleotide sequences, as the case may be, as determined by the match between<br>
strings of such sequences. "Identity" and "similarity" can be readily calculated by known<br>
methods, including but not limited to those described in (Computational Molecular<br>

similarity are codified in publicly available computer programs. Preferred computer<br>
program methods to determine identity and similarity between two sequences include, but<br>
are not limited to, the GCG program package (Devereux, J., et al., Nucleic Acids<br>
Research 12(1):387 (1984)), BLASTP, BLASTN, and FASTA (Atschul, S.F. et al., J.<br>

MD 20894; Altschul, S., et al., J. Mol. Biol. 215: 403-410 (1990). The well known Smith<br>
Waterman algorithm may also be used to determine identity.<br>
The preferred algorithm used is FASTA. The preferred parameters for polypeptide or<br>
polynuleotide sequence comparison using this algorithm include the following:<br>
Gap Penalty: 12<br>
Gap extension penalty: 4<br>
Word size: 2, max 6<br>
Preferred parameters for polypeptide sequence comparison with other methods include<br>
the following:<br>

A program useful with these parameters is publicly available as the "gap" program from<br>

parameters for polypeptide comparisons (along with no penalty for end gaps).<br>
Preferred parameters for polynucleotide comparison include the following:<br>

parameters for polynucleotide comparisons.<br>
By way of example, a polynucleotide sequence of the present invention may be identical<br>
to the reference sequence of SEQ ID NO:1, that is be 100% identical, or it may include<br>
up to a certain integer number of nucleotide alterations as compared to the reference<br>
sequence. Such alterations are selected from the group consisting of at least one<br>
nucleotide deletion, substitution, including transition and transversion, or insertion, and<br>
wherein said alterations may occur at the 51 or 3' terminal positions of the reference<br>
nucleotide sequence or anywhere between those terminal positions, interspersed either<br>
individually among the nucleotides in the reference sequence or in one or more<br>
contiguous groups within the reference sequence. The number of nucleotide alterations is<br>
determined by multiplying the total number of nucleotides in SEQ ID NO:1 by the<br>
numerical percent of the respective percent identity(divided by 100) and subtracting that<br>
product from said total number of nucleotides in SEQ ID NO:1, or:<br>
nn 
wherein nn is the number of nucleotide alterations, xn is the total number of nucleotides<br>
in SEQ ID NO:1, and y is, for instance, 0.70 for 70%, 0.80 for 80%, 0.85 for 85%, 0.90<br>
for 90%, 0.95 for 95%,etc, and wherein any non-integer product of xn and y is rounded<br>
down to the nearest integer prior to subtracting it from xn. Alterations of a<br>
polynucleotide sequence encoding the polypeptide of SEQ ID NO:2 may create nonsense,<br>
missense or frameshift mutations in this coding sequence and thereby alter the<br>
polypeptide encoded by the polynucleotide following such alterations.<br>
Similarly, a polypeptide sequence of the present invention may be identical to the<br>
reference sequence of SEQ ED NO:2, that is be 100% identical, or it may include up to a<br>
certain integer number of amino acid alterations as compared to the reference sequence<br>
such that the % identity is less than 100%. Such alterations are selected from the group<br>
consisting of at least one amino acid deletion, substitution, including conservative and<br>
non-conservative substitution, or insertion, and wherein said alterations may occur at the<br>
amino- or carboxy-terminal positions of the reference polypeptide sequence or anywhere<br>
between those terminal positions, interspersed either individually among the amino acids<br>
in the reference sequence or in one or more contiguous groups within the reference<br>
sequence. The number of amino acid alterations for a given % identity is determined by<br>
multiplying the total number of amino acids in SEQ ED NO:2 by the numerical percent of<br>
the respective percent identity(divided by 100) and then subtracting that product from<br>
said total number of amino acids in SEQ ID NO:2, or:<br><br>
wherein na is the number of amino acid alterations, xa is the total number of amino acids<br>
in SEQ ID NO:2, and y is, for instance 0.70 for 70%, 0.80 for 80%, 0.85 for 85% etc.,<br>
and wherein any non-integer product of xa and y is rounded down to the nearest integer<br>
prior to subtracting it from xa.<br>
"Homolog" is a generic term used in the art to indicate a polynucleotide or polypeptide<br>
sequence possessing a high degree of sequence relatedness to a subject sequence. Such<br>
relatedness may be qunnfied by determining the degree of identity and/or similarity between<br>
the sequences being compared as hereinbefore described. Falling within this generic term<br>
are the terms "ortholog", meaning a polynucleotide or polypeptide that is the functional<br>
equivalent of a polynucleotide or polypeptide in another species and "paralog" meaning a<br>
functionally similar sequence when considered within the same species.<br>

Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Real-time RT-PCR analysis<br>
Real-time RT-PCR (U. Gibson. 1996. Genome Research: 6,996) is used to compare<br>
mRNA transcript abundance of the candidate antigen in matched tumour and normal<br>
colon tissues from multiple patients. In addition, mRNA levels of the candidate gene in a<br>
panel of normal tissues are also evaluated by this approach.<br>
Total RNA from normal and tumour colon is extracted from snap frozen biopsies using<br>
TriPure reagent (Boehringer). Total RNA from normal tissues is purchased from<br>
InVitrogen or is extracted from snap frozen biopsies using TriPure reagent. Poly-A+<br>
mRNA is purified from total RNA after DNAase treatment using oligo-dT magnetic<br>
beads (Dynal). Quantification of the mRNA is performed by spectrofluorimetry<br>
(VersaFluor, BioRad) using Sybrll dye (Molecular Probes). Primers for real-time PCR<br>
amplification are designed with the Perkin-Elmer Primer Express software using default<br>
options for TaqMan amplification conditions.<br>
Real-time reactions are assembled according to standard PCR protocols using 2 ng of<br>
purified mRNA for each reaction. SybrI dye (Molecular Probes) is added at a final<br>
dilution of 1/75000 for real-time detection. Amplification (40 cycles) and real-time<br>
detection is performed in a Perkin-Elmer Biosystems PE7700 system using conventional<br>
instrument settings. Ct values are calculated using the PE7700 Sequence Detector<br>
software. Several Ct values are obtained for each samples : for the patient samples, the<br>
tumour Ct (CtT) and the matched normal colon Ct (CtN) values on the candidate TAA,<br>
and for the panel of normal tissue samples, a CtXY for each normal tissue XY. An<br>
another Ct (CtA) is also calculated on Actin gene, as an internal reference, for all of the<br>
samples. Alternatively, real-time PCR amplification can be monitored using a Taqman<br>
probe. Amplification (40 cycles) and real-time detection is performed in a Perkin-Elmer<br>
Biosystems PE7700 system using conventional instrument settings. Ct values are<br>
calculated using the PE7700 Sequence Detector Software. Ct values are obtained from<br>
each tissue sample for the target mRNA (CtX) and for the actin mRNA (CtA).<br>
As the efficiency of PCR amplification under the prevailing experimental<br>
conditions is close to the theoretical amplification efficiency, 2(CtN/T/xy-ctA) value is an<br>
estimate of the relative TAA transcript level of the sample, standardised with respect to<br>
Actin transcript level. A value of 1 thus suggests the candidate antigen and Actin have the<br>
same expression level.<br>
Real-time PCR reactions were first performed on tumour colon and matching normal<br>
colon from biopsies of 12 patients. Reactions were then performed on a more complete data<br>
set totalling 18 patients (are included in this data set the first 12 patients). Duplicates for 6<br>
out of these 18 patients were made in this data set. Six further patients were tested, and the<br>
results were pooled with the previous 18. The statistics on the final pool are shown in table<br>
3, and illustrated in figure 1.<br>
A series of 48 normal tissue samples, representing 29 different tissues, were also<br>
tested by the same procedure (analysed normal tissues are given in table 3). TAA transcript<br>
levels are calculated as described above. The proportion of patients over-expressing the<br>
candidate antigen, as well as the average transcript over-expression versus normal tissues is<br>
also calculated from this data set. The results are illustrated in figure 1.<br>
Normal tissues where CASB7439 transcript expression is equivalent none<br>
to tumour transcript level in tumours<br>
Real-time PCR reactions were also performed using the Taqman protocol ( as<br>
described above) on tumour colon and adjacent normal colon from biopsies of 6 patients.<br>
Three replicate measures were taken for each, and the average was used for further<br>
calculations. Results are shown in figure 1. Moreover, 36 normal tissue samples,<br>
representing 28 different tissues (see table 5), were also tested by the same procedure.<br>
Results are shown in figure 2.<br>
The results clearly suggest CASB7439 transcript is over-expressed in colorectal tumours<br>
compared to adjacent normal colon and to all of the above mentioned normal tissues.<br>
More than 90% of the patients strongly over-express CASB7439 transcript in tumour, as<br>
compared to adjacent normal colon. Average over-expression fold in the tumors is at least<br>
of 100. Moreover, more than 90% of the patients over-express the CASB7439 transcript<br>
in colorectal tumors as compared to other normal tissues, more than 60 % of them over-<br>
expressing it at least 10 fold.<br>

Example 2<br>
Differential Screening of cDNA arrays.<br>
Identification of tumour-associated genes in the subtracted cDNA library is accomplished by<br>
differential screening.<br>
Total bacterial DNA is extracted from 100 µl over-night cultures. Bacteria are lysed with<br>
guanidium isothiocyantate and the bacterial DNA is affinity purified using magnetic glass<br>
(Boehringer). Plasmid inserts are recovered from the bacterial DNA by Advantage PCR<br>
amplification (Clontech). The PCR products are dotted onto two nylon membranes to<br>
produce high density cDNA arrays using the Biomek 96 HDRT tool (Beekman). The<br>
spotted cDNA is covalently linked to the membrane by UV irradiation. The first membrane<br>
is hybridised with a mixed cDNA probe prepared from the tumour of a single patient. The<br>
second membrane is hybridised with an equivalent amount of mixed cDNA probe prepared<br>
from normal colon of the same patient. The probe cDNA is prepared by PCR amplification<br>
as described above and is labelled using the AlkPhos Direct System (Amersham).<br>
Hybridisation conditions and stringency washes are as described in the AlkPhos Direct kit.<br>
Hybridized probe is detected by chemiluminescence. Hybridisation intensities for each<br>
cDNA fragment on both blots are measured by film densitometry or direct measurement<br>
(BioRad Fluor-S Max). The ratio of the tumour to normal hybridisation intensities (T/N) is<br>
calculated for each gene to evaluate the degree of over-expression in the tumour. Genes<br>
which are significantly over-expressed in colon tumours are followed-up. Significance is<br>
arbitrarily defined as one standard deviation of the T/N frequency distribution. Differential<br>
screening experiments are repeated using RNA from multiple patient donors (&gt;18) to<br>
estimate the frequency of over-expressing tumours in the patient population.<br>
In addition, the DNA arrays are hybridised with mixed cDNA probes from normal tissues<br>
other than colon (see list above) to determine the level of expression of the candidate gene in<br>
these tissues.<br>
Example 3<br>
DNA microarrays<br>
DNA micro-arrays are used to examine mRNA expression profiles of large collections of<br>
genes in multiple samples. This information is used to complement the data obtained by<br>
real-time PCR and provides an independent measure of gene expression levels in tumors<br>
and normal tissues.<br>
Examples of current technologies for production of DNA micro-arrays include 1) The<br>
Affymetrix "GeneChip" arrays in which oligonucleotides are synthetized on the surface<br>
of the chip by solid phase chemical synthesis using a photolithographic process 2) DNA<br>
spotting technology in which small volumes of a DNA solution are robotically deposited<br>
and then immobilized onto the surface of a solid phase (e.g. glass). In both instances, the<br>
chips are hybridized with cDNA or cRNA which has been extracted from the tissue of<br>
interest (e.g. normal tissue, tumour etc...) and labeled with radioactivity or with a<br>
fluorescent reporter molecule. The labeled material is hybridized to the chip and the<br>
amount of probe bound to each sequence on the chip is determined using a specialized<br>
scanner. The experiment can be set-up with a single fluorescent reporter (or radioactivity)<br>
or, alternatively, can be performed using two fluorescent reporters. In this latter case,<br>
each of the two samples is labeled with one of the reporter molecules. The two labeled<br>
samples are then hybridized competitively to the sequences on the DNA chip. The ratio<br>
of the two fluorescent signals is determined for each sequence on the chip. This ratio is<br>
used to calculate the relative abundance of the transcript in the two samples. Detailed<br>
protocols are available from a number of sources including "DNA Microarrays: A<br>
practical approach. Schena M. Oxford University Press 1999" and the World Wide Web<br>
(http://cmgm.stanford.edu/pbrown/protocols/index.html), http://arrayit.com/DNA-<br>
Microarray-Protocols/) and specialized distributors (e.g. Affymetrix).<br>
Example 5<br>
Northern-Southern blot analysis<br>
Limited amounts of mixed tumour and matched normal colon cDNA are amplified by<br>
Advantage PCR (see above). Messenger RNA from multiple normal tissues is also<br>
amplified using the same procedure. The amplified cDNA (1 ug) is electrophoresed on a<br>
1.2% agarose gel and transferred onto a nylon membrane. The membrane is hybridised<br>
(AlkPhos Direct System) with a probe prepared using a fragment of the candidate TAA<br>
cDNA. Northem-Southem analysis provides information on transcript size, presence of<br>
splice variants and transcript abundance in tumour and normal tissues.<br>
Example 6<br>
Northern blot analysis<br>
Northern blots are produced according to standard protocols using 1 ug of poly A+<br>
mRNA. Radioactive probes are prepared using the Ready-to-Go system (Pharmacia).<br>
Example 7<br>
Experimental identification of the full length cDNA sequence<br>
Colon tumour cDNA libraries are constructed using the Lambda Zap II system<br>
(Stratagene) from 5 ug of polyA+ mRNA. The supplied protocol is followed except that<br>
Superscriptn (Life Technologies) is used for the reverse transcription step. Oligo dT-<br>
primed and random-primed libraries are constructed. About 1.5 xlO6 independent phages<br>
are plated for each screening of the library. Phage plaques are transferred onto nylon<br>
filters and hybridised using a cDNA probe labelled with AlkPhos Direct/Positive phages<br>
are detected by chemiluminescence. Positive phage are excised from the agar plat, eluted<br>
in 500ul SM buffer and confirmed by gene-specific PCR. Eluted phages are converted to<br>
single strand Ml 3 bacteriophage by in vivo excision. The bacteriophage is then converted<br>
to double strand plasmid DNA by infection of E. coli. Infected bacteria are plated and<br>
submitted to a second round of screening with the cDNA probe. Plasmid DNA is purified<br>
from positive bacterial clones and sequenced on both strands.<br>
When the full length gene cannot be obtained directly from the cDNA library, missing<br>
sequence is isolated using RACE technology (Marathon Kit, ClonTech.). This approach<br>
relies on reverse transcribing mRNA into double strand cDNA, ligating linkers onto the<br>
ends of the cDNA and amplifying the desired extremity of the cDNA using a gene-<br>
specific primer and one of the linker oligonucleotides. Marathon PCR products are cloned<br>
into a plasmid (pCRII-TOPO, InVitrogen) and sequenced.<br>
The polynucleotide of SEQ ID NO:1 was obtained using this procedure.<br>
Example 8.<br>
EST profiles<br>
A complementary approach to experimental antigen tissue expression characterization is<br>
to explore the human EST database. ESTs ('Expressed Sequence Tags ) are small<br>
fragments of cDNA made from a collection of mRNA extracted from a particular tissue<br>
or cell line. Such database currently provides a massive amount of human ESTs (2 106)<br>
from several thousands of cDNA tissue libraries, including tumoral tissues from various<br>
types and states of disease. By means of informatics tools (Blast), a comparison search of<br>
the CASB7439 sequence is performed in order to have further insight into tissue<br>
expression.<br>
These ESTs match perfectly with CASB7439. The list contains 9 ESTs from 4 different<br>
tumor colon libraries, one EST from one normal colon library, 3 ESTs from one tumor<br>
germ cell library, one EST from one chronic lymphocyte leukemia cells library, 2 ESTs<br>
from 2 mixed tumors libraries, 2 ESTs from libraries of unknown type.This clearly<br>
suggests, as expected, that CASB7439 is over-expressed in tumor tissues, with an<br>
emphasis in colorectal tumor tissues, as compared to normal tissues.<br>
Example 9 :<br>
9.1 Expression and purification of tumour-specific antigens<br>
Expression in microbial hosts, or alternatively in vitro transcription/translation, is used to<br>
produce the antigen of the invention for vaccine purposes and to produce protein<br>
fragments or whole protein for rapid purification and generation of antibodies needed for<br>
characterization of the naturally expressed protein by immunohistochemistry or for<br>
follow-up of purification.<br>
Recombinant proteins may be expressed in two microbial hosts, E. coli. and in yeast<br>
(such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae or Pichia pastoris). This allows the selection of the<br>
expression system with the best features for this particular antigen production. In<br>
general, the recombinant antigen will be expressed in E. coli. and the reagent protein<br>
expressed in yeast.<br>
The expression strategy first involves the design of the primary structure of the<br>
recombinant antigen. In general an expression fusion partner (EFP) is placed at the N<br>
terminal extremity to improve levels of expression that could also include a region useful<br>
for modulating the immunogenic properties of the antigen, an immune fusion partner<br>
(IFP). In addition, an affinity fusion partner (AFP) useful for facilitating further<br>
purification is included at the C-terminal end.<br>
As mentioned above, several constructs might undergo comparative evaluation :<br>
For rapid expression and purification as well as generation of antibodies against<br>
CASB7439, it is proposed to generate in E. Coli. a fulllength CASB7439 protein with<br>
NS1 as EFP and a histidine tail as AFP.<br>
Therefore, two constructs are proposed :<br>
Construct 1: Full length wild type CASB7439 cDNA in fusion with NS1 cDNA as EFP<br>
and with a histidine tail coding cDNA as an AFP (SEQ ID NO: 8). The encoded fusion<br>
protein sequence is SEQ ID NO: 10.<br>
Construct 2: Full length mutated CASB7439 cDNA in fusion with NS1 cDNA as EFP<br>
and with a histidine tail coding cDNA as an AFP (SEQ ID NO:9). It is proposed in this<br>
construct to have the first 50 codons of native CASB7439 cDNA replaced by codons<br>
specific of the E. Coli. codon usage, to enhance expression potential of CASB7439 in its<br>
E coli, host. The encoded fusion protein sequence is SEQ ID NO: 10.<br>
The CASB7439 protein design is as shown below:<br>
"NS1" is the N-terminal fragment (80 mino acids) of the Influenza protein NS1. "HIS" is<br>
a polyhistidine tail.<br>
When the recombinant strains are available, the recombinant product is characterized by<br>
the evaluation of the level of expression and the prediction of further solubility of the<br>
protein by analysis of the behavior in the crude extract.<br>
After growth on appropriate culture medium and induction of the recombinant protein<br>
expression, total extracts are analyzed by SDS-PAGE. The recombinant proteins are<br>
visualized in stained gels and identified by Western blot analysis using specific<br>
antibodies.<br>
Plasmid :<br>
name: TCM 281 pRIT.. 15143<br>
replicon: pMB 1<br>
selection: Kan<br>
promotor: PL long<br>
insert: NSl-C74-39-His<br>
Expression of the recombinant protein from construct 1:<br>
Bacteria was grown in LB medium + 50 µg/ml Kan at 30°C<br>
When the culture reached OD = 0.5 (620nm), the culture was heated<br>
up to 39°C, after 5hours of induction, cells were harvested<br>
Extract preparation:<br>
Cell concentration: .50X.. in buffer PBS + complete...<br>
Disruption: press french 3X<br>
Centrifugation: 30 min at 14000t<br>
Comment: &gt; 90% in the supernatant of cellular extract<br>
The cell extract was run on a 12.5% SDS PAGE, and subsequently stained with<br>
Coomassie blue. A Western blot was also performed using an commercial monoclonal<br>
antibody against the poly-histidine tail (Quiagen). The resulting gels (figures 3 and 4),<br>
show that the protein is expressed, and visible in the cell extract supernatant.<br>
The purification scheme follows a classical approach based on the presence of an His<br>
affinity tail in the recombinant protein. In a typical experiment the disrupted cells are<br>
filtered and the acellular extracts loaded onto an Ion Metal Affinity Chromatography<br>
(IMAC; Ni++NTA from Qiagen) that will specifically retain the recombinant protein.<br>
The retained proteins are eluted by 0-500 mM imidazole gradient (possibly in presence of<br>
a detergent) in a phosphate buffer.<br>
The supernatant from the harvested culture was denatured in 6M urea, 100mM NaH2PO4,<br>
10mM Tris, PH 8, and loaded on a chromatographic column IMAC Qiagen NTA Ni++<br>
under the following conditions:<br>
The eluted protein in 500mM imidazole + 6M urea is dialysed under the following<br>
conditions:<br>
- PBS PH 7,2 + sarkosyl 0.5% + 4M urea<br>
idem at 2M urea 2hrs<br>
- idem at 0M urea 2hrs<br>
The final material is freezed and stored. The protein content was quantified using a<br>
Lowry protein assay (0,9 mg / 1.2 ml). The purity was assessed by a 12.5% PAGE SDS<br>
stained with Coomassie blue (figure 5), and the presence of the recombinant protein was<br>
checked by Western blot, using a anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody (figure 6)<br>
A comparative evaluation of the different versions of the expressed antigen will allow the<br>
selection of the most promising candidate that is to be used for further purification and<br>
immunological evaluation.<br>
9.2 Antibody production and immunohistochemistry<br>
Small amounts of relatively purified protein can be used to generate immunological<br>
tools in order to<br>
a) detect the expression by immunohistochemistry in normal or cancer tissue sections;<br>
b) detect the expression, and to follow the protein during the purification process<br>
(ELISA/ Western Blot); or<br>
c) characterise/ quantify the purified protein (ELISA).<br>
9.2.1 Polyclonal antibodies:<br>
Immunization<br>
Rabbits are immunised , intramuscularly (I.M.), 3 times at 3 weeks intervals with<br>
l00µg of protein, formulated in the adjuvant 3D-MPL/QS21. Three weeks after each<br>
immunisation a blood sample is taken and the antibody titer estimated in the serum by<br>
ELISA using the protein as coating antigen following a standard protocol.<br>
ELISA<br>
96 well microplates (maxisorb Nunc) are coated with 5µg of protein overnight at 4°C.<br>
After 1hour saturation at 37°C with PBS NCS 1%, serial dilution of the rabbit sera is<br>
added for 1H 30 at 37°C (starting at 1/10). After 3 washings in PBS Tween, anti rabbit<br>
biotinylated anti serum (Amersham ) is added (1/5000). Plates are washed and<br>
peroxydase coupled streptavidin (1/5000) is added for 30 min at 37°C. After washing,<br>
50ul TMB (BioRad) is added for 7 min and the reaction then stopped with H2SO4 0.2M.<br>
The OD can be measured at 450 ran and midpoint dilutions calculated by SoftmaxPro.<br>
9.2.2 Monoclonal antibodies:<br>
Immunization<br>
5 BALB/c mice are immunized 3 times at 3 week intervals with 5 µg of purified protein.<br>
Bleedings are performed 14 days post II and 1 week post 3. The sera are tested by Elisa<br>
on purified protein used as coated antigen. Based on these results (midpoint dilution &gt;<br>
10000 ) one mouse is selected for fusion.<br>
Fusion/ HATselection<br>
Spleen cells are fused with the SP2/0 myeloma according to a standard protocol using<br>
PEG 40% and DMSO 5%. Cells are then seeded in 96 well plates 2.5 xl04 - 105<br>
cells/well and resistant clones will be selected in HAT medium. The supernatant of these<br>
hybridomas will be tested for their content in specific antibodies and when positive,<br>
will be submitted to 2 cycles of limited dilution . After 2 rounds of screening, 3<br>
hybridomas will be chosen for ascitis production.<br>
9.2.3 Immunohistochemistry<br>
When antibodies are available, immuno staining is performed on normal or cancer tissue<br>
sections, in order to determine :<br>
0 the level of expression of the antigen of the invention in cancer relative to normal<br>
tissue or<br>
0 the proportion of cancer of a certain type expressing the antigen<br>
0 if other cancer types also express the antigen<br>
0 the proportion of cells expressing the antigen in a cancer tissue<br>
Tissue sample preparation<br>
After dissection, the tissue sample is mounted on a cork disk in OCT compound and<br>
rapidly frozen in isopentane previously super cooled in liquid nitrogen (-160°C). The<br>
block will then be conserved at -70°C until use. 7-10µm sections will be realised in a<br>
cryostat chamber (-20, -30°C).<br>
Staining<br>
Tissue sections are dried for 5 min at room Temperature (RT), fixed in acetone for<br>
l0min at RT, dried again, and saturated with PBS 0.5% BSA 5% serum. After 30 min at<br>
RT either a direct or indirect staining is performed using antigen specific antibodies. A<br>
direct staining leads to a better specificity but a less intense staining whilst an indirect<br>
staining leads to a more intense but less specific staining.<br>
9.3 Analysis of human cellular immune responses to the antigen of the invention<br>
The immunological relevance of the antigen of the invention can be assessed by in vitro<br>
priming of human T cells. All T cell lymphocyte lines and dendritic cells are derived<br>
from PBMCs (peripheral blood mononuclear cells) of healthy donors (preferred HLA-A2<br>
subtype). An HLA-A2.1/Kb trans genie mouse model is also used for screening of HLA-<br>
A2.1 peptides.<br>
Newly discovered antigen-specific CD8+ T cell lines are raised and maintained by<br>
weekly in vitro stimulation. The lytic activity and the y-IFN production of the CD8+ lines<br>
in response to the antigen or antigen derived-peptides is tested using standard procedures.<br>
Two strategies to raise the CD8+ T cell lines are used: a peptide-based approach and a<br>
whole gene-based approach. Both approaches require the full-length cDNA of the newly<br>
discovered antigen in the correct reading frame to be either cloned in an appropriate<br>
delivery system or to be used to predict the sequence of HLA binding peptides.<br>
Peptide-based approach<br>
Briefly, transgenic mice are immunized with adjuvanted HLA-A2 peptides, those unable<br>
to induce a CD8+ response (as defined by an efficient lysis of peptide-pulsed autologous<br>
spleen cells) will be further analyzed in the human system.<br>
Human dendritic cells (cultured according to Romani et al.) will be pulsed with peptides<br>
and used to stimulate CD8+ -sorted T cells (by Facs). After several weekly stimulations,<br>
the CD8+ lines will be first tested on peptide-pulsed autologous BLCL (EBV-B<br>
transformed cell lines). To verify the proper in vivo processing of the peptide, the CD8+<br>
lines will be tested on cDNA-transfected tumour cells (HLA-A2 transfected LnCaP,<br>
Skov3 or CAMA tumour cells).<br>
Whole gene-based approach<br>
CD8+ T cell lines will be primed and stimulated with either gene-gun transfected<br>
dendritic cells, retrovirally transduced B7.1-transfected fibroblasts, recombinant pox<br>
virus or adenovirus infected dendritic cells. Virus infected cells are very efficient to<br>
present antigenic peptides since the antigen is expressed at high level but can only be<br>
used once to avoid the over-growth of viral T cells lines.<br>
After alternated stimulations, the CD8+ lines are tested on cDNA-transfected tumour<br>
cells as indicated above. Peptide specificity and identity is determined to confirm the<br>
immunological validation.<br>
CD4+ T-cell response<br>
Similarly, the CD4+ T-cell immune response can also be assessed. Generation of specific<br>
CD4+ T-cells is made using dendritic cells loaded with recombinant purified protein or<br>
peptides to stimulate the T-cells.<br>
Predicted epitopes (nonamers and decamers) binding HLA alleles :<br>
The HLA Class I binding peptide sequences are predicted either by the Parker's<br>
algorithm (Parker, K. C, M. A. Bednarek, and J. E. Coligan. 1994. Scheme for ranking<br>
potential HLA-A2 binding peptides based on independent binding of individual peptide<br>
side-chains. J. Immunol. 152:163 and http://bimas.dcrt.nih.gov/molbio/hla_bind/) or the<br>
Rammensee method (Rammensee, Friede, Stevanovic, MHC ligands and peptide motifs:<br>
1st listing, Immunogenetics 41, 178-228, 1995 ; Rammensee, Bachmann, Stevanovic:<br>
MHC ligands and peptide motifs. Landes Bioscience 1997, and<br>
http://l34.2.96.221/scripts/hlaserver.dll/home.htm). Peptides are then screened in the<br>
HLA-A2.1/Kb transgenic mice model (Vitiello et al.).<br>
The HLA Class II binding peptide sequences are predicted using the Tepitope algorithm,<br>
with a score cut-offset to 6 (Stumiolo, Hammer at al., Nature Biotechnology. 1999.<br>
17;555-561).<br>
The following tables gather the Class I and II predicted epitope sequences :<br>
There is disclosed an immunogenic composition comprising a polypeptide which<br>
has at least 70% identity to the amino acid sequence of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO:10<br>
over the entire length of SEQ ID NO:2 or SEQ ID NO: 10;<br>
a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier; and<br>
a TH-1 inducing adjuvant for use in medicine.</td>
