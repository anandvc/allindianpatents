				<td>PRODUCTION PROCESS OF RECOMBINANT PLACENTAL GROWTH FACTOR<br>
DESCRIPTION<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
extracting and purifying the recombinant Placental Growth<br>
Factor from genetically modified cells.<br>
State of Art<br>
The Placental Growth Factor {PLGF) is a homodimeric<br>
glycoprotein with a structure similar to the Vascular<br>
Endothelial Growth Factor (VEGF). The complete<br>
polynucleotide sequence codifying the PLGF protein was<br>
described by Maglione and Persico in patent EP-B-550 519<br>
(WO-A-92/06194) claiming Italian priority of 27.09.1990.<br>
Alternative processes of splicing the ARN of PLGF<br>
generate three homologue forms of the Placental Growth<br>
Factor, precisely PLGF-1, PLGF-2 and PLGF-3, having<br>
different polypeptide sequences, and all described in<br>
literature.<br>
The above-mentioned patent also describes a method<br>
for producing the PLGF factor comprising the use of an<br>
inducible prokaryotic expression system characterised by<br>
host cells modified with an expression vector, in which<br>
the human PLGF gene is integrated under the control of an<br>
inducible promoter (directly or indirectly). After<br>
inducing the PLGF expression with appropriate activator,<br>
the cells are incubated, isolated and submitted to lysis.<br>
The so-obtained raw lysate is a complex mixture of<br>
proteins containing low quantities of the expressed PLGF<br>
protein and having low specific activity. In fact, in the<br>
known process, the protein expression is induced in<br>
cultures containing low cellular density, as it is<br>
evident from the low optical density at time of<br>
induction, that is between 0.2 and 0.6 OD at 600 ran.<br>
Furthermore, the process described in the preceding<br>
document does not comprise additional purification stages<br>
of the expressed protein. For this reason, the lysates<br>
obtained according to the application WO-A-92/06194 are<br>
inappropriate  as  such  to  be  used  directly  in the<br>
preparation of medicaments.<br>
A more complex method for purifying the same<br>
placental factor is envisaged by Maglione et al. in "I1<br>
Farmaco" 55 (2000), pages 165 to 167. Nevertheless, the<br>
method disclosure merely gives a simple listing of known<br>
applicable techniques, without describing conditions and<br>
experimental details thereof, which are essential for<br>
obtaining the PLGF protein in the purity and quantity<br>
necessary for a pharmaceutical use.<br>
The scope of the present invention is to provide a<br>
new method for extracting and purifying the recombinant<br>
PLGF expressed in bacterial cells, allowing to obtain<br>
PLGF at high level of purity and with yields suitable to<br>
be industrially used in the preparation of medicaments.<br>
A further scope of the invention is to obtain the<br>
PLGF protein in essentially active form (greater than<br>
98.5%), that is mainly composed by dimeric (not less than<br>
70%) and multimeric forms and containing residues of the<br>
monomeric form (little or not active) not greater than<br>
1.5%.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The invention is based upon the identification of a<br>
sequence of purification techniques particularly<br>
appropriate for the extraction and purification of human<br>
PLGF expressed in bacterial cells. The invention is<br>
further based upon the determination of the optimum<br>
operative conditions with respect to the single<br>
techniques and to the chemical-physical features of the<br>
substance to be purified.<br>
Then, object of the present invention is a process<br>
for extracting and purifying the recombinant Placental<br>
Growth Factor (PLGF) expressed by means of an inducible<br>
prokaryotic expression system comprising the steps of: I)<br>
fermentation of the bacterial cells, II) extraction and<br>
purification of the inclusion bodies, III) renaturation<br>
of   the   expressed   protein,    IV)    ion-exchange<br>
chromatography, V) reverse-phase chromatography, and<br>
optionally VI) final stages of ultrafiltration,<br>
formulation and lyophilization. According to such method,<br>
the fermentation (step I) is performed until obtaining a<br>
high bacterial density in the medium, as it is shown by<br>
the high optical density in the medium, before proceeding<br>
with the induction step. The step (II) comprises<br>
bacterial lysis, rupture of DNA and isolation of the<br>
inclusion bodies. The renaturation of the expressed<br>
protein (step III) is obtained by solubilizing the<br>
inclusion bodies in denaturant buffer, and by<br>
transforming, at least partially, the expressed protein<br>
in the dimeric form. At last, in the step (IV) and (V)<br>
the dimeric and multimeric forms of the expressed protein<br>
are separated from the monomeric form and isolated in<br>
pure form, to be subsequently ultrafiltrated and<br>
lyophilised in presence of usual lyophilisation and<br>
formulation additives.<br>
A specific object of the invention is the above-<br>
mentioned process for extracting and purifying the PLGF-1<br>
protein of human origin, but substantially valid also for<br>
PLGF-1 of animal origin.<br>
The claimed process advantageously allows the<br>
obtaining of production yields of expressed protein from<br>
30 to 50 times higher than the yields obtained according<br>
to the method described in the preceding state of art.<br>
The claimed process furthermore allows the obtaining of<br>
the highly pure protein, with high specific activity and<br>
in substantially dimeric form.<br>
Further object  of  the  invention  is  the  active<br>
Placental Growth Factor obtainable by means of the<br>
process of the invention, free from any residual protein<br>
or other bacterial contaminant and containing residues of<br>
monomeric form not higher than 1.5%.<br>
Description of the accompanying drawings <br>
Figure 1: The figure shows the results obtained by<br>
electrophoresis SDS-PAGE under reducing conditions for<br>
monitoring step I. Prel and Pre2 represent the pre-<br>
induction checks, prepared as follows. Soon before the<br>
induction, about 0,064 units of optical absorption<br>
measured at 600nm (OD600) are taken and diluted 5 times<br>
with water. Of this dilution 2 0 ul are taken which are<br>
added to 2 0 ul of reducing buffer and submitted to<br>
boiling. 20 ul of this last solution are loaded onto the<br>
SDS PAGE matrix. Postl and Post2 represent the post-<br>
induction checks prepared as above. M designates the<br>
mixture of markers of molecular weight. In the post-<br>
induction columns (Postl and Post2) a band is noted just<br>
above the indicator of molecular weight 14.3<br>
substantially absent in the pre-induction columns (Prel<br>
and Pre2) corresponding to the PLGF-1 protein expressed<br>
and segregated within the inclusion bodies.<br>
Figure 2: The figure shows the monitoring<br>
chromatogram of the anionic-exchange chromatography on Q-<br>
Sepharose Fast Flow resin. X-axis shows the elution<br>
volume (ML), y-axis shows the optical absorption units<br>
(OD) . The first elution peak obtained by eluting by 20%<br>
with buffer B (NaCl 200 mM) corresponds to the PLGF-1<br>
protein in substantially dimeric form, but it comprises<br>
impurities and the monomeric form. The following peak,<br>
eluted by 100% with buffer B (NaCl 1M) contains<br>
impurities which are eliminated.<br>
Figure 3: The figure shows the monitoring<br>
chromatogram of the first elution stage in reverse-phase<br>
chromatography on RP Source 3 0 resin. X-axis shows the<br>
elution volume (ml), y-axis shows the optical absorption<br>
units (OD). The first abundant elution peak corresponds<br>
to the various impurities, which do not bond to the<br>
resin. The second elution peak corresponds to the PLGF<br>
protein in monomeric form eluted under isochratic<br>
conditions (experimentally found at about 10%-15% of<br>
buffer B).<br>

units (OD) . The elution peak corresponds to the PLGF<br>
protein in dimeric-multimeric form.<br>
Figure 5: The figure shows the results obtained in<br>
electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE for the final monitoring of<br>
the whole process. Prerefol and Postrefol represent the<br>
checks preceding and following the renaturation of the<br>
expressed protein (step III) . QFF represents the peak<br>
eluted from the Q Sepharose fast flow resin, containing<br>
the protein mainly in dimeric form. Mon represents the<br>
peak containing the monomeric form. Dim represents the<br>
peak eluted in the second substep of the reverse-phase<br>
chromatography on RP Source 30 resin. It is noted that<br>
before the renaturation, the expressed protein is mainly<br>
in monomeric form. After the renaturation, part of the<br>
protein is in dimeric form. The following purification on<br>
QFF and RF 30 chromatography allow the obtaining of PLGF-<br>
1 protein with high purity degree.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
The genetic modification of the bacterial host cells<br>
is described by Maglione et al. in the preceding patent<br>
EP-B-0550519 (WO-A-92/06194) . For this purpose, bacterial<br>
cells are transformed introducing of an expression vector<br>
comprising an insert corresponding to the" human gene<br>
coding for PLGF-1 factor. The complete gene sequence is<br>
known in literature and it is freely accessible. A<br>
plasmid containing such sequence was deposited with the<br>
ATCC under accession number ATCC No 40892. The expression<br>
is performed under the control of the system of RNA<br>
polymerase of T7 phage and it is induced with IPTG<br>
(isopropyl-ß-D-tiogalactopyranoside).<br>
Nevertheless, other inducible prokaryotic expression<br>
systems may be utilised. Examples of such systems,<br>
obtainable on the market, are represented by:<br>
1) pBAD expression system (In vitrogen BV) wherein<br>
the synthesis of a protein is placed under the control of<br>
the araBAD promoter and it may be induced in different<br>
strains of E.Coli by means of arabinose.<br>
2)  T7 Expression System (In vitrogen BV or Promega)<br>
wherein the synthesis of a protein is controlled by the<br>
promoter of RNA polymerase of T7 phage and it may be<br>
induced by means of lactose or the analogues thereof<br>
(IPTG) . In this case it is required the use of E.Coli<br>
derivatives  of  DE3  (B12KDE3)  or  JM109(DE3))  type<br>
containing, namely, a copy of the gene of Rna polymerase<br>
of T7 phage placed under the control of a lactose-<br>
inducible promoter.<br>
3)  Trc expression system (In vitrogen BV) wherein<br>
the synthesis of a protein is placed under the control of<br>
the trc hybrid promoter. Such promoter has been obtained<br>
by melting the trp promoter and the lac promoters and it<br>
may be induced in different strains of E.Coli by means of<br>
lactose or the analogues thereof (IPTG).<br>
4)   Tac  expression  system  (Amerham biosciences)<br>
wherein the synthesis of a protein is placed under the<br>
control of the tac promoter. In this system the protein<br>
synthesis is induced in strains of E.Coli laclq (type<br>
JM105) by means of lactose or the analogues thereof<br>
(IPTG) .<br>
5)  Px, expression system wherein the synthesis of a<br>
protein is placed under the control of the PL promoter<br>
and it may be induced by adding tryptophan. In this case<br>
it is required the use of E.Coli derivatives (GI724)<br>
containing a copy of the codifying gene for the cI<br>
repressor of the Lambda phage placed under the control of<br>
a tryptophan-inducible promoter.<br>
Step I: Fermentation and induction<br>
The first stage of the claimed process consists in<br>
the fermentation of a functionally-modified bacterial<br>
strain equivalent to the strain described in the<br>
preceding European patent (above). In a preferred<br>
embodiment the micro-organism is a derivative of<br>
Escherichia Coli modified with an expression plasmid<br>
comprising the human gene of PLGF. A preferred micro-<br>
organism  is  the  one  called  [B12(DE3)pLysS  PLGF-1]<br>
obtained by integrating in the commercially available<br>
strain [B12(DE3)pLysS] (Promega Corporation USA) the gene<br>
of the human PLGF-1. The present invention, nevertheless,<br>
is not limited to the human PLGF-1 factor, but it also<br>
relates to the one of animal origin  (monkey,  mouse,<br>
rabbit etc.). The present invention is not limited so<br>
much the less to the use of a E. Coli derivative, but it<br>
includes  the use  of  any prokaryotic  micro-organism<br>
susceptible to be genetically modified and able to<br>
express heterologous proteins under the form of inclusion<br>
bodies.<br>
The strains utilised as inoculum in the process of<br>
the invention are kept before using them in the<br>
lyophilised form to preserve the expression capacity<br>
thereof. Upon use, the lyophilised material is brought<br>
again in solution by utilising an appropriate buffer.<br>
Although there is a wide range of known culture<br>
media available on the market and which may be<br>
effectively used, the fermentation step according to the<br>
invention is preferably performed in a medium free from<br>
any material of animal or human origin in order to avoid<br>
any infection risk. Yeast"s extracts (Difco) added with<br>
one or more suitable antibiotics represent the most<br>
suitable means for the process. In the preferred<br>
embodiment a medium is used which has been obtained by<br>
mixing under sterility conditions a first solution (A)<br>
containing yeast"s extracts, glycerol and ammonium<br>
sulphate with a second solution- (B) containing a<br>
phosphate buffer. The mixture is then integrated with<br>
ampicillin and chloramphenicol or equivalent antibiotics.<br>
Appropriate antibiotic concentrations are from 50 to 300<br>
ug/ml of ampicillin, preferably from 100 to 200 ug/ml and<br>
from 10 to 100 ug/ml of chloramphenicol, preferably from<br>
30 to 40 ug/ml.<br>
The  fermentation  step  may  be  preceded  by  a<br>
preinoculum step wherein the lyophilised micro-organism<br>
is suspended in the medium and submitted to consecutive<br>
incubation and dilution steps aimed at having in culture<br>
the optimum quantity of micro-organism cells. Preferably,<br>
the micro-organism is incubated for one night at 37°C,<br>
then diluted and incubated again for some hours. The<br>
chosen pre-inoculum volume is subsequently centrifuged,<br>
suspended again in the culture solution enriched with<br>
ampicillin and inoculated in the fermentation vessel for<br>
the fermentation step.<br>
The fermentation is performed in the above-mentioned<br>
medium added with ampicillin and chloramphenicol at the<br>
temperature suitable for the micro-organism, usually at<br>
about 37°C, in presence of a percentage of dissolved 02,<br>
with respect to the saturation with air, from 20% to 40%,<br>
preferably 30%. The pH during fermentation is kept at<br>
neutral or weakly acid values (6.4 to 7.4). Furthermore,<br>
since the fermentation process takes place under<br>
stirring, antifoam agents are preferably to be used.<br>
The fermentation progress is accompanied by the<br>
increase in the optical density of the medium. For this<br>
reason, the optical density is the parameter utilised<br>
according to the invention to monitor the progress degree<br>
of the fermentation. Readings at 600 nm are particularly<br>
appropriate.<br>
Essential feature of the invention is the high<br>
cellular density achieved in the culture at time of the<br>
expression induction. Optical densities at 600 nm (OD600)<br>
from 1 to 50 may be achieved thanks to culture media of<br>
the invention. Densities higher than 18, nevertheless,<br>
are preferred to obtain the high production levels<br>
typical of the claimed method. Densities between 16 and<br>
2 0 are particularly preferred to induce the producing<br>
bacterial strain and gave optimum results. The<br>
fermentation, then, is kept at the above-mentioned<br>
conditions until achieving such values of optical<br>
density,  then  one  proceeds  to  induce  the  protein<br>
expression.<br>
Any agent or chemical-physical condition able to<br>
induce in the cells of the used micro-organism the<br>
machinery of expression of the heterologous protein may<br>
be advantageously utilised. In the specific case wherein<br>
the bacterial strain BL21(DE3)pLysS modified with an<br>
expression plasmid containing the promoter of 11 phage is<br>
used, the expression is induced with lactose or the<br>
derivatives thereof, such as isopropyl-b-<br>
tiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) with a proper concentration,<br>
namely about l mM. The induction duration may vary<br>
according to need. Good results are obtained for periods<br>
of some hours, preferably from 3 to 4 hours; in the<br>
optimum process the induction is kept for 3 hours and 2 0<br>
minutes by using a percentage of dissolved 02 equal to<br>
about 10%.<br>
Cell samples are taken before and after induction<br>
and submitted to analytical techniques of control such as<br>
electrophoresis on SDS-PAGE, to determine the induction<br>
outcome.<br>
When the protein expression reaches the desired<br>
levels, the culture is centrifuged and the cells are<br>
moved to the following step.<br>
Step II; Extraction and purification.<br>
The expressed heterologous protein in bacterial<br>
strains is segregated inside the cell itself in the form<br>
of inclusion bodies. Therefore, the process of the<br>
invention provides passages of lysis of the cells,<br>
rupture of the extracted nucleic material (DNA) and<br>
recovery and washing of the inclusion bodies.<br>
The cells are washed, although not necessarily, and<br>
suspended in solutions containing emnulsifier agents in<br>
appropriate concentration, preferably Triton X100 in<br>
concentrations from 0.5% to 1%, then they are submitted<br>
to lysis of the cellular membrane. The lysis process may<br>
be performed by means of freezing/thawing, French Press,<br>
sonication   or   other   similar   <br>
known   techniques.<br>
Nevertheless, the preferred, method for the bacterial<br>
strain BL21(DE3)pLysS is the freezing/thawing method,<br>
which in the most preferred embodiment is repeated at<br>
least for two consecutive cycles. After the mechanical<br>
lysis, the lysis stage is continued for a few minutes in<br>
the lysis solution at room temperature under stirring.<br>
The release in the lysis medium of the inclusion<br>
bodies is accompanied by the release of micro-organism<br>
different components and cellular substances, above all<br>
the nucleic materials. These substances could interfere<br>
with and jeopardise the following protein purification<br>
process. Therefore, the suspension/solution obtained by<br>
lysis is submitted to rupture of such nucleic material,<br>
specifically DNA, by means of enzymatic agents such-as<br>
DNAse (natural or recombinant such as the Benzonase),<br>
chemical agents, such as deoxycholic acid, or physical-<br>
mechanical agents, such as sonication or high energy<br>
stirring by means of blades, for example, in a mixer. The<br>
rupture of DNA, carried out for example in a mixer, is<br>
performed on lysed cells re-suspended in appropriate<br>
volumes of washing solutions containing chelating and<br>
deterging agents, for example EDTA and Triton X100. It is<br>
preferably repeated for more cycles, preferably 2,<br>
alternated with stages of dilution, in washing solution,<br>
centrifugation and elimination of tne supernatant in<br>
order to remove components and cellular substances from<br>
the fraction containing the inclusion bodies.<br>
Step III Renaturation (refolding) of the protein<br>
The  fraction containing  the  purified inclusion<br>
bodies of PLGF-1 is then solubilised in denaturing buffer<br>
containing  known  denaturant  agents  such  as  urea,<br>
guanidine    isothiocyanate,    guanidine-hydrochloride.<br>
Preferably, the denaturant solution is a urea solution in<br>
denaturant concentration, for example 8M. In order to<br>
accelerate the solubilisation process, the fraction may<br>
advantageous  be   submitted  to   homogenisation  or<br>
sonication. After solubilizing the inclusion bodies, the<br>
solution is diluted with the same denaturant buffer until<br>
obtaining an optical density measured at 280 nm of about<br>
0,8 (OD280 0.8). Subsequently, the solution is further<br>
diluted with a dilution buffer until 0.5 OD280. Suitable<br>
dilution solutions contain salts and polyethylene glycol<br>
(PEG) and have basic pH (about 8) . The renaturation of<br>
the PLGF-1 protein in diluted solution is obtained by<br>
adding to the solution appropriate concentrations of<br>
oxidising/reducing pairs, followed by an incubation of 10<br>
to 30 hours, preferably 18 to 20 at a temperature of 10°C<br>
to 30°C, preferably 20°C, under stirring. Examples of<br>
such pairs are: Cystine/Cysteine, Cystamine/ Cysteamine,<br>
2-hydroxyethyldisulphide/2-mercapto-ethanol. Preferred<br>
example of oxidising/reducing pair is the glutathione in<br>
its oxidised and reduced forms, respectively at<br>
concentrations between 0.1 mM and 2.5 mM (preferably 0.5<br>
mM) and between 0.25 mM and 6.25 mM (preferably 1.25 mM).<br>
By means of renaturation, the PLGF-1 protein expressed<br>
essentially in monomeric form is partially brought back<br>
to the dimeric form (Figure 5).<br>
Step IV: anionic-exchange chromatography<br>
The solution coming from the preceding step,<br>
preferably through centrifugation and/or filtration and<br>
containing the protein in mainly monomeric and partially<br>
dimeric form, is loaded onto anion-exchange resin in<br>
order to enrich the mixture with the dimeric form and to<br>
purify it from bacterial contaminants. Any commercially<br>
available matrix suitable for anion-exchange<br>
chromatography may be likewise used to the extent that<br>
its features of capacity, loading and flow speed be<br>
similar to those of the Q Sepharose Fast Flow resin<br>
(Amersham biosciences) , apart from being suitable for an<br>
industrial process. In a preferred embodiment a high-flow<br>
resin is used, for example Q-sepharose Fast Flow<br>
(Amersham biosciences) or equivalent. The resin is washed<br>
and equilibrated with solutions having low ionic<br>
strength.  An  example  of  such  solution  comprises<br>
ethanolamine-HCl pH 8.5 with.low or absent salt content.<br>
The same solution may be utilised for loading, absorbing<br>
and washing the protein mixture to be purified. The used<br>
resins allow loading of large volumes of protein solution<br>
with ratios Volume loaded/Volume column varying from 1:1<br>
to 10:1. Ratios Vol./Vol. next to 10:1 are preferred<br>
since they allow optimising the use of the column.<br>
However, ratios higher than 10:1 are to be avoided since,<br>
due to the saturation of the adsorbing capacity of the<br>
matrix, they lead to high loss in the dimeric form of the<br>
protein.<br>
Whereas the PLGF-1 protein in monomeric form already<br>
percolates in the stages of washing with low ionic<br>
strength, the elution of the dimeric and multimeric forms<br>
is obtained by increasing the ionic strength of the<br>
starting solution. Such increase is obtained by mixing<br>
the equilibration solution with increasing and pre-<br>
established percentages of a second solution containing<br>
NaCl 1M. In a preferred embodiment, the protein in<br>
dimeric form is eluted with solutions containing from 15%<br>
to 25% of NaCl 1 M solution, which corresponds to a NaCl<br>
concentration from 150 to 250 mM. In the best embodiment,<br>
the protein is eluted in isochratic conditions at NaCl<br>
concentration of 200 mM. The elution of the various<br>
species is automatically monitored by measuring the<br>
optical absorption at 280nm (figure 2) . The collected<br>
fractions containing the PLGF-1 protein in dimeric form<br>
are subsequently controlled by electrophoresis SDS-PAGE<br>
(figure 5). Advantageously, the whole chromatography<br>
process is automatically performed by a computerised<br>
system operating under the control of a suitable<br>
programme, for example the Software FPCL Director system<br>
(Amersham biosciences).<br>
Step V: Reverse-phase chromatography<br>
The fractions coming from the preceding step<br>
containing the PLGF-1 protein enriched with the active<br>
forms are collected, diluted with appropriate buffer and<br>
loaded onto an reverse-phase chromatography column in<br>
order to further purify the protein in active form. The<br>
quantity of loaded solution corresponds to OD280 between<br>
4.5 and 5.5 per millilitre of chromatographic matrix.<br>
Such quantities are to be considered maximum quantities.<br>
Any commercially available chromatographic matrix<br>
suitable for the intended use may be utilised to the<br>
extent that its features of loading capacity and flow<br>
speed are compatible with the process requirements. In a<br>
preferred embodiment, a resin is used having such bead-<br>
sizes so as to guarantee the best exploitation of the<br>
absorbing capability together with the easiness in<br>
packing the column itself. Examples of such matrixes are<br>
the RP Source 15 or RP Source 30 (Amersham biosciences)<br>
resins. All the solutions for equilibration, loading,<br>
resin washing and elution are hydro-organic solutions<br>
comprising different percentages of organic solvent.<br>
Examples of such solutions are solutions comprising<br>
ethanol, methanol or acetonitrile. Preferably, hydro-<br>
alcoholic solutions comprising increasing percentages of<br>
ethanol are utilised. In an embodiment of the invention<br>
appropriate quantities of two buffer solutions are mixed,<br>
the former comprising buffer A, i.e. ethanol 40% and TFA<br>
(trifluoroacetic acid) 0.1%, the latter comprising buffer<br>
B, i.e. ethanol 70% and TFA 0.1%.<br>
The protein material loaded onto the resin and<br>
properly washed is then eluted through an elution process<br>
comprising two subsequent stages wherein elution<br>
solutions containing an increasing gradient of organic<br>
solvent are utilised. The first stage is performed under<br>
conditions of rising gradient of organic solvent until<br>
obtaining the elution peak of the monomeric form. Such<br>
gradient is obtained by adding the buffer B to the buffer<br>
A in percentages from 4% to 40%, with an increasing rate<br>
of buffer B of 3% for each eluted column volume. As soon<br>
as the elution peak corresponding to the monomeric form<br>
of the protein appears, the elution is continued under<br>
isochratic conditions until. exhaustion of the elution<br>
peak of the monomeric form. The so-set isochratic<br>
conditions cause the largest possible separation of the<br>
chromatographic peaks corresponding to the two monomeric<br>
and dimeric forms and, then, the best obtainable<br>
resolution for a process of industrial, and not<br>
analytical type. The second stage is performed again<br>
under condition of increasing gradient of organic solvent<br>
until whole elution of the protein mainly in dimeric form<br>
is achieved. In this second stage, the gradient is<br>
obtained by adding the buffer B to the buffer A in<br>
percentages from 10% to 100%, with an increasing rate of<br>
buffer B of 40.9% for each eluted column volume. The<br>
elution of the various forms of PLGF-1 protein is<br>
automatically monitored by measuring the optical<br>
absorption at 280nm (figure 3 and figure 4) . The<br>
collected fractions containing the PLGF-1 protein<br>
essentially in dimeric form are subsequently controlled<br>
by electrophoresis SDS-PAGE (figure 5) . Advantageously,<br>
the whole reverse-phase chromatography process is<br>
automatically performed by a computerised system<br>
operating under the control of a suitable programme, for<br>
example the Software FPCL Director system (Amersham<br>
biosciences).<br>
The results of the electrophoresis show that PLGF-1<br>
protein obtained from the second stage of the reverse-<br>
phase chromatography is in highly pure active form,<br>
namely it comprises the protein in dimeric and partially<br>
multimeric form, but it is essentially free from any<br>
contamination of the monomeric form. The so-obtained<br>
product comprises not less than 98.5% of active form,<br>
preferably not less than 99.5%, wherein not less than 70%<br>
is in dimeric form. The residual of monomeric form is not<br>
higher than 1.5%. The protein in active form is obtained<br>
in average amounts of 160 mg per litre of bacterial<br>
culture. The pure protein obtained according to the<br>
above-described method may be submitted to additional<br>
working stages such as ultrafiltration on membrane. In<br>
this case the product is filtered on membrane having cut-<br>
off limit lower than, or equal to 3 0kD and it is<br>
submitted to diafiltration against TFA acidulated water<br>
until a dilution factor of 1:106. The so-obtained final<br>
product may be properly formulated with lyophilisation<br>
additives and lyophilised to keep its best biological<br>
activity.<br>
The invention is here below described by means of<br>
examples having, however, only illustrating and not<br>
limiting purposes.<br>

The solutions A and B are separately autoclaved and<br>
mixed upon use under sterile conditions. Alternatively,<br>
the solutions A and B are mixed and filtered under<br>
sterile conditions.<br>
IPTG 200mM (200X) is produced by dissolving 5 g of<br>
pure substance in 100 ml of distilled water. The solution<br>
is filtered by means of 0.22-um filters, subdivided into<br>
aliquots and frozen at -20°C.<br>
The utilised antifoam agent is Antifoam O-10 (not<br>
siliconic) Sigma Cat A-8207.<br>
The used bacterial strain is [BL21pLysS PlGF-1 WCB]<br>
(working cell bank).<br>
Preinoculum: A tube of lyophilised genetically<br>
modified micro-organism (MOGM) WCB is taken and it is<br>
suspended in 1 ml of SBM + 100 ug/ml Ampicillin + 34<br>
ug/ml of chloramphenicol.<br>
The suspension is diluted in 3 0 ml of SBM + 100<br>
ug/ml Ampicillin + 34 ug/ml of chloramphenicol.<br>
The suspension is incubated at 37°C for one night<br>
(O/N) . The day after the 3 0 ml of the O/N culture are<br>
diluted in 800 ml of SBM + 100 ug/ml Ampicillin + 34<br>
ug/ml of chloramphenicol and they are subdivided into 4<br>
1-liter Erlenmeyer flasks, each containing 200 ml.<br>
The content of each flask is incubated at 37°C for<br>
24 hours. The content of the 4 flasks is mixed and the<br>
OD600 are read by diluting 1/20 in water (50 ul + 950 ul<br>
of water).<br>
An established volume of preinoculum is then<br>
centrifuged for 10 min. at 7.500 x g at 4°C in sterile<br>
tubes.<br>
The bacteria are then re-suspended in 20 ml of SBM +<br>
200 ug/ml of Ampicillin + 10 ug/ml chloramphenicol per<br>
each litre of fermentation by stirring at 420 rpm at R.T.<br>
for 20 minutes. At the same time the fermentation vessel<br>
is prepared and the oxygen probes are calibrated.<br>
The oxygen probes are calibrated at 37°C temperature<br>
at 0% with nitrogen, then at 100% with air without<br>
antifoam under stirring at 600 RPM.<br>
The fermentation is carried out under the following<br>
experimental conditions:<br>
Medium: SBM + 200ug/ml of ampicillin and 10 ug/ml<br>
of chloramphenicol<br>
Temperature:       37°C<br>
% dissolved 02: 30% (with respect to saturation<br>
with air)<br>
pH:       from 6.4 to 7.4.<br>
Antifoam: 1:10 is diluted in water; strongly<br>
stirring before adding it in quantities of 140 ul per 750<br>
ml of medium.<br>
Induction:<br>
The induction is carried out under the following<br>
experimental conditions:<br>
OD600 of induction: 16-20.<br>
Inducing agent:    IPTG lmM final.<br>
% dissolved 02: 10% (with respect to saturation<br>
with air).<br>
Induction length:  3 hours and 2 0 minutes.<br>
Just before the induction 2 0 ul of bacteria are<br>
taken, added to 80 ul of water and kept for the pre-<br>
induction check.<br>
At time of induction, IPTG is added to the final<br>
concentration of 1 mM.<br>
The percentage of dissolved 02 is brought to 10%.<br>
At the end of the induction the final OD600 are read<br>
and the overall volume is measured.<br>
Then, 10 ul of bacteria are taken, added to 90 ul of<br>
water and kept for the post-induction check.<br>
The induction is controlled by way of a SDS-PAGE<br>
electrophoresis by loading 20 m1 of the 2 previously<br>
boiled samples.<br>
The medium containing the induced bacteria is then<br>
centrifuged at 7.500 x g for 10 min. or at 3000 x g for<br>
25 min. at 4°C and the supernatant is eliminated.<br>
Results: The induction results are checked by SDS-<br>
PAGE electrophoresis as shown in figure 1.<br>
Example 2: Extraction and purification of the<br>
inclusion bodies.<br>
The following procedure relates to the preparation<br>
and refolding of the inclusion bodies of PlGF-1. By means<br>
of refolding the PLGF-1 bacterial protein is partially<br>
brought back to the dimeric form.<br>
Material:<br>
Mixer with appropriate capacity.<br>
Lysis solution: 1 mM Mg2SO4 + 20mM Tris-HCl pH8<br>
+ Triton X100 by 1%.<br>
Washing solution: 0.5% triton X100 + 10 mM EDTA pH<br>
8.<br>
BD (denaturing buffer): 8 M urea, 50<br>
mM Tris pH 8, Ethylenediamine 20mM.<br>
Dissolving and bringing to volume in H2O.<br>
Oxidised glutathione 200x:   100 mM in H2O;<br>
Reduced glutathione 20Ox:    25 0 mM in H2O.<br>
Dilution buffer:   600 uM final PEG 4000 (2.4g/l),<br>
50 mM Tris-HCl pH 8, 20 mM NaCl.<br>
Antifoam: Antifoam O-10 (not siliconic) Sigma.<br>
Preparation of the PLGF-1 inclusion bodies.<br>
The lysis and washing solutions are equilibrated at<br>
room temperature (RT).<br>
Two cycles of freezing/thawing at -80/37°C are<br>
performed.<br>
The bacterial pellet is lysed in 1 ml of lysis<br>
solution per each 450 OD600 of bacteria.<br>
It is then incubated at RT 3 0 min. under stirring<br>
(250 RPM).<br>
The solution is poured into a mixer with appropriate<br>
capacity and a quantity of washing solution of 3 ml for<br>
each 450 OD600 of bacteria is added.<br>
If necessary, 0.4 ul of not-diluted antifoam per<br>
each millilitre of sample are added.<br>
The solution is spun at the maximum speed for 1<br>
minute or until the sample is well homogeneous.<br>
The content of the mixer is then transferred into a<br>
container with appropriate capacity and 6,5 ml of washing<br>
solution per each 450 OD600 of bacteria are added. It is<br>
incubated for 45 min. at RT under stirring.<br>
The so-obtained suspension is centrifuged at 13.000<br>
x g for 45 min. at 25°C and the supernatant is<br>
discharged.<br>
The settled pellet is re-suspended in 4 ml of<br>
washing solution per each 450 OD600 of bacteria and the<br>
cycle in the mixer is repeated for the second time.<br>
The suspension is transferred into a container with<br>
appropriate capacity, diluted with 6.5 ml of washing<br>
solution per each 450 OD600 and incubated for 30 min. at<br>
RT under stirring.<br>
The centrifugation under the above seen conditions<br>
is then repeated and the supernatant is eliminated.<br>
Example 3: Renaturation of the protein.<br>
The inclusion bodies are solubilised in 7 ml of<br>
denaturing buffer BD (containing urea 8M) and further<br>
diluted in BD until OD280 of 0,8. Subsequently, 0.6<br>
volumes of dilution buffer are added in order to bring<br>
the final urea concentration to 5M.<br>
Afterwards 1/200 of reduced glutathione 200X (final<br>
concentration of 1,25 mM) and 1/2 00 of oxidised<br>
glutathione 200X (final concentration of 0.5 mM) are<br>
added. A 15 ml sample for checking (prerefol) is taken<br>
and the solution is then incubated at 20°C for 18-20<br>
hours under stirring.<br>
At the end of the incubation, the medium is<br>
centrifuged for 10 min. at 20°C, 10.000 x g, filtered by<br>
means of 0.45 or 0.8 mm filters and a 15 ml sample is<br>
taken for checking (postrefol).<br>
Results: The 15-ml samples of the pre,- and post-<br>
refolding solutions are analysed by means of SDS-PAGE<br>
electrophoresis (figure 5).<br>
Example 4: Anion-exchange chromatography<br>
The following procedure relates to the first step of<br>
purification of the PlGF-1 protein after refolding. Upon<br>
loading of the sample onto the column, there will be a<br>
high loss of not-absorbed PlGF-1 monomer. The loaded<br>
quantity must not exceed 10 times the volumes of the<br>
column, since this would cause a significant loss in the<br>
PLGF-1 dimer.<br>
The elution is performed under isochratic conditions<br>
at 20% of buffer B (see below) , which corresponds to a<br>
NaCl concentration of 200 mM.  The eluted peak still<br>
contains  the glutathiones .used for refolding,  which<br>
contribute by about 50% of OD280.<br>
Material and parameters:<br>
FPLC system: Amersham-biosciences handled by the<br>
software called FPLC Director.<br>
Monitoring parameters<br>
U.V.:    Wavelength = 280 nm; scale top - 2.<br>
Temperature:  20°C (minimum 15, maximum 25)<br>
Resin: Q-sepharose Fast Flow (Amersham-<br>
biosciences) .<br>
Column volume/height: Volume: 1/10 of volume of<br>
the sample to be loaded; height: between 13 and 16 cm.<br>
Equilibration: 2 Column Volume (CV) of buffer<br>
B, then 1.5 CV of buffer A.<br>
Sample: Renatured, centrifuged and/or filtrated<br>
PlGF-1. Load no more than 10 CV thereof.<br>
Buffer A: 20 mM Ethanolamine-HCl pH 8.5.<br>
Buffer B: Buffer A + 1M NaCl.<br>
Injection speed: 1 cm/min (maximum speed tested<br>
on small columns = 1.887 cm/min; minimum tested speed =<br>
0.5 cm/min.).<br>
Elution speed: 1 cm/min (maximum speed tested on<br>
small columns = 1.887 cm/min; minimum tested speed = 0.5<br>
cm/min.).<br>
Washings after<br>
injection:    1.5 CV with 0% of buffer B.<br>
Peak collected: Peak eluted at isochratic<br>
conditions at 20% of buffer B, running for about 3 CV.<br>
Final washing: 2 CV at 100% B.<br>
Procedure:<br>
The peak eluted under isochratic conditions at 20%<br>
of buffer B is collected, then 0.271 water volumes,<br>
0.0045 TFA volumes and 0.225 ethanol volumes are added<br>
thereto. In this way the sample results to be diluted 1.5<br>
times and contains 15% ethanol and 0.3% TFA. The addition<br>
of these 2 substances facilitates the bounding of PlGF-1<br>
to the reverse-phase resin (see example 5).<br>
Results: The chromatography step is continuously-<br>
controlled by monitoring the optical densities at 280 nm<br>
as illustrated by figure 2 .<br>
The purity of the isolated protein material is<br>
analysed by means of SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (figure 5).<br>
Example 5: Reverse-phase chromatography.<br>
The following procedure may be performed with RP<br>
source resin with 15 micron or 30 micron average particle<br>
diameter. However, the 30-micron RP source resin, while<br>
not involving any alteration in the purification process,<br>
allows an economical saving of the resin itself (about<br>
50%) , a greater easiness in the packaging procedure of<br>
the column and a lower backpressure.<br>
The procedure relates to the second phase of the<br>
purification of the PlGF-1 protein after passing on the<br>
QFF resin. During the sample injection, a high adsorbance<br>
is apparent and corresponds to the not adsorbed peak of<br>
the glutathiones which do not bound to the resin. This<br>
procedure consists of 2 sub-stages, the former called<br>
RPCmon, is used to eliminate most of the monomeric<br>
component of PlGF-1, whereas the latter is used to elute<br>
the essentially dimeric component of the protein and it<br>
is called RPCdim.<br>
First sub-stage (RPCmon)<br>
Material and parameters:<br>
FPLC system: Amersham-biosciences handled by the<br>
software called FPLC Director.<br>
Monitoring parameters<br>
U.V. :    Wavelength = 280 nm; full scale = 0.05.<br>
Temperature:       20°C (minimum 15, maximum 25)<br>
Resin: Reverse Phase Source 3 0 (Amersham-<br>
biosciences) .<br>
Resin volume/height: Volume: 1/5 - 1/6 of the<br>
overall OD280 of the sample to be loaded; height: between<br>
27 and 33 cm.<br>
Equilibration: 2 Column Volume (CV) of buffer B,<br>
then 2 CV of buffer A.<br>
Sample: P1GF-1 coming from the preceding step<br>
(example 4), diluted 1.5 times and containing ethanol 15%<br>
and TFA 0.3%. Loading max. 4.5 to 5.5 OD280 per ml of<br>
resin.<br>
Buffer A:                        Ethanol 40% + TFA 0.1%.<br>
Buffer B:                        Ethanol 70% + TFA 0.1%.<br>
Injection speed:   1.887 cm/min.<br>
Elution speed:     1.887 cm/min.<br>
Washings after<br>
injection:    1.5 CV with 4% buffer B.<br>
Monomer peak: Gradient ranging from 4 to 40% of B in<br>
12 CV (3%B/CV) . Just after starting the elution of the<br>
peak, by OD280 reaching 25% of the full scale, the<br>
elution is continued with isochratic conditions with the<br>
buffer B concentration reached in that moment until the<br>
peak elution is complete (about 2.5 -3.5 CV).<br>
Operations<br>
A suitable quantity of the solution corresponding to<br>
the "monomer" peak is taken and it is concentrated for<br>
checking (mon in Fig. 5).<br>
Second sub-stage (RPCdim)<br>
Material and parameters:<br>
Without re-equilibrating the column, but by simply<br>
shifting the scale range of the UV monitor to the value<br>
2, a gradient ranging from 10 to 100%-of the buffer B is<br>
run in 2.2 CV (40.9%B/CV).<br>
Operations:<br>
The fractions corresponding to the "Dimer" peak are<br>
taken. Figure 4 illustrates an example thereof. They are<br>
collected and the volume and the optical density at 280<br>
nm are measured.<br>
The overall yield (expressed in mg) obtained before<br>
the lyophilisation is calculated by multiplying the OD280<br>
times the volume times the dilution. The average value of<br>
such yield is 164 mg of pure PLGF-1 per litre of<br>
bacterial culture with a standard deviation of 23.21. It<br>
may also be expressed in mg per 1000 OD600 of fermented<br>
bacteria, resulting to 5.58 mg of pure PLGF-1 each 1000<br>
OD600 of fermented bacteria with a standard deviation of<br>
0.8.<br>
The so-obtained dimer solution is kept at -2 0°C<br>
until ultradiafiltration and lyophilisation. A sample of<br>
such solution is submitted to SDS-PAGE electrophoresis as<br>
illustrated in figure 5.<br>
