				<td>A FAST CALL SETUP METHOD<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
This invention relates to communications. Specifically, the setup of a communication call.<br>
Description of the Prior Art:<br>
Conventional communications networks often include packet-switched technology.<br>
Although circuit-switched networks were implemented first, they are an older more traditional<br>
technology. Packet-switched networks are newer more flexible networks. A wide variety of new<br>
applications are being implemented to take advantage of the flexibility of these packet-switched<br>
networks.<br>
In a packet-switched network, packets may take a variety of different paths to arrive at a<br>
given destination. A message is first fragmented into packets, communicated across a network,<br>
and then combined back into the original message. Since the packets do not all take the same path,<br>
packet-switched networks have gained wide acceptance. For example, if a link goes down on a<br>
path, the packets can all be re-routed and still reach their destination with minimal effort.<br>
In general, packet-switched networks are being widely deployed and will continue to be<br>
widely deployed in the foreseeable future. However, packet-switched networks are not without<br>
their problems and the advent of new technologies and applications highlight some of these<br>
problems. For example, one of the slower aspects of a packet-switched communication session is<br>
the initial setup of the call. In addition, in many applications, such as push-to-talk, etc., there are<br>
times when a full circuit is not required, but instead there is a need to transmit just a few bits.<br>
Unfortunately, conventional packet-switched technologies and protocols were not initially<br>
designed for these types of applications and, as such, perform poorly when these applications are<br>
implemented.<br>
An example of a conventional implementation of a packet-based network will be shown in<br>
Fig. 1A and Fig. IB. Fig. 1A displays a conventional message process flow diagram. In Fig. 1A, a<br>
Mobile Station (MS) 100 is shown. The MS 100 is in communication with a Base Station<br>
Subsystem (BSS) 102. The BSS 102 includes a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) 104 that is in<br>
communication with a Base Station Controller (BSC) 106. The BSC 106 also includes a Call<br>
Processor (CP) 108, a Resource Manager (RM) 120, and a Routing Agent (RA) 112. The RA 112<br>
is in communication with an MSC 120 and a Packet Control Function (PCF) 114. The BSC 106<br>
communicates with a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 120 and a PCF 114. The PCF 114 is in<br>
communication with an IP network 116. An Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting<br>
(AAA) server 122 may be accessed through the IP network 116. A PDSN 118 is also in<br>
communication with the IP Network 116.<br>
In a conventional system, the MS 100 generates an origination message 124. Origination<br>
for routing 126 is performed between the BTS 104 and the RA 112. The RA 112 communicates<br>
the origination to the Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 120. The MSC 120 conducts a setup<br>
conversation 132 with the RA 112. The RA 112 communicates a resource allocation request 134<br>
to the RM 110. The RM 110 and the CP 108 allocate resources as shown by 136. The RM 110<br>
sends a resource allocation response 138 to the RA 112. The RA 112 communicates a request for<br>
call setup 140 to the CP 108. The CP 108 communicates a response to the call setup 142. The RA<br>
112 communicates a request to radio link setup 144 to the CP 108. The CP 108 and the BTS 104<br>
allocate channel resources as shown by 146. The CP 108 generates a response to radio link setup<br>
148. A channel assignment process 150 is performed between the CP 108 and the MS 100. The<br>
CP 108 communicates with the Packet Control Function (PCF) 114 to allocate PCF resources for<br>
packet data session 152. The PCF 114 communicates a response to allocate PCF resources for<br>
packet data session 154 with the CP 108.<br>
Fig. IB displays a continuation of the conventional message process flow diagram shown<br>
in Fig. 1A. In Fig. IB, the CP 108 communicates with the PCF 114 to request connect PCF<br>
resources for packet data session 156. The PCF 114 communicates with the Packet Data Service<br>
Node (PDSN) 118 to setup/connect an A10 interface 158. The PCF 114 communicates with the<br>
CP 108 to connect PCF resources for packet data session 160. The RA 112 sends a Service<br>
Connect (SC) request 162 to the CP 108. The CP 108 and the MS 100 perform a service<br>
connection/negotiation process 164. The CP 108 sends a service connection response 166 to the<br>
RA 112. The RA 112 sends a Sat present message 168 to the MSC 120 and, as a result of the<br>
foregoing, data 170 may be communicated between the MS 100 and the PDSN 118.<br>
It is clear from the foregoing process flow diagram that a number of steps must be<br>
accomplished to setup a call in a packet-based network. The various steps require time to setup the<br>
call. In addition, many of the steps are required before other steps can be accomplished. The<br>
foregoing process results in more cost for the operating network, dissatisfied customers because of<br>
the user delay, and ultimately, may even limit the types of applications that can be implemented in<br>
the network.<br>
Thus, there is a need for reducing the time for call setup in a packet-switched network. In<br>
addition, there is a need for methods that facilitate the efficient operation of packet-switched<br>
networks.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
A method and apparatus is presented that decreases the call setup time for packet-based<br>
applications, such as Push-To-Talk (PTT), Voice-over-IP (VoIP), etc. In one embodiment, the call<br>
setup time is decreased by enhancing the interface between an MS and BSS.<br>
In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, the call setup time in a packet<br>
network is decreased by performing contemporaneous process execution within a BSS for delaysensitive<br>
packet-based applications, such as PTT and VoIP. In one embodiment, call origination<br>
is processed at the same time as the resource allocation in the BSS. In a first embodiment, call<br>
origination is processed during user authentication. In a second embodiment, radio link resources<br>
and packet resources are allocated at the same time. In a third embodiment, a service connection<br>
and/or service negotiation process are performed directly after a channel assignment process. In a<br>
fourth embodiment, service connection and/or service negotiation processes are eliminated after a<br>
channel assignment process.<br>
In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, multiple steps are combined into<br>
a single step within the BSS as a part of a call setup process for allocating a traffic channel to the<br>
MS. In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, packet-based applications are<br>
identified and/or remembered and, as such, receive special treatment in the wireless access<br>
network so that the MS allocates a traffic channel at the earliest possible time. In an example a<br>
unique service option is assigned to a delay-sensitive packet-based applications (such as PTT or<br>
VoIP). This service option may be included by the MS in the origination message so that the<br>
network may provide a fast call setup service for this specific delay-sensitive packet-based<br>
applications (such as PTT or VoIP).<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE INVENTION<br>
While the present invention is described herein with reference to illustrative embodiments<br>
for particular applications, it should be understood that the invention is not limited thereto. Those<br>
having ordinary skill in the art and access to the teachings provided herein will recognize<br>
additional modifications, applications, and embodiments within the scope thereof and additional<br>
fields in which the present invention would be of significant utility.<br>
Fig. 2 displays a message process flow diagram detailing the method and apparatus of the<br>
present invention, hi one embodiment, the method and apparatus presented may be implemented<br>
to establish a packet data call communication circuit for specific delay-sensitive applications, such<br>
as PTT, VoIP, etc. In one embodiment, delay-sensitive applications include applications that<br>
require end-to-end communication within a certain time to properly operate the application. In<br>
accordance with the teachings of the present invention, the call setup time in a packet network is<br>
decreased by performing contemporaneous process execution within a BSS for delay-sensitive<br>
packet-based applications, such as PTT and VoIP. In one embodiment, contemporaneous process<br>
steps include those process steps that are performed simultaneously, relatively simultaneously<br>
when compared with the time on other process steps and/or within the same time period when<br>
compared with the time period of other steps.<br>
In Fig. 2, a Mobile Station (MS) 200 is shown. The MS 200 is in communication with a<br>
Base Station Subsystem (BSS) 202. The BSS 202 includes a Base Transceiver Station (BTS) 204<br>
that is in communication with a Base Station Controller (BSC) 206. The BSC 206 also includes a<br>
Call Processor (CP) 208, a Resource Manager (RM) 210, and a Routing Agent (RA) 212. The RA<br>
212 is in communication with an MSC 220 and a Packet Control Function (PCF) 214. The BSC<br>
206 communicates with a Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 220 and a PCF 214. The PCF 214 is<br>
in communication with an IP network 216. An Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting<br>
(AAA) server 222 may be accessed through the IP network 216. A PDSN 218 is also in<br>
communication with the IP Network 216. It should be appreciated that, in alternate embodiments,<br>
the Packet Control Function (PCF) 214 and the PDSN 218 may each function as part of the BSS<br>
202.<br>
In one embodiment, the RM 210 is primarily responsible for allocating resources, such as<br>
selecting the appropriate CP 208, memory resources, etc., within the BSC 206. In one<br>
embodiment, the RA 212 is a functional entity within the BSC 206 that is responsible for routing<br>
messages within the BSS 202.<br>
In one embodiment of the present invention, messages are sent from the MS 200 to the<br>
PSDN 218 to establish a communication path for data transmission. The messages and<br>
architectures discussed in the instant application are defined in various wireless standards. Among<br>
these standards are 3GPP2 Access Network Interfaces Interoperability Specification, A.S0002-A<br>
Version 2.0, 3GPP2, http://www.3gpp2.Org/PublicJitrru7specs/A.S0002-A v2.0.pdf. June 2002<br>
and Interoperability Specification (IOS) for cdma2000 Access Network Interfaces Part 7—A20<br>
and A22 Interfaces, 3G-IOSv4.3, 3GPP2 A.S0027-A, Version 2.0.2,<br>
http://www.3gpp2.org/Public_html/specs/A.S0027-A_v2.0.2_222903.pd£. July 2003, which are<br>
both incorporated by reference.<br>
The MS 200 sends a call setup initiation message 224, such as an origination message, a<br>
page response message, a reconnect message, etc., to the BTS 204. The BTS 204 forwards the call<br>
setup initiation message 226 to the RA 212. The BTS 204 sends a base station acknowledgement<br>
message (BS Ack) 234 to the MS 200 indicating that the call setup initiation message 224 has been<br>
received.<br>
Upon receiving the call setup initiation message 226, the RA 212 identifies the call as a<br>
packet data call for a specific packet-based application, such as PTT application, VoIP application,<br>
push-to-media, instant messaging, etc., that requires special treatment. In accordance with the<br>
teachings of the present invention, the RA 212 performs the following two tasks:<br>
a) The RA 212 forwards the call setup origination message 228 to the MSC 220 for<br>
further processing, such as authentication shown as 229, retrieval of user's profile<br>
etc.;<br>
b) The RA 212 communicates a resource allocation request 230 to request that the<br>
RM 210 allocates all of the resources needed within the BSC 206 to complete the<br>
call setup process; the RM 210 communicates with the CP 208 to allocate<br>
resources 232; the RM 210 communicates a resource allocation response 236 to<br>
the RA 212.<br>
The RM 210 allocates the appropriate CP 208 resources and communicates an allocate<br>
resource message 232 to inform the selected CP 208 module that it has been selected for<br>
processing this particular call setup message for the packet-based applications (i.e., such as PTT<br>
and VoIP). The MSC 220 replies to the origination message 228 with a setup conversation<br>
message 238 that may include the MS's 200 profile, such as Supplemental Channel (SCH)<br>
capability, Short Data Burst (SDB), supported bit, etc. RM 210 communicates a resource<br>
allocation response 236 to inform the RA 212 that the appropriate CP 208 module and the other<br>
necessary resources within the BSC 206 have been allocated. In one embodiment, the RM 210<br>
provides the identity, such as an IP (Internet Protocol) address of the CP 208 module to the RA<br>
212. In another embodiment, the RM 210 also provides the software record number of a CP 208<br>
element to the RA 212.<br>
The RA 212 identifies the call as a packet data call for specific packet-based applications<br>
(such as PTT and VoIP). It, therefore, combines the functions of call setup and radio link setup<br>
into a single message before forwarding it to the CP 208. Using a combined message (i.e.,<br>
combined request for call and radio link setup 240), the CP 208 performs all the necessary tasks<br>
needed to setup the call as well as setup the radio link between the MS 200 and the BSS 202. In<br>
this way, the messages between the RA 212 and the CP 208 are minimized to a single message as<br>
opposed to multiple messages. In one embodiment, the combined message may include parameters,<br>
such as the Quality of Service (QoS) priority, the SDB bit, etc. Upon receiving the combined<br>
request for call and radio link setup 240, the CP 208 may perform the following two functions<br>
(among other things):<br>
a) Using an allocate channel resources message 242, the CP 208 requests the BTS<br>
204 to allocate the radio link related resources. Radio link related resources<br>
include the resources necessary to establish, operate, and terminate a radio link. In<br>
a first embodiment, the radio related resources may include a Channel Element<br>
(CE), Fundamental Channel (FCH), a FCH Walsh Code, a radio frequency<br>
channel, a packet scheduler, a frame processor, a code (such as long code mask,<br>
Walsh code etc.) generator, a code (such as long code mask, Walsh code etc.)<br>
distributor, radio frequency transmitter, and radio frequency receiver, hi addition,<br>
the radio link-related resources may include, but are not limited to, the following:<br>
hardware and software entities within the BTS 204, BSC 206, and PCF 214 that<br>
process a packet-based session; software manager (such as PCF manager) to<br>
manage such resources; software binding cache to create and maintain corelationship<br>
(also known as software 'binding') between the user's radio-related<br>
address, such as International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI), Mobile<br>
Identification Number (MIN), Mobile Equipment ID (MEID), etc.; the user's<br>
packet-related address, such as IP address, Network Access Identifier (NAI),<br>
Ethernet address, etc.; software session manager to create and maintain the packet<br>
session ID, packet session state, R-P session information, etc.; and mobility<br>
manager to maintain the mobility information in the packet domain. The CP 208<br>
may also send null frames on the forward FCH as a part of allocating radio link<br>
related resources;<br>
b) The CP 208 sends a message (i.e., allocate and connect PCF resources for packet<br>
data session message 244) to the PCF 214 to request that the PCF 214 allocate<br>
appropriate resources (i.e., packet resources) to setup this packet data call for<br>
specific packet-based applications (such as PTT and VoIP). Packet resources<br>
include the resources necessary to establish, operate, and terminate a packet link.<br>
In one embodiment, the packet resources include hardware and software entities<br>
within the BSC 206 and PCF 214 to process a packet-based session; software<br>
manager (such as PCF manager) to manage such resources; software binding cache<br>
to create and maintain co-relationship (also known as software 'binding') between<br>
the user's radio-related address, such as International Mobile Subscriber Identity<br>
(IMSI), Mobile Identification Number (MIN), Mobile Equipment ID (MEID), etc.;<br>
the user's packet-related address, such as IP address, Network Access Identifier<br>
(NAI), Ethernet address, etc.; software session manager to create and maintain the<br>
packet session ID, packet session state, R-P session information, etc.; and mobility<br>
manager to maintain the mobility information in the packet domain. In one<br>
embodiment, the allocated and connected PCF resources for packet data session<br>
message 244 may include the transition identification (i.e., to indicate whether the<br>
MS 200 is transitioning from Null to Active or Dormant to Active, and/or the<br>
MS's 200 International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI)).<br>
The PCF 214 allocates the appropriate resources necessary to setup the packet data call for<br>
specific packet-based applications (such as PTT and VoIP). The PCF 214 resources may include a<br>
block of Read Only Memory, a packet session identification (SID), a Port identification (PID), etc.<br>
The PCF 214 may then send an All-Resigtration Request message to the PDSN 218 to set up (or<br>
re-connect) an A10 interface as shown by 246 to serve specific packet-based applications (such as<br>
PTT and VoIP). The PCF 214 may also create a proprietary A10 interface between the PCF 214<br>
and the PDSN 218.<br>
The PCF 214 communicates allocate and connect PCF resources for packet data session<br>
message 248 to the CP 208 to inform the CP 208 that the appropriate resources as well as the A10<br>
interface have been allocated (or connected) to setup this packet data for specific packet-based<br>
applications (such as PTT and VoIP). The CP 208 communicates with the MS 200, shown with<br>
the channel assignment process 250 to complete the channel assignment process between the MS<br>
200 and the BSS 202. In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, in one<br>
embodiment, the channel assignment process 250 may continue simultaneously while the steps of<br>
allocate and connect PCF resources for packet data session 244, setup/connect A10 interface 246,<br>
and allocate and connect PCF resources for packet data session 248 are being performed. In one<br>
embodiment, the channel assignment process 250 may include the CP 208 sending Extended<br>
Channel Assignment Message (ECAM) to MS 200 on a paging channel, the assigned CE acquiring<br>
reverse FCH, the BTS receiving traffic channel preamble from the MS 200, the CP 208 receiving<br>
null traffic data from the MS 200, the CP 208 sending BS Ack message 234 to the MS 200, the MS<br>
200 sending MS Acknowledgement (MS Ack) 234 message to the CP 208, the CP 208 sending<br>
Status Request message to the MS 200 and the MS 200 sending Status Response message to the<br>
CP 208, etc.<br>
The CP 208 communicates a response to call and radio link setup 252 to inform the RA<br>
212 that the channel has been successfully setup for this packet data call for serving specific<br>
applications (such as PTT and VoIP). The RA 212 communicates a Service Connection (SC)<br>
request 254 to request that the CP 208 sends a service connect message to the MS 200. In one<br>
embodiment, the SC request 254 includes the user's zone ID, the user's network ID, and other<br>
location-related information.<br>
The CP 208 completes the service connect process as shown by 256. hi one embodiment,<br>
completing the service connection process 256 includes sending a service connect message to the<br>
MS 200 and then receiving a service connect complete message from the MS 200. The service<br>
connect message informs the MS 200 that the call has been setup to serve specific applications<br>
(such as PTT and VoIP). In one embodiment, parameters, such as the multiplexing option, coding<br>
type, interleaving type, and allowed radio configuration, etc., may be included in the service<br>
connect message.<br>
As shown by the SC response 258, the CP 208 informs the RA 212 that the MS 200 has<br>
been granted access to the BSS 202 to serve specific packet-based applications (such as PTT and<br>
VoIP). In one embodiment, the CP 208 informs the RA 212 about MS's 200 SCH capabilities,<br>
SDB supported bit, the PCF 214 address, etc. In another embodiment, the SC request 254, the<br>
service connect process 256, and SC response 258 can all be omitted to reduce the call setup time.<br>
This is done based on the network's knowledge that the user is currently in the process of<br>
launching specific packet-based applications (such as PTT and VoIP).<br>
The RA 212 sends a Sat present message 260 to the MSC 220 informing the MSC 220 that<br>
the MS 200 has been allowed in the network, that is, a traffic channel has been allocated to the MS<br>
200. In one embodiment, the Sat present message 260 may also inform the MSC 220 of the MS<br>
200 SCH capabilities, SDB supported bits, etc.<br>
The MS 200 may now launch the specific packet-based applications illustrated by the data<br>
262. The MS 200 may also establish Radio Link Protocol (RLP) and Point-To-Point (PPP)<br>
sessions (not shown in the figure) before launching the specific packet-based applications.<br>
Fig. 3 displays a computer architecture implementing the teachings of the present<br>
invention. The computer 300 may be used to implement the MS 200, the BSC 206, the CP 208,<br>

memory 304 is shown. The internal memory 304 includes short-term memory 306 and long-term<br>
memory 308. The short-term memory 306 may be a Random Access Memory (RAM) or a memory<br>
cache used for staging information. The long-term memory 308 may be a Read Only Memory<br>
(ROM) or an alternative form of memory used for storing information. Storage memory 320 may<br>
be any memory residing within the computer 300 other than internal memory 304. In one<br>
embodiment of the present invention, storage memory 320 is implemented with a hard drive. A<br>
communication pathway 310 is used to communicate information within computer 300. In<br>
addition, the communication pathway 310 may be connected to interfaces, which communicate<br>
information out of the computer 300 or receive information into the computer 300.<br>
Input devices, such as tactile input device, joystick, keyboards, microphone,<br>
communications connections, or a mouse, are shown as 312. The input devices 312 interface with<br>
computer 300 through an input interface 314. Output devices, such as a monitor, speakers,<br>
communications connections, etc., are shown as 316. The output devices 316 communicate with<br>
computer 300 through an output interface 318.<br>
