CYLINDRICAL ULTRASOUND RECEIVERS AND TRANSCEIVERS FORMED FROM PIEZOELECTRIC FILM<br><br>
The present invention relates to ultrasound transducers and, in particular, it concerns cylindrical ultrasound receivers and transceivers formed from piezoelectric Films, and their applications in digitizer systems.<br>
It is known to employ cylindrical ultrasound transducers for transmitting ultrasound signals in digitizer systems. I he cylindrical form provides all-around signal transmission and simplifies the geometry of iime-of-flight calculations by providing an effect similar to a point for more accurately, line) source. These advantages are detailed in U.S. Patent No. <i to de bruyne. a further advantage of cylindrical ultrasound transducers is that they can be centered around an clement which the position measured. this used in drawing implement digitizer system described pct publication wo98ai0838.></i>
Structurally, a number of different types of cylindrical transducer have been proposed. 'Die De Bruyne patent proposes a "Sell transducer"' which is .-apaeitive device formed from a complicated arrangement of cylindrical layers nlended to produce a cylindrical air gap of about 20 pm. Such a structure is :ost]y to manufacture, and is likely to be unreliable.<br>
A second type of transducer which has been proposed in the field of nedica) applications is based on piezoelectric elements. An example of a nedical transducer of this type may be found in U.S. Patent No. 4,706,681 to 3reyer et al. which discloses an ultrasonic marker. Here, a cylindrical &gt;iezoeIec!ric collar is sandwiched between two electrodes. Application of an iltemafmg potential across the electrodes causes vibration of the collar, and icnce emits a radially propagating ultrasonic signal.<br><br>
In principle, any ultrasonic transducer is capable of being operated both is a transmitter anil a receiver. In practice, however, many considerations result in many transmitter structures being ineffective as receivers. This is lartieularly true of cylindrical elements in which almost the entire cylinder ;ontribuk'S to wide angle transmission by actuation with a relatively hi»h po\ver while only a small portion of the cylinder is correctly orientated for receiving an incoming signal from a given direction. Furthermore, the inherent capacitance of the large inactive region of the transducer may absorb a !;irec proportion of the amplitude of a received signal, rendering the transducer insensitive as a receiver.<br>
In the field of transducers in general, much woik has been invested in development of devices based on piezoelectric films, such as PVDF. Conductive electrodes are formed on opposite faces of the film, typically by selectively printing conductive ink on regions of the surfaces. These films are cheap to produce, and withstand a wide range of operating conditions including exposure to moisture.<br>
Although a cylindrical ultrasound transducer is relatively simple to implement using piezoelectric film, implementation oi a receiver poses additional problems beyond the general complications of cylindrical receivers discussed above. Specifically, referring to Figures 1 and 2, there is shown a schematic plan view of a freely suspended cylinder 10 formed from piezoelectric film. Figure ! shows its relaxed state, while Figure 2 shows the response of cylinder 10 to an incoming ultrasound signal wave front 12. Since the piezoelectric film is flexible, the oscillations of signal 12 generate waves (exaggerated for clarity) traveling around cylinder 10, "fire direction and extent of flexing of the piezoelectric film varies along the wave form created around the cylinder, resulting in reversal of the sense of an electrical potential generated between the electrodes. As a result, much of the potential generated by the piezoelectric film may be dissipated in local eddy currents within the electrodes, greatly reducing the overall signal voltage as measured between the electrodes.<br><br>
A further problem of implementing a cylindrical ultrasound transducer using piezoelectric film is the tendency for the electrode !o act as an antenna picking up unwanted electromagnetic radiation which may result in very low signal to noise ratios.<br>
There is therefore a need lor a cylindrical ultrasound receiver structure employing piezoelectric film.<br>

DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
The present invention is a cylindrical ultrasound receiver or transceiver formed from piezoelectric films. The invention also provides implications of such transceivers in digitizer systems.<br>
The principles and operation of receivers and transceivers according to the present invention may he better understood with relercnce to the drawings and the accompanying description.<br>
Referring now to the drawings, Figures 3-11 illustrate various aspects of an ultrasound receiver, generally designated 20, and its associated assembly, constructed and operative according to the teachings of the present invention.<br>
Generally speaking, receiver 20 includes a hollow cylinder 22, formed primarily from llexible piezoelectric film, having an outer surface 24, an inner surface 26, a central axis 28 and a height h measured parallel to axis 28. Applied to inner surface 26 is a sensing electrode 30 formed from conductive material. A grounded electrode 32 is formed from conductive material applied to the outer surface 24. Cylinder 22 is supported by a support structure, represented here by a core element 34, configured to support the hollow cylinder in such a manner as to allow propagation of vibration waves circumfercntially around a major part of cylinder 22.<br>
It is a particular feature of most preferred implementations of the present invention that sensing electrode 30 is formed as a strip extending in an extensional direction substantially parallel to central axis 28 along a major part of height h and subtending at central axis 28 an angle a of not more than 90° (see Figure 4C). The dimension of strip 30 is preferably chosen such that it<br><br>
corresponds lo less than about 'A wavelength of the vibrations in cylinder 22 induced by ultrasound vibrations of the intended working frequency. In most cases, the dimensions are chosen such that cylinder 22 supports only about ! wavelength of the vibrations (rather than the about three wavelengths illustrated schematically in Figure 2) so as lo minimize interference effects and the like. As a result, phase canceling problems can largely be avoided so long as strip 30 subtends an angle u of less than about 90° at axis 28. Preferably, however, the width of strip 30 is typically chosen to subtend an angle u of between about 20 and about 30° at axis 28.<br>
The principle of operation of receiver 20 may be appreciated by referring back to Figures I and 2. As described above, incident pressure waves lend to induce vibration waves which propagate around the periphery of the cylinder. As a result, an arbitrarily positioned localized sensor on the surface of the cylinder experiences substantially the same vibrations substantially independent of the direction from which the pressure waves are incident. At the same lime, since the circumferential extent of sensing electrode 30 is small relative to the wavelength of ihe vibrations propagating through the film, the aforementioned problems of phase canceling and large capacitance are avoided. The result is a highly effective, wide angle ultrasound receiver. These and other advantages of the configuration of the present invention will become clearer from the following more detailed description.<br>
With regard io materials, it should be noted thai the present invention may be implemented using any piezoelectric film material and suitable conductive electrode material. A particularly preferred example for the film itself is PVDF. The direction of polarization should be oriented circumferentially around the cylinder. The use of such films provides particular advantages due lo its wide frequency-band response. Specifically, it has been found that conventional narrow frequency-band receivers based on piezo-ceramics tend to shift signal noise into the frequency range of measurement, drastically reducing the signal-to-noise ratio. In contrast, the<br><br>
wide frequency-band receivers oi' the present invention, used in combination v-";!h ibsequcnt filtering to identity the signal of interest, have been found lo pf\&gt;viue a greatly enhanced signal-to-noise ratio.<br>
Suitable conductive materials for the electrodes include, but are not limited to, compositions containing carbon, stiver and gold. In applications in which a transparent structure is required, a transparent conductive material is used.<br>
As mentioned earlier, one major problem associated with implementation of a cylindrical ultrasound transducer using piezoelectric film is the tendency of the electrodes to function as an antenna for electromagnetic (EM) radiation. To minimize or eliminate this problem, preferred implementations of the present invention include one or more features which help to shield sensing electrode 30 from EM radiation, as will now be detailed.<br>
Firstly, grounded electrode 32 preferably extends over a major part of outer surface 24 of the film. This forms a conductive shell around sensing electrode 30, thereby tending to exclude EM fields from the contained volume. 1 his, incidentally, is the reason it is preferred to position sensing electrode 30 on die inner surface of the film rather than externally thereto.<br>
Additional shielding is preferably offered by providing at least one additional grounded electrode 36 formed from conductive material applied to the 'nner surface in a pattern non-contiguous with the sensing electrode. Preferably, additional electrode 36 extends over a major pari of inner surface 26. Where two or more separate regions are required, they may advantageously be electrically connected by a bridge portion 38 of the conductive material, such as is shown in Figure AB.<br>
A further or alternative contribution to EM shielding is preferably provided by employing an electrically grounded conductive core element 34 disposed within cylinder 22 in such a manner as lo avoid electrical contact with sensing electrode 30. Core element 34 is typically, although not necessarily, part of the support structure for cylinder 22.<br><br>
Figure 5 shows one preferred implementation of core element 34 as a metal core element, which may be solid as shown or hollow. In order to ensure that the film of cylinder 22 is free to vibrate, core element 34 is here fonned with a reduced diameter portion 38 over a major part of its height, in certain cases, the non-contact regions delined by reduced diameter portion 34 may he sufficient to avoid electrical contact with sensing electrode 30. Alternatively, . an additional insulating layer may be interposed between core element 34 and sensing electrode 30.<br>
Figure 6.shows an alternative implementation of core element 34 formed from conductive foam, in this case, contact between core element 34 and cylinder 22 typically does not significantly interfere with propagation of vibrations within cylinder 22. In this case, an additional insulating layer is generally required between core element 34 and sensing electrode 30.<br>
In order lo make use of receiver 20, appropriate electrical connections must clearly be made between the various electrodes and the appropriate electrical components of the associated circuitry (to be addressed below). It is noted that a wide range of effective connection configurations are known in the art of piezoelectric device design. For completeness, however, brief reference will be made to a number of connection configurations which are believed to be particularly advantageous.<br>
Firstly, with reference to Figures 3, 4A and -IB, it is noted that a preferred form of cylinder 22 is configured such that a tab 40, carrying all the electrical contacts, projects therefrom. Three techniques for connecting these contacts to corresponding contacts of a PCB are illustrated in Figures 7A-7B, Figure 8 and Figure 9, respectively.<br>
According to the technique of Figures 7A and 7B, tab 40 is aligned with, and pressed against, the corresponding contacts 42 of the PCB which have been prepared by depositing a drop of a conductive glue 44 on each.<br>
According to the technique of Figure 8, tab 40 is forced between the &gt; PCB and one or more spring element 46. Electrical contacts are provided on one, or typically both, of the PCB and the spring.<br><br>
According to the technique of Figure 9, a number of conductive pins 18 are inserted through the contact portions of tab 40 and engage corresponding contact sockets on the PCR.<br>
Turning briclly to llgures I OA and 101!. there is shown an alternative configuration of the piezoelectric film in uhich contact tabs ■10» and -t0/» extend axially from cylinder 22 rather than tangenlialiy. In other respects, this configuration is fully analogous to that of Figures 3-4.<br>
Although device 20 has been described thus far as an ultrasound receiver, the same structure is highly suited for use in a transceiver system, i.e.. for both receiving and transmitting signals, as will now be described. Referring back to Figure 413, it will be noted thai additional clcctrode(s) 36 preferably cover a large proportion of surface 26 opposite grounded electrode 32. Thus, a driving potential applied between these two electrodes is highly effective to generate an ultrasound signal, similar to the operation of a conventional cylindrical ultrasound transmitter.<br>
As mentioned earlier, it is advantageous that both grounded electrode 32 and additional eleclrode(s) 36 are grounded for shielding purposes during reception of ultrasound signals. In order to maintain this advantage, a switching system may be \ised to selectively switch connection of one of the grounded electrodes to transmitter circuitry when transmission is required.<br>
Thus, referring to Figure 11, there is shown a representation of a transceiver assembly employing device 20. The transceiver assembly further includes a control module 50 having receiver circuitry 52 electrically connected to sensing electrode 30, typically via an amplifier 54. Control module 50 also includes transmitter circuitry 56, and a switching system 58. Switching system 58 is associated with either grounded electrode 32 or additional electrode 36 which serves as an actuating electrode, alternately connecting it to the transmitter circuitry for transmission and to ground during reception. The entire assembly is typically operated under control of a processor 60, details of which are not essential to the present invention.<br><br>
In operation, when the assembly is being used for reception, both :".'■!! !i; "-il electrode 36 and outer electrode 32 are connected to ground, thereby oilcii.ig the maximum available CM shielding. When transmission is required, a dri\ing voltage is applied to either grounded electrode 32 or additional electrode 36 lo generate the desired signal<br>
It should be noted at this point that many variations and refinements may be made within the scope of the principles of the present invention. By way of example, it should be noted thai receiver 20 may employ more than one sensing electrode 30 spaced around cylinder 22. This may be useful for a number of reasons, firstly, by analyzing the delected signals separately and identifying phase differences between the signals, it is possible to derive approximate direction information from measurements at a single receiver. Alternatively, in an example in which the wavelength is short compared to the size of cylinder 22, it may be possible lo choose the spacing of a number of commonly connected sensing electrodes to achieve inherent tuning of the receiver to frequencies of interest. In other words, if the spacing corresponds to in-phase spacing around cylinder for a given frequency, the signals from each .-.cnsing electrode will have the same sign and will add up to an increased amplitude. At many other frequencies, some degree of cancellation will occur as was describeil in the context of Figure 2 above.<br>
As mentioned earlier, cylinder 22 is preferably configured so that is supports only about a single wavelength of the vibration waves within the piezoelectric film induced by ultrasound signals at the working frequency. More specifically, half of the circumference (nD/2) is preferably equal to the wavelength of the vibration waves within the film. For this reason, the diameter of the cylinder is generally chosen to be inversely proportional to the intended working frequency. By way of example, for a working frequency of 90 kHz, a cylinder of diameter about 5 mm is generally preferred.<br>
Turning now to Figures 12A-I3B, it should be noted that the transceiver functionality of the transducers of the present invention are particularly useful for implementing a self-calibration mode according to another aspect of the<br><br>
present invention which offers increased precision and reliability in a system tor determining the position of a movable element.<br>
By way of introduction, it should be noted that ultrasound time-of-flight based digitizer systems suffer from problems of accuracy due to significant variations in the speed of sound through air which result from changes in temperature, pressure or humidity. In order lo compensate for such variations, Ihe present aspect of lite present invention provides a self-calibration facility which will now be described-Turning first to Figure 12A. there is shown schematically a system for determining (he position of a movable clement, including a movable ultrasound transducer 70 associated with a movable element 72 and at least two ultrasound transducers 74, 76 maintained in fixed geometrical relation by attachment to a base unit 78. in ihe ease illustrated here, the normal measurement mode ot* the system includes transmitting at least one measurement signal from movable ultrasound transducer 70 which is received by fixed ultrasound transducers 74 and 76. A position of movable clement 72 is then derived using time-of-flight measurements for the ultrasound measurement signal.<br>
According to the teachings of the present invention, the system is also iniermittenlly operated in a calibration mode in which transducer 7-4 switches from its normal receiving function to transmitting, sending out a calibration signal which is received by transducer 76. Since the distance between transducers 7-1 and 76 is a fixed value defined by ihe structure of base unit 78, time-of-flight measurements for the calibration signal can be used to derive calibration information indicative of variations in Ihe speed of sound in Ihe environment within which the system is currently operating. This calibration information is then used to correct the derivation of the position of movable element 72.<br>
Referring briefly to Figures 13A and 13B, these illustrate an implementation of this aspect of the present invention for a system where movable transducer 70 functions as a receiver for receiving signals transmitted by  fixed  transducers  74 and  76.  In this  case,  the  calibration  mode  is<br><br>
implemented by momentarily employing transducer 76 ns a receiver to receive a salibralion signal transmitted by transducer 74. In all other respects, the principles of the invention remain as before.<br>
1 uriiing now to Figure I1'- theie is shown a protective grilling, generally designated 80, constructed and operative according to Ihc teachings of a further aspect of (he present invention, for use to piovide mechanical protection for an ultrasound transducer-Mechanical protection must otten be pro\ ided for transducers, particularly those using piezoelectric films which arc easily damaged. Many existing transducer structures suffer from significant signal distortion and/or "blind spots" (i.e., directions in which transmitted intensity or sensitivity of reception are significantly impaired) due to the presence of various protective structures in front of the transducer.<br>
To minimize or eliminate such problems, the present invention provides a protective grating structure 80 in which a periodic pattern of openings has a spatial period S of no more than X/2, and preferably no more than AVI, where X is the wavelength of Ihc ultrasound working frequency in air. By using a grating with a grating step S significantly smaller than existing systems, little or no directional disruption is caused to the ultrasound signals. By way of a practical example, for a working frequency of 90 kHz, corresponding to a vasrlength in air of about 4 mm, a grating step of 1.9 mm has been found to offer minimal disruption to the transmission and reception of signals.<br>
To minimize attenuation of the signal, the proportion of the grating which is open is preferably maximized, subject to the mechanical requirements for the structure. In the aforementioned example, the open area of the grating is preferably at least about 70% of the total area within each grating step.<br>
Although shown here schematically in the form of a rectangular grating,<br>
grating 80 may clearly be implemented in a range of different forms to suit<br>
each particular application. Thus for a cylindrical transducer, such as those<br>
     described above, grating 80 is preferably implemented as a cylindrical outer<br>
sleeve having openings with periodic spacing.?.<br><br>
Specifically lor transducers associated with the writing point of a writing implement, it should be noted that ail components of transducer 20 and grating 80 are preferably implemented ;is substantially transparent elements (using transparent condmlivc material for the electrodes and transparent plastics or (he like for grating 80) to the extent that the ultrasound transducer can be located very close to, and surround, the writing tip without obscuring the user's view of the tip.<br>
