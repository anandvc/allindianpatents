				<th>Full Text</th>
				<td>This invention relates to an improved device for the determination of water content in high boiling substances, particularly petroleum products.<br>
The Dean &amp; Stark apparatus is widely employed for determination of water content in variety of high boiling substances which has been adopted for determination of water by distillation in petroleum products. The material is heated under reflux with an organic liquid such as toluene, benzene, xylene, which is immiscible with water and has density less than one. The carrier liquid distills into a graduated receiver carrying with it the water, which then separates to form the lower layer. The excess carrier liquid overflows from the trap and returns to the still.<br>
While estimating water in oily substances such as lubricated fiber main core (Lubricated fiber main core is a lubricant impregnated fiber rope around which wire strands are stranded in the manufacture of Steel wire rope. The fiber main core acts as reservoir of lubricant for the rope in service) of steel wire ro9pe and other substances it has been observed that some water droplets gets adhered to the receiver wall or hangs in the carrier liquid instead of settling down to bottom of receiver. While working with 2 c.c. receiver it was observed that the carried over water got locked at the top of carrier liquid instead of settling down to the bottom of the receiver. This is due to capillarity of the receiver tube and surface tension of water droplets despite water being heavier than the carrier liquid. In this context the IS: 1448 (pt 1 ) 1960[P40] clause 6.5 states. If any droplets of water are adhering to the sides of the receiver, dislodge them with a fine wire . Such method is cumbersome and difficult and may involve dismantling the instrument (Dean and Stark assembly), which may lead to breakage of glass apparatus. Moreover, with 2 c.c receiver since water gets locked at the head of the receiver tube, dismantling and use of wire may lead to spillage of water. The use of wire through the long condenser tube without dismantling the instrument is also difficult and cumbersome due to height of instrument particularly for short persons.<br>
The graduation on the wall of receiver tube indicates the amount of water present in substances under experiment. It is also necessary to have a better viewing of the water meniscus and the graducaiton to improve the accuracy and the efficiency of the experiment.<br>
Therefore, there is need for improvement to eliminate the drawbacks of the Dean and Stark apparatus for determination of water contents by incorporating innovations in the device.<br><br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide an improved device for the determination of water content in high boiling substances, particularly petroleum products, which obviates the drawbacks as detailed above.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a device, which is suitable for forcing down the water droplets locked at the top or adhering to the wall of the receiver tube, to the water accumulation in the bottom of receiver.<br>
Still another object of the present invention is to provide an improved device for pulling down water droplets to the bottom by performing an no cumbersome, simple operation, which is not injurious to the walls of the glass receiver.<br>
Yet another object of the present invention is to provide an improved device for improved reading of the graduatiorv mark on the wall of the receiver to determine the amount of water with accuracy.<br>
The device of the present invention is illustrated in Figures -1 and 2 of the drawings accomOpanying this specification.<br>
Figure -1 and 2 shows the schematic diagram of the improved device of the present invention as herein described in the specification. In Fig -1; it is an assembly of Dean and Stark apparatus having innovative improvement (7) in the receiver portion in the form of a magnetic ball covered with flexible bristles. A sliding magnet (10) has been slidingly fixed with the stand (4) near to the receiver glass tube (3) and a watch glass/magnifying glass (14) of suitable size is also siliding fixed externally onto the body of the receiver tube.<br>
In Fig -2, the schematic diagram of a magnetic ball/spindle is shown, which has been covered with flexible bristles such as PVC / rubber thin sheet having thin flexible flanges.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an An improved device for the determination of water content in high boiling substances, particularly petroleum products which comprises a conventional Dean and Stark apparatus essentially consisting of a distillation flask (1) being connected to condenser (2), characterized in that the said flask (1) being also connected to a receiver tube(3), the said condenser is being fixed by clamps (5,15) to a stand (4), the said distillation flask being seated over a heater/oven (6), the said receiver tube (3) being provided with an internal movable magnetic ball (7) covered with flexible bristles (8,9) and an external magnet (10) slidingly fixed to the said stand(4) by a rod (11) and a lockable bush (12,13), the said receiver tube being also provided with an external<br><br>
slidingly fixed watch and magnifying glass(14) having a dark line in the middle of it.<br>
In the receiver tube (3) of Dean and Stark apparatus, the present invention provides an iron ball (7) of lesser diameter than the receiver tube. The iron ball is covered with thin sheet of PVC of Rubber (8) having soft bristies/ flanges (9) of considerable size and numbers, which will be a permanent part of the device. A strong magnet (10) is fixed with the stand by sliding arrangement, which can be locked in any position by the help of a key. During experiment the ball is moved up and down from outside of the receiver tube by moving the said magnet after unlocking the key. This is done intermittently to dislodge, break and<br>
Force down the water droplets from top or middle of carrier liquid or from the wall of receiver tube.<br>
The volume of the water content in the receiver bottom can be read after raising the ball (capsule) above the water level by the magnet. Then the magnet will be fixed at a required position and reading can be easily taken with the help of the watch glass (14) provided in the device which is a magnifying glass assembled with the receiver body to facilitate the reading of graduation on the wall and also the black line in the middle of watch glass helps to determine the meniscus level of water column properly.<br>
Main advantages of the present invention:<br>
1)	This device  can  easily force down the water droplets  locked  on top or<br>
adhered to the walls of receiver tube without disturbing the assembly.<br>
2)	This will not harm to the glass structure as the ball is cover3d with soft<br>
rubber /PVC.<br>
3)	The flexible flanges/bristies of the ball all around its outer body would help<br>
to bring down the sticking water droplets all around the tube surface.<br>
4)	It helps for better visualization and demarcation of the water level in receiver<br>
tube leading to a ore accurate data.<br>
5)	It increases the efficiency of the apparatus by quick and better accumulation<br>
and by better reading with perfect demarcation.<br>
6)	It is cheap and easily operable<br>
7)	No special maintenance is required and can be made with easily available<br>
raw material.<br>
8)	With the help of this device, narrower receiver tyube can be utilized for a<br>
longer graduation span over the calibrated receiver wall.<br><br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1.	An  improved device for the determination  of water content in  high boiling<br>
substances, particularly petroleum products which comprises a conventional Dean<br>
and  Stark  apparatus  essentially  consisting   of  a   distillation   flask  (1)   being<br>
