				<td>Method for producing metal conductors on a substrate<br>
Field of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to a method for producing metal conductors, for<br>
instance copper conductor patterns as electronic components on a substrate, such as<br>
paper. Said method is particularly suitable for producing metal conductors on paper<br>
for large scale mass production using printing or like machines.<br>
Prior art<br>
In microelectronic industry, semiconducting devices that are increasingly smaller in<br>
size and faster, are continuously developed. Metals, typically aluminium but also<br>
more recently, due to low resistances thereof, increasingly higher amounts of copper<br>
and minor amounts of silver are used for the production of integrated circuits and<br>
microchips. Copper is also endowed with other desirable properties, including high<br>
thermal stability and low price. Production of copper films and patterns on various<br>
substrates is, however, often accompanied with problems, and the methods used are<br>
complicated. At present, mainly UV photolithographic methods are used for<br>
producing copper film patterns at scales below 200 µm.<br>
Direct printing of a copper pattern on a substrate using an ink-jet printing method has<br>
recently been studied intensively due to the following advantages:<br>
• the method may be carried out with a simple, inexpensive device that may be<br>
controlled readily,<br>
• said printing method is safe and has no drawbacks,<br>
• printing is carried out directly without etching or complicated surface treatments,<br>
• only low amounts of reagents are needed for printing, and the energy<br>
consumption thereof being low.<br>
The patent US 5 132 248 discloses the use of a colloidal copper suspension for ink-jet<br>
printing method, followed by treatment at elevated temperature or laser treatment,<br>
and removal of excessive material.<br>
The use of various copper precursors including organic copper compounds is<br>
proposed for ink-jet printing method. After printing, however, heating at elevated<br>
temperatures must be carried out, the organic moiety of the compound being thus<br>
evaporated in the environment. Examples include copper hexenoate described in<br>
Hong, C.M., Wagner, S., IEEE Electron Device Lett. 2000, 21, 384.<br>
Metal films may be produced on substrates with the so-called electroless deposition<br>
method. Electroless deposition is defined as the controlled autocatalytic formation of<br>
a continuous film on a catalytic boundary due to a reaction of a metal salt with a<br>
reducing chemical, in a solution. The reaction is normally carried out at the<br>
temperature of 30 - 80 °C, and no external power source is required for the reaction.<br>
The metal ion and reducing agent are present in the same solution, and, they react at<br>
the catalytic boundary, or seed surface, typically comprising palladium or tin.<br>
Suitable metals for said electroless deposition are nickel, copper, gold, palladium and<br>
silver. In this method, the metal uniformly covers the surface to be treated and also<br>
penetrates into cavities and pores, but, however, the method is slow. Complexing<br>
agents are used for stabilizing the solution, but said agents also decrease the rate of<br>
the reaction.<br>
The patent US 5 158 604 describes a viscous aqueous solution suitable for electroless<br>
deposition, comprising metal ions e.g. copper or nickel, metal complexing agents e.g.<br>
EDTA, metal reducing agent e.g. formaldehyde or hypophosphite, and thickening<br>
agent e.g. xanthan gum, silica, or carboxymethylcellulose. The solution is applied on<br>
a heated catalytic substrate comprising metal or polymer, said substrate being<br>
stationary or in form of a moving web, the solution being also preferably preheated<br>
before application thereof.<br>
Document WO 00/33625 discloses a method for forming a conductive layer on a<br>
polymer substrate wherein ink containing catalytic particulate silver, copper, etc. is<br>
printed on a substrate with a lithographic printing method, followed by the immersion<br>
of said substrate into a conventional bath for electroless deposition, for providing a<br>
conductive layer.<br>
Electroless deposition is a known solution phase method for depositing metal films<br>
on catalytic surfaces. As a process, said electroless deposition is too slow, and thus<br>
unsuitable for large scale mass production. The reason for this is the fact that<br>
increasing of concentrations of the starting compounds in the solution would cause<br>
instability of the solution and accodingly, homogeneous reactions would take place.<br>
Moreover, the initiation of the deposition of the metal on the substrate requires<br>
activation of the substrate surface, which is typically achieved with platinum. Known<br>
substractive lithographic processes of the prior art, wherein the desired pattern is<br>
etched, are not suitable for mass production. In addition, the methods of the prior art<br>
are often expensive, and produce high amounts of wastes.<br>
Accordingly, it is clear that there is an evident need for a method for producing metal<br>
conductors, particularly metal conductor patterns on substrates, which method is<br>
especially suitable for large scale mass production, and may be carried out with a<br>
printing machine or a similar apparatus at high speed. Moreover, the method should<br>
be simple, fast and inexpensive.<br>
Object of the invention<br>
The object of the invention is to provide a method for producing a metal conductor on<br>
a substrate,<br>
Another object of the invention is to provide a method for producing metal<br>
conductors, e.g. copper conductor patterns as electronic components on a substrate.<br>
Still another object of the invention is to provide a method particularly suitable for<br>
producing metal conductors on paper for large scale mass production using a printing<br>
machine or like apparatus.<br>
Characteristic features of the method of the invention are presented in the claims.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
Now it has been surprisingly found that the problems and disadvantages associated<br>
with the prior art solutions may be eliminated or at least substantially reduced by the<br>
method of the invention. In said method, electroless deposition is carried out in at<br>
least two steps. Metallic starting material and the reducing agent are incorporated in<br>
separate solutions, or one of them is present in gas or vapour form, said solutions or<br>
gasses or vapours being then successively sprayed or applied on the substrate to sites<br>
where a film is desired.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
In the method according to the invention, electroless deposition is carried out in at<br>
least two steps. In said electroless deposition, a solution is formed from at least one of<br>
the metallic starting material and reducing agent, or one of them is present as gas or<br>
vapour, and then they are succesively applied on a substrate. Thus, separate solutions<br>
are always made from the metallic starting material and reducing agent, or one of<br>
them is present as gas or vapour, said solutions or gases or vapours being<br>
successively sprayed or applied on the substrate to sites where a film is desired. As<br>
opposed to conventional electroless depositions, starting materials are incorporated in<br>
separate solutions or one of them is present as gas or vapour, and therefore the growth<br>
of the metal film may be accelerated by increasing the concentrations of the starting<br>
materials, without simultaneously causing undesirable homogeneous reactions. In the<br>
method according to the invention, at least one of the starting materials is present in a<br>
solution, which is sprayed on or the paper or other substrate to sites where a metal<br>
film is desired. Said solutions are preferably aqueous solutions, but they may,<br>
however, also comprise organic solvents such as alcohols.<br>
Metals suitable for the method are selected from the group consisting of Cr, Mn, Fe,<br>
Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag, Cd, In, Sn, Sb, Te, Re, Os, Ir, Pt, Au,<br>
Hg, Tl, Pb, Bi, and alloys thereof. Copper, silver, gold, chromium, iron, cobalt,<br>
nickel, palladium and platinum, and the alloys thereof are preferable. Particularly<br>
preferable are copper, silver and nickel, in which high conductivity combines with<br>
favourable price. The metal is introduced into the aqueous solution suitably as a salt,<br>
preferably as a sulphate or chloride. Said metal solution contains said metal salt in a<br>
concentration varying between 0.005 M and the concentration corresponding to a<br>
saturated solution, preferably from 0.1 to 0.5 M. Said metal solution is preferably an<br>
aqueous solution.<br>
Said metal solution also optionally contains one or more complexing compounds<br>
preferably selected from the group consisting of EDTA, citric acid, ethylenediamine.<br>
The relative amount of the complexing compound is at least stoichiometric with<br>
respect to the metal.<br>
The pH of the metal solution is adjusted if necessary, the suitable pH range<br>
depending on the metal used. EDTA complex of copper may be mentioned as an<br>
example, for which the lower pH limit is 6, the preferable range being from 12 to 13.<br>
Any suitable base, preferably sodium hydroxide, may be used for pH adjustment.<br>
Suitable reducing agents include alkali and alkaline earth metal borohydrides, e.g.<br>
NaBH4 and hypophosphites such as NaH2PO2, formaldehyde NCON,<br>
hydrazinhydrate N2H4, and aminoboranes R2NHBH3, where the group R may be an<br>
alkyl group, preferably a methyl, ethyl or a propyl group. The reducing agent is<br>
preferably used as an aqueous solution.<br>
Moreover in the solutions containing the metal and the reducing agent, surface active<br>
agents and agents controlling the surface tension may be used, if necessary,<br>
polyethylene glycol and sodium lauryl sulphate being mentioned as examples.<br>
The substrate is stationary, or it is a moving web, and futher, it may comprise paper,<br>
board, other fibrous material, polymeric material, or metal coated with a polymer. It<br>
is not necessary to catalytically activate the substrate before application.<br>
The number of the starting material solutions, gasses and vapours may be more than<br>
one.<br>
In the first step, one of the solutions of the starting materials, that is, either the metal<br>
solution or the solution of the reducing agent, is introduced onto the substrate surface<br>
using a suitable application method, suitably with conventional printing methods such<br>
as gravure, flexo, offset, silk screen, or ink-jet printing method, and preferably with<br>
ink-jet printing method to the sites where a pattern is desirably formed, or optionally<br>
on the whole surface. In the second step, the other starting material, that is the metal<br>
or the reducing agent, is thereafter brought on the surface of the substrate in form of a<br>
solution using a suitable application method, suitably with conventional printing<br>
methods such as gravure, flexo, offset, silk screen, or ink-jet printing method, and<br>
preferably with ink-jet printing, thus either injected to form a pattern, or to cover the<br>
whole surface, or optionally vaporized or as a gas. It is particularly preferable to use a<br>
digitally controlled ink-jet printing method. The order of application of the starting<br>
materials is immaterial, and the application of the starting materials on the substrate<br>
may respectively be repeated several times.<br>
Application may be carried out on the substrate using a suitable roll-to-roll printing<br>
method or on sheets, and further, the substrate may comprise paper, board, other<br>
fibrous material, polymeric material, or metal coated with a polymer. A roll-to-roll<br>
printing method is preferably used.<br>
The application is performed at a temperature depending on the process. For instance<br>
in copper process, the temperature is from 20 to 200 °C, preferably from 20 to 140<br>
°C.<br>
The method of the invention has several advantages. The electroless deposition used<br>
to form the pattern may be carried out by applying either, or both of the starting<br>
components preferably in the form of respective solutions only to those sites where<br>
the metal deposition is desired. The reaction of method according to the invention is<br>
fast since no stabilizers are needed. With this method, an electrically conducting<br>
pattern having a desired form may be produced using an additive method on the<br>
substrate to the desired site, and the thickness of the pattern may vary over a wide<br>
range. The method may be performed at room temperature, at a normal atmosphere<br>
without any protective gasses. The solutions are aqueous and stable at room<br>
temperature, and moreover, the starting materials are inexpensive. No waste is<br>
produced in the method, as opposed to the etching methods of prior art.<br>
The invention is now illustrated by means of the following examples, without<br>
wishing to limit the scope thereof in any way.<br>
Examples<br>
Example 1<br>
Deposition of copper on paper<br>
In the example, a solution of copper sulphate complexed with ethylenediamine-<br>
tetraacetic acid (EDTA) (0.25 M CuSO4 x 5H20 + 0.25 M EDTA) was used as the<br>
starting copper material, and sodium borohydride (2,0 M NaBH4) acted as the<br>
reducing agent. The pH of the copper solution was adjusted to basic (pH 12 - 13)<br>
with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) before use. The copper starting material solution and<br>
the solution of the reducing agent were applied alternately on the paper at 140 °C in<br>
the air. The copper solution was allowed to spread on the paper for about 20 seconds,<br>
followed by the addition of the solution of the reducing agent. The paper was kept at<br>
140 °C for about 2 minutes. As a result, a conductive (about 4 - 20 ?) copper layer<br>
was obtained on a filter paper (Whatman) by respectively applying the two solutions<br>
three times, in amounts of 100 µl, respectively.<br>
The overall reaction:<br><br>
Example 2<br>
Deposition of silver on paper<br>
In this example, a solution of silver nitrate complexed with ammonia (NH3) was used<br>
as the silver starting material (0.04 M AgNO3 + 0.01 NH3), sodium borohydride (2,0<br>
M NaBH4) acting as the reducing agent. The pH of the silver solution was 12 - 13<br>
before use. The silver solution and reducing agent were alternately applied on the<br>
paper, at 160 °C in the air. The silver solution was allowed to spread on the paper for<br>
about 20 seconds, followed by the addition of the solution of the reducing agent. The<br>
paper was kept at 160 °C for about 2 minutes. As a result, a conductive (about 1 - 10<br>
?) silver layer was obtained on a filter paper (Whatman) by using a 100 µl<br>
application.<br>
The overall reaction:<br><br>
