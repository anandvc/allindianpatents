				<td>COLOR IMAGING SYSTEM WITH INFRARED CORRECTION<br>
Background<br>
This invention relates generally to imaging systems which may be used, for example,<br>
in connection with digital cameras, scanners, and the like.<br>
Imaging sensors based on silicon technology typically use an infrared blocking<br>
element in the optical chain. The purpose of this infrared blocking element is to prevent<br>
infrared radiation (IR) or light (typically considered to be light with a wavelength longer than<br>
780 nm) from entering the imaging array.<br>
Silicon-based devices are typically sensitive to light with wavelengths up to<br>
approximately 1200nm. If the IR is permitted to enter me array, the array responds to the IR,<br>
and generates an output image signal. Since one purpose of an imaging system is to create a<br>
representation of visible light, the IR introduces a false response and distorts the image<br>
produced by the imaging system. In a monochrome (black and white) imaging system, the<br>
result can be an obviously distorted rendition. For example, foliage and human skin tones<br>
may appear unusually light. In a color imaging system, the introduction of [R distorts the<br>
coloration and produces an image with incorrect color.<br>
A common method for preventing IR based anomalies in imaging systems uses<br>
ionically colored glass or a thin-film optical coating on glass to create an optical element<br>
which passes visible light (typically from 380 nm to 780nm) and blocks the IR. This element<br>
can be placed in front of the lens system, located within the lens system, or it can be<br>
incorporated into the imaging system package. The principal disadvantages to this approach<br>
are cost and added system complexity. Thin film coatings can be implemented at somewhat<br>
lower cost, but suffer from the additional disadvantages of exhibiting a spectral shift as a<br>
function of angle. Thus, in an imaging system these elements do not provide a uniform<br>
transmittance characteristic from the center of me image field to the edge. Both filter types<br>
add to the system complexity by introducing an extra piece-part which must be assembled<br>
into the imaging system.<br>
Digital imaging systems generally correct for what is called dark current. Dark<br>
current is what is detected by the imaging system when in fact no input image has been<br>
received. Generally dark current is isolated and subtracted either during a calibration process<br>
of the camera or on an ongoing basis. Mechanical shutters may be used to block off the<br>
optical system in between frames to provide a continuing indicia of dark current noise.<br>
This may be valuable because dark current is a strong function of temperature. Thus,<br>
it may be desirable to have a continuing indication of present dark current conditions.<br>
Dark current may also be continuously determined by providing certain pixels which<br>
are shielded from light to provide an indication of on-going dark current conditions.<br>
Thus, there is a continuing need for imaging systems which reduce completxity and<br>
cost. In particular there is a need for a system which is sensitive to light in the visible<br>
spectrum and which is insensitive to light in the infrared spectrum, without requiring<br>
an infrared filter. Moreover, there is a need for a system which can continuously<br>
correct for the effects of both dark current and infrared noise.<br>
Summary<br>
In accordance with one embodiment, an imaging system includes a shutter that<br>
is selectively tunable in a first state to pass at radiation in the visible spectrum. In a<br>
second state, the shutter substantially blocks light in the visible spectrum while<br>
passing infrared radiation. A subtractor subtracts signals indicative of the radiation<br>
passed in the first and second states.<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides an imaging method comprising the steps<br>
of: sequentially producing a first output indicative of incident infrared radiation and<br>
the absence of incident visible light and a second output indicative of incident<br>
radiation in both the visible and infrared spectra ; and subtracting said first and second<br>
outputs to produce an output corrected for infrared and dark current noise.<br>
The present invention also provides an imaging system comprising : a device<br>
sequentially turnable in a first state to pass radiation in the visible spectrum and in a<br>
second state to substantially block light in the visible spectrum while passing infrared<br>
radiation ; and a subtracter to subtract signals indicative of the radiation passed in said<br>
first and second sequential states.<br>

Detailed Description<br>
In embodiments of the present invention, the effect of IR upon an image signal is<br>
substantially reduced by electronically subtracting signals generated by IR pixel sensors from<br>
signals generated by pixel sensors responsive to both ER and visible light. The IR pixel<br>
sensors are sensitive to the IR incident upon the array comprising the sensors,, and provide the<br>
IR component of the image separately from the color channels (e.g., RGB).<br>
The IR sensors can be created using the existing commercial Color Filter Array_CCFA).<br>
materials, taking advantage of the fact that these materials are transparent to ER radiation. By<br>
a simple overlay of two CFA colors (e.g., R, B,) that have substantially no overlapping<br>
transmittance in the visible portion of the spectrum it is possible to create a composite filter<br>
element which substantially blocks the visible light and transmits only ER. If two filters are<br>
used to form the composite filter, then each of the two filters has a visible radiation pass<br>
spectrum that is disjoint from the other, so that there is substantially no transmittance of<br>
visible light through the resulting composite filter formed from the combination of the two<br>
filters. If more than two filters are used, then each filter has a visible radiation pass spectrum<br>
such that the resulting composite filter is substantially opaque to visible light. This<br>
composite filter element is thus an ER pass filter, because each of the component filters used<br>
to form the composite filter is substantially transparent to IR.<br>
As an example, Figure 1 shows the transmittance characteristics for conventional red,<br>
green, and blue CFA (pigmented acrylate) filters. Note that each filter is substantially<br>
transparent to IR. By overlaying red and blue CFA filters, the resulting transmittance of the<br>
composite ER pass filter is indicated in Figure 2, which shows that the visible spectrum is<br>
substantially blocked.<br>
The IR pass filter is used to create an ER sensitive pixel, or IR pixel sensor, by<br>
depositing the constituent filters making up the ER pass filter over a pixel circuit. This<br>
deposition can be accomplished by photolithographic techniques well known to the<br>
semiconductor industry. A pixel circuit is any circuit which absorbs radiation and provides a<br>
signal indicative of the absorbed radiation. For example, the pixel circuit may comprise a<br>
photodiode, where photons absorbed by the photodiode generate electron-hole pairs, along<br>
with additional circuits to provide an electrical signal, either a voltage or current signal,<br>
indicative of the number of photons absorbed by the photodiode.<br>
In one embodiment, Figure 3 illustrates a simplified cross-sectional view of an IR<br>
pixel sensor 300, comprising pixel circuit 310 with red CFA 320 and blue CFA_3_3fi deposited<br>
overpixel.circuit 310,. Photons in the visible region, incident upon the pixel circuit as<br>
pictorially indicated by direction 340, are substantially blocked or prevented from being<br>
absorbed by pixel circuit 310.<br>
One embodiment uses an imaging array with four types of pixel sensors: three color<br>
(e.g., RGB) types and one IR type, all fabricated with commercially available CFA materials.<br>
This provides four channels, or four types of signals, as indicated in Table 1, where the<br>
spectrum measured for each channel or pixel type is indicated.<br>
The IR component of the image signal, once known, can be subtracted from the image<br>
to give IR corrected color outputs. This is indicated by a high-level circuit as shown in<br>
Figure 4, where the IR signal on channel 4 is subtracted from each of the signals on channels<br>
1-3 by multiplexer (MUX) 410 and differencing circuit 420. Clearly, MUX 410 is not needed<br>
if three differencing circuits are available to perform subtraction of the IR signal for each<br>
color channel.<br>
Possible tiling patterns for color images are indicated in Figures 5-7, and a tiling<br>
pattern for a monochrome image is indicated in Figure 8, where W denotes a pixel sensor<br>
sensitive to the entire visible spectrum. Each pattern shown in Figures 5-8 may be considered<br>
a unit cell. Unit cells are repeated in a regular fashion throughout an imaging array.<br>
In Figures 5-7, pixel sensors labeled R, G„ and B indicate pixel sensors utilizing,<br>
respectively, red, green, and blue CFA filters. In Figures 5-8, pixel sensors labeled IR (R+B)<br>
are IR pixel sensors in which the composite IR pass filter comprises red and blue CFA filters.<br>
The pixel sensors need not actually be in physical contact with each other. The pixel<br>
circuits making up a pixel sensor are typically electrically isolated from other pixel circuits.<br>
It is to be understood that a first pixel sensor is said to be contiguous to a second pixel sensor f<br>
if and only if there are no interyvning pixel sensors between the first and second pixels. For i<br>
example, in Figure 7, the upper left pixel sensor R is contiguous to the lower left pixel sensor<br>
G, the upper pixel sensor G, and the pixel sensor B, but it is not contiguous to the lower right<br>
pixel sensor G and the IR pixel sensor. Two pixel sensors may be contiguous without<br>
actually physically touching each other.<br>
Due to chromatic aberration in the imaging lens system, the ER component of an<br>
imaged scene may not be in sharp focus. This is actually an advantage to the embodiments<br>
disclosed here because it implies that it is not necessary to sample the IR component with<br>
high spatial frequency. This is reflected in the tiling patterns indicated by Figures 7 and 8 for<br>
color and monochrome imagers, respectively.<br>
An imaging array with IR pixel sensors, whemer monochrome or color, may be used<br>
in a second mode as an IR imaging array, where only the signals from the IP. pixel sensors are<br>
utilized to form an IR image. Thus, imaging arrays made according to the embodiments<br>
disclosed here may be configured as dual mode imaging arrays, providing either an IR<br>
corrected visible image or an IR image.<br>
Embodiments with other color system may be realized, such as cyan., magenta and<br>
yellow (CMY) systems and magenta, white, and yellow (MWY) systems. In the~case of the<br>
CMY color system, it may be necessary to overlay all three colors to block visible light. The<br>
approach could be extended to the MWY color system as well, but would require additional<br>
processing to add a third color (e.g. blue or cyan). This color may be required to enable<br>
complete blocking of the visible light in an DR. sensing pixel.<br>
A digital imaging system 910, shown in Figure 9, may be used in connection with a<br>
digital camera which may provide stills and motion picture video. In addition the imaging<br>
system 910 may be used in other applications that use digital image sensors such as scanners<br>
and the like.<br>
A liquid crystal color shutter 912 is positioned in front of a lens system 914 and an<br>
image sensor. 916. The image sensor 916 may be a complementary metal oxide<br>
semiconductor (CMOS) image sensor which uses either an active pixel sensor (APS), a<br>
passive pixel sensor (PPS) system or other known techniques. Alternatively, a charge<br>
coupled device (CCD) sensor may be used.<br>
The color shutter 912 provides electronically alterable transmission spectra in<br>
different color bands, such as the red, green and blue (RGB) or cyan, magenta, yellow (CMY)<br>
primary color bands. One exemplary color shutter is the KALA filter available from<br>
CoIorLink, Inc. of Boulder, Colorado 80301. The shutter 912 is synchronously switched to<br>
successively provide color information in each of the desired bands. The KALA filter<br>
switches between an additive primary color (RGB) and a complementary subtractive primary<br>
color (CMY). Input white light is convened to orthogonally polarized complementary colors.<br>
A color shutter is electronically switchable between transmission spectra centered in<br>
each of a plurality of additive color planes such as the red, green and blue (RGB) primary<br>
color planes. The color shutter may be sequentially switched to provide three color planes<br>
that are combine.'. :o create a three color representation of an image.<br>
The use of color shutters in imaging systems may advantageously allow each pixel i<br>
image sensor to successively respond to each of three color bands. Otherwise, separate pixel<br>
image sensors must be interspersed in the array for each of the necessary color bands. Then,<br>
the missing information for each pixel site, for the remaining two color planes, is deduced<br>
using interpolation techniques. With the color shutter, every pixel can detect each of three<br>
color bands, which should increase color definition without interpolation.<br>
The image sensor 916 is coupled to an image processor 918 which processes the<br>
information from the image sensor 916 and provides an output in a desired form. The image<br>
processor 918 includes an infrared subtraction circuit 920. The circuit 920 uses a subtraction<br>
process to eliminate the infrared component from each of the color band signals<br>
synchronously provided by the color shutter 912. More particularly, the color shutter 912<br>
may provide a series of light images in each of the desired color planes which activate pixels<br>
in the sensor 916 to produce intensity signals conveyed to the image processor 918.<br>
The subtraction process can also be implemented in software. For example, the<br>
subtraction could be accomplished in a separate computer (not shown). The computer can be<br>
tethered to the camera.<br>
Referring to Figure 10, the information from the sensor 916 is then separated into four<br>
signals. The intensity signals provided by the sensor 916 include an infrared component with<br>
each of the color band signals. In an example using the RGB color bands, a red color signal<br>
1024, a green color signal 1026, and blue color signal 1028 are produced, each with<br>
associated infrared components. In addition the shutter 912 produces a black signal 1030<br>
which is substantially absent any color information and therefore only contains the infrared<br>
radiation information.<br>
Thus, the black signal 1030 (which contains only information about the infrared<br>
radiation present on the shutter 12) may be subtracted in subtracter 1032 from each of the<br>
signals 1024 to 1028 to produce the signals 1034 to 1038 which are free of the infrared<br>
component. The infrared component may be made available at line 1040. The infrared<br>
component may be useful in a number of low light situations including night cameras,<br>
surveillance operations and three dimensional imaging applications.<br>
In this way, the desired color planes may be produced absent infrared radiation noise,<br>
without using an infrared filter. Moreover, with the present techniques an infrared signal may<br>
be made available which may be useful in a number of applications. When an infrared filter<br>
is used, a useful infrared signal is not obtained.<br>
Referring to Figure 11. the process for capturing color information in the image<br>
processor 918 begins at block 1144. Initially, a color shutter 912 is set to black and a frame is<br>
acquired (as indicated in block 1146) to provide die infrared reference signal. Next the<br>
shutter is set to red (as indicated in block 1148) and a frame is acquired which includes the<br>
red information together with an infrared component (as indicated in block 1150). Similarly<br>
the green and blue information is acquired as indicated in blocks 1152 to 1158.<br>
In blocks 1160, 1162 and 1164, die red, green and blue color planes are derived by<br>
subtracting me infrared reference acquired at block 1146 from die red, green and blue frames<br>
acquired in blocks 1150, 1154 and 1158. As a result, a RGB color plane information may be<br>
outputted (as indicated in block 1166) free of the infrared component.<br>
The embodiments described above are also useful in compensating for^dark current.<br>
Each embodiment produces color bands which are substantially free of botii reference ER<br>
radiation effects and dark current. The IR reference signal 1146 includes dark current noise<br>
(without color information). Thus, when me IR reference or black frame is subtracted out,<br>
bom the IR and dark current noise are eliminated. This is accomplished at the same time as<br>
the IR noise is removed, without requiring mechanical shutters or shielded pixels. Since the<br>
dark current is continuously subtracted out, die effect of current temperature on dark current<br>
is always taken into consideration.<br>
While the present invention has been described with respect to a limited number of<br>
embodiments, those skilled in the art will appreciate numerous modifications and variations<br>
therefrom. It is intended that the appended claims cover all such modifications and variations<br>
as fall within the true spirit and scope of the present invention.<br>
