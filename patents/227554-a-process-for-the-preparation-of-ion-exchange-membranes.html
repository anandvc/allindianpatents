				<td>The present invention relates to a process for the preparation of ion-exchange membranes and the polymer blends and polymer blend membranes which consist of a polymeric sulfonic acid and of a polymer which contains primary, secondary or tertiary amino groups, which are prepared via mixing of a salt of the polymeric sulfonic acid with the polymer which contains primary, secondary or tertiary amino groups. The invention further relates to the use of polymer blend membranes in membrane fuel cells, polymer electrolyte membrane fuel cells (PEM fuel cells) or direct methanol fuel cells (DMFC) in membrane electrolysis, in aqueous or non-aqueous electrodialysis, in diffusion dialysis, in the perstractive separation of alkenes from alkene/alkane mixture (here the membranes are in the SO3Ag form, where the Ag+ forms a reversible complex with the alkene (-&gt; facilitated transport)), in pervaporative separation of water from water/organics mixtures, or in gas separation.<br>
A key cost component of the PEM fuel cell is its proton-conducting membrane. The perfluorinated ionomer Nafion® (Grot, W.G.: Per-fluorinated Ion-exchange Polymers and Their Use in Research and Industry, Macromolecular Symposia, 82, 161-172 (1994)) which has been commercially available meets the requirements of chemical stability which must be demanded of membranes for the application in PEM fuel cells (Ledjeff, K.; Heinzel, A.; Mahlendorf, F.: Peinecke, V.; Die reversible Membran-Brennstoffzelle, Dechema-Monographien Band 128, VCH Verlagsgesellschaft, 103-118 (1993)). However, it has various disadvantages whch necessitate the search for alternative materials: It is very expensive (DM 1400.-/m2). The very complex production process comprises highly toxic intermediates (See Grot, W.G.). The environment-compatibility of Nafion® is to be evaluated critically: as a perfluorinated polymer, it is hardly degradable. The recyclability of Nafion® is questionable.<br>
When applying Nafion® in direct methanol fuel cells, it was discovered that it shows a very high methanol-permeability, especially when pure methanol is used (Surampudi, S., Narayanan, S.R.; Varnos, E.; Frank, H.; Halpert, G.; LaConti, A.; Kosek, 1; Surya Prakash, G.K.; Olah, G.A.; Advances in direct oxidation methanol fuel cells, J. Power Sources, 47, 377-385 (1994)), which greatly reduces the energy efficiency of the DMFC by mixed potential formation.<br>
Partially fluorinated ionomers are presently under investigation. At this point, the scientific work of G.G. Scherer may be mentioned (Scherer, G.G.: Polymer Membranes for Fuel Cells, Ber. Bunsenges. Phys. Chem. 94, 1008-1014 (1990)); (Scherer, G.G.; BQchi, F.N.; Gupta, B.; Rouilly, M.; Mauser, P.C.;, Chapiro, A.; Radiation Grafted and Sulfonated (FEP-g-Polystyrene) - An Alternative to Perfluorinated Membranes for PEM Fuel Cells?   Proceedings   of   the   27th   Intersociety   Energy   Conversion Engineering Conference IECEC-92, San Diego, USA, Aug. 3-7, 3,419-3.424  (1992));   (Gupta,   B.;   Buchi,   F.N.;   Scherer,   G.G,:   Materials Research Aspects of Organic Solid Proton Conductors Solid State Ionics 61,   213-218   (1993));   who  formed  free  radicals  in   perfluorinated polymer foils using gamma radiation and grafted styrene onto the free radicals formed. Then, the polystyrene chains of the perfluoropoiymer-polystyrene  IPNs  (interpenetrating  polymer  networks)  formed  were sulfonated. These polymer membranes showed a good performance when used in PEM fuel cells. However, the synthetic method employed seems to be unsuitable for mass production of this type of membrane. The Canadian company Ballard has developed a partially fluorinated proton-conducting   membrane   from   sulfonated   poly(α,ß,ß-trifluoro-styrene) (Wei, J.;  Stone, C.; Steck, A.E.: Trifluorostyrene and sub-<br>
stituted trifluorostyrene copolymeric compositions and ion-exchange membranes formed therefrom, WO 95/08581, Ballard Power Systems). A disadvantage of this membrane is its high price because of the complex production process for the monomer α,ß,ß-trifiuorostyrene (Livingston, D.I.; Kamath, P.M.; Corley, R.S.: Poly-a,p,p-trifiuoro-styrene, Journal of Polymer Science, 20, 485-490 (1956)) and because of the poor capability of poly(α,ß,ß-trifluorostyrene) of being sulfonated.<br>
In the literature, some references are found relating to the application of arylene main-chain polymers to PEM fuel cells. The most important articles will be mentioned in the following:<br>
Polybenzimidazole-phosphoric acid Membranes of the engineering thermoplastic polybenzimidazole are soaked with phosphoric acid (Wainright, J.S.; Wang, J.-T.;  Savinell, R.F.; Litt, M.; Moaddel, H.; Rogers, C.: Acid Doped Polybenzimidazoles, A   New   Polymer   Electrolyte,   The   Electrochemical   Society,   Spring Meeting, San  Francisco,  May 22-27,  Extended Abstracts, Vol.  94-1, 982-983 (1994)) - the phosphoric acid works as a proton conductor. The phosphoric acid molecules are held in the membrane by hydrogen bridges   and   through   protonation   of  the   imidazole   moieties   with formation of the salt H2PO4-+ HNpolymer. However, there is a risk with these membranes that the phosphoric acid is gradually washed out of the polybenzimidazole matrix with the water formed in the fuel cell during   operation   thereof,   because   the   ratio   of   phosphoric   acid molecules to imidazole moieties is about 3:1 in these polymer blends.<br>
Sulfonated Polyethersulfone<br>
An article by Ledjeff (Nolte, R.; Ledjeff, K.; Bauer, M.; Mulhaupt, R.: Partially Sulfonated poly(arylene ether sulfone)  - A Versatile Proton<br>
Conducting Membrane Material for Modern Energy Conversion Technologies, Journal of Membrane Science 83, 211-220 (1993)) suggests the use of cross-linked sulfonated polyethersulfone ionomers, prepared by electrophilic sulfonation of polyethersulfone, as proton conductors in PEM fuel cells, However, no current-voltage characteristic of the presented membrane is given in this paper, which makes the evaluation of the suitability of this ionomer for PEM fuel cells difficult.<br>
Sulfonated PEEK<br>
In the patent literature, a reference dealing with the use of membranes of sulfonated polyetherketones (PEEK) in PEM fuel cells can be found (Helmer-Metzmann, F,; Ledjeff, K.; Nolte, R., et al.: Polymerelektrolyt-Membran und Verfahren zu ihrer Herstellung, EP 0 574 791 A2). These polymers are said to exhibit a good performance and chemical stability in PEM fuel cells. However, these membranes show high swelling values, especially at the high proton conductivities and thus ion-exchange capacities as required for PEM fuel cells, which deteriorates their mechanical properties and thus shortens their service life in fuel cells, In addition, especially when PEEK is sulfonated heterogeneously, there is a risk that the polymer partially recrystallizes (unmodified PEEK is partially crystalline), leading to brittleness.<br>
Sulfonated Polyphenylenes<br>
Membranes prepared from organic solvent soluble sulfonated, chemically and thermally stable polyphenylenes as alternative materials to replace Nafion® for use in PEM fuel cells are suggested by Matejcek, L; Nolte, R.; Heinzel, A,; Ledjeff, K.; Zerfass, T,; Mulhaupt, R.; Prey, H.: Die Membranbrennstoffzelle: Untersuchungen an Membran/Elektro-deneinheiten, Jahrestagung 1995 der Fachgruppe Angewandte Elektro-chemie der GDCh, Duisburg, 27.-29. Sept. 1995, Abstract Poster Nr. 20, <br>
(1995). However, no investigations of these membranes in PEM fuel cells have been published so far.<br>
Sulfonated Polyphenylene sulfide<br>
Miyatake, K,; lyotani, H.; Yamamoto, K.; Tsuchida, E,: Synthesis of Poly(phenylene sulfide sulfonic acid) via Poly(sulfonium cation) as a Thermostable Proton-Conducting Polymer, Macromolecules 1996, 29, 6969-6971 (1996), reports the preparation of a chemically and thermally stable sulfonated polyphenylene sulfide via a polysulfonium cation intermediate, A disadvantage of this preparation process is its being relatively complicated and thus expensive.<br>
Acid-base polymer blends based on vinyl polymers are often mentioned in the relevant literature (Bazuin, C.G.: lonomers (Compatibilization of Blends),   in:    Polymeric   Materials   Encyclopedia   (Ed.-in-Chief   J.C. Salomone), Vol. 5 (H-L), CRC Press (Boca Raton, New York, London, Tokyo)   3454-3460   (1996)),   for   example,   those   acid-base   blends containing polymethacrylates as the acidic component and polyvinyl-pyridinium salts as the basic component (Zhang, X.;  Eisenberg, A.: NMR and Dynamic Mechanical Studies of Miscibility Enhancement via Ionic Interactions in Polystyrene/po!y(ethyl Acrylate) Blends, J. Poiym. Scl.: Part B: Polymer Physics, 28, 1841-1857 (1990)). These acid-base blends have been investigated, e.g., in terms of compatibility between the acidic and basic blend components. Practical applications of these acid-base polymer blends have not become public so far.<br>
As mentioned above, the provision of chemically stable ionomer membranes for electro-membrane processes, especially for membrane fuel cells, is an important area of research. The ionomer membranes should be selected from the group of arylene main-chain polymer membranes, because these polymers exhibit the highest chemical<br>
stability next to the perfluorinated polymers. Acid-base blends based on PEEK are described in Kerres, J.; Cui, W.; Wagner, N.; Schnurnberger, W.; Eigenberger, G.: A.7 Entwicklung von Membranen fur die Elektro-lyse und fur Membranbrennstoffzellen, Vortrag, "Jahreskolloquium 1997 des Sonderforschungsbereichs 270 - Energietrager Wasserstoff", Sept. 29, 1997, Berichtsband p. 169-193 (1997); ISBN: 3-00-001796-8; Cui, W.; Kerres, J.; Eigenberger, G.: Development and Characterization of Ion-Exchange Polymer Blend Membranes, Poster, Euromembrane '97, "Progress in Membrane Science and Technology", University of Twente, June 23-27, 1997, Abstracts p. 181 (1997). The polymer blends are prepared by mixing poly(etheretherketonesulfonic acid) (PEEK SQ3H) and poly(ethersulfone-ortho-sulfonediamine)  (PSU-Nhb)  in  a dipolar-aprotic solvent followed by evaporation of the solvent. The publications describe the characterization of these special polymer blends in terms of ionic conduction, swelling, permselectivity and thermal resistance, and the use of one of these membranes alone in electrodialysis. With the method described (mixing of the polymeric sulfonic acid with the polymeric amine), only those acid-base blends can be prepared which have a very weakly basic amine component, such as poly(ethersulfone-ortho-sulfone diamine). Stronger polymeric bases immediately form an insoluble   polyelectrolyte  complex   upon   mixing  with   the  polymeric sulfonic acid.<br>
On principle, ail sulfonated aryl polymers exhibit a high brittleness when drying out, for example, when they are applied in fuel cells at intermittent conditions. The reduction in brittleness of the sulfonated aryl polymer ionomers has thus priority in their further development for long-term application in PEM fuel cells.<br>
In a first embodiment, the above object is achieved by a process for the preparation of ion-exchange membranes, characterized in that solutions of polymeric sulfonic acid salts having the general formula<br>
(Formula Removed) <br>
where X = monovalent metal cations, NH4+, NH3R+, NH2R2+, NHR3+, NR4+, pyridinium, R = any alkyl and/or aryl radical, are reacted with polymers containing primary, secondary or tertiary nitrogen in dipolar-aprotic solvents, and the obtained polymeric sulfonic acid salt/base blends are aftertreated in hot diluted mineral acid at 20 to 100 °C after storage.<br>
At least the polymeric sulfonic acid or the sulfonic acid salt of the polymer blend membranes of the invention consists of an arylene main-chain polymer (for example, polyethersulfone, polyetherketone, poly-phenylene oxide), whereby a high mechanical, chemical and thermal stability of the polymer blends is obtained, which makes the membranes of the invention a reasonable alternative of the Nafion® type perfluorinated ionomer membranes mainly used to date in PEM fuel cells and DMFCs.<br>
It has been found that mixing a polymeric sulfonic acid, for example, poly(ethersulfonesulfonic acid), or a poly(etherketonesulfonic acid salt) of general formula I<br>

poly(ethersulfonesulfonic acid) PSU Udel® with 2 sulfonic acid groups per repeating unit; obtainable according to Kerres, J.; Cui, W,; Reichle, S.: New sulfonated engineering polymers via the metalation route, I. Sulfonated poly(ethersulfone) (PSU Udel®) via metalation-sulfination-<br>

poly(etherketonesulfonic acid) with 1 sulfonic acid group per repeating unit; prepared according to Helmer-Metzmann et al.,<br>
with poty(ethersulfone-ortho-sulfone-diamine) of general formula III<br>
(Formula Removed) <br><br>
poiy(ethersulfone-ortho-sulfone-dlamlne) with 2 primary, amino groups per repeating unit, prepared according to Guiver, M.D.; Robertson, G.P.; Foley, S.: Chemical Modification of Polysulfones II: An Efficient Method for Introducing Primary Amine groups onto the aromatic chain Macromolecules 28, 7612-7621 (1995),<br>
yields  a   polymer  blend  which  Is  surprisingly  characterized   by the following properties;<br>
(1)    a high reduction in brittleness as compared to the respective pure polymeric sulfonic acid;<br>
(2)	water-soluble   polymeric   sulfonic   acids   surprisingly   lose   their<br>
water-solubility upon mixing with the polymeric basic nitrogen<br>
compound because of the interactions between the polymeric<br>
chains of the blend components;<br>
(3)	such  acid-base  blends  prepared  from  water-soluble  polymeric<br>
sulfonate salts or sulfonic adds exhibit surprisingly high ion-<br>
exchange  capacities   of  up   to   2.7   meq   S03H/g   of  polymer<br>
(sulfonated polymers of this capacity are readily water-soluble<br>
normally),   which   leads  to   extremely   low  electric  resistances<br>
(Example 11: Ra,H+ = 0.05 Ωcmz, RSP,H+ = 5.88 Ω-cm).<br>
(4)	surprisingly, the acid-base blends exhibit a methanol permeability<br>
which is reduced by a factor of 60-250 as compared to Nafion®,<br>
which probably renders their use in DMFCs advantageous;<br>
(5)	surprisingly, the acid-base blends show an excellent performance<br>
in H2-PEFCs'and DMFCs;<br>
As described above, no precipitation of poiyelectrolyte complex occurs in solutions of very weak polymeric bases, such as poly(ethersulfone-ortho-sulfonediamme), in dipolar-aprotic solvents, such as N-methyl pyrrolidinone (NMP), ,N,N-dimethylacetamide (DMAc), N,N-dimethyl-formamide (DMF), or dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) when mixed with polymeric sulfonic acids, However, when stronger polymeric bases are employed, precipitation of a poiyelectrolyte complex occurs through formation of the polysalt upon mixing the solution of such base in dipolar-aprotic solvents with a solution of the polymeric sulfonic acid in dipolar-aprotic solvents. Examples of a polymeric base which forms poiyelectrolyte complexes with polymeric sulfonic acids include poly(4-vinylpyridine). The poiyelectrolyte forming reaction is as follows;<br>
PPy + P' ~S03H	&gt; PPyH+'03S-P'<br>
Surprisingly, it has now been found that single-phase solutions can be<br>
produced by mixing solutions of a polymeric sulfonic acid salt (example:<br>
poly(etheretherketone Li sulfonate) or poly(ethersulfone Li sulfonate))<br>
with solutions of a polymeric base (example: poly(ethersulfone-ortho-<br>
sulfone-diamine),    po!y(4-viny!pyridine),    poly(ethyleneimine),    poly-<br>
(aniline); after evaporation of the solvent, they form clear, transparent<br>
and mechanically and thermally stable polymer blend films. When such<br>
polymer blend films are aftertreated with  diluted  mineral acids at<br>
temperatures of from 20 to 100°C after their preparation, even those<br>
acid-base blends are obtained via this route which are not directly<br>
available by mixing the solution of the polymeric sulfonic acid with the<br>
polymeric   amine   because   of  polyelectrolyte   precipitation.   By   this<br>
method, for example, compatible blends of poly(4-vinylpyridine) with<br>
poly(ethersulfonesulfonic acid) can be obtained, which are not directly<br>
available from poly(4-vinylpyridine) and po!y(ethersulfonesulfonic acid)<br>
because of polyelectrolyte precipitation.<br>
By the above-mentioned roundabout route, almost any polymeric sulfonic acid/any polymeric sulfonic acid salt can be combined with almost any polymeric (primary/secondary/tertiary) amine to give at least a compatible polymer blend. The properties of the respective acid-base blend can be tailored by appropriate selection of the reaction partners.<br>
The advantageous properties of the acid-base blends are due to specific interactions between the polymeric chains of the blend components (see Bazuin, C.G.; Zhang, X.; Eisenberg, A.: NMR and Dynamic Mechanical Studies of Misclbility Enhancement via Ionic Interactions in Polystyrene/poly(ethyl Acrylate) Blends, J. Polym. Sci.: Part B: Polymer Physics, 28, 1841-1857 (1990)):<br>
•	hydrogen bridges<br>
»       acid-base interactions<br>
•	ion-dipole interactions<br>
These specific interactions result in compatibility and in part in molecular miscibility of the polymeric sulfonic acids/polymeric sulfonic acid salts with the polymeric basic nitrogen compounds.<br>
In addition to the applications already mentioned, i.e., direct methano! and H2 membrane fuel cells, the acid-base blends can be advantageously used in other membrane processes:<br>
•	membrane electrolysis<br>
•	aqueous or non-aqueous electrodialysis<br>
•	diffusion dialysis<br>
•	separation  of alkenes  from  alkene/alkane  mixtures  (here the<br>
membranes are in the SO3Ag form, where the Ag+ reversibly<br><br>
complexes the alkene and thus selectively carries it through the membrane (-&gt; facilitated transport) (van Zyl, AJ.; Linkov, V.M.; Bobrova,    LP.;    Tirnofeev,    S.V:    Perfluorosulfonate   lonomer Membranes for Separation of Petrochemical Mixtures, J. Mat. Sci. Lett.,  15,  1459 (1996)) via  gas separation,  pervaporation or<br>

Preparation of an acid-base blend from sulfonated PEEK and aminated PSU (by analogy with J. Kerres et al., supra)<br>
Poly(etheretherketonesulfonic acid) Victrex® was prepared according to Helmer-Metzmann et al. The polymer exhibits an ion-exchange capacity of 1.66 meq S03H/g. Aminated  polysulfone  Udel® was prepared by known processes (by analogy with Guiver et al., supra). This polymer has 2 amino groups per repeating unit. The poly(etheretherketone-sulfonic acid) and the aminated polysulfone were mixed in different mixing ratios (Table 1), and the resulting mixture was dissolved in N-methylpyrrolidinone  to  give  a   15%   by  weight  solution.   After its preparation, the solution was filtered and degassed. Subsequently, the polymer solution was spread on a support (e.g., glass plate) to give a thin film, and then the solvent was evaporated at 125 °C in an oven with   circulating   air   or   in   a   vacuum-drying   chamber.   After   the evaporation of the solvent, the glass plate with the polymeric film was placed in a trough with deionized water. After 1/2 h, the membrane had separated from the glass plate. The membrane was aftertreated first in 1 N HCI for 48 h and then in deionized water for 48 h, each at 60°C, Subsequently, Its properties were characterized. The characterization results are listed in Table 1.<br>

Example 12:<br>
Preparation of an acid-base blend from sulfonated PSU and poly(4-vinylpyridine)<br>
5.7 g of sulfonated PSU in the SO3Li form (IEC =1.6 meq/g) was dissolved in 24 g of N-methylpyrrolidinone (NMP), Subsequently, 0,3 g of poly(4-vinylpyridine) (MW = 200,000 g/mol) was weighed and dissolved in this solution. After its preparation, the solution was filtered and degassed. Subsequently, the polymer solution was spread on a support (e.g., glass plate) to give a thin film, and then the solvent was evaporated at 125 °C in an oven with circulating air or in a vacuum-drying chamber. After the evaporation of the solvent, the glass plate with the polymeric film was placed in a trough with deionized water. After 1/2 h, the membrane had separated from the glass plate. The membrane was aftertreated first in 1 N HCI for 48 h and then in deionized water,for 48 h, each at 70°C. Subsequently, its properties were characterized.<br>

Example 13.1<br>
Preparation  of an  acid-base  blend  from  sulfonated  PSU  and  poly-ethyleneimine<br>
3 g of water-soluble sulfonated polysulfone Udel® in the S03Li form (ion-exchange capacity 2.5 meq SQ3H/g of polymer) was dissolved in 17 g of N,N-dirnethylacetamide (DMAc). Subsequently, 0.322 g of 50% by weight aqueous polyethyleneimine solution (ALDRICH; prod. No. 18,197-8) was added dropwise to the solution. After its preparation, the solution was filtered and degassed. Subsequently, the polymer solution was spread on a support (e.g., glass plate) to give a thin film, and then the solvent was evaporated at 125 °C in an oven with circulating air or in a vacuum-drying chamber. After the evaporation of the solvent, the glass plate with the polymeric film was placed in a trough with deionized water. After 1/2 h, the membrane had separated from the glass plate. The membrane was aftertreated first in 1 N HCI for 48 h and then in deionized water for 48 h, each at 70°C. Subsequently, its properties were characterized.<br>
Characterization results:<br>
Ion-exchange capacity:	IEC = 1.65 meq S03H/g of polymer<br>
Thickness:	d = 110 µm<br>
Swelling (H20, RT, H+ form):	SW = 160%<br>

Reference Example 8:<br>
Application of an acid-base blend membrane in an<br>
Two of the membranes (Reference Example 2, upper curve, and Reference Example 1, lower curve in Fig. 1) were tested in an H2-PEFC in oxygen and in air mode. The membranes were coated with SIEMENS electrodes having a Pt content of 4 mg of Pt/g.<br>
The experimental conditions in 02/H2 mode were:<br>
Pressure:	2 bar absolute<br>
Lambda:	2<br>
Temperature:       80°C<br>
The current-voltage characteristic obtained in O2/H2 mode is shown in Fig. l.<br>
The experimental conditions in air/H2 mode were:<br>
Pressure:	1.5 bar absolute<br>
Lambda:	10<br>
Temperature:      65°C<br>
The current-voltage characteristic obtained in air/H2 mode is shown in Fig. 2.<br>
From Figures 1 and 2, it can be seen that the performance of the membranes examined in H2 fuel cells is excellent both in 02 and in air mode.<br>
Example_l4:<br>
Application of an acid-base blend membrane in a DMFC<br>
One of the membranes (Reference Example 1) was tested in a direct methanol fuel cell (DMFC) in air mode. The membranes were coated with SIEMENS electrodes. The concentration of methanol in the methanol/water mixture was 0.5 mol/l.<br>
The experimental conditions in air/methanol mode were as follows:<br>
Pressure:	1.5/1.5 bar absolute<br>
Flow:	100 ml/min air<br>
Temperature:      80°C<br>
The current-voltage characteristic obtained in air/methanol mode is shown in Fig. 3.<br>
From Fig. 3, it can be seen that surprisingly the performance of the membrane is nearly as good as that of Nafion® 117. By a further thickness reduction of the membrane and/or reduction of its methanol permeability by incorporating a higher level of aminated PSU, even a better performance of the membranes as compared to Nafion is obtained.<br><br><br><br><br>
