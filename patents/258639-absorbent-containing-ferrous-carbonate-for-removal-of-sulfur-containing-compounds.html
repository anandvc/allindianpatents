				<td>SULFUR REMOVAL USING FERROUS CARBONATE ABSORBENT<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001] This Invention relates to an absorbent composition useful for removing<br>
sulfur-containing compounds from a variety of fluids, and particularly from liquid and<br>
gaseous hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide. The absorbent primarily comprises<br>
ferrous carbonate, desirably obtained from the mineral siderite, and is used for<br>
removing hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans, dimethyl disulfide and other sulfur-<br>
containing compounds from gaseous hydrocarbon streams, light liquid hydrocarbon<br>
streams such as natural gas liquids ("NGL"), crude oil, acid-gas mixtures, carbon<br>
dioxide gas and liquid, anaerobic gas, landfill gas, geothermal gas, and the like.<br>
Methods for making and using the absorbent for sulfur removal are also disclosed.<br>
2.	Description of Related Art<br>
[0002] Because of the noxious, toxic and corrosive nature of sulfur-containing<br>
compounds, many different products and methods have previously been disclosed<br>
for use in removing such compounds from liquid and gaseous streams. One such<br>
commercially available product is SULFATREAT® brand particulate reactant that is<br>
said to be useful for removing hydrogen sulfide and other sulfur contaminants from<br>
gases and liquids including, for example, hydrocarbon fuels and geothermal steam<br>
for sale to producers of natural gas and the like. SULFATREAT® is a federally<br>
registered trademark of M-l L.L.C. of Houston, Texas, and, in stylized form, of Gas<br>
1<br><br>
Sweetener Associates, Inc. of Chesterfield, Missouri. The SULFATREAT® material<br>
has a proprietary formulation but is believed to comprise primarily ferric oxide<br>
particles having a high surface area. Iron sponge is another commercially available<br>
material composed of ferric oxide distributed on wood chips that is being used for<br>
sulfur removal in industrial processes,<br>
[0003] Other iron-containing compositions and methods for removing sulfur<br>
from gas and liquid streams are disclosed, for example, in United States Patent Nos.<br>
4,008,775; 4,344,842; 4,366,131; 4,476,027; 4,705,638; 4,956,160 and 5,948,269.<br>
U.S. 5,948,269, for example, discloses a process for the removal of dissolved<br>
hydrogen sulfide and other malodorous compounds from aqueous liquid or sludge<br>
waste systems such as found in sewage collection and treatment works; industrial<br>
and commercial waste systems, natural and manmade polluted impoundments or<br>
waterways, and septic systems, by use of "alkaline iron." As used in U.S. 5,948,269,<br>
"alkaline iron" refers to an alkali with a variety of iron compounds including ferrous<br>
carbonate.<br>
2<br><br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0004] The absorbent and method disclosed herein are particularly effective<br>
for absorbing hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans, dimethyldisulfide and other sulfur-<br>
containing compounds from natural gas, light hydrocarbon streams such as natural<br>
gas liquids, crude oil, acid gas mixtures, carbon dioxide gas and liquid, anaerobic<br>
gas, landfill gas, geothermal and other sulfur-containing streams. According to a<br>
preferred embodiment of the invention, the subject absorbent comprises ferrous<br>
carbonate, most preferably siderite granules or powdered siderite that is extruded or<br>
otherwise aggregated, compacted or formed into pellets, prills or spheroids using a<br>
minor effective amount of moisture and, optionally, a binder such as calcium<br>
aluminate cement or another similarly effective material.<br>
[0005] According to another embodiment of the invention, an absorbent bed<br>
is disclosed for use in removing sulfur from gas, liquid or mixed gas and liquid<br>
streams. Examples of sulfur-containing compounds removed by the absorbent<br>
include hydrogen sulfide, mercaptan-containing compounds, organic disulfides and<br>
carbonyl sulfide. The absorbent bed desirably comprises a three-dimensional array<br>
of closely spaced pellets, prills, or otherwise-manufactured aggregates comprising<br>
from about 50 to about 100 weight percent ferrous carbonate, most preferably in the<br>
form of particulate siderite (90% through 100 mesh) aggregated using a binder<br>
comprising from about two to about ten weight percent calcium aluminate cement.<br>
According to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the absorbent<br>
comprises dried extrudates containing about 95 weight percent siderite and about 5<br>
weight percent calcium aluminate cement.<br>
[0006] According to another embodiment of the invention, an absorbent<br>
material is made by mixing about 95 parts by weight particulate siderite (90%<br>
through 100 mesh), about 5 parts calcium aluminate cement, and about 20 parts<br>
water; compacting the mixture by extrusion or otherwise to produce larger particles,<br>
pellets or prills, and thereafter drying the absorbent for a sufficient time to reduce the<br>
moisture content to a moisture level less than about three weight percent. According<br>
to a particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, the absorbent pellets have a<br>
diameter of about 3/16 inch, a length of about 5/16 inch, and are dried at about<br>
120°F for about four hours.<br>
[0007] According to another embodiment of the invention, sulfur is removed<br>
from a liquid, gas, or mixed gas and liquid stream comprising sulfur-containing<br>
3<br><br>
compounds by causing the stream to pass through an absorbent bed consisting<br>
essentially of particulate material comprising from about 70 to about 100 weight<br>
percent ferrous carbonate, preferably in the form of aggregated particulate siderite.<br>
The absorbent bed most preferably comprises a plurality of pellets comprising from<br>
about 70 to about 100 weight percent ferrous carbonate in combination with an<br>
amount of a binder such as calcium aluminate cement that is sufficient to hold the<br>
absorbent in a desired physical configuration for a desired service life. It will be<br>
appreciated by those of ordinary skill in the art upon reading this disclosure that the<br>
amount of the inventive absorbent that is needed in the absorbent bed will depend<br>
upon factors such as the absorbent particle size, the bed density, the effective<br>
surface area of the absorbent particles, the amount of ferrous carbonate in the<br>
absorbent that is available to absorb the sulfur-containing compounds, and the<br>
temperature, pressure, velocity and residence time of the gas or liquid stream being<br>
treated as it passes through the bed.<br>
[0008] According to another embodiment of the invention, ferrous carbonate<br>
absorbent that has become blackened is periodically regenerated by contacting the<br>
blackened ferrous carbonate with air or another oxygen-containing gas and steam.<br>
Such blackening is believed to be caused by the formation of ferrous sulfide on the<br>
surface of the ferrous carbonate during the removal of sulfur from a liquid, gas, or<br>
mixed gas and liquid stream comprising sulfur-containing compounds.<br>
[0009] According to another embodiment of the invention, sulfur is removed<br>
from a liquid, gas, or mixed gas and liquid stream comprising sulfur-containing<br>
compounds by combining the stream with oxygen and water vapor prior to feeding<br>
the stream to a bed of ferrous carbonate. This method is particularly preferred for<br>
use in removing sulfur from acid gases.<br>
[0010] According to another embodiment of the invention, sulfur is removed<br>
from a liquid, gas or mixed gas and liquid stream comprising sulfur-containing<br>
compounds by passing the stream through a bed of ferrous carbonate in a moist air<br>
environment By subjecting the ferrous carbonate to moist air or another oxygen-<br>
containing gas and water vapor during absorption, the ferrous carbonate is believed<br>
to be continuously regenerated by a catalytic effect, ultimately producing elemental<br>
sulfur that can be easily separated from the process stream.<br>
[0011] According to another embodiment of the invention, a method is<br>
disclosed for removing  hydrogen  sulfide  evolved  during  natural  gas  drilling<br>
4<br><br>
operations, the method comprising adding to a drilling mud used in said drilling<br>
operations from about 40 to about 400 pounds of a finely ground particulate<br>
absorbent (particles passing through a 100 mesh screen), preferably comprising<br>
from about 50 to about 90 weight percent ferrous carbonate, per ton of drilling mud.<br>
No binder is needed or desirable when the finely ground ferrous carbonate is added<br>
to drilling mud according to this embodiment of the invention.<br>
5<br><br>
DESCRIPTION OF THE PREFERRED EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0012] Applicant has discovered that ferrous carbonate, preferably in the<br>
form of the mineral siderite, is an excellent absorbent of hydrogen sulfide, carbonyl<br>
sulfide, organic disulfides, mercaptans and other sulfur-containing compounds that<br>
are present in various naturally occurring or synthesized gases and liquids, and<br>
particularly, in gaseous and liquid hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide. Siderite<br>
predominantly comprises ferrous carbonate, and is usually found naturally in<br>
combination with some calcium, magnesium or manganese. For use in the<br>
compositions and various methods of the invention, the siderite can be sourced in<br>
the form of chunks, granules, or finely divided powder. If sourced in chunks, the<br>
chunks are desirably reduced to granules of a suitable size or powdered prior to use.<br>
For use in bed applications, extrudates, as described below, or comparably sized<br>
siderite granules obtained from natural ores are preferred. If siderite is sourced in<br>
the form of a finely ground powder, the powder is desirably agglomerated and<br>
extruded or otherwise shaped prior to use, except when intended for use in<br>
applications such as drilling muds, where the use of siderite powder is recommended<br>
without prior agglomeration to form larger particles.<br>
[0013] In some cases, merely adding up to about 20 weight percent water to<br>
the siderite powder, with mixing, will provided sufficient agglomeration to permit<br>
powdered siderite to be extruded into pellets of suitable size or strands that, when<br>
dried and subsequently handled, will be friable or easily broken into granules that are<br>
satisfactory for use in absorption beds through which sulfur-containing liquids or<br>
gases can be passed or circulated for sulfur removal. In some cases, the use of a<br>
minor effective amount of a binder, most preferably a cementitious material as<br>
further described below may be desirable for use in agglomerating finely divided<br>
ferrous carbonate powders.<br>
[0014] Although it will be appreciated upon reading this disclosure that<br>
ferrous carbonate can be synthesized, the use of ferrous carbonate obtained in<br>
naturally occurring siderite mineral ores is preferred for economic reasons. Hawley's<br>
Condensed Chemical Dictionary (Twelfth Edition) reports that siderite ores naturally<br>
occur in Vermont, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, North Carolina,<br>
Pennsylvania, Ohio and Europe.<br>
[0015] Extrudates useful in the absorbent bed of the invention can be<br>
prepared by mixing powdered siderite with a minor effective amount, such as about 5<br>
6<br><br>
weight percent of the total, of a binder such as calcium alumlnate cement or another<br>
similarly effective material that does not significantly detract from the ability of the<br>
siderite to absorb sulfur or sulfur-containing compounds from a gas or liquid stream.<br>
A preferred calcium aluminate cement for use in the invention is marketed under the<br>
trademark FONDU® by Lafarge Aluminate of Chesapeake, Virginia. According to a<br>
particularly preferred embodiment of the invention, about 5 parts by weight calcium<br>
aiuminate cement is blended into about 95 parts by weight siderite powder (90%<br>
through 100 mesh) to distribute the cement throughout the siderite.<br>
[0016] About 20 parts by weight water per 100 parts by weight of blended<br>
siderite and cement is desirably admixed with the solids to hydrate the binder and<br>
facilitate the formation of larger aggregates, which are then dried to a desired<br>
moisture content. Most preferably, the siderite, cement and water mixture is extruded<br>
and chopped, such as by use of a rotary pelletizer, or otherwise divided or broken,<br>
into extrudates having a diameter of approximately 3/16 inch and a length of<br>
approximately 5/16 inch. The extrudates produced from powder as described above<br>
are desirably dried at a temperature of about 120°F for about four hours. Although<br>
the required drying time can vary according to the size and dimensions of the pellets,<br>
the drying temperature and the humidity of the ambient air, the moisture content of<br>
the aggregated solids is desirably reduced to less than about three weight percent<br>
during the drying stage.<br>
[0017] The absorbent and method disclosed herein are particularly effective<br>
for absorbing hydrogen sulfide, mercaptans, dimethyldisulfide and other sulfur<br>
compounds from natural gas, light hydrocarbon streams such as NGL, crude oil, acid<br>
gas mixtures, carbon dioxide gas and liquid, anaerobic gas, landfill gas, geothermal<br>
and other sulfur-containing streams. For most applications, the sulfur-containing<br>
fluid to be treated is passed through a bed of the subject absorbent pellets or<br>
granules that are disposed inside a vessel such as a cylindrical tower. The amount<br>
of absorbent that is needed in the absorbent bed will depend upon many factors<br>
such as the sulfur content in the feed, the desired sulfur content in the effluent, the<br>
desired lifetime of an absorbent charge, the absorbent particle size, the bed density,<br>
the effective surface area of the absorbent particles, the amount of ferrous carbonate<br>
in the absorbent that is available to absorb the sulfur-containing compounds, and the<br>
temperature, pressure, velocity and residence time of the gas or liquid stream being<br>
treated as it passes through the bed. For some applications, such as the treatment<br>
7<br><br>
of sour gases encountered during well drilling operations, granulated siderite<br>
absorbent that passes through a 100 mesh sieve can also be beneficially used by<br>
combining it with another material such as drilling mud being pumped into a well.<br>
[0018] Although extrudates having dimensions ranging from about 1/16 inch<br>
to about 1/4 inch are a particularly preferred form for use of the subject absorbent, it<br>
will be appreciated that granules of suitable size can be produced by pulverizing<br>
siderite chunks in a hammer mill or by using other commercially available devices<br>
well known to those of ordinary skill in the art, and thereafter screening to a suitable<br>
particle size range preferably not exceeding about 5/16 inch. Similarly, where<br>
siderite powder or synthetically produced ferrous carbonate powder is the starting<br>
material, means other than extrusion can also be used for agglomerating or<br>
densifying the powder for use in various sulfur removal processes. Such other<br>
means include, for example, hydraulically actuated presses or other compaction<br>
devices. In most cases, minor effective amounts of a binder and water are desirably<br>
added to the powdered siderite or ferrous carbonate to facilitate agglomeration of the<br>
individual mineral particles into larger solid bodies, provided that the binder does not<br>
too greatly reduce the effective surface area of the absorbent.<br>
Representative Siderite Analysis<br>
[0019] A processed siderite composition having a bulk density of 110 pounds<br>
per cubic foot, a specific gravity of 3.63 and a particle size of 90% through 100<br>
mesh, has the following analysis:<br>

Sample A<br>
[0020] To demonstrate the utility of the invention, a finely divided siderite<br>
powder (90% through 100 mesh) was blended with calcium aluminate cement in a<br>
ratio of 95 parts siderite to 5 parts cement by weight. Approximately 20 parts by<br>
weight water were blended with the siderite and cement mixture, and the mixture<br>
was then extruded to produce a plurality of extrudates having a diameter of about<br>
3/16 inch and a length of about 5/16 inch. These extrudates were dried at 120<br>
degrees F. for four hours to a moisture content less than about 3 wt. %.<br>
Sample B<br>
[0021] Another siderite material was produced by obtaining chunks of siderite<br>
ore approximately 3 to 4 inches in diameter and grinding them to produce granular<br>
particles comprising about 90 wt.% ferrous carbonate and ranging in size from about<br>
1/8 inch to about % inch. Dirt and other contaminants were removed from the<br>
granulated siderite using a sieve.<br>
[0022] The usefulness of the absorbent materials, when prepared as<br>
described above, for removing sulfur from gas and liquid streams containing<br>
sulfurous compounds is further described and explained in relation to the examples<br>
presented below. All stated inlet and outlet compositions are in parts per million<br>
(ppm). Front end sulfurs are stated in ppm of the sulfur-containing compound by<br>
weight of the fluid stream. Thiols are stated in ppm of the respective thiol by weight<br>

of the fluid stream. (Some decimal values throughout the Tables below are rounded<br>
due to space considerations.)<br>

[0045] The foregoing examples demonstrate the removal of hydrogen sulfide,<br>
thiols (mercaptans), disulfides and carbonyl sulfide from NGL liquid and from the<br>
gaseous hydrocarbons and carbon dioxide. Dimethyidisulfide (DMDS) can also be<br>
removed by absorption using the compositions and method of the invention. The<br>
increase in DMDS observed in some of the examples is believed to be the result of<br>
oxidative sweetening reactions in which a small amount of oxygen dissolved in the<br>
treated fluid was catalyzed by the iron in the absorbent to promote the oxidation of a<br>
small amount of methyl mercaptan to form DMDS plus water.<br>
[0046] Increases in the level of carbon disulfide were also noticed in some of<br>
the examples. The sulfur analyses were done by sulfur chemiluminescence.<br>
Carbon disulfide analysis is very sensitive to the analytical technique used. Since<br>
the level of carbon disulfide is very low in the feed, small changes in composition can<br>
cause large errors. Errors can also occur because carbon disulfide often<br>
contaminates the feed lines, which can thereafter release small amounts of carbon<br>
disulfide without notice. When the feed lines were freshly replaced, no reduction in<br>
the carbon disulfide content of the fluid stream was measured, and it is believed that<br>
little or no carbon disulfide was removed by the absorbent.<br>
[0047] The data from Tables 1 and 2 demonstrate that both forms of the<br>
absorbent, extrudates (Sample A material) and granules (Sample B material),<br>
remove essentially all of the hydrogen sulfide from a CO2 acid gas stream at ambient<br>
temperatures. About half the carbonyl sulfide was removed over both physical forms<br>
of the absorbents. The thiols (mercaptans) were also removed at high levels over<br>
the granules (99-100%) and over the extrudates (78-96%).<br>
[0048] The data from Tables 3-6 demonstrate that 99 to 100% of the<br>
hydrogen sulfide can be removed from natural gas at ambient temperatures using<br>
the absorbent and method of the invention.   The data further demonstrate the<br>
22<br><br>
removal of 78-100% or the teros, along with some removal of both carbonyl sulfide<br>
and DMDS from the treated fluids.<br>
[0049] Comparison of Tables 3-6 (70°F data) with Tables 7-8 (100°F data)<br>
and Tables 9-10 (130°F data) shows the effect of temperature. The data<br>
demonstrate that 99 to 100% of the hydrogen sulfide is removed at all temperatures<br>
using the subject absorbent and method. The thiol removal decreased with<br>
increasing temperatures, suggesting that the thiols are desorbing at the higher<br>
temperatures. Conversely, the removal of carbonyl sulfide and DMDS increased<br>
with increasing temperatures within the ranges tested.<br>
[0050] The tests done using a gaseous carbon dioxide feed demonstrate that<br>
increasing the pressure from 200 psig (see Tables 1 and 2) to 500 psig (see Tables<br>
15 through 22) appears to aid in the absorption of the thiols. DMDS was 95 to 96%<br>
removed at the higher pressure, in comparison to 20 to 72% removal at 200 psig.<br>
[0051] NGL liquids tend to be low in hydrogen sulfide concentration. Without<br>
competition from hydrogen sulfide, the thiols are removed at levels ranging from 86<br>
to 96% (see Tables 11, 12, 13 and 14). Since oxygen is soluble in this kind of<br>
hydrocarbon, the production of DMDS in some the runs may be attributable to the<br>
oxidative conversion of small amounts of methyl thiol to DMDS as noted above.<br>
[0052] Following use in the iron pellet treater, the Sample A material was<br>
removed and examined. The extrudates were uniformly dark from the edge to center<br>
after having absorbed 1.2 weight percent sulfur, by weight of the extrudate, from the<br>
treated fluid. This observation suggests the occurrence of an exchange reaction<br>
during use that causes the sulfur to migrate toward the center of the absorbent.<br>
Based upon the composition of the absorbent, the dark (black) color is believed to be<br>
ferrous sulfide. The removed extrudates became hot (&gt;135 °F) while sitting out at<br>
room temperature, suggesting that the used material is pyrophoric. After sitting out<br>
overnight, the used material returned to a lighter brown color more similar to that of<br>
the original, pre-use extrudates.<br>
[0053] The general conclusion to be drawn from the data presented above is<br>
that siderite, whether in the form of granules or in the form of extrudates made from<br>
siderite powder, is an excellent absorbent for hydrogen sulfide, thiols (mercaptans),<br>
DMDS and carbonyl sulfide in a variety of feed streams. When the reaction<br>
conditions favor hydrogen sulfide removal, i.e., higher temperatures and pressures,<br>
23<br><br>
the thiol removal decreases. the thiols are removed more favorably when the<br>
hydrogen sulfide level is low in the feed, at low temperatures, and at high pressures.<br>
[0054] Ferrous carbonate absorbent that has become blackened can be<br>
regenerated periodically by contacting the blackened ferrous carbonate with air and<br>
steam. Such blackening is beiieved to be caused by the formation of ferrous sulfide<br>
on the surface of the ferrous carbonate during the removal of sulfur from a liquid,<br>
gas, or mixed gas and liquid stream comprising sulfur-containing compounds.<br>
[0055] According to another method of the invention, sulfur is removed from<br>
a liquid, gas, or mixed gas and liquid stream comprising sulfur-containing<br>
compounds by combining the stream with oxygen and water vapor prior to feeding<br>
the stream to a bed of ferrous carbonate. This method is particularly preferred for<br>
use in removing sulfur from acid gases but is not preferred for use in natural gas<br>
streams because of the economic disadvantages in subsequently separating the air<br>
and hydrocarbons.<br>
[0056] Alternatively, sulfur can be removed from a liquid, gas or mixed gas<br>
and liquid stream comprising sulfur-containing compounds by passing the stream<br>
through a bed of ferrous carbonate in a moist air environment. By subjecting the<br>
ferrous carbonate to moist air or to oxygen and water vapor during absorption, the<br>
ferrous carbonate is believed to be continuously regenerated by a catalytic effect<br>
ultimately producing elemental sulfur that can be easily separated from the process<br>
stream. Siderite is also a particularly preferred ferrous carbonate material for use as<br>
the absorbent in practicing these methods of the invention.<br>
[0057] The following additional Examples demonstrate the efficacy of<br>
removing sulfur from an acid gas stream combined with air by passing the stream<br>
through a bed of ferrous carbonate in the form of siderite pellets. In each example,<br>
the treater was 24 inches high and 2 inches diameter, and had a treater bed L/D<br>
ratio of 4:1 with catalyst/absorbent bed dimensions of 8 inches high by 2 inches<br>
diameter.<br>
