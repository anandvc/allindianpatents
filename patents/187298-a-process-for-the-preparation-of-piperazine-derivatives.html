b.	5xi03~2xl04 cells were added into each well of 96-well plate and<br>
cultured in 5% CO2 incubator, at 37 oC, for 24 hours.<br>
c.	Each sample drug was dissolved in a little DMSO and diluted with<br>
the used medium to a prescribed concentration for experiments,<br>
wherein the final concentration of DMSO was controlled below 0.5%.<br>
d.	Medium of each well cultured for 24 hours as above b. was<br>
removed by aspiration. Each 200//1 of drug samples prepared in c. was<br>
added into each well and the wells were cultured for 48 hours. Tz(time<br>
zero) plates were collected at the point of time drugs were added.<br>
e. According to the SRB assay method, cell fixing with TCA, staining with 0.4% SRB solution, washing with 1% acetic acid and elution of dye with lOmM Tris solution were carried out on Tz plates and culture-ended plates, and then, OD values were measured at 520 nm.<br>
C. Calculation of result<br>
a.	Time zero(Tz) value was determined with measuring the SRB<br>
protein value at the point of time drugs were added.<br>
b.	Control value(C) was determined with the OD value of an well<br>
untreated with drug.<br>
c.	Drug-treated test value(T) was determined with the OD value of<br>
drug-treated well.<br>
d.	Effects of drugs were estimated with growth stimulation, net<br>
growth inhibition, net killing etc. calculated from Tz, C and T.<br>
e.	If T ^ Tz, cellular response function was calculated by<br>
lOOx(T-Tz)AC-Tz), and if T   
are shown in the next table 1.<br>

D. Results.<br>
It was found that compounds of the present invention have the<br>
superior antitumor activities than those of cisplatin, one control, and equal to or higher antitumor activities than those of adriamycin, another control, against human solid cancer cell lines.<br>

In vitro antitumor effects against animal leukemia cells.<br>
A.	Materials :<br>
Tumor cell lines '■ L1210(mouse leukemia cell)<br>

B.	Method : Dye Exclusion Assay.<br>
1) The concentrations of L1210 and P388 cells being cultured in RPMI 1640 media containing 10% FBS were regulated to 1 x 10° cells/ml.<br>
2)	Sample drugs of respective concentrations diluted in the ratio of log doses were added into cell media, and cultured at 37 oC, for 48 hours, in 50% CO2 incubator, and then viable cell number was measured by dye exclusion test using trypan blue.<br>
3)	The concentration of sample compounds showing 50 % cell growth inhibition(IC<so compared with the control were detennined and listed in table below.></so>

C. Results<br>
As the results of measurement of antitumor activities of compounds of the present invention against L1210 and P388 mouse cancer cells, it was found that the compounds tested have equal to or higher antitumor activities than those of the control drug, mitomycin C.<br>

Experimental 3.<br>
* In vivo antitumor effects against mouse leukemia P388 cells.<br>
A.	Material of experiment<br>
BDF1 mice were used.<br>
B.	Method of experiment<br>
1)	Leukemia P388 cells being transfer-cultured successively in DBA/2 mouse, were grafted into each mouse of a group comprising 8 mice of 6 week old BDF1 mouse with the dose of 1 XlO'cells/O.lml.<br>
2)	Sample drugs were dissolved in PBS or suspended in 0.5% tween 80, and then injected into abdominal cavity of mouse at each prescribed concentration on days 1, 5, 9, respectively.<br>
3)	With observation everyl)ay, survival times of tested mice were measured. Antitumor activities was determined in such a manner that the increasing ratio(T/C%) of average survival days of drug-treated groups compared with the control group was calculated using the mean survival times of each tested groups.<br>

Experimental 4.<br>
Acute toxicity test (LD50) : Litchfield-Wilcoxon method.<br>
6 weeks old ICR mice(male 30±2.0g) were fed freely with solid feed and water at room temperature, 23±1*C and at humidity 60 ±5%. Sample drugs were injected into the abdominal cavities of mice, while each group comprises 6 mice. Observed during 14 days, external appearances and life or dead were recorded, and then, visible pathogenies were observed from dead animals by dissection. LD50 value was calculated by Litchfiled-wilcoxon method. The results are shown at the next table 4.<br>
