				<td>COATING METHOD FOR PIPE HAVING WELD BEAD<br>
The present invention relates to a method of coating<br>
metal pipe and, more particularly, to coating pipe having a<br>
weld bead on its outer circumference.<br>
Protective coatings are extensively used to protect metal<br>
pipe, for example steel pipe, from corrosion and mechanical<br>
damage.  A widely used commercially available coating is that<br>
described in U.S. Patent 5,026,451 (Trzecieski et al) assigned<br>
to the present applicant, wherein an epoxy resin is applied on<br>
the pipe and an outer polyolefin covering is bonded to the<br>
epoxy layer through an intermediate copolymer adhesive layer.<br>
In a preferred embodiment, the Trzecieski et al patent<br>
described applying the outer polyolefin covering by a cross<br>
head extrusion process.<br>
In the cross head extrusion process, the polyolefin is<br>
extruded through an annular die, through the centre of which<br>
the pipe is fed axially. Because there are practical<br>
limitations on the diameters of cross head extrusion dies, it<br>
is preferred in the case of pipe of large diameter to provide<br>
the outer covering by a side wrap process wherein a continuous<br>
sheet of polyolefin is wrapped helically about the exterior<br>
circumference of the pipe.<br>
Steel pipes are provided in two basic configurations.<br>
Seamless pipe is formed continuously from molten steel into a<br>
tube, and therefore there is no seam or weld. Such pipes can<br>
be coated without any concern about covering a raised weld.<br>
However, seamless pipes cannot be made in very large<br>
diameters, and are expensive. Thus their use is confined to<br>
applications involving very high pressures or stresses, such<br>
as catenary risers or subsea flow lines, or applications<br>
exposed to large, continuous mechanical stresses, such as<br>
drill pipe and casing. Most pipes used to transport oil, gas<br><br>
and water are welded pipes. These are produced from steel<br>
plate which is bent and formed into a tube, then welded along<br>
the edges to form a pipe. With small diameter pipes, it is<br>
common to use electric resistance welding (ERW), which results<br>
in a weld seam which is flush with the body of the pipe.<br>
However, this method is restricted to relatively small<br>
diameter pipe, currently being 24" or less in diameter. Pipes<br>
larger than that are formed in such a way that the weld seams<br>
protrude above the outer surface of the remainder of the pipe.<br>
There are two basic procedures for manufacturing large<br>
diameter pipe. The first, and most common, is to form steel<br>
plate into a "U"shape, then further into an "0" shape. The<br>
edges are then welded together to create a so-called<br>
"longseam" pipe. The second method, which is gaining in<br>
popularity, is to continuously form and weld steel plate in a<br>
spiral fashion to create so-called "spiral-weld", or "spiral"<br>
pipe. In both cases welds project both above and into the pipe<br>
diameter.<br>
In the case of the present invention, the weld on the<br>
external surface of the pipe is the relevant one. The<br>
terminology used to describe the shape of a weld may be<br>
explained with reference to Fig. 1 and will be used<br>
hereinafter.  11 indicates the toe of the weld, 12 the crown<br>
and 13 an undercut.  14 indicates the height of the weld. The<br>
shape and height of the weld varies between the two methods<br>
(spiral and longseam), as well as from manufacturer to<br>
manufacturer. The ideal shape is one which makes a smooth<br>
transition from the body of the pipe, and which is not too<br>
high, as illustrated in Figure 2. However, this configuration<br>
is rarely achieved unless the weld seam is ground to shape. It<br>
is more common for the welds to assume the shapes shown in<br>
Figures 2 through 5 which illustrate a weld with square edges<br>
(Fig. 3), square edges with a slight undercut (Fig. 4), square<br><br>
edges with a severe undercut (Fig. 5) and a weld with severe<br>
undercuts both sides and a recess on top (Fig. 6).<br>
When the side-wrap coating procedure is used with pipe<br>
that has high raised weld beads or substantially square<br>
section weld beads on its outer circumference, it is often<br>
found that contact between the continuous sheet and parts of<br>
the weld bead, for example the concave toe and undercut<br>
portions 11 and 13, may be poor or non-existent, resulting in<br>
voids at the toe of the weld.  This is particularly<br>
accentuated if the weld profile is substantially square or<br>
undercut in the vicinity of the toe. With spirally-welded pipe<br>
it is typically still more difficult to obtain uniform<br>
coverage over the weld than it is with a "long seam" pipe<br>
having a single axially extending weld. There is a particular<br>
problem with "double-jointed" spiral-welded pipe, in which two<br>
lengths of pipe are welded together to form a longer pipe,<br>
because such pipes always contain at least one point at which<br>
two welds meet at a 90 degree angle to one another.<br>
Usually, the side wrapped sheet is provided from an<br>
extruder alongside the pipe coating line.  It is also possible<br>
to use a continuous sheet that is heated adjacent the pipe<br>
coating line to a temperature that will allow adhesion between<br>
the pipe and the sheet.  In known methods, water quenching is<br>
applied onto the outer polymer surface typically within one<br>
metre of the extrusion die or side wrapping station in order<br>
to solidify the polyolefin sufficiently to prevent damage<br>
during further handling, for example contact with conveying<br>
tires.  As the outer surface beings to cool, the polyolefin<br>
layer develops hoop stress around the pipe.  At the raised<br>
weld, this hoop stress attempts to pull the molten polymer<br>
into a tangential configuration, and this causes the thickness<br>
to decrease at the top of the weld.  Voids, separation of<br>
layers, or discontinuities may develop in the coating adjacent<br>
the concavely recessed neck portion, or pin holes or cavities<br><br>
may occur within the thickness of the coating material, with<br>
the result that the protective properties of the coating may<br>
be regarded as deficient or inadequate.<br>
In the present invention, there is provided an improved<br>
method of providing a coating on a pipe that has a weld bead<br>
on its outer circumference, with the weld bead projecting from<br>
the outer circumference of the pipe. In the present method, a<br>
curable resin polymer is applied to the pipe and the curable<br>
resin is permitted to bond to the pipe to form an cured or<br>
partially cured polymer layer on the pipe.  Preferably,<br>
immediately thereafter, and while the pipe is still hot, a<br>
powder form adhesive composition is applied to the pipe having<br>
the cured or partially cured polymer layer on it, under<br>
conditions allowing bonding of the adhesive composition to the<br>
curable polymer layer.  Preferably, immediately thereafter,<br>
and while the pipe is still hot, a powder form polyolefin is<br>
applied to the pipe, under conditions allowing bonding of said<br>
polyolefin to the adhesive composition. The polyolefin powder<br>
is allowed to bond to the adhesive composition layer and to<br>
fuse to form a polyolefin layer on the pipe.  The coating at<br>
this point will hereinafter be referred to as "powder-based<br>
polyolefin coating".<br>
At a stage following formation of the powder-based<br>
polyolefin coating, an outer polyolefin covering is applied on<br>
the pipe by side extrusion.  The outer polyolefin covering is<br>
bondable to the powder-based polyolefin coating, and is<br>
applied at a stage at which the pipe is sufficiently hot to<br>
permit bonding of the polyolefin covering.  The pipe having<br>
the outer polyolefin covering is then cooled to ambient<br>
temperature. Alternatively, the side-extruded polyolefin layer<br>
may be applied directly in line with the application of the<br>
powder-based polyolefin coating. In such case there is no need<br>
to add additional heat to the pipe between the application of<br><br>
the powder-based polyolefin coating and the application of the<br>
outer layer of side-extruded polyolefin.<br>
In all cases, the cooling of the pipe is done either<br>
entirely from the inside of the pipe, or by a combination in<br>
which the initial cooling is done from the inside of the pipe,<br>
and the external cooling follows only after the coating<br>
immediately adjacent to the pipe has been substantially<br>
cooled.<br>
Internal cooling is used to ensure that a coating<br>
immediately adjacent the pipe has been substantially cooled or<br>
solidified, for example the adhesive composition and at least<br>
part of the polyolefin powder-based coating have solidified,<br>
before the exterior of the coated pipe is exposed to rapid<br>
cooling. When a polyolefin goes from a melt state to a solid<br>
state, it typically undergoes a shrinkage of 10 to 20%. If the<br>
coating is cooled from the outside surface inwards, the<br>
solidified outer layer will exert a large stress tangential to<br>
the raised weld, which translates into a force normal to the<br>
any concave surfaces, such as at the toe of the weld. This is<br>
accentuated by the volumetric shrinkage of the molten material<br>
adjacent to the weld as it solidifies. By first solidifying<br>
the material at the pipe surface adjacent to the weld,<br>
sufficient strength is created to enable it to resist the<br>
forces normal to the surface attempting to pull it away and<br>
create voids and/or tears.<br>
At least preferred embodiments of the present invention<br>
overcome the above noted disadvantages of known processes.<br>
The application of a powder-based polyolefin coating layer<br>
adjacent to the toe of the weld results in a smoother<br>
transition between the weld bead and adjacent circumference of<br>
the pipe.  This smooth transition, together with the effects<br>
of the interior surface cooling of the pipe serve to<br>
consolidate the coating materials on the pipe surface,<br><br>
resulting in a more uniform coating thickness around the pipe<br>
and over the weld.  In'preferred forms, the difference in<br>
coating materials thickness between the top of the weld and<br>
the body of the pipe is minimal.  The coating conforms closely<br>
to the weld profile and there is no "weld tenting".  This<br>
result can be achieved with both long seam and spiral welded<br>
pipes.<br>
Interior surface cooling may, for example, be<br>
accomplished as described in Wong et al, U.S. patent<br>
6,270,847, the disclosures of which are hereby incorporated by<br>
reference.<br>
Various techniques may be used for providing the cured or<br>
partially cured polymer layer, and for applying the adhesive<br>
composition under conditions such that it bonds to the cured<br>
or partially cured polymer.<br>
In one preferred form, the curable resin polymer<br>
comprises epoxy resin.  Other curable resins suitable for<br>
application to pipe in a protective coating, and their methods<br>
of application and curing, are well known to those skilled in<br>
the art and need not be described in detail herein.  While,<br>
for the sake of simplicity, the following will refer to epoxy<br>
resin, it will be appreciated that the techniques described<br>
are applicable to other curable resin polymers.<br>
For example, epoxy resin may be applied in curable liquid<br>
form, using procedures as described in the above-mentioned<br>
U.S. Patent 5,026,451, the disclosures of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference.  In one form, the liquid<br>
coating is partially cured, for example to an incompletely-<br>
cured gel stage, preferably by heating the pipe under heating<br>
conditions well known to those skilled in the art.<br><br>
In a further example, epoxy resin may be applied in the<br>
forrr. of a preferably incompletely cured fusion bonded epoxy<br>
(FBE), as described in U.S. Patent 4,345,004 (Miyata et al),<br>
4,510,007 (Stucke) and U.S. Patent 5,178,902 (Wong et al)<br>
assigned to the present applicant, the disclosures of all of<br>
which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
In order to provide for bonding between the adhesive<br>
composition and the epoxy resin layer, the adhesive<br>
composition must contain chemical groups capable of bonding<br>
with, or preferably reacting with the epoxy composition, and<br>
must: also be capable of bonding to the polyolefin layer of the<br>
powder-based composite coating. Most commonly the adhesive<br>
composition will comprise a modified polyolefin, wherein the<br>
polyolefin contains functional groups that are reactive with<br>
the functional groups present in the epoxy.  Examples of such<br>
modified polyolefins are well known to those skilled in the<br>
art.  Common chemical groups incorporated into polyolefins to<br>
make them bondable to epoxies include those derived from co-<br>
or graft-copolymers of vinyl acetate, ethyl acrylate, methyl<br>
acrylate, and maleic acid. The polyolefin adhesive composition<br>
may consist of blends of functionalized and non-functionalized<br>
polyolefins. Numerous examples of modified polyolefins<br>
bondable to epoxy, and that may be employed in the present<br>
method, are described in more detail in the above-mentioned<br>
Wong et al '902 Miyata et al.  '004, and Stucke et al '007<br>
patents, as well as in Sakayori et al U.S. Re. 30,006, the<br>
disclosure of which is incorporated herein by reference.<br>
The copolymer adhesive is applied to the pipe in powder<br>
form while the pipe is hot. In one especially preferred form<br>
of the present invention, a copolymer adhesive is applied in<br>
accordance with the procedures described in the Wong et al<br>
'902 patent, wherein FBE and copolymer adhesive are co-sprayed<br>
onto the pipe and are allowed to fuse forming the interlayer<br>
consisting of interspersed and interlocked domain referred to<br><br>
above, such domains consisting respectively of epoxy and<br>
copolymer adhesive.  In such case, the epoxy reinforces the<br>
adhesive, and provides it with higher melt strength, thereby<br>
reducing any tendency for separation or discontinuities to<br>
occur in the coating layer.<br>
Adequate results can, however, be achieved by applying<br>
the copolymer adhesive as a discrete layer on the epoxy layer,<br>
provided that the copolymer adhesive has an adequate melt<br>
strength, the melt strength being indicative of the ability of<br>
the polymer to resist flow or movement at the temperatures at<br>
which the coating layers are subjected to stress during a<br>
cooling stage.  Polymers having high melt strength are<br>
indicated by a low melt flow index, which indicates a higher<br>
molecular weight for the polymer. Typically the higher the<br>
molecular weight the slower the rate of fusion into a<br>
continuous layer.<br>
Therefore, in such case the melt strength of the<br>
copolymer adhesive is desirably not excessively high, since<br>
this may give rise to problems of application since, at the<br>
temperature of application, the high melt strength copolymer<br>
adhesive may not flow adequately at the application<br>
temperature to provide the required coating conforming closely<br>
and continuously to the epoxy-coated pipe.<br>
In the practice of the present invention, one of ordinary<br>
skill in the art can readily determine by trial and error the<br>
copolymer adhesive melt strength properties necessary to<br>
achieve a coating free from separation of layers,<br>
discontinuities, pin holes, cavities or the like while<br>
providing adequate conformity of the copolymer adhesive layer<br>
to the pipe during application.<br>
As noted above, in preferred forms of the present<br>
invention, the polyolefin layer provides a smooth transition<br><br>
between the weld bead and the adjacent circumference or the<br>
pipe.  Such smooth transition preferably results from the<br>
polyolefin powder at least partially filling concave neck<br>
portions that are present at the lateral sides of the weld<br>
beads.  Preferably, the powder is electrostatically charged,<br>
and this may cause the powder to deposit preferentially at<br>
sharply radiused regions of the concave neck portions.  While<br>
the interface between the resulting polyolefin layer and the<br>
outer polyolefin covering in the coated pipe manufactured in<br>
accordance with the invention may, in cross-section, exhibit<br>
some degree of concavity, such concavity is desirably markedly<br>
less than the concavity exhibited at the interface between the<br>
epoxy layer and the metal of the pipe.  The difference in the<br>
two concavities may be quantified in terms of the respective<br>
radii of curvature.  Desirably, the radius of curvature of the<br>
interface between the polyolefin layer and the outer<br>
polyolefin covering is at least 10 times, more preferably 20<br>
times, and still more preferably at least 50 times the: radius<br>
of curvature of the concavity existing at the neck portion at<br>
. the lateral sides of the weld bead.<br>
In preferred forms of the invention, the smooth<br>
transition is achieved by application of the powder form<br>
polyolefin in thickness that is significantly greater than the<br>
combined thickness of fusion bond epoxy and copolymer adhesive<br>
that is applied, hereinafter referred to as the "underlying<br>
layer".  While the thicknesses of the individual layers that<br>
are desired to be applied tend to vary according to the<br>
dimensions of the pipe, a comparison can be made between the<br>
relative thicknesses of the powder-based polyolefin coating<br>
and of the underlying layer in a given coated pipe.  The<br>
thicknesses referred to are those of the layers as applied on<br>
the smoothly curved portion of the circumference of the pipe.<br>
In preferred forms of the present invention, the thickness of<br>
the powder-based polyolefin coating is approximately 0.5 tiraes<br>
to about 5 times that of the underlying layer<br><br>
In practice, it has been found that application of the<br>
powder-based polyolefin in a thickness less than about 0.5<br>
tines that of the underlying layer may tend to result in an<br>
increased incidence of insufficient filling of the concave<br>
portions adjacent the weld neck, with the result that the<br>
above noted problems of separation of layers, formatisn of<br>
discontinuities, pin holes or cavities may arise.  It is found<br>
that increasing the thickness of the powder-based polyolefin<br>
coating beyond about 5.0 times the thickness of the underlying<br>
layer results in little improvement in the quality of the<br>
coating layers of the product, while increasing the costs of<br>
the coating operation.<br>
More preferably, the powder-based polyolefin coating is<br>
about 1.0 to 4.0 times thicker than the underlying layer, and<br>
still more preferably about 1.2 to about 2.0 times thicker.<br>
In one preferred form of the present invention, steps of<br>
application of the epoxy resin, copolymer adhesive when<br>
employed, powder form polyolefin and outer polyolefin covering<br>
are conducted while the pipe is at a temperature of from about<br>
180 to 240°C.<br>
In some circumstances, it may be considered desirable to<br>
apply the outer polyolefin covering at a substantially lower<br>
temperature.  In a further preferred form of the present<br>
invention, this can be accomplished by a procedure wherein,<br>
following the application of the powder form polyolefin, the<br>
pipe is cooled by applying cooling medium to an interior<br>
surface of the pipe until the polyolefin layer has solidified,<br>
for example as described in the Wong et al '847 patent.  At<br>
that time, external cooling, for example quenching the<br>
exterior surface of the coated pipe with water may be used to<br>
further assist the cooling process.<br><br>
The coated pipe is then loaded onto a coating line, and<br>
the: steel or other metal of the pipe is induction heated, for<br>
example to about 90°C.  The preheated pipe is then passed<br>
through an infrared heating oven wherein the polyolefin<br>
coating is heated to a temperature between 110°C to 160°C,<br>
preferably 130°C plus or minus 10°C.  In some circumstances,<br>
it may be possible to reduce or eliminate the induction<br>
heating, and to rely on infrared heating solely.<br>
The outer polyolefin covering may then be applied by side<br>
wrapping an extruded sheet of polyolefin onto the preheated<br>
coating to the desired thickness.  Typically, the thickness of<br>
the side wrapped coating ranges from about 1 mm to 5 mm.<br>
Water quenching is applied on the outer polymer surface,<br>
typically within 2 m of the extrusion die, to solidify the<br>
polyolefin sufficiently to allow contact with handling<br>
apparatus such as conveying tires.<br>
While in a preferred form the outer polyolefin covering<br>
is applied by a side wrapping method, it is also possible to<br>
apply the outer polyolefin covering by a cross head extrusion<br>
method.  Such cross head extrusion, together with application<br>
of copolymer adhesive, is described in U.S. Patent 5,026,451<br>
(Trzecieski et al), assigned to the present applicant, the<br>
disclosures of which are incorporated herein by reference.<br>
Side wrapping may be accomplished using the techniques<br>
well known to those skilled in the art and as generally<br>
described in U.S. Patent 4,510,007 (Stucke), incorporated<br>
herein by reference.<br>

shows a conventional pipe coating method.  A pipe 21 is spun<br>
around its axis as it is fed forwardly through the coating<br>
line, in a sense of rotation indicated by the arrow 22, in the<br>
conventional manner.<br>
A.	Optionally, the pipe is prepared to accept the subsequent<br>
coating, typically comprising washing, to remove loose<br>
contaminants such as mud, ice, etc., preheating to a minimum<br>
temperature of 3°C above the dew point, and more typically to<br>
a temperature between 40 and 70°C, and abrasive blasting, to<br>
remove rust and mill scale and establish a surface profile,<br>
and<br>
B.	Optional additional surface treatments such as phosphoric<br>
acid wash, chromate, etc., may be employed.<br>
C.	The pipe is preheated to a FBE (fusion bond epoxy)<br>
application temperature, typically in the range 200 to 240°C<br>
cr, in some instances, 180 to 250°C.  Usually, such preheating<br>
is conducted by passing the pipe 21 through an induction<br>
heating coil or a tunnel oven.<br>
D.	The preheated pipe is conveyed through an FBE applicator<br>
device 23, wherein electrostatically charged fusion bonded<br>
epoxy powder is applied onto the hot pipe.  The powder fuses<br>
and bonds to the hot pipe on contact.  Typically, the<br>
thickness of the fusion bond epoxy layer that is built up on<br>
the pipe ranges from about 100 m to 300 urn.<br>
Examples of fusion bond epoxy powders that may be<br>
employed include the following:<br>
Scotchkote 6233 (trade-mark) available from 3M, Morden,<br>
Manitoba Canada;<br><br>
Scotchkote 626 available from 3M, Austin, Texas, U.S.A.;<br>
Napguard 7-2514 FG, Napguard 7-2501 and Napguard 7-2500,<br>
all available from DuPont Powder Coatings, Houston, Texas,<br>
U.S.A.;<br>
EP-2004 and EPF 1011 available from Jotun, United Arab<br>
Emirates; and<br>
Resicoat R5-726 available from AKZO NOBEL, Germany.<br>
E.   Immediately following the FBE application, the pipe is<br>
conveyed through an adhesive powder applicator 2 4 which<br>
applies a copolymer adhesive powder on the hot pipe, the<br>
copolymer adhesive powder immediately fusing to the hot epoxy<br>
to form a copolymer adhesive layer on the fusion bond epoxy.<br>
The thickness of the layer that is built up typically ranges<br>
from 100 urn to 250 urn.<br>
The copolymer adhesive that is used depends on the outer<br>
covering that is subsequently applied on the copolymer<br>
adhesive.  In the case in which the outer covering is<br>
polyethylene, the following polyethylene based adhesives may<br>
for example be employed.<br>
Fusabond EMB500DG (powder) available from Dupont, Sarnia,<br>
Ontario, Canada;<br>
Lotader 2100 available from Arkema, France; and<br>
Lucalen G3510H available from Basell, Germany.<br>
In the case in which the outer covering is to be<br>
polypropylene, a polypropylene based adhesive may for example<br>
be employed, such as the following:<br><br>
Fusabond PMD4310D available from DuPont, Sarnia, Ontario,<br>
Canada;<br>
Hifax EP2015 available from Basell, Italy;<br>
Orevac 18732P available from Arkema, France; and<br>
Borcoat 127E available from Borealis, Finland.<br>
F.   Immediately following the adhesive application,<br>
polyolefin (for example polyethylene or polypropylene) is<br>
applied by side wrapping an extruded sheet of molten polymer<br>
in multiple overlaps from sheet extruders, schematically<br>
indicated at 2 6 in Figure 7, in order to achieve the desired<br>
thickness of outer covering.  Typically the thickness ranges<br>
from about 1 mm to 6 mm for stand alone anticorrosion<br>
coatings, but may be substantially thicker when the coating is<br>
a component of a thermally insulating coating system.<br>
The extruded material 31 may, for example, comprise, in<br>
the case in which the material 31 is polyethylene:<br>
Sclair 35BP and Sclair HEY449A, both available from Nova<br>
Chemicals, Moore, Ontario, Canada;<br>
Lupolen 4552D available from Basell, Germany;<br>
Innovene available from BP, Houston, Texas, United States<br>
of America.<br>
In the case in which the extruded material 31 comprises<br>
polypropylene, the following are examples of polypropylene<br>
compositions that may be employed:<br>
BB108E available from Borealis, Finland;<br><br>
Moplen Coat EP Bianco and Profax 7823, both available<br>
from Basell, Italy; and<br>
Hostalen PP H2483, available from Hoechst, Germany.<br>
G.   Silicone rcllers, applied on the outer side of the<br>
extruded sheet, and biased toward the pipe, are used to apply<br>
pressure on the molten extruded sheet to improve contact<br>
between the polyolefin layer and the adhesive, between the<br>
polyolefin sheet overlaps, and to improve conformance of the<br>
molten polymer to surface irregularities such as raised welds.<br>
H.   Following the side wrapping, water quenching is applied<br>
on the outer polymer surface from water spraying devices 27,<br>
typically within one metre of the extrusion die, to solidify<br>
the polyolefin sufficiently to allow contact with the<br>
conveying apparatus, such as conveying tires.<br>
I.   The coated pipe 28 exits the coating line.<br>
Figure 8 shows the action of a silicone roller 29 in<br>
applying pressure to the extruded sheet 31 adjacent a weld<br>
bead 32 on the pipe 21.<br>
As can be seen, the advancing weld bead 32 impacts the<br>
lower surface of the molten sheet 31 and pushes up into it.<br>
As shown in Fig. 9, the roller 29, biased toward the pipe<br>
.21 pushes the extruded material 31 toward and into the<br>
advancing weld bead 32.<br>
As shown in Fig. 10, at a subsequent stage, the roller<br>
29, jumps up onto the weld bead 32, and, as a result of the<br>
reaction of the roller biasing means to the abrupt transition<br>
from the side of the weld bead to the top of the weld bead 32,<br>
tends to impact the top of the weld bead 32, tending to cause<br><br>
thinning of the extruded sheet 31 in the region indicated at<br>
31a in Fig. 10.<br>
As the roller 29 passes over the weld bead and over the<br>
neck portion 32a of the weld bead 32 on the right hand side of<br>
the weld bead 32 as seen in Fig. 11, the frictional engagement<br>
of the roller 29 with the extruded sheet 31 tends to drag the<br>
extruded material 31 away from the receding weld bead 32 and<br>
the roller 29 is ineffective to form the polymer sheet into<br>
the neck portion 32a of the weld.<br>
Further, during the cooling phase, defects tend to arise<br>
within the coating layers, to be described in more detail<br>
later, in connection with Figs. 16 and 17.<br>
Figs. 12 and 13 show one example of a coating method in<br>
accordance with the present invention, conducted in two<br>
stages.<br>
In the method illustrated, the initial steps are, the same<br>
as steps A to C described above with reference to Fig. 7.<br>
J.   Electrostatic spray application of FBE is conducted from<br>
a spray applicator 33, to provide a coating of FBE of<br>
thickness typically in the range of 150 m to 300 m.  The FBE<br>
may, for example, be any of those listed in step D above.<br>
K.  Immediately following the FBE application, an adhesive<br>
interlayer containing interspersed and interlocked domains of<br>
epoxy and copolymer is applied by mixed electrostatic: spraying<br>
of FBE from applicator 34 and electrostatically charged<br>
copolymer adhesive powder from applicators 3 6 and 37, so that<br>
the proportions vary along the line, being higher in epoxy<br>
content at the FBE layer and higher in copolymer adhesive<br>
content at the outer portion of the layer.  The typical total<br>
thickness applied from applicators 34 to 37 is about 110 to<br><br>
about 150 m.  The copolymer adhesive may, for example, be as<br>
described in step E above.<br>
L.   Immediately following the adhesive application,<br>
electrostatically charged polyolefin powder is applied by<br>
spraying, for example from sprays 38 to 41, or by dropping the<br>
electrostatically charged powder from vibrating pans to<br>
control the amount of powder deposited.  The poiyolefin powder<br>
may, for example, be as discussed in step F above.<br>
The charged poiyolefin powder fills the concave weld neck<br>
portions, and melt fuses to form a continuous poiyolefin<br>
layer, typically of a thickness of approximately 350 m to<br>
1100 m.<br>
The total thickness of the layers applied on the pipe up<br>
to this stage typically range from about 750 m to 1500 m.<br>
M.   Once the pclyolefin layer -has completely fused, the pipe<br>
is internally cooled using, for example, the technique<br>
described in Wong et al '847 patent.  The cooling medium,<br>
usually water, is supplied through a lance .42, inserted in the<br>
pipe 21, and providing a spray on the internal surface of the<br>
pipe at the region indicated at ID in Fig. 12.  The internal<br>
cooling solidifies the poiyolefin layer before it reaches the<br>
handling support such as conveyor tires.<br>
N.   Following the solidification of the poiyolefin layer,<br>
external cooling from water sprays 43 is applied to further<br>
assist the cooling process.<br>
A holiday free coating is obtained with excellent<br>
coverage adjacent the raised weld bead.  The weld neck areas<br>
are filled with the poiyolefin layer to form a smooth<br>
transition between the pipe body and the raised weld bead.<br><br>
O.   The coated pipe 44, as seen in Fig. 13 is loaded onto a<br>
coating line, and. the steel temperature of the pipe is<br>
induction heated to about 90°C.  In one form, the preheated<br>
pipe is passed through an infrared oven 46 where the<br>
polyolefin coating is heated to a temperature between 110°C to<br>
16C)°C, preferably 130 plus or minus 10°C.  In a further form,<br>
it may be possible to reduce or eliminate the induction<br>
heating using a more highly effective infrared heating device.<br>
P.   An outer covering of polyolefin is applied by side<br>
wrapping an extruded sheet of polyolefin 48 onto the preheated<br>
coating, using an extruder 47.  The thickness of the side<br>
wrapped coating typically ranges from about 1 mm to 5 mm.  The<br>
polyolefin may, for example, be as discussed in step F above.<br>
Q.   Silicone rollers, for example as shown in Figs. 8 to 11<br>
are typically used to apply pressure on the extruded sheet 48<br>
to improve contact between the polyolefin layer and the outer<br>
polyolefin covering and between the polyolefin over wraps, and<br>
to conform the polyolefin over wraps to surface irregularities<br>
such as raised weld beads.<br>
R.   Water quenching is applied on the outer polyolefin<br>
covering from water sprays 49, typically within one metre of<br>
the extrusion die, in order to solidify the outer polyolefin<br>
covering sufficiently to allow contact with conveying tires or<br>
like handling supports, whereafter the pipe is allowed to cool<br>
to ambient temperature.  In this instance, the coating may be<br>
cooled with external cooling only, although it may also be<br>
advantageous to use the combined internal and external cooling<br>
procedure described in paragraph "M", above if the pipe<br>
temperature is very high.<br>
The resulting coating has substantially uniform thickness<br>
around the pipe.  The difference in coating thickness between<br>
the top of the weld and the body portion is minimal.  The<br><br>
coating conforms to the weld profile, and there is no "weld<br>
tenting".  It is found that this applies to both long seam and<br>
spiral welded pipes.<br>
Fig. 14 shows one example of a further form of coating<br>
method in accordance with the present invention, conducted in<br>
a single stage.<br>
In the method illustrated in Fig. 14, the initial steps<br>
are the same as steps A to C described above with reference to<br>
Fig. 7, and steps J and L described above with reference to<br>
Fig. 12.<br>
S.   When the polyolefin powder, for example as applied from<br>
sprays 38, 39 and 41 begins to melt fuse, a layer of<br>
polyolefin 48 is applied on top of the coating by side<br>
wrapping a sheet extruded from extruder 47, of molten polymer,<br>
to the desired thickness.  The typical thickness of the outer<br>
polyolefin covering ranges from about 1 mm to about 5 mm.  The<br>
polyolefin may, for example, be as discussed in step F above.<br>
T.   As before, silicone rollers may be applied to apply<br>
pressure to the extruded sheet to improve contact between the<br>
outer polyolefin covering and the powder-based polyolefin<br>
coating, between the polyolefin outer covering overlaps, and<br>
to conform the outer polyolefin covering to surface<br>
irregularities such as raised welds.<br>
U.   The pipe is internally cooled at the region indicated ID<br>
in Fig. 14 using cooling medium supplied from a lance 42, as<br>
described above.  The internal cooling is applied such that<br>
the outer polyolefin covering has solidified before it reaches<br>
the conveyor tires or like support apparatus.  At that time,<br>
external cooling from water sprays 49 may be used to assist<br>
the cooling process.<br><br>
With the methods described in connection with Figs. 12<br>
and 13, as well as Fig. 14, the combination of epoxy<br>
reinforcing of the copolymer adhesive, imparting a much higher<br>
melt strength, the filling of concave neck portions with<br>
powder polyolefin, and the provision of a smooth transition<br>
around the weld neck portions, as well as the effects of<br>
internal surface cooling, serving to consolidate the materials<br>
around the pipe surface, contribute to achieving superior<br>
qualities of the coating and a uniform coating thickness<br>
around the entire pipe, including the weld bead portion.  The<br>
difference in thickness between the top of the weld bead and<br>
the body of the pipe is minimal.  The coating conforms to the<br>
weld bead profile, and there is no "weld tenting".  This<br>
applies to both long seam and spiral welded pipes.<br>
Comparative Example 1<br>
A pipe coating method was conducted as described with<br>
reference to Figs. 7 to 11.<br>
The conditions are as indicated in Table 1 below.<br><br>
Figs. 15 and 16 show a photomicrographic cross-sections<br>
through a coating achieved with the process described in<br>
comparative Example 1.<br><br>
In Fig. 15, it will be seen that there is a large<br>
discrepancy in the thickness  over the weld bead as compared<br>
with the thickness 2 over the body of the pipe, and there is<br>
disbondment at region 51 between the FBE layer 52 and the<br>
steel 53.<br>
At region 54, there is separation of the layers at or<br>
close to the interface between the adhesive 52a and the outer<br>
polyolefin covering 56.<br>
In Fig. 16, at region 57, there is a large gap or opening<br>
between the layers, apparently between the copolymer adhesive<br>
layer 52a and the polyethylene 56.<br>
Example 1<br>
A coating method was conducted following the procedure<br>
described above in detail with reference to Fig. 12 and 13.<br>
The conditions indicated in Table 2 below were employed.<br><br>
Fig. 17 is a photomicrographic cross-section through the<br>
coating that is achieved.<br>
There is minimal difference in the thicknesses 3 and 4<br>
of the coating over the top of the weld bead and over the body<br>
of the pipe, respectively.  There is no disbondment of the FBE<br>
52 from the steel 53, and there is no separation of any layer<br><br>
from an adjacent layer or any discontinuity whatsoever in the<br>
coating.<br>
It will be noted that the interface 58 between the<br>
polyolefin layer 59 and the outer polyolefin covering 61<br>
provides a substantially smooth transition between the body of<br>
the pipe and the top of the weld bead.  The radius of<br>
curvature of this interface is very large, and is greatly in<br>
excess of the radius of curvature at the sharply arcuately<br>
concave neck portion 62 between the weld bead and the surface<br>
of the body of the pipe.<br>

procedure described in more detail above with reference to<br>
Fig. 14 of the drawings.<br>
