				<td>SPECIFICATION<br>
Threading Apparatus and Threading Method in a Textile Machine<br>
Technical Field to which the Invention Relates<br>
The present invention relates to a threading apparatus and a threading method in a textile machine.  More specifically, the present invention relates to a threading apparatus and a threading method by which threading operation from a twisting device to a winding device can be done easily in, a" textile machine, such as a draw false-twist texturing machine.<br>
Background Art<br>
In a false-twist texturing machine or a draw false-twist texturing-machine, a yarn supplied from a supply package on a creel is fed by means of a first feed roller, while twists imparted by a twisting, device disposed downstream and run back along the yarn are heat set by means of a first heater disposed between the first feed roller and the twisting device, and the yarn is cooled at a stabilizing zone locating downstream of the first heater and is detwisted at the twisting device, and then the yarn is fed by means of a second feed roller and is wounded.  In many cases, leaving the second roller, the yarn passes through a second heater and, if desired, through a third feed roller, and it is fed to the winding device.<br>
In such a false-twist texturing machine or a draw false-twist texturing machine, known is a textile machine comprising: a main frame provided with twisting devices and second heaters; a winding frame provided with winding devices facing and spacing from the main frame; and an operator's aisle disposed between the main frame and the winding frame.  The yarn leaving the second heater passes beneath the operator's aisle and is fed to the winding device.<br>
*"*  -L  ™~<br><br>
- 2 -<br>
When such a construction as described above wherein an operator's aisle is disposed between the main frame and the winding frame is used, a so called individual doffing mechanism by which doffing operation from the winding parts of the winding frame is done for individual spindles can be readily disposed, and thus, while the threading operation can be done at the side facing the operator's aisle, the fully wound packages can be doffed from the side opposite to the operator's aisle.<br>
Further, when the first heater is a heater which can be heated to a high temperature higher than 400 °C, since the heater length of the first heater can be relatively shortened, the yarn passage in the heating zone can be brought into a condition like a straight line by the application of such a separate construction of the main frame and the winding frame, and run back of twists imparted by the twisting device can be done effectively, and thus, quality of the false-twist textured yarn which will be obtained can be good.<br>
In addition, when the second heater is a heater which can be heated to a high temperature between 250 and 600 °C, all of the twisting device, the feed rollers, and the second heater can be disposed in such a region that they can be serviced by an operator standing at the operator's aisle, and the winding devices on the winding frame can also be located in such a region that they can be serviced by an operator standing at the operator's aisle, and thus, the operator can readily perform operations, such as a threading operation without using a step.<br>
As described above, many advantages can be achieved by the arrangement wherein the main frame is provided with the twisting devices and second heaters, the winding frame is provided with the winding devices, and the operator's aisle is disposed between the frames.  However, the most serious problem inherent to this arrangement is that the operator<br>
- 2 -<br><br>
- 3 -<br>
has to bend for threading operation since the yarn from the main frame to the winding frame passes beneath the floor disposed at the operator's aisle.<br>
Taking the problem inherent to such a conventional apparatus into consideration, it is an object of the present invention to provide an apparatus and method for threading a yarn onto a textile machine, especially false-twist texturing machine or draw false-twist texturing machine, by which an operator can perform threading operation around the operator's aisle without bending.<br>
It is another object of the present invention to provide a threading apparatus by which threading operation onto a second heater heated at a temperature of between 250 and 600 °C without encountering any substantial problems.<br>
Further, it is a still other object of the present invention to provide a threading apparatus by which threading operation onto a winding device can be done very easily.<br>

It has been conventionally and partially done to thread a yarn into a heater formed in a completely tubular shape by means of a suction, for example, U. S . Patent No. 3,999,360.  However, when a yarn is threaded in such a heater with a completely tubular shape, if the threading operation is performed under the condition wherein the yarn is not forwarded while the heater is heated to a high temperature, yarn breakage occurs readily and threading operation fails.  Accordingly, threading operation onto such a conventionally known heater having tubular shape can be carried out only when the temperature of the heater is relatively low.<br>
Conventionally, a threading apparatus using suction has been known, for example French Patent Application Laid-open No. 2,695,631.  However, such.an apparatus has not been used to thread a yarn beneath the threading aisle formed between the main frame and the winding frame.<br>

Best Mode for Carrying out the Invention<br>
Fig. 1 is a diagrammatical elevation showing a half part of an embodiment of the draw false-twist texturing machine according to the present invention, and at the right portion of Fig. 1, a main frame 20 having twisting devices 5<br>
- 10 -<br><br>
- 1 1 -<br>
and second heaters 13 mounted thereon is illustrated, and a winding frame 22 having a plurality of winding devices 10 in a vertically multi-stages, three stages in this embodiment, is disposed spacing from the main frame 20, and an operator's aisle 21 is formed between the main frame and the winding frame 22.  A creel frame 23 having a plurality of supply packages 1 mounted thereon is disposed at the left of the winding frame 22.<br>
The winding frame 22 has first yarn feed roller devices 2, each comprising a pair of rollers 2a and 2b, mounted at the upper portion thereof.  First heaters 3 inclined over the operator's-aisle 21 formed between the main frame 20 and the winding frame 22, and stabilizing tracks 4 are disposed downstream of the first heaters 3.<br>
The main frame 20 has second yarn feed roller devices 6, each comprising a pair of rollers 6a and 6b, mounted thereon between the twisting devices 5 and the second heaters 13.  The first yarn feed roller device 2 and the second yarn feed roller device 5 are so set that they have peripheral speeds at a predetermined ratio therebetween, and a yarn Y is drawn at the predetermined ratio between the first yarn feed roller device 2 and the second yarn feed roller device 5.<br>
The twisting device 5 mounted on the main frame 20 may be a conventionally known twisting device, such as of a friction belt type, a friction disk type, or a false-twisting spindle type, and impart twists to the yarn Y.  In this embodiment, a third feed roller device 6' comprising a pair of rollers 6'a and 6'b is also disposed below the second feed roller device 6, however, if it is not required, the third feed'roller device may be omitted.<br>
Beneath the operator's aisle 21 formed between the main frame 20 and the winding frame 22, a fourth feed roller device 7 comprising a pair of rollers 7a and 7b (Fig. 2) is<br>
- 11 -<br><br>
- 12 -disposed.<br>
The winding device 10 mounted on the winding frame 22 comprises: a traverse device 8 which comprises a fulcrum of the traverse motion and a traverse guide and which traverse a yarn Y to and fro; a-bobbin, holder onto which a yarn winding bobbin is inserted; ,and a friction roller 9 which is pressed to the bobbin or the yarn wound on the bobbin.  Each winding device 10 is provided with an individual doffing device 60 for doffing a wound package.  Accordingly, a fully wound package is automatically doffed at each operating station, and is transferred to a side opposite to the operator's aisle, and then an empty bobbin is donned onto the bobbin holder.<br>
Under normal operating conditions, a yarn Y is withdrawn by means of the first yarn feed roller device 2 from a supply package 1 mounted on the creel frame 23, and while the yarn Y is drawn at a predetermined draw ratio between the first and second yarn feed devices 2 and 6, twists are imparted to the yarn Y by the twisting device 5.  The draw false-twist texturing machine according to the present invention may be of a type wherein a yarn may be false-twisted after it is drawn in stead of a type wherein a yarn is simultaneously drawn and false-twisted.<br>
Twists imparted to the yarn Y by means of the twisting device 5 run back along the yarn Y towards the first yarn feed device 2.  The twists run back along the yarn Y are heat set at the first heater 3, and the yarn Y is cooled at the stabilizing track 4 disposed downstream of the first heater 3.<br>
Thus, between the first yarn feed roller device 2 and the second yarn feed roller device 6, false-twists are imparted to the yarn Y upstream of the twisting device 5, and the yarn Y which has been fully cooled at the stabilizing track 4 enters into the twisting device 5.  The yarn Y<br>
- 12 -<br><br>
- 13 -<br>
leaving the twisting device 5 is detwisted, and crimps of the yarn Y are adjusted at the second heater 13 disposed below the twisting device 5.  The yarn Y is forwarded from the second feed roller device 6 under the operator's aisle 21, and then it is fed to the winding device 10 mounted on the winding frame 22 through the fourth yarn feed roller device 7.<br>
At the winding device 10, the yarn Y is wound on the bobbin to form a package, the fully wound package at each winding station is automatically doffed by means of the individual doffing apparatus 60, and then an empty bobbin is donned.<br>
The second heater 13 according to the present invention and the threading device for threading therein will now be explained.  The second heater 13 according to the present invention is a non-contact type high temperature heater which can be heated to a temperature of between 250 and 600 °C.  No-contact type means that a yarn does not substantially contact with the wall while it runs therein, however, if it is required, yarn guides may be disposed at a predetermined pitch.<br>
Figs. 3 and 4 show an embodiment of the second heater 13, wherein Fig. 3 is a side view of the second heater, Fig. 4(a) is a plan view of the second heater illustrated in Fig. 3, Fig. 4(b) is a cross sectional view taken along line B-B in Fig. 3, and Fig. 4(c) is an enlarged plan view of a yarn guide pipe member 34.<br>
In the non-contact type high temperature second heater 13 of this embodiment, two yarns Y are heated, and as illustrated in Fig. 4(b)', a heater block 13c which is heated by sheath heaters 13b has two yarn passages and threading slits 13a extending along the yarn running direction and formed between the yarn passages and outside.  Further, as illustrated in Fig. 4(a), the second heater 13 has at the<br>
- 13 -<br><br>
- 14 -<br>
top surface thereof an upper yarn guide plate 13e having guide grooves 13 formed at positions corresponding to the threading slits 13a.  Thus, a yarn Y can be threaded onto the second heater 13 through the threading slit 13a.<br>
When a yarn Y which is not in a running condition is threaded onto the second heater 13 which is heated at a high temperature, yarn breakage may easily occur since the second heater is heated at an extremely high temperature.  Thus, it is necessary to thread onto the high temperature second heater 13 after the yarn reaches a predetermined speed.  For such purpose, the high temperature second heater 13 of this embodiment has threading slit 13a.<br>
A guide member 33 which guides a yarn Y upon threading operation is disposed adjacent to the threading slit 13a of the second heater 13.  The guide member 33 of this embodiment is a guide pipe member 34 which has a spiral cross section as illustrated in Fig. 4(c), and a part of the guide pipe member 34 formed in a spiral cross section forms a slit 34a for removing the yarn Y therethrough.  The directions of a pair of spirals are opposite , i.e., one in a clock-wise and the other in a counter-clockwise, and the yarn removing slits 34 are facing the center of the yarn passages formed by a pair of the guide members 34.  The yarn removing slit 34a extends along a yarn passage.<br>
At a position downstream of the heat treating apparatus, i.e., the second heater 13, disposed is a member which engages with the yarn Y running inside of the guide pipe member 34 so as to disengage the yarn Y from the guide pipe member 34 through the yarn removing slit 34a, and which then threads the yarn Y onto the heat treating apparatus, i.e., the second heater 13, through the threading slit 13a.<br>
More specifically, as illustrated in Fig. 5, a yarn removing lever 36 is disposed swingably about a pin 36a at a position downstream of the second heater 13, the yarn<br>
- 14 -<br><br>

removing lever 36 is swung about the pin 36a by means of a pneumatic cylinder 35.  Accordingly, a yarn guide 36b attached at an end of the yarn removing lever 36 opposite to the pin 3 6a engages with the yarn Y running inside of the guide pipe member 34 and it pushes the yarn Y to the outside through the yarn removing slit 34a while it holds the yarn Y at the hooked portion thereof.  Then, the yarn guide 36b of the yarn removing lever 36 threads the yarn into the second heater 13.  An outlet guide 13f disposed at the outlet portion of the second heater 13 has a hole 13g formed in a spade shape as illustrated in Fig. 5.  The yarn Y which has been pushed out from the yarn guide member 34 due to the swinging operation of the yarn guide 36b is moved from the central portion of the spade shaped hole 13g to either one of the side portions of the spade shaped hole 13g as the yarn guide 36b swings to a position illustrated by a broken line.  Thereafter, the yarn guide 36b returns to the original position.  As a result, the yarn Y is held within the spade shaped hole I3g due to tension in the yarn Y*<br>
As illustrated in Fig. 2, a yarn guide pipe 41 is disposed beneath the operator's aisle 21 formed between the main frame 20 and the winding frame 22.  The yarn guide pipe 41 has a yarn feed nozzle 41b mounted at the base portion, i.e., the right portion in Figs. 1, 2 and 6, thereof, and a front end of the yarn guide pipe 41 is formed in a double tube.  The yarn feed nozzle 41b may be of a conventionally known suction type.  The front part 41a of the double tube can be extended and retracted by means of an actuator 43 (see Fig. 7) such as a pneumatic cylinder which surrounds the front part 41a.  Although under the normal operational conditions, the length of the yarn guide 41 is that between the main frame 20 and a position near the fourth yarn feed roller device 7, under the threading operational conditions, the front end 41a locating near the fourth yarn feed roller device 7 can be extended over the position where the fourth yarn feed roller device 7 is disposed toward a position near the entrance of the winding frame 22.<br>

A pressing roller 7a of the fourth yarn feed roller 7 locates at a position illustrated in a solid line in Fig. 2 under the normal operational conditions, however, under the threading operational conditions, since the yarn guide pipe 41 extends, the pressing roller 7a of the fourth yarn feed roller 7 moves to a stand-by position illustrated by a broken line in Fig. 2 so that it does not disturb the extension.<br>
More specifically, as illustrated in Figs. 2 and 6, an arm 45 having the pressing roller 7a of the fourth yarn feed roller device 7 rotatably mounted thereon is swingably pivoted around a pin 45a, and the pressing roller mounting arm 45 is connected by means of a pin to a rod 4 2a of an actuator 42 (see Fig. 6) which operates substantially in synchronism with the above-described actuator 43 (see Fig. 7) for operating the yarn guide pipe 41.  Because of this construction, the movement to the stand-by position and returning movement from the stand-by position to the original position of the pressing roller 7a of the fourth yarn feed roller device 7a are performed by the actuators 4 2 and 43 simultaneous with and synchronism with the extension and retraction of the yarn guide pipe 41.<br>
Further, yarn feed tube 51 provided with a yarn feed nozzle 51a mounted therein is disposed between the lower portion of the winding frame 22 to the winding device 10. The yarn feed nozzle 51a may be of a conventionally known suction type.  The yarn feed tube 51 is a part of the threading device for threading a yarn onto the winding device 10.  The threading device for threading a yarn Y onto the winding device 10 will now be explained with reference to Figs. 9 and 10.<br>
As illustrated in Figs. 1 and 2, the winding frame 22 has winding devices 10 vertically disposed in three stages. As illustrated in Fig. 10 , wherein suffix 1 denotes the lower stage, suffix 2 denotes the middle stage and suffix 3<br>
- 16 -<br><br>
- 17 -<br>
denotes the upper stage, three yarn feed nozzles 51a which Individually forward the yarns Y to the winding devices 10 disposed on the corresponding stages are disposed in parallel on a substantially horizontal line at a lower position of the winding device 10 disposed on the lower stage.  Among the three yarn feed nozzles 51a, the yarn feed nozzle 51a2 which is disposed at the left in Fig. 10 forwards the yarn Y to the winding device 102 disposed on the middle stage, the yarn feed nozzle 51ai which is disposed at the center forwards the yarn Y to the winding device 10i disposed on the lower stage, and the yarn feed nozzle 5la3 which is disposed at the right forwards the yarn Y to the winding device IO3 disposed on the upper stage.  The yarn feed tubes 51 (51i, 512 and 5I3) extend from the corresponding yarn feed nozzles 51a (51a]_, 51a2 and 51a3) to the lower positions in front of the corresponding winding devices 10 (10i, IO2 and IO3).  The front ends 51b (51bi, 51b2 and 51b3) of the yarn feed tubes 51 (51i, 512 and 5I3) are positioned at the fulcrums of the corresponding traverse . devices 8 of the winding devices 10 so that the traverse motion of the yarn after threading operation is controlled.<br>
Fig. 9 shows a threading device for threading onto a winding device 10 located on the lower stage.  A guide member 61 extends between the front end 51b of the yarn feed tube 51 and a position in front of the winding device 10. Further, a yarn guide bar 62 extends in a traversing direction, i.e., a direction perpendicular to the sheet on which Fig. 9 is drawn and a direction parallel to the sheet on which Fig. 9 is drawn, of the traverse device 8 of the winding device 10 at a position between the guide member 61 and the winding device 10.<br>
In Fig. 9, the guide member 61 is provided with a bottom surface 61a and side walls 61b projecting from the sides of the bottom surface 61a.  The bottom surface 61a is upwardly inclined substantially along a straight line from the front end 51b of the yarn feed tube 51 to the right of<br>
- 17 -<br><br>
- 18 -<br>
the yarn guide bar 6 2, and an end 61c, i.e., the upper end in Fig. 9, opposite to the end facing the yarn feed tube 51 and extending across the yarn guide bar 62 is smoothly curved along an arc towards the winding device 10, and its end 61d arrives at the left of the yarn guide bar 62, and thus, the bottom surface 61a as a whole provides a reverse J-shaped cross section.  The side walls 61b project from the sides of the bottom surface 61a toward the winding device 10.  Thus, the guide member 61 has a U-shaped cross section as illustrated in Fig. 9(b).  The height of the side walls 61b of the guide member 61 increases from the end 51b facing the yarn feed nozzle 51a of the yarn feed tube 51 to the other end 61c opposite to the yarn feed tube 51, and thus, yarn feed air jetted from the front end of the yarn feed tube 51 through the yarn feed nozzle 51a gradually diverges as it moves away from the yarn feed tube 51, and the yarn Y is smoothly transferred without causing flying out.  A suction device 63 is disposed in such a manner that the suction mouth 63a thereof is located at a position between the guide bar 6 2 and the winding device 10 and substantially on an extension of the bottom surface of the guide member 61.  The suction device 63 may be of a conventionally known type.<br>
In Fig. 6, an oil applicator roll 53 is disposed between the fourth yarn feed roller device 7 and the lower end of the yarn feed tube 51, and a yarn pressing guide 54 presses a yarn Y on the oil applicator roller 53.  The yarn pressing guide 54 is urged to the oil applicator roller 53 as illustrated by a solid line in Fig. 6 by means of a spring 54a under the normal conditions, and when the front end 41a of the yarn guide pipe 41 extends, as illustrated by a dot-and-dash line in Fig. 6, it is lifted.<br>
The threading operation in the above-described embodiment will now be explained.  Prior to the threading operation, as illustrated by a broken line in Fig. 2, the yarn guide pipe 41 disposed beneath the operator's aisle 21 is<br>
- 18 -<br><br>
- 19 -<br>
extended, and the fourth yarn feed roller device 7 is moved to the stand-by position. Accordingly, the yarn guide pipe 41 and the yarn feed tube 51 form a series of substantially continued passage.<br>
Under the conditions, upon threading, the yarn Y withdrawn form the supply package 1, which is mounted on the creel frame 23 illustrated in Fig. 1, is guided to a position above the yarn guide pipe member 34, which is disposed adjacent to the yarn threading slit 13a of the second heater 13, without passing it through the first heater 3 or the twisting device 5 as illustrated by a broken line in Fig. 2. Under the conditions, as illustrated in Fig. 8, the yarn Y is jetted into the guide pipe 34 from the above thereof together with compressed air by means of an air nozzle 50. The end of the yarn Y passing through the guide pipe member 34 arrives at the entrance of the yarn guide pipe 41, and the yarn Y passes through the yarn guide pipe 41 by means of the yarn feed nozzle 41a to the entrance of the yarn feed tube 51, and then the yarn Y is transferred due to the effect of the yarn feed nozzle 51a of the yarn feed tube 51 to the winding device 10 and is threaded thereonto as described later (see the broken line in Fig. 2).<br>
The threading steps after threading onto the yarn guide pipe member 34 will now be explained.  Under the conditions, wherein threading onto the yarn guide pipe member 34 disposed adjacent to the second heater 13 has been completed , an operator threads the yarns Y, which are connected between the supply packages 1 mounted on the creel frame 23 and the yarn guide pipe members 34, one by one onto the first heaters 3 and the twisting devices 5 by means of a threading tool (see Fig. 1).<br>
Under the conditions wherein threading onto the first heater 3 and the twisting device 5 has been completed, the pneumatic cylinder 35 (Figs. 3' and 5) disposed downstream of the second heater 13 is actuated so that the yarn Y is<br>
- 19 -<br><br>
- 20 -<br>
disengaged from the guide pipe member 34 through the yarn removing slit 34a.  The disengaged yarn Y is threaded into the second heater 13 through the yarn threading slit 13a of the second heater 13 (see Fig. 6).  Since the yarn Y which is being transferred to the winding device 10 is threaded into the second heater 13, the yarn can readily be threaded into the second heater 13 without causing yarn breakage.  In the first heater 3, which may be a high temperature heater, the yarn Y !is threaded while it is being travelled as described above, the threading operation can be smoothly done without causing yarn breakag.e.<br>
Then, the yarn Y, which has left the second heater 13, passes through the extended yarn guide pipe 41 (Figs. 2 and 6), and it is fed to the guide member 61 together with compressed air through the yarn feed tube 51, which is provided with the yarn feed nozzle 51a and which is mounted on the winding frame 22.  The yarn Y is guided together with compressed air along the bottom surface 6 la of the guide member 61 which has a reverse J--shaped cross section, and it is guided along the smooth curve formed at the front end 61c (the upper end in Fig. 9), opposite to the yarn feed tube 51, over a position above the guide bar 62 to a position beside the winding device 10.  In this occasion, since the height of the side walls 61b of the guide member 61 increases from the end near the yarn feed tube 51 to the front end opposite to the yarn feed tube 51, yarn feeding air jetted from the end of the yarn feed tube 51 through the yarn feed nozzle 51a diverges gradually as it moves away from the yarn feed tube 51, and the yarn Y is smoothly transferred without causing flying out from the yarn guide member 61.  The yarn Y is caught by the suction mouth 63a of the suction device 63 which is disposed between the guide bar 62 and the winding device 10.  When the yarn Y caught by the suction device 6 3 is threaded automatically or manually onto the winding device 10, the yarn Y is traversed by means of the traverse device 8, wherein, as illustrated by a fan shape in Fig. 10, the front end 51b of the yarn feed tube--51<br>
- 2.0 -<br><br>
- 21 -<br>
is a fulcrum of the traverse motion and the yarn Y is traversed to and fro along the guide bar 62, and the yarn Y is wound up through the friction roller 9.<br>
Thereafter, the actuators 42 and 43 retract the yarn guide pipe 41 and at the same time urge the pressing roller 7a of the fourth yarn feed roller device 7 to the roller 7b disposed on the fixed portion, and then, normal operation starts.<br>
In the above-described explanation, after a yarn is threaded onto the second heater 13, it is threaded onto the winding device 10 so that a yarn under normal conditions is wound onto a bobbin.  However, in some cases, prior to the threading onto the second heater 13, a yarn may be threaded onto the winding device 10.<br>
Further, in the above-described explanation, the yarn guide pipe 41 is disposed beneath the operator's aisle 21. According to the present invention, since a yarn leaving the yarn guide pipe 34 is guided into the yarn guide pipe 41, the travel of the yarn is not disturbed if the yarn guide pipe 41 is disposed along the operator's aisle 21 at a position near its floor.  Accordingly, the yarn guide pipe is not required to be disposed beneath the operator's aisle 21.  However, it is preferred that the yarn guide pipe is disposed beneath the operator's aisle 21 so that walk of an operator on the operator's aisle 21 becomes easier.<br>
Industrial Utility<br>
According to the present invention, an operator can readily thread a yarn without bending upon threading operation from the second feed roller device 6 to the winding device 10, and operational efficiency of the operator is extremely enhanced, and further, time required for threading operation can be shortened due to enhancement of the operational efficiency, and amount of waste yarn can be reduced.<br>
