ABSORBERS<br>
Field of the Invention<br>
This invention relates generally to novel triazine ultraviolet (UV) light absorbers. More<br>
particularly, this invention relates to a 1,3,5-hydroxyphenyl triazine UV light absorbers<br>
substituted with phenyl ether and their use to protect against degradation by environmental<br>
forces, including ultraviolet light, actinic radiation, oxygen, moisture, atmospheric pollutants<br>
and combinations thereof.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Description of Related Art<br>
Exposure to sunlight and other sources of ultraviolet radiation is known to cause<br>
degradation of a variety of materials, especially polymeric materials. For example, polymeric<br>
materials such as plastics often discolor and may become brittle as a result of exposure to<br>
ultraviolet light. Accordingly, a large body of art has been developed directed towards<br>
materials such as ultraviolet light absorbers and stabilizers that are capable of inhibiting such<br>
degradation.<br>
A class of materials known to be ultraviolet light absorbers are o-<br>
hydroxyphenyltriazines, in which at least one substituent on the 1, 3 or 5 carbon on the<br>
triazine ring is a phenyl group with a hydroxyl group ortho to the point of attachment to the<br>
triazine ring. In general this class of materials is well known in the art. Disclosures of a<br>
number of such trisaryl-1,3,5-thazines can be found in the patent literature such as disclosed<br>
in United States Patent Nos. 3,843,371 and 3,896,125.<br>
Typically, the aforementioned aryl ring with the hydroxyl group ortho to the point of<br>
attachment to the triazine ring is based on resorcinol and, consequently, this aryl ring also<br>
contains a second substituent (either a hydroxyl group or a derivative thereof) para to the<br>
point of attachment to the triazine ring. For example, U. S. Patents No. 3,118,837 and<br>
3,244,708 disclose p-alkoxy-o-hydroxyphenyl triazines with improved UV protection, but<br>
many embodiments of such triazines exhibit poor compatibility and solubility, and poor<br>
yellowing performance.<br>
This para- substituent can be "non-reactive," as in the case of an alkyloxy group, or<br>
"reactive" as in the case of a hydroxyalkyloxy (active hydrogen reactive site) or (meth)acryloyl<br>
(ethylenic unsaturation reactive site) group. For the purposes of the present invention, the<br><br>
former are referred to as "non-bondable" substituted triazines and the latter are referred to as<br>
"bondable" substituted triazines.<br>
Low volatility is an important characteristic of stabilizers used in any applications<br>
where high temperatures are encountered. High temperatures are used in the processing of<br>
thermoplastics and in the curing of thermoset resins and coatings. High temperatures are<br>
also often present in the end-use applications for the stabilized material. Low volatility will<br>
prevent loss of the stabilizer during processing, curing, and high temperature end-uses.<br>
Besides reducing losses of stabilizer during processing or curing, low volatility will minimize<br>
processing problems such as die lip build-up and plate-out.<br>
Many polymer additives (such as ultraviolet light stabilizers) migrate out of the<br>
polymer substrate to be protected, or are adsorbed (chemically or physically) by one or more<br>
systems components (such as pigments), thereby diminishing their effectiveness. Such<br>
migration and adsorption problems are examples of the general problems of lack of solubility<br>
and compatibility found for many commercial polymer additives.<br>
Bondable triazines are well known in the art. For example, U. S. Patent Nos.<br>
3,423,360; 4,962,142 and 5,189,084 disclose various bondable and the incorporation of<br>
these compounds into polymers by chemical bonding. Bondable stabilizers have a potential<br>
advantage in this respect in that, depending on the bondable functionality and the particular<br>
polymer system to be stabilized, they can be chemically incorporated into a polymer structure<br>
via reaction of the bondable functionality either during polymer formation (such as in the case<br>
of polymerizing monomers or a cross-linking polymer system) or subsequently with a<br>
preformed polymer having appropriate reactive functionality. Accordingly, due to such<br>
bonding, migration of these UV absorbers between layers of multi-layer coatings and into<br>
polymer substrates is greatly reduced.<br>
This invention discloses a novel class of triazine UV absorbers containing at least<br>
one substituent on the triazine derived from phenyl ether or substituted phenyl ether, which<br>
have been found to have better performance than some of the similar commercial triazine UV<br>
absorbers.<br><br>

The triazines of the present invention may optionally have the added benefit of being<br>
capable of being chemically bonded to appropriate polymer systems via functionality<br>
attached to the triazine groups (e.g., by a hydroxyl, ethylenic unsaturated and/or activated<br>
unsaturated group in one or more of Y or Z).<br>
The triazines of the present invention may in general be prepared via a number of<br>
procedures well known in the art, for example, those described in Brunetti, H; Luethi, C;<br>
Helv. Chemica Acta, 55 (1972) pp. 1566-1595; Tanimoto, S.; Yamagata, M. Senryo to<br>
Yakahin, 40 (1995) pp 339ff; U. S. Patent Nos. 5,106,972; 5,288,868; 5,438,138 and<br>
5,478,935; EP 395,938; EP 577,559; EP 649,841; EP 779,280; WO 9,628,431; GB 884,802;<br>
WO 00/29392 and Japanese Patent Kokai Tokkyo Koho 9,059,263 all of which are<br>
incorporated herein by reference for all purposes as if fully set forth. The preferred method is<br>
the procedure in WO/29392.<br>
The novel triazines of the present invention are particularly useful as ultraviolet light<br>
absorber agents for stabilizing a wide variety of materials including, for example, organic<br>
compounds, oils, fats, waxes, cosmetics, dyes and biocides, and particularly various organic<br>
polymers (both cross-linked and non-cross-linked) used in applications such as photographic<br>
materials, plastics, fibers or dyed fibers, rubbers, paints and other coatings, and adhesives.<br>
The present invention, consequently, also relates to (1) a method of stabilizing a material<br>
which is subject to degradation by actinic radiation (e.g., an organic material such as an<br>
organic polymer in the form of a film, fiber, shaped article or coating) by incorporating into<br>
said material an amount of an actinic radiation stabilizer composition effective to stabilize the<br>
material against the effects of actinic radiation, wherein the actinic radiation stabilizer<br>
composition comprises the inventive triazines; and (2) the material so stabilized.<br>
The novel triazines of the present invention are also effective as ultraviolet light<br>
screening agents in applications such as sunscreens and other cosmetic preparations,<br>
capstock layers for extruded polymers, dyed fibers and laminated UV-screening window<br>
films, among others. The present invention, consequently, also relates (1) to a method of<br>
protecting a substrate against degradation by actinic radiation by applying to the substrate an<br><br>
actinic radiation screening layer (e.g., a coating film or capstock layer) containing an actinic<br>
radiation screening composition in an amount effective to reduce the amount of actinic<br>
radiation impinging on the substrate, wherein the actinic radiation screening composition<br>
comprises the inventive triazines; and (2) the substrate so protected.<br>
The novel triazines of the present invention may also be employed to form light<br>
stabilizing compositions. Such light stabilizing compositions may include a variety of other<br>
components known in the art including other ultraviolet light absorbers of the triazine class,<br>
other ultraviolet light absorbers of different classes (e.g. benzotriazoles, benzophenones),<br>
hindered amine light stabilizers, radical scavengers, antioxidants and the like.<br>
The term "hydrocarbyl" in the context of the present invention, and in the above<br>
formulas, broadly refers to a monovalent hydrocarbon group in which the valency is derived<br>
by abstraction of hydrogen from a carbon atom. Hydrocarbyl includes, for example, aliphatics<br>
(straight and branched chain), cycloaliphatics, aromatics and mixed character groups (e.g.,<br>
aralkyl and alkaryl). Hydrocarbyl also includes such groups with internal unsaturation and<br>
activated unsaturation. More specifically, hydrocarbyl includes (but is not limited to) such<br>
groups as alkyl, cycloalkyl, aryl, aralkyl, alkaryl, alkenyl, cycloalkenyl and alkynyl, preferably<br>
having up to 24 carbon atoms. A hydrocarbyl may optionally contain a carbonyl group or<br>
groups (which is/are included in the carbon count) and/or a heteroatom or heteroatoms (such<br>
as at least one oxygen, sulfur, nitrogen or silicon), in the chain or ring.<br>
The term "functional hydrocarbyl" in the context of the present invention, and in the<br>
above formulas, broadly refers to a hydrocarbyl possessing pendant and/or terminal reactive<br>
and/or latent reactive functionality and/or leaving groups. "Reactive" functionality refers to<br>
functionality which is reactive with common monomer/polymer functionality under normal<br>
conditions well understood by those persons of ordinary skill in the relevant art. As non-<br>
limiting examples of reactive functionality may be mentioned active hydrogen-containing<br>
groups such as hydroxyl, amino, carboxyl, thio, amido, carbamoyl and activated methylene;<br>
isocyanato; cyano; epoxy; ethylenically unsaturated groups such as allyl and methallyl; and<br>
activated unsaturated groups such acryloyl and methacryloyl, and maleate and maleimido<br>
(including the Diels-Alder adducts thereof with dienes such as butadiene). "Latent reactive"<br>
functionality within the meaning of the present invention and, as would clearly be understood<br>
by those persons of ordinary skill in the art, refers to reactive functionality which is blocked or<br>
masked to prevent premature reaction. As examples of latent reactive functionality may be<br>
mentioned ketimines and aldimines (amines blocked, respectively, with ketones and<br>
aldehydes); amine-carboxylate salts; and blocked isocyanates such as alcohol (carbamates),<br>
oxime and caprolactam blocked variations. A "leaving" group within the meaning of the<br>
present invention, as would clearly be understood by those persons of ordinary skill in the<br><br>
relevant art, is a substituent attached to the hydrocarbyl chain or ring which during reaction is<br>
dislodged or displaced to create a valency on a carbon or heteroatom in the hydrocarbyl<br>
chain or ring, said valency being filled by a nucleophile. As examples of leaving groups may<br>
be mentioned halogen atoms such as chlorine, bromine and iodine; hydroxyl groups<br>
(protonated and unprotonated); quaternary ammonium salts (NT4+); sulfonium salts (ST3+);<br>
and sulfonates (—OSO3T); where T is, e.g., methyl or para-tolyl. Of all these classes of<br>
reactive functionality, the preferred functionality includes hydroxyl, —COOR50, —CR51=CH2,<br>
—CO—CR51=CH2, CI, an isocyanate group, a blocked isocyanate group and —NHR50, where<br>
R50 is selected from hydrogen and a hydrocarbyl (preferably of up to 24 carbon<br>
atoms); and<br>
R51 is selected from hydrogen and an alkyl of 1 to 4 carbon atoms (preferably<br>
hydrogen and methyl).<br>
The term "hydrocarbylene" in the context of the present invention is a divalent<br>
hydrocarbon group in which both valencies derive by abstraction of hydrogens from carbon<br>
atoms. Included within the definition of hydrocarbylene are the same groups as indicated<br>
above for hydrocarbyl and functional hydrocarbyl with, of course, the extra valency (for<br>
example, alkylene, alkenylene, arylene, etc.).<br>
The term "functional hydrocarbylene" in the context of the present invention refers to<br>
a species of hydrocarbylene possessing pendant reactive functionality, latent reactive<br>
functionality and/or leaving groups. The term "non-functional hydrocarbylene" in the context<br>
of the present invention refers generally to a hydrocarbylene other than a functional<br>
hydrocarbylene.<br>
 The triazines in accordance with the present invention also relate to latent stabilizing<br>
compounds against actinic radiation where at least one of the hydroxyl groups on an aryl ring<br>
ortho to the point of attachment to the triazine is blocked, that is, wherein at least one X is<br>
other than hydrogen. Such latent stabilizing compounds liberate the effective stabilizers by<br>
cleavage of the O—X bond, e.g., by heating or by exposure to UV radiation. Latent<br>
stabilizing compounds are desirable because they have many favorable properties, i.e., good<br>
substrate compatibility, good color properties, a high cleavage rate of the O—X bond and a<br>
long shelf life. The use of latent stabilizing compounds is further described in U. S. Patent<br>
Nos. 4,775,707; 5,030,731; 5,563,224 and 5,597,854, which are incorporated herein for all<br>
purposes as if fully set forth.<br>
Latent stabilizing compounds comprising the triazines of the present invention can be<br>
prepared from compounds when at least one X is hydrogen, by subjecting said compounds to<br>
a further reaction to form latent stabilizing compounds, as described in the immediately<br>
preceding incorporated references.<br><br>
As preferred examples of blocking groups X may be mentioned one or more of the<br>
following groups: allyl, — CORa, —S02Rb, —SiRcRdRe, —PRfR9 or—PORfR9, —CONHRh,<br>

alkyl, C5—C12 cycloalkyl, C2—C8 alkenyl, — CH2—CO—CH3, C1—C12 alkoxy,<br>
and phenyl or phenoxy which is unsubstituted or substituted by C1—C12 alkyl,<br>
C1—C4 alkoxy, halogen and/or benzyl;<br>
each Rb is independently selected from C1—C12 alkyl, C6—C10 aryl and C7—C18<br>
alkylaryl;<br>

each Rh is independently selected from C1—C8 alkyl, C5—C12 cycloalkyl, C2—C8<br>
alkenyl, —CH2—CO—CH3, and phenyl which is unsubstituted or substituted<br>
by C1—C12 alkyl, C2—C8 alkenyl, C1—C4 alkoxy, halogen and/or benzyl.<br>
The reaction to give the latent stabilizing compounds of the present invention in which<br>
X is allyl, —CORa, —S02Rb, —SiRcRdRe, —PRfR9 or—PORfR9, can be carried out, for<br>
example, by reaction of the compounds of the present invention when at least one X is<br>
hydrogen with the corresponding halides such as allyl chloride, CI—CORa, CI—S02Rb, CI—<br>
SiRcRdRe, CI—PRfR9, or CI—PORfR9. The reaction to give the latent stabilizing compounds<br>
of the present invention in which X is —CONHRh can be carried out, for example, by reaction<br>
of the compounds when at least one X is hydrogen with the corresponding isocyanates.<br>
Furthermore, acylated compounds can be obtained by reaction with anhydrides, ketenes or<br>
esters, such as lower alkyl esters, as is well known to one skilled in the art. The above-<br>
described reagents may be used in approximately equimolar amounts or in excess, for<br>
example, from 2 to 20 mol with respect to the hydroxyl groups desired to be made latent in<br>
the starting compound.<br>
Catalysts customarily used for acylation, sulfonylation, phosphonylation, silylation or<br>
urethanation reactions may be used in forming the latent stabilizing triazines of the present<br>
invention. For example, acylation and sulfonylation reaction catalysts such as tertiary or<br>
quaternary amines, such as triethylamine, dimethylaminopyridine or tetrabutylammonium<br>
salts, may be used for forming these latent stabilizing compounds.<br>
The reaction may be carried out in the presence of a solvent, such as relatively inert<br>
organics, e.g., hydrocarbons such as toluene and xylene, chlorinated hydrocarbons such as<br><br>
carbon tetrachloride or chloroform, or ethers such as tetrahydrofuran or dibutyl ether, or<br>
without a solvent. Alternatively, the reagent(s) may be employed as the solvent. The<br>
reaction temperature is usually between room temperature and about 150°C, for example, up<br>
to the boiling point of the solvent when a solvent is used.<br>

Methods of Preparation<br>
The method of preparing the novel triazines of the present invention can be<br>
preformed by any suitable method as mentioned above. Preferably, the method of producing<br>
the novel triazine compound is from the method described in WO 00/29392 herein<br>
incorporated by reference in its entirety.<br>
The term "Lewis acid" is intended to include aluminum halides, alkylaluminum halides,<br>
boron halides, tin halides, titanium halides, lead halides, zinc halides, iron halides, gallium<br>
halides, arsenic halide, copper halides, cadmium halides, mercury halides, antimony halides,<br>
and the like. Preferred Lewis acids include aluminum trichloride, aluminum tribromide,<br>
trimethylaluminum, boron trifluoride, boron trichloride, zinc dichloride, titanium tetrachloride,<br>
tin dichloride, tin tetrachloride, or a mixture thereof.<br>
As used herein the term "reaction promoter" is understood to comprise a compound,<br>
which is used in combination with the Lewis acid to facilitate the reaction. Suitable reaction<br>
promoters include acids, bases, water, alcohols, aliphatic halides, halide salts, acid halides,<br>
halogens, alkenes, alkynes, ester, anhydride, carbonate, urethane, carbonyl, epoxy, ether,<br>
acetal compounds, or mixtures thereof. For a more detailed list of reaction promoters, refer<br>
to WO 00/29392.<br><br>
The novel triazines of the present invention can be prepared through the modified<br>
Friedel-Crafts reaction of a cyanuric halide with a phenyl ether in the presence of a reaction<br>
promoter and a Lewis acid, (see Scheme 1), followed by or reacted concurrently with a<br>
resorcinol-based phenolic compound.<br><br>
wherein Z' is fluorine, bromine, chlorine, or iodine and the other substituents are defined<br>
above.<br>
The relative amounts of the reactants are as follows. The amount of phenyl ether<br>
compound should be in sufficient amounts to react with the cyanuric halide to produce the<br>
desired intermediate compound. If a mono-phenyl ether triazine compound is desired, then<br>
about 1 molar equivalents should be reacted with the cyanuric halide. If a bis(phenyl ether)<br>
triazine compound is desired, then about 2 molar equivalents of phenyl ether should be<br>
reacted with the cyanuric halide. It should be noted that other embodiments of the present<br>
invention are the mono-phenyl ether and bis(phenyl ether) triazine intermediate compounds.<br>
The amount of Lewis acid, such as AICI3, used in the reaction should be in sufficient<br>
amounts to transform the cyanuric halide to the desired intermediate and/or end product.<br>
The amount of Lewis acid should be between about 0.5 to about 500 mol equivalents to the<br>
cyanuric halide. Preferably, the amount of Lewis acid should be between about 1 to about 5<br><br>
mol equivalents to the cyanuric halide or about 2 to about 4 mol equivalents to cyanuric<br>
halide. The preferred Lewis acid is aluminum trichloride.<br>
Advantageously, a reaction promoter can be used in conjunction with a Lewis acid<br>
when synthesizing the desired compounds. Preferably, the amount of reaction promoter<br>
should be between about 0.01 mol to about 5 mol equivalents, or about 0.1 mol to about 2<br>
mol equivalents.<br>
The reaction should run for a sufficient amount of time, at a sufficient temperature<br>
and pressure to synthesize the desired triazine. The preferred reaction time for the synthesis<br>
of the intermediate compound, i.e., the first step, is between about 5 minutes and about 48<br>
hours, more preferred between about 15 minutes and about 24 hours. The preferred<br>
reaction time for the synthesis of end product compound, i.e., the second step, is between<br>
about 10 minutes and about 24 hours, more preferably time is between about 30 minutes and<br>
about 12 hours. The preferred reaction temperature for the first step is between about -50°C<br>
and about 150°C, more preferred reaction temperature between about-30°C and about<br>
50°C. The reaction pressure is not critical and can be about 1 atmosphere or higher if<br>
desired. Preferably, the reaction is carried out under an inert gas such as nitrogen or argon.<br>
The preferred reaction temperature for the second step is between about 0°C and about<br>
120°C, a more preferred reaction temperature is between about 20°C and about 100°C.<br>
The step-wise process comprises mixing at least one Lewis acid, at least one reaction<br>
promoter, cyanuric halide and phenyl ether, preferably until the reaction is between about<br>
70% to about 100% completed. Thereafter, the product is isolated and purified. The<br>
intermediate product is then added to the subsequent reactant along with Lewis acid and<br>
optionally a reaction promoter to synthesize the desired end product. The step-wise<br>
sequence allows for the isolation, purification, and storage of compounds of the intermediate<br>
prior to subsequent reaction with phenol-based compounds, such as resorcinol.<br>
The continuous reaction comprises allowing the cyanuric halide to react with one or<br>
more phenyl ethers in the presence of at least one Lewis acid and at least one a reaction<br>
promoter preferably until the reaction is between about 70% to about 100% complete.<br>
Thereafter, without isolating the intermediate product, the resorcinol-based phenolic<br>
compound is allowed to react with the intermediate product in the presence of optionally at<br>
least one second Lewis acid and optionally at least one second reaction promoter preferably<br>
until the reaction is between about 70% to about 100% complete. The continuous reaction<br>
eliminates the need to purify the intermediate product or use of additional reagents such as<br>
solvents, and optionally Lewis acids and acids. Moreover, the one-step process simplifies<br>
the synthetic reaction pathway such that no unnecessary handling or processing of the<br>
reaction mixture is required until the reaction is completed.<br><br>
In an another process as disclosed in United States Patent No. 6,225,468 B1<br>
cyanuric chloride can be simultaneously reacted with phenyl ether and resorcinol in the<br>
presence of Lewis acid, such as aluminum chloride, to obtain the desired product.<br>

sunscreens). The novel triazines of the present invention can be incorporated into such<br>
material in any one of a variety of conventional manners, including for example, physical<br>
mixing or blending, optionally, with chemical bonding to the material (typically to a polymer),<br>

The weight ratio of the triazine compounds of the present invention to the other<br>
additives, such as the preferred additives may be, for example from about 500:1 to about<br>
1:500, or about 100:1 to about 1:100, or about 10:1 to about 1:10. The novel triazines of the<br>
present invention can also be employed in multilayer systems. In such systems, a polymer<br>
composition having from about 0.1 to about 20% by weight and preferably a relatively high<br>
content of novel triazine stabilizer, for example, about 5-15% by weight, is applied in a thin<br>
film (e.g., about 5 - 500 m thick and, preferably, about 10 -100 m thick) to a shaped article<br>
made from a polymer containing little or no ultraviolet stabilizers. Such composition may be<br>
applied at the same time as the shaping of the base structure, for example by co-extrus,on in<br>
a manner analogous to that described in U. S. Patent No. 4,948,666 (incorporated by<br>
reference herein for all purposes as if fully set forth). Alternatively, application can also be<br>
made to the ready-formed base structure, for example by lamination with a film or by coating<br>
with a solution. The outer layer or layers of the finished article have the function of a UV<br><br>
filter, which protects the interior of the article from UV light. The outer layer preferably<br>
contains about 0.1 to about 20%, preferably about 1 to about 15%, and most preferably about<br>
2 to about 10% by weight of the outer layer composition, of at least one of the triazine<br>
compounds of the present invention.<br>
The polymers stabilized in this way are notable for high weathering resistance,<br>
especially for high resistance to UV light. This enables them to retain their mechanical<br>
properties, and their color surface properties such as gloss and distinctness of image, for a<br>
long time even when used outside. Moreover, due to the bondable nature of the presently<br>
claimed triazine compounds, migration of these UV absorbers between the layers of the<br>
multi-layer coatings can, under the appropriate circumstances, be minimized.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the novel triazine compounds can be<br>
used as stabilizers for coatings, for example for paints such as disclosed in numerous<br>
references (see, e.g., U. S. Patent Nos. 4,619,956; 4,740,542; 4,826,978; 4,962,142;<br>
5,106,891; 5,198,498; 5,298,067; 5,322,868; 5,354,794; 5,369,140; 5,420,204; 5,461,151;<br>
5,476,937; EP-0434608 and EP-A-0444323). Of particular interest are coatings and paints<br>
for the automobile industry. The invention therefore also relates to those compositions which<br>
are film-forming binders for coatings.<br>
Such novel coating compositions comprise about 0.01 to about 20%, preferably about<br>
0.01 to about 10%, and more preferably about 0.02 to about 5% by weight of the binder of<br>
the coating composition of the presently claimed triazines of the present invention.<br>
To achieve maximum light stability, it is of particular interest to add sterically hindered<br>
amines, examples of which are set out in the above-mentioned section b(vi). The invention<br>
therefore also relates to a coating composition which, in addition to the binder, the novel<br>
triazines and, optionally, additional UV absorbers, comprises a light stabilizer of the sterically<br>
hindered amine type. The sterically hindered amine is employed in an amount of about 0.01<br>
to 5% by weight based on the weight of the solid binder, preferably about 0.02 to 2% by<br>
weight.<br>
One specific example of such a sterically hindered amine is a 2,2,6,6-tetramethyi<br>
piperazinone containing at least one group of the formula:<br><br>
in which J is, for example, hydrogen, hydroxyl, alkyl (such as methyl), alkoxy (such as<br>
methoxy) or acyl.<br><br><br>
More preferably the stabilizer is a 2,2,6,6-tetraalkylpiperidine derivative containing at<br>
least one group of the formula:<br>
in which J is, for example, hydrogen, hydroxyl, alkyl (such as methyl), alkoxy (such as<br>
methoxy) or acyl.<br>
Examples of tetraalkylpiperidine derivatives which can be used in combination with<br>
the present trisaryl-1,3,5-triazine compounds are given in U. S. Patent Nos. 4,314,933;<br>

desired substrates, for example to metal, wood, plastic, fiberglass or ceramic materials. The<br>
coating compositions can be pigmented mono-coats or multi-layer<br>
(primer/basecoat/clearcoat) systems typical of automotive finishes. In the latter case, the<br>
novel coating composition can be used for either the base coat, or clear coat, or for both<br>
layers. If the topcoat of an automotive finish comprises two layers, of which the lower layer is<br>
pigmented and the upper layer is not pigmented, the novel coating composition can be used<br><br>
for either the upper or the lower layer or for both layers, but preferably for the upper topcoat<br>
layer.<br>

PERFORMANCE OF THE TRIAZINE LIGHT STABILIZER OF THE<br>
INVENTION COMPARED TO CONVENTIONAL TRIAZINE LIGHT STABILIZERS<br>
Examples 17 to 19: Preparation of performance samples containing 2-(2-hydroxy-4-<br>
octyloxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine (Compound A) and other<br>
commercial UV absorbers in Polycarbonate Plaques.<br>
Compound A, 2-(2-hydroxy-4-octyloxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(4-phenoxyphenyl)-1,3,5-triazine,<br>
at a loading level of 0.35% by weight and 0.05% phosphite (Ultranox 641, commercially<br>
available from General Electric Specialty Chemicals of Morgantown, WV) was dry blended<br>
into a Lexan101-1111 polycarbonate pellets (containing 0.5% phosphite) or Lexan 100 virgin<br>
polycarbonate flakes (both commercially available from General Electric Specialty Chemicals<br>
of Morgantown, WV). The blended material was melt mixed and then extruded in a<br>
Brabender PL-2000 torque rheometer (commercially available from Pasedena Hydraulics of<br>
The City of Industry, CA) equipped with a single mixing screw extruder at 300°C. The<br>
extrudate was cooled dried and pellitized. The pellets were injection molded into sample<br>
plaques (2 inches x 2.5 inches x 125 mils) using an Arburg Allrounder 320-210-750 injection<br>
molding machine (commercially available from Arbury GmbH &amp; Co. of Lossburg, Germany) at<br>
300°C. Plaques with a commercially available triazine light stabilizer, TINUVIN® 1577, a<br>
product of Ciba Specialty Chemicals, [2-(2-hydroxy-4-hexyloxyphenyl)-4,6-bis(phenyl)-1,3,5-<br>
triazine] and control plaques without any UV absorber were prepared in an identical manner.<br>
Examples 20 to 22: Effects of Weathering on UV Stabilized Plaques<br>
Sample plaques were subjected to xenon-arc accelerated weathering. Xenon-arc<br>
accelerated weathering was carried out by exposing the sample plaques in a xenon-arc<br>
weatherometer as determined by the ASTM G-155 Standard using Test Method B.<br>
Discoloration as measured by yellowing index (Yl) as a function of weathering time. Color<br>
development was determined with a Macbeth Color Eye Colorimeter under laboratory<br>
conditions with illuminate C, 2° observer, specular component excluded, and UV component<br>
included.<br>
Table 1 below shows the effect of xenon-arc accelerated weathering, as measured by<br>
Yl (yellow index) values, for polycarbonate plaques containing 0.35% by weight of Compound<br>
A, TINUVIN1577 (Tin-1577), and blank polycarbonate plaques for control. An increase in Yl<br>
indicates an unfavorable discoloration of the polycarbonate.<br><br>
Table 1: Xenon-Arc Accelerated Weathering Of A Polycarbonate UV Stabilized Plague<br><br>
The results in Table 1 show that the initial Yl for compound A compared to the<br>
commercially available product is significantly better resulting in less initial discoloration of<br>
the polycarbonate plaques. The results also demonstrate that the polycarbonate plaque<br>
stabilized with Compound A showed equal or improved performance compared to the<br>
polycarbonate plaques containing TINUVIN 1577 and no stabilizer when the plaques were<br>
subjected to xenon-arc accelerated weathering.<br>
Examples 23 to 24: Effect on Severe Molding Conditions on UV Stabilizer<br>
Polycarbonate Plaques<br>
Table 2 shows the effect on Yl values of exposing the polycarbonate pellets to severe<br>
conditions during the injection molding process used to manufacture the plaques. The<br>
plaques contained 0.35% by weight of the UV stabilizers compounds and 0.05% of a<br>
phosphite. As noted above, plaques are typically processed with temperatures up to 300°C.<br>
Under the severe conditions the plaques are processed at a temperature of 340°C with the<br>
compound filling the length of the injection molder barrel for either 40 seconds (refer to as<br>
severe 40 seconds) or for 5 minutes (refer to as severe 5 minutes).<br>
Table 2: Effect of Severe Injection Molding Conditions on Yl Values<br><br><br>
The results in Table 2 demonstrate that the stability of polycarbonate plaques<br>
containing Compound A was marginally superior to the stability of polycarbonate plaques<br>
containing 0.35% of TINUVIN 1577 as measured by Yl values, when the plaques were<br>
subjected to severe processing conditions.<br>
Overall the results show that Compound A is effective at stabilizing polymeric<br>
compounds, such as polycarbonates, against discoloration. Moreover, the results<br>
demonstrate that Compound A is superior to a similar commercially available conventional<br>
triazine light stabilizer in initial discoloration, and equal or marginally better when subject to<br>
accelerated weathering and severe molding conditions.<br>
