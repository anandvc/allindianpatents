				<td>METHOD AND APPARATUS FOR CALL SET UP IN A MOBILE<br>
COMMUNICATION SYSTEM<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATION<br>
This application claims the benefit under 35 U.S.C. ยง 119(a) of Korean<br>
patent application entitled "METHOD AND APPARTUS FOR CALL SET UP IN<br>
A MOBILE COMMUNICATION SYSTEM" filed in the Korean Industrial<br>
Property Office on May 19, 2004, and assigned Serial No. 2004-35728, the entire<br>
contents of which are hereby incorporated by reference.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Field of the Invention:<br>
The present invention relates to a mobile communication system. More<br>
particularly, the present invention relates to a method and an apparatus for<br>
establishing a call in a mobile switching center (MSC).<br>
Description of the Related Art:<br>
Typically in a conventional mobile communication system, a procedure<br>
for setting a speech path based on radio network resources of the mobile station is<br>
required in order to establish a call for providing the service between mobile<br>
stations. Such a procedure for establishing the call should follow only a<br>
standardized procedure. Unlike a synchronous mobile communication system<br>
such as that employed in Korea, an asynchronous mobile communication system,<br>
which is some times called a "European Type" system, defines a procedure for<br>
establishing the call requiring two steps, that is, one step for setting up a Radio<br>
Resource Control (RRC) connection path for transmitting control information,<br>
and another step for setting up a service connection path for transmitting user<br>
traffics. Accordingly, the calling mobile station and the called mobile station<br>
perform the step for setting up the RRC connection path and the step for setting<br>
the user traffics connection, respectively.<br>
FIG. 1 illustrates a structure of a conventional asynchronous mobile<br>
communication system. In FIG. 1, the system comprises a base station 105 for<br>
setting up an RRC connection path connected with a calling mobile station 100, a<br><br>
radio network controller ( RNC) 115 for controlling the RRC connection path via<br>
the base station 105, a base station 130 for setting RRC connection path<br>
connected with a called mobile station 135, a radio network controller (RNC) 125<br>
for controlling the RRC connection path through the base station 130, and a<br>
Mobile Switching Center (MSC) 120 for providing service connections between<br>
the RNCs 115 and 125. According to such a structure in the conventional<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system mentioned above, the users can<br>
communicate with each other through the mobile stations 100 and 135.<br>
Each of the base stations 105, 110 and 130 has at least a transceiver<br>
capable of performing wireless communication with the mobile stations 100 and<br>
135. The RNCs 115 and 125 control the base stations 105, 110 and 130, and<br>
exchange messages for setting up RRC connection path and the service<br>
connection path with the base stations 105, 110 and 130 and the MSC 120.<br>
FIG. 2 illustrates a process for establishing a call in a conventional mobile<br>
communication system shown in FIG. 1. In FIG. 2, for simplicity and clarification<br>
to further understand the prior art, procedures for establishing the calls between<br>
the calling and the called stations and the base stations are omitted. At step 205,<br>
the calling mobile station 100 performs Radio Resource Control (RRC)<br>
connection setup between the base station and the calling mobile station 100 in<br>
accordance with control of the RNC 115. At step 210, if the RNC 115 transmits a<br>
service request message to the MSC 120, the MSC 120 receives the service<br>
request message. The service request message has been sent from the mobile<br>
station to the network to initiate a call establishment originated by the calling<br>
mobile station. Also, the service request message comprises a bearer capability. At<br>
step 215, the MSC transmits an incoming call request message to the RNC 125<br>
which covers the called mobile station 135 located therein. Next at step 220, the<br>
RNC 125 sets up RRC connection path between the called mobile station 135 and<br>
the base station. Then at step 225, the RNC 125 transfers, to the MSC 120, the<br>
service acceptance message indicating that the called mobile station can accept<br>
the service requested by the calling mobile station. The service acceptance<br>
message also comprises the bearer capability. Next, at step 230, the MSC 120<br>
which has received the service acceptance message transmits, to the RNC 115, a<br>
service connection path setup request message for transferring user traffics<br>
between the mobile stations and the base stations based on the types of the<br>
services. Then, at step 235, the RNC 115 sets up the service connection path for<br><br>
transferring the user traffics between the mobile stations and the base stations<br>
according to the setup request message of the MSC 120. Also at step 240, the<br>
RNC 115 sends a setup response message of the service connection path to the<br>
MSC 120. Then, at step 245, the MSC 120 sends the setup request of the service<br>
connection path to the RNC 125. Next, at step 250, the RNC 125 sets up the<br>
service connection path between the mobile terminal 135 and the MSC 120. Then<br>
at step 255, the RNC 125 provides a service connection path setup response, and<br>
completes all the process of the call setup. As a result, if the called mobile<br>
terminal gives a response to the ring caused by the call, then speaking or<br>
communication between the calling and the called mobile stations can be made<br>
through the established service connection path.<br>
By the way, in process for RRC connection setup at step 220, if there is no<br>
response from the called mobile terminal, after a certain time period has elapsed,<br>
the MSC 120 sets up a service connection path connected with the calling mobile<br>
station in order to transmit service-unavailable notice broadcast.<br>
Such a conventional process for establishing a service connection path<br>
setup can be classified largely into 4 steps including a first step for an RRC<br>
connection setup of the calling mobile station at step 205, a second step for an<br>
RRC connection setup of the called mobile station at step 220, a third step for a<br>
service connection path setup of the calling mobile station at step 235 and a<br>
fourth step for a service connection path setup of the called mobile station at step<br>
250. The 4 steps mentioned above are performed sequentially according to the<br>
process flow. Therefore, the process for performing the service connection path<br>
setups of both the calling and the called mobile stations is a time-consuming<br>
procedure.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
Accordingly, the present invention has been made to solve the above-<br>
mentioned problems occurring in the prior art, and an object of the present<br>
invention is to provide a method in which the time for establishing a call setup<br>
can be significantly decreased in a mobile communication system.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to provide a calling setup<br>
method in which it is possible to perform substantially simultaneously both a step<br>
for service connection path setup of a calling mobile station and a step for an<br><br>
RRC connection path setup of a called mobile station.<br>
In order to accomplish these objects, according to an aspect of the<br>
present invention, a method for establishing a call between a calling mobile<br>
station and a called mobile station in a mobile communication system is provided.<br>
The method comprising the steps of receiving a service request message from a<br>
calling radio network controller (RNC), and transmitting an incoming call request<br>
message to a called radio network controller (RNC), transmitting a first service<br>
connection path setup request to the calling RNC prior to receiving a service<br>
acceptance message from the called RNC, transmitting a second service<br>
connection path setup request to the called RNC, when received, from the called<br>
RNC, the service acceptance message corresponding to the incoming call request<br>
and then when received, from the calling RNC, a first service connection path<br>
setup response corresponding to the first service connection path setup request,<br>
and receiving, from the called RNC, a second connection path setup response<br>
corresponding to the second connection path setup request.<br>
According to another aspect of the present invention, an apparatus for<br>
establishing a call between a calling mobile station and a called mobile station in<br>

controller (RNC), a control unit for confirming a requested service which has<br>
been requested through the service request message, determining if the service<br>
acceptance message from a called radio network controller (RNC) is received,<br>
and determining if a first service connection path setup response message from<br>
the calling RNC is received, and a transmitting unit for a first service connection<br>
path setup request message to the calling RNC in response to the service request<br>
message, wherein if receiving the service acceptance message and the first service<br>
connection path setup response message, the transmitting unit transmits a second<br>
connection path setup request message to the called RNC.<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF EXEMPLARY EMBODIMENTS<br>
Hereinafter, exemplary embodiments of the present invention will be<br>
described with reference to the accompanying drawings. A detailed description of<br>
known functions and configurations incorporated herein will be omitted for<br>
conciseness.<br>
The exemplary embodiment of the present invention as described below<br>
substantially simultaneously performs a step for service connection path setup of<br>
a calling mobile station and a step for an RRC connection path setup of a called<br>
mobile station by a calling setup scheme in accordance with exemplary<br>
embodiments of the present invention,<br>
In FIG. 2, after receiving a service acceptance of a called mobile station, a<br>
service connection path setup of a calling mobile is established. This is mainly<br>
because the called mobile station should send its support capability to an Mobile<br>
Switching Center (MSC) such that the called mobile station negotiates its<br>
substantial support range with the MSC and then supports its capability of the<br>
negotiated support range when there are some differences between a requested<br>
capability of the calling mobile station and the substantial support capability of<br>
the called mobile station. In voice services, however, all the mobile stations can<br>
have the support capability for that voice services. Therefore, when the MSC<br><br>
confirms the requested service of the calling mobile station has been the voice<br>
service, then MSC can establish the service connection path setup of the calling<br>
mobile station to provide a speaking path without receiving any service<br>
acceptance from the called mobile station.<br>
For example, in an asynchronous system, there are several types of<br>
services which the mobile station cannot support. The Adaptive Multi-Rate<br>
(AMR) of 12.2 Kbps, however, can be supported by all the mobile stations.<br>
Therefore, if the requested service of the calling mobile station is a voice service<br>
of just the AMR of 12.2 Kbps, the MSC establishes the service connection path<br>
setup based on the AMR without receiving any service acceptance from the called<br>
mobile station.<br>
FIG. 3 is a diagram illustrating a call setup scheme in a mobile<br>
communication system according to an exemplary embodiment of the present<br>
invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 3, at step 320, a calling mobile station, in other wards,<br>
User Equipment (UE), 100 establishes Radio Resource Control (RRC) setup<br>
through a Radio Network Controller (RNC) 115. Next, if the calling mobile<br>
station 100 sends a service request message to an MSC Mobile Switching Center<br>
(MSC) 120 at step 325, then at step 330, the MSC 120 sends an incoming call<br>
request to a called mobile station, in other wards, User Equipment (UE), 135 via<br>
an RNC 125 which has a coverage area where the called mobile station 135 is<br>
located. Also, the MSC 120 determines if the service request is a voice speaking<br>
service. If the voice speaking service, then at step 335, the MSC 120 sends<br>
immediately a predetermined service connection path setup request to the calling<br>
RNC 115. The term "immediately" indicates that, unlike the process of FIG. 2, the<br>
MSC 120 sends directly the service connection path setup request to the RNC 115<br>
without receiving a service acceptance message from the called RNC 125.<br>
At step 340, the calling RNC 115 receives the setup request message and<br>
establishes the service connection path setup for transferring user traffics between<br>
the calling mobile station 100 and the MSC 120. Also, the RNC 115 sends a<br>
service connection path response message to the MSC 120 at step 345, while the<br>
called mobile station establishes the RRC setup through the RNC 125 at step 350.<br>
Further, at step 355, the RNC 125 sends a service acceptance request message to<br>
the MSC 120. Next, when the MSC 120 receives the service acceptance of the<br>
called side and the service connection path setup response of the calling side, at<br><br>
step 360 the MSC 120 sends another service connection path setup request to the<br>
RNC 125. Next, the RNC 125 establishes the service connection path setup for<br>
transferring the user traffics between the called mobile station 135 and the MSC<br>
120 at step 365. Also, at step 370, the RNC 125 sends the service connection path<br>
setup response to the MSC 120 to finally complete the whole process of the call<br>
setup. Next, if the called mobile station responds to ringing for speaking or<br>
communication, the speaking or communication is made at step 375.<br>
When the called mobile station, however, does not respond to the ringing,<br>
the MSC 120 sends service-unavailable notice broadcast through a service<br>
connection path connected with the calling mobile station. Also, when there is no<br>
service acceptance at step 355, it is possible to rapidly provide the service-<br>
unavailable notice broadcast through a service connection path connected with<br>
the calling mobile station.<br>
In the prior art of FIG. 2, only after the service acceptance of the called<br>
mobile station has been confirmed, the step of the service connection path setup<br>
for the calling mobile station is processed at step 235. Unlike the prior art,<br>
according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, both the step for<br>
establishing the Commitment, Concurrency and Recovery (CCR) connection<br>
setup of the called mobile station at step 350 and the step for establishing the<br>
service connection path setup of the calling mobile station at step 340 can be<br>
processed at the same time as shown in FIG. 3.<br>
Specifically, in the process for establishing the service connection setup<br>
according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention, after<br>
establishing the Radio Resource Control (RRC) connection path setup of the<br>
calling mobile station at step 320, both establishing the CCR connection path<br>
setup of the called mobile station at step 350 and establishing the service<br>
connection path setup of the calling mobile station at step 340 are performed the<br>
same time or substantially the same time. Next, the step for establishing the<br>
service connection path setup of the called mobile station is processed at step 365.<br>
FIG. 4 is a flow chart for explaining the operation process of a mobile<br>
switching center according to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
When the MSC receives the service request message from the calling<br>
RNC at step 400, the MSC sends the incoming call request message to the called<br>
mobile station at step 405, and determines if the requested service is a voice<br>
service or a dynamic image service at step 410. If the requested service is not the<br><br>
voice service, for example, asynchronous Adaptive Multi Rate (AMR), or<br>
synchronous Qualcomm Code Excited Linear Predictive (QCELP), but the<br>
dynamic image service, the MSC waits for the service acceptance message from<br>
the called RNC at step 415. When the service acceptance message is received,<br>
then the process proceeds to the step 420 wherein the MSC sends the service<br>
connection path setup request to the calling RNC. Next, when the MSC receives<br>
the service connection path setup response message from the calling RNC at step<br>
425, similarly the MSC, again, sends the service connection path setup request to<br>
the called RNC at step 430. At step 435, the service connection path setup<br>
response is made to finally complete the whole process of the call setup.<br>
Therefore it is possible to speak or communicate between the users through the<br>
mobile communication system.<br>
Contrarily, at step 410, if the requested service is just the voice service<br>
which is supported by the called mobile station, at step 450, the MSC sends the<br>
service connection path setup request message of the calling mobile station to the<br>
calling RNC without waiting for the service acceptance of the called mobile<br>
station. In this case, both the step for establishing the CCR connection path setup<br>
of the called mobile station and the step for establishing the service connection<br>
path setup of the calling mobile station are performed at the almost same time. At<br>
step 455, the MSC operates in a standby mode until receiving all of both the<br>
service connection path setup response and the service acceptance message of the<br>
called RNC. The elapsed times of receiving the response and the service<br>
acceptance messages may be different from each other according to the service<br>
connection path setup time of the calling side or the RRC setup time of the called<br>
side. If receiving all, the process proceeds to step 430, and if not, the process<br>
returns to step 455. Finally, the MSC sends the service connection path setup<br>
request message to the called RNC at step 430, and receives the service<br>
connection path setup response to eventually complete the whole process of the<br>
call setup at step 435.<br>
FIG. 5 illustrates a structure of a mobile switching center according to an<br>
exemplary embodiment of the present invention.<br>
Referring to FIG. 5, a receiving unit 510 is a module for receiving<br>
messages transmitted from the calling RNC and the called RNC. The messages<br>
transmitted from the RNCs comprises for example, a service request message<br>
from the calling RNC and a service connection path setup response message<br><br>
which is transmitted after setting up the service connection path. Also the<br>
receiving unit 510 receives a service acceptance message indicating a service-<br>
availability of the called mobile station, and a service connection path setup<br>
response message from the called RNC.<br>
A control unit 520 determines if a requested service can be supported by<br>
the called mobile station. The requested service has been requested through the<br>
service request message and the receiving unit 510 has previously received the<br>
requested service as mentioned above. If the requested service is for example, a<br>
voice service of AMR 12.2 kbps, the control unit 520 sends a service connection<br>
path setup request message to a transmitting unit 530 in order to transmit the<br>
request message to the calling RNC.<br>
When the control unit 520 does not receive a response message<br>
corresponding to the service connection path setup request from the calling radio<br>
network controller, the control unit 520 provides a service-unavailable notice<br>
broadcast via a service connection path previously setup between the called RNC<br>
and the control unit 520.<br>
The transmitting unit 530 is a module for transmitting messages to the<br>
calling RNC and the called RNC. Specifically, the transmitting unit 530 transmits,<br>
to the calling RNC, the service connection path setup request message which has<br>
been transmitted from the control unit 520. Further, the transmitting unit 530<br>
transmits, to the called RNC, an incoming call request message and the service<br>
connection path setup request message based on the service acceptance message.<br>
According to an exemplary embodiment of the present invention as<br>
mentioned above, the elapsed time for establishing a call between the calling and<br>
called mobile stations can be significantly reduced because, in the mobile<br>
switching center, the incoming call request message and the service connection<br>
path setup request message can be transmitted in the same period of time. If the<br>
response message of the called mobile station is not received, it is possible to<br>
further rapidly make the service-unavailable notice broadcast through a service<br>
connection path previously set and connected with the calling mobile terminal.<br>
While the invention has been shown and described with reference to<br>
exemplary embodiments thereof, various changes in forms and details may be<br>
made within the scope of the present invention. For example, in addition to the<br>
asynchronous mobile communication system mentioned above, the principle of<br>
the present invention may be applied to all the other mobile communication<br><br>
systems or its equivalents similar to the asynchronous system in structure and<br>
operation thereof. Accordingly, the scope of the present invention should not be<br>
limited to the embodiments described in the specification but to the appended<br>
claims or its equivalents.<br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1. A method for setting up a call between a calling mobile station and a<br>
called mobile station by a Mobile Switching Center MSC in a mobile<br>
communication system, the method comprising the steps of:<br>

ABSTRACT<br><br>
TITLE: A method for setting up a call between a calling mobile station and a<br>
called mobile station by a Mobile Switching Center MSC in a mobile<br>
communication system<br>
The invention relates to a method for setting up a call between a calling<br>
mobile station and a called mobile station by a Mobile Switching Center MSC<br>
in a mobile communication system, the method comprising the steps of<br>
receiving (325) a service request message from a calling radio network<br>
controller (RNC) (115), and transmitting an incoming call request message to<br>
a called radio network controller (RNC) (125); determining if a requested<br>
service requested through the service request message can be supported by<br>
the called mobile station (135); transmitting (335) a first service connection<br>
path setup request to the calling RNC (115) prior to receiving (355) a service<br>
acceptance message from the called RNC (125) if the requested service can<br>
be supported by the called mobile station (135) transmitting (360) a second<br>
service connection path setup request to the called RNC (125), after receiving<br>
both the service acceptance message corresponding to the incoming call<br>
request from the called RNC (125) and a first service connection path setup<br>
response corresponding to the first service connection path setup request<br>
from the calling RNC (115); and receiving (370), from the called RNC (125),<br>
a second connection path setup response corresponding to the second<br>
connection path setup request.</td>
