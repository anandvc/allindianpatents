				<td>THREAD PROFILE MODIFICATION FOR CONTROLLED STIFFNESS<br>
FIELD<br>
[0001] The present disclosure relates to threaded fasteners and, more<br>
particularly, to a thread pattern for improved clamp load retention of a bolted<br>
joint.<br>
BACKGROUND<br>
[0002] The statements in this section merely provide background<br>
information related to the present teachings and may not constitute prior art.<br>
[0003] Threaded fasteners, such as bolts, are used to join components<br>
together. The bolt can be used in conjunction with a nut or an internal threaded<br>
bore in one of the components to retain the components together. The exterior<br>
surface of the bolt and interior surface of the nut or the bore (hereinafter threaded<br>
member) include complementary threads that contact axially as the bolt is<br>
inserted into the threaded member and rotated. The purpose of the bolt and the<br>
threaded member are to create and retain axial load throughout the service life of<br>
the components being joined together. The bolt and the threaded member<br>
thereby impart a clamping load on the components. If the bolt and the threaded<br>
member do not retain a minimum axial load (clamp load) a highly loaded joint will<br>
fail.<br>
[0004] In conventional bolted joint design, nominally perfect internal<br>
and external threads of a bolt and its threaded member contact axially as the bolt<br><br>
is inserted into the threaded member and rotated relative to the threaded<br>
member. However, normal deflection of the bolt threads as tightening loads are<br>
applied locally changes the thread pitch which can result in uneven distribution of<br>
the load. This uneven distribution loads the top or first thread of the bolt most<br>
heavily when the bolt is tightened. These localized changes in bolt pitch can<br>
result in stress concentrations and plastic yield that increase susceptibility to load<br>
loss under service due to yield and creep. The yielding and creeping can be<br>
more pronounced when one of the threads, such as the internal threads, are<br>
weaker.<br>
[0005] In highly stressed joints, such as a cylinder head or a crankshaft<br>
bearing journal cap, the goal is to maximize tension in the bolt. To achieve this,<br>
bolt tightening strategies are designed to tighten the bolt to a point that the bolt<br>
yields plastically. As the bolt is taken to such high levels of tension, the threaded<br>
member sees very high shear loads, ultimately to the point of the threads of the<br>
threaded member yielding, starting in most cases with the most highly loaded top<br>
thread as discussed above. When the threads of the threaded member are at or<br>
near yield, they are susceptible to creep and further yield due to service loads.<br>
Yield and creep are both contributors to load loss and ultimate joint failure.<br>
Therefore, to improve the clamp load retention of a joint, it is desirable to reduce<br>
the sensitivity to changes in the relative pitch that occur between the bolt and the<br>
threaded member that cause uneven load distribution.<br>
[0006] Additionally, the current standard thread form or pattern is<br>
optimized for applications where steel bolts are engaging steel internal threads.<br><br>
However, current applications can call for the use of steel bolts into weaker<br>
materials, such as aluminum or other materials. These different materials have<br>
different properties, such as different thread stiffness, which can cause the stiffer<br>
threads to unevenly distribute loads on the less stiff threads. Moreover, the<br>
different materials can have different coefficients of thermal expansion. As a<br>
result, the bolt and threaded member can have different growths for the same<br>
temperature. The different growths can change the relative pitch of the bolt and<br>
threaded member as they grow and can change the initial distribution of loads<br>
and can promote uneven distribution of the load. The different growths can also<br>
cause stress concentrations and plastic yield that can increase susceptibility to<br>
load loss under service. Furthermore, the location of the bolt and threaded<br>
member relative to a heat source can also effect their growth relative to one<br>
another over time. For example, the component closer to the source of thermal<br>
heat may experience a temperature increase prior to the other component,<br>
thereby causing the first component to begin expanding prior to the second<br>
component expanding. This temporal aspect of temperature change can be<br>
exacerbated by the use of different materials having different coefficients of<br>
thermal expansion. Therefore, it is desirable to reduce the sensitivity of the load<br>
distribution to changes in the dimensions of the bolt and the threaded member.<br>
[0007] Accordingly, it would be desirable to develop a new thread form<br>
or pattern that addresses the above desires and concerns. Furthermore, in some<br>
applications it would be desirable if the new thread form were able to<br>
substantially maintain the core axial stiffness (minor diameter) of the bolt thereby<br><br>
avoiding increased variation in the relative pitch during assembly. Furthermore, it<br>
would be desirable if the new thread form could maintain a sufficient contact area<br>
between the internal and external threads to prevent compressive yield on the<br>
sides (also known as flanks) of the weaker threads. Additionally, it would be<br>
advantageous to maintain the ability to manufacture such a thread form with<br>
standard manufacturing techniques, such as standard roll forming. Moreover, it<br>
would be desirable if the thread form maintained the ability to gage the thread<br>
form using existing gages for quality control without causing an increase in cost<br>
to make new gages for the new thread form. It would be further advantageous if<br>
the new thread form could be used in conjunction with an existing typical prior art<br>
thread form, thereby facilitating retrofitting with the new thread form.<br>
SUMMARY<br>
[0008] To address these desires, the inventors have developed a new<br>
approach to bolt design using deviations from the typical 60° thread forms<br>
commonly in use. This approach breaks the normal coupling between bolt and<br>
thread stiffness inherent in a fixed 60° thread form bolt design. The new thread<br>
form can reduce the sensitivity to changes in the relative pitch that occur<br>
between a bolt and the threaded member that cause uneven load distribution.<br>
The thread form can provide a controlled thread stiffness which can more evenly<br>
distribute loads and can be less sensitive to changes in relative pitch. The thread<br>
form is especially applicable to applications of bolts and threaded members of<br>
different materials, such as a steel bolt and an aluminum threaded member. The<br><br>
thread form can reduce the stiffness of the thread from that of a standard thread<br>
form and can be used to more uniformly distribute loads into the weaker threads.<br>
[0009] In some applications, the improved thread form can<br>
substantially maintain the core stiffness by substantially maintaining the minor<br>
diameter, which can avoid increased variation in relative pitch during assembly.<br>
In other applications, the core stiffness can be reduced while still achieving a<br>
reduction in the bending stiffness of the threads of the thread form, depending on<br>
the loading in a given application.<br>
[0010] The controlled stiffness of the thread in the new thread form can<br>
provide a desired cantilever bending of the thread under assembled loads. The<br>
thread form can utilize a traditional thread form at and/or above the pitch<br>
diameter thereby keeping the area of contact close to that of a standard thread<br>
form. The slight change to the contact area and the location of contact can<br>
advantageously help bending of the thread form in that the load is applied further<br>
away from the root of the thread. The thread form can maintain desired root<br>
radii, thereby achieving a desired fatigue resistance. The thread form may be<br>
able to use standard gaging for ascertaining the thread pitch diameter and for<br>
quality control purposes. The new thread form can mate with existing typical<br>
prior art thread forms, thereby facilitating retrofitting with the new thread form.<br>
[0011] A thread form according to the present teachings includes a<br>
helically extending thread, a crest, a root, and a side extending between the crest<br>
and the root. The side has a first portion extending from the crest toward the root<br>
and a second portion extending from the first portion toward the root. The first<br><br>
and second portions extend toward the root in different orientations relative to the<br>
thread. The thread form can be on a bolt that extends through a first aperture in<br>
a first member and that extends at least partially into a second aperture in a<br>
second member. The bolt can axially load the first and second members and<br>
retain the first and second members together.<br>

description provided herein. It should be understood that the description and<br>
specific examples are intended for purposes of illustration only and are not<br>

DETAILED DESCRIPTION<br>
[0024] The following description is merely exemplary in nature and is<br>
not intended to limit the present disclosure, application, or uses. It should be<br><br>
understood that throughout the drawings, corresponding reference numerals<br>
indicate like or corresponding parts and features (e.g., 22, 122, 222, etc.).<br>
[0025] A bolt 20 having a thread form or pattern 22 according to the<br>
present teachings is shown in Figure 1. Bolt 20 includes a head 24 and a shank<br>
26 between head 24 and thread form 22. It should be appreciated, however, that<br>
thread form 22 can extend all the way up to head 24.<br>
[0026] Referring now to Figure 2, an enlarged fragmented cross-<br>
sectional view of a portion of thread form 22 of Figure 1 is shown. Thread form<br>
22 includes a thread 28 that extends helically along bolt 20. Thread 28 includes<br>
a crest 30 and a root 32. Crest 30 defines the major diameter d of bolt 20 while<br>
root 32 defines the minor diameter d3 of bolt 20. Thread 28 includes a pair of<br>
sides (or flanks) 34 that extend from crest 30 to adjacent roots 32. The pitch<br>
diameter d2 of thread form 22 is represented by line 36. The pitch diameter d2 is<br>
defined as the diameter of an imaginary cylinder, the surface of which would<br>
pass through the threads at such points as to make equal the width of the<br>
threads and the width of the spaces cut by the surface of the cylinder. Sides 34<br>
each include a first portion 38 and a second portion 40. In thread form 22,<br>
portions 38, 40 of adjacent facing sides 34 each have an included angle a that<br>
differ from one another. Specifically, first portions 38 of adjacent sides 34 have a<br>
first included angle  of a first value while the second portions 40 of adjacent<br>
sides 34 have a second included angle α2 of a different, lesser value. For<br>
example, angle α1 can be 60° while angle α2 can be 50°. Each side 34 can have<br>
a transition point 42 wherein side 34 transitions between first portion 38 and<br><br>
second portion 40. In the example shown, transition point 42 is located at a<br>
diameter less than pitch diameter 36 (below pitch diameter line 36 in the<br>
orientation shown in Figure 2). The transition of second portion 40 to root 32 can<br>
be rounded with a radius of curvature r1. First and second portions 38, 40 can<br>
form an entirety of side 34.<br>
[0027] Referring now to Figure 10, an enlarged fragmented cross-<br>
sectional view of a standard prior art thread form 60 is shown. Thread form 60<br>
includes a thread 62 that extends helically. Thread 62 includes a crest 64, a root<br>
66, and a pair of flanks or sides 68 extending from crest 64 to adjacent roots 66.<br>
In the prior art thread form 60, side 68 has an included angle β which is<br>
substantially constant from crest 64 to root 66. Typically, angle β is 60°. The<br>
sides 68 do not have a transition wherein the included angle β is changed as side<br>
68 extends from crest 64 to root 66. Thread 62 has a pitch diameter represented<br>
by line 70. Thread form 60 is shown as being an external thread form such as<br>
that which would be used on a bolt or stud (not shown).<br>
[0028] In the typical standard thread forms, the contact of the external<br>
and internal threads occurs along sides 68 of the two threads between the crests<br>
and the roots. The radial depth of engagement, however, does not extend all the<br>
way between the crests and roots. Rather, a majority of the contact occurs along<br>
sides 68 outward of pitch diameter 70 (above pitch diameter 70 in the orientation<br>
depicted in Figure 10). It should be appreciated that the transition from sides 68<br>
to root 66 in the prior art thread form 60 may be slightly rounded due to<br>
specifications, manufacturing techniques, and/or tool wear.<br><br>
[0029] Referring now to Figure 3, an overlay of prior art thread form 60<br>
onto thread form 22 is shown. Prior art thread form 60 is represented by the<br>
dashed line in Figure 3. As shown, crest 64 of prior art thread form 60 is<br>
substantially the same as crest 30 of thread form 22. Root 66 of thread form 60<br>
is substantially aligned with root 32 of thread form 22. Additionally, sides 68 of<br>
thread form 60 are substantially the same as first portions 38 of sides 34 of<br>
thread form 22. However, second portion 40 of sides 34 of thread form 22 does<br>
not align with sides 68 of thread form 60 due to the change in the included angle.<br>
The space 74 between sides 68 of thread form 60 and second portion 40 of side<br>
34 of thread form 22 represents the material removed from the standard prior art<br>
thread form 60 to form thread form 22. Space 74 can occur within pitch diameter<br>
36, 70 (below in the orientation depicted in Figure 3). Thus, thread form 22 is<br>
substantially similar to thread form 60 above pitch diameter 36 while below pitch<br>
diameter 36 it is substantially different with sides 34 changing their included<br>
angle α2 at transition point 42. Additionally, when thread form 22 is<br>
manufactured, the transition between side 34 and root 32 can have a radius of<br>
curvature r1 that is larger than that of thread form 60 (which may have no radius<br>
of curvature or a small radius of curvature due to tooling wear)<br>
[0030] By limiting the differences between thread form 22 and the<br>
standard prior art thread form 60 to changes that occur inside pitch diameter 36,<br>
desirable aspects of the standard thread form can be maintained. For example,<br>
gages designed for measuring standard prior art thread forms 60 can be used to<br>
measure thread form 22 due to the gages engaging with and measuring portions<br><br>
of thread form 22 outside of pitch diameter 36. Additionally, as stated above, a<br>
majority of the engagement between thread 62 of standard thread form 60 occurs<br>
at and/or outside of pitch diameter 70. As a result, thread form 22 can realize a<br>
majority of the engagement between its sides 34 of thread 28 with the sides of a<br>
standard internal thread form. It should be appreciated that second portions 40<br>
of sides 34 of thread form 22 may not engage with the sides of the standard<br>
thread form due to the change in the included angle α2. As a result, the contact<br>
between sides 34 of thread form 22 with the sides of a standard thread form may<br>
be limited to the first portion 38.<br>
[0031] By adjusting the location of transition point 42, the amount and<br>
location of contact between thread 28 of thread form 22 and the thread of a<br>
standard thread form can be achieved. As a result, the area of contact can be<br>
maintained close to that of a standard thread form. Additionally, the slight<br>
change to the area and location of contact can advantageously facilitate the<br>
bending of threads 28 of thread form 22 during initial loading in that all of the load<br>
is applied further from the root 32 of thread 28.<br>
[0032] The removal of material from thread form 22 below transition<br>
point 42 can advantageously reduce the stiffness of thread 28 of thread form 22<br>
in its cantilever bending mode under assembled loading. The reduced stiffness<br>
of thread 28 of thread form 22 can more evenly distribute loads and is less<br>
sensitive to changes in relative pitch. That is, as the differing threaded materials<br>
(the engaged male and female threads) deflect, yield, and/or creep, the<br>
additional flexibility of threads 28 of thread form 22 can accommodate this<br><br>
relative pitch change while maintaining a more evenly distributed loading<br>
between the engaged thread forms. Additionally, when materials having different<br>
thermal expansion properties are used for the differing thread forms, the ability of<br>
thread 28 of thread form 22 to be more flexible (less stiff) than that of a standard<br>
thread form can accommodate the differing thermal expansion properties and<br>
maintain a more even distribution of the loading between the engaged thread<br>
forms. Thus, the changes in the relative pitch of the engaged thread forms can<br>
be more easily accommodated by the more flexible thread 28 of thread form 22<br>
than between prior art standard thread forms which have stiffer characteristics for<br>
the same material.<br>
[0033] Additionally, thread form 22 can also maintain the core stiffness<br>
of bolt 20 by maintaining the dimensions of the minor diameter. As a result, the<br>
maintaining of the axial stiffness can avoid increased variation in relative pitch<br>
during assembly. The radius of the transition from second portion 40 of side 34<br>
to root 32 can be chosen to maintain or increase the fatigue life of thread form 22<br>
for use in highly loaded applications.<br>
[0034] Thus, a bolt 20 having a thread form 22 according to the present<br>
teachings can provide improved joint performance. As a result, highly stressed<br>
joints can have less clamp load loss when using a bolt having a thread form 22<br>
according to the present teachings. Thread form 22 can substantially maintain<br>
the overall axial stiffness of bolt 20 while allowing local accommodation of pitch<br>
mismatch by bending of thread 28 of thread form 22 due to its reduced stiffness.<br>
This reduced stiffness can enhance the yield, creep, and fatigue performance in<br><br>
highly stressed joints. As a result, thread form 22 is more compliant which can<br>
accommodate local pitch mismatches due to manufacturing of the threads,<br>
assembly of the threads, and the in-service thermal loads and applied load<br>
variations on the threads.<br>
[0035] Alternatively, as shown in Figure 4, a second embodiment of a<br>
thread form according to the present teachings can have a reduced core stiffness<br>
by reducing the dimensions of the minor diameter In Figure 4, an overlay of<br>
prior art thread form 60 onto a modified thread form 422 is shown. Again, prior<br>
art thread form 60 is represented by the dashed line in Figure 4. As shown, crest<br>
64 of prior art thread form 60 is substantially the same as crest 430 of thread<br>
form 422. Root 66 of thread form 60, however, is not aligned with root 432 of<br>
thread form 422. Rather, root 432 and the associated minor diameter d3 are<br>
substantially reduced (below in the view depicted in Figure 4) relative to root 66<br>
and the associated minor diameter d3 standard of thread form 60. Sides 68 of<br>
thread form 60 are still substantially the same as first portions 438 of sides 434 of<br>
thread form 422. Second portion 440 of sides 434 of thread form 422 again does<br>
not align with sides 68 of thread form 60 due to the change in the included angle<br>
at transition point 442. The increased depth of root 432 and the change in the<br>
included angle result in the space 474 between sides 68 of thread form 60 and<br>
second portion 440 of side 434 of thread form 422 being larger than that shown<br>
in Figure 3. Thus, thread form 422 is again substantially similar to thread form 60<br>
above pitch diameter line 436, while below pitch diameter line 436 is<br><br>
substantially different with sides 434 changing their included angle a402 at<br>
transition point 442.<br>
[0036] The deeper root 432 of thread form 422 in conjunction with the<br>
removal of material from thread form 422 below transition point 442 can<br>
advantageously reduce the stiffness of thread 428 of thread form 422 in its<br>
cantilever bending mode under assembled loading. The deeper root 432<br>
reduces the core stiffness of a bolt having thread form 422 by reducing the<br>
dimensions of the minor diameter d3. The decreased minor diameter can provide<br>
better load loss performance despite reducing the core stiffness. The degree to<br>
which the core stiffness of a bolt having thread form 422 is maintained or<br>
reduced can be dependent on the needs of a given joint in which thread form 422<br>
is to be used. As a result, thread form 422 allows the ability to independently<br>
adjust the root 432 (minor diameter d3) relative to the pitch diameter d2. This<br>
independent ability allows a tradeoff to be made between the advantage of a<br>
large minor diameter and the advantage of a smaller minor diameter. A smaller<br>
minor diameter may have higher initial loading in the first thread at tightening, but<br>
will have more compliance thread to thread. As a result, the smaller minor<br>
diameter will be less sensitive to changes in thermal stresses when the mating<br>
threads are dissimilar or expand at different rates due to their proximity to a<br>
source of heat. Accordingly, thread form 422 can change the core stiffness of a<br>
bolt by reducing the dimensions of the minor diameter.<br>
[0037] Referring now to Figure 5, a third embodiment of a thread form<br>
122 according to the present teachings is shown. Thread form 122 includes a<br><br>
thread 128 with a crest 130, a root 132, and a pair of sides 134 extending<br>
therebetween. Crest 130 also represents the major diameter d of thread form<br>
122 while root 132 represents the minor diameter d3 of thread form 122. The<br>
pitch diameter d2 of thread form 122 is represented by line 136. Side 134<br>
includes first and second portions 138, 140 that have differing included angles<br>
α101, α102 that change at transition point 142. Included angle α101 is greater than<br>
included angle α102. For example, in Figure 5, included angle α101 can be 60°<br>
while included angle α102 can be 25°. Transition point 142 can be within (below<br>
in the orientation depicted in Figure 5) pitch diameter 136. Additionally, the<br>
radius of transition from second portion 140 of side 134 to root 132 can have a<br>
value r101 that is greater than r1 of thread form 22. Radius of curvature r101 can<br>
be selected to achieve a desired fatigue resistance for a bolt incorporating a<br>
thread form 122. As a result, thread form 122 can have the same or similar<br>
advantages to those described above with reference to thread form 22 in that the<br>
sides 134 include first and second portions 138, 140 with differing included<br>
angles α101, α102 such that a stiffness of thread 128 can be reduced over a thread<br>
having a standard thread form.<br>
[0038] Referring now to Figure 6, a fourth embodiment of a thread form<br>
222 according to the present teachings is shown. Thread form 222 is similar to<br>
thread form 22 and has a thread 228 with a crest 230, a root 232, and a pair of<br>
sides 234 extending therebetween. Crest 230 also represents the major<br>
diameter d of thread form 222 while root 232 represents the minor diameter d3 of<br>
thread form 222. The pitch diameter d2 of thread form 222 is represented by line<br><br>
236. Again, side 234 includes a first portion 238 and a second portion 240<br>
whose relative shapes change at transition point 242. Second portion 240 in<br>
thread form 222 in axial cross-section does not extend linearly, as done in thread<br>
forms 22 and 122. Rather, second portion 240 in axial cross-section is a curved<br>
surface with a radius of curvature r202 which also results in thread 228 having a<br>
lower stiffness than a thread formed from a standard prior art thread form 60.<br>
Again, transition point 242 can be located within (below in the orientation<br>
depicted in Figure 6) pitch diameter 236. Second portion 240 can transition into<br>
root 232 such that the transition has a radius of curvature r201. It should be<br>
appreciated, however, that the transition of second portion 240 into root 232 can<br>
have a different radius of curvature r201 greater or less than that of radius of<br>
curvature r202. Thread form 222 provides some of the same and/or similar<br>
advantages discussed above with reference to thread form 22 in that second<br>
portion 240 changes orientation relative to first portion 238 thereby providing<br>
thread 228 with a controlled stiffness that is less than that of a thread 62 of a<br>
standard thread form 60. As a result of the greater flexibility of thread 228, a<br>
more compliant thread form 222 is achieved with the advantages discussed<br>
above.<br>
[0039] Referring now to Figure 7, a fifth embodiment of a thread form<br>
322 according to the present teachings is shown. Thread form 322 is similar to<br>
thread form 22 and has a thread 328 with a crest 330, a root 332, and a pair of<br>
sides 334 extending therebetween. Crest 330 also represents the major<br>
diameter d of thread form 322, while root 332 represents the minor diameter d3 of<br><br>
thread form 322. The pitch diameter d2 of thread form 322 is represented by line<br>
336. Again, each side 334 includes a first portion 338 and a second portion 340<br>
whose relative shapes change at transition point 342. In thread form 322,<br>
however, the first portions of sides 334 extending from the same crest 330 are<br>
not symmetrical as they extend toward adjacent roots 332. Rather, first portion<br>
338a of a first side 334a extends from a crest 330 toward a root 332 at flank<br>
angle Γ1 of a first value while a first portion 338b of a second side 334b extends<br>
from the same crest 330 toward an adjacent root 332 at a flank angle Γ2 of a<br>
second value different from the first value. As a result, first portions 338a, 338b<br>
are asymmetric relative to a radial line 396 which extends perpendicular to the<br>
pitch diameter 336 through the center of the same crest 330. The flank angle Γ is<br>
defined as the angle between the flank and the radial line which extends<br>
perpendicular to the pitch diameter through the center of the associated crest.<br>
Thus, the flank angle in the case of symmetrical threads would be the same as<br>
one half of the included angle. Flank angles Γ1, Γ2 can have a variety of values.<br>
For example, flank angle Γ1 can be 30° while flank angle Γ2 can be 20°, by way of<br>
non-limiting example.<br>
[0040] In contrast to the asymmetric nature of first portions 338a, 338b,<br>
second portions 340 of sides 334 can be symmetric and extend from transition<br>
point 342 to root 332 with an included angle α302. Included angle α302 can have a<br>
variety of values. For example, included angle α302 can be 50° by way of non-<br>
limiting example. In some embodiments, second portions 340 of sides 334 may<br>
be asymmetric.<br><br>
[0041] Transition point 342 can be located within (below in the view<br>
depicted in Figure 7) pitch diameter 336. Second portion 340 can transition into<br>
root 332 such that the transition has a radius of curvature r301. Thread form 322<br>
provides some of the same and/or similar advantages discussed above with<br>
reference to thread form 22 in that second portion 340 changes orientation<br>
relative to first portion 338, thereby providing thread 328 with a controlled<br>
stiffness that can be less than that of a thread 62 of a standard thread form 60.<br>
Additionally, the asymmetric features of the first portions 338a, 338b of sides<br>
334a, 334b allow a weakening of the bending stiffness of thread 328 without<br>
changing the core stiffness of a bolt having thread form 322 thereon and can<br>
provide further control and reduction in the stiffness. As a result of the greater<br>
flexibility of thread 328, a more compliant thread form 322 can be achieved.<br>
[0042] The thread forms 22, 122, 222, 322, 422 according to the<br>
present teachings can be used in a number of applications. These thread forms<br>
are particularly applicable to highly loaded joints. For example; as shown in<br>
Figures 8 and 9, a bolt 20 having a thread form 22 thereon can be used to retain<br>
a crankshaft bearing cap 84 to an engine block 86. Engine block 86 and bolt 20<br>
can be made of different materials, such as an aluminum engine block and a<br>
steel bolt by way of non-limiting example. The two different metals have differing<br>
thermal coefficients of expansion and, as a result, the thread forms of the present<br>
teachings can advantageously be used on bolt 20 to provide a more compliant<br>
joint that is less susceptible to deflection, yield, creep and/or failure due to the<br>
differing thermal expansion rates during operation. As shown in Figure 8, engine<br><br>
block 86 can have an internal thread form 60 which is a standard internal thread<br>
form while bolt 20 can have thread form 22 according to the present teachings.<br>
[0043] Another exemplary application within which a bolt 20 having a<br>
thread form 22, 122, 222, 322, 422 according to the present teachings can be<br>
advantageously employed includes the securing of a cylinder head 90 to engine<br>
block 86. Engine block 86 can have one or more internally threaded bores 92<br>
with a standard prior art internal thread form 60. Again, engine block 86 and bolt<br>
20 can be differing materials, such as aluminum and steel, respectively, by way<br>
of non-limiting example. The use of a bolt 20 having a thread form according to<br>
the present teachings can advantageously provide a more compliant joint that<br>
can accommodate the differing thermal expansion rates of the engine block 86<br>
and bolt 20, thereby better retaining the clamp load over its service life.<br>
[0044] Another advantage of using a bolt 20 having a thread form 22,<br>
122, 222, 322, 422 according to the present teachings is that the bolt can be<br>
advantageously retrofitted into an existing threaded member having a typical<br>
prior art internal thread form. Specifically, a bolt having a standard thread form<br>
and engaged with a standard internal threaded member can be removed<br>
therefrom and replaced with a bolt 20 having a thread form according to the<br>
present teachings. The replacement bolt utilizing the thread forms of the present<br>
teachings, as stated above, can engage with and be used with the threaded<br>
member having the standard thread form. This capability allows for the joint<br>
formed therebetween to be more compliant by realizing a controlled stiffness of<br>
the threads of the thread form according to the present teachings. In this<br><br>
manner, an improvement in a compliance of an existing joint can be realized.<br>
This can be done without requiring modification of the threads of the threaded<br>
member into which the bolt having a thread form according to the present<br>
teachings is to be engaged. Thus, two different thread forms, a thread form<br>
according to the present teachings and a typical prior art thread form, can be<br>
utilized together to realize an improved compliance of the joint formed<br>
therebetween by retrofitting a bolt having a prior art thread form with one having<br>
a thread form according to the present teachings.<br>
[0045] While the present teachings have been described with reference<br>
to specific examples and illustrations, it should be appreciated that these<br>
examples and illustrations are merely exemplary in nature and that deviations<br>
and changes from the configurations shown can be employed and are still within<br>
the scope of the present teachings. For example, the specific included angles<br>
and flank angles can vary from those shown and discussed. Additionally, the<br>
radius of curvature r202 of second portion 240 of thread form 222 can also vary<br>
from that shown. Additionally, the location of transition points 42, 142, 242, 342,<br>
442 relative to the associated pitch diameter 36, 136, 236, 336, 436 can also<br>
vary from that shown. It should be appreciated, however, that if the transition<br>
point occurs above the associated pitch diameter, all the advantages of the<br>
thread forms of the present teachings may not be realized. Furthermore, it<br>
should be appreciated that transition points 42, 142, 242, 342, 442 can be<br>
smooth and/or rounded due to manufacturing process, to control stress<br>
concentrations, or for other considerations. Additionally, it should also be<br><br>
appreciated that the minor diameter of a thread form according to the present<br>
teachings can vary from that of a standard thread form. Moreover, while the<br>
present thread form is shown as used on a bolt as an external thread form, it<br>
should be appreciated that the thread form can also be used as an internal<br>
thread form such as in a nut or in a threaded bore. Furthermore, while the<br>
present thread form is shown as used on a bolt, the thread form can be used on<br>
other components having an external thread form, such as a stud and the like.<br>
Additionally, it should be appreciated that the present thread forms can be<br>
formed and used as left or right-handed threads. Moreover, it should also be<br>
appreciated that while the thread form according to the present teachings is<br>
shown and discussed as engaging with a standard prior art thread form, two<br>
complementary thread forms according to the present teachings can engage with<br>
one another (as external and internal threads) to clamp a highly loaded joint.<br>
Furthermore, while the first and second portions of the side of the thread form<br>
according to the present teachings are shown as extending toward the root in<br>
different orientations relative to the thread, it should be appreciated that these<br>
orientations are merely exemplary and that deviations and changes in these<br>
orientations can also be utilized. Accordingly, such changes in deviation should<br>
be considered as being within the scope of the present teachings.<br><br>

The thread form can provide a controlled thread stiffness which can more evenly distribute loads and can be less sensitive to changes in relative pitch. The controlled stiffness of the thread can provide a desired cantilever bending of<br>
the thread under assembled load. The thread form can utilize a traditional thread form at and/or above the pitch diameter, thereby maintaining the area of contact close to that of a standard thread form. Standard gaging implements can be<br>
used to ascertain the thread pitch and for quality control. The thread form includes a side extending between the crest and the root. The side has a first portion extending from the crest toward the root and the second portion<br>
extending from the first portion toward the root. The first and second portions extend toward the root in different orientations relative to the thread.</td>
