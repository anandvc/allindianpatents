				<td>PREPARATION OF NUTRIENT RICH SALT OF PLANT ORIGIN<br>
Technical Field<br>
The present invention relates to preparation of salt of plant origin.<br>
Specifically, the invention relates to preparation of nutritious salt formulations from<br>
edible salt tolerant oil-bearing plants in a manner that allows maximum utilization of<br>
the plant.<br>
Background Art<br>
Salt is used as a food supplement to enhance the taste of food. Salt is one of<br>
the few commodities that are being universally consumed by almost all sections of<br>
communities irrespective of socio-economic status. It is consumed approximately at a<br>
level of 5-15 grams/day/person throughout the year. Hence salt is an attractive<br>
vehicle to introduce any nutrient supplement (M.G. Venkatesh Mannar, S.Jaipal and<br>
C.S.Pandya, Proceedings of Sixth. International Congress, Seoul, 1989). For<br>
example, salt is iodized for the control of goiter and it is fortified with iron for control<br>
of anemia. Salt is also a good vehicle for supply of other nutrients such as potassium,<br>
magnesium and calcium.<br>
Reference may be made to Shuqing Wang in patent no. CN 1271541 A, 1<br>
November 2000, entitled "Multi-element low sodium nutritive salt", who disclosed<br>
the preparation of low sodium nutritive salt by crystallising salt from saturated brine<br>
under vacuum. The salt is then mixed uniformly with salts such as KC1 and<br>
MgSO4.7H2O, followed by mixing with KlOa and Na2SeO3 solutions, drying and<br>
finally mixing with active Ca and Zn lactate. The drawback of this process is that<br>
apart from the difficulty of mixing various constituents in a homogeneous solid<br>
mixture, salt is to be crystallised from hot saturated brine involving high energy<br>
consumption thereby increasing the cost of production. Moreover, such a salt is not<br>
natural in its constitution.<br>
Reference may be made to "The Heinz Handbook of Nutrition" by Benjamin<br>
T. Burton, published for H. J. Heinz Co., by McGraw Hill Book Co. Second Edition,<br>
1965, page 132-133, which describes the dietary need for potassium.<br>
Reference may be made to R. N. Vohra et al. in pending PCT Patent<br>
Application No.PCT/IN02/00018, dated 31.1.2002 entitled "A Process for Recovery<br>
of Low sodium Salt from Bittern", who disclosed the preparation of a mixture of<br>
sodium chloride and potassium chloride containing other nutrients such as magnesium<br>
and calcium by a natural process from sea/sub-soil bittern. The main drawback of the<br>
process is that the salt does not contain any micronutrients.<br>
Reference may be made to Rock Salt, e.g., the brand "Real Salt" being sold in<br>
the U. S. market, which contains several essential micronutrients such as iron,<br>
manganese and iodine but which does not contain appreciable quantities of important<br>
essential nutrients such as potassium, calcium, magnesium and zinc. Moreover, Rock<br>
salt is available only in very limited regions of the world.<br>
Reference may be made to Charnock, A. [(1988, December). Plants with a<br>
taste for salt. New Scientist, 3, pp. 41, 45] and E. P. Glenn, et al, [(1991) Salicornia<br>
bigelovii Torr.: An oilseed halophyte for seawater irrigation. Science, 251, 1065-67]<br>
who have described cultivation of salt tolerant plants as a potential economic activity<br>
utilizing saline wasteland and seawater irrigation. Although it is described in the<br>
publications that halophytes such as Salicornia are especially suitable for production<br>
of nutritious edible oil with high level of polyunsaturates, deoiled poultry feed, and<br>
fodder that is suitable for cattle either as a mixed feed or which can be used alone<br>
after desalinating the fodder by washing, no mention is made with regards to recovery<br>
of salt from the plant.<br>
Reference may be made to M. P. Reddy, et al, Biol. Plant. 1993, 35, 547-553,<br>
who reported that halophytes possess the ability to concentrate salts of sodium,<br>
potassium, calcium, magnesium and to some extent micronutrients equaling or<br>
exceeding those of sea water in their leaves and stem when grown in saline conditions<br>
without adverse effects on growth and biomass production. However no attempt was<br>
made to produce salt. No attempt was also made to bias the composition of salts in<br>
the plant.<br>
G. Naidoo and R.Rughunanan in J. Exp. Bot., 1990, 41, 497-502, have studied<br>
the salt tolerance of Sarcocornia natalensis by irrigating the plants with different<br>
concentrations (50 to 300 moles/m3) of NaCl and examining the differences in ion<br>
content of the plants. No attempt was made to produce salt.<br>
T. J. Flowers and Y.Yeo mAust.J. Plant Physiol. 1986, 13, 75-81, have stated<br>
that the dicotyledonous halophytes accumulate sodium and chloride ions to an extent<br>
of 30-50% by dry weight to maintain osmotic potential at higher salinity level. No<br>
attempt was made to produce salt.<br>
Though it was known (T. F. Neals and P. J. Sharkey, Aust. J. Plant Physiol,<br>
1981, 8, 165-179, S.Cherian et al, Indian J. Plant Physiol, 1999, 4, 266-270,<br>
S.Cherian and M.P.Reddy, Indian J. Plant Physiol, 2000, 5, 32-37 etc.) that certain<br>
halophytes accumulate reasonable amount of sodium, potassium, calcium and<br>
magnesium, the main focus of the work was to undertake mechanistic studies and<br>
none of the above attempted to produce nutrient rich salt from such plants.<br>
Objects of the invention<br>
The main object of the present invention is to provide a process for the<br>
preparation of salt from salt tolerant plants that accumulate high quantity of salt.<br>
Another object of the present invention is to prepare a nutritious edible salt<br>
containing other essential minerals such as potassium, calcium, magnesium, copper,<br>
iron, manganese and zinc.<br>
Yet another objective of the present invention is to enrich the plants with<br>
iodine by utilizing iodide-containing solid or liquid waste as co-irrigant or by using<br>
iodine-rich seaweeds as manure.<br>
Another object is to promote such cultivation of salt tolerant plants in solar<br>
salt works where sea water and the waste bittern obtained as by-product of salt<br>
manufacture are used in combination for irrigation of the plants to enhance, in<br>
particular, the potassium content of the salt.<br>
Yet, another object of the invention relates to recovery of both oil and salt<br>
from salt-tolerant oil-bearing plants.<br>
Summary of the invention<br>
The present invention relates to development of a process for the preparation<br>
of nutrient-rich salt of plant origin, specifically salt tolerant oil-bearing plants that can<br>
be cultivated with sea water/salt bitterns and have a propensity to accumulate salt<br>
within their tissues. The invention allows nutrient-rich salt to be obtained naturally<br>
instead of through artificial mixing of nutrients as resorted to in the prior art. An<br>
additional aspect of the invention is that potassium-rich waste bittern of solar salt<br>
works can be utilised as nutrient supplement during irrigation to enhance the<br>
potassium content of the salt, besides increasing the proportions of other essential<br>
minerals like magnesium, copper, iron, iodine, manganese, and zinc. Another aspect<br>
is the utilization of by-product or waste iodide containing solids or liquids as coirrigant<br>
to enhance iodine content in the plant. A further aspect of the invention is<br>
that the process of recovery of salt does not interfere with the recovery of oil from the<br>
plant.<br>
It has been found that the halophytic plant species take up different metal salts<br>
by absorption when irrigated with sea or saline water and accumulate about 30-55%<br>
inorganic salts by dry weight in leaves and stem and the composition of salts can be<br>
adjusted utilizing waste bittern of salt industry as a co-irrigant. The salt can be<br>
obtained in crude or refined form and contains mainly sodium chloride besides<br>
essential minerals.<br>
Detailed description of the invention<br>
Accordingly, the present invention provides a process for the preparation of<br>
nutrient rich herbal salt from edible halophytic plant species which are salt tolerant<br>
and oil bearing plants, said process comprising steps of:<br>

evaporating the solution to obtain fine white crystalline and free<br>
flowing refined herbal salt.<br>
In an embodiment of the invention, the crude herbal salt is alternatively<br>
obtained by treating the dry biomass devoid of seeds with hot water, decanting and<br>
solar evaporating the leachate to recover salt rich in both inorganic and organic<br>
nutrients.<br>
Another embodiment the salt tolerant plant oil bearing edible halophytic plants<br>
in step (a) are selected from Salicornia brachiata and Suaeda nudiflora.<br>
Still another embodiment, the irrigation of plants in step (a) are carried out by<br>
using a mixture of waste salt bitterns rich in potassium and magnesium having density<br>
in the range of 29°Be'-37 °Be' is added into sea water as an irrigant in the ratio<br>
ranging between 0:1 and 1:1.<br>
Still another embodiment of the invention, the plants are irrigated 1 to 10<br>
times in addition to routine sea water irrigation over the cultivation period of 3-8<br>
months to enrich the salt with potassium and other nutrients<br>
Yet another embodiment, other sources of potash fertilizer such as muriate of<br>
potash can be used in place of bittern for similar purpose.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention, the salt tolerant plants in step (a) are<br>
preferably selected from the group of plants that can be cultivated on saline soils with<br>
soil conductivity in the range 15-140 dSirf'and irrigated with saline water including<br>
sea water of 2.5-4.0 °Be' and salt bitterns of 29-37 °Be'.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention, the said salt tolerant plants<br>
accumulate up to 30-50 % salt in their tissues.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention, iodine source material used in step<br>
(b) is selected from a group consisting of iodide containing liquid or solid waste,<br>
iodine rich sea-weeds and iodine rich manure.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention, the crude herbal salt obtained in<br>
step (g) is naturally free flowing.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention, the refined herbal salt obtained in<br>
step (h) is naturally free flowing.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention, the incineration in step (f) is carried<br>
out for 1 to 6 hours at a temperature ranging between 300 and 600°C.<br>

manganese.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention, the fine white crystalline and free<br>
flowing salt of step (h) containing 70-90 % sodium chloride, 5-30% potassium<br>
chloride, 50-1000 ppm iron, and other essential nutrients.<br>
Yet another embodiment of the invention, the oil-containing seeds are<br>
removed from spikes by manually or mechanically so as to obtain biomass to produce<br>
herbal salts and essential oil simultaneously and thereby make cultivation of such<br>
plants more remunerative.<br>
The present invention provides a process for the preparation of nutrient rich<br>
salt from salt-tolerant oil-yielding plants by growing such plants on 15-140 dSirf'<br>
saline soils, irrigating with 2.5-4.0 °Be' seawater and 29°Be'-37 °Be' bittern in the<br>
ratio of 1:0 to 1:1; harvesting; co-irrigating with seawater and desired amount of<br>
iodide containing solid or liquid waste; alternatively, using iodine-rich seaweeds or<br>
other iodine-rich bio-sources as manure; washing with sea water; sun drying;<br>
separating seed from spikes, mixing the husk with the remaining biomass, charring in<br>
an open container; incinerating in a furnace at 300-600 °C to give crude, sterilized<br>
herbal salt containing 55%-75% sodium chloride, 3%-30% potassium chloride, 0.1-<br>
8.0% calcium, 0.2-7.0% magnesium, 10-150 ppm zinc, 100-1000 ppm iron, 5-50 ppm<br>
copper, 50-200 ppm manganese; dissolving the crude herbal salt in water; filtering<br>
and evaporating to give fine white crystalline and free flowing salt containing 70-90<br>
% sodium chloride, 5-30% potassium chloride, 50-1000 ppm iron, and other essential<br>
micronutrients.<br>
In an embodiment of the present invention, the edible halophytes, Salicornia<br>
brachiata and Suaeda nudiflora, were selected for the preparation of nutrient rich<br>
edible salt.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the soil having salinity<br>
ranging from 15-140 dSm"1 was used for growing the plants.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the seawater having density<br>
in the range of 2.5-4.0 °Be' was used for growing the plants.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the pH of the seawater used<br>
for irrigating the plants was in the range of 7.3-8.5.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, waste salt bitterns rich in K<br>
and Mg having density in the range of 29°Be'-37 °Be' was added into sea water as a<br>
co-irrigant up to a maximum extent of 50 % of total volume.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, iodide-containing salts were<br>
added into seawater as co-irrigant up to a maximum extent of 50-mM concentration of<br>
iodide to raise the iodine content of the plant.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the plant biomass was sun<br>
dried for a period of 4-7 days and the seeds were then removed manually from the<br>
spikes.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the total dry biomass after<br>
removal of seeds was ignited and charred in open container.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, charred biomass was<br>
incinerated for 3-10 hours in a furnace at 300 - 600°C to remove all organic matter<br>
and to sterilize the product.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention the crude salt was subjected to<br>
refinement in a conventional salt washery to purify the salt.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the crude salt was dissolved<br>
in water, the solution then filtered and evaporated to dryness to obtain white<br>
crystalline free flowing salt wherein all nutrients are retained.<br>
In another embodiment of the present invention, the dry biomass is treated<br>
with hot water, the solution decanted and solar evaporated to recover salt.<br>
Edible salt is normally prepared from seawater. Its production is based on<br>
solar evaporation. The other important sources are inland lakes, saline wells, rock salt<br>
(bedded deposits) and salt domes or diapers as solid salt. Although there has been a<br>
trend towards refined edible salt that is fortified with iodine for the prevention of<br>
goiter, and occasionally with iron for prevention of anemia, other important nutrients<br>
are virtually absent. Crude salt compositions such as rock salt are popular because of<br>
the presence of many essential nutrients essential for the body, e.g., Fe. I, Mn, Cu, Zn.<br>
However, the proportions of some of the nutrients is small, e.g., 0.05-0.6 % of K and<br>
1-5 ppm Zn. It has been found in the course of this invention that substantially higher<br>
amounts of such essential minerals accumulate in tissues of salt tolerant plants in<br>
addition to NaCl. Moreover, plants such as Salicornia and Sueda are edible and even<br>
available in markets as fresh vegetable in several countries. On the other hand, when<br>
the plants are dried, oil can be recovered from the seeds but the remaining dry<br>
biomass is normally unutilized. It occurred to the inventors that this biomass, which<br>
has accumulated salt and minerals, could be converted into nutrient-rich edible salts<br>
of different formulations. It further occurred to the inventors that, if such plants can<br>
be cultivated in the vicinity of solar salt works, the waste bitterns of the salt industry<br>
can be utilized as irrigant in combination with sea water to enhance the<br>
nutrient value of the salt since the bitterns are substantially more concentrated<br>
in potassium, magnesium, and micronutrients than the sea water alone, and the plants<br>
have sufficient tolerance to salinity to allow for the use of bittern. It further occurred<br>
that iodide-containing solid or liquid waste or iodine-containing bioresources such as<br>
certain seaweeds could be utilized to raise the iodine content of the plants.<br>
Halophytes are those which can thrive on sea water/saline soils and produce<br>
biomass. Such plants are, therefore, ideally suited for saline wasteland cultivation.<br>
The incentive for such cultivation would be high if a better remuneration can be<br>
realized from the produce. Salicornia, for example, yields an edible oil that is highly<br>
rich in polyunsaturates but the low yield of oil (typically 200-500 kg from 1000-2500<br>
kg of seed/hectare) may not make cultivation sufficiently attractive. To increase the<br>
attractiveness, it would be essential to realize a second product from the produce that<br>
is also potentially marketable. Since 10-20 tons of dry biomass of Salicornia can be<br>
produced per hectare of cultivation, and since 40-50 % of this biomass comprises salt,<br>
it is possible to obtain 4-10 tons of nutrient rich salt from the biomass. Being<br>
nutrient-rich, the salt should be sufficiently more valuable than ordinary solar salt and<br>
could be an attractive additional source of income in addition to the income from the<br>
oil.<br>
Salicornia brachiata, an annual erect branched herb, belonging to the family<br>
chenopodiaceae was selected to illustrate the invention in view of the high<br>
accumulation (45 % of dry weight) of salt, the known edible nature of the plant, the<br>
tolerance of the plant to sea water irrigation and even to bittern, and the high biomass<br>
(10-20 tons dry weight per hectare) obtained in planned cultivation with elite<br>
germplasm.<br>
Spikes obtained from elite germplasm of Salicornia brachiata were sown in<br>
about one acre saline soil in a coastal area inundated by seawater during high tides.<br>
Initially, the land was irrigated for one week with fresh water for easy germination,<br>
initial establishment and later with seawater for a period of six to eight months. The<br>
fully-grown plants were then harvested by uprooting, the roots were removed, the<br>
plants were washed thoroughly with seawater, and sun dried. The dried biomass could<br>
be spontaneously burnt and thereafter it was subjected to further incineration in a<br>
muffle furnace at 425°C. The crude salt obtained was then dissolved in minimum<br>
quantity of water and filtered to remove insolubles. The solution was then subjected<br>
to forced or solar evaporation to recover the salt and nutrients completely.<br>
Sodium and potassium were estimated by using Flame photometer, calcium<br>
and magnesium by the versinate method (Vogel, A text book of quantitative inorganic<br>
analysis, 1978, The ELBS edition, London, and chloride by titrating against silver<br>
nitrate (Volhard, Modern method of plant analysis, 1956, edited by K. Peach and<br>
M.V. Tracey, Vol-1, 487, Springer verlag, Berlin, Edinburgh). The salts were<br>
analyzed for copper, iron, manganese and zinc using x-ray fluorescence (XRF)<br>
spectroscopy by preparing solid pellets with the help of a binder. A similar procedure<br>
was followed to estimate micronutrients in the purified salt.<br>
The important innovative steps involved in the present invention are: (i)<br>
realization that salt can be recovered from salt tolerant plants in desired form, (ii)<br>
ensuring that the method of recovery is such that both oil and salt can be recovered<br>
from the dried biomass, (iii) growing the plants in the vicinity of solar salt works and<br>
using waste bitterns of the salt works as co-irrigant together with sea water to enhance<br>
the content of KC1 in the salt to levels as high as 20% and simultaneously providing<br>
other essential nutrients in significant quantities, (iv) supplementing the seawater with<br>
iodide-containing salts to raise the iodine content of the plant.<br>
The following examples are given by way of illustration and should not be<br>
construed to limit the scope of the present invention.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
Salicornia brachiata plant was washed thoroughly with seawater to remove adhering<br>
particles of dirt. The plant, which weighed 37.2 Kg, was sun dried till a constant<br>
weight of 6.01 Kg. was obtained. The dried mass was charred in an open container by<br>
igniting with a match stick and thereafter incinerated at 425°C for 3 h to obtain 2.84<br>
kg of crude salt which was grayish-brown in colour. The crude salt contained ca. 70<br>
% NaCl, 6 % KC1, 1.05% calcium, 1.32 % magnesium, 2.53% sulphate and 9 %<br>
insolubles. *<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
376 g of the crude salt of Example 1 was dissolved in 2 liters of distilled water and<br>
filtered. The filtrate was evaporated to dryness to yield 355 g of refined and free<br>
flowing salt which was white in colour and contained ca. 85% NaCl, 5.5 % KC1,<br>
1.53% calcium, 1.69% magnesium and 3.01% sulphate.<br>
EXAMPLE 3<br>
Salicornia brachiata grown in pots was irrigated with sea water for 3 months, and<br>
processed as per the procedure of EXAMPLE 1 to give crude salt with 61% NaCl and<br>
5.4%KC1.<br>
EXAMPLE 4<br>
Salicornia brachiata grown in pots was irrigated with seawater for 3 months and<br>
during the period three irrigations were given with a mixture of 31°Be' bittern and<br>
seawater in the<br>
ratio of 1:3. The plants were processed as per the procedure of EXAMPLE 1 to give<br>
crude salt containing 58.6% NaCl and 12.7% KC1. The salt was also analyzed by<br>
XRF for micronutrients and contained 576 ppm Fe, 88 ppm Mn, 73 ppm Zn and 17<br>
ppm Cu. The crude salt was refined as per the procedure of EXAMPLE 2 and the salt<br>
contained 81 % NaCl, 11 % KC1 and 66 ppm Fe.<br>
EXAMPLE 5<br>
Salicornia brachiata was cultivated in the field using seawater as irrigant. A single<br>
plant with dry weight of 427 g was harvested at maturity and seeds weighing 52 g<br>
were separated from the spikes. 15.76 g oil was recovered from the seeds through<br>
extraction with hexane. The remaining dry biomass weighing 361 g was processed as<br>
per the experimental procedure of EXAMPLES 1 and 2 to give 146 g of refined salt.<br>
EXAMPLE 6<br>
Dry biomass of Salicornia brachiata was obtained as described in the procedure of<br>
Example 1. The dry biomass was directly extracted with hot (60-70°C) water and<br>
chocolate colored salt with a "Bourne Vitae" type aroma was recovered from the<br>
aqueous solution upon evaporation of the extract. In addition to NaCl, KC1 and other<br>
inorganic nutrients, the salt contained 0.2% free amino acids as also proteins,<br>
carbohydrates, lipids and pigments in reasonable quantities.<br>
EXAMPLE 7<br>
Suaeda nudiflora plant growing wildly was collected and processed as per the<br>
example of EXAMPLE 1 to give 1.43 kg of fresh biomass from which 0.28 kg of dry<br>
biomass was obtained. 0.13 kg of crude salt was obtained from the dry biomass as<br>
per the procedure of EXAMPLE 1. The crude salt contained 70% NaCl and 6% K.C1.<br>
EXAMPLE 8<br>
Suaeda nudiflora grown in pots was irrigated and processed as per the procedure of<br>
EXAMPLE 4 and 250 g of fresh biomass was obtained which was sun dried to a<br>
constant dry weight (48.5 g). The dry biomass was treated as per the procedure of<br>
EXAMPLE 1 to yield 20 g of crude salt containing: 55% NaCl and 18% KC1. The<br>
salt was also analysed by XRF for micronutrients and contained 570 ppm Fe, 188<br>
ppm Mn, 128 ppm Zn and 13 ppm Cu. A further 20 g of crude salt was processed as<br>
per the procedure of EXAMPLE 2 to yield 18.2 g of refined salt containing 75% NaCl<br>
and 17%KC1.<br>
EXAMPLE 9<br>
Salicornia brachiata grown in pots was irrigated with 0.6 M sodium chloride<br>
supplemented with quarter strength of Hogland's nutrient solution. A final irrigation<br>
was given with the same solution but enriched with 20 mM potassium iodide a week<br>
before harvesting. The plants remained healthy and continued to grow, and their<br>
enrichment with iodine was confirmed through EDAX analysis of scanning electron<br>
micrographs of the plant tissues. The composition of the major ions in the plant as<br>
estimated by the EDAX analysis was: 24.38% sodium, 5.37% potassium, 49.6%<br>
chloride and 8.6% iodide.<br>
EXAMPLE 10<br>
150 g of crude salt was prepared from Salicornia brachiata as per the procedure of<br>
EXAMPLE 1. The salt was subjected to mechanical washing with saturated brine and<br>
the insolubles in the salt could be reduced from 12 % to 83%.<br>
The main advantages of this invention are:<br>
1. Unlike common salt, the nutrient rich salt of plani origin is highly nutritious,<br>
being rich in potassium chloride and several essential micronutrients such as iron,<br>
manganese, copper, zinc and amino acids.<br>
2. Up to 4-10 tons of nutrient rich salt can be obtained per hectare of cultivation and<br>
since large tracts of saline wasteland are available in the vicinity of solar salt<br>
works and other coastal areas, it may be possible to produce large quantities of<br>
such nutrient-rich salt.<br>
3. Production of such nutrient rich salt from salt tolerant oil-bearing plants would<br>
make their cultivation more remunerative since both edible oil and salt can be<br>
recovered.<br>
4. The salt tolerant characteristics of the plants selected in the present invention<br>
make the plants amenable to irrigation with not only plain sea water but with<br>
bittern-supplemented sea water that greatly improves the potassium content of<br>
the salt besides increasing the levels of other micronutrients as well.<br>
5. The salt would be appealing to strict vegetarians since it is derived from a<br>
vegetable source.<br>
6. The crude and refined salts are naturally free flowing and do not require addition<br>
of additives such as silica and magnesium carbonate for this purpose.<br>
7. The plants can be enriched in iodine by irrigation with seawater enriched with<br>
iodide salt preferably in waste sources or by adding iodine-rich manure such as<br>
Padina and Sargassum seaweeds to the soil.<br><br><br><br>
