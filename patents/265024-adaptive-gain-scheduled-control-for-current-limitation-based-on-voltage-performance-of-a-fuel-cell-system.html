				<td>ADAPTIVE GAIN SCHEDULED CONTROL FOR CURRENT LIMITATION<br>
BASED ON VOLTAGE PERFORMANCE OF A FUEL CELL SYSTEM<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
1.	Field of the Invention<br>
[0001]	This invention relates generally to an algorithm for limiting<br>
the output current from a fuel cell stack and, more particularly, to an algorithm for<br>
limiting the output current from a fuel cell stack based on various parameters,<br>
such as stack performance, stack life, etc.<br>
2.	Discussion of the Related Art<br>
[0002]	Hydrogen is a very attractive fuel because it is clean and can<br>
be used to efficiently produce electricity in a fuel cell. A hydrogen fuel cell is an<br>
electro-chemical device that includes an anode and a cathode with an electrolyte<br>
therebetween. The anode receives hydrogen gas and the cathode receives<br>
oxygen or air. The hydrogen gas is dissociated in the anode to generate free<br>
hydrogen protons and electrons. The hydrogen protons pass through the<br>
electrolyte to the cathode. The hydrogen protons react with the oxygen and the<br>
electrons in the cathode to generate water. The electrons from the anode cannot<br>
pass through the electrolyte, and thus are directed through a load to perform<br>
work before being sent to the cathode.<br>
[0003]	Proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFC) are a<br>
popular fuel cell for vehicles. The PEMFC generally includes a solid polymer<br>
electrolyte proton conducting membrane, such as a perfluorosulfonic acid<br>
membrane. The anode and cathode typically include finely divided catalytic<br>
particles, usually platinum (Pt), supported on carbon particles and mixed with an<br>
ionomer. The catalytic mixture is deposited on opposing sides of the membrane.<br>
The combination of the anode catalytic mixture, the cathode catalytic mixture and<br>
the membrane define a membrane electrode assembly (MEA). MEAs are<br>
relatively expensive to manufacture and require certain conditions for effective<br>
operation.<br>
[0004]	Several fuel cells are typically combined in a fuel cell stack<br>
to generate the desired power. The fuel cell stack receives a cathode input gas,<br><br>
P000808-FCA-CHE<br>
typically a flow of air forced through the stack by a compressor. Not all of the<br>
oxygen is consumed by the stack and some of the air is output as a cathode<br>
exhaust gas that may include water as a stack by-product. The fuel cell stack<br>
also receives an anode hydrogen input gas that flows into the anode side of the<br>
stack.<br>
[0005] The stack controller needs to know the current/voltage<br>
relationship, referred to as a polarization curve, of the fuel cell stack to provide a<br>
proper distribution of power from the stack. The relationship between the voltage<br>
and the current of the stack is typically difficult to define because it is non-linear,<br>
and changes depending on many variables, including stack temperature, stack<br>
partial pressures and cathode and anode stoichiometries. Additionally the<br>
relationship between the stack current and voltage changes as the stack<br>
degrades over time. Particularly, an older stack will have lower cell voltages, and<br>
will need to provide more current to meet the power demands than a new, non-<br>
degraded stack.<br>
[0006] Fortunately, many fuel cell systems, once they are above a<br>
certain temperature, tend to have repeatable operating conditions at a given<br>
current density. In those instances, the voltage can be approximately described<br>
as a function of stack current density and age.<br>
SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION<br>
[0007]	In accordance with the teachings of the present invention, a<br>
system and method are disclosed for limiting the output current of a fuel cell<br>
stack as the stack degrades and its performance decreases over time. The fuel<br>
cell stack provides a voltage output signal and a current density output signal,<br>
where the current density output signal is provided to a look-up table that<br>
identifies a predetermined voltage set-point for the particular current density.<br>
The voltage set-point is sent to a first comparator that compares it to the voltage<br>
output signal from the stack to generate a voltage difference signal. The voltage<br>
difference signal is provided to a controller, such as a proportional-integral<br>
controller, that provides a current limiting signal based on the voltage difference<br>
signal. The current limiting signal and a current request signal are provided to a<br><br>
second comparator that selects the lesser of the two, which is used to limit the<br>
maximum output current of the stack. The output voltage signal and the output<br>
current signal from the stack are also provided to a polarization curve estimator<br>
that estimates parameters of the stack to define a polarization curve of the stack<br>
that will change over the life of the stack. The parameters from the estimator are<br>
provided to a gain scheduler that provides gains to the controller that are based<br>
on where in the life of the stack it is currently operating.<br>
[0008]	Additional features of the present invention will become<br>
apparent from the following description and appended claims, taken in<br>
conjunction with the accompanying drawings.<br>
BRIEF DESCRIPTION OF THE DRAWINGS<br>
[0009]	Figure 1 is a graph with time on the horizontal axis and<br>
power on the vertical axis showing a maximum output power from a fuel cell<br>
stack as the stack degrades over time; and<br>
[0010]	Figure 2 is a block diagram of a fuel cell system that<br>
employs a process for limiting stack output power based on stack performance,<br>
according to an embodiment of the present invention.<br>
DETAILED DESCRIPTION OF THE EMBODIMENTS<br>
[0011]	The following discussion of the embodiments of the<br>
invention directed to a system and method for limiting fuel cell stack output<br>
current as the stack degrades over time is merely exemplary in nature, and is in<br>
no way intended to limit the invention or its applications or uses.<br>
[0012]	The present invention proposes an algorithm for limiting the<br>
output current from a fuel cell stack based on stack performance, such as voltage<br>
degradation, or other external factors, such as the anode inlet pressure being too<br>
low. One purpose of the limitation algorithm is to maintain the fuel cell system in<br>
operation even if the stack cannot provide full performance and to be able to<br>
draw enough current from the stack to run the vehicle or charge the battery. As<br>
will be discussed in detail below, the algorithm is designed to limit the current<br>
output from the stack based on stack voltage performance.<br><br>
[0013]	Figure 1 is a graph with time on the horizontal axis and<br>
power on the vertical axis to show how the output power of a fuel cell stack<br>
typically degrades over time. The graph is separated into three sections,<br>
particularly a beginning of stack life section 10, a middle of stack life section 12<br>
and an end of stack life section 14 over the life of the fuel cell stack. Graph line<br>
16 shows how the output power of the stack is reduced over time as a result of<br>
stack degradation. Although the graph line 16 is linear, the actual degradation of<br>
the fuel cell stack may be better represented by a curve.<br>
[0014]	Figure 2 is a block diagram of a fuel cell system 20 that<br>
uses an algorithm for limiting the output current of a fuel cell stack 22 based on<br>
stack performance over time, according to an embodiment of the present<br>
invention. A stack output voltage signal V is provided on line 24 from the stack<br>
22 and a stack output current density signal j is provided on line 26 from the<br>
stack 22. The stack output current signal j is provided to a look-up table 28 that<br>
identifies a voltage set-point Vsp for the current density of the stack 22. The<br>
voltage set-point Vsp values stored in the look-up table 28 are predetermined<br>
values that are selected for the stack performance requirements discussed<br>
herein. In once embodiment, the voltage set-point Vsp is higher at lower current<br>
densities and lower at higher current densities for increased flexibility and<br>
improved response. The voltage set-point Vsp from the look-up table 28 is sent to<br>
a comparator 30 along with the voltage output signal V from the stack 22 to<br>
generate a voltage difference signal as the difference therebetween.<br>
[0015]	The voltage difference signal is sent to a controller 32 that<br>
controls the current output of the stack 22 to limit the output power as the stack<br>
22 ages. In one non-limiting embodiment, the controller 32 is a proportional-<br>
integral (PI) controller. However, as will be appreciated by those skilled in the<br>
art, other types of controllers, such as PID, PD, LQR, etc. controllers, can also be<br>
employed within the scope of the present invention. The stack current control by<br>
the controller 32 is activated when the voltage output signal V from the stack 22<br>
is less than the voltage set-point Vsp. In this situation, the controller 32 tries to<br>
maintain the stack voltage V at the set-point Vsp by reducing the current provided<br>
by the stack 22. Thus, the controller 32 tries to keep the stack voltage V at the<br><br>
P000808-FCA-CHE<br>
set-point Vsp only if the voltage V is below the set-point Vsp. If the voltage V is<br>
above the set-point Vsp then the controller 32 does not need to act.<br>
[0016]	The proportional part of the controller 32 is designed so that<br>
it is active only when the voltage difference signal is negative. The proportional<br>
gains for the PI controller 32 are scheduled based on the voltage set-point Vsp<br>
and the life of the stack 22. The integral part of the PI controller 32 is designed<br>
so that the controller 32 is enabled/disabled with stall and reset controls on the<br>
integrator. The stall control is enabled only if the voltage difference signal is less<br>
than a certain threshold, such as 10 volts. The controller output is reset by the<br>
reset control if the voltage difference signal goes below another threshold, such<br>
as 70 volts. The values of the stall and reset thresholds are selected so that the<br>
reset threshold is higher than the stall threshold to allow the integrator to have<br>
some memory of the performance of the stack 22 so that if an immediate<br>
transient causes the stack voltage V to drop below the voltage set-point Vsp, the<br>
controller 32 responds faster. The integrator gains are scheduled based on the<br>
voltage set-point Vsp and the life of the stack 22.<br>
[0017]	The output of the controller 32 is a current limit value lLim<br>
that limits the current density output of the stack 22. When a request for power<br>
Preq is made to a stack current controller 34 on line 36, the controller 34 converts<br>
the power request singal Preqto a current request signal lreq. The current request<br>
lreq is sent to a comparator 38 that compares the current request signal lreq to the<br>
current limit value l|im, and outputs the lesser of the two to the stack 22 so that<br>
the current density output of the stack 22 is limited based on the voltage set-point<br>
Vsp or is limited based on the current request signal lreq.<br>
[0018]	The gains Kp and Kl of the PI controller 32 are set by an<br>
adaptive gain scheduler 40. The gains Kp and Kj are adapted based on a<br>
polarization curve estimation algorithm provided by a polarization curve estimator<br>
42. The estimator 42 receives the voltage output signal V and the current density<br>
output signal j from the stack 22 and generates estimates of the stack<br>
parameters. As the stack 22 degrades with life, the parameters vary, which<br>
reduces the maximum power available from the stack 22. In this non-limiting<br>
example, each of the sections 10,12 and 14 in the graph shown in figure 1 has a<br><br>
P000808-FCA-CHE<br>
particular gain Kpand Kj associated therewith. Therefore, when the adaptive gain<br>
scheduler 40 determines that the stack 22 has entered a new section as it ages,<br>
the polarization curve parameters are used to change the gain for the particular<br>
section.<br>
[0019]	Many control parameters of a fuel cell system require<br>
knowledge of the polarization curve of the fuel cell stack, such as knowing the<br>
maximum voltage potential and current draw available from the fuel cell stack.<br>
As mentioned above, as the stack ages, the stack polarization curve also<br>
changes as a result of stack degradation. U.S. Patent Application serial No.<br>
11/669,898, filed January 31, 2007, titled Algorithm for Online Adaptive<br>
Polarization Curve Estimation of a Fuel Cell Stack, assigned to the Assignee of<br>
this Application and herein incorporated by reference, discloses an algorithm for<br>
calculating the polarization curve of a fuel cell stack online as the fuel cell system<br>
is being operated. The algorithm of the '898 application estimates two or more<br>
stack parameters from collected data as the stack is being operated, and uses<br>
the parameters to calculate the polarization curve. When the fuel cell stack is<br>
running and certain data validity criteria have been met, the algorithm goes into a<br>
good collection mode where it collects stack data, such as stack current density,<br>
average cell voltage and minimum cell voltage. When the stack is shut down, the<br>
algorithm uses a cell voltage model to solve a non-linear least squares problem<br>
to estimate predetermined parameters that define the polarization curve. If the<br>
estimating parameters satisfy certain termination criteria, then the estimated<br>
parameters are stored to be used by a system controller to calculate the<br>
polarization curve of the stack for future stack runs. The polarization curve<br>
estimator 42 can use the polarization curve estimation process in the '898<br>
application, or any other suitable algorithm.<br>
[0020]	In one non-limiting embodiment, the controller gains are<br>
modified so that they respond faster and harsher at the end of life section 14 than<br>
in the beginning of life section 10 to avoid system shut-downs due to low stack<br>
voltage at the expense of oscillations. During the beginning of life of the stack<br>
22, the controller gains are relaxed to allow the stack 22 to recover normally<br>
during transients and to avoid any unnecessary limitations and oscillations.<br><br>
