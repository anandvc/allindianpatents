Combination   of     lactic  acid bacteria   and  its  use   for the  prevention   and/or   treatment   of   infections    and inflammatory conditions<br>
The  present   invention   relates   to  a combination   of   lactic   acid  bacteria   and   its use   for making   a   food  supplement,   a   hygiene   product or   a pharmaceutical  preparation   for   the  prevention    and/or treatment   of   infections  and   inflammatory  conditions caused   by   bacteria,   viruses   or   fungi,    especially   in the mouth,    vagina,   urethra,   nose,    eyes  and   ears.<br>
Lactic  acid  bacteria  are Gram-positive bacteria   that produce   lactic  acid by the  fermentation of  glucose.     Streptococcus   thermophilus  is  also included   in  this  definition  by   convention.<br>
It  is  well   known  that   strains  of  lactic acid bacteria   that produce  H202  can   act  as  regulators   of the bacterial   flora  in body orifices  and  on mucous membranes.      It  has  been  demonstrated   that  H202-producing lactic   acid bacteria   can antagonize  E.   coli,      N. gonorrhoea,   G.   vaginalis,      C.    trachomatis, U.   urealyticum     and     B.   bivius.        However,   these bacteria   are  only  of   limited   benefit  when  used   in medical   practice.      This  can   be   seen   from  the   fact  that preparations  based  on   lactic   acid  bacteria   (e.g-vaginal   pessaries)   intended   for   the   treatment   of infections   by  the   above  microorganisms    (e.g.    vaginitis) are   not   held   in   high   regard   by   doctors,   who  prefer to<br><br>
2<br>
treat    their  patients   with   antibiotics  or chemotherapeutic   agents.<br>
To  the   best  of   the   inventor's   knowledge,   no antibacterial   or   flora-regulating   action   in    body orifices   and  on  mucous membranes   has   been   attributed  to arginine-utilizing   lactic  acid  bacteria.<br>
It   has   now   been   found   surprisingly   that   the activity  of  Pl202-producing   lactic   acid bacteria   is considerably  potentiated  by   the   addition  of    one   or more strains  of  lactic  acid bacteria  that   are  capable  of utilizing   arginine.      Arginine   forms   part  of    various small   peptides  found  in biological   fluids  and  it  also occurs   as   free    arginine.     Many bacterial   species utilize  it  for their  own nutrition  and growth. Arginine-utilizing  lactic  acid bacteria can   therefore deprive  other,   pathogenic  or  potentially pathogenic bacteria   of  a   certain  quantity  of   arginine,    which -  though not  enough  to terminate  their growth   -  makes them  more   susceptible  to  the   action  of  the   H202   produced by  the   lactic  acid bacteria.<br>
The  present  invention   therefore   provides  a combination  of  lactic  acid   bacteria   comprising:<br>
(a)	a   first   component   consisting  of   at   least  one strain   of   H202-producing  lactic  acid  bacteria,    and<br>
(b)	a   second   component   consisting  of   at   least one   strain   of  arginine-utilizing   lactic  acid  bacteria.<br>
The   strain   of   lactic  acid  bacteria   in component    (a)   is   preferably   chosen   from  a   group  made   up of   the   strains  of   the  species   Lactobacillus   crispatus,<br><br>
3 Lactobacillus   salivarivs  and   Lactobacillus   casei,   while the   strain  of   lactic  acid  bacteria   in component   (b)   is chosen   from  a   group  made   up  of   the   strains   of   the species   Lactobacillus brevis,    Lactobacillus   gasseri and Lactobacillus   fermentum.   More   especially,    the   strain  of lactic   acid  bacteria     in   component    (b)   is   the Lactobacillus  brevis  CD2   strain   deposited   in   the   DSM  -Deutsche   Sammlung  von Mikroorganismen  und   Zellkulturen GmbH,    Braunschweig,    Germany,   on   February   6,    1998   with access   number   DSM   11988   under  the   Budapest   Treaty,   or mutants  or  derivatives thereof.<br>
The  ratio  of the  number  of bacteria   in component   (a)   to the  number  of bacteria  in   component (b)    is   preferably  from    1   :   100     to     100   :    1,    and more especially  from    1   :   5       to       5:1,     the most preferred  ratio being    1:1.<br>
The  combination  can be  administered   in the<br>
unit   dosage  form comprising  from	1 x  102	to<br>
5  x   1011     bacteria   of  component    (a)   and  from     1   x   102 to        5   x   1011       bacteria   of   component   (b) ,   preferably 1   x   109       bacteria   of  component    (a)   and       3   x   109 bacteria  of  component   (b) .<br>
The   combination   can   also  be  administered in the   form  of  tablets,    sucking   tablets,   sweets,    chewing gum,    gelatin   capsules,   pessaries,    suppositories   and micro-enemas,   as  well   as   pellets,    dental   creams   and gels,    denture  powders,   mouthwashes,   dentifrices, sprays,    suspensions   and  ointments.<br><br>
According   Co  another   embodiment   of    the invention,   the   combination   additionally  comprises  at least   one   other   strain  of   lactic  acid   bacteria   chosen from   a   group made   up  of:<br>
Lactobacillus  acidophilus,   Lactobacillus  buchneri, Lactobacillus  casei ,   Lactobacillus   catena forme , Lactobacillus   cellobiosus,   Lactobacillus   crispatus, Lactobacillus   curvatus,   Lactobacillus  delbrueckii, Lactobacillus jensenii ,   Lactobacillus   leichmannii, Lactobacillus minutus,   Lactobacillus plantarum, Lactobacillus salivarius,   Lactobacillus brevis, Lactobacillus gasseri,   Lactobacillus fermentumr Bifidobacterium  adolescentis,   Bifidobacterium angulatum,  Bifidobacterium  bifidum,   Bifidobacterium breve,   Bifidobacterium catenulatum,   Bifidobacterium dentium,   Bifidobacterium  eriksonii,   Bifidobacterium infantis,   Bifidobacterium  longum,   Bifidobacterium plantarum and  Streptococcus   thermophilus.<br>
The  combination  can  also  comprise   vitamins, quaternary  ammonium  bases,   mineral   salts,   antioxidants and  anti-plaque   agents.<br>
The   invention  also   relates   to  the   use   of a combination of   lactic  acid  bacteria   comprising:<br>
(a)	a   first   component   consisting   of   at   least  one strain   of   H2O2-producing  lactic   acid   bacteria   and<br>
(b)	a   second   component   consisting  of   at    least one   strain  of   arginine-utilizing   lactic   acid   bacteria, for  making   a   food   supplement,   a   hygiene  product   or a pharmaceutical   preparation   for   the   prevention   and/or<br><br>
5 treatment   of   infections  and   inflammatory   conditions caused   by     bacteria,   viruses   or   fungi,   especially  in the  mouth,   vagina,   urethra,    nose,   eyes   and   ears.      These infections   and  inflammatory   conditions   include gingivitis,   periodontitis,   mucositis   and   stomatitis caused   by  drugs   and/or  physical   agents,   Behcet ' s syndrome,   diakeratosis  of   the   oral   cavity,   glossitis, sore   throat,   sialadenitis,    sialolithiasis,   pemphigus, Lichen  planus,   Sjogren's   syndrome,    vaginosis, vaginitis,   urethritis,   prostatitis,   proctitis,    otitis, conjunctivitis,    rhinitis,    sinusitis,    leucoplakia, aphthae,   herpes,   and  infections  with  Helicobacter pilori.   in the oral  cavity.<br>
The combination  can  also  be  used  to   advantage for  the  treatment  of  the  oral  cavity  as  an  oral deodorant,   antiinflammatory,   anti-caries  and/or   anti-plaque  agent.<br>
The  following examples  serve  to  illustrate the  various  aspects  of  the  invention   in more   detail but should   not   be  construed  as   in   any  way   limiting   the invention.<br>
Example     1<br>
The  inhibitory   effect   of:   H2O2-producing lactic   acid  bacteria    (Component  A) ;   arginine-utilizing lactic   acid  bacteria    (Component   B) ;    and  the   combination of   the   two   strains,   specifically   in   the   ratio   1    :   1 (Combination  AB) ;   on   the   growth   of   potentially pathogenic   bacteria   was  evaluated.<br><br>
6<br>
Briefly,    the  culture   of   lactic   acid   bacteria to  be   tested   was   first  adjusted   to   a   neutral   pH, because   an   acidic  pH   itself   inhibits   bacterial   growth. The   suspension  was   subjected   to   sterile   filtration,   and the   filtrate   was   used   to   impregnate   a   number   of   discs of   absorbent   paper   (30   µl   of   filtrate  per  disc) .     The discs   were  placed  on   a  plate   of   selective   growth  medium that   had  been   inoculated  with   0.1  ml   of   Gardnerella vaginalis   (a   strain   which   causes  vaginosis   and   which was   isolated  in  a  laboratory)   together with   a   control disc   that   was   impregnated   only  with   30  µl   of   distilled water.   After   incubation   for   24   h  at   37°C,   the inhibition  of  the  growth   of   the  pathogens  was   evaluated by measuring  the diameter  of  the  halo around  the disc in millimetres.<br>
A second  series   of  tests  was  carried   out with Streptococcus mutans  as   the   target   pathogen,      this species  being  the  causative  agent  of  dental   plaque and caries.<br>
The  characterization  of  the bacteria   as H2O2 producers   was   done   by  a   classical   benzidine   peroxidase reaction,   which   reveals   H2O2-producing  colonies   of bacteria  by  a   blue   coloration..    The  activity  of arginine  dehydrolase   was   determined   to  evaluate   the ability  of   the   lactic   acid   bacteria   to  utilize   arginine (M.C.    Manca   de  Nadra,   Milchwissenschaft,   37       (1982) pp.    669-670].<br>
The   lactic   acid   bacteria   were   obtained  from   the American  Type   Culture   Collection    (ATCC),    Rockville,   USA.<br><br>

allowing   the   tablets   to  dissolve   in   their  mouth. Clinical   evaluations   were   performed   for  both   the   dental plaque   index   and   the   gingival   plaque   index.<br>
For   the  dental   plaque   the   following   scoring system   was   used   on   six  teeth    (first   upper  molar   on  the right;    upper   central   incisor   on   the   left;   first   upper premolar  on   the   left;   first   lower  molar  on   the   left; lower   central   incisor  on   the   right;   first   lower premolar   on  the   right):<br>
0	-	no  plaque   at  all<br>
1	-	no  visible  plaque<br>
2	-	visible  plaque<br>
3	-	very  obvious  plaque.<br>
The following scoring system was adopted for evaluating the gingival plaque, using the margin of the six teeth mentioned above:<br>
0	-     no  inflammation<br>
1	-     slight  inflammation<br>
2	-     moderate   inflammation,    with  bleeding   on contact<br>
3	-     marked  inflammation,   with  a  tendency  to spontaneous   bleeding.<br>
The   combined  data   obtained   for   the   six   teeth   of   the four   volunteers   were   as   follows:<br><br>

Example  3<br>
Four  subjects with  a  clinical and histological diagnosis of  recurrent  aphthous   ulcers were  treated  for  ten  days  with  six  sucking  tablets a day,   whose  composition  is  given  in  Example  2.<br>
All the patients treated showed a complete cure of the ulcers at the end of the ten-day course, and none of them had new ulcers during the following month.<br>
To  improve  the  flavour  and  appearance   of the bacterial  combination AB,   suitable  colouring  agents and sweeteners  such as  saccharin,   mint  oil  and xylitol can be  added,   as  is  customary  and well   known  to   those skilled  in  the art.<br>
The  combination  AB  can be  administered   in the form of   pellets,   sweets,   chewing   gum,   gelatin   capsules, dental   creams   and  gels,   denture  powders,   mouthwashes, dentifrices,   tablets,   pessaries,   suppositories,    sprays, suspensions   and  micro-enemas.<br><br>

The  polymer  gel   was   poured   into   a   mortar already   containing   the  calcium  phosphate   that   had  been hydrated with  glycerol,   and  the  components  were vigorously mixed.<br>
An  approximately  28%   solution of  sodium lauryl   sulphate  in  purified  water was  prepared separately.<br>
The  sodium  lauryl   sulphate  solution   was  then added   to  the  thick dicalcium phosphate paste.<br>
The  resulting thick  homogeneous  paste,   which had good  rheological  properties,   was  mixed  for   a   few minutes   and then  refined by  passing  it  through   a refiner   with  rollers.   This  gave  a   snow-white homogeneous  paste   with  a  pleasant  mint  aroma .<br>
38.5  g  of   lyophilized   lactic  acid   bacteria (L.   salivarius  +   L.   brevis,    1   :   1;   1010  CFU/g)    were passed   through   a   50-mesh   screen   and   added   in   small portions   to  the   rest    (770   g)   of   the   above   toothpaste base.       The   resulting   homogeneous  paste   had   a   slightly pale   brown  colour   and  a  mint   odour.<br><br>
