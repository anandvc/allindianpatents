				<td>DESCRIPTION<br>
PROCESS FOR PRODUCING C1-4 ALKYL ESTER<br>
OF 3,5-DIHYDROXY-6-HEPTENOIC ACID<br>
TECHNICAL FIELD<br>
The present invention relates to a process for<br>
producing a high purity 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid<br>
derivative having a very small content of impurities such<br>
as denatured substances. More particularly, it relates<br>
to a process for producing a high purity 3,5-dihydroxy-6-<br>
heptenoic acid derivative which is useful as a medicinal<br>
intermediate such as ethyl (3R,5S)-7-[ 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-<br>
fluorophenyl)quinolin-3-yl] -3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoate<br>
(hereinafter referred to as (3R,5S) DOLE), methyl<br>
(3R, 5S)-7-[ 2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl)quinolin-3-<br>
yl] -3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoate (hereinafter referred to<br>
as (3R,5S) DOLM).<br>
BACKGROUND ART<br>
A 3,S-dihydroxy-e-heptenoic acid derivative<br>
represented by (3R,5S) DOLE or (3R,5S) DOLM is known to<br>
be useful as an intermediate for a hyperlipemia<br>
preventive or curative medicine, or for a medicine for<br>
lowering cholesterol (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor) (JP-A-<br>
1-279866, EP-A-304063, US Patent 5,011,930). Such a 3,5-<br>
dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative is produced as a<br>
racemic modification as it has an asymmetric carbon. It<br><br>
is known that an optically active isomer can be produced<br>
by optical resolution of the racemic modification by<br>
liquid chromatography employing an optical isomer<br>
separation HPLC column. (WO95/23125)<br>
DISCLOSURE OF THE INVENTION<br>
In optical resolution of a 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic<br>
acid derivative such as (3R,5S) DOLE or a (3R,5S) DOLM by<br>
means of an optical isomer separation column (such as<br>
CHIRALCEL OF), as an eluent, an alcohol-contcLining<br>
solvent, for example, a mixed solvent of an alcohol with<br>
a hydrocarbon (for example, a mixed solvent of n-<br>
hexane/isopropanol) is usually used. A fraction of the<br>
3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative eluted in such<br>
a solvent is collected, and the solvent is distilled off.<br>
The obtained alcohol solution of the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-<br>
heptenoic acid derivative is further subjected to solvent<br>
exchange with a solvent, for recrystallization such as a<br>
hydrocarbon or a hydrocarbon partially containing an<br>
alcohol, followed by crystallization, whereby a pure 3,5-<br>
dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative is obtainable as<br>
crystals.<br>
However, with the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid<br>
derivative produced by such a process, a phenomenon of<br>
formation of denatured substances may sometimes be<br>
observed during its production or storage. A 3,5-<br>
dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative of the formula (1)<br><br>
is converted to a base material for medicine by<br>
converting it to a calcium salt after hydrolysis. During<br>
the process, its denatured substances tend to color a<br>
reaction solution strongly, and they will ultimately<br>
color also the medicinal base material. Formation of<br>
such impurities occurs even when one having a high purity<br>
made of the highest grade chemicals is used as the mixed<br>
solvent of a hydrocarbon and an alcohol, to be used in<br>
the production process. The content of such denatured<br>
substances is very small with ppm order in the 3,5-<br>
dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative to be produced.<br>
However, the desired product is to be used as an<br>
intermediate for medicines, and therefore, it is<br>
necessary to lower the impurities as far as possible.<br>
It is an object of the present invention to provide<br>
a novel process capable of producing a high purity 3,5-<br>
dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative which requires no<br>
particular purification process after its production, by<br>
significantly suppressing the content of the very small<br>
amount of impurities such as denatured substances in the<br>
desired product in the case of producing a 3,5-dihydroxy-<br>
6-heptenoic acid derivative through liquid chromatography<br>
employing an optical isomer separation column.<br>
As a result of their extensive study to accomplish<br>
the above object, the present inventors have found that<br>
formation of the very small amount of impurities such as<br>
denatured substances in the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic<br><br>
acid derivative as the desired product, is caused by an<br>
alcohol-containing solvent which is employed e.g. in the<br>
process of liquid chromatography employing an optical<br>
isomer separation column.<br>
Namely, according to the study by the present<br>
inventors, it has been found that, as shown in Example 1<br>
given hereinafter, when an alcohol as the solvent which<br>
was employed in the process for producing a 3,5-<br>
dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative, was distilled and<br>
concentrated, an oxidizing substance was found therein.<br>
And, stability of the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid<br>
derivative as the desired product was investigated in<br>
alcohol solvents, which contained the oxidizing substance<br>
in various ratios, whereby it has been found that as<br>
shown Example 2 given hereinafter, by Lowering the<br>
content of the oxidizing substance in the alcohol-<br>
containing solvent as far as possible, the amount of<br>
denatured substances formed in the desired product can be<br>
suppressed. Particularly, it has been found that by<br>
controlling the amount of the oxidizing substance in the<br>
alcohol-containing solvent to at most 0.05 molar<br>
equivalent to the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid<br>
derivative, the content of impurities in the desired<br>
product can be lowered to a level of not higher than the usually allowable amount.<br>
The present invention has been accomplished based on<br>
such a novel finding, and is characterized by the<br><br>
followings:<br>
(1) A process for producing a 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic<br>
acid derivative, which comprises a step of contacting a<br>
3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative of the formula<br>
(1) :<br><br>
wherein R is a C1-4 alkyl group, with a C1-4 lower alcohol-<br>
containing solvent, characterized in that an alcohol-<br>
containing solvent having its content of an oxidizing<br>
substance lowered as far as possible, is used to suppress<br>
the amount of impurities which are contained in the 3,5-<br>
dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative.<br>
(2)	The process according to above (1), wherein the step<br>
of contacting with the alcohol-containing solvent is a<br>
step of contacting with the solvent as an eluent for<br>
liquid chromatography employing an optical isomer<br>
separation column for optical resolution of the 3,5-<br>
dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative of the formula (1).<br>
(3)	The process according to above (1) or (2), wherein<br>
the content of the oxidizing substance in the alcohol-<br>
containing solvent is adjusted to at most 0.05 molar<br>
equivalent to the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid<br><br>
derivative of the formula (1).<br>
(4)	The process according to above (1), (2) or (3),<br>
wherein R in the formula (1) is a methyl group or an<br>
ethyl group.<br>
(5)	The process according to any one of above (1) to<br>
(4), wherein the alcohol in the alcohol-containing<br>
solvent is methanol, ethanol or isopropanol.<br>
(6)	The process according to any one of above (1) to<br>
(4), wherein the alcohol in the alcohol-containing<br>
solvent having the oxidizing substance adjusted to be at<br>
most 0.05 molar equivalent to the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-<br>
heptenoic acid derivative of the formula (1), is either<br>
one obtained by distillation of raw material alcohol or<br>
one having raw material alcohol treated with a reducing<br>
agent.<br>
According to the present invention, formation of the<br>
very small amount of impurities such as denatured<br>
substances in the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid<br>
derivative as the desired product can be significantly<br>
suppressed, and a high purity 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic<br>
acid derivative can be obtained without performing<br>
cumbersome purification treatment for removing the very<br>
small amount of impurities after its production. This is<br>
extremely meaningful in that the product is to be<br>
employed as an intermediate for medicines where even an<br>
extremely small amount of impurities may not be allowed.<br>
The reason why the impurities in the desired<br><br>
material can be significantly suppressed by the present<br>
invention, is not necessarily clearly understood, but it<br>
may be explained as follows:<br>
The alcohol in the alcohol-containing solvent used<br>
in the process is basically not so stable. When the<br>
alcohol is temporally exposed to a high temperature, a<br>
part of it degrades into an oxidizing substance, which is<br>
considered to be included in the solvent. The oxidizing<br>
substance contained in the alcohol, even in a very small<br>
amount, is significant in the step of e.g. liquid<br>
chromatography in the production of the desired product<br>
of the present invention, in that the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-<br>
heptenoic acid derivative as the desired product, will be<br>
in contact with the alcohol-containing solvent for a long<br>
time of from a few hours to a few days in the operation<br>
of adsorption/desorption and during the subsequent<br>
transition period for the next treatment.<br>
It is considered that through contact with an<br>
alcohol-containing solvent for such a long-time, a part<br>
of the desired product is oxidized by an oxidizing<br>
substance in the alcohol-containing solvent, and the<br>
oxidized is contained as impurities in the desired<br>
product. This is supported to some extent by the fact<br>
that denatured substances contained in the desired<br>
product are mainly ketones formed by oxidation of<br>
hydroxyl groups of the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid<br>
derivative.<br><br>
BEST MODE FOR CARRYING OUT THE INVENTION<br>
The 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative to be<br>
produced by the present invention is represented by the<br>
following formula (1).<br><br>
In the formula (1) , R is a C1-4 alkyl group,<br>
preferably a methyl group or an ethyl group. The<br>
representative compounds are, for example, ethyl (3R,5S)-<br>
7-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl) quinolin-3-yl]-3,5-<br>
dihydroxy-6-heptenoate ((3R,5S) DOLE), and methyl<br>
(3R,5S)-7-[2-cyclopropyl-4-(4-fluorophenyl) quinolin-3-<br>
yl]-3, 5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoate ((3R,5S) DOLM). These<br>
substances are useful as intermediates for hyperlipemia<br>
preventive or curative medicines, or for medicines for<br>
lowering cholesterol (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor).<br>
Such a 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative has<br>
an asymmetric carbon, and, a compound synthesized by a<br>
known process is a racemic modification. In the present<br>
invention, as mentioned above, an alcohol-containing<br>
solvent is employed in a process for obtaining an<br>
optically active isomer by optical resolution of the<br>
racemic modification by liquid chromatography employing<br><br>
an optical isomer separation HPLC column (e.g. "CHIRALCEL<br>
OF" manufactured by Daicel Chemical Industries, Ltd), and<br>
a contacting treatment with the alcohol-solvent is<br>
carried out.<br>
The alcohol in the alcohol-containing solvent is<br>
usually a C1-4 lower alcohol, and it may, for example, be<br>
methanol, ethanol, propanol or isopropanol. In the<br>
present invention, isopropanol is particularly effective.<br>
The alcohol-containing solvent may be employed as an<br>
alcohol itself depending on a case, but it is usually<br>
used as a solvent mixture with other solvents. As an<br>
eluent in the above-mentioned liquid chromatography, a<br>
solvent mixture with a hydrocarbon is employed. The<br>
solvent mixture in this case is, preferably, a solvent<br>
mixture containing a hydrocarbon such as hexane, heptane<br>
or cyclohexane, preferably in an amount of from 500 to 50<br>
parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the alcohol.<br>
In the present invention, as such an alcohol-<br>
containing solvent, one having the content of an<br>
oxidizing substance in the solvent lowered as far as<br>
possible, is employed. It is particularly preferred that<br>
the content of the oxidizing substance in the alcohol-<br>
containing solvent is adjusted to at most 0.05 molar<br>
equivalent to the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid<br>
derivative. It is preferred to maintain this amount of<br>
the oxidizing substance throughout the entire process in<br>
which the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative as<br><br>
the desired product is in contact with the alcohol-<br>
containing solvent. In the present invention, the<br>
oxidizing substance contained in the alcohol-containing<br>
solvent is one obtained by an iodine titration method<br>
according to the following formula. For example, it is<br>
obtained by taking an exact amount of 2 0 mL of a sample<br>
(the weight is also measured), diluting it with 50 mL of<br>
water, adding 2 g of potassium iodine (KI) and 10 mL of<br>
an aqueous acetic acid solution thereto, sealing it<br>
hermetically, and then after leaving it to stand still in<br>
a dark room for at least 15 min, titrating it with 0.01<br>
mol/L of an aqueous sodium thiosulfate solution by means<br>
of a potentiometric automatic titration method.<br>
H2O2+2H++2I- -&gt; 2H2O+I2<br>
I2+2Na2S2O3 -&gt; 2NaI+Na2S4O6<br>
In the present invention, if the content of the<br>
oxidizing substance in the alcohol-containing solvent is<br>
larger than 0.05 molar equivalent to the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-<br>
heptenoic acid derivative of the formula (1), the amount<br>
of impurities such as denatured substances included in<br>
the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative produced<br>
cannot be reduced to such a low level that satisfies at<br>
most 100 0 ppm which is usually deemed to be free from<br>
problem. In the present invention, the amount of<br>
impurities such as denatured substances in the desired<br>
product, can be dramatically reduced by bringing the<br>
content of the oxidizing substance in the alcohol-<br><br>
containing solvent to be preferably at most 0.05 molar<br>
equivalent, particularly preferably, at most 0.02 molar<br>
equivalent, to the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid<br>
derivative. Here, the molar equivalent of the oxidizing<br>
substance is calculated as converted to hydrogen peroxide.<br>
As means to obtain an alcohol-containing solvent<br>
having the content of the oxidizing substance lowered,<br>
various methods may be employed, and such means are not<br>
particularly limited in the present invention. However,<br>
the following methods may preferably be employed.<br>
One of them is a method of employing a solvent which<br>
contains an alcohol having a residue removed by<br>
distillation. As shown in the after-mentioned Example 1,<br>
it is possible to certainly reduce the amount of the<br>
contained oxidizing substance by repeating distillation<br>
of the raw material alcohol. As the distillation method,<br>
a common distillation method such as atmospheric<br>
distillation, reduced-pressure distillation or azeotropic<br>
distillation may, for example be employed.<br>
Another method is a method of employing a solvent<br>
which contains an alcohol wherein an oxidizing substance<br>
is reduced by addition of a reducing agent. As such a<br>
reducing substance, hydroquinone or sodium thiosulfate is<br>
preferred in the present invention. When such a reducing<br>
agent is used, it is possible to suppress denaturation by<br>
lactonization of the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid<br>
derivative such as (3R,5S) DOLE or (3R,5S) DOLM, which is<br><br>
likely to take place when other reducing agents are used.<br>
The reducing agent is used preferably in an amount within<br>
a range of from 0.5 to 10 equivalent, particularly<br>
preferably within a range of from 1 to 5 equivalent, to<br>
the amount of the oxidizing substance included in the raw<br>
material alcohol. The temperature for treatment with the<br>
reducing agent is preferably within a range of from 10 to<br>
60°C, particularly preferably within a range of from 2 0<br>
to 40°C.<br>
Among the above two processes of obtaining an<br>
alcohol having the content of the oxidizing substance<br>
lowered, the former process is preferx-ed in the present<br>
invention, because it can certainly lower the content of<br>
the oxidizing substance, and as compared with the latter<br>
process, the obtainable alcohol having the content of the<br>
oxidizing substance lowered does not include an excessive<br>
reducing agent or impurities such as reaction products or<br>
the reducing agent and the oxidizing substance.<br>
A known process as disclosed in WO95/23125 or<br>
WO02/30903 may be employed for the process of obtaining<br>
an optically active isomer by optical resolution of the<br>
racemic modification by liquid chromatography treatment<br>
such as a batch method or a simulated moving bed method<br>
employing an optical isomer separation HPLC column by<br>
using an alcohol-containing solvent having the content of<br>
the oxidizing substance lowered.<br>
The present invention will now be described in<br><br>
further detail with reference to Examples. However, it<br>
should be understood that the present invention is by no<br>
means restricted to such specific Examples.<br>
EXAMPLE 1<br>
A commercially available highest-grade isopropanol<br>
was concentrated 160 times by distillation under<br>
atmospheric pressure to obtain a concentrated liquid and<br>
a distillate. Distillation to concentrate the obtained<br>
distillate 160 times again, was repeated for 3 more times,<br>
and the amount (mgH2O2/g) of an oxidizing substance<br>
contained in each isopropanol liquid obtained was<br>
measured. The results are shown in Table 1.<br><br>
Further, 240 mg of (3R,5S) DOLE was dissolved in 10<br>
mL of each liquid as identified in Table 1 and left to<br>
stand in a constant temperature bath at 40°C for 4 days,<br>
whereby the amount of denatured substances in (3R,5S)<br><br>
DOLE was measured and shown in Table 2 by percentage in<br>
the total substances including (3R,5S) DOLE.<br>
The impurities contained in (3R,5S) DOLE were<br>
analyzed by nuclear magnetic resonance and mass spectrum,<br>
whereby it was confirmed that the impurities were mainly<br>
ketones. The analysis of the content of impurities was<br>
carried out by using 4.6 IDx 250 mmL L-ColumnODS which<br>
was packed with octadecyl group chemically bonded type<br>
silica packing (Foundation of Chemicals Evaluation and<br>
Research Institute), an ethanol/tetra /hydrofuran/0.01 M<br>
ammonium acetate solution (45:3:52, V/V/V), 1.0 mL/min,<br>
40°C, wave length 2 54 nm.<br><br><br><br>
As is evident from Table 2, the (3R,5S) DOLE that<br>
contacted for 4 days with the concentrated liquid<br>
obtained by the first distillation i.e. the isopropanol<br>
liquid, containing an oxidizing substance in high<br>
concentration, contains impurities, and their content<br>
increases with time. On the other hand, it is evident<br>
that the (3R,5S) DOLE that contacted with the<br>
concentrated liquid or distillate obtained by the second<br>
or subsequent distillation i.e. isopropanol liquid<br>
without containing an oxidizing substance in high<br>
concentration, contains no denatured substance even after<br>
the contact for 4 days.<br>
EXAMPLE 2<br>
500 mg of (3R,5S) DOLE was dissolved in 0.64 ml<br>
(equivalent to 0.5 g) of a commercially available<br>
highest-grade isopropanol (IPA). On the other hand,<br>
1.0035 g of a 9.26 mmol/g H2O2 aqueous solution was<br>
weighed and adjusted to 10 ml with the same commercially<br>
available highest-grade isopropanol as mentioned above,<br>
to prepare 0.929 mmol/g H2O2-IPA.<br>
This H2O2-IPA solution was added to the above IPA<br>
solution of (3R,5S) DOLE, so that the amount of H2O2 in<br>
the isopropanol would be 10 μl, 20 μl, 50 μl and 100 μl,<br>
respectively. The obtained liquids were left to stand<br>
for 4 days in the constant temperature bath at 40°C under<br>
light shielding condition, and the amounts of denatured<br>
substances (ppm) formed, were detected in the same manner<br><br>
as in Example 1. The results are shown in Table 3. The<br>
H2O2 content in IPA in Table 3 is the molar equivalent of<br>
H2O2 per (3R,5S) DOLE.<br><br>
As shown in Table 3, as the peroxide concentration<br>
in isopropanol increases, the content of impurities in<br>
(3R,5S) DOLE increases. However, it is evident that if<br>
the content of peroxide in isopropanol is maintained to<br>
be 0.05 molar equivalent, the content of impurities in<br>
(3R,5S) DOLE can be suppressed to be at most 1000 ppm<br>
which is usually allowable.<br>
EXAMPLE 3 (reducing agent: hydroquinone)<br>
240 mg of (3R,5S) DOLE was dissolved in 9 ml of<br>
commercially available isopropanol. For accelerated test,<br>
to the solution, 0.5 ml (0.09 eq.) of an isopropanol<br>
solution containing 0.097 mmol/ml of a H2O2 aqueous<br><br>
solution was added to obtain a liquid (blank liquid),<br>
which was left to stand for 4 days in a constant<br>
temperature bath at 40°C.<br>
On the other hand, to the above blank solution, 1 ml<br>
of a 0.0272 mmol/ml hydroquinone-isopropanol solution was<br>
further added to obtain a liquid (hydroquinone-added<br>
liquid), which was left to stand for 4 days in a constant<br>
temperature bath at 4 0°C in the same manner as above.<br>
In the each of above tests, the amount of denatured<br>
substances contained in the obtained (3R,5S) DOLE was<br>
measured and shown in Table 4.<br><br>
EXAMPLE 4 (reducing agent: sodium thiosulfate)<br>
240 mg of (3R,5S) DOLE was dissolved in 9 mL of<br>
commercially available isopropanol. For accelerated<br>
stability test, to the solution, 0.5 ml (0.09 eq.) of an<br>
isopropanol solution containing 0.097 mmol/ml of a H2O2<br>
aqueous solution was added to obtain a liquid (blank<br><br>
liquid), which was left to stand for 4 days in a constant<br>
temperature bath at 40°C (blank) .<br>
On the other hand, to the above blank solution, 1 ml<br>
of a 0.0265 mmol/ml sodium thiosulfate aqueous solution<br>
was further added to obtain a liquid (sodium thiosulfate-<br>
added liquid), which was left to stand for 4 days in a<br>
constant temperature bath at 40°C, in the same manner as<br>
described above.<br>
In each of the above tests, the amount of denatured<br>
substances contained in the obtained (3R,5S) DOLE was<br>
measured and shown in Table 5.<br><br><br>
We Claim:<br>
1. A process for producing a C1-C4 alkyl ester of 3,5-dihydroxy-<br>
6-heptenoic acid, which comprises a step of contacting a 3,5-<br>
dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid derivative of the formula (1):<br><br>
wherein R is a C1-4 alkyl group, with a C1-4 alcohol-containing<br>
solvent, wherein said alcohol-containing solvent having its<br>
content of an oxidizing substance that causes denatured products<br>
of compound of formula (I) being adjusted in a manner such as<br>
herein described to at most 0.05 molar equivalent of the target<br>
ester, is used to suppress the amount of impurities in the form<br>
of denatured substances in the C1-C4 alkyl ester of 3,5-<br>
dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid.<br>
2.	The process as claimed in Claim 1, wherein the step of<br>
contacting with the alcohol-containing solvent is a step of<br>
contacting with the solvent as an eluent for liquid<br>
chromatography employing an optical isomer separation column for<br>
optical resolution of the 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid<br>
derivative of the formula (1).<br>
3.	The process as claimed in Claim 1 or 2, wherein R in the<br>
formula (1) is a methyl group or an ethyl group.<br>
4.	The process according to any one of Claims 1 to 3,<br><br>
wherein the alcohol in the alcohol-containing solvent is<br>
methanol, ethanol or isopropanol.<br>
5. The process as claimed in any one of Claims 3 or 4,<br>
wherein the alcohol in the alcohol-containing solvent<br>
having the oxidizing substance adjusted to be at most<br>
0.05 molar equivalent to 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid<br>
derivative of the formula (1), is either one obtained by<br>
distillation of raw material alcohol or one having raw<br>
material alcohol treated with a reducing agent, selected<br>
from hydroquinone or sodium thiosulfate.<br><br>
This invention discloses a process for producing a C1-C4<br>
alkyl ester of 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid, which<br>
comprises a step of contacting a 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic<br>
acid derivative of the formula (1):<br><br>
wherein R is a C1-4 alkyl group, with a C1-4 alcohol-<br>
containing solvent, characterized in that said alcohol-<br>
containing solvent having its content of an oxidizing<br>
substance that causes denatured products of compound of<br>
formula (I) being adjusted to at most 0.05 molar equivalent<br>
of the target ester, is used to suppress the amount of<br>
impurities in the form of denatured substances in the C1-C4<br>
alkyl ester of 3,5-dihydroxy-6-heptenoic acid.</td>
