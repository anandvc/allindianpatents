				<td>TITLE OF THE INVENTION SUBSTITUTED AMIDES<br>
CROSS-REFERENCE TO RELATED APPLICATIONS Not applicable.<br>
BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION<br>
Marijuana (Cannabis saliva L) and its derivatives have been used for centuries for medicinal and recreational purposes. A major active ingredient in marijuana and hashish has been determined to be A^-tetrahydrocannabinol (A^-THC). Detailed research has revealed that the biological action of A^-THC and other members of the cannabinoid family occurs through two G-protein coupled receptors termed CBl and CB2. The CB1 receptor is primarily found in the central and peripheral nervous systems and to a lesser extent in several peripheral organs. The CB2 receptor is found primarily in lymphoid tissues and cells. Three endogenous ligands for the cannabinoid receptors derived from arachidonic acid have been identified (anandamide, 2-arachidonoyI glycerol, and 2-arachidonyl glycerol ether). Each is an agonist with activities similar to A^-THC, including sedation, hypothermia, intestinal immobility, antinociception, analgesia, catalepsy, anti-emesis, and appetite stimulation.<br>
The genes for the respective cannabinoid receptors have each been disrupted in mice. The CB l-/-receptor knockout mice appeared normal and fertile. They were resistant to the effects of A^-THC and demonstrated a strong reduction in the reinforcing properties of morphine and the severity of withdrawal syndrome. They also demonstrated reduced motor activity and hypoalgesia. The CB2-/- receptor knockout mice were also healthy and fertile. They were not resistant to the central nervous system mediated effects of administered A^-THC. There were some effects on immune cell activation, reinforcing the role for the CB2 receptor in immune system functions.<br>
Excessive exposure to A^-THC can lead to overeating, psychosis, hypothermia, memory loss, and sedation. Specific synthetic ligands for the cannabinoid receptors have been developed and have aided in the characterization of the cannabinoid receptors: CP55.940 (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 19S8, 247,1046-1051); WIN55212-2 (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Then 1993, 264, 1352-1363); SR141716A (FEES Lett. 1994, 350, 240-244; Life Sci. 1995, 56, 1941-1947); and SR144528 (J. Pharmacol. Exp. Ther. 1999, 288, 582-589). The pharmacology and therapeutic potential for cannabinoid receptor ligands has been reviewed (Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 1998, 8, 301-313; Ann. Rep. Med. Chem., A. Doherty, Ed.; Academic Press, NY 1999, Vol. 34, 199-208; Exp. Opin. Ther. Patents 2000, 10, 1529-1538; Trends in Pharma. Sci. 2000, 21, 218-224). There is at least one CBl modulator characterized as an inverse agonist or an antagonist, N-(l-piperidinyl)-5-(4-chlorophenyl)-l-(2,4-dichlorophenyl)-4-methylpyrazole-3-carboxamide (SR141716A), in clinical trials for treatment of eating disorders at this time. There still remains a need<br>
for potent low molecular weight CB1 modulators that have pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynaraic properties suitable for use as human Pharmaceuticals.<br>
Treatment of asthma with CB1 receptor modulators (such as CB1 inverse agonists) is supported by the finding that presynaptic cannabinoid CB l_receptors mediate the inhibition of noradrenaline release (in the guinea pig lung)_(Europ. J. of Pharmacology, 2001,431 (2), 237-244).<br>
Treatment of cirrhosis of the liver with CB1 receptor modulators is supported by the finding that a CB1 receptor modulator will reverse the low blood pressure observed in rats with carbon tetrachloride-induced liver cirrhosis and will lower the elevated mesenteric blood flow and portal vein pressure (Nature Medicine, 2001,7 (7), 827-832).<br>

Compounds of Formula I may contain one or more asymmetric centers and can thus occur as racemates and racemic mixtures, single enantiomers, diastereomeric mixtures and individual diaslereomers. The present invention is meant to comprehend all such isomeric forms of the compounds of Formula I.<br>
Some of the compounds described herein contain olefmic double bonds, and unless specified otherwise, are meant to include both E and Z geometric isomers.<br>
Tautomers are defined as compounds that undergo rapid proton shifts from one atom of the compound to another atom of the compound. Some of the compounds described herein may exist as tautomers with different points of attachment of hydrogen. Such an example may be a ketone and its enol form known as keto-enol tautomers. The individual tautomers as well as mixture thereof are encompassed with compounds of Formula I.<br>
Compounds of the Formula I may be separated into diastereoisomeric pairs of enantiomers by, for example, fractional crystallization from a suitable solvent, for example MeOH or ethyl acetate or a mixture thereof. The pair of enantiomers thus obtained may be separated into individual stereoisomers by conventional means, for example by the use of an optically active amine as a resolving agent or on a chiral HPLC column.<br>
Alternatively, any enantiomer of a compound of the general Formula I may be obtained by stereospecific synthesis using optically pure starting materials or reagents of known configuration.<br>

Compounds of the present invention are modulators of the CB1 receptor. In particular, the compounds of structural formula I are antagonists or inverse agonists of the CB 1 receptor.<br>
An "agonist" is a compound (hormone, neurotransmitter or synthetic compound) which binds to a receptor, inducing a conformational change in the receptor which, in turn, produces a response such as contraction, relaxation, secretion, change in enzyme activity, etc. similar to that elicited by the physiologically relevant agonist ligand(s) for that receptor.   An "antagonist" is a compound which attenuates the effect of an agonist. An "inverse agonist" is a compound which acts on a receptor but produces the opposite effect produced by the agonist of the particular receptor.<br>
Compounds of this invention are modulators of the CB1 receptor and as such are useful as centrally acting drugs in the treatment of psychosis, memory deficits, cognitive disorders, migraine, neuropathy, neuro-inflammatory disorders including multiple sclerosis and Guillain-Barre syndrome and the inflammatory sequelae of viral encephalitis, cerebral vascular accidents, and head trauma, anxiety disorders, stress, epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, movement disorders, and schizophrenia. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of substance abuse disorders, particularly to opiates, alcohol, marijuana, and nicotine. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of obesity or eating disorders associated with excessive food intake and complications associated therewith. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of constipation and chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of cirrhosis of the liver. The compounds are also useful for the treatment of asthma.<br>
The terms "administration of and or "administering a" compound should be understood to mean providing a compound of the invention or a prodrug of a compound of the invention to the individual in need of treatment.<br>
The administration of the compound of structural formula I in order to practice the present methods of therapy is carried out by administering an effective amount of the compound of structural formula I to the patient in need of such treatment or prophylaxis. The need for a prophylactic administration according to the methods of the present invention is determined via the use of well known risk factors. The effective amount of an individual compound is determined, in the final analysis, by the physician in charge of the case, but depends on factors such as the exact disease to be treated, the severity of the disease and other diseases or conditions from which the patient suffers, the chosen route of administration other drugs and treatments which the patient may concomitantiy require, and other factors in the physician's judgment.<br>
The utilities of the present compounds hi these diseases or disorders may be demonstrated in animal disease models that have been reported in the literature. The following are examples of such animal disease models: a) suppression of food intake and resultant weight loss in rats (Life Sciences 1998, 63, 113-117); b) reduction of sweet food intake in marmosets (Behavioural Pharm. 1998, 9, 179-181); c) reduction of sucrose and ethanol intake in mice (Psychopharm. 1997, 132, 104-106); d) increased motor activity and place conditioning in rats (Psychopharm. 1998, 135, 324-332; Psychopharmacol 2000, 151: 25-30); e) spontaneous locomotor activity in mice (J. Pharm. Exp. Ther. 1996, 277, 586-594); f) reduction in opiate self-administration in mice (Sci. 1999, 283, 401-404); g) bronchial hyperresponsiveness in sheep and guinea pigs as models for the various phases of asthma (for example, see W. M. Abraham et al., "a4-Integrins mediate antigen-induced late bronchial responses and prolonged<br>
airway hyperresponsiveness in sheep." J. Clin. Invest. 93, 776 (1993) and A. A. Y. Milne and P. P. Piper, "Role of VLA-4 integrin in leucocyte recruitment and bronchial hyperresponsiveness in the gunea-pig." Eur. J. Pharmacol., 282, 243 (1995)); h) mediation of the vasodilated state in advanced liver cirrhosis induced by carbon tetrachloride (Nature Medicine, 2001, 7 (7), 827-832); i) amitriptyline-induced constipation in cynomolgus monkeys is beneficial for the evaluation of laxatives (Biol. Pharm. Bulletin (Japan), 2000, 23(5), 657-9); j) neuropathology of paediatric chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction and animal models related to the neuropathology of paediatric chronic intestinal pseudo-obstruction (Journal of Pathology (England), 2001,194 (3), 277-88).<br>
The magnitude of prophylactic or therapeutic dose of a compound of Formula I will, of course, vary with the nature of the severity of the condition to be treated and with the particular compound of Formula I and its route of administration. It will also vary according to the age, weight and response of the individual patient. In general, the daily dose range lie within the range of from about 0.001 rng to about 100 mg per kg body weight of a mammal, preferably 0.01 mg to about 50 mg per kg, and most preferably 0.1 to 10 mg per kg, in single or divided doses. On the other hand, it may be necessary to use dosages -outside these limits in some cases.<br>
For use where a composition for intravenous administration is employed, a suitable dosage range is from about 0.001 mg to about 25 mg (preferably from 0.01 mg to about 1 mg) of a compound of Formula I per kg of body weight per day and for preventive use from about 0.1 mg to about 100 mg (preferably from about 1 mg to about 100 mg and more preferably from about 1 mg to about 10 mg) of a compound of Formula I per kg of body weight per day.<br>
In the case where an oral composition is employed, a suitable dosage range is, e.g. from about 0.01 rag to about 1000 mg of a compound of Formula I per day, preferably from about 0.1 mg to about 10 mg per day. For oral administration, the compositions are preferably provided in the form of tablets containing from 0.01 to 1,000 mg, preferably 0.01, 0.05, 0.1, 0.5, 1, 2.5, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30,40, 50, 100, 250, 500, 750 or 1000 milligrams of the active ingredient for the symptomatic adjustment of the dosage to the patient to be treated.<br>
For the treatment of diseases of the eye, ophthalmic preparations for ocular administration comprising 0.001-1% by weight solutions or suspensions of the compounds of Formula I in an acceptable ophthalmic formulation may be used.<br>
Another aspect of the present invention provides pharmaceutical compositions which comprises a compound of Formula I and a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier. The term "composition", as in pharmaceutical composition, is intended to encompass a product comprising the active ingredient(s), and the inert ingredient(s) (pharmaceutically acceptable excipients) that make up the carrier, as well as any product which results, directly or indirectly, from combination, complexation or aggregation of any two or more of the ingredients, or from dissociation of one or more of the ingredients, or from other types of reactions or interactions of one or more of the ingredients. Accordingly, the pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention encompass any composition made by admixing a compound of Formula I, additional active ingredient(s), and pharmaceutically acceptable excipients.<br>
Any suitable route of administration may be employed for providing a mammal, especially a human, with an effective dosage of a compound of the present invention. For example, oral, rectal, topical, parenteral, ocular, pulmonary, nasal, and the like may be employed. Dosage forms include tablets, troches, dispersions, suspensions, solutions, capsules, creams, ointments, aerosols, and the like.<br>
The pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention comprise a compound of Formula I as an active ingredient or a pharmaceutically acceptable salt thereof, and may also contain a pharmaceutically acceptable carrier and optionally other therapeutic ingredients. By "pharmaceutically acceptable" it is meant the carrier, diluent or excipient must be compatible with the other ingredients of the formulation and not deleterious to the recipient thereof. In particular, the term "pharmaceutically acceptable salts" refers to salts prepared from pharmaceutically acceptable non-toxic bases or acids including inorganic bases or acids and organic bases or acids.<br>
The compositions include compositions suitable for oral, rectal, topical, parenteral (including subcutaneous, intramuscular, and intravenous), ocular (ophthalmic), pulmonary (aerosol inhalation), or nasal administration, although the most suitable route in any given case will depend on the nature and severity of the conditions being treated and on the nature of the active ingredient. They may be conveniently presented in unit dosage form and prepared by any of the methods well-known in the art of pharmacy.<br>
For administration by inhalation, the compounds of the present invention are conveniently delivered in the form of an aerosol spray presentation from pressurized packs or nebulizers. The compounds may also be delivered as powders which may be formulated and the powder composition may be inhaled with the aid of an insufflation powder inhaler device. The preferred delivery systems for inhalation are metered dose inhalation (MDI) aerosol, which may be formulated as a suspension or solution of a compound of Formula I in suitable propellants, such as fluorocarbons or hydrocarbons and<br>
dry powder inhalation (DPI) aerosol, which may be formulated as a dry powder of a compound of Formula I with or without additional excipients.<br>
Suitable topical formulations of a compound of formula I include transdermal devices, aerosols, creams, solutions, ointments, gels, lotions, dusting powders, and the like. The topical pharmaceutical compositions containing the compounds of the present invention ordinarily include about 0.005% to 5% by weight of the active compound in admixture with a pharmaceutically acceptable vehicle. Transdermal skin patches useful for administering the compounds of the present inveniton include those well known to those of ordinary skill in that art. To be administered in the form of a transdermal delivery system, the dosage administration will, of course, be continuous rather than intermittent throughout the dosage regimen.<br>
In practical use, the compounds of Formula I can be combined as the active ingredient in intimate admixture with a pharmaceutical carrier according to conventional pharmaceutical compounding techniques. The carrier may take a wide variety of forms depending on the form of preparation desired for administration, e.g., oral or parenteral (including intravenous). In preparing the compositions for oral dosage form, any of the usual pharmaceutical media may be employed, such as, for example, water, glycols, oils, alcohols, flavoring agents, preservatives, coloring agents and the like in the case of oral liquid preparations, such as, for example, suspensions, elixirs and solutions; or carriers such as starches, sugars, microcrystalline cellulose, diluents, granulating agents, lubricants, binders, disintegrating agents and the like hi the case of oral solid preparations such as, for example, powders, capsules and tablets, with the solid oral preparations being preferred over the liquid preparations. Because of their ease of administration, tablets and capsules represent the most advantageous oral dosage unit form in which case solid pharmaceutical carriers are obviously employed. If desired, tablets may be coated by standard aqueous or nonaqueous techniques.<br>
In addition to the common dosage forms set out above, the compounds of Formula I may also be administered by controlled release means and/or delivery devices such as those described in U.S. Patent Nos. 3,845,770; 3,916,899; 3,536,809; 3,598,123; 3,630,200 and 4,008,719.<br>
Pharmaceutical compositions of the present invention suitable for oral administration may be presented as discrete units such as capsules (including timed release and sustained release formulations), pills, cachets, powders, granules or tablets each containing a predetermined amount of the active ingredient, as a powder or granules or as a solution or a suspension in an aqueous liquid, a non-aqueous liquid, an oil-in-water emulsion or a water-in-oil liquid emulsion, incluidng elixirs, tinctures, solutions, suspensions, syrups and emulsions. Such compositions may be prepared by any of the methods of pharmacy but all methods include the step of bringing into association the active ingredient with the carrier which constitutes one or more necessary ingredients. In general, the compositions are prepared by uniformly and intimately admixing the active ingredient with liquid carriers or finely divided solid<br>
carriers or both, and then, if necessary, shaping the product into the desired presentation. For example, a tablet may be prepared by compression or molding, optionally with one or more accessory ingredients.

It will be appreciated that for the treatment or prevention of obesity, the compounds of thp present invention may also be used in combination with inhibitors of the enzyme 11-d-HSDl. Generally, glucocorticoid concentrations are modulated by tissue-specific 1IB-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase enzymes. The 116-hydroxysteroid dehydrogenase type 1 enzyme (11$-HSD1) is a low affinity enzyme that generally uses NADP-f as a cofactor rather than NAD+ (Agarwal et al., 1989). In vitro studies have shown that llft-HSDl is capable of acting as both a reductase and a dehydrogenase. However, 11$-HSD1 in vivo generally acts as a reductase, converting 11-ketoglucocorticoids, such as cortisone, to 11$-hydroxyglucocorticoids such as cortisol.<br>
Excessive levels of cortisol have been associated with obesity, perhaps due to increased hepatic gluconeogenesis. Thus, the administration of an effective amount of an 11$-HSD1 inhibitor in combination with a CB1 antagonist of the present invention may be useful in the treatment or control of obesity. Particular inhibitors of 11$-HSD1 useful in combination with the compounds of the present invention include: 3-(l-adamantyl)-4-ethyl-5-(ethylthio)-4H-l,2,4-triazole, 3-(l-adamantyl)-5-(3,4,5-trimethoxyphenyl)-4-methyl-4H-l,2,4-triazole, and 3-adamantanyl-4,5,6,7,8,9,10,ll,12,3a-decahydro-l,2,4-triazolo[4,3-a][l l]annulene.<br>
"Obesity" is a condition in which there is an excess of body fat. The operational definition of obesity is based on the Body Mass Index (BMI), which is calculated as body weight per height in; meters squared (kg/m2). "Obesity" refers to a condition whereby an otherwise healthy subject has a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2, or a condition whereby a subject with at least one co-morbidity has a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2. An "obese subject" is an otherwise healthy subject with a Body Mass Index (BMI) greater than or equal to 30 kg/m2 or a subject with at least one co-morbidity with a BMI greater than or equal to 27 kg/m2. A "subject at risk for obesity" is an otherwise healthy subject with a BMI of 25 kg/rn2 to less than 30 kg/m2 or a subject with at least one co-morbidity with a BMI of 25 kg/m2 to less than 27 kg/m2.<br>
The increased risks associated with obesity occur at a lower Body Mass Index (BMI) in Asians. In Asian countries, including Japan, "obesity" refers to a condition whereby a subject with at least one obesity-induced or obesity-related co-morbidity that requires weight reduction or that would be improved by weight reduction, has a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2. In Asian countries, including Japan, an "obese subject" refers to a subject with at least one obesity-induced or obesity-related co-morbidity that requires weight reduction or that would be improved by weight reduction, with a BMI greater than or equal to 25 kg/m2. In Asian countries, a "subject at risk of obesity" is a subject with a BMI of greater than 23 kg/m2 to less than 25 kg/m2.<br>
As used herein, the term "obesity" is meant to encompass all of the above definitions of obesity.<br>
Obesity-induced or obesity-related co-morbidities include, but are not limited to, diabetes, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus - type 2, impaired glucose tolerance, impaired fasting glucose, insulin resistance syndrome, dyslipidemia, hypertension, hyperuricacidemia, gout, coronary artery disease, rnyocardial infarction, angina pectoris, sleep apnea syndrome, Pickwickian syndrome, fatty liver; cerebral infarction, cerebral thrombosis, transient ischemic attack, orthopedic disorders, arthritis deformans, lumbodynia, emmeniopathy, and infertility. In particular, co-morbidities include: hypertension, hyperlipidemia, dyslipidemia, glucose intolerance, cardiovascular disease, sleep apnea, diabetes mellitus, and other obesity-related conditions.<br>
"Treatment" (of obesity and obesity-related disorders) refers to the administration of the compounds of the present invention to reduce or maintain the body weight of an obese subject. One outcome of treatment may be reducing the body weight of an obese subject relative to that subject's body weight immediately before the administration of the compounds of the present invention. Another outcome of treatment may be preventing body weight regain of body weight previously lost as a result of diet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of treatment may be decreasing the occurrence of and/or the severity of obesity-related diseases. The treatment may suitably result in a reduction in food or calorie intake by the subject, including a reduction in total food intake, or a reduction of intake of specific components of the diet such as carbohydrates or fats; and/or the inhibition of nutrient absorption; and/or the inhibition of the reduction of metabolic rate; and in weight reduction in patients in need thereof. The<br>
•eatment may also result in an alteration of metabolic rate, such as an increase in metabolic rate, father ran or in addition to an inhibition of the reduction of metabolic rate; and/or in minimization of the letabolic resistance that normally results from weight loss.<br>
"Prevention" (of obesity and obesity-related disorders) refers to the administration of the ampounds of the present invention to reduce or maintain the body weight of a subject at risk of obesity, ine outcome of prevention may be reducing the body weight of a subject at risk of obesity relative to that ibject's body weight immediately before the administration of the compounds of the present invention, nother outcome of prevention may be preventing body weight regain of body weight previously lost as a :sult of diet, exercise, or pharmacotherapy. Another outcome of prevention may be preventing obesity om occurring if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of obesity in a subject at risk of obesity. Another outcome of prevention may be decreasing the occurrence and/or severity ofpbesity-related disorders if the treatment is administered prior to the onset of obesity in a subject at risk of obesity, Moreover, if treatment is commenced in already obese subjects, such treatment may prevent the occurrence, progression or severity of obesity-related disorders, such as, but not limited to, arteriosclerosis, Type II diabetes, polycystic ovarian disease, cardiovascular diseases, osteoarthritis, derrnatological disorders, hypertension, insulin resistance, hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridetnia, and cholelithiasis.<br>
The obesity-related disorders herein are associated with, caused by, or result from obesity. Examples of obesity-related disorders include overeating and bulimia, hypertension, diabetes, elevated plasma insulin concentrations and insulin resistance, dyslipidemias, hyperlipidemia, endometrial, breast, prostate and colon cancer, osteoarthritis, obstructive sleep apnea, cholelithiasis, gallstones, heart disease, abnormal heart rhythms and arrythmias, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, coronary heart disease, sudden death, stroke, polycystic ovarian disease, craniopharyngioma, the Prader-Willi Syndrome, Frohlich's syndrome, GH-deficient subjects, normal variant short stature, Turner's syndrome, and other pathological conditions showing reduced metabolic activity or a decrease in resting energy expenditure as a percentage of total fat-free mass, e.g, children with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Further examples of obesity-related disorders are metabolic syndrome, also known as syndrome X, insulin resistance syndrome, sexual and reproductive dysfunction, such as infertility, hypogonadism in males and hirsutism in females, gastrointestinal motility disorders, such as obesity-related gastro-esophageal reflux, respiratory disorders, such as obesity-hypoventilation syndrome (Pickwickian syndrome), cardiovascular disorders, inflammation, such as systemic inflammation of the vasculature, arteriosclerosis, hypercholesterolemia, hyperuricaemia, lower back pain, gallbladder disease, gout, and kidney cancer. The compounds of the present invention are also useful for reducing the risk of secondary outcomes of obesity, such as reducing the risk of left ventricular hypertrophy.<br>
The term "diabetes," as used herein, includes both insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (i.e., IDDM, also known as type I diabetes) and non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (i.e., NIDDM,<br>
also known as Type II diabetes. Type I diabetes, or insulin-dependent diabetes, is the result of an absolute deficiency of insulin, the hormone which regulates glucose utilization. Type H diabetes,* or insulin-independent diabetes (i.e., non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus), often occurs in the face of normal, or even elevated levels of insulin and appears to be the result of the inability of tissues to respond appropriately to insulin. Most of the Type n diabetics are also obese. The compounds of the present invention are useful for treating both Type I and Type II diabetes. The compounds are especially effective for treating Type n diabetes. The compounds of the present invention are also useful for treating and/or preventing gestational diabetes mellitus.<br>
